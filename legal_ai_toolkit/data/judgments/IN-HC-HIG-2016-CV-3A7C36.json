By this review petition filed by the petitioners, the\n\npetitioners seek review/recall of the order and judgment dated 12 th June\n2014 passed by this Court in Arbitration Application No.97 of 2013.\n\nSome of the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this petition are\nas under :-\n\n2. The Viacom 18 Media Private Limited-petitioner no.2 herein\nwas the original applicant along with the Indian Film Company (Cyprus)\n\nLimited in the Arbitration Application No.97 of 2013. The said Indian\nFilm Company (Cyprus) Limited has merged with M/s.Roptonal Limited,\n\nCyprus-petitioner no.1 herein on or about 19th January 2015. The\npetitioner no.1 is also a body incorporated outside India. The petitioner\n\nno.2 is having its registered office at Mumbai.\n\n3. By an agreement dated 12th May 2008 executed between\nM/s. Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited and the respondent, the\n\nrespondent has been assigned and transferred in favour of the Indian\nFilm Company (Cyprus) Limited, all their rights, title and interest. By\nvirtue of a deed of novation, all such right, title and interest of the said\n\nM/s. Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited and by virtue of an order\nof this Court passed in Company Scheme Petition No.628 of 2012\nhas now vested in the petitioner no.2.\n\n4. The dispute arose between the parties, the petitioner no.2\nherein and the said M/s. Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited invoked\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 3 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\narbitration agreement and requested for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nSince the respondent did not agree to appoint any arbitrator, the said\nM/s.Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited and the petitioner no.2\n\nherein filed an Arbitration Application (97 of 2013) under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short \"the said\nAct\") in this Court inter alia praying for an appointment of a sole\n\narbitrator. The said arbitration application was opposed by the respondent\nherein on various grounds by filing an affidavit-in-reply.\n\n5. The respondent therein however did not raise any issue of\n\njurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate of this Court to hear and\nentertain the said arbitration application. By an order dated 12 th June\n\n2014, the learned designate of the Chief Justice observed that there was\nno dispute that the arbitration agreement exists. The learned designate\nappointed a former Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court as a sole\n\narbitrator by consent of the parties. In the said order, it was made clear\n\nthat except the issue that the arbitration agreement exists, all other issues\nraised in the affidavit-in-reply were kept open. The said arbitration\napplication was disposed of by the said order dated 12th June 2014.\n\n6. Pursuant to the liberty granted by the learned arbitrator, the\npetitioners herein filed Statement of Claim before the learned arbitrator.\n\nThe respondent has filed written statement and counter-claim in the said\nproceedings.\n\n7. The petitioner no.2 and the said M/s. Indian Film Company\n(Cyprus) Limited had filed Arbitration Application No.166 of 2013\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 4 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nagainst Mr.Soham Shah under\nSection 11(6)\nof the said Act inter alia\n\npraying for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\n8. By an order dated 27th June 2014 passed by the then\ndesignate of the Chief Justice, a counsel of this Court was appointed as a\nsole arbitrator. By consent of the parties in the said matter, the learned\n\ndesignate of the Chief Justice substituted the earlier arbitrator by\npassing another order on 27th June 2014. The applicants in the said\n\narbitration application thereafter noticed that since the applicant no.1 in\nthe said arbitration application i.e.Indian Film Company Limited\n\n[formerly The Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited] was a company\nincorporated in Cyprus and admittedly was a body incorporated in the\n\ncountry other than India the arbitration between those parties would be\nan International Commercial Arbitration within the meaning of\nSection\n2(1)(f)\nof the said Act and thus the application for appointment of an\n\narbitrator could be filed only before the Chief Justice of India under\n\nSection 11(9)\nof the said Act and not under\nSection 11(6)\nof the said\nAct before the Chief Justice of this Court. The applicants in the said\n\nArbitration Application No.166 of 2013 filed a Review Petition\nbearing (L) No.32 of 2015 in this Court inter alia praying for recall of\nthe order dated 27th June 2014 passed by the then designate of the\nChief Justice on the ground that the then designate of the Chief Justice\n\nhad no jurisdiction to pass the said order under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nsaid Act since one of the parties to the said proceedings was\nincorporated in the country other than India and there was an inherent\nlack of jurisdiction in the learned designate of the Chief Justice to pass\nany such order.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 5 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\n9. The applicant applied for procedural review by filing the\n\nsaid Review Petition (L) No.32 of 2015. By an order and judgment\ndated 22nd February 2016, the learned designate of the Chief Justice\n\nrecalled the order dated 27th June 2014 passed in the Arbitration\nApplication No.166 of 2013 and dismissed the said arbitration application\nbeing without jurisdiction. The petitioners in this review petition, have\n\nalso applied for procedural review and seek recall of the order and\njudgment dated 27th June 2014 passed by the learned designate of the\n\nChief Justice on similar ground.\n\n10. Mr.Shah,\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the petitioners\ninvited my attention to the averments made in the Arbitration Application\n\n(97 of 2013), the averments made in the arbitration petition filed by the\npetitioners under\nSection 9\nof the said Act in this Court and the averments\nmade in the statement of claim filed before the learned arbitrator. He\n\nsubmits that in all the pleadings filed by the petitioners referred to\n\naforesaid, the petitioners had placed on record that the Indian Film\nCompany (Cyprus) Limited was a company incorporated in Cyprus i.e.\n\ncountry other than India. He submits that there was no dispute between\nthe parties that the said M/s. Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited\nwas a company incorporated in Cyprus i.e. one of the countries other\nthan India. He submits that neither the respondent raised any objection\n\nof jurisdiction when the said Arbitration Application No.97 of 2013\nfiled by the petitioners was heard by the designate of the Chief Justice\nof this Court nor the petitioners noticed that the said arbitration\napplication could not have been filed before the Chief Justice of this\nHigh Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the said Act in view of the arbitration\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 6 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nbetween the parties being an International Commercial Arbitration and\n\nthus the application ought to have been filed before the Chief Justice of\nIndia under\nSection 11(9)\nof the said Act.\n\n11. It is submitted that since one of the companies having\nbeen incorporated outside India, the said Arbitration Application No.97\n\nof 2013 could not have been filed before the Chief Justice of this Court\nat all and thus the order passed by the learned designate of the Chief\n\nJustice on 12th June 2014 in the said arbitration application suffered from\ninherent lack of jurisdiction, was without jurisdiction and was nullity.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on the\n\norder and judgment of this Court delivered on 22nd February 2016 in\nthe Review Petition (L) No.32 of 2015 which was filed by the original\nrespondent in the Arbitration Application No.166 of 2013 against the\n\noriginal applicants who are the original applicants i.e. Indian Film Co.\n\nLimited [formerly The Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited] and\nM/s.Viacom 18 Media Pvt. Ltd.-petitioner no.2 herein.\n\n13. The petitioner no.1 herein was also impleaded as a party-\nrespondent to the said Review Petition (L) No.32 of 2015. He submits\nthat the facts of this case and the facts in the said Review Petition (L)\n\nNo.32 of 2015 are identical and thus the said order and judgment of\nthis Court delivered on 22nd February 2016 in Review Petition (L)\nNo.32 of 2015 would squarely apply to the facts of this case. He\nsubmits that this Court has held that even if the parties did not bring to\nthe notice of the learned designate of the Chief Justice when the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 7 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\napplication under\nSection 11\nof the said Act was heard that one of the\n\nparties to the arbitration application was a body incorporated in the\ncountry other than India, the dispute would fall within definition of an\n\n\"International Commercial Arbitration\" under\nSection 2(1)(f)\nof the said\nAct, thus even by consent of the parties, learned designate of the Chief\nJustice of this Court could not have appointed an arbitrator in case of\n\nInternational Commercial Arbitration and thus question of waiver would\nnot apply to the facts of this case in view of there being inherent lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nIt is submitted that this Court has already held that merely\nbecause the review petitioner had not raised any objection before the\n\nlearned arbitrator in the written statement, the order passed by the learned\ndesignate of the Chief Justice which order itself was without jurisdiction\nand which objection could not be derogable, there would be no waiver\n\nunder\nSection 4\nof the said Act. He submits that this Court after perusing\n\nthe statement of claim filed by the original applicant before the learned\narbitrator recorded a finding that the said claim was filed by both the\n\napplicants including the applicant no.1-company which was incorporated\nin the country other than India. This Court in the said Judgment held that\nprocedural review under\nArticle 215\nof the Constitution of India is\npermissible.\n\n15. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that\nthe original petitioner-M/s.Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited which\nwas organized under the laws of Cyprus got merged and amalgamated\ninto M/s. Indian Film Company Limited which was also a foreign\nincorporated entity by an order dated 4th October 2013. He submits that\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 8 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\ninvocation of the arbitration agreement in the present proceedings was\n\nadmittedly by a body incorporated outside India. He submits that the\npresent petitioner no.1 is also a body incorporated outside India and has\n\njointly filed statement of claim with the petitioner no.2. It is submitted\nthat contractual/commercial agreement of the respondent was with M/s.\nIndian Film Company (Cyprus) Limited which was incorporated in\n\nCyprus.\n\n16. It is submitted by the learned counsel that in view of the\naforesaid admitted facts, the order passed by the learned designate of the\n\nChief Justice on 12th June 2014 appointing a sole arbitrator suffered\nfrom an error apparent on the face of the record and was ex-facie without\n\njurisdiction. It is submitted that since the learned arbitrator has been\nappointed by the learned designate of the Chief Justice of this Court who\nhad no jurisdiction to appoint any arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nin the\n\nArbitration Application No.97 of 2013, the arbitration being International\n\nCommercial Arbitration, the award if any rendered by the learned\narbitrator would be contrary to\nSection 34(2)(a)(v)\non the ground that\n\nthe composition of the arbitral tribunal was in conflict with the\nprovision of Part-I which the parties could not derogate. He submits\nthat\nSections 11(6)\nand\n11(9)\nof the said Act admittedly fall under Part-\nI of the said Act.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance\nCompany Limited Vs. Boghara Polycab Private Limited, reported in\n(2009) 1 SCC 267 and in particular paragraphs 20, 21, 22.1 to 22.3\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 9 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nthereof and would submit that when the application under Section 11 is\n\nfiled by a party, the Chief Justice or his designate himself has to decide\n(I) whether the party making application has approached the appropriate\n\nHigh Court or not, (ii) whether there was an arbitration agreement and\n\n(iii) whether the party who had applied under\nSection 11\nof the said\nAct was a party to such an agreement or not. He submits that when the\n\ndispute between the parties to the agreement is referred to the arbitration\nwithout intervention of the Court, the arbitral tribunal can decide the\n\nquestion affecting its jurisdiction: (i) whether there was an arbitration\nagreement; (ii) whether the arbitration agreement was valid; (iii)\n\nwhether the contract in which the arbitration clause was found to be\nnull and void and (iv) whether the invalidity extends to the arbitration\n\nclause also. He submits that the decision of the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate on the issue of jurisdiction and the existence of a valid\narbitration agreement would be binding on the parties when the matter\n\ngoes to the arbitral tribunal. He submits that since the arbitration\n\napplication filed by the petitioners was not before the Chief Justice of\nthe proper Court having jurisdiction, the learned Chief Justice or his\n\ndesignate had to dismiss the said arbitration application and there could\nnot have been any challenge to the appointment of the learned arbitrator\nbefore the learned arbitrator itself by a party.\n\n18. Learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the Indian Bank Vs.Manilal\nGovindji Khona, reported in (2015) 3 SCC 712 on the same issue.\nReliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of\nRosy\nBlue (India) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Orbit Corporation Ltd.\n, reported in 2013\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 10 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nSCC OnLine Bom 341 decided on 27th February 2013 in support of\n\nhis submission that there is a distinction between a procedural review\nand a review on merits and that a substantive review on merits is\n\nunavailable in respect of an order passed under\nSection 11\nof the said\nAct. He submits that the present petition filed by the petitioners is a\nprocedural review sought by the petitioners and not a review on merits.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on the judgment of\nthe Allahabad High Court in the case of\nManish Engineering\n\nEnterprises Vs. Managing Director, IFFCO, New Delhi & Ors.\n,\nreported in AIR 2008 All 56 in support of his submission that a\n\nprocedural review of an order passed under\nSection 11\nof the said Act\nis permissible.\n\n19. Mr.Sen, learned senior counsel for the respondent, on the\nother hand, submits that admittedly the learned arbitrator was appointed\n\nby the learned designate of the Chief Justice by consent of both the\n\nparties and since consent of the parties is the foundation of jurisdiction\nof the learned arbitrator, any appointment made by consent of the parties,\n\nregardless of the context, would constitute a valid appointment. He\nsubmits that since the parties had agreed to the appointment of an\narbitrator, irrespective of fact that the said order was passed by the\nlearned designate of the Chief Justice of this Court under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, though one of the parties to the arbitration proceedings was\nincorporated in the country other than India, such appointment of the\nlearned arbitrator was a valid appointment and could not be challenged\non the ground that learned designate of the Chief Justice of this Court\nhad no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator or that there was inherent lack\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 11 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nof jurisdiction of the designate of the Chief Justice to pass such order.\n\nIn support of this submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance on\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nNarayan Prasad\n\nLohia Vs. Nikunj Kumar Lohia & Ors.\n, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 572\nand more particularly paragraphs 14 to 16 thereof. Learned senior\ncounsel submits that even if a party has consented to the appointment\n\nof an arbitrator, any plea that the arbitrator has no jurisdiction to decide\nthe dispute in issue or that he is exceeding his jurisdiction has to be\n\nraised under\nSection 16\nof the said Act. He submits that no such\nobjection is raised by the petitioners before the learned arbitrator.\n\n20. In support of this submission, learned senior counsel relied\n\nupon the following judgments :-\n\n(i) The judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nKrishna\n\nBhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. Vs. G. Harishchandra Reddy & Ors.\n,\n\nreported in (2007) 2 SCC 720 (paragraphs 6 to 9);\n\n(ii) The judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nUnion of India\nVs.

The next submission of the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent is that since the petitioners have failed to raise such an\nobjection under\nSection 16\nand has proceeded with the arbitration, the\n\npetitioners would be precluded from challenging the award under\n\nSection 34\nof the said Act on the ground of jurisdiction or from raising\nsuch issue of jurisdiction in any collateral proceeding.\nIn support of this\n\nsubmission, he placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court\nin the case of\nMSP Infrastructure Limited Vs. Madhya Pradesh\n\nRoad Development Corporation Limited\n, reported in (2015) 13 SCC\n713 and in particular paragraphs 13 to 16 thereof and the judgment of\n\nthe Calcutta High Court in the case of\nPradip Kumar Mandal Vs. SSK\nBroking Services Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.\n, reported in AIR 2005 Calcutta\n\n353 and in particular paragraph 18 thereof.\n\n22. It is submitted by the learned senior counsel that since the\n\npetitioners themselves have applied for an appointment of an arbitrator\n\nunder\nSection 11\nof the said Act before the Chief Justice of this Court,\nthe petitioners are precluded from challenging the appointment of the\n\nlearned arbitrator made by the designate of the Chief Justice and more\nparticularly in view of the fact that the said appointment of the learned\narbitrator was by consent of the parties. There was no inherent lack of\njurisdiction on the part of the learned designate of the Chief Justice of\n\nthis Court to appoint the learned arbitrator. He submits that the petitioners\nhave admittedly filed a statement of claim before the learned arbitrator\nand have proceeded with the arbitration proceedings upto the stage of\nevidence and thus no review petition could be filed by the petitioners\nfor recalling the order passed by the learned designate of the Chief\nJustice on the ground raised in the petition or otherwise at this stage.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 13 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\n23.\nIn so far as the judgment of this Court delivered on 22 nd\n\nFebruary 2016 relied upon by the petitioners in the case of\nSoham Shah\nVs. The Indian Film Company Limited and Viacom\n18 Media\n\nPrivate Limited and M/s.Roptonal Limited, Cyprus is concerned,\nlearned senior counsel made an attempt to distinguish\nthe said judgment\n\non the ground that in the said matter, the parties had not consented to\n\nthe appointment of the arbitrator and the said application filed under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the said Act by the applicants therein was heard and\n\ndisposed of by the learned designate of the Chief Justice on merits. He\nsubmits that the respondent does not dispute the view taken by this\n\nCourt in the said review petition that the parties could not by consent\nconfer jurisdiction on the Chief justice of the High Court or his\n\ndesignate to decide the application that ought to be decided by the\nHon'ble Chief Justice of India. He submits that the respondent is however\ndistinguishing the facts of that judgment with the facts of this matter on\n\nthe ground that both being different.\n\n24. The next submission of the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent is that the submission of the petitioners that even by consent\nof the parties, no order for appointment of the arbitrator could be passed\nby the learned Chief Justice or his designate under\nSection 11\nof the\nsaid Act in this matter is incorrect. He submits that the judgment of this\n\nCourt delivered on 22nd February 2016 would not constitute a binding\nprecedent since\nthe said judgment\nis per incurium. In support of this\nsubmission, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the following\njudgments :-\n\n(i) Young Vs.Bristol Aeroplane Company, Limited, reported in\n(1944) KB 718 CA (pages 725-726 and 729-730);\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 14 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\n(ii) Lancaster Motor Company (London), Limited, reported in\n\n(1941) KB 675 CA (pages 677-678);\n\n(\niii) Municipal Corporation Of Delhi Vs. Gurnam Kaur\n, reported in\n\n(1989) 1 SCC 101 (page 110-111, paragraphs 11 and 12);\n\n(iv) M/s.Hari\nTrading Corporation Vs. Bank of Baroda\ndelivered on\n23rd February 2015 in Writ Petition No.11459 of 2014 (pages 42-\n\n43, Paragraph 17).\n\n25. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions made by the\nlearned senior counsel and in his alternate submission, it is submitted\n\nthat since it was the petitioners' own case that the rights of the petitioner\nno.1 (The Foreign Company) had fully vested in the petitioner no.2-an\n\nIndian Company, the petitioner no.1 was not a necessary party and thus\neven in absence of consent, the Chief Justice or his designate had\njurisdiction to entertain the petition filed under\nSection 11\nof the said\n\nAct. In support of this submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance\n\non the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Larsen &\nToubro Ltd. Vs. D.L.F. Industries Limited, reported in (2002) SCC\n\nOnLine 804 (Del).\n\n26. The next submission of the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent is that the present review petition filed by the petitioners is\n\nan abuse of process of law. The petitioners herein had filed an application\nunder\nSection 11\nfor appointment of an arbitrator in this Court praying\nfor the appointment of the arbitrator, have already filed a statement of\nclaim without demur, after considerable delay have filed the affidavits\nin lieu of examination-in-chief of their witnesses and on eve of the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 15 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\ncross-examination have sought to challenge the constitution of the arbitral\n\ntribunal by filing the present petition with an intention to delay and\ndefeat the arbitral proceedings though the same were initiated at the\n\npetitioners' own instance.\n\n27. Learned senior counsel submits that even if there is no\n\narbitration agreement between the parties, the Company Court in\nwinding up proceedings can appoint an arbitrator by consent of both the\n\nparties. He submits that even in the civil suit, even if there was no\narbitration agreement recorded between the parties, the Court can by\n\nconsent of the parties appoint an arbitrator. He submits that similarly in\nother proceedings also, any Court can appoint an arbitrator by consent\n\nof both the parties. Issue of jurisdiction of the Court is different than\nthe issue of appointment of an arbitrator. He submits that once an express\nconsent is given by the parties to the appointment of an arbitrator, it is\n\nnot relevant as to which Court passed an order appointing an arbitrator.\n\nHe submits that even if there is any inherent defect for appointment of\nan arbitrator, since the parties have acquiesced by participating in the\n\narbitral proceedings by filing statement of claim and the affidavits in\nlieu of examination-in-chief itself, such party cannot be allowed to\nchallenge the appointment of an arbitrator at this stage.\n\n28. Mr.Shah, learned counsel for the petitioners in rejoinder\nsubmits that powers of various Courts in appointing an arbitrator by\nconsent of the parties though there does not exist any arbitration\nagreement is different than the powers of the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt or his designate to appoint an arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 16 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nthe said Act or the power of the Chief Justice of India under\nSection\n\n11(9)\nof the said Act when there is a failure of consent of the parties to\nappoint an arbitrator though an arbitration agreement exists. Learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners placed reliance on\nSections 11(2)\nto\n11(6)\n\nand\n11(9)\nof the said Act. He submits that once the application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nor\nSection 11(9)\nis filed before the Chief Justice of High\n\nCourt or the Chief Justice of India as the case may be, it presupposes\nthat there was failure of consent amongst the parties though the\n\narbitration agreement existed.\n\n29.\n\nIt is submitted that once an application under\nSection 11(6)\n\nor\nSection 11(9)\nis filed, a procedure as contemplated under\nSection\n\n11(6)\nor\nSection 11(9)\nas the case may be for the purpose of\nappointment of an arbitrator commences. He submits that since the\nparties had failed to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the agreed\n\nprocedure, assistance of Chief Justice of the High Court for appointment\n\nof an arbitrator in such a situation is mandatory and not directory. He\nsubmits that the power of the Court after amendment to\nSection 11\n\nnow and power of the Chief Justice or his designate prior to the\namendment in an application under\nSection 11(6)\nor\nSection 11(9)\nas\nthe case may be could not have been exercised by any other Court\nthough the parties would have agreed to appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nThe power of the Chief Justice of High Court or the Chief Justice of\nIndia of an arbitrator as the case may be prescribed under\nSections\n11(6)\nand\n11(9)\nrespectively could be exercised only if the proceedings\nunder those provisions were filed before the Chief Justice of High Court\nor the Chief Justice of India as the case may be. He submits that the\nprovisions under\nSections 11(6)\nand\n11(9)\nare exception to each other.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 17 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nIt is submitted that the Chief Justice of India or his designate cannot\n\nappoint an arbitrator in case of a domestic arbitration by exercising\npowers under\nSection 11(9)\nand similarly, the Chief Justice of High\n\nCourt or his designate cannot appoint an arbitrator in case of\nInternational Commercial Arbitration by exercising powers under\nSection\n11(6)\n, even by consent of the parties.\n\n30. The next submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioners is that while appointing an arbitrator by learned designate of\n\nthe Chief Justice on 12th June 2014 in Arbitration Application No.97 of\n\n2013, the consent given by the parties was only in respect of the name\nof the arbitrator who was appointed by the learned designate of the\n\nChief Justice as a sole arbitrator. He submits that neither any consent\nwas given by the parties to the learned designate for appointing a sole\narbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the said Act nor such consent could be\n\ngiven. He submits that the learned designate of the Chief Justice has\n\nrendered a finding on merits that the arbitration agreement exists. He\nsubmits that the provision under\nSection 11\nof the said Act is stand\n\nalone provision and is different than the other provisions of law.\n\n31. Learned counsel for the petitioners distinguishes the\njudgment relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the respondent\n\non the ground that once an appointment was made by the Chief Justice\nor his designate under\nSection 11(6)\nof the said Act, none of the parties\ncould have raised an objection under\nSection 16\nof the said Act before\nthe learned arbitrator. He submits that even by consent of the parties,\nthe parties could not have conferred the jurisdiction on the learned Chief\nJustice of the High Court or his designate for appointment of an arbitrator\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 18 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nunder\nSection 11(9)\nin case of an International Commercial Arbitration.\n\nHe submits that the question of the said judgment delivered by this\nCourt on 22nd February 2016 in Review Petition (L) No.32 of 2015\n\nbeing per incurium did not arise. He submits that none of the judgments\nthus relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the respondent would\napply to the facts of this case. He submits that all the judgments relied\n\nupon by the learned senior counsel dealt with the issue as to whether\nthe objection in respect of the jurisdiction under\nSection 16\nought to have\n\nbeen raised by the respondent before the learned arbitrator or not.\nHe\nsubmits that principles of law laid down by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of\nS.B.P. & Company Vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. & Anr.\nreported\nin AIR 2006 SC 450 holding that the decision of the Chief Justice or\n\nhis designate on the issue of jurisdiction and the existence of a valid\narbitration agreement would be binding on the parties when the matter\ngoes to the arbitral tribunal and thus no such issue could be raised\n\nunder\nSection 16\nof the said Act before the learned arbitrator.\n\nHe\n\nsubmits that the judgment of this Court in the case of\nSoham Shah Vs.\nThe Indian Film Company Limited and Anr.\nsquarely applies to the\n\nfacts of this case and thus the order dated 12 th June 2014 passed by the\nlearned designate of the Chief Justice in Arbitration Application No.97 of\n2013 shows inherent lack of jurisdiction of the learned designate of the\nChief Justice and thus the said order being without jurisdiction deserves\n\nto be recalled.\n\nREASONS AND CONCLUSIONS :-\n\n32. I shall first decide whether this review petition filed by the\noriginal applicants for seeking recall of the order and judgment dated 12 th\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 19 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nJune,2014 passed by the learned designate of the Chief Justice in an\n\napplication filed under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act is\nmaintainable or not.\n\n33. It is a common ground that the petitioner no.2 herein was the\noriginal applicant along with Indian Film Company (Cyprus) Ltd. in the\n\nArbitration Application No.97 of 2013. The said Indian Film Company\n(Cyprus) Ltd. has merged with M/s.Roptonal Ltd., Cyprus, the petitioner\n\nno.1 herein on or about 19th January, 2015. The petitioner no.1 is also a\nbody incorporated outside India. The review petition has been filed by\n\nthe petitioners herein on the ground that the Chief Justice of this court or\nhis designate did not have power to appoint an arbitrator under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act in view of the fact that one of the party to the\narbitration agreement and to the said arbitration application was\nadmittedly incorporated outside India and thus the arbitration being the\n\n\"international commercial arbitration\" within the meaning of\nsection 2(1)\n\n(f) of the\nArbitration Act\n, the application for appointment of the arbitrator\nitself was not maintainable before the Chief Justice of this court but could\n\nbe maintained only before the Chief Justice of India under\nsection 11(9)\n\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n34. A perusal of the record clearly indicates that though the\n\nreview petitioners had filed the said Arbitration Application No.97 of\n2013 under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act inter alia praying for\nappointment of arbitrator, no objection was raised by the respondent\nabout the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate to appoint an\narbitrator under\nsection 11(6)\nor about maintainability of the said\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 20 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\narbitration application (97 of 2013). Similarly the applicants to the said\n\napplication also did not bring this fact to the notice of the learned\ndesignate of the Chief Justice when the said arbitration application was\n\nheard and disposed of by an order dated 12 th June, 2014. In view of these\nundisputed facts, the learned designate of the Chief Justice entertained the\nsaid Arbitration Application (97 of 2013) filed under\nsection 11(6)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act though the said arbitration application itself was not\nmaintainable before the Chief Justice of this court in view of the\n\narbitration being \"international commercial arbitration\" and could be filed\nonly under\nsection 11(9)\nof the Arbitration Act before Chief Justice of\n\nIndia. In my view the said arbitration application (97 of 2013) filed by\nthe review petitioners herein itself was not maintainable in this court\n\nwhich issue goes to the root of the matter.\n\n35. I shall now decide whether the order and judgment dated 12th\n\nJune, 2014 passed by the learned designate suffered from inherent lack of\n\njurisdiction and if so, whether this review petition invoking the\nprocedural review for recalling of the said order is maintainable or not.\n\n36. Seven Judges Bench of the Supreme Court in case of S.B.P.and\nCo. vs.Patel Engineering Ltd.& Anr. AIR 2006 SC 450 has construed the\npowers of Chief Justice of a High Court or his designate under\nsection\n11(6)\nand powers of the Chief Justice of India or his designate under\n\nsection 11(9)\nof the Arbitration Act at great length. The Supreme Court\nhas summed up the conclusion in\nthe said judgment\nas under :-\n\ni) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High Court or the\nChief Justice of India under Section of the Act is not an\nadministrative power. It is a judicial power.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 21 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nii) The power under Section of the Act, in its entirety, could be\n\ndelegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court only to another\njudge of that court and by the Chief Justice of India to another judge\n\nof the Supreme Court.\n\n(iii) In case of designation of a judge of the High Court or of the\n\nSupreme Court, the power that is exercised by the designated, judge\nwould be that of the Chief Justice as conferred by the statute.\n\n(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will have the right to\ndecide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this\n\njudgment. These will be, his own jurisdiction, to entertain the\nrequest, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence\n\nor otherwise of a live claim, the existence of the condition for the\nexercise of his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or\n\narbitrators. The Chief Justice or the judge designated would be\nentitled to seek the opinion of an institution in the matter of\n\nnominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of Section of the Act if\nthe need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only be\n\nthat of the Chief Justice or the judge designate.\n\n(v) Designation of a district judge as the authority under Section of the\nAct by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not warranted on the\n\nscheme of the Act.\n\n(vi) Once the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or the sole arbitrator,\nthe High Court would not interfere with orders passed by the\narbitrator or the arbitral tribunal during the course of the arbitration\nproceedings and the parties could approach the court only in terms\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 22 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nof Section of the Act or in terms of Section of the Act.\n\n(vii) Since an order passed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or by\n\nthe designated judge of that court is a judicial order, an appeal will\nlie against that order only under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of\nIndia to the Supreme Court.\n\n(viii) There can be no appeal against an order of the Chief Justice of India\nor a judge of the Supreme Court designated by him while\n\nentertaining an application under Section of the Act.\n\n(ix) In a case where an arbitral tribunal has been constituted by the parties\nwithout having recourse to Section of the Act, the arbitral tribunal\n\nwill have the jurisdiction to decide all matters as contemplated by\nSection of the Act.\n\n(x) Since all were guided by the decision of this Court in\nKonkan\n\nRailway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt\n.\n\nLtd. (2000)2SCC388 and orders under Section of the Act have been\nmade based on the position adopted in that decision, we clarify that\n\nappointments of arbitrators or arbitral tribunals thus far made, are to\nbe treated as valid, all objections being left to be decided under\nSection of the Act. As and from this date, the position as adopted in\n\nthis judgment will govern even pending applications under Section\nof the Act.\n\n(xi) Where District Judges had been designated by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court under Section of the Act, the appointment orders thus\nfar made by them will be treated as valid; but applications if any\npending before them as on this date will stand transferred, to be\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 23 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\ndealt with by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court or a\n\nJudge of that court designated by the Chief Justice.\n\n(xii) The decision in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v.\n\nRani Construction Pvt. Ltd. (2000) 2 SCC 388 is overruled.\n\n37. It is held by the Supreme Court that the power under\nsection\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act is not conferred on the Supreme Court or on\n\nthe High Court but is conferred on the Chief Justice of India or the Chief\n\nJustice of the High Court. The principal civil court of original jurisdiction\nis normally the District Court. The Parliament did not want to confer the\n\npower on the District Court, to entertain a request for appointing an\narbitrator or for constituting an arbitral tribunal under\nSection 11\nof the\nAct. It is held that the intention was to confer the power on the highest\n\njudicial authority in the State and in the country, on Chief Justices of\n\nHigh Courts and on the Chief Justice of India which provision is intended\nto add the greatest credibility to the arbitral process. It is held that the\nintention of the legislature appeared to be clear that it wanted to ensure\n\nthat the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act was exercised by the\nhighest judicial authority in the concerned State or in the country so as to\nensure the utmost authority to the process of constituting the arbitral\n\ntribunal.\n\n38. It is held that when the Chief Justice of the High Court is\nentrusted with the power, he would be entitled to designate another judge\nof the High Court for exercising that power. Similarly, the Chief Justice\nof India would be in a position to designate another judge of the Supreme\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 24 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nCourt to exercise the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. When so\n\nentrusted with the right to exercise such a power, the judge of the High\nCourt and the judge of the Supreme Court would be exercising the power\n\nvested in the Chief Justice of the High Court or in the Chief Justice of\nIndia. It is held that only a judge of the Supreme Court or a judge of the\nHigh Court could respectively be equated with the Chief Justice of India\n\nor the Chief Justice of the High Court while exercising power under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act as designated by the Chief Justice. A\n\nnon-judicial body or institution cannot be equated with a Judge of the\nHigh Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court and it has to be held that the\n\ndesignation contemplated by\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not a designation\nto an institution that is incompetent to perform judicial functions.\n\n39. Supreme Court has held that in a case where there is an\narbitration agreement, a dispute has arisen and one of the parties had\n\ninvoked the agreed procedure for appointment of an arbitrator and the\n\nother party has not co-operated, the party seeking an arbitration, could\napproach the Chief Justice of the High Court if it was an internal\n\narbitration or of the Supreme Court if it is an international arbitration to\nhave an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal appointed. The Chief Justice, when\nso requested, could appoint an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal depending on\nthe nature of the agreement between the parties and after satisfying\n\nhimself that the conditions for appointment of an arbitrator under sub-\n\nSection 11(6)\nof Section do exist. The Chief Justice could designate\nanother person or institution to take the necessary measures.\n\n40. It is held that under\nsection 11(7)\nof the Arbitration Act, the\nsaid provision has given a finality to the decisions taken by the Chief\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 25 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nJustice or any person or institution designated by him in respect of\n\nmatters falling under sub-Sections (4), (5) and (6) of\nSection 11\n. A\ndecision on jurisdiction and on the existence of the arbitration agreement\n\nand of the person making the request being a party to that agreement and\nthe subsistence of arbitrable dispute require to be decided and the\ndecision on these aspects is a prelude to the Chief Justice considering\n\nwhether the requirements of sub-sections (4), (5) or sub-section (6) of\n\nsection 11\nare satisfied when approached with the request for\n\nappointment of an arbitrator. The Chief Justice or the person or\ninstitution designated by him while functioning under\nsection 11(6)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction, whether\nthere is an arbitration agreement, whether the applicant before him, is a\n\nparty, whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled\nand if an arbitrator is to be appointed, who is the fit person, in terms of\nthe provision.\nSection 11(7)\nmakes his decision on the matters entrusted\n\nto him, final. It is held that the powers under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Act is\n\nnot conferred on the Supreme Court or on the High Court, but it is\nconferred on the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High\n\nCourt.\n\n41. It is held that the power was conferred on the highest judicial\nauthority in the country and in the State in their capacities as Chief\n\nJustices. They have been conferred the power or the right to pass an\norder contemplated under\nSection 11\nof the Act and thus such powers\nwere not an administrative power but were exercising judicial power.\n\n42. In my view since one of the parties to the arbitration\nagreement was admittedly incorporated outside India, the arbitration\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 26 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nbeing \"international commercial arbitration\" within the meaning of\n\nsection 2(1)(f)\nof the Arbitration Act, the application for appointment of\nan arbitrator in case of any breach of the agreed procedure for\n\nappointment of an arbitrator could be filed only before the Chief Justice\nof India under\nsection 11(9)\nwhen the said arbitration application (97 of\n2013) came to be filed and not before the Chief Justice of this court. In\n\nmy view in the facts of this case, only the Chief Justice of India or his\ndesignate could appoint an arbitrator under\nsection 11(9)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act and not Chief Justice of this court or his designate. None\nof the party brought these facts to the notice of the learned designate of\n\nthe Chief Justice when the said order dated 12th June, 2014 was passed by\nthe learned designate but they gave consent insofar as name of the learned\n\narbitrator is concerned.\n\n43. In my view even by consent of parties, the learned designate\n\nof the Chief Justice of this court could not have appointed an arbitrator\n\nunder\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act in view of the arbitration being\n\"international commercial arbitration\" within the meaning of\nsection 2(1)\n\n(f) of the\nArbitration Act\n. In my view, the said order dated 12 th June,\n2014 passed by the learned designate of the Chief Justice suffered from\ninherent lack of jurisdiction and thus can be recalled by the learned\ndesignate of the Chief Justice of this court by exercising powers to have\n\nprocedural review permissible under\nArticle 215\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n44. Supreme Court in case of M/s.Sangham\nTape Company vs.\nHans Raj\n(2005) 9 SCC 331 and in case of Kapra Mazdoor Ekta Union\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 27 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nvs. Birla Cotton (2005) 13 SCC 777 has carved out a distinction between\n\nthe powers of court to review on merits and the procedural review. It is\nheld that where a Court or quasi judicial authority having jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate on merit proceeds to do so, its judgment or order can be\nreviewed on merit only if the Court or the quasi judicial authority is\nvested with power of review by express provision or by necessary\n\nimplication. It is held that the procedural review belongs to a different\ncategory. In such a review, the Court or quasi judicial authority having\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate proceeds to do so, but in doing so ascertains\nwhether it had committed a procedural illegality which goes to the root of\n\nthe matter and invalidates the proceeding itself, and consequently the\norder passed therein. Supreme Court has also given various illustrations\n\nin\nthe said judgment\nas to when a court or quasi judicial authority\nexercise power of procedural review.\n\n45. The Allahabad High Court in case of\nManish Engineering\n\nEnterprises vs. Managing Director, IFFCO\n, (supra) has adverted to the\nabove referred Supreme Court judgments and has held that the court can\n\nentertain a procedural review if it had committed a procedural illegality\nwhich goes to the root of the matter and invalidates the proceeding itself,\nand consequently, the order passed therein. In my view the said\narbitration application (97 of 2013) filed by the petitioner herein before\n\nthe Chief Justice of this court under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act\nthough one of the party to the arbitration agreement was incorporated\noutside India admittedly and the arbitration being the \"international\ncommercial arbitration\", itself was not maintainable before the Chief\nJustice of this court, the order passed by the learned designate of the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 28 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nChief Justice consequently in such proceedings which were not\n\nmaintainable before the Chief Justice of this court invalidates not only the\nproceedings itself but also the order passed by the learned designate of\n\nthe Chief Justice therein.\n\n46. In my view the applicants to the said arbitration application\n\nhaving committed a procedural illegality which goes to the root of the\nmatter and was filed before the Chief Justice of a wrong court, not having\n\njurisdiction, the said proceedings itself being illegal and without\njurisdiction, the order passed by the learned designate of the Chief Justice\n\ntherein also became illegal and without jurisdiction. In my view the\npetitioners have thus rightly filed the present proceedings inter alia\n\npraying for exercise of the procedural review by the learned designate of\nthe Chief Justice and for recall of the order dated 12th June, 2014. The\njudgments of Supreme Court in case of M/s.Sangham\nTape Company\n\n(supra) and in case of\nKapra Mazdoor Ekta Union\n(supra) squarely\n\napply to the facts of this case.\n\nI am in respectful agreement with the\nviews expressed by the Allahabad High Court in case of\nManish\n\nEngineering Enterprises\n(supra).\n\nThis court in case of\nRosy Blue (India)\nPvt. Ltd.\n(supra) has adverted to the judgment of Supreme Court in case\nof\nKapra Mazdoor Ekta Union\n(supra) and has taken the same view.\n\n47. The Supreme Court in case of\nNational Insurance\nCompany Limited\n(supra) has adverted to\nthe said judgment\nin case of\nS.B.P.and Co. vs.Patel\nEngineering Ltd.& Anr.\n(supra) and has held that\nwhile deciding an application under\nsection 11\n, the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate will have to decide whether the party making the application\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 29 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nhas approached the appropriate High Court or not and whether there is an\n\narbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under\n\nsection 11\nof the Act, is a party to such an agreement or not. In my view,\n\nsince none of the parties raised objection when the said Arbitration\nApplication No.97 of 2013 was heard by the learned designate of the\nChief Justice of this court about the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his\n\ndesignate to entertain, try and dispose of the said arbitration application\non the ground that the same was without jurisdiction, the learned\n\ndesignate of the Chief Justice of this court appointed an arbitrator in the\ncircumstances stated aforesaid. Merely because the parties had agreed to\n\nthe name when the said order came to be passed or even if the parties\nwould have agreed to the appointment of an arbitrator without suggesting\n\nthe name, in the circumstances stated aforesaid, the learned designate of\nthe Chief Justice of this court could not have made any appointment of an\narbitrator in view of the said arbitration application itself being without\n\njurisdiction.\n\n48. Insofar as submission of the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent that since the parties had agreed to the appointment of an\narbitrator, irrespective of the fact that the said order was passed by the\nlearned designate of the Chief Justice of this court under\nsection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act, though one of the party to the arbitration proceeding was\n\nincorporated in the country other than India, such appointment was a\nvalid appointment and could not be challenged on the ground of their\nbeing inherent lack of jurisdiction is concerned, in my view there is no\nmerit in this submission of the learned senior counsel for the respondent.\nAs referred to aforesaid, Supreme Court in case of S.B.P.and Co. vs.Patel\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 30 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nEngineering Ltd.& Anr.\n(supra) has at great length discussed the\n\nlegislative intent while conferring the powers on the Chief Justices of\nHigh Courts and Chief Justice of India under\nsection 11(6)\nand\n11(9)\n\nrespectively.\n\n49. In my view the powers of a Chief Justice of the High Court\n\nor his designate under\nsection 11(6)\nor the powers of the Chief Justice of\nIndia or his designate under\nsection1\n\n11(9)\nof the Arbitration Act cannot\n\nbe equated with the powers of a court hearing the other matters between\nthe parties where there was no arbitration agreement recorded originally\n\nbetween the parties. Even if the parties have not recorded any arbitration\nagreement who are parties to such proceedings, the parties can arrive at\n\nan arbitration agreement even in such proceedings and agree to refer the\ndisputes to the arbitration by recording such agreement in respect of the\ndisputes which are capable of being adjudicated upon by arbitration. The\n\nparties in a winding up proceedings or in a civil suit or in a writ petition\n\nor in the other proceedings of similar nature if agreed to record a\narbitration agreement for the first time, such arbitration agreement can be\n\nrecorded by such court in which such proceedings are pending and refer\ntheir disputes to arbitration which are capable of being adjudicated upon\nin an arbitration.\n\n50. In my view even when such courts exercise such powers by\nrecording arbitration agreement for the first time in such proceedings,\nsuch courts cannot and does not exercise powers under\nsection 11\nof the\nArbitration Act which powers are specifically conferred only on the Chief\nJustice of a High Court or his designate or the Chief Justice of India or\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 31 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nhis designate as the case may be. In my view the learned senior counsel\n\nfor the respondent is thus not correct in his submission that if by consent\nof parties, if an arbitrator can be appointed by courts in the proceedings\n\nother than the arbitration proceedings, the Chief Justice of the High Court\nor his designate can also appoint an arbitrator by consent of parties even\nif the arbitration was \"international commercial arbitration\" and one of\n\nthe party to the arbitration agreement had been incorporated outside\nIndia. In my view there is no substance in the submission of the learned\n\nsenior counsel that once consent was given by the parties to appoint an\narbitrator in a proceeding under\nsection 11\n, such party cannot challenge\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate to appoint an\narbitrator though there was inherent lack of jurisdiction of the Chief\n\nJustice or his designate to pass such order.\n\n51.\nInsofar as judgment of Supreme Court in case of\nNarayan\n\nPrasad Lohia\n(supra) relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent is concerned, the Supreme Court on conjoint reading of\n\nSections 11\nand\nhas held that the objections to the composition of the\n\narbitral tribunal as a matter which is derogable because a party is free not\nto object within the time prescribed under\nsection 16(2)\nand if a party\nchooses not to so object, there will be a deemed waiver under\nsection 4\n.\nIn the said matter the arbitral proceedings were conducted by the two\n\narbitrators. The respondent did not raise any objection in the arbitral\nproceedings about the composition of the arbitral tribunal of two\nmembers by raising an objection under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration Act.\nSupreme Court held that the two arbitrators could appoint a third\narbitrator at a later stage if and when they differ to ensure that on a\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 32 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\ndifference of opinion the arbitration proceedings were not frustrated.\n\nSupreme Court held that the provisions of\nsection 10\nwhich provides that\nthe number of arbitrator shall not be an even number is a derogable\n\nprovision and thus if an objection is not raised under\nsection 16\nbefore the\nlearned arbitrator, it would amount to waiver of a right to object\nsubsequently in view of the\nsection 4\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n52. In my view even if the original applicant did not bring to the\n\nnotice of the learned designate of the Chief Justice that the arbitration\napplication filed by the applicant was not maintainable before the Chief\n\nJustice of this court or the respondent did not raise any objection about\nthe maintainability of the said arbitration application before the Chief\n\nJustice of this court and agreed to the name of the learned arbitrator\nbeing appointed, since it was a case of lack of inherent jurisdiction of the\nlearned Chief Justice or his designate to pass any order under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act in view of one of the parties having\n\nincorporated outside India, it would not amount to any waiver on the part\nof the either party under\nsection 4\nof the Arbitration Act. In my view, the\n\nprovisions of\nsection 11(6)\nor\nsection 11(9)\nare not derogable and thus the\nquestion of waiver under\nsection 4\nof the Arbitration Act does not arise.\nThe judgment of Supreme Court in case of\nNarayan Prasad Lohia\n\n(supra) relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the respondent thus\n\ndoes not assist the respondent and is clearly distinguishable in the facts of\nthis case.\n\n53.\nInsofar as submission of the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent that the petitioners herein not having raised any objection\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 33 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nunder\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration Act before the learned arbitrator and\n\nhaving participated in the arbitral proceedings are precluded from\nchallenging the appointment of the learned arbitrator made by the learned\n\ndesignate of the Chief Justice is concerned, Supreme Court in case of\nS.B.P.and Co. vs.Patel\nEngineering Ltd.& Anr.\n(supra) has dealt with\nthis issue at great length. It is held that in a case where the arbitral\n\ntribunal has been constituted by the parties without having recourse of\n\nsection 11(6)\nof the Act, the arbitral tribunal will have jurisdiction to\n\ndecide all the matters as contemplated under\nsection 16\nof the Act.\nAdmittedly in this case, the learned arbitrator was appointed by the\n\nintervention of the court under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act and\nthus no objection under\nsection 16\ncould have been raised by a party\n\nbefore the learned arbitrator.\n\nThe principles\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme\nCourt in case of S.B.P.and Co. vs.Patel\nEngineering Ltd.& Anr.\n(supra)\nsquarely applies to the facts of this case. I am respectfully bound by\nthe\n\nsaid judgment\n.\n\nThe judgments relied upon by the learned senior counsel\n\nfor the respondent in case of (1)\nKrishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd.\n\n(supra), (\n2) Union of India vs. Pam Development Private Limited\n\n(supra), (3) Neelakantan & Bros.\n\nConstruction\n(supra) and (4)\nGanesh\nBenzoplast Ltd. Mumbai\n(supra) do not apply to the facts of this case\nand are clearly distinguishable. Since the issue of jurisdiction had not\nbeen raised by the respondent to the said arbitration application such\n\nissue was thus deemed to have been rejected by the learned designate of\nthe Chief Justice.\n\n54. Insofar as submission of the learned senior counsel that the\npetitioners having failed to raise an issue of jurisdiction under\nsection 16\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 34 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nbefore the learned arbitrator, the petitioners are precluded from\n\nchallenging the award under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration Act on that\nground is concerned, the learned arbitrator has admittedly not rendered\n\nany arbitral award and thus this court need not go into the issue whether\nsuch issue not having been raised before the learned arbitrator can be\npermitted to be raised in a petition under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nor not. The judgment of Supreme Court in case of\nMSP Infrastructure\nLimited\n(supra) and judgment of Calcutta High Court in case of\nPradip\n\nKumar Mondal\n(supra) would not apply to the facts of this case and are\nclearly distinguishable.\n\n55. Insofar as submission of the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent that the petitioners themselves had applied for an appointment\nof an arbitrator under\nsection 11\nbefore the Chief Justice of this court, the\npetitioners are precluded from challenging the order appointing the\n\nlearned arbitrator passed by the designate of the Chief Justice and also on\n\nthe ground that the petitioners have admittedly filed a statement of claim\nand the proceedings are proceeded upto the stage of commencement of\n\nevidence is concerned, in my view there is no merit in this submission of\nthe learned senior counsel. The respondents themselves have not raised\nany issue of jurisdiction before the learned designate of the Chief Justice\nin the said arbitration application filed by the petitioners under\nsection\n\n11(6)\n. In the facts of this case, there was inherent lack of the jurisdiction\non the part of the learned designate of the Chief Justice to appoint the\nlearned arbitrator. Merely because the petitioners have filed a statement\nof claim before the learned arbitrator or have filed affidavit of evidence,\nthat would not confer jurisdiction on the learned arbitrator since he has\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 35 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nbeen appointed by the learned designate of the Chief Justice of this court\n\nwho had no jurisdiction to entertain the arbitration application filed by the\npetitioners under\nsection 11(6)\nin view of the admitted fact that one of the\n\nparty had incorporated outside India. In any event, since the issue of\njurisdiction was not raised by the respondent before the learned designate\nof the Chief Justice in the said arbitration application, the issue of\n\njurisdiction was deemed to have been rejected by the designate by the\nlearned Chief Justice in the said order. The learned arbitrator thus in my\n\nview could not have re-opened the said issue.\n\n56.\n\nSince the said order was passed by the designate of the Chief\nJustice who had inherent lack of jurisdiction, the only remedy of the\n\npetitioners was to file a review petition by applying for procedural review\nwhich is rightly done by the petitioners in this case. Be that as it may, the\nissue of jurisdiction under\nsection 16\ncould not have been raised by the\n\nclaimants in the arbitral proceedings. The issue of jurisdiction if any\n\ncould be raised only by the respondents under\nsection 16\nnot later filing\nstatement of defence.\n\n57.\nInsofar as judgment of this court delivered on 22 nd February,\n2016 in case of\nSoham Shah\n(supra) relied upon by the learned counsel\nfor the petitioners and distinguished by the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent is concerned, learned senior counsel for the respondent has\nfairly conceded that the parties could not by consent confer the\njurisdiction on the learned Chief Justice of the High Court or his\ndesignate to decide the application which could have been decided by the\nChief Justice of India only.\n\nI do not propose to rely upon such judgment\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 36 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nin case of\nSoham Shah\n(supra) as a precedent in this matter since\nthe said\n\njudgment\nwas also delivered by the designate of the Chief Justice and\ncannot be considered as a binding precedent. I however propose to take\n\nthe same view in the facts and circumstances of this case independently.\n\n58.\nInsofar as the submission of the learned senior counsel that\n\nthe said judgment\ndated 22nd February, 2016 in case of\nSoham Shah\n\n(supra) would not constitute a binding precedent since\nthe said judgment\n\nis per incuriam is concerned, the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent could not point out as to how\nthe said judgment\nis per\n\nincuriam. Be that as it may, since I have not proposed to rely upon\nthe\nsaid judgment\nas a binding precedent, it is not necessary to consider the\n\nsubmission of the learned senior counsel that\nthe said judgment\nis per\nincuriam.\n\nThe judgments in case of (1) Young vs.Bristol\nAeroplace\nCompany Limited\n(supra), (2)\nLancaster Motor Company (London)\n\nLimited\n(supra), (3)\nMunicipal Corporation of Delhi\n(supra) and (4)\n\nM/s.Hari\nTrading Corporation\n(supra), relied upon by the learned senior\ncounsel on this issue thus would not apply to the facts of this case.\n\nReliance placed thereon is misplaced.\n\n59. Insofar as submission of the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent that since it was the petitioners' own case that the rights of the\n\npetitioner no.1 had fully vested in the petitioner no.2 an Indian company,\npetitioner no.1 was not a necessary party and thus in absence of its\nconsent, the Chief Justice or his designate had jurisdiction to entertain the\npetition under\nsection 11\nof the Arbitration Act is concerned, a perusal of\nthe statement of claim filed by the petitioners before the learned arbitrator\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 37 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nforming part of record of these proceedings clearly indicates that both the\n\npetitioners have applied for reliefs in the arbitral proceedings. There is\nthus no merit in this submission of the learned senior counsel. Reliance\n\nplaced on the judgment of Delhi High Court in case of Larsen & Tourbo\n(supra) on this issue is thus misplaced.\n\n60. Insofar as submission of the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent that the present review petition filed by the petitioners is an\n\nabuse of process of law in view of the petitioners having filed a\nstatement of claim and affidavit in lieu of examination in chief is\n\nconcerned, it is a matter of record that the respondent also did not raise\nany issue of jurisdiction before the learned arbitrator or before the learned\n\ndesignate of the Chief Justice in the arbitration application filed by the\npetitioners. Merely because statement of claim or affidavit of evidence is\nfiled by the petitioners, it would not preclude the petitioners from seeking\n\nprocedural review in view of the fact that the said order passed by the\n\nlearned designate of the Chief Justice was without jurisdiction and nullity.\nIn my view there is thus no merit in this submission of the learned senior\n\ncounsel.\n\n61. In my view the powers of the Chief Justice of High Court or\nhis designate under\nsection 11(6)\nand power of Chief Justice of India or\n\nhis designate can be exercised only when there is failure of consent of\nparties though there is an arbitration agreement exist and cannot be\nequated with powers of court in other proceedings where there was no\narbitration agreement recorded between the parties initially. Pursuant to\nthe powers conferred on the Chief Justice of the High Courts and the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 38 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\nSupreme Court, courts have framed schemes for appointment of arbitrator\n\nand have framed rules. Since the parties had failed to appoint an\narbitrator in accordance with the agreed procedure, the assistance of the\n\nChief Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice of India for\nappointment of an arbitrator in such a situation is mandatory and not\ndirectory. Such powers under\nsection 11(6)\nor under\nsection 11(9)\ncannot\n\nbe exercised by any other court even by consent of parties. Similar\npowers which vest in the Chief Justice of India under\nsection 11(9)\ncould\n\nnot have been exercised by the Chief Justice of a High Court or his\ndesignate under\nsection 11(6)\neven by consent of parties. The provisions\n\nunder\nsection 11(6)\nand\n11(9)\nare exception to each other.\n\n62. Supreme Court in case of\nZuari Cement Ltd. vs. Regional\nDirector, ESIC Hyderabad & Ors.\n(2015) 7 SCC 690 has held that where\nthere is want of jurisdiction, the order passed by the court/tribunal is a\n\nnullity or non est. What is relevant is whether the court had the power to\n\ngrant the relief asked for. Supreme Court has dealt with an order passed\nby the High Court directing the appellant to approach the ESI Court\n\nconstituted under section 74 of the ESIS Act for the reliefs which the\nappellant had claimed in the writ petition. None of the parties to the said\nproceedings challenged the order of the High Court but subjected\nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the ESIS Court. It is held by the\n\nSupreme Court that neither order of the High Court nor the act of the\ncorporation subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of the ESIS Court would\nconfer the jurisdiction upon ESIS Court to determine the question of\nexemption from the operation of the Act. It is held that by consent, the\nparties cannot agree to jurisdiction in the court to try the dispute when the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 39 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\ncourt does not have jurisdiction. It is held that the objection as to want of\n\njurisdiction can be raised at any stage when the court lacks jurisdiction,\nthe fact that the parties earlier acquiesced in the proceedings is of no\n\nconsequence. Though the High Court had directed one of the parties to\napproach the ESIS Court constituted under section 74 of the ESIS Act and\nsuch party had approached the ESIS Court pursuant to the said order\n\npassed by the High Court, the Supreme Court having held that the ESI\nCourt could not have decided the said issue involved in the said\n\nproceedings, the order passed by the ESI Court was declared the non est.\n\n63.\n\nInsofar as submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioners that the parties had given consent only in respect of the name\n\nof the learned arbitrator who was appointed by the learned designate of\nthe Chief Justice and no consent for appointment of the sole arbitrator is\nconcerned, a perusal of the said order dated 12th June, 2014 clearly\n\nindicates that the parties had agreed to the name of a former Chief Justice\n\nof Allahabad High Court as a sole arbitrator. Be that as it may, even by\nconsent for appointment of an arbitrator by parties could not have\n\nconferred jurisdiction on the learned designate of the Chief Justice under\n\nsection 11(6)\nfor the reasons recorded aforesaid. In my view the present\nproceeding is seeking procedural review of the order dated 12th June,\n2014 is thus maintainable. The petitioners have made out a case for recall\n\nof the order dated 12th June, 2014 passed by the learned designate of the\nChief Justice and the said order thus deserves to be recalled.\n\n64. In my view since the designate of the Chief Justice did not\nhave power to appoint an arbitrator in case of international commercial\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/06/2016 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2016 00:00:07 :::\n\nppn 40 rpl-7.16(j).doc\n\narbitration and such power vest only in the Chief Justice of India under\n\nsection 11(9)\nof the Arbitration Act, even such an order passed by the\nlearned designate of the Chief Justice would not confer the jurisdiction on\n\nthe learned arbitrator though the parties to the arbitration application had\nnot raised any objection about maintainability of the said arbitration\napplication and had acquiesced in the arbitration application filed before\n\nthe Chief Justice of this court and the same was of no consequence. In\nmy view, the judgment of Supreme Court in case of Zuari Cement Ltd.\n\n(supra) squarely applies to the facts of this case. I am respectfully bound\nby\nthe said judgment\n.\n\n65. I, therefore, pass the following order:-\n\n(a) Order dated 12th June, 2014 passed by the learned designate of the\nChief Justice in arbitration application No.97 of 2013 is recalled.\n\n(b) Arbitration Application No.97 of 2013 is dismissed being without\n\njurisdiction.\n\n(c) Review Petition (L) No.7 of 2016 is allowed in the aforesaid terms.\n\n(d) No order as to costs.\n\n(R.D.
