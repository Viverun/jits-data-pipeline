JUSTICE KULDEEP MATHUR\n\n Order\n\n04/10/2023\n This application for bail under \nSection 439\n Cr.P.C. has been\n\nfiled by the petitioner who has been arrested in connection with\n\nF.I.R. No.180/2022 registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\n\nChittorgarh for the offences under \nSections 8\n/\n15\n and \n8\n/\n29\n of the\n\nNDPS Act.\n\n Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Public\n\nProsecutor. Perused the material available on record.\n\n Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that as per\n\nprosecution, on 08.11.2022, the SHO, Police Station Bhadesar,\n\nDistrict Chittorgarh flagged down a car bearing registration\n\nNo.GJ08-BS-6609. Learned counsel further submitted that two\n\npersons were sitting in the car, who on seeing the police party,\n\ntried to flee away from the spot. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nas per prosecution, one person namely Narayan S/o Shankar Lal\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JD:32963] (2 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\nJat was apprehended by the police on the spot however, the\n\npetitioner was successful in fleeing away from the place. Learned\n\ncounsel submitted that after observing mandatory formalities, the\n\npolice team recovered contraband (poppy husk/poppy straw)\n\nweighing 134 kg. from the offending vehicle.\n\n Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner has been\n\nfalsely roped in the present case. Learned counsel submitted that\n\nrecovery of contraband was made on 08.11.2022, the sample of\n\ncontraband were sent to the FSL only on 15.11.2022 i.e. after\n\nseven days of the alleged recovery; that the samples have been\n\nsent to the FSL after 72 hours of the seizure, whereas as per\n\nClause 13 of Standing Order No.01/88 issued by the Narcotic\n\nControl Bureau, the samples are required to be sent for FSL\n\nexamination within 72 hours of the seizure. It was submitted that\n\nin the present case, the samples were sent beyond the 72 hours\n\nperiod and thus, the possibility of samples being tampered with\n\ncannot be ruled out. Learned counsel submitted that co-accused -\n\nNarayan S/o Shankar Lal Jat who was arrested by police on the\n\nspot has already been enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate Bench of\n\nthis Court vide order dated 22.06.2023. Learned counsel\n\nsubmitted that the case of the present petitioner is not\n\ndistinguishable from that of the co-accused - Narayan S/o\n\nShankar Lal Jat who has already been enlarged on bail.\n\n Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner was not\n\narrested on the spot and the contraband greater than was not\n\nrecovered from conscious possession of the petitioner; challan\n\nagainst the petitioner has already been filed; the petitioner is in\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JD:32963] (3 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\njudicial custody and the trial of the case will take sufficiently long\n\ntime.\n\n On these grounds, he implored the court to enlarge the\n\npetitioner on bail.\n\n The order dated 22.06.2023 passed in S.B. Criminal Misc.\n\nBail Application No.7644/2023 is reproduced for ready reference:\n\n \"1. The prayer made in this bail petition filed under \nSection\n 439\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \"the\n Code\") is for grant of bail in connection with crime\n registered pursuant to First Information Report Number\n 180/2022 of Police Station Bhadesar, District Chittorgarh in\n respect of offence(s) punishable under Section(s) 8 / 1 5 a\n n d 2 9 o f t h e Narcotic Drugs and Psy-chotropic\n Substances Act (hereinafter to be referred as \"the \nNDPS\n Act\n\").\n\n 2. Heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for\n the applicant, learned public prosecutor and carefully\n perused the en-tire material available in case diary.\n\n 3. The accusation against the petitioner-accused is that\n S.H.O. Shankar Lal Rao of Police Station Bhadesar, District\n Chittorgarh, on 08.11.2022 along with other police officials\n was on patrol duty for checking crimes at the road leading\n from Bhadesar to Mandfiya. A check post was set-up\n besides the road. It is alleged that at about 01.30 PM, a car\n bearing registration number GJ-08-BS-6609 came at a very\n high speed which was stopped, in which 2 persons were\n aboard. Seeing the police party, the driver tried to reverse\n the car but failed. He got down from the car and fled away.\n The other person in the car was apprehended, on being\n asked the name and address, he disclosed his name as\n Narayan s/o Shankarlal and the name of the fleeing person\n as Narayan s/o Dayaram. After due formalities, the police\n team proceeded to search the vehicle from which, 134 Kgs.\n of poppy-straw was recovered.\n\n 4. After investigation, charge-sheet was filed against\n petitioner-accused and investigation has been kept pending\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JD:32963] (4 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\n against other co-accused Narayan s/o Dayaram and Ratan\n Lal under section 173(8) of the criminal Procedure Code.\n\n 5. Petitioner Narayan S/o Shanker Lal Jat was arrested on\n 08.11.2022 since then, he is in custody and has\n approached thisCourt by way of this application for bail\n preferred under \nSection439\n Cr.P.C.\n\n \n6. Learned counsel appearing for the accused has argued\n that there was delay in sending the samples of alleged\n contraband to the laboratory. As per record of the charge-\n sheet, the recovery of the poppy-straw was made on\n 08.11.2022 and the packets of sample were received in the\n laboratory only on 15.11.2022 i.e. af-ter 7 days of the\n alleged recovery; that the samples have been sent to the\n FSL after 72 hours of the seizure whereas as per Clause 13\n of Standing Order No. 01/88 issued by the Narcotic Control\n Bureau, the samples were required to be sent to FSL for\n testing within 72 hours of seizure to maintain the reliability\n of the samples. In the present case, the said mandatory\n direction has not been complied with, therefore, the\n possibility of tampering with the samples cannot be ruled\n out. It is further contended that there is no such document\n on the record that can explain the rea-sons for this delay,\n therefore, the possibility of change in the sam-ple cannot\n be ruled out. It is further submitted that investigation is\n complete and the petitioner has already been in custody\n since 08.11.2022. There is no other case against the\n petitioner. Reliance has been placed on the decision of\n \nState of Uttar Pradesh vs. Hansraj @ Hansu\n 2019 (1) CJ\n (Cri.) 93 rendered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.\n\n 7. Learned counsel for the State has opposed the grant of\n bail but he is not in a position to controvert the above\n mentioned date of recovery of contraband and date of\n receipt issued by the FSL. It is argued that the petitioner is\n involved in drug peddling. The re-covery from him is of\n commercial quantity and the bar as con-tained in \nSection\n 37\n of the NDPS Act is attracted. He thus craves rejection of\n the petitioner's bail application.\n\n \n8. The petitioner has been in custody for sufficient period.\n After completion of investigation, the charge sheet has\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JD:32963] (5 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\n already been filed. Trial is likely to consume time and no\n useful purpose would be served by keeping him in\n detention for an indefinite period. The petitioner is not\n involved in any other case under the \nNDPS Act\n. The point\n raised regarding delay in sending the sample to FSL and its\n consequences is a matter of trial. However, in the present\n case sufficient mitigating circumstances are made out to\n extend the concession of bail to the petitioner in view of\n decision of \nState ofUttar Pradesh vs. Hansraj @ Hansu\n\n reported in 2019 (1) CJ (Cri.)93.\n\n 9. Keeping in view the above facts and without commenting\n upon the merits of the case, this Court feels that the\n accused has available to him, substantial ground so as to\n question the case of the prosecution and restriction\n imposed by \nSection 37\n of the NDPS Act are duly satisfied.\n Therefore, I deem this to be a fit case for grant of regular\n bail to the petitioner.\n\n 10. Consequently, the present bail application is allowed\n and it is directed that the accused-petitioner Narayan S/o\n Shankar Lal Jat, arrested in connection with the F.I.R. No.\n 180/2022, registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\n Chitrtograrh shall be released on bail provided he furnishes\n a personal bond and two surety bonds of sufficient amount\n to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the\n stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of\n hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This order is\n sub-ject to the condition that accused, within 7 days of his\n release and sureties, on the day of furnishing bail, will also\n furnish details of their all bank accounts, with bank and\n branch name, in shape of an affidavit, and submit legible\n copy of their Aadhar cards as well as front page of Bank\n pass book, for smooth recovery of penalty amount, if there\n arise a need for recovery of penalty under Sec-tion 446\n \nCr.P.C\n in future.\"\n\n Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently\n\nopposed the bail application. However, he was not in a position to\n\nrefute the fact that above-named co-accused person has already\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\n [2023:RJ-JD:32963] (6 of 6) [CRLMB-12080/2023]\n\n been enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide\n\n order dated 22.06.2023.\n\n Having considered the rival submissions, facts and\n\n circumstances of the case, so also the fact that above-named co-\n\n accused person has already been enlarged on bail by a co-ordinate\n\n Bench of this Court vide order dated 22.06.2023, this Court\n\n without expressing any opinion on merits/demerits of the case\n\n deems it just and proper to enlarge the petitioner on bail.\n\n Consequently, the bail application under \nSection 439\n Cr.P.C.\n\n is allowed. It is ordered that the accused-petitioner - Narain Lal\n\n S/o Daya Ram Jat arrested in connection with F.I.R.\n\n No.180/2022 registered at Police Station Bhadesar, District\n\n Chittorgarh shall be released on bail, if not wanted in any other\n\n case, provided he furnishes a personal bond of Rs.1,00,000/- and\n\n two sureties of Rs.50,000/- each, to the satisfaction of learned\n\n trial court, for his appearance before that court on each & every\n\n date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till completion\n\n of the trial.\n\n (KULDEEP MATHUR),J\n 868-Ravi Khandelwal\n\n (Downloaded on 12/11/2023 at 06:51:43 AM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",

As per record of the charge-\n sheet, the recovery of the poppy-straw was made on\n 08.11.2022 and the packets of sample were received in the\n laboratory only on 15.11.2022 i.e. af-ter 7 days of the\n alleged recovery; that the samples have been sent to the\n FSL after 72 hours of the seizure whereas as per Clause 13\n of Standing Order No. 01/88 issued by the Narcotic Control\n Bureau, the samples were required to be sent to FSL for\n testing within 72 hours of seizure to maintain the reliability\n of the samples. In the present case, the said mandatory\n direction has not been complied with, therefore, the\n possibility of tampering with the samples cannot be ruled\n out. It is further contended that there is no such document\n on the record that can explain the rea-sons for this delay,\n therefore, the possibility of change in the sam-ple cannot\n be ruled out. It is further submitted that investigation is\n complete and the petitioner has already been in custody\n since 08.11.2022. There is no other case against the\n petitioner. Reliance has been placed on the decision of\n \nState of Uttar Pradesh vs. Hansraj @ Hansu\n 2019 (1) CJ\n (Cri.) 93 rendered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court."
