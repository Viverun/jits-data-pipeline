Shrivastava, Member (Judicial)\n\n This Original Application has been filed on 15.04.2023 under\n\nSection 19\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 for the following\n\nrelief contained in para-8 of the O.A., as under: -\n\n \"8.i. To quash and set aside the impugned order dated 08.04.2023\n passed by respondent no. 4 (Colonel K.M. Singh, OIC Station Head\n Quarter ECHS Cell, Varanasi Cantt..\n\n ii. to direct the respondents not to interfere in the peaceful working of\n the applicant as Dental Officer in ECHS Policlinic, Ghazipur and ensure his\n monthly regular salary as and when it falls due.\n\n 2\n\n iii. to award cost of the original application to the applicant.\"\n\n2. During the arguments, it is submitted by the applicant's counsel\n\nthat he does not want to press the relief No. (i) related to appointment of\n\nrespondent No. 5. He only insisted upon the point that the applicant was\n\nappointed on ad hoc basis, therefore, he cannot be replaced by another\n\nad hoc appointee. As per learned counsel for the applicant, he is not\n\nchallenging the appointment procedure of respondent No. 5. He only\n\nchallenged the action taken by the respondents under which the applicant\n\nhas been replaced by appointing another ad hoc employee i.e. respondent\n\nNo. 5.\n\n3. As per applicant, he was appointed as a \"Dental Officer\" by\n\nappointment letter dated 13.02.2020 on \"ad-hoc basis\" for 89 days w.e.f.\n\n14.02.2020. The services of applicant, after 12.05.2020, were extended\n\nby respondent No. 4 from time to time. The last extension was granted\n\nfrom 27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023. The applicant was working as a Dental\n\nOfficer on ECHS, Polyclinic, District Ghazipur. The last experience\n\ncertificate (annexure A-4) was also issued by the respondent No. 3 on\n\n24.01.2023. There was no any complaint against the applicant and he\n\nwas serving with his full sincerity and devotion.\n\n4. It is again submitted by the applicant that the respondent No. 4\n\nillegally and arbitrarily issued the appointment letter on contractual basis\n\nin favour of respondent No. 5 Dr. Mehdi Askari. The aforesaid\n\nappointment is based on upon the choice of respondent No. 4. The\n\nservices of applicant could not be terminated. The applicant also filed the\n\ndetailed representation dated 10.04.2023. It is submitted that as per the\n\nestablished law by the Supreme Court and the C.A.T. Full Bench, the ad\n\nhoc appointment cannot be replaced by another ad hoc appointment.\n\n5. The respondents opposed the O.A. and filed the counter affidavit on\n\n05.07.2023. It is submitted by the respondents that the appointment\n\n 3\n\nwas temporary and upon the contractual basis for 89 days w.e.f.\n\n14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020. The services of applicant were not extended\n\nbut he was re-appointed again on temporary and contractual basis w.e.f.\n\n16.05.2020 to 12.08.2020 and thereafter from 17.08.2020 to 13.11.2020\n\nand from 17.02.2021 to 16.05.2021 due to Covid 19 restrictions. It is\n\nalso submitted that on relaxation of Covid 19 restrictions, the provisions\n\nof Central Organization, ECHS letter No. B-49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated\n\n22.12.2017 was followed for selection/appointment to the post of Dental\n\nOfficer on ECHS, P.S., Gazipur. The applicant was selected by the Board\n\nof Officers and appointed by the Station Commander, Varanasi initially for\n\n11 months w.e.f. 24.05.2021 to 23.04.2022 and extension was granted\n\nfrom 27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023 in accordance with the provisions\n\ncontained in aforesaid Central Organization letter. The applicant's\n\ncontractual appointment was only up to 26.04.2023. The most suitable\n\ncandidate has been selected through the Board of Officers in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of Central Organization ECHS letter No. B-\n\n49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated 22.12.2017. It is also submitted by the\n\nrespondents that the new selection was conducted by following the\n\nexisting rule. The applicant himself participated in the aforesaid selection\n\nand the respondent No. 5 has been duly selected while the applicant has\n\nbeen kept in reserved list at serial No. 2. After participating in the\n\nselection/appointment, the applicant cannot challenge the aforesaid\n\nselection procedure.\n\n6. The applicant also filed the supplementary affidavit on 19.04.2023,\n\nsecond supplementary affidavit on 26.04.2023 and third supplementary\n\naffidavit on 28.04.2023 along with some documents. The rejoinder\n\naffidavit was filed on 11.07.2023.\n\n7. The main contention of the applicant is related to appointment of\n\nrespondent No. 5. Because as per the applicant, he was appointed on ad\n\nhoc basis and his services were extended from time to time. Therefore,\n\n 4\n\nhis services cannot be terminated by replacing him from another\n\ncontractual employee. The applicant placed reliance upon \nMs. Parveen\n\nKhan v. Government of NCT, Delhi\n dated 25.03.2010 passed by the\n\nFull Bench of CAT, New Delhi.\n \nIt appears from the aforesaid Judgment\n\nthat the matter was referred to the Full Bench in the light of \nHarminder\n\nKaur and others v. Union of India and others\n 2009 (7) SCALE\n\n2004.\n \nThe Full Bench of CAT decided the aforesaid reference in the light\n\nof the Supreme Court Judgment passed in \nPiara Singh v. State of\n\nHaryana\n 1992 (4) SLR 770 and Dr. A.K. Jain and others v. Union of\n\nIndia 1987 (Supp.) SCC 497. The Court said that the issue is well\n\nsettled on the basis of judicial precedent that a set of contractual\n\nemployee shall not be replaced by another set of contractual employee\n\nexcept if the contractual employees are not working satisfactorily.\n\n8. The applicant also submitted the copies of orders dated 27.02.2018\n\npassed in W.P. (S/S) No. 345 of 2018, 350 of 2018, 353 of 2018 and 352\n\nof 2018 passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital. The\n\naforesaid four orders are related to the interim relief and any law has not\n\nbeen laid down. The order passed only for interim measure cannot be\n\nfollowed as a \"principle of law\".\n\n9. As per applicant, he was initially appointed by order dated\n\n13.02.2020 for the period from 14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020. According to\n\napplicant, his services were extended from time to time till 26.04.2023.\n\nBut, the respondents did not accept the aforesaid contention. As per\n\nrespondents, the services were not extended but the applicant was re-\n\nappointed. The letters of appointment are also filed in the record. It\n\nappears from the aforesaid letters that: -\n\n (i) by letter dated 13.02.2020, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020;\n\n (ii) by letter dated 16.05.2020, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 16.05.2020 to 12.08.2020;\n\n 5\n\n (iii) by letter dated 16.08.2020, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 17.08.2020 to 13.11.2020;\n\n (iv) by letter dated 17.11.2020, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 17.11.2020 to 13.02.2021;\n\n (v) by letter dated 16.02.2021, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 17.02.2021 to 16.05.2021;\n\n (vi) by letter dated 22.05.2021, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 24.05.2021 to 23.04.2022;\n\n (vii) by letter dated 26.04.2022, the appointment was granted\n w.e.f. 27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023;\n\n10. It appears from the last two letters dated 22.05.2021 and\n\n26.04.2022 that for a period of 23 months, the appointment was granted.\n\nBy first letter 11 months period was given and by second letter 12\n\nmonths period was given. Hence, the total period by both letters was 23\n\nmonths. Before the aforesaid period, there was no any appointment\n\nduring the period from 13.05.2020 to 15.05.2020, 13.08.2020 to\n\n16.08.2020, 14.11.2020 to 17.11.2020, 14.02.2021 to 16.02.2021 and\n\n17.05.2021 to 23.05.2021. Therefore, the contention of the respondents\n\nappears to be correct. The services of applicant were not extended but at\n\nevery time, fresh contractual appointment was given after some gap.\n\n11. \nIn the case of \nDr. A.K. Jain &Ors. Vs. Union of India\n\n&Ors.\n[24/09/1987] 1988 SCR (1) 335 = 1987 SCC Supl. 497 = JT\n\n1987 (4) 445 = 1987 SCALE (2)1002, doctors were appointed on ad\n\nhoc basis. Looking to the peculiar facts and circumstances of cases the\n\nSupreme Court said that no ad hoc Medical officer shall be replaced\n\nby any newly appointed Medical officer on ad hoc basis. The Court\n\nobserved and passed the following order:-\n\n 1. The services of all doctors appointed either, as Assistant\n Medical officers or as Assistant Divisional Medical officer on ad hoc basis\n upto01.10.1984 shall be regularised in consultation with the Union Public\n Service Commission on the evaluation of their work and conduct on the\n\n 6\n\nbasis of their confidential reports in respect of the period subsequent to\n01.10.1982. Such evaluation shall be done by the Union Public Service\nCommission. The doctors so regularised shall be appointed as Assistant\nDivisional Medical officers with effect from the date from which they have\nbeen continuously working as Assistant Medical officer/Assistant Divisional\nMedical officer. The Railway shall be at liberty to terminate the services of\nthose who are not so regularised. If the services of any of the petitioners\nappointed prior to 01.10.84 have been terminated except on resignation\nor on disciplinary grounds, he shall be also considered for regularisation\nand if found fit his services shall be regularised as if there was no break in\nthe continuity of service but without any back wages.\n\n2. The Petitions of the Assistant Medical officer/Assistant\nDivisional Medical officers appointed subsequent to 01.10.1984 are\ndismissed. But we however direct that the Assistant Divisional Medical\nofficers who may have been now selected by the Union Public Service\nCommission shall first be posted to the vacant posts available wherever\nthey may be. If all those selected by the U.P.S.C. cannot be\naccommodated against the available vacant posts they may be posted to\nthe posts now held by the doctors appointed on ad hoc basis subsequent\nto 01.10.1984 and on such posting the doctor holding the post on ad hoc\nbasis shall vacate the same. While making such postings the principle of\n'last come, first go' shall be observed by the Railways on Zonal basis. If\nany doctor who is displaced pursuant to the above direction is willing to\nserve in any other Zone where there is a vacancy he may be\naccommodated on ad hoc basis in such vacancy.\n\n3. All Assistant Medical officers/Assistant Divisional Medical\nofficers working on ad hoc basis shall be paid the same salary and\nallowances as Assistant Divisional Medical officers on the revised scale\nwith effect from 1.1.1986. The arrears shall be paid within four months.\n\n4. No ad hoc Assistant Medical officer/Assistant Divisional Medical\nofficer who may be working in the Railways shall be replaced by any newly\nappointed AMO/AMO on ad hoc basis. Whenever there is need for the\nappointment of any AMO/ADMO on ad hoc basis is any Zone the existing\nad hoc AMO/ADMOs who are likely to be replaced by regularly appointed\ncandidates shall be given preference.\n\n5. If the ad hoc doctors appointed after 01.10.1984 apply for\nselection by the Union Public Service Commission the Union of India and\nthe Railways Department shall grant relaxation in age, to the extent of the\nperiod of service rendered by them as ad hoc doctors in the Railways.\n\n 7\n\n12. Three Judges Bench of Supreme Court \ninState of Haryana\n\n&Ors. Vs. Piara Singh &Ors.\n [12.08.1992] 1992 AIR 2130 = 1992\n\nSCR (3) 826 = 1992 SCC (4) 118 = JT 1992 (5)179 = 1992\n\nSCALE (2)384, considered the issue of regularisation of ad-hoc/\n\ntemporary employees in government service and said that the normal\n\nrule, of course, is regular recruitment through the prescribed agency but\n\nexigencies of administration may sometimes call for an adhoc or\n\ntemporary appointment to be made. In such a situation, effort should\n\nalways be to replace such an adhoc /temporary employee by a regularly\n\nselected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary employee may\n\nalso compete along with others for such regular selection/appointment. If\n\nhe gets selected, well and good, but if he does not, he must give way to\n\nthe regularly selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\n\nselected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake of\n\nsuch an adhoc / temporary employee. The Court said:-\n\n \"Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by\n another adhoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced only by a\n regularly selected employee. This is necessary to avoid arbitrary action on\n the part of the appointing authority.\"\n\nVarious direction / Suggestions were given in the aforesaid case:-\n\n \"Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is necessitated\n on account of the exigencies of administration, he should ordinarily be\n drawn from the employment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in\n which case the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate\n is available or is not sponsored by the employment exchange, some\n appropriate method consistent with the requirements of \nArticle 16\n should\n be followed. In other words, there must be a notice published in the\n appropriate manner calling for applications and all those who apply in\n response thereto should be considered fairly.\n\n An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when qualified\n persons are not available through the above processes.\n\n If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is continued for\n a fairly long spell, the authorities must consider his case for regularisation\n provided he is eligible and qualified according to rules and his service\n record is satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the\n reservation policy of the State.\n\n The proper course would be that each States prepares a scheme, if\n one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of such employees\n\n 8\n\nconsistent with its reservation policy and if a scheme is already framed,\nthe same way be made consistent with our observations herein so as to\nreduce avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person is\nregularised he should be placed immediately below the last regularly\nappointed employee in that category, class or service, as the case may\nbe.\n\n So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour are\nconcerned, the effort must be to regularise them as far as possible and as\nearly as possible subject to their fulfilling the qualifications, if any,\nprescribed for the post and subject also to availability of work. If a casual\nlabourer is continued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years - a\npresumption may arise that there is regular need for his services. In such\na situation, it becomes obligatory for the concerned authority to examine\nthe feasibility of his regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought\nto adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the person. As\nhas been repeatedly stressed by this court, security of tenure is necessary\nfor an employee to give his best to the job. In this behalf, we do\ncommend the orders of the Government of Haryana (contained in its letter\ndated 6.4.90 referred to hereinbefore) both in relation to work-charged\nemployees as well as casual labour.\n\n We must also say that the orders issued by the Governments of\nPunjab and Haryana providing for regularisation of adhoc/temporary\nemployees who have put in two years/one year of service are quite\ngenerous and leave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.\n\n These are but a few observations which we thought it necessary to\nmake, impelled by the facts of this case, and the spate of litigation by\nsuch employees. They are not exhaustive nor can they be understood as\nimmutable. Each Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or\nprinciples for regularisation having regard to all the relevant\ncircumstances, but while doing so, it should bear in mind the observations\nmade herein.\n\n26. So far as the employees and workmen employed by\nStatutory/Public Corporations are concerned, it may be noted that they\nhave not issued any orders akin to those issued by the Punjab and\nHaryana Government. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt as far\nas possible, keeping the exigencies and requirements of their\nadministration in view, the criteria and principles underlying the orders\nissued by their Government in the matter of regularisation and pass\nappropriate orders. \nIn short, the Statutory/Public Corporations in Haryana\nwill follow the orders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990 \nreferred to\nabove\n, as supplemented by the orders in the Notification dated 28.2.1991,\nwhere as the Statutory / Public Corporations in Punjab shall follow the\ncriteria and principles stated in the affidavit of Sri G.K. Bansal, Under\nSecretary to the Government of Punjab, Department of Personnel referred\nto in para 22 above. These directions shall not, however, apply to these\n\n 9\n\n Statutory/Public Corporations functioning within these States as are under\n the control of the Government of India. These Corporations will do well to\n evolve an appropriate policy of regularisation, in the light of this\n judgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make their existing\n policy consistent with this judgment to avoid litigation.\"\n\n13. Recently in Manish Gupta & Anr. Etc. Vs. President, Jan\n\nBhagidari Samiti & Ors. Etc.[C.A.Nos.3084­3088 of 2022, Arising\n\nout of SLP (Civil) No. 12946­12950 of 2017] [decided by SC on\n\n21.04.2022] the Supreme court also said that an ad-hoc employee\n\ncannot be replaced by another ad-hoc employee and he can be replaced\n\nonly by another candidate who is regularly appointed by following a\n\nregular procedure prescribed. In the aforesaid case an advertisement\n\ncame to be issued in the year 2014 for appointment of teachers as\n\nguest faculty for the Academic Year 2014­2015 in different Colleges. The\n\nwrit petitioners having requisite qualifications, applied to the advertised\n\npositions in pursuance to the said advertisement. Upon their selection by\n\nthe duly constituted Committee, they were appointed. After the end of\n\nthe Academic year, the writ petitioners were discontinued from\n\nservice. Fresh advertisements were issued for the next Academic Year\n\n2015­ 2016. Being aggrieved thereby, the writ petitioners approached the\n\nHigh Court and the learned single judge of the High Court of M.P. vide\n\njudgment and order dated 29th September, 2016,allowed the writ\n\ndirecting that the writ petitioners therein would continue to work on\n\ntheir respective posts till regular selections were made. It was also\n\ndirected that the writ petitioners therein were entitled to get the salary in\n\naccordance with the UGC circular issued in February, 2010. But the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court by order dated 8th February, 2017,\n\nallowed the writ appeals and set aside the judgment and order passed by\n\nthe learned single judge of the High Court. The Supreme Court set aside\n\nthe Order of Division Bench and confirmed the order of Single Judge with\n\nsome modification. The Court said: -\n\n 10\n\n\"12. A perusal of the advertisement dated 24th June, 2016 issued by\nthe Principal, Government Kamla Raja Girls Post Graduate Autonomous\nCollege, Gwalior, which is at Annexure P­2 of the Appeal Paper Book and\nthe advertisement dated 2nd July, 2016 issued by the Principal, SMS\nGovernment Model Science College, Gwalior, M.P., which is at Annexure\nP­3 of the Appeal Paper Book, would show that the appointments were to\nbe made after the candidates had gone through due selection procedure.\nThough Shri Nataraj, learned ASG has strenuously urged that the\nappointments of the appellants were as guest lecturers and not as ad hoc\nemployees, from the nature of the advertisements, it could clearly be seen\nthat the appellants were appointed on ad hoc basis. It is a settled\nprinciple of law that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by\nanother ad hoc employee and he can be replaced only by another\ncandidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular\nprocedure prescribed. Reliance in this respect can be placed on the\njudgment of this Court in the case of \nRattan Lal and others vs. State of\nHaryana and others\n, (1985) 4 SCC 43 and on the order of this Court in\nthe case of Hargurpratap Singh vs. State of Punjab and others,\n(2007) 13 SCC 292.\n\n13. In that view of the matter, we do not find that an error was\ncommitted by the learned single judge of the High Court by directing the\nwrit petitioners to continue to work on their respective posts till regular\nselections are made. We, however, find that the direction issued by the\nlearned single judge of the High Court that the writ petitioners would\nbe entitled to get the salary in accordance with the UGC circular is\nnot sustainable. The advertisements themselves clearly provided that\nthe selected candidates would be paid the honorarium to be determined\nby the said Committee.\"\n\n14. We are informed at the Bar that the appellants are being paid on a\nper hour basis, i.e., at the rate of Rs.1,000/­ per hour and they are\ncontinuing to work in pursuance of the order of status quo passed by this\nCourt on 28th April, 2017. We also find substance with the submission\nmade on behalf of the respondent - State that continuation of the\nappellants would depend on the number of students offering themselves\nfor the concerned courses.\n\n15................\n\n16. Accordingly, we pass the following order:\n\n A. The appeals are partly allowed.\n B. The impugned judgment and order dated 8th February,\n\n 2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya\n Pradesh, Gwalior Bench in Writ Appeal No.386 of 2016 along with\n companion matters is quashed and set aside;\n\n 11\n\n C. The judgment and order dated 29th September, 2016 passed by\n learned single judge of the High Court is modified as under:\n\n (i) The writ petitioners ­ appellants herein would be entitled to\n continue on their respective posts till they are replaced by regularly\n selected candidates;\n\n (ii) The writ petitioners ­ appellants herein would be continued on\n their respective posts provided that a sufficient number of students\n are available for the particular course(s) for which the writ\n petitioners -appellants herein are appointed.\n\n (iii) The writ petitioners - appellants herein would be entitled to\n honorarium at the rate of Rs.1,000/­ per hour as is being paid to\n them presently.\n\n14. It appears from the record that the appointment was given due to\n\nCovid 19 restrictions. On relaxation of Covid 19 restrictions, the\n\nprovisions of Central Organization ECHS letter No. B-\n\n49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated 22.12.2017 was followed for selection/\n\nappointment for the post of Dental Officer at ECHS, Gazipur. The\n\napplicant was selected by the Board of Officers and appointed by the\n\nStation Commander, Varanasi initially for the period of 11 months w.e.f.\n\n24.05.2021 to 23.04.2023 and the extension was granted from\n\n27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023. Therefore, the regular recruitment process\n\nwas not followed because of situation arisen due to Covid 19 and the\n\napplicant was appointed by passing the due procedure.\n\n15. It is also appear from the record that the notification for\n\nemployment was issued on 12.01.2023. The copy of aforesaid\n\nnotification is also enclosed at page 47 of the O.A. In the aforesaid\n\nnotification, the post of applicant was also advertised. Thereafter, the\n\napplicant himself applied for the aforesaid post. In compliance with the\n\naforesaid notification 12.01.2023, an interview for the post of Dental\n\nOfficer was conducted on 10.03.2023 and the result was declared on\n\n03.04.2023. The copy of result has been filed along with the fourth\n\nsupplementary affidavit dated 01.05.2023. It appears that the\n\nrespondent No. 5 has been selected for the aforesaid post and the\n\napplicant gets the status of reserved No. 2. It means that the name of\n\n 12\n\napplicant is in the waiting list at serial No. 2. Therefore, it is also appear\n\nthat the applicant himself participated in the aforesaid selection. When\n\nthe notification was issued, the applicant did not challenge the aforesaid\n\naction of the respondents. The applicant himself applied and participated\n\nin the selection procedure. When the applicant was not selected then, he\n\nis stopped to challenge the selection procedure and he cannot challenge\n\nthe appointment of respondent No. 5.\n\n16. The case of \nPradeep Kumar Rai and Ors. Vs. Dinesh Kumar\n\nPandey and Ors.\n, 2015 (11) SCC 493 [C.A. No.6549 of 2014] [D-\n\n11.05.2015] was related to the promotion of Constables and Head\n\nConstables to the rank of Sub-Inspectors in the State of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe process of promotion started way back in 1999 and the candidates\n\nappearing for promotion from the rank of Constable or Head Constable to\n\nthe rank of Sub-Inspector have challenged the selection and promotion\n\nprocess at various stages of the promotion process. The court observed\n\nthat after participating and unsuccessful in the examination, the candidate\n\ncannot be allowed to challenge the examination: -\n\n \n\"16. Moreover, we would concur with the Division Bench on one more\n point that the appellants had participated in the process of interview and\n not challenged it till the results were declared. There was a gap of almost\n four months between the interview and declaration of result. However, the\n appellants did not challenge it at that time. Thus, it appears that only\n when the appellants found themselves to be unsuccessful, they challenged\n the interview.This cannot be allowed. The candidates cannot approbate\n and reprobate at the same time. Either the candidates should not have\n participated in the interview and challenged the procedure or they should\n have challenged immediately after the interviews were conducted. (See\n Vijendra Kumar Verma Vs. Public Service Commission, Uttarakhand and\n Ors., (\n2011) 1 SCC 150, and K.H. Siraz Vs. High\n Court of Kerala and Ors.\n (2006) 6 SCC 395)\"\n\n17. \nIn \nAshok Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, C.A. No.\n 9092 of 2012\n\ndecided on 21.10.2016, three judges bench of Supreme Court said\n\nthat candidates who have taken part in a selection process knowing fully\n\nwell the procedure laid down therein are not entitled to question it upon\n\n 13\n\nbeing declared to be unsuccessful. It was not open to the appellants after\n\nparticipating in the selection process to question the result, once they\n\nwere declared to be unsuccessful.\n \nThe court refer the cases \nChandra\n\nPrakash Tiwari v. Shakuntala Shukla\n, (\n2002) 6 SCC 127, Union of\n\nIndia v. S. Vinodh Kumar\n, (2007) 8 SCC 100, Manish Kumar Shah\n\nv. State of Bihar, (2010) 12 SCC 576, Vijendra Kumar Verma v.\n\nPublic Service Commission, (\n2011) 1 SCC 150, Ramesh Chandra\n\nShah v. Anil Joshi\n, (\n2013) 11 SCC 309, Chandigarh Administration\n\nv. Jasmine Kaur\n, (\n2014) 10 SCC 521, Pradeep Kumar Rai v. Dinesh\n\nKumar Pandey\n, (2015) 11 SCC 493, Madras Institute of\n\nDevelopment v. S.K. Shiva Subaramanyam, (\n2016) 1 SCC 454,\n\nAmlan Jyoti Borrooah v. State of Assam\n, (2009) 3 SCC 227 and\n\nsaid:-\n\n \"11. The appellants participated in the fresh process of selection. If the\n appellants were aggrieved by the decision to hold a fresh process, they\n did not espouse their remedy. Instead, they participated in the fresh\n process of selection and it was only upon being unsuccessful that they\n challenged the result in the writ petition. This was clearly not open to the\n appellants. The principle of estoppel would operate.\"\n\n18. In Madan Lal (Madan Lal and Others v. State of J & K and\n\nothers, (1995) 3 SCC 486,), it was held that if a candidate takes a\n\ncalculated chance and appears at the interview then only because the\n\nresult of the interview is not palatable to him he cannot turn around and\n\nsubsequently contend that the process of interview was unfair and the\n\nselection committee was not properly constituted.\n\n19. Therefore, it appears from the entire record that the applicant\n\nhaving no any authority to challenge the aforesaid selection in which he\n\nwas also participated and the respondent No. 5 was selected. Hence,\n\nthe O.A. having no any force is dismissed.\n\n (Mohan Pyare) (Justice B.K. Shrivastava)\n Member (Admn.) Member (Judicial)\n\n/M.M./",
