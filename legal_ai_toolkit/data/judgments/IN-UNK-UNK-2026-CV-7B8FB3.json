Any other relief/reliefs as the applicant is entitled and\n your Lordships may deem fit and proper in the ends of\n justice.\"\n\n FACTS IN BRIEF\n\n 3. Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA\n\n are that her husband Shri Amardeo Prasad was employed in RMS NB\n\n Division Samastipur, employe as Casual Labour on 25.11.1982 after\n\n being empanelled on being sponsored by employment exchange. He was\n\n conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.2001 vide Office Order dated\n\n 14.02.2001 (Annexure A/2) and extended all benefits of a temporary\n\n status employee vide the said order. Having continuously worked for\n\n three years on the post from 01.01.2001, he became entitled for grant\n\n 3 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n temporary status at par with Group 'D' w.e.f. 01.01.2004 as per the\n\n departmental rules.\n\n 4. Vide Memo dated 17.03.2016 (Annexure A-3) issued by\n\n Superintendent, RMS 'NB' Division, Samastipur, husband of the\n\n applicant being selected in pursuance to recommendation of DPC held on\n\n 14.03.2014, was ordered his appointment vide Order dated 17.03.2016\n\n (Annexure A-3) in MTS cadre in Pay Band of Rs.5200-20200 (PB-1) with\n\n GP of Rs.1800/-. Unfortunately, after only three days of issuance of\n\n Annexure A-3, husband of applicant died on 20.03.2016 and as such\nPatna\nBench\n could not join the post of MTS.\n\n 5. Applicant approached the respondent authorities for grant of family\n\n pension as well as retiral/death benefits, i.e, DCRG, GPF, Leave\n\n Encashment, Compulsory Insurance etc. but the department issued\n\n impugned order dated 11.11.2019 (AnnexureA-1) denying the claim on\n\n the ground that her husband was not a regular employee, died before\n\n joining MTS post, hence, no benefits would be allowed to her. The act on\n\n part of the respondents is wholly unjustified and against all settled norms.\n\n Upon death of husband of the applicant, his entire family has now been\n\n left to starve.\n\n 6. It is the case of the applicant that the action of the respondents is\n\n violative of the statutory rules containing benefits for temporary\n\n employees as well as against the settled norms. Conditions of service of\n\n temporary employees of the Central Government are regulated under the\n\n provisions of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965\n\n 4 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n and under the same rules, the husband of applicant, who has completed\n\n more than ten years of service, is entitled to receive family pension as\n\n well as other retiral dues of her husband.\n\n 7. Moreover, the respondents ignored various judicial orders in\n\n identical matters decided by this Tribunal in OA No.113/2020 after being\n\n upheld in CWJC No.4475 of 2007 and implemented the same. Thereafter,\n\n other identical matters have been decided by this Tribunal but the genuine\n\n claim of applicant has been denied erroneously. Aggrieved, applicant\n\n earlier filed OA No.92/2017, which was decided on 15.04.2019 with a\nPatna\nBench\n direction to the respondents to pass appropriate reasoned and speaking\n\n orders taking into consideration the judgments of Hon'ble High Court of\n\n Patna, Tribunal and their own circular dated 15.05.1991, within a period\n\n of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order.\n\n 8. Instead of allowing the genuine and valid claim of applicant in true\n\n letter and spirit, respondents rejected the same erroneously vide impugned\n\n order dated 11.11.2019 containing undated speaking order as contained in\n\n Annexure A-1. Hence, the present OA has been filed by the applicant\n\n seeking the reliefs mentioned above.\n\n 9. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have\n\n filed written statement briefly stating that Sri Amardeo Prasad was\n\n engaged as casual labour w.e.f. 25.11.1982 on being sponsored through\n\n employment exchange and was deployed at SRO Katihar under RMS NB\n\n Division, Samastipur later on his place of work was changed to SRO\n\n Barauni. He was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.2001 vide order\n\n 5 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n dated 14.02.2021 and he was being paid all the benefits of Temporary\n\n status employees.\n\n 10. It is further stated in the WS that in pursuance of recommendation\n\n of DPC held on 14.03.2016, husband of applicant was selected for\n\n appointment as MTS in PB-1 Rs.5200-20200 with GP of Rs.1800/- under\n\n 6th \nCPC\n vide order dated 17.03.2016 but he could not join the post of\n\n MTS as he died on 20.03.2016. Since the husband of the applicant was\n\n not a regular employee of the respondents, applicant could not be granted\n\n family pension and other retiral dues.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n 11. Being dissatisfied with non-granting of payment of family pension\n\n as well as other reitral dues, applicant filed OA No.92/2017 which was\n\n decided on 15.04.2019 with direction to respondent authorities to pass\n\n appropriate reasoned and speaking order taking into consideration\n\n judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Patna, Tribunal and department's own\n\n circular dated 15.05.1991. In compliance whereof, respondents passed\n\n impugned order dated 11.11.2019. The said order has been impugned by\n\n the applicant in the present OA.\n\n SUBMISSIONS\n\n 12. Shri J.K. Karn, learned counsel for applicant contended that:-\n\n (i) Applicant's husband after grant of temporary status w.e.f.\n\n 01.01.2001, worked for three years and as per scheme, related to\n casual labour (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization)\n Scheme, Para 5 of the scheme, entitled for such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employee on regular basis w.e.f.\n 01.01.2004.

The Hon'ble High\n Court, Patna in CWJC No.14115/2013 Union of India vs. Shiv\n Chandra Sah, upheld order dated 21.02.2022, in OA\n No.145/2019 of this Tribunal, vide judgment dated 22.08.2024.\n The issue is no more re-integra. \nCovered by ratio laid down in\n case of \nMeena Devi\n (supra).\n\n (iii) Applicant's husband is entitled for pension and other benefits in\n light of Rules 1965 and also read with, explanation (6) provided,\n appended to Rule 2, applicability Clause of the CCS (Pension)\n Rules, 2021 to the extent these rule shall also apply to the case of\n government servants appointed in temporary capacity who retired\n before appointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under\n these rules shall be payable to Govt. servant to extent provided in\n Rules, 1965.\n\n (iv) Applicant's husband and present case is also covered by\n Schemes, Rules 1965 and read with CCS (Pension) Rules and\n entitled for pension and retiral benefits.\n\n (v) Husband of the applicant is entitled to reckon qualifying services\n for pension purposes for casual worker after obtaining temporary\n status 50% of his services till regularization casual worker before\n\n 7 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n obtaining temporary status is also entitled to reckon 50% of\n casual service and casual worker appointed any post either\n substantively or officiating entitled to reckon entire period.\n\n \n(vi) Applicant's husband is entitled for reckoning, services of her\n husband for purposes of pension as held by this Tribunal in\n identical-pari-mereria rules in case Mojib Ansari versus Union\n of India, OA No. 265/2021 decided on 29.05.2023 and in para-\n materia provision in case of \nUnion of India vs. Rakesh Kumar\n\n (2017) 13 SCC 388 by Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n (vii) Applicant cannot be made to suffer merely stating that husband of\n the applicant promoted/appointed on 17.03.2016 and died on\n 20.03.2016 and same cannot be treated that husband declined to\n take charge of regular post. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in case\nPatna\nBench of U.O.I. & Ors. Vs. Ratneshwar Singh in CWJC No. 13117 of\n 2019, vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 held that offer made by\n respondents employer to applicant to promote him and then treat\n as regularized was not accepted by applicant for personal reason,\n but cannot construe to mean that he had declined regularization\n on post he was occupying and upheld order of this Tribunal.\n\n 13. Shri G.S. Prasad, learned C.G.S.C. appearing for respondents submitted\n that :\n\n (i) Applicant engaged as Contingency Paid Casual Labour on\n 25.11.1982 and continued with Temporary Status w.e.f.\n\n 01.01.2001 but at time of promotion/absorption on 17.03.2016 as\n MTS as sanctioned regular Group 'D' post husband of the\n applicant could not take charge of the regular post died on\n 20.03.2016 and no one has control over his death hence benefits\n cannot be denied to widow - the present applicant.\n\n (ii) Applicant's husband is not entitled to reckon qualifying services\n for pensionary purposes being at par with Group 'D' employee\n and not entitled under CCS (Pension) Rules and Rules 1965 for\n temporary employees for grant of pension because deceased\n employee was promoted vide Order dated 17.03.2016 and did not\n take charge died on 20.03.2016.\n\n 8 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n THE ISSUE\n\n 14.

But husband of the applicant could not join as he\n died in harness on 20.03.2016. The core issue arises before this Tribunal for\n determination is:-\n\n \"Whether deceased employee - husband of the applicant, who was\n appointed as Casual Labour on 25.11.1982 and conferred temporary status\n w.e.f. 01.01.2001, selected and appointed on the post of MTS cadre in PB-I\nPatna Rs.5200-20,200/- GP Rs.1800/- and died on 20.03.2016 after more than 32\nBench\n years service and his legal heir-Smt. Indrawati Devi - widow, the applicant\n is legally entitled for benefit of pension or family pension or not?\"\n\n ANALYSIS\n\n 15. Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar. It is\n apposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme, policy of\n Union of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department of Posts, The\n Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965, the Central Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents in similar cases,\n in cases of pari-materia provisions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble\n High Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and Benches of the Central\n Administrative Tribunal as under:-.\n\n RULE OF LAW\n (A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization\n Scheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated 12.04.1991 drawn in\n compliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and approved by his Excellency\n President of India relevant portion is reproduced as under for appreciation of the\n Core issue involved in the present OA:-\n\n Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation)\n Scheme : In compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court a scheme was drawn up by this Department in consultation with the\n Ministries of Law, Finance and Personnel and the President has been\n pleased to approve the said scheme. The scheme is as follows :-\n\n 1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers in\n employment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be currently\n employed and have rendered continuous service of at least one\n year during the year during the year they must have been engaged\n for a period of 240 days (206 days in the case of offices observing\n five days week).\n\n 2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8 hours\n including ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate on the\n\n 9 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n basis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular Group 'D'\n official including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n 3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\n employee would be taken into account for calculating per month\n rate wages after completion of one year of service from the date\n of conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken\n into account after every one year of service subject to\n performance of duty for at least 240 days (206 days in\n establishments observing five days week) in the year.\n\n 4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\n Casual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity leave,\n will not be admissible. No encashment of leave is permissible on\n termination of services for any reason or on the casual labourers\n quitting service.\n\n 5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\n allowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n 6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would be\n counted for the purpose of retirement benefits after regularization\n as a regular Group 'D'. official.\n\n 7. Conferment of Temporary Status does not automatically imply\n that the casual labourers would be appointed as a regular Group\n 'D' employees within any fixed time frame. Appointment in\nPatna\n Group 'D' vacancies will continue to be done as per the extant\nBench Recruitment Rules, which stipulate preference to eligible ED\n employee.\n\n 8. After rendering three years' continuous service after\n conferment of temporary status the casual labourers would be\n treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees for the\n purposes of contribution to General Provident Fund. They\n would also further be eligible for the grant of Festival\n Advance, Flood Advance on the same conditions as are\n applicable to temporary Group 'D' employee provided they\n furnish two sureties from permanent Government servants of\n this Department.\n\n 9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue to\n be at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n 10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service of\n the casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n 11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct and the\n same is proved in an enquiry after giving him reasonable\n opportunity his services will be dispensed with.\n\n 12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than recruiting\n units also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n 13. For purpose of appointment as a regular Group 'd' official the\n casual labourers will be allowed age relaxation to the extent of\n service rendered by them as casual labourers.\n\n 14. The casual labourers can be deployed any where within the\n recruitment unit /territorial circle on the basis of availability of\n work.\n\n 15. The engagement of the casual labourers will continue to be on\n daily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n 16. The conferment of temporary status has no relation to availability\n of sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts.\n\n 17. No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\n compassionate appointment will be done till casual labourers\n with the requisite qualification are available to fill up the posts in\n question.\n\n Further action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each unit\n as per the above said scheme.

According to him to earn pension it was\n necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\n It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\n in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\n benefits.\n\n There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the Government for\nPatna 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied\nBench\n the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a\n permanent employee of the government. The appellant having\n served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to\n treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we\n hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent\n after he served the Government for such a long period.

Their Lordships decided in favour of temporary status\n employee at par with Group 'D' employee and upheld order dated\n 22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna).

The Hon'ble High\n Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such\n lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The\n Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family\n Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased\n employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary\n capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary\n employee.\n\n The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of\n family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by\n notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for\n a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.\n\n 17. In the other similar and identical situation, The Central Administrative\n Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of original applicants on\n similar facts and legal issue as involved in the present OA in hand and some of\n them are cited as under:-\n\n \n(a)(i) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A.

The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of\n order relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n case of \nPrem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n reported in\n (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-\n\n \"35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in\n spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas\n they have been superannuated.

This Court in the said decision has laid down that\n in case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the\n cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be\n regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees\n who have worked for ten years or more should have been regularized. It\n would not be proper to regulate them for consideration of regularisation\n as others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated as\n a regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to\n claiming any dues of difference in wages had they been continued in\n service regularly before attaining the age of superannuation.

In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P.

The arrears of pension shall be confined to three\n years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid\n accordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the\n employees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n(ii) Hon'ble High Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 in \nUnion of India &\n Ors. vs. Awadhesh Prasad Singh\n (arising out of order dated 02.08.2021 in \nOA\n No.050/00143/2018 Awadhesh Prasad Singh vs. Union of India & Ors.\n). Their\n Lordships vide order dated 08.04.2024, heard the matter at length and observed that\n no prima facie case made out. Thereafter vide order dated 20.06.2024 upheld order\n dated 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018.

The learned Tribunal dealt issue \"whether the person\n who has not been regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2)\n of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal\n has considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension\n Rules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family\n Pension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954. \nSo also held that case is covered\n by judgement in case of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India & ors\n 2017 (2)\n SCT (P&H) (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.\n \nSo also\n case of \nSr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram\n in CWP.\n\nNo.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of Himachal\n Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement passed by Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd) and others vs\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr\n etc, 1990 supp. SC 113.\n \nSo also\n observed that case is fully covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh in matter of \nUnion of India vs Meena Devi\n in CWP No.\n 34 of 2014 decided on 23.7.2018.\n\n 17 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 18. In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue \"Whether deceased\n employee - husband of the applicant, who was appointed as Casual Labour on\n 25.11.1982 and conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.2001, selected and\n appointed on the post of MTS cadre in PB-I Rs.5200-20,200/- GP Rs.1800/-\n and died on 20.03.2016 after more than 32 years service and his legal heir-Smt.\n Indrawati Devi - widow, the applicant is legally entitled for benefit of pension\n or family pension or not?\"\n\n 19. The applicant's husband was initially engaged on 25.11.1982 as Casual\n Labourer through employment exchange. The department of posts vide\n instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily wagers working in post\n offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The department of posts has made\n Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and\nPatna\nBench\n Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989. The scheme provided\n provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual labourers. So also the\n scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D' regular employee available\n on conferment of status of temporary employee.\n\n \n20. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that\n substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same\n emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n \"temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal\n department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240\n days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal\n employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly\n with regular employees in the department\".\n\n \n21. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-\n\n \"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the\n casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of\n the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 22. \nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of\n India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\n\n 18 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been\n drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and\n Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously\n pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers\n working continuously for long period.\n\n 23. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and\n beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits\n to long continuous working of casual labourers.\n\n 24. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual\n labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. Husband of the applicant is\n appointee of year 1982. The respondents after more than 32 years of service of\n\nPatna\n husband of present applicant vide Order dated 17.03.2016 (Annexure A-3)\nBench\n selected and appointed in MTS cadre in Pay Band-I GP Rs.1800/- and posted at\n SRO, RMS, NB Div. Barauni but could not take charge of the said post died on\n 20.03.2016 in harness. Applicant - widow of deceased employee cannot be\n made to suffer violating \nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and \n300\n of the Constitution of\n India.\n\n 25. Husband of the applicant-deceased employee has been conferred\n temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.2001 pursuant to order dated 14.02.2001\n (Annexure A-2) and the statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years\n w.e.f. 01.01.2004 certain advantages to temporary employee as provided in para\n 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay scale for a regular group'D' official\n including DA, HRA and CCA. Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the\n same rate as applicable to a Group 'D' employee after completion of one year\n of service from date of conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule\n 27 stipulates grant of increment to a government servant on same scale of pay.\n The legislative intent is clear as noon day in formulating the statutory scheme\n dated 12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to\n enforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve\n social justice. The Central Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the\n Directive Principles of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the\n Constitution of India treating temporary status casual labour after long period\n at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department granting benefits\n and treating at par with and entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the\n\n 19 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n Group 'D' employee on regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave\n Encashment, Maternity Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of\n service under temporary status for retirement benefits after regularization as a\n regular Group 'D' on absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social\n beneficial legislation with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the\n scheme specifically provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after\n rendering three years continuous service as temporary status.\n\n 26. Husband of the applicant was conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n 01.01.2001 (Annexure A-2) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on\n principles of beneficial construction and harmoniously construing the scheme.\n The applicant after three years since 01.01.2001 meaning thereby since\n 01.01.2004 has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees and\nPatna\nBench\n regularly contributed to G.P.F. The husband of the applicant was in capacity of\n temporary employee. The deceased employee having continuously worked as\n temporary status casual labourer since 01.01.2001 and on 01.01.2004 is holder\n of post of temporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt\n fairly by the model employer state accordance with guarantee enshrined in the\n \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view\n whereof that it is unfair to continue the husband of the applicant such a long 32\n years in temporary post and considering for regularization vide order dated\n 17.03.2016 and died in harness on 20.03.2016.\n\n \n27. The applicant's husband acquired status of temporary employee Group\n 'D' of Department of Posts on 01.01.2004 and it is well settled in law that\n applicant-widow of deceased employee is entitled for such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis. So also held by Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra).\n\n 28. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no\n recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\n available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged\n statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the\n Constitution of India and applicant's husband was not regularized for 32 years\n as for no fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not\n discharge his duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents\n cannot take advantages and plea not joined on regular appointment not\n\n 20 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n available to them. Applicant's husband found fit for regular appointment in\n MTS cadre and appointed vide Office Order dated 17.03.2016 (Annexure A-3)\n but could not assume charge due to death on 20.03.2016. Applicant is legally\n entitled for all pensionary benefits.\n\n 29. This Tribunal considered sole arguments of respondents that admittedly\n deceased employee duly regularized on MTS cadre post and appointed on\n 17.03.2016 and could not assume charge and died on 20.03.2016 so applicant\n could not be granted pensionary benefits. This Tribunal is of the view since\n respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated\n 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 1982 and once\n regularized vide Order dated 17.03.2016 for 2015 vacancy. Hence respondents\n cannot take advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits\nPatna\nBench\n as deceased employee did not join on regular post before he died on\n 20.03.2016. The matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and\n policy applicable to applicant's husband, who worked since 1982 till\n 19.03.2016 almost more than thirty two (32) years in the department in\n Contingency Paid capacity and regularized as MTS on 17.03.2016.\n\n 30. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein\n above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated\n 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of\n casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status\n reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the employee in\n light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away by\n respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.\n Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of\n implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged\n in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are\n substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to\n employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and\n tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless\n regularized and joined on the post, no pensionary benefits, deserves to be\n rejected and applicant cannot be denied relief claimed.\n\n 31. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992\n quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\n\n 21 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly\n acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 01.01.2004 becomes entitled to\n benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of\n service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\n employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and\n retirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n 32. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\n regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\n Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\n gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as\n are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS\n Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension\nPatna\nBench\n and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2\n CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive\n appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Pension\n Rules 2021.\n\n 33. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\n extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\n temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So also the\n explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6) cases\n of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services and\n posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December, 2003,\n who retired or were retired before having been appointed in a substantive\n capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the government\n servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\n Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as admissible to any other\n public servant and respondents have violated fundamental right enshrined in\n \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of India.\n\n 34. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years\n service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992\n provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement\n benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed\n by regularization.\n\n 22 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 35. The husband of the applicant died in harness on 20.03.2016 as regular/\n temporary employee for no fault of own. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read\n with Pension Rules 1972 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of\n pension, family pension and retirement benefits to deceased employee. The\n status of husband of the applicant-deceased employee was at par with regular\n employee on long 33 years continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The\n Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 1972 and 2021 would\n prevail over any policy decision.\n\n 36. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it\n clear that husband of the applicant who died on 20.03.2016 having been\n appointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee on 17.03.2016\n\nPatna\n for 2015 vacancy for such type of category of temporary employee benefit of\nBench\n pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity, death gratuity and family\n pension shall be payable to applicant-the widow, same scale as admissible to\n permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent so also provided in\n the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation\n after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent\n service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\n continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n 37. This Tribunal has analyzed in details all aspects of case in hand, the\n relevant statutory schemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal\n considered the matter and in view of whereof of the firm view that Government\n of India, Department of Posts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no.\n 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are\n social legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and\n the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status in\n department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly acquired\n temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery\n benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules\n 1965 read with Pension Rules 1972 and 2021 is failure of social justice and\n social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is substantive\n\n 23 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n attempts to enhance social welfare and state as an ideal employer fulfilling the\n Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.\n\n \n38. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses\n and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant entitled to\n receive pension/family pension as if husband of the applicant retired from\n regular establishment and so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of\n judgment in case of \nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC\n 516 reproduced herein above.\n\n \n39. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\n case of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n 154 of 2019 decided\n on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in\n\nPatna\n O.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as Tribunal relied on\nBench\n ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against\n same.\n \nTheir Lordships in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) observed that\n judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none\n of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that\n there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'\n unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an\n employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be\n admissible.\n\n \n40. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the Division\n Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal issue dealt in\n detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors versus Meena Devi\n @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided on 08.12.2022,\n reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated 20.3.2013 in similar OA\n No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of family pension arrears as per Rule\n 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972 widow of employee died as\n temporary employee without being regularized.\n \nThis Tribunal has considered\n the submissions of the counsel for the parties and in judgment in case of\n \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) not applicable in case on hand and previous cases not\n referred to the larger bench perused the ratio \nlaid down by\n their Lordships in\n case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) decided on 08.12.2022. Their\n Lordships considering scheme for Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\n Status and Regularization) and held that husband of the applicant being\n\n 24 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n temporary employee governed by CCS TS Rules 1965 and as per Rule 10 of\n CCSTS Rule 1965 read with CCS Pension Rule Their Lordships in Para 10 of\n judgement directed reads as under :-\n\n \"10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary\n benefits for more than decade, therefore to calculate monetary benefits\n in the light of sub-rule 2 of 10 of Rules 1965 and the same shall be\n extended to the respondents within a period of three months from the\n date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a.\n from 01.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondents husband died on\n 15.11.1997 and in the light of Apex Court's decision in the case of Vijay\n L. Mehrotra v. State of U.P. (2001)9 SCC 687.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n41. Their Lordships in case of Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar , reported\n in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 considered impact effect of scheme dated 30.11.1992 of\n Postal Department and also considered Rule 10 of CCS TS Rules 1965 and\n applicability of CCS Pension Rules. After considering the proposition of law\nPatna\nBench\n precedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down. This Tribunal is bound by the\n precedent in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) principle of law laid\n down interpreting service rules applicable in the case. The present case is also\n covered by the above binding-ratio decedendi, precedent.\n \nThe preposition of\n law as laid down considering relevant service rules in \nMeena Devi @ Meena\n Kunwar\n (supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes binding precedent\n on this Tribunal and present case is also deserves same treatment.\n\n 42. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal\n issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial\n pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court\n of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and\n Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This\n Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered\n matter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and no more res-\n integra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential\n benefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of\n Constitution of India guaranteed to the applicant too.\n\n 43. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the\n Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual\n labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual\n Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal\n clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if\n\n 25 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by\n regularization. The applicant's husband granted temporary status w.e.f.\n 01.01.2001 and regularized by respondents on 17.03.2016 and died on\n 20.03.2016.\n\n 44. The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants are\n regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules 1965. As\n per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of pension, retirement\n gratuity and in the event of death after retirement, members of his family shall\n be eligible for the grant of family pension read with the provisions of Central\n Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021 (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation\n (6) provides appended to Rule 2 Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension\n Rules 2021 to the extend these rules shall also apply to the case of government\nPatna\nBench\n servant appointed in temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been\n appointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be\n payable to the government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil\n Services (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n 45. The Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021 (Erstwhile Rule\n 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule 75 of\n family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted that\n Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a regular\n employee. Whereas in case on hand husband of applicant was regularized on\n 17.03.2016 but died on 20.03.2016. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\n Yashwant Hari Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if\n retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was not a\n permanent employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years. So in present\n case cannot be denied relief on pretext of deceased employee could not join the\n regular post and hence cannot be treated as regular employee.\n\n 46. \nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA No.36 of 2021\n (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of employee with\n temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113, order of Principal Bench in OA\n No.1287 of 2000. This Tribunal held that applicant's husband served\n continuously as Temporary Status Casual Labour for almost 22 years and not\n been regularized for reasons best known to the employer.\n In O.A. No.143 of\n\n 26 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 2018, (CAT Bench Patna) Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India &\n Ors. (supra) upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024\n vide orders dated 20.06.2024 related to temporary status employee not\n regularized, allowed OA directing respondents to settle pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This Tribunal in case\n Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to\n process for issuance of Pension Payment Order. Order dated 17.01.2022 in OA\n No.36/2021, Rameshwari Devi case was challenged in CWJC No.7859 of\n 2022 and Hon'ble High Court, Patna, their Lordships on all arrears amount\n directed to pay interest at rate of 8% in light of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n decision in case of Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of UP, (2001) 9 SCC 687.\n\n 47. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of 2021 (CAT\nPatna\nBench\n Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee\n worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working\n as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal\n Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc. \nThis\n Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (\nMeena Devi vs.\n Union of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015\n (\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,\n Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.\n\n Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was\n whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -\n without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this\n Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as\n regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at\n par with Group 'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits\n with arrears.\n\n 48. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others\n\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -\n whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status\n at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other\n retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post\n and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as\n temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started\n employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred\n\n 27 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,\n family pension.\n This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered\n orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015\n upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on\n part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private\n respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par\n with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be\n appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978\n of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\n respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old\n pension scheme.\n\n 49. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that as per rules\nPatna\nBench\n for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on\n regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service\n after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On\n working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'\n employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not\n regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of\n respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise\n meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible\n for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order\n passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not\n regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant\n entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary\n Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on\n 03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service\n and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n Respondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled\n Shiv Charndra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.\n Shiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated\n 22.08.2024.\n\n 50. In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.\n No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue\n applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary\n\n 28 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at\n part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension\n denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on\n regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not\n issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right\n accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule\n 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. So also placed reliance in case OA\n No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of\n 2017 in Ratneshwar Singh (Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,\n allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other\n retiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and\n CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA\n No.372/2017.\n\nPatna\nBench\n\n 51. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India\n & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this\n Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships\n considered argument of respondents department that contention of department\n cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be\n construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying\n for more than 27 years.\n\n 52. The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by\n above precedents.\n\n 53. In case of Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India, OA No.143\n of 2018, decided on 28.10.2021 by Division Bench of this Tribunal, Seisin with\n issue to regularize services of Night Guard continuous since 13.01.1984 and\n Temporary Status conferred but not regularized and denied pension etc. This\n Tribunal vide order dated 28.10.2021 allowed OA to grant pension and all\n pensionary benefits treating his superannuation on 31.10.2019 date of\n retirement and directed for issuance of PPO within four months. \nHon'ble High\n Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 vide order dated 28.10.2024 affirmed\n order dated 20.10.2021 in \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra).\n\n 54. Respondents Department of Posts filed CWJC No.128 of 2024, Union of\n India & Ors. Versus Awadhesh Prasad Singh challenging order dated\n\n 29 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018 and Hon'ble High Court vide order dated\n 08.04.2024, heard at length and observed that prima-facie no case is made out,\n directed respondents to comply directions of the CAT as a last chance and\n affirmed order dated 28.10.2021 in the OA.\n\n \n55. This Tribunal in similar case titled \nNaina Devi versus Union of India\n and others\n, OA No.1109 of 2015 vide order dated 24.11.2023 allowed OA.\n Relevant paragraphs 39 to 48 for ready reference are reproduced as under:-\n\n 39. \nIn \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court\n held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½\n years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary\n benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent\n employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances\n appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the\n government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be\nPatna permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\nBench 40. \nIn Kritnarain Singh (Supra), \nSmt Ram Kali Devi\n (supra),\n \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble\n High Court Patna examined core issue involved in present OA and their\n Lordships upheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and\n law and observed that failure on part of postal department respondents\n not to regularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\n appreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\n pension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n 41. In Shri Painu Ram (supra) Division Bench of Hon'ble High\n Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla dealing with identical issue on\n similar facts upheld order dated 31.1.2014 passed by coordinate Bench\n Chandigarh of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013 (Chandigarh)\n granting relief to applicant held entitled for same benefits admissible to\n regular Group 'D' employees once applicant conferred temporary status\n and having three years service on temporary status without being\n regularised.\n\n 42. \nIn case of \nMrs. Alka Sharma\n (supra) Division Bench of\n Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana Their Lordships dealing\n with pari materia provision of Railway Services (Pension) Rule, Rule 75\n of family pension scheme for Railway Servants, 1964. The Hon'ble High\n Court considered that employee was not at fault for such lack of\n regularization and not regularized to deceased employee inspite 14 years\n temporary service and directed to grant family pension and other retiral\n benefits inspite of not regularized.\n\n 43. \nIn case of \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\n (supra), Division Bench of\n this Tribunal decided similar issue in light of same scheme of\n Department of Posts seeking pension and other pensioner benefits\n including regularization in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules and Government of India decisions, department\n of Posts. On examination of Government of India Department of Posts\n Policy dated 30.11.1992, Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\n Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 1972 held that Temporary\n employee of Central Government becomes entitled to pension, retirement\n gratuity, family pension benefits in cases of retirement from\n superannuation or invalidation after continuous temporary/quashi\n permanent service not less than 10 years, event of voluntary retirement\n after 20 years service and event of death in harness. The OA was allowed\n . Pension and all other benefits were granted treating his superannuation\n on 31.10.2019. The Hon'ble High Court Patna has upheld the order and\n\n 30 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n dismissed writ application. The present OA is no different fully covered\n issue no more integra and binding on the Tribunal.\n\n 44. In case of Santosh Kumari (supra) learned Coordinate Bench\n at Chandigarh of this Tribunal decided in October 2023 dealing with\n issue \"whether person who has not been regularized by respondents, the\n provision of Rule 54 (2) of the CCS Pension Rule 1972 for grant of\n family pension is attracted or not ?\" \nThe learnd Tribunal On examination\n of core legal issue has held that case is fully covered by judgement in\n similar cases of \nAlka Sharma vs Union of India\n, 2017 (2) SCT (P&H)\n (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana also squarely\n covered in case of postal department \nSr. Superintendent of Posts\n Offices vs Painu Ram\n in CWP No. 2299/2014 and Meena Devi in\n CWP No. 34 of 2014 passed by Hon'ble High Court Himachal\n Pradesh.\n\n Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and\n legal issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding\n judicial pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n and High Court of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble\n High Court Patna and Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present\n case is no different. This Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the\n case of applicant is a covered matter on facts and legal issue involved in\n the present case and no more res-integra. The applicant is also entitled for\nPatna\n the same treatment and consequential benefits envisaged in the\nBench Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of Constitution of India\n guaranteed to the applicant too..\n\n 45. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5\n of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to\n benefit to casual labourers on completion of three years service in\n temporary status of Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and\n regularization) Scheme is crystal clear that temporary employee is entitled\n to pension and retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of\n service in temporary status followed by regularization, The husband of\n applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been\n regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood\n retired on 30.6.2018 and died on 28.5.2022.\n\n The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants\n are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules\n 1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of\n pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,\n members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension\n read with the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule\n 2 Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these\n rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in\n temporary capacity who retired or were retired before been appointed in a\n substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the\n government servant to the extent provide in the Central Civil Services\n (Temporary Service ) Rules 1965.\n\n \nThe Rule 50-family Pension of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (Erstwhile Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia\n provision in Rule 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants\n 1964. It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides\n that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of \nYashwant Hari Kakkar\n (supra) has held that it would\n be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on\n ground that he was not a permanent employee not regularized after served\n for 18 ½ years.\n\n The legal issue in hand also qualified by judicial binding\n precedents pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana, Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their\n Lordships upheld judgements of this Tribunal in identical facts and legal\n issue binding precedents and present case is no different and core issue\n is no more res-integra.\n\n 31 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 46. For the above reasons, the issue accordingly decided in the\n favour of the applicant.\n\n 47. In consequences, the deceased employee is held entitled for the\n pension to be computed as per findings supra . The respondents are also\n directed to settle the family pension and other retiral benefits of the\n deceased employee and pay the arrears of pension and family pension\n from 28.5.2022 onwards with interest @ 8 percent per annum from the\n date of entitlement within three months failing which the interest shall be\n paid @ 9 percent per annum from the date of entitlement till final\n payment\n\n 48. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 56. The legal issue involved in the present case is also qualified by binding\n precedents cited herein above upheld by our own Hon'ble High Court Patna,\n their Lordships upheld orders passed by this Tribunal in identical facts, legal\n issue and binding precedents. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that\n present case is no different and core issue is involved is no more res-integra.\nPatna\nBench\n\n \n57. Hon'ble High Court Patna in case of \nUnion of India versus\n Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117\n of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019\n (Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - \"These\n letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept\n regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by\n petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted\n by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be\n construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was\n occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed\n in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in\n paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-\n petitioner.\" In view of law \nlaid down in\n similar facts and contention raised by\n respondents, Ho'ble High Court, Patna their Lordships repelled similar\n contention as raised in case on hand. Arguments of learned counsel for\n respondents has no force no document produced of promotion order and no\n application of refusal and repelled.\n\n \n58. Shri J.K. Karn, learned counsel for applicant much emphasized that\n husband of the applicant duly engaged through employment exchange on\n 25.11.1982, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.01.2001 and recommended for\n absorption in regular MTS cadre and appointed on 17.03.2016. In view of Rule\n 13 of Pension Rules, 1972 temporary service w.e.f. 01.01.2004 will reckon as\n\n 32 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n absorbed on 17.03.2016 in MTS regular cadre and entitled for pension/family\n pension as per Rule, 1972. So also placed heavy reliance on Order dated\n 06.10.2023 in \nOA No.050/00388/2019 Meena Devi vs. Union of India\n so far\n relates to reckoning services.\n\n 59. So far as present case in hand is concerned, husband of applicant\n working as Casual Labour from year 1982 paid from Contingency Fund,\n temporary status vide Order dated 14.02.2001 (Annexure A-2) appointed in\n regular cadre of MTS in PB-I, GP Rs.1800/- vide Office Order dated\n 17.03.2016 absorbed in regular employment. Rules 13 & 14 read with OM\n dated 01.04.1968 entitles applicant's husband vested right of 50% of period\n prior to grant of temporary status to be counted for pensionary benefits and\n followed by regular/absorption to reckon 50% of applicant's husband total\nPatna\nBench\n service in temporary status followed by regular appointment vide Order dated\n 17.03.2016. Pensionary benefits are beneficial measures and no one has\n control over death and husband of applicant held to be superannuate on\n regular post of MTS.\n\n 60. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that husband of applicant was\n legally entitled for the pension to be computed as above and consequential\n benefits. I find force in submission of learned counsel appearing for applicant.\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n 61. For the above reasons, the Impugned Order dated 11.11.2019 (Annexure\n A-1) and Oder dated 17.03.2016 (Annexure A-3) so far relates to not inducting\n deceased employee in old Statutory Pension Scheme are set aside. The deceased\n employee - husband of the applicant is held entitled for the pension to be\n computed as per findings supra. Respondents are further directed to settle the\n pension/family pension and all other retiral benefits and pay the arrears within\n period of three months from date of production/receipt of order passed today,\n with interest @8% per annum from date of entitlement failing which the\n interest shall be paid @9% per annum from date of entitlement till final\n payment.\n\n 62. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\n\n 33 OA No. /050/0003/2020\n\n 63. Any pending Misc. Application (s), if any, shall also stands disposed of.\n\n 64. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n 65. Registry is directed to send copy of order passed today to Chief Post\n Master General, Bihar Circle, Patna-800001 to report compliance of order\n passed today and submit report within four months for compliance of order\n passed today and in case of non-compliance.
