JUSTICE DINESH KUMAR SINGH\nand\nHONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE PRABHAT KUMAR SINGH\nORAL JUDGMENT\n(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE DINESH KUMAR SINGH)\n\nDate : 25-09-2020\n\nThe present Miscellaneous Appeal is directed against\n\nthe judgment and decree dated 27.7.2013 and 12.8.2013\n\nrespectively, passed by the learned Additional Principal Judge,\n\nFamily Court, Patna in Matrimonial Case No. 763 of 2012,\n\nwhereby the marriage between the appellant and the respondent\n\nhas been dissolved and a decree of divorce has been passed on\n\nthe ground of cruelty.\n\nThe factual matrix of the case is that the marriage\n\nbetween the appellant wife and the respondent husband was\n\nadmittedly performed on 13.2.2000 but the appellant wife\n\nalways treated the respondent husband with cruelty. As a result,\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n2/18\n\nthe respondent preferred Matrimonial Case No. 763 of 2012\n\nseeking dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty and\n\ndesertion, though it is also alleged that the appellant was in love\n\naffair with some person. The respondent pleaded in the plaint of\n\nthe matrimonial case alleging that the appellant used to abuse\n\nhim and his parents. The appellant used to take William -10 or\n\nMandex and other drugs. On protest being made by the\n\nrespondent husband, the appellant wife threatened him that she\n\nwill commit suicide. The appellant did not allow the respondent\n\nto have physical relationship. The appellant admitted that she\n\nhas relationship with some boy but on the pressure of the family\n\nmembers, she has been married with the respondent. The\n\nappellant left the matrimonial house on 7.3.2000 and since then\n\nshe is residing with her parents. The appellant has filed a\n\ncriminal case being Complaint Case No. 2231C of 2002 with\n\naccusation under\nSection 498A\nof the IPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act on 23.10.2002 and in the said case\n\nthe respondent husband had to remain in custody for about three\n\nweeks. The respondent husband initially filed a Judicial\n\nSeparation Case No. 20 of 2001 under\nSection 10\nof the Hindu\n\nMarriage Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) before the\n\nlearned District Judge, Bhojpur for grant of judicial separation.\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n3/18\n\nLater on the same was converted into Matrimonial Case No. 763\n\nof 2012.\n\nThe appellant wife appeared in the matrimonial case,\n\nfiled her written statement claiming that the matrimonial case is\n\nnot maintainable and the same has been filed in retaliation to the\n\ncomplaint lodged by the appellant. The appellant was tortured\n\nfor non-fulfillment of further dowry demand of a Hero Honda\n\nmotorcycle and Rupees Fifty Thousand for starting business by\n\nthe respondent. The appellant claimed neither to have\n\nmisbehaved or committed cruelty nor to have taken any drug\n\nand there is no proof with regard to that. The appellant is still\n\nready to resume the conjugal life and she claims to have left the\n\nmatrimonial house on 1.10.2002. No effort was made to\n\nreconcile the issue and the appellant never had any relationship\n\nwith any boy and has not made any admission to that effect\n\nbefore the respondent and neither the name of the boy has been\n\ndisclosed nor he has been made party to the proceeding.\n\nThe learned Family Court framed the following issues:\n\n\"1.Is the suit as framed maintainable?\n\n2.Has the petitioner got valid cause of action\nfor he suit?\n\n3.Whether the respondent has committed\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n4/18\n\ncruelty with the petitioner and his family\nmembers?\n\n4.Whether the respondent has deserted the\npetitioner?\n\n5.Whether the petitioner is entitled for\ndissolution of his marriage by a decree of divorce?\n\n6.To what relief or reliefs, if any is the\npetitioner entitled?\"\n\nThe respondent husband examined four witnesses. P.\n\nW. 1 Mahakant Prasad, neighbour of the respondent, P.W. 2\n\nHare Krishan Singh, another neighbour of the respondent, P.W.\n\n3 Satish Kumar, the respondent husband himself and P.W. 4 Anil\n\nKumar, brother of the respondent husband. To prove the case of\n\ncruelty, the respondent husband has got the certified copy of\n\nComplaint Case No. 2232C of 2002 exhibited as Ext. 1 and the\n\ncopy of the order dated 19.8.2008 passed by the Patna High\n\nCourt in Cr. Revision No.551 of 2007 and other certified copies\n\nof the petitions and affidavits have also been exhibited.\n\nThe appellant wife also examined seven witnesses. O.P.\n\nWitness No. 1 Shakuntla Devi, own sister of the appellant, O.P.\n\nWitness No 2 Kiran Devi and O.P. Witness No. 3 Ravindra\n\nKumar Sharma, neighbours of the appellant, O.P. Witness No. 4\n\nBindeshwar Prasad, maternal uncle of the appellant, O.P.\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n5/18\n\nWitness No. 5 Anita Devi, appellant herself, O.P. Witness No. 6\n\nTetri Devi, neighbour of the appellant and O.P. Witness No. 7\n\nVinay Kumar Yadav, the brother of the appellant wife.\n\nThe learned Additional Principal Judge, Family Court\n\nfound that on the ground of desertion the marriage could not be\n\ndissolved as the marriage between the parties was admittedly\n\nperformed on 13.2.2000, initially the matrimonial case for\n\njudicial separation was filed on 27.4.2001 and subsequently vide\n\norder dated 5.11.2011 the case was converted into divorce case.\n\nHence, it was contrary to the provision under Section 13(1)(i-b)\n\nof the Act which mandates that the marriage can be dissolved by\n\na decree of divorce on the ground that the other party has\n\ndeserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than\n\ntwo years immediately preceding the presentation of the\n\npetition. In the present case, admittedly, within one year the case\n\nfor judicial separation was filed which was ultimately converted\n\ninto a divorce case.\n\nSo far as the question of cruelty is concerned, it has been\n\ndecided by the learned Additional Principal Judge, Family\n\nCourt in favour of the respondent husband on the ground that\n\nby filing criminal case by the appellant wife he was compelled\n\nto remain in custody for twenty days and during the proceeding\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n6/18\n\nof the complaint case the complainant wife created nuisance in\n\nthe concerned court and above all, they are residing separately\n\nsince more than twelve years and hence, all these facts suggest\n\nthat the appellant wife has been cruel to the respondent husband.\n\nThe finding recorded in paragraph 19 of the impugned\n\njudgment is as follows:\n\n\"In this case admittedly both the parties are\nliving separately for more than 12 years and\nadmittedly there is no any relationship of\nhusband and wife in between the parties for\nthe last one decade. As per statements of\nrespondent's witnesses, respondent bears\ngood behaviour and peace loving lady, then\nthe question arises why both the parties are\nliving separately for the last several years. In\nthis case the respondent filed a criminal case\nunder\nSection 498(A)\nof the IPC against the\npetitioner for want of illegal demand of\nmoney, but the respondent chased the\npetitioner to the Hon'ble High Court Patna\nwhere the privilege of bail was cancelled\nbecause of non-compliance of the order by\nthe petitioner and the petitioner remained in\njail for more than 20 days and lastly got the\nprivilege of bail from the Supreme Court.\nDuring the course of hearing of Complaint\nCase No. 2231(C) of 2002 respondent\nmisbehaved with the petitioner and created\nnuisance in the court as Ext.3 and 4 go to\nshow. Meaning thereby the relationship in\nbetween the parties was not cordial and day\nby day became strained more and more and\nthe respondent did not leave any stone\nunturned to get the petitioner harassed. These\nfacts itself goes to show that the conduct of\nthe respondent was/is cruel against the\npetitioner. These conduct of the respondent\ncorroborates the facts placed by the petitioner\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n7/18\n\nthat the respondent abused them in filthy\nlanguages and quarrel in family on petty\nmatter and did not allow the petitioner to\ncohabit with her, whatever the reason may\nbe.\"\n\nLearned counsel for the appellant submits that the\n\nmarriage has been dissolved contrary to the evidence on record.\n\nNo instance of cruelty has been given. The learned Court below\n\nhas failed to consider that there is no claim of physical torture,\n\nrather it is a mental torture and all the instances which have\n\nbeen considered for causing mental cruelty to the respondent\n\nhusband are subsequent to the filing of the matrimonial case.\n\nThe respondent did not take any effort to reconcile the issue.\n\nSpecific case of the appellant wife in written statement is that\n\nshe is ready to resume the conjugal life and the witnesses\n\nadduced on her behalf, particularly, O.P. Witness No. 4, the\n\nmaternal uncle of the appellant wife and O.P. Witness No. 7, the\n\nbrother of the appellant have deposed that the appellant is still\n\nready to resume the conjugal life.\n\nIt is further submitted by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant that the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a\n\nground of dissolution of marriage under\nSection 13\nof the Act,\n\nyet the marriage has been considered to be irretrievably broken\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n8/18\n\ndown. The respondent was in jail since he failed to comply the\n\norder of the Court of payment of maintenance amount and\n\nlitigation cost, which he undertook to pay, as a result his bail\n\nwas cancelled and ultimately, he was granted bail by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court on the condition that the respondent\n\nhusband will pay Rupees One Thousand to the appellant wife\n\nper month.\n\nLearned counsel for the respondent submits that the\n\nrespondent husband was tortured and there is specific instance\n\nto that effect. The appellant wife misbehaved not only with the\n\nrespondent husband, but also with his parents. The appellant\n\nused to consume drugs and she never allowed the respondent to\n\nhave physical relationship as she remained at her parents house.\n\nHence, the impugned judgment does not need any interference.\n\nHaving heard learned counsels for the parties, this much is\n\nan admitted position that the marriage was performed between\n\nthe appellant and the respondent on 13.2.2000. The respondent\n\nhusband initially filed Judicial Separation Case No. 20 of 2001\n\nfor grant of judicial separation on 27.4.2001 i.e. within fourteen\n\nmonths of the marriage. Subsequently, vide order dated\n\n5.11.2011\nthe said case was converted into a Divorce case on\n\nfiling of the amendment by respondent husband.\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n9/18\n\nSection 10\nof the Act deals with the option of judicial\n\nseparation which allows either party to a marriage to present a\n\npetition praying for a decree for judicial separation on any of\n\nthe grounds specified in sub-section(1) of\nSection 13\nof the Act\n\nor any one of the grounds specified under sub-section (2)\n\nthereof. Section 13(1)(i-b) of the Act clearly suggests that on the\n\nground of desertion the dissolution of marriage can be claimed\n\nif the other party has deserted the petitioner for a continuous\n\nperiod of not less than two years immediately preceding the\n\npresentation of the petition. Meaning thereby, the application for\n\njudicial separation was not maintainable in the present case, in\n\nview of the embargo under Section 13(1)(i-b) of the Act, hence,\n\nthe learned Court below has rightly rejected the claim of the\n\nrespondent husband for dissolution of marriage on the ground of\n\ndesertion.\n\nSo far as cruelty is concerned, the cruelty has not been\n\ndefined in the Act. The concept of cruelty and its effect vary\n\nfrom individual to individual as has been held in the case of\n\nGananath Pattnaik Vs. State of Orissa, reported in (2002) 2 SCC\n\n619. Paragraph 7 of the judgment reads as follows:\n\n\"7. The concept of cruelty and its effect varies\nfrom individual to individual, also depending upon\nthe social and economic status to which such\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n10/18\n\nperson belongs. \"Cruelty\" for the purposes of\nconstituting the offence under the aforesaid section\nneed not be physical. Even mental torture or\nabnormal behaviour may amount to cruelty and\nharassment in a given case.\"\n\nCruelty can be physical and mental both. It is difficult to\n\nprove mental cruelty by direct evidence as the mental cruelty is\n\nthe state of mind and feeling caused to one side with the\n\nbehaviour and conduct of the other side.\n\nIn the present case, from perusal of the evidence adduced,\n\nit appears that the respondent husband has not alleged any\n\nphysical cruelty but only a mental cruelty and to prove the same,\n\nit is said that the behaviour of the appellant wife was not good\n\nwith the respondent and his parents, the appellant wife used to\n\nconsume certain drugs, but the time and date of such\n\nmisbehaviour has not been mentioned, nor any witness has\n\nsuggested like that. Out of four witnesses, P.Ws 1 and 2 are\n\nneighbour of the respondent husband who are hear say\n\nwitnesses. In a matrimonial suit the best witnesses are family\n\nmembers, but the only family member apart from the\n\nrespondent husband, is P.W. 4 Anil Kumar, the brother of the\n\nrespondent husband. P.W. 1 and P.W. 4 in their evidence have\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n11/18\n\nstated that the appellant wife remained in the matrimonial house\n\nonly for 22 days. No medical opinion has been brought on\n\nrecord to prove that the appellant wife used to consume certain\n\ndrugs. So far the issue of cruelty by filing criminal case under\n\nSection 498A\nof the IPC is concerned, that may not be\n\nconsidered as cruelty. Moreover, the criminal case was filed\n\nsubsequent to the filing of the matrimonial case for judicial\n\nseparation and the bail of the respondent husband was cancelled\n\ndue to default in complying the order of the Court.\n\nIt is well settled law that no party can be permitted to\n\ncarve out issues for destroying the institution of marriage on\n\nfrivolous ground. Day to day wear and tear cannot be treated as\n\ncruelty. So far as mental cruelty is concerned, in the case of\n\nSamar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh\n, reported in (2007) 4 SCC 511,\n\nthe legislature has been carved out indicating the instances of\n\nmental cruelty. Paragraph 101 of the judgment reads as follows:\n\n\"101. No uniform standard can ever be laid down for\nguidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some\ninstances of human behaviour which may be relevant in\ndealing with the cases of 'mental cruelty'. The instances\nindicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only\nillustrative and not exhaustive:\n\n(i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life\nof the parties, acute mental pain, agony and\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n12/18\n\nsuffering as would not make possible for the parties\nto live with each other could come within the broad\nparameters of mental cruelty.\n\n(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire\nmatrimonial life of the parties, it becomes\nabundantly clear that situation is such that the\nwronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put\nup with such conduct and continue to live with\nother party.\n\n(iii)***\n\n(iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of\ndeep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one\nspouse caused by the conduct of other for a long\ntime may lead to mental cruelty.\n\n(v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating\ntreatment calculated to torture, discommode or\nrender miserable life of the spouse.\n\n(vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour\nof one spouse actually affecting physical and\nmental health of the other spouse. The treatment\ncomplained of and the resultant danger or\napprehension must be very grave, substantial and\nweighty.\n\n(vii)-(ix)***\n\n(x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole\nand a few isolated instances over a period of years\nwill not amount to cruelty. The ill-conduct must be\npersistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the\nrelationship has deteriorated to an extent that\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n13/18\n\nbecause of the acts and behaviour of a spouse, the\nwronged party finds it extremely difficult to live\nwith the other party any longer, may amount to\nmental cruelty.\n\n(xi)-(xiii)***\n\n(xiv) Where there has been a long period of\ncontinuous separation, it may fairly be concluded\nthat the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The\nmarriage becomes a fiction though supported by a\nlegal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in\nsuch cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage;\n\non the contrary, it shows scant regard for the\nfeelings and emotions of the parties. In such like\nsituations, it may lead to mental cruelty.\"\n\nThere is nothing on record to suggest that it was\n\nimpossible for the respondent husband to live with the appellant.\n\nThe very limited period of stay of the appellant wife at the\n\nmatrimonial house suggests that it was too early to claim\n\njudicial separation on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The\n\nmeticulous analysis of the materials on record suggests that the\n\npresent case does not come within the purview of the instances\n\nenumerated in the case of\nSamar Ghosh\n(supra) with regard to\n\nmental cruelty.\n\nIn the case of\nK. Srinivas Rao Vs. D.A. Deepa\n, reported\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n14/18\n\nin (2013) 5 SCC 226, certain more grounds have been added as\n\ninstances of mental cruelty, like, making unfounded indecent\n\ndefamatory allegation against the spouse or his or her relatives\n\nin the pleadings, filing of complaints or issue notices or news\n\nitems which may have adverse impact on the business prospect\n\nor the job of the spouse and filing repeated false complaints and\n\ncases in the court against the spouse may amount to mental\n\ncruelty. Paragraph 16 of the judgment reads as follows:\n\n\"16. Thus, to the instances illustrative of\nmental cruelty noted in Samar Ghosh [(2007) 4\nSCC 511] , we could add a few more. Making\nunfounded indecent defamatory allegations against\nthe spouse or his or her relatives in the pleadings,\nfiling of complaints or issuing notices or news\nitems which may have adverse impact on the\nbusiness prospect or the job of the spouse and filing\nrepeated false complaints and cases in the court\nagainst the spouse would, in the facts of a case,\namount to causing mental cruelty to the other\nspouse.\"\n\nThe present case also does not come under any of the\n\ninstances of mental cruelty as enumerated in above quoted\n\njudgments.\n\nHence, in view of this Court, the evidence with regard to\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n15/18\n\nthe cruelty has not been appreciated in its true perspective and\n\nhence the ground of cruelty has not been proved by the evidence\n\non record.\n\nIt is also apt to consider that in the present case,\n\nmatrimonial proceeding got initiated within a little over one\n\nyear of the marriage and delay in disposal of the matrimonial\n\ncase cannot give a rope for dissolving the marriage. However in\n\nthe case of\nK. Srinivas\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nsuggested that the idea of pre-litigation mediation and such\n\nmediation can be had by resorting to the provision of\nSection 9\n\nof the Family Courts Act. Paragraph 46.1 of the judgment reads\n\nas follows:\n\n\"46.1. In terms of\nSection 9\nof the Family\nCourts Act, the Family Courts shall make all efforts\nto settle the matrimonial disputes through\nmediation. Even if the counsellors submit a failure\nreport, the Family Courts shall, with the consent of\nthe parties, refer the matter to the mediation centre.\nIn such a case, however, the Family Courts shall set\na reasonable time-limit for mediation centres to\ncomplete the process of mediation because\notherwise the resolution of the disputes by the\nFamily Court may get delayed. In a given case, if\nthere is good chance of settlement, the Family\nCourt in its discretion, can always extend the time-\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n16/18\n\nlimit.\"\n\nSection 9\nof the Family Courts Act, 1984 casts the duty\n\nupon the Family Court to persuade the parties to arrive at a\n\nsettlement in respect of the matrimonial dispute.\nSection 9\nof the\n\nFamily Courts Act reads as follows:-\n\n\"In every suit or proceeding,\nendeavour shall be made by the Family Court in\nthe first instance, where it is possible to do so\nconsistent with the nature and circumstances of\nthe case, to assist and persuade the parties in\narriving at a settlement in respect of the subject-\nmatter of the suit or proceeding and for this\npurpose a Family Court may, subject to any rules\nmade by the High Court, follow such procedure\nas it may deem fit. -(1) In every suit or\nproceeding, endeavour shall be made by the\nFamily Court in the first instance, where it is\npossible to do so consistent with the nature and\ncircumstances of the case, to assist and persuade\nthe parties in arriving at a settlement in respect\nof the subject-matter of the suit or proceeding\nand for this purpose a Family Court may, subject\nto any rules made by the High Court, follow\nsuch procedure as it may deem fit.\"\n\n(2) If, in any suit or proceeding, at any\nstage, it appears to the Family Court that there is\na reasonable possibility of a settlement between\nthe parties, the Family Court may adjourn the\nproceedings for such period as it think fit to\nenable attempts to be made to effect such a\nsettlement.\n\n(3) The power conferred by sub-\n\nsection (2) shall be in addition to, and not in\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n17/18\n\nderogation of any other power of the Family\nCourt to adjourn the proceedings.\"\n\nFrom the above provision, it is crystal clear that in\n\nevery suit or proceeding, the Family Court has to take effort at\n\nthe first instance where it is possible to do so consistent with the\n\nnature and circumstances of the case, and to assist and persuade\n\nthe parties in arriving at a settlement in respect to the\n\nmatrimonial dispute.\n\nSection 23(2)\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 also\n\ncasts a duty upon the Court to bring about reconciliation.\n\nSection 23(2)\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"Before proceeding to grant any relief\nunder this Act, it shall be the duty of the Court in\nthe first instance, in every case where it is\npossible so to do consistently with the nature\nand circumstances of the case, to make every\nendeavour to bring about a reconciliation\nbetween the parties:\n\nProvided that nothing contained in this\nsub-section shall apply to any proceeding\nwherein relief is sought on any of the grounds\nspecified in clause (ii), clause (iii), clause (iv),\nclause(v), clause(vi) or clause (vii) of sub-\nsection (1) of\nSection 13\n.\"\n\nThere is nothing on record to suggest that any effort was\n\nmade by the learned Additional Principal Judge, Family Court to\nPatna High Court MA No.81 of 2014 dt.25-09-2020\n\n18/18\n\nget the issue reconciled between the parties before deciding the\n\nissue on merits.\n\nIn view of the discussions made above, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that the marriage has been dissolved\n\ncontrary to the evidence on record. As a result, the impugned\n\njudgment and decree dated 27.7.2013 and 12.8.2013 passed by\n\nthe learned Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Patna in\n\nMatrimonial Case No. 763 of 2012 is set aside.\n\nAccordingly, this Miscellaneous Appeal is allowed. Let\n\nthe decree be prepared accordingly.\n\n(Dinesh Kumar Singh, J)\n\n( Prabhat Kumar Singh, J)\n\nanil/-\n\nAFR/NAFR\nCAV DATE\nUploading Date\nTransmission Date",
