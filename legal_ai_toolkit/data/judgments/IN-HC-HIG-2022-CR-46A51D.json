The report submitted by the Civil Judge\n\n(Junior Division) Dhuri is extracted as under:-\n\n(i) Regarding genuineness and voluntary nature\nof the compromise;\n\nSo as to give opinion with regard to genuineness or\n\n2 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -3-\n\notherwise of the compromise, the undersigned has recorded the\nstatement of respondent Yogesh Kumar son of Rakesh Kumr\nson of Somnath resident of Pakki Gali, Sherpur and Shella\nDevi wife of Somnath who are the complainants in the\npresent FIR No.34 dated 30.04.2021 under\nSection 379-B\n\nIPC, PS Sherpur.\n\nIn their statements, they had stated that on their\ninitiation, FIR No.34 dated 30.04.2021 under\nSection 379-B\n\nIPC, was registered at Police Station Sherpur, District Sangrur\noriginally against accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of\nParamjit Singh. Later during police investigation police has\nnominated Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep Singh as accused\nin the present FIR.\n\nIt was further submitted by them that now with the\nintervention of respectable and relatives persons, they had\nvoluntarily compromised the matter with accused\npersons/petitioners Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep Singh and\nPardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of Paramjit Singh, without there\nbeing any pressure or coercion any misrepresentation or undue\ninfluence and without any greed.

They further stated that they have seen the original\ncompromise dated 06.05.2021 and identified their\nsignatures over the same which is Ex.CX. They further\nstated that the compromise is genuine one, voluntarily\nand without any coercion or any undue influence and the\nsame is valid.

They further prayed\nthat the present FIR and all the consequential proceedings\nmay kindly be quashed against them.\n\n(ii) Whether all accused/petitioners are appearing\nbefore the Court or are on bail; and\n\nAs per the statement of IO ASI Ram Singh No.\n1718/Sgr.

P.S.

Accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of\nParamjit Singh is not involved in any other case.\n\nFrom the statements of the parties as well as\ntheir oral examination, undersigned is of the opinion\nthat matter has been amicably settled between\naccused/petitioners Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep\nSingh and accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of\nParamjit Singh and complainants/respondents Yogesh\nKumar and Shella Devi.\n\nThe said compromise is genuine, voluntarily and is\nwithout any coercion or undue influence.\n\n5. The full Bench of this Court in the matter of \"\nKulwinder Singh\n\nand others versus State of Punjab and another\n\" reported as (Punjab and\n\nHaryana High Court) : 2007 (3) RCR (Criminal) 1052 has been observed as\n\nunder:\n\n\" (28) To conclude, it can safely be said that there can never be\nany hard and fast category which can be prescribed to enable the\nCourt to exercise its power under\nSection 482\nof the Cr.P.C. The\nonly principle that can be laid down is the one which has been\nincorporated in the Section itself, i.e., \"to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any Court\" or \"to secure the ends of justice\".\n\n(29) In\nMrs. Shakuntala Sawhney v. Mrs. Kaushalya Sawhney\nand Ors.\n, Hon'ble Krishna Iyer, J. aptly summoned up the essence\nof compromise in the following words:\n\n5 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -6-\n\n\"The finest hour of justice arrives propitiously when parties,\ndespite falling apart, bury the hatchet and weave a sense of\nfellowship of reunion.\"\n\n(30) The power to do complete justice is the very essence of every\njudicial justice dispensation system. It cannot be diluted by\ndistorted perceptions and is not a slave to anything, except to the\ncaution and circumspection, the standards of which the Court sets\nbefore it, in exercise of such plenary and unfettered power\ninherently vested in it while donning the cloak of compassion to\nachieve the ends of justice.\n\n(31) No embargo, be in the shape of Section 320(9) of the\nCr.P.C., or any other such curtailment, can whittle down the\npower under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n(32) The compromise, in a modern society, is the sine qua non of\nharmony and orderly behaviour. It is the soul of justice and if the\npower under\nSection 482\nof the Cr.P.C. is used to enhance such a\ncompromise which, in turn, enhances the social amity and\nreduces friction, then it truly is \"finest hour of justice\". Disputes\nwhich have their genesis in a matrimonial discord, landlord-\ntenant matters, commercial transactions and other such matters\ncan safely be dealt with by the Court by exercising its powers\nunder\nSection 482\nof the Cr.P.C. in the event of a compromise,\nbut this is not to say that the power is limited to such cases. There\ncan never be any such rigid rule to prescribe the exercise of such\npower, especially in the absence of any premonitions to forecast\nand predict eventualities which the cause of justice may throw up\nduring the course of a litigation.\n\n(33) The only inevitable conclusion from the above discussion is\nthat there is no statutory bar under the\nCr.P.C\n. which can affect\nthe inherent power of this Court under\nSection 482\n. Further, the\nsame cannot be limited to matrimonial cases alone and the Court\nhas the wide power to quash the proceedings even in non-\ncompoundable offences notwithstanding the bar under\nSection\nof the Cr.P.C., in order to prevent the abuse of law and to\nsecure the ends of justice.\n\n6 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -7-\n\n(34) The power under\nSection 482\nof the Cr.P.C. is to be\nexercised Ex-Debitia Justitia to prevent an abuse of process of\nCourt. There can neither be an exhaustive list nor the defined\npara-meters to enable a High Court to invoke or exercise its\ninherent powers. It will always depend upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. The power under\nSection 482\nof the\nCr.P.C. has no limits. However, the High Court will exercise it\nsparingly and with utmost care and caution. The exercise of\npower has to be with circumspection and restraint. The Court is a\nvital and an extra-ordinary effective instrument to maintain and\ncontrol social order. The Courts play role of paramount\nimportance in achieving peace, harmony and ever-lasting\ncongeniality in society. Resolution of a dispute by way of a\ncompromise between two warring groups, therefore, should\nattract the immediate and prompt attention of a Court which\nshould endeavour to give full effect to the same unless such\ncompromise is abhorrent to lawful composition of the society or\nwould promote savagery.\n\n6. The legal principles as laid down for quashing of the judgment\n\nwere also approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Gian Singh\n\nVersus State of Punjab and another, (2012) 10 SCC 303. Still further, the\n\nbroad principles for exercising the powers under\nSection 482\nwere summarized\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \"Parbatbhai Aahir @\n\nParbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others verus State of Gujarat and\n\nanother\" (2017) 9 SCC 641, the same are extracted as under:\n\n16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the\nsubject, may be summarised in the following propositions :\n\n16.1\nSection 482\npreserves the inherent powers of the High Court\nto prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the\nends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only\nrecognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;\n\n16.2 The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash\na First Information Report or a criminal proceeding on the\n\n7 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -8-\n\nground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender\nand the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for\nthe purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an\noffence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of\n\nSection 320\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power\nto quash under\nSection 482\nis attracted even if the offence is non-\ncompoundable.\n\n16.3 In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or\ncomplaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under\n\nSection 482\n, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of\njustice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;\n\n16.4 While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit\nand plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of\njustice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court;\n\n16.5 The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information\nReport should be quashed on the ground that the offender and\nvictim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts\nand circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of\nprinciples can be formulated;\n\n16.6 In the exercise of the power under\nSection 482\nand while\ndealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\noffence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity\nor offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot\nappropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the\nvictim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking,\nnot private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The\ndecision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the\noverriding element of public interest in punishing persons for\nserious offences;\n\n16.7 As distinguished from serious offences, there may be\ncriminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant\nelement of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing in so\nfar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;\n\n16.8 Criminal cases involving offences which arise from\n\n8 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -9-\n\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar\ntransactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate\nsituations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;\n\n16.9 In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal\nproceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants,\nthe possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a\ncriminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and\n\n16.10 There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\npropositions 16.8 and 16.9 above. Economic offences involving\nthe financial and economic well-being of the state have\nimplications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute\nbetween private disputants. The High Court would be justified in\ndeclining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity\nakin to a financial or economic fraud or mis-demeanour. The\nconsequences of the act complained of upon the financial or\neconomic system will weigh in the balance.\n\n7. It is evident that in view of the amicable resolution of the issues\n\namongst the parties, no useful purpose would be served by continuation of the\n\nproceedings. The furtherance of the proceedings is likely to be a waste of\n\njudicial time and there appears to be no chances of conviction.\n\n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \"\nRamgopal and\n\nanother versus State of Madhya Pradesh\n\" reported as 2021 SCC online SC\n\n83, that the matters which can be categorized as personal in nature or in the\n\nmatters in which the nature of injuries do not exhibit mental depravity or\n\ncommission of an offence of such a serious nature that quashing of which\n\nwould override public interest, the Court can quash the FIR in view of the\n\nsettlement arrived at amongst the parties. The observation of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court is extracted as under:\n\n\"19. We thus sum up and hold that as opposed to\nSection\nCr.P.C. where the Court is squarely guided by the\ncompromise between the parties in respect of offences\n\n9 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -10-\n\n'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra-\nordinary power enjoined upon a High Court under\nSection\nCr.P.C. or vested in this Court under\nArticle 142\nof the\nConstitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds\nof\nSection 320\nCr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such\npowers of wide amplitude ought to be exercised carefully in the\ncontext of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i)\nNature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society;\n\n(ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of\ncompromise between the accused and the victim; & (iv)\nConduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the\noccurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant\nconsiderations.\n\n20. Having appraised the afore-stated parameters and\nweighing upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of the two\nappeals before us, we are inclined to invoke powers\nunder\nArticle 142\nand quash the criminal proceedings and\nconsequently set aside the conviction in both the appeals. We\nsay so for the reasons that:\n\nFirstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals can be\ncategorized as purely personal or having overtones of criminal\nproceedings of private nature;\n\nSecondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which the\nAppellants have been convicted, do not appear to exhibit their\nmental depravity or commission of an offence of such a serious\nnature that quashing of which would override public interest;\n\nThirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries, it is\nimmaterial that the trial against the Appellants had been\nconcluded or their appeal(s) against conviction stand\ndismissed;\n\nFourthly, the parties on their own volition, without any\ncoercion or compulsion, willingly and voluntarily have buried\n\n10 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -11-\n\ntheir differences and wish to accord a quietus to their\ndispute(s);\n\nFifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place way\nback in the years 2000 and 1995, respectively. There is nothing\non record to evince that either before or after the purported\ncompromise, any untoward incident transpired between the\nparties;\n\nSixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s) are\nresidents of the same village(s) and/or work in close vicinity,\nthe quashing of criminal proceedings will advance peace,\nharmony, and fellowship amongst the parties who have decided\nto forget and forgive any ill-will and have no vengeance against\neach other; and\n\nSeventhly, the cause of administration of criminal justice\nsystem would remain un-effected on acceptance of the amicable\nsettlement between the parties and/or resultant acquittal of the\nAppellants; more so looking at their present age.\n\n9. A perusal of the FIR shows that the dispute pertains to the\n\nalleged snatching of gold ear rings of the complainant. The accused persons\n\nare alleged to have attacked the grand-mother of the complainant and of\n\nhaving eloped after the same. The petitioners have realized their mistake and\n\nthereupon have entered into a settlement with the complainant. No dispute\n\nsurvives between the parties. Even though, one another FIR No.38 of 2019\n\nhas been registered against the petitioners for offence under\nSections 304\n\nand\nIPC at Police Station Thulliwal, District Barnala, however, the same\n\nshould not restrain the parties from entering into a settlement of a dispute\n\nthat is in relation to an offence which is neither heinous nor causes mental\n\ndepravity to the complainant as well as the victim. The case is at the initial\n\nstages and the parties can be saved of agony of having to face protracted\n\n11 of 12\n\n::: Downloaded on - 11-03-2022 00:29:30 :::\n\nCRM-M-20917-2021 -12-\n\ncriminal trial.\n\n10. Considering the facts of the instant case and noticing the\n\nprinciples\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in \"Gian Singh Versus State of\n\nPunjab and another\", (2012) 10 SCC 303, \"Ramgopal and another versus\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh\" reported as 2021 SCC online SC 834 and also by\n\nthe Full Bench of this Court in \"\nKulwinder Singh and others versus State of\n\nPunjab and another\n\", 2007 (3) RCR (Criminal) 1052, that the dispute\n\ninvolved in the instant case pertains to offence under\nSection 379-B\nIPC\n\nwhich cannot be perceived as falling within the prohibited category or as an\n\noffence that is heinous and grossly shocking to the conscience of the Court\n\nor having a wide pervasive impact on the social or public order, the instant\n\npetition is allowed and the case FIR No. 34 dated 30.04.2021 registered under\n\nSection 379-B\nIPC at Police Station Sherpur, District Sangrur and all\n\nsubsequent proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed, in light of the\n\ncompromise dated 06.05.2021 (Annexure P-2). However, the same would be\n\nsubject to payment of costs of Rs. 15,000/- each to be deposited with the\n\n'Punjab Legal Aid Service Authority' and 'Haryana Legal Aid Service\n\nAuthority', respectively within one month from the date of receipt of certified\n\ncopy of this order.\n\nPetition is allowed.\n\n(VINOD S.
