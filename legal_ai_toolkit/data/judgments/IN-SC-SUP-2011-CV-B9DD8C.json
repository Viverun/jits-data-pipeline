These appeals, by the grant of special leave, are directed\n\nagainst common judgment dated May 2, 2008 rendered by the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Delhi in C.W.P. No. 2157\n\nof 2002, C.W.P. No.1965 of 2002 and C.W.P. No.2362 of 2002.\n\nThe appellants were the Members of Delhi Higher Judicial\n\nService (`D.H.J.S.', for short). Mr. M.S.Rohilla and Mr.\n\nP.D.Gupta were compulsorily retired from service under Rule\n\n56 (j) of the Fundamental Rules, read with Rule 33 of the Delhi\n\nJudicial Service Rules 1970, whereas deceased Mr. R.S.Verma\n\nwas compulsorily retired from service under Rule 16(3) of All\n\nIndia Service (Death-cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules 1958 read\n\nwith Rule 27 of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970,\n\non different dates. They had challenged orders of their\n\ncompulsory retirement from service by filing Writ Petitions\n\nunder\nArticle 226.\nThough the result of each appeal would\n\ndepend on its own facts, having regard to the commonality of\n\nsubmissions on legal aspects, this Court had tagged these\n\ncases together and heard them one after the other. This Court\n\nproposes to dispose of the three appeals, by this common\n\nJudgment for the sake of avoiding repetitiveness of legal\nprinciples. However, the Court proposes to consider each case\n\non its own merits.\n\nWith these observations, the Court proposes to deal with\n\nappeal arising out of Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.27028\n\nof 2008, filed by Mr. Rajendra Singh Verma against decision in\n\nC.W.P. No.2157 of 2002. Mr. Verma was born on April 13,\n\n1950. After enrolling himself as an advocate, he had started\n\nlegal practice in the year 1980. In the year 1994 applications\n\nwere invited from practicing advocates for direct recruitment\n\nto the D.H.J.S. Mr. Verma had also applied pursuant to the\n\nsaid advertisement and after interview he was selected and\n\nwas offered appointment to D.H.J.S. He joined the service on\n\n9.3.1995 and was aged about 45 years on the date of joining\n\nservice. He worked as Additional District Judge at\n\nKarkardooma Courts, Shahdara, Delhi. For the year 1995-\n\n1996 he was given a `B' remark in the A.C.R., which means his\n\nperformance was average. From April 1, 1999 to December 7,\n\n2000, he functioned as Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi.\n3. By the year 2000 he had rendered service of five years.\n\nIt may be mentioned that a Screening Committee consisting of\n\ntwo Hon'ble Judges of Delhi High Court was constituted for\n\nscreening the cases of those officers of the D.H.J.S. and Delhi\n\nJudicial Service, who had either completed thirty years of\n\nservice or had attained the age of 50/55 years and for\n\nconsidering the question whether those Judicial Officers\n\nshould be continued in service or should be prematurely\n\nretired in public interest. The Screening Committee\n\nconsidered the cases of several officers including that of Mr.\n\nVerma under Rule 56 (j) of the Fundamental Rules. The\n\nlearned members of Screening Committee perused service\n\nrecord including the ACR dossiers of the Judicial Officers but\n\ndid not find, for the time being, any Officer who could be\n\nretired prematurely in public interest as on July 17, 2000. A\n\ncopy of the abstracts from the Minutes of the Meeting of the\n\nFull Court of Delhi High Court held on July 22, 2000 indicates\n\nthat the Full Court had accepted the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee.\nHowever, by an order dated December 7, 2000 which was\n\nserved upon Mr. Verma on December 8, 2000, judicial work\n\nentrusted to him was withdrawn with immediate effect. He\n\nwas made in-charge of all the record rooms in Tis Hazari\n\nCourts, Delhi. ACRs of four years i.e. from the year 1997 to\n\nthe year 2000 were not communicated to him on due dates.\n\nFrom the record it is evident that ACRs of Mr. Verma for the\n\nyears 1997, 1998 and 1999 were written in one go and he was\n\nawarded `C` remark, which means below average. The ACRs\n\nfor above mentioned three years were communicated to him on\n\nJanuary 8, 2001 whereupon he had made representation\n\nagainst the same on February 16, 2001.\n\n4. In the A.C.R. for the year 2000, he was given `C-' remark,\n\nwhich means his integrity was doubtful. While\n\ncommunicating the ACR for the year 2000, he was given a\n\ntime of six weeks to make representation against the same.\n\nSuch communication was received by him on September 25,\n\n2001. On September 21, 2001 the Screening Committee of the\n\nHigh Court decided to retire Mr. Verma compulsorily from\nservice. The Full Court of the Delhi High Court accepted the\n\nrecommendation made by the Screening Committee in its\n\nmeeting held on September 22, 2001. After acceptance of\n\nrecommendation of the Screening Committee by the Full\n\nCourt, entire work entrusted to him was withdrawn by a letter\n\ndated September 24, 2001. He made representation dated\n\nSeptember 25, 2001 against the proposed order retiring him\n\ncompulsorily from service. He was thereafter served with\n\norder dated September 27, 2001 retiring him compulsorily\n\nfrom service with effect from September 28, 2001. The record\n\nshows that the representation dated 16.2.2001 made by Mr.\n\nVerma against ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 was\n\nrejected on October 5, 2001. Against the A.C.R. for the year\n\n2000, Mr. Verma had made a representation dated October\n\n13, 2001, which was received by the High Court on September\n\n25, 2001. This was rejected by the High Court vide order\n\ndated November 25, 2001.\n\n5. Thereupon Mr. Verma had filed C.W.P. No. 2157 of 2002\n\nbefore the Delhi High Court challenging the order of\ncompulsory retirement dated September 27, 2001. The reliefs\n\nclaimed in the petition filed by him are enumerated in detail in\n\nparagraph 7 of the impugned judgment and, therefore, it is not\n\nnecessary to reproduce the same in this judgment. The\n\nprayers made by Mr. Verma in his Writ Petition were\n\nessentially based on the following grounds, namely, (1) ACRs\n\nfor the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were not recorded as and\n\nwhen they fell due and, therefore, he had reason to believe\n\nthat nothing adverse was found against his judicial work\n\nand/or conduct whereas recording of ACRs for the three years\n\nat the same time on January 3, 2001, was illegal. (2) There\n\nwas no inspection by the Hon'ble Inspecting Judge for the\n\nyears 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 as a result of which the\n\ndecision to retire him prematurely from service on the basis\n\nthat his performance was below average and his integrity was\n\ndoubtful, was bad in law. (3) In July, 2000 when the Screening\n\nCommittee had reviewed the cases of various Officers of\n\nD.H.J.S. for premature retirement in public interest, no\n\nrecommendation was made to retire anyone including him,\n\ncompulsorily from service and thus review of his case on\nSeptember 21, 2001 by the Screening Committee, on the same\n\nmaterial, was impermissible. (4) Adverse entry for the year\n\n2000 was served upon him on September 25, 2001 vide a\n\nletter dated September 21, 2001 from the Registrar (Vigilance),\n\nHigh Court whereas the recommendation made by the\n\nScreening Committee on September 21, 2001 to retire him\n\ncompulsorily from service was accepted by the Full Court in its\n\nmeeting held on September 22, 2001, on the basis of which\n\nthe Lt. Governor of Delhi passed the order of compulsory\n\nretirement on September 27, 2001 which was communicated\n\nto him on September 28, 2001 and as he was deprived of right\n\nto make meaningful representation against ACR of the year\n\n2000, the order retiring him compulsorily from service was\n\nliable to be set aside. (5) His representation against the entries\n\nfor the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 was rejected vide letter\n\ndated October 5, 2001, which was received by him on October\n\n8, 2001 whereas his representation dated October 13, 2001\n\nagainst the entry for the year 2000 was dismissed by order\n\ndated April 5, 2002, before which order of compulsory\n\nretirement from service was passed against him on September\n28, 2001 and thus non-consideration of representation before\n\npassing order of compulsory retirement had vitiated order of\n\nhis compulsory retirement. (6) Before taking decision to retire\n\nhim prematurely from service opportunity of being heard was\n\nnot given to him. (7) The circumstances of the case indicated\n\nthat the Order of compulsorily retirement passed against him\n\nwas punitive, arbitrary, mala fide and in violation of the\n\nprinciples of natural justice.\n\n6.\nIn support of these submissions, Mr. Verma had relied\n\nupon decisions in (\na) Baikunth Nath Das Vs. Chief District\n\nMedical Officer, Baripada\n(1992) 2 SCC 299; (\nb) Madan\n\nMohan Choudhary Vs. State of Bihar\n(1999) 3 SCC 396; (c)\n\nHigh Court of\nPunjab & Haryana Vs. I.C. Jain\n(1999) 4 SCC\n\n579; (d) High Court of Judicature at\nAllahabad Vs. Sarnam\n\nSingh & Another\n(2000) 2 SCC 339; (e) Bishwanath Prasad\n\nSingh Vs. State of Bihar (2001) 2 SCC 305; (\nf) State of U.P.\n\nVs Yamuna Shanker Mishra\n(1997) 4 SCC 7; (g) Registrar,\n\nHigh Court of\nMadras Vs. R. Rajiah\n(1988) 3 SCC 211; (\nh)\n\nM.S. Bindra Vs. Union of India & Others\n(1998) 7 SCC 310;\n(\ni) Ram Ekbal Sharma Vs. State of Bihar & Another\n(1990) 3\n\nSCC 504; (\nj) Anoop Jaiswal Vs. Govt. of India\n(1984) 2 SCC\n\n369; and (\nk) Padam Singh Vs. Union of India & Others\n,\n\n2000 (III) AD (Delhi) 430 (D.B.).\n\n7. On Service of notice, the respondent No.1, namely, the Lt.\n\nGovernor, Administrator (Government of N.C.T. of Delhi) and\n\nthe respondent No.2, i.e., the High Court of Delhi had filed\n\ntheir separate counter affidavits opposing the Writ Petition.\n\nThe High Court, in its reply, amongst other things had\n\nexplained that the date of birth of Mr. Verma was April 13,\n\n1950 and, therefore, review of his case on September 21, 2001\n\nwhen he had completed fifty one years of age was perfectly\n\nlegal. According to the High Court, his case was reviewed by\n\nthe Screening Committee on September 21, 2001 and the\n\nCommittee had recommended that he should be compulsorily\n\nretired from service keeping in view his overall service record,\n\nACRs and performance. The High Court mentioned in its reply\n\nthat the recommendation made by the Screening Committee\n\nwas accepted by the Full Court on September 22, 2001. What\nwas asserted by the High Court was that the decision of the\n\nFull Court was just and reasonable having regard to the ACRs\n\nof Mr. Verma.\n\n8. The Division Bench hearing the petition filed by Mr.\n\nVerma had summoned the entire service record\n\nrelating to his case. After hearing the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties and considering the\n\nmaterials on the record, the High Court observed\n\nthat a mere glance at the ACRs of Mr. Verma and\n\nother records was enough to conclude that the\n\ndecision to retire him compulsorily from service was\n\nwell founded. The High Court discussed principles\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the case of\nBaikunth\n\nNath Das\n(supra) with regard to compulsory\n\nretirement under Rule 56(j) of the Fundamental\n\nRules, and also took into consideration the\n\nprinciples of law as to when interference by a writ\n\nCourt with the decision of compulsory retirement\n\nwould be justified. Having noticed the law, the High\nCourt held that principles of natural justice were\n\nnot attracted in case of compulsory retirement. The\n\nHigh Court observed that in this case the ACRs for\n\nthree years were recorded at the same time which\n\naccording to High Court was not proper, but held\n\nthat there is no absolute proposition of law that\n\nrecording of ACRs at once would be perse illegal.\n\nThe High Court expressed the view that if good\n\nreasons were noted for which the ACRs could not be\n\nrecorded by stipulated dates and the matter of\n\nrecording of ACRs had to be deferred, the recording\n\nof ACRs of few years at one point of time would not\n\nrender the same illegal. The High Court noticed the\n\nreasons as to why ACRs for the years 1997, 1998\n\nand 1999 were recorded in one go, and thereafter\n\nheld that there was sufficient explanation for\n\nrecording the ACRs of three years at one time. The\n\nargument that there was no material justifying\n\nrecording such ACRs was considered to be\n\nmisconceived in view of settled legal position.\nAccording to the High Court the entire service\n\nrecord of Mr. Verma from 1995 to 2000 revealed\n\nthat even for one year he had not earned \"Above\n\nAverage\" remark and his performance and conduct\n\nas a judicial officer in fact had kept on deteriorating\n\nand shown a downward trend. After taking into\n\nconsideration the law on the point, the High Court\n\nconcluded that action under Fundamental Rule\n\n56(j) need not await the disposal of the\n\nrepresentation made against the ACRs and,\n\ntherefore, the order of compulsory retirement\n\npassed against him after taking into consideration\n\nthe ACR for the year 2000 was not bad in law.\n\n9. In view of the above conclusions the High Court\n\ndismissed the petition which has given rise to the\n\nabove numbered appeal.\n\n10. It may be mentioned that during the pendency of\n\nthe SLP the original petitioner that is Mr. Rajendra\n\nSingh Verma expired in October, 2009. Therefore,\nthe appeal is being prosecuted by his legal\n\nrepresentatives.\n\n11. The facts giving rise to the appeal arising out of SLP\n\n(C) No. 314 of 2009, are as under:\n\nThe appellant Mr. Purshottam Das Gupta was born on\n\n24.12.1949. He joined Delhi Judicial Service on 28.01.1978.\n\nHe was granted selection grade on 03.06.1993 retrospectively\n\nwith effect from 31.05.1991. He joined as Additional Senior\n\nCivil Judge Delhi on 06.01.1996. According to him his work\n\nand conduct from 1978 to 1992 was graded as \"B\", which\n\nmeans his performance was average. In the year 1995 the\n\nInspecting Judge reported that \"I have not inspected his\n\nCourt, but I have heard complaints about integrity\", and left\n\ncolumn nos. 6 and 7 to be filled up by Full Court. On\n\n18.05.1996 the Full Court recorded ACR for the years 1994-95\n\nas \"C-Integrity Doubtful\" and on the basis of the same denied\n\npromotion to him to Delhi Higher Judicial Service. Mr. Gupta\n\nfiled a representation against adverse ACR for the year 1994-\n\n95 on 10.07.1996. The High Court rejected the same by an\norder dated 05.09.1997. On 26.09.1997 the Full Court\n\nrecorded his ACR for the year 1996 as \"B\". He filed W.P.(C)\n\nNo. 4334 of 1997 against his non-promotion to Delhi Higher\n\nJudicial Services and also prayed to expunge adverse remark\n\nfor the year 1994-95. Pending the said petition, the Full Court\n\non 22.05.1998 recorded his ACR for the year 1997 as \"B\".\n\nW.P.(C) No. 4334 of 1997 filed by Mr. Gupta was allowed by a\n\nSingle Judge of the High Court vide Judgment dated\n\n28.05.1999 and the adverse remark for the year 1994-95 was\n\nquashed. Thereupon, he was granted deemed promotion with\n\nseniority. The High Court on its administrative side filed LPA\n\nNo. 329 of 1999 against Judgment dated 28.05.1999. On\n\n24.12.1999 he attained the age of 50 years. In July 2000 the\n\nScreening Committee had reviewed the cases of various\n\nofficers of DHJS including that of Mr. Gupta for premature\n\nretirement in public interest. The Screening Committee gave\n\nreport dated July 17, 2000. In the report it was mentioned\n\nthat the Members of the Screening Committee had gone\n\nthrough the service record including the ACR dossiers of the\n\nofficers of Delhi Higher Judicial Service and Delhi Judicial\nService who were within the zone of consideration for being\n\nconsidered for premature retirement in public interest at the\n\nage of 50/55 years, but they did not find, for the time being,\n\nany Officer who could be retired prematurely in public\n\ninterest. The Full Court considered the report of Screening\n\nCommittee in its meeting held on 22.07.2000 and accepted the\n\nreport. However, on 29.07.2000 the Full Court recorded ACR\n\nof the appellant for the year 1999 as \"C\". On ACR being\n\ncommunicated, to him, he filed representation dated\n\n08.09.2000.\n\n12. The LPA No. 329 of 1997 filed by the High Court\n\nagainst Judgment dated 28.05.1999 rendered by a\n\nSingle Judge in W.P.(C) No. 4334 of 1997 which was\n\nfiled by the appellant, was accepted by the Division\n\nBench vide Judgment dated 09.02.2001. The\n\nrecord does not indicate that the Judgment\n\nrendered by the Division Bench in LPA No. 329 of\n\n1997 was subjected to challenge by Mr. Gupta\nbefore higher forum. It may be mentioned that Mr.\n\nJustice M.S.A. Siddiqui was nominated as\n\nInspecting Judge of the court of Mr. Gupta for the\n\nyear 2000. The case of Mr. Gupta is that he had\n\nsent one copy each of his five Judgments delivered\n\nby him during the year 2001, on 18.05.2001 as was\n\nrequisitioned by the learned Inspecting Judge. The\n\nlearned Inspecting Judge retired on 29.05.2001\n\nwithout giving his report in respect of Mr. Gupta for\n\nthe year 2000. The representation made against\n\nadverse ACR for the year 1999 was rejected by the\n\nHigh Court vide order dated 01.06.2001. The\n\nrecord does not show that\nthe said decision\nwas\n\nchallenged by Mr. Gupta before higher authority or\n\nin court of law. Thus the ACR for the year 1999\n\nhad attained finality. According to Mr. Gupta, Mr.\n\nJustice K.S.Gupta who was not his inspecting\n\nJudge for any year visited his Court on 07.09.2001\n\nand directed him to send copies of three Judgments\n\ndelivered by him during 2000, which requisition\nwas complied with by him. The record would\n\nindicate that Mr. Justice K.S.Gupta submitted his\n\ninspection report for the year 2000 on 11.09.2001\n\nfor consideration of the Full Court. On 21.09.2001,\n\nthe Full Court recorded ACR of Mr. Gupta for the\n\nyear 2000 as \"C (Integrity Doubtful)\". On\n\n21.09.2001 the Screening Committee of the High\n\nCourt submitted its report recommending his\n\npremature retirement from service. The Full Court\n\nin its Meeting dated 22.09.2001 recommended\n\npremature retirement of Mr. Gupta to the Lt.\n\nGovernor of Delhi (The Administrator). On\n\n21.09.2001 he was communicated ACR for the year\n\n2000 and he was granted six weeks time to file\n\nrepresentation against the same. Meanwhile the\n\nAdministrator (Lt. Governor of Delhi) passed an\n\norder dated 27.09.2001, prematurely retiring him\n\nfrom service, under Fundamental Rule 56 (j) of the\n\nFundamental Rules read with Rule 33 of Delhi\n\nJudicial Service Rules, 1970. The appellant made a\nrepresentation against adverse entry in the ACR for\n\nthe year 2000, on 29.10.2001 i.e. after the appellant\n\nwas retired compulsorily from service. The\n\nappellant also addressed a representation dated\n\n16.11.2001 to the Administrator against the order\n\nretiring him compulsorily from the service. It was\n\nforwarded by the Administrator, to the High Court\n\nfor necessary action. The High Court by order dated\n\n12.02.2002 rejected the representation made by the\n\nappellant on 16.11.2001 which was addressed to Lt.\n\nGovernor. The representation of the appellant\n\nagainst adverse ACR for the year 2000 was also\n\nrejected by the High Court vide order dated\n\n16.03.2010. Feeling aggrieved by the order retiring\n\nhim compulsorily from service the appellant filed\n\nW.P.(C) No. 2362 of 2002 in the High Court and also\n\nprayed to expunge adverse remarks in his ACR for\n\nthe years 1999 and 2000.\n13. On service of notice the High Court filed reply\n\naffidavit controverting the averments made in the\n\npetition. It was explained in the reply that the\n\nScreening Committee of the two learned Judges had\n\nconsidered the overall service record of the\n\nappellant and found that his performance and\n\nconduct were recorded as average for the years\n\n1979-80, 1980-81, 1999, 1997 and 1998. The High\n\nCourt mentioned in the reply that in the report for\n\nthe year 1995, the Inspecting Judge had recorded\n\nthat he had heard complaints about the integrity of\n\nthe appellant. According to the High Court, again in\n\nthe inspection report for the year 1999-2000 the\n\nInspecting Judge, in respect of judicial reputation of\n\nthe appellant and in respect of his impartiality and\n\nintegrity, had recorded that the appellant did not\n\nenjoy good reputation. As per the reply, the case of\n\nthe appellant was considered for promotion\n\non18.05.1996 but he was not found fit at that time\n\nand even in the subsequent selections as a result of\nwhich he was not promoted. What was highlighted\n\nin the reply was that for the year 1994-95 the\n\nappellant was granted \"C-Integrity Doubtful\"\n\nwhereas for the year 1999 he was granted \"C (Below\n\nAverage)\" and for the year 2000 he was granted \"C-\n\nIntegrity Doubtful\", and keeping in view the over all\n\nassessment of service record, the Screening\n\nCommittee had recommended that the appellant be\n\nprematurely retired from service in public interest\n\nforthwith. It was explained in the reply that the\n\nreport of the Screening Committee with respect to\n\nnumber of Judicial Officers was placed before the\n\nFull Court of the High Court and the Full Court\n\nafter considering the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee and the work and conduct as reflected in\n\nservice record and general reputation of the\n\nappellant as well as of other officers, had resolved\n\nthat it be recommended to the Administrator,\n\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi to retire the appellant\n\nand others forthwith in public interest. The High\nCourt mentioned in the reply that the Lt. Governor\n\nhad accepted the recommendations of the High\n\nCourt and vide order dated 27.09.2001, the\n\nappellant was compulsorily retired in public\n\ninterest. It was further stated in the reply that the\n\nappellant had preferred a representation before the\n\nLt. Governor who after going through his service\n\nrecord including assessments made by the\n\nInspecting Judge along with the recommendations\n\nof the Screening Committee and the resolution of\n\nthe Full Court of the High Court had concluded that\n\nthe appellant was not fit to be continued in service\n\nand his representation was rejected by order dated\n\n13.09.2001 which was communicated to him vide\n\norder dated 27.09.2002.\n\n14. The High Court after hearing the learned Counsel\n\nfor the parties concluded that so far as ACR for the\n\nyear 1999-2000 was concerned, there was hardly\n\nany reason to interfere with the same. The High\nCourt noted that the ACR for the year 1994-95\n\nrecording \"C-Integrity Doubtful\" was upheld by the\n\nHigh Court, on judicial side, on the ground that\n\nthere was sufficient material to record the said ACR.\n\nAccording to the High Court the Judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench of the Delhi High Court in L.P.A.\n\nwas upheld by the Supreme Court which operated\n\nas res-judicata so far as the appellant was\n\nconcerned. The High Court, on the basis of said\n\nfact, came to the conclusion that the action of the\n\nHigh Court on its administrative side, to\n\ncompulsorily retire the appellant from service would\n\nbe sustainable as easing out a person with integrity\n\ndoubtful. The High Court noticed that so far as the\n\nACR for the year 1999 was concerned the appellant\n\nwas given \"C\" grading i.e. below average and\n\nrepresentation made by him was rejected by the\n\nFull Court in its Meeting held on 19.05.2001. High\n\nCourt after looking into the over all career profile of\n\nthe appellant held that it was totally untenable to\nallege that there was any bias or mala fide against\n\nhim.\n\n15. In view of the above mentioned conclusions the\n\nHigh Court rejected the petition.\n\n16. Thereupon, the petitioner filed Review Petition\n\nbefore the High Court. However, the same was\n\nwithdrawn with a view to filing SLP against\n\nJudgment delivered by High Court in W.P.(C) No.\n\n2362 of 2002. After withdrawing the review\n\napplication, the appellant filed Special Leave\n\nPetition no. 314 of 2009 which on leave being\n\ngranted is treated as an appeal.\n\n17. The facts of the appeal arising out of Special Leave\n\nto Appeal No.27200 of 2008 are as under :-\n\nThe appellant, i.e., Mr. M.S. Rohilla was appointed as\n\nCivil/Sub. Judge, in the Subordinate Judicial Services under\n\nthe Government of Delhi on May 05, 1972. On June 17, 1975\n\nhe was confirmed as an officer in the Delhi Judicial Services.\nHe was granted benefit of Selection Grade on June 3, 1980\n\nand was promoted to the Higher Judicial Services as\n\nAdditional District & Sessions Judge on November 1, 1989.\n\nOne anonymous complaint was received against him and, after\n\nlooking into the same, he was reverted to Subordinate Judicial\n\nServices, as Civil/Sub. Judge by order dated February 15,\n\n1995. Feeling aggrieved, he had preferred W.P. No. 4589 of\n\n1995, challenging his reversion. Meanwhile, he was served\n\nwith a communication from the High Court of Delhi dated\n\nOctober 23, 1997 wherein his A.C.R. for the year 1996 was\n\ngraded as `C'. Thereupon he made a representation dated\n\nDecember 3, 1997 against the said grading. The\n\nrepresentation made by him was rejected on December 2,\n\n1998. The record does not show that any steps were taken by\n\nhim to challenge order dated December 2, 1998 by which his\n\nrepresentation against ACR for the year 1996 was rejected.\n\n18. Thereafter he received a communication from the\n\nHigh Court in the year 1999 whereby he was\n\ninformed that in his A.C.R. for the year 1997, he\nwas awarded `B' remark. Again by a\n\ncommunication dated February 9, 2000 forwarded\n\nby the High Court he was informed that in his ACR\n\nfor the year 1998 he was graded `B'. He made a\n\nrepresentation against his ACR for the year 1998 in\n\nthe year 2000. In July, 2000 the Screening\n\nCommittee consisting of Hon'ble Judges of the High\n\nCourt of Delhi reviewed the case of the appellant\n\nwith that of several other judicial officers. As\n\nobserved earlier, the deliberations made by the\n\nScreening Committee indicate that it did not find,\n\nfor the time being, any officer who could be retired\n\nprematurely in public interest as on July 17, 2000.\n\nA copy of the abstracts from the Minutes of the\n\nmeeting of the Full Court of High Court of Delhi\n\nheld on July 22, 2000 produced on the record of the\n\ncase, indicates that Full Court had accepted the\n\nreport of the Screening Committee. In July, 2000\n\nhe received a communication from the High Court\n\nmentioning that his ACR for the year 1999 was\ngraded as `B'. On 21.9.2001 he received a\n\ncommunication from the High Court with reference\n\nto the ACR for the year 2000 whereby he was\n\ninformed that he was given Grade `C'. It was further\n\nmentioned therein that his integrity was found\n\ndoubtful. By the said communication, he was given\n\nsix weeks time to make a representation against the\n\nsaid grading. According to Mr. Rohilla, when he\n\nwas awaiting the response to his previous\n\nrepresentations made with reference to the ACRs for\n\nthe years 1998 and 1999 and when he was yet to\n\nrespond to the ACR for the year 2000, he received\n\ncommunication dated September 27, 2001 from the\n\nHigh Court prematurely retiring him from service\n\nunder rule 56(j) of the fundamental Rules read with\n\nRule 33 of the Delhi Subordinate Judicial Services.\n\nAccording to him he made a representation\n\nrequesting the respondents to supply the material\n\nupon which decision was taken to prematurely\n\nretire him from service. As he was called upon to\nmake a representation against the ACR for the year\n\n2000 within six weeks from the date of\n\ncommunication dated 21.9.2001, he filed\n\nrepresentation dated November 3, 2001 against the\n\nsame but of no avail. Ultimately, in the month of\n\nMarch 2002 he filed W.P. No. 1965 of 2002\n\nchallenging order of his compulsory retirement from\n\nservice. Pending the said Writ Petition, the Full\n\nBench of the High Court hearing W.P. No. 4589 of\n\n1995 which was directed against the order of his\n\nreversion dated February 15, 1995, allowed the\n\nsame by judgment dated May 29, 2006. The result\n\nwas that he stood reinstated to his post of\n\nAdditional District Judge under Higher Judicial\n\nServices.\n\n19. As is evident from the memorandum of the writ\n\npetition, the order retiring him compulsorily from\n\nservice was challenged on several grounds. On\n\nnotice being served the respondents namely the\nLieutenant Governor as well Delhi High Court had\n\nfiled their separate counter affidavits controverting\n\nthe claims advanced by Mr. Rohilla in his writ\n\npetition. It was emphasized in the counter affidavit\n\nfiled on behalf of the High Court that the petition\n\nfiled by Mr. Rohilla proceeded on a mistaken\n\nassumption and incorrect presumption that he was\n\nretired compulsorily from service only upon\n\nconsideration of adverse remark `C-' recorded\n\nindicating that his integrity was doubtful for the\n\nyear 2000. It was mentioned in the reply that the\n\nFull Court as also the Screening Committee\n\nconsisting of the two learned Judges of the Delhi\n\nHigh Court, had considered his entire service record\n\nwhich revealed that his performance as a judicial\n\nofficer was either average or below average and his\n\nintegrity was found doubtful and despite the\n\npassage of time, nothing was done by him to\n\nimprove his performance/image. The reply affidavit\n\nproceeded to mention that in so far as the case of\nMr. Rohilla was concerned, in its report dated\n\nSeptember 21, 2001 the Screening Committee had\n\ninter alia recorded as under :\n\n\"The officer has earned throughout his career\n\n`B' (Average) or C (Below Average) or `C' (Below\n\nAverage-Integrity doubtful) reports except for\n\nthree years i.e. 1979-80, 1981-82 and 1988\n\nwhen he could earn only B+ (Good) and for the\n\nyears 1997, 1998 and 1999 when he could\n\nearn `B' reports. In the inspection note dated\n\n29th March 1973, the concerned Hon'ble\n\nInspecting Judge observed that he needed to\n\nbe watched so far as his efficiency as a\n\nJudicial Officer was concerned. The District &\n\nSessions Judge, Delhi, in his report dated\n\n31.5.1973 for the year 1972-73, mentioned\n\nthat \"a complaint was pending against him in\n\nthe High Court about the return of ornaments\n\nin a theft case to a party which was not\n\nentitled\". Further, as directed by a Single\n\nBench of this Court by its order dated\n\n24.7.1973 passed in Criminal Revision No.\n\n428/72 in re:\nRamavtar Vs. State\n, the findings\n\nof the District & Sessions Judge, Delhi,\n\nregarding the conduct of Mr. M.S. Rohilla, then\n\nworking as Judicial Magistrate, First Class,\n\nwere placed on his personal file. It had been\n\nnoted in the aforesaid findings of the District &\n\nSessions Judge, that Mr. M.S. Rohilla should\n\nnot have shown so much indecent haste in\n\npassing the order for handing over the\n\nornaments to Jawahar Lal Gupta. Though, the\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge, Delhi, did not find\n\nany malafide on the part of Mr. M.S. Rohilla,\n\nstill according to him, he acted in a most\ninjudicious manner due to his inexperience\n\nand suppression of the material facts by the\n\nS.H.O. while sending the report in the above\n\nnoted case. The Full Court recorded `C' (Below\n\nAverage) remarks for the year 1972-73).\n\nIn the Inspection Report dated 29.4.1978\n\nfor the year 1977-78, the District & Sessions\n\nJudge, Delhi, observed regarding the\n\nreputation for honesty and impartiality of the\n\nofficer that there were complaints of which the\n\nHigh Court was seized then. In the Inspection\n\nReport dated 7.12.1985, for the year 1983-84,\n\nhis efficiency as Judicial Officer was termed as\n\na mediocre. As regards his reputation for\n\nhonesty and impartiality, the District &\n\nSessions Judge observed that he must improve\n\nhis reputation which suffered a set back when\n\nhe was Additional Rent Controller. In\n\nInspection Report for the same year, the\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge, Delhi, reported that\n\nhe did not enjoy good reputation for honesty\n\namong lawyers and general public and that he\n\nwas in the habit of drinking and gambling\n\nalmost daily. In the Inspection Report dated\n\n7.12.1985 for the year 1984-85, the concerned\n\nHon'ble Inspecting Judge had observed that\n\nhis reputation was under cloud although no\n\nspecific instance of corruption had come to his\n\nnotice, but watch was called for.\n\nFollowing adverse remarks were recorded\n\non the work and conduct of Sh. M.S. Rohilla\n\nfor the years mentioned against each :-\n\nYears Adverse Remarks\n\n1972-73 `C' (Below Average)\n\n1993 `C' (Below Average)\n\n(Integrity doubtful)\n1994 `C' (Below Average)\n\n(Integrity doubtful)\n\n1994 `C' (Below Average)\n\n(Integrity doubtful)\n\n1995 `C' (Below Average)\n\n1996 `C' (Below Average)\n\n2000 (Integrity doubtful)\n\nKeeping in view the over all record of the\n\nofficer, we recommend that Mr. M.S. Rohilla be\n\nprematurely retired in public interest\n\nforthwith.\"\n\n20. According to the High Court it was on this basis\n\nthat the case of Mr. Rohilla was recommended for\n\npremature retirement in public interest which\n\nrecommendation was accepted by the Full Court.\n\n21. It may be stated that the entire service record of Mr.\n\nRohilla was called for by the Division Bench. After\n\ntaking holistic view of the matter and the facts\n\nprojected in the counter affidavit of the High Court,\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court expressed\n\nirresistible opinion that Mr. Rohilla was rightly\n\nretired compulsorily from service under FR 56 (j) of\n\nFundamental Rules. According to the High Court, it\n\nwas totally misconceived and untenable on the part\nof Mr. Rohilla to argue that the so-called material\n\nrelied upon was only one sided view or it was not\n\nknown what was the material placed before the\n\nHigh Court before decision to retire him\n\ncompulsorily from service was taken. The High\n\nCourt found that there was no force in the\n\ncontention that his case could have been considered\n\nfor the purpose of compulsory retirement only in the\n\nyear 2001 when he was about to attain the age of\n\n55 years in the year 2002. The High Court further\n\nconcluded that it was also a wrong premise adopted\n\nby Mr. Rohilla that the High Court had based its\n\ndecision solely on the basis of his ACR for the year\n\n2000 wherein it was recorded that his integrity was\n\ndoubtful. What was concluded by the High Court\n\nwas that the exercise undertaken clearly revealed\n\nthat his entire service record was taken into\n\nconsideration. In view of the above-mentioned\n\nconclusions as well as other findings, the High\n\nCourt has rejected the writ petition filed by Mr.\nRohilla giving rise to the appeal by him.\n\n22. It is relevant to notice that though each appeal will\n\nhave to be decided on its own facts, certain common\n\npoints were raised in three appeals by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants for consideration of this\n\nCourt. Therefore this Court proposes to deal with\n\nthose common points raised by the learned counsel\n\nfor the appellants for consideration.\n\n23. Normally, an aggrieved civil servant can challenge\n\nan order of compulsory retirement on any of the\n\nfollowing grounds, namely, (a) that the requisite\n\nopinion has not been formed, or (b) that the\n\ndecision is based on collateral grounds, or (c) that it\n\nis an arbitrary decision. If the civil servant is able\n\nto establish that the order of compulsory retirement\n\nsuffers from any of the above infirmities, the court\n\nhas jurisdiction to quash the same. In the light of\n\nthe above stated position of law, the present appeals\n\nwill have to be considered.\n24. The first point which was argued was that once a\n\nreview was conducted by the Screening Committee\n\nof the High Court on 17.7.2000 on the appellants'\n\nreaching the age of 50 years, which was accepted by\n\nthe Full Court, no second review on the same\n\nmaterial was permissible and the service record of\n\nthe appellants for compulsory retirement, could\n\nhave been reviewed only upon their reaching the age\n\nof 55 years and not before reaching the said age.\n\nWhat was maintained was that the Screening\n\nCommittee as well as the Full Court had considered\n\nthe entire service record of the appellants and found\n\nthat there was no material to recommend\n\ncompulsory retirement of any of them as a result of\n\nwhich the previous record of each appellant before\n\nJuly, 2000 could not have been again considered for\n\ncompulsory retirement. According to the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants, the effect of decision of\n\nthe Full Court of the High Court dated July, 22,\n\n2000 reflected in its resolution, passed on the\nrecommendation of the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee dated July 17, 2000, which was\n\nsubmitted after considering the entire service\n\nrecords and ACR Dossiers of each of the appellant,\n\nnot to retire any of them prematurely, was that\n\nthere was a bar to consider again the case of the\n\nappellants for premature retirement and, therefore,\n\nthe order of compulsory retirement was liable to be\n\nset aside.\nIn support of this plea, reliance was\n\nplaced on the decision of this Court in\nState of U.P.\n\nVs. Chandra Mohan Nigam & Others\n(1977) 4\n\nSCC 345.\n\n25. In reply to the above mentioned argument, it was\n\npointed out by the learned Counsel for the High\n\nCourt that the decision of the Committee dated July\n\n17, 2000 was purely tentative in nature and was not\n\na final decision. According to the learned counsel\n\nfor the High Court, the use of the expression \"for\n\nthe time being\" in the Minutes of the Committee\nwould show that it was not a final decision meaning\n\nthereby the matters were to be considered in detail\n\non a later date and final decision was to be taken\n\nlater on. What was maintained was that the\n\ndecision of the Committee dated July 17, 2000 was\n\nnot a decision dealing each officer separately but\n\ngeneral in nature and, therefore the phrase \"for the\n\ntime being\" should be construed to mean that it was\n\nnot a final decision and the cases of the appellants\n\nwere deferred for being considered in future.\n\nElaborating this contention, it was submitted that\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court has\n\nconsidered the question as to whether it was\n\nconsideration on merits or a case of deferment and\n\nrightly held that the exercise done in July 2000 was\n\nnot final and the cases of the appellants were\n\ndeferred. According to the learned counsel, the\n\nHigh Court, in the impugned judgment, was\n\nperfectly justified in holding that there was no\n\nconsideration on merits of the cases of the\nappellants before 21.9.2001, and, therefore, the\n\norders passed in cases of the appellants retiring\n\nthem compulsorily from service were not bad in law.\n\nWithout prejudice to above mentioned contention, it\n\nwas argued that even if it was assumed for the sake\n\nof argument that there was consideration of the\n\ncases of the appellants in July, 2000, even then\n\nthere was no legal bar in again considering their\n\ncases in next year particularly when it had come to\n\nthe notice of the High Court that their integrity was\n\ndoubtful. The learned counsel for the High Court\n\nemphasized that in\nState of U.P. Vs. Chandra\n\nMohan Nigam and others\n(Supra) there was\n\nconsideration of cases of the respondents therein for\n\ncompulsory retirement at the age of 50 years and\n\nnext consideration could have been only at the age\n\nof 55 years but in the said case an exception to this\n\nrule is carved out, namely, if material in regard to\n\ndoubtful integrity of the officer comes to light, the\n\nauthority need not wait till the officer attains the\nage of 55 years and action can be taken\n\nimmediately.\n\nPlacing reliance on the decision of this\n\nCourt in\nGovernment of T.N. Vs. P.A. Manickam\n\n(1996) 8 SCC 519, it was argued that the\n\nconsideration of an employee for compulsory\n\nretirement at the age of 50 years is only the starting\n\npoint and not the end point, and, therefore, after 50\n\nyears at any time case of an officer can be\n\nconsidered for compulsory retirement.\n\nThe learned\n\ncounsel brought to the notice of this Court, the\n\nobservations made in\nNawal Singh Vs. State of\n\nU.P. and another\n(2003) 8 SCC 117 to the effect\n\nthat \"the nature of judicial service is such that it\n\ncannot afford to suffer continuance in service of\n\npersons of doubtful integrity or who have lost their\n\nutility\" and argued that it was always open to the\n\nHigh Court to consider the case of the appellants at\n\nany point of time though earlier a decision was\n\ntaken not to retire any of the appellants\n\ncompulsorily from service in the public interest.\nAccording to the learned counsel for the High Court\n\nthe consideration of the cases of the appellants in\n\nSeptember, 2001 was in fact not a review of the\n\nearlier decision taken by the Screening Committee\n\nin July 2000 but it was a fresh consideration and\n\non review of record of service of the appellants the\n\nHigh Court was justified in retiring the appellants\n\ncompulsorily from service. Placing reliance on the\n\ndecision in\nHaryana State Electricity Board Vs.\n\nK.C. Gambhir\n(1997) 7 SCC 85, it was pointed out\n\nthat therein the case of the officer was considered at\n\nthe age of 50 years and he was permitted to\n\ncontinue in service and again his case was\n\nconsidered at the age of 55 years and he was\n\npermitted to continue in service but he was\n\ncompulsorily retired at the age of 57 years and such\n\na decision was upheld by this Court by rejecting the\n\nplea that his case could have been considered only\n\nagain at the age of 60 years.\n26. This Court has considered the rival contentions\n\nraised by the learned counsel for the parties on the\n\nquestion whether the cases of the appellants for\n\ncompulsory retirement, could have been considered\n\nagain before they had reached the age of 55 years,\n\nwhen the Screening Committee had already\n\nconsidered their cases for compulsory retirement on\n\ntheir attaining the age of 50 years on July 17, 2000,\n\nand had not recommended their compulsory\n\nretirement which recommendation was accepted by\n\nthe Full Court of the High Court.\n\n27. In this connection it is relevant to notice certain\n\nfacts emerging from the record of the case. Rule 27\n\nof the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1970\n\nprovides that in respect of matters regarding the\n\nconditions of service for which no provision or\n\ninsufficient provision has been made in those rules,\n\nthe rules, directions or orders for the time being in\n\nforce, and applicable to the officers of comparable\nstatus in the Indian Administrative Service and\n\nserving in connection with the affairs of the Union of\n\nIndia, shall regulate the conditions of such service.\n\nThus Rule 16(3) of the All India Services (Death-\n\ncum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 (`the Rules of\n\n1958' for short) would be applicable to the officers of\n\nthe Delhi Higher Judicial Service. Clause (3) of Rule\n\n16 of the Rules of 1958 was substituted in 1972\n\nspecifying the age of premature retirement to be 50.\n\nRule 16(3), after its substitution, reads as under: -\n\n\"16 (3) The Central Government may, in\n\nconsultation with the State Government\n\nconcerned and after giving a member of the\n\nService at least three months, previous notice\n\nin writing, or three months pay and allowance\n\nin lieu of such notice, require that member to\n\nretire in public interest from service on the\n\ndate on which such member completes thirty\n\nyears of qualifying service or attains fifty years\n\nof age or on any date thereafter to be specified\n\nin the notice.\"\n\nTherefore, the matter regarding pre-mature retirement of\n\nofficers of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service who have\n\ncompleted 30 years of qualifying service or attained 50 years of\nage, has to be reviewed in the light of Rule 16(3) of the Rules of\n\n1958 quoted above.\n\n28. Similarly, in case of officer of Delhi Judicial Service,\n\nRule 33 of Delhi Judicial Service Rules, 1970\n\nprovides that in respect of all such matters\n\nregarding the conditions of service for which no\n\nprovision or insufficient provision has been made in\n\nthe Rules, the Rules or orders for the time being in\n\nforce, and applicable to Government servants\n\nholding corresponding posts in connection with the\n\naffairs of the Union of India, shall regulate the\n\nconditions of such service.\n\n29. In Delhi Judicial Service Rules, 1970, no provision\n\nfor compulsory retirement has been made.\n\nTherefore, Fundamental Rule 56(j), which is, for the\n\ntime being in force and applicable to Government\n\nservants holding corresponding posts envisaged\n\nunder the Delhi Judicial Service Rules, 1970, shall\n\nregulate the matter of compulsory retirement of\nofficers of Delhi Judicial Service. Fundamental Rule\n\n56(j), which is applicable to officers of Delhi Judicial\n\nService, reads as under:-\n\n\"(j) Notwithstanding anything contained in this\n\nrule, the appropriate authority shall, if it is of\n\nthe opinion that it is in the public interest so\n\nto do, have the absolute right to retire any\n\nGovernment servant by giving him notice of\n\nnot less than three months in writing or three\n\nmonths pay and allowances in lieu of such\n\nnotice:\n\n(i) if he is in Group `A' or Group `B' service\n\nor post in a substantive, quasi permanent\n\nor temporary capacity and had entered\n\nGovernment service before attaining the\n\nage of 35 years, after he has attained the\n\nage of 50 years;\n\n(ii) in any other case after he has attained\n\nthe age of fifty-five years.\n\nProvided that nothing in this clause shall\n\napply to a Government servant referred to in\n\nclause (e), who entered Government service on\n\nor before the 23rd July, 1966.\"\n\nIt would be seen that FR 56(j) gives absolute rights to the\n\nappropriate authority to retire any government servant who\n\nentered the service before attaining the age of 35 years, after\n\nhe has attained the age of 50 years.\n30. The cases of the officers of Delhi Higher Judicial\n\nService and Delhi Judicial Service were laid before\n\nthe Screening Committee constituted by the\n\nAdministrative Committee vide its resolution dated\n\nDecember 15, 1992 and also for laying down the\n\nguidelines before reviewing the cases of direct\n\nrecruits. The Screening Committee decided as\n\nunder :-\n\n\"Government Rules be applied.\"\n\n31. It may be stated that after reviewing the cases of the\n\nofficers of Delhi Higher Judicial Service and Delhi\n\nJudicial Service upto 31.12.1994, the Full Court in\n\nits meeting held on February 7, 1996 had taken the\n\nfollowing decision :-\n\n\"It was decided that for screening of the cases\n\nof the officers of the Delhi Higher Judicial\n\nService and Delhi Judicial Services, now falling\n\nwithin the zone of consideration for retirement\n\nin public interest, a Screening Committee\n\nconsisting of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Jaspal Singh\n\nand Hon'ble Mr. Justice J.K. Mehra be\n\nconstituted and the report of the Committee be\n\nlaid before the Full Court for consideration.\"\nConsequent upon the retirement of Hon'ble Mr. Justice J.K.\n\nMehra, it was decided to reconstitute the composition of the\n\nScreening Committee by Full Court in its meeting held on\n\nJanuary 17, 1998. The aforesaid reconstituted Screening\n\nCommittee reviewed the cases of several judicial officers in its\n\nmeeting held on July 17, 2000 and gave its report which reads\n\nas under: -\n\n\"We have gone through the service record\n\nincluding the ACR dossiers of the officers of\n\nDelhi Higher Judicial Service and Delhi\n\nJudicial Service who are within the zone of\n\nconsideration for being considered for\n\npremature retirement in public interest at the\n\nage of 50/55 years.\n\nWe do not find, for the time being, any officer\n\nwho can be retired prematurely in public\n\ninterest.\"\n\n32. As ordered by the then Hon'ble the Chief Justice of\n\nthe Delhi High Court, the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee was to be laid before the Full Court for\n\nconsideration and orders.\n33. In the meeting of the Full Court held on July 22,\n\n2000 the report of the Screening Committee was\n\nconsidered. The true copy of extracts from the\n\nMinutes of the Meeting of the Full Court held on\n\nSaturday, the July 22, 2000 at 11.00 A.M. in the\n\nJudge Court reads as under :-\n\n\"Agenda : 6. To review the case of the officers\n\nof DHJS and DJS who are within the zone of\n\nconsideration for being considered for\n\npremature retirement in public interest -\n\nReport dated 17.7.2000 of the Screening\n\nCommittee consisting of Hon'ble Mr. Justice\n\nArun Kumar and Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.K.\n\nMahajan constituted pursuant to Full Court\n\ndecision dated 17.01.1998.\n\nMinutes : \"The report of the Committee was\n\naccepted.\"\n\n34. On a fair reading of the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee quoted above read with the resolution\n\nadopted by the Full Court in its meeting dated July\n\n22, 2000, it becomes evident that the cases of the\n\nappellants alone for premature retirement were not\n\nconsidered but cases of all the officers of Delhi\n\nHigher Judicial Service as well as that of officers\nbelonging to Delhi Judicial Service who were within\n\nthe zone of consideration for being considered for\n\npremature retirement in public interest at the age of\n\n50/55 years were also considered. The record of\n\nthe case would indicate that cases of number of\n\nofficers belonging to Delhi Higher Judicial Service\n\nand Delhi Judicial Service were considered on one\n\nday, and that too, in the Meeting of the Screening\n\nCommittee held on July 17, 2000. The record\n\nindicates that case of each officer was not\n\nconsidered individually. No reasons could be\n\nrecorded by the Screening Committee as to how\n\nearlier entries adversely reflecting on the integrity of\n\nthe appellants, were dealt with or viewed. Under\n\nthe circumstances, the observation that \"We do not\n\nfind, for the time being, any officer who can be\n\nretired prematurely in public interest\" will have to\n\nbe regarded as tentative and not final in nature.\n\nWhen the Screening Committee stated that it did\n\nnot find for the time being any officer who could be\nretired prematurely in public interest, it meant that\n\nthe cases of all the officers were deferred to be\n\nconsidered in near future. It would be seen that FR\n\n56(j) gives absolute right to the appropriate\n\nauthority to retire any Government servant who has\n\nentered the service before attaining the age of 35\n\nyears, after he has attained the age of 50 years and\n\nin other cases after he has attained the age of 55\n\nyears. There is no rule prohibiting consideration of\n\ncase of an officer for compulsory retirement before\n\nhe attains the age of 55 years, even if his case is\n\nearlier considered at the age of 50 years. There is\n\nnothing in the Delhi Judicial Service Rules or Delhi\n\nHigher Judicial Service Rules or the Indian\n\nAdministrative Service Rules laying down a\n\nprohibition that if the case of an officer for\n\ncompulsory retirement is considered at the age of\n\n50 years, his case cannot be reconsidered till he\n\nattains the age of 55 years. As held by this Court in\n\nGovernment of T.N.\n(Supra), 50 years is only the\nstarting point and not the end point which means\n\nthat after 50 years at any time case of an officer can\n\nbe considered for compulsory retirement.\n\n35.\nIn\nState of U.P. Vs. Chandra Mohan Nigam and\n\nOthers\n(1977) 4 SCC 345, the facts were that the\n\nrespondent, i.e., Mr. Chandra Mohan Nigam was\n\nrecruited in the Indian Administrative Service in\n\nUttar Pradesh Cadre. He joined service on March\n\n23, 1947. He was appointed as Judicial Member of\n\nthe Board of Revenue in 1969 and had attained the\n\nage of 50 years on December 29, 1967. By an order\n\ndated August 22, 1970 the President of India, in\n\nconsultation with the Government of Uttar Pradesh,\n\nin pursuance of the power conferred by sub-rule (3)\n\nof Rule 16 of the All India Services (Death-cum-\n\nRetirement Benefits) Rules 1958 had passed the\n\norder of compulsory retirement of the respondent in\n\nthe public interest on the expiry of three months\n\nfrom the date of service of the order. That was\nchallenged by Mr. Chandra Mohan Nigam by a writ\n\npetition before the Allahabad High Court. The\n\nlearned Single Judge had allowed the same on the\n\ngrounds of contravention of the justiciable and\n\nbinding rules and because the order was based on\n\nconsideration of irrelevant matters and was also\n\nvitiated by bias.\n\nFeeling aggrieved both the Union of India and the State of\n\nU.P. had appealed to the Division Bench of the High Court.\n\nThe Division Bench of the High Court by an order dated April\n\n13, 1973, dismissed both the appeals by a common judgment.\n\nThe Division Bench had not agreed with all the reasons given\n\nby the learned Single Judge and had quashed the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement holding that the decision of the Central\n\nGovernment to retire Mr. Nigam was passed on collateral facts\n\nand was, therefore, invalid.\n\n36. In appeals by certificates, this Court had noticed\n\nthe service career of the respondent. It was noticed\n\nthat the respondent during his service career, had\nthe following adverse entries in his character role -\n\n(1) A warning was administered to him on December\n\n6, 1953, for taking undue interest in the ejectment\n\nof tenants from a house owned by him at Lucknow,\n\n(2) another warning was issued to him on August\n\n31, 1962, for having acquired a car from Varanasi\n\nCorporation while working as the Administrator of\n\nthe said Corporation, (3) he was once warned for not\n\nobserving proper rules and procedure for utilizing\n\nthe fund earmarked for lower-income group housing\n\nscheme towards the construction of a market (1956-\n\n1957) and (4) he was placed under suspension in\n\n1964 in connection with some strictures passed on\n\nhim by the Election Tribunal in a case relating to\n\nthe Gorakhpur Parliamentary Constituency\n\nelections.\n\n37. With regard to the last entry, he had filed appeal\n\nbefore High Court and the strictures were expunged\n\nupon which the order of suspension was set aside\nand he was reinstated in service. However, the\n\naforesaid entry continued to be part of his character\n\nroll at least till December 20, 1969. In pursuance of\n\nsub-Rule (3) of Rule 16 and in consonance with the\n\ncertain instructions, the State Government of U.P.\n\nin October 1969 had constituted a Review\n\nCommittee to review the records of the members of\n\nthe Service who were to attain or had attained the\n\nage of 50 years. The list of officers considered by\n\nthis Committee had included the respondent Mr.\n\nNigam. The Committee had not recommended any\n\nof the Officers including Mr. Nigam for premature\n\nretirement and, on the other hand, had\n\nrecommended that they should be continued in\n\nservice. The State Government had accepted the\n\nreport of the Review Committee and communicated\n\nits decision to the Central Government. On\n\nDecember 20, 1969, the Secretary, Ministry of\n\nHome affairs of the Central Government had\n\naddressed a letter wherein a reference was made to\nthe adverse remarks in the character roll of Mr.\n\nNigam including suspension of Mr. Nigam which\n\nwas set aside on strictures being expunged by the\n\nHigh Court, and a view was expressed that his was\n\na fit case in which proposal for his premature\n\nretirement under Rule 16(3) of the All India Services\n\n(Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958\n\nshould have been considered. After noticing the\n\nfact that the State Government had not\n\nrecommended the compulsory retirement the letter\n\nproceeded to mention that the Central Government\n\nwas not knowing if there were any particular\n\nreasons for taking a different view or whether it was\n\na case of over-sight. By the said letter the Central\n\nGovernment had expressed opinion to have the\n\nconsidered views of the State Government before\n\nany decision was taken by the Central Government.\n\nOn January 29, 1970, the Chief Secretary to the\n\nState Government had replied that the Review\n\nCommittee had considered the character roll and\nthe merits of the case of Mr. Nigam and found that\n\nhe was suitable for continuing in service, and that\n\nthe decision of the Committee was accepted by the\n\nState Government. In the reply, it was mentioned\n\nthat the State Government's decision in the matter\n\nwas taken after thorough consideration and that the\n\nState Government did not consider it necessary to\n\ngo into this question again. No adverse decision\n\ncontrary to the recommendation of the State\n\nGovernment was taken and communicated by the\n\nCentral Government to the State Government in\n\npursuance of the recommendation of the first\n\nReview Committee in October, 1969. However, the\n\nState Government, on its own motion, constituted a\n\nsecond Review Committee in May 1970. Again\n\nbefore this Committee also the case of all the\n\nofficers who had attained the age of 50 years\n\nincluding those whose cases had been reviewed\n\nearlier in October 1969 was also placed for\n\nconsideration.\nThus Mr. Nigam\n's case was\nconsidered again by the Second Review Committee.\n\nThis time the Committee recommended that the two\n\nofficers one of whom was Mr. Nigam should be\n\nprematurely retired. The State Government having\n\naccepted this recommendation forwarded the same\n\nto the Central Government. The Central\n\nGovernment asked the State Government to send\n\nthe proceeding of the Review Committee and on\n\nreceipt of the proceedings, the Central Government\n\nagreed with the views of the State Government and\n\npassed the order of compulsory retirement of Mr.\n\nNigam.\n\n38. It is in the light of these facts that this Court made\n\nfollowing observations in paragraph 29 of the\n\nreported decision which read as under :\n\n\"29. The correct position that emerges from Rule\n\n16(3) read with the procedural instructions is that\n\nthe Central Government, after consultation with the\n\nState Government, may prematurely retire a civil\n\nservant with three months' previous notice prior to\n\nhis attaining 50 years or 55 years, as the case may\n\nbe. The only exception is of those cases which had\n\nto be examined for the first time after amendment of\nthe rule substituting 50 years for 55 years where\n\neven officers, who had crossed the age of 50 years,\n\neven before reaching 55, could be for the first time\n\nreviewed. Once a review has taken place and no\n\ndecision to retire on that review has been ordered by\n\nthe Central Government, the officer gets a lease in\n\nthe case of 50 years upto the next barrier at 55 and,\n\nif he is again cleared at that point, he is free and\n\nuntrammelled upto 58 which is his usual span of\n\nthe service career. This is the normal rule subject\n\nalways to exceptional circumstances such as\n\ndisclosure of fresh objectionable grounds with\n\nregard to integrity or some other reasonably weighty\n\nreason.\"\n\n39. So far as present case is concerned, no final\n\ndecision was taken by the Screening Committee in\n\ncase of any officer of Delhi Higher Judicial Service\n\nand Delhi Judicial Service, but a tentative decision\n\nwas taken that at that stage no officer was found fit\n\nwho could have been retired compulsorily from\n\nservice. This is not a case wherein a review had\n\ntaken place and a positive final decision to continue\n\nthe appellants in service, was taken by the\n\nScreening Committee.\nIn the case of\nChandra\n\nMohan Nigam\n(Supra), the case of Mr. Nigam was\n\nconsidered positively for retirement but a specific\nrecommendation was made to continue him in\n\nservice, by the Review Committee which was\n\naccepted by the State Government and except\n\nexpressing an opinion that having regard to certain\n\nadverse remarks in his character roll, this was a fit\n\ncase in which proposal for his premature retirement\n\nshould have been considered, the Central\n\nGovernment, after receipt of reply from the State\n\nGovernment, had not taken any adverse decision\n\ncontrary to the recommendation of the State\n\nGovernment, which was in turn based on the\n\nrecommendation of the First Review Committee.\n\nFurther, in\nChandra Mohan Nigam\n's case itself this\n\nCourt has in para 27 of the reported decision\n\nhastened to add that when integrity of an officer is\n\nin question, that will be an exceptional\n\ncircumstance for which order may be passed in\n\nrespect of such an officer under Rule 16(3), at any\n\ntime, if other conditions of that rule are fulfilled\n\napart from the choice of disciplinary action which\nwill also be open to the Government.\n\nThus an\n\nexception to the rule, that if there is consideration\n\nat the age of 50, next consideration can be only at\n\nthe age of 55 is made in\nChandra Mohan Nigam\n's\n\ncase itself by holding that if material in regard to\n\ndoubtful integrity of the officer comes to light, the\n\nauthority need not wait till the officer attains the\n\nage of 55 years and action can be taken\n\nimmediately. The integrity of all the three Judicial\n\nOfficers was found to be doubtful and, therefore,\n\ntheir compulsory retirement from service cannot be\n\nheld to be illegal.\n\n40. At this stage, a reference may be made to the\n\ndecision of this Court in\nHaryana State Electricity\n\nBoard vs. K.C. Gambhir\n(1997) 7 SCC 85. Though\n\nthe decision may not be strictly applicable to the\n\nfacts of the present cases, but certain observations\n\nmade therein are relevant to understand the issue\nposed for consideration of this Court in the present\n\nappeals.\n\nThe respondent therein was an employee of Haryana\n\nState Electricity Board. He was promoted as Executive\n\nEngineer on February 19, 1977. When he attained the age of\n\n50 years, his case for compulsory retirement was reviewed on\n\nNovember 30, 1986. His integrity was reported doubtful in the\n\nyear 1985-86, yet it was decided not to retire him compulsorily\n\nbecause his representation against adverse remarks was\n\npending. On attaining 55 years of age, his case for\n\ncompulsory retirement was again reviewed on November 30,\n\n1991. AT that time also, departmental proceedings were\n\npending against him for a serious act of misconduct and,\n\ntherefore, it was decided not to retire him. The enquiry was\n\nover on August 4, 1993 and thereafter, he was compulsorily\n\nretired on February 3, 1994 by giving him three months'\n\nnotice. The retirement came nine months before his date of\n\nsuperannuation. Thus, on two earlier occasions, it was\n\ndecided not to retire him compulsorily, but on third occasion,\norder of compulsory retirement was passed. The order of\n\ncompulsory retirement was set aside by the High Court of\n\nPunjab and Haryana in the writ petition filed by the\n\nrespondent. This Court, while allowing the appeal filed by the\n\nHaryana State Electricity Board, observed that though the\n\nappellant could have taken the action of compulsorily retiring\n\nthe respondent from service earlier, it acted very fairly and\n\nallowed him to remain in service till his representation against\n\nthe adverse remarks was considered on the first occasion and\n\nsubsequently, till the departmental enquiry was completed.\n\nThe clear meaning of the above-mentioned observation is that\n\neven during the pendency of his representation against\n\nadverse remarks and during the pendency of departmental\n\nenquiry, Haryana State Electricity Board could have taken\n\naction of compulsorily retiring the respondent from service\n\nearlier. Thus on the basis of service record, the three Judicial\n\nOfficers could have been retired compulsorily from service but\n\na tentative decision was taken not to retire them from service\n\nat that point of time. But this tentative decision would not\n\npreclude the authority concerned from passing orders of\ncompulsory retirement later on.\n\n41.\nIn\nGovernment of T.N. vs. P.A. Manickam\nAIR\n\n1996 SC 2250, what is ruled by this Court is that\n\nthe rule permits the appropriate authority to retire\n\nany Government servant after he has attained the\n\nage of 50 years or after he has completed 25 years\n\nof qualifying service and the rule prescribes a\n\nstarting point, which is the attaining of the age of\n\n50 years or the completion of 25 years of service,\n\nbut it does not prescribe a terminus ad quam and it\n\nis, therefore, open to the appropriate authority\n\nunder the rule to consider the case of a Government\n\nservant for premature retirement at any time after\n\nthe aforementioned starting points. Thus, after the\n\nso-called review of the cases of the two appellants\n\nand the deceased officer in July, 2000, their cases\n\nwere rightly reviewed again and orders retiring them\n\ncompulsorily from service were rightly passed\n\nagainst them.\n42.\nIn\nUnion of India Vs. M.E. Reddy\n(1980) 2 SCC\n\n15, the respondent Mr. Reddy started his career in\n\nthe Police Service as Deputy Superintendent of\n\nPolice in the year 1948. In the year 1958 he was\n\nappointed to the Indian Police Service. On July 31,\n\n1958, he was promoted as Superintendent of Police\n\nin State of Andhra Pradesh and held charge of a\n\nnumber of Districts from time to time. He was\n\nawarded the President Police Medal on August 14,\n\n1967 but the award of the said medal was withheld\n\nas he was placed under suspension by the\n\nGovernment on August 11, 1967 pending\n\ndepartmental enquiry into a number of allegations\n\nmade against him.\n\nIn 1969, he filed a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh\n\nHigh Court praying that the order of suspension passed\n\nagainst him be quashed as it was passed on false allegations\n\nand at the instance of Mr. K. Brahmanand Reddy who was\n\nthen Chief Minister of the State. The writ petition was\nadmitted by the High Court and an interim order staying all\n\nfurther proceedings in departmental enquiry was passed.\n\nWhen the writ came up for hearing, the State Government\n\nrepresented to the High Court that, it had decided to withdraw\n\norder of suspension and reinstate Mr. Reddy. The State\n\nGovernment withdrew the order of suspension and directed\n\nthat the period of suspension be treated as on duty.\n\nThereafter, on application being filed by Mr. Reddy, the writ\n\npetition was dismissed as withdrawn. Because of these\n\ndevelopments the departmental proceedings against him were\n\ndropped and he was given Selection Grade, which was\n\nwithheld because of the suspension order. By an order dated\n\nApril 28, 1971, he was promoted to the rank of Deputy\n\nInspector General of Police. During the course of the\n\ndepartmental enquiry an entry to the effect that \"he had\n\nconcocted a case of attempt to rape against one Mr. Venugopal\n\nReddy to please the then Inspector General of Police Mr.\n\nNambiar and there was a strong suspicion about his integrity\"\n\nwas made in his A.C.R. He made a representation to expunge\n\nthe entry. The Government decided that as statements were\nfactual, it would be sufficient if entry was made to the effect\n\nthat the suspension was subsequently lifted and the period\n\nwas treated as on duty and that further action was not\n\nnecessary as there were no good grounds to hold him guity of\n\nany of the charges leveled against him.\n\nHowever, on August 7, 1975, a Review Committee\n\nconsisting of the Chief Secretary, Home Secretary and\n\nInspector General of Police considered various cases of police\n\nofficers including that of Mr. Reddy and made\n\nrecommendations. On September 11, 1975, the Government\n\nof India, after considering report of the Review Committee,\n\nordered compulsory retirement of Mr. Reddy in public interest.\n\nThereupon Mr. Reddy filed writ petition in the Andhra\n\nPradesh High Court. The Single Judge allowed the petition\n\nand quashed order of compulsory retirement. That decision\n\nwas upheld by the Division Bench of the High Court, in appeal\n\nfiled by State of Andhra Pradesh and Union of India.\n\nTherefore, the two appeals by certificate were filed before this\n\nCourt.\nIt was argued before this Court on behalf of Mr. Reddy\n\nthat the order impugned was passed on materials which were\n\nnot existent inasmuch as there were no adverse remarks\n\nagainst Mr. Reddy who had a spotless career throughout and\n\nif such remarks had been made in his confidential reports,\n\nthey would have been communicated to him under the rules.\n\nThis contention was negatived in following terms: -\n\n\"Here we might mention that the appellants were\n\nfair and candid enough to place the entire\n\nconfidential personal file of Reddy before us starting\n\nfrom the date he joined the Police Service and after\n\nperusing the same we are unable to agree with Mr.\n\nKrishnamurty Iyer that the officer had a spotless\n\ncareer. The assessment made by his superior\n\nofficers from the very beginning of his service until\n\nthe impugned order was passed show that at the\n\nbest Reddy was merely an average officer and that\n\nthe reports show that he was found to be sometimes\n\ntactless, impolite, impersonated, suffered from other\n\ninfirmities, though not all of them were of a very\n\nserious nature so as to amount to an adverse entry\n\nwhich may be communicated to him. We might also\n\nmention that before passing an order under Rule\n\n16(3) it is not an entry here or an entry there which\n\nhas to be taken into consideration by the\n\nGovernment but the overall picture of the officer\n\nduring the long years of his service that he puts in\n\nhas to be considered from the point of view of\n\nachieving higher standard of efficiency and\n\ndedication so as to be retained even after the officer\n\nhas put in the requisite number of years of service.\nEven in the last entry which was sought to be\n\nexpunged through a representation made by Reddy\n\nand other entries made before that it appears that\n\nthe integrity of Reddy was not above board.\"\n\nWhile allowing the appeals of the Union of India and State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh, this Court has emphasized the importance of\n\nadverse entry. After referring to observations made by this\n\nCourt in para 27 of the decision in the case of\nSate of U.P. vs.\n\nChandra Mohan Nigam\n(1977) 4 SCC 345, wherein the Court\n\nhad hastened to add that when integrity of an officer is in\n\nquestion that will be an exceptional circumstance for which\n\norder may be passed in respect of such a person under Rule\n\n16(3) at any time, if other conditions of the rule are fulfilled,\n\napart from the choice of disciplinary action which will also be\n\nopen to Government, this Court\nM.E. Reddy\n's case, has held\n\nas under: -\n\n\"Thus, even according to the decision rendered by\n\nthis Court in the aforesaid case the fact that an\n\nofficer is of doubtful integrity stands on a separate\n\nfooting and if he is compulsorily retired that neither\n\ninvolves any stigma nor any error in the order.\"\nFurther, in the process of interpreting the decision in\nChandra\n\nMohan Nigam\n's case, this Court in para 25 of the reported\n\ndecision inter-alia observed that \"we have already indicated\n\nabove that this Court made it absolutely clear that when a\n\nperson was retired under Rule 16(3) on the ground that his\n\nintegrity was in question, the observations made by this Court\n\nwould have no application.\"\n\n43. Apart from the poor judicial performance, the\n\nappellants were also retired compulsorily from\n\nservice, on the ground that their integrity was\n\ndoubtful.\n\n44. The mandate of\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution is\n\nthat the High Court has to maintain constant vigil\n\non its subordinate judiciary as\nlaid down by\nthis\n\nCourt in High Court of Judicature at Bombay\n\nthrough its\nRegistrars Vs. Shirishkumar Rangrao\n\nPatil and Another\n(1997) 6 SCC 339. In the said\n\ncase, this Court has explained that the lymph nodes\n\n(cancerous cells) of corruption constantly keep\ncreeping into the vital veins of the judiciary and\n\nneed to stem it out by judicial surgery lies on the\n\njudiciary itself by its self- imposed or corrective\n\nmeasures or disciplinary action under the doctrine\n\nof control enshrined in\nArticles 235\n, 124(6)\nof the\n\nConstitution, and therefore, it would be necessary\n\nthat there should be constant vigil by the High\n\nCourt concerned on its subordinate judiciary and\n\nself introspection.\n\n45. Judicial service is not a service in the sense of an\n\nemployment as is commonly understood. Judges\n\nare discharging their functions while exercising the\n\nsovereign judicial power of the State. Their honesty\n\nand integrity is expected to be beyond doubt. It\n\nshould be reflected in their overall reputation.\n\nThere is no manner of doubt that the nature of\n\njudicial service is such that it cannot afford to suffer\n\ncontinuance in service of persons of doubtful\n\nintegrity or who have lost their utility. As explained\nby this Court in Chandra Singh and others Vs.\n\nState of Rajasthan & another (2003) 6 SCC 545,\n\nthe power of compulsory retirement can be\n\nexercised at any time and that the power under\n\nArticle 235\nin this regard is not in any manner\n\ncircumscribed by any rule or order. What is\n\nexplained in the said decision by this Court is that\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution of India enables the\n\nHigh Court to assess the performance of any\n\njudicial officer at any time with a view to discipline\n\nthe black sheep or weed out the deadwood, and this\n\nconstitutional power of the High Court cannot be\n\ncircumscribed by any rule or order.\nMoreover while\n\nupholding the orders of compulsory retirement of\n\njudicial officers who were working in the State of\n\nU.P., following weighty observations have been\n\nmade by this Court in para 13 of decision in case of\n\nNawal Singh vs. State of U.P. and another\n(2003)\n\n8 SCC 117: -\n\"13. It is to be reiterated that for keeping the\n\nstream of justice unpolluted, repeated scrutiny of\n\nservice records of judicial officers after a specified\n\nage/completion of specified years of service provided\n\nunder the Rules is a must by each and every High\n\nCourt as the lower judiciary is the foundation of the\n\njudicial system. We hope that the High Courts\n\nwould take appropriate steps regularly for weeding\n\nout the dead wood or the persons polluting the\n\njustice delivery system.\"\n\n46. Under the circumstances this Court is of the firm\n\nopinion that the principle\nlaid down in\n\nChandra\n\nMohan Nigam\n's case will not be applicable to the\n\nfacts of the appellants who were Members of the\n\nDelhi Higher Judicial Service.\n\n47. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that\n\nthe principle\nlaid down in\n\nChandra Mohan Nigam\n's\n\ncase would apply with all the vigour to the facts of\n\nthe appellants also, this Court finds that in respect\n\nof all the three officers, after the previous\n\nconsideration in July, 2000, new material in the\n\nform of ACR for the year 2000 \"`C' integrity\n\ndoubtful\" had come into existence and had become\na part of their respective service records when the\n\nFull Court in its meeting held on 13.9.2001\n\nrecorded their ACRs for the year 2000.\n\nThus the\n\nconsideration by the Committee constituted for the\n\npurpose of evaluating the cases of the officers to\n\nascertain whether they should be compulsorily\n\nretired, was subsequent in point of time, namely, on\n\n21.09.2001 and as such it will be fully covered by\n\nthe exception spelt out in\nChandra Mohan Nigam\n's\n\nCase itself in regard to consideration of cases again\n\nbefore the age of 55 years. The consideration of the\n\ncases of the three judicial officers on the basis of\n\nACRs dated September 13, 2001 recorded by the\n\nFull Court of the Delhi High Court is not a review of\n\nthe earlier decision of July, 2000. It is a fresh\n\nconsideration. It is review of the record of service of\n\nthe officers and not review of the earlier decision\n\nand such review is not only permissible but is\n\nperfectly legal and valid.\n48. The net result of the above discussion is that this\n\nCourt does not find any substance in the first\n\ncontention raised on behalf of the appellants and\n\nthe same is hereby rejected.\n\n49. The next contention which was raised by the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants was that the\n\norder passed by the Lt. Governor compulsorily\n\nretiring the appellants from service, without seeking\n\naid and advice of his Council of Ministers, as\n\nrequired by\nArticle 239(AA)(4)\nof the Constitution is\n\nultra vires as well as illegal and therefore, the same\n\nshould not be sustained. Elaborating the said\n\npoint, it was argued that the order retiring the\n\nappellants compulsorily from service was passed by\n\nthe Lt. Governor on receiving the recommendation\n\nof the High Court of Delhi, pursuant to the\n\nresolution of the Full Court passed on September\n\n22, 2001 acting under and in exercise of control\n\nover subordinate judiciary under\nArticle 235\nof the\nConstitution, but the powers of the Lt. Governor of\n\nN.C.T. of Delhi under\nArticle 239(AA)(4)\nwhich are\n\nanalogous to powers of a Governor under\nArticle\n\n163(1)\nof the Constitution can be exercised only on\n\naid and advice of his Council of Ministers, and\n\ntherefore, the order passed by the Lt. Governor\n\nretiring the appellants compulsorily from service are\n\nbad in law. In support of these submissions the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants placed reliance\n\non: (a) Samsher Singh Vs. State of Punjab and\n\nAnother, (1974) 2 SCC 831 = AIR 1974 SC 2192\n\nand (b) M.M.Gupta and Others Vs. State of\n\nJammu & Kashmir and Others, (1982) 3 SCC\n\n412.\n\n50. The learned counsel for the respondent High Court\n\npleaded that the contention that Lt. Governor while passing\n\nthe Order of compulsory retirement ought to have been\n\nadvised by his Council of Ministers was not advanced before\n\nthe High Court and therefore was not considered by the High\nCourt and this plea should not be permitted to be raised for\n\nthe first time in the appeals arising by grant of special leave.\n\nIt was pointed out that in the appeal arising out of SLP No.\n\n314 of 2009 in the list of dates filed by Mr. P.D. Gupta it was\n\npleaded that this plea was urged before the High Court but the\n\nsame was not considered before the High Court and if that be\n\nso the remedy of the appellant is to go back to the High Court\n\nand file the review petition. What was emphasized was that\n\nMr. Gupta had in fact filed a review petition but later on\n\nwithdrawn the same without seeking any liberty to agitate this\n\npoint in the Special Leave Petition or in any other proceedings\n\nand therefore, he is not entitled to urge this plea. It was\n\nemphatically pointed out by the learned counsel for the High\n\nCourt that in other appeals, it is not stated by the appellants\n\nthat such a plea was urged before the High Court and they\n\nhaving not urged such a plea in the memorandum of Special\n\nLeave Petitions, the plea raised at the delayed and belated\n\nstage should not be considered by this Court.\nIn support of\n\nthis argument, the learned counsel for the respondent relied\n\nupon decisions in (\na) Daman Singh and Others Vs. State\nof Punjab and Others\n, (\n1985) 2 SCC 670, (b) State of Punjab\n\nand Another Vs. H.B. Malhotra\n, (\n2006) 11 SCC 169, (c)\n\nMohd. Akram Ansari Vs. Chief Election Officer and Others\n,\n\n(\n2008) 2 SCC 95 and (d) Ex-Constable Ramvir Singh Vs.\n\nUnion of India and Others\n, (2009) 3 SCC 97.\n\n51. Without prejudice to the above stated contention, it was\n\nargued by the learned counsel for the respondent that under\n\nArticle 235\n, it is High Court which has to exercise supervision\n\nand control over the subordinate judiciary and not the State\n\nGovernment and therefore, recommendations of the High\n\nCourt in regard to compulsory retirement were/are binding on\n\nthe State Government/the Governor. The learned counsel\n\npleaded that the Lt. Governor has to act on the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court and there is no illegality, if\n\nthe Governor on the recommendations of the High Court had\n\npassed order retiring the appellants compulsorily from service.\n\nTo buttress this submission, the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent placed reliance on (a) Samsher Singh Vs. State of\n\nPunjab and Another, (1974) 2 SCC 831 = AIR 1974 SC\n2192, (b) State of Haryana Vs. Inder Prakash Anand H.C.S.\n\n& Others, (\n1976) 2 SCC 977, (c) Baldev Raj Guliani Vs. The\n\nPunjab and Haryana High\nCourt & Others, (1976) 4 SCC\n\n201, (d) Registrar, High Court of\nMadras Vs. R. Rajaiah\n,\n\n(1988) 3 SCC 211, (e) Registrar (Admn.\n), High Court of\n\nOrissa, Cuttack Vs. Sisir Kanta Satapathy (Dead) by LRs\n.\n\n&\n\nAnother, (1999) 7 SCC 725, (f) Tej Pal Singh Vs. State of\n\nU.P. & Another, (\n1986) 3 SCC 604 and (g) T. Lakshmi\n\nNarasimha Chari Vs. High\nCourt of A.P. and Another,\n\n(1996) 5 SCC 90.\n\nThis Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nat great length on the question whether the order passed by\n\nthe Lt. Governor compulsorily retiring the appellants from\n\nservice without seeking aid and advice of his Council of\n\nMinisters as required under\nArticle 239 (AA)(4)\nof the\n\nConstitution is ultravires and illegal.\n\n52.It is true that the appellant Mr. Gupta has stated in the\n\nMemorandum of Special Leave Petition that the point that\n\nLt. Governor could not have passed order retiring him\ncompulsorily from service on the recommendation of the\n\nHigh Court and without seeking aid and advice of his\n\nCouncil of Ministers, was urged before the High Court, but\n\nthe said point was not considered by the High Court. It is\n\nrightly argued by the learned counsel for the respondent\n\nthat even in such an eventuality, the only course/remedy\n\navailable to the said appellant was to approach the High\n\nCourt seeking review of the Judgment. The record shows\n\nthat the appellant Mr. Gupta had filed review application\n\nbefore the High Court, but the same was unconditionally\n\nwithdrawn. At the time of withdrawal of review application,\n\nthe appellant had not sought any liberty to agitate this\n\npoint in Special Leave Petition before this Court. So far as\n\ntwo other appellants are concerned they have not stated\n\nthat such a point was argued on their behalf before the\n\nHigh Court and was not dealt with by the High Court.\n\nUnder the circumstances a question arises whether the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants should be permitted to\n\nraise such a plea before this Court at the stage of final\n\ndisposal of the matters.\n53.Ordinarily the Supreme Court would not entertain a new\n\nprayer at the hearing of the appeal under\nArticle 136\nwhen\n\nit is not raised in the High Court or in the petition seeking\n\nleave to appeal. Point not raised before the High Court but\n\ntaken in Special Leave Petition will not ordinarily be\n\nallowed to be agitated before this Court. The consistent\n\npractice of this Court is that the Court does not permit a\n\nparty to raise a new point which has not been argued\n\nbefore the High Court. However, there are exceptional\n\ncases in which this Court may permit a party to raise a new\n\nplea before this Court for the first time, for example, where\n\nthe plea raised does not require investigation of new facts\n\nor where the question raised is a pure question of law or\n\nwhere the point is likely to be raised in future affecting\n\nsuch cases or where the respondent has dealt with the\n\npoint raised for the first time, in the reply filed before this\n\nCourt and the learned counsel for the parties are heard at\n\nlength and in great detail. This Court having gone through\n\nthe decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent, finds that no absolute proposition of law is\nlaid\ndown in\nany of the decisions that in no circumstances a\n\nnew plea can ever be permitted to be raised before this\n\nCourt if the same was not raised before the High Court.\n\nThe question sought to be raised is a pure question of law\n\nfor which factual foundation is already laid. The learned\n\ncounsel for the parties have been heard at great length on\n\nthe new point sought to be raised first time before this\n\nCourt. The authorities cited at the Bar have been read and\n\nre-read to emphasize respective view points. Therefore,\n\nhaving regard to the facts of the case, this Court has\n\npermitted the learned counsel for the appellants to raise\n\nthe point and heard the learned counsel for the parties in\n\ndetail.\n\n54.In order to answer the question posed for the consideration\n\nof the Court, it will be useful to notice the contents of\n\nArticles 163(1)\nand\n239(AA) (4)\nof the Constitution.\n\n55.Article 163 makes provision that Council of Ministers has\n\nto aid and advice Governor. It inter alia provides that there\n\nshall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as\nthe head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of\n\nhis functions, except in so far as he is by or under the\n\nConstitution required to exercise his functions or any of\n\nthem in his discretion. The said Article further provides\n\nthat if any question arises whether any matter is or is not a\n\nmatter in respect of which the Governor is by or under this\n\nConstitution required to act in his discretion, the decision\n\nof the Governor in his discretion shall be final, and the\n\nvalidity of anything done by the Governor shall not be\n\ncalled in question on the ground that he ought or ought not\n\nto have acted in his discretion. Sub\nArticle (3)\nof\nArticle\nstipulates that the question whether any, and if so\n\nwhat, advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor\n\nshall not be inquired into in any Court.\n\n56.Article 239AA inserted by the\nConstitution (Sixty-ninth\n\nAmendment) Act, 1991\nenacts special provisions with\n\nrespect to Delhi. Clause (1) of said Article states that as\n\nfrom the date of commencement of the Constitution (Sixty-\n\nninth\nAmendment) Act, 1991\nwhich is February 1, 1992\nthe Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National\n\nCapital Territory of the Delhi and the administrator thereof\n\nappointed under\nArticle 239\nshall be designated as the\n\nLieutenant Governor. Sub-clause (2) deals with the\n\nconstitution of Legislative Assembly for the National Capital\n\nTerritory and total number of seats of the assembly etc.\n\nSub-clause (3) of the Article confers power on the\n\nLegislative Assembly to make laws for the whole or any part\n\nof the National Capital Territory. Sub-clause (4) with which\n\nthe court is concerned, inter alia provides that there shall\n\nbe a Council of Ministers consisting of not more than ten\n\nper cent of the total number of members in the Legislative\n\nAssembly, with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and\n\nadvise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his\n\nfunctions in relation to matters with respect to which the\n\nLegislative Assembly has power to make laws, except in so\n\nfar as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his\n\ndiscretion.\n57. A meaningful and conjoint reading of\nArticle 163\nof the\n\nConstitution makes it clear that the Governor has to act on\n\naid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Chief\n\nMinisters as the head except in so far as he is by or under\n\nthis Constitution required to exercise his functions or any\n\nof them in his discretion. In view of the provisions of sub\n\nArticle (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution, the Lt.\n\nGovernor has to take aid and advice of the Council of\n\nMinisters in the exercise of his functions in relation to\n\nmatters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly has\n\npower to make laws.\nArticle 235\nprovides that the control\n\nover the subordinate courts is vested in High Court of a\n\nState. The expression \"control\" has been elucidated in\n\nseveral reported decisions of this Court, the leading case\n\nbeing\nShamsher vs. State of Punjab\n(1974) 2 SCC 831.\n\nThe \"control\" vested in the High Court is a mechanism to\n\nensure independence of the subordinate judiciary. Under\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution, the control over the\n\nsubordinate judiciary, vested in the High Court, is\n\nexclusive in nature, comprehensive in extent and effective\nin operation and it is to subserve a basic feature of the\n\nConstitution, i.e., independence of judiciary. Among others\n\nthings, it includes - (a) (i) disciplinary jurisdiction and a\n\ncomplete control subject only to the power of Governor in\n\nthe matter of appointment, dismissal, removal and\n\nreduction in rank of District Judges and initial posting and\n\npromotion to the cadre of District Judges, (ii) in\nArticle 235\n\nthe word `Control' is accompanied by the word `vest' which\n\nshows that the High Court alone is made the sole custodian\n\nof the control over the judiciary, and (iii) Suspension from\n\nservice of a member of judiciary with a view to hold\n\ndisciplinary enquiry; (b) transfers, promotion and\n\nconfirmation of such promotions, of persons holding posts\n\nin judicial service, inferior to that of District Judge; (c)\n\ntransfer of District Judges; (d) recall of District Judges\n\nposted on ex-cadre posts or on deputation on\n\nadministrative posts; (e) award of selection grade to the\n\nmembers of the judicial service, including District Judges\n\nand grant of further promotion after their initial\n\nappointment to the cadre; (f) confirmation of the District\nJudges who have been on probation or are officiating after\n\ntheir initial appointment or promotion by the Governor to\n\nthe cadre of District Judges under\nArticle 233;\nand (g)\n\npremature or compulsory retirement of Judges of the\n\nDistrict Courts and of Subordinate Courts.\n\n58.The scheme envisaged by the Constitution does not permit\n\nthe State to encroach upon the area reserved by\nArticles\n, 234\nand first part of\nArticle 235\neither by legislation or\n\nrules or executive instructions.\n\n59.Article 235 has no concern with the conferring of\n\njurisdiction and powers on the Court but it only relates to\n\nadministrative and disciplinary jurisdiction over the\n\nsubordinate Courts. Therefore, the conferment of power of\n\nthe prescribed authority by the State Legislature on the\n\nJudicial Officers cannot be construed to mean that the\n\npower of the High Court under\nArticle 235\nis inoperative or\n\ninchoate as High Court alone is the sole authority\n\ncompetent to initiate disciplinary proceedings against\n\nSubordinate Judicial Officers or to impose various\npunishments including passing of order of compulsory\n\nretirement on verification of the service record. The State\n\nis least competent to aid and advise Governor on such\n\nsubjects. While the High Court retains the power of\n\ndisciplinary control over the subordinate judiciary\n\nincluding power to initiate disciplinary proceedings,\n\nsuspend them during enquiries and impose punishment on\n\nthem, but when it comes to the question of dismissal,\n\nremoval or reduction in rank or termination of services of\n\njudicial officers on any count whatsoever, the High Court\n\nbecomes the recommending authority and cannot itself\n\npass the orders. The formal order to give effect to such a\n\ndecision has to be passed by the State Governor on the\n\nrecommendations of the High Court. In disciplinary\n\nproceedings if an action is taken by the High Court against\n\nthe judicial officer the recommendations made by the High\n\nCourt bind the Governor and he is left with no discretion\n\nexcept to act according to the recommendations. The\n\nGovernor, under the scheme of\nArticles 233\n, 234\nand\nof the Constitution cannot refuse to act in terms of the\nrecommendations made by the High Court on the ground\n\nthat he is not aided and advised by the Council of Ministers\n\nand this is the true import of total control of the High Court\n\nover the Subordinate Judiciary.\n\n60.In the light of the above mentioned principles the decisions\n\nsited at the bar will have to be considered.\n\n61.\nIn\nShamsher Singh\n(Supra), there were two appellants,\n\nnamely, Shamsher Singh and Ishwar Chand Agarwal. The\n\ntwo appellants were members of the Punjab Civil Services\n\n(Judicial Branch) and were appointed on probation. The\n\nservices of appellant Shamsher Singh were terminated by\n\nan order dated April 27, 1967, by the Governor of Punjab\n\nunder Rule 9 of the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and\n\nAppeal) Rules, 1952, with immediate effect. By an order\n\ndated December 15, 1969, the services of the appellant\n\nIshwar Chand Agarwal were terminated under Rule 7(3) in\n\nPart `D' of the Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch)\n\nRules, 1951, by the Governor of Punjab, on the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.\nBoth of them had filed writ petitions in the Punjab and\n\nHaryana High Court against the termination of their\n\nservices. The writ petitions were dismissed and, thereafter,\n\nthey had filed appeals to the Supreme Court.\n\n62.The first contention raised by appellant Ishwar Chand\n\nAgarwal that he completed his initial period of probation of\n\ntwo years on November 11, 1968 and by reason of the fact\n\nthat he continued in service after the maximum period of\n\nprobation, he became confirmed by necessary implication,\n\nwas negatived by this Court on the ground that notice\n\ndated October 4, 1968 was given at the end of the\n\nprobation and the period of probation got extended till the\n\ninquiry proceedings commenced by the notice under Rule 9\n\ncame to an end.\n\n63.The second contention on behalf of Ishwar Chand Agarwal\n\nthat termination of his service was by way of punishment\n\non the basis of charges of gross misconduct by ex-parte\n\nenquiry conducted by the Vigilance Department found\n\nfavour with this Court.\n64.This Court accepted the plea that the termination of his\n\nservices was based on the findings of misconduct contained\n\nin about eight complaints, which were never communicated\n\nto him and High Court had abdicated the control vested in\n\nit under\nArticle 235\nby not having an enquiry through\n\njudicial officers subordinate to the control of the High\n\nCourt, but asking the Government to enquire through the\n\nVigilance Department.\n\n65.The abdication of the control over the subordinate judiciary\n\nby the High Court under\nArticle 235\nin favour of the\n\nGovernment and the stand of the State that the High Court\n\nwanted the Government to be satisfied about the suitability\n\nof Mr. Agarwal was found to be something obnoxious and\n\nhad annoyed and shocked this Court. Therefore, this\n\nCourt, without mincing the words, authoritatively, clearly\n\nand for future guidance of one and all, expressed itself in\n\nthe following strong words in para 78 of the reported\n\ndecision.\n\"78. The High Court for reasons which are not\n\nstated requested the Government to depute the\n\nDirector of Vigilance to hold an enquiry. It is indeed\n\nstrange that the High Court which had control over\n\nthe subordinate judiciary asked the Government to\n\nhold an enquiry through the Vigilance Department.\n\nThe members of the subordinate judiciary are not\n\nonly under the control of the High Court but are\n\nalso under the care and custody of the High Court.\n\nThe High Court failed to discharge the duty of\n\npreserving its control. The request by the High\n\nCourt to have the enquiry through the Director of\n\nVigilance was an act of self abnegation. The\n\ncontention of the State that the High Court wanted\n\nthe Government to be satisfied makes matters\n\nworse. The Governor will act on the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court. That is the\n\nbroad basis of\nArticle 235.\nThe High Court should\n\nhave conducted the enquiry preferably through\n\nDistrict Judges. The members of the subordinate\n\njudiciary look up to the High Court not only for\n\ndiscipline but also for dignity. The High Court acted\n\nin total disregard of\nArticle 235\nby asking the\n\nGovernment to enquire through the Director of\n\nVigilance.\"\n\nHaving laid down, abovementioned proposition of law,\n\nthis Court deprecated the abdication of control by the High\n\nCourt by observing that the High Court denied itself the\n\ndignified control over the Subordinate Judiciary and after\n\nholding that the order of termination of the services of Ishwar\nChand Agarwal was clearly by way of punishment, set aside\n\nthe same.\n\n66.\nIn view of what is categorically, clearly and authoritatively\n\nheld in paragraph 78 of the reported decision there is no\n\nmanner of doubt that it is ruled by Seven Judge Bench of\n\nthis Court in case of\nShamsher Singh\n(supra), that the\n\nGovernor has to act on the recommendation of the High\n\nCourt and that is the broad basis of\nArticle 235.\n\nThe appellant Shamsher Singh was appointed on May 1,\n\n1964 as Subordinate Judge. He was on probation. On March\n\n22, 1967, the Chief Secretary issued a notice to him\n\nsubstantially repeating the same charges which had been\n\ncommunicated to him by the Registrar on December 15, 1966,\n\nand asked the appellant to show cause as to why his services\n\nshould not be terminated as he was found unsuitable for the\n\njob. The appellant gave an answer. On April 29, 1967, the\n\nservices of the appellant were terminated.\n\nShamsher Singh, in the context of the Rules of Business,\n\ncontended that the removal of a Subordinate Judge from\nservice was a personal power of the Governor and was\n\nincapable of being delegated or dealt with under the Rules of\n\nBusiness.\n\nThis Court held that the Governor can allocate the\n\nbusiness of the Government to the Ministers and such\n\nallocation is no delegation and it is an exercise of executive\n\npower by the Governor through the Council or officers under\n\nthe Rules of Business. Therefore, the contention of the\n\nappellant that the order was passed by the Chief Minister\n\nwithout the formal approval of the Governor was found to be\n\nuntenable and it was held that the order was of the Governor.\n\nThereafter, this Court noted the contents of the show-\n\ncause notice, reply given to the said notice by the appellant,\n\nprotection granted by Rule 9, etc. and held that it was clear\n\nthat the order of termination of services of Shamsher Singh\n\nwas one of punishment and set it aside.\n\nIn the light of the contention raised on behalf of\n\nShamsher Singh in the context of the Rules of Business, this\n\nCourt, in para 88 of\nthe said decision\n, held that the President\nand the Governor act on the aid and advice of Council of\n\nMinisters in executive action and the appointment as well as\n\nremoval of the members of the Subordinate Judicial Service is\n\nan executive action of the Governor to be exercised on the aid\n\nand advice of the Council of Ministers in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution.\n\n67. Thus what is observed by the Supreme Court, in para 88 of\n\nthe reported decision, will have to be read in the light of the\n\nsubmission made on behalf of the appellant Shamsher\n\nSingh and subject to clear, unambiguous and manifest\n\nproposition of law\nlaid down in\npara 78 of the reported\n\ndecision.\n\nTherefore, it is wrong to contend that in\n\nShamsher Singh\n's case (supra), it is ruled by this Court\n\nthat the Governor is bound to act as per the aid and advice\n\ntendered by the Council of Ministers and not on the\n\nrecommendations of the High Court in the matter of\n\ntermination of services of the judicial officers on any count\n\nwhatsoever.\n68.\nIn another decision relied upon by the learned counsel for\n\nthe appellants, i.e., in\nM.M. Gupta and Others\n(Supra),\n\nthis Court held that in the appointment of Judicial Officers\n\nor removal of Judicial Officer by the Government, there has\n\nto be effective consultation between the Government and\n\nthe High Court. This decision basically interprets Section\n\n109 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. In the\n\nState of Jammu and Kashmir certain vacancies for the post\n\nof District and Sessions Judge occurred for being filled up\n\nout of the eligible Judicial Officers. The High Court at a\n\nmeeting of all the Judges considered the merits and\n\nsuitability of all the eligible candidates and by a resolution\n\nrecommended to the Government the name of some officers\n\nin supersession of others. The Government then called for\n\na copy of the High Court's resolution and Annual\n\nConfidential Reports of the candidates. In response, the\n\nhigh Court sent its detailed comments justifying its\n\nrecommendation as also reasons for the supersession of\n\nseniors along with the resolution and confidential reports\n\nas desired by the Government. Thereafter, a Cabinet sub-\ncommittee considered the matter. But the government\n\nneither communicated the recommendation of the\n\nCommittee to the High Court, nor sought the High Court's\n\nviews thereon and thereafter without any further intimation\n\nor discussions made the appointments in accordance with\n\nseniority. Those officers whose names were recommended\n\nby the High Court filed a writ petition under\nArticle 226\n\nchallenging validity of the appointments. The Court\n\ngranted a stay of operation of the appointment order\n\npending disposal of the matter regarding admissibility of\n\nthe petition. But ultimately in view of the agreement\n\nbetween the parties, the High Court declined to hear the\n\npetition on the ground of judicial propriety and vacated the\n\norder of stay and granted a certificate of fitness to the\n\npetitioners to file an appeal in the Supreme Court, holding\n\nthat the point involved in the writ petition relating to the\n\ninterpretation of Section 109 of the Constitution of Jammu\n\nand Kashmir, raised a substantial question of law of\n\ngeneral public importance and the case was a fit one in\n\nwhich a certificate of fitness should be granted. Against\nthis order the State filed a special leave to appeal in this\n\nCourt. The petitioners also filed a writ petition under\n\nArticle 32\nsubstantially for the same reliefs claimed in their\n\nearlier writ petition under\nArticle 226.\nAllowing the\n\naggrieved officers appeal with costs against the State\n\nGovernment, this Court held that the power to make\n\nappointment of District Judges vested in the Governor is\n\nconditioned by the mandatory duty on the part of the\n\nGovernor to consult the High Court, and the High Court\n\nhas to decide whether a person is fit for promotion and\n\nmake recommendations accordingly. This\nCourt further\n\nheld\nthat the consultation has to be made with the High\n\nCourt alone and not with any other authority, because the\n\nHigh Court by virtue of its control over the officers must be\n\nconsidered to be the best judge of the ability and suitability\n\nof any officer as it has in its possession all the relevant\n\nmaterials regarding the performance of the officers.\n\nTherefore, this Court in the said case ruled that it should\n\ngenerally be left to the High Court to decide as to which of\n\nthe officers will best serve the requirements in furtherance\nof the cause of justice. In this decision in no uncertain\n\nterms this Court after considering previous judgments on\n\nthe point held that the High Court should judge the\n\nsuitability for promotion in a detached manner taking into\n\nconsideration all material facts and relevant factors and\n\nnormally, as a matter of rule, the recommendations made\n\nby the High Court should be accepted by the State\n\nGovernment and the Governor should act on the same. If\n\nthe decision is construed in a pragmatic manner there is no\n\nmanner of doubt that this decision also takes a view that\n\nGovernor has to act on the recommendations made by the\n\nHigh Court. Ultimately, this Court found that the\n\nappointments of respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 therein made by\n\nthe State Government were in violation of the\n\nConstitutional provisions and were therefore, set aside.\n\n69.\nIn\nState of Haryana Vs. Inder Prakash Anand H.C.S. and\n\nOthers\n(Supra), the respondent joined the Punjab Civil\n\nService, (Executive Branch) in November, 1954. He was\n\nselected for the Judicial Branch of the Punjab Civil Service\non May 1, 1965. On November 15, 1968 he was promoted\n\nas officiating Additional District and Sessions Judge. He\n\nwas due to attain the age of 55 years on February 24,\n\n1971. The State referred his case to the High Court for its\n\nrecommendation whether he should be retired at the age of\n\n55 years or he should be retained in service till the age of\n\n58 years, i.e., the age of superannuation. The High Court\n\nrecommended that the respondent should be reverted to\n\nhis substantive post of Senior Subordinate Judge/Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate and that he might be allowed to\n\ncontinue in service till the age of 58 years. The State again\n\nsought recommendation about his retirement. The High\n\nCourt recommended against compulsory retirement. The\n\nState Government did not agree and retired the respondent\n\ncompulsorily. The High Court in a Writ Petition filed by the\n\nrespondent quashed the order. In appeal this Court\n\nexamined the scope of\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution and\n\nheld that control which is vested in the High Court is\n\ncomplete control subject only to the power of the Governor\n\nin the matter of appointment including dismissal, removal,\nreduction in rank and the initial posting and of the initial\n\npromotion to District Judges. According to this Court\n\nwhen a case is not of removal or dismissal or reduction in\n\nrank, any order in respect of exercise of control over the\n\njudicial officers is by the High Court and cannot be by any\n\nother authority. What is explained by this Court is that\n\nthere cannot be dual control and if the State Government is\n\nto have the power of deciding whether a judicial officer\n\nshould be retained in service after attaining the age of 55\n\nyears up to the age of 58 years, that will seriously affect the\n\nindependence of the Judiciary and take away the control\n\nvested in the High Court. What is ruled by this Court in\n\nthe said decision\nis that it is unsound to contend that the\n\nGovernor and not the High Court has the power to retire a\n\njudicial officer compulsorily under\nSection 14\nof the Punjab\n\nGeneral Clauses Act.\n\n70.In paragraph 18 of the reported judgment this Court has\n\nheld that the control vested in the high Court is that if the\n\nHigh Court is of the opinion that a particular judicial officer\nis not fit to be retained in service, the High Court will\n\ncommunicate that to the Governor because the Governor is\n\nthe authority to dismiss, remove, reduce in rank or\n\nterminate the appointment, but in such cases it is the\n\ncontemplation in the Constitution that the Governor as the\n\nhead of the State will act in harmony with the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court. According to this\n\nCourt, if the recommendation of the High Court is not held\n\nto be binding on the State, the consequences will be\n\nunfortunate. What is highlighted by this Court in\nthe said\n\ndecision\nis that it is in public interest that the State will\n\naccept the recommendation of the High Court. As a\n\nprinciple, it is stated in\nthe said decision\nthat the vesting of\n\ncomplete control over the subordinate Judiciary in the High\n\nCourt leads to this that the decision of the High Court in\n\nmatters within its jurisdiction will bind the State.\n\n71. In Baldev Raj Guliani (1976) 4 SCC 201, this Court had\n\noccasion to consider and interpret the provisions of\nArticles\n, 311\nand\nread with\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution.\nIn the said case adverse reports having been received\n\nagainst the appellant while he was acting as Subordinate\n\nJudge, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him\n\nby the High Court. After preliminary enquiry, he was\n\nsuspended and on the findings of the departmental enquiry\n\nand on consideration of his explanation in reply to show-\n\ncause notice under\nArticle 311(2)\n, the High Court\n\nrecommended to the Government that the officer should be\n\nremoved from service. The State Government although on\n\nits own showing was inclined to agree with the views of the\n\nHigh Court and with the recommendations made by it,\n\nhowever referred the case to the Haryana Public Service\n\nCommission for advice purporting to act under\nArticle\n\n320(3)\nof the Constitution. The Commission advised that\n\nno case had been made out against the appellant and that\n\nhe should be exonerated. The Governor accepted the\n\nadvice of the Commission and passed the order for\n\nreinstatement. The High Court, however, did not issue any\n\nposting order as it regarded the order of reinstatement by\n\nthe Governor illegal. It even requested the Government to\nreview its order.\n\n72.Thereupon the appellant filed a writ petition praying for a\n\nwrit of mandamus directing the high Court to issue an\n\nappropriate order of posting and also for a mandamus\n\ndirecting the Government to disburse full salary to him and\n\nother consequential reliefs. While the writ petition was\n\npending the Governor compulsorily retired him.\n\nSubsequently a Full Bench of the High Court delivered its\n\njudgment holding the order of reinstatement violative of\n\nArticle 235\n, for the Governor was bound to accept the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court as regards the\n\nsubordinate judiciary. Therefore, the appellant preferred\n\nan appeal before this Court. Three questions were\n\nconsidered by this Court in the said case - (1) whether the\n\nGovernment is bound under the Constitution to accept the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court and to pass an order of\n\nremoval of the judicial officer, (2) whether consultation with\n\nthe Public Service Commission in the matter of a\n\ndisciplinary proceeding relating to the judicial officer under\nthe control of the High Court is unconstitutional. Was the\n\norder of reinstatement passed by the Government\n\nconstitutionally valid, and (3) if not what will be position of\n\nthe officer on the date of the officer's compulsory\n\nretirement? Was an order of removal possible after that\n\ndate?\n\n73.After considering the scheme envisaged by different\n\nprovisions of the Constitution this Court held that the\n\nappointing authority of a Subordinate Judge under\nArticle\nas well as under the Appointment Rules, is the\n\nGovernor because under\nArticle 235\nitself the Subordinate\n\nJudge will be governed by the Appointment Rules made\n\nunder\nArticle 234\nread with\nArticle 309.\nThis Court then\n\nconsidered the submission of the appellant that the\n\nGovernor being the appointing authority, both under\nArticle\nand the Appointment Rules read with the Punishment\n\nRules, is the final authority to pass the order of removal of\n\nthe officer and is not under any constitutional obligation to\n\nbe bound by the recommendation of the High Court and\nalso the assertion made on behalf of the High Court that\n\nArticle 235\nleaves no option to the Governor to refuse to\n\naccept its recommendation in a disciplinary matter in\n\nrespect of a judicial officer. This Court found that the High\n\nCourt in making its recommendation to the Governor for\n\npassing the order of removal, had rightly conceded the\n\nauthority of the Governor to pass the same. Thereafter the\n\nCourt considered the question : Is the recommendation of\n\nthe High Court binding on the Governor, and answered\n\nthat since the Governor is the ultimate authority to pass\n\nthe order for removal it will not be correct always to insist\n\nthat he has no authority even under certain extraordinary\n\ncircumstances to decline to accept, forthwith, the\n\nparticular recommendation, but ordinarily and as a matter\n\nof graceful routine, recommendations of the High Court are\n\nand should be always accepted by the Governor, because\n\nthat is ordinarily so and should be in practice the rule as a\n\nmatter of healthy convention.\n74.In paragraph 28, of the reported decision this Court has\n\nheld that the quality of exclusive control of the High Court\n\ndoes not appear to be whittled down by the constitutional\n\ndevice of all orders issued in the name of the Governor as\n\nthe head of the State administration and, therefore, when\n\nthe High Court exercising disciplinary control over the\n\nsubordinate judiciary finds, after a proper enquiry, that a\n\ncertain officer is guilty of gross misconduct and is\n\nunworthy to be retained in judicial service and, therefore,\n\nrecommends to the Governor his removal or dismissal, it is\n\ndifficult to conceive how and under what circumstances\n\nsuch a recommendation should be rejected by the Governor\n\nacting with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers\n\nor, as is usually the case, of one of the ministers. It is\n\nexplained by this Court in\nthe said decision\nthat in this\n\ncontext more than once the Supreme Court has observed\n\nthat the recommendation of the High Court in respect of\n\njudicial officers should always be accepted by the Governor,\n\nand this is the inner significance of the constitutional\n\nprovisions relating to the subordinate judiciary. This Court\nfurther noted that whenever in an extraordinary case, rare\n\nin itself, the Governor feels, for certain reasons that he is\n\nunable to accept the High Court's recommendations, these\n\nreasons will be communicated to the High Court to enable\n\nit to reconsider the matter, but it is, however, inconceivable\n\nthat without reference to the High Court, the Governor\n\nwould pass an order which had not been earlier\n\nrecommended by the High Court. This Court further\n\nexplained that such a course will be contrary to the\n\ncontemplation in the Constitution and should not take\n\nplace. In para 36 of the reported decision , this Court has\n\nexplained the power and/or role of Governor in such\n\nmatters and laid down the law authoritatively as under : -\n\n\"36. The Governor could not have passed any order\n\non the advice of the Public Service Commission in\n\nthis case. The advice should be of no other\n\nauthority than the High Court in the matter of\n\njudicial officers. This is the plain implication of\n\nArticle 235.\n\nArticle 320(3)(c)\nis clearly out of place\n\nso far as the High Court is concerned dealing with\n\njudicial officers. To give any other interpretation to\n\narticle 320(3)(c)\nwill be to defeat the supreme object\n\nunderlying\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution specially\n\nintended for the protection of the judicial officers\n\nand necessarily the independence of the\nsubordinate judiciary. It is absolutely clear that the\n\nGovernor cannot consult the Public Service\n\nCommission in the case of judicial officers and\n\naccept its advice and act according to it. There is\n\nno room for any outside body between the Governor\n\nand the High Court.\"\n\nIt may be noted that in the case of\nBaldev Raj Guliani\n(supra),\n\nthis Court had considered the case of Shamsher Singh and\n\nthereafter has laid down above mentioned proposition of law.\n\nIn the decision delivered in case of Baldev Raj Guliani, this\n\nCourt has not ruled that the Governor has to act in aid and on\n\nadvice of the Council of Ministers. What is ruled is that the\n\nrecommendation made by the High Court is binding on the\n\nGovernor.\n\n75. Again in the case of Regist\nrar, High Court of\nMadras Vs.\n\nR. Rajaiah\n, (1988) 3 SCC 211, the High Court had decided\n\nto compulsorily retire the respondents but had not\n\ncommunicated the recommendations to the Governor for\n\npassing formal orders of compulsory retirement. Instead\n\nthe High Court had passed the orders of compulsory\n\nretirement under FR 56 (d). As there was no formal order\n\nby the Government under FR 56 (d), this Court held that\nthe impugned orders of the High Court were ineffective.\n\nUltimately, this Court did not interfere with the view\n\nexpressed by the Division Bench of the High Court on\n\nmerits of the matter and held that the High Court was\n\nperfectly justified in quashing orders of compulsory\n\nretirement. However, this Court considered the scope of\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution and held that the test of\n\ncontrol is not the passing of an order against a member of\n\nthe subordinate judicial service, but the power to take such\n\ndecision and action. The Court explained that so far as the\n\nmembers of the subordinate judicial service are concerned,\n\nit is the Governor, who being the appointing authority, has\n\nto pass an order of compulsory retirement or any order of\n\npunishment against such a member, but passing or signing\n\nof such orders by the Governor will not necessarily take\n\naway the control of the High Court vested in it under\nArticle\nof the Constitution. This Court further explained that\n\nan action against any Government servant consists of two\n\nparts. Under the first part, a decision will have to be made\n\nwhether an action will be taken against the Government\nservant and in the second part, the decision would be\n\ncarried out by a formal order. Having explained this, this\n\nCourt proceeded to hold that the power of control envisaged\n\nunder\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution relates to the power of\n\nmaking a decision by the High Court against a member of\n\nthe subordinate judicial service and such a decision is\n\narrived at by holding an enquiry by the High Court against\n\nthe member concerned, and after the High Court comes to\n\nthe conclusion that some action either in the nature of\n\ncompulsory retirement or by the imposition of a\n\npunishment, as the case may be, has to be taken against\n\nthe member concerned, the High Court will make a\n\nrecommendation in that regard to the Governor and the\n\nGovernor will act in accordance with such recommendation\n\nof the High Court by passing an order in accordance with\n\nthe decision of the High Court. What is ruled by this Court\n\nis that the Governor cannot take any action against any\n\nmember of a subordinate judicial service without and\n\ncontrary to the recommendation of the High Court. After\n\nreview of the law on the subject matter till then, this Court\nhas made following pertinent observations, in para 18 of\n\nthe reported decision: -\n\n\"18. The control of the High Court, as understood,\n\nwill also be applicable in the case of compulsory\n\nretirement in that the High Court will, upon an\n\nenquiry, come to a conclusion whether a member of\n\na subordinate judicial service should be retired\n\nprematurely or not. If the High Court comes to the\n\nconclusion that such a member should be\n\nprematurely retired, it will make a recommendation\n\nin that regard to the Governor inasmuch as the\n\nGovernor is the appointing authority. The Governor\n\nwill make formal order of compulsory retirement in\n\naccordance with the recommendation of the High\n\nCourt.\"\n\nAgain, in para 20 of the reported decision, this Court, while\n\nholding that so long as there is no formal order by the\n\nGovernor, the compulsory retirement, as directed by the High\n\nCourt would not take place, has, inter-alia observed that \"It\n\nmay be that the power of the Governor under Rule 56(d) of the\n\nFundamental Rules is very formal in nature, for the Governor\n\nmerely acts on the recommendation of the High Court by\n\nsigning an order in that regard\". The proposition of law\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthis case also supports the contention of the\n\nrespondents that in the matter of disciplinary action against a\nmember of the Subordinate Judicial Service, the Governor has\n\nno option, but to pass final order on the basis of the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court.\n\n76. It may be mentioned that in this case, i.e., Registrar, High\n\nCourt of\nMadras\n(supra), this Court has referred to the\n\ndecision of\nShamsher Singh\n(supra), and has thereafter\n\nruled that Governor has to act in accordance with the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court by passing an order in\n\naccordance with the decision of the High Court and the\n\nGovernor cannot take any action against any member of\n\nthe judicial service without and contrary to the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court.\n\n77. This Court further finds that in Registrar (Admn.) High\n\nCourt of\nOrissa, Cuttack\n(Supra), decision of Orissa High\n\nCourt on administrative side was required to be forwarded\n\nto the Governor for passing an order of the compulsory\n\nretirement but this was not done, and an order of\n\ncompulsory retirement was passed by the High Court itself.\n\nThis decision was challenged before the high Court on\njudicial side. The writ petition was decided in favour of\n\njudicial officers holding that the order dated February 5,\n\n1987 compulsorily retiring them was bad in law. In appeal,\n\nthis Court considered the scope of\nArticles 233\nto 235 of\n\nthe Constitution as well as\nArticles 55\nand\nin the light\n\nof basic feature of the Constitution namely independence of\n\nthe judiciary. After noticing several previous decisions on\n\nthe point, this Court considered the powers of the High\n\nCourt and held that the Governor is bound by the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court but the constitutional\n\npropriety requires that the recommendation would be sent\n\nby the High Court to the Governor and formal order would\n\nbe passed by the Governor. Explaining the scope of\n\nArticles 234\n, 235\nand\nof the Constitution, a five-Judge\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court has held that while the\n\nHigh Court retains the power of disciplinary control over\n\nthe subordinate judiciary, including the power to initiate\n\ndisciplinary proceedings, suspend them pending enquiries\n\nand impose punishment on them but when it comes to the\n\nquestion of dismissal, removal, reduction in rank or\ntermination of the services of the judicial officer, on any\n\ncount whatsoever, the High Court becomes only the\n\nrecommending authority and cannot itself pass such an\n\norder. What is ruled by the Constitution Bench is that the\n\nformal order to give effect to such a decision has to be\n\npassed only by the State Governor on the recommendation\n\nof the High Court.\n\n78.In the said case, this Court found that by not making an\n\norder of compulsory retirement on the recommendation of\n\nthe High Court, a peculiar situation was created in the\n\nsense that the judicial officers were neither in service nor\n\nwere they technically out of service nor had they performed\n\nany work and, therefore, in order to balance the equities\n\nbetween the parties and in order to give litigation a\n\nquietous, this Court had requested the Governor of the\n\nState to pass a formal order of compulsory retirement of\n\njudicial officers.\n\n79.On review of law, what is ruled by the Constitution Bench\n\nof this Court is that undoubtedly, the High Courts alone\nare entitled to initiate, to hold enquiry and to take a\n\ndecision in respect of dismissal, removal, reduction in rank\n\nor termination from service, but the formal order to give\n\neffect to such a decision has to be passed only by the State\n\nGovernor on the recommendation of the High Court, and it\n\nis well settled again by a catena of decisions of this Court\n\nthat the recommendation of the High Court is binding on\n\nthe State Government/Governor.\n\n80.\nIn\nTej Pal Singh Vs. State of U.P. and Another\n, (1986) 3\n\nSCC 604, the State Government moved the High Court in\n\nthe year 1967 with proposal of premature retirement of the\n\nappellant, an Additional District and Sessions Judge. On\n\nJuly 8, 1968 the Administrative Judge agreed with the\n\nproposal of premature retirement after giving three months'\n\nnotice. The Governor passed the order of retirement on\n\nAugust 24, 1968. Three days thereafter, on August 27,\n\n1968 the Administrative Committee of the High Court gave\n\nits approval to the recommendation of the Administrative\n\nJudge earlier communicated to the State Government.\nThereafter on August 30, 1968 the Additional Registrar\n\ntransmitted the order of retirement to the appellant. It was\n\nactually served on the appellant on September 3, 1968.\n\nThe question for consideration in this case before this\n\nCourt was whether the order of compulsory retirement\n\npassed against the appellant satisfied the requirements of\n\nthe Constitution. While allowing the appeal, this Court\n\nheld that the impugned order of premature retirement\n\npassed by the Governor without having before him the\n\nrecommendation of the Administrative Committee or of the\n\nFull Court was void and ineffective. What is ruled is that it\n\nis for the High Court, on the basis of assessment of\n\nperformance and all other aspects germane to the matter to\n\ncome to the conclusion whether any particular judicial\n\nofficer under its control is to be prematurely retired and\n\nonce the High Court comes to the conclusion that there\n\nshould be such retirement, the Court recommends to the\n\nGovernor to do so, and the conclusion is to be of the High\n\nCourt since the control vests therein. After noticing the\n\nRules obtaining in the Allahabad High Court, this Court\nheld that the Administrative Committee could act for and\n\non behalf of the Court but the Administrative Judge could\n\nnot have done so and therefore his agreeing with the\n\nGovernment proposal was of no consequence and did not\n\namount to the satisfaction of the requirement of Article\n\n235. After noting that it was only after the Governor\n\npassed the order on the basis of such recommendation,\n\nthat the matter was placed before the Administrative\n\nCommittee before the order of retirement was actually\n\nserved on the appellant, this Court held that the deviation\n\nwas not a mere irregularity which could be cured under\n\nRule 21 of the Rules of Court, 1952 by the ex post facto\n\napproval given by the Administrative Committee to the\n\naction of the Governor after the order of premature\n\nretirement had been passed and the error committed was\n\nan incurable defect amounting to an illegality. This Court\n\ntook notice of the decision of the Court in\nState of U.P. Vs.\n\nBatuk Deo Pati Tripathi\n, (1978) 2 SCC 102, and ruled\n\ntherein that the Governor can pass an order of compulsory\n\nretirement only on the recommendation made by the High\nCourt or the Administrative Committee. Further, in\n\nparagraph 18 of the reported decision, this Court observed\n\nthat in view of the control over the members of lower\n\njudiciary vested in the High Court by virtue of\nArticle 235\nof\n\nthe Constitution, the Governor is bound, in each case, to\n\nact in accordance with the recommendation of the High\n\nCourt. This decision also takes the firm view that the\n\nrecommendation made by the High Court is binding on the\n\nGovernor.\n\n81.Thus, it is fairly well settled by catena of decisions of this\n\nCourt that in the matter of compulsory retirement of a\n\nJudicial Officer the Governor cannot act on the aid and the\n\nadvice of Council of Ministers but has to act only on the\n\nrecommendation of the High Court. Though the Lt.\n\nGovernor is a party to these appeals, he has not raised any\n\nplea that the recommendation made by the Delhi High\n\nCourt was not binding on him and he could have acted in\n\nthe matter only on the aid and advice of his Council of\n\nMinisters. Thus the order of the Lt. Governor compulsorily\nretiring the appellants without seeking aid and advice of his\n\nCouncil of Ministers is neither ultra vires nor illegal and is\n\nrightly sustained by the High Court. The Governor could\n\nnot have passed any order on the aid and advice of Council\n\nof Ministers in this case. The advice should be of no other\n\nauthority except that of the High Court in the matter of\n\njudicial officers. This is the plain implication of\nArticle 235.\n\nReliance on\nArticle 239AA(4)\nis entirely out of place so far\n\nas the High Court is concerned, dealing with the judicial\n\nofficers. To give any other interpretation to\nArticle\n\n239AA(4)\nwill be to defeat the supreme object underlying\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution, specially intended for\n\nprotection of the judicial officers and necessarily\n\nindependence of the subordinate judiciary. It is absolutely\n\nclear that the Governor cannot take the aid and advice of\n\nhis Council of Ministers in the case of judicial officers and\n\naccept its advice and act according to it. There is no room\n\nfor any outside body between the Governor and the High\n\nCourt. Therefore, this Court does not find any substance\n\nin this contention also and the same is rejected.\n82.The next point which was argued on behalf of the\n\nappellants was that the appellants were made to retire\n\ncompulsorily from service without affording them an\n\nopportunity to make representation against the ACR of the\n\nyear 2000 wherein they were graded as \"`C' doubtful\n\nintegrity\", which was the basis for their compulsorily\n\nretirement, and, therefore, the orders retiring them\n\ncompulsorily from service are liable to the set aside. It was\n\nvehemently contended that in such circumstances when\n\nACR of 2000 wherein the appellants were graded as \"`C'\n\ndoubtful integrity\" which was the sole basis of passing the\n\norder of compulsory retirement, the respondents were\n\nunder legal obligation to look into the representation of the\n\nappellants against those adverse remarks but before the\n\nappellants could made the representation against the said\n\nACR, orders retiring them compulsorily from service were\n\npassed, and, therefore, the orders impugned should be\n\nregarded as arbitrary, unfair and unreasonable.\n83.In the appeal arising from SLP No. 27028 of 2008 deceased\n\nMr. R.S. Verma had stated that adverse remark for the year\n\n2000 was communicated to him vide letter dated\n\nSeptember 21, 2001 by the Registrar, Vigilance, Delhi High\n\nCourt which was received by him on September 25, 2001,\n\nwhereas on the same date i.e. on September 21, 2001 the\n\nScreening Committee had taken decision to retire him\n\nprematurely from service which was accepted by the Full\n\nCourt in its meeting held on September 22, 2001 and\n\nthough in the letter communicating ACR it was mentioned\n\nthat he was entitled to made representation within six\n\nweeks, the order of compulsory retirement against him was\n\npassed on September 27, 2001 which was communicated\n\nto him on September 28, 2001 and as he was deprived of\n\nmaking any representation against the ACR for the year\n\n2000, the order retiring him from service compulsorily was\n\nbad in law.\n\n84.In the Appeal arising from Special Leave Petition No.27200\n\nof 2008 it was contended by M.S. Rohilla that in the ACR\nfor the year 2000, recorded by the Full Court on May 24,\n\n2001, he was graded `C-Integrity doubtful' and he was\n\ncommunicated the said ACR and was asked to submit his\n\nrepresentation within six weeks, but within three days\n\nthereafter i.e. on September 27, 2001 decision was taken to\n\nretire him compulsorily from service and, therefore, the\n\norder retiring him compulsorily from service was illegal.\n\n85.In Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition No. 314 of\n\n2009 it was contended on behalf of P.D. Gupta that the\n\nFull Court had recorded remarks `C-Integrity Doubtful' for\n\nthe year 2000, in his case, which was communicated to\n\nhim vide letter dated September 22, 2001 and he was\n\nasked to file his representation against the remarks within\n\nsix weeks, but without waiting for the representation to be\n\nfiled by him, the High court upon the adverse remarks of\n\n2000 had recommended his premature retirement to the Lt.\n\nGovernor under F.R. 56(j) read with Rule 33 of the DJS\n\nRules, and therefore the order retiring him from service\n\nshould have been set aside by the High Court.\n86.As against this it was emphasized on behalf of the\n\nrespondents that this Court not only has taken the view\n\nthat a single adverse entry reflecting on the integrity of the\n\nofficer is sufficient because there has to be constant vigil by\n\nthe High Court over subordinate judiciary but this Court\n\nhas further taken the view that it is not necessary that\n\nsuch an entry should have been communicated or that the\n\nofficer concerned should have an opportunity to represent\n\nagainst the said adverse entry or that before it could be\n\ntaken into consideration and acted upon, the\n\nrepresentation should have been considered or rejected.\n\n87.The High Court in the impugned judgment, while\n\nconsidering this plea raised on behalf of the appellants, has\n\ninter alia held that action under FR 56(j) need not await the\n\nfinal disposal of such representation. It may be mentioned\n\nthat in support of their respective contentions, the learned\n\ncounsel have cited several decisions for the guidance of the\n\nCourt but this Court proposes to refer to only those\n\njudgments which are relevant for deciding the issue.\n88.Compulsory retirement from service is not considered to be\n\na punishment. Under the relevant rules, an order of\n\ndismissal is a punishment laid on a Government servant\n\nwhen it is found that he has been guilty of misconduct or\n\nthe like. It is penal in character because it involves loss of\n\npension which under the Rules have accrued in respect of\n\nthe service already put in. An order of removal also stands\n\non the same footing as an order of dismissal and involves\n\nthe same consequences, the only difference between them\n\nbeing that while a servant who is dismissed is not eligible\n\nfor re-appointment, one who is removed is. A compulsory\n\nretirement is neither dismissal nor removal and differs from\n\nboth of them, in that it is not a form of punishment\n\nprescribed by the rules and involves no penal\n\nconsequences, in as much as the person retired is entitled\n\nto pension and other retiral benefits, proportionate to the\n\nperiod of service standing to his credit.\n\n89. As explained by a Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of this\n\nCourt in\nState of U.P. vs. Shyam Lal Sharma\nAIR 1971\nSC 2151, in ascertaining, whether the order of compulsory\n\nretirement is one of punishment, it has to be ascertained,\n\nwhether in the order of compulsory retirement there was\n\nany element of charge or stigma or imputation or any\n\nimplication of misbehaviour or incapacity against the\n\nofficer concerned. Secondly, the order of compulsory\n\nretirement will be indicative of punishment or penalty if the\n\norder will involve loss of benefits already earned. Thirdly,\n\nas order of compulsory retirement on the completion of 25\n\nyears of service or an order of compulsory retirement made\n\nin the public interest to dispense with further service will\n\nnot amount to an order for dismissal or removal as there is\n\nno element of punishment. Fourthly, an order of\n\ncompulsory retirement will not be held to be an order in the\n\nnature of punishment or penalty on the ground that there\n\nis possibility of loss of future prospects, namely, that the\n\nofficer will not get his pay till he attains the age of\n\nsuperannuation, or will not get an enhanced pension for\n\nnot being allowed to remain a few years in service and\n\nbeing compulsorily retired. So far as the present cases are\nconcerned, this Court finds that there are no words in the\n\norders of compulsory retirement, which throw any stigma\n\nagainst the two appellants and the deceased officer.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessary for this Court to make inquiry\n\ninto the Government files to discover whether any remark\n\namounting to stigma could be found in the files. The\n\nreason is that it is the order of compulsory retirement,\n\nwhich alone is for examination. If the order itself does not\n\ncontain any imputation or charge against the two\n\nappellants and the deceased officer, the fact that\n\nconsiderations of misconduct or misbehaviour weighed\n\nwith the High Court in coming to its conclusion to retire\n\nthem compulsorily does not amount to any imputation or\n\ncharge against them. It is not established from the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement itself that the charge or imputation\n\nagainst the appellants was made a condition for exercise of\n\nthe power. Therefore, the orders of retirement cannot be\n\nconsidered to be one for dismissal or removal in the nature\n\nof penalty or punishment.\n90.Now, the policy underlying\nArticle 311(2)\nof the\n\nConstitution is that when it is proposed to take action\n\nagainst the servant by way of punishment and that will\n\nentail forfeiture of benefits already earned by him, he\n\nshould be heard and given an opportunity to show cause\n\nagainst the order. The confidential reports provide the\n\nbasic and vital inputs for assessing the performance of an\n\nofficer and his advancement in his career as also to serve\n\nthe data for judging his comparative merits when the\n\nquestions arise for his confirmation, promotion, grant of\n\nselection grade, crossing E.B., retention in service beyond\n\nthe age of 50 years etc. Maintenance of such records is\n\nordinarily regulated by administrative rules or instructions.\n\nWriting the confidential report is primarily and essentially\n\nan administrative function. Normally tribunals/Courts are\n\nloath to interfere in cases of complaints against adverse\n\nremarks and to substitute their own judgment for that of\n\nthe reporting or reviewing officers. It is because these\n\nofficers alone are best suited to judge the qualities of\n\nofficials working under them and about their competence in\nthe performance of official duties entrusted to them.\n\nDespite fear of abuse of power by prejudiced superior\n\nofficers in certain cases, the service record contained in the\n\nconfidential reports, by and large, reflects the real\n\npersonality of the officer. The object of writing confidential\n\nreports and making entries therein is to give an opportunity\n\nto the public servant to improve excellence.\nArticle 51\nA(j)\n\nof the Constitution enjoins upon every citizen the primary\n\nduty to constantly endeavour to prove excellence,\n\nindividually and collectively, as a member of the group.\n\nTherefore, the officer entrusted with the duty to write C.R.\n\nhas a public responsibility and trust to write the C.R.\n\nobjectively, fairly and dispassionately while giving, as\n\naccurately as possible the statement of facts on an overall\n\nassessment of performance of the subordinate officer.\n\nOpportunity of hearing is not necessary before adverse\n\nremarks because adverse remarks by themselves do not\n\nconstitute a penalty. However, when the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement is passed, the authority concerned\n\nhas to take into consideration the whole service record of\nthe officer concerned which would include non-\n\ncommunicated adverse remarks also. Thus it is settled by\n\nseveral reported decisions of this Court that un-\n\ncommunicated adverse remarks can be taken into\n\nconsideration while deciding the question whether an\n\nofficial should be made to retire compulsorily or not.\n\n91.\nIn\nState of U.P. and Another Vs. Bihari Lal\n(1994) Supp\n\n(3) SCC 593, this Court has taken the view that even an\n\nadverse entry which has been set aside in appeal on\n\ntechnical grounds could also be taken into consideration.\n\nThe plea that since the last entry, i.e., `C-Integrity Doubtful'\n\nfor the year 2000 was communicated almost around the\n\nsame time when the order of compulsory retirement was\n\ncommunicated and as the appellants had no opportunity to\n\nrepresent against the same, it ought not to have been taken\n\ninto consideration and that the consideration of the said\n\nlast adverse entry vitiates the order of compulsory\n\nretirement has no merits. This Court has consistently\n\ntaken the view that an order of compulsory retirement is\nnot a punishment and does not have adverse consequence\n\nand, therefore, the principles of natural justice are not\n\nattracted. What is relevant to notice is that this Court has\n\nheld that an un-communicated adverse A.C.R. on record\n\ncan be taken into consideration and an order of compulsory\n\nretirement cannot be set aside only for the reason that\n\nsuch un-communicated adverse entry was taken into\n\nconsideration. If that be so, the fact that the adverse\n\nA.C.R. was communicated but none of the appellants had\n\nan opportunity to represent against the same, before the\n\nsame was taken into consideration for passing order of\n\ncompulsory retirement, cannot at all vitiate the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement.\n\n92. In State of U.P. and another vs. Biharilal (supra), this\n\nCourt has ruled that before exercise of the power to retire\n\nan employee compulsorily from service, the authority has to\n\ntake into consideration the overall record, even including\n\nsome of the adverse remarks, though for technical reasons,\n\nmight have been expunged on appeal or revision. What is\nemphasised in the said decision is that in the absence of\n\nany mala fide exercise of power or arbitrary exercise of\n\npower, a possible different conclusion would not be a\n\nground for interference by the Court/Tribunal in exercise of\n\nits power of judicial review. According to this Court, what\n\nis needed to be looked into is whether a bona fide decision\n\nis taken in the public interest to augment efficiency in the\n\npublic service.\nAgain, a three Judge Bench of this Court in\n\nUnion of India vs. V.P. Seth and another\n1994 SCC\n\n(L&S) 1052, has held that uncommunicated adverse\n\nremarks can be taken into consideration while passing the\n\norder of compulsory retirement.\n\nThe bench in the said case\n\nmade reference to\nBaikuntha Nath Das vs. Chief District\n\nMedical Officer, Baripada\n(1992) 2 SCC 299, as well as\n\nPosts and Telegraphs Board vs. C.S.N. Murthy\n(1992) 2\n\nSCC 317, and after reiterating, with approval, the\n\nprinciples stated therein, has laid down firm proposition of\n\nlaw that an order of compulsory retirement is not liable to\n\nbe quashed by a Court merely on the showing that while\n\npassing it, uncommunicated adverse remarks were also\ntaken into consideration. Applying the\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nthe above-mentioned two cases to the facts of the present\n\ncases, this Court finds that the authorities concerned were\n\njustified in relying upon the adverse entry made against the\n\ntwo appellants and the deceased officer in the year 2000\n\nindicating that their integrity was doubtful alongwith other\n\nmaterials. Here in these cases, the ACRs for the year 2000\n\nwere communicated to the three officers but before they\n\ncould exercise the option given to them to make\n\nrepresentation against the same, the orders of compulsory\n\nretirement were passed. When an uncommunicated\n\nadverse entry can be taken into consideration, while\n\npassing order of compulsory retirement, there is no reason\n\nto hold that adverse entry communicated, against which\n\nopportunity of making representation is denied, cannot be\n\ntaken into consideration at the time of passing order of\n\ncompulsory retirement. Merely because the two appellants\n\nand the deceased officer had no opportunity to make\n\nrepresentation against the said entry or that the\n\nrepresentation made against the same was pending, would\nnot render consideration of the said entry illegal, in any\n\nmanner, whatsoever.\n\n93.\nIn\nBaidyanath Mahapatra Vs. State of Orissa and\n\nAnother\n(1989) 4 SCC 664, the Review Committee\n\nconstituted by the Government of Orissa in October 1983\n\nto determine the appellant's suitability for retention in\n\nservice after his completing the age of 50 years,\n\nrecommended the appellant to be compulsorily retired\n\nunder Rule 71(1)(a) of the Orissa Service Code. The\n\nCommittee took into account for formulating its opinion,\n\nthe entries awarded to him for the years 1981-82 and\n\n1982-83 which had been communicated to the appellant on\n\nJuly 5, 1983 and August 9, 1983 respectively. The\n\nappellant made representations against entries on\n\nNovember 1, 1983 but without disposing them of, the\n\nGovernment made an order on November 10, 1983\n\ncompulsorily retiring the appellant from service, which was\n\nupheld by the State Administrative Tribunal. Allowing the\n\nappeal this Court held that the appellant had right to make\nrepresentation against the adverse entries within six\n\nmonths, and, therefore, the adverse entries awarded to him\n\nin the years 1981-82 and 1982-83 could not have been\n\ntaken into account either by the Review Committee or by\n\nthe State Government in forming the requisite opinion as\n\ncontemplated by Rule 71(1)(a) of the Orissa Service Code,\n\nbefore the expiry of the period of six months. According to\n\nthe Court, the proper course for the Review Committee\n\nshould have been not to consider those entries or in the\n\nalternative, the Review Committee should have waited for\n\nthe decision of the Government on the appellant's\n\nrepresentation. This Court in\nthe said decision\nemphasized\n\nthe purpose of communicating adverse entries and held\n\nthat delay in communication of adverse entries should be\n\navoided. This Court finds that the said case did not deal\n\nwith entry which had adverse reflection on the integrity of\n\nthe official concerned.\n\n94.\nIn\nS. Maheswar Rao Vs. State of Orissa and Another\n\n1989 Supp (2) SCC 248 the appellant was a\nSuperintending Engineer. His case was considered under\n\nthe first proviso to Rule 71(a) of the Orissa Service Code\n\nand on the basis of adverse remarks awarded to him for the\n\nlast three years, i.e., for the years 1980-81, 1981-82 and\n\n1982-83, the Review Committee had made recommendation\n\nfor his premature retirement. At that time his\n\nrepresentation against the adverse remarks relating to the\n\nfirst year was pending. Against the remarks for the other\n\nyears, he made representations subsequently and the State\n\nGovernment had without disposing of these representations\n\ncompulsorily retired him. The Bhubaneswar\n\nAdministrative Tribunal disapproved the taking into\n\nconsideration of the remarks for the first year but\n\nsustained the impugned order of compulsory retirement on\n\nthe basis of remarks for the subsequent years. While\n\nallowing the appeal this Court observed that adverse\n\nentries for the years 1981-82 and 1982-83 could not have\n\nbeen taken into consideration for the premature retirement\n\nof the appellant, and the Review Committee should have\n\ndeferred the consideration of his case till his representation\nagainst the aforesaid adverse entries was disposed of or in\n\nthe alternative the State Government itself should have\n\nconsidered and disposed of the representation before\n\nissuing the order for premature retirement. However, in\n\nthis case also, this Court finds that this was not a case of\n\nconsideration of adverse entry relating to the integrity of\n\nthe officer concerned.\n\n95. Though the learned counsel for the appellants have relied\n\nupon decision in\nV.K. Jain Vs. High\nCourt of Delhi\n\nthrough Registrar General and Others, (2008) 17 SCC\n\n538, this Court finds that basically\nthe said decision\ndeals\n\nwith expunction of adverse remarks made by the High\n\nCourt against a judicial officer while setting aside his\n\njudicial order granting bail to an accused. It emphasizes,\n\nthe judicial restraints to be exercised by the High Courts in\n\njudicial functions. It does not deal with compulsory\n\nretirement of a judicial officer or how to write his ACR.\n\nTherefore, detailed reference to the same is avoided.\n96. However, this Court finds that in\nUnion of India Vs. Col\n.\n\nJ.N. Sinha and Another, 1970 (2) SCC 458, the\n\nrespondent was compulsorily retired by the Government of\n\nIndia under Fundamental Rule 56(j). The said order was\n\nchallenged by the respondent amongst other things on the\n\nground that the lack of opportunity to show cause\n\namounted to denial of natural justice. The said plea was\n\naccepted by the High Court and High Court had issued a\n\nwrit of certiorari quashing the said order. In appeal this\n\nCourt held that a Government Servant serving under the\n\nUnion of India holds his office at the pleasure of the\n\nPresident, but this `pleasure' doctrine is subject to the rules\n\nor law made under\nArticle 309\nas well as to the conditions\n\nprescribed under\nArticle 311.\nThis Court firmly held that\n\nrules of natural justice are not embodied rules nor can they\n\nbe elevated to the position of fundamental rights, and the\n\nCourt cannot ignore the mandate of the Legislature or a\n\nstatutory authority. After holding that the compulsory\n\nretirement involves no civil consequences and that a\n\nGovernment servant does not lose any of the rights\nacquired by him before retirement, it was held that\n\nFundamental Rule 56 (j) holds the balance between the\n\nrights of the individual Government servant and the\n\ninterests of the public. According to this Court, while a\n\nminimum service is guaranteed to the Government servant,\n\nthe government is given power to energize its machinery\n\nand make it more efficient by compulsorily retiring those\n\nwho in its opinion should not be there in public interest.\n\nThus the plea of breach of principles of natural justice was\n\nnot accepted by this Court in the said case.\n\n97.\nIn\nBaikuntha Nath Das and Another Vs. Chief District\n\nMedical Officer, Baripada and Another\n, (1992) 2 SCC\n\n299, the three Judge Bench of this Court had occasion to\n\nconsider the question of effect of uncommunicated adverse\n\nremarks taken into consideration while passing order of\n\ncompulsory retirement against the appellants of that case\n\nand scope of judicial review of the order retiring an\n\nemployee compulsorily from service. The appellants in the\n\nappeals were compulsorily retired by the Government of\nOrissa in exercise of the power conferred upon it by the\n\nfirst Proviso to sub-rule (a) of Rule 71 of the Orissa Service\n\nCode. The appellant Mr. Baikuntha Nath Das was\n\nappointed as a Pharmacist by the Civil Surgeon,\n\nMayurbhanj on March 15, 1951. By an order dated\n\nFebruary 13 1976 the Government of Orissa had retired\n\nhim compulsorily. The said Order was challenged by him\n\nin the High Court of Orissa by way of a Writ Petition. His\n\ncase was that the order was based on no material and that\n\nit was the result of ill-will and malice, the Chief District\n\nMedical Officer bore towards him. According to him he\n\nwas transferred by the said officer from place to place and\n\nwas also placed under suspension at one stage, but his\n\nentire service had been spotless and that at no time were\n\nany adverse entries in his confidential character rolls\n\ncommunicated to him. In the counter affidavit filed on\n\nbehalf of the Government it was submitted that the\n\ndecision to retire him compulsorily was taken by the\n\nReview Committee and not by the Chief Medical Officer and\n\nit was stated that besides the remarks made in the\nconfidential character rolls, other material was also taken\n\ninto consideration by the Review Committee and that it had\n\narrived at its decision bona fide and in public interest\n\nwhich decision was accepted and approved by the\n\nGovernment. In the Counter the allegation of mala fide was\n\ndenied. The High Court had looked into the proceedings of\n\nthe Review Committee and the confidential character rolls\n\nof the appellant and dismissed the writ petition holding\n\nthat an order of compulsory retirement after putting in the\n\nprescribed qualifying period of service does not amount to\n\npunishment. The High Court had observed that the order\n\nin question was passed by the State Government and not\n\nby the Chief Medical Officer and did not suffer from vice of\n\nmalice. It was further held by the High Court that it was\n\ntrue that the confidential character roll of the appellant\n\ncontained several remarks adverse to him which were, no\n\ndoubt, not communicated to him.\n\nOn behalf of the\n\nappellants who were compulsorily retired reliance was\n\nplaced upon the decisions of this Court in\nBrij Mohan\n\nSingh Chopra Vs. State of Punjab\n, (1987) 2\nSCC 188 and\nBaidyanath Mahapatra\n(Supra) in support of the\n\ncontention that it was not permissible to the respondent\n\nGovernment to order compulsory retirement on the basis of\n\nmaterial which included uncommunicated adverse\n\nremarks, whereas on behalf of the respondent Government\n\nreliance was placed upon the decision in\nUnion of India\n\nVs. M.E. Reddy\n, (1980) 2 SCC 15, to contend that it was\n\npermissible to the Government to take into consideration\n\nuncommunicated adverse remarks also while taking a\n\ndecision to retire a Government servant compulsorily.\n\nA\n\nstudy of the decision rendered by the three Judge Bench of\n\nthis Court makes it evident that not less than twenty\n\nreported decisions of this Court were taken into\n\nconsideration and thereafter the Court has overruled the\n\ndecision in\nBaidyanath Mahapatra Vs. State of Orissa\n\n(1989) 4 SCC 664, which took the view that\n\nuncommunicated adverse remarks cannot be taken into\n\nconsideration while passing an order of compulsory\n\nretirement against a Government servant.\n98.\nIn\nBaikuntha Nath Das\ncase, after referring to decision of\n\nthis Court in\nBrij Mohan Singh Chopra Vs. State of\n\nPunjab\n(1987) 2 SCC 188, where a three Judge Bench of\n\nthis Court has specifically affirmed the decision rendered in\n\nUnion of India Vs. M.E. Reddy\n(1980) 2 SCC 15, this\n\nCourt has laid down following firm proposition of law stated\n\nin paragraph 34 of the reported decision:\n\n\"34. The following principles emerge from the above\n\ndiscussion:\n\n(i) An order of compulsory retirement is not a\n\npunishment. It implies no stigma nor any\n\nsuggestion of misbehaviour.\n\n(ii) The order has to be passed by the government\n\non forming the opinion that it is in the public\n\ninterest to retire a government servant\n\ncompulsorily. The order is passed on the\n\nsubjective satisfaction of the government.\n\n(iii) Principles of natural justice have no place in\n\nthe context of an order of compulsory\n\nretirement. This does not mean that judicial\n\nscrutiny is excluded altogether. While the High\n\nCourt or this Court would not examine the\n\nmatter as an appellate court, they may\n\ninterfere if they are satisfied that the order is\n\npassed (a) mala fide or (b) that it is based on\n\nno evidence or (c) that it is arbitrary -- in the\n\nsense that no reasonable person would form\n\nthe requisite opinion on the given material; in\n\nshort, if it is found to be a perverse order.\n(iv) The government (or the Review Committee, as\n\nthe case may be) shall have to consider the\n\nentire record of service before taking a decision\n\nin the matter -- of course attaching more\n\nimportance to record of and performance\n\nduring the later years. The record to be so\n\nconsidered would naturally include the entries\n\nin the confidential records/character rolls,\n\nboth favourable and adverse. If a government\n\nservant is promoted to a higher post\n\nnotwithstanding the adverse remarks, such\n\nremarks lose their sting, more so, if the\n\npromotion is based upon merit (selection) and\n\nnot upon seniority.\n\n(v) An order of compulsory retirement is not liable\n\nto be quashed by a Court merely on the\n\nshowing that while passing it\n\nuncommunicated adverse remarks were also\n\ntaken into consideration. That circumstance\n\nby itself cannot be a basis for interference.\n\nInterference is permissible only on the grounds\n\nmentioned in (iii) above..\"\n\n99.In view of the two three Judge Bench decisions of this\n\nCourt mentioned above the contention that adverse\n\nremarks relating to integrity regarding which no\n\nopportunity of making representation was provided or\n\npending representation was not considered and, therefore,\n\norders of compulsory retirement were bad in law cannot be\n\naccepted. Therefore, the said contention is hereby rejected.\n100.Another point which was canvassed for consideration of\n\nthe Court was that Rule 31A of DJS Rules incorporated\n\nsince 1.1.1996 covers entire field of age of retirement and\n\npremature retirement of Delhi Judicial Officers and,\n\ntherefore, premature retirement of the appellants could not\n\nhave been made before their attaining the age of 58 years.\n\nAccording to the learned counsel for the appellants Rule\n\n31A was added by notification dated 1.1.1996 issued by Lt.\n\nGovernor on the recommendation of the Delhi High Court\n\nunder\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution to DJS Rules on the\n\nsubject of retirement, providing the normal age of\n\nretirement as 60 years with proviso of compulsory\n\nretirement at the age of 58 years and for voluntary\n\nretirement at the age of 58 years and after addition of this\n\nRule, Rule 33 of DJS Rules could not have been invoked for\n\napplication of Fundamental Rules, on the subject of normal\n\nage of retirement, age of premature retirement and\n\nassessment of performance as well as age of voluntary\n\nretirement. What was emphasized was that after\n\nintroduction of Rule 31A in DJS Rules the subject of\npremature retirement cannot be considered to be a\n\nresiduary matter for which no Rule exists in DJS rules and,\n\ntherefore, premature retirement of the appellants could not\n\nhave been ordered before they attained the age of 58 years.\n\n101.The learned counsel for the High Court argued that this\n\npoint was given up before the High Court and, therefore,\n\nthe Court should not permit the appellants to agitate the\n\nsame in appeals arising from grant of special leave.\nIn\n\nsupport of this submission reliance was placed by the\n\nlearned counsel for the High Court on: (\n1) State of\n\nMaharashtra Vs. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak & Anr.\n, (1982)\n\n2 SCC 463, (2) Shankar K. Mandal & Ors. Vs. State of\n\nBihar & Ors., (\n2003) 9 SCC 519, (3) Mount Carmel\n\nSchool Society Vs. DDA\n, (\n2008) 2SCC 141, and (4)\n\nBhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. &\n\nOrs.\n, (2003) 2SCC 111.\n\n102.Without prejudice to the above contention, it was argued by\n\nthe learned counsel for the High Court that in\nAll India\n\nJudge's Association Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n, (1992) 1\nSCC 119, this Court directed that the age of retirement of\n\nthe judicial officers be increased to 60, and when a review\n\nwas filed, this Court in\nAll India Judges' Association and\n\nothers vs. Union of India and others\n(1993) 4 SCC 288,\n\nwhile maintaining that the judicial officers be permitted to\n\nserve up to the age of 60 years, imposed a condition that all\n\njudicial officers would not be entitled to the said benefit\n\nautomatically, but only those who were found fit after the\n\nevaluation of their fitness would be permitted to go up to\n\n60 years and this Court expressed the view that the\n\nstandard of evaluation could be the same as for compulsory\n\nretirement. The learned counsel emphasized that while\n\ngiving the said direction, this Court expressly and\n\nspecifically provided that the ordinary provisions relating to\n\ncompulsory retirement at earlier stages were not dispensed\n\nwith and they will continue to operate, and, therefore,\n\nincorporation of Rule 31A in the Delhi Judicial Service was\n\nmade but it is wrong to contend that Rule 31A overrides\n\nthe other provisions of the Rules and in particular, Rule 33\n\nread with Fundamental Rules which provide for\ncompulsory retirement after a judicial officer attains the\n\nage of 50 years. According to the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent, Rule 31A has no bearing and impact in\n\ndeciding whether the order of compulsory retirement\n\nagainst the appellant in terms of Rule 33 read with F.R.\n\n56(j) is valid or not.\n\n103.Though High Court in paragraph 45 of the impugned\n\njudgment has observed that the plea taken in the writ\n\npetition filed by Mr. Gupta that FR 56(j) read with Rule 33\n\nof the DJS Rules is not applicable after the introduction of\n\nRule 31 of the DJS rules, was dropped at the time of\n\nargument by the learned counsel for the appellant\n\nconceding that the order could have been passed under the\n\naforesaid provision, this Court finds that this was a\n\nconcession on point of law which would not bind the\n\nappellants. Further in the interest of justice it is necessary\n\nto settle the controversy once for all and, therefore, though\n\nin view of decisions cited by the learned counsel for the\n\nHigh Court, it is accepted as correct by this Court that the\npoint sought to be argued was dropped before the High\n\nCourt, it would not be in the interest of justice to preclude\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellants from agitating this\n\npoint before this Court. Under the circumstances, the\n\nCourt proposes to examine the said contention on merits.\n\n104.It is well known fact that in\nAll India Judge's Association\n\n(Supra), this Hon'ble Court in paragraph 63(iii) directed\n\nthat :\n\n\"Retirement age of judicial officers be raised to 60\n\nyears and appropriate steps are to be taken by\n\nDecember 31, 1992.\"\n\n105.In Second All India Judge's Association & Others Vs.\n\nUnion of India & Others, (1993) 4 SCC 288, this Court\n\nclarified in paragraph 30 of the said judgment as under :\n\n\"The benefit of the increase of the retirement age to\n\n60 years, shall not be available automatically to all\n\njudicial officers irrespective of their past records of\n\nservice and evidence of their continued utility to the\n\njudicial system...................The potential for\n\ncontinued utility shall be assessed and evaluated by\n\nappropriate Committees of Judges of the respective\n\nHigh Courts constituted and headed by the Chief\n\nJustice of the High Courts and the evaluation shall\n\nbe made on the basis of the judicial officer's past\nrecord of service, character rolls, quality of\n\njudgments and other relevant matters.\"\n\n106.In paragraph 31 of the reported decision this Court has\n\ninter alia observed that the standard of evaluation shall be\n\nas applicable to compulsory retirement. However what is\n\nrelevant to notice is paragraph 52 wherein this Court\n\nobserved and directed as under:-\n\n\"The assessment directed here is for evaluating the\n\neligibility to continue in service beyond 58 years of\n\nage and is in addition to and independent of the\n\nassessment for compulsory retirement that may\n\nhave to be undertaken under the relevant Service\n\nRules, at the earlier stage/s.\"\n\n107.In Nawal Singh Vs. State of U.P. & Another\n, (2003) 8\n\nSCC 117, this Court had again occasion to consider the\n\nobservations made in\nAll India Judge's Association\ncase\n\n(second) and after making reference to\nthe said decision\n\nthis Court observed as under :-\n\n\"..........there is no embargo on the competent\n\nauthority to exercise its power of compulsory\n\nretirement under Rule 56 of the Fundamental\n\nRules. As stated above, we have arrived at the\n\nconclusion that because of the increase in\n\nretirement age, rest of the Rules providing for\ncompulsory retirement would not be nugatory\n\nand are not repealed.\"\n\n108.Again in\nRamesh Chandra Acharya Vs. Registrary, High\n\nCourt of Orissa and Another, (2000) 6 SCC 332, this\n\nCourt observed in paragraph 8 of the reported decision that\n\n\"the Court thereafter clarified that the assessment at the\n\nage of 58 years is for the purpose of finding out suitability\n\nof the officers concerned for the entitlement of the benefit of\n\nthe increased age of superannuation from 58 years to 60\n\nyears; it is in addition to the assessment to be undertaken\n\nfor compulsory retirement and the compulsory retirement\n\nat the earlier stage/s under the respective service rules.\"\n\n109.In view of the direction contained in\nAll India Judge's\n\nAssociation\ncase Rule 31 was inserted in DJS Rules with\n\neffect from 1.1.1996 providing that the normal age of\n\nretirement of the Delhi Judicial Officers governed by D.J.S.\n\nRules would be 60 years. The potential for continued\n\nutility was to be assessed and evaluated at the age of 58\n\nyears because the benefit of the increase of the retirement\nage to 60 years was not available automatically to all\n\njudicial officers irrespective of their past records of service.\n\nThough this Court observed that the standard of evaluation\n\nfor determining the potential for continued utility should be\n\nthe same as for compulsory retirement but it was\n\nspecifically made clear that the assessment directed was for\n\nevaluating the eligibility to continue in service beyond 58\n\nyears of age and was in addition to and independent of the\n\nassessment for compulsory retirement that might have to\n\nbe undertaken under the relevant Service Rules at the\n\nearlier stage/s. The clarification made by this Court in\nAll\n\nIndia Judge's Association\ncase No. 2 leaves the matter in\n\nno doubt that the independent assessment for compulsory\n\nretirement to be undertaken under the relevant Service\n\nRules is not affected at all in any manner whatsoever. It is\n\ntrue that the performance of a judicial officer is to be\n\nevaluated for determining his utility to continue in service\n\nupto the age of 60 years but it is wrong to contend that\n\nRule 31 overrides Rule 33, which deals with residuary\n\nmatters which includes compulsory retirement of a judicial\nofficer after he attains the age of 50 years. It is rightly\n\ncontended by the learned counsel for the High Court that\n\nRule 31A has bearing and impact in deciding the question\n\nwhether the order of compulsory retirement against the\n\nappellant in terms of Rule 33 read with F.R. 56(j) is valid or\n\nnot. The newly added rule does not deal with the aspect of\n\ncompulsory retirement at all. In terms of Rule 33 the\n\nsubject of compulsory retirement did remain residuary even\n\nafter the introduction of Rule 31A in DJS Rules and,\n\ntherefore, the question of premature retirement will have to\n\nbe considered only under FR 56(j) and not under the newly\n\nadded Rule 31A. Thus consideration of the case of the\n\nappellant for premature retirement before he attained the\n\nage of 58 years cannot be regarded as illegal in any manner\n\nat all. This Court does not find any substance in this\n\ncontention raised on behalf of the appellant and, therefore,\n\nthe same is rejected.\n\n110.Another point which was pressed into service for\n\nconsideration of the Court was that the procedure of\nrecording ACR wherein the appellants were given adverse\n\nremarks was in violation of rules of principles of natural\n\njustice and as there was no material which would justify\n\nadverse entries in ACR's of the appellants, the same could\n\nnot have been taken into consideration while passing\n\norders of compulsory retirement. On behalf of the deceased\n\nMr. Verma it was argued that there was no material to\n\nretire him prematurely and it was admitted by the High\n\nCourt in his case that premature retirement was not\n\nordered because of complaints, but on the bona fide\n\nimpression and opinion formed by the High Court. It was\n\nalso argued on behalf of Mr. Verma that no inspection was\n\nmade, of the judicial work done by him for the years 1998,\n\n1999 and 2000 and as this fact was not denied in the\n\ncounter affidavit filed by the High Court, the order retiring\n\nhim compulsorily from service suffers from vice of malice in\n\nlaw, and should have been set aside by the High Court on\n\njudicial side. Mr. Rohilla who had argued his appeal in\n\nperson had contended that the order of compulsory\n\nretirement was expected to have been passed on the basis\nof all the material available prior to the passing of the order\n\nbut the material in respect of which he had made\n\nrepresentation which was pending to be replied or\n\nrepresentation against the material which was still required\n\nto be submitted, could not have been relied upon for\n\npassing order of compulsory retirement. According to him,\n\nthe so called material relied upon was only one-sided view\n\nand was not the wholesome exercise which was required to\n\nbe undertaken before passing order of compulsory\n\nretirement. Mr. Rohilla had further argued that there was\n\nno record of any complaints either oral or in writing nor\n\nthere was any record to show whether the complaints\n\nrelated to his judicial work on the basis of which ACR of\n\nthe year 2000 were recorded. The oral communication by\n\nmembers of the Bar or by office bearers of the Bar\n\nAssociation was thoroughly irrelevant in the absence of\n\nparticulars mentioned in the ACR and, could not have been\n\ntaken into consideration while passing order of compulsory\n\nretirement.\n111.On behalf of the appellant Mr. P.D. Gupta, it was\n\ncontended that for the year 2000 Hon'ble Mr. Justice\n\nM.S.A. Siddique was appointed as Inspecting Judge by the\n\nHigh Court but Hon'ble Mr. Justice Siddique had retired on\n\n29.5.2001 without giving any Inspection Report and he had\n\nnot inspected his Court during the year at all, whereas\n\nduring the year 2001, three Judges had been appointed as\n\nInspecting Judges namely Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dalveer\n\nBhandari (as he then was), Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mukul\n\nMudgal (as he then was) and Hon'ble Mr. Justice R.C.\n\nChopra, but the report for the year 2000 in his respect was\n\ngiven by Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.S. Gupta who was not the\n\nInspecting Judge either for the year 2000 or for the year\n\n2001 and as Hon'ble Mr. Justice Gupta had visited his\n\nCourt on 7.9.2001 and stayed only for ten minutes and\n\nasked him to send three judgments delivered in the year\n\n2000 which were sent by the appellant on 10.9.2001, the\n\nreport given by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Gupta grading him as\n\nan average officer could not have been taken into\n\nconsideration by the High Court while passing the order of\ncompulsory retirement. It was further pointed out on his\n\nbehalf that Hon'ble Mr. Justice Gupta had observed in his\n\nreport dated 11.9.2001 that on inquiry from the cross\n\nsection of Bar, he had come to know that Mr. Gupta did not\n\nenjoy good reputation and on the basis of this report, the\n\nFull Court in its meeting held on 21.9.2001 had graded his\n\nACR as `C' (integrity doubtful) without supplying the\n\nmaterial to him and, therefore, order retiring him\n\ncompulsorily from service was bad in law.\n\n112.In reply to abovementioned contentions it was argued by\n\nthe learned counsel for the High Court that a single adverse\n\nentry indicating that the integrity of the officer is doubtful\n\nis sufficient to order his compulsory retirement, even if the\n\nsaid adverse entry relates to a distant past and in respect\n\nof all the three appellants the last ACR for the year 2000 is\n\nC \"integrity doubtful\", which by itself is sufficient to sustain\n\norders of compulsory retirement passed against them.\n\n113.So far as Mr. M. S. Rohilla is concerned, it was submitted\n\nby the learned counsel for the respondent High Court that\nthere were two adverse ACR's for the years 1993 and 1994\n\nindicating that his integrity was doubtful and the\n\nrepresentations made by him against the same were\n\nconsidered and rejected, which decisions were not\n\nchallenged by him by way of a writ petition before the High\n\nCourt nor there was any challenge to the ACRs either in the\n\nearlier writ petition filed by him challenging his reversion\n\nfrom the Delhi Higher Judicial Service to the Delhi Judicial\n\nService nor in the writ petition challenging the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement and, therefore, order retiring him\n\ncompulsorily cannot be regarded as illegal or arbitrary.\n\n114.While dealing with the arguments advanced on behalf of\n\nthe appellant Mr. P.D. Gupta it was stressed that for two\n\nyears i.e. 1994 and 1995 his ACRs were C \"Integrity\n\nDoubtful\" which were challenged by him by filing a Writ\n\nPetition and though the learned Single Judge of the High\n\nCourt had allowed the Writ Petition, the Division Bench in\n\nappeal had set aside the judgment of the learned Single\n\nJudge and upheld the adverse ACRs \"C Doubtful Integrity\"\nfor the years 1994 and 1995, against which Special Leave\n\nPetition filed by Mr. P.D. Gupta was also dismissed after\n\nwhich Review Petition was filed by him against the\n\njudgment of the Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal,\n\nwhich was also dismissed and thus those entries having\n\nbecome final, it would be wrong to contend that order of\n\ncompulsory retirement passed in his case was liable to be\n\nset aside.\n\n115.On consideration of rival submissions, this Court finds that\n\nthere is no manner of doubt that the nature of judicial\n\nservice is such that the High Court cannot afford to suffer\n\ncontinuance in service of persons of doubtful integrity.\n\nTherefore, in High of Judicature at Bombay Through its\n\nRegistrar Vs. Shirishkumar Rangrao Patil and Another\n,\n\n(1997) 6 SCC 339, this Court emphasized that it is\n\nnecessary that there should be constant vigil by the High\n\nCourt concerned on its subordinate judiciary and self\n\nintrospection. It is well settled by a catena of decisions of\n\nthis Court that while considering the case of an officer as to\nwhether he should be continued in service or compulsorily\n\nretired, his entire service record upto that date on which\n\nconsideration is made has to be taken into account. What\n\nweight should be attached to earlier entries as compared to\n\nrecent entries is a matter of evaluation, but there is no\n\nmanner of doubt that consideration has to be of the entire\n\nservice record. The fact that an officer, after an earlier\n\nadverse entry, was promoted does not wipe out earlier\n\nadverse entry at all. It would be wrong to contend that\n\nmerely for the reason that after an earlier adverse entry an\n\nofficer was promoted that by itself would preclude the\n\nauthority from considering the earlier adverse entry. When\n\nthe law says that the entire service record has to be taken\n\ninto consideration, the earlier adverse entry, which forms a\n\npart of the service record, would also be relevant\n\nirrespective of the fact whether officer concerned was\n\npromoted to higher position or whether he was granted\n\ncertain benefits like increments etc.\n\nTherefore, this Court\n\nin\nState\nof Orissa and\nOthers\nVs. Ram Chandra Das\n,\n\n(1996) 5 SCC 331, observed as under in paragraph 7 of\nthe reported decision :-\n\n\"........ it is settled law that the Government is\n\nrequired to consider the entire record of service......\n\n.... We find that selfsame material after promotion\n\nmay not be taken into consideration only to deny\n\nhim further promotion, if any. But that material\n\nundoubtedly would be available to the Government\n\nto consider the overall expediency or necessity to\n\ncontinue the government servant in service after he\n\nattained the required length of service or qualified\n\nperiod of service for pension.\"\n\n116.Thus the respondent High Court was justified in taking\n\ninto consideration adverse ACRs reflecting on integrity of\n\nMr. M.S. Rohilla for the years 1993, 1994 and 2000 while\n\nconsidering the question whether it was expedient to\n\ncontinue him in service on his attaining the age of 50\n\nyears. Similarly, in so far as appellant Mr. P.D. Gupta is\n\nconcerned for two years that is 1994 and again in 1995 his\n\nACRs were C \"Integrity Doubtful\" and again in the year\n\n2000, the position was the same. Further, for two years,\n\ni.e., 1994 and 1995 his ACRs \"C Integrity Doubtful\" were\n\nupheld by the Division Bench of the High Court against\n\nwhich his Special Leave Petition was dismissed. At this\nstage it would be relevant to notice certain observations\n\nmade by Division Bench of the High Court while allowing\n\nthe Letters Patent Appeal filed by the High Court against\n\nthe judgment of the learned Single Judge by which the\n\nACRs for two years were set aside, which are as follows: -\n\n\"To summarize, it is held:\n\na) The adverse remarks recorded by the High\n\nCourt in the Confidential Reports of\n\nrespondent No.1 for the years 1994 and 1995\n\nwere not without any `material'. They were\n\nrecorded on the basis of material on record\n\nand the judgment of the learned Single Judge\n\nquashing those remarks is hereby set aside.\n\nb) The learned Single Judge should not and could\n\nnot have graded B+ to respondent No.1 as it is\n\nthe function of the High Court to assign\n\nappropriate grading. Therefore, the matter\n\nshould have been referred to the Full Court for\n\ngiving appropriate grading. This direction of\n\nthe learned Single Judge is accordingly set\n\naside.\n\nc) Direction of the learned Single Judge in\n\ntreating the petitioner as promoted w.e.f. 18th\n\nMay, 1996 is not correct in law and is\n\ntherefore, set aside.\"\n\n117.The above findings would indicate that the appellant Mr.\n\nGupta is not justified in arguing that there was no material\non the basis of which adverse entries could have been\n\nmade against him for the years 1994 and 1995 nor is he\n\njustified in urging that the order of compulsory retirement\n\nalso based on those two adverse entries is liable to be set\n\naside.\n\n118.In S.D. Singh vs. Jharkhand High\nCourt through R.G.\n\nand others (2005) 13 SCC 737, benefit of enhanced\n\nretirement age from 58 to 60 years was denied to the\n\nappellant. The Evaluation Committee, after perusing his\n\nservice record, recommended that he should not be\n\ncontinued in service beyond the age of 58 years. The Full\n\nCourt, on assessment and evaluation of service record,\n\nresolved that the benefit of extension in age up to 60 years\n\nshould not be extended to him. The appellant relied upon\n\nhis promotional order superseding several senior officers.\n\nHowever, he had not alleged mala fide against any one.\n\nThe Evaluation Committee had, after considering his ACR,\n\nnoted that he was an average officer and the vigilance\n\nproceedings initiated against him were dropped. While\ndismissing his appeal, this Court has held that there was\n\nmaterial, on the basis of which, an opinion was formed and\n\npromotion would not indicate that he was fit to be\n\ncontinued after the age of 58 years. The material,\n\naccording to this Court, against the appellant\nin that case\n,\n\nwas that he was an average officer and the vigilance\n\nproceedings initiated were dropped. If on these materials,\n\nbenefit of enhanced retirement was denied to Mr. S.D.\n\nSingh, this Court has no hesitation in concluding that\n\nhaving regard to the service record of the two appellants\n\nand the deceased officer, the High Court was justified in\n\ncompulsorily retiring them from service.\n\n119.The argument that material was not supplied on the basis\n\nof which \"`C' Doubtful Integrity\" was awarded to the\n\nappellants and, therefore, the order of compulsory\n\nretirement is liable to be set aside has no substance.\n\nNormally and contextually word `material' means\n\nsubstance, matter, stuff, something, materiality, medium,\n\ndata, facts, information, figures, notes etc. When this Court\nis examining as to whether there was any `material' before\n\nthe High Court on the basis of which adverse remarks were\n\nrecorded in the confidential reports of the appellants, this\n\n`material' relates to substance, matter, data, information\n\netc. While considering the case of a judicial officer it is not\n\nnecessary to limit the `material' only to written complaints\n\nor `tangible' evidence pointing finger at the integrity of the\n\njudicial officer. Such an evidence may not be forthcoming\n\nin such cases.\n\n120.As observed by this Court in\nR.L. Butail Vs. Union of\n\nIndia and Others\n, (1970) 2 SCC 876, it is not necessary\n\nthat an opportunity of being heard before recording adverse\n\nentry should be afforded to the officer concerned. In the\n\nsaid case, the contention that an inquiry would be\n\nnecessary before an adverse entry is made was rejected as\n\nsuffering from a misapprehension that such an entry\n\namounts to the penalty of censure. It is explained by this\n\nCourt in\nthe said decision\nthat making of an adverse entry\n\nis not equivalent to imposition of a penalty which would\nnecessitate an enquiry or giving of a reasonable opportunity\n\nof being heard to the concerned Government servant.\n\nFurther in case where the Full Court of the High Court\n\nrecommends compulsory retirement of an officer, the High\n\nCourt on the judicial side has to exercise great caution and\n\ncircumspection in setting aside that order because it is a\n\ncomplement of all the judges of the High Court who go into\n\nthe question and it is possible that in all cases evidence\n\nwould not be forth coming about doubtful integrity of a\n\nJudicial Officer.\n\n121.As observed by this Court in High Court of Punjab &\n\nHaryana through R.G. Vs. Ishwar Chand Jain and\n\nAnother, (1999) 4 SCC 579, at times, the Full Court has\n\nto act on the collective wisdom of all the Judges and if the\n\ngeneral reputation of an employee is not good, though there\n\nmay not be any tangible material against him, he may be\n\ngiven compulsory retirement in public interest and judicial\n\nreview of such order is permissible only on limited grounds.\n\nThe reputation of being corrupt would gather thick and\nunchaseable clouds around the conduct of an officer and\n\ngain notoriety much faster than the smoke. Sometimes\n\nthere may not be concrete or material evidence to make it\n\npart of the record. It would, therefore, be impracticable for\n\nthe reporting officer or the competent controlling officer\n\nwriting the confidential report to give specific instances of\n\nshortfalls, supported by evidence.\n\n122.Normally, the adverse entry reflecting on the integrity\n\nwould be based on formulations of impressions which\n\nwould be result of multiple factors simultaneously playing\n\nin the mind. Though the perceptions may differ in the very\n\nnature of things there is a difficulty nearing an\n\nimpossibility in subjecting the entries in the confidential\n\nrolls to judicial review. Sometimes, if the general\n\nreputation of an employee is not good though there may\n\nnot be any tangible material against him, he may be\n\ncompulsorily retired in public interest. The duty conferred\n\non the appropriate authority to consider the question of\n\ncontinuance of a judicial officer beyond a particular age is\nan absolute one. If that authority bona fide forms an\n\nopinion that the integrity of a particular officer is doubtful,\n\nthe correctness of that opinion cannot be challenged before\n\ncourts. When such a constitutional function is exercised\n\non the administrative side of the High Court, any judicial\n\nreview thereon should be made only with great care and\n\ncircumspection and it must be confined strictly to the\n\nparameters set by this Court in several reported decisions.\n\nWhen the appropriate authority forms bona fide opinion\n\nthat compulsory retirement of a judicial officer is in public\n\ninterest, the writ Court under\nArticle 226\nor this Court\n\nunder\nArticle 32\nwould not interfere with the order.\n\n123.Further this Court in\nM.S. Bindra\n's case (Supra) has used\n\nthe phrase `preponderance of probability' to be applied\n\nbefore recording adverse entry regarding integrity of a\n\njudicial officer. There is no manner of doubt that the\n\nauthority which is entrusted with a duty of writing ACR\n\ndoes not have right to tarnish the reputation of a judicial\n\nofficer without any basis and without any `material' on\nrecord, but at the same time other equally important\n\ninterest is also to be safeguarded i.e. ensuring that the\n\ncorruption does not creep in judicial services and all\n\npossible attempts must be made to remove such a virus so\n\nthat it should not spread and become infectious. When\n\neven verbal repeated complaints are received against a\n\njudicial officer or on enquiries, discreet or otherwise, the\n\ngeneral impression created in the minds of those making\n\ninquiries or the Full Court is that concerned judicial officer\n\ndoes not carry good reputation, such discreet inquiry and\n\nor verbal repeated complaints would constitute material on\n\nthe basis of which ACR indicating that the integrity of the\n\nofficer is doubtful can be recorded. While undertaking\n\njudicial review, the Court in an appropriate case may still\n\nquash the decision of the Full Court on administrative side\n\nif it is found that there is no basis or material on which the\n\nACR of the judicial officer was recorded, but while\n\nundertaking this exercise of judicial review and trying to\n\nfind out whether there is any material on record or not, it is\n\nthe duty of the Court to keep in mind the nature of\nfunction being discharged by the judicial officer, the\n\ndelicate nature of the exercise to be performed by the High\n\nCourt on administrative side while recording the ACR and\n\nthe mechanism/system adopted in recording such ACR.\n\n124.From the admitted facts noted earlier it is evident that\n\nthere was first a report of the Inspecting Judge to the effect\n\nthat he had received complaints against the appellants\n\nreflecting on their integrity. It would not be correct to\n\npresume that the Inspecting Judge had written those\n\nremarks in a casual or whimsical manner. It has to be\n\nlegitimately presumed that the Inspecting Judge, before\n\nmaking such remarks of serious nature, acted responsibly.\n\nThereafter, the Full Court considered the entire issue and\n\nendorsed the view of the Inspecting Judge while recording\n\nthe ACR of the appellants. It is a matter of common\n\nknowledge that the complaints which are made against a\n\njudicial officer, orally or in writing are dealt with by the\n\nInspecting Judge or the High Court with great caution.\n\nKnowing that most of such complaints are frivolous and by\ndisgruntled elements, there is generally a tendency to\n\ndiscard them. However, when the suspicion arises\n\nregarding integrity of a judicial officer, whether on the basis\n\nof complaints or information received from other sources\n\nand a committee is formed to look into the same, as was\n\ndone in the instant case and the committee undertakes the\n\ntask by gathering information from various sources as are\n\navailable to it, on the basis of which a perception about the\n\nconcerned judicial officer is formed, it would be difficult for\n\nthe Court either under\nArticle 226\nor for this Court under\n\nArticle 32\nto interfere with such an exercise. Such an\n\nopinion and impression formed consciously and rationally\n\nafter the enquiries of the nature mentioned above would\n\ndefinitely constitute material for recording adverse report in\n\nrespect of an officer. Such an impression is not readily\n\nformed but after Court's circumspection, deliberation, etc.\n\nand thus it is a case of preponderance of probability for\n\nentertaining a doubt about integrity of an official which is\n\nbased on substance, matter, information etc. Therefore, the\n\ncontention that without material or basis the adverse\nentries were recorded in the ACR of the appellants cannot\n\nbe upheld and is hereby rejected.\n\n125.On behalf of deceased R.S. Verma his learned Counsel had\n\nargued that ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were\n\nwritten in one go which is arbitrary and constitute malice\n\nin law. Pointing out to the Court that normal procedure\n\nfollowed by the Delhi High Court for communicating the\n\nACRs is referred to in the circular dated 4.9.1998,\n\naccording to which conducting of inspection and making of\n\nenquiries before condemning a judicial officer as regards\n\nhis integrity is necessary, but this was not done in the case\n\nof the deceased and, therefore, his ACRs for the years\n\n1997, 1998 and 1999 should have been ignored while\n\ndeciding the question whether he was fit to be retained in\n\nservice on attaining the age of 50 years. It was emphasized\n\nthat all the entries should be communicated within a\n\nreasonable period so that the employee concerned gets an\n\nopportunity to make representation and that the\n\nrepresentation is also decided fairly within a reasonable\nperiod, but this was not done in the case of the deceased\n\nofficer. According to the learned counsel for the appellant,\n\nthe requirement to write ACR on due date and\n\ncommunication thereof to the employee concerned within\n\nreasonable time flows from constitutional obligation of\n\nfairness, non-arbitrariness and natural justice as\nlaid down\n\nin\n\nDev Dutt Vs. Union of India\n, 2008 (\n8) SCC 725, and\n\nAbhijit Ghosh Dastidar Vs. Union of India\n, 2009 (16)\n\nSCC 146, and as this requirement was committed breach\n\nof in case of the deceased, ACRs for the years 1996 and\n\n1997 had lost their significance and were irrelevant while\n\nconsidering case of the deceased officer for compulsory\n\nretirement. On behalf of the respondent High Court it was\n\nsubmitted that it was true that ACRs for the years 1997,\n\n1998 and 1999 were recorded at one point and\n\ncommunicated thereafter, but a detailed note indicating the\n\ncircumstances in which ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and\n\n1999 were placed before the Full Court on 13.12.2000 after\n\nwhich ACRs were recorded and, therefore, in view of the\n\nexplanation offered in the note which was noted by the Full\nCourt on 13.12.2000, it is wrong to contend that ACRs for\n\nthose three years could not have been taken into\n\nconsideration before passing order of compulsory\n\nretirement against the deceased officer.\n\n126.On consideration of the argument advanced by the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties, this Court finds that it has been\n\nruled by this Court that ACRs for several years should not\n\nbe recorded at one go and communicated thereafter.\n\nNormally, entries in confidential records should be made\n\nwithin a specified time soon following the end of the period\n\nunder review and generally within three months from the\n\nend of the year. Delay in carrying out inspections or\n\nmaking entries frustrates the very purpose sought to be\n\nachieved. The mental impressions may fade away or get\n\nembellished. Events of succeeding years may cast their\n\nshadow on assessment of previous years. In a given case,\n\nproper inspection might not have been conducted nor\n\nnotes/findings of inspection might have been properly\n\nmaintained. In such a case, there is every possibility of a\njudicial officer being condemned arbitrarily for no fault on\n\nhis part. Therefore, recording of entries for more than one\n\nyear, later on, at the same time should be avoided.\n\nHowever, the learned counsel for the respondent is right in\n\ncontending that no decision has taken the view that merely\n\nfor the reason that ACRs for more than one years are\n\nrecorded at one point of time, the same are bad or that they\n\nwould cease to be ACRs for the relevant years or that they\n\nshould not be taken into consideration for any purpose or\n\nfor the purpose of compulsory retirement. As stated\n\nearlier, in the normal course it would not be appropriate to\n\nrecord the ACRs of number of years at one point of time.\n\nHowever, at the same time it is not possible to lay down as\n\nan absolute proposition of law that irrespective of good,\n\ncogent, plausible and acceptable reasons, recording of\n\nACRs of number of years at once should always be\n\nregarded as illegal and bad for all purposes. This Court,\n\nwhile deciding the appeals, has gone through the record of\n\nthe deceased officer, and other relevant documents\n\nproduced by the High Court. From the record, this Court\nfinds that all the columns of ACR forms for the years 1997,\n\n1998 and 1999 were filled up by the inspecting judges\n\nrespectively well in time for all these years, but the\n\ninspecting judges had not recorded any remarks\n\nconcerning the judicial reputation for honesty and\n\nimpartiality of the deceased officer as a corollary the\n\ncolumn regarding \"Net Result\" for these years were left\n\nblank by them. Instead the learned inspecting judges had\n\nobserved that these remarks be recorded by the Full Court.\n\nWhen such a course of action is adopted, the reason is\n\nobvious. There was something amiss in the estimation of\n\nthe learned inspecting Judges which they wanted entire\n\nFull Court to consider and, therefore, refrained from\n\nmaking their observations. If everything had been all right,\n\nnothing prevented the learned Inspecting Judges from\n\nmentioning that the honesty of the deceased officer was not\n\nin doubt at all. However, when an inspecting judge\n\nreceives certain complaints about the integrity of the officer\n\nconcerned but has no means to verify the same, he leaves\n\nthe matter to the Full Court, which appoints a Committee\nto go into the aspects and records relevant entries after\n\nreport of the Committee is received. This is what precisely\n\nhappened in the present case as well. Because of the\n\naforesaid course adopted by the learned Inspecting Judges,\n\nthe consideration of recording the ACR was deferred by the\n\nFull Court and ultimately, in its meeting held on 21.4.2001\n\nin respect of the deceased officer the Full Court decided as\n\nunder :-\n\n\"Deferred. Referred to the Committee constituted to\n\nlook into the allegations against the judicial\n\nOfficers.\"\n\n127.The matter was, therefore, examined by the Committee of\n\ntwo learned judges of the Delhi High Court constituted for\n\nthis purpose. This committee made certain discreet\n\ninquiries. The concerned Inspecting Judge(s) were also\n\nassociated in deliberations by the Committee. The\n\nCommittee gave its report dated 6.12.2001 as per which\n\nthe information gathered by the Committee from various\n\nsources confirmed the allegation of doubtful integrity\n\nagainst the deceased officer. The matter was thereafter\nplaced before the Full Court and the ACRs of the deceased\n\nofficer were recorded for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 on\n\n13.12.2000. Thus there is sufficient explanation for\n\nrecording the ACRs of three years at one time. It is wrong\n\nto contend that the ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and\n\n1999 should have been ignored while passing the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement against the deceased officer.\n\nTherefore, the argument that ACRs for those years could\n\nnot have been taken into consideration while deciding the\n\nquestion of suitability or otherwise to continue the\n\ndeceased officer in service on attaining the age of 50 years,\n\nis hereby rejected. Even if it is assumed for the sake of\n\nargument that ACRs recorded for the three years, i.e.,\n\n1997, 1998 and 1999 recorded at one go, irrespective of\n\nreasons, good, bad or indifferent, must be ignored for all\n\ntime to come and for all the purposes, this Court finds that\n\nthe ACRs for the year 1999 were recorded with promptitude\n\nand without any delay in the year 2000. It is not argued on\n\nbehalf of the deceased officer that there was any delay in\n\nrecording ACRs for the year 1999. For the year 1999, the\ndeceased officer was assessed as \"C Below Average\". The\n\nACRs for the year 1999 could have been taken into\n\nconsideration while assessing the service record of the\n\ndeceased officer for determining the question whether the\n\ndeceased officer was fit to be continued in service on his\n\nattaining the age of 50 years. What is the effect of ACRs for\n\nthe year 1999 when taken into consideration along with\n\nother service record is proposed to be considered at a little\n\nlater stage.\n\n128.On behalf of deceased officer Mr. R.S. Verma, it was\n\nargued that Mr. Verma's ACRs for the years 1997, 1998\n\nand 1999, which were written at one go and also were\n\ncommunicated at one go, suffer from arbitrariness,\n\nunreasonableness and constitute malice in law. This Court\n\nhas come to the conclusion that writing of ACRs for the\n\nyears 1997, 1998 and 1999 at one time as also\n\ncommunication of the same at one time was justified in the\n\ncircumstances of the case. Therefore, it is difficult to\n\nuphold the contention raised on behalf of Mr. Verma that\nwriting of ACRs for three years at one go and\n\ncommunication of the same at one go suffer from\n\narbitrariness, unreasonableness and constitute malice in\n\nlaw.\n\n129.Similarly, the plea raised by Mr. Rohilla that the\n\nimpugned judgment is not sustainable in law because the\n\nact of the High Court in making recommendation to Lt.\n\nGovernor for retiring him compulsorily emanates from mala\n\nfide, arbitrariness and perversity, has no substance. The\n\nreason given by Mr. Rohilla to treat the order of his\n\ncompulsory retirement as mala fide, arbitrary and perverse\n\nis that while communicating adverse remarks for the year\n\n2000 vide letter dated 21.9.2001, High Court had granted\n\nsix weeks' time to make representation, but much before\n\nthe representation could be caused, the order of\n\ncompulsory retirement dated 27.9.2001 was\n\ncommunicated, coupled with the fact that on that date, the\n\nwrit petition filed by him against his reversion was pending.\n\nThis Court has already taken the view that merely because\nMr. Rohilla did not get any opportunity to make\n\nrepresentation against the adverse remarks for the year\n\n2000, those remarks could not have been ignored by the\n\ncompetent authority while passing the order of compulsory\n\nretirement against him because the settled law is that even\n\nuncommunicated adverse remarks can be taken into\n\nconsideration while passing the order of compulsory\n\nretirement. So far as the writ petition, filed by Mr. Rohilla\n\nagainst his reversion is concerned, this Court finds that the\n\norder of compulsory retirement was not passed to render\n\nthe said petition infructuous. The order of compulsory\n\nretirement has been passed on assessment of whole service\n\nrecord of Mr. Rohilla. Thus, Mr. Rohilla has failed to\n\nsubstantiate the plea that the order of his compulsory\n\nretirement is either mala fide or arbitrary or perverse.\n\n130.Mr. R. S. Rohilla had argued that the order of the Lt.\n\nGovernor compulsorily retiring him from service was by\n\ninvoking FR 56(j) which was not applicable to his case as\n\nhe was a member of a Delhi Higher Judicial Service and\nsuch an order could have been passed only under Rule 27\n\nof the Delhi Higher Judicial Service read with Rule 16 of\n\nthe Indian Administrative Services and, therefore, the same\n\nshould be set aside. It is rightly pointed out by the learned\n\ncounsel for the High Court that though the said plea was\n\nraised by Mr. Rohilla the same was given up before the\n\nHigh Court, and it is so recorded by the Division Bench in\n\nparagraph 31 of the impugned judgment. Thus, in normal\n\ncircumstances, Mr. Rohilla would not be justified in\n\narguing the same point before this Court. However, even if\n\nit is taken for granted that he is entitled to argue the point\n\nbefore this Court because it is a pure question of law, this\n\nCourt does not find any substance what so ever in the\n\nsame. What is relevant to be noticed is that under both the\n\nRules there is power to compulsorily retire a judicial officer\n\nafter he attains the age of 50 years in public interest.\n\nTherefore, whether the Lt. Governor had invoked FR 56 (j)\n\nor Rule 27 of the DJS is of little consequence since both the\n\nRules make provision for retirement of a judicial officer\n\ncompulsorily from service after he attains the age of 50\nyears in public interest. In fact Mr. Rohilla should have\n\npointed out to the High Court the relevant and material fact\n\nthat for two years that is for the year 1993 and for the year\n\n1994 he had suffered adverse ACR `C' \"Integrity Doubtful\"\n\nand that the representations made by him were rejected\n\nwhich were not challenged by him before higher forum. In\n\nany view of the matter, it is settled law that when power\n\ncan be traced to a valid source, the fact that the power is\n\npurported to have been exercised under a wrong provision\n\nof law, would not invalidate exercise of power.\n\n131.To sum up, this Court finds that so far as deceased officer\n\nMr. Rajinder Singh Verma is concerned, he was appointed\n\nin the year 1995 and as on 21.9.2001 his ACRs for six\n\nyears were available. The grading given to him for these\n\nyears was as follows: -\n\nYear Grading\n\n1995 \"B\" (Average) No representation was\n\nmade against this\n\nremark, nor was it\n\nchallenged before any\n\nauthority.\n\n1996 \"B\" (Average) No representation was\nmade against this\n\nremark, nor was it\n\nchallenged before any\n\nauthority.\n\n1997 \"C\" (Below Average)\n\n1998 \"C\" (Below Average)\n\n1999 \"C\" (Below Average)\n\n2000 \"C\" (Integrity doubtful)\n\n132.The report dated September 21, 2001 of the Screening\n\nCommittee further reveals that the Screening Committee\n\nhad considered the entire record relevant to his work and\n\nconduct and found that throughout his career, he had been\n\nassessed and graded either as \"average officer\" or \"officer\n\nbelow average\" and in the year 2000, his integrity was\n\nfound to be doubtful. The Screening Committee had also\n\nfound that for the year 1998, the Inspecting Judge of Mr.\n\nVerma had made a remark that the judgments and orders\n\nwritten by him were just average; whereas the Inspecting\n\nJudges for the year 1996 to 2000 had not recorded any\n\nremark concerning his judicial reputation for honesty and\nimpartiality and the column \"Net Result\" was left to be\n\nrecorded by the Full Court. The record further shows that\n\nthe judicial work was withdrawn from him with effect from\n\nDecember 8, 2000 upon the recommendation of the\n\nCommittee of Judges in its report dated December 6, 2000.\n\nThis decision was never challenged by him before any\n\nauthority. It goes without saying that withdrawal of\n\njudicial work from a judicial officer is a serious matter and\n\nsuch a drastic order would not have been passed unless\n\nthe judicial work performed by him was found to be\n\nshocking and perverse. Later on, all work including\n\nadministrative work was withdrawn from him. Further,\n\npursuant to the decision taken by the Full Court in its\n\nmeeting held on April 21, 2001 referring the matter to a\n\nCommittee of Judges to make inquiry into his work and\n\nconduct, the Committee had submitted its report dated\n\nSeptember 8, 2001 in which it was observed and recorded\n\nthat he did not enjoy good reputation and integrity. There\n\nwas gradual down fall in his performance as a judicial\n\nofficer. The service record of the deceased officer is so\nglaring that on the basis thereof any prudent authority\n\ncould have come to a reasonable conclusion that it was not\n\nin the public interest to continue him in service and that he\n\nshould be compulsorily retired from service. Therefore, the\n\norder of compulsory retirement passed against the\n\ndeceased officer is not liable to be set aside.\n\n133.So far as Mr. Rohilla is concerned, he was appointed as a\n\nCivil/Sub-Judge in the Subordinate Judicial Services on\n\nMay 5, 1972. On June 17, 1995, he was confirmed as an\n\nofficer in the Delhi Judicial Services. He was granted\n\nSelection Grade on June 3, 1980 and was promoted to the\n\nHigher Judicial Services as Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge on November 1, 1989. One anonymous complaint\n\nwas received against him and after looking into the same,\n\nhe was reverted to Subordinate Judicial Services by order\n\ndated February 15, 1995, which was challenged by him in\n\nWrit Petition No. 4589 of 1995. Meanwhile, he was served\n\nwith a communication from the High Court of Delhi dated\n\nOctober 23, 1997, wherein his ACR for the year 1996 was\ngraded as \"C\", i.e., below average. Thereupon, he had\n\nmade a representation, which was rejected on December 2,\n\n1998. No steps were taken by him to challenge\nthe said\n\ndecision\nand thus, the grading awarded to him was\n\naccepted by him. Thereafter, he received a communication\n\nfrom the High Court in the year 1999, wherein he was\n\ninformed that in his ACR for the year 1997, he was\n\nawarded \"B\" grade. Again, by a communication dated\n\nFebruary 9, 2000 forwarded by the High Court, he was\n\ninformed that in his ACR for the year 1998, he was graded\n\n\"B\". He made a representation against his ACR for the year\n\n1998 in the year 2000. As noticed earlier, in the year 2000,\n\nhe was communicated ACR indicating that his integrity was\n\ndoubtful. Thus, the service record of Mr. Rohilla indicates\n\nthat he was an officer \"below average\" or at the best an\n\naverage officer and his integrity was doubtful. Under the\n\ncircumstances, the decision taken by the competent\n\nauthority to retire him from service cannot be said to be\n\nillegal in any manner whatsoever.\n134.So also, the record of Mr. P.D. Gupta shows that he\n\njoined Delhi Judicial Service on January 28, 1978.\n\nAdmittedly, his work and conduct from 1978 to 1992 was\n\ngraded as \"B\", which means his performance was that of an\n\naverage officer. In the year 1995, the Inspecting Judge had\n\nreported that though he had not inspected the court of Mr.\n\nGupta, he had heard complaints about his integrity and,\n\ntherefore, column Nos. 6 and 7 were left blank to be filled\n\nup by the Full Court. On May 18, 1986, the Full Court had\n\nrecorded his ACR for the year 1994-95 as \"C\" (integrity\n\ndoubtful) and on the basis of the same, denied promotion\n\nto him. He had filed a representation against the same, but\n\nit was rejected by the High Court by an order dated\n\nSeptember 5, 1997. Again on September 26, 1997, the Full\n\nCourt of Delhi High Court had recorded his ACR for the\n\nyear 1996 as \"B\". Against rejection of his representation,\n\nwhich was made with reference to ACRs for the year 1994-\n\n95, he had filed Writ Petition (C) No. 4334 of 1997 and in\n\nthe said writ petition he had made a grievance for his non-\n\npromotion to Delhi Higher Judicial Service. Pending the\nsaid petition, on May 22, 1998, the Full Court had recorded\n\nhis ACR for the year 1997 as \"B\". The writ petition filed by\n\nMr. Gupta was allowed by a Single Judge of the High\n\nCourt, which decision was set aside in L.P.A. No. 329 of\n\n1999, filed by the High Court administration, and the order\n\npassed by the Division Bench was ultimately upheld by this\n\nCourt when the special leave petition filed by Mr. Gupta\n\nagainst the decision rendered in the L.P.A. was dismissed.\n\nIn his ACR for the year 2000, he was categorized as an\n\nofficer having doubtful integrity. Thus, the record shows\n\nthat for the year 1994-95 his integrity was found to be of\n\ndoubtful character. For rest of the years, his performance\n\nwas that of an average officer and in the year 2000, his\n\nintegrity was again found doubtful. Under the\n\ncircumstances, the compulsory retirement of Mr. Gupta\n\ncan never be said to be arbitrary or illegal.\n\n135.Having regard to their entire service record of the three\n\nofficers, this Court is of the opinion that the competent\n\nauthority was justified in passing the order retiring them\ncompulsorily from service. Mere glance at the ACRs of the\n\ndeceased officer and two other appellants makes it so\n\nglaring that on the basis thereof the decision to\n\ncompulsorily retire them would clearly be without blemish\n\nand will have to be treated as well founded. This Court\n\nfinds that before passing the orders in question, whole\n\nservice record of each of the officer was taken into\n\nconsideration. Keeping in view the comprehensive\n\nassessment of service record, the Screening Committee\n\nrightly recommended that the three officers should be\n\nprematurely retired in public interest forthwith. The Full\n\nCourt after considering the report of the Screening\n\nCommittee and also after taking into consideration the\n\nrecord of work and conduct, general reputation and service\n\nrecord of the three officers correctly resolved that it be\n\nrecommended to the Lt. Governor of NCT of Delhi to retire\n\nthe judicial officers forthwith in public interest. The orders\n\ndo not entail any punishment in the sense that all the\n\nofficers have been paid retiral benefits till they were\n\ncompulsorily retired from service.\n136.On a careful consideration of the entire material, it must\n\nbe held that the evaluation made by the Committee/Full\n\nCourt, forming their unanimous opinion, is neither so\n\narbitrary nor capricious nor can be said to be so irrational,\n\nso as to shock the conscience of this Court to warrant or\n\njustify any interference. In cases of such assessment,\n\nevaluation and formulation of opinions, a vast range of\n\nmultiple factors play a vital and important role and no one\n\nfactor should be allowed to be blown out of proportion\n\neither to decry or deify an issue to be resolved or claims\n\nsought to be considered or asserted. In the very nature of\n\nthings, it would be difficult, nearing almost an impossibility\n\nto subject such exercise undertaken by the Full Court, to\n\njudicial review except in an extraordinary case when the\n\nCourt is convinced that some real injustice, which ought\n\nnot to have taken place, has really happened and not\n\nmerely because there could be another possible view or\n\nsomeone has some grievance about the exercise\n\nundertaken by the Committee/Full Court. Viewed thus,\n\nand considered in the background of the factual details and\nmaterials on record, there is absolutely no need or\n\njustification for this Court to interfere with the impugned\n\nproceedings. Therefore, the three appeals fail and are\n\ndismissed. Having regard to the facts of the case, there\n\nshall be no order as to costs.\n\n....................................J.\n\n(J.M.
