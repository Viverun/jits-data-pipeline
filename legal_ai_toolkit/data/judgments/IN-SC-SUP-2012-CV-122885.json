Further issue a Writ in the nature of Mandamus and /\nor any other appropriate writ / order / direction of like\nnature thereby directing the respondents no. 1 and 2 to\nadopt the Post-Based Roster for the purposes of promotion\nformulated on 02.07.1997 by the Department of Personnel\nand Training, Government of India under the directions of\nHon‟ble Supreme Court of India.\"\n\n2. Brief facts of the case are that petitioners were appointed as JE\n(Civil) from General Category on 10.01.1983 by the Office of the\nSlum and J.J. Department, which was under the Delhi Development\nAuthority at that point of time. The petitioners are qualified Engineers\nholding Diploma in Civil Engineering from the respective Universities.\n\n3. In the year 1992, Office of the Slum and JJ Department was\ntransferred to Municipal Corporation of Delhi on as is where is basis\nand thus the petitioners continued to work as JEs.\n\n4. The Department of Personnel and Training, Government of\nIndia vide O.M. No. 36012/2/96-Estt. (Res.) dated 02.07.1997 decided\nthat the existing 200-point, 40-point and 120-point Vacancy-Based\nRosters shall be replaced by Post-Based Rosters. Thus, all the\nDepartments were required to prepare respective Rosters based on the\nprinciple elaborated in the aforesaid O.M. and illustrated by the Model\nRosters annexed to the O.M. as Annexure II, III and IV. Annexure III,\nwhich is the Model Roster of reservation with reference to posts for the\npurposes of promotion, is annexed as Annexure P-2 to the present Writ\nPetition.\n\n5. It is submitted by the petitioners that the promotions made after\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 2 of 27\n\n1997 to the Post of AE in the Department specifically keeping in view\nthe backlog to be completed and in this respect the last promotions\ncarried out on 05.09.2002 which were 18 in number, 06 candidates\nfrom the Reserved Category i.e. SC/ST whereas from the General\nCategory there were 12 promotions in total which means that it clearly\nexceeded the reservation quota of 22.5% for the Reserved Category.\nEven prior to that, i.e. on 06.08.1996 there were total promotions of 16\npersons, out of which six persons belonged to Reserved Category and\n10 persons from General Category.\n\n6. Mr. Rajat Aneja, ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of the\npetitioners has pointed out that the backlog had already been achieved\nand prescribed percentage of reservation, i.e., 15% for SC and 7.5% for\nST had also been put in place. Therefore, any more promotion from\nthe Reserved Category would exceed the prescribed percentage of\n22.5% and would thus be in violation of Post-Based Roster formulated\nunder the direction of the Apex Court. The copy of the Chart relating\nto the promotion made in the Department with respect to the said Post\nafter 1996 is annexed as Annexure P-4, which is as under:\n\n\"The Addl. Commissioner (S&JJ) vide his order dated\n04.09.2002 has been pleased to promote the following\nJunior Engineers (C) to the post of Asst. Engineer (C) in the\npay scale of Rs.6,500-200-10,500/- purely on ad-hoc and\nemergent basis with immediate effect:\n\nS. NO. Name\n\n1. Sh. Subodh Kumar Mittal.\n2. Sh. Y.P.

Naveen Gulati\n17. Sh. Dori Lal (SC)\n18. Sh. V.S. Fonia (ST)\"\n\n7. The petitioners, being aggrieved, made a representation on\n04.10.2004 through their Association in the light of the fact that SC\nAssistant Engineers were already in excess of 4 seats in respect of their\nexisting quota earmarked for the Scheduled Castes by the Government\nof India, no further promotion could be given to the SC Categories as\nproposed by them.\n\n8. Counsel for the petitioners have further submitted that the\nrespondents did not reply to the representation of the petitioners and on\nthe contrary issued a letter dated 06.10.2004 fixing the date of review\nDPC as 08.10.2004 at 4 PM in the Chamber of Chief Engineer,\nChairman of DPC. The said meeting notice also referred to some\nrecommendations by National Commission for Scheduled Caste.\n\n9. Another representation made on 20.10.2004 reiterating the\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 4 of 27\n\nearlier request was again sent to the respondents, however, the\nrespondents failed to accede to the legitimate request of the petitioners\nand proceeded with the promotion process by conducting review DPC\nin the near future.\n\n10. Counsel for the petitioners has pointed out that DDA (Slum)\nSC/ST Engineers Association (Regd.) filed a Writ Petition (C) No.\n3126/1992 titled as\nDDA (Slum) SC/ST Engineers Association (Regd.)\nand Ors. vs. DDA and Ors. In\nthe said petition, Engineers Association\nmade the following prayers:\n\n(i) That the act of non consideration of the petitioner 2 to\n5 and other similarly placed persons in the Cadre of JE\n(Civil) for promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer\n(Civil) under Respondent no. 2 against the reserved post of\nAE (Civil) for SC / ST Candidates by the respondents 1 & 2\nis arbitrary, illegal, discriminatory and consequently further\ndeclaration that the petitioners and other similarly placed\npersons are entitled for being considered for promotion to\nthe posts of AE (Civil) under Respondent no. 2 against 14\nposts reserved for SC / ST Category.\n\n(ii) That the proposed act of the Respondent for de-\nreserving the 14 Posts of A.E (Civil) or any other posts -\nreserved for SC / ST Category of candidates is arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory and illegal.\n\n(iii) That act of Respondent 1 & 2 appointing the JE\n(Civil) as AE (Civil) as on current basis and non grant of\npay based on equal pay for equal work and other\nconsequential relief.\n\n(iv) Direction / order against all the respondents and in\nparticular 1 to 4 restraining them from de-reserving the 14\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 5 of 27\n\nposts or any other posts for AE (Civil) arbitrarily and\nwithout following the due procedure on the subject.\n\n(v) Direction, order against respondent 1 & 2 directing\nthem to consider the plaintiffs and other similarly placed\nJEs (Civil) for promotion to the 14 posts of AE (Civil)\nagainst the reserved posts for SC / ST Category and further\ndirections to give them consequential benefits therefor\nwithin the stipulated period by holding special D.P.C.\n\n11. Ld. Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that respondents\nhave no power or authority to promote respondent no. 4 & 5 in the\nlight of the dictum\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in the case of\nR.K.\nSabharwal vs. State of Punjab\n(1995) 2 SCC 745 wherein it is held\nthat the reservation of jobs for the backward classes, i.e., SC / ST /\nOBC should apply to the post and not to vacancies. It is further held\nthat the Vacancy-Based Roster can operate only till such time the\nrepresentation of persons belonging to the Reserved Category in a\ncadre reaches a prescribed percentage of reservation. Therefore, the\nRoster cannot operate and vacancies released by recruitment,\nresignation, promotion etc. of the persons belonging to General and\nReserved Categories are to be filled up by appointment of the persons\nfrom the Reserved Categories so that prescribed percentage of\nreservation is maintained.\n\n12. Pursuant to these observations, the Department of Personnel and\nTraining (DOP&T) vide O.M. dated 02.07.1997 decided that existing\n200-point, 40-point and 120-point Vacancy-Based Roster shall be\nreplaced by the Post-Based Roster. Thus, all the Departments were\nrequired to prepare their respective Rosters based on the principle\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 6 of 27\n\nelaborated in the aforesaid O.M. and illustrated by the Model Rosters\nannexed to the said O.M. The aforesaid Roster clearly stipulates 16\nseats cumulatively for Reserved Category, i.e., SC/ST which is\ncalculated on the basis of current sanctioned strength of 76 AEs in the\nDepartment. Moreover, it is also not a matter of dispute that there\nwere 14 SC candidates who were functioning as AEs which were in\nexcess of 3 seats. Thus, respondent Nos. 4 & 5 who are from the\nReserved Category could not be allowed to be promoted to the Post of\nAEs.\n\n13. It is pertinent to mention here that by amending the Writ Petition\nrespondent no. 5 Sh. D.K. Singh was also made a party to the instant\npetition.\n\n14. Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon a clarification dated\n23.01.1998 made on Post-Based Reservation Roster. The same is as\nunder:\n\n\"C. & A.G, Cir. No. 9/NGE/98 No. 108/NGE (App.)/3-97\ndated 23-1-1998\nSubject:- Clarifications regarding Post-Based\nreservation rosters.\n\nConsequent on issue of Government of India, Department of\nPersonnel & Training O.M.

Whether the new revised Government orders on post-\nrosters will be effective based rosters are effective\nfrom the panel year 1998, from July 2, 1997.\ni.e., 1-1-1998 and whether Recruitments/promotions made\nthe concept of „panel year‟ on or after July 2, 1997 have\nand „cut off date‟ (1st to be based on post-based\nOctober of the panel year) Rosters.\nwill continue to be\napplicable?\n7.(a) How the total Representation of each\nrepresentation of reserved reserved category is first to\ncategories in a cadre is to be determined separately as\nbe determined when the per the prescribed\n\npercentage of reservation in percentages of reservation\npromotion and in direct applicable to different\nrecruitment are different? methods of appointment, i.e.\npromotion and direct\nrecruitment and then the total\nrepresentation of respective\nreserved category in the\ncadre is to be worked out\n\n7.(c) How the excess or less The representation of\nrepresentation of a reserved respective reserved\ncategory ( or categories) in categories should not exceed\nseparate methods of the prescribed percentages,\nappointment in a cadre are as worked out in Sl.

Ld. Counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon Office\nMemorandum dated 20.07.2000, on backlog, which is reproduced as\nunder:\n\n\" G.I., Dept. Of Per. & Trg., O.M. No. 36012/5/97-\nEstt.(Res.)Vol.II dated 20.07.2000\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 9 of 27\n\nSubject:-Backlog vacancies reserved for SCs & STs would\nbe treated as a distinct group and would not be subject to\n50% ceiling.\n\n2. In pursuance of the provisions of\nArticle 16 (4-B)\nof\nthe Constitution, it has been decided that in partial\nmodification of the instructions issued vide this\nDepartment‟s O.M. No. 36012/5/97-Estt.(Res.) dated 29-8-\n1997, the reserved vacancies for Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes in all cases of direct recruitment and\npromotion, wherever applicable, which have remained\nunfilled in the earlier year(s), i.e., backlog and / or carried\nforward vacancies would be treated as a separate and\ndistinct group and will not be considered together with the\nreserved vacancies of the year in which they are being\nfilled up for determining the ceiling of 50 per cent\nreservation on total number of vacancies of that year. In\nother words, the ceiling of 50 per cent on filing up of\nreserved vacancies would apply only on the reserved\nvacancies which arise in the current year and the backlog /\ncarried forward reserved vacancies for SCs/STs of earlier\nyears would be treated as a separate and distinct group\nand would not be subject to any ceiling. However, backlog\nand/or carried forward reservation will automatically\nlapse in a cadre as soon as combined representation of a\nreserved category in direct recruitment as well as\npromotion is either equal to or more than the prescribed\nnumber of reserved posts in the relevant post-based\nrosters.\n\n3. As the Ministries are aware, reservation with effect from\n2-7-1997 is linked to post-based rosters. The backlog of\nvacancies would be determined with reference to the post-\nbased rosters keeping in view the instructions issued vide\nthis Department‟s O.M. No. 36012/2/96-Estt.(Res.) dated\n2-7-1997.\"\n\n16. He further relied upon Office Memorandum dated 31-01-2005,\nwhich is reproduced as under:\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 10 of 27\n\n\" G.I., Dept. Of Per. & Trg., O.M. No.\n36028/17/2001-Estt.(Res.) dated 31.01.2005\nSubject:- Reservation in promotion - Treatment of SC / ST\ncandidates promoted on their own merit.\n\nThe undersigned is directed to refer to this Department‟s\nO.M. No. 36028/17/2001-Estt. (Res.) dated 11-7-2002\nwhereby it was clarified that the Scheduled Caste and\nScheduled Tribe candidates appointed by promotion on\ntheir own merit and not owing to reservation or relaxation\nof qualification will be adjusted against unreserved points.\nReferences have been received seeking clarification on the\nfollowing points:-\n\n(i) The date of effect of the O.M. No. 36028/17/2001-\nEstt. (Res.), dated 11-07-2002; and\n\n(ii) Whether the order will apply in case of promotions\nmade by non-selection method.\"\n\n17. Further relied upon Office Memorandum dated 06-11-2003,\nwhich is reproduced as under:\n\n\" G.I., Dept. Of Per. & Trg., O.M. No.\n36012/17/2002-Estt.(Res.) dated 06.11.2003\nSubject:- Non-permissibility of exchange of reservations\nbetween SC and ST.\n\nThe undersigned is directed to say that after introduction\nof post-based reservation, various Ministries /\nDepartments have been seeking clarification whether it is\npossible to fill up a post reserved for Scheduled Tribes by\na Scheduled Caste candidate or vice versa by applying the\nprinciple of exchange of reservation between Scheduled\nCates and Scheduled Tribes as was possible when\nvacancy-based rosters were in vogue.\n\n2. Basic principle of post-based reservation is that, the\nnumber of posts filled by reservation by any category in a\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 11 of 27\n\ncadre should be equal to the quota prescribed for that\ncategory. If exchange of reservation between SCs and STs\nis permitted, number of employees of one reserved\ncategory of employees appointed by reservation will go\nbeyond reservation prescribed for that category. It would\nbe against the spirit of post-based reservation. Therefore,\nafter introduction of post-based reservation, it is not\npermissible to fill up a post reserved for Scheduled Tribes\nby a Scheduled Caste Candidate or vice versa by exchange\nof reservation between SCs and STs.\"\n\n18. Respondents no. 1 & 2 have filed their Counter affidavits to the\ninstant petition wherein it is stated that only 13 persons were working\nagainst SC / ST quota and two persons namely Sh. Suresh Kumar and\nSh. K.L. Morya were promoted as AE (C) on 05.09.2002 at their own\nseniority and not based upon the quota.\n\n19. It is further stated that in the last promotion carried out on\n05.09.2002, six candidates from the Reserved Category were\npromoted. However, 2 candidates out of 6 candidates were promoted\non the basis of their own seniority. It is denied that reservation quota\nof 22.5% for Reserved Category had been exceeded. It is specifically\ndenied that any more promotion from the Reserved Category would\nexceed the prescribed percentage of 22.5% or would be in violation of\nthe Post-Based Roster formulated under the direction of the Apex\nCourt.\n\n20. As stated above, only 13 persons from SC / ST Category against\n16 Reserved Posts were working as AE (C) and 2 Assistant Engineers\n(C) namely Sh. K.L. Morya and Sh. Suresh Kumar had been promoted\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 12 of 27\n\nat their own seniority. Therefore, if the above persons were promoted\nat their own seniority and not based upon the quota, they would not be\nconsidered in 22.5% reservation quota for the said Category.\nTherefore, the respondents have not violated the Post-based Roster and\nhave fully followed the same in promoting the aforementioned two\npersons.\n\n21. Respondent no. 5 has filed their counter-affidavit wherein it is\nstated that petitioner Association moved an application under Order\nVI Rule 17 read with Section 151CPC in W.P.(C) 3126/1992 for\ntaking additional grounds in the said W.P.(C) as the respondent\nDepartment had held DPC ignoring the claim of JE(C) belonging to SC\n/ ST Category for promotion to AE (C) against 14 reserved backlog\nvacancies and had promoted General Category JE (C) as AE (C). The\nadditional grounds (a) to (i) are contained in Para 11 of the said\napplication dated 17.01.1994 moved in the aforesaid petition and made\nadditional prayer as under:-\n\n\"In the premises set forth above it is most respectfully\nprayed that this Hon‟ble Court be pleased to:-\n\ni) Allow the application and set aside the promotion\norders dated 22.03.1993 and 30.04.1993.\n\nii) Take grounds (a) to (i) in this application on record\nand treat them the grounds in the Writ Petition, in addition\nto the grounds taken in the writ petition.\"\n\n22. Ld. Counsel further submitted that petitioners in TA 282/2009\nfiled the amended Petition impleading respondent no. 4 (Shri Ram\nDayal Ram) and respondent no. 5 (Shri D.K. Singh) in the array of\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 13 of 27\n\nparties dated 10.01.2006 filed Under Order VI Rule 17 r/w\nSection 151\n\nCPC.\n\n23. Respondent no. 5 filed reply on 18.10.2006 where it was brought\nto the notice of this Court that another W.P. (C) 3126/1992, which was\nadmitted by this Court and made Rule vide order dated 23.07.1993.\nSome of the Members of the Association had applied for copy under\nthe\nRTI Act\nwhich reveals that backlog of 4 Reserved Categories for\nmembers of SC / ST have been worked out. This fact has been made\nby the DPC starting from the beginning indicating the number of\nsanctioned post at the point reserved for SC / ST category in the\nvacancy Roster.\n\n24. After review made by the DPC in its meeting held on\n28.01.2010, there were still reserved posts which were required to be\nfilled up from amongst the SC / ST category JEs who were junior to\nSh. Ram Dayal Ram and Sh. D.K. Singh, R4 & R5.\n\n25. The arguments of the ld. Counsel for the petitioner is that\nrespondent no. 4 & 5 have been promoted wrongly and in excess of the\npercentage of reservation.\n\n26. It is submitted that the provision of switching over from the\nVacancy-Based Roster to Post-Based Roster is that no promotion can\nbe made against the reserved vacancy after issuance of DOP&T\nMemorandum dated 02.07.1997.\n\n27. Ld. Counsel has submitted that on perusal of the Office\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 14 of 27\n\nMemorandum as mentioned above, the Vacancy-Based Roster shall\ncontinue to operate from the backlog vacancy as the Department is\nbound to fill up the vacancy to the prescribed percentage of Reserved\nCategory as stipulated therein. The Government of India has further\nissued clarification in this respect on 20.05.1998 wherein at Serial no.\n13, Government had clarified the position that they have decided to\ncontinue reservation for SC / STs under the Central Government\nbeyond 15.11.1997 till such time as representation reaches the\nprescribed percentage of the Reservation.\n\n28. During the year 1993-1996 DPCs were held to fill up Reserved\nPosts for SC / ST from amongst the General Category candidates\nwithout getting the reserved posts de-reserved by following the\nprescribed procedure as\nlaid down by\nGovernment of India from time\nto time.\n\n29. Ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of respondents no.4 & 5 have\nsubmitted that Office Memorandum dated 31.01.2005 have been\nwithdrawn by the DOP&T vide Office Memorandum dated\n10.08.2010. Same is reproduced as under:\n\n\"The matter has been examined in the light of the above\nreferred judgments and it has been decided to withdraw\nO.M. NO. 36028/17/2001-Estt. (Res.) dated 31.01.2005\n\nreferred to above\n. It is clarified that SC/ST candidates\nappointed by promotion on their own merit and seniority\nand not owing to reservation or relaxation of\nqualifications will be adjusted against unreserved points of\nreservation roster, irrespective of the fact whether the\npromotion is made by selection method or non-selection\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 15 of 27\n\nmethod. These orders will take effect from 02.07.1997, the\ndate on which post based reservation was introduced.\"\n\n30. He further relied upon Office Memorandum dated 20.07.2000.\nSame is reproduced as under:\n\n\"G.I., Dept. of Per & Trg., O.M. NO. 36012/5/97-Estt.\n\n(Res.)Vol. II dated 20.07.2000\nSubject:- Backlog vacancies reserved for SCs & STs would\nbe treated as a distinct group and would not be subject to\n50% ceiling.\n\nThe undersigned is directed to invite a reference to\nDepartment of Personnel and Training‟s O.M.

(Res.) dated 29.08.1997 wherein it was\nlaid down that 50 per cent limit on reservation shall apply\nto current as well as backlog vacancies and that backlog of\nreserved vacancies shall not be treated as distinct group\nfor the purpose of 50 per cent limit on reservation and to\nsay that the matter has been reviewed. Consequently,\n\nArticle 16 (4-B)\nhas been incorporated in the Constitution\nby the\nConstitution (Eighty-First Amendment) Act, 2000\n,\nwhich provides as under:-\n\n\"Nothing in this article shall prevent the State\nfrom considering any unfilled vacancies of a year\nwhich are reserved for being filled up in that year\nin accordance with any provision for reservation\nmade under Clause (4) or Clause (4-A) as a\nseparate class of vacancies to be filled up in any\nsucceeding year or years and such class of\nvacancies, shall not be considered together with\nthe vacancies of the year in which they are being\nfilled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per\ncent reservation on total number of vacancies of\nthat year.\"\n\n2. In pursuance of the provisions of\nArticle 16 (4-B)\nof\nthe Constitution, it has been decided that in partial\nmodification of the instructions issued vide this\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 16 of 27\n\nDepartment‟s O.M.

In\nother words, the ceiling of 50 per cent on filing up of\nreserved vacancies would apply only on the reserved\nvacancies which arise in the current year and the backlog /\ncarried forward reserved vacancies for SCs/STs of earlier\nyears would be treated as a separate and distinct group\nand would not be subject to any ceiling. However, backlog\nand/or carried forward reservation will automatically\nlapse in a cadre as soon as combined representation of a\nreserved category in direct recruitment as well as\npromotion is either equal to or more than the prescribed\nnumber of reserved posts in the relevant post-based\nrosters.\"\n\n31. He has also Relied upon Office Memorandum dated 20.05.1998.\nSame is reproduced as under:-\n\n\"G.I., Dept. of Posts, New Delhi Lr. No. 137-10/97-\n\nSPB-II, dated 20.05.1998\n\nDoubts Clarifications\n13. It has been mentioned DOP&T, O.M. no. 36012/18-\nthat as per Judgment in the 95-Estt. (Res.) Pt. II dated 1-8-\nIndira Sawhney case the 1997 is being circulated in\nreservations in the matter which it has been decided to\nof promotion are to continue reservations for SCs /\n\ncontinue for a period of five STs as at present in services /\nyears with effect from 16- posts under the Central\n11.1992. Since the Government beyond\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 17 of 27\n\nstipulated period is already 15.11.1997 till such time as the\nover, it may be clarified representation reaches the\nwhether the reservations for prescribed percentages of\nSCs / STs in promotion are reservation whereafter the\nstill in operation or to reservation in promotion shall\ndiscontinue with effect from continue to maintain the\n17.11.1997. reservation to the extent of the\nprescribed percentages for the\nrespective categories.\n\n32. They further relied upon a case of\nR.K. Sabharwal & Ors. v.\nState of Punjab & Ors.\n1995 (1) SLR, wherein it is held as under:\n\n\"We may examine the likely result if the roster is permitted\nto operate in respect of the vacancies arising after the total\nposts in a cadre are filled. In a 100 point roster, 14 posts\nat various roster-points are filled from amongst the\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes candidates, 2 posts\nare filled from amongst the Backward Classes and the\nremaining 84 posts are filled from amongst the general\ncategory. Suppose all the posts in a cadre consisting of\n100 posts are filled in accordance with the roster by\n31.12.1994. Thereafter in the year 1995, 25 general\ncategory persons (out of the 84) retire. Again in the year\n1996, 25 more persons belonging to the general category\nretire. The position which would emerge would be that the\nScheduled Castes and Back ward Classes would claim\n16% share out of the 50 vacancies. If 8 vacancies are\ngiven to them then in the cadre of 100 posts the reserve\ncategories would be holding 24 posts there by increasing\nthe reservation from 16% to 24% . On the contrary if the\nroster is permitted to operate till the total posts in a cadre\nare to be filled by the same category of persons whose\nretirement etc. caused the vacancies then the balance\nbetween the reserve category and the general category\nshall always be maintained. We make it clear that in the\nevent of non-availability of a reserve candidate at the\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 18 of 27\n\nroster-point it would be open to the State Government to\ncarry forward the point in a just and fair manner.\"\n\n33. After hearing ld. Counsel for the parties, it is established that\nonly 13 persons were working against SC / ST quota and two persons\nnamely Sh. Suresh Kumar and Sh. K.L. Maurya were promoted as AE\n(C) on 05.09.2002 at their own seniority and not based upon the quota.\n\n34. The issue for consideration is whether the petitioners are entitled\nto get promotion on the basis of the implementation of the post based\nroster system. It is undisputed that the post -based roster came into\neffect on 02-07-1997 subsequent to the judgement in\nR.K. Sabharwal\nand others\n(supra). It is also not disputed that the vacancy based roster\nsystem had been existing in the respondent department, prior to the\nimplementation of the post based roster system. The main legal\ngrievance of the petitioner is that the respondent department is not\nfollowing the principle of reservation as it is envisaged in the post\nbased roster system, thus, promotions were denied. In consequence of\nthe non-compliance of reservation scheme in the post based roster\nsystem, leads to the promotion of respondent No 4 and 5.\n\n35. One of the objective that has been intended to achieve by\nimplementing the model roster of 'reservation in promotion' with\nreference to posts, is that at no point of time the reservation prescribed\nshall not exceed, and simultaneously it guarantees that the prescribed\nreservation in promotion for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes\nare achieved. Accordingly, 15% of posts are reserved for SC and\n7.5 % are reserved for ST respectively. Thus, at that point of time, the\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 19 of 27\n\nstrength in the cadre of Assistant Engineers (Civil) was 76. Therefore,\n16 posts of Assistant Engineer (Civil) were earmarked for the SC and\nST category as per the roster. It is pertinent to mention that the\nrespondents, who were promoted to the post of Assistant Engineer,\n(Civil) were eligible to be promoted as per the recruitment rules.\n\n36. The contention of the petitioners is that the irregularity exists, in\nthe form of crossing the ceiling limit that is prescribed in the post\nbased roster.\nIn this context, the implementation of the post based\nroster system need to be examined in the light of\nM. Nagaraj Vs.\nUnion Of India\n(2006) 8 SCC 212, wherein, the Apex Court also\nexamined and evaluated the theory of post based roster and its practical\napplication, and observed as under:-\n\n\"62. In R.K. Sabharwal, the issue was concerning\noperation of roster system. This court stated that the entire\ncadre strength should be taken into account to determine\nwhether reservation up to the required limit has been\nreached. It was held that if the roster is prepared on the\nbasis of the cadre strength, that by itself would ensure that\nthe reservation would remain within the ceiling-limit of\n50%. In substance, the court said that in the case of\nhundred-point roster each post gets marked for the\ncategory of candidate to be appointed against it and any\nsubsequent vacancy has to be filled by that category\ncandidate alone (replacement theory).\n\nThe question which remained in controversy, however, was\nconcerning the rule of 'carry-forward'. In Indra\nSawhney this Court held that the number of vacancies to\nbe filled up on the basis of reservation in a year including\nthe 'carry-forward' reservations should in no case exceed\nthe ceiling-limit of 50%.\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 20 of 27\n\nHowever, the Government found that total reservation in a\nyear for SCs, STs and OBCs combined together had\nalready reached 49 % and if the judgment of this Court in\nIndra Sawhney had to be applied it became difficult to fill\n\"backlog vacancies\". According to the Government, in\nsome cases the total of the current and backlog vacancies\nwas likely to exceed the ceiling- limit of 50%. Therefore,\nthe Government inserted Clause (4B) after Clause (4A) in\n\nArticle 16\nvide the\nConstitution (Eighty-First Amendment)\nAct, 2000\n.\n\n63. By Clause (4B) the \"carry-forward\"/\"unfilled\nvacancies\" of a year is kept out and excluded from the\noverall ceiling-limit of 50% reservation. The clubbing of\nthe backlog vacancies with the current vacancies stands\nsegregated by the\nConstitution (Eighty-First Amendment)\nAct, 2000\n. Quoted hereinbelow is the Statement of Objects\nand Reasons with the text of the\nConstitution (Eighty-First\nAmendment) Act, 2000\n:\n\nTHE CONSTITUTION (EIGHTY FIRST\nAMENDMENT) ACT, 2000\n\n(Assented on 9th June, 2000 and came into force 9.6.2000)\n\nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\nPrior to August 29, 1997, the vacancies reserved for the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, which could\nnot be filled up by direct recruitment on account of non-\navailability of the candidates belonging to the Scheduled\nCastes or the Scheduled Tribes, were treated as \"Backlog\nVacancies\". These vacancies were treated as a distinct\ngroup and were excluded from the ceiling of fifty per cent\nreservation. The Supreme Court of India in its judgment in\nthe\nIndra Sawhney v. Union of India\nheld that the number\nof vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a\nyear including carried forward reservations should in no\ncase exceed the limit of fifty per cent. As total reservations\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 21 of 27\n\nin a year for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes\nand the other Backward Classes combined together had\nalready reached forty-nine and a half per cent and the\ntotal number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could\nnot exceed fifty per cent., it became difficult to fill the\n\"Backlog Vacancies\" and to hold Special Recruitment\nDrives. Therefore, to implement the judgment of the\nSupreme Court, an Official Memorandum dated August 29,\n1997 was issued to provide that the fifty per cent limit shall\napply to current as well as \"Backlog Vacancies\" and for\ndiscontinuation of the Special Recruitment Drive.\n\nDue to the adverse effect of the aforesaid order dated\nAugust 29, 1997, various organisations including the\nMembers of Parliament represented to the central\nGovernment for protecting the interest of the Scheduled\ncastes and the Scheduled Tribes. The Government, after\nconsidering various representations, reviewed the position\nand has decided to make amendment in the constitution so\nthat the unfilled vacancies of a year, which are reserved\nfor being filled up in that year in accordance with any\nprovision for reservation made under Clause (4) or Clause\n(4A) of\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution, shall be considered\nas a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any\nsucceeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall\nnot be considered together with the vacancies of the year\nin which they are being filled up for determining the\nceiling of fifty percent, reservation on total number of\nvacancies of that year. This amendment in the Constitution\nwould enable the State to restore the position as was\nprevalent before august 29, 1997.\n\nThe Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object.\n\nTHE CONSTITUTION (EIGHTY-FIRST\nAMENDMENT) ACT, 2000\n\n(Assented on 9th June, 2000 and came into force 9.6.2000)\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 22 of 27\n\nAn Act\nfurther to amend the Constitution of India. BE it\nenacted by Parliament in the Fifty- first Year of the\nRepublic of India as follows:\n\n1. Short title:\nThis Act\nmay be called the\nConstitution\n(Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000\n.\n\n2. Amendment of\nArticle 16:\nIn\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution, after Clause (4A), the following Clause shall\nbe inserted, namely: -\n\n(4B) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from\nconsidering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are\nreserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with\nany provision for reservation made under Clause (4) or\nClause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up\nin any succeeding year or years and such class of\nvacancies shall not be considered together with the\nvacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for\ndetermining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total\nnumber of vacancies of that year.\n\nThe Constitution (Eighty-First Amendment) Act, 2000\n\ngives, in substance, legislative assent to the judgment of\nthis Court in R.K. Sabharwal. Once it is held that each\npoint in the roster indicates a post which on falling vacant\nhas to be filled by the particular category of candidate to\nbe appointed against it and any subsequent vacancy has to\nbe filled by that category candidate alone then the question\nof clubbing the unfilled vacancies with current vacancies\ndo not arise. Therefore, in effect,\nArticle 16(4B)\ngrants\nlegislative assent to the judgment in R.K. Sabharwal. If it\nis within the power of the State to make reservation then\nwhether it is made in one selection or deferred selections,\nis only a convenient method of implementation as long as it\nis post based, subject to replacement theory and within the\nlimitations indicated hereinafter.\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 23 of 27\n\nAs stated above, Clause (4A) of\nArticle 16\nis carved out of\nClause (4) of\nArticle 16.\nClause (4A) provides benefit of\nreservation in promotion only to SCs and STs. In the case\nof S. Vinod Kumar and Anr. v. MANU/SC/1284/1996 :\n\nUnion of India and Ors. (1996)6SCC580 this Court held\nthat relaxation of qualifying marks and standards of\nevaluation in matters of reservation in promotion was not\npermissible under\nArticle 16(4)\nin view of\nArticle 335\nof\nthe Constitution. This was also the view in Indra Sawhney.\n\n64.\nBy the Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act,\n, a proviso was inserted at the end of\nArticle 335\nof\nthe Constitution which reads as under:\n\nProvided that nothing in this article shall prevent in\nmaking of any provision in favour of the members of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation\nin qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the\nstandards of evaluation, for reservation in matters of\npromotion to any class or classes of services or posts in\nconnection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.\n\nThis proviso was added following the benefit of reservation\nin promotion conferred upon SCs and STs alone. This\nproviso was inserted keeping in mind the judgment of this\nCourt in Vinod Kumar which took the view that relaxation\nin matters of reservation in promotion was not permissible\nunder\nArticle 16(4)\nin view of the command contained in\n\nArticle 335.\nOnce a separate category is carved out of\nClause (4) of\nArticle 16\nthen that category is being given\nrelaxation in matters of reservation in promotion. The\nproviso is confined to SCs and STs alone. The said proviso\nis compatible with the scheme of\nArticle 16(4A).\"\n\n37. As stated above,\nArticle 16(4B)\nlifts the 50% cap on carry-over\nvacancies (backlog vacancies). The ceiling- limit of 50% on current\nvacancies continues to remain.\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 24 of 27\n\n38. The office memorandum issued on 29-8-1997, in pursuance of\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nIndira Sawahney vs Union\nof India\n, (2000)1SCC168 reiterated the scheme of reservation based on\n50% ceiling limit. In other words, the number of vacancies to be filled\non the basis of reservation in a year, including the carried forward,\nhowever, the reservation should not exceed 50 % limit. In consequence\nof the same, the\nArticle 16(4B)\nincorporated in the constitution and\nsubsequently, the office memorandum dated 20-7-2000 has been\nissued wherein, it prescribes the limit of reservation shall be based on\nthe post based roster system. It is also significant to note that the\noffice memorandum dated 29-8-1997 has been modified by the office\nmemorandum dated 20-7-2000. The said office memorandum also\nclarifies the aspect of treating the backlog/ carried forward as a\nseparate and distinct group. In other words, the ceiling of 50 % would\napply on the reserve vacancies which arise in the current year and the\nbacklog/ carried forward vacancies for SC/ST of earlier years would be\ntreated as a separate and distinct group, and would not be subject to\nany ceiling. Therefore, the general rule of reservation at present is post\nbased roster system; but as per the special provision, which regulate\nthe scheme of reservation, is based on the 50 % ceiling limit. The case\nof the petitioner is not that the ceiling of 50 % has been breached in the\nprocess of reservation in promotion; in turn, the reservation limit of\n22.5% got violated by promoting the respondent no. 4-5. The court\nalso took in to account the rights flowing from the\nArticle 16 (1)\nand\nthe enabling powers vest in\narticle 16 (4) (4A)\n, (4B). The promotions\nto the respondent No 4 & 5 as Assistant Engineers (Civil) were not\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 25 of 27\n\neclipsed the right accrued in favour of the Petitioner under\narticle\n16(1)\n, since, there is no breaching in the maximum ceiling limit.\n\n39. Importantly, the list of the persons, working as Assistant\nEngineer (Civil) from the reserved category, has been placed on record\nin the writ petition. Out of which fourteen people are belonging to the\nSC quota and two persons belonging to ST quota. The significant point\nto be noted is that two persons, namely, K.L. Maurya and Suresh\nKumar were promoted on the basis of merit. Therefore, they were not\nplaced in the category of reserved quota; but in the general category.\nThe promotion of two SC candidates based on the merit would fall\nunder the general category. The Apex Court has already examined this\nissue and held in\nR.K.Sabharwal vs State of Punjab and others\n,\n(1995)2 SCC 745 as under:-\n\n\"4. When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of\na particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve\npoints, it has to be taken that the posts shown at the\nreserve points are to be filled from amongst the members\nof reserve categories and the candidates belonging to the\ngeneral category are not entitled to be considered for the\nreserve posts. On the other hand the reserve category\ncandidates can compete for the non-reserve posts and in\nthe event of their appointment to the said posts their\nnumber cannot be added and taken into consideration for\nworking out the percentage of reservation.\"\n\n40. Accordingly, the Office Memorandum dated 31.01.2005 has\nbeen withdrawn by Memorandum dated 10.08.2010 wherein it is\nclarified that SC / ST candidates appointed by promotion on their own\nmerit and seniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 26 of 27\n\nqualifications will be adjusted against unreserved points. It is further\nclarified that these orders will take effect from 02.07.1997, the date on\nwhich post-based reservation was introduced.\n\n41. Therefore, the tag of caste loses its identity when the promotions\nare effected on merit. Accordingly, the promotion that has been carried\nout by the respondent department does not cross the prescribed limit.\n\n42. In view of the above reasons the petition is dismissed with no\norder as to costs.\n\n43. Before parting with this judgment, it is also important to note\nthat the promotion in question in the instant petition is related to 19-4-\n2005. Prior to the said promotion, the respondent department had also\ncarried out the promotions on 05.09.2002 and 06.08.1996. The\nPetitioners have placed the reliance on the facts and figures of the said\npromotion. The respondent brought to the notice of the Court that the\nWrit Petition no. 3126/1992 titled as DDA (\nSLUM SC/ST Engineers\nAssociation (Regd.) and Others Vs. D.D.A and others\nis related to the\npromotion to the post of Assistant Engineers (Civil) which is due from\n1988. Therefore, the dismissal of this writ petition shall not stand in the\nway of the implementation of the orders passed in the Writ Petition\nNo.3126/1992 as mentioned above.\n\nSURESH KAIT, J\n\nDECEMBER 21, 2012\nJg/RS\n\nW.P (C) No.16955-60/2004 Page 27 of 27",
