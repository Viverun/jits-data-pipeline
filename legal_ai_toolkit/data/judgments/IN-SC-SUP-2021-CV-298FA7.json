Bopanna\nReportable\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCivil Appeal Nos 7640-7641 of 2021\n(Arising out of SLP(C) Nos 1413-1414 of 2019)\n\nUnion of India & Ors .... Appellant(s)\n\nVersus\n\nAmrita Sinha ....Respondent(s)\n\nORDER\n\n1 Delay condoned.\n\n2 Leave granted.\n\n3 The Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras, by its judgment\n\ndated 26 April 2018, has affirmed the judgment and order of the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal1, directing the appellants to reconsider the claim of the\n\nrespondent for appointment on compassionate grounds for a post corresponding\n\nto her qualifications against vacancies for 2014-15.\n\n4 The spouse of the respondent was holding the rank of Sargent in the Indian Air\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nForce. During the course of his employment, he died due to cancer on 6 January\n\nDigitally signed by\n\n2008, leaving behind the respondent and two minor children. An application was\nSanjay Kumar\nDate: 2021.12.13\n17:44:06 IST\nReason:\n\nfiled by the respondent seeking compassionate appointment, but, it was rejected\n\n1 “Tribunal”\non 17 February 2011. A subsequent application which was filed on 11 February\n\n2014 was also rejected on 16 June 2015 on the ground that the respondent had\n\nsecured merit points which did not enable her to obtain compassionate\n\nappointment.\n\n5 The Union of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions\n\n(Department of Personnel and Training) issued an OM 2 on 9 October 1998 titled\n\n“Scheme of Compassionate Appointment under the Central Government”. On\n\n22 January 2010, the Government of India in the Ministry of Defence 3 issued an\n\nOM4 titled “Scheme of Compassionate Appointment Relative Merit, Point and\n\nRevised Procedure for Selection”. This was followed by another OM 5 of the MoD\n\ndated 14 May 2010.\n\n6 Following the death of her husband, the respondent was in the receipt of a\n\nfamily pension in the amount of Rs 8,265 per month. The total terminal benefits\n\nwhich were paid to the respondent were in the amount of Rs 22,91,568. The\n\ncase of the respondent for compassionate appointment was evaluated and merit\n\npoints were assigned under various heads in terms of the procedure which was\n\nprescribed by the MoD. The respondent, however, submitted that the family\n\npension at the above rate was payable from 7 January 2008 to 6 January 2018,\n\nafter which the amount of pension would stand reduced to Rs 4,959 per month.\n\nOn this basis, the respondent submitted before the Tribunal that she should have\n\nbeen awarded 16 merit points instead of 10 against the head of family pension.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that the denial of compassionate appointment on the\n\nground that the respondent was drawing a monthly pension of Rs 8,265 on the\n\ndate of consideration of the case was not justifiable as pension is paid for the\n\n2 OM No. 14014/6/94-Estt(D)\n\n3 “MoD”\n\n4 F.No.19(3/2009/D)(Lab)\n\n5 F.No.19(3/2009/D)(Lab)\nservice rendered by a deceased employee. Moreover, the Tribunal noted that\n\nthe quantum of pension would stand reduced with effect from 7 January 2018 to\n\nRs 4,959 per month and since the deceased employee had died due to a\n\nterminal illness, the family “might be in debt” and “might have sold the property\n\nfor his treatment”, while, at the same time, observing that it was not going into\n\nthose aspects. On this basis, the letter of rejection was quashed and the\n\nappellants were directed to reconsider the case. The High Court, while affirming\n\nthe judgment of the Tribunal, has held that the authorities have erred in taking\n\ninto account the family pension in the monthly income, since this was an ad hoc\n\nincome earned by the respondent, instead of considering the regular pension\n\nwhich would be earned with effect from 7 January 2018.\n\n7 We have heard Ms Madhavi Divan, Additional Solicitor General appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellants and Mr Rabin Majumder, Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe respondent.\n\n8 Ms Madhavi Divan submitted that the case of the respondent was considered\n\nstrictly within the parameters of the OM and merit points were assigned. It has\n\nbeen urged that the authorities were justified in taking into account the family\n\npension which was being earned as on the date of the consideration of the\n\napplication and the fact that the pensionary payments would be reduced after a\n\nlapse of ten years would not be a ground to reassign the merit points in\n\naccordance with the Scheme. That apart, it was urged that the claim of the\n\nrespondent had already been rejected on 17 February 2011 and even after a\n\nfresh claim was made for compassionate appointment, it was evaluated in terms\n\nof the Policy and the respondent was found not to be entitled to appointment on\n\na compassionate basis.\n9 On the other hand, it has been submitted on behalf of the respondent that the\n\ncase of the respondent was that the merit points which were assigned to her\n\nwere incorrectly computed having due regard to the fact that the family pension\n\nof Rs 8,265 per month which became payable from 7 January 2008 would be\n\nreassessed at Rs 4,959 per month with effect from 7 January 2018. Mr Rabin\n\nMajumder placed reliance on the judgment of the Tribunal and has urged that\n\nhaving due regard to the financial condition of the respondent, the Court may\n\nnot interfere with the judgment of the Tribunal on humanitarian grounds.\n\n10 While assessing the rival submissions, it becomes necessary, at the outset, to\n\nconsider the reasons which weighed with the Tribunal since it is the view of the\n\nTribunal which has been held not to suffer from error by the High Court. Under\n\nthe policy document, which embodies the Scheme for considering cases for\n\ncompassionate appointment, points are awarded under diverse heads. The\n\nmonthly pension which was payable to the respondent was required to be taken\n\ninto account in the award of merit points. The Tribunal, however, came to the\n\nconclusion that pension is paid for past service rendered by the employee and,\n\nhence, denial of compassionate appointment on that basis was not justifiable.\n\nThis reasoning of the Tribunal is fallacious. Undoubtedly, pension is not an act of\n\nbounty, but is towards the service which has been rendered by an employee.\n\nHowever, in evaluating a claim for compassionate appointment, it is open to the\n\nauthorities to evaluate the financial position of the family upon the death while\n\nin service. Compassionate appointment is not a vested right. It is provided in\n\norder to enable a family to tide over a financial crisis caused by the death of its\n\nwage-earner while in service. If the scheme requires that the family pension\n\nmust be taken into account in evaluating the merits an application, it has to be\n\nfollowed.\n11 In the present case, the family pension which was payable as on the date of the\n\nconsideration of the application has been taken into account. The fact that the\n\npension would be up for revision in terms of the policy after a decade was not a\n\nreason to discard the pensionary payment which was being made towards family\n\npension on the date of the consideration of the application for compassionate\n\nappointment.\n\n12 Compassionate appointment is not a matter of right, but is to enable the family\n\nto tide over an immediate crisis which may result from the death of the\n\nemployee. If the policy of the government envisages that the family pension\n\nwould be paid for a ten years after which it would have to be modified, it cannot\n\nbe said that by taking into account the present pensionary payment, the\n\nauthorities have considered an extraneous circumstance. The same criterion is\n\napplied even handedly to all applicants seeking compassionate appointment.\n\n13 The High Court has affirmed the view of the Tribunal by coming to the conclusion\n\nthat the payment which was being made to the respondent was ad hoc in nature\n\nand was wrongly considered by the authorities while awarding merit points. This\n\nline of reasoning of the High Court is equally erroneous as that of the Tribunal.\n\nThe payment of the family pension was not an ad hoc amount, but, was\n\nevidently in accordance with the applicable service rules. The application of the\n\nrespondent was initially rejected in 2011 and was, thereafter, again reconsidered\n\nin 2014. Absent a case of palpable arbitrariness, we are of the view that there\n\nwas no reason for the High Court or the Tribunal to interfere with the evaluation\n\nwhich was conducted by the authorities in terms of the applicable guidelines.\n\nMoreover, we are clearly of the view that the grant of compassionate\n\nappointment would not be in accordance with the basic purpose and object of\n\nsuch a scheme.\n14 For the above reasons, we allow the appeals and set aside the impugned\n\njudgment and order of the High Court dated 26 April 2018. The OA 6 filed by the\n\nrespondent shall, in the circumstances, stand dismissed.\n\n15 Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.\n\n…………...…...….......………………........J.\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\n…..…..…....…........……………….…........J.\n[A S Bopanna]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nDecember 11, 2021\n\n-S-\n\n6OA No 310/01721/2015\nITEM NO.13 Court 4 (Video Conferencing) SECTION XII\n\nS U P R E M E C O U R T O F I N D I A\nRECORD OF PROCEEDINGS\n\nPetition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s).1413-1414/2019\n\n(Arising out of impugned final judgment and order dated 26-04-2018\nin WP No. 15982/2017 and WMP No. 17280/2017 passed by the High\nCourt of Judicature at Madras)\n\nUNION OF INDIA & ORS.
