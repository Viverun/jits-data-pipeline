Banumathi\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 4853 OF 2016\n(Arising out of SLP (C) No.27545 of 2011)\n\nSANTOSH DEVI ...Appellant\n\nVersus\n\nUNION OF INDIA & ORS. ...Respondents\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nR. BANUMATHI, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2. This appeal is preferred against the judgment dated\n\n13.05.2011 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal, Chandigarh in T.A.\n\nNo.242 of 2009 dismissing the application filed by the appellant\n\nseeking family pension for the death of her husband Ex. Sepoy Raj\n\nSingh.\n\n3. Undisputed facts of the case are as follows:- Raj Singh was\n\nenrolled in the 103 Infantry Battalion (Territorial Army) on\n\n17.05.1995. He was disembodied from service with effect from\n\n31.03.2008 under Rule 20 of the Territorial Army Rules, 1948 and\n\nduring disembodiment Raj Singh died at his home on 04.08.2008 due\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nMahabir Singh\n\nDate: 2016.05.07\n\n10:12:13 IST\n\nto heart attack. Raj Singh rendered a total service of eleven years and\n\nReason:\n\ntwo hundred eighty nine days. The family pension was denied to the\n\nappellant vide letter dated 12.12.2008 stating that as per the existing\nrules, territorial army personnel who died during disembodied state\n\nwithout completing fifteen years of embodied service are not entitled\n\nfor service pension. The appellant, being the wife of the deceased,\n\nserved a legal notice upon the respondents on 05.01.2009 for release\n\nof death-cum-retirement gratuity, service gratuity and family pension.\n\nThe department issued a demand draft dated 21.10.2009 for\n\nRs.1,82,448/- in favour of the appellant on account of service gratuity\n\nand death-cum-retirement gratuity. Aggrieved thereof, appellant\n\npreferred Writ Petition No.16566 of 2009 seeking direction against the\n\nrespondents to release the family pension. Upon constitution of Armed\n\nForces Tribunal, Chandigarh, the writ petition was transferred to the\n\nArmed Forces Tribunal, Chandigarh and renumbered as T.A. No.242\n\nof 2009 before the Tribunal.\n\n4. The Tribunal vide impugned order dated 13.05.2011\n\ndismissed the application inter alia holding that, Raj Singh did not\n\nhave the requisite minimum qualifying embodied service of fifteen\n\nyears to earn service pension, and hence upon his death while he was\n\nin disembodied state, the appellant was not entitled to family pension.\n\nThe tribunal held that persons in territorial army cannot at all times\n\nbe treated on par with the army personnel, the territorial army\n\npersonnel while in disembodied state does not stand on the same\n\nfooting as compared to regular army personnel and thus held that the\n\nappellant was not entitled to family pension. Contention of the\n\nappellant that denial of family pension to ‘next of kin’ of territorial\narmy personnel who died in harness while in disembodied state is\n\ndiscriminatory and violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India,\n\nwas held untenable.\n\n5. Relying upon Regulation 289 of the Pension Regulation for\n\nArmy (Part-I) 1961 Edition, Mr. Naresh Kumar learned counsel for the\n\nappellant has contended that the Pension Regulation for Army 1961\n\napply to the regular army personnel as well as to the personnel of\n\nterritorial army in certain contingencies. Learned counsel for the\n\nappellant therefore, submitted that, denial of family pension to the\n\nappellant when her husband admittedly died in harness is not\n\njustified when such a benefit is extended to the widow of a regular\n\narmy personnel who died in harness. The Government circular dated\n\n11.06.1985, especially paragraph 3(ii) thereof, read with subsequent\n\ncirculars dated 30.10.1987, 03.02.1998 and 12.11.2008 was also\n\npressed into service by the counsel for the appellant to substantiate\n\nhis argument. It was contended that there is no statutory rule\n\ndenying family pension to Territorial Army personnel dying at home\n\nand since the territorial army reservists during disembodied state are\n\nliable to be called at any time, failure of which is treated as absence\n\nwithout leave, denial of family pension in the event of Territorial Army\n\npersonnel dying natural death during disembodied state would be\n\narbitrary and discriminatory. Reliance was also placed upon\n\njudgments of various High Courts and tribunals.\n\n6. Mr. Balasubramanian, learned counsel appearing for\nUnion of India at the outset fairly submitted that the Pension\n\nRegulations for the army govern the entitlement to various types of\n\npensions including, family pension to family of deceased regular army\n\npersonnel, as well as to family of deceased personnel of the territorial\n\narmy, read with various circulars that are issued by the Government\n\nof India from time to time. But it was strenuously canvassed before\n\nus by the learned counsel for the Union of India that, in the case of\n\nfamily pension to the family of deceased personnel of the Territorial\n\nArmy, the entitlement has to flow either from the fact that the\n\ndeceased soldier had put in minimum qualifying embodied service of\n\nfifteen years, and thus had become entitled to service pension, in\n\nwhich case the family pension gets granted to the widow or other\n\neligible person(s) as per rules, or alternatively, the deceased ought to\n\nhave died in harness when he was in an embodied state i.e., while he\n\nwas on active duty having been called out or attached to any part of\n\nthe regular army. Conversely, it was argued that if the death had\n\noccurred when the deceased was in a disembodied state, and if the\n\ndeceased individual had not put in minimum period of qualifying\n\nservice of fifteen years, then the entitlement to family pension arising\n\nout of death in harness would not arise. In this regard the counsel for\n\nthe Union of India drew our attention to Pension Regulations for the\n\nArmy, Part-I (2008) which has superseded the Pension Regulations for\n\nthe Army 1961 with effect from 01.07.2008. Our attention was\n\nespecially drawn to Section 2 titled ‘Ordinary Family Pension’\nRegulation 62, which inter alia lays down that, the regulations shall\n\nnot apply to the members of the Territorial Army other than those who\n\ndie while rendering ‘embodied service’ or after retirement with pension\n\nunder the said Regulations.\n\n7. We have considered the rival submissions and also perused\n\nthe impugned order & materials placed on record.\n\n8. The distinctive features of Territorial Army and regular\n\narmy are significant in the present case. As per Army Order\n\n77/1984, the Territorial Army is a part of the regular Indian Army.\n\nThe role of Territorial Army is to relieve the regular army from static\n\nduties, assist civil administration in dealing with natural calamities\n\nand maintenance of essential services in situations where life of the\n\ncommunities is affected or the security of the country is threatened,\n\nand to provide units for the regular army as and when required. As\n\nexplicit in the Statement of objects and reasons of the\nTerritorial Army\n\nAct, 1948\n, the role of the Territorial Army is:-\n\n(a) to provide a second line to and a source of reinforcement for\nthe regular army;\n\n(b) to assist in internal defence duties in a national emergency;\n\n(c) to be responsible for anti aircraft and coastal defence; and\n\n(d) to give the youth of India an opportunity of training\nthemselves to defend their country.\n\n9.\nSection 4\nof the Act provides that the personnel of the\n\nTerritorial Army comprise of two classes–(a) officers and (b) enrolled\n\npersons. As per\nSection 6\n, any person who is a citizen of India may\noffer himself for enrolment and may if he satisfies the prescribed\n\nconditions, be enrolled for such period and subject to such conditions\n\nas may be prescribed. According to\nSection 6A\n, every person\n\nemployed under the government in a public utility service who is\n\nbetween the age group of 20-40 years, subject to other provisions and\n\nrules, is liable, when so required, to perform service under the\n\nterritorial army.\nSection 7\nprovides for liability for military service.\n\nSection 7A\ncasts a duty on every employer by whom a person who is\n\nrequired to perform military service under\nSection 7\nwas employed, to\n\nre-instate him in his employment on termination of military service in\n\nan occupation and under conditions not less favourable than those\n\nwhich would have been applicable to him at his employment. As per\n\nSection 9\n, every officer while rendering service as such officer and\n\nevery enrolled person when called out, or embodied, or attached to the\n\nregular army shall, subject to suitable adaptation, be subject to the\n\nprovisions of the\nArmy Act\nand the Rules or Regulations made\n\nthereunder. In terms of\nSection 14(2)(b)\nof Territorial Army Act,\n\nCentral Government is empowered to make rules prescribing the\n\nmanner in which, the period for which, and the conditions subject to\n\nwhich any person may be enrolled under the Act or may be required to\n\nperform compulsory service in the Territorial Army.\n\n10. The terms and conditions of service of personnel belonging\n\nto the regular Indian Army and the personnel belonging to Territorial\n\nArmy are governed by two different Acts. The former is governed by\nArmy Act\n1950 while the latter is governed by the\nTerritorial Army Act\n\n1948. It is implicit in\nSection 9\nof the Territorial Army Act that when\n\nthe person enrolled in the Territorial Army is not called out during\n\nthat period of disembodied state, he is not subjected to the provisions\n\nof the\nArmy Act\n. It is thus clear from the statutory scheme that a fine\n\ndistinction is made between regular army personnel and personnel\n\nenrolled in territorial army. Further distinction has to be made\n\nbetween the Territorial Army personnel who are embodied and those\n\nwho are in disembodied state. It is only when the Territorial Army\n\npersonnel get embodied, which means that when they are called out\n\nor attached to any portion of the regular army for active duty, that the\n\nprovisions of\nArmy Act\n1950 are applied to the Territorial Army\n\npersonnel. When the Territorial Army personnel are in a disembodied\n\nstate i.e., when they are not called out or attached to any portion of\n\nthe regular army for active duty, then the\nTerritorial Army Act\ngoverns the service conditions and this is the statutory scheme.\n\n11. The only question falling for consideration is whether in the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the appellant is entitled to family\n\npension and whether denial of family pension to the appellant is\n\njustified. It is the admitted position that late Sepoy Raj Singh was\n\nenrolled in the territorial army on 17.05.1995 and he died on\n\n04.08.2008 due to heart attack in his village. It is also admitted by\n\nboth parties that Raj Singh had been disembodied on 31.03.2008 and\n\nthat Raj Singh died while he was in disembodied state from the\nTerritorial Army.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the appellant laid emphasis upon\n\nRegulation 289 of the Pension Regulations for Army (Part I) 1961 Edn.\n\nto contend that members of the Territorial Army shall be governed by\n\nthe same regulations as applicable to the army personnel. Pension\n\nRegulation 289 reads as under:-\n\n“289. The grant of pensionary award to the members of\nthe Territorial Army shall be governed by the same\ngeneral regulations as applicable to the corresponding\npersonnel of the Army except where they are inconsistent\nwith the provisions of Regulations in this Chapter.”\n\n13. A plain reading of the aforesaid provision makes it clear\n\nthat the grant of pension award to personnel of the Territorial Army is\n\ngoverned by same general pension regulation as applicable to regular\n\narmy personnel except wherever it is dealt with differently in the said\n\nregulations. Therefore, unless an exception has been carved out in\n\nthe case of personnel of the Territorial Army, the Pension Regulations\n\nfor the Army 1961 would govern the field in the matter of grant of\n\nvarious pensionary awards. This is made further clear from\n\nparagraph 3 (ii) of Government of India, Ministry of Defence Circular\n\nNo.68699/221/GSITA-3(a)/1131/B/D(GS-VI) dated 11 th June 1985\n\nwhich reads as under:-\n\n“3.(ii).Death-cum-retirement-Gratuity and ordinary Family\nPension will be admissible, as applicable to the Regular\nArmy.”\n\nThis has also been further reiterated in the circulars dated 03.02.1998\n\nand 12.11.2008 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of\nDefence which are made applicable to the Territorial Army amongst\n\nothers.\n\n14. Plea urged by the appellant was that while the wife of a\n\nregular army soldier, who dies in harness is entitled to family pension\n\neven if the deceased soldier had not put in the minimum qualifying\n\nservice to earn service pension, the same is denied to wife of a\n\ndeceased Territorial Army soldier on a specious plea that the deceased\n\nsoldier was in disembodied state when the death took place. This\n\naccording to the appellant is discriminatory. By elaborate reasoning,\n\nthe tribunal held that a regular army person and a person enrolled in\n\nthe Territorial Army are governed by different set of terms and\n\nconditions of service. They are not similarly situated and therefore\n\nthey do not form part of the same class in the matter of grant of\n\nservice benefits and hence, there cannot be a violation of\nArticle 14\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. We concur with the view taken by the\n\ntribunal. It is therefore not necessary for us to refer to number of\n\njudgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant as\n\nthose cases were determined in the light of facts and circumstances of\n\nthose cases.\n\n15. No doubt, with effect from 01.07.2008, new Pension\n\nRegulations for the Army 2008 have come into operation superseding\n\nthe earlier one. In Section 2-Ordinary Family Pension of the new\n\nRegulation of 2008, Regulation 62 lays down that the regulations shall\n\nnot apply to members of the Territorial Army other than those who\ndied while rendering embodied service or after retirement with pension\n\nunder these regulations. Learned counsel for the Union of India laid\n\nemphasis upon the Pension Regulations for the Army 2008 to contend\n\nthat, as Raj Singh died while in disembodied state, appellant-wife was\n\nnot entitled to family pension. In the preface of the said regulations\n\nissued by the Government of India, Ministry of Defence dated\n\n01.07.2008, it is specifically mentioned that it is applicable to army\n\npersonnel who are in service as on 01.07.2008. In the present case, it\n\nis an admitted position that the deceased-Raj Singh was disembodied\n\non 31.03.2008 much before the new regulations came into effect.\n\nTherefore, he was not in service on 01.07.2008 and hence new\n\nregulations cannot be pressed into service. The new regulations are\n\napplicable only to those who were in service as on 01.07.2008 or\n\nthereafter. Therefore, the claim of the appellant cannot be tested on\n\nthe new Pension Regulations for the Army 2008.\n\n16. Having said that, we are of the view that the entitlement of\n\nthe appellant to family pension has to be examined in the light of the\n\nprovisions of the Pension Regulations for the Army 1961 read with\n\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Defence circulars dated 11.06.1985,\n\n03.02.1998 and lastly circular dated 12.11.2008. As discussed\n\nearlier, in terms of\nSection 9\n, every officer/ enrolled person when\n\ncalled out or embodied or attached to the regular army shall, subject\n\nto suitable adaptation, be subject to the provisions of the\nArmy Act\n\n1950 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. When an\nenrolled person is in disembodied state, he is not subject to the\nArmy\n\nAct\nand is not entitled to pay and allowances or other entitlement as\n\nalso medical allied benefits. Also their disembodiment period is not\n\ncounted as a qualifying service even for service pension. As per the\n\nexisting rules, no family pension is payable to the legal heir of a\n\nterritorial army personnel who died during disembodied state and who\n\nhas not put in pensionable service.\n\n17. As per the rules, no family pension is payable to the legal\n\nheir of a territorial army personnel who died during disembodied state\n\nand who has not put in pensionable service. Contention of\n\nrespondents that admissibility of such a relief would be contrary to\n\nthe rules in force has led to a patent anomaly. Such anomaly was\n\npointed out by Major, Addl. Offr./TA-3, TA DTE, GS Branch in his\n\ninputs for VI Pay Commission dated 09.03.2007 (Annexure P-8)\n\nthereby recommending to do the needful to render fair treatment to\n\nTerritorial Army personnel. We deem it appropriate to reproduce it as\n\nunder:-\n\n“GRANT OF FAMILY PENSION TO NoK OF TA PERS\nWHO THOUGH IN SERVICE BUT DIES DURING\nDISEMBODIED STATE.\n\n4. Anomaly is:-\n\n(i) Person ‘A’ is in embodied state for the last 10 years, he\ngets disembodied today and dies tomorrow, in such case\nNoK is not being granted ordinary family pensions.\n\n(ii) Person ‘B’ is in disembodied state for the last 10\nyears, he gets embodied today and dies tomorrow. In this\ncase NoK is being granted ordinary family pension.\n\nNote: Point to be noted is both indls are in service and\nhave not been discharged from service.\n\n18. In response to the above communication relied upon by the\nappellant, Mr. Balasubramanian, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondents has drawn our attention to the comments on ‘General\n\nStaff Branch’ dated 09.03.2007 (Annexure R-1 series). After referring\n\nto the aforesaid recommendation of Additional Officer/TA-3, TA Dte,\n\nGS Branch it was observed as under:-\n\n“(ae) In view of the above case, though has been referred to\nme CGOA to issue instructions to PCDA (Allahabad) to\nentertain ordinary family pension to NoK of pers dying\nduring disembodied state. The same is still under\nconsideration with CGDA.\n\n(af) It is recommended that the issue be addressed in\nrecommendations of 6th\nCPC\nto remove the anomaly for\nwhich no orders to the effect exist.”\n\nEven though the above anomalies have been taken note of by the\n\nconcerned authorities, the respondents have not so far taken any\n\ndecision to rectify the anomalies to give fair treatment to the\n\nTerritorial Army personnel by granting family pension to ‘next of kin’\n\nof Territorial Army personnel who die while in disembodied state.\n\nTerritorial Army personnel actually remain on rolls till they are retired\n\nfrom service and as noticed earlier, they are liable to be called out for\n\nmilitary service at any time. During disembodiment, Territorial Army\n\npersonnel wait in reserve. It was contended by the learned counsel for\n\nthe appellant that when gratuity and other benefits are paid to the\n\nterritorial army personnel dying during disembodied service as a\n\ndeath in harness, they should also be eligible for service pension.\n\nLearned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to Ministry\n\nof Defence Report (Declassified on 18.02.2016) of the Committee of\nExperts constituted for Reduction of Litigation, Review of Service &\n\nPension Matters 2015:-\n\n“Report Page 223, 8th line: …We also find that widows/families of\nTA personnel dying in harness but during the period of\n‘disembodiment, (demobilized state) are not granted Ordinary\nFamily Pension. We feel that this issue may be considered\nfavourably since such pers remain on the strength of the TA and\nalso on the rolls of their unit while on disembodied state. If the\nfamilies of regular military pers who die due to non-service related\ncauses or while on leave or while on furlough are entitled to\nOrdinary Family Pension, then by same logic even families of TA\npers should not be refused the same.”\n\nInspite of repeated recommendations, it is not known why steps are\n\nnot being taken to remove the anomalies to pay family pension to\n\n‘next of kin’ of Territorial Army personnel who rendered long service in\n\nTerritorial Army and died while in disembodied state. We hope that\n\nthe Union of India considers the issue favourably to remove the\n\nanomalies to pay appropriate family pension to next of kin of\n\nTerritorial Army personnel who die while in disembodied state by\n\ngiving due weightage to their embodied service.\n\n19. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that Raj Singh\n\nhad unblemish service record and had rendered a total service of\n\nabout twelve years in Territorial Army (11 years and 289 days)\n\nincluding service in operational area. For quite sometime, the\n\nappellant has been pursuing the litigation seeking family pension.\n\nConsidering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and the\n\nplight of the appellant, in the interest of justice and in exercise of our\n\npower under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution of India, we deem it\n\nappropriate to award ex-gratia grant of rupees ten lakhs payable to\nthe appellant.\n\n20. The impugned order of the tribunal is accordingly modified\n\nwith the direction that the respondents shall pay an ex-gratia amount\n\nof rupees ten lakhs to the appellant within a period of three months\n\nfrom today.\n\n21. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.\n\n…………………….CJI.\n\n(T.S. THAKUR)\n\n……………………….J.\n(R.
