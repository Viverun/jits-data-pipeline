APPELLANTS\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF MADHYA PRADESH ..... RESPONDENT\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nA.K. PATNAIK J.\n\nThis is an appeal against the judgment dated 7th April, 2006\nof the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur Bench in Criminal Appeal\nNo. 1225 of 2004 by which the High Court has maintained the judgment\nof the XIIIth Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court),\nJabalpur in Sessions Trial No. 671 of 2003 convicting the appellants\nunder\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. On 12th February, 2007, this Court dismissed the petition\nfor special leave to appeal qua petitions Nos. 1 and 3 and issued\nnotice confined to appellant nos. 2 and 4 and on 18th October, 2007,\nthis Court had also granted bail to the said two appellants. Hence\nthis appeal is confined to the appeal of appellant Nos. 2 and 4.\n\n3. The facts very briefly are that Madhuri got married to\nappellant No. 1 at Jabalpur on 10th June, 2003 and she came to the\nhouse of her parents on 5th August, 2003. In the house of her\nparents, she committed suicide by hanging to the ceiling on 17th\nAugust, 2003. The father of the deceased lodged a report with the\nPolice on 17th August, 2003, saying that he had brought his daughter\nto the house on 5th August, 2003 and she was not sent back to her in-\nlaws' house on account of the illness of his wife and she committed\nsuicide. The Police investigated the case and filed a charge sheet\nagainst the appellants under\nSection 304B\nand\n498A\nof the Indian\nPenal Code. The trial court convicted the appellants and the High\nCourt has maintained the conviction.\n\n4. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants and learned\ncounsel for the State at length and we find that the trial court has\nheld on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution witnesses\nthat appellant Nos. 2 and 4 along with appellant No.1 demanded\ncolour TV, `50,000/- in cash and a Hero Honda Motor Cycle towards\ndowry at the time of marriage and just after one day of the marriage\ndid not supply proper meal even to the deceased and, accordingly,\nheld that this was an act of cruelty towards the newly married bride\nand the appellant Nos. 2 and 4 along with the appellant Nos. 1 and 3\nwere jointly and directly liable under\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC.\n\n5. In the appeal before the High Court, it was contented on\nbehalf of appellant nos. 2 and 4 that they were living separately\nand as such no act of cruelty or harassment towards the deceased\ncould be attributed to them. The High Court, however, held that the\ndeceased who was a newly wedded girl would certainly be in a mental\nagony when her parents were making efforts to call appellant Nos. 2\nand 4 along with the other appellants to come and settle the dispute\nwith regard to the dowry and yet the appellants refused to go and\nsettle the matter merely on the ground that they were from the\ngroom's side. The High Court further held that such conduct of the\nappellant Nos. 2 and 4 would certainly be an act of cruelty and\nwould also result in mental distress to a newly married girl who was\nmarried just two months before committing suicide. The High Court\nwas of the opinion that appellant Nos. 2 and 4 in keeping silence\nand in not coming to the rescue of the deceased committed cruelty\neven though they had not caused any physical cruelty to the deceased\nand were liable for the offences under\nSection 498A\nand\n304B\nof the\nIndian Penal Code.\n\n6. We are unable to agree with this opinion of the High Court\nthat by keeping silence and by not coming forward to settle the\ndispute with regard to the dowry, the appellant Nos. 2 and 4 were\nare guilty of the offences under\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof the IPC.\nIn the facts of this case, as found both by the trial court and by\nthe High Court, the deceased got married to the appellant No. 1 on\n10th June, 2003 and she went back to the house of the appellants on\n5th August, 2003 and committed suicide on 17th August, 2003 while\nshe was in the house of her parents. True, there may have been a\ndemand of dowry by the appellants at the time of marriage and it is\nquite possible that the demand of dowry may have persisted even\nafter the marriage but unless it is established that the appellant\nNos. 2 and 4 committed some act of cruelty or harassment towards a\nwoman, they cannot be held guilty of the offences under\nSections\n304B\nand\n498A\nIPC.\n\n7.\nSection 304B\nIPC provides that where the death of a woman is\ncaused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under\nnormal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is\nshown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of her husband, or in\nconnection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called\n'dowry death' and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have\ncaused her death. Hence the criminal liability under\nSection 304B\n\nIPC is attracted not just by the demand of dowry but by the act of\ncruelty or harassment by the husband or any relative of her husband\nin connection with such demand; thus, unless such an act of cruelty\nor harassment is proved to have been caused by the accused to the\ndeceased soon before her death in connection with the demand of\ndowry, the accused cannot be held to be liable for the offence of\ndowry death under\nSection 304B\nIPC. Similarly,\nSection 498A\nIPC\nprovides that the act of cruelty to a woman by her husband or his\nrelative would be punishable and would be attracted only if the\nhusband or his relative commits an act of cruelty within the meaning\nof clauses (a) and (b) in the Explanation to\nSection 498A\nIPC.\n\n8. In this case, the finding of the High Court is that the\nappellant Nos. 2 and 4 did not come forward to participate in the\nsettlement of the dowry on the ground that they belonged to the\ngroom's family and remained silent. This act of remaining silent\ncannot be by any stretch of imagination construed to be an act of\ncruelty or harassment towards the deceased within the meaning of\n\nSection 304B\nIPC. The act of remaining silent with regard to the\nsettlement of the dowry demand will also not amount to cruelty\nwithin the meaning of either clause (a) or clause (b) of the\nExplanation of\nSection 498A\nIPC.\n\n9. In the result, we allow this appeal of appellant Nos. 2 and\n4 and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as\nthe judgment of the trial court and direct that the bail bonds\nfurnished by appellant nos. 2 and 4 will stand discharged.\n\n............................J\n[A.K.

THE FACTS VERY BRIEFLY ARE THAT MADHURI GOT MARRIED TO APPELLANT NO. 1 AT JABALPUR ON 10TH JUNE, 2003 AND SHE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF HER PARENTS ON 5TH AUGUST, 2003.

IN THE APPEAL BEFORE THE HIGH COURT, IT WAS CONTENTED ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT NOS. 2 AND 4 THAT THEY WERE LIVING SEPARATELY AND AS SUCH NO ACT OF CRUELTY OR HARASSMENT TOWARDS THE DECEASED COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THEM. THE HIGH COURT, HOWEVER, HELD THAT THE DECEASED WHO WAS A NEWLY WEDDED GIRL WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN A MENTAL AGONY WHEN HER PARENTS WERE MAKING EFFORTS TO CALL APPELLANT NOS. 2 AND 4 ALONG WITH THE OTHER APPELLANTS TO COME AND SETTLE THE DISPUTE WITH REGARD TO THE DOWRY AND YET THE APPELLANTS REFUSED TO GO AND SETTLE THE MATTER MERELY ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE FROM THE GROOM'S SIDE.
