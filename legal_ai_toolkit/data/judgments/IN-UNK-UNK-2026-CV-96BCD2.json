RAVINDRA BHAT\n\n%\n1. In this petition, the grievance urged is that of cut-off date (of\n01.01.2009) envisioned by the order of the Cabinet Secretariat, Central\nGovernment dated 16.10.2009 granting pension and pensionary benefits to\nSpecial Frontier Force \"SFF\" personnel \"at par with the Indian Army Group\n'Y' PBORs\". They further seek consequential directions that pre 01.01.2009\nveterans/retirees of the SFF should be granted service pension in accordance\nwith the said order of 16.10.2009, disregarding the cut-off date. In short, the\npetitioners' claim that by imposing the cut-off date for the reimbursement of\npensionary and other retirement benefits, the Central Government has\ndiscriminated against the pre 01.01.2009 retirees.\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 1\n 2. SFF was created in the wake of the Chinese aggression in 1962 and\nwas initially comprised only of Tibetans. Later Nepali Gurkhas too were\nrecruited in the SFF - from 1965. The SFF was not treated as part of the\nIndian Army. In August 1971, for the first time, the Central Government\nprovided terminal benefits to members of the Force introducing gratuity @\none month's salary for each completed year of service to those serving for a\nminimum of two years, by Memorandum dated 26.08.1971. By a\nsubsequent policy - embodied in the Cabinet Secretariat letter dated\n20.11.1985, the Central Government enhanced the terminal benefits to 45%\nof the commuted value of service pension admissible to Indian Army\npersonnel, to members of the SFF who completed at least 20 years service.\nThe relevant extract of the said order reads as follows: -\n\n \"......the President is pleased to sanction in addition to the\n retirement benefits indicated in this Secretariat letter dated 26 th\n August, 1971, a lumpsum payment to the leaders/trainees of SFF,\n who retire rendering 20 years' or more of service equivalent to\n the commuted value of 45% of service pension admissible to the\n Army personnel. The amount of service pension will be as\n specified in Annexure-II to Ministry of Defence letter\n No.B/38069/AG/PS4 (a)/222/C/D (Pen/Services) dated 22nd\n January, 1985, and Annexure IV to Ministry of Defence letter\n No.B/33070/AG/PS4(a)/513/C/D (pen/service) dated 22nd\n February 1985 and as may be revised from time to time in\n respect of personnel shown against serial No.3 to 9 and serial\n No.1 and 2 detailed below respectively. For this purpose, the\n SFF personnel will be treated as equivalent to the Army rank\n indicated in column 3 of the table below:\n Sl.No. SFF Rank Army Rank\n 1. Rapon Hon.

These orders will take effect from 6th of May,\n 1985.\"\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 3\n 3. By another order - dated 23.05.1996 - the Central Government acting\nthrough the Cabinet Secretariat enhanced the lump sum pensionary benefits\nby including dearness allowance and interim relief components for the\npurpose of calculation of the commuted value admissible at that time (i.e. at\nthe time of discharge of the SFF personnel). Furthermore, the said order\nalso sanctioned disability benefits to personnel for war injuries and for\ninjuries attributable to force service in the form of lump sum grants along\nwith death benefits to the next of kin. The relevant part of the said order\nreads as follows:-\n\n \"2. The President is pleased to sanction Death Benefits to the\n Next of Kin of SFF personnel, who die in service, and whose\n death is attributable to service, in terms of Government of India,\n Ministry of Defence letter No.1(5)/87/9/(Pension/Service) dated\n 30 October, 1987. Such benefits will be in the form of a lumpsum\n grant worked out as under: -\n (a) Death in Action: - Special Liberalized Family Award,\n equivalent to the commuted value of Emoluments last drawn X\n Purchase Value X 12.\n (b) Death Attributable to Force Service: - Special Family\n Award, equivalent to the commuted value of 50% of Emoluments\n last drawn X Purchase Value X 12.\n Note: - Emoluments as mentioned in (a) and (b) above will\n include Basic Pay, Dearness Allowance and any interim relief\n that may have been sanctioned by the govt., at that particular\n time.\n 3. Consequent to the revision of scales of pay after the\n recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay commission, the death\n benefits described above shall be based on basic pay only.\n 4. The expenditure involved will be met out of the funds\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 4\n placed at the disposal of DACS, New Delhi and debitable to code\n head No.1 Salareis.\"\n4. It is in this background that the impugned order dated 16.10.2009 was\nissued. The factual developments culminated into issuance of the impugned\norder are best described in the Union of India's (hereafter referred to as \"the\nUnion\") counter affidavit. Relevant part of which is extracted below: -\n\n \"4. That acknowledging the outstanding contribution made\n by the Force Personnel, the matter was taken up afresh with the\n Cabinet Secretariat vide this office UO dated 27.04.2006 for\n authorizing pensionary benefits to force personnel at par with\n that of personnel of Indian Army. After protracted\n correspondence, finally, the Cabinet Secretariat vide their Order\n dated 16.10.2009 agreed to provide pensionary and other\n benefits to force Personnel Below Officers Rank (PBOR) as\n applicable to corresponding ranks of Indian Army, Group 'Y'\n PBOR with effect from the date 01.01.2009. A copy of the Order\n dated 16.10.2009 is annexed as Annexure P-4 to the Writ\n Petition and is at page 32 of the paperbook.\n 5. That prior to 01.01.2009 Force Personnel were getting\n lump sum terminal benefits i.e. gratuity and lump sum grant @\n 45% of commuted value of service pension admissible to Indian\n Army personnel at the time of their discharge/retirement from\n service. That normally such terminal financial benefits are\n granted prospectively and not retrospectively unless the\n retrospective grant is specifically mentioned in the Order. There\n is no scope for making departure from this well settled principle\n which has been the subject matter of numerous pronouncements\n by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\"\n5. The impugned order extends complete parity with Indian Army\nGroup 'Y' personnel retiring after 20 years and to the extent relevant is\nreproduced below: -\n\n \"16.10.2009\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 5\n ORDER\n\n Subject: Extension of benefits to SFF-PBORs.\n\n Sanction of the President is hereby accorded to extend the\n following benefits to SFF PBOR (Leaders and Trainees) at par\n with the Indian Army Group 'Y' PBORs.\n\n (a) Grant of pension and other pensionary benefits of SFF\n PBORs (Leaders/Trainees) as applicable to corresponding ranks\n of Indian Army Group 'Y' PBORs.\n\n b) Leave Encashment.\n (c) Composite Transfer Grant.\n (d) Leave Travel Concession.\n (e) Special increment for opting small family norms.\n (f) Transport Allowance.\n (g) Compensation in lieu of Quarter.\n (h) Children Education Allowance.\n (i) Instructional Allowance.\n\n (j) Parity in pay and allowances (including annual\n increment) between SFF PBORs and Indian Army Group 'Y'\n PBORs except grant of Military Service Pay.\n\n 2. The above benefits will be revised automatically as and\n when these benefits are revised by the Ministry of Defence in\n respect of Indian Army PBORs.\n\n 3. These orders will be applicable w.e.f. 01st January, 2009\n to SFF PBORs. This supersedes earlier orders issued on the\n above benefits in respect of SFF PBORs.\n\n 4. The expenditure involved will be met out of the funds\n place at the disposal of Director of Accounts, Cabinet Secretariat\n and debited to Head No.01-Salareis and 2071 - ORB -\n\n Pensionary Benefits.\n\n 5. This has the approval of the Hon'ble Prime Minister vide\n PMO ID No.860/24/P/4/2009-Pol dated 21st September, 2009.\"\n\nArguments on behalf of the petitioners\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 6\n\n 6. Mr. Karan Singh Bhati, learned counsel reiterates the pleadings in the\npetition and urges that the service rendered by SFF personnel is no less than\ncrucial for maintaining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India than\nthat of Indian Army personnel. It was submitted that the SFF was created\nkeeping in mind the distinction between the Indian nationals and others and\nthe need to include the latter as members of the fighting force to guard the\nnation's territories given their special physical attributes, their habits and\ntheir ability to survive in very high altitude and extreme climate. In all\nsenses, the SFF is a military establishment and always functioned as such.\nThe organizations of Units of SFF are identical to that of Army Units. All\nSFF personnel of Nepali origin who are members of the petitioners' Union\nwere made to understand that they would be part of the Indian Army like the\nNepali origin brethren. They participated in several operations. Though\ntheir terms and conditions were initially unclear, the 24.12.1985 order\n(hereafter referred to as \"1985 order\") made it clear that they would be\ngiven retirement benefits and allowed to commute the value of 45% of the\nservice pension admissible to Indian Army personnel. Their equivalence\nvis-à-vis Army ranks were also indicated in the said 1985 order. Learned\ncounsel also referred to the subsequent revision whereby the dearness\nallowance, interim relief and disability benefits were spelt out - emphasizing\nthat these were in line with the benefits which were made available to the\nIndian Army personnel.\n\n7. It is submitted that between 1986 and 2009, former SFF personnel\nsubmitted several representations seeking service pension and for treating\nthem at par with Army personnel. The need to do so was acknowledged by\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 7\n the impugned order whereby complete party with Indian Army personnel\nwas granted. At the same time, however, the Central Government imposed\nthe cut-off date of 01.01.2009 indicating that those discharged or retiring\nfrom SFF after the said date only would be entitled to full pensionary\nbenefits at par in all respects with Indian Army retired personnel.\n\n8. It is argued that the petitioners submitted a detailed representation\npursuant to a previous litigation before this Court (W.P.(C) 8273/2003\nwhich was disposed of on 26.04.2011). They had clearly articulated the\ndemand for parity with SFF personnel who retired after 01.01.2009.\nHowever, this was rejected by the order-dated 08.12.2011. The said letter\nmerely outlines what SFF personnel retiring prior to 01.01.2009 were given\nand stated that improved terms and conditions with consequential benefits\n\"is an ongoing process and cannot be applied with retrospective effect\".\n\n9. Learned counsel relies upon the decisions reported as \nD.S.Nakara and\nOrs. v. Union of India1\n; \nK.J.S. Buttar v. Union of India and Anr2\n; \nUnion of\nIndia and Anr. v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal3\n; \nState of Punjab v. Justice S.S.\nDevan,4\n and \nUnion of India and Anr. v. S.P.S. Vains (Retd\n.) and Ors.5\n\nThe Union's contentions\n\n1\n\n (1983) 1 SCC 305;\n\n2\n\n (2011) 11 SCC 429\n\n3\n\n 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 323\n\n4\n\n (1997) 4 SCC 569\n\n5\n\n 2008 (9) SCC 125.\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 8\n\n 10. The Union in its counter affidavit urges, and its counsel Ms. Barkha\nBabbar argues- that the Central Government had approved pension to SFF\npersonnel who retired on or after 01.01.2009 based upon recommendations\nof Committee of Secretaries after due deliberations. It is further submitted\nthat the request of the SFF personnel for grant of pension benefits was\nprojected to the Government during 1993-94 but was not acceded to at that\ntime. The case was again taken up on December 2008. These\nrecommendations were approved subsequently. It is argued that\nimprovement of terms and conditions- with consequential benefits, are an\nongoing process and that those retiring earlier cannot insisted upon the\nadditional benefits given to those who retire later. It is submitted, therefore,\nthat SFF personnel fall in a separate class and cannot expect the grant of\npensionary benefits at par with those retiring after 01.01.2009. The SFF\npersonnel retiring prior to that date were given adequate financial benefits in\nthe shape of lump sum pension benefits as full compensation, i.e., (i) 45% of\ncommuted value of service being as admissible to Army personnel with\ndearness allowance on it and (ii) retirement gratuity @ one month's pay for\neach completed year of service as compared which was higher than what is\nordinarily given to the Central Government employee, i.e., 15 days pay for\nevery completed year of service with a cap of 16½ months.\n\n11. It is further submitted that the action of the Government in limiting\nthe said benefits to Government Employees who retired on or after\n01.01.2009 due to financial constraints is neither arbitrary nor irrational nor\nviolates \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court has held\nin several judgments that financial constraint was a valid ground for fixation\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 9\n of cut-off date for grant of pension. That \nArticle 14\n does not prohibit\nreasonable classification, which is based on an intelligible differentia having\na rational relation to the object sought to be achieved. That \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution does not take away from the state or its instrumentality the\npower of classification, which to some degree is bound to produce some\ninequality.\n\n12. It is further submitted that the SFF personnel are not equated with the\nArmy personnel as far as their pay and allowances, pensionary benefits and\nother facilities are concerned. SFF personnel were aware of this at the time\nof recruitment and had even signed a certificate to this effect at the time of\njoining the service. The Union highlights that there was no parity in pay and\nallowances between the Indian Army personnel and SFF personnel. SFF\npersonnel were brought at par in pay and allowances and pension with the\npersonnel of the Indian Army only with effect from 01.01.2009. Earlier they\nwere not entitled to even annual increments but were given biennial\nincrements instead of annual increments prior to 01.01.2009.\n\n13. It is submitted that up to 31.12.2008 approximately 5727 personnel\nwere discharged from the SFF who had rendered more than 15 years of\nservice in SFF since its raising date. The Union also highlights the\nfollowing:\n\n (a) Retired SFF Force personnel have been paid lump sum\n terminal gratuity at the rate of one month's pay for each completed\n years of service subject to the condition that they must have put in a\n minimum of 2 years service in SFF. The maximum gratuity is\n admissible for 16½ months only (i.e. at the rate of one fourth of\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 10\n emoluments for each completed six months period of qualifying\n service) to the Force personnel retired on or after 01.01.2009.\n\n (b) Such retired SFF Force personnel have also been paid lump\n sum terminal benefits equivalent to the commuted value of 45% of\n service pension as admissible to the Army personnel who retired after\n rendering 20 years or more of service from 6th May 1985.\n\n (c) From 23.05.1996, DA/IR was also admissible while calculating\n the commuted value of pension given to the SFF personnel.\n\n (d) Disability benefits were payable in the forms of lump sum grant\n at the rate of commuted value of 50% of the emoluments last drawn\n plus full disability element x purchase value x 12 in the case of War\n Injury and commuted value of 45% of pension or service element plus\n 45% disability element x purchase value x 12 in the case of Disability\n Attributable.\n\n (e) In the case of death, of SFF Personnel their families/NOK had\n also been paid death benefits in the form of lump sum benefits which\n are as under: -\n\n i. (i) Death in Action: - Special Liberalized Family Award,\n Equivalent to the commuted value of Emoluments last drawn\n x Purchase Value x 12.\n\n ii. (ii) Death Attributable to Force Service: - Special Family\n Award, equivalent to the commuted value of 50% of\n Emoluments last drawn x Purchase Value x 12.\n\n14. It is lastly argued that the provision of cut-off date cannot be termed\nunreasonable or arbitrary. Learned counsel submits that in a number of\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 11\n cases it was ruled that fresh financial benefits conferred on the basis of\nassessments of financial outlay from a given date taking into consideration\nall relevant factors would per se not be arbitrary. Learned counsel relies\nupon the decision reported as \nIndian Ex-Services League & Ors. v. Union of\nIndia6\n; \nUnion of India & Ors. v. Lt. Mrs. E. Iacats7\n; \nState of Punjab v. Amar\nNath Goyal & Ors8\n; \nP.K.Kapur v. Union of India9\n; \nGovt. of A.P. v. N.\nSubbarayudu & Ors10\n and \nUnion of India v. N.K. Narikar (Civil Appeal\nNos.8433-8434\n of 2009, decided on 24.05.2012).\n\nAnalysis & Conclusions\n\n15. The foregoing discussion reveals uncontroverted facts. The petitioners\nhad served for varying periods for the Indian Army. They were not Army\nregulars; nor are they Indian nationals. Yet, they stood at the border,\nshoulder to shoulder with Indian Army personnel, to patrol and defend our\nborders. The Indian Union gave them grudging and incremental recognition\nfor these services. The first time, on 26.08.1971 terminal benefit, restricted\nto gratuity of one month for each completed year of service (subject to two\nyears' minimum service) was provided for. The order of 20.11.1985 stated\nthat the leaders/trainees of SFF, who retire rendering 20 years' or more of\n\n6\n\n (1991) 2 SCC 104\n\n7\n\n (1997) 7 SCC 334\n\n8\n\n (2005) 6 SCC 754\n\n9\n\n (2007) 9 SCC 425\n\n10\n\n (2008) 14 SCC 702\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 12\n service would be eligible for a lump sum payment equivalent, to the\ncommuted value of 45% of the service pension admissible to the Army\npersonnel. The amount of service pension was specified in Annexure-II to\nMinistry of Defence letter dated 22nd January, 1985, and Annexure IV to\nMinistry of Defence letter dated 22nd February 1985 \"and as may be revised\nfrom time to time\". Those personnel entitled to these benefits were shown in\nthe said circular of 20.11.1985. This order also stated that \"For this\npurpose, the SFF personnel will be treated as equivalent to the Army rank\nindicated in column 3 of the table below..\" Thus, parity with Army\npersonnel in the various ranks provided for, was clearly spelt out. By the\nsubsequent order of 23.05.1996, - the Central Government increased the\nlump sum pensionary benefits. It included dearness allowance and interim\nrelief components for the purpose of calculation of the commuted value\nadmissible at that time (i.e. at the time of discharge of the SFF personnel).\nThe said order furthermore, sanctioned disability benefits to personnel for\nwar injuries and for injuries attributable to force service in the form of lump\nsum grants along with death benefits to the next of kin. Repeated\nrepresentations were apparently made for parity with Army personnel. It\nwas thereafter that the impugned order was issued. The said impugned order\nsignificantly brought about parity with Army personnel. It permitted, inter\nalia:\n\n \"Grant of pension and other pensionary benefits of SFF PBORs\n (Leaders/Trainees) as applicable to corresponding ranks of\n Indian Army Group 'Y' PBORs.\"\n\nOther benefits and allowances too, were granted. However, the operation of\nthis parity was made effective from 01.01.2009. The petitioners complain of\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 13\n discrimination stating that as pre 2009 retirees, they are no different from\nthose entitled to the benefits of the impugned order. They submit that their\nreal claim is not with Army personnel; so long as differentiation with the\nlatter existed, they had no complaint. However, the establishment of\ncomplete parity between Army personnel and these class of individuals who\nperformed similar functions in the past, meant that they too had to be given\nidentical benefits. In other words, the date based classification according to\nthe petitioners, is impermissible and undermines the mandate of \nArticle 14\n,\nthe equality principle and the equal protection clause.\n\n16. The respondents counter the claim stating that those who retired in the\npast and secured benefits based on existing instructions and terms cannot be\nequated with those retiring after 01.01.2009. They submit that the scheme\nmade effective from such date really is a new one and not an extension of\nthe existing one. If the scheme is a new one, the question of the State's\nliability to include past employees does not arise. They also submit that\nincreased financial burden is a relevant consideration for the Union when it\ndesignated a particular date for the operation of the impugned order and\nscheme. It was lastly contended that the parity with Army personnel is not\nan apt analogy because those who retired earlier were given lump sum\namounts vastly higher than the gratuity entitlement of army personnel.\n\n17. Date based classifications have engaged considerable judicial\nattention in the past three decades. \nIn the first of its series, \nD.R. Nim v\nUnion of India11\n the Supreme Court held that \"the Central Government\n\n11\n\n AIR 1967 SC 1301\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 14\n cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it seems to have done in\nthis case-and say that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be\napproved..\" The context of that decision was the period of service, which\nthe petitioner had served, but was ignored by the Central Government,\nwithout any reason.\n\n18. In D.S. Nakara12 the Supreme Court held that a date based\nclassification case which discriminated between two sets of pensioners\ndepending upon when they retired from service- ruled, through a\nConstitution Bench, that a classification must be founded on an intelligible\ndifferentia which should have a rational relation to the object sought to be\nachieved. The Court has held that though a scheme can be prospective, the\nbenefit of liberalized pension scheme should be applied equally to all and\nthey are required to be paid the upward revision commencing from the\nspecified date. It was stated that:\n\n \"42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the\n pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class,\n would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be\n divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to\n purpose of revision, and would such classification be founded on\n some rational principle? The classification has to be based, as is\n well settled, on some rational principle and the rational principle\n must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. We have\n set out the objects underlying the payment of pension. If the State\n considered it necessary to liberalise the pension scheme, we find\n no rational principle behind it for granting these benefits only to\n those who retired subsequent to that date simultaneously denying\n the same to those who retired prior to that date.\n\n12\n\n foot note1 supra\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 15\n\n If the liberalisation was considered necessary for augmenting\n social security in old age to government servants then those who,\n retired earlier cannot be worst off than those who retire later.\n Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two\n classes is not based on any rational principle and if the rational\n principle is the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving\n something more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be\n discriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired just a\n day prior and another a day just succeeding the specified date.\n Both were in the same pay bracket, the average emolument was\n the same and both had put in equal number of years of service.\n\n How does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day earlier or a\n day later will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of\n pension? One retiring a day earlier will have to be subject to\n ceiling of Rs 8100 p.a. and average emolument to be worked out\n on 36 months' salary while the other will have a ceiling of Rs\n 12,000 p.a. and average emolument will be computed on the\n basis of last 10 months' average. The artificial division stares\n into face and is unrelated to any principle and whatever\n principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the objects\n sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme.\n\n In fact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the\n liberalised pension scheme but it is counter-productive and runs\n counter to the whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal\n treatment guaranteed in \nArticle 14\n is wholly violated inasmuch\n as the pension rules being statutory in character, since the\n specified date, the rules accord differential and discriminatory\n treatment to equals in the matter of commutation of pension. A\n 48 hours' difference in matter of retirement would have a\n traumatic effect. Division is thus both arbitrary and\n unprincipled. Therefore, the classification does not stand the test\n of \nArticle 14.\n 43. Further the classification is wholly arbitrary\n because we do not find a single acceptable or persuasive reason\n for this division. This arbitrary action violated the guarantee of\n \nArticle 14....\"\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 16\n\n 19. \nIn \nDhan Raj & Ors. v. State of J & K & Ors13\n, the appellants who had\nretired from the services of their employer Corporation prior to 09.06.1981\nclaimed entitlement to pensionary benefits by virtue of a Government Order\ndated 03.10.1986. The State's contention that the benefit could not be\nextended to the appellants was rejected. It was held that:-\n\n \"14. Even otherwise, we do not find any justifiable criteria for\n the State Government to draw the line between those who retired\n earlier and those who retired after 9-6-1981. Both such set of\n employees were equally placed in the same\n Undertaking/Corporation temporary in character and all having\n served in the organisations for more than 20 years. In fact, the\n appellants have served with the Government for more than 30 to\n 40 years. The person serving for such a long period earns his\n legitimate expectation. It is not something which he seeks with a\n begging bowl.\n\n It is inappropriate for a State Government to take up a stand to\n get its own order to be held illegal, by giving restrictive\n interpretation to deny benefit to its own employees who had\n worked for such a long period. \nIn fact, in the Constitution Bench\n decision of this Court in \nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n [1983 (1)\n SCC 305] this Court held that criterion of date of enforcement of\n the revised scheme entitling benefits of the revision to those\n retiring after specified date while depriving the benefits to those\n retiring prior to that date was violative of \nArticle 14.\n\n Even otherwise, while considering the question of grant of\n pensionary benefits the State has to act to reach the\n constitutional goal of setting up a socialist State as stated and the\n assurance as given in the Directive Principles of State Policy. A\n pension is a part and parcel of that goal, which secures to a\n person serving with the State after retirement of his livelihood.\n To deny such a right to such a person, without any sound\n\n13\n\n [1998 (4) SCC 30]\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 17\n reasoning or any justifiable differentia would be against the\n spirit of the Constitution. We find in the present case the stand\n taken by the State Government to be contrary to the said spirit. In\n the aforesaid D.S. Nakara this Court has very clearly recorded\n the following:\n\n \"36. Having set out clearly the society which we propose to set\n up, the direction in which the State action must move, the welfare\n State which we propose to build up, the constitutional goal of\n setting up a socialist State and the assurance in the Directive\n Principles of State Policy especially of security in old age at least\n to those who have rendered useful service during their active\n years, it is indisputable, nor was it questioned, that pension as a\n retirement benefit is in consonance with and in furtherance of the\n goals of the Constitution. The goals for which pension is paid\n themselves give a fillip and push to the policy of setting up a\n welfare State because by pension the socialist goal of security of\n cradle to grave is assured at least when it is mostly needed and\n least available, namely, in the fall of life.\"\n\n 14\n\n20. \nIn \nV. Kasturi v. Managing Director, State Bank of India & Anr.\n the\nSupreme Court observed as follows:\n\n \"22. If the person retiring is eligible for pension at the time of his\n retirement and if he survives till the time of subsequent\n amendment of the relevant pension scheme, he would become\n eligible to get enhanced pension or would become eligible to get\n more pension as per the new formula of computation of pension\n subsequently brought into force, he would be entitled to get the\n benefit of the amended pension provision from the date of such\n order as he would be a member of the very same class of\n pensioners when the additional benefit is being conferred on all\n of them.\n\n14\n\n 1998 (8) SCC 30\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 18\n\n \nIn such a situation, the additional benefit available to the same\n class of pensioners cannot be denied to him on the ground that\n he had retired prior to the date on which the aforesaid additional\n benefit was conferred on all the members of the same class of\n pensioners who had survived by the time the scheme granting\n additional benefit to these pensioners came into force. The line of\n decisions tracing their roots to the ratio of \nNakara\n case [1983\n (1) SCC 305] would cover this category of cases\".\n\n21. The next case is \nAll India Reserve Bank Retired Officers Assn. v.\nUnion of India15\n the Court observed:\n\n \"It must be realised that in the case of an employee governed by\n the CPF (Contributory Provident Fund) Scheme his relations\n with the employer come to an end on his retirement and receipt\n of the CPF amount but in the case of an employee governed\n under the pension scheme his relations with the employer merely\n undergo a change but do not snap altogether.\n\n \nThat is the reason why this Court in \nNakara\n case drew a\n distinction between liberalisation of an existing benefit and\n introduction of a totally new scheme. In the case of pensioners it\n is necessary to revise the pension periodically as the continuous\n fall in the rupee value and the rise in prices of essential\n commodities necessitates an adjustment of the pension amount\n but that is not the case of employees governed under the CPF\n Scheme, since they had received the lump sum payment which\n they were at liberty to invest in a manner that would yield\n optimum return which would take care of the inflationary trends.\n\n This distinction between those belonging to the pension scheme\n and those belonging to the CPF Scheme has been rightly\n emphasised by this Court in Krishena case [1990 (4) SCC 207]\".\n\n22. \nState Bank of India v. L. Kannaiah & Ors16\n, was with respect to the\nfixation of cut-off date for applicability of a pension scheme. The minimum\n\n15\n\n 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 664\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 19\n service prescribed was 20 years and cut-off date for such induction was\nfixed as 01.01.1965. The Supreme Court held that minimum qualifying\nservice being the essential consideration, there was no rationale to exclude\nemployees confirmed earlier who had served more than 20 years. The Court\nobserved:-\n\n \"6. Para 5 of the circular stipulated that the age-limit (viz. not\n being over 35 years) for admission to Pension Fund shall\n continue. Thus the pensioned ex-service personnel were admitted\n to pensionary benefits with effect from 1-1-1965 subject to the\n restriction of the age-limit of 35 years (which was later on\n enhanced to 38 years) on that date. As the date of confirmation of\n the respondents was much earlier to 1-1-1965, the crucial date\n for admission to the Pension Fund would be 1-1-1965.\n\n On that date, the confirmed employee of the Bank should not\n have exceeded 35 years of age. That is the combined effect of\n Staff Circular No. 18 dated 8-4-1974 read with the Pension Fund\n Rules referred to supra. The reason for prescribing the maximum\n age-limit of 35 or 38, as the case may be, for the purpose of\n induction into Pension Fund appears to be that the employee\n would be able to render minimum service of 20 years as\n contemplated by Rule 22 of the Pension Fund Rules. However,\n there does not appear to be any rationale or discernible basis for\n fixing the cut-off date as 1-1-1965, notwithstanding their earlier\n confirmation in bank service.\n\n \nTrue, a new benefit has been conferred on the ex-servicemen and\n therefore, a cut-off date could be fixed for extending this new\n benefit, without offending the ratio of the decision in \nD.S. Nakara\n v. Union of India\n [1983 (1) SCC 305] but, there could be no\n arbitrariness or irrationality in fixing such date. Minimum\n qualifying service being the essential consideration, even\n according to the Bank, there is no reason why the ex-servicemen\n\n16\n\n 2003 (10) SCC 499\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 20\n like the respondents, who from the date of their confirmation had\n put in more than twenty years of service, even taking the\n retirement age as 58, should be excluded.\n\n No reason is forthcoming in the counter-affidavit filed by the\n Bank for choosing the said date. When it is decided to extend the\n pensionary benefits to ex-servicemen drawing pension, the denial\n of the benefit to some of the serving employees should be based\n on rational and intelligible criterion. In substance, that is the\n view taken by the High Court and we see no reason to differ with\n that view\".\n\n23. SPS Vains17, considered \nNakara\n (supra) and applied its ratio. It was\nheld that there could not be disparity of pension within the same rank. It was\nheld that:-\n\n \"29. The Constitution Bench (in D.S. Nakara [1983 (1) SCC\n 305]) has discussed in detail the objects of granting pension and\n we need not, therefore, dilate any further on the said subject, but\n the decision in the aforesaid case has been consistently referred\n to in various subsequent judgments of this Court, to which we\n need not refer. In fact, all the relevant judgments delivered on the\n subject prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench have been\n considered and dealt with in detail in the aforesaid case. The\n directions ultimately given by the Constitution Bench in the said\n case in order to resolve the dispute which had arisen, is of\n relevance to resolve the dispute in this case also.\n\n \n30. However, before we give such directions we must also\n observe that the submissions advanced on behalf of the Union of\n India cannot be accepted in view of the decision in \nD.S. Nakara\n\n case. The object sought to be achieved was not to create a class\n within a class, but to ensure that the benefits of pension were\n made available to all persons of the same class equally. To hold\n otherwise would cause violence to the provisions of \nArticle 14\n of\n\n17\n\n footnote 5 supra.\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 21\n the Constitution. It could not also have been the intention of the\n authorities to equate the pension payable to officers of two\n different ranks by resorting to the step-up principle envisaged in\n the fundamental rules in a manner where the other officers\n belonging to the same cadre would be receiving a higher\n pension\".\n\n24. K.J.S. Buttar18, was a case where new retirement benefits were\nintroduced and measurement to calculate disability was changed pursuant to\nrecommendation made by the Fifth Pay Commission and same was\nimplemented with effect from 01.01.1996. The appellant was denied\nretirement benefits on account of his retirement in 1979. The Court held the\ntreatment as discriminatory and highlighted that restriction of benefit to only\nofficers who were invalided out of service after 1.1.1996 violated \nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution and was unsustainable. In the case of liberalization of\nexisting scheme all pensioners are to be treated equally. The appellant was\nentitled to all retirement benefits with effect from 1.1.1996. The Court stated\nthat:-\n\n \"11. In our opinion the appellant was entitled to the benefit of\n Para 7.2 of the Instructions dated 31-1-2001 according to which\n where the disability is assessed between 50% and 75% then the\n same should be treated as 75%, and it makes no difference\n whether he was invalided from service before or after 1-1-1996.\n Hence the appellant was entitled to the said benefits with arrears\n from 1-1-1996, and interest at 8% per annum on the same.\n\n 12. It may be mentioned that the Government of India, Ministry\n of Defence had been granting war injury pension to pre-1996\n retirees also in terms of Para 10.1 of the Ministry's Letter No.\n 1(5)/87/D(Pen-Ser) dated 30-10-1987 (p. 59, Para 8). The mode\n\n18\n\n Footnote 2 supra\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 22\n of calculation, however, was changed by the Notification dated\n 31-1-2001 which was restricted to post-1996 retirees. The\n appellant, therefore, was entitled to the war injury pension even\n prior to 1-1-1996 and especially in view of the Instructions dated\n 31-1-2001 issued by the Government of India. The said\n instruction was initially for persons retiring after 1-1-1996 but\n later on by virtue of the subsequent Notifications dated 16-5-\n 2001 it was extended to pre-1996 retirees also on rationalisation\n of the scheme\".\n\n25. Kallakkurichi Taluk Retired Official Association, Tamil Nadu, etc. v\nState of Tamil Nadu19 was a case where the Supreme Court had to consider\nchallenge to a dearness allowance component fixation formula, which had\nthe effect of lowering the pension of those retiring after 1.06.1988. It was\nheld that:\n\n \"31. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the\n controversy in hand, it is not possible for us to find a valid\n justification for the State Government to have classified\n pensioners similarly situated as the appellants herein (who had\n retired after 1.6.1988), from those who had retired prior thereto.\n Inflation, in case of all such pensioners, whether retired prior to\n 1.6.1988 or thereafter, would have had the same effect on all of\n them. The purpose of adding the component of 'dearness pay' to\n wages for calculating pension is to offset the effect of inflation. In\n our considered view, therefore, the instant classification made by\n the State Government in the impugned Government order dated\n 9.8.1989 placing employees who had retired after 1.6.1988 at a\n disadvantage, vis-à-vis the employees who retired prior thereto,\n by allowing them a lower component of 'dearness pay', is clearly\n arbitrary and discriminatory, and as such, is liable to be set\n aside, as violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of\n India.\"\n\n19\n\n 2013 (4) SCR 883\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 23\n Thus, the general rule is that if an existing pension scheme is improved or\nmodified, all those to whom the scheme applied (regardless of their date of\nsuperannuation) would be entitled to the benefit.\n\n26. The respondents relied on \nGovt. of A.P. v. N. Subbarayudu\n 2008 (14)\nSCC 702. The Supreme Court held, in that decision, that:\n\n \"There may be various considerations in the mind of the\n executive authorities due to which a particular cut off date has\n been fixed. These considerations can be financial, administrative\n or other considerations. The Court must exercise judicial\n restraint and must ordinarily leave it to the executive authorities\n to fix the cut off date. The Government must be left with some\n leeway and free play at the joints in this connection.\n In fact several decisions of this Court have gone to the extent of\n saying that the choice of a cut off date cannot be dubbed as\n arbitrary even if no particular reason is given for the same in the\n counter affidavit filed by the Government, (unless it is shown to\n be totally capricious or whimsical)\"\n\nState of Punjab Vs. Amar Nath Goel20\n had confined pension benefits with\nreference to a cut-off date. The Court held as follows:\n\n \"It is difficult to accede to the argument on behalf of the\n employees that a decision of the Central Government/ State\n Governments to limit the benefits only to employees, who retire\n or die on or after 1.4.1995, after calculating the financial\n implications thereon, was either irrational or arbitrary.\n Financial and economic implications are very relevant and\n germane for any policy decision touching the administration of\n the Government, at the Centre or at the State level.......As we\n have already noticed, 1.4.1995 was the date suggested by the\n Fifth Central Pay Commission (\"Pay Commission\") in its Interim\n Report. The Central Government took a conscious stand that the\n consequential financial burden would be unbearable. It,\n\n20\n\n (2005) 6 SCC 754\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 24\n therefore, chose to taper down the financial burden by making\n the benefits available only from 1.4.1995. It is trite that, the final\n recommendations of the Pay Commission were not ipso facto\n binding on the Government, as the Government had to accept\n and implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission\n consistent with its financial position. This is precisely what the\n Government did. Such an action on the part of the Government\n can neither be characterized as irrational, nor as arbitrary so as\n to infringe \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\"\n\n27. \nIn \nP.K. Kapur\n (supra) the Supreme Court held that in matters of pay\nor pension benefits, classification is permissible and that recommendations\nof expert bodies such as Pay Commissions can be persuasive and acted upon\nwithout offending \nArticle 14.\n \nIn \nMrs. Iacats\n (supra) the Supreme Court\nfirstly explained developments after Nakara:\n\n \"This decision has been subsequently explained and\n distinguished in a number of cases. In the case Dr. (Mrs.)\n Sushma Sharma etc. etc. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. (AIR 1985\n SC 1367 at 1379) this Court cited with approval the observations\n of this Court in Union of India & Anr. Etc. V. Parameswaran\n Match Works Ltd. (AIR 1974 SC 2349) to the effect that the\n choice of date as a basis of classification cannot always be\n dubbed as arbitrary unless it is capricious or whimsical....The\n respondent, therefore, cannot claim the benefit of a scheme\n which came into operation from a date subsequent to the date of\n her retirement. The respondent also did not contend either before\n the High Court or in the grounds of appeal before us that a cut-\n off date for grant of pensionery benefits is arbitrary or\n unreasonable. Even otherwise in view of the fact that a study\n team was first appointed and pursuant to its report certain\n benefits were given after considering the report of the study\n group would show that the cut-off date had a logical nexus with\n the decision to grant these benefits on the basis of the report of\n the study team. Fresh financial benefits which are conferred also\n have to be based on proper estimates of financial outlay\n required. Bearing in mind all relevant factors, if such a benefit is\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 25\n conferred from a given date, such conferment of benefits from a\n given date cannot be considered as arbitrary or unreasonable.\"\n\n28. \nIn \nIndian Ex-Servicemen League\n (supra), the Supreme Court\ndescribed the claim made before it, in the following terms:\n\n \"According to learned counsel for the petitioners, the result of\n the decision in Nakara is that all retirees who held the same rank\n irrespective of their date of retirement must get the same amount\n of pension and this should be the amount which was calculated\n and shown in the appendices to the Memorandum (Ex. P-2)\n challenged in Nakara. Admittedly, the appendices to that\n Memorandum specified the computation of pension for different\n ranks of retirees on or after 1.4.1979 made on the basis of the\n reckonable emoluments on 1.4.1979. It is also admitted that the\n reckonable emoluments for corresponding ranks on earlier dates\n were not the same to provide identical basis for recomputation of\n pension according to the liberalised pension scheme of pre.\n 1.4.1979 retirees. In substance, even though learned counsel for\n the petitioners do not say so, the arguments amount to the claim\n of `one rank, one pension' for all retirees of the Armed Forces\n irrespective of their date of retirement. It is also admitted that\n prior to this liberalised pension scheme, the pension amount of\n the earlier retirees from the same rank was not the same\n irrespective of their date of retirement or in other words, the\n principle of `one rank, one pension' did not apply earlier. It was\n stated at the Bar that the demand of `one rank, one pension' is\n pending consideration of the Government of India as a separate\n issue. It is, therefore, clear that unless the petitioner's claim in\n substance of `one rank, one pension' can be treated as flowing\n from the relief granted in Nakara, the reliefs claimed in these\n petitions though differently worded cannot be granted.\n\n29. The Court had earlier noticed the issue in Nakara that there the\n\"liberalised pension formula introduced a slab system, raised the ceiling\nand provided for a better average of emoluments for computation of pension\nand the liberalised scheme was made applicable to employees governed by\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 26\n the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, retiring on or after the\nspecified date.\" It was then held that the liberalized formula of calculating\npension rates, which had been extended to pre-1979 retirees in line with\n\nNakara\n (supra) and that consequently, the claim for one pension for all, was\nuntenable.\n\n30. A reading of the decisions relied upon by the respondents reveals\nfirstly that ipso facto, the choice of a date would not be lightly interfered\nwith by courts on the ground of discrimination, unless it is plainly arbitrary.\nN. Subbarayudu, Amar Nath Goel and P.K. Kapur (all decisions of smaller\nbenches) went on to suggest that Pay Commission recommendations are per\nse not binding and that the State can designate a particular date for the\noperation of a pension scheme.\n\n31. All the decisions of the Supreme Court, right from Nakara emphasize\nthat a distinction between beneficiaries of a new pension scheme and\nexisting pensioners has to be kept in mind. If the benefit introduced is an\nimprovement of an existing scheme, it cannot exclude those who retired\nearlier. The Supreme Court, in \nKrishena Kumar v Union of India21\n\nemphasized the distinction between pensioners and CPF retirees. However,\nthe formulation in Nakara that benefits of an improved or liberalized scheme\ncan be given to earlier retirees, was not disturbed. That was a Constitution\nbench decision. In Indian Ex-Servicemen League - another Constitution\nBench decision, the same distinction between a new scheme and a mere\nimprovement was maintained.\n \nYet another Constitution Bench iterated the\nsame enunciation of law when it stated, in All India Reserve Bank\n\n21\n\n 1990 (4) SCC 207\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 \nPage 27\n Employees Association\n (supra) that a \"distinction between liberalisation of\nan existing benefit and introduction of a totally new scheme\" is to be kept in\nmind, while considering grievances stemming from cut-off dates that\ndeprive pension benefits.\n\n32. Does the impugned order introduce a new scheme, or is it an\nimprovement of an existing scheme, which, but for the cut-off date, would\nhave covered the members of the petitioner association who left\nemployment before 01.01.2009. If one sees the history and chronology of\nthe manner in which pensionary or terminal benefits were introduced, two\ndistinct phases are noticeable. The first phase was between 1971 and 1985.\nDuring this period, there was no attempt to grant any but the bare minimum\nbenefits to the class of employees that the petitioner represents. The benefits\nwere only a months' pay for each completed year of service at the end of the\nperiod of service. This changed significantly with the distribution of benefits\naccording to the order of 1985. This proclaimed the second phase where not\nonly was a specific reference made to benefits vis-à-vis Indian Army\npersonnel, even rank parity was declared for the purpose. What was granted\nhowever, was not pension, but a lump sum amount equivalent to 45% of the\ncommuted value of pension that would be payable to an Army personnel\n(\"commuted value of 45% of service pension admissible to the Army\npersonnel\"). Even the head of expenditure is as follows:\n\n \"The expenditure involved in payment of the lumpsum amount as\n per para I above, will be debited to the Major Head \"266 -\n Pension and other retirement benefits commuted value of pension\n \"whereas the expenditure on payment of service gratuity in terms\n of this Secretariat letter dated 26th August, 1971, will be\n classified to the same Major Head, i.e., \"266 - Pension and\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 28\n other retirement benefits - Gratuities.\"22\nThere was an improvement or enhancement of the benefits, with increase in\nthe rates as a result in the inclusion of certain other components for\ncalculating the lump sum amounts, in 1996. It was in this background that\nthe impugned order granted complete parity between Army personnel and\nthose leaving the service of the Indian Government, but employed in the\nborder from amongst Nepali and Tibetan nationals, after 01.01.2009.\n\n33. It is not disputed- indeed the Union admits it as much - that SFF\npersonnel have made \"outstanding contribution\" to the nation's defense and\nsecurity23. Their service and sacrifice is of the same order as Indian nationals\nwho are members of the Indian Army. They do not claim to belong to the\nIndian Army; what they however demand is that retirement benefits and\npension given to members of the SFF who retire after 01.01.2009 too should\nbe given to them. Both these categories clearly form one class, i.e former\nSFF personnel. In fact, in all likelihood most of them served together. The\nfact that the long standing demand of SFF personnel for parity with Indian\nArmy personnel was conceded and given effect later, is what is impeding the\nparity implicitly acknowledged by the impugned order.\n\n34. The pre-existing scheme of retirement benefits entailed release of\namounts with reference to the commuted value of what was payable to\nIndian Army personnel. In essence the earlier order of 1985 ordained the\nparity, which had been lacking. What however, distinguished that regime\nfrom the present one is the mode of disbursement. The Union chose one\n\n22\n\n Government letter dated 20-11-1985\n\n23\n\n Para 4 of the Union's counter affidavit, quoted earlier.\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 29\n mode, i.e disbursement of a lump sum amount. But significantly, what was\nguaranteed was with reference to 45% of what the retired Indian Army\npersonnel was entitled to receive as the commuted value of his pension. If\nthe commuted pension value was ` 1000, a SFF retiree was entitled to `\n450/-. In the Court's opinion, the Union's argument that the impugned\nscheme introduces a new benefit altogether is without merit. The parity in\nrank between Army personnel and SFF personnel was brought about in 1985\nitself; that parity remains and endures. That parity would ordinarily have\nmeant disbursement of pension at par with what Army personnel were\nentitled to; however, for its own convenience the Union sought to make one-\ntime payment choosing not to make out any further payouts. The situation\nimproved, when in 1996 various elements apart from the pay alone were\nincluded for calculation of the lump sum amounts. However, the status of\nSFF retirees as those entitled to treatment similar to Army personnel\ncontinued. The new scheme is only an improvement, if viewed from this\nperspective, because it enlarges and extends the benefits - much like the\n1996 memorandum and includes a whole series of other monetary elements.\nBesides, the mode of payout (from lump sum to monthly pension) is\nchanged. However, the essential parity of status and entitlement based on\nthat status, continues. In other words, the introduction of the scheme in 2009\nis not a new one, but would really be a liberalized one extending the benefits\nof the existing one; doing away with lump sum payments on the one hand,\nand incurring the liability of monthly payouts.\n\n35. This court is of the opinion that the introduction of 01.01.2009 as a\ncut-off in the light of the above discussion, is impermissible classification.\nThere is no justification why this differentia is introduced, given that both\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 30\n pre and post 2009 SFF retirees performed the same duties and stood to\nbenefit in terms of rank parity with Army personnel, for purposes of\npensionary benefits, since 1985. Arguendo some basis for such differentia,\nabsolutely no rationale is shown for such differentiation with the object\nsought to be achieved, i.e monthly payment of pension. The mere ipse dixit\nthat the Union would be burdened with greater monetary liability, rings\nhollow if seen from the perspective that lump sum payment meant a larger\none-time payout, whereas monthly payment spreads liability rather than\naggregates it.\n\n36. The above declaration that the introduction of the date, i.e 01.01.2009\nwould, however, not be dispositive of the petition. This court is also\nconscious that the petitioners derived a one-time benefit -of a single sum\npayout -and are now seeking parity with pensioners, who would not secure\nsuch payouts, but rather be entitled to monthly pension. It is also a fact that\nthe petitioners had the benefit of the lump sum amounts, which had greater\nvalue when they received it. In the circumstances, the court is of the opinion\nthat ends of justice would be sub-served if the respondents ensure that like in\nthe case of regular Army personnel, upon completion of the period of\ncommutation (15 years) in the petitioners' case, the amount commuted (i.e\n45%) is restored. This would enure to the benefit of all parties, for the\nreason that instead of directing repayment of amounts received with some\nrate of interest (which would cause hardship to individuals) on the one hand\nand directing the Union to make full payments to the petitioners who had\nreceived lump sum payments in accordance with the prevailing scheme at\nrates which were somewhat higher (especially gratuity calculation) than in\nthe case of Army personnel, - an option unforeseen by the Union and which\n\nW.P.(C) 1335/2012 Page 31\n would result in burdening it- payment of the proportion which was made in\nproportion to the percentage of the commuted value would be the most apt\nin the circumstances.\n\n37. In the light of the above discussion, the writ petition has to succeed; a\ndirection is accordingly issued to the respondents to issue a Circular to the\neffect that the commuted value (45% of the commuted equivalent of pension\nof an Indian Army personnel) would be restored to all pre-01.01.2009\nretirees, upon the completion of 15 years from the date of their\nsuperannuation.

If\nthe commuted pension value was ` 1000, a SFF retiree was entitled to `\n450/-.

The parity in\nrank between Army personnel and SFF personnel was brought about in 1985\nitself; that parity remains and endures. That parity would ordinarily have\nmeant disbursement of pension at par with what Army personnel were\nentitled to; however, for its own convenience the Union sought to make one-\ntime payment choosing not to make out any further payouts. The situation\nimproved, when in 1996 various elements apart from the pay alone were\nincluded for calculation of the lump sum amounts. However, the status of\nSFF retirees as those entitled to treatment similar to Army personnel\ncontinued. The new scheme is only an improvement, if viewed from this\nperspective, because it enlarges and extends the benefits - much like the\n1996 memorandum and includes a whole series of other monetary elements.\nBesides, the mode of payout (from lump sum to monthly pension) is\nchanged. However, the essential parity of status and entitlement based on\nthat status, continues.
