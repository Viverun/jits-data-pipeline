(A) No. 4419 of 2024\n\nIn Re:- An application for anticipatory bail under Section\n482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita in connection\nwith Panrui Police Station Case No. 119 of 2024 dated\n30.07.2024 under\nSections 420\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n120B\n/\n\n498A\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code.\nAnd\nIn Re : Sekh Mosgul @ Sk. Nosgul ..... petitioner\n\nMr. Sabir Ahmed\nMr. Golam Karim Chowdhury\nMr. Tasnim Ahmed\nMr. Dhiman Banerjee\nMr. Quazi Ezaz Ahmed\n.....for the petitioner\n\nMr. Debasish Roy, learned PP\nMr. Arijit Ganguly\nMr. Koushik Kundu\n....for the State\n\n1.\nHeard the learned Counsels for the parties.\n\n2. We have considered the materials on record.\n\nPresent case arose out of a matrimonial discord. Allegation of\n\ntorture is general and omnibus. Allegation of forgery relates to\n\ntransfer of the de facto complainant's property in favour of the\n\npetitioner by an alleged forged deed. Forged deed is in the\n\ncontrol and custody of the investigating agency. Custodial\n\ninterrogation for progress of investigation is not necessary but\n\npetitioner requires to co-operate with investigation in\n\naccordance with law. Accordingly, we are inclined to grant\n\nanticipatory bail to the petitioner but subject to condition.\n\nSigned By :\n\nSHANTANU DAS\nHigh Court of\nCalcutta\n18 th of\nDecember 2024\n03:08:26 PM\n3. Accordingly, we direct that in the event of arrest the\n\npetitioner shall be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of\n\nRs.10,000/-, with two sureties of like amount each, to the\n\nsatisfaction of the arresting officer and also be subject to the\n\nconditions as laid down under\nSection 482(2)\nof the Bharatiya\n\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita and on condition that he shall\n\nappear before the jurisdictional court and pray for regular bail\n\nwithin a period of four weeks from date and on further\n\ncondition that he shall meet the investigating officer once in a\n\nweek until further orders and shall provide his specimen\n\nsignature and hand-writing, if necessary.\n\n4. The application for anticipatory bail is, thus, allowed.\n\n(Gaurang Kanth, J.) (Joymalya Bagchi, J.)\n\nSigned By :\n\nSHANTANU DAS\nHigh Court of\nCalcutta\n18 th of\nDecember 2024\n03:08:26 PM",
