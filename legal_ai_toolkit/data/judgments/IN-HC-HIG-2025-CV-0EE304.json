Singh, learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral of India assisted by Mr. Ram Tujabh Singh, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners and Mr. Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In\n\nperson) for the sole respondent.\n\n2. The present writ petition has been filed for\n\nchallenging the order dated 04.01.2024 passed in OA No.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n2/14\n\n050/00505 of 2019 by which the learned Central Administrative\n\nTribunal has been directed to the respondent's promotion to the\n\npost of Executive Engineer should be regularized w.e.f. 30.11.2010\n\nthe date on which he was given the current duty charge of that post\n\nas he held that post continuously till regular promotion. Apart from\n\nthe aforesaid, the learned Central Administrative Tribunal also\n\ndirected the petitioners to issue order of promotion to the post of\n\nExecutive Engineer w.e.f. 30.11.2010 with all consequential\n\nbenefits within three months from the date of this order.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\nrespondent herein was appointed as Assistant Engineer in the Civil\n\nConstruction Wing of All India Radio on 19.12.1990 and was\n\ngranted financial up-gradation to Grade Pay of Rs. 6600/- w.e.f.\n\n18.12.2002\nvide order dated 27.04.2005. Respondent was given\n\ncurrent duty charge of the post of Executive Engineer w.e.f.\n\n30.11.2010. The grade pay for the post of Executive Engineer was\n\nRs. 6600/-, so there was no financial enhancement in the pay scale\n\nfor the current duty charge. The respondent was conferred second\n\nMACP with Grade Pay of Rs. 7600/- vide order dated 18.12.2020.\n\n4. The respondent was promoted after regular\n\nDepartmental Proceeding Committee (DPC) to the post of\n\nExecutive Engineer vide order dated 25.02.2020.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n3/14\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\nrespondent's case was before Central Administrative Tribunal\n\n(hereinafter referred as \"CAT\") that respondent was eligible for\n\npromotion to the post of Executive Engineer after completing eight\n\n(08) years regular service on the post of Assistant Engineer. For\n\nthe promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer, the\n\neligibility of five (05) years on the post of Executive Engineer.\n\nThe respondent pleaded before the learned CAT that he was\n\ngranted only one substantive promotion in the last 30 years of his\n\nservice. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from\n\nperusal of letter dated 30.11.2010 by which the respondent was\n\nofficiating to the post of Executive Engineer (Current Duty\n\nCharge). The said appointment letter clearly indicates that such\n\nappointment will not entitle for any monetary benefit or claim to\n\nseniority. The private respondent was ultimately promoted to the\n\npost of Executive Engineer by order dated 25.02.2020 after the\n\nrecommendation of DPC. The delay in process by the DPC for the\n\nappointment of Executive Engineer was due to a SLP No. 35912-\n\n35913 of 2010 was pending before the Hon'ble Apex Court with\n\nrespect to seniority matter and the Hon'ble Apex Court had\n\ngranted an interim order of status quo by order dated 17.01.2011.\n\nThe said status quo was vacated by the Hon'ble Apex Court by\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n4/14\n\norder dated 19.08.2015. Thereafter, the matter was kept pending\n\nin the Hon'ble Apex Court and ultimately the same was disposed\n\nof by order dated 18.01.2017. After disposal of the aforesaid SLP,\n\nthe seniority list was prepared by the authority concerned.\n\nUltimately, the said seniority list was also subject to challenge\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Apex Court in M.A. No. 2220-2221 of 2018\n\nand the same was finally disposed of vide order dated 17.02.2020\n\nthereafter the respondent has been given to the promotion vide\n\norder dated 25.02.2020. Learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nsubmits that from the aforesaid, it transpired that due to multiple\n\nlitigation, the DPC could not take place for the period of last 10\n\nyears. Learned Additional Solicitor General of India brought to our\n\nnotice Office Memorandum dated 10th April, 1989 where the\n\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions Department\n\nof Personnel and Training had formulated a guidelines which\n\nwould govern the promotion/appointment of such persons to the\n\npost in question. He has relied upon Para 6.4.4 and Para 17.10 and\n\nPara 17.11 which is reproduced hereinbelow :-\n\n\"6.4.4 - While promotions will be made in the order of\n\nthe consolidated select list, such promotions will have\n\nonly prospective effect even in cases where the\n\nvacancies relate to earlier year(s).\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n5/14\n\n17.10- The general principle is that promotion of\n\nofficers included in the panel would be regular from the\n\ndate of validity of the panel or the date of their actual\n\npromotion whichever is later.\n\n17.11- In cases where the recommendations for\n\npromotion are made by the DPC presided over by a\n\nMember of the UPSC and such recommendations do not\n\nrequire to be approved by the Commission, the date of\n\nCommission's letter forwarding fair copes of the minutes\n\nduly signed by the Chairman of the DPC or the date of\n\nthe actual promotion of the officers, whichever is later,\n\nshould be reckoned as the date of regular promotion of\n\nthe officer. In cases where the Commission's approval is\n\nalso required the date of UPSC's letter communicating\n\nits approval or the date of actual promotion of the\n\nofficer whichever is later will be the relevant date. In all\n\nother cases the date on which promotion will be effective\n\nwill be the date on which the officer was actually\n\npromoted or the date of the meeting of the DPC\n\nwhichever is later. Where the meeting of the DPC\n\nextends over more than one day the last date on which\n\nthe DPC extends over more than one day the last date\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n6/14\n\non which the DPC met shall be recorded as the date of\n\nmeeting of the DPC.\n\nAppointment to posts falling within the purview of ACC\n\ncan, however, be treated as regular only from the date of\n\napproval of ACC or actual promotion whichever later\n\nexcept in particular cases where the ACC approves\n\nappointments from some other date\".\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from\n\nperusal of the aforesaid guidelines, it is made clear that no such\n\nappointment/promotion could have been made effect with a\n\nretrospective date, only a prospective promotion/appointment\n\nwould have been made. Learned counsel for the petitioners further\n\nrelied upon a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nGovernment of West Bengal and Others Vs. Dr. Amal Satpathi and\n\nOthers\n, reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3512, Paragraph\n\nNos. 19 and 20 of\nthe said judgment\nwhich is reproduced\n\nhereinbelow:\n\n\"19. It is a well settled principle that promotion becomes\neffective from the date it is granted, rather than from the\ndate a vacancy arises or the post is created. While the\nCourts have recognized the right to be considered for\npromotion as not only a statutory right but also a\nfundamental right, there is no fundamental right to the\npromotion itself.\nIn this regard, we may gainfully refer to\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n7/14\n\na recent decision of this Court in the case of\nBihar State\nElectricity Board v. Dharamdeo Das\n, wherein it was\nobserved as follows:\n\n\"18. It is no longer res integra that a promotion\nis effective from the date it is granted and not\nfrom the date when a vacancy occurs on the\nsubject post or when the post itself is created. No\ndoubt, a right to be considered for promotion has\nbeen treated by courts not just as a statutory\nright but as a fundamental right, at the same\ntime, there is no fundamental right to promotion\nitself.\nIn this context, we may profitably cite a\nrecent decision in\nAjay Kumar Shukla v. Arvind\nRai\nwhere, citing earlier precedents in\nDirector,\nLift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. v. Pravat Kiran\nMohanty\nand\nAjit Singh v. State of Punjab\n, a\nthree-Judge Bench observed thus:\n\n41. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis\non right to be considered for promotion to be a\nfundamental right, as was held by K. Ramaswamy,\nJ., in\nDirector, Lift Irrigation Corpn. Ltd. v. Pravat\nKiran Mohanty\nin para 4 of the report which is\nreproduced below:\n\n'4....... There is no fundamental right to\npromotion, but an employee has only right to be\nconsidered for promotion, when it arises, in\naccordance with relevant rules. From this\nperspective in our view the conclusion of the High\nCourt that the gradation list prepared by the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n8/14\n\ncorporation is in violation of the right of\nrespondent-writ petitioner to equality enshrined\nunder\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution, and the respondent-writ petitioner\nwas unjustly denied of the same is obviously\nunjustified.'\n\n42. A Constitution Bench in\nAjit Singh v. State of Punjab\n,\nlaying emphasis on\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle 16(1)\nof the\nConstitution of India held that if a person who satisfies\nthe eligibility and the criteria for promotion but still is\nnot considered for promotion, then there will be clear\nviolation of his/her's fundamental right. Jagannadha\nRao, J. speaking for himself and Anand, C.J.,\nVenkataswami, Pattanaik, Kurdukar, JJ., observed the\nsame as follows in paras 22 and 27:\n\n'Articles 14 and 16(1) : is right to be considered for\npromotion a fundamental right\n\n22.\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle 16(1)\nare closely\nconnected. They deal with individual rights of the\nperson.\nArticle 14\ndemands that the 'State shall\nnot deny to any person equality before the law or\nthe equal protection of the laws'.\nArticle 16(1)\n\nissues a positive command that:\n\n'there shall be equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters relating to employment or\nappointment to any office under the State'.\nIt has been held repeatedly by this Court that\nclause (1) of\nArticle 16\nis a facet of\nArticle 14\nand\nthat it takes its roots from\nArticle 14.\nThe said\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n9/14\n\nclause particularises the generality in\nArticle 14\n\nand identifies, in a constitutional sense \"equality\nof opportunity\" in matters of employment and\nappointment to any office under the State. The\nword \"employment\" being wider, there is no\ndispute that it takes within its fold, the aspect of\npromotions to posts above the stage of initial level\nof recruitment.\nArticle 16 (1)\nprovides to every\nemployee otherwise eligible for promotion or who\ncomes within the zone of consideration, a\nfundamental right to be \"considered\" for\npromotion. Equal opportunity here means the\nright to be \"considered\" for promotion. If a\nperson satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but\nis not considered for promotion, then there will be\na clear infraction of his fundamental right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion, which is his personal\nright. \"Promotion\" based on equal opportunity\nand seniority attached to such promotion are\nfacets of fundamental right under\nArticle 16(1).\n\n* * *\n\n27.\nIn our opinion, the above view expressed in\n\nAshok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State\nof U.P.\n, and followed in\nJagdish Lal [Jagdish Lal\nv. State of Haryana\n, and other cases, if it is\nintended to lay down that the right guaranteed to\nemployees for being \"considered\" for promotion\naccording to relevant rules of recruitment by\npromotion (i.e. whether on the basis of seniority or\nmerit) is only a statutory right and not a\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n10/14\n\nfundamental right, we cannot accept the\nproposition.\n\nWe have already stated earlier that\nthe right to equal opportunity in the matter of\npromotion in the sense of a right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion is indeed a\nfundamental right guaranteed under\nArticle 16(1)\n\nand this has never been doubted in any other case\nbefore\nAshok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar Gupta\nv. State of U.P.\n], right from 1950.'\n\"20.\n\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath\n, it was\nheld that retrospective seniority cannot be given to an\nemployee from a date when he was not even borne in the\ncadre, nor can seniority be given with retrospective effect\nas that might adversely affect others.\n\nThe same view was\nreiterated in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India\n,\nwhere it was held that when a quota is provided for, then\nthe seniority of the employee would be reckoned from the\ndate when the vacancy arises in the quota and not from\nany anterior date of promotion or subsequent date of\nconfirmation.\n\nThe said view was restated in\nUttaranchal\nForest Rangers' Assn. (Direct Recruit) v. State of U.P.\n, in\nthe following words:\n\n'37. We are also of the view that no retrospective\npromotion or seniority can be granted from a date\nwhen an employee has not even been borne in the\ncadre so as to adversely affect the direct recruits\nappointed validly in the meantime, as decided by\nthis Court in\nKeshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of\nIndia\nheld that when promotion is outside the\nquota, seniority would be reckoned from the date\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n11/14\n\nof the vacancy within the quota rendering the\nprevious service fortuitous. The previous\npromotion would be regular only from the date of\nthe vacancy within the quota and seniority shall\nbe counted from that date and not from the date of\nhis earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation.\nIn order to do justice to the promotes, it would not\nbe proper to do injustice to the direct recruits......\n\n38. This Court has consistently held that no\nretrospective promotion can be granted nor can\nany seniority be given on retrospective basis\nfrom a date when an employee has not even\nbeen borne in the cadre particularly when this\nwould adversely affect the direct recruits who\nhave been appointed validity in the meantime.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n20. In the instant case, it is evident that while respondent\nNo. 1 was recommended for promotion before his\nretirement, he could not assume the duties of the Chief\nScientific Officer. Rule 54(1)(a) of the West Bengal\nService Rules, clearly stipulates that an employee must\nassume the responsibilities of a higher post to draw the\ncorresponding pay, thus, preventing posthumous or\nretrospective promotions in the absence of an enabling\nprovision\".\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that it is\n\nnot in dispute that the respondent was given the officiating charge\n\n(Current Duty Charge) of Executive Engineer, the said\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n12/14\n\nappointment letter itself indicates that the respondent could not\n\nhave made claim for any monetary benefit or seniority on the basis\n\nof the said appointment. The said appointment letter was issued in\n\nthe year 2010 in favour of respondent and the respondent was\n\nnever challenged the aforesaid letter and now he has not claimed\n\nthe promotion on retrospective effect.\n\n8. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Kumar, who has appeared in\n\nperson submits that it is not in dispute that the respondent was not\n\neligible for the promotion to the post in question. The petitioners\n\nhave denied the promotion to the respondent solely on the ground\n\nthat the status quo was maintained by the Hon'ble Apex Court on\n\nthe sole ground that the petitioners could not hold DPC. Mr.\n\nVishwa Mohan Kumar further submits that after the status quo\n\norder dated 17.01.2011 the petitioners conducted DPC and issued\n\nPromotion Order No. 7/2011-BA (E) dated 24.10.2011 and issued\n\nposting order to certain officials. Further submits that the status\n\nquo was modified by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated\n\n19.08.2015 where the Hon'ble Apex Court held that \"We modify\n\nthe interim order and permit the Union of India to make the\n\npromotions to the post of Executive Engineer. However, we make\n\nit clear that the promotions will be subject to the outcome of this\n\nappeal\". Apart from the aforesaid, the petitioners could have\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n13/14\n\nconducted the DPC immediately after the modification of status\n\nquo order by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 19.08.2015.\nThe\n\nindefinite 10 years long period of Current Duty Charge ratified in\n\nthe regular promotion on 25.02.2020. Further submits that\n\nrespondent was neither a party in the said SLP nor his eligibility or\n\nhis position in Direct Recruit slot was to get affected. The\n\nappointment was made on Current Duty Charge according to Rule\n\nof FR 49, Current Duty Charge is a stop gap arrangement for a\n\nvery short duration only. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Mumar also relied\n\nupon a decision in the case of\nK Madhavan and Another Vs. Union\n\nof India\n, reported in (1987) 4 SCC 566 held that with a view to\n\nensure that miscarriage of justice does not occur, promotion should\n\nbe deemed to have taken effect retrospectively from the\n\ncommencement of the so called ad hoc stop gap and current duty\n\ncharge, provided the incumbent concerned fulfilled the essential\n\ncriteria for consideration for promotion on the initial date.\n\n9. We have heard both the parties at length and this\n\nCourt has come to the conclusion that due to statue quo granted by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apect Court in SLP No. 35912-35913 of 2010 the\n\npetitioners had not held the DPC for the promotion of the\n\nrespondents in question and apart from the aforesaid in the recent\n\njudgment as mentioned aforesaid by the petitioners in the case of\nPatna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025\n\n14/14\n\nGovernment of West Bengal and Others\n(supra) which suggests\n\nthat the promotion only becomes effective upon the assumption of\n\nduties on the promotional post and not on the date of occurrence of\n\nthe vacancy or the date of recommendation.\n\n10. As a result of the above discussion, the\n\njudgment/order dated 04.01.2024 passed in O.A. No.\n\n050/00505/2019 is hereby set aside.\n\n11. The writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.\n\n12. Pending application (s), if any, shall stand disposed\n\nof.\n\n(Sudhir Singh, J)\n\nI agree.\n\nIbrar//- ( Rajesh Kumar Verma, J)\nAFR/NAFR NAFR\nCAV DATE 04.09.2025\nUploading Date 15.10.2025\nTransmission Date N.A.",
