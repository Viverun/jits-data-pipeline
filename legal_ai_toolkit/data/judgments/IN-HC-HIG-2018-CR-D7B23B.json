No.2186/18, an application, under\nsection 301(2)\nof the\nCr.P.C, is considered and allowed.\n\nThis is first application under\nsection 438\nof the Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\nApplicant apprehends arrest in connection with Crime\nNo.14/2018 registered at Police Station Karera, District Shivpuri, for the\noffence punishable under sections 304B read with 34 of the\nIPC\n.\n\nAllegations against the applicant, in short, are that he being\nhusband of Faujiya was involved in subjecting her to cruelty and\nharassment due to non satisfaction of demand for dowry and, ultimately,\nFaujiya died on 13/12/17 of brain infarction.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant has\nbeen falsely implicated in the case. Marriage of applicant was\nsolemnized with Faujiya on 12/4/13. She was sick since prior to her\nmarriage and after marriage her treatment was carried out by the\napplicant and his family members only. She has not lodged any\ncomplaint against anyone. She was also suffering from paralysis.\nHowever, from 14/7/16, Faujiya had been residing with her parents and\nhas died on 13/12/17 at her parental home only. Earlier on 20/9/16,\nfather of Faujiya had registered a case under\nsection 498A\nof the IPC\nagainst the applicant and other family members. On 29/8/16 and\n16/9/16, father of the applicant and applicant respectively had informed\nthe Police about being threatened by parents of the deceased of being\nroped in a false case. An application under\nsection 125\nof the Cr.P.C.\nwas also moved by father of the deceased, wherein he has specifically\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\nM.Cr.C.No.10191/2018\n\n(\nMujib Ahmad Khan Vs. State of M.P\n.)\n\n(2)\n\nmentioned Faujiya to be suffering from TB and Paraylsis. It is submitted\nthat as per post moretm report, Faujiya has died due to brain infarction.\nAs she was residing with her parents for last more than 15 months,\ntherefore, ingredients of section 304B are not attracted to the fact\nsituation in hand. There is no direct or indirect involvement of the\napplicant in the crime. Applicant is a permanent resident of Shivpuri and\nthere is no likelihood of his absconsion. With the aforesaid\nsubmissions, prayer for anticipatory bail is made.\n\nIn response, learned Public Prosecutor and learned counsel for\nthe complainant have opposed the bail application and pray for its\nrejection. They submit that applicant, being the husband, is the main\naccused. Besides, he is absconding and that is the reason why\ninvestigation is not being completed. It is submitted that the applicant\nwas involved in harassing the deceased for non fulfillment of dowry, in\nwhich regard a complaint was also lodged. Not being able to withstand\nthe harassment, Faujiya fell ill and ultimately was taken by her parents\nfor treatment. However, finally she succumbed. It is submitted that\napplicant being the husband, his case cannot be said to be at par with\nthat of his father who has been extended the benefit of anticipatory bail\nin M.CrC. No.5894/18 vide order dated 27/2/18 inter alia considering his\nold age. Under such circumstances, it is submitted that no indulgence is\nwarranted.\n\nTaking into consideration the overall facts and circumstances, of\nthe case, but without expressing any opinion on the merits thereof, in\nthe opinon of this Court, no case for grant of anticipatory bail is made\nout.\n\nThe application, accordingly, stands dismissed.\n\n(S.A.Dharmadhikari)\nJudge\n(and)\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nANAND SHRIVASTAVA\n\nDate: 2018.03.22\n\n17:01:04 +05'30'",
