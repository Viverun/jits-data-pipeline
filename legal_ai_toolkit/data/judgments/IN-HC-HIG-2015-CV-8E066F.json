The private complaint filed by the complainant-\n\nDr.Subramanian Swamy, President, Janatha Party, No.1,\n\nPapanasam Sivan Salai, Mylapore, Madras-600 004, in\n\nCriminal Case No.3238 of 1996, against Ms.J.Jayalalitha,\n\nFormer Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, 36, Poes Garden,\n\nMadras - 600 086, under\nSection 200\nCr.P.C. alleging\n\noffence punishable under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988, reads as under:\n\"The complainant above named states as\n\nfollows:-\n\n1. The Complainant is in active\npolitical life, having been a Member of\nParliament for four terms, and a Senior\nCabinet Minister in the Union Ministry holding\nthe portfolios of Commerce, Law and Justice.\nHe is the President of the Janatha Party, a\nNational party recognized by the Election\nCommission of India.\n\n2. The complainant has been taking a\nconsistent and serious interest in eliminating\ncorruption from public life. Alarmed at the\nhigh degree of corruption and misuse of power\nand abuse of power for achieving the goal for\naccumulating wealth to the level of \"Everest\"\nthat has been taking place in the state of Tamil\nNadu, the complainant is taking all steps to\ncurb if not to eliminate in this State, which is\nhis home State of Tamil Nadu.\n\n3. The accused Ms. J Jayalalitha has\nbecome the Chief Minister on 24.06.1991. The\nwhole of Tamil Nadu expected good and able\nadministration, but their hope vanished since\nthe accused Ms. J Jayalalitha instead of\ngoverning the State for the welfare of the\npeople at large jointed in league with others\nand in particular her accomplice and partner in\nbusiness Ms. Sasikala, have collaborated,\ncolluded and conspired to amass wealth, both\nmoveable and immovable in the State of Tamil\nNadu as well as abroad using her position and\npower as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for\nwhich Ms. Sasikala has functioned as an extra\n- constitutional authority. The Complainant is\nconfining his complaint against the former\nChief Minister alone since she was a public\nservant under the provisions of\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act, 1988\nfor offences committed\nby her under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\nSection 13(1)(e)\nreads thus:\n\n\"13. CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT BY A\nPUBLIC SERVANT:-\n(1) a public servant is said to commit the\noffence of criminal misconduct....\n(e) if he or any person on his behalf, is in\npossession or has, at anytime during the\nperiod of his office, been in possession for\nwhich the public servant cannot satisfactorily\naccount of pecuniary resources or property\ndisproportionate to his known sources of\nincome.\"\n\n4. The complainant states that\naccording to the evidence he has collected\nfrom various sources including through\nParliament by putting question and getting\nauthoritative answers from the Government,\nthe accused person has committed the offence\nand is guilty and warrants prosecution.\n\n5. The complainant states that Ms. J\nJayalalitha was a public servant within the\nmeaning of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act,\n. Having coming to know about the non-\nfiling of Income-tax returns for years and the\nIncome Tax Department sleeping over this, as\na Member of Parliament filed an 'Unstarred\nquestion No.2309 seeking an answer from the\nRajya Sabha on 8.12.1992. As soon as the\nquestion was filed, the accused some-how\ncame to know that the subject matter of that\nquestion relates to her Income-tax\nimmediately rushed to file her tax returns for\nthree years running on the same day, i.e.\n20.11.1992. Subsequently, the complainant\nwas surprised from the answer given to him in\nthe Rajya Sabha to his 'Unstarred question\nNo.57, on 23.2.1993. The answer revealed\nthat:-\nHer Wealth during 1989-90 was ZERO\nHer Wealth during 1990-91 was Rs.1.89 Crores\nHer Wealth during 1991-92 was Rs.2.60 Crores\nHer Wealth during 1992-93 was Rs.5.82 Crores\nAnd subsequent investigation by the\n\nComplainant revealed that:\n\nHer Wealth during 1993-94 was Rs.21.33\nCrores; and\nHer Wealth during 1994-95 was Rs.38.21\nCrores\n\nIt is a known fact that the accused was\nreceiving Re.1/-(One Rupee only) as her salary\nas Chief Minister. Adding her grape garden\nproduce in Hyderabad the rise in wealth to an\nunimaginable and even un-dreamable by more\nthan 21 times in her declared wealth from\nRs.1.89 Crores to Rs.38.21 Crores between\n1990-91 and 1994-95 is wholly incredible.\nUpon my insistence, the Income-Tax\nDepartment issued notices under\nSection\n143(3)\nof the Income-Tax Act and under\n\nSection 16(3)\nof the Wealth Tax Act asking her\nto explain her prima facie incredible\nassessment.\n\n6. The complainant is not listing all\nthe illegal acquisitions in this complaint but\nunder the law it will suffice if the admitted\nincome of the public servant, the accused Ms. J\nJayalalitha, and the assets which are acquired\nby the said public servant subsequent to her\nassuming the public office are not\ncommensurate.\n\n7. The first acquisition of immovable\nproperty immediately after assuming power as\nthe Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was 1.1407\nground of vacant urban land abutting her Poes\ngarden, building (No.36, Poes Garden)\ncomprised in plot No.31-A, comprised in\nR.S.No.1567/63, Mylapore Division, Block\nNo.31 of Mylapore-Triplicane Taluk on\n22.7.1991 for Rs.8,00,000/- (Rupees eight\nlakhs only) through the value of the property\neven a according to the guideline value is\nRs.45 lakhs. Even 8 lakhs of rupees was paid\nby way of cheques drawn on 3 different banks\nincluding one at Hyderabad which proves her\nfinancial status and the debits in the various\nbank accounts in her name at the particular\ntime:\n\nRs.1,00,000/- (SB Account No.5158,\nBank of Madurai, Anna Nagar Branch, Madras).\n(What are the reasons for operating a SB\nAccount at Anna Nagar, far away from Poes\nGarden). Rs.4,00,000/- SB Account No.23832,\nCanara Bank, Mylapore. Rs.3,00,000/- SB\nAccount No.20614 Central Bank of India,\nsecunderabad.\n8. The complainant further states that\nthe accused person J.Jayalalitha had shown\n'NIL' income and 'NIL' wealth since 1985-86\nwho had ceased to be a film actress since\n1979, and according to the evidence collected\nby him, she had to depend on others for her\nday to day living. But that such a person is\nnow in a position to declare her wealth in\n1994-95 as Rs.38.21 Crores (though this\namount is negligible as against the true state\nof affairs).\n\n9. The complainant states that Ms.\nJ.Jayalalitha had to depend on the Indian\nBank, Abhiramapuram Branch for paying the\nsale consideration to the Government for\nhaving purchased the TANSI LAND. The\nexecution of General Power of Attorney\nauthorising her business partner Sasikala to\nexecute the necessary loan documents, getting\nthe loan sanctioned the same day and the\nissue of drafts in favour of the Government\nsimultaneously within ONE DAY speaks about\nthe abuse of state authority in this regard,\nforcing the Bank Authorities to grant loan to\nthe tune of crores on the security of the\nproperty proposed to be purchased which is\nunknown in the history of administration of\nbanks.\n10. The complainant states that in a\nnumber of cases, the Supreme Court has laid\nthat \"known sources of income\" must be taken\nto mean \"Sources known to the complainant\",\nand not sources know to the public servant.\nBesides, once cognizance is taken of the\ncomplaint, the prosecution has to only show\nthat the accused or some person on her behalf\nis in possession of pecuniary resources for\nwhich the public servant or the said some\nother person cannot satisfactorily account for\nand once that is established, it is the duty of\nthe court to presume that the accused is guilty,\nunless the accused proves the contrary. The\nonus thus shifts to the accused.\n\n11. The complainant states that the\naccused person stopped acting in cinema films\nand other films in 1979, long before she\nbecame the Chief Minister in June 1991. After\nshe had become the Chief Minister in June\n1991, she has been drawing a salary of Re.1/-\nonly as her monthly salary. She is said to\nhave an orchard at Hyderabad out of which she\ndoes not appear to have derived any income\ntherefrom prior to 1990-91 as is evident from\nthe non-submissions of her income-tax return\nmakes one to conform that she had no income\neven from the Orchard said to have been\nowned by her. Though repeated here again\nshe had to depend on other for her livelihood\nas evidenced form the letters written by her\nown hand her wealth was declared as ZERO in\n1989-90, therefore on her own declaration,\nhere income from the Orchard at Hyderabad\ncould be taken as 'negligible' if not zero, as not\nto require payment of tax upto 1989-90.\n\n12. The complainant states that is this\nback-ground her subsequent declarations of\nwealth and income for succeeding years,\nconfirmed in answer to a Parliament Question\nare astounding and are as follows:-\n\nYear Incomedeclared taxable/Agriculture Wealth Declared\n\n1990-91 86,860/8,00,000 1.89 Crores\n1991-92 4,48,660/9,00,000 2.60 Crores\n1992-93 6,64,530/9,50,000 5.82 Crores\n\n(Source:1990-91 to 1992-93: Rajya Sabha\nunstarred question No.57, answered on\n23.2.1993).\n\n13. It is surpasses anyones'\nimagination as to how and swelling such a\nsteep increase of wealth and income would be\npossible for a person who is supposed to be\nreceiving Re.1/- only as her monthly salary.\nHer non-reply to the notices issued under\n\nsection 143(2)\nof Income-tax Act and under\n\nsection 16(2)\nof the Wealth Tax Act speaks for\nitself and confirms the view that she had no\nanswer for such a seeping level of income and\nvalue of wealth. Further, the rush filing of\nincome/wealth returns for the assessment\nyears 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 on\n20.11.1992, 2.11.1992 and 23.11.1992\nrespectively is one stroke immediately on my\nfiling Unstarred Question No.3274 (and\nAnswered on 15.12.1994) having perhaps\ncoming to know in advance of the Parliament's\nquestion which requires 2 weeks' notice to the\nParliament Secretariat, proves the deliberate\nattempts made by her to suppress her income\nfrom tax. But for the complainant's raising this\nissue in parliament, this would not have come\nto light.\n14. The complainant further states that\nthough she is getting a salary of Re.1/- per\nmonth, she had been giving donations in her\nown name to the \"needy\" and giving publicity\nto the same at the Government Cost. A list of\nsuch donations is enclosed.\n\n15. The complainant further states that\nMs.N.Sasikala is said to be the aid of the\naccused and described as 'unborn sister', she is\nthe wife of Mr.Natarajan, who hailed from a\nlower middle class agricultural family, and who\nwas in Government Service from 1976 to 1991\nin the Information Department. He was once\nremoved from services and reinstated without\nback wages and their only source of income\nwas the salary which he had been receiving\nduring the said aid period. The accused person\nMs.J.Jayalalitha in league with Ms.Sasikala and\nher close relatives have accumulated\nproperties and began to purchase properties\nafter properties which are prestigious and\nassets given below are only a very negligible\npart of the total ill gotten wealth and\nproperties acquired by the accused person as\nwell as her business partner Sasikala and her\nrelatives and even these are totally\nincompatible with the known sources of income\nof the accused Ms.Jayalalitha and Sasikala and\nher relatives. The following details have been\ngathered and collected from published sources\nin the media. Items 1 and 2 below are\nadmitted.\n\na. The Capital and investment of M/s\nJaya Publications which is about Rs.30 Crores\nincluding the purchase of TANSI LAND for\nwhich Rs.182 Crores have been paid and a\nsum of Rs.26.55 Lakhs paid as stamp duty.\n\nb. J. Jay TV Pvt. Ltd. and the\nassociate Super Duper TV Ltd. of capital of\nRs.100 Crores.\nc. M/s. Sasi Enterprises situated at\nNo.14, Ground Floor, Parsn Manare, 602, Anna\nSalai, Ms.Jayalalitha is a partner.\n\nd. Brahadeeswara Hospital in\nThanjavur estimated to be more than Rupees\nOne Crore purchased by Late Dr.Vinodhagan,\nbrother of Ms.Sasikala.\n\ne. A luxury wedding hall (marriage\nhall) comprising of 25000 square feet at\nThiruthuraipoondi belonging to Ms.Sasikala\nworth more than rupees one crore.\n\nf. Purchase of \"Divan Bungalow\" at\nMannargudi along with land measuring more\nthan 25000 square feet worth several lakhs of\nrupees.\n\ng. \"Tamil Arasi Press\", Tamil Arasi\nMaligai, Madras 18, owned by Mr.Natarajan,\nhusband of Sasikala.\n\nh. Sengamala Women's College under\nconstruction on 10 acres of land in\nSundarakottai at an estimated cost of Rs.3\nCrores.\n\ni. Ramraj Agro-rice and oil extraction\nplant in Tiruvarur reported to have been sold\nby a liquor baron.\nj. M/s J.S.Housing Development -A\nreal estate company started by Ms.Sasikala\nand 5 others which has purchased a property\nin Mylapore worth Rs.54 lakhs.\n\nk. A bungalow in Trichy purchased by\nMr.Vivekanandan, and a bungalow in T.Nagar,\nMadras purchased by his brother\nMr.Sundaravadanam both are close relatives of\nSasikala.\n\nl. Purchase of land measuring 1.1407\ngrounds near 36, Poes Garden, Chief\nMinister's-residence for Rs.8 lakhs (real value\nRs.45 lakhs).\n\nMore evidence of other acquisitions may\nbe collected by this Hon'ble Court ordering an\ninvestigation.\n\nThe above are only some of the known\nillegal acquisition of wealth and assets by the\nformer Chief Minister and accused Ms. J.\nJayalalitha and her own people acting as her\nbenami. According to the provisions of\nSection\n13(1)(e)\n, if he/she or any person on his/her\nbehalf is liable for punishment. In the case of\nacquisition of the above and other properties,\nthough stands in some other persons' name,\nbut in reality it belongs to the accused person\nand therefore liable for punishment.\n16. The complainant has thus\nestablished a prima facie case against the\naccused person Ms. J. Jayalalitha, the former\nChief Minister of Tamil Nadu for offences\ncommitted by her under the provisions of\n\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof the prevention of\n\nCorruption Act\n.\n\n17. The complainant states that\naccording to the provisions of the\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act\n, for taking cognizance of\noffences under the\nPrevention of Corruption\nAct\nagainst Public Servants, the Chief Minister\nof Tamil Nadu, sanction of the Governor of\nTamil Nadu is necessary. But since the\naccused ceased to be the public servant and\nthe offences committed by her were during the\nperiod when she was a public servant the\nsanction of the Governor is not necessary.\n\n18. The complainant therefore prays\nthat this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to take\ncognizance of this complaint privately filed by\nthe complainant against the accused for\noffences committed by her under the\nprovisions of\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof the\nPrevention of Corruption Act and render\njustice.\nMadras:\nDated: COMPLAINANT\"\nLIST OF WITNESSES OF BEHALF OF PROSECUTION:\n\n1.

A2\ncontinued to live with A1 at No.36, Poes\nGarden, Chennai-86 till the year 1996.\n\n3) A3 is the son of A2's elder sister Tmt.\nV. Vanithamani and Tr. T. T. Vivekanandan. He\ncame to reside at No.36, Poes Garden,\nChennai-86 in the year 1992 while pursuing his\nstudies at New College, Chennai, and stayed\nthere till the first quarter of 1997. A1 had\nacknowledged and proclaimed A3 as her\n\"foster son\" and had conducted the latter's\nmarriage with one Tmt. Sathiyalakshmi at\nChennai on 07.09.1995 on a very lavish scale.\n\n4) A4 is the wife of late Tr. V.\nJayaraman, the elder brother of A2. The said\nTr. V. Jayaraman was a Govt. Servant in the\nCivil Supplies Dept. and died in December\n1991 due to electrocution while attending to\nworks in the Grape Garden of A1 at\nHyderabad. Following her husband's death, A4\ncame to live at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-\n86 from the beginning of 1992.\n\n5) A1 is the daughter of late Tmt. N.R.\nSandhya who was acting in films during the\n1960s. A1 was also acting in films during\n1964-72. Tmt. N.R. Sandhya died in the year\n1971, and as per her Will dated 01.11.1971,\nshe bequeathed her shares to A1 in the\nproperties belonging to Natyakala Niketana in\nwhich both were partners. At the time of her\nmother's death A1 came to own the following\nproperties namely:-\n\ni)Land and Building at No.36, Poes\nGarden, Chennai-86\n\nii) House at Plot No.36, Door\nNo.8/3/1099, Srinagar Officers' Colony,\nHyderabad City.\niii) Lands totally measuring 10.20 acres\nin S.No.52 and S.No.50 of Jeedi Metla Village\nand S. No.93/1 of Pet Basheerabad Village,\nMetchal Taluk, Ranga Reddy District, Andhra\nPradesh with Grape Garden, Farm House and\nServants Quarters.\n\niv) Land in Survey No.93/2 to the extent\nof 3.15 acres in Pet Basheerabad Village (A.P.).\n\n6) The assets which were in the\npossession of A1 upto 1987 are found to be\nworth only about Rs.7.5 Lakhs as per details\ngiven below:\ni) The four items of properties listed in\npara-5 above;\nii) Agricultural land 3.43 Acres in Cheyyur\nTaluk, now in Anna Dist (as per Doc.\nNo.4564/81 dated 16.12.1981 of SRO North\nMadras)\niii) Anold Ambassador car and an old Contessa\nCar\niv) A new Maruthi Car TMA 2466 worth\nRs.60,435/-\nv) Company shares\n\nShe claimed to have possessed balances\nin her bank accounts to the extent of about\nRs.1 lakh, in addition to jewels during the year\n1987.\n7)Though A1 had floated three business\nfirms viz., i) M/s. Jaya Publicaitons, ii) Namadu\nM.G.R. and iii) M/s. Sasi Enterprises in the\nyear 1988-90, with A2 and others as her\npartners, these firms did not generate any\nincome. However, between 13.05.1988 and\n27.01.1989, when she was Member of\nParliament, A1 had purchased four motor cars\nworth Rs.9,12,129/- and on 13.02.1989, she\npurchased a Jeep worth Rs.1,04,000/- after\nshe had become a Member of the Tamil Nadu\nLegislative Assembly. Thus during the period\nwhen she was a Member of Parliament and\nlater as a Member of Legislative Assembly, she\nis found to have been acquiring and possessing\npecuniary resources and properties which were\nnot commensurate with her known sources of\nincome.\n\n8) The check period for this case has\nbeen set out as 01.07.1991 to 30.04.1996\nwhen A1 held office as Chief Minister of Tamil\nNadu. As on 01.07.1991, A1 is found to have\nbeen in possession of the properties and\npecuniary resources in her name and in the\nname of A2 (Tmt. N. Sasikala), who was living\nwith A1 at 36, Poes Garden, Chennai, to the\nextent of Rs.2,01,83,957/-. These includes\nproperties acquired in the name of M/s. Jaya\nPublications, M/s. Sasi Enterprises and\nNamadu M.G.R. which had been floated by A1\nand A2 with themselves as partners. The\ndetails of the properties are as listed in\nAnnexur-1 hereto.\n\n9) After 01.07.1991, the acquiring of\nassets by A1 had gathered momentum, and\nduring this period, A3 and A4 also came to live\nwith A1 and A2, at No.36, Poes Garden,\nChennai-86, which is also the official residence\nof A1 as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. During\nthis period, A1 and A2 together are found to\nhave floated several firms in the names of A2,\nA3 and A4 namely:\n\ni) M/s. J. Farm Houses\nii) M/s. J.S. Housing Development\niii) M/s. Jay Real Estate\niv) M/s Jaya Contractors and Builders\nv) M/s J.S.Leasing and Maintenance\nvi) M/s Green Farm Houses\nvii) M/s Metal King\nviii) M/S Super Duper TV (P) Ltd.,\nix) M/s. Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd.,\nx) M/s Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd.,\nxi) M/s Signora Business Enterprises (P) Ltd.,\nxii) M/s Lex Property Development (P) Ltd.,\nxiii) M/s Riverway Agro Products (P) Ltd.,\nxiv) M/s Meadow Agro Farms (P) Ltd., and\nxv) Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals\nLtd.,\nxvi) M/s A.P.Advertising Services,\nxvii) M/s Vigneswara Builders,\nxviii) M/s Lakshmi Constructions,\nxix) M/s Gopal Promoters\nxx) M/s Sakthi Constructions,\nxxi) M/s Namasivaya Housing Development,\nxxii) M/s Ayyappa Property Developments,\nxxiii) M/s Sea Enclave\nxxiv) M/s Navasakthi Contractors and Builders\nxxv) M/s Oceanic Constructions\nxxvi) M/s Green Garden Apartments\nxxvii) Marble Marvels\nxxviii) Vinod Video Vision\nxxix) Fax Universal\nxxx) Fresh Mushrooms,\nxxxi) M/s Super Duper T.V.and\nxxxii) M/s Kodanadu Tea Estate,\n\nIn respect of many of these firms, during\nthe above period, there was no business\nactivity at all, and in respect of the others, the\nactivities were more in the nature of acquiring\nassets like lands, machinery, buildings etc.,\nand were not production oriented. No Income\nTax Returns were filed by these firms. No\nassessment for Commercial Tax had also been\ndone with respect to the businesses of these\nfirms as the firms had not filed their returns.\nA1 also had not filed her Income Tax Returns\nfor Assessment Years 1987-88 to 1992-93 till\nNovember 1992. When this issue was sought\nto be raised in Parliament, A1 filed the Income\nTax Returns suddenly for the above periods in\nNovember 1992.\n\n10) Subsequent to 1.7.1991, assets in\nthe form of movable and immovable properties\nand pecuniary resources like bank deposits,\netc., are found acquired not only in the name\nof A.1 but also in the names of A2, A3 and A4\nand the firms floated in their names. Scrutiny\nof the various bank accounts maintained in the\nnames of A1 to A4 and in the names of\ndifferent firms discloses that huge credits in\ncash had been frequently made into various\naccounts which were not commensurate with\nthe income of the individuals and of the firms\nconcerned. There were also frequent transfers\nof amounts between one account to the others\nto facilitate illegal acquisition of assets. The\nhuge quantum of such assets, when viewed\nalong with the facts that A1 was holding the\noffice of the Chief Minister and that A2, A3 and\nA4 were living under the same roof with A1\nand not having sufficient means to acquire the\nassets in their names established that the\nassets were actually acquired by A.1. Thus A1\nwhile she was a public servant had been in\npossession of pecuniary resources and\nproperties which are disproportionate to her\nknown source of income, which would\nconstitute the offence of criminal misconduct\nas described in\nSec.13(1) (e)\nof Prevention of\nCorruption Act 1988, and A2, A3 and A4\nfacilitated A1 to commit the said offence.\n\n11) There was thus a criminal\nconspiracy between A.1 a public Servant and\nher associates, viz., A2, A3 and A4, to acquire\nand posses properties and pecuniary resources\nby A1 in her name and in the names of A2, A3\nand A4 and in the names of the various firms\nfloated by them which are beyond the known\nsources of income of A1. Further, A2, A3 and\nA4 had, pursuant to the said conspiracy, held\nthe said properties and pecuniary resources in\ntheir names, and in the names of the firms\nfloated by them, on behalf of A1. Pursuant to\nthe said criminal conspiracy, properties,\nexpensive jewellery, etc., and pecuniary\nresources were acquired by A1 in her name\nand in the names of A2, A3 and A4 and in the\nname of various firms. As on 30-4-96, the\nassets thus acquired and possessed by A1 are\nfound to be worth Rs.66,44,73,573/- as set out\nin Annexure II hereto. These include the\nassets already with A.1 as on 1-7-1991 (as set\nout in Annexure-I hereto). Hence, the\nquantum of assets acquired by A1 in her name\nand in the names of A2, A3 and A4 and the\nfirms floated by them during the period\n01.07.1991 to 30.04.1996 has been worked\nout as Rs.64,42,89,616/- (as set out in\nAnnexure-V hereto).\n\n12) The incomes from the known\nsources of A1 during the period from 01-07-\n1991 to 30-04-1996 (hereinafter referred to as\nthe check period) such as rental incomes,\ninterest derived from various bank deposits\nand other deposits held by her in her name\nand in the names of A2, A3 and A4,\nagricultural income, loans taken and A.1's\nsalary as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu were\ncomputed. For the purpose of computation,\nthe incomes of A2, A3 and A4 were also taken\ninto account. All these work out to a total of\nRs.9,34,26,054/- only (as set out in Annexure-\nIII hereto). The expenditure of A1 during the\naforementioned check period, including\nrepayments of principal amount and interest\non loans taken, amounts remitted to\nCorporation of Chennai, MMDA and other\nauthorities, payment to various firms and\nindividuals through cheques, expenditure on\nthe marriage of A3, etc., were also assessed.\nThe total expenditure for the above period has\nbeen assessed as Rs.11,56,56,833/- (as set\nout in Annexure-IV hereto). Thus, there was\nan excess of expenditure over income during\nthe check period to the extent of\nRs.2,22,30,779/-(vide Annexure-VI hereto).\n\n13) As on 30-04-1996, A1 a public\nservant, is thus found to have acquired and\npossessed pecuniary resources and properties,\nin her name and in the names of A2, A3 and\nA4 and the firms floated by them, which were\ndisproportionate to her known source of\nincome to the extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/-\n(Annexure-VII hereto), for which she has failed\nto account satisfactory. A2, A3 and A4, by\nholding a substantial portion of the said assets\non behalf of A1, had intentionally aided A1 and\nwere parties to the criminal conspiracy with\nher.\n\n14) (i) Thus, during the period between\n01-07-1991 and 30-04-1996, at Chennai and\nother places, A.1 being the Chief Minister of\nTamil Nadu and a public servant, and A2, A3\nand A4, were parties to a criminal conspiracy,\nhaving agreed among themselves to commit\nthe offence of possession by A1 of pecuniary\nresources and properties in her name and in\nthe names of A2, A3 and A4 and the firms\nfloated by them, which were disproportionate\nto the known sources of income of A1 and for\nwhich she has failed to account and A2, A3 and\nA4 abetting A1, in the commission of the said\nacts by agreeing to hold the properties in their\nnames on behalf of A1 and thereby A1 to A4\ncommitted an offence punishable under\n\nSection 120-B\nIndian Penal Code read with\n\nSection 13(2)\nread with\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof\nthe Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 (Central\nAct 49/1988).\n\n14) (ii) In pursuance of the said\ncriminal conspiracy and in the course of the\nsame transaction, during the said period, at\nChennai and other places, A.1, being a public\nservant committed the offence of criminal\nmisconduct by acquiring and possessing in her\nname and in the names of A2, A3 and A4 and\nin the names of the firms floated by them,\npecuniary resources and properties which\ndisproportionate of A1's known sources of\nincome to the extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/- and\nfor which she had not satisfactorily accounted\nand thereby A1 committed an offence\npunishable under\nSection 13(2)\nread with\n13(1)(e) of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n\n1988 (Central Act 49 of 1988).\n\n14) (iii) In pursuance of the said\ncriminal conspiracy and in the course of the\nsame transaction, during the said period, A2,\nA3 and A4 abetted A1 in the commission of the\nsaid offence of criminal misconduct by allowing\nA1 to acquire a substantial portion of the\nproperties and pecuniary resources in their\nnames and by holding such properties and\npecuniary resources on behalf of A1 which are\ndisproportionate to the known sources of\nincome of A1 and for which A1 had failed to\nsatisfactorily account and thereby A2, A3 and\nA4 committed an offence punishable under\nsection 109 Indian penal Code read with\n\nsection 13(2)\nread with\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof\nPrevention of Corruption Act 1988 (Central Act\n49 of 1988).\n\n15) This Final Report (Charge Sheet) is\nbeing filed subject to the Provision of\nSection\n173(8)\nCr.P.C.\n16) Sanction accorded by Governor of\nTamil Nadu and issued in G.O.Ms.No.614,\nPublic (SC Department dated 02.06.1997 to\nprosecute A-1 in the Court of Law is enclosed.\nEncl: Annexures I to VII\n\nSd/-\n\nSuperintendent of Police\nVigilance & Anti Corruption,\nSpecial Investigation\nChennai-600 035\"\n5.

In Ex.P.822 there is no signature\nfound in the papers from 11 to 15, Likewise in page 17,\nPages from 19 to 41, Pages 43 to 45, Pages 47 to 60,\nPages 63 to 74, Pages 77 to 84, Page 87, Pages 89 to 91,\nPage 93, Pages 95 to 121, Pages 123 to 129, Page 131,\nPages 133 to 145, Pages 147 to 161, Pages 163 to 180,\nPages 183 to 185, Page 187, Pages 189 to 216, Pages 219\nto 223.\n\nIn Ex.P.822, he has estimated a total of Rs.10 lakhs\nfor water supply and sanitary ware. For this, he has\ncalculated 7.59 of the total value. The length and width of\nthe tapes were not given because the taps were fixed in\nthe wall. They have not measured the length and breadth\nof tapes which were visible. The number of sanitary ware\nwas also not mentioned. Ex.P.822 in page 207, he has\ncalculated Rs.2 for each screw and fixed Rs.8/- for 4\nscrews. For 4 wood plugs fixed in the wall, he has\nestimated Rs.8/-. That is made of teak wood. He has put\nRs.250/- for a mirror of 1 ½ feet height and 2 feet length.\nThis is the price in the year 1994. He has put Rs.150/- for\ntowel rod. In Ex.P.822, the tabular form 2 to 8 in page\n274 is written in pen and the others in carbon. The rate of\nelectrical fittings were also fixed at the rate of the PWD.\nThe wires having different gauge measurements were\nused. He has considered the PWD rate for each wire.\nExcept out 4 engineers they have not taken any other\npersons for inspection. The guest house which he has\nmentioned in the 1st examination is the guest room in the\n1st floor. When he was working there, he has seen the\nbuildings constructed during 1995-96. When he went that\nside. Ex.P.822 he has mentioned the year of constructing\nthat building. While construction, he has not gone and\nseen them personally. With local enquiry and his\nexperience he has mentioned the age of the buildings in\nEx.P.822. The local enquiry was not taken in writing by\nthe concerned persons. He does not know that the hours\nof the enquired persons, fathers name, age and address.\nHe has not taken anything in writing from the village\nofficers.\n\nLike that, he has not taken anything in writing from\neither the P.D.O. Officer or Panchayat Board President.\nEx.P.822 did not have the details about who has seen\nwhich building, took measurement for assessment. The\nletter came from the Chief Engineer is X-20 (This letter\nwas taken from the file brought by the accused and\nnotified as X-20)\n\nAs per X-20, 2 groups were formed to assess. The\nother group did not inspect the buildings inspected by\nthem. They inspected the other buildings. The letter X-20\ndid not have the details which group should inspect which\nbuildings. It is mentioned that if any delay in this will be\nviewed seriously. On 23.11.96, he received the letter X-\n20. 4 or 5 days after receiving the letter, they started the\ninspection. If the letter X-20 would not have come, he\nwould not have done the above mentioned work. As\nmentioned in X-20 letter, he went and saw the Police\nAdditional Superintendent Mr. Shanmuga Velanelli. He\nonly told us to prepare the assessment for these buildings\nafter inspection. The Group-I prepared the assessment\nreport or few buildings in Tanjore. He did this work on 'On\nduty'. They received T.A. and D.A. from the Government.\nThe above work is not only 'on duty' but also 'special duty'.\nThe PWD has a separate subordinate service rules. It is\nwrong to say that as per the police instruction, he has\nassessed at for more value and prepared the report\nEx.P.822 and that the values found in Ex.P.822 is not a\nreal value.\n\nEx.P.822, pages 247 was prepared before the\ninformation came from the Electrical Engineer. After\nreceiving the reports, column 2 to 8 items were written in\npen. After assessing each item, it is signed in the last\npage of the report.\n\nDuring the cross-examination, he has stated that in\nEx.P.822 the assessment date is not mentioned. After\nassessment, the report was sent within 3 months. They\nhave not seen the approved plan for the assessed\nbuildings. For the purpose of the assessment they have\nprepared a model plan, keeping in mind the floor.\nThis model plan will not have side wall, elevation\ndoor and the measurements of the windows. On the 1st\nday of assessment, they came to know about the details of\nbuildings. On the 2nd day they took the measurements for\nabout 2 hours and assessed the buildings. 3rd day also\nthey took 2 hours. 3rd day they took the measurements\nand they fixed the amount of assessment at the office. On\n3.2.97, they fixed assessment rate in the report and sent\nthat report on 4.2.97 during our assessment time, no\nother individuals were with them. But inspector\nRangarajan from Tanjore was with them. No police\nofficers from Chennai were there. They did not assess\neither, through test in laboratory or through scientific\nmethods. The order for the assessment is also not\nsubmitted. The Chief Engineer sent a letter to send the\nassessment report on 7.1.97 to them. The assistant\nEngineer Rajaram who has come with them to assess the\nelectrical work was the junior most engineers from his\ndepartment. The assessment made by the electrical\nengineer should be approved by his higher officer after\nverification. But in Ex.P.822, the report was neither\nverified nor approved by the higher officer of the electrical\nengineer. Their engineers had neither the right to assess\nnor value the electrical works. They have not mentioned\nthe name and the details of the persons who were\nenquired to find out the date of construction of those\nbuildings. The people whom they enquired told them\ndifferent values. Our assessment report was prepared on\nthe basis of information received from outsiders. The\ninspected buildings might have been constructed before\n1991 also. The new buildings which they inspected were\nincomplete and these new constructions might have been\nconstructed a few months before our inspection. The PWD\nprice assessment list is not enclosed with Ex.P.\nThey have not differentiated and assessed in\nEx.P.822 whether it is under price list or not. The\nEx.P.822 did not have the details of how and from which\nplace, and in which shop, the prices were found out. The\nprice was not prepared as per the open market price list.\nThe price of the things cannot be permanent. If the year\nof construction differed, the assessment rate also would\ndiffer. In Ex.P.822, the amount of wear and tear is not\nmentioned. During their inspection, the compound wall\nwas not constructed completely. As the steel things could\nnot be weighed, they have assessed those on their\nassumption. If the owner of the building, personally,\npurchased the things, 25% of expense will be lesser than\ntheir assessed amount.\n\nEven if it is said that the 1st item in Ex.P.822 was\nbuilt in the year 1991-92, this might have been\nconstructed in 1989-90. Like that the items 2 and 3 found\nin Ex.P.822 would have been constructed, 2 or 3 months\nbefore their inspection.\n\nDuring their inspection, they have taken the notes of\nproceedings in 1 quire note book, about 100 pages. But\nthe note book was not enclosed in their report. The plan,\nthe design preparation and the amount for supervision\nmentioned in their report is also on their assumption. The\ndrinking water connections were not seen outside.\nRegarding this drinking water connection also they have\nfixed the value on their assumption. In the same way the\nsanitary items were also assessed. They have not\ncalculated the total length and total measurement of pipes\nfor water connection. The steel pipes were also assessed\non assumption. The police did not enquire and take his\ndeposition. Though, he has signed regarding the electrical\nworks, he was not responsible for its assessment.\n\nPW-153 was recalled and re-examined by the learned\nSpecial Public Prosecutor and questions were posed as\nunder:\n\nQ: In your examination in chief you have given the year of\nconstruction of building 1991-92, 1994-95 and 1995-96\nbut, in your cross-examination dated 24.12.2002 you have\nstated that. Even if it stated that the first item in Ex.P.822\nwas built in the year 1991-92, this might have been\nconstructed in 1989-90. Like that the items 2 and 3 found\nin Ex.P822 would have been constructed 2 or 3 months\nbefore our inspection\". Among the two versions which one\nis the correct?\nA: The earlier version i.e. which is stated in my\nexamination in chief is correct.\n\nQ: In 2000 October the deposition recorded read over\nthen accepted it as correct and signed it likewise in 2002\nalso your deposition was read over by the court you\naccepted as correct then signed it?\nA: During the first examination i.e. in the year 2000 my\ndeposition has been read over accordingly I accepted it as\ncorrect and signed it but, so far as the deposition in the\nyear 2002 is concerned I was not permitted to go through\nthe deposition, I was asked to sign the same in the\npresence of the learned counsel for the accused.\nIt is not correct to say today on account of\ncompulsion I have given such evidence.\n\nPW.154 -Kamal Batcha.

Firstly, he took charge as\nAssistant Chief Registrar, North Chennai, District Registrar\nOffice. North Chennai Registrar Office has power to\nregister the documents from all the States except Jammu\n& Kashmir. In North Chennai District, six Sub-Registrars\nworked under him. The Administration and Documentation\npower was given to him as an Assistant Chief Registrar of\nthe District. Jayaraman spoke to him over telephone and\nasked him to come to the house of the then Chief Minister.\nAccordingly, he went there. He has registered the\ndocuments in favour of J.Elavarasi, V.N.Sudhakaran and\nSasikala.\nHe has further deposed that his higher officer is Iyer.\nHe was DIG Registration in the year 1994. He directed\nhim to discharge the duties within the framework of law.\nAccordingly, he discharged his duties. He has visited the\nPoes Garden nearly 20-25 times with regard to registration\nof documents. He has further deposed that he contacted\nSiva - Real Estate Agent over phone. He told in\nThirunelveli about 200 acres of red soil land was available\nfor sale, the interested person can approach. Siva told\nhim that the lands are in Cheerakulam and Vellakulam,\nthen he enquired about the details of the price. He told\nhim that per acre the price was from Rs.4,000/- to\nRs.5,000/- according to the land. The documents\nregistered were through the Power of Attorney Holder.\nSome of the documents were registered in the name of the\nCompany and some were registered in the name of the\npersons. The document registered in the name of the\ncompany does not indicate from which Bank, the sale\nconsideration amount was drawn. From which Bank, the\npurchaser has taken the draft. Sometimes representative\nnames were there. Most of the documents which he\nregistered are related to the companies. He has not\nregistered the documents illegally. If the conditions are\ncorrect and if the valuation is according to the guidelines,\nthen only he registered. For doing registration, there is\nno need for the purchaser to come to the Registration\nOffice. Sometimes, without the knowledge of the\npurchaser, there are chances for registration of the land.\nThird accused has not come to their registration office\nonce.\n\nThe deposition of this witness runs to about 100\npages.

Geology. He has been appointed\nas an assessor for Income Tax Department and Central\nFinance Department. He has been an assessor since 1975.\n\nFor the first time 3 years ago police met him\nregarding this case Police enquired him about the purchase\nof jewellery of Selvi Jayalalitha and her people and also\nabout the types of jewellery and when these were\npurchased from our company. They enquired him at office\nof the Prevention and Corruption Department. He was\ncalled office and gone to there approximately 10 times of\nenquiry. They called him 10 times to Prevention of\nCorruption without issuing a notice. He asked them about\nthis to them. Still they did not issue any notice to him.\nDuring those enquiry they forced him to sign on written\npapers for which he refused. During those enquiry police\nasked him for 10 years of receipt books of his company.\nInspite of protesting that those books do not contain\nreceipts regarding sale of jewellery to Selvi Jayalalitha they\nseized them. Police seized approximately 300 receipt\nbooks from their company and they returned it back\napproximately after 1 year. He does not know that either\nto read and write Tamil but he knew to speak Tamil. When\npolice enquired him Nallamma Naidu reduced everything.\nHe stated into writing and secured his signature. The\ndetails which he stated were true details. Generally when\nthey assessed a jewel they would assess it on the basis of\nthe value prevalent on those days. Gold and Silver price is\ndetermined on day to day basis. Once a year the\ndiamond's price would vary. They maintain a record of a\ngold and silver's listed price since 1965 in their company.\nThe value of gold and silver is increasing but not\ndecreasing. The year of purchase of gold cannot be\ndetermined by merely seeing the gold jewellery and the\nsame is applicable to silver wear and diamond jewellery. If\nthey continuously wear gold jewellery there is a chance of\nvery less depreciation. There is a less possibility for wear\nand tear. This condition will be applicable to gold chain\ngold ring and gold bangles also. There is no chance for\nwear and tear for the jewellery if there is no rubbing. In\n1960 one sovereign gold's price was approximately\nRs.100/-. In 1970 one sovereign gold was approximately\nRs.120/-. Likewise cost of every sovereign prevailed at\neach year can be found out. In the same way they can\nfind out the value of silver and diamond also. If the\njewellery is used with great care and caution and used\noccasionally it will retain its shine and there will be no\nwear and tear. There will be not even a minute\ndepreciation. They cannot determine accurate weight of\nstone studded and they could not determine the exact\nweight of gold and stones separately.\nHe did not give the documents relating to Ex.P1010\nto Ex.P1016 to the Prevention of Corruption Department\nPolice. After he evaluates the jewels in Ex.P1010 to\nEx.P1016. On the dates mentioned in the documents,\nwhile tendering evidence in this case he did not examine\nEx.P703 with reference to assessment report. He has not\nseen Ex.P703 so far. Further while he was tendering\nevidence in the court he was not shown any jewels. When\nNallamma Naidu recorded his statement they did not ask\nhim to compare the assessment report Exs.P1010 to\nP1016 with Ex.P703 and asked him to take statement.\nFurther without seeing the jewels and pursuing the details\nmentioned in Ex.P703 he cannot state whether they\ninclude in the assessment report. Generally gold's\nstandard cannot be fairly determined by merely looking at\nit. Its standard can be assessed only approximately.\nGenerally while assessing gold's standard it will not be\nrubbed with Touch stone thereafter treating the stone with\nacid. This process is adopted only if they have suspicion.\nSelvi Jayalalitha has never contacted us telephonically and\ntold regarding purchase of jewellery. He did not make his\nstatement that Selvi Jayalalitha has contacted them\ntelephonically. Further nobody said to present Selvi\nJayalalitha telephonically contacted them regarding\npurchase of jewellery and they did not come to their\nestablishment on the basis of talk and purchased any\njewels. As either Selvi Jayalalitha or her representatives\nmade any purchases of jewellery in their shop question of\nasking or giving receipt does not arise. During the\nexamination in Chief he has stated in his evidence that he\nmade Diamond Ottiyanam for Tmt.Sasikala on receipt\ndiamonds from Tmt.Sasikala on the basis of instructions of\npolice. But she did not sendthem 250 diamonds and gold\nfor making ottiyanam. Further during the course of the\nexamination Chief he has stated that after making\nottiyanam and received making charges only under the\ncompulsion of police. As they did not make ottiyanam\nquestion of handing it over to Tmt.Sasikala did not arise.\nHe does not know that how to read Tamil hence without\nreading the examination in Chief he has signed. A\ndiamond stone can be out to have 57 facets. If the\ndiamond is having less than 57 facets then its value is less.\nTill few years ago Belgium cut diamonds were costlier than\nIndian cut diamonds. Weighing standard for diamond is\nthe carat which is equivalent to 100 cent. Diamond's price\ndepends on its weight in carats. There is a concept called\nThosham relating to diamonds. Thosham painted Diamond\ncosts less. It takes some time to assess the diamond\nstudded with jewels. It will take atleast 20 minutes to\nevaluate a diamond relating its facets, thosham, clarity\nand weight.\n\nDiamonds studded with jewels will be evaluated\nregarding its facets and weight without removing from the\njewels. However, those assessments will be approximate.\nThe value of gold jewel depends on the basis of its design.\nAssessment of jewellery varies from person to person.\nDesign of the jewellery will not be assessed separately.\nStrict test is touch stone test but experienced persons can\nassess gold without subjecting it to the test. The value\nshown for Exs.P1010 to P1016 were the value shown on\nthe day of assessment. To determine the quality of\ndiamond there are fine cutting and medium cutting\nmethods. If it is a fine cutting it will not be less than 57\nfacets, it is less than 57 facets it is medium cutting. To\nmeasure the weight of diamond there is a separate\nweighing scale and to measure the weight of gold there is\na separate weighing scale. The diamond studded gold\njewels will have more of gold than the diamond in terms of\nweight. The diamond studded gold jewellery will be\nweighed in toto and the approximate weight will be\nassigned to gold and diamond. Some shops in Chennai sell\ngold jewels less than estimation price. The fluctuating\nprices of gold day to day applicable to only new jewellery\nand not applicable to old jewellery and applies to silver and\ndiamond also. The old gold jewels value in terms of cost\nwould depend on jewels model purchasers standard,\nsellers emergency. All the gold smiths would not come\nforward to buy old gold jewels. The jewels relating to\nExs.P1010 to P1016 shows only approximate weight of\ngold and diamond. But in Ex.P698 and 698 approximate\nweight of gold and diamond is not shown. The diamond\njewelleries, is price cannot be determined without knowing\nthe exact weight of gold and diamond. Silver and gold's\nglobal price is determined in London and for India it is in\nMumbai. So far as diamond is concerned its global price is\ndetermined in Belgium and for India it is determined in\nMumbai and diamond is measured in terms of carat which\nis equal to 100 cent or 100 points.\nCross-examination A1, A2 and A4 is adopted.\nThis witness was recalled and re-examined by the\nlearned Special Public Prosecutor and questions were posed\nas under:\n\nQ: In your examination in chief you have given details with\nregard to valuation of jewellery done by you is true and\ncorrect?\nA: YES. It is true and it is out of my free will.\n\nValue of diamonds, value of golden jewellery pattern\nof jewellery, stoned studded, Diamond studded jewellery\nand their value, Belgium cut diamond, Indian cut\ndiamonds, facets carats in that respect he has been asked\nin his cross-examination, based on quality and carats he\nhas given in his cross-examination. Those details have not\nbeen mentioned in his reports. But he has taken those\ndetails into consideration. The details are not mentioned\nin the reports.\n\nPW.180 - M. Sukhila, Manager, IVIKTEK Pvt.

Already, he has taken\ncare of the Poes Garden house, that is why he knew that is\nthe camp office. He has taken care of the electrical devices\nin the said house. That Poes Garden house comes under\nthe jurisdiction of the Asst. Executive Engineer. So, he has\ntaken care of the electrical devices in that house. That\nhouse is a private property and it is not a government\nproperty. In his office, he was having the documents for\nthe maintenance but at present it is not with him. He has\ntaken care of the electrical devices in that house in 1995-\n96. The house comes in their office jurisdiction and\nbecause of this, he was saying that he has taken care of\nthat house. He does not know that how many years old\nthat house is? At that time, the Door No.31-A, Poes\nGarden house was under construction. He does not know\nthat when they did the wiring for the old house. The value\nof the electrical devices goes with the brand of the\nelectrical devices and usage of the articles. He has got his\nB.E. Degree in Electrical and Electronics in the year 1973\nin PSG college of Technology, Kovai. In his Degree\ncertificate, it is written as B.E. Electrical and Electronics.\nThe witness is telling that in his Degree certificate, it has\nbeen written as only B.E. Electrical and not as Electronics.\nThe Television and Antenna are the Electronics related\ndevices like diesel engines are related to mechanical side.\nDuring his inspection, he has marked 129 items in No.36,\nPoes Garden House. He did not go to the enquiry to the\nhouse that the house belonged. For this, he did not verify\nthe registered document. In his report, Ex.P.2152, he did\nnot mention in whose name the electrical connections is\nthere in No.36 Poes Garden house. In his estimate, his\nreport Ex.P.2152 was not attached. In Ex.P.2152 the date\nof his inspection was not mentioned. It is not mentioned in\nEx.P.2152 who all did the inspection and who were all\npresent at the time of the inspection. Out of 129 items, for\n30 items only they have mentioned the brand name. The\n128 and 129 items were pump sets. For that, the brand\nname was not mentioned. The item 108 is diesel\ngenerator. For that, he put Rs.6,55,000/- as the value\nrate, but he did not mention the brand name. For that also\nhe did not mention the brand name. When they are taking\nthe note, they won't value the value the articles. After\nverifying the rates in the market, they have prepared the\nvalue assessment list, they put the present market rate for\nthe items 1 to 129 when they prepared the report i.e.\nNovember 1996, market rate value. They did not verify the\nrates with the rates in writing. For the electrical devices\nthe wear and tear will 5 to 10 percent for a year in their\nPublic Works Department. After a particular period if they\ndeduct the wear and tear value for the electrical devices, it\nwill come to zero (0). The discount for the wear and tear\nfor the electrical devices were not given to any articles in\ntheir above mentioned reports. For each electrical device if\nhe calculate the years of the usage and give the discount\nfor the wear and tear, his valuation will differ. He does not\nknow that the discounting for the wear and tear for the\nelectrical devices in the income-tax department. He does\nnot know that the discounting for the wear and tear of the\nelectrical devices in property tax department. When they\nprepared the above mentioned four reports, they did not\nkeep any public with them. When they inspect, they did\nnot take any member of the public with them. He does not\nknow that there is any government approved value for\nvaluing the electrical devices and Surveyors. He does not\nknow that whether his higher officers sent his four reports\nto any private valuers for verification. To the best of his\nknowledge, he did not send it.\n\nPW-220 was recalled and re-examined by the learned\nSpecial Public Prosecutor and questions were posed as\nunder:\nQuestion: In your reports have you mentioned\nwhich of the electrical devices are in working condition and\nwhich are out of order?\nAnswer: I valued only those devices which were\nin working condition.\nThe item Nos.130 to 204 electrical devices was\nmentioned under the heading \"New Multi Stage Building\".\nThe address of the building was not mentioned.\n\nQuestion: Did you come to know who is the owner\nof the building after seeing the documents?\n\nAnswer: After seeing the documents of the\nelectrical service connection. I came to know who the\nowner of the new building was. Apart from the service\nconnection document, I did not see any other document to\nknow the owner of the new buildings. In my value report\nEx.P.2152, I did not write who is the owner of the new\nbuilding. The Public Works Department does not give the\nelectrical connections. Only the Tamil Nadu Electricity\nBoard can give electrical connections. The service\nconnection documents will be with the Electricity Board. I\ndid not go the Electricity Board and I did not give any\npermission letter to go through the documents. In\nEx.P.2152 I did not mention the number of the service\nconnections. In Ex.P.2152 I mentioned the brand names\nfor 17 items. Out of items 130 to 204, item 185 was\nvalued at Rs.2,98,900/-. I did not mention the parts of\nthe items, but mentioned it as one set. I did not mention\nwith whom I made enquiries to arrive at this value. The\nitem 187 is not an Indian make. Too arrive at the value of\nthe item. I did not mention in any report with whom I\nmade enquiries. The Ex.P.2152 was divided into 4 parts\nand then valued. In the Ex.P.2152, I did not mention with\nwhom I enquired for the prices of the items, which are\nmentioned in 4 parts. For items 273 to prepare a plan, to\nmake the design estimate and the supervision expenses, I\ncalculate 9 per cent and put the amount at Rs.8,69,045/-,\nbut I did not see any plan and the estimated design. I do\nnot know who supervised the said one. The calculation as\n9 per cent that I mentioned is a figure accepted by the\nPWD. I have added this amount on the basis of the idea\nthat this normally occurs when a building is constructed.\nIn Ex.P.662 the above mentioned 9 per cent amount was\nadded. The amount was also added on the same opinion\n(in page 2 for the 24th item, I added the building value).\nThe value is Rs.10,39,633/-. In Ex.P.663, the amount 9\nper cent was not added. In Ex.P.661, the amount of per\ncent was not added. In Ex.P.2152 age of items 130 to 204\nhas not been mentioned. For these, I did not mention the\nwear and tear also. In the camp office heading, the items\nwere 205 to 260. Out of this, I mentioned the brand\nnames only for 15 items. I did not mention in my report\nwith whom I enquired for the price details. I did not\nmention how old the items are and the wear and tear also.\nFor the rates of the articles, I took the price value in\nNovember and December 1996 into account. Of the items\n261 to 272 in the 4th group, I gave the brand names for 4\nitems only. Dish antenna belongs to the group of\nelectronic items. The above items come under electrical\nand electronic good. I know about the electronic devices.\nI did not take any electronics experts with me, but in the\nPublic Works Department there are Engineers qualified in\nElectronics and upto the level of Asst. Executive Engineers.\nTo know the prices of the electronic articles. It is in\nEx.P.661, 661, 663 and 2152. I did not take the help of\nour Public Works Department Electronics Engineers for the\nprices of the items in four documents. I have taken into\naccount the PWD rates in November and December, 1996.\nI have not mentioned in my report about the places I\nvisited and the people I met and find out the prices of the\nitems. I have not mentioned how old the items are in the\nfour documents. In the same way I have not given the\nwear and tear discount yearly. I have not written\nspecifically if all the items in the four documents were in\nworking condition, but all are in working condition only.\nFor all the electrical devices, the prices vary according to\nthe brands. In the same way labour charges vary for the\nlifting of the items. The police did not enquire me. I did\nnot valuing because my team leader instructed me to do\nso. I do not know why he asked me, I am in the habit or\nreading Tamil news papers. I came to know through the\nnews papers about the disproportionate wealth acquired by\nthe 1st accused, the Ex.Chief Minister. When we were\ndoing the valuation, the police were with us. Then only I\ndid know that they were with us for this case. I know the\nreports were needed for this case only. In Ex.P.2152 the\ndate of submission of the report is not mentioned. The\nEx.P.2152 report was given to Thiru.Jayapal, the\nAdministrative Engineer in December, 1996. In Ex.P.2152\nmy Asst.Engineer Selvaraj and I signed on the report. In\nthat, there is no signature of my higher officer Thiru.Jaypal\nor other signatures. But, the Ex.P. 661 to 663 documents\nhave my higher officers signature the Ex.P.2152 was filed\nin the Court in 2000. I gave Ex.P.2152 to Jayapal. I do\nnot know what he did with it. It is not correct to say that I\ndid not prepare the Ex.P.2152 and to say that the police\nprepared the report for this case and took my signature is\nnot correct. Likewise, it is not correct to say that Ex.P.611\nto 663 documents were prepared by the police and that\nthey took my signature. It is not correct to say that I have\nquoted inflated prices for the items mentioned in 4\ndocuments. It is not correct to say that the items and\ndevices I have mentioned are not there. It is not correct\nto say that I have not gone to the markets and not\nenquired the rates. It is not correct to say that I have\ngone by the instructions of the police to help the present\ngovernment, as I am a government servant and giving\nevidence against Jayalalitha. It is not correct to say that\nthe electrical devices prices were high in that report as\ninstructed by the police and it is wrong to say that I put\nonly my signature.\nIn the cross-examination, he has deposed that above\nhis post is the post of the Electrical Engineer, above him is\nthe Electrical Department Superintending Engineer post\nand above him the Building and Electrical Department,\nChief Engineer's post. There are rules in the Tamil Nadu\nPublic Works Department to govern our functioning. A\nvaluation of Rs.15,000/- and above has to be valued by\nthe Electrical Engineer on his higher official. When he\nassessed the Electrical devices regarding this case\nproperty, he was not holding the post of an Electrical\nEngineer. At that time, Selvaraj worked under him. On\nthat date, Parthasarathy was the Electrical Engineer. He\ndid not take part in the valuation process of the electrical\ndevices of the buildings regarding the case. In Ex.P.661,\nthe people also have signed on it are Swarnam,\nShivalingam, Shankar and Senthil Kumar. All of whom are\nthe Civil Division Engineers. He does not know that what\nwork those Civil Engineers did at Sinthavur Farm house.\nLike that, the above Civil Engineers are not aware the work\nthey did in the house regarding electrical devices. When\nthey inspected the electrical devices, they prepared a\nproceedings note which runs into five or six pages. In\neach pages, there are 10 to 15 entries. The proceedings\nnote is not in the Court. He gave it Sournam. After that\nhe did not see that anywhere. Only with the help of the\nproceedings notes he can give the correct total amount.\nAfter verifying to that only he can tell what all devices he\ninspected. He does not remember the total amount. He\ndoes not know that who is the owner of the Ciruthavur\nhouse is which they inspected and when they inspected the\nhouse, the house owner or people on his behalf were not\npresent. There are many bungalows in Ciruthavur of which\none they inspected is not mentioned in X21. Using the\ngrand total they cannot give the details of the electrical\ndevices and the prices. The details of the time duration\nthey spent in the Ciruthavur Farm are not mentioned in\nEx.P.661. Their department value guideline was not\nattached in Ex.P.661 to Ex.P.662 and Ex.P.21 and 22.\nRegarding the electrical devices in the Ciruthavur Farm\nhouse, they prepared a model plan, but they did not attach\nit to, Ex.P.661. In Ex.P.662 the date of the inspection was\nnot mentioned specifically. Those who signed on X21 did\nnot mention the dates below their signatures. The dates\nwere not mentioned on pages of Ex.P.661. They do not\nknow on which date Ex.P.661 was sent to the police. For\nEx.P.662 the rate preparing in November, 1996 have been\ntaken into account. It is not mentioned in Ex.P.662 when\nthose electrical devices were fixed. It is not possible that\nthese devices may have been fixed a few weeks before\nthey inspected. They did not mention in their report\nwhether the wires and devices were of good standard or\nnot. They have noted the fans and tube lights as 'fixtures'.\nThose details were not there in their report. If they had\nmentioned in their report about the standard and the\nnumber of the devices, they would have know the correct\nprices. In their report, they took the market value for the\narticles while preparing the report. It was not prepared\naccording to the PWD rates. He has not taken in writing\nfrom shop keepers about the market rates if the articles\nexisting then. They did not mention the break up figures\nof the electrical devices. They did not go to the Tamil\nNadu Electricity Board to find out about the electrical\nconnections of the building they inspected. At that time of\ntheir inspection apart from Inspector Jayapal, his higher\nofficers were not present there. They inspected the\nPaiyanur bungalow for about one to one-and-a-half hours.\nWe prepared a proceedings Note, model plan of the\nelectrical devices in the Paiyanur bungalow. He gave them\nto the Executive Engineer Swarnam. That model plan and\nthe proceedings note were not submitted in the Court.\nThe value mentioned in the report is only a rough\nestimation. They cannot assess the electronic items. In\nEx.P.663 on page No.5, the registered electrical device is\nX25. In X22 and X25, the break up figures of the electrical\ndevices are not mentioned. The details of how the\nmentioned amount was calculated were also not there. For\nEx.P.663 they prepared a proceeding note and model plan,\nbut that was not attached in Ex.P.663. The one time value\nin Ex.P.661, the answers he has given tallied with\nEx.P.663. The detailed report they prepared was not\nattracted with Ex.P.663. When they signed on Ex.P.663,\nthey did not ask what happened to the report they\nprepared. The electrical devices in \"Namadu MGR\" and\nAnjaneya Printers were valued for about one to one and-a-\nhalf-hours. In that valuation, apart from Selvaraj, nobody\nwas involved in the proceedings. At that time of the\nvaluation, apart from the Inspector, no other individual\nwas present there.\n\nIn Ex.P.2152 the model plan, break up figures, price\nlist (our department and the market rate), electrical\ndevices price, transportation charges, electrician labour\ncharges and wages of the assistants were not mentioned.\nIn Ex.P.2152 for the first term a comparative tabular chart\nwas prepared, but it was not attached to Ex.P.2152.\nDocumentary evidence for the prices of items in Ex.P.2152\nwas not attached. They valued the electrical devices in\nthree types of buildings. Out of that, electrical device in\nthe old building may have been fixed for 10 years before\nthey inspected. In the new buildings, the electrical devices\nmay have been fixed two weeks before their inspection. In\nEx.P.2152 they did not mention the details like the gauge\nof electrical wires, how many electrical wires in one slot\nand how many coil wires, the standard and types. When\nthey come to know the correct price value of the above\nmentioned articles, then only they can assess correctly.\nAll the items places in Ex.P.2152 were prepared in a\ntabular chart, but it was not attached with Ex.P.2152. If it\nhad been attached, it would have been possible to do the\ncorrect assessment. The assessment value amount is\napproximate value. Out of our experience, they did the\nassessment. For the price of the articles, they did not take\nany proof from the shop keepers. The items in Exs.P2152,\n66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 77 to 82, 185, 191, 254, 255, 256,\n259, 260, 261, 261 and 264 were the electrical devices.\nIn their department there is a Radio Engineer to value the\nelectronics items, but he did not come along with them.\nSince our team members do not have any training to value\nthe electronic devices, they cannot do the assessment.\nFor the item 58 they did not mention the manufacturing\ncompany's name and capacity in the Ex.P.2152.\nDepending upon the company and capacity, the price will\nbe fixed. The details will be applicable to item 61 also.\nThe items from 126 to 129 were made out of stone and it\nis a decorative item. So, they do not have the qualification\nto assess those items. They have to do more assessment\nfor the glass ware fixed in the items 150 to 156. The\nvalue is less for the electrical devices. The AC units (items\n70 to 72) were old, yet they did the assessment. The\nvalue of the AC machines goes down if used regularly. In\nEx.P.2152 the valued AC unit they have not taken into\nconsideration of the wear and tear of the machine. So,\nthey did not mention the prices of it items 107 and 108\nhow old are they and its wear and tear value account was\nnot mentioned in Ex.P.2152. The items 186 to 196 in\nEx.P.2152 they did not mention how old they were and the\nmarket price. They did not submit any proof to show what\nexactly the marked rate of those items was. In Ex.P.2152\nthey did not mention for the item 204 about the cable\ndrawn from where to where and the details of the work\ndone. In his report, he did not mention why the cable was\nused. Items 223, 224 and 225 are chandeliers. He has\nnot attached any proof about the market prices in\nEx.P.2152. The answer given by him to the item 58 is\napplicable to item 235 also. The camp office mentioned in\ntheir report is the Chief Minister's office. In the camp\noffice, the electrical devices, electrical articles and\nelectricity connection were taken by the Tamil Nadu\nGovernment expenditure. The items from 261 to 270 were\nthe electronic items. They do not know the assess these\nitems. If the owner of the building directly purchased the\nelectrical devices and the articles and fixed them, there is\na chance that the price will be 30 per cent to 40 per cent\nless than in their assessment. For the item 272, no\ndocument was attached as proof. If the building owner\ndirectly took care to fix the electrical devices for the item\n273, no expenditures will be incurred. At the time of their\nassessment, other than the police and us, nobody was\nthere. At the time of our assessment, they did not enquire\nwith the building owners or the people who belonged\nthere.\n\nPW.221 - R.

As per the information he\nhas received, he has mentioned in the complaint the\nproperties of 1st accused on the basis of the complaint. His\nsworn statement was recorded by the Court. That\ncomplaint is registered as Criminal Miscellaneous Petition\nNo.3238/1996. In that complaint, he has requested the\ncourt to get more witnesses by further investigation. In\npursuance of\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C., the Judge directed it\nto be investigated. During this case investigation,\nMr.Nallamma Naidu enquired him.\n\nDuring the cross-examination, he has deposed that\nwhen he was the Minister, he gave the particulars of\nhisassets to the Prime Minister. Then Mr.Chandrashekar\nwas the Prime Minister. When he won as the M.P. from\nMadurai Constituency, he has not submitted particulars of\nhis assets to the Parliament. It was mandated. It was not\nnecessary for him to show his truthfulness. Hence, he did\nnot submit his particulars of his assets. In 1977, he was\nelected as M.P. from Bombay (North East) Constituency.\nIn 1980 also he was elected from the same constituency.\nThen also he did not submit particulars of his assets\nin the parliament. Nobody had asked for those details.\nPW-232 was recalled and re-examined by the learned\nSpecial Public Prosecutor and questions were posed as\nunder:\n\nQuestion: if I ask you, will you as a citizen, submit your\nparticulars of assets?\n\nReply: You do not have the right to ask for it but I will\nconsider it if Selvi Jayalalitha writes a letter asking about\nmy particulars of assets. Since 1974, I am a Member of\nParliament.\n\nQuestion: In the politics only one Government was\ndismissed on charges of corruption. Do you know about\nthat?\n\nReply: Not only one Government. Many State\nGovernments were dismissed for corruption. In\nKarnataka, Devaraj Urs Government was dismissed for\ncorruption.\n\nIn 1976, Karunanidhi's Ministry was also dismissed\nfor corruption. He has filed a case against DMK Minister.\nHe has filed a Writ Petition before Hon'ble High Court in\nChennai to conduct CBI enquiry against then Thirupathur\nMLA and the then Minister Periaswamy relating to the\nSandalwood. He has also lodged a separate complaint\nagainst Tharapuram MLA for having given false caste\ncertificate. Moreover it is mentioned in the petition that\nthe false caste certificate is issued with the knowledge of\nthe Chief Minister. Till this day, he has not filed any\ncomplaint against any of the DMK Ministers leveling\ncorruption charges. He does not know whether all the\ninformation furnished in the petition under\nSection 202\n\nCr.P.C. is taken up for investigation. On verification, he\nfound out whether the investigation is conducted relating\nto charge of amassing wealth disproportionate to know\nsource of income is done only while investigating. Then he\nhas taken up only issues for investigation and not all other\nissues he has raised in the petition. The Janatha Party is\nfunctioning in a good Bungalow at Santhome. He does not\nremember about the number of grounds of land that\nBungalow occupies. Janatha Party is not paying any rent\nfor that building. He does not remember whether Selvi\nJayalalitha has acted as a heroine in 136 Movies. May be\nby acting as a heroine in 136 Movies, she would have\nearned lot of assets.\n\nHe opposed Selvi Jayalalitha politically from 1992 to\n1996. Since 1980, he was a Loksabha Member\ncontinuously for 6 years. After that he did not win in\nLoksabha Elections. Once he contested and he was\ndefeated.\n\nHe was defeated in Madurai. It is wrong to state\nthat, in alliance with Jayalalitha, he won the next Loksabha\nelections. But with the support of ADMK alliance, he won\nthe Loksabha from Madurai. In 1999, he was defeated\nfrom Madurai without ADMK alliance (support). He has\nnever referred Selvi Jayalalitha as Durga, Saraswathy or as\nLakshmi. But he has told that the Mayavathi, Sonia\nGandhi and Jayalalitha should play a role of Durga,\nSaraswathy and Lakshmi to dismiss the Government of\nBJP. It is wrong to state that he has not co-operated with\nanybody in his political life. It is wrong to state that he left\nJanasang Party. It is wrong to state that he had\ndifferences of opinion with leadership of Janasangh. Some\nleaders from Janatha Party left party due to differences of\nopinion. But he is in Janatha Party only. It is wrong to\nstate that political instability is his way of political life. It is\nwrong to state that he is the political enemy of Selvi\nJayalalitha and acting accordingly. During his thirteen\nmonths of relationship with political party of Selvi\nJayalalitha he did not file any case against her. Thereafter\nalso he did not file any case against her.\n\nIn Thiruchi, Mr.Velusamy was in his party. He\nexpelled him because Mr.Velusamy lodged a complaint on\nhis behalf relating to Rajeev Gandhi murder case. But that\ncomplaint dismissed. He has not filed defamation case\nagainst anybody. He has not filed any case against\nMr.Velusamy. During DMK regime in the year 1996 he told\nthat he is going to file a case relating to Arrack\nmanufacturers. But he has not filed any cases like that.\nMr.Chandraswamy is his friend. But he is entangled in\nmany cases. During Selvi Jayalalitha's regime, he was\narrested in Chennai. He does not know the reasons of\narrest. It is wrong to state that he sought the\nrecommendations of the then Chief Minister Selvi\nJayalalitha for the release of Mr.Chandraswamy. It is\nwrong to state that as the AIDMK Party refused to have\nalliance with his party, he has given blatant complaint\nagainst the President of ADMK Party. He does not\nremember in how many places the Janatha Party has\ncontested in 1996 Assembly election. Now he does not\nremember whether they have lost deposit in all the\ncontested places. It is wrong to state that despite his\nperpetual political threat she did not submit herself to his\nthreat, hence he lodged this blatant complaint. It is again\nwrong to state that, as she did not get along with him\npolitically, he was telling blatant complaints against her.\nWhen Mr.Narasimharao was the Prime Minister and Selvi\nJayalalitha was the Chief Minister, both did not have\ncordial relationship. Then Mr.Chenna Reddy from Andra\nPradesh was the Governor of Tamil Nadu.\n\nMr. Chenna Reddy granted permission to file a case\nagainst Selvi Jayalalitha. During that time,he canvassed\nagainst Selvi Jayalalitha from place to place. It is wrong to\nstate that time, Selvi Jayalalitha was opposing\nMr.Narasimha Rao, he was used as weapon by\nMr.Narasimha Rao. That time, the Tamil Nadu\nGovernment tried to arrest him. But did not arrest him as\nhe received an order for that from the Supreme Court. It\nis wrong to state that from the beginning he did not like\nSelvi Jayalalitha. It is wrong to state, like seasons his\npolitical ideologies also getting changed. It is wrong to\nstate that because of his hatred against. In 1991, the\nDMK Government was dismissed. Immediately, the\nAssembly and the Parliament election came. It is wrong to\nstate that, he has asked Selvi Jayalalitha, the South\nChennai Parliament Constituency, it is wrong to state that\nas she refused to allot him that seat, he developed hatred\nagainst her. In 1991 he did not contest election. It is\nwrong to state that, as she did not allot him the seat, he\ncould not contest in the election. It is wrong to state that\nshe is capable of gracefully forgiving people. He has\nlodged this kind of complaints. It is wrong to state that in\nhis view that nobody from DMK are involved in corruption.\nDuring the end of 1998, he has filed a suit relating to\nmanipulating the caste certificate. But so far, no final\ndecision has been given in that case. He did not file the\nsuit in the Chennai High Court for expeditious disposal of\nthat case. It is wrong to state that relating to the Madurai\nIdly Shop problem and action against the DMK\nrepresentative; initially he took speedier steps, later he left\nwithout taking any action. That DMK personality is\nMr.M.K.Alagiri, who is son of Mr.M.Karunanidhi. He has\nexpressed an opinion that Sun TV activities are illegal. But\nin regard to that he has not lodged any complaint. Hehas\nnot remained as a mute spectator after filing a case. He\ndoes not remember, whether hehas raised about Sun TV in\nthe Parliament. In this regard, he has not filed any case\nbecause he was not able to marshal sufficient evidence\nnecessary for filing of case. It is wrong to state that his\napproach towards Selvi Jayalalitha is both of enmity and\nhatred.\nDuring Re-examination, he states that in 1976, the\ncomplaint lodged against DMK Government was\nwithdrawn. The Tamil Nadu Police did not arrest\nMr.Chandraswamy. When he was not the member of\nLoksabha, he had been the member of Rajyasabha many\ntimes.\n\nPW.233 - Srinivasa Rao has deposed that he was working\nas Mandal Revenue Officer at Quitpullapur at Rangareddy\nDistrict from February 1995 to September 1996. He has\nissued 'patta' of lands standing in the name of\nSathyanarayana Raju, Jayalalitha and N.R. Sandhya.\nJayalalitha is in possession of 3 acres of grape garden. He\nhas issued 'patta' of Sy.

Rs.1.65 Crores was\nsanctioned from head office, out of that Rs.50 lakhs was\ngiven to Ramraj Agro Mills by Thiruvaroor Branch. Loan\nwas for working capital. Ramraj Agro Mills is a joint stock\ncompany.\n\nPW.236 - Jagannathan speaks about encroachment by\nAccused No.2 in different villages namely Pyanoor,\nKarugulapallam.\n\nPW.237 - S.S.Jawahar was working as Assistant\nSecretary to the Chief Minister. Accused Nos. 2 and 3\nwere staying in Chief Minister's House. Mr. Sudhakaran's\nmarriage took place in the year 1995.

Many cooks came from\nThanjavur to cook food for the marriage. He has seen 4th\nAccused Ilavarasi in Poes garden. He does not know the\naddress of the building constructed under Siruthur.\nDuring his period of work, Selvi Jayalalitha was very strict\nin her administration and was very particular that one\ndepartment officer should not interfere with another\ndepartment officer. Concerned party workers were\nappointed to look after the work of AIADMK. Criminal\ncases were filed and disciplinary proceedings were initiated\nagainst higher officers of previous Government and two\nChief Secretaries, Hari Bhaskar and Venkatraman, Senior\nIAS Officers, C.Ramachandran, T. R. Srinivasan, Pandey,\nAcharialu, Kurupoora Sundara Pandiyam, Sampath,\nSatyamurthy. He was not allotted work for one year. This\nday out of compulsion, he is giving evidence and stating\nwhatever he knows. This witness was re-examined\nbecause of the contradictory statements.

Bharani B Resorts availed a loan of Rs.325 lakhs\nfrom Abhirampuram Indian Bank.\n\nPW.240 - Latika Saran has deposed that she was working\nas I.G. of Police V & AC, Special Investigation Cell No.II,\nChennai. During 1996, she was working as a Dy.Inspector\nGeneral of Police in the same Wing. She has been directed\nunder\nSection 202\nCr.P.C. by the Principal Sessions Judge,\nChennai to investigate on the basis of a petition filed by\nDr.Subramaniam Swamy. (Crl.M.P.No.3238/96). She has\nreceived a copy of the complaint from the Court for the\npurpose of investigation. She took up investigation\nimmediately. She was assisted by Tr.Nallamma Naidu,\nthen ADSP of V&AC Dept. and other officers. She has\nissued an order under\nSection 17\nof the Prevention of\nCorruption Act. The order dated 1.7.1996 is Ex.P.2265.\nDuring investigation we collected records from the banks,\ndocuments from the Sub-Registrar's offices, from the\nregistrar of firms pertaining to investments, properties in\nthe names of former Chief Minister Selvi J.Jayalalitha,\nTmt.N.Sasikala and her close relatives and their business\nventures. Dr.Subramanian Swamy was examined by\nTr.Nallamma Naidu in her presence in the V & AC City\ndetachment office. On 14.8.96 the investigation was\nstayed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. On 4.9.96\nthe Hon'ble High Court of Madras vacated the stay and\ndirected the Director, V & AC to nominate an officer of his\nchoice to continue with the investigation. On 7.9.96 the\nDirector, V & AC nominated Tr.Nallamma Naidu, then\nADSP to take over the investigation. She handed over all\nthe records to Tr.Nallamma Naidu.\n\nDuring the cross-examination, she has deposed that\nshe was not examined for this case by Nallamma Naidu.\nShe was in charge of this case from 21.6.96 to 14.8.96.\nShe has received only the copy of the complaint filed by\nPW 232 in the Principal Sessions Judge, City Civil Court,\nChennai. Original complaint was not given to her. Except\nRajya Sabha proceedings, no document were filed along\nwith the complaint filed PW 232. On 18.7.96 PW 232 was\nexamined in her presence by Nallamma Naidu. At that\ntime Nallamma Naidu recorded the statement of PW 232.\nPW 232 did not produce any document when he was\nexamined by Nallamma Naidu. While going through the\norder of Principal Judge, she was aware that she was\ndirected to investigate on the complaint. During the period\nof her investigation, I consulted our Legal Advisor and was\nadvised not to register a case as the matter being handled\nunder\nSection 202\nCr.P.C. She has nominated about 10 or\n12 Police Officers to investigate in to that complaint.\nThose Officers were drawn from various Districts. As per\nthe order of Principal Judge she had to file report on or\nbefore 20.8.96. Till 14.8.96 she did not prepare the\nReport to be sent to Principal Judge, and at the same time\nher team was examining the witnesses and collecting\ndocuments. She has maintained a Case Diary for her\ninvestigation. Her Office also maintains General Diary. She\ncannot exactly say how many witnesses were examined\nand how many documents were recovered by her Deputed\nOfficers. If it is asked about 30 witnesses would have\nbeen examined by her Deputed Officers the answer is she\naccepts that. She has concentrated mainly on Bank\ntransactions. She has perused and obtained copies from\nCanara Bank, Mylapore Branch, Abhiramapuram Indian\nBank, Central Bank of India, Secunderabad and\nHyderabad, Bank of Madura, Anna Nagar Branch, Canara\nBank, Kellys Branch. She was then and there informing\nthe development in her investigation to the Director of\nVigilance and Anti Corruption and I got his advices. As per\nAct 49/88 I have authorized all the 13 officers under\n\nSection 17\nand she does not remember how many officers\nwere authorized under\nSection 18\nof that Act. She was not\nin a position even after looking in the Case Diary, on what\ndate and under what proceedings she has issued orders\nunder\nSection 18\nof that Act. The same answer is\napplicable for the proceedings issued under\nSection 17\nof\nthat Act. Her Director did not find fault with her till\n14.8.96. Till November 1997 I continued as D.I.G. in the\nVigilance and Anti Corruption Department. Ex.D.10 is the\norder of the High Court in Crl.O.P.No.5755 of 96, dated\n4.9.96. In that order her continuance of investigation in\nthat case was not prohibited. After Ex.D.10, she was not\nallowed to continue the investigation in this case and one\nV.C.Perumal, was nominated to investigate this case. The\nDirector has nominated Nallamma Naidu to investigate this\ncase. She did not send any Report to Principal Sessions\nJudge, stating that she was not in a position to file a\nReport as called for by Principal Sessions Judge as she was\ndivested with investigation. She has also handed over the\nCase Diary to Nallamma Naidu. The Officers who assisted\nher for the investigation in this case are 1. P.Jagannathan,\nInspector of Police, DV & A.C., 2. L.Purushothaman,\nInspector of Police, Chennai, 3. R. Dakshinamoorthy,\nD.S.P., V & A.C., Cuddalore, 4. Thiru Valsarajan,\nInspector of Police, V & A.C., Chennai, 5.

I have issued orders for Jayapalan\nunder\nSection 17\nand not under\nSection 18\nof P.C.Act.\nSimilarly she has issued orders under\nSection 17\nof P.C.\nAct to V.Babu, C.Murugesan, Nallamma Naidu,\nPurushothaman and not under\nSection 18\nof P.C.Act. But\nshe has issued orders to valasarajan under\nSections 17\n\nand\nof P.C.Act. She has issued orders\nu/s. 18\nof\nP.C.Act to Jagannathan, Dakshinamoorthy,\nP.S.Sethuraman, G. Shankar, T.R.Shanmugavelandi, T.\nJanarthanam and S.Radhakrishnan. She has not issued\norders for the above Officers\nu/s. 17\nof P.C.Act. She has\nnot examined any witness during her investigation in this\ncase. She did not get any further opinion other than that\nof her legal Advisor's opinion. Further she has not\nobtained any written legal advice from her Legal Advisor.\nShe has got only oral legal advice from him. She was not\naware whether the statements recorded and documents\nrecovered have been submitted to this Court. She has\nalso sought the assistance of Inspector Krishna Rao who\nwas working in the Commissioner of Police Office for this\ncase. Other than the above Krishna Rao, she has sought\nfor more persons from her investigation. But 3 Officers\nwere sent for it. They will not come under 13 Officers\nnominated by her. For her investigation, she has specified\nnames of Officers to be sent to assist her for investigation.\nWhen she has started investigation in this case, political\nsituate was tense. When the investigation was going on in\nthis case News papers and Sun T.V. published the matters\nconcerned in the investigation. When she was\ninvestigating this case PW 241 was working as Director of\nProsecution. I conducted Periodical Meetings with her\nOfficers who are on duty for this case. As soon as\ncollected the recorded statements of witnesses and\ndocuments recovered by her officers she has sent them\nthen and there to the Principal Sessions Judge. During her\ninvestigation period she did not send any statements or\ndocuments gathered during her investigation period to\nPrincipal Sessions Judge. PW 232 has given complaint\nonly against A1. No witness was cited in the complaint\ngiven by PW 232. Her team has issued summons to the\nwitnesses for examination and for production of documents\nunder\nSection 160\nCr.P.C. Apart from issuing summons,\npersonal contacts were made with Bank Officials and other\nDepartmental Officers for the collection of documents.\nAfter Ex.D.10, Nallama Naidu was nominated as\nInvestigation Officer. Her Director has nominated her on\n4.9.96 to supervise the investigation. But she did not\nexercise that power. No further order to supersede the\nabove order was passed.\nPW.241 - V.C.Perumal has deposed that he was retired\non 31.7.2000 from the Anti-Corruption and Prevention,\nVigilance Department as Additional Director General of\nPolice in Special Investigation Division-1. Again he was\nreappointed as the officer on Special Duty and he was\nworking in the same post. Previously, he was worked as\nI.G. in the Police Department in the same Special Division.\nDr.Subramanian Swamy had filed a writ petition under\n\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. in Chennai Principal Sessions Court.\nAccording to that after getting permission from the court\nTmt.Lathikasaran, DIG in Anti-Corruption and Prevention\nDepartment, had to enquire E.K.A.Pa`. The court ordered\nthe enquiry to assist her Additional Deputy Superintendent\nThiru Nallamma Naidu and some police department\nofficials (all working in Anti-Corruption and Prevention\nDepartment and Vigilance Department) were appointed by\nthe Director, Anti-Corruption, Prevention and Vigilance\nDepartment. Then the investigation started. This team\nenquired Dr.Subramaniam Swamy and other witnesses.\nThey collected some documents from the banks, finance\ncompanies and Registration office. Some documents were\ncollected from the companies started by Selvi Jayalalitha\nand her associates. All those documents were verified by\na separate division. In that situation High Court stayed\none order, Criminal M.P.No.5755/96. Accordingly, the\ninvestigation could not continue because of the stay. The\nstay was revoked on 4.9.96 by the court. In the same\norder, it was stated that, Thiru. Nallamma Naidu could\ncontinue with the investigation. An order was passed to\nthis effect. The court ordered that the officer appointed by\nthe Director, Anti-Corruption and Prevention Department\nwould continue with the investigation. On this basis\nNallamma Naidu was appointed and he continued the\ninvestigation and he seized the documents relating to Selvi\nJayalalitha and he examined them. In this situation after\nhe took charge as IG i.e., on 9.9.1996 immediately, he did\na detailed examination of the documents. Particularly\nwhen we examined these documents along with the\nevidences, it was evident that Selvi Jayalalitha when she\nwas in power as the Chief Minister had acquired\ndisproportionate wealth and property more than her known\nincome. On the basis of the documents collected so far he\nknew that a case could be filed on Selvi Jayalalitha under\n\nSection 13(2)\nread with\nSection 13(1)(e)\nAnti-Corruption\nand Prevention Act, 1988. Ex.P2266 is that FIR. In the\nsame FIR only, he appointed Thiru. Nallama Naidu,\nAdditional Superintendent as Investigation Officer, and he\nissued the order. He has submitted the FIR to the\nPrincipal Sessions Court. He has advised Thiru. Nallamma\nNaidu to investigate under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. along\nwith this case L.P.N.13/AC/96, the Secretariat case. As\nthe investigation had to be carried out in many districts of\nTamil Nadu and some other states he appointed some\nofficers to be of help to Thiru. Nallamma Naidu and passed\nan order to this effect. The Ex.P2267 is the order he\npassed to Inspector Thiru Jaya Prakash under the\nAnti-\nCorruption and Prevention Act\n1988,\nSection 17\n. Under\nthis Act 1988\nSection 17\n, Anti-Corruption and Prevention\nAct, he ordered Inspector Karunakaran, Ooty, on 19.9.96,\nthis is Ex.P2268, under Act 1988\nSection 17\n, Anti-\nCorruption and Prevention Act the Inspector Thiru.\nJayapalan, Kancheepuram was given an order on 19.9.96.\nThis is Ex.P2269.\nUnder Act\nSection 17\n, Anti-\nCorruption and Prevention Act, Inspector Thiru.\nVivekanandan Kovai was given an order on 19.9.96. This\nis Ex.P2270.\nUnder Act\nSection 17\n, Anti-Corruption\nand Prevention Act, Inspector Thiru.Suresh Kumar Tiruchy\nwas given an order on 19.9.96 as per Ex.P2271.\nUnder\nthe Anti-Corruption and Prevention Act\n\nSection 17\n, he gave\npower to investigate and passed an order to the following\nmembers, ADSP. Thiru Shanmuga Velandi, Thanjore, DSP\nThiru Janardhan, Tirunelveli, DSP Thiru Adiya Padam,\nTiruchy, DSP Pari, Erode, DSP Thanga Pandian\nShivagangai, DSP Dakshina Murthy Cuddalore, DSP\nAsokan, Salem under the same Act, he ordered the\nfollowing members for the investigation. DSP Paul\nDevadoss, Dharmapuri, ADSP N.K.Velu Kovai, SP\nAnbucelzhian, Chennai. These orders are Ex.P2272 in a\nrow (total 14 orders). He has sent the copies of the orders\nto Nallamma Naidu and Principal Sessions Court, under my\nsupervision Nallamma Naidu completed his investigation in\nthis case and he submitted the charge sheet on 4.6.97.\n\nDuring the cross-examination, he has deposed that if\nthey asked for his educational qualification it is not related\nto this case. He has joined in the police department after\nhe passed in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission\nGroup I examination. It is wrong to state that when he\nwrote the Group-I Examinations he was a teacher. His\nfather-in-law's name is Aroor Muthu. His father-in-law was\nelected as MP from the DMK Party in 1962 and 1967.\nWhen he was in service then the Chief Minister was\nThiru.M.Karunanidhi and had only official connections with\nhim and not any other contact because his father-in-law\nbelonged to DMK. In 1965 he joined Police Department.\nIn 1994 he was promoted as IG. He has received the file\nprepared by PW.240 in this case. The order came from the\nTamil Nadu Government. The order was given to him by\nhis Department Director Thiru.Raghavan and asked him to\nfile the FIR in this case. On the basis of legal advice and\nas he too was satisfied, he filed the FIR of this case. The\nGovernment order came from Government Public\nDepartment. He remembers that the order was signed\neither by the Chief Secretary or the Public Department\nSecretary. In the FIR Ex.P2266 filed by him, he did not\nmention the above said Tamil Nadu Government Order.\nThe above said Tamil Nadu Government order is about 3\npages and it is in their Head Office file. Regarding his\ncase, the PW.240 collected the witness, formal statements\nand the documents were in the file taken from the PW.240.\nIn the Chennai Principal Sessions Court, the PW.232 had\ngiven a complaint under\nSection 200\nof Cr.P.C. So the\ncourt ordered to carry out the investigation on PW.240.\nThis detail he came to know through the file. When he\nfiled the FIR regarding this case, he knew that in the\nPrincipal Sessions Court, the investigation under\nSection\nof Cr.P.C. was pending. In this case when he filed the\nFIR, according to PW.232, under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C.\ncomplaint was given on Selvi Jayalalitha about the\nacquired disproportionate wealth and property case. Even\nthen, they contained two different allegations. According\nto the FIR\nSection 13(2)\njointed read with\nSection 13(1)(e)\n\nwere registered under\nAnti-Corruption and Prevention of\nCorruption Act, 1988\n. PW.232 has given complaint in the\nPrincipal Sessions Court under the same Section. The\nEx.P2266 was registered only in the name of Selvi\nJayalalitha. PW.232 has given complaint only on Selvi\nJayalalitha, in the Principal Sessions Court. On the\ncomplaint of the PW.232, the enquiry was being conducted\nunder\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. So, he did not take the\npermission from the Principal Sessions Court to file the\nFIR. Further as the investigation was going on under\n\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C, he did not inform the Principal\nSessions Court about the filing of the FIR. He knew the\ndetails of the order of the Principal Sessions Judge\nthatTmt.Lathika Saran had to conduct the enquiry under\n\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. Already the Criminal\nM.P.No.5755/96 had been investigated by PW.240, so the\nlast order was issued that she can continue the\ninvestigation. Further, in that order, there was no\nobjection for continuing the investigation by PW.240. As\nalready in this case, the PW.240 had investigated and the\nwitnesses were enquired and the documents were seized,\nso far this reason, he did not inform it to his Director, that\nthe same person could continue the investigation. He saw\nthe investigation file done by the PW.240. When he looked\nin to it, already about 300 witnesses had been enquired\nand many documents had been seized. He came to know\nabout all these from the file. In this case, after he\nregistered the FIR, the witnesses who had already been\nenquired in the investigation of the PW.240, were further\nexamined and their oral depositions were taken by Thiru.\nNallamma Naidu. But, he advised Thiru.Nallamma Naidu\nthat all the documents seized during the investigation of\nPW.240 were to be taken as they were. Already, he\ninformed that the documents were many, there were more\nthan 300 statements. A report was sent to the Principal\nSessions Court that accused Nos.2 to 4 were offenders.\nBut it was not changed in the FIR. At the time of filing the\nFIR, when the FIR was filed, apart from the criminal\nsections mentioned, other criminal sections were added\nbut the changes were not indicated in the FIR. In this case\nafter he has filed the FIR, he did not submit any requested\nto the FIR. The Principal Sessions Judge that the enquiry\nunder\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. should be completed. But for\nthe enquiry under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C, many petitions\nwere filed asking for time. In this case, after FIR was filed\non the basis of FIR only, the investigation was done, not\non the basis of\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. Yet for filing the\ninvestigation report under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. Thiru\nNallamma Naidu, submitted petitions to the Principal\nSessions Court on a number of days and got the\npermission to do so. In this case, in the investigation done\nby PW.240, a number of witnesses were enquired by Thiru.\nNallamma Naidu and other officers. All the formal\nstatements and seized documents, all the accusations were\nonly on the first accused. So, he has filed the FIR on the\nfirst accused only. In this case when the charge sheet was\nfiled there was no necessity to show separately the lists of\nthe witnesses enquired and the documents before the filing\nof the FIR. This is because, the documents and the formal\nstatements of the witnesses in the enquiry before filing the\nFIR and the documents after filing the FIR were combined\ntogether. The formal statements of the witnesses in the\nwitness list attached to the charge sheet of this case were\ntaken after 18.9.96. The formal statements of the\nwitnesses enquired before the filing of the FIR were not\nattached to the charge sheet. The formal statements of\nthe witnesses enquired in the investigation under\nSection\nof Cr.P.C, were not sent to the Principal Sessions\nCourt.\n\nApart from this case, he supervised the investigation\nof about 7 or 8 cases. Above him, their department\nDirector would supervise his work. They used to discuss\nthis case in their departmental weekly and monthly\nmeetings. He knew the details of the momentous seized\nfrom and sealed in Door No.18, 3rd Street, East\nAbhiramapuram in the basement of the house. He knew\nthat two licensed revolvers were seized at the time of the\ninvestigation from two individuals. The above mentioned\ntwo Revolvers and mementos if asked whether they were\nrelated to this case, he does not remember. He agrees that\nthe above mentioned articles if they are not related to the\ncase and if they are withheld, till now it is wrong. He has\nsupervised some proceedings like search of the house,\nseizing the evidence and the value of the jewels and\nbuilding. When he searched five places, he directly\nsupervised for a little while. An inventory mahazar was\nprepared for the search of that place, he did not observe\nwhether my presence in those places has been recorded in\nthe mahazar. Moreover he did not sign in any documents\nprepared in those five places. He does not know whether\nJayalalitha was arrested in the CBCID case and kept in\nCentral Jail, Chennai from 17.12.96to 3.1.97. But he knew\nthat she was arrested by the CBCID Police. When Selvi\nJayalalitha was in the Central Jail, Chennai, her house door\nNo.36, Poes Garden was searched. He did not advise\nNallamma Naidu to conduct the search at Door No.36,\nPoes Garden house from 18.9.96 to 7.12.96. During that\nperiod, to search the above said house Nallamma Naidu\ndid not seek his advice. At the time of the search of\nNo.36, Poes Garden house, about twenty to thirty police\nofficers were divided into 4 to 5 teams. Apart from that,\noutside the house too the police kept a watch. On\n7.12.96, at No.36, Poes Garden house, he was there for\nabout six or seven hours. He did not procure any separate\norder from the court to search the above said house on\n7.12.96. But the order was taken to search the house.\nFrom 7.12.96 to 12.12.96 for two or three days he looked\nafter the search of the house Door No.36, Poes Garden.\nHe refused to give permission to the 'Sun TV' and other\nprivate T.V.Channels to videograph the proceedings of the\nsearch from 7.12.96 to 12.12.96 at Door No.36, Poes\nGarden house. He also informed the other officers about\nmy refusal to give permission to the private TV to\nVideograph. After the search was completed in the said\nhouse, the TV, Videographers went inside the said house\nand videographed the house and telecasts the pictures on\nall private TV Channels. Nallamma Naidu filed a petition\non 6.12.96 to search No.36, Poes Garden house and\nJ.D.Metla and the vineyards at Andhra Pradesh. As\nNallamma Naidu had written a letter to our Department\nDirector, the members of the Taramani Tamil Nadu Film\nDivision came and took video pictures of the places\nsearched. He passed an order stating that these photos\nand videos should not be given to any private TV channels.\nParticularly he did not ask in his petition permission to\nsearch Door No.31A house. But in the inventory mahazar\nEx.P709, it is mentioned that Door No.31A was also\nsearched. In the Ex.P709 it was written that the rooms of\nNo.36 and 31A were also sealed. He told them to seal the\nroom. In the Ex.P709, in the 7.12.96 notes of the\nproceedings, it was not mentioned that the sarees, suit\ncases and jewels were found in that house. 7.12.96\nproceedings means, the search details from 7.12.96 fore\nnoon 12 p.m. to 8.12.96 early morning 5 a.m. Regarding\nthis case Nallamma Naidu did not enquire me and did not\nregister my 'formal statement'. In this case he was the\ncomplainant and still he could supervise the investigation,\nas per the information given by our department lawyers.\nAs he got a doubt, that being a plaintiff, if he could\nsupervise the investigation, so he asked the lawyers about\nthis. Even after he filed the FIR in this case, PW.240\nhelped him for the investigation. Because of that in this\ncase, the PW.240 joined in the review meetings. At the\ntime when the case started, Nallamma Naidu worked as\nAdditional Superintendent of Police. After some months,\nNallamma Naidu get a promotion along with his batch\nmates. After the retirement of Nallamma Naidu, the Tamil\nNadu Government reappointed him. In this case,he gave\npower to 12 officers, accordingly,\nSection 17\nof the Anti-\nCorruption and Prevention of Corruption Act and Four\nofficers under\nSections 17\nand\nof Anti-Corruption and\nPrevention of Corruption Act. But for Nallamma Naidu, he\ndid not issue any order to give power according to\nSections\nand\nof Anti-Corruption and Prevention of Corruption\nAct, separately. Ex.P2266, the FIR, also does not mention\nthat he gave power to Nallamma Naidu under\nSections 17\n\nand\nof Anti Corruption and Prevention of Corruption\nAct. At the time when Nallamma Naidu was investigating\nthis case or when he got promotion also, he did not give\nany power to investigate according to the\nSections 17\nand\nof Anti Corruption and Prevention of Corruption Act. If\naccording, to the\nSection 18\nof Anti-Corruption and\nPrevention of Corruption Act, those officers who had not\nbeen empowered cannot go to banks and seize the\ndocuments, about that he does not know. We wrote\nletters to the Chief Engineer to value the buildings. The\nengineers were allotted on the basis of our letter. Like\nthat we wrote a letter to the customs department. Then\nPW.125 Vasudevan was allotted. Our Department Director\nwrote letters to the Chief Engineer and the Customs\nDepartment. He does not know that if those letters were\nsubmitted to the court. They have some rules regarding\nthe functioning of our department. He verified the reports\ngiven by the valuers. He did not compare the details of\nthe reports given by the valuers without department rules.\nThe PW.125 came late to value the jewels. So Nallamma\nNaidu brought the goldsmiths Venkatesan and Jawaharlal\nS/o Sukraj to value the jewels in Door No.36, Poes Garden\nhouse. To bring two outside persons, Nallamma Naidu\ntook oral permission from him. Those to goldsmiths\nhelped to value the jewels on those two days. He does not\nknow that if oral deposition was taken and registered from\nthe 2 goldsmiths about their work. They did not receive\nany report from the 2 persons about their work. He\nremembers that one officer who was along with Nallamma\nNaidu, written down the information given by the 2 people\nat the time of the valuation. PW.125 came late, they\nasked the Customs Department for other alternative\narrangement. For that they said, that they did not have\nother officers. The notes given by the 2 goldsmiths would\nbe in about 5 or 6 pages. He does not know that if the\nnotes taken by the assistant of Thiru Nallamma Naidu were\nsent to the court or not.\n\nBefore the search was conducted in Door No.36,\nPoes Garden house i.e., on 16.10.96, 17.10.96 and\n18.10.96, the investigation team searched houses,\nbuildings and other places, totally 135 places were\nsearched on these days. In this case the charge sheet was\nfiled on 4.6.97 at that time only the 2nd to 4th accused\nwere shown as accused in this case. Upto that time\nNallamma Naidu the Investigation Officer had called the\nthree persons for enquiry, assuming them as accused.\nFrom the beginning of this case when the petitions were\nfiled in the Principle Sessions Court, he does not know that\nwhether Nallamma Naidu has mentioned 2 to 4 opponents\nas accused and were found guilty. When they discussed\nthe progress of the investigation of this case, he too\ndecided that the accused Nos.2 to 4 should be considered\nas offenders. Nallamma Naidu has to be asked if written\ninformation was sent to accused Nos.2 to 4 to call them for\nenquiry. The inventory mahazar of the Door No.36, Poes\nGarden house, the information and notes were prepared by\nthe 4 team members. There were 4 or 5 officers in each\nteam. He does not remember which officer led the team.\nHe does not remember which officer led the team.\nBecause of the heavy work load four teams were formed.\nOn 7.12.96 at 12.30 p.m. forenoon when they went to the\nDoor No.36, Poes Garden, for the first time, generally they\nsaw all the places in that house. When they went to the\nhouse, a person named Baskar from the house and a\nlawyer (name not known) raised objections. When they\nshow the court order, nobody objected our proceeding.\nNallamma Naidu divided the work among the team\nmembers. He read the inventory mahazar Ex.P709. In\nthat Ex.P709, it was not written how many teams were\nformed and what were the works done by the teams. In\nthat Ex.P709, 16 pages were written about the\ninvestigation done in Door No.36, Poes Garden on 7.12.96\nand 8.12.96 upto afternoon 1.30. Nallamma Naidu had\nnot written those 16 pages. The Ex.P709 was received by\nthe court on 12.12.96. While preparing the supervision\nmahazar for No.36, Poes Garden house, the notes were\ntaken. He asked them to prepare the inventory then and\nthere, but it was not prepared. During the 7.12.96 to\n9.2.96 search at the No.36, Poes Garden he asked\nNallamma Naidu whether they were following my advice,\nand he told me that he was acting as per my advice. Now\nhe came to know that Nallamma Naidu did not act\naccording to his advice and had changed the order of\nthings. They do not have a general diary in our\ndepartment office. He does not maintain any register for\nany daily office work. The file regarding this case was\nmaintained by Nallamma Naidu. The six pages petition\nfiled in the Principal Sessions Court on 6.12.96, there is no\ncourt seal in all those six pages. Further number was not\nallotted for that petition. According to our Department\nRules, our head office has to act as a police station. Their\noffice has to maintain all the registers like a police station\nmaintains. Only Nallamma Naidu knows whether\nVenkatesh Acchary and Jawaharlal were recognized\nvaluers. In their department, rules were framed for the\nframing of the\nSections 17\nand\nof Anti-Corruption and\nPrevention of Corruption Act. But in some orders issued\naccording to\nSection 18\nof Anti-Corruption and Prevention\nof Corruption Act, some sentences with regard to the rules\nwere not mentioned. It was known that the second\naccused paid income tax even before 1.7.91. The 4th\naccused also paid income tax even before 1.7.91. This\nwas brought to his notice. Further, Selvi Jayalalitha too\nhad been continuously paying the income tax and property\ntax from 1963. This was also brought to his notice. Selvi\nJayalalitha, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi had been separately\nassessed by the income tax department. Whether all the\nfour accused in this case have received separate notices\nfrom the department regarding the details of their\nproperties, only Nallamma Naidu should be questioned.\nRegarding this property, a notice served to Selvi\nJayalalitha on 14.4.97 and clarification was sought for an\namount of Rs.62,25,20,096/-, but in the charge sheet that\namount was mentioned as Rs.66,65,20,395/-. If they ask\nhim, whether in the Tamil Nadu Government letter dated\n30.4.97 seeking permission to file the case on Jayalalitha,\nthe amount was mentioned as Rs.65,86,70,850/-. This\ncan be clarified only with only by Nallamma Naidu. In the\nTamil Nadu political party functions, general meetings,\nconferences and the birthday party of leaders, the public\nand the party members give their gifts. The gifts and\nmoney is given to the leaders at the above said functions\nas a token of love. In the second additional list filed along\nwith the charge sheet the details of the assets from 1 to\n17 were given. These properties belonged to Selvi\nJayalalitha before 1.7.1991. The value of the door No.36,\nPoes Garden house mentioned in the additional list 1 and 2\nare the same. Further the building value with all the\nadditional buildings put up was shown in item No.181 in\nthe additional list - 2 as Rs.7,24,98,000/-. Our case was\nbased on the additional and new construction in No.36,\nPoes Garden house. About the details of the new\nconstruction and measurements only Nallamma Naidu\nshould be asked. Before 1.7.91 in the door No.36, Poes\nGarden house, what was the constructed area in squares?\nOnly Nallamma Naidu can answer. In Chennai, if a\nproperty was purchased in 1967, the value will go up many\ntimes by 1991. M.O.1 is a luxury bus. He does not\nremember in whose name the bus is. He does not\nremember if they have collected the copies of registration\ncertificate for their vehicles involved. In this case, he does\nnot know that if the cost price of the vehicles mentioned in\nthe list tallies with the original price of purchase. When\nthey calculate the income tax regarding the vehicles, they\ntake into account the wear and tear value each year. He\ndoes not know that if the discount for wear and tear of\nvehicles was given in this case and deducted. He has not\nseen properly whether the vehicles not belonging to 1, 2\nand 4 accused have been taken into their account and\nvalued. Only Nallamma Naidu can answer. In the\nadditional list, the vehicle items 230 to 264 were\nmentioned. In that for none of the vehicles the date of\npurchase was mentioned. Of those he does not know that\nif the seven vehicles were purchased before 1.7.91 and\nwhether they have been mentioned in the additional list.2.\nThe Maruthi Gypsy car No.TN.09 P 4171 is the Ex.P235.\nAccording to this, the car was purchased before 1.7.91.\nAccording to Ex.P241 the tempo trax TN 09 P 6975 was\npurchased before 1.7.91 by AIADMK party. According to\nEx.P242, the Omni bus Bajaj Tempo TN 09 6966 was\npurchased before 1.7.91 by the AIADMK party. According\nto Ex.P243, the Swaraj Mazda No.TS 01 9090 was\npurchased by Selvi Jayalalitha in 1988. According to\nEx.P244 Swaraj Mazda vehicle ISR 333 was purchased by\nSelvi Jayalalitha in 1989. According to Ex.P245, Swaraj\nMazda TN 01 9999 was purchased by Jaya Publications\nbefore 1.7.91. According to Ex.P249 the Contessa Car\nNo.TN 01 0033 was purchased by Jayalalitha in 1990.\nAccording to the documents from Ex.P224 to Ex.P227,\nvehicles mentioned in the documents the Exs.P223, P234,\nP236 to P239 were purchased by Sasi Enterprises. The\nvehicles mentioned in the documents Exs.P246 to 248\nwere purchased by Anjaneya Printers. The vehicles\nmentioned in Exs.P251, P252, P255 were purchased by\nJaya Publications. The vehicles mentioned in the Exs.P256\nand P257 were purchased by the Namadhu MGR office,\nonly Nallamma Naidu can tell whether the Jaya\nPublications, Sasi Enterprises, Anjaneya Printers and Metal\nKings had started functioning before 1.7.91. He did not\ncheck whether the accused involved in this case had\nbrought their vehicles by paying full amount or on\ninstallments. It is known that before 1.7.91 Selvi\nJayalalitha had kept permanent fixed deposits in 16 banks\nand companies. He does not know that whether the fixed\ndeposit amount was above three crores. The fixed deposit\namount mentioned in the above banks kept by Selvi\nJayalalitha after maturity was re-deposited again. To\nknow the assets of Selvi Jayalalitha before 1.7.91 after\nconsultation with the advocates who went into the details\nminutely the value was arrived at. The original renewal FD\nreceipts were not seized and submitted in this court.\nAccording to the rules of our department, before taking\naction against any government servant we must first know\nthe approximate family expenditure of that person.\nRegarding this approximate family expenditure, the\nstatistic department officer was not enquired and his\ndeposition was not taken. He does not know that whether\nthe public and the party gave gifts and gift cheques for the\nbirthday of Selvi Jayalalitha in 1991-92 and 1992-93 and\nthe other years. Nallamma Naidu only can answer\nwhether the gift cheque amount would be added to the\nincome of the receiver and whether the amount was added\nfor the calculation of the tax. They come to know that\nSelvi Jayalalitha had shares in many firms. But he does\nnot know that how many shares she had and in how many\nfirms. The members who assessed the slippers, sarees\nand watches in the house of Selvi Jayalalitha were brought\nby Nallamma Naidu only. Only Nallamma Naidu should be\nasked where was the necessity to bring persons for\nvaluation other then the persons mentioned by the court.\nHe does not remember the date on which the evidences\nwere first seized at Selvi Jayalalitha's house during the\nsearch. In Ex.P709 it was not mentioned about the weight\nof the silver, gold, diamond jewels types of the jewels in\nSelvi Jayalalitha's house. In Ex.P2266 in the 4thPara it was\nmentioned about the 2 to 4 accused. But Ex.P2266 does\nnot show them as offender (guilty).\n\nHe does not know that whether the bank accounts of\nThirumathi Sasikala were frozen on 21.9.96, 9 months\nbefore filing the charge sheet regarding this case. He did\nnot advice to prepare a model plan when Ex.P709 was\nprepared. But He advised that the procedures should be\nfollowed. He did not give any particular advice at the time\nof furnishing the proceedings in the investigation of the\nD.No.36, Poes Garden house on 7.12.96. He did not ask\nparticularly if the general details given by him were fulfilled\nduring that search and investigation. At the period, apart\nfrom this case, 7 more cases were framed on Selvi\nJayalalitha. He did not keep connection with the\ninvestigating officers in other cases, but Nallamma Naidu\nhad connection with those persons. He does not know that\nwhether the petitioner for search of D.No.36, Poes Garden\nhouse given on 6.12.96 was submitted at the Principal\nSessions Court or at the Principal Sessions Court Judge's\nhouse. That petition was not prepared by Government\nAdvocate. That petition was prepared by Nallamma Naidu\non 7.12.96. Before our team went for the investigation at\nD.No.36, Poes Garden, we come to know that Selvi\nJayalalitha had been arrested. It is not correct to say that\nhe was present at the time of Selvi Jayalalitha's arrest in\nher house by the CBCID. It is not correct to say that he\ntold Selvi Jayalalitha \"you have taken a long time\" when\nshe came out of her house. He does not know that\nwhether they brought the water canon from the metro\nwater and sewerage department to help in investigation of\nD.No.36, Poes Garden house. He does not know that\nwhether they used the water canon to check the house\ntaps, sending water into it to know whether any articles\nwere hidden inside the pipes. During the investigation at\nNo.36, Poes Garden activities like verification, seizing\nvaluation, taking video and photographs were done step by\nstep not at a time. He does not know that whether in\nD.No.36, Poes Garden house from 7.12.96 to 20.12.96\nactivities like investigation seizing, valuation, video and\nphotographs were carried or not. It is not correct to say\nthat wanting to arrest Selvi Jayalalitha when she was not\nin her house, from 18.10.96 to her arrest date 7.12.96,\nher house was not investigated. Only Nallamma Naidu can\nanswer who gave the legal advice to get the permission\nfrom the Chennai Corporation Principal Sessions Judge to\ninvestigate the places which don't come under the\njurisdiction of the Chennai Principal Sessions Judge.\nRegarding this he did not pay attention. In the Chennai\nCentral Jail when Selvi Jayalalitha was enquired from\n27.12.96 to 31.12.96 and on 2.1.97, he was not there.\nOnly Nallamma Naidu should be asked whether permission\nwas taken from the court to enquire her in the jail. The\nM.O.1 was valued by Mr.Venkataraman a transport Deputy\nOfficer and he gave the report. He does not know that\nwhether that report was notified in the court. From\n7.12.96, when Selvi Jayalalitha's house was under\ninvestigation, then and there the details were telecast in\nthe Sun TV. This was not brought to my notice. He did\nnot see the video shots regarding the above said matter in\nthe TV. He did not ask my officers whether they followed\nmy advice that the private TV Channels should not take\nvideo photos when the investigation was in progress in\nD.No.36, Poes Garden. The telecast of the investigation\nproceedings in Selvi Jayalalitha's house by the TV Channels\nwas not brought to his notice till now. Inspite of his advice\nif the investigation proceedings in Selvi Jayalalitha's house\nwere allowed to be photographed by private TV channels\nand telecast, it has to be condemned. Nallamma Naidu\ncan only answer why 75 witnesses enquired regarding the\ngift articles given at the time of Selvi Jayalalitha's birthday\nfunction in 1991-92 and the 111 documents seized during\nthis and the value for those gift articles and cheques were\nnot added to the attached list and why they are not\nbrought to this case.\nHe does not remember whether in their weekly and\nmonthly meetings they discussed about the gift cheques\nand gift articles. The gift cheques and the gift articles\nreceived by Selvi Jayalalitha amounting to Rs.3 crores\nshould have been shown in the income tax account only.\nNallamma Naidu should be asked why that Rs.3 crores\nreceived through gifts and cheques have not been included\nby Selvi Jayalalitha in the income tax calculation. It is\nknown that Selvi Jayalalitha is the AIADMK party General\nSecretary and more than more one crore members are in\nthe said party. He does not know that Selvi Jayalalitha\nreceived 3 lakh dollars, i.e., Rs.77,52,591/- from abroad.\nThey did not decide in our weekly or monthly meetings\nthat the amount should be taken as income in this case.\nIn this case, that amount was not mentioned as income of\nJayalalitha. He does not know that whether Selvi\nJayalalitha's locker No.1207 in Canara Bank, Mylapore\nBranch was searched or not in this case. For that, the\npetition was filed in the court, but in that petition the court\nseal was not found. For the petition, the number was not\nallotted. That there is no evidence in the locker is known\nfrom the investigation jabitha. The 2 to 4 accused were\nenquired by Nallamma Naidu for many hours on many\ndays. It is not correct to say that the second and fourth\naccused were enquired on many days, so that they would\nturn against Jayalalitha and could be compelled to become\napprovers. From 17.12.96 to 31.12.96 and on 2.1.97 in\nthe Chennai Central Jail, when Selvi Jayalalitha was\nenquired, whether the proceedings were done orally or in\nquestion and answers form and if the proceedings were\nprepared in writing. For all these details only Nallamma\nNaidu can give answer. Nallamma Naidu told him that he\nwas going to enquire Selvi Jayalalitha in the jail. He did\nnot advice Nallamma Naidu does he has to enquire Selvi\nJayalalitha. Hedoes not know that whether the information\nof the six days enquiry of Selvi Jayalalitha in the jail were\nsent to the court as per procedure. The accused related to\nthis case were not enquired in my direct observation.\nHedoes not know that whether the information regarding\nthe enquiry of the 2nd and 4th accused conducted for many\ndays and many hours, was filed in the court as per\nprocedure. He knew that many petitions were filed by the\nGovernment's side in this case. He did not bring the metal\ndetectors at the time of investigation in Selvi Jayalalitha's\nhouse. He does not know that whether a team of\ncomputer experts was brought at the time of investigation\nin Selvi Jayalalitha house. If it is stated that Selvi\nJayalalitha was not enquired before and after the FIR was\nfiled, instead she was enquired when she was in the jail for\n6 days because this was her mental conflicts and stress,\nregarding this, only Nallamma Naidu can answer. After\nverifying the account details in the attached list and\nproperty details, he decided that they were correct. The\narticles details mentioned in Ex.P709 and the articles\nmentioned in the valuation report of the articles in the list\nwere differing. This information was not brought to his\nnotice. If it is stated that the details of the property\nmentioned in the attached list and the value of the\nproperty were deliberately shown high so as to put the\naccused into trouble and their income was shown as less,\nthese he did not verify properly. In the above said\nadditional list, it is not shown that Selvi Jayalalitha and\nTmt.Sasikala would have owned at least one silk saree\nbefore 1.7.99. He does not know that in the additional list\nit was not mentioned about the shares purchased by Selvi\nJayalalitha before 1.7.91 in many companies and the\namount given to those shares.

He does not know that apart from 62 items of\njewels, the other jewels owned by Tmt.Sasikala after\n1.7.91 were not mentioned in the attached list, they have\nto ask Nallamma Naidu who valued the property and\njewellary owned by accused Nos.1 and 2 before 1.7.91\n(mentioned in the attached list). He did not pay much\nattention to the valuation of movable and immovable\nproperty mentioned in the attached list after 1.7.91. He\ndoes not know that why the details of the prices weight\nand the statistical list mentioned in the documents from\nExs.P857 to P860 were not mentioned in the attached list.\nFor the valuation of the jewels regarding this case, the\nvaluation date rate was taken into consideration to fix the\nrate of the jewels. Why they did not take the rate as on\n30.4.96? They should ask Nallamma Naidu only. Why the\nattached lists have not taken into consideration for the\nvaluation report given for Ex.P125. Only Nallamma Naidu\ncan answer. In this case, the date of purchase of jewels\nwas not taken into consideration for the valuation of\njewels. They did not take into account, the income and\nthe business of companies like Jaya Publications, Sasi\nEnterprises, Anjaneya Printers and Metal Kings. That\ninformation known to Nallamma Naidu. He does not know\nthat whether nine cases are pending against the accused\nfor taking loans in the banks. In those companies, the\nshare holders are entitled only for share and are not the\nowners of the company properties. Whether they knew\nthis legal detail, Nallamma Naidu can answer for this. It is\nnot correct to say that the valuation was not done\naccording to their department rules. He made sure that\nthe investigation carried out was according to our\ndepartment rules. Regarding the property when they\nasked explanation from the first respondent why they did\nnot point out the properties mentioned in the attached list\nand question, for this only Nallamma Naidu can give\nanswer.

It is not correct to say that he threatened the\n4th accused to write and give that Selvi Jayalalitha was the\nreason for the death of her husband who died in the\nelectrical shock. It is wrong to state that since she did not\nlisten to my words. He implicated her as an accused in\nthis case. After his retirement on 31.1.2000 only once he\nrejoined service for six months and worked on this case.\nIt is not correct to say that he has filed the FIR in this case\nand he has supervised the investigation due to political\nvendetta. It is not correct to say that the Ex.Chief Minister\nThiru M.Karunanidhi, Ex.Law Minister Thiru Madavan and\nADGP Thiru Kumaraswamy used to meet every Saturday in\nChief Minister's house and discussed about the case and\nthey advised to him as to how to run the case and that\nthey filed a false case. In this case, the charge sheet was\nsent through him to their department director.

It is not correct to say that\nthe 3rd accused during enquiry told in front of him that he\ngave professional advice how to run cable TV and used to\nget income out of this. It did not come to his notice if\nNallamma Naidu enquired the 3rd opponent regarding his\nprivate income. He does not know that if the 3rd accused\ntold Nallamma Naidu that through the Super Duper TV (P)\nLtd., Co., the 3rd accused received Rs.5,000/- from more\nthan 1000 members and out of this he gave the cable\nconnection and earned income. He knew about the\nmarriage of the 3rd accused with Shivaji Ganeshan's grand\ndaughter Sathyalakshmi. It is not correct to say that, the\ndetails regarding marriage expenditure, the details of the\npass books and the accounts given by the bride's family to\nNallamma Naidu were concerned. He does not know that\nwhether Nallamma Naidu enquired the details of the\nmarriage gift articles and he filed this account. He knew\nthat the 3rd accused father Thiru Vivekanandan was a Rural\nDevelopment Department Additional Director and has\nsocial status. It is not correct to say that the properties\nand income of the 3rd accused before 1.7.91 were not\naccounted properly. No written evidence was filed to show\nthe 3rd accused was the foster son of the first accused. It\nis not correct to say that because of political enmity to file\ncase on the first accused the 3rd accused was also joined.\nFor this he became an instrument in the hands of the\nGovernment. It is not correct to say that we joined the\nthird opponent as an accused in this case because he did\nnot listen to our threatened words and turned against Selvi\nJayalalitha as an approver. The third accused is not\nrelated through blood to the first accused. It is not correct\nto say that even though they came to know during\ninvestigation that six months before the marriage of the\n3rd accused, from the bride's house, they had given gift\namount out of which he purchased the property, we had\nhide this information.\n\nPW.242 - Jagannathan, PW.243 - Krishna Rao T,\nPW.244 - Vishwanathan C.P., PW.245 - Janarthanam,\nPW.246 - Paul Devadoss T, PW.247 - Radhakrishnan S.,\nPW.248 - Vasantha V., PW.249 - M.

Ex.P2341 which has 22 books and\nyielded Rs.1 Crore and Rs.10 lakhs has not been included\nas income of the Accused No.3 the reason being that this\namount is shown in the bank accounts and in the\nexpenditure to run the company and as income and\nexpenditure account was not shown, this amount was not\ntaken as income of Accused No.3.

Thyagaraj was prepared only on 18.4.97 i.e., two\n\nyears after marriage. Hence, it is not a genuine report.\n\nMr. G. Ramakumar, maternal Uncle of the bride cited as\n\nevidence in the charge sheet. The prosecution has not\n\nexamined him. K. Narayanswamy, father of the bride cited\n\nas a charge sheet witness. He was also not examined by\n\nthe prosecution.

She has acted in more than 120 films\n\nin various languages.

She has to change many costumes like\n\nsarees or silver kameez with matching footwear,\n\naccessories and watches etc. Once a particular item was\n\nused, it was never used again and many of them were\n\nretained by her as a momentos and this account for\n\naccumulation of footwear. Hence, these items should not\n\nhave been valued at all. As a Chief Minister during check\n\nperiod, she was not wearing any costly footwear at all.\n\nTherefore, there was no question of bringing any new\n\nfootwear. The DVAC has taken into account of these\n\nfootwears to bolster the numerous and size footwear which\nonly shows that the seizure were effected just to defame\n\nher. She has also submitted a petition to adduce Defence\n\nevidence.\n\nAbout 1,032 questions were put to Accused No.2.\n\nShe has also filed written statement.

The\nappeals were clubbed and a common order was passed by\nthe Appellate Authority on 29.12.1999 as per Ex.D63. The\nappellate Authority passed the Order Ex.D63 based on the\nprevious report of the Assessing Authority and also taking\ninto account of the inflation factor in the price index.\nThe Revenue (Income Tax Department) preferred\nSecond Appeals against the Orders as per Exs.D61 and\nD63 before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.

The Assessee in her Reply to the said Notices\nsent by the Department required the Department to state\nthe reasons for re-opening the earlier concluded\nAssessments. The Income Tax Department started the Re-\nassessment Proceedings without assigning any reasons.\nHence, A1-Jayalalitha preferred Writ Petition before\nChennai High Court challenging the Re-opening of the\nAssessments. In the said Writ Petition, the Department\nfiled their Counter explaining there under the reasons for\nre-opening for Assessments. In the light of that A1-\nJayalalitha withdrew the Writ Petition.\nThe Income Tax Department in the above Writ\nPetition had explained that the Anti-Corruption Department\nin Tamilnadu had informed them that the agricultural\nincome declared by the Assessee namely A1-Jayalalitha\nwas inflated and not a reason one and thereby the\nDepartment decided to re-open the earlier Assessments.\nThe Assessing Authority after re-opening the\nAssessments for the Assessment years 1987-88 to 1992-\n93, passed fresh Order partly disallowing the agricultural\nincome declared by the Assessee. Against the Re-\nAssessment Orders passed by the Assessing Authority, the\nAssessee preferred separate Appeals before the\nCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The Appellate\nAuthority after hearing the Assessee by a Common Order\non 31.03.2002, deleting the disallowance made by the\nAssessing Authority in respect of the agricultural income\ndeclared by Assessee.

In the Order Ex.D63, the Appellate Authority\nconsidered both the reports of the Registered Valuer\nproduced by the Assessee and also District Valuation\nOfficer of the Department. The Appellate Authority noticed\nthat there was no difference between the Report submitted\nby the District Valuation Officer regarding extent of\nconstruction and renovation.\nIt was demonstrated before the Appellate Authority\nthat the cost of structure as reflected in the Registered\nValuer's Report almost tallied with the estimation done by\nthe District Valuation Officer.

The difference was only\nregarding the cost of marbles used for the said\nconstruction.\nThe appellate Authority gave a direction to the\nAssessing Authority to verify the cost of marbles with\nreference to the bills submitted by A1-Jayalalithat and to\nsubmit Report regarding the said marbles. The Assessing\nAuthority visited the premises of the marble suppliers in\nBombay. The names of the said Marble Suppliers are:\n1) M/s. Simplex Enterprises.\n2) M/s.

A1-Jayalalitha constructed a new Farm\nHouse thereafter. The old farm house was not renovated\nby her during the check period.\nWhen the District Valuation Officer visited the said\nGrape Garden during the year 1997 in connection with\nvaluation of the Farm House, he was present as a\nRepresentative of the Assessee namely A1-Jayalalitha.\nDuring the said inspection, the District Valuation Officer\nobserved that no renovation was done by A1-Jayalalitha to\nthe said Farm House. The New Farm House which was built\nby A1-Jayalalitha was valued. The Income Tax Authorities\non the basis of valuation Report submitted by the District\nValuation Officer completed the assessment on the\npremise that new Farm house was constructed by A1-\nJayalalitha in the said Grape Garden and there was no\nrenovation of the old Farm House.\nOne Mr. Vijayashankar was the Architect for A1-\nJayalalitha. He designated the architecture of the Farm\nHouse as well as new building constructed in No.31/A,\nPoes Garden, Payments to the Architect always used to be\nmade through cheques. The said Architect Vijayashankar\nwas not engaged for any work relating to the marriage of\nV.N. Sudhakaran (A3).\nThe Assessee did not purchase any jewelry during\nthe check period. During the Assessment Proceedings\ncovering the check period (1/7/1991 to 30/4/1996) every\nitem mentioned in the I.T. Returns filed by A1-\nJayalalithawas thoroughly checked by the I.T. Authorities\nand they found that no purchases of jewelry were made by\nthe Assessee during the above period.\nAfter the Scrutiny Assessment was completed for the\nperiod 1997-98 Commissioner of Income Tax invoked\n\nSection 263\nof Income Tax Act on the premise that the\njewellery, sarees, footwear, motor vehicles, wrist watches\netc. were not valued in line with the valuation done by the\nDirectorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption, TamilNadu. In\nthis connection, a Show Cause Notice was issued to\nAssessee namely A1-Jayalalitha on 06.11.2001. In the files\nproduced before the Court by the Income Tax Department\nhe identifies Ex.D70 as Certified True Copy of the Show\nCause Notice dated 06.11.2001 sent to A1-Jayalalitha by\nthe Commissioner of Income Tax. To the said Show Cause\nNotice, copies of Inventory Mahazara drawn by Anti\nCorruption Police in respect of premises No.31/1, Poes\nGarden and No.36, Poes Garden along with covering letter\nwere attached.

Copies of Inventory Panchanamas enclosed to\nthat letter are Exs.D72 and D73. To the said Show Cause\nNotice, a reply in the form of objections was submitted by\nthe Assessee before the Commissioner of Income Tax. The\nCommissioner of Income Tax considering the above Reply\nof the Assessee, passed an order on 12.2.2002 as per\nEx.D74, setting aside the original Assessment done by the\nAssessing Authority.\nAgainst the order passed by the Commissioner of\nIncome Tax, the Assessee preferred an Appeal before the\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Income Tax Appellate\nTribunal after hearing both sides passed an Order on\n11.1.2008 as per Ex.D64 annulling the order passed by the\nCommissioner of Income Tax, both the facts and law.\nOn account of late filing of IT Returns by the\nAssessee, the Assessing Authority imposed penalty under\n\nSection 271(1)(b)\nof IT Act, by Order dated 30.08.1996\npassed by him. Against the said Order imposing penalty\nthe Assessee namely A1-Jayalalitha preferred an Appeal\nbefore the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) for the\nlate filing of IT Returns against the Order passed by the 2nd\nAppeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. A\nsubmission was made before the Appellate Tribunal that\nthe delay in filing of IT Returns was due to the negligence\non the part of the then Auditors M/s. Rajashekar and Co. It\nwas also submitted before the Appellate Tribunal that the\nAssessee was holding the post of Chief Minister of\nTamilNadu and she had entrusted the job of filing of her IT\nReturns to her said Auditors. The Appellate Tribunal\naccepted the explanation/contention of the Assessee and\ndeleted the penalty levied by the Assessing Authority,\nunder its Order dated 11.1.2008 as per Ex.D64.\nThe Assessing Authority had also imposed penalty\nunder\nSection 271(1)(C)\nof IT Act for concealment of\nincome by the Assessee and for furnishing of inaccurate\nparticulars of income. Against this Order, the Assessee\npreferred 1st appeal before the Commissioner of Income\nTax (Appeals). The Appellate Authority under separate\nOrders dated 18.6.1997 and 25.3.1999 pertaining to the\nAssessment Years 1993-94 and 1994-95 respectively,\ncancelled the penalty levied by the Assessing Authority.\nAgainst the Order passed by the 1st Appellate Authority,\nthe Revenue filed 2nd appeals before the Income Tax\nAppellate Tribunal. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal\nunder its common order dated 11.1.2008 dismissed the 2nd\nappeals preferred by the Revenue.\nAccording to him in view of the Orders passed by the\nIncome Tax Authorities there was no concealment of\nincome by the Assessee namely A1-Jayalalitha before the\nIT Authorities.\nThe Assessee's 44th birthday fell on 24.2.1992. At\nthat time, the Assessee had received gifts by way of\nDemand Drafts and cash from various Party Workers,\naggregating to Rs.2,15,00,012/- (Rupees Two Crores\nFifteen Lakhs and Twelve Only). She had also received\nForeign Remittance for Rs.77,52,591/-. The said gifts were\nduly declared by her in her IT Returns filed before the\nAssessing Authority. The said Demand Drafts were all\nremitted to the Bank Account of A1-Jayalalitha.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation initiated Criminal\nProceedings against A1-Jayalalitha regarding the above gift\nitems. The action of the CBI in initiating those proceedings\nagainst A1-Jayalalitha was challenged by A1-Jayalalitha\nbefore Madras High Court in a Criminal Petition filed\nu/\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. The said Criminal Proceedings\ncame to be quashed in entirely by the Madras High Court.\nThe Assessee namely A1-Jayalalitha had rental\nincome from house property, interest income from\ndeposits, dividend income from shares and agricultural\nincome from her agricultural lands.\nIf an Assessee incurs expenditure without showing\nproper source of income then under the\nIncome Tax Act\n,\nsuch expenditure would be treated as undisclosed\ninvestment and brought to tax. During the above check\nperiod, there was no such instance of the Assessee namely\nA1-Jayalalitha making such investment without disclosing\nthe source.\nIn internal page 13 of the order at Ex.D63, the\nAppellate Authority gave direction to the assessing\nauthority to visit Mumbai and ascertain the rates of\nMarbles and Granites and submit a report to the appellate\nauthority. In the records which are produced by Income\nTax Department before this Court, he Identifies Ex.D209\nas the letter dated 1.12.1999 addressed to the assessing\nofficer by the appellate authority, requesting the assessing\nauthority to ascertain the market rates of Marbles and\nGranites at Mumbai from the suppliers. Pursuant to this\nletter, the assessing officer had visited Mumbai for\nascertaining the rates at which the suppliers supplied\nMarbles and Granites to A1. He had accompanied the\nassessing officer. In the records produced before Court by\nthe Income Tax Department he identifies Ex.D210 as the\nreport which was submitted by assessing officer to the\nappellate authority on 10.12.1999. To the said report, the\nassessing officer attached the details of quotations given\nby the suppliers. The said quotations form Annexures 1 to\n40 the report Ex.D210.

On further appeal by the department as\nwell as assessee, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal while\nconfirming the cost of construction as declared by the\nassessee in respect of all the above 3 buildings, deleted\nthe ad-hoc addition of Rs.2,00,000/- each in respect of\neach of the above 3 buildings made by the 1st appellate\nauthority.

The cost of construction\nof new building in Jedi Metla property was Rs.139.62\nLakhs. Had the assessee been unable to explain the source\nof income for meeting the above expenditure, the income\ntax authorities would have constructed that the above\nexpenditure was met by the assessee from undisclosed\nincome. No such order was passed in any of the\nproceedings before the IT Authorities that the above\nexpenditure was met by the assessee from undisclosed\nincome. The source of income as per returns filed by the\nassessee was accepted by the IT Authorities, in respect of\nthe above expenditure.\nPart of the building in No.31-A Poes Garden had\nbeen leased by the assessee in favour of J Jay.

As General Secretary\nof the party, she used to receive gifts in the form of Gold\nSword, Gold Crown and Gold Scepter during various party\nfunctions from the organizers. These items for security\nreasons had been kept at the residence of Accused No.1.\nNone of these items personally belong to A1. In this\nregard, Mr. Dindigal the assessing-Treasurer of AIADMK\nParty had given letter to the Assessing Officer. He was\nrepresenting the assessee namely A1 before the\nCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) vide order Ex.D64.\nThe total amount of interest that accrued to A1 as per her\nBank accounts during the check period (01.07.1991 to\n30.04.1996) and as assessed by the I.T.

The IT Authorities gave\nintimation to the assessee stating that said Vasudevan is\nnot an approved valuer. Copy of the letter dated\n16.11.1998 addressed to the Deputy Commissioner of\nIncome Tax; Central Circle-II(2), Chennai is Ex.D215. The\nintimation dated 31.12.1998 sent by Deputy Commissioner\nof Income Tax to A1 is Ex.D216.\nIn case where any property is held by an assessee\nBenami in the name of other person and the IT Authorities\non enquiry find that there is such Benami holding of\nproperty by the assessee in the names of others, the IT\nAuthorities will treat the assessee as the owner of such\nproperty and if assessee is unable to explain the source of\nincome for the acquisition of such property then the IT\nAuthorities will treat the source as undisclosed income and\nproceed to assess such income. In respect of A1 there was\nno finding by IT Authorities that A1 was holding any such\nproperty or funds Benami i.e. in the names of any other\nperson.\nThe document which is marked as Ex.D69 dated\n18.03.1999 is incomplete. Its complete copy is found in\nVolume No.10 of the records produced by Income Tax\nDepartment. Complete copy of the said document is\nEx.D69(A).\nDuring the cross-examination, he has stated that he\ncompleted his B.Com degree in 1984. He completed his\nChartered Accountancy course in 1987. He did Articleship\nunder M/s Brammaiah and Co., Chartered Accountants,\nChennai from the year 1984-87. He started independent\npractice as Chartered Accountant from February 1988.\nFrom September 1988, he became a partner in M/s.\nShanmugham and Muttu, Chartered Accountants. He does\nnot remember the day or month on which he was\nappointed as before the Tax Authority and representing the\nAssessee a letter of authorization is required. He does not\nhave copy of the letter of authorization issued by A1\nappointing him as her auditor. If necessary he would\nproduce that letter later. The documents which are filed\nbefore this Court by the IT Authorities would show that he\nhas dealt with the accounts of A1. He has filed the IT\nreturns for A1-Jayalalitha for few years during the period\n1991-92 to 1998. He knows A1 personally. He is not her\nfamily member. A1 authorised him to represent on behalf\nof her before IT Authorities. He has not brought copy of\nthe letter of authorization issued by A1 authorizing him to\nrepresent her before the IT Authorities in various\nproceedings relating to her. If required he would produce it\nlater.\nHe has not gone through the sale deed pertaining to\nproperty No.31-A, Poes Garden. It is true that IT Appeal\nNo.214/1997-98 was filed by him before Commissioner of\nIncome Tax (Appeal) on behalf of A1. It is not true to\nsuggest that he has falsely stated before the Court that he\nwas present when the statement of Mallaredy was\nrecorded by the Assessing Officer as per Ex.D62. In\nEx.D61, which is copy of the order dated 31.03.1991\npassed in IT Appeal No.214/1997-98 by the Commissioner\nof Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Chennai his attention has been\ndrawn to the following observation at page 15 of the\norder:\n\"The counsel expressed the ignorance of the\nappellant about the visit of the officers of the\nHorticulture Department of Andra Pradesh. Similarly\nhe pointed out that it was not known to the appellant\nas to when Mr. Mallareddy was examined and a\nstatement was recorded from him\".\n\nWith regard to the above observation of the\nAppellate Authority, he said that one Mr. Maruthi\nNahendran who was Chartered Accountant of Mallareddy\nwas present and he attested the Sworn Statement of the\nsaid Mallareddy recorded as per Ex.D62 and that he was\npresent at that time. He has not signed the said Sworn\nStatement of Mallareddy, as Chartered Accountant of A1.\nThe said Sworn Statement does not mention his name. He\ndoes not have any document to show that he was present\nat Jedi Metla property when Sworn Statement of said\nMallareddy was recorded as per Ex.D62 on 12.03.1997 by\nthe Assistant Director of Income Tax, Hyderabad.\n\nQuestion:- I suggest to you that although you are\nauthorized representative of A1-Jayalalithat and you claim\nthat you have audited her accounts, You did not properly\npresent her case before the Commissioner of Income Tax\n(Appeals). What do you say?\nAns:- He has now read para-7 of the Order\ndt.11.01.2008 passed in I.T.-Appeals Nos. 1277 and\n1836/Mds/97 and connected appeals filed by A1 before the\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bench-B, Chennai. The\nappeal was against the imposition of penalty under\nSection\n271(1) (b)\nof Income Tax Act. The Appellate Authority had\nobserved in para7 of the above order that the Assessee\nnamely A1 being Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu state and\nalso General Secretary of Political Party at the relevant\nperiod was naturally busy with state matters and had\nentrusted all tax matters were taken care by her tax\nconsultant promptly and that unfortunately her tax return\nwas not filed and her income tax case was not represented\nproperly by her accountant and the same has resulted in\nex-parte assessment and penalty. The Appellate Authority\nhas also observed further that for the mistake of the\ncounsel it was not just and proper for the assessing officer\nto penalize the Assessee. I say that M/s. Rajashekar and\nCo., Chartered Accountants were the tax consultants for\nA1 at relevant point of time and on account of their\nmistake the penalty came to be levied on A1 by the\nIncome Tax Assessing Officer.\nQuestion:- I suggest that A1 terminated your\nservices on account of your non performance. What do you\nsay?\nAns:-It may be the view of A1. But he has performed\nhis professional duties punctually.\nThe check period in the present case is from\n01.07.1991 to 30.04.1996. He did not participate in the\nsale transaction pertaining to property No.31-A, Poes\nGarden, Chennai. He had not produced copy of the sale\ndeed Ex.P1 dated 22.07.1991 before the Income Tax\nAuthorities. But the previous auditor might have produced\nthat document. He does not know that property No.36,\nPoes Garden, Chennai stood in the name of Natyakala\nNiketan represented by N.R. Sandhya and Jayalalitha. He\nhas not seen copy of the license issued by the local\nauthority permitting renovation of the building in No.36,\nPoes Garden, Chennai. He could not say that as to when\nexactly the renovation was started in the above property.\nHe also could not say the date on which the said\nrenovation work was completed. He has not seen any\ncompletion certification issued after the said renovation\nwork in respect of the above property No.36, Poes Garden.\nHe has not seen the copy of the license issued by the\nlocal authority for the construction of building in No.31-A,\nPoes Garden. He also knows the exact date on which the\nsaid work of construction was commenced and the date on\nwhich the said work of construction was commenced and\nthe date on which the said work was finished. He has not\nseen completion certification in respect of the building\nconstructed in property No.31-A, Poes Garden.\nHe has not seen the license issued for the\nconstruction of the Farm House in the Grape Garden in\nJedi Metla property of A1 near Hyderabad. He does not\nknow the exact date on which the construction work of\nsaid farm house was commenced and the date on which\nthe said work was completed.\nHe has seen the deeds of partnership pertaining to\nM/s.

Jaya Publications and\nM/s Sasi Enterprises along with A2 Sasikala. He does not\nknow that except Ex.P995 no other General Power of\nAttorney had been executed by A1. Ex.P995 had been\nexecuted by A1 in respect of the business of M/s. Jaya\nPublications.

The third\nparty has marked Exs.X.1 to X.25.\nThe trial Court at paragraph-9 of the judgment has\nobserved that criminal law was set into motion against A-1\nby PW.232- Dr.Subramanian Swamy, the then President of\nJanata Dal. He lodged a complaint before the Court of\nPrincipal Sessions Judge, Madras, on 14.06.1996 under\n\nSection 200\nof Cr.P.C. It is alleged that A-1 after assuming\nthe Office of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu acquired\nproperties and earned income disproportionate to her\nknown source of income. Wealth declared during 1989-90\nwas nil. It increased to Rs.1.89 crore in 1990-91; to Rs.\n2.60 crore in 1991-92; to Rs.5.82 crore in 1992-93; to\nRs.91.33 crore in 1993-94, Rs.38.21 crore during 1994-95.\nA-1 was receiving only one rupee per month towards her\nsalary as Chief Minister. The complaint was registered as\nCrl.M.P.No.3238/1996. The learned Special Judge recorded\nthe sworn statement of the complainant vide order dated\n21.06.1996. He directed investigation under\nSection 17\nof\nthe Prevention of Corruption Act and under\nSection 202\nof\nCr.P.C. PW-240- Tmt.Letika Saran, Senior Police Officer,\nMadras, investigated the matter and collected necessary\nmaterials in a fair and impartial manner and submitted\nreport to the Court within a period of two months.\n\nWhen the inquiry was in progress, A-1 and A-2\nchallenged the order of the Principal Sessions Judge,\nMadras, before the High Court of Madras in Crl.P.\nNo.5755/1996. Vide order dated 14.08.1996, the\ninvestigation was stayed. Subsequently, vide order dated\n4.9.1996, the High Court of Madras directed the Director of\nVigilance and Anti Corruption (for short \"DV & AC\"),\nMadras, to take steps to investigate into the allegations\nmade in the complaint in accordance with law by any\nperson of his choice. That on 7.9.1996, the Director of\nVigilance and Anti Corruption, Chennai, (PW.241 -\nV.C.Perumal) directed PW.259- Sri.Nallamma Naidu,\nAdditional Superintendent of Police, DVAC, to investigate\nthe case. PW.241- V.C.Perumal registered FIR against A-1\non 18.9.1996 as per Ex.P.2266 in Crime No.13/AC/96/HQ\nunder\nSection 13 (2)\nread with\nSection 13 (1)(e)\nof\nPrevention of Corruption Act.\n\nPW.259 took up further investigation, secured search\nwarrant, conducted search of residential premises of A-1\nsituated at Nos.36 and 31-A and other locations, seized\nvoluminous documents and material objects, recorded the\nstatements of large number of witnesses. The\nincriminating evidence collected during the investigation\nreveals the complicity of A-2 to A-4 for the alleged\noffences. PW.259 made an application to the Special Judge\non 22.01.1997 as per Ex.P.2316 for adding A-2 to A-4 as\nco-accused in the crime. PW.259 laid charge sheet against\nall the accused on 4.6.1997 which came to be registered\nas Spl.C.C.No.7/1997 on the file of IX Additional Sessions\nJudge, Chennai.\n\nParagraph-12 of the impugned judgment relates to\nthe charges. It is mentioned that A-1 being a public\nservant along with A-2 to A-4 were parties to a criminal\nconspiracy with the object of acquiring and possessing\npecuniary resources of income to the extent of\nRs.66,65,20,395/- in the name of A-1 and in the names of\nyou A-2 to A-4 and in the names of A-2 to A-4 and in the\nnames of 32 business enterprises floated in the names of\nA-2 to A-4. That A-2 to A-4 abetted A-1 by holding a\nsubstantial portion of pecuniary resources and properties\nin their names. Thereby, A-1 to A-4 committed offences\npunishable under\nSection 120B\nof the Indian Penal Code\nread with\nSection 13(2)\nread with\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988.\n\nA-1 acquired and possessed in her name and in the\nnames of A-2 to A-4 pecuniary resources and properties\ndisproportionate to her known sources of income to the\nextent of Rs.66,65,20,395/-. Thereby A1 committed\noffences punishable under\nSection 13(2)\nread with\nSection\n13(1)(e)\nof Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. A-2 to A-4\nin pursuance of the criminal conspiracy, during the said\nperiod, abetted A-1 who was a public servant by\nintentionally aiding her in the possession of pecuniary\nresources and properties disproportionate to her known\nsources of income, for which he could not satisfactorily\naccount, by holding a substantial portion of the said\npecuniary resources and properties in their names and in\nthe names of the business enterprises floated in their\nnames and thereby A-2 to A-4 committed offences\npunishable under\nSection 109\nof the Indian Penal Code\nread with\nSection 13(2)\nread with\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The accused denied\nthe charges and claimed to be tried.\n\n313 statement of the accused were recorded.\nVide judgment dated 18.11.2003 in Transfer Petition\n(Criminal) Nos.77-78/2003, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia transferred the case to the State of Karnataka. The\nGovernment of Karnataka established a Special Court at\nBangalore to try the cases against A-1 to A-4.\nSpl.C.C.No.7/1997 was renumbered as\nSpl.C.C.No.208/2004 and Spl.C.C.No.2/2001 was\nrenumbered as Spl.C.C.No.209/2004.\n\nVide order dated 22.1.2010, Spl. Leave Petition\nNos.3829-3830/2005 were disposed of as withdrawn. In\nterms of this order, Spl.C.C.No.209/2004 was de-linked.\nSpl.C.C.No.208/2004 was continued.\n\nWhile examining A-2 under\nSection 313\nof Cr.P.C.,\nA-2 sought for copies of unmarked and unexhibited\ndocuments filed under\nSections 207\nand\n243(2)\nof Cr.P.C\nin I.A.No.711. This application was rejected. Against\nrejection of I.A.No.711, Crl.P.No.1840/2012 was preferred\nbefore this Court and the same came to be dismissed.\nAggrieved by the same, Crl.A.No.1497/2012 was preferred\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Apex Court\npermitted for inspection of unmarked and exhibited\ndocuments referred in I.A.711/2012. A-3 and A-4 were\nalso granted permission to inspect the documents. A-3, A-\n4 were examined under\nSection 313\nof the Cr.P.C. and\nwritten statement was filed by A-3. A-4 has not filed any\nwritten statement.\nAccused moved an application under\nSection 91\nof\nCr.P.C. seeking to summon the documents and records\nlisted in the application from the Income Tax Department\nand Registrar of Companies.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India disposed of Writ\nPetition (Crl.) No.166/2013 vide order dated 30.9.2013\nholding that the order of removal of Sri Bhavani Singh is a\nproduct of malafides and the impugned order is not\nsustainable in the eye of law and quashed the same.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 33.2 has observed that\nW.P.No.14644/1997 preferred by A-1 before the High\nCourt of Madras came to be dismissed with an observation\nthat \"a perusal of sanction proceedings themselves would\nshow that the Governor of Tamil Nadu had independently\napplied her mind to every aspect of the material and had\ngranted sanction.\" Further, the Hon'ble High Court has\nheld in the said order that, \"the impugned sanction\nproceedings to prosecute A-1 cannot be challenged in view\nof the Constitutional immunity provided under\nArticle 361\n\nof the Constitution, besides holding that, Her Excellency,\nthe Governor of Tamil Nadu is the competent authority to\nsanction the prosecution and the proceedings are in no\nway vitiated or suffer with any illegality.\" The trial Court\nheld that sanction for prosecution of A-1 is valid.\n\nA-1 approached this Court under\nSection 482\nof\nCr.P.C. seeking to quash the criminal proceedings initiated\nagainst her in Crl.P.No.79/2010. Crl.P.No.79/2010 along\nwith Misc.(Crl).731/2010 was dismissed vide order dated\n10.3.2010. Aggrieved by the same, A-1 preferred SLP\nNo.2248/2010 which was dismissed. In view of the above\norder, the objection regarding the alleged illegality in\ntaking the cognizance deserves to be dismissed as barred\nby the principle of estoppels.\n\nIn the written statement filed by A-1, A-1 has taken\nup a plea that the statements of about 300 witnesses were\nrecorded during the course of enquiry under\nSection 202\nof\nCr.P.C. The statements of 300 witnesses ought to have\nformed part of the documents supplied to the Court along\nwith Final Report under\nSection 173(5)(b)\nof the Cr.P.C.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 34.9 has observed that\nthe accused do no dispute that the inquiry initiated in\nCrl.M.P.No.3238/1996 under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. was\nmerged with Spl.C.C.No.7/1997 as per the orders dated\n26.6.1997 passed by the XI Additional Judge/Spl.Judge,\nChennai-1. It has come in evidence that pursuant to the\norders passed by the Principal Sessions Judge, P.W.259\nconducted the investigation in both the proceedings\nsimultaneously and submitted the charge sheet on\n4.6.1997. The report of the inquiry was submitted to the\nCourt on 17.6.1997 and is marked as Ex.P.2320. In the\ncross-examination of P.W.259 at para-29, it is elicited that\nthe documents produced before the Chennai Metropolitan\nPrincipal Sessions Judge were sent to the Special Court\nwhich means that all the documents collected by PW.259\nduring the inquiry under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. were\nforwarded to the Court. Therefore, the contention of the\nlearned counsel for the accused that the documents which\nwere collected during inquiry under\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C.\nwere not made part of the final report is factually\nincorrect. Even accepting for the sake of argument that\nthe material collected during the inquiry under Section 202\nis relied on by PW.241 for the purpose of registering the\nFIR, it cannot be considered as material irregularity much\nless an illegality which has the effect of nullifying the trial.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 35.17 of the judgment\nhas observed in the case in hand, it is proved in evidence,\nPW.259 was initially authorized by PW.240 as required\nunder II Proviso to\nSection 17\nof the Act as per Ex.P.2265.\nThis authorization was in force until PW.241 issued\nauthorization as per Exs.P.2308 and P.2309. It was\nargued by the learned counsel for A-1 that authorisations-\nExs.P.2308 and P.2309 were got up later. There is nothing\nin the evidence to indicate that Exs.P.2308 and P.2309\nwere fabricated by PW.259. Accused did not recall PW.241\nto confront the above documents so as to impeach the\ntestimony of PW.259. The prosecution has marked 14\nauthorizations issued by PW.241 under\nSections 17\nand\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act as per Exs.P.2267 to\nP.2271 and Ex.P.2272 series. It is important to note that\nthe copies of all these authorizations are marked to\nTr.N.Nallamma Naidu and to the Principal Sessions and\nSpecial Judge, Chennai. If PW.241 had not appointed\nTr.Nallamma Naidu as Investigating Officer as now sought\nto be contended, there was no necessity for PW.241 to\nmark the copies of these authorizations to PW.259. This is\none of the strong circumstances to indicate that PW.241\nhad issued the authorizations to PW.259 as contended by\nthe prosecution.\n\nIt is also necessary to note that Ex.P.2308 is dated\n18.09.1996 and it is issued by PW.241 under his signature\nin exercise of the powers conferred under second proviso\nto\nSection 17\nof the Act. Ex.P.2309 is also dated\n18.9.1996 and it is issued in exercise of the powers under\n\nSection 18\nof the Act. Both these documents are signed\nand dated by PW.241 whose signatures tally with his\nsignatures found in Exs.P.2267 and P.2272. The reasons\nfor issuance of the authorizations are clearly spelt out in\nExs.P.2308 and P.2309. All these circumstances therefore\nlead to the definite conclusion that, these authorizations\nwere issued by PW.241 in fulfillment of the requirement of\n\nSections 17\nand\nof the Act.\n\nIn appreciating evidence, it is relevant to note that\nthe chief-examination of PW.241 was recorded on\n17.8.2000 and he was cross-examined on 29.1.2003 and\nby then, A-1 had assumed the Office of the Chief Minister.\nIt is seen from the records that there were serious\nallegations of subversion of justice which lead to transfer\nof the case to the State of Karnataka. The change of\nstance of PW.241 during the cross-examination has to be\nunderstood in this background. A reading of the cross-\nexamination of PW.241 undoubtedly indicate that PW.241\nhas buckled under pressure and has disowned his own\ntestimony and denied the documents executed by him in\nhis official capacity. In any case, the hostile testimony\ngiven by PW.1 in this regard being inconsistent to the facts\nestablished by the prosecution and the unimpeachable\ndocumentary evidence produced before the Court, the\nabove portion of the testimony of PW.241 does not lead to\nthe conclusion that PW.259 had no authorization to\nconduct the investigation as contended by the accused.\nThus, on cumulative consideration of the testimony of\nPW.240, PW.241 and PW.259 coupled with the\ndocumentary evidence discussed above, I do not have any\nhesitation to hold that PW.259 was duly authorized to\ninvestigate the offence as per\nSections 17\nand\nof the\nAct and the said authorizations are in accordance with the\nprovisions of\nSections 17\nand\nof the Act.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.4 has observed that\nthe accused were even examined under\nSection 313\nof the\nCr.P.C. before the transfer of the case to the State of\nKarnataka in 2003 and the accused did not even raise a\nlittle finger complaining any ambiguity in the charge. On\nthe other hand after the transfer of the case, the accused\nthemselves have examined as many as 99 witnesses and\nhave produced voluminous documents in support of their\ndefence which include documents relating to the properties\nstanding in the names of the 32 firms or companies named\nin the charge sheet making it evident that they were\nposted with all necessary particulars regarding the name\nand constitution of the firms/companies. In the course of\nputting questions to the accused in their examination\nunder Section 313 before the Bangalore Court, all the\nnecessary information regarding the allegations which\nconstitute the basis for the above charges have been\nconveyed. More importantly, A-1 to A-3 have filed detailed\nstatement under Section 243(1), wherein, the accused\nhave taken specific defence in respect of each items of\nAnnexures - I to VII including the properties standing in\nthe name of the firms and companies. Therefore, I do not\nfind any propriety on the part of the accused now to\ncontend that they are misled by the charges framed by the\nCourt by not furnishing the details of the 32\nfirms/companies.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.5 has observed that\nviewed from another angle, the wordings of the charge on\nthe face of it give a clear indication of the acts committed\nby the accused during the check period pursuant to the\nalleged criminal conspiracy and abetment i.e. the\nacquisition and possession of assets either in their names\nor in the name of the firms or company. There may be\nsome dispute as to whether the companies were floated by\nany of the accused as alleged by the prosecution as the\nevidence indicate that all these companies were\nincorporated earlier to the check period. But the charge\nhaving been framed on the basis of the accusations\ncontained in the charge sheet and the accompanying\ndocuments the correctness of the charge cannot be\nchallenged on that count. The charge as framed indicates\nthat, there was only one object of the conspiracy and that\nwas to acquire assets for and on behalf of A-1. The\nargument of the learned counsel that the dominant object\nof the conspiracy was not within the knowledge of A-3 and\nA-4 as most of the properties were purchased by them\nsubsequent to 1994, does not alter the nature of the\ncharge. The particulars as to time, place and the nature of\nthe offence is clearly spelt out in the charge as required\nunder Section 212 and the name of the offence with\nreference to the provisions of the statute is also stated\ntherein in compliance with the requirements of Section 213\nof the Code. There is no requirement under law to specify\nthe individual instances of acquisitions or the modus-\noperandi adopted by the accused to effectuate the\nconspiracy. Moreover, the nature of the offence is such\nthat all the particulars of the transactions as sought for by\nthe accused cannot be furnished in the charge. When\nconspiracy is alleged, act of one conspirator becomes the\nact of the other. Therefore, there is no necessity to\nspecify the individual properties or assets held by the\nindividual accused. The charge as framed informs the\naccused not only the offence for which he or she is\nproposed to be tried but also refers to the acquisitions\nmade by them in the manner stated in the charge during\nthe check period pursuant to the conspiracy in furtherance\nof the same transaction. Therefore the argument of the\nlearned counsel that the charge in question is misleading\nand is contrary to the provisions of the code cannot be\naccepted.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.6 of the judgment\nhas observed that the above argument appears to have\ncanvassed by misreading the charge and on the erroneous\nassumption that the prosecution case is based on the\npremise that the assets of non public servant are\nattributed to the public servant. But it is not so. The\nassets of the non public servant are not attributed to A-1\nas contended by the learned counsel, rather the case of\nthe prosecution is that, all the acquisitions made by the\naccused during the check period in their names either in\ntheir individual capacity or as partners of the firms or\nDirectors of the Company are the disproportionate assets\nof A-1. The accused have very well understood the charge\nin this manner and have let in evidence in disproof of this\ncharge. This is evident from the conduct of the accused\nright from the date of framing the charge i.e., 06.10.1997\ntill the conclusion of arguments, the accused did not raise\nany objection regarding charge either before this court or\nbefore the High Court or the Supreme Court even though\nthe matter has traveled to the superior courts umpteen\nnumber of times during the last 16 years. All these\ncircumstance go to show that there has been no defect in\nthe charge and the accused were not subjected to any\nprejudice as now sought to be contended.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.7 of the judgment\nhas observed that it is not the defence of the accused that\nthey were not constituents of any of the 32 firms or the\ncompanies at any point of time. If the accused were not\ninvolved in any of the firms or the companies listed in the\ncharge sheet, accused would have been justified in\ncontending that they are seriously prejudiced by the\ncharge as framed. The very fact accused have taken up a\nspecious plea that they have already resigned from the\ndirectorship of the companies and therefore, they are not\nliable to answer the acquisitions made in the name of the\nrespective companies, there is no basis or justification for\nthe accused to contend that by not specifying the name of\nthe firms or the company they are disadvantaged or\nprejudiced in their defence. This argument suffers from\ninherent contradictions apart from being contrary to the\nfacts of the case.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.8 of the judgment\nhas observed that the whole object of the charge is to\ninform both the prosecution and the accused particularly,\nof the accusation the prosecution has to establish and the\naccused has to meet. So long as the accused knows fully\nthe accusation he has to meet, any error in the narrative\nof the charge does not become fatal to the trial. Section\n215 of the Code saves the trial from being vitiated unless\nof course the accused has been prejudiced and failure of\njustice has taken place. In the instant case accused have\nnot been able to point out any such instance or\ncircumstance which could be termed as 'prejudice' leading\nto miscarriage of justice. Therefore viewed from any\nangle, I do find any reason to uphold the contention urged\nin this regard.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 36.9 of the judgment\nhas held that the charges framed against the accused are\nin accordance with the requirement of the Code and do not\nsuffer from any vice or illegality as contended by the\naccused. By the said charges the accused are clearly\ninformed about the offence for which they are tried and\nthe necessary facts constituting the offence under\nSections\n,\n120-B\nof the Indian Penal Code read with\nSection\n13(1)(e)\nread with\nSection 13(2)\nof the Prevention of\nCorruption Act have been conveyed to them and accused\nhave not only understood the charge but have availed full\nopportunity to defend them. For all these reasons the\nobjection raised in this regard is hereby rejected.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 37.6 of the judgment\nobserved that merely because the properties in question\nare registered in the name of some Companies cannot be a\nground to hold that the inclusion of the said properties as\nthe assets of the accused is contrary to law or procedure\nas sought to be contended.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 37.8 of the judgment\nhas observed that it is trite law that jurisdiction of the\ncriminal Court extends over crime and the criminal. The\nquestion of trying the Company or its Director would arise\nonly if the offence is alleged to have been committed by\nthe Company or its Directors rendering them liable for\nprosecution. In the instant case, there is no allegation of\nany offence being committed by the Companies. The\nprosecution is launched on the basis of the accusation that,\nA-2 to A-4 have floated these companies in order to\nfacilitate the acquisition and possession of properties for\nand on behalf of A-1. If the prosecution is able to\nestablish that the said acquisitions were made solely and\nexclusively by A-2 to A-4, without any involvement of the\nCompanies, without the funds of the companies and that\nthe properties in question were never treated as the\nproperties of the said Companies, there is no reason why\nthe Companies should be made parties to the prosecution\nmerely because accused used the name of the Companies\nas a cover or camouflage to justify the wrongs committed\nby them. The doctrine of lifting the corporate veil would\ncome into play in such circumstances. Whether the\nprosecution would be able to prove this aspect of the case\nand whether the evidence on record is sufficient to record\na finding in this regard is a different matter altogether. As\nlong as the prosecution case is rested on the allegations\nthat A-2 to A-4 acquired the properties in question in the\nname of the Companies, in my opinion, the said\nCompanies do not require to be made parties to the\nprosecution launched against A-2 to A-4. For example, if a\npublic servant enters into a conspiracy with a non-public\nservant to acquire illegal assets and the non-public servant\nacquires the property and registers it in the name of his or\nher minor nephew, the said minor need not be made a\nparty to the criminal proceedings launched against public\nservant, unless the beneficiary thereof is also accused of\nabetment or conspiracy.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 37.9 of the judgment\nobserved that the argument of the learned Counsel that in\nthe event of the criminal court ultimately deciding to pass\nan order for forfeiture of the properties it would impinge\nupon the Constitutional right of the Companies guaranteed\nunder\nArt. 300A\nof the Constitution is misconceived,\npremature and without any substance. The provisions of\nthe Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 1944 provides\nfor effective remedy to third parties whose properties are\nattached in connection with prosecution of the offence\nunder the Act. It is borne on record that all the companies\nnamed in the charge sheet have taken recourse to the\nprovisions of\nSec.5\nof the Criminal Law (Amendment)\nOrdinance, 1944 and an adverse order has been passed\nagainst the companies holding that the properties involved\nin this proceedings standing in the name of the respective\ncompanies are not acquired out of the lawful resources of\nthe companies and the consideration paid thereon do not\nrepresent the funds of the said companies. In this context\nit is pertinent to refer to another decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the case of Biswanath\nBhattacharya vs. Union of India, AIR 2014 S.C. 1003\nwherein, it is held, \"If a subject acquires property by\nmeans which are not legally approved sovereign would be\nperfect and justified to deprive such persons of the\nenjoyment of such ill-gotten wealth. There is a public\ninterest in ensuring the persons who cannot establish that\nthey have legitimate sources to acquire the assets held by\nthem do not enjoy such wealth.\" In the light of the above\nfactual and legal position, the contention urged by the\naccused in this regard is liable to be rejected and is\naccordingly rejected.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 38 of the judgment has\nobserved that coming to the last contention urged by the\nlearned counsel for the accused that the proceedings were\nlaunched against them out of political vendetta at the\ninstance of the political opponent of A-1 is concerned, it\nshould be noted that this contention is already rejected by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India while dealing with the\nTransfer petition No.77-78 of 2003. Observing that the\nsaid argument is an argument of despair, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has held in the order dated 18.11.2003\nthat \"In a democracy, the political opponents play an\nimportant role both inside and outside the House. They\nare the watchdogs of the Government in power. It will be\ntheir effective weapon to counter the misdeeds and\nmischievous of the Government in power. They are the\nmouthpiece to ventilate the grievances of the public at\nlarge, if genuinely and unbiasedly projected. In that view\nof the matter, being a political opponent, the petitioner is\nvitally interested party in the run of the Government or in\nthe administration of criminal justice in the State.\"\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 39 of the judgment has\ndealt with charges and points for consideration. The\npoints for consideration are as under:\n\n1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond\nall reasonable doubt that A-1, being a\npublic servant acquired and possessed in\nher name and in the names of A-2 to A-4\nand in the names of business enterprises\nfloated in their names, pecuniary\nresources and assets of the value of\nRs.66,65,20,395/- disproportionate to her\nknown source of income during the check\nperiod from 01.07.1991 and 30.04.1996,\nwhich she could not satisfactorily account?\n\n2. Whether the prosecution further proves\nbeyond reasonable doubt that A-1 to 4\nwere parties to a criminal conspiracy with\nthe object of acquiring and possessing\npecuniary resources and assets to the\nextent of Rs.66,65,20,395/- in the names\nof A-1 and in the names of A-2 to 4 and\nthe 32 business enterprises floated in the\nnames of A-2 to 4 and thereby committed\nthe offence punishable u/Sec. 120-B of\n\nIndian Penal Code\nR/w.\nSec.13 (2)\nR/w.\n\nSec. 13 (1) (e)\nof Prevention of Corruption\nAct, 1988?\n\n3. Whether the prosecution further proves\nbeyond all reasonable doubt that A-2 to A-\n4 abetted the commission of the above\noffence by intentionally aiding A-1 in the\nacquisition and possession of pecuniary\nresources and properties disproportionate\nto her known source of income by holding\nsubstantial portion thereof in their names\nand in the names of 32 business\nenterprises floated in the names of A-2 to\nA-4, rendering them liable for conviction\nfor the offence punishable u/Sec. 109\n\nIndian Penal Code\nR/w.\nSec. 13(2)\nR/w.\nSec.13(1)(e)\nof Prevention of Corruption\nAct, 1988?\n\n4. What order?\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 42 of the judgment has\ndealt with the check period. The check period is from\n1.7.1991 to 30.4.1997.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 42.2 of the judgment\nhas observed that In the instant case, the prosecution has\nplaced before the Court the details of all the assets and\nproperties held by the accused right from the year 1970\nand has taken into account the income derived from these\nproperties in the form of rentals, interest from deposits,\nagricultural income etc., in order to enable the court to\nhave a fair view of the controversy seized by the Court.\nThere is no argument from any quarters that the choice of\nthe check period has caused any prejudice or disadvantage\nto the accused in any manner. Hence, in my view, the\nperiod of 5 years selected by the prosecution is reasonably\nsufficient to give a fair and comprehensive picture of the\nknown source of income and pecuniary resources and\nproperty in the possession of the accused so to arrive at a\nfair decision on the issues involved in these proceedings.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 43 of the\njudgment has dealt with the assets of the accused at the\ncommencement of the check period and has re-produced\nAnnexure-I marked as Ex.P.2327.\nANNEXURE - I\n(ASSETS AS ON 1.7.1991)\n\nSl.

No. 38671 of Canara\nBank, Kellys in the name of Selvi\nJ. Jayalalitha\nGrand Total\notal 2,01,83,956.53\n\nA bare perusal of Annexure-I indicates that the\nprosecution has furnished the details of theproperties\ninherited by A-1 from her deceased mother N.R. Sandhya\nand also the properties acquired by her prior to the check\nperiod either in her individual name or in partnership with\nA-2. Annexure-I also contains the list of movables and\nthe value thereof and cash balance in her bank account\nas on 01.07.1991 including the value of the gold and\nsilver articles. These particulars indicate that A-1 was\npossessed with substantial means even before the check\nperiod. It is also relevant to note that the value of the\nimmovable property is determined on the basis of the\nactual consideration shown in the respective deeds and\nnot on the basis of the market value of the properties as\non the date of the Charge Sheet. Hence, the accused\ncannot have any grouse regarding the valuation of these\nassets as stated in Annexure-I.\n\nHowever, in her written statement A-1 has taken up\na plea that the very same investigating agency had\nregistered another case against A-1 and A-2 in\nCr.No.14/AC/97/HQ, wherein, the very same investigating\nofficer PW.259 had computed the value of the total assets\nat Rs.2,64,26,295.13 and therefore, the difference of\nRs.62,42,338.60 should be added to the total value of the\nassets possessed by her at the beginning of the check\nperiod.A-2 in her written statement has taken up a plea\nthat the number of jewellery shown in item No.45 should\nbe 96 instead of 62. Further, she has contended that, in\nthe Final Report filed by D.V. & A-C. in the earlier\ncomplaint, the amount available with A-2 was shown as\nRs.9,35,000/-. The opening cash balance available was at\nRs.5,69,014/-. Hence, the cash on hand amounting to\nRs.15,14,014/- ought to have been included in Annexure-\nI.\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 43.5 of the\njudgment has observed that it is really shocking to note\nthat the Dy.S.P. of DV & AC., who is the complainant in\nthis case has given evidence on behalf of the accused.\nThough it is submitted that, the D.V. & A-C. has produced\nthe above documents pursuant to the summons issued by\nthe Court, it is surprising to note that, the D.V. & A.C has\nproduced only the xerox copy of the order said to have\nbeen passed by the Spl. Judge, Chennai dt. 24.01.2005 in\nCr.No.14/AC/97/HQ (R.C.63/97/ Misc/HQ) knowing fully\nwell that xerox copy is inadmissible in evidence. It is\nmarked as Ex.D.373. By the said order, the Spl. Judge is\nseen tohave accepted the final Report and closed the case\non 24.01.2005. I fail to understand why the certified\ncopies of these documents could not have been produced\nby the accused, instead of summoning DW.99, when it is\nthe case of the accused that the complaint registered\nagainst A-1 and A-2 at the instance of the D.V. & A.C.\ncame to be closed by orders of the court.\n\nBe that it may, based on the Final Report Ex.D.372,\nthe learned Counsel for A-1 has now put forth a contention\nthat the very same investigating officer, having submitted\na report to the effect that, A-1 and A-2 were in possession\nof total assets of Rs.2,64,26,295.13 as on 30.01.1991 this\nfigure ought to have been taken into account for the\npurpose of fixing the value of the assets held by the\naccused at the commencement of the check period. I am\nnot inclined to accept this argument for the following\nreasons:\ni) From the documents produced before the\nCourt, it cannot be known whether the very\nsame Final Report now marked as D.372\nwas produced before the Court.\n\nii) The contents of the Final Report submitted\nu/Sec. 173\nCr.P.C\n. cannot be taken as a\nconclusive proof of the correctness of the\nfacts stated therein. Ex.D.372 is only the\nopinion of the investigating officer. It is not\nlegal evidence.\n\niii) From the reading of Ex.D.373 it cannot be\ngathered that, the Spl. Judge has closed\nCr.No.14/AC/97/HQ based on the very\nsame report Ex.D.372 as contended by the\naccused.\n\niv) The accused have not produced any\nindependent evidence to show that A-1 and\nA-2 were in possession of any other assets\nand pecuniary resources than those\ndescribed in Annexure-I.\n\nv) According to DW.99, Cr.No.14/AC/97/HQ\nrelates to the check period between\n01.09.1988 and 30.01.1991. Whereas, the\ncheck period in the instant case commences\nfrom 1.7.1991. Unless it is shown that all\nthe assets and pecuniary resources referred\nin Ex.D.372 were available in the same form\nand condition till 1.7.1991, the above plea\ncannot be accepted. In this context it is\npertinent to note that in her written\nstatement filed u/Sec. 313\nCr.P.C\n., A-1 has\ncontended that the variation in the items of\njewellery is on account of remaking of old\njewellery into new patterns. This\nstatementimplies that the subject matter of\nEx.D.372 were not available in the same\nform and extent as on 1-7-1991. That\napart, accused have not produced any\nindependent evidence to show that they\nwere in possession of cash and other items\nof property as on 1.7.91 as claimed by A-2.\nTherefore, for want of necessary material in proof of\nthe above contention, we have to proceed on the basis\nthat at the commencement of the check period as on\n1.7.1991, the total value of the assets and pecuniary\nresources found in the possession of A-1 and A-2 is of the\nvalue of Rs.2,01,83,956.53 as described in Annexure-I.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 44 of the\njudgment has dealt with the income of the accused and at\nparagraph 45 of the judgment has dealt with the\nobjections of the accused.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 45 of the\njudgment has observed that A-1 has taken up a plea\nduring her examination u/Sec. 313\nCr.P.C\n. and in the\nwritten statement filed u/Sec. 243(1)\nCr.P.C\n. that the\nfollowing income has not been taken into account by the\nprosecution, viz.:\n(a) Cash on hand-Rs.8,56,365/-\n(b) Advance for purchase\nof Maruti Gypsy - Rs. 2,00,000/-\n(c) Advance for 31-A\nPoes Garden - Rs. 1,00,000/-\n\nFurther, she has contended that, while computing\nthe income by way of interest during the check period,\nD.V. & A.C. has not taken into account the large amounts\nreceived by her by way of interest amounting to\nRs.78,20,657/- as per her Income Tax returns filed and\naccepted by the Department.\n45.1) A-1 has further contended that she owned for\na long time a grape garden at Hyderabad purchased by\nher in 1968. It had large number of grape vines fully\ngrown and yielding, besides a large number of fruit\nbearing trees. She had been receiving and declaring the\nincome from the same in her Income Tax returns even\nbefore the check period which was duly accepted by the\nDepartment.\n\n45.2) Nextly, it is contended that, during her\nbirthdays, AIADMK Party cadres, out of respect and\nadmiration, used to give presents by way of cash and\ndrafts. On her 44th birthday in February 1992, she received\na total amount of Rs.2,15,00,012/- (Rupees Two Crores\nFifteen Lakhs and Twelve) by way of gifts. Besides the\nabove, a foreign remittance of Rs.77,52,591/- was also\nreceived by her.5.3) A-2 Sasikala has taken up specific plea\nregarding the income received by her during the check\nperiod as under:\n\n1.

Hence, it is necessary to\nresolve the controversy by examining the material\nproduced before the Court by both the parties.\n\n46.2) In support of its case, the prosecution has\nexamined PW.165, 166 and 256 and has relied on Ex.X-23\nand Ex.P.938. PW.165 Tmt. K.R. Latha, is the Horticultural\nOfficer in the office of the Asst. Director of Horticulture,\nRangareddy District in Andhra Pradesh. According to this\nwitness, as per the directions of the Asst. Director of\nHorticulture, on 10.12.1996 she proceeded to a garden at\nJ.D.Metla in Rangareddy District belonging to A-1 along\nwith the Horticulture Officer Sri. Sanjay Kumar. The\nDy.S.P. Vigilance and Anti Corruption, Chennai, by name\nKadireshan (PW.256) was also present and in his presence\nsheinspected the Horticultural crops raised in the said\ngarden. There were two varieties of grapes raised in the\nsaid garden viz., Anab-E-Shahi and seedless variety. The\nfirst type of grapes were found cultivated in 3.02 acres.\nShe could find 580 plants. The space occupied for raising\nthe said variety of grape for each crop was 15 x 15 feet.\nShe saw 1266 plants of seedless grapes in 1.84 acres. The\nspace occupied for raising the said variety was 7.5 x 8\nfeet. Apart from the grape vine, she saw crops such as\nguava in 96 numbers in 0.89 acres and vegetable crops\nsuch as bitter-gourd, coccinea, brinjal and other cucurbits.\nAlong the path ways and boundaries coconut trees and\npomegranate, banana, sitaphal, papaya trees and some\nroses were seen. She furnished the above details to the\nAsst. Director as well as to PW.256. She further deposed\nthat she was in the garden for two days for the purpose of\ninspection. Apart from the plants, two buildings, one old\nand a new building were also found in the property.\n\n46.3) In the cross-examination it is elicited that\nPW.165 was directed to inspect the garden by Mr. P.\nKondareddi, the Asst. Director. In the cross-examination\nshe identified the requisition given to the Asst. Director as\nper Ex.X-23. It is further elicited that neither PW.165 nor\nSanjay Kumar gave any notice to the occupants. However,\nit is elicited that there were 2 or 3 workers in the garden\nduring her visit. It is alsoelicited that the garden is\nsurrounded by a compound wall and one could gain entry\nonly through a gate. When it was specifically suggested to\nPW.165 that agricultural crops are different from\nhorticultural crops, the witness answered that raising\ncoconut crops and vegetable crops are horticultural crops.\nIt is further elicited that the entire extent of the garden\nwas 16 acres and during their visit, they did not seek the\nhelp of the Sarpanch. The garden was identified by\nPW.256. During their inspection, they did not refer any\nrevenue records. She reiterated in the cross-examination\nthat in her report she has given the particulars of the\nvegetables and the plants observed by her.\n\n46.4) PW.166 P. Kondareddy, the Asst. Director of\nHorticulture has corroborated the testimony of PW.165\nstating that on 9.12.1996, PW.256 visited his office with\nthe requisition to inspect the garden belonging to A-1\nsituated at J.D.Metla village. After getting oral permission\nfrom his superior officers, he deputed two Horticultural\nOfficers to make the inspection and after receiving the\nreport from them, he also visited the said garden. He\nworked out the details regarding the cost of raising the\ncrops, gross and net income for raising the grapes and\nsubmitted the report to the Director of Horticulture as per\nEx.P.938. In his chief-examination, this witness specifically\ndeposed that he is competent to assess the fixing of unit\ncost for raising various cropsincluding grapes. He further\nstated that, as an Asst. Director of Horticulture, his duty\nwas to supervise the work done by horticulture officers,\npreparation of project reports and also to prepare the\nassessment report for compensation to be paid to the\nfarmers. He used to follow NABARD's norm fixed for\ncommercial fruit crops. From his experience, he can also\nassess the cost of cultivation, gross, net income of seedless\nvariety and anab-e-shahi variety of grapes. According to\nthis witness, the age of the seeded crop variety found in\nthe garden was 15 years and the age of the seedless\nvariety was four years. By adopting NABARD norms the\ncost of the cultivation and yield was assessed by him. The\ntotal income of seeded variety for the above period 1991-\n96 was Rs.3,82,420/- and for the seedless variety from\n1993 to 96, the net income was Rs.2,18,960/-. He further\ndeposed that he assessed liberally for arriving at the above\ncalculation.\n\n46.5) In the cross-examination it is brought out that\nhe did not enclose the inspection report of Tr. Sanjay\nKumar and Latha with the copy of Ex.P.938 given to the\npolice and that he produced Ex.P.938 before the Court\nduring his examination-in-chief. It is further elicited that\nhe furnished Ex.P.938 evaluation on the basis of the\ninspection report filed by PW.165 and Sanjay Kumar, but\nhe has not mentioned about his personal inspection in\nEx.P.938. It is also elicited thathis evaluations are only\napproximate and probable one, subject to higher or lower\nvariations. It is also elicited that he did not record any\nstatement of the local people and his evaluation is\nconfined to grape vines only. He denied the suggestion\nthat, he prepared the report only to suit the police, but\nreiterated that he prepared his report on the basis of the\nreport prepared by Latha and Sanjay Kumar.\n\n46.6) PW.256 R. Kadireshan has deposed that on\n10.12.1996 as per his request, PW.165 and Sanjay Kumar\nestimated the value of the produce of the vine yard. In the\ncross-examination, it is elicited that during the course of\ninvestigation he had gathered information as to how much\nincome is generated through grape cultivation. It is also\nelicited that vineyard is surrounded by profusely yielding\ncoconut trees and vegetables were also cultivated there.\nHe made enquiries with ten people who worked and lived\nthere. Further, to manage the grape cultivation, Manager\nand his assistants were residing in the vine yard and he\ninspected the accounts of the income and expenditure, but\ndid not seize those records. The photographs of the\nvineyard and the buildings at Hyderabad were taken by\nthe officials belonging to the Police Department.\n\n46.7) The learned Counsel for the A-1 has strongly\nassailed the testimony of the above witnessescontending\nthat the report Ex.P.938 is not worthy of acceptance. It\nwas not enclosed with the final report. PW.166 has\nadmitted that he produced the said report on the date of\nhis examination before the Court on 25.05.2000 and there\nis no explanation by the prosecution as to why the said\nreport was not produced along with the Charge Sheet.\nThat apart, PW.166 has admitted in the cross-examination\nthat the evaluation made by him are only approximate and\nprobable and therefore, the report submitted by this\nwitness even if accepted cannot be treated as the report of\nan expert to determine either the cost of the grape\nproduce or the age of the plants. Likewise, the testimony\nof PW.165 also cannot be given any credence as the\nprosecution has not produced the report purported to have\nbeen submitted by her to PW.166.\n\n46.8) In support of the contention urged by A-1 that\nthe agricultural income derived by her from the grape\ngarden is more than the amount computed by the\ninvestigating agency, the learned Counsel has placed\nreliance on the income tax returns submitted by A-1 for\nthe year 1987-88 to 1992-93, and has emphatically\nsubmitted that the assessing officer had accepted the\nreturn of agricultural income submitted by A-1 and had\nfinalized the assessment u/Sec. 143(3) of the\nIncome Tax\nAct\nby accepting the agricultural income for the year 1992-\n93 at Rs. 9,50,000/-. It is the submission ofthe learned\nCounsel that, though at the instance of D.V. & A-C., the\nsaid assessment was reopened in the year 1998 and the\nassessing officer by his order dt. 28.03.2000 determined\nthe agricultural income for the year 1992-93 at\nRs.5,63,440/-, the appeals preferred by A-1 ultimately\ncame to be allowed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal\nholding that the reopening of the assessment was\nunjustified, as a result, the income returned by the A-1 for\nthe assessment year 1992-93 at Rs.9,50,000/- stood\naccepted by the Income Tax Authorities. The learned\nCounsel further submitted that in respect of the\nassessment year 1993-94, for some fault of the auditor,\nthe return was not filed, but in respect of the assessment\nyear 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 returns were filed by A-1\nas per Ex.P.2173, 2175, 2176 and the agricultural income\ndeclared therein has been accepted by the Income Tax\nAuthorities by force of the order of the Appellate Tribunal\nin Ex.D.64 and hence this Court is required to accept the\nfindings of the Tribunal holding that the total agricultural\nincome derived by A-1 from the grape garden at Jeedi\nMetla, Hyderabad during the check period is\nRs.52,50,000/-.\n\n47. I have carefully considered the submissions\nmade at the Bar and have thoroughly scrutinized the oral\nand documentary evidence produced by the parties and\nhave also gone through the orders passed by theIncome\nTax Authorities on the question of the agricultural income\nof A-1. In so far as the extent of the agricultural land\nowned by A-1, there is no controversy. It is borne on\nrecord that, A-1 had inherited 14.50 acres of land at Jeedi\nMetla, Hyderabad as described in item Nos.3 and 4 of\nAnnexure-I. It is also not in dispute that A-1 had raised a\ngrape garden in the said property. It is borne on record\nthat, in the month of November, 1992 A-1 filed returns for\nthe assessment year 1987-88 to 1992-93 wherein, A-1\ndeclared the estimated agricultural income as under :\nAssessment Year Estimated Agricultural income\n\n1987-88 Rs.4,80,000\n\n1988-89 Rs.5,50,000\n\n1989-90 Rs.7,00,000\n\n1990-91 Rs.8,00,000\n\n1991-92 Rs.9,00,000\n\n1992-93 Rs.9,50,000\n\n47.1) The assessing officer finalized the assessment\nand accepted the returned agricultural income declared by\nA-1 and the assessment orders came to be passed as per\nEx.P.2123 (A/y.1987-88), Ex.P.2127 (A/Y. 1988-89)\nEx.P.2131 (Assessment year 1989-90), Ex.P.2135 (A/y.\n1990-91) Ex.P.2139 (A/y. 1992-93). The assessment\ndetails are as under:\n\nAssessment Date of Date of Returned\nYear filing the assessment agri.\nreturns of Income/Asse\n/total order/asses ssed agri.\nincome sed Total Income.\nreturned Income\n1987-88 13.11.1992 23.12.1994 Rs.4,80,000\nRs.26,850 Rs.9,29,080 Rs.4,80,000\n1988-89 13.11.1992 23.11.1994 Rs.5,50,000\nRs.38,910 Rs.21,29,243 Rs.5,50,000\n1989-90 16.11.1992 13.12.1995 Rs.7,00,000\nRs.25,200 Rs.30,97,075 Rs.7,00,000\n1990-91 20.11.1992 2.3.1995 Rs.8,00,000\nRs.86,860 Rs.1,27,59,040 Rs.8,00,000\n1991-92 20.11.1992 30.3.1994 Rs.9,00,000\nRs.4,48,660 Rs.80,65,250 Rs.9,00,000\n1992-93 23.11.1992 21.3.1995 Rs.9,50,000\nRs.6,64,528 Rs.2,18,37,350 Rs.9,50,000\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 47.9 of the\njudgment has observed that It is trite law that, the\ncriminal case has to be decided on the basis of the\nevidence produced before the Court and not on the basis\nof the findings recorded by the Income Tax Authorities. I\nwill be dealing with the relevancy and admissibility of the\nassessment orders and the Income Tax proceedings while\nconsidering the objections raised by the accused in relation\nto other issues. For the present, I am of the firm view that\nthe orders passed by the Income Tax Authorities, relied on\nby A-1 cannot be taken as conclusive proof of the factum\nof cultivation and the income derived by A-1 from her\ngrape garden located at Jeedi Metla, Hyderabad. Even\notherwise, whatever evidentiary value attached to the\nIncome Tax returns relied on by the accused is seen to\nhave been taken away by the action taken by the income\ntax Authority by reopening the assessment on the ground\nthat the finalization of the assessment for the year 1987 -\n88 to 1992-93 was without any verification. Though\nultimately the Tribunal has held that reopening of the\nassessment is bad, yet the fact remains that there was no\ninquiry into the disputed issue. It is an admitted fact that\nno documentary evidence was produced by the assessee\nbefore the Income Tax Authorities to support the\nclaim.Even before this court A-1 has not produced any\nreliable and acceptable evidence in support of her claim.\n\n47.10) From the maze of evidence produced before\nthe Court, we are left with only the conflicting evidence\nwhich cannot be reconciled with each other. The evidence\nproduced by the prosecution in proof of the above fact is\nnot at all satisfactory as PW.166 has unequivocally\nadmitted in his evidence that he based his reports on the\nnotes of inspection submitted by PW.165. The said notes\nof inspection are not produced before the Court. PW.165\nhas conceded that she did not take the assistance of the\nSarpanch and did not refer to any revenue or survey\nrecords. If so, it is not known as to how she could measure\nthe extent of the area used for cultivation of each variety\nof grapes with accuracy as deposed by her. There is no\nclear and definite evidence regarding the specific extent\nused for the cultivation of grapes and for other crops.\nPW.166 has also admitted that the original report was not\nproduced along with the Charge Sheet and both the\nwitnesses admit that they did not serve any notice to the\noccupants of the garden at the time of inspecting the lands\nin question. PW.256 has unequivocally stated that, he\ninspected the account books and took photographs of the\ngarden which are not produced before the Court. These\ndocuments would have thrown light on the true state of\nfacts. More importantly, thebasis on which the yield is\ndetermined and their price is calculated by PW.166 is also\nshrouded with suspicion. PW.166 states that he applied\nNABARD method. But without there being specific evidence\nwith regard to the quantity of the yield and the rate\napplicable to the produce at the relevant point of time, the\nreport marked through PW.166 becomes unreliable.\n\n47.11) The evidence produced by A-1 is also equally\nvague and ambiguous. A-1 having sought to enhance the\nagricultural income is obligated to produce reliable and\nacceptable evidence in support of her claim. But\nunfortunately, the only evidence on which A-1 has sought\nto sustain the claim for the higher valuation of the\nagricultural income are the Income Tax returns which have\nminimal evidentiary value in determining the extent of\ncultivation, quantum of produce, cost of cultivation and the\nprice fetched by A-1 during the relevant years.\nUndisputedly, these aspects are solely within the\nknowledge of A-1. But, A-1 has failed to produce the best\nevidence available in her possession, instead, has sought\nto justify her claim on the basis of the assessment orders\nwhich were admittedly passed on the basis of best\njudgment assessment without any verification. It is not the\ncase of A-1 that she has been personally cultivating these\nlands. A-1 is a resident of Chennai and the grape garden is\nlocated in Andhra Pradesh. Naturally, A-1 might have been\ngetting theland cultivated through workers and labourers\nwho would have been the best witnesses to speak about\nthe cost of cultivation and the quantum of the yield and\nthe price prevalent at the relevant point of time. The\nlearned counsel for the accused has also not suggested to\nany of the prosecution witnesses that the land is question\nhas the potentialities of yielding the income as claimed by\nthe accused. Apart from failing to produce any direct\nevidence on her part A1 has also failed to bring on record\nany circumstance in the evidence of the prosecution\njustifying her claim. As a result there is no worthwhile\nevidence to accept the claim of A-1.\n47.12) Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that, A-1\nhas been holding 14½ acres of agricultural land wherein,\nshe has been growing grapes. Prosecution has proceeded\non the basis that grape garden is being grown in the said\nlands. The certified copies of the pahanis produced in\nevidence at Ex.P.2251 to P.2258 also corroborate the\ncontention of the accused that, grapes are grown in the\nsaid property. Therefore, merely because A-1 has failed to\nproduce documentary evidence in proof of the produce\ncollected by her during the check period and the price\nprevalent at the relevant time, her entire claim cannot be\nrejected. Therefore, taking into consideration the common\nfacts observed in the above reports that about 10 acres of\nland was being used for cultivation of grapes at the\nrelevant point oftime and having regard to the likely cost\nof cultivation and the fluctuating price prevalent during the\ncheck period, I am of the view that, it would be reasonable\nto estimate the income from the grape garden at\nRs.20,000/- per acre per annum and thus, the total\nagricultural income from the cultivation of the grape\ngarden would be Rs.2 lakhs per annum i.e., Rs.10 lakhs\nfor five years during the check period. In view of this\nfinding, the agricultural income of A-1 from the grape\ngarden is enhanced to Rs.10 lakhs from Rs.5,78,340/-\nadding the difference of Rs.4,21,660/- to item No.33.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 48 of the\njudgment deals with Gifts. On 44th Birthday of A-1, out of\nreverence and expression of love and loyalty, the party\nworkers presented her with gifts by way of cash and drafts\namounting to Rs.2,15,00,012/- and foreign remittance of\nRs.77,52,059/-.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 48.11 of\nthe judgment has observed that in paragraph 49 of chief-\nexamination of DW.64, he has stated thus:\n\n\"The Central Bureau of Investigation\ninitiatedcriminal proceedings against A-1\nJayalalitha regarding the above gift items. The\naction of the C.B.I. in initiating those proceedings\nagainst A-1 Jayalalitha was challenged by A-1\nJayalalitha before Madras High Court in a Crl.\nPetition filed used 482 of\nCr.P.C\n. The said Crl.\nProceedings came to be quashed in entirety by the\nMadras High Court.\"\n\nIn the cross-examination of DW.64, it is elicited that\nthe Income Tax returns for the assessment year 1991-92\nto 1995-96 of A-1 were filed by her previous tax\nconsultant viz., R. Rajsekhar, PW.228. The said Rajsekhar\nhad also filed wealth tax returns of A-1 for the above\nassessment years. From the above cross-examination, it\ncan be gathered that, DW.64 is not acquainted with the\ntrue facts of the case and he is incompetent to speak\nabout the alleged gifts received by A-1 or the Income Tax\nreturns said to have been filed by her, as he was not the\nauditor of A-1 at the relevant point of time.\n\n48.14) It is observed in Ex.P.2145 that \"the returns\nclaiming birthday presents were not filed in the respective\nassessment years but long after. The extent of birthday\npresents received by her during the previous year or in the\nsubsequent years is still not known. For the first four\nyears, assessment year 1987-88 to assessment year\n1990-91 cash presents are conspicuous by their absence.\nAgain, in the first three years, it is jewellery and only\njewellery. No cash, No DDs\". Therefore, considering all\nthese facts and the long delays in filing the returns, the\nCommissioner held that A-1 has not satisfactorily\ndischarged the onus of proving the receipts as birthday\npresents. It is noted therein that except the assessee's\nword, there was no other material in proof of the receipt of\nthe large amount claimed by A-1 as gifts and presents.\nThus, the Commissioner of the Income Tax PW.215\nrecorded a finding that the monies and assets representing\nthe presents and assets would constitute the appellant's\nincome from undisclosed sources within the meaning of\nSec.69 and\nSec.69-A\nof Income Tax Act.\nIn the cross-examination of PW.215, it is elicited\nthat, aggrieved by the above order, A-1 preferred an\nappeal before the Tribunal II and it is still pending. It is\nalso brought out that the wealth tax returns werefiled by\nher on 13.11.1992 and the wealth declared by her for the\nrelevant years are as under;\n\n1988-89 - Rs.53,86,200/-\n\n1989-90 - Rs. 80,17,700/-\n\n1990-91 - Rs.1,88,75,400/-\n\n1991-92 - Rs.2,60,55,750/-\n\n1992-93 - Rs. 5,81,94,815/-\n48.15) It is now well settled that, the receipt of\nmoney or pecuniary resources in order to qualify as\n\"income\" within the meaning of\nSec. 13 (1) (e)\nof the Act,\nas observed in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh vs.\nAwadh Kishore Gupta, \"qua the public servant,\ntheincome would be what is attached to his office or post,\ncommonly known as remuneration or salary\". In thevery\nsame decision it is explained that though \"income\" is\nreceipt in the hands of its recipient, every receipt would\nnot partake the character of income. A receipt from\nwindfall, or gains of graft, crime or immoral secretions by\npersons prima facie would not be receipt from the \"known\nsource of income\" of a public servant.\n\n48.16) Though the receipt of birthday presents by\nthemselves may not amount to windfall or immoral\nsecretions, but in the facts of the present case, when A-1\nclaims to have received huge sum of Rs.2 crores and\nforeign remittance as presents and gifts after sheassumed\nthe office of the Chief Minister creates serious doubts and\nsuspicion about the character of the funds received by her.\nNaturally, a question arises in the mind, if her persona\nattracted such huge presents from her party loyalists why\nwas the practice discontinued after 1992? Would she have\nreceived similar admiration in cash and kind from her\nparty workers if she was out of office? It is not her case\nthat it was her professional income. All these questions\nmilitate against the claim put forward by A-1. No doubt it\nis true large number of her party workers have turned up\nto depose in her favour and have identified some D.Ds\nproduced before the court, but even if their evidence is\naccepted on its face value, the receipt of alleged presents\nbeing illegal, their testimony does not render it legal. It is\nheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that:\n\n\"If public servants are allowed to acceptpresents\nwhen they are prohibited under a penalty from\naccepting bribes, they would easily curcumvent\nthe prohibition by accepting the bribe in the\nshape of a present. The difference between the\nacceptance of a bribe, made punishable u/Sec.\n161 and 165\nIPC\nis this; under the former\nsection the present is taken as a motive or\nreward for abuse of office; under the latter\nsection the question of motive or reward is\nwholly immaterial and the acceptance of a\nvaluable thing without consideration or with\ninadequate consideration from a person who has\nor is likely to have any business to be\ntransacted is forbidden because though not\ntaken as a motive or reward for showing any\nofficial favour, it is likely to influence the public\nservant to showofficial favour to the person\ngiving such valuable thing. The provisions of Ss.\n161 and 165 of\nIPC\nas also\nS.5\nof the Act are\nintended to keep the public servant free from\ncorruption and thus, ultimately ensure purity in\npublic life. The evidence in the case, therefore,\nshould have been judged keeping these aspects\nin view.\"\n\nAlleged gifts received by A-1 cannot be treated as\nlawful source of income within the meaning of\nSec. 13(1)\n(e)\nof the Act, hence the claim is disallowed.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 50 of the\njudgment has dealt with 'Namadu MGR'.\n\nIt is contended that, Jaya Publications was publishing\na daily newspaper called Namadhu MGR. It is an official\nmouth piece of AIADMK Party, of which, A-1 is the General\nSecretary. For greater dissemination of policies of the\nparty, it introduced a scheme deposit which was in vogue\nfrom 1990 onwards. The firm had been collecting deposits.\nThe total collection during check period in cash was\nRs.14.01 crore. The cash so received was not only\ndeposited in two C.A. Nos. 1952 and 2047 of Canara Bank,\na portion of the cash so collected was put into her account\nand also in the accounts of the firm, of which, she is the\npartner for better utilization of the amount so collected\nunder refundable scheme deposit. The scheme deposits\nand the monies collected was disclosed to the Income Tax\nDepartment. It was accepted after deep scrutiny. The\nappeal of the Department against the acceptance of the\nscheme deposit has been rejected by the Tribunal. Under\nthis head, A-2 has sought to include Rs.14.01,000.00\n(Rupees Fourteen Crores One Lakh only) as the income of\nA-1 and A-2.\n- Rs.14.01,000.00\n\nvi) Income earned by Jaya Publications\nfrom the Job works of printing\n& publication - Rs. 1,15,94,849.00\n\nvii) Foreign Inward Remittance\nreceived by A-2 in 1992 - Rs.51,47,955.00\n\nviii) Business income from\nMetal King\n- Rs.38,76,287.00\nix) Business income from\nVinod Video Vision - Rs.94,36,682.00\n\nx) Advance from Meadow\nAgro Farms (Pvt) Ltd., - Rs.32.09,000.00\n\nxi) Advance from River way\nAgro Products (Put) Ltd., - Rs.52,00,000.00\n\nA-3 V.N.Sudhakaran has contended that, during the\ninvestigation, the investigating officer had seized hundred\nreceipt books (Ex.P.2341 series) maintained by Super\nDuper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., containing hundred receipts each\nacknowledging the receipt of Rs.5,000/- per person.\nDuring investigation, he brought to the notice of the I.O.\nabout the income of the Super Duper Pvt. Ltd., In spite of\nsuch sufficient proof, the I.O. has deliberately failed to\ntake into consideration the income of Super Duper T.V.\nPvt. Ltd., totaling to more than Rs. 1 crore.\n\nIn order to substantiate the claim of income\ngenerated by Jaya Publications by introducing the deposit\nscheme by name NAGADHU MGR, A-1 & A-2 have let in\nfive types of evidence viz.,\n\n(i) Evidence of 31 witnesses who have\nspoken about the deposit made by them\nunder the scheme.\n\n(ii) Oral testimony of DW.88 who has spoken\nabout the application forms submitted by\nthe various subscribers.\n\n(iii)Special audit report obtained by the\nIncome Tax Authorities u/Sec. 142-2-A as\nper Ex.P.217.\n\n(iv)Orders of the Commissioner of Income\nTax (Appeals) Ex.D.231 to D.234.\n\n(v) Balance sheet filed along with the returns\nas per Ex.D.218 to D.222.\n\n50.3) The plea set up by the accused is that, ever\nsince 1990, A-1 and A-2 as partners of Jaya Publication\nreceived in all a sum of Rs.15,05,14,323.60 towards the\nscheme deposit. Out of the said amount, a sum of\nRs.13,54,000/- was collected prior to the check period.\nExcluding this amount, the total deposit collected during\nthe check period was available with the firm to the tune of\nRs.13,89,19,475/-. In order toestablish this plea, A-1 and\nA-2 have examined 31 witnesses. viz., DW.3, DW.4, DW.5,\nDW.31, DW.32, DW.33, DW.34, DW.35, DW.36, DW.37,\nDW.38, DW.39, DW.44, DW.45, DW.46, DW.47, DW.48,\nDW.49, DW.50, DW.51, DW.52, DW.53, DW.55, DW.56,\nDW.57, DW.58, DW.59, DW.60, DW.62, DW.63, DW.67.\n\n50.4) All these witnesses have given a stereotyped\nevidence before the Court stating that they are in the habit\nof reading Namadhu MGR Newspaper and they have made\ndeposit ranging from Rs.12,000/- to Rs.18,000/- to\nbecome the subscribers of the said newspaper and in\nterms of the said deposit, they are supplied with 3 to 6\ncopies of Namadhu MGR news paper daily.\n\nThe accused have examined DWs.3, 4, 5, 31, 32, 33,\n34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52,\n53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 67 in support of their\ncase.\n\n50.9) With regard to Ex.D.207, this witness admitted\nthat, there is no mention in Ex.D.217 that representatives\nof M/s. Jaya Publication produced the books of accounts\nbefore the special auditors. There isan observation in the\nsaid order that, during the said special audit to show\nreceipts through cash and bank, no supporting documents\nwere made available. This witness has given an\nexplanation that, on account of the seizure of the\ndocuments of M/s. Jaya Publication by D.V. & A.C., those\ndocuments could not be made available before the special\nauditors. He has also admitted that, in Ex.D.217, there is\nan observation that, all payments made through cash are\nnot supported by any outside document or evidence and\nthat they are only supported by internally made vouchers\nwith payee's signature. Further, it is elicited from DW.88,\nthe returns as per Ex.D.218 to D.220 are all filed on\n06.11.1998 whereas, the returns as per Ex.D.221 and\nD.222 were filed on 17.03.1998 respectively. The returns\nas per Ex.D.218 to D.222 were all prepared by DW.88. He\nhas also admitted that, Ex.D.224 to D.226do not bear the\ndate, seal and signature of the Income Tax Department.\nEx.D.228 the list of subscribers does not bear the seal and\nsignature of M/s. Jaya Publication. It does not indicate the\ndate on which the said list was prepared. The original\nsubscriptionapplications contained in Ex.D.230(1) to\nEx.D.230(17) volumes were not produced before the\nIncome Tax Authorities, but their xerox copies were\nproduced. This witness has explained in the cross-\nexamination that the originals were not produced for the\nreason that they were taken away by D.V. & A.C. When\nthe observationsmade in para 72 of Ex.D.231 were put to\nthe witness and he was questioned as to whether M/s.\nJaya Publication and Namadhu MGR newspaper are of\ndifferent entity, DW.88 answered that, Namadhu MGR is a\nnewspaper published by Jaya Publications. The further\nquestion put to the witness reads as follows:\n\n\"Question: At page 21 of the order Ex.D.223with\nreference to the deposits mentioned in the said\npage, the explanation by way of reply given by\nM/s. Jaya Publications to the Assessing Officer\nhas been extracted as under:\n\nThe previous authorized representative\nhad explained that these are all transfer from\ncurrent account of M/s. Namadhu MGR as the\nAssessee has been dealing with M/s. Jaya\nPublications and M/s. Namadhu MGR as two\nseparate divisions. Scheme deposits are\ncollected by M/s. Namadhu MGR. Perhaps so the\nAssessee's clerk is not well verse with in\naccountancy, was not knowing the account to\nwhich they are to be credited whether Namadhu\nMGR or M/s. Jaya Publication, he might have\nposted to UPL Account.\"\n\nIn view of the above reply given by the\nAssessee how do you say that Namadhu MGR\nnews paper was only published and circulated\nby M/s. Jaya Publications?\n\nAns: According to me M/s. Jaya Publications had\nincome from the sale of Namadhu MGR news\npaper, income from agricultural operations and\nrental income from properties owned by them.\nThereby the income was dealt under 3\ndivisions.\"\n\n50.10) It is further elicited that as per the Ex.D.231,\nthe Assessing Officer finalized the original assessment\nproceedings u/Sec. 144 of\nIncome Tax Act\n. On 03.03.1998\non the basis of the material available on record and the\nCommissioner of Income Tax Act (Appeals) set aside the\nassessment order on 15.09.1998 and only thereafter, M/s.\nJaya Publication filed its return of income on 06.11.1998.\nHe has also admitted that the Registrar of Newspaper for\nIndia will issue a certificate regarding the circulation of\nnewspapers. He has also admitted that, when the\nassessing officer issued notice requiring M/s. Jaya\nPublication to produce the original applications along with\nthe counter foils of deposit receipts and the concerned\nregisters, M/s. Jaya Publication did not produce those\ndocuments, but they filed only copies and those copies\nwere accepted by the Assessing Officer.\n\n50.11) Regarding the maintenance of the accounts\nof M/s. Jaya Publication, the evidence of PW.201 C.K.R.K.\nVidyasagar, an officer of Canara Bank, Mylapore Branch is\nrelevant to be considered. In his examination-in-chief from\npage 59 onwards, this witness has deposed that, the\nCurrent A/c. No. 2047 of Jaya Publication was transferred\nfrom Kellys Branch, Chennai to their Canara Bank at\nMylapore Branch on 26.09.1990. In the application the\naddress of the organization was mentioned as No.36, Poes\nGarden,Chennai-86. The copy of the application sent to\ntheir bank from Kellys Branch viz., Ex.P.1900 discloses\nthat the account opening application was signed by A-1\nand A-2 and one Dinakara and Tivakaran, the partners.\nWhile transferring the account, the bank obtained a fresh\nletter from the partners which is signed by A-1 and A-2 as\nper Ex.P.1901. The statement of the bank account ledger\nof Jaya Publication is marked through this witness as\nEx.P.1903. This statement pertains to the period from\n01.07.1991 to 11.09.1996. As per this statement, as on\n1.7.1991, the balance in his Current A/c. was\nRs.7,83,860.97 and the balance as on 30.04.1996 was\nRs.20,79,885.12. This witness has deposed in detail about\nthe remittance made to this account on several occasions\nexceeding Rs.50,000/- at a time and has further deposed\nthat from Namadhu MGR Current A/c. No. 1952, various\namounts were transferred on different dates to this\naccount No.2047 and from the Current A/c. No. 2018 held\nby A-1, a sum of Rs.50,000/- was transferred to this\naccount on 5.5.1993 and from the A/c. No.2196 of A-2, a\nsum of Rs.14,250/- was transferred to this account on\n4.5.1993. Likewise, from the account of Sasi Enterprises\n(Current A/c. No. 2061) a sum of Rs.6 lakhs on\n29.10.1993, Rs. 1 lakh on 5.11.93 were transferred to\nCurrent A/c. No. 2047. A sum of Rs.6 lakhs was\ntransferred from Vinod Video (A/c. No.2133) to the\naccount of Jaya Publication on 14.11.1994 and further,a\nsum of 10 lakhs from another account on 27.5.1992, a\nsum of Rs.10 lakhs, Rs. 3 lakhs and Rs.1 lakh on\n29.05.1992; Rs.1 lakh on 1.6.92, Rs.3,61,759.90 on\n10.11.92, Rs.1.2 lakh on 5.2.93, Rs. 1,29,448.10 on\n4.6.1993, Rs.2,45,242.50 on 7.10.1993 were credited to\nCurrent A/c. No. 2047.\n\n50.12) The interest from fixed deposit amount was\nalso credited to this account No.2047 on different dates\nand PW.201 has given the details thereof in page No.62 of\nhis deposition. This witness has also spoken about the\nwithdrawal of the amount from A/c. No.2047 on various\ndates and has also stated that on 5.8.97, 21.10.92,\n21.3.95 and 17.7.95 and 13.3.96 a sum of Rs. 6 lakhs, 3\nlakhs, 5 lakhs, 4 lakhs, 2 lakhs and Rs.2 lakhs have been\ndeducted through cheques in the name of A-1. Further,\nthis witness has stated that on 30.3.1995, from the A/c.\nNo.2047 a sum of Rs.75 lakhs was issued through a\ncheque in the name of Canfin Homes and was deducted.\nThis witness has also furnished the date of transfer of\namounts to the S.B. A/c. of A-2 (S.B. A/c. No.23218 and\nCurrent A/c. No. 2196) and also the details of the amounts\ngiven through cheques for purchasing demand drafts are\nalso narrated in detail in his evidence. What is significant\nto be noted is that, nowhere in his evidence PW. 201 has\nstated that a sum of Rs.14,10,35,000/- collected by way of\nthe deposit under the alleged scheme by A-1 and A-2\nhavebeen credited to the bank account of Jaya\nPublications. More importantly, there is not even a remote\nsuggestion to this witness that the deposit amount is\ncredited to the bank account of Jaya Publication. In the\nabove context, it is also pertinent to note that, PW.201 has\nstated in his evidence that A-2 N.Sasikala started a new\nA/c. No. 2277 as Proprietor of a Company by name Metal\nKing Company. In this account, amount was remitted by\ncash on different dates. Apart from the said remittance in\ncash, different amounts were transferred to this account\non different dates. The details of which are stated in page\n79 of his examination-in-chief. It is important to note that\nlarge sum of money is seen to have been transferred from\nthe Current A/c. No. 1952 of Namadhu MGR to the account\nof Metal King Company on different dates falsifying the\ncontention of the accused that the deposits collected from\nthe subscribers of Namadhu MGR was utilized for purchase\nof immovable properties. These transactions on the other\nhand fortify the case of the prosecution that the\nunaccounted and undisclosed funds credited into the\naccounts of Namadhu MGR were diverted to the accounts\nof Jaya Publications, Sasi Enterprises, Vinod Video, Metal\nKing and various other firms and companies, wherein, A-2\nto A-4 were either the Directors or the Partners at the\nrelevant point of time.\n\n50.13) The transaction spoken by PW.201 are\ninconsistent with the case pleaded by A-1 and A-2, on the\ncontrary, these transactions reinforce / strengthen the\ncase of the prosecution that the bank accounts maintained\nby M/s. Jaya Publication does not reflect the credit of the\ndeposits of Rs.14,10,35,000/- as claimed by A-1 and A-2.\n\n50.14) What emerges from the above evidence is\nthat, the story of the scheme deposit canvassed by the\naccused has taken birth only after filing of the Charge\nSheet. There is not even a stray evidence to suggest that\nthe said deposit scheme was in circulation any time before\nthe registration of the criminal case against the accused.\nThere is nothing in the entire evidence indicating that the\naccused had declared the said deposit before the Income\nTax Authorities any time during the check period. As\nalready narrated above, the existence of the said scheme\nwas brought to light only in the year 1998 in the returns\nfiled on behalf of the said firms. It is only after filing of the\nCharge Sheet, the accused appear to have master minded\nthe above defence with the active connivance of DW.88,\nwho claims to be the Chartered Accountant of the accused\nwith a view to create evidence in a bid to offer an\nexplanation for the huge amount of unaccounted money\nfound with A-1. But, unfortunately, the circumstances\nbrought out in the cross-examination of DW.88completely\nexpose the falsity of the defence. First and foremost, it is\nimportant to note that DW.88 is totally incompetent to\nspeak about the aforesaid scheme. According to him, he\nwas one of the partners of M/s. Nataraj Associates from\n1998-2004. Though he claims that he was attached to\nM/s. S. Venkatram and Company and in that capacity he\nhas handled the accounts of M/s. Jaya Publications and\nM/s. Sasi Enterprises, yet, in para 44 of the cross-\nexamination he has unequivocally admitted that until 1998\nneither M/s. Jaya Publications nor M/s. Sasi Enterprises\nhad filed any returns in respect of the financial affairs of\nthe said firms. In Ex.D.231, in unmistakable terms it is\nnoted that till February 1998, M/s. Rajsekhar & Co., C.A.s\nwere appointed as auditors of Jaya Publications. Under the\nsaid circumstances, the claim of DW.88 that he had\nhandled the accounts of M/s. Jaya Publications and M/s.\nSasi Enterprises falls to the ground.\n\n50.15) As already narrated above, the accused have\nnot produced any material before the Court to show that\nDr. Namadhu MGR had floated the deposit scheme inviting\nsubscription from the general public. As a matter of fact,\neven a copy of the said Namadhu MGR of the relevant\nperiod is not produced before the Court which would have\nhelped the Court in ascertaining whether the said News\nPaper is merely an official news letter of AIADMK Party or\nis meant forgeneral consumption and is sold for Re.1/- as\ncontended by the accused. It is a cardinal rule of evidence\nthat, best evidence in the possession of the party should\nbe produced before the Court. In the instant case, DW.88\nhas admitted that Namadhu MGR News Paper is registered\nwith the Registrar of Press Trust of India and it has\ncirculation crossing more than 70,000/-. If so, the\ncertificate of registration and the Register of the\nsubscribers would have been the best piece of evidence to\nsupport the claim of the accused.\n\n50.16) In appreciating the claim/ defence of the\naccused, it is pertinent to note that M/s. Jaya Publication\nwas an assessee of Income Tax with Central Circle (II) 2,\nChennai from the year 1991. According to DW.88, earlier\nto that the said firm was an Income Tax assessee with\ndifferent circle of Income Tax. It is admitted by DW.88\nthat the Income Tax returns for the assessment year\n1991-92 to 1993-94 were filed by M/s.Jaya Publications\nonly on 06.11.1998 and the Income Tax returns for the\nassessment years 1994-95, 96-97 on 17.03.1999.\nUndisputedly, much before the said date, the F.I.R. was\nregistered against A-1 and the Charge Sheet came to be\nfiled against the accused as back as on 04.10.1997. It is\nthe evidence of DW.88 that, when the assessee was\nbrought into Central Circle-II (2), Chennai, the Chief\nCommissioner of Income Tax appointed one P.B.\nVijayaraghavan, the CharteredAccountant as the Special\nAuditor for auditing the accounts of M/s. Jaya Publications\nfor the assessment year 1994-95. In the chief-\nexamination, DW.88 has stated thus:\n\n\"During the said audit I had personally\nproducedthe books of accounts of the assessee\nbefore the said special auditors. The said special\nauditors gave report in prescribed forms, on\n25.09.1998. After seeing the said report I say\nthat the cash book, bank book, journal register,\nstock register, general ledger, records for\nagricultural income viz., cash book, journal\nregister, general ledger were produced before the\nsaid auditors and they were verified by them. In\nthe records produced by Income Tax Authorities\nbefore this Court, in Volume No.8 at pages 87 to\n111 the special auditors report dt. 25.09.1998 is\nfound. It is Ex.D.217. The said special auditors\nhave certified in form No.6-B that proper books of\naccounts have been kept by the assessee. In the\nsaid special audit report there is mention about\nthe receipt of agricultural income by the\nassessee.\"\n\n50.17) As against the above evidence, the consistent\nplea taken up by the accused before this Court is that, all\nthe documents pertaining to Jaya Publications including the\naccounts books, registers etc., were seized by the D.V. &\nA.C. and hence they were handicapped in putting forward\ntheir defence. But DW.88 had the temerity to depose on\noath, contrary to the stand of the accused, that during the\nspecial audit he personally produced the books of accounts.\nHe is the star witness of the accused, but has turned out\ntobe an utter lier and false witness who has no regard for\ntruth. He has changed his version at every stage of the\nproceedings. Even otherwise, the circumstances brought\nout in the evidence undoubtedly point out that he is\npropped up only to create a false defence for the accused.\n50.18) In this context, it may be relevant to note\nthat, during the pendency of the proceedings before this\nCourt, A-2 filed an application u/Sec. 207 and 243(2)\n\nCr.P.C\n. R/w. Rule 2 Chapter XIV of Karnataka Criminal\nRules of Practice seeking certified copies of the documents\nviz., the Day Book, Attendance Register, Journal Register,\nDaily Collections, Advertisement Registers, In and Out\nRegister, Postal Fee Paid and Statement of accounts file\nrelating to account of Namadhu MGR which were stated to\nhave been seized and also the Bank documents which were\nstated to have been seized under search list No.129126 to\n425868, knowing fully well that those documents were not\nin existence at all. In the said petition, it is unequivocally\nstated that the documents seized during the course of\ninvestigation have not been marked by the prosecution,\napparently as they would not support the case of the\naccused. Similarly, A-1 had also filed I.A.No.722 u/Sec.\n207 of\nCr.P.C\n. seeking leave to peruse the records\nforwarded by the prosecution which were unmarked during\nthe course of leading evidence by theprosecution. In the\nsaid application, it is specifically stated that the documents\nlying in the Court were forwarded u/Sec. 173(5) of the\nCode and the A-1 is entitled to perusal of those documents.\n\n50.19) On hearing the parties, the above applications\nwere dismissed by my Predecessor. The accused carried\nthe matter before the Hon'ble High Court in Crl. Petition\nNo.1840/2012 and the Hon'ble High Court also having\ndismissed the said petition, the accused approached\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Crl. Appeal No. 1497 and\n1498 of 2012 and by order dt. 28.09.2012, permitted the\ninspection of the documents by the accused. These facts\nclearly establish that the documents relating to Namadhu\nMGR were seized during the investigation and were\nproduced before the Court. But, DW.88 has gone to the\nextent of stating on oath that, he personally produced all\nthe above documents and the account books before the\nSpecial Auditor.\n\n50.20) When the witness was confronted with the\nobservation made in Ex.D.217 that there is no mention\ntherein about the production of the accounts before the\nSpecial Auditor DW.88 answered that, \"On account\nofseizure of the documents of M/s. Jaya Publication by\nD.V. & A.C., those documents could not be made available\nbefore the Special Auditors.\" This evidenceclinchingly\nestablishes that, when the Special Auditorswere appointed,\nthe accused did not produce any documents relating to the\nfinancial affairs of M/s. Jaya Publications. I have already\nreproduced the relevant portion of Ex.P.231, wherein the\nCommissioner has also reiterated the fact that the\nAssessing Officer called upon the assessee to produce the\nprimary documents such as the application forms of the\nmembers, counter foils of the deposit receipt and the\ncollection of register and cash book. But the assessee\nfailed to furnish any evidence to substantiate the claim. All\nthese circumstances go to show that, neither before the\nSpecial Auditors nor before the Assessing Officer the\nprimary documents were produced by the assessee. But\nsurprisingly, the accused have got summoned nine\nvolumes of original applications from the Income Tax\nDepartment without explaining as to how these original\napplications came to be produced before the Income Tax\nDepartment.\n\n50.21) Though the learned Counsel for the accused\nhas strenuously presented an argument based on the\nabove applications - Ex.D.230 series and the oral\ntestimony of 31 witnesses, the very fact that the original\napplications came to be produced before the Court under\nmysterious circumstances, the testimony of the witnesses\nbased on these applications is susceptible to doubt. Even\notherwise, a bare perusal of these applications indicate\nthat, these applications have been created just before the\nexamination of the witnesses somewhere in 2012 and\nmaneuvered to be produced before the Court. Even the\nnaked eye of a common ordinary man could find out that\nthe entire bulk of applications produced before this Court\nare nothing but sheets of paper kept in sunlight or\nexposed to smoke so as to give them an appearance of old\nused papers, but the ink used on the said sheets for\nwriting the names and other details appears to be so fresh\nand recent belying the very claim of the accused that the\nsaid applications were obtained during the check period.\nFor ex. at page No. 15482 and 15484 of the records, the\npapers are not evenly turned brown and in one of the\nsheets, the ink is smudged on the rear side of the paper\nmaking it evident that, the writing therein is made recently\nafter using the above trick. Likewise, at page 15312 and\n15314 the portion of the signature extending on the white\npatches of the paper looks fresh and recent, whereas the\nwriting on the other portions thereof looks different. As\nalready brought out from the mouth of the witnesses, the\nreceipt numbers are not mentioned in any of these\napplication forms, nor have the accused produced the\ncounter-foils of the receipts to corroborate the testimony\nof the above witnesses that on submission of the said\napplications, they were enrolled as the subscribers of the\nnewsletter. The application forms also do not contain any\nterm to the effect that the subscribers would be supplied\nwith particular number of copies of Namadhu MGR. Except\nthe interestedtestimony of the witness, nothing is\nproduced before the Court to show that the firm had\nagreed for supply free copy of newspaper for multiples of\nRs.3,000/- as sought to be contended. All these\ncircumstances therefore create suspicion about the\ngenuineness of the claim put forth by the accused.\n\n50.22) It is also pertinent to note, that if original\napplications were available with the firm from the\ncommencement of the scheme, there is no reason for the\nauditor to offer an explanation that the originals were lost.\nGoing by the statement made by the witnesses, that in\nterms of the aforesaid scheme, they were entitled to the\nfree supply of Namadhu MGR, the firm ought to have\nmaintained Register of the subscribers and also the\nrecords for having dispatched the copies to the subscribers\neither by post or through some other mode and all these\ndocuments could have been produced before the Income\nTax Authorities at the earliest point of time. Unfortunately,\ntill date, neither the Register of subscribers nor any other\nmaterial in proof of the supply of the copies to the\nsubscribers is produced before this Court. The evidence of\nthe witnesses that they have been receiving 5 to 6 copies\nof the newsletter appears to be incredulous. It is not\nknown why a reader requires 5 or 6 copies of the same\nnewsletter. It also does not stand to reason as to why a\nperson would deposit Rs.12,000/- to Rs.18,000/- inrespect\nof a newsletter the cost of which was only Re.1/-when the\ndeposit alleged to have been made by them would have\nfetched three times of the cost of the said news letter.\n\n50.23) Finally, in appreciating the evidence of the\nabove witnesses, it should also be noted that the entire\nbunch of witnesses examined by the accused in support of\nthe alleged claim are the ardent party workers, easily\nprocurable witnesses who are vitally interested in the\noutcome of the trial and therefore, their evidence is bound\nto be interested and partisan. Even otherwise, the\ncircumstances discussed above give a clear indication that\nthese witnesses are tutored and interested witnesses.\nThere is absolutely no corroboration to the oral testimony\nof these witnesses. Therefore, on over all consideration of\nall the above facts and circumstances and in view of my\ndefinite finding that the application forms relied on by the\naccused at Ex.D.230 series are got up and fabricated to\nbolster up the false claim laid by the accused, I am not\ninclined to accept the claim set up by the accused in this\nregard.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 51 of the\njudgment has dealt with the Agricultural Income of Jaya\nPublications. It was claimed that A-1 and A-2 as Partners\nof Jaya Publications derived agricultural income totaling to\nRs.60,45,665/- as per the break up figure given in the\nchart and therefore, the said amount is required to be\ntaken into account while computing the resources available\nwith A-1 for acquisition of properties and the pecuniary\nresources.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 51.3 of the\njudgment has observed that the Commissioner of Income\nTax has held in the above order that the appellant viz.,\nM/s. Jaya Publications is treated as having received\nagricultural income of Rs.8,01,961/- for the assessment\nyear 1991-92, Rs.9,31,000/- for the assessment year\n1992-93, Rs.7,43,500/- for the assessment year 1993-94.\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed that it needs to\nbe noted that, Exs.D.218, 219, 220 were filed on\n06.11.1998 and Exs.D.221 and D.222 were filed on\n17.03.1998. In the above acknowledgments, the net\nagricultural income for the assessment year 1991-92 to\n1994-95 is shown as Rs.4,54,500/-, Rs.9,31,000/-,\nRs.7,43,500/- and Rs.21,68,500/-respectively and for\nassessment year 1995-96, the agricultural income is\nshown as NIL.\n\n51.6) In proof of the alleged lease of the land, the\naccused have relied on the certificate issued by the Dy.\nInspector General of Registration, confirming the sale of\nstamp paper in favour of Vasudevan. Though the said\ncertificate is marked as Ex.D.235, the said certificate does\nnot establish either the grant of lease, terms and conditions\nthereof, the period for which the lease has been taken by\nthe accused. In the absence of any documents to show that\nT.S.R. Vasudevan is the owner of agricultural land\nmeasuring 65.57 acres of land, solely on the basis of\ncertificate of Inspector General of Registration, it cannot be\nconcluded that he had leased out the lands to M/s. Jaya\nPublications. No independent witness is examined to prove\nthe factum of cultivation and the nature of crops grown in\nthe land and yield fetched therefrom. When the accused\nhave not produced any acceptable evidence to show that\nM/s.Jaya Publication had taken the agricultural land on\nlease and have been carrying on agricultural operations,\nmerely on the basis of the Income Tax Returns brought\nabout after filing of the Charge Sheet, the claim cannot be\naccepted.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 52 of the\njudgment has dealt with Sales Job Work carried out by Jaya\nPublications during the check period. A-1 and A-2 claimed\nthat a total sum of Rs.4,19,96,605.60 was collected\ntowards the sales job work and produced the profit and loss\naccount statement marked as Exs.D.224, D.225 and D.226.\nExs.D.224, D.225 and D.226 do not bear the signature of\neither A-1 or A-2 and also the date. The Xerox copies\nproduced bear the imprint of the signature of G.Natarajan,\nthe Chartered Accountant who is not examined before the\nCourt. Therefore, no reliance could be placed on the Profit\nand Loss Account statement.\n\nThe trial Court at paragraph 53 of the judgment has\ndiscussed about the rental income of the accused. The\nlearned trial Judge has rejected the claim of A-1 and A-2 at\nRs.45,30,642/- from rental income from the properties and\naccepted the rental income calculated by the prosecuting\nagency. Besides, the claim of accused in a sum of Rs.6\nlakhs towards rental income from the hire of machinery\nwas also negatived as the statement of Profit and Loss\nAccount for the year ended 31.03.1995 and 1996 marked\nat Exs.D.226 and D.225 was proved to be got up and\nfabricated document.\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 55 deals\nwith Sasi Enterprises.\nIt is not in dispute that A-1 and A-2 are the partners\nof Sasi Enterprises, a Partnership Firm which owns (i)\nShop No.14, Ground Floor at No.602, Anna Salai, Chennai,\n(ii) Door No.14, Khadar Nawaz Khan Road,\nNungambukkam, (item Nos.8, 9 of Annexure-I), (iii)\nVacant site at Blake H.D.Road, Tanjaore, (iv) Vacant site\nin Ward No.6 in Mahar Nombu, Chavadi in (item No.13 and\n14 at Annexure-I), (v) Dry land measuring 3.23 acres at\nS.No.402-2 of Sundarakottai Village, Mannargudi Taluk,\nTanjore district (item No.16 of Annexure-I). According to\nthe accused, during thecheck period, M/s. Sasi Enterprises\nearned a total income of Rs.95,92,776/-.\n\n55.1) It is the submission of the learned Counsel\nthat, by way of rental income, the firm Sasi Enterprises\nhas received an aggregate of Rs.12,60,800/-, but the D.V.\n& A.C. has taken into account only Rs.6,15,900/- vide\nitem Nos.59, 61 and 62 of Annexure-III and hence, a\ndifference of Rs.6,64,900/- is to be included under this\nhead.\nThe trial Court relied on\nSection 269(SS)\nof Income\nTax Act since the loan amount or deposits are not paid by\nway of Bank Drafts or account-payee cheques doubting\nthe genuineness of the statement of profit and loss\naccounts presented to the Income Tax Authorities.\nBeneficiary of the loan was not examined. Absence of\nregistration of Deed of Lease and not believing the\nstatement made by the Tahsildar, even the author of\nHousing and Real Estate Development Private Limited was\nnot examined. Consequently, there is no worthwhile\nevidence before the Court to show that Sasi Enterprises\nhas derived income of Rs.90,92,766/- during check period.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph-60 has\nobserved that A-2 sought to include business income from\nMetal King and Vinod Video Vision amounting to\nRs.38,76,286/- and Rs.94,36,682/-respectively. But A-2\nhas not produced any proof of the said income either by\nexamining any independent witness or by producing any\nbook of account or stock register maintained by the\nconcern in the regular course of business. It is also an\nadmitted fact that, no returns have been filed by A-2\ndeclaring any income from this business. As a result, this\nclaim also cannot be considered.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph-61 has\nobserved that \"once aplea is taken that a person has\nadvanced any amount; it is to be seen whether that\nperson has the capacity to do so. Mere statement in that\nregard is not acceptable.\" Undoubtedly, in a case of this\nnature, the onus rests on the accused to show that either\nMeadow Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd., or Riverway Agro Products\nPvt. Ltd. had ample source to advance loans to the\naccused because, as held in the above case, accused have\nspecial knowledge about how a particular asset was\nacquired or income therein was earned. In the instant\ncase, the resources available with the above companies\nand their capacity to advance loans will be discussed later.\nFor the present, suffice it to note that the accused have\nnot produced any acceptable evidence in proof of the\navailment of the loan from the above Companies. As a\nresult, this claim is also liable to be rejected.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 62 of the\njudgment has dealt with Super Duper TV and income of\nA3.\nThe Investigating Agency has omitted to include\nincome earned by A-3 to the tune of Rs.1.10 crore,\ninitially, carried on as Proprietor of Super Duper TV and\nlater incorporated as Super Duper TV Private Limited. The\nCompany had introduced a deposit scheme, wherein cable\noperators deposited Rs.5,000/- or multiples and in this\nprocess, the Company received scheme deposit money of\nRs.1,06,10,000/-. The receipts were disclosed to the\nIncome Tax Authorities and the Commissioner of Appeals\nhas accepted the same as valid and proper. The Company\nhas also received periodical lease rent of Rs.1,500/- per\nmonth for other equipments which were given on hire from\ntime to time. Thus, an amount of Rs.11,18,500/- was\ncollected during the check period which was also disclosed\nto the Income Tax Authorities and accepted by them after\nscrutiny. It is the further submission of A-3 that the\nCompany Super Duper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., has deposited a sum\nof Rs.15,75,800/- with SIDCO for allotment of a shed,\nhowever no shed or plot was allotted by SIDCO.\n\nDW.85 identified the lease agreements executed by\nthe subscribers in favour of the Company which came to\nbe marked as Ex.D.75, D.78, D.82, D.84, D.89, D.96,\nD.100, D.113 and D.121 and further deposed that, there\nwere more than 2300 subscribers who had paid Rs.5,000/-\nas non-refundable entrance fee and had executed separate\nagreements in favour of M/s. Super Duper T.V. Pvt. Ltd.,\nagreeing to pay the hire charges at the rate of Rs.1,500/-\nper month. DW.85 also identified 22 receipt books marked\nas Ex.P.2341 series and stated that the said entrance fee\nwas non-refundable.\n\n62.9) Recitals in Ex.D.182, the assessment order\nrelating to the A/Y. 1995-96 reveals that neither Super\nDuper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., nor A-2 or A-3 filed any returns in\nrespect of the income derived by them from this business\nuntil filing of the Charge Sheet. Nonetheless, the\nassessment orders passed by the Income Tax Authorities\nat Ex.D.182 and Ex.D.184 indicate that, belated returns\nwere filed. Though it is stated in the assessment order dt.\n30.03.2000 (Ex.D.182) that afterissuance of the notice\nu/Sec. 142(1), the assessee viz., M/s. Super Duper T.V.\nPvt. Ltd., filed a return admitting a loss of Rs.1,99,210/- it\nis recited in the said order that, during the assessment\nyear 1996-97, the assessee was in receipt of a sum of\nRs.47.80 lakhs under the cable scheme from 956 persons\nat the rate of Rs.5,000/- per each cable operator and out\nof this, a sum of Rs.11.4 lakhs seem to have been\nreceived by cheque / D.D. from 228 persons and the\nbalance of Rs.36.40 lakhs has been credited in the\nassessee's bank account as receipt from 728 persons.\nThough these assessment orders have come into existence\nsubsequent to the initiation of the criminal proceedings\nagainst the accused, yet, in view of the other documentary\nevidence brought on record by the accused, there is\nsufficient material to hold that, during the year 1995-96,\nthe A-2 and A-3 had received Rs.47.80 lakhs under the\ncable scheme. Likewise, in the assessment order\nEx.D.183, it is stated that, during the previous year i.e.,\n1994-95,the assessee admitted the cable scheme receipts\nto the tune of Rs.62,15,100/- but during the enquiry,\nsummons were not served to 38 subscribers and 13\npersons who were summoned by the assessing officer\nhaving denied the payment of the amounts to the\nCompany, it is observed that a sum of Rs.3,85,000/-was\ntreated as unexplained cash credits. Thus, from the\nmaterial produced before the Court, A-3 has shown that\nfrom 1994-96, from the business of Super Duper T.V., A-\n.3 had collected Rs.47,80,000 + Rs.62,15,100 =\nRs.1,09,95,100 - Rs.3,87,000= Rs.1,06,10,100.00.\n\n62.11) There is nothing on record to show that A-3\nhad any other income other than the scheme deposits\namounting to Rs.1,06,10,100.00. And the hire charges\nwhich are declared by him before the Income Tax\nAuthorities amounting to Rs.11,18,500/-. Though the\nreturns are filed by A-3 much after the initiation of the\ncriminal proceedings, yet, as already noted above, DW.85\nin the cross-examination has unequivocally stated that\nSuper Duper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., carried on the cable TV\nbusiness only for six months and thereafter the said\nbusiness was stopped. Even otherwise,\nSec.3\nof the Cable\nTelevision Networks (Regulation Act 1995) provides that\nno person shall operate a cable television network unless\nhe is registered as a cable operator under this Act. The\nsaid Act came into force on 25.03.1995 and much before\nthe promulgation of the said Act, Cable Television Network\nRules 1994 had come into force w.e.f. 29.09.1994 which\nrequired to collect only refundable security deposits. Under\nthesaid circumstance, even though A-3 has produced the\nreceipt books and the counterfoils of the pay-in-slips to\nshow that, the amount of Rs.5,000/- collected from large\nnumber of subscribers were credited to A/c. No.1152 and\nwere available with A-3, yet, there is nothing on record to\nshow as to how the investment was made by A-3 for the\npurchase of the equipments supplied by him to the various\nsubscribers as agreed as per Ex.D.156(1) series. Certainly,\nthe cost of these equipments would be much more than\nthe deposit of Rs.5,000/- collected by him from the\nsubscribers. If the value of the equipments and\naccessories were less than Rs.5,000/- no prudent\nbusinessman would subscribe to such a scheme. That itself\nindicates that, A-3 had made huge investments for\npurchase of the equipments supplied to the subscribers\nand therefore, it cannot be said that the entire amount of\nRs.1,06,10,100.00 collected by him from the subscribers\nwas available with him for purchase of immovable\nproperties. Even otherwise, A-3 himself has admitted in his\nreturns referred above that the business income for the\nassessment year 1996-97 was NIL. Under the said\ncircumstance, the contention of A-3 that, the funds\namounting to Rs.1,06,10,100.00 was available with him\ncannot be accepted.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 63 of the\njudgment has dealt with M/s.Anjaneya Printers Pvt. Ltd.\n\n63.8) Though the appeal preferred by M/s Anjineya\nPrinters Pvt., Ltd., before the Income Tax Appellate\nTribunal, Chennai against the above Order, Ex. D-278\ncame to be allowed by a cryptic Order, dt. 27.12.2004,\neven before this court, the accused have not produced\neither the account books maintained in the regular course\nof business or any other reliable material to show that\nthere was genuine purchasetransactions between M/s.\nAnjaneya Printers Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Jaya Publications to\nthe tune of Rs.35 lakh as contended by A-3. Except the so\ncalled confirmation letter, accused have not been able to\nshow from the books of the firm that M/s.Jaya Publications\nhad shown in its returns the advance of Rs.35 lakhs to M/s\nAnjaneya Printers Pvt., Ltd., on different dates. There is\nnot even a scrap of paper to prove either the borrowal of\nthe funds or the income earned from the business by the\nfirm as contended by A-3. The transaction put forward by\nA-3 is opposed to\nSec.269 (SS)\nof I.T. Act. There is also\nno evidence to show that the firm had turned out printing\nworks during the relevant year. There is no proof\nregarding the initial capital invested by the partners.\nExcept the computerized statement of accounts, there is\nnothing on record to show that orders were received and\nprinting work was turned out by the firm as contended.\nThe computerized statement of account is neither\nadmissible in law nor does it prove the alleged income of\nthe firm. As a result, even the claim set up by the accused\nin this regard is also liable to be dismissed.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge from paragraph 65 to\nparagraphs 72 of the judgment deals with expenditure\nincurred during the check period.\n\n72.47) Now coming to the expenses incurred by A-1\nfor the marriage arrangement is concerned, it is pertinent\nto note that, DW.1 has asserted that he spent Rs. 97 lakhs\nfor the marriage expenses. Before the Income Tax\nAuthorities, at one point of time, it was decided that A-1\nhad incurred the expenses to the tune of Rs. 94 lakhs. The\nparty workers of AIADMK have come before the Court to\nsay that they spent Rs. 60lakhs for the façade and lakhs of\nrupees for the decoration and lorry loads of rice was\nprocured to serve lunch for more than 30,000 party\nworkers. The prosecution has come up with the case that,\na sum of Rs.6,45,04,222/- was spent for the marriage, out\nof which, Rs.5,21,23,532/- were spent for putting up\nPandals. Though the said amount looks exorbitant, but\nhaving regard to the accommodation provided to more\nthan 40,000 to 50,000 people at two places and special\narrangements made for the stage and decoration, the said\namount does not appear to be unreasonable. If the claim\nof the party workers that they spent rupees sixty lakhs\nonly for the façade is believed, then, having regard to the\nmagnitude of the event, at least three times of the said\namount could be estimated for putting up the Pandals.\nFurther, a minimum of Rs.40 lakhs to Rs. 50 lakhs might\nhave been spent on food on the date of marriage as well\nas for the reception and for breakfast. It has come in\nevidence that numbers of cooks were employed and were\npaid wages, elaborate sitting arrangements were made at\nthe venue, posh accommodation was arranged for the\nVIPs, elephants were procured from Kerala, crackers were\nburst and the entire venue was illuminated with lights,\nwhich would certainly entail huge expenses. That apart, it\nis established in evidence that, huge amount was spent\ntowards the printing of invitation, publication of thanks in\nthe dailies, tamboolam and valuable presents given tothe\nguests, all of which would certainly entail expenses of\nmore than 3 crores of rupees even by modest and\nconservative estimation. Therefore, taking into\nconsideration all the above facts and circumstances, a sum\nof Rs.3 crores is taken as the expenses incurred by A-1\ntowards the arrangement for the marriage of A-3.\n\n72.48) Thus, in the light of the above discussion, my\nfinding on the total expenditure incurred by the accused\nduring the check period is as under:\nExpenditure as per\nAnnexure-IV - Rs.11,56,56,833.41\n\nLess:\n\nItem No.148 - Rs. 7,50,000.00\nItem No.226 - Rs.3,45,04,222.00\n------------------------\nTotal - Rs.8,49,06,833.00\n==============\n\n73. RE: ASSETS:\n\nThe nature and extent of the assets and pecuniary\nresources found in possession of the accused during the\ncheck period are detailed in Annexure-II. It is marked as\nEx.P.2338.

OBJECTIONS OF THE ACCUSED:\n\nIn her written statement filed under\nSec. 313\n\nCr.P.C., A-1 has taken up a definite stand in para 10 of the\nwritten statement, which reads as under;\n\"When I was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\nbetween1991 and 1996, I acquired only one\nimmovable property, a vacant site bearing\nDoor No. 31-A Poes Garden, Chennai. I\nrenovated my old house at Door No. 36, Poes\nGarden, Chennai, made a new construction at\n31-A, Poes Garden, Chennai and also a Farm\nhouse in Hyderabad. The expenditures have\nbeen duly accounted for, disclosed to the\nIncome-tax Department and accepted by them\nafter in-depth scrutiny and verification of\nfacts.\"\n\ni) The other accused have taken up a plea that\nthey were having independent source of income and assets.\nThey were individually assessed under the\nIncome-tax Act\n,\nand the various properties standing in their names were\nacquired out of their earnings or the business income of the\nfirms floated by them and therefore, the prosecution is not\njustified in clubbing their assets with the properties of A-1.\n\nii) In para 20 of the written statement submitted\nby A-2 under\nSec. 243 (1)\nCr.P.C., she has stated as\nunder;\n\n\"At all times, I had independent income and\nSelvi Jayalalitha had her own independent\nincome and assets in her name. All the four of\nus were having independent source of income\nand assets and were individually assessed\nunder the\nIncome Tax Act\n. Hence, clubbing the\nassets of myself with A- 1 is unjustified and\nillegal both in law and in fact.\"\n\niii) A-2 has taken up a further plea that she is a\npartner in Jaya Publications. From 1990 onwards, thefirm\nhad floated a scheme whereunder, any person could invest\nby making deposit of Rs.12,000/- to Rs.18,000/- with Jaya\nPublications. The depositors were entitled to get a\nparticular number of copies of the daily news paper\n\"Namadhu MGR\" free of cost. The said news paper carried\nthe news items and the messages of the General Secretary\nof AIADMK party. A-1 was and is the General Secretary of\nthe party. She has specifically stated in the written\nstatement that during the check period, an amount of Rs.\n14,30,35,000/- was collected and the said scheme was\ndisclosed to the Income Tax Department and has been\nduly accepted by the Income-Tax Authorities up to the\nlevel of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.\n\niv) Regarding the various items of immovable\nproperties listed by the prosecution in various Annexures,\nA-2 has contended that she is not related to the\nimmovable properties at Sl. Nos. 18 to 306 viz., 18, 24, 27\nto 31, 49, 50, 56 to 67, 75 to 79, 86 to 90, 94, 103, 105\nto 109, 111 to 121, 124 to 154, 160 to 165, 167 to 169,\n173, 174, 176, 177, 179 to 182, 186, 192 to 194, 196 to\n200, 206 to 208, 210, 211, 216, 225 to 228, 230 to 233,\n235, 237, 240, 242, 248, 249, 251, 252, 258, 262 to 284,\n286, 288 to 292, 295, 296, 298, 302, 303, 305 and 306 of\nAnnexure II.\nv) Regarding the other properties, she has\nnarrated in detail the mode of payment made to the\nrespective vendors for purchase of these properties and has\nmentioned the source from which these items of immovable\nproperties were purchased and has contended that all the\nexpenses incurred for the purchase of the above properties\nhave been declared by her and other accused individually\nand the Income-tax authorities have accepted the returns\nfiled by them after thorough scrutiny and therefore, the\nallegations made against them are liable to be rejected.\n\nvi) A-3 has also taken up a similar defence\ncontending that during the check period, he was carrying\non a business under the name and style \"Super Duper TV\"\ninvolved in production, coverage of programmes including\nentertainment programmes, software equipment hire and\nerection of dish antenna and cable TV net work. He was\nalso carrying on the business in consultation, investment,\nprogramming, trading and vehicle hiring and was also\nselling mushrooms purchased from M/s Fresh Mushrooms\nand had earned Rs.56 lakh from the coverage of film\nclippings, which were telecasted in DD and other TV\nchannels during the World Tamil Conference.\n\nvii) A-3 has taken up a further defence that he\nalong with A-2 became a share holder of the company i.e.,\nAnjeneya Printers and this Anjeneya Printers acquired the\nfollowing properties viz: -\n\n1. Padmanabha Street Rs. 15,96,150.00\n2. Habibullah Road Rs. 1,03,52,488.00\n\n3. Luz Avenue 1/6th share Rs. 10,87,196.00\n\nAccording to A-3, the premises where the machinery\nwas found, was not exclusively in the occupation of M/s\nAnjeneya Printers Pvt., Ltd., but it was also in the\noccupation of M/s Jaya Publications. Regarding the\nvaluation of machinery, A-3, in his written statement, has\nput forth a plea that large items of machinery were\npurchased from Mr. Shroff, which were under his use. The\nsaid machinery was valued at Rs. 20,16,000/-. Besides the\nabove, certain other machinery were taken from M/s Jaya\nPublications on lease. The expenditure incurred by M/s\nAnjeneya Printers Pvt. Ltd., were submitted to the Income-\ntax department and were accepted by them. The total cost\nof machinery, which was shown in the books of M/s\nAnjeneya Printers Pvt., Ltd., at Rs. 74,14,935/- has been\naccepted by the Income-tax department after scrutiny.\nThe total cost of machinery which is inventoried under Ex.\nP-664 would be Rs.94,30,935/-including the cost of\nmachinery purchased from Mr. Shroff amounting to Rs.\n20,16,000/-. Therefore, Rs.1,22,11,065/- is liable to be\nexcluded from item No. 194 of the Annexure-II.\n\nviii) A.3 has further contended that an amount of\nRs. 50.98 lakhs shown towards the conveyance charges is\ntotally unjustified and opposed to law. With regard to the\ncost of construction at Ekkatu Thangal, A-3 has contended\nthat the entire cost of construction shown by the\nprosecution at Rs.2,13, 63,450/- is liable to be excluded\nfor the reason that the site on which the building is situate\nbelongs to a different company by name Shastry Nuts and\nBolts. It is specifically stated in para 20 of the written\nstatement that Anjeneya Printers Pvt., Ltd., is a tenant of\nthe building and has been paying rent to M/s Shastry Nuts\nand Bolts. Therefore, the above said amount of\nRs.2,13,63,450/- is liable to be excluded totally.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge at sub-paragraph of\n76.6 has narrated the evidence of PW.17-Tmt.Sundari.\nPW.17 Tmt. Sundari Shankar, the owner of theaforesaid\nproperty deposed on oath that, she was the owner of plot\nat C-62, Thiruvenkata Nagar, Ambaltur, Chennai\nmeasuring 4830 Sq. Ft. She had constructed a house\nmeasuring 600 Sq. Ft. therein. She wanted to sell that\nland. Her neighbour one Ramesh wanted to buy it. She\nentered into an agreement to sell the said property for\nRs.5 lakhs and received Rs.1.75 lakh as advance. But the\nsaid Ramesh could not purchase the property and PW.17\nwas not in a position to refund the advance money. After\ntwo or three months, the said Ramesh told PW.17 that, a\nperson close to Selvi J. Jayalalitha has come forward to\nbuy the property and she was taken to registration office\nand executed thesale deed. PW.16 specifically deposed in\nher chief-examination that the sale amount was Rs.5\nlakhs. Out of that amount, a D.D. for Rs.1,90,000/- was\ngiven to her and out of the remaining amount, Ramesh\ntook Rs.1,75,000/- due to him and gave her the rest of the\namount in cash. Her daughter Bama Chandran and\nRamesh have signed the sale deed as witnesses. She\nfurther deposed that the amount given as cash is not\nshown in the sale deed. In the cross-examination she\ndenied the suggestion that she had entered into an\nagreement with Ramesh for Rs.1,90,000/-. She asserted in\nthe cross-examination that the said agreement was for\nRs.5 lakhs. She also denied the suggestion that at the\ninstance of the police she has falsely stated that she had\ntaken Rs. 5 lakhs in connection with the said dealing.\n\n76.7) It is the submission of the learned Counsel for\nA-2 that the so called agreement entered into with\nRamesh is not produced in evidence and more over her\ntestimony being contrary to\nSec.92\nof the Evidence Act, no\nreliance can be placed on her testimony. The learned\nCounsel also pointed out that, Ramesh, the attester to\nEx.P.46 is examined as PW.161 but in his evidence he has\nnot spoken anything about the execution of the agreement\nfor Rs.5 lakhs with PW.17. Therefore, the claim made by\nthe prosecution in this regard is not supported by oral or\ndocumentary evidence.\n\n76.8) I have gone through the evidence of PW.161\nSri. R.Ramesh, the Asst. Manager at Indian Bank,\nAbirampuram Branch. The relevant portion of his chief-\nexamination reads as under;\n\"During December 1992, to purchase a\nhouseand a vacant site in Thiruvenkata Nagar,\nAmbaltur, Chennai from Mrs. Sundari Shankar\nin the name of myself and my wife, we\nexecuted a sale agreement for that I gave\nRs.1,75,000/- to Sundari Shankar as advance.\nTo purchase the above mentioned property, I\nwanted to avail loan from our bank. But they\ntold that the loan will not given for old house. I\ninformed Sundari Shankar about this and\nasked her to return the advance she had\ntaken. But she told me that as she had\ninvested the advance money in a property in\nPorur, she could not return the advance. She\ntold me to sell that property to another person\nand take my advance. So requested out\nManager Mrs. Susarita Sunder Rajan, to make\narrangements for the above mentioned\nproperty to be sold to Mrs. Sasikala. She spoke\nto Tmt. Sasikala and finally agreed to purchase\nthat property for Rs. 5 lakhs. In September\n1994, I brought the above Sundari Shankar to\nDistrict Registration Office (North Chennai) and\narrayed for the registration. Then, Mr. Raja\nGopalan was the District Registrar. Mr. Raja\nGopalan gave the sale amount for the above\nmentioned property. Rs.1,90,000/- was given\nas a D.D. in the name of Mrs. Sundari Shankar.\nThe remaining Rs.3,10,000/- was given to me\nas cash from that amount. I took the advance\nof Rs.1,75,000/- which I had paid. I handed\nover the remaining amount and the demand\ndraft to Mrs. Sundari Shankar. In the sale deed\nI have signed as a witness. \"\n\nIn the cross-examination it is elicited that, PW.161\ndid not show the agreement copy to the police. However,\nhe has maintained in the cross-examination that his wife\nand he signed the agreement in which they fixed the price\nas Rs.5 lakhs as sale amount for that house. In the further\ncross-examination PW.161 has answered thus;\n\"My wife and I gave back the agreement\nwemade to them. We don't have the photo\ncopy for that. I don't have any documents\nregarding the agreement with Mrs. Sundari\nShankar. I don't have any documents\nregarding the loan availed in the bank\nregarding the agreement with Mrs. Sundari\nShankar, these is only the oral deposition. I\nhave given my wife and I gave Rs.1,75,000/-\nto Mrs. Sundari Shankar as cash.\"\n\n76.9) Thus, it could be seen that, PW.161 has\nsubstantially corroborated the testimony of PW.17 with\nregard to the prior agreement of sale entered into between\nPW.17 and PW.161. Both these witnesses have stated\nthat, at the time of execution of the sale deed,\nRs.1,75,000/- was paid as advance consideration and the\nsaid amount was refunded to PW.161 at the time of\nexecution of the sale deed Ex.P.46. It is borne on record\nthat the sale consideration in Ex.P.46 is shown as\nRs.1,90,000 and it is also not in dispute that the said\nconsideration of Rs.1,90,000/- was paid to PW.17 through\nD.D. Under the said circumstances, if in fact the said\nconsideration was the total considerationreceived by\nPW.17 in respect of sale transaction, naturally a question\nwould arise as to how PW.17 would have repaid the\nadvance received by her in respect of very same\ntransaction. It is not the case of either of the parties that\nPW.161 was repaid Rs.1,75,000/- after encashment of the\nD.D. In all probability, PW.161 would not have signed the\nsale deed as witnesses if the advance consideration paid\nby him was not refunded to him before the registration of\nsale deed. Therefore, the testimony of PW.161 appears to\nbe nearer to the truth. In this context, the answers elicited\nfrom the mouth of PW.161 in the course of the cross-\nexamination that the sale agreement was returned to the\nvendor appears to be probable and leads to the inference\nthat, on refund of Rs.1,75,000/- on the execution of the\nsale deed the agreement of sale was returned to the\nvendor. There is nothing unnatural in the conduct of\nPW.161 and probabilities also suggest that he would not\nhave allowed the sale to go through without getting the\nrefund of the money paid by him. Accused have not\nbrought on record any circumstance to show that, PW.161\nhas any reason to give false evidence against the accused\ntaking upon himself the contractual relationship with\nPW.17. Therefore, taking into consideration the above\nfacts and circumstances, I am not inclined to accept the\ncontention raised by the accused in this regard.\n\n77. Cash paid over and above Sale\nConsideration.Item No.24:\n\n24 Amount paid to TNHB towards\nRs.2,35,813.00 allotment of plot No.L-66,\n(Old No.524 N) Anna Nagar, Chennai-40,\nin favour of Tmt. J. Elavarasi\n\nPW.128 Balakrishnan, Asst. Secretary, TamilNadu\nHousing Board has deposed that, as per Ex.P.718, Plot\nNo.E-83, Besant Nagar was allotted to A-3. Ex.P.720 is the\norder of allotment. Ex.P.721 is the application submitted by\nA-3. Along with the application, address proof, income\ncertificate and declaration that applicant is the wife and\nchildren, do not own any house or plot at any other place\nwere required to be furnished and accordingly A-3\nsubmitted the declaration and age proof and income\ncertificate. In the income certificate Ex.P.732, the yearly\nincome of A-3 is shown as Rs.44,000/- and as per\nEx.P.724, the Tahsildar has certified that A-3 is residing at\nNo.18, Balamuttukrishnan Street, Chennai-17. An\nallotment order was passed determining the total value of\nthe plot at Rs.2,88,750/-. It was paid on 30.07.1992 as per\nEx.P.725. The registration fee also was paid. The ownership\nwas delivered. As per Ex.P.728, the Surveyor delivered the\npossession to A-3.\n\nThis witness further deposed that as per Ex.P.719\nHIG Plot No.10, Egmore-374, Alwar Pet, Chennai\nwasallotted to A-4 and again Plot No.524 was allotted\ninstead of the earlier allotment as per Ex.P.729. Ex.P.730\nis the application submitted by A-4. Along with the said\napplication she submitted the income certificate as per\nEx.P.732. Address proof as per Ex.P.733 and two\ncertificates issued by the Tahsildar. As per Ex.P.732 the\nyearly income of A-4 was Rs.48,000/-. The total value of\nthe plot is Rs.2,34,813/-The amount was paid as per\nEx.P.735. The possession was delivered on 23.10.1992 as\nper Ex.P.736. On 25.02.1993 no objection certificate was\ngranted to her to construct a residential house in the said\nplot.\n\nIn the cross-examination it is suggested to PW.128\nthat the site allotted to A-3 is still with the Housing Board\nand the money paid by A-3 should be returned. PW.128\ndenied the said suggestion. The allotment and the\npayment made by A-3 and A-4 in respect of the above\nallotment and the declarations given by them regarding\ntheir address and income status has not been disputed in\nthe cross-examination. Hence the accused are not entitled\nfor return of the amount.\n\nIt is the argument of the learned Counsel for A-2\nthat the evidence of PW.45 is hearsay evidence\nandtherefore no credence could be given to his evidence.\nTmt. Sucharita is not examined by the prosecution. No\ndocument is produced regarding the deposit of cash to the\nBank account of Nageswara Rao on that day as spoken by\nthe witnesses and therefore, the prosecution is not entitled\nto take into account any amount other than what is shown\nin the sale deed Ex.P.105 to P.110 and hence the entire\namount of Rs.76,00,000/-included in item No.159 is liable\nto be deducted.\n\nI have gone through Ex.P.111 to P.120. They are the\ncopies of the current account pay-in slips for cash\ndeposits. According to PW.44, he himself wrote these pay-\nin slips in his hands as instructed by Tmt. Sucharita. But,\non perusal of these documents, it is seen that, Ex.P.111\nand P.112 are dt. 1.2.95. Ex.P.113 to P.119 are dated\n28.2.95 and Ex.P.120 is dated 18.3.95. These pay-in slips\nstand for different amounts. Ex.P.111 dated 18.3.95\nstands for Rs.14,50,000/-. According to PW.43, the sale\ndeeds Ex.P.105 to P.110 were executed on 19.3.95 i.e., on\na Sunday. He has no where stated in his evidence that the\ncash consideration of Rs.58.73 lakhs was paid to him any\ntime earlier to the date of registration. That being the\ncase, there is no reason for the bank Manager to instruct\nPW.144 to write the anterior date in the pay-in slips. There\nis no explanation as to why the different amount is entered\nin the said pay-in-slips if the entire amount of\nRs.58.73lakhs was given to PW.43 on the date of the\nregistration. In this context, it is also pertinent to note\nthat, PW.43 was recalled at the instance of the accused\nand was subjected to further cross-examination on\n29.1.2003 and at that time, PW.43 has given a totally\ndifferent version about the credit of cash amount into his\nloan account stating that, by sale of the cameras, he\nraised Rs.75 lakhs and deposited the money into his\naccount to clear the loan. But even in this regard there is\nno clear evidence, nonetheless, solely on the basis of the\npay-in-slips produced by the prosecution at Ex.P.111 to\nP.121, it may not be safe to hold that huge sum of Rs.76\nlakhs was paid into the hands of PW.43 when he himself\nwas not the owner of the said properties. The owner of the\nproperty viz., his sister Ramayi Ammal is not examined\nbefore the Court, the Bank Manager is also not been\nexamined. The loan account of PW.43 is not produced\nbefore the Court to ascertain the correctness of the\nstatements made by the witnesses. Under the said\ncircumstances, merely on the basis of the fact that PW.43\nhad filled in the pay-in-slips as directed by the Bank\nManager Tmt. Sucharita, it cannot be concluded that a\nsum of Rs.76 lakhs was paid by the accused towards the\ncost of acquisition of Luz Avenue property. In this context,\nit is also relevant to note that the names of the purchaser\nwere not entered in Ex.P.105 to P.110 at the time of\nregistration of these documents. Though the entire\ntransactions appear tobe shoddy and suspicious and it is\nreally shocking to note as to how the Registrar could\nregister the document leaving the name of the purchaser\nblank. The endorsements made by the Registrar on this\ndocument indicate that the purchaser was not present at\nthe time of registration of the document. PW.43 has not\nstated as to who paid the sale consideration and the cash\namount of Rs.58.73 lakhs to him. He has merely stated\nthat, Ramayi Ammal signed the sale deed. Shankar and he\nput the witness signature. Six blank cheques worth Rs.44\nlakhs were given to the bank itself. One cheque for Rs.10\nlakhs was given to Ramayi Ammal and an amount of\nRs.58.73 lakhs cash was credited to his account. On the\nbasis of the vague and general statement made by PW.43,\nwithout there being any corroboration thereto, solely on\nthe basis of his oral testimony, the cost of Rs.76 lakhs\ncannot be mulct on the accused. Hence this amount shall\nbe deducted from the computation of the assets.\n\n78. III.NEW / ADDL. CONSTRUCTION\nOFBUILDINGS:\n\nIn Sl.

N. Sasikala (covered by\nDocument No.2256/90 dt. 3-5-90 of\nS.R.O.T. O.R.B., Trichy)\n\n78.33) In the instant case, there cannot be any\ndispute that, the Engineers examined by the prosecution\nare competent to estimate the valuation of the structures.\nThe accused themselves have relied on the valuation\nreport prepared by the P.W.D. Engineers, who were part\nof the team to controvert the reports prepared by the\nprosecution witnesses. It is not explained by the\nprosecution as to why the reports prepared by DW.78 and\nDW.83 are preferable to the reports prepared by the entire\nteam which are proved in a Court of law. Undisputedly,\nthe actual cost incurred for the constructions is within the\nknowledge of theaccused. It has come in evidence that,\ncontractors and architects were appointed in connection\nwith the construction. The learned Counsel for A-4 himself\nhas referred to the payment made to the architect, who is\nexamined by the accused as DW.88. Under the said\ncircumstance, instead of relying on the reports of DW.78\nand DW.83, the accused could have very well produced\nthe actual bills for having purchased the materials and\ncould have examined the contractors and the persons who\nsupplied the materials in proof of the actual cost incurred\nfor the constructions.\n\n78.34) It is pertinent to note that the accused do not\ndispute the measurement of the buildings and the nature\nof the constructions and the quality of the materials used\ntherein. The witnesses examined by the prosecution have\nspecifically deposed about the use of high quality marble\nand exquisite decorative articles and use of teakwood for\nthe doors and windows and for other purposes. No doubt it\nis true that the prosecution has not produced any direct\nevidence in proof of the cost of these special items and has\nsolely relied on the oral testimony of the above witnesses\nwho have merely stated that they ascertained the price of\nthe marbles and other special items from the market. But,\nit should not be forgotten that the special items having\nbeen procured by the accused from the concerns known to\nthem, the price paid thereto is specially within the\nknowledge of the accused. Having regard to the burden\ncast on the accused in view of the provisions of\nSec.\n13(1)(e)\nof the Act, which requires the accused to offer\nsatisfactory explanation when the existence of assets are\nproved by the prosecution, the accused were not prevented\nfrom adducing necessary evidence to show that the value\nof the special items quoted by the prosecution is more than\nthe price paid by them in respect of these special items.\n\n78.35) No doubt it is true that, an attempt is made\nby the accused to prove the cost of the marbles by\nexamining DW.96 and through him, the copies of invoices\nare marked as Ex.D.210 series. But, on going through his\nevidence, it is seen that the rates furnished by him relate\nto the year 1999, whereas, the buildings in question are\nproved to have been constructed between 1994 and 1996.\nTherefore, even the rates spoken to by DW.96 cannot be\naccepted. The invoices produced by this witness do not\ntally with the description of the marbles noted in the\nrespective valuation reports. Therefore, I do not find any\njustifiable reasons to accept the arguments of the learned\ncounsel for the accused regarding the valuation adopted by\nthe prosecution. However, as the prosecution has not\nproduced convincing evidence in support of the value fixed\nby the PWD Engineers in respect of the value of the special\nitems and there beingsome dispute regarding the\npayments of the architect's fees, in order to meet the ends\nof justice, it would be proper to reduce the overall cost of\nconstructions by 20% of the total estimation given by the\nprosecution witnesses. In this way, by reducing the total\ncost of constructions by 20%, the cost of the new and\nadditional constructions of the buildings effected by the\naccused during the check period is determined at\nRs.22,53,92,344.00.\n\nUnder the heading of 'Gold and Diamond Jewellery',\nthe learned Sessions Judge at paragraph 79.18 has\nobserved as under:\n\n79.18) Thus, what emerges from the above\nevidence is that, at the commencement of the check\nperiod, A-1 was in possession of only 7040 grams of gold\njewellery. As already noted above, A-1 herself has\nadmitted in the wealth returns that, increase in the value\nof jewellery is on account of the jewellery received as gift\nduring the year. This declaration presupposes that during\nthe year 1992, A-1 had received gold jewellery. Under the\nsaid circumstance, she is estopped from contending that\nall the jewellery seized by the prosecution was in her\npossession before commencement of the check period.\nThis conclusion gets fortified from the testimony of\nPW.155 who has categorically stated before the Court\nthat, he was called to prepare the valuation report only in\nNovember, 1992 and as required by A-1 and A-2, he\nprepared different valuation report for the relevant years\ncommencing from 1986-87, even though the bills for the\npurchase of the said jewellery were not produced before\nhim. From the evidence of this witness, it stands\nestablished that the valuation reports were prepared only\nfor the purpose of submitting the wealth tax returns in the\nyear 1992 by segregating the articles for the previous\nyears at the whims and fancy of A-1. Admittedly, A-1 was\nnot in possession of any bills for purchase of this gold\nanddiamond jewellery as on the date of filing the wealth\nreturns. There is also no explanation by the accused as to\nhow the gold was accumulated during the years. Under\nthe said circumstances, merely because the wealth tax\nreturns were filed by her before the initiation of the\ncriminal proceedings does not exonerate her of her liability\nto explain the source of the huge quantity of gold and\ndiamond articles. Even during the trial, A-1 has failed to\nfurnish any satisfactory explanation except stating that all\nthe jewellery were in her possession from the\ncommencement of the check period. But the evidence\ndiscussed above proves it otherwise.\n\n79.19) Another important aspect that emerges from\nthe evidence of PW.155 and PW.179 is that, Ex.P.1014 to\nEx.P.1016 valuation reports were prepared in the name of\nA-2 in order to facilitate her to file wealth returns in her\nname in respect of the gold ornaments described threin.\nThere is no evidence as to when and how A-2 acquired\nthese gold and diamond articles. It has come in evidence\nthat her husband was in Govt. service till 1991. If so, in all\nprobability, the source for acquisition of these assets would\nhave been available with A-2 and could have been\nproduced before the Court to explain her ownership over\nthese jewellery. The fact that in 1992 while preparing the\nvaluation reports in relation to the gold jewellery possessed\nby A-1, separate valuation reports were prepared in\nthename of A-2 leads to the inference that in order to\navoid the large scale disclosure of the gold and diamond\njewellery possessed by A-1, some of these items were\ndeclared in the name of A-2. This amounts to a serious\ninstance of abetment and conspiracy alleged against the\naccused. The very fact A-2 is unable to explain the source\nof acquisitions of these valuables, it could be presumed\nthat A-2 has aided and abetted A-1 in holding the said\nassets in her name.\n\n79.20) From the above evidence, the prosecution\nhas proved the seizure of gold and diamond jewellery of\nthe total weight of 27588 grams. But as it is proved in\nevidence that 7040 grams of gold and diamond jewellery\nwere in possession of A-1 prior to the check period, the\nsaid quantity is required to be left out from the total\ncomputation of the value of the gold and diamond\njewellery found in the possession of A-1. Thus, the total\nweight of the gold jewellery found in the possession of A-1\nas on 30.04.1996 comes to 20548 grams.\n\n79.21) Regarding the valuation of the gold as in\n1992, we have the reliable material in the assessment\norder Ex.P.2206, wherein, the assessing officer has\nadopted the rate of gold as on 1991-92 at Rs.4,334/-per\n10 grams. The learned counsel for A-1 has produced the\ncopy of Circular No.646 dt. 15.03.1993 issued under Rule\n19 of Sch.\nIII of Wealth Tax Act\n,wherein, the same rate is\npublished by the concerned authorities. Thus, the value of\n20548 grams of gold found in possession of A-1 during the\ncheck period is calculated as below:\n\n20548 x Rs.433/- = Rs.8,90,55,032/-\n\nIt has come in the evidence of PW.125 that, while\nvaluing the gold, he did not add the making charges and\nwastages and took into consideration only the value of the\ngold and to fix the value of the diamonds he took into\nconsideration the cutting, colour carat weight. He has\nfurther stated that, first he weighed the ornaments and\nthen deducted the approximate weight of the stones and\naccordingly determined the weight of the gold and its\nvalues. This witness has separately given the value of the\ndiamonds at Rs.2,43,92,790/-. Since the gross weight of\n7040 grams is deducted, the proportionate value of the\ndiamonds comes to Rs.1,62,61,820/-. Thus, adding this\nfigure to the value of the gold as above, the total value of\nthe gold and diamond jewellery found in the possession of\nA-1 during the check period comes to Rs.2,51,59,144/-.\nWith regard to Silver, the learned Sessions Judge at\nparagraph 80.9 has observed that, in the wealth tax\nreturns filed by her as per Ex.P.2179 she has categorically\nadmitted that silverwares were received as gifts during the\nyear. This declaration is consistent with the case of the\nprosecution that, the additional silverware amounting to\n416 kgs were acquired by her during the check period. A-1\nhas not produced any reliable evidence in proof of the\nsource for acquisition of the silverware. As a result, it could\nbe safely inferred that 416 kgs of silver is the illegal\nacquisition of A-1.\n80.10) PW.125 has valued the silver at the rate of\nRs.5,000/- per kg. whereas, in the Wealth Tax assessment\norder relied on by the accused, the silver is seen to have\nbeen valued at Rs.6,646/- per kg. Since the rate adopted\nby PW.125 is advantageous to the accused, adopting the\nsaid rate, the value of 416 kgs. of silver is assessed at\nRs.20,80,000/- which is added to the over all assets of A-1\nacquired during the check period.\n\nThe trial Court has computed the value of the fixed\ndeposits and shares amounting to Rs.3,42,62,728/-.\n\n258 Fixed Deposit in Canara Bank 16,03,545.00\nMylapore in the name of Selvi J.\nJayalalitha under Kamadenu Deposit.\n(KDR No.950485 dt 27.5.94)\n259 F.D. in Canara Bank Mylapore in the 1,49,544.00\nname of M/s.

The costliest vehicle amongst these is\nMercedes Benz (TN-09/P-6565) and cost of the same is\nRs.9.15 Lakh. Total value amounts to Rs.1,29,94,033.05.\nThis amount is accepted.\nPara-84 of the impugned judgment deals with IX)\nMachineries pertaining to Item Nos.293, 294. PW.115 -\nMariyappan, employee of P.W.D. at the relevant time has\nbeen examined in proof of the above items. According to\nhim, there were 55 machines in Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd.,\nand 19 machines in Metal King.\nDW.89 - T. Ananthakrishnan, Manager of\nM/s.Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd., has deposed that the\nCompany were carrying on business of printing\nGovernment school books, posters, brochures, AIADMK\nParty's posters, books etc., Out of 37 machines available\nin the said premises, 19 machineries were owned by M/s.\nAnjaneya Printers (P) Ltd., and 15 machines were taken\non hire from Shastri Nuts, Plates Manufacturers Pvt. Ltd.,\nand 3 machines were taken from Jaya Publications. This\nwitness has deposed regarding other machineries\npurchased by M/s. Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd., and through\nthis witness, the copies of the invoices dated 22.10.1993\ncame to be marked as Exs.D.236, D.237 and D.238.\n\nEx.D.236, D.237 and D.238 are dated 22.10.1993.\nThough these invoices are stated to have been issued by\nUni Off-set Printers, Amar Enterprises and Ideal\nPackaging, the signatures on the invoices appear to be\nsimilar in all the three invoices leading to doubt their\nauthenticity. In Ex.D.236, even though number of\nequipments are listed, a sum of Rs.6 lakh only is shown\nagainst the cost of the generators and the cost of the\nother machineries are not mentioned therein. There is\nabsolutely no material to show that items shown in these\ninvoices are delivered to M/s. Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd.,\nIn order to persuade the Court to believe that these\ninvoices are authentic and the purchases made thereunder\nare genuine, the learned Counsel for the accused has\nreferred to the bank statement relating to M/s. Anjaneya\nPrinters (P) Ltd., (A/c.No.2250) produced by the\nprosecution, marked as Ex.P.2088 and it is emphatically\nsubmitted that the amount shown in the said invoices are\nduly paid to the said concerns as per the above statement\nof accounts. But, the said Ex.P.2088 shows that the sum\nof Rs.6,72,000/-, Rs.8,96,000/- and Rs.4,48,000/- are\npaid to Uni Off-set Printers, Ideal Packaging, Amar\nEnterprises on 23.09.2009. It is not the case of the\naccused that, the payment for the machineries were made\nin advance and thereafter the invoices were obtained for\nthe purchase of machineries. This goes to show that an\nattempt is made to fabricate invoices corresponding to the\npayments made to the aforesaid concern appearing to be\nthe purchase transactions.\n\nNow coming to the payment of Rs.53 lakhs said to\nhave been made to Tamil Arasi Achagam as per the\ninvoice marked as Ex.D.276 (again a zerox copy), the\nlearned Counsel for the accused has relied on the\nEx.P.1226, wherein an entry dated 25.06.1994 reads that,\nRs.40,96,565/- is credited to the loan account of Tamil\nArasi by clearing the cheque bearing No.009. The said\ncheque is marked as Ex.P.1238 and is seen to have been\ndrawn towards the repayment of loan account of Tamil\nArasi and Ex.P.1239, another cheque dated 22.6.1994 is\nissued by M/s. Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd., in the name of\nIndian Bank A/c. Tamil Arasi. But as already stated, these\ncheques are dated 22.6.94, but the invoice Ex.D.276 is\ndated 28.05.1995 for Rs.53 lakhs. Though it is argued that\nthe amounts of the cheques Ex.P.1238 and P.1239 amount\nto Rs.53 lakhs, the invoice Ex.D.276 dated 28.5.1995\ncannot be co-related to the above cheque payments. This\ninvoice Ex.D.276 appears to have been got up later.\n\nWhile appreciating the contention urged by the\naccused, another important aspect to be taken note of is\nthat, the bank account of M/s. Anjaneya Printers(P) Ltd.,\nwas opened only on 23.01.1994 with a cash deposit of\nRs.501/-. The said C.A. No.1053 maintained by M/s.\nAnjaneya Printers (P) Ltd., with Indian Bank, Abirampuram\nBranch, contains the following credit entries.\n\nDate : 23-01.94 - By Cash - Rs.15 lakhs\nDate : 19.02.94 - Clearing - Rs. 34,000/-\nDate : 25.06.94 - By Transfer - Rs. 13 lakhs.\n- By Transfer - Rs. 4 lakhs.\n- By Transfer - Rs. 18 lakhs.\nDate : 01.07.94 - By Transfer - Rs. 13 lakhs.\nDate : 30.12.94 - By MTL Loan\nSanction - Rs. 50 lakhs.\nDate : 31.12.94 - By Transfer Rs. 20,75,000/-\n- By CA 1104\ntransfer - Rs. 25 lakhs.\n4.1.1995 - By Cash - Rs. 2,22,382/-\n10.1.1995 - By O.D. 81 Rs.31,95,998/-\n\nIn the light of the above evidence, the documents\nproduced by DW.89 are analyzed, it is seen that, Ex.D.235\nis the zerox copy of the certificate said to have been\nissued by N. Nallamuttu, Dy. Inspector General of\nregistration confirming that, stamp paper bearing Sl. Nos.\n4163 to 4166 and 4170 dated 5.7.98 were sold to Tr.\nVasudevan. The said document does not establish\nanything. Ex.D.236 to D.238 are the zerox copies of the\ninvoices dated 22.10.1993 issued by Uni Off-set Printers,\nAmar Enterprises and Ideal Packaging.These documents\nare not proved in accordance with law either by producing\nthe copy of the invoices or by examining the persons who\nissued the said invoices. As already stated above, DW.89\nin the cross-examination has admitted that, after taking\nthe lease of the premises, M/s. Anjaneya Printers (P) Ltd.,\nhave purchased the machines from the above Company.\nFor all these reasons, the contention raised by the accused\nis rejected.\n\nAt para-85 of the impugned judgment deals with\nFootwear. The learned Sessions Judge has made\nobservation at para-85.2 as under:-\n\nThough this evidence may suggest extravagant life\nlead by the inmates residing at Door No.36, in the absence\nof clear and definite evidence to show that the said 386\npairs of footwear found in the house were purchased by A-\n1 and that, these footwear were exclusively worn by her,\nA-1 cannot be fastened with the entire cost, especially\nwhen it is brought out in the evidence that, in addition to\nA-1, number of other persons including maids were\nresiding in the house. Prosecution has failed to prove that,\nthe above 386 pairs of footwear were in the possession of\nA-1 alone. The nature of the property is such, the\npossession by others cannot be ruled out. That apart, the\nevidence led in by the prosecution is not sufficient to\ndetermine the value of these footwear in the absence of the\nnature and quality of the footwear, their make, brand and\nthe year of manufacture. Therefore, the entire amount\nunder this head is deducted.\n\nAt para-86 of the impugned judgment deals with\nSarees. The learned Sessions Judge at para-86.2 has\nmade the following observation:\n\nAdmittedly, no one has laid a claim to the sarees\nseized from the house of A-1. Therefore, the argument of\nthe learned counsel that there is no evidence to show that\nthe seized sarees exclusively belonged to A-1 holds no\nwater. There is no dispute regarding the number of sarees\nvalued by PW.133. Though the number looks stupefying,\nyet, it should not be forgotten that, prior to joining\npolitics, A-1 was in Cine field, therefore, there is nothing\nunusual in having a taste for costly and fancy sarees by A-\n1. In any case, there being no specific evidence that all\nthe sarees noted in the above observation mahazars were\npurchased during the check period, it would not be safe to\nhold that the sarees listed therein were acquired by A-1\nduring the check period. Hence the value shown under this\nhead cannot be allowed.\n\nPara-87 of the impugned judgment deals with\nWatches. PW.129 identified the seven wrist watches and\nspecified their valuation as under:\n\n1. M.O.584 is Rs. 5,000/-\n2. M.O.585 is Rs. 8,000/-\n3. M.O.586 is Rs. 4,000/-\n4. M.O.587 is Rs. 3,75,000/-\n5. M.O.589 is Rs. 5,000/-\n6. M.O.590 is Rs. 5,00,000/-\n7. M.O.591 is Rs. 6,000/-\n\nIn the cross-examination it is elicited that he did not\nbring with him either the goldsmith or the diamond\nappraiser and he does not deal in gold and diamond\nbusiness. He cannot say in which year the above\nmentioned wrist watches were manufactured. MO.585 is\nmanufactured by Christian Bernard Company. PW.129\nanswered that he does not sell this kind of wrist watches\nin his Company. The Company which manufactures\nMO.586 has sent the price list to PW.129. MO.589 was\nmanufactured by ROLEX Company in Switzerland. It chain\nis made of 18 carat gold. In MO.587, 40 diamonds were\nfixed. These kinds of wrist watches are not sold in India.\nThis witness further answered that his shop has the price\nlist of Rolex Company. MO.589 is RADO wrist watch is\nmade in Switzerland and PW.129 normally does not sell\nRADO wrist watches. Likewise MO.590 is also made is\nSwitzerland and PW.129 does not have the pricelist of that\nCompany.\n\nThis witness was recalled for the second time on\n13.12.2012 and it is elicited that he is not qualified to\nassess the diamond and gold and he did not assess the\nage of the watches and he does not know whether the\nwatches inspected by him were original or duplicate.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed at para-\n87.3 as under:\n\nBased on the above cross-examination the learned\nCounsel for the A-1 has vehemently argued that, PW.129\nhaving not dealt with the watches manufactured by ROLEX\nand BADAK PHILIPI viz., MO.587 and MO.590, he is totally\nincompetent to assess their value and therefore, the\nvaluation of Rs. 3,75,000/- and Rs. 5 lakhs respectively\nfixed by this witness in respect of MOs. 587 and 590 are\nliable to be discarded outright. That apart, this witness has\nadmitted in the cross-examination that he is neither a\ngoldsmith nor a diamond appraiser and therefore, the\nvaluation made by him on the basis of the diamonds\nalleged to have been contained therein cannot be\naccepted. The learned Counsel also pointed out that the\nevidence of PW.129 is silent with regard to the year of\nmanufacture which is crucial for determining the price of\nthe watches and more importantly, prosecution has not\npositively established that A-1 acquired these watches\nduring the check period. It is the submission of the learned\nCounsel that if in fact these watches were manufactured\nduring the check period, the prosecution could have\nprocured the brochure or the price list from the Company\nwhich would have ruled out the possibility of A-1\npossessing the said watches prior to the check period.\nTherefore, it is the submission of the learned Counsel that\nin the absence of any such evidence, solely on the basis of\nthe oral testimony of PW.129 whose evidence cannot be\ntreated that of an expert; A-1 cannot be called upon to\nexplain the exorbitant valuation shown by the prosecution\nunder this head.\nAs the learned Counsel for the accused has raised\nserious objection regarding the valuation of MOs. 587 and\n590, it may be necessary to refer to the description of\nthese two articles in MO.739 which reads as follows:\n\n\"4 - Rolex Ladies 18k - Rs.3,75,000/-(18\ncarat gold-750)\n\"Oyster perpetual Date just\nSuperlative Chronometic officially\ncertified\" Automatic Date, Beoyel\nset in 40 real Diamonds and 10\nreal diamonds on dial with 18k\nbracelet center second wrist\nWatch.\n\nReference Numbers:\n\nBack (Model) reference 69000A\nCaliber No : 2135\nMovement No : 1870313\nSerial No : 69138 (12 side)\nSerial No : E 315884 (6 side)\nSerial No : E 315884 also hand\n\nEngraved inside the back.\nBracelet No : 68B\nHand engraved number inside the back SIS/95\n\n6.

This witness has deposed that,\nhe has experience in assessing the value of wrist watches;\nhe has studied the manufacturing of wrist watches and\nwall clocks in Guindy ITI. On 18.12.1996 he assessed the\n91 wrist watches in the presence of the Inspector Mr.\nShankar and the witnesses Sri. Ponnuswamy and Sri.\nArmugam. A note of proceeding was prepared as per\nEx.P.740 and he has subscribed his signature thereto.\nAccording to him, the total value of 91 wrist watches\nassessed by him is Rs. 6,87,350/-. During his evidence he\nhas identified these wrist watches as MOs.682 to 741 and\nhas specified their make and the price. Further, this\nwitness has deposed that, he deals with TITAN, HMT and\nACCURATE watches in his shop and therefore he knows\nthe price ofthose watches and in respect of other watches,\nhe came to know the price through the customers who had\ncome to his shop for repair of such watches\n\nIn the cross-examination it is elicited that he cannot\nsay in which year the assessed watches were\nmanufactured and further he answered that he assessed\nthe value of the watches manufactured by TITAN, HMT and\nACCURATE on the basis of the price list and in respect of\nthe watches manufactured by other companies, he\nassessed them only from his experience.\n87.6) The testimony of this witness is also assailed\nby the learned Counsel for the accused on the ground that\nhis testimony is inadmissible for the reason that this\nwitness cannot be termed as an expert as he has admitted\nthat he determined the price of the watches on the basis\nof the price disclosed by his customers and therefore no\ncredence could be given to the testimony of this witness\nand it has to be held that, PW.130 has no expertise or\ncompetency whatsoever to fix the valuation of these\nwatches, as a result Ex.P.740 as well as the oral evidence\nadduced by the prosecution in proof of the valuation of the\nwrist watches is liable to be discarded in entirety.\n\n87.7) From the above evidence, prosecution has\nproved that, these watches were in the possession of A-1.\nIt is not the case of A-1 that these watches belong to any\nother persons. In order to substantiate the charge u/Sec.\n13(1)(e) of the Act, the prosecution must prove the nature\nand extent of the pecuniary resources or property which\nare found in possession of the accused. Once this\ningredient is established, the burden of satisfactorily\naccounting for the possession of such resource shifts to\nthe accused. Though the standard of proof may not be as\nheavy as on the prosecution, yet, the explanation offered\nmust be reasonable and plausible. In the instant case, A-1\nhas not offered any explanation with regard to the\npossession of the said watches. There is absolutely no\nmention whatsoever about the acquisition of these costly\nwatches in her wealth returns. A-1 did not offer any\nexplanation at the earliest point of time that these watches\nwere purchased by her prior to the check period. Under\nthe said circumstance, the only inference that could be\ndrawn is that, A-1 purchased these watches during the\ncheck period.\n\n87.8) PW.129 and PW.130 have given objective\nassessment of the watches and have furnished the basis\non which they arrived at the rate of the watches which is\nnot shown to be false by producing the purchase bills or\nany other contra evidence to doubt or disbelieve their\nevidence. Hence, relying on the evidence of the above\nwitnesses, the entire valuation is accepted.\n\nPara 87.9 of the impugned judgment deals with\ntabular column of assets as on 30.4.1996 as under:\n\nNature of\nassets Item Nos.

If prosecution is able to prove that\nthere could not have been any other source than the\naccused himself, offence can be brought home against him.\nNormal human conduct and presumptions can be utilized\nfor this purpose.\n\nThe prosecution has included the properties acquired\nby the following companies to the account of A-1. The\ncompanies are:\n(a) M/s. Lex Property Development (P) Ltd.,\n(b) Meadow Agro Farms (Pvt) Ltd.,\n(c) Riverway Agro Products (Pvt) Ltd.,\n(d) M/s. Ramaraj Agro Mills Ltd.,\n(e) M/s.

This\nwitness unequivocally stated before the Court as under;\n\n\"We did not buy any properties in the name\nofthat Company.

This sanction\nletter is dated 15.03.1995 and it is mentioned therein that\nthe amount of Rs.45,00,000/- already released by the\nBranch is to be absorbed in this loan.\n\n89.13) Ex.P.1320 discloses that, the C.A.

Ltd., are also produced in\nevidence and the corresponding witnesses to prove these\ndocuments are examined.\n\n90.8) This witness has also deposed about the\npreparation of the power of attorneys Ex.P.191 to P.196\nand the sale deed executed on the strength of the said\npower of attorneys as per Ex.P.197 dated 15.03.1995 in\nfavour of Maedows Agro Farms ltd., for Rs.54,050/-.\nFurther this witness has deposed that on the strength of\nthe power of attorney Ex.P.206 executed by its vendors,\nhe executed the sale deed in favour of Maedow Agro\nFarms Ltd., on 29.04.1995 as per Ex.P.207 and on the\nstrength of the power of attorneys Ex.P.208 to 213, he\nexecuted the sale deed in respect of 15.71 acres of land\non 29.04.1995. It is the further evidence of PW.56 that on\nthe strength of the power of attorneys Ex.P.215 to P.220,\nhe executed a sale deed in favour of Maedow Agro Farms\nLtd., on 09.06.1995 as per Ex.p.221. According to this\nwitness, \"all the above documents were registered in the\noffice of the North Chennai Sub-Registrar before D.I.G.\nand the expenses for the documents were borne by\nSudhakaran on behalf of the Maedow Agro Farms Ltd.,\"\nThus, according to PW.56, under the above sale deeds he\nsold 105.99½ acres of land and received a total sale price\nof Rs.10.60 lakhs.\nIn the cross-examination he denied the suggestion\nthat A-3 Sudhakaran has not given him Rs.3.00 lakhs as\nadvance. The evidence of this witness regarding the\nexecution of the various sale deeds mentioned above on\nthe strength of the power of attorneys executed in his\nfavour are not at all challenged in the cross-examination.\n\n90.9) PW.159 Thiru Rajagopalan is examined to\nspeak regarding the registration of the sale deeds marked\nin evidence as Exs.P.68, 69, 70, 75 to 79, 96 to 110, 122\nto 125, 135 to 139, 143 to 148, 153 to 156, 161, 165,\n167, 174, 180, 184, 190, 197, 207, 214, 221, 291, 324,\n330, 339, 345, 350, 357, 363, 366, 377, 388, 396, 408,\n419, 431, 443, 450, 456, 467, 472, 477, 488, 513, 515,\n771, 717, 772, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912\nand 913.\n\nDW.86 has got marked Exs.D187 and D189.\nEx.D.189 copy of the returns is seen to have been filed\nonly on 19.04.2001. The copy of the Balance Sheet for the\nyear ending 31.03.1996 is marked as Ex.D.188, the copy\nof the schedule to the annual returns as Ex.D.189 and it is\nstated that, the said schedule contains the list of who\ncontributed the share capital amounting to\nRs.1,06,55,000/-, but the names of none of the accused\nfinds place in Ex.D.189. This witness has further deposed\nthat the balance sheet filed by M/s. Meadow Agro Farms\n(Pvt) Ltd., would show that the Company had invested\nRs.21,53,738/- on fixed assets viz., land and sum of\nRs.21,09,000/- on shares in other companies. The said\nschedule also would indicate that the Company had lent\nRs.32,90,000/- to A.2 Sasikala and Rs.62,50,000/- to M/s.\nJaya Publications. The returns itself having been filed in\nthe year 2000, this document could not have been filed in\n3.4.1998, nor is there anything to show that R. Kumar and\nA.Jayaraman were the Directors of Meadow Agro Farms\n(Pvt) Ltd., at the relevant point of time. All these\ncircumstances go to show that, these documents are got\nup to support of the false defence set up by the accused.\nEx.D.189 also does not improve the case of the accused,\nnor does it inspire confidence to accept the contents of the\nsaid document in as much as this schedule to the annual\nreturn is seen to have been filed before the R.O.C. only on\n19.04.2001 as could be seen from the seal of the\nCompany.\n\n90.19) Ex.D.190 is said to be the note order passed\nby the Income Tax Authorities on the return of income\nfiled by M/s. Meadow Agro Farms (Pvt) Ltd., It is not\nknown under what provision of law, such an order could be\npassed and what is the evidentiary value thereof. It is\ninteresting to note that in the said note, the Directors are\nshown as (1) K. Krishnakumar Reddy and (2) K. Anil\nKumar Reddy. As already stated above, PW.106\nSri.Krishnakumar Reddy has unequivocally has stated\nbefore the Court that, he and the other Director signed\ncertain forms in 1994 and sold the Company and they are\nnot in possession of the Company. Ex.P.601 produced by\nthe prosecution unimpeachably establishes that both the\nsaid Directors have resigned on 03.08.1994. But, curiously\nthey are shown as the Directors of the Company on the\ndate of the order i.e., 30.03.2000, which itself is sufficient\nto discard the document as unreliable. Even otherwise, the\ncontents of the said document do not advance the defence\nset up by A-3. In the said order it is noted that the\nCompany had practically no business activities since its\ninception and had not filed any return of income and for\nthe assessment year 1996-97 also, the assessee did not\nfile any return of income and is is only after notices were\nissued, the return of income came to be filed on\n29.03.2000 admitting NIL income.\n90.20) What turns out from the above evidence is\nthat, even though the Company was registered as back as\nin 1990, it had no business activities whatsoever, until the\nCompany was taken over by A-3 and A-4. Secondly, the\nCompany was not assessed to Income Tax. The\ndocuments produced by the accused are seen to have\ncome into existence only after the year 2000. According to\nthe accused, during the investigation, the premises of\nMeadow Agro Farms (Pvt) Ltd., were searched and all the\ndocuments and records pertaining to the Company were\nseized. If so, the Company could not have filed the returns\nwithout there being proper records to support the return.\nEven though much has been argued that the Company had\nits own resources, the accused has not been able to\nproduce even the bank account statement standing in the\nname of the Company to justify the contention that the\nproperties registered in the name of the Company were\npurchased out of the funds of the Company. On the other\nhand, the direct evidence produced by the prosecution\nclinchingly establishes that the entire funds for the\npurchase of the properties emanated from the accused\nand the said properties were never treated as the\nproperties of the Company.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed in respect\nof theRiverway Agro Products Pvt. Ltd as under:\n\n91. PW-96 Raghuram has deposed that in 1990, he\nand Prabhakar Reddy started a Partnership Company\ncalled Riverway Agro Products (Pvt) Ltd., but no business\nor transaction was being done. Subbarama Reddy\nsuggested to sell the concern. In June, 1994, Prabhakar\nReddy and he went to Subbaramu Reddy's office and\nsigned some papers for transfer of the Company in the\nnames of Sudhakaran and Elavarasi and they gave them\nRs.2,000/- each in the form of two cheques. The cheque\nreceived by him was signed by Sudhakaran. Through this\nwitness the prosecution has marked Ex.P.576 and P.577,\nthe certified copies of Memorandum of Association and\nArticles of Association. Even in the cross-examination he\nreiterated that when he signed the forms, the name of\nV.N.Sudhakaran and Elavarasi were mentioned therein.\n\nThe evidence of PW.94 - R. Laxmi Narayanan, the\nPersonal Assistant to Company Registrar reveals that\nEx.P579 - Form No.32 was submitted appointing\nV.N.B.Sharma and V.Babu as additional directors. On\n21.07.1994 another Form No.32 was submitted stating\nthat V.N.Sudhakaran and Elavarasi were appointed as\nadditional directors on 15.07.1994. This witness has\nfurther deposed that, Raghuram and Prabhakar Reddy\nresigned from the Directors post from 18.07.1994 and\nw.e.f. 10.08.1994.\n\nThe other details of the money deposited into this\nCurrent A/c. no.1095 are as under;\nPay-in-slip Date Person signed in the slip Cash amount\nNo. and the address given Rs.\nEx.P.1301 03.12.94 M.

Ltd., for Rs.16,600/-. This witness has\ndeposed that, as per the guidelines, the value of the\nSurvey No.490/3A1 in 1994 was Rs.26,000/- per acre.\nSale deeds were execution for 5½ acres of land in favour\nof Riverway Agro Products Pvt.Ltd., for RS.16,600/-.\nBut, as per the Orders on I.A. 321, PW.71 was\nrecalled by the learned PP and was specifically asked as to\nwhich of the two versions given by him before the court\nare correct, for which PW 71 answered that the statement\ngiven by him in his examination-in-chief and the cross-\nexamination in2001 are correct. In the cross-examination\nby the defence counsel, the witness denied that he had\nmisused his official power and answered that the\ngovernment has not taken any action against him for the\nalleged misuse of his official power and he did not\ncomplain against anyone that he should compel to speak\nbefore the court.\n\nPW.76 is a Real Estate Agent has stated that\nlikewise, on different dates, he got registered the power of\nattorneys in his name for Rs.1167.57 acres of land for a\ntotal amount of Rs.23,34,040/-. Rs.5,84,000/- was given\nto the local brokers.\nIn the cross-examination this witness has answered\nthat he is not an income tax assessee and since he\nreceived the commission of only Rs.100/- per acre, he did\nnot find it necessary to file income tax returns. He\nmaintained in the cross-examination that apart from\nRajagopal and A-3, a party from Kerala and other\nprospective buyers had also approached him regarding the\nland which was sold to Riverway Agro Products Private Ltd.,\nPW.76 was also subjected to grueling cross-\nexamination in installments commencing from 14.02.2001\nto 21.02.2001. This witness was recalled on 28.01.2003 at\nthe instance of the accused and during the further cross-\nexamination on behalf of A-1, 2 and 4, this witness\nsubstantially prevaricated from his earlier statements and\nstated on oath that pursuant to the advertisement given\nby him in 'Dinathand' and 'Hindu' one Krishnan, an\naccountantfrom Riverway Agro Products Pvt. Ltd.,\napproached him and his friends regarding the sale of lands\nand he and his friends doing the real estate business\napproached the land owners and got the power of\nattorneys and executed the sale deeds in favour of\nRiverway Agro Products Pvt. Ltd., During his evidence\nPW.76 deposed that, land owners gave commission for\nhim and other brokers and he did not receive an other\ncommission. He further deposed that, he did not have any\ncontact with Thiru Rajagopal, District Registrar and he did\nnot know PW.71 Radhakrishnan He also asserted that he\ndid not know Sudhakaran, has only heard his name. He\nalso resiled from his earlier statement that he had\ninformed Rajagopal, District Registrar about the\navailability of the land and they had been to Tirunelveli.\nHe denied that on 8th and 9th July 1994 Thiru Rajagopal\nintroduced Sudhakaran to him at Thirunelveli. He also\ndenied having visited Thirunelveli along with the said\nRajagopal and maintained that all the transactions were\ncarried out at the instance of Krishnan, accountant of M/s.\nRiverway Agro Products Pvt. Ltd., Further, he denied\nhaving made a statement \"the brokers whobought and\ngave the land to me ending with that \"Rajagopal,\nJayalalitha, Sasikala and sudakaran are only purchasing\nthose lands.\" Further, this witnessstated on oath that, on\n07.09.1997 when he came to his residence, he was\nthreatened by Nallamma Naidu and therefore, he had\ngiven false evidence before the Court. 76He further\ndeposed that, during his first enquiry, the police officers\nrelated to this case compelled him to tell the names of the\naccused who were not connected with the case regarding\nthe dealings.\n\n91.16) Pursuant to the orders of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, the prosecution recalled this\nwitness for further examination and in the course of the\nreexamination held on 19.01.2011, the learned Spl.P.P.\nspecifically put a question to the witness as under;\n\nQ: In your evidence in the first instance\nbefore the Chennai court you have given\nevidence regarding the negotiations resulting\nin execution of sale deeds and power of\nattorneys but later in 2003 after you were\nrecalled you have given contradictory\nstatements. Which of the two versions is true\nand correct?\nA: The version given by me in the first\ninstance is true and correct.\n\n91.17) The witness was permitted to be cross-\nexamined by the defence and in the cross-examination, it\nwas asked to the witness that, even in the cross-\nexamination also he had stated the truth for which he\nreplied that he had signed the cross-examination, but he\ndid not know the contents thereof. He denied the\nsuggestion that in his re-examination he has given false\nevidence at the instance of the police.\n\nNotwithstanding the prevarication by the witness,\nthe sequence of events narrated by him with regard tothe\ncircumstances surrounding the execution and registration\nof the various sale deeds have remained unshaken. Even\notherwise, the contemporaneous documents spoken to by\nthis witness lend full credence to the testimony of this\nwitness regarding his involvement in the procurement of\nthe properties at the instance of A-3. More importantly,\nwhat turns out from the evidence of the above witnesses\nis that, the so called Riverway Agro Products Pvt. Ltd., was\nno way in the picture and the funds of the said Company\nwere not utilized for the purchase and registration of these\nproperties.\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed in respect\nof the Ramaraj Agro Mills Ltd., as under:\n\nPW.52 Gandhi has deposed that he and Ramaraj\nAgro Mills Ltd, had bought 6,10,000/- shares at the rate of\nRs. 5/- per share. He could not get proper income from\nthe said mill and decided to sell it. In 1994, Ramaswamy\nUdayar brought Sudhakaran to them and asked them to\nsell the mill.

D-208, the learned counsel for A-1\nfurther submitted that the company had borrowed a loan\nof Rs. 1 Cr. from Magunta Investments Pvt. Ltd., towards\nICD and the conformation in this regard was produced\nbefore the Income-tax authorities as per Ex. D-208 and\nDW.87 has spoken about all these transactions, which\nclearly indicate that the company was possessed sufficient\nneeds and resources to acquire the properties and to\neffect construction therein. Moreover, the prosecution has\nnot produced any material before the court either to show\nthat A-1 had advanced any funds for the acquisition of the\nsaid assets, nor is there any evidence on record to indicate\nthat A-2 to A-4 had advanced any funds towards the\nacquisition of the said properties. Therefore, the entire\namount shown in item Nos. 146 and 147 are liable to be\ndeducted.\n\nBefore appreciating the contention urged by the\nlearned counsel for A-1, it may be relevant to refer the\nevidence of PW 153 the Superintending Engineer in Tamil\nNadu Public Works Department, who has deposed\nregarding the inspection of the labour quarters and the\ncompound wall under construction in Ramaraj Agro Mills\nCampus at Vandampalai. According to this witness, he has\nworked in Public Works Department for about 35 years\nand for many years he has worked in Construction Division\nonly. An order was issued to the PWD Chief Engineer on\n20.11.1996 to assess the buildings in the premises of\nRamaraj Agro Mills Ltd., at Vandam Palayam in A.T.\nPanner Selvam district. Kaliyappan, Asst. Executive\nEngineer, Karunakaran, an Asst. Engineer, Manian, a Jr.\nEngineer and Rajaraman, an Electrical Engineer were\nappointed to assist him in the assessment from\n27.11.1996 to 29.11.1996. They inspected all the\nbuildings and took the measurement and then prepared\nthe assessment report on the basis of the respective order\nof construction and on the schedule rate of PWD, prepared\nthe assessment report as per Ex. P-822 and he arrived at\nthe total value of the civil work at Rs. 139.56 lakh,\nelectrical works at Rs. 10.734 lakh and total of Rs.\n150.294 lakh. He has specifically deposed regarding the\nvalue fixed by him for the buildings constructed during the\nyears 1991-92 and during 1994-95.\nIn the cross-examination, it is elicited that there was\nno written order to inspect the buildings. From 27.11.1996\nto 29.11.1996 when they inspected the buildings, two\nworkers from the mill assisted them in digging and other\nallied works. It is elicited that the court order was not\nissued and he did not serve any written notice on the\ncompany. It is further elicited that the Electrical Engineer,\nwho assessed the electrical works belong to the Public\nWorks Department. In those buildings, workers quarters\n(30 residences in two buildings), a go-down, a guest\nhouse in the 1st floor and the compound wall were\ncompletely done. In the bungalow for the Managing\nDirector, two twin houses and a house of quarters were\nbuilt. Electrical fittings were not fixed and the final coat of\npainting was also not done. In the cross-examination, it is\nelicited that the reports were written in two different ink\npens. The Asst. Engineer, Karunakaran wrote the report.\nIn the report, it was written as 'for the subsequent year'\nand it was struck and corrected as 'respective' in different\nink. It is also elicited that the Asst. Engineer Karunakaran\nprepared the plan and notes under his supervision. He\nvalued the buildings on the basis of the PWD rates. The\nrate list is not enclosed to Ex. P-822 and it does not have\nthe details. As the water supply and sewerage were\nconcealed, he consider those rates as per PWD norms. The\nrate of electrical fittings were also fixed at the rate of\nPWD. From local enquiry and his experience, he\ndetermined the age of the buildings.\n\nThough this witness was fully cross-examined, he\nwas recalled and subjected for further cross-examination\non 24.12.2012 and he made contradictory statements\nregarding the age of the buildings as well as the rates\napplied by him for assessment of the value of the\nbuildings. But, when he was recalled at the instance of the\nPublic Prosecutor and was subjected to re-examination by\nputting a question, he has given two different versions\nregarding the year of construction of the buildings and\nwhich amongst the two versions is the correct one, PW\n153 categorically answered that the earlier version i.e., he\nhas stated in his examination-in-chief is correct. During\nthe cross-examination by the counsel for A-1, he answered\nthat during his first examination in the year 2000, his\ndeposition has been made over and accordingly, accepted\nit as correct and signed it. But, in so far as his deposition\nin the year 2002 is concerned, he was not permitted to go\nthrough the deposition and was asked to sign the same in\nthe presence of the counsel for the accused.\n\nThe learned counsel for A-1 has seriously disputed\nthe liability and admissibility of the report submitted by\nPW.153 contending that the valuation report submitted by\nhim is interpolated and he has not furnished the verifiable\ndata either to determining the age of the buildings or the\nrate for the construction. In support of his arguments, the\nlearned counsel referred the evidence of DW 81 M.\nKarunakaran, Asst. Executive Engineer, PWD, who was\npart of the team in the preparation of the valuation report\nEx. P-822. This witness deposed on oath that, at the time\nwhen he signed the report Ex. P.822, in the last para, it\nwas mentioned as 'The rates for the materials and labour\nare arrived at adopting the schedule rates for the\nsubsequent years for execution and the individual values\nare worked for each year and the total amount works out\nto Rs. 139.56 lakh. But, it is now seen that, in the above\nlast para in the 3rd line, the words 'for the subsequent'\nhave been struck off and there is inter-lineations of the\nportions 'at the respect.' Further, this witness deposed\nthat the report was signed individually and at the time of\ninspection, no representative of M/s. Ramaraj Agro Mills\nLtd. was present.\n\nIn appreciating the testimony of this witness, it is\nrelevant to note that this witness has not disputed the fact\nthat he was also one of the members of the team along\nwith PW 153 in the assessment and valuation of the\nworkers quarters and the compound wall. He has not\ndenied the fact that during the inspection, the\nmeasurements of the buildings were taken and the rates\nwere determined on the basis of the PWD rates. As a\nmatter of fact, Ex. P-822 not only contains the report duly\nsigned by PW 153, DW 81 and other Engineers including\nthe Electrical Engineer, who were part of the assessment\nteam, but also contains the detailed estimate with\nreference to the measurements of individual items of\nworks running to nearly 219 pages and along with the plan\nof the buildings and the compound wall duly signed by all\nthe above persons including DW 81, which has remained\nun-impeached.\nNo doubt, it is true that in the report there are\ninterlineations as stated by DW 81, but I do not find that\nthe said interlineations has the effect of nullifying the\nentire contents of Ex. P-822 or the oral testimony of PW\n153. Though the learned counsel has made much of the\nfact that \"rates for the subsequent years\" is scored off and\nin its place \"at the respective year\" is inserted, nothing\nturns out from the said corrections as is published. It is\nnot the case of either party that PWD publishes the rates\nfor the subsequent years. In the cross-examination of PW\n153 itself, it is elicited that every year the rates could be\npublished in writing by the Superintending Engineer. It is\nnot the case of the accused that the rates for the\nsubsequent years are being published in the previous\nyears. Under the said circumstances, there is no question\nof applying the rates for the subsequent years for\ndetermining the assessment done in the relevant year.\nTherefore, the objections raised by the learned counsel for\nA-1 do not merit acceptance.\n\nThe accused have not disputed the fact that the\nworkers quarters as described in the report and the\ncompound wall was being constructed at the relevantyear.\nOn consideration of the evidence of DW 81, I find that this\nwitness is totally a false witness and has no regard for\ntruth whatsoever. From the circumstances brought out in\nthe cross-examination of this witness clearly suggests that\nhe is propped by the accused to support the false defence\nset up in a bid to offer explanation to the huge assets\namassed in the name of the company. In appreciating the\nevidence of DW 81, it is important to note that being a\npublic servant, who was deputed to assist PW 153 and\nparticipated during the evaluation of the structures and\nthe compound wall and he himself scribed the report in his\nown hand writing, has even gone to the extent of denying\nthe suggestion in the cross-examination, which reads that\n\"It is not true to suggest that I put signatures\nin Ex. P-822 after going through the contents\nof upon being satisfied about the correctness\nof the said report.\"\n\n92.26) When he has admitted in his evidence that\nEx. P.822 is in his own handwriting, it cannot be believed\nthat he has signed the report without knowing the\ncontents thereof. This statement not only dents the\ncredibility of his evidence given before the court, but\nraises serious questions of his continuation in government\nservice. His evidence suggests that either he has been\ncareless or negligent in performance of his duties or that\nhe has deliberately given false evidence unmindful of the\nconsequences that would emanate from his evidence.\nNevertheless, it stands established that, by the statements\nmade before the court, he has rendered himself liable for\nDepartmental Enquiry for the misconduct referred above.\n\n92.27) In so far as the documents produced by the\naccused is concerned, it is necessary to note that Ramaraj\nAgro Mills Ltd., is a public limited company. As per the\nprovisions of the\nCompanies Act\n, it is required to maintain\nproper accounts complying with the accounting standards.\nAt every annual meeting, the Board of Directors are\nrequired to lay the balance sheet, profit and loss accounts\nstatement and report of the Directors etc., which would\nhave been the best evidence regarding the share capital,\nreserves and liabilities of the company. But, strangely in\nproof of the asset s and liabilities of the company, the\naccused have relied on the oral testimony of DW 87 the\nChartered Accountant, who is stated to have been involved\nin the auditing of the accounts of M/s Ramaraj Agro Mills\nLtd., But, bare perusal of the documents marked through\nthis witness at Exs. D-204 to D-208, on the face of it, it\nreveal that the said documents got up by the accused only\nto bolster of false defence set up by the accused. Ex.D.204\nis certified to be the true copy of the Form No. 3 CA viz.,\nthe audit report filed on behalf of M/s Ramaraj Agro Mills\nLtd., It is dt. 22.11.1994. The audit report is marked as\nEx. D-206 and it is dt. 1.9.1995. This document is certified\nas true copy by R. Vaidyanathan, partner of S.\nVenkataram & Co., On the face of it, this document is not\nadmissible under law neither it is a certified copy, nor is\nthe author of this document examined to prove the said\ndocument, as such no reliance could be placed on this\ndocument. Even otherwise, this document which is dt.\n1.9.1995 could not have been the part of Ex. D-204. There\nis nothing to indicate that either Ex. D-204 or Ex. D-206\nwere produced before the income-tax authorities and any\norder has been passed thereon. The profit and loss\naccount statement for the year ending 31.3.1995 and the\nbalance sheet for the said period are enclosed to the said\nauditor report, which are also certified by the partner of S.\nVenkataram & Co., Neither the Directors, nor the partners,\nwho have signed the documents are examined before the\ncourt. It is also not known who has signed this balance\nsheet and the profit and loss account statement. The\ncertified copy of the annual returns filed by Ramaraj Agro\nMills Ltd., is marked as Ex. D-205. The endorsement\ntherein indicates that the said returns were filed only on\n30.9.2000. It is seen to have been signed by one A.\nKuppusamy as the Director of the company. Though the\nannexures to the said returns are not produced, this\ndocument clearly indicates that the returns in respect of\nthe company were filed in the year 2000. Under the said\ncircumstances, Ex. D-204, D-206 and D-207, which are\ncertified as the true copies by Venkataram & Co., lead to\ninevitable conclusion that these documents were got up by\nthe accused and these documents were neither the part of\nthe returns, nor were produced by the Income-tax\nauthorities at any time.\n\n92.28) Though the accused have contended that Rs.\n1 Cr. was availed as loan from Magunta Investments Pvt.,\nLtd., company, the accused has neither produced any\nreliable evidence in proof of the availment of the loan, nor\nthey have examined the author of Ex. D-208 or the\nrecipient thereto. Ex. D-208 is said to be the conformation\nletter issued by Magunta Investments Pvt., Ltd., in proof\nof the loan availed by the company. It is dt. 8.2.1996,\nwhich reads as under;\n\"Paid to M/s Ramaraj Agro Mills Pvt. Ltd., DD\n(vide Global Trust Bank Ltd. Ch. No. 017715,\ndt. 8.2.1996) for Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (Rs. One\nCrore only) towards I.C.D.,\n\nSd./-\nFor MAGUNTA INVESTMENTS PVT.\nLTD.,\nDirector/Authorized signatory.\"\n\n92.29) There is absolutely no supporting document\nby way of bank payment book or proof of either issuance\nof DD or the cheque or encashment by M/s Ramaraj Agro\nMills Ltd., in proof of the said loan. The accused have\nsought to sustain the defence solely on the basis of\nAuditor's report and the so-called profit and loss account\nstatement and the balance sheet, which undoubtedly has\nbeen got up without any basis or supporting bank\ndocuments required under the\nCompanies Act\n.\n\n92.30) The testimony of PW 182 the Chief Manager,\nIndian Bank, Abhiramapuram Branch reveals that, by\nsubmitting an application, dt. 22.12.1994 as per Ex.\nP.1341, A-3 opened C.A. No. 1143 in the name of Ramaraj\nAgro Mills Ltd., company. This application does not contain\nthe seal of the company, nor is it accompanied by any\nresolution of the company to open the account. Be that it\nmay, the statement of account relating to this C.A. No.\n1143 discloses that the said account was opened on\n23.12.1994 with a deposit of Rs. 1500/-. There is a credit\nentry for Rs. 8,60,000/- by transfer on 7.1.1995. There is\nno other credit entry. A self-cheque for Rs. 1,55,000/- is\nseen to have been passed on 7.1.1995 and that cheque is\nsigned by A-3 as authorized signatory of Ramaraj Agro\nMills Ltd., as per Ex. P-1345. On 7.1.1995 a cheque for Rs.\n6,98,000/-was passed in favour of the BBO. PW 182 has\nexplained that Ex. P-1347 is the application, dt. 71.1995\nsubmitted by one Ram Vijayan for issuance of Bank Pay\nOrders for Rs. 6,98,000/-. It is marked as Ex. P-1347 and\nhe has further stated that the Pay Orders were asked in\nthe name of the persons as per the list. Though the\nindividual Pay Orders or DDs corresponding to the sale\nconsideration paid under document Nos. 25 to 29 is not\nspoken to by PW 182, yet in the sale deeds referred to\nabove viz., Exs. P-143 to P-147, the sale consideration is\nshown to have been paid by means of DDs bearing Nos.\n626328, 6263330, 626329, 626333 and BPO 121333, dt.\n7.1.1995 issued by the Indian Bank, which co-relates to\nthe amounts drawn through this account.\n\n92.31) Through the above witness, the prosecution\nhas marked the statement of account relating to OD 78\nstanding in the name of Ramaraj Agro Mills Ltd., as per\nEx. P-1348. This account was opened on 4.2.1995. On the\nsame day, a cheque for Rs. 25,02,250/- has been passed\nunder MT Thiruvarur. On 9.2.1995 a cheque for Rs. 25\nlakh was passed in favour of BBO. On 21.2.1995 an\namount of Rs. 50 lakh was transferred from C.A. No. 1113\nto this account. On the same day, there was a debit entry\nfor Rs. 50,05,500/- by MT Thiruvarur. On 23.2.1995 an\namount of Rs. 50 lakh has been credited to this account by\ntransfer from OCC-19. On 25.2.1995 there is a debit entry\nfor Rs. 50,03,500/- by MT Thiruvarur. On 26.3.1995 to\ndebit the balance from this account was transferred to\nOCC - 19 account and then the account was closed. There\nwas a debit balance of Rs. 55,38,023.65 at the time of\ntransfer on that day.\n\n92.32) Ex.P-1349 is the application signed and\nsubmitted by V.N. Sudhakaran to open a OCC-19 account\nin the name of Ramaraj Agro Mills Ltd., Ex. P-1350 is the\nphoto copy of Form No. 32. One Gandhi has signed in it on\n19.2.1994. Ex. P-1351 is the letter signed and submitted\nby V.N. Sudhakaran asking for a loan of Rs. 200 lakh for\nthe company. Ex. P-1352 is the sanction ticket received\nfrom their head office sanctioning a loan (OCC) of Rs. 165\nlakh and it is dt. 24.3.1995. Ex.P.1353 is the copy of the\ntelex message sent from the central office asking to\ntransfer the sanctioned loan of Rs. 165 lakh to the same\ncompany's account in the Thiruvarur Branch of Indian\nBank. Ex. P-1354 is the statement of account of OCC-19.\nOn 23.2.1995 an amount of Rs. 50 lakh has been\ntransferred from this account to OD-78. On 11.3.1995 an\namount of Rs. 50,03,500/- has been debited by cheque by\nMT. Thiruvarur. On 26.3.1995 an amount of Rs.\n55,38,023.65 has been transferred from OD-78 account to\nthis account and debited. Money has been credited into\nthis account many times by MT Thiruvarur. As on\n30.4.1996 in this account, the amount due to the bank\nwas Rs. 39,10,781/-. An amount of Rs. 17,93,002/- was\ndebited from this account towards interest till 30.4.1996.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed in respect\nof the Signora Business Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. as under:\n\n93. As per the evidence of PW.94 R. Lakshmi\nNarayanan, Personal Assistant to Company Registrar,\nSignora Business Enterprises Pvt., Ltd., was registered in\nthe office of the Company Registrar on 22.10.1990 with\nregistration No. 19806 of 1990. The Certificate of\nRegistration is at Ex. P-586. Ex. P-587 is the Memorandum\nof Association and Ex. P-588 is the Article of Association.\nThe company was started by Sri Bhaskar Reddy from\nNellore and Narayana Rao of Chennai. They were the 1st\nDirectors. The company's official address was L-17/4, 26th\nCross, Besant Nagar, Chennai. On 13.3.1992, Form No. 18\nwas submitted regarding the change of office address as\nper Ex. P-589. On 7.9.1994, Form No. 32 was submitted\nintimating resignation of P. Krishna Rao and B. Narayana\nReddy with effect from 29.8.1994 and the appointment of\nA-3 V.N. Sudhakaran and A-4 J. Elavarasi as the Addl.\nDirectors with effect from 17.8.1994 as per E. P-598. On\n24.11.1994 Form No. 18 was submitted for having\nchanged the office of the company to No. 21, 1st Floor,\nWellington Plaza as per Ex. P-591. Thereafter, another\nForm No. 32 was filed on 28.5.1996 stating that Manohar\nand Hari Krishna from Bombay were appointed as Addl.\nDirectors on 17.2.1996 and on 5.2.1996 respectively as\nper Ex.

Thereafter,\nPW 94 did not receive any information about the change of\naddress of the said company.\nIn the cross-examination, it is elicited that the\ncompany had filed the Returns for the year1991-92 and\n1992-93. The copies of the Returns and the Balance sheet\nwith Auditor's report filed on 5.5.1993 by Narayana Rao\nand V.S. Bhaskar Reddy reveal that the authorized capital\nof the company was Rs. 10 lakh and the paid up capital\nwas only 900 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each amounting\nRs. 9,000/-. In the Auditor's report, dt. 9.9.1993, it is\nspecifically stated that the company has no fixed assets\nand there were no stocks and the company had not given\nor taken any loan from the firms or companies or its\nManagers. Thus, from the documents marked through this\nwitness coupled with his oral evidence, it stands\nestablished that, after the resignation of the earlier\nDirectors, A-3 and A-4 became the Directors of the\naforesaid company on 17.8.1994 and resigned on\n5.3.1996 and 12.3.1996 respectively. There is nothing on\nrecord to show that the company had filed any Annual\nReturns or the Balance sheet subsequent to A-3 and A-4\nbecame the Directors thereof. There is also nothing on\nrecord to show that either A-3 or A-4 had subscribed the\nshares of the company or had contributed to the capital of\nthe company.\n\n93.2) Regarding various properties purchased by\nthis Firm after A-3 and A-4 became its Directors, PW.9\nSadagopan, the Sub-Registrar, Cheyyur has deposed that,\nduring the year 1993 when he was working as Sub-\nRegistrar at Seyyoor, he registered the sale deed executed\nby M/s K.

P-38\nwas executed on 20.4.1993 and he registered it for Rs.\n41,250/- (market value was Rs. 71,050/-) and on\n25.6.1993 he registered Ex. P-39 executed in favour of the\naforesaid Firm for Rs. 55,500/- (market value was Rs.\n82,140/-). In the cross-examination, it is elicited that, at\nthe time of the registration, he ascertained that the sale\nprice has been paid to the vendors and registered all the\ndocuments only after the sellers confirmed that they have\nreceived the cash.\nThe learned Sessions Judge has observed in respect\nof the Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,as\nunder:\n\n94.1) PW.84 further deposed that the share holders\nhad authorised PW.84 to sell the shares and get their\nmoney. Accordingly, PW.84 and A-3 entered into a\nmemorandum of understanding as per Ex.P.510. Through\nthis witness, the prosecution got marked the bank account\nRegister Ex.P.511. PW.84 further deposed that, after\nselling his shares he continued as Chairman of the said\nCompany and further deposed that during 1994, Company\nwas leased to SPIC and he signed the lease documents as\nper Ex.P.512.\n\n94.2) PW.84 further deposed that, in 1994\nNatarajan, DW.2 asked him about the files, ledgers and\ndocuments relating to Indo-Doha Chemical Company. He\ntold him that, all those documents have been given to the\nauditor Sri.Rajasekharan. This witness was recalled on\n07.09.2000 and during the examination by the counsel for\nA-3, he substantially resiled from his earlier testimony\nstating that he has not given any resignation letter during\n1994. He further stated that, in the Board of Directors\nmeeting did not pass any resolution to sell the shares at\nRs.6/- per share. It was resolved as to whom the shares\nwere to be transferred and he does not know whether the\nshares have been transferred to the name of\nV.N.Sudhakaran or not. It is further elicited that till the\nyear 1993 the companysubmitted the yearly returns and\nhe has not informed to the Registrar of Companies about\nthe transfer of shares.\n\nPW.85 - Sreedhar was the Vice-President of Ind\nBank from 1989 to 1997. He has deposed that Bank\npurchased 2,50,000 shares of Indo-Doha Chemicals and\nPharmaceutical at Rs.10/- per share. The shares so\npurchased in 1992 were sold in the year 1994 to\nSudhakaran for Rs.27,41,000/- and the amount was paid\nthrough Canara Bank cheque.\nPW.90 Tmt. Sheela Balakrishnan, Secretary\nAdministration Reforms Department, has deposed that the\nChairman of the Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd., Gandhi, wrote a\nletter to the Managing Directors of S\nIPC\nOT Company\nstating that, V.N.Sudhakaran, T.V. Sundaravadanam, J.\nElavarasi and Tmt. Prabha wereappointed as additional\ndirectors. The existing members Gandhi, Asokan,\nSatyavel, Mahilavannan wrote a letter stating that they\nwithdrew from their post. The said letter is Ex.P.542.\nS\nIPC\nOT agreed for the change of administration. Ex.P.544\nis the resolution of the Board of Meeting. PW.92 - Ketan\nGandhi, Excecutive Director of Interface Capital Market\nPrivate Limited corroborated the testimony of PW.85\nregarding the purchase of shares stating that, Interface\nCapital Market Pvt. Ltd., purchased 2,20,000 shares of\nIndo-Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceauticals Ltd., at\nRs.10/- per share. According to this witness after they\ninvested in the company, the company did not make any\nprofits. Hence they tried to sell the shares and in 1994 Ind\nBank approached PW.92 and holding that, they would\nmake arrangement to sell the share Ex.P.559, letter\nwritten by the Bank to PW.92 and Ex.P.560 is the copy of\nthe letter written by PW.92 to V.N.Sudhakaran regarding\nthe matter. PW.92 further deposed that, a sum of\nRs.24,05,000/- was paid to them through D.Ds.\n\n94.7) PW.93 James Fredric is the Managing Director\nof Intake Products Ltd., He has deposed that, he own a\npesticide factory in Sipcot Industrial Estate, Cuddlore. He\nknows V.N.Sudhakaran who purchased Indo-Doha\nChemicals Company which was beside his factory in the\nSipcot Industrial Estate. Sudhakaran wanted to develop\nhis factory and for that he needed the land of PW.93. He\nwished to buy the factory shares and to take over the\nadministration. As the factory was running at loss and\nhaving a debt of 7 to 8 crores, PW.93 agreed to hand over\nthe administration to Intake Products Ltd., to\nV.N.Sudhakaran and agreed to transfer 8,56,636 shares of\nthe company to V.N.Sudhakaran, who paid Rs.50.00 lakhs\nby way of three cheques. Through this witness,\nprosecution got marked the extract of the Bank account of\nPW.93 as Ex.P.563, copy of the pay-in-slip Ex.P.564,\nP.565. This witness further deposed that, with this money\nhe took a D.D. of Rs.50.00 lakhs in the name of\nCoromandel and settle the debts. Ex.P.566 is the\napplication for the D.D. This witness further deposed that\npresently Intake company is under the control of official\nliquidator.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, except eliciting that\nhe did not tell the police during his enquiry about the extra\nmoney given to him, the other part of his testimony was\nnot challenged. But, this witness was recalled at the\ninstance of the accused and surprisingly in his further\ncross-examination by the accused, this witness stated\nthat, during his chief-examination he did not say anything\nabout Ex.P.563 to P.566 and further stated that Intake\nProducts Ltd., shares were not transferred to the name of\nthird accused and maintained that the shares of the\ncompany are still with PW.93 and the amount of Rs.20.00\nlakhs being the purchase money is also with him. He\ndenied having made any statement before the I.O. But,\npursuant to the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, even this witness was recalled by the learned Spl.\nPublic Prosecutor and was subjected to re-examination\nand was questioned as to whether the statement made by\nhim during his chief-examination to the effect that they\nwere ready to transfer 8,56,636 shares of the company for\nwhich V.N.Sudhakaran gave them three cheques viz.,\ncheque for Rs.20.00 lakhs, Canara Bank, Mylapore,\ncheque for Rs.20.00 lakhs Indian Bank, Mandhaveli, and\ncheque for Rs.10.00 lakhs and the transfer of shares and\nregarding the transfer of his shares, he received only\nRs.20.00 lakhs from the third accused and Rs.20.00 lakhs\nis with him is correct. PW.93 answered that, due to the\nage factor, his memory power has gone weak and\ntherefore he is not in a position to say which of the\nstatement is correct.\n\n94.8) From the above evidence, it could be deduced\nthat,\n\n(i) At the relevant time of acquisition of the above\nproperties, all the above six companies were exclusively in\nthe control and management of A-2 to A-4. As already\nhighlighted above, the promoters had already resigned in\nfavour of A-2 to A-4. Except Indo Doha Pharmaceuticals\nCompany Pvt. Ltd., all other promoters and erstwhile\nDirectors have unequivocally stated before the Court that,\non receipt of the amount invested by them for the\nformation of the Companies, they signed the necessary\nforms and went out of the Company and since then, they\nceasedof any right or interest in the said property.\n\n(ii) The promoter Directors have categorically\nstated before the Court that they did not purchase any\nproperties in their names either before or after the\nformation of the Company as long as they were on the\nBoard of Directors.\n\n(iii) It has come in evidence that A-2 to A-4 took\nover the management of the Company without even\nbuying the requisite shares. Though it is argued by the\ncounsel for A-1 that in terms of the Memorandum of\nAssociation and Articles of the Company, qualifications of\nthe shares is not necessary, yet, the fact remains that A-2\nto A-4 continued the name of the Company without there\nbeing any other shareholders and without purchasing any\nshares by themselves. This is one of the strong\ncircumstances to show that, though the Companies are\nincorporated under the\nCompanies Act\n, they do not have\nany trappings of a company.\n\n(iv) It is proved in evidence that, none of the above\nCompanies had any account in their names. It is only the\nerstwhile Shareholders of M/s. Ramaraj Agro Mills Ltd.,\nhad stated before the Court that the Company had a bank\naccount, but when a specific question was put to this\nwitness as to whether the payment for the purchase of the\nproperties was made from the said bank account, the\nwitness gave an evasive answer making it evident that for\nthe purchase of the properties involved in the case, the\nfunds of the Companies were never utilized.\n\n(v) There is clinching evidence to show that the bank\naccounts were opened by A-2 and A-3 in the name of the\nCompanies only after they took over the management and\ncontrol of the companies and all the transactions relating\nto the said companies are stated to have taken place\nthrough these accounts. But it is necessary to note that\nthe funds were transferred or remitted to these accounts\neither from the bank account held in the name of\nNamadhu MGR, Jaya Publications or other firms run by A-1\n& A-2, which clinches the issue that, the funds for the\nacquisition of the properties had flown from A-1 either\ndirectly or through the accounts maintained in the joint\nnames of of A-1 and A-2.\n\n94.9) It is also important to note that the properties\ninvolved in the trial had never assumed the character of\nthe assets of the Company and did not vest with the\nCompany as contended by the learned Counsel for the\naccused. It is proved in evidence that, no funds of the\nabove named companies were utilized for the acquisition\nof the properties. It is an admitted fact that, none of the\ncompanies had filed returns either before the Registrar of\nCompanies or before the Income Tax Authorities declaring\nthe funds for the purchase of the properties or the\nacquisitions alleged to have been made in the name of the\nCompanies.\nIn the instant case,\nSections 209\n,\n,\nand\nof the Companies Act, 1956, have not been complied.\nReturns have not been filed by the respective companies\nfrom the date of its incorporation till the date of\nattachment of the properties.\n\n94.16)\nSec.220\nof the Companies Act, lays down\nthat, \"After the balance sheet and profit and loss\naccounthave been laid before a company at an annual\ngeneral meeting as aforesaid, there shall be filed with the\nRegistrar within 30 days from the date on which the\nbalance sheet and the profit and loss account were so laid\nor where the annual general meeting of a company for any\nyear has not been held, there shall be filed with the\nRegistrar within 30 days from the latest day on or before\nwhich that meeting should have been held in accordance\nwith the provisions of this Act.\" It is not thecase of A-2 to\nA-4 that during their tenure as the sole Directors of the\nabove Companies, they had complied with any of these\nlegal requirements so as to claim that the transactions\nentered into by them were for and on behalf of the\nCompanies.\n\n94.17) That apart, there is nothing on record to\nshow that, A-2 to A-4 had convened any annual general\nmeeting of the Company at the relevant time when they\nwere at the helm of the Company nor is there any material\nto show that regular returns were filed before the\nRegistrar as required under law. That apart, the above\ncompanies did not have their own auditor appointed as per\n\nSec.224\nof the Act, instead, it has come in evidence that\nthe auditors of A-1 to A-4 themselves submitted the\nreturns after the properties of the companies were\nattached. All these circumstancesclearly go to show that\nthe except using the name of the company, the\nacquisitions were never intended to be the assets of the\nabove companies nor were they treated as the properties\nof the companies at any point of time. It is only after the\nattachment of the properties, the accused have come up\nwith the contention that the properties having been\nregistered in the name of the companies, the ownership\nthereof vests with the Company and therefore the\nproperties in question could not be said to be the benami\nproperties of A-1. But, as already discussed above, the\nfunds for the purchase of these properties are proved to\nhave been flown from the sources provided by A-1 and all\nthroughout, the properties were treated as private\nproperties of A-3 & A-4. It has come in evidence that, A-3\nand A-4 obtained loan for effecting improvements in these\nproperties and there is nothing on record to show that the\nloan liability has been taken over by the above Companies.\nThe certified copy of the orders in Misc. Ptn. 768/2014 dt.\n18.06.2014 and Misc. Ptn. 289/2014 dtd. 26.06.2014\npassed u/Sec. 5 (3) of the Criminal Law Amendment\nOrdinance, by this Court in exercise of the powers under\nthe said Ordinance, reveals that after the resignation of A-\n3 and A-4, there was no proper appointment of the\nDirectors and a finding has been recorded that, apparently\nfor the said reason, the order of attachment passed in\n1997 was not questioned before the District Judge for\nnearly two years. A finding has been returned in the above\norders that the consideration for purchase of the\nproperties did not represent the funds of the respective\ncompanies. In the light of these findings, the contentions\nraised by the accused that the properties in question\nabsolutely belong to the above Companies and therefore\ncould not have been tagged to the assets of A-l on the\nbasis of benami cannot be accepted.\n\n94.18) The argument of the learned counsel that the\nCompanies incorporated under the\nCompanies Act\ncannot\nhold the properties benami to another person is mis-\nconceived and cannot be accepted. No doubt, it is a basic\nor cardinal principle of law that, on incorporation, a\nCompany acquires legal status with perpetual succession\nand a common seal. Since the Company has no physical\nexistence, it must act through its agents and all such\ncontracts entered into by its agents must be under the\nseal of the Company. The common seal of the company is\nof great importance. It acts as the official signature of the\nCompany. A document not bearing the common seal of the\nCompany is not authentic and has no legal force behind it.\nBut unfortunately, in the instant case, hardly any\ndocument of title registered in the name of the above\nCompanies bear the seal of the Company. This is another\ncircumstance to show that the properties purchased in the\nname of the above Companies never assumed the\ncharacter of the assets of the Companies. Worse still, the\nabove Companies are not even represented by either the\nSecretary or Director and in 90% of the registered deeds\ndiscussed above there is not even the address of the\nCompanies written in the body of the deed. This is another\ncircumstance to show that, shoddy and murky deals had\ntaken place in the names of the Companies solely with a\nview to screen the properties acquired through illegal\nmeans.\n\n94.19) The above view gets further fortified from the\nfact that, the Registrar who registered these properties\nand PW.181 who negotiated for the purchase of the\nproperties bent the rules only to help the A-1. The\ncircumstances brought out in their evidence clearly\nindicate that, they went out of the way to register these\nproperties as instructed by A-1 solely to oblige A-1. I have\nalready referred to some of the documents wherein, even\nthe names of the purchasers were not included at the time\nof purchase and almost all the documents were under\nvalued. The Dist. Registrar has unequivocally stated that,\nhe proceeded with the registration solely because the\nproperties were purchased by A-1. Under the said\ncircumstance, it does not lie in the mouth of the accused\nnow to contend that since the properties were registered\nin the name of the Companies they are deemed to be the\nproperties of the Companies.\n\n94.20) The legal position is well settled ever since\nthe decision in the case of Solomon vs. Solomon that,\nCompany is a legal entity and is distinct from its members.\nIt bears its own name and a seal of its own. Its assets are\ndistinct from those of its members. This principle of\nseparate entity is regarded as curtain or veil which cannot\nbe generally pierced. But, when thisnotion of the Company\nor its Corporate identity is used to circumvent law, to\ndefeat public policy, perpetuate fraud or illegality and used\nas a cover or façade to justify wrong, defend crime, to\nlend a name to private dealing, law will not regard the\nCompany as a corporate entity and afford the protection\nwhich it otherwise entitled under the Company Law. When\ncamouflaged transactions are carried on behind the legal\nfaçade, Court may lift this veil and look behind the\nartificial personality of the Company and identify the real\npersonalities or natural persons operating behind the veil.\nThis is one of such case where overwhelming evidence is\navailable to show that the name of the Companies is used\nby the accused to make acquisitions by diverting the funds\nillegally amassed by A-1 during her tenure as Chief-\nMinister.\n\n94.21) The facts and circumstances proved in the\ncase undoubtedly establish that the accused have adopted\nan ingenious ploy or device in furtherance of their criminal\nconspiracy to shield the properties acquired through\ncommission of offence. The illegally amassed wealth\nrunning to nearly 3000 acres of land is sparked in these\nshell Companies, obviously for the reason that this\narrangement provides a convenient leeway to enjoy and\ndeal with the properties registered in the name of the\nCompanies and even dispose them of merely by passing a\nmere resolution. Therefore, the intention of the accused in\nbuying over the above Companies and taking full control\nover the management thereof and thereafter acquire large\nnumber of properties in the name of the Companies\nundoubtedly manifests the criminal motive and intention of\nthe accused attracting the ingredients of offence u/Sec.\n13(1) (e) of the Act, R/w.\nSec. 120-B\nof I.P.C.\n\n94.22) In the preceding part of this judgment, I\nhave already referred to the view held by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India on this point, wherein, it is clearly\nheld that the property in the name of an Income Tax\nassessee, by itself cannot be a ground to hold that it\nactually belongs to an assessee and that there is no\nembargo in getting the property registered in the name of\none person, although the real beneficiary is another. In\nview of the above factual and legal position, I hold that the\nproperties registered in the name of the above six\nCompanies and which are the subject matter of the G.O.\nMS. No. 1183 dt. 25.09.1997 and G.O. MS. No.120 dt.\n12.01.1997 issued by the State of Tamil Nadu is proved to\nbe the properties acquired and held by A-2 to A-4 for and\non behalf of A-1.\n\n94.24) But, it is now well settled, that private\nindividuals can also be prosecuted for conspiracy and\nabetment of offence of criminal misconduct along with the\npublic servant under the provisions of the\nP.C. Act\n. The\nposition of law in this regard is clarified by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the case of P.Nallammal vs.\nState, 1999 Crl.L.J. 3967. It is observedthat acquisition\nand possession by a public servant, is capable of being\nabetted. It is held in the above decision that, there is\nneither an express or implied exclusion in the 1988 Act to\ndeal with such a situation falling back on Sec. 109 of the\nPenal Code. The Legislature, while framing 1988 Act made\nno room for any doubt about the applicability of certain\nprovisions of Penal code for offences under the Act. The\nabsence of such a provision as found in the\nCorruption Act\n\nwill only lead to the conclusion that the Legislature did not\nwant to wipe out all the provisions of the Penal Code\nexcept Sec. 161 to 165-A which are found redrafted in the\n1988 Act. U/Sec. 3 of the 1988 Act, the Spl. Judge has\npower to try not only any offences punishable under this\nAct, but also any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to\ncommit or any abetment of any of the offences under the\nAct. The private individuals therefore can be prosecuted by\nthe Court on the ground that they have abetted the act of\ncriminal mis-conduct falling under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the\n1988 Act committed by the public servant.\n\n95. In the instant case, there is overwhelming\nevidence to show that at the relevant time, A-2 to A-4 did\nnot have any source of income commensurate with the\nvalue of the properties purchased in their name and all the\nassets and pecuniary resources described in Annx. II\nincluding properties registered in the name of the above\nsix companies were acquired out of the source provided by\nA-1. In this context, it may be pertinent to ascertain the\nantecedents of A-2 to A-4 and their financial status. As\nalready stated above, A-2 to A-4 are not related to A-1\neither by blood or through any other relationship. A-1 is a\nspinster. According to the prosecution, A-2 came to reside\nwith A-1 at Poes Garden in the year 1988, which fact has\nnot been disputed. PW.169 Sri. R. Krishna Murthy has\nstated about the occupation of the husband of A-2 stating\nthat, Tr. M. Natarajan joined the Government service as\nAssistant to the then Social Service Dept. Later, he was\nplaced as Information Public Relations Officer on\n30.11.1970 and continued in that post till 31.07.1976.\nLater in 1980 he was posted in the same post and\ncontinued there till 1988. In his service records, he\nappointed his wife Sasikala as nominee. He had received\nRs.3,000/- as scooter advance when he was PRO. Later to\nbuy a constructed house, he availed a loan of Rs.84,700/-\nin 1987. In the same year he availed a loan of Rs.80,000/-\nto purchase a motor car. On 1.11.1988, he submitted his\nresignation but it was accepted in the year 1991 w.e.f. the\ndate of his letter. In the cross-examination, it is elicited\nthat PW.169 did not produce any document either in proof\nof availment of loan or with regard to the resignation by\nthe husband of A-2. But it is not the case of A-2 that her\nhusband is even now continuing in Govt. service. Under\nthe said circumstance, there is no reason to disbelieve the\ntestimony of this witness that, her husband was in Govt.\nservice and he did not possess any substantial assets in\nhis name.\n\n95.3) No doubt it is true that, A-2 has produced\ncertain Income Tax returns and has also filed wealth tax\nreturns after she started residing with A-1 at Poes Garden\nclaiming to have earned income through business carried\non by her in partnership with A-1 under the name and\nstyle Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises. But all these\nproperties are taken into consideration by the prosecution\nin Annx. I.\n\n95.4) Coming to the financial status of A-3, PW.128\nBalakrishnan has stated that on the application submitted\nby A-3, a site was allotted to A-3 by the Tamil Nadu\nHousing Board and through this witness the allotment file\nis marked as Ex.P.720. Along with the said application A-3\nhas produced the income certificate issued by the\nTahsildar of Mambalam Guindy Taluk as per Ex.P.723\nwherein, it is certified that the income of A-3 as on\n28.07.1992 was Rs.44,400/- per annum. Added to that, he\nhas submitted a declaration as per Ex.P.722 stating that\nas on that date, he and his wife or minor dependent child\ndid not own any house or house site or flat and also not\nbeen allotted any other house to him. It is also the case of\nthe prosecution that, until 1992, A-3 was only a student\npursuing his studies and had no income whatsoever.\nThough A-3 has contended that he was possessed with\nsubstantial means and resources, A-3 has not produced\nany independent evidence in proof of his financial capacity\nto make large number of acquisitions in his name. The\nevidence produced by the accused suggest that, he had\nindependently started a Super Duper TV which was later\nconverted to Super Duper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., But I have\nalready recorded a finding regarding the income generated\nby A-3 from the said business. Thus, the evidence on\nrecord clearly points out that A-3 had no independent\nsource of income. Yet, large number of properties are seen\nto have been registered in his name. likewise, it is proved\nin evidence that A-4 had also no independent source of\nincome. It has come in evidence that, she came to reside\nat Poes Garden after the untimely demise of her husband\nwho was also in Govt. service and she received the death\nbenefits of the deceased which were the only funds\navailable at her disposal. She did not possess any\nimmovable properties in her name. On the other hand, it is\nproved in evidence that, she was also allotted a site by the\nTamil Nadu Housing Board as per Ex.P.719 and she had\nsubmitted a declaration to the effect that her annual\nincome was only Rs.48,000/- in 1992. Even during her\nexamination u/\nSec.313\nCr.P.C., she has not disputed this\nfact, which goes to show that even A-4 did not possess\nany wherewithals to make the huge acquisitions in her\nname, but for the patronage of A-1.\n\n95.5) It is proved in evidence that, during the check\nperiod, A-3 acquired the following properties either in his\nindividual name or in the name of the firmor Companies\nviz.,\n\nPROPERTIES STANDING IN THE NAME OF A-3\n\nANNEXURE - II\n\nDescription of property (including document Value of the\nSl.No. number property\n\nand in whose name it was\npurchased) (incl.\nof stamp\nduty\nand\nregistration\ncharges\n\n11 acres 83 cents in S.No.345/3B, 3A, 2, 5B, 2,33,770.00\n60 5F, 5D,\n5 5E 5C, 344/1 2, 402/4\nF, , , , 401/1, 335/1 n\nSiruthavoor\nVillage.\nTr.

On 15.10.94 a cheque\nissued for a sum of Rs.27,41,000/- in the name of IB\nMerchant Bank was deducted from this current account.\nThe cheque dated 4.10.94 which was signed by\nV.N.Sudhakaran is Ex.P.1582. on 18.10.94 a cheque for\nRs.9,00,000/- was issued in the name of Aiyya Durai and\nwas deducted from this current account. The cheque dated\n15.10.94 signed by V.N.Sudhakaran is Ex.P.1583. A\ncheque issued on 31.10.94 for a sum of Rs.6,00,000/- in\nthe name of Aiyya Durai was deducted. The cheque dated\n28.10.94 signed by V.N.Sudhakaran in Ex.P.1584.A\ncheque for Rs.24,05,000/- was issued on 26.11.94 to the\nbank to purchase a Demand Draft and the sum duly\ndeducted from this account. This cheque dated 26.11.94\nsigned by V.N.Sudhakaran in Ex.P.1585. The computer\nprintout showing the statement for the sum mentioned\nabove for the purchase of the demand draft is Ex.P.1586\nto Ex.P.1588. Three demand drafts for Rs.9,00,000/ -\nRs.9,00,000/- and Rs.6,05,000/-were issued in the name\nof Interface Capital Market Pvt. Ltd., A cheque for\nRs.2,55,000/- was issued on 9.12.94 in the name of Aiyya\nDurai and deducted. The cheque dated 5.12.94 signed by\nV.N.Sudhakaran is Ex.P.1589. A sum of Rs.75,000/- was\ndeducted on 7.4.95 in the name of V.N.Sudhakaran. On\n8.5.95 a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- was deducted in the name\nof Radha Venkatachalam. On 16.5.95 a sum of\nRs.5,00,000/- was deducted through a cheque in the name\nof Sasikala.\"\n\n95.8) The above evidence itself is sufficient to show\nthat all the above acquisitions were made out of the funds\ndiverted from the accounts of either A-1 or A-2 and A-3\nand A-4 did not invest any funds either for acquisition of\nthe immovable properties or for effecting improvements\ntherein.\n\n96) Another circumstance establishing conspiracy\nand abetment is the formation of large number of firms in\nthe names of A-2 to A-4. It is not in dispute that, initially\nA-1 and A-2 had commenced partnership business by\nconstituting two partnership firms by name Jaya\nPublications and Sasi Enterprises. As per PW.123 Jaya\nPublications was registered under the\nSales Tax Act\non\n29.09.1988 in the Sales Tax office and its main business\nwas printing. The object of the Company was offset\nprinting for partnership. The original partners were A-1, A-\n2 Divakaran and Dinakaran. The certificate of registration\nis marked as Ex.P.692. Ex.P.693 is the certificate issued\nby Central Sales Tax. This witness has categorically stated\nthat, Jaya Publications did not file returns up to 1998 as\nper the sales Tax Act.\n\n96.8) Thus, it could be seen that the business\nactivities in the name of A-2 to A-4 were started only\nduring the check period and it is established in evidence\nthat the said firms did not invest any funds of their own\nto run the business, instead, it is proved in evidence that,\nthese firms facilitated A-1 and A-2 to transfer huge\nunaccounted money through the bank accounts held in\nthe name of these firms.\n\n96.9) In this context, it is pertinent to note that, at\nthe commencement of the check period, there were\nhardly 10 to 12 bank accounts standing in the name of A-\n1 and A-2, but during the check period there was\nindiscriminate opening of accounts, so much so, the\nwitnesses have spoken about the opening of more than\n50 bank accounts apart from the loan accounts held by\nthe accused as here below:\nSl.

No. 1952 stands\nin the name of Namadhu MGR. According to P.W.1 this\naccount was transferred to their bank from Kelly's\nPurasawakam Branch on 23.10.1989. The account stood in\nthe name of 4 partners viz., A-1, A-2, Dinakaran and\nDivakaran. This witness has deposed about various\namounts credited to this account No. 1952 in the form of\ncash and has listed about 313 entries exceeding the\namount of Rs. 50,000/- credited to this account from time\nto time, which itself amounts to a total of Rs.\n7,41,05,155.50.\n\n98.1 In the instant case, the accused have failed to\noffer any satisfactory explanation as to the enormous\nunexplained credits entered into their bank accounts.\nWhatever explanation offered by the accused by way of\nconfirmatory letters are proved to be false and bogus. The\nidentity of the persons who provided the source is not\nproved. The transactions which resulted in the cash credit\nare also not established. As already discussed, the accused\nhave rested their defence solely on the balance sheet and\nthe profit and loss account statements said to have been\nfiled before the Income Tax Authorities. But, the said\ndocuments are not proved in accordance with law and they\nare not in compliance with the statutory requirements. The\nauditors examined by the accused are found to be propped\nup to support the false defence set up by the accused. It is\nproved in evidence that the auditors examined by the\naccused did not handle their accounts during the check\nperiod and they were not conversant with the true facts. It\nis also proved in evidence that, the returns and the\nbalance sheet and the profit and loss account were\nmaneuvered solely with a view to offer an explanation to\nthe huge unexplained credits entered in their respective\nbank accounts. As a result, the accused have failed to\nprove their defence even by the standard of\npreponderance of probability.\n\n98.2) Even otherwise, mere declaration of property\nin the Income Tax returns does not amount to showing the\nsame was acquired from the known source of income. The\nprosecution could show that, there was no real source of\nincome with the assessees and the public servant is the\nreal source. In the instant case, the prosecution has\nsucceeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the\nonly source for the acquisition of the large assets is A-1\nherself.\n\n98.3) It is proved in evidence that, all the\nremittances into the various bank accounts referred above\nwere made by one Ram Vijayan and Jayaraman, the staff\nof A-1 working in her house at Poes Garden at the relevant\npoint of time. PW.198 M. Jayaraman has categorically\nstated that, Mr. Vijayan used to deposit the money given\nto them in the names of the companies mentioned by A-2\nin Canara Bank, Mylapore branch and Indian Bank,\nAbirampuram branch. He has specifically stated that, Tmt.\nSasikala used to instruct him about the details of the bank\nto which the deposit should be credited and she used to\nsend the amount either in suit cases or bags through\ndomestic servants. This witness has further stated that,\nalong with the money, she used to send challan books and\nPW.198 used to fill the challans as directed by A-2. In the\ncourse of his chief-examination he identified the challans\nfor having remitted the amount which came to be marked\nas Ex.P.1123, P.1124, P.1139, P.1190, P.1299 and P.1304.\nHe has also identified the signature of Mr. Vijayan in those\nchallans and has stated that the said Vijayan is no more.\nThe bank officers examined by the prosecution viz.,\nPW.182 and PW.201 have identified large number of pay-\nin-slips marked as Ex.P.1035 - 1100 ; P.1122 - 1129 ;\nP.1299 - 1308 ; P.1636 - 1919 ; P.2032 - 2082 and have\nunequivocally stated that, most of these pay-in-slips bear\nthe name of Vijayan as the person remitting the amount.\nThis evidence undoubtedly establishes that even though\nlarge number of accounts were opened either in the names\nof accused or in the names of the firms or companies, yet,\nthe remittance into the said accounts used to be made\nonly by the staff of A-1 as per the instructions of A-2 who\nwas managing all the financial affairs of A-1.\n\n98.4) There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to\nshow that, during the check period, either the accused or\nthe firms run by them credited any amounts to the various\naccounts maintained by them. Except in case of Super\nDuper T.V. Pvt. Ltd., no other firm or the Company has\nproduced any documents to show that they transacted\nbusiness during the check period and the income thereof\nwas used to be credited to their bank account. On the\nother hand, the evidence produced before the Court points\nout that, all these firms had drawn the money which was\ntransferred to their account either from the account of\nNamadhu MGR or Jaya Publications. The details of the\ntransfers of such huge amount from Namadhu MGR and\nJaya Publications to the bank accounts of the accused and\nthe firms and the companies undoubtedly establish that all\nthe monies credited into the accounts of the accused were\nfrom the accounts maintained by A-1 and A-2. In this\nregard, it is relevant to note that, A-2 has taken up a\nspecific plea that, the large deposits collected from\nthe various subscribers of Namadhu MGR amounting to\nmore than Rs. 15 crores and the amount received by A-1\nby way of gifts was credited to the account of Namadhu\nMGR, Jaya Publications and the other accounts opened in\nthe name of the firms. But after thorough analysis of the\nevidence produced before the Court, I have recorded a\ndefinite finding that the plea set up by the accused is\ntotally false. Under the said circumstance, the inevitable\nconclusion that would follow is that, the various amounts\ncredited into the accounts of Namadhu MGR or Jaya\nPublications or the other accounts maintained by the\naccused is the unexplained wealth accumulated by A-1.\n\n98.5) It is not the case of A-2 that, during the check\nperiod, she had made any remittances to the above\naccounts out of her income. As already discussed above,\nneither A-2 nor A-3 or A-4 had any independent source of\nincome. Even though large number of firms had been\nconstituted during the check period, it is proved in\nevidence that none of these firms transacted any business\nand there was absolutely no income from any of these\nfirms. On the other hand, it is established that, all these\nfirms and companies had received funds diverted from the\nbank account of A-1 and out of these funds, A-2 to A-4\nacquired various properties described in Annx. II. As the\naccused have failed to prove even by preponderance of\nprobability that, they had any independent source of\nincome to acquire the assets found in their possession, it\ngoes without saying that all the acquisitions were made\nout of the source provided by A-1. As a result, I hold that\nthe prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that\nthe real source for acquisition of assets detailed in Annx. II\nis A-1 alone.\n\n98.6) The whole gamut of evidence discussed above\nestablish that the cash or pay orders or D.D.s are drawn\nfrom the different bank accounts for the purpose of\nacquisition of the assets. PW.201 and PW.182 have spoken\nin detail about the pay orders and the D.Ds issues by them\nat the instance of the accused. The cheques passed by the\nsaid banks or the D.Ds or pay orders issued by them\ndirectly co-relate to the details of the cheques or pay\norders mentioned in the various sale deeds, thereby\nestablishing the fact that the source for the purchase of\nthese properties had flown from the account maintained in\nthe name of the accused. But, as it is proved in evidence\nthat the credits made into these accounts were from the\nunexplained resources of A-1, it necessarily follows that\nthe funds for acquisition of all these assets are provided by\nA-1.\n\n98.7) In view of the above finding, I hold that all the\nassets and pecuniary resources found in possession of A-2\nto A-4 and in the name of various firms and the companies\nreferred above actually belong to A-1. As the prosecution\nhas proved beyond reasonable doubt that during the check\nperiod, A-1 was found in possession of assets and\npecuniary resources of the total value of\nRs.55,02,48,215.00 in her name and in the names of A-2\nto A-4 and in the names of the firms and companies\nacquired by them, I hold that the prosecution has proved\nthe ingredients of\nSec. 13 (1) (e)\nof the P.C. Act.\n\n99. In so far as the complicity of A-2 to A-4 in the\nalleged offence is concerned, there is overwhelming\nevidence indicating the circumstances of active abetment\nand conspiracy by the A-2 to A-4 in the commission of the\nabove offence u/Sec. 13 (1)(e) of the Act. Though it is\nargued by the learned counsel for the accused that, except\nthe fact that A-1 to A-4 were residing together under the\ncommon roof, there is no other evidence to show that they\nwere parties to the criminal conspiracy, yet, the\ncircumstances proved in evidence conclusively establish\nthat all the accused acted in a concert with each other with\nthe sole object to acquire and hold properties and assets\ndisproportionate to the known source of income of A-1. The\ncircumstances that have emanated from the evidence are\nas follows:\n\n(i) It is not in dispute that, A-1 had executed a\nGeneral Power of Attorney in favour of A-2 in respect of\nJaya Publications. The said G.P.A is marked as Ex.P.995.\nUndisputedly, A-1 was a partner of the said firm and there\nwas no necessity for her to execute any power of attorney\nin favour of A-2. The purpose behind executing the power\nof attorney in favour of A-2 appears to be to give her a\nfree hand in the management of the Jaya Publications and\non that guise, A-1 has taken up a defence that she was a\ndormant partner and was not aware of the transactions\ncarried on by A-2. But, by executing the G.P.A. in favour\nof A-2, A-1 has rendered herself liable for all acts and\ndeeds performed by A-2 pursuant to the powers conferred\nunder the G.P.A. As already stated above, it is proved in\nevidence that substantial funds accumulated by A-1 were\ncredited to the account of Jaya Publications and from the\nsaid account, it was diverted to the other accounts and\nultimately was utilized for the acquisition of huge assets.\nTherefore, it has to be presumed that A-1 was aware of\nthe transfer of these funds and the purpose for which\nthese funds were transferred to the other accounts. Even\notherwise, A-2 being the agent of A-1 was bound to keep\nA-1 posted with these facts. Therefore, it does not lie in\nthe mouth of A-1 to contend that being a dormant partner\nshe was unaware of the activities carried on by A-2. The\ncircumstance of executing the power of attorney in favour\nof A-2 indicates that with a view to keep herself secure\nfrom legal complications, A-1 executed the said power of\nattorney knowing fully well that under the said powers, A-\n2 would be dealing with her funds credited to her account\nin Jaya Publications.\n\n(ii) Constitution of various firms during the check\nperiod is another circumstance establishing the conspiracy\nbetween the parties. As already stated above, at the\nbeginning of the check period, A-1 and A-2 were involved\nin only two concerns by name Jaya Publications and Sasi\nEnterprises. But during the check period, as many as 18\nfirms have come into existence. But, it is proved in\nevidence that, none of these firms carried on any business\nduring the check period. There is absolutely no evidence to\nshow that any of the accused contributed any share capital\nor received profit from these firms. Receipt of share of the\nprofits is a prima-facie evidence of partnership. But in the\ninstant case, there is absolutely no evidence to show that\nduring the check period, any of the partners received any\nshare of the profits or contributed capital for the running\nof business. It has come in evidence that 10 firms were\nconstituted in a single day with the identical terms and\nconditions, even though none of the firms carried on\nbusiness in terms of the said deeds. In addition, A-2 and\nA-3 started independent concerns in their names during\nthis period. Not satisfied with this, even the defunct\ncompanies are bought by the accused. But, what has\ntranspired in the evidence is that except buying large\nnumber of properties, no other business iscarried on by\nany of these entities. It has also come in evidence that the\naccounts were opened during the check period and none of\nthese firms or companies had their own accounts or\nindependent resources. The circumstances proved in\nevidence undoubtedly establish that these firms are\nnothing but extentions of Namadhu MGR and Jaya\nPublications. They owed their existences to the\nbenevolence of A-1 and A-2 and drew continued\nsustenance from the funds transferred to their accounts.\nLarge amount of funds were diverted to these accounts\ngiving a clear indication that the firms were constituted\nonly with a view to siphon off the unlawful resources\naccumulated by A-1.\n\n(iii) Though A-1 has feigned ignorance about the\nactivities carried on by these firms, yet, it cannot be\nforgotten that the aforesaid firms and companies were\noperating from the residence of A-1. It is an admitted fact\nthat, A-2 to A-4 was residing at Poes Garden along with A-\n1. It cannot be believed that, being the Chief Minister of a\nState, she was unaware of the large scale activities carried\non by the persons living in her own house using her own\nresidential address. It has come in evidence that even the\nvoters' list of accused were maintained at the address of\nA-1. Though in her 313 statement she has feigned\nignorance of the dealings of A-2 to A-4, there is no\nexplanation by A-1 as to why and for what purpose A-2 to\nA-4 were living with her.\nAdmittedly, they are not related to her either by\nblood or by any other relationship. Though the factum of A-\n1 to A-4 residing together by itself may not lead to the\ninference that there was meeting of mind to pursue the\nobject of conspiracy, but the larger question that would\narise for consideration is, why did they reside under the\nsame roof with A-1 when they are not related to each\nother?\n\n(iv) The definite stand of A-2 to A-4 is that, they are\nnot dependent on A-1 for their living. Each one of the\naccused claims to have independent business and\nindependent source of living. They have even gone to the\nextent of asserting that their assets are purchased out of\ntheir own means and resources. Then, what made them to\nlive with A-1 when each of them have separate family has\nnot been explained. Admittedly, A-2 is married and has\nher own residence. A-1 has claimed that mementos and\nother gifts received by her are kept by her in the house of\nA-2 indicating that there was more than ordinary\nrelationship between A-1 and A-2. The very fact, A-2 to A-\n4 have engaged themselves in constituting firms and\nacquiring large tracts of land out of the funds provided by\nA-1 indicate that, all the accused congregated in the house\nof A-1 not for social living nor A-1 allowed them free\naccommodation out of humanitarian concern, rather the\nfacts and circumstances proved in evidence undoubtedly\npoint out that A-2 to A-4 were accommodated in the house\nof A-1 pursuant to the criminal conspiracy hatched by\nthem to hold the assets of A-1.\n\nv) It is vehemently argued that, A-1 has nothing to\ndo with the firms established by A-2 to A-4 and she has\nbeen falsely implicated in the alleged offence at the\ninstance of her political rivals. But, the very documents\nproduced by the accused at Ex.D.61 reveals that before\nthe Income Tax Authorities, the representative of A-1\nhimself had putforth an argument that Rs.1 crore was\nadvanced by A-1 to Sasi Enterprises towards share capital\nand further it was submitted that on the security of the\nsaid amount, loan was borrowed by A-1, which argument\nis seen to have been accepted by the Tribunal. Even\nbefore this Court, there is abundant evidence to show that\nA-1 has issued cheques in favour of other accused and has\nfiled applications for availing loan for the benefit of the\nfirms. Under the said circumstances, I do not find any\nsubstance in the argument canvassed by the learned\ncounsel that A-1 was totally ignorant about the dealings of\nthe firms and is no way involved in the formation of the\nsaid firms.\nvi) The flow of money from one account to the other\naccounts as detailed in the preceding paragraphs would\nestablish beyond reasonable doubt that all the accused\npersons have actively participated in the conspiracy to\nlaunder the illgotten wealth of A-1 for purchasing\nproperties in the names of the firms and the companies\nacquired by them. In this context, it is also pertinent to\nnote that even though the assets and properties of the six\ncompanies were attached by recourse to the provisions of\nthe Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, the applications\nfor vacating the attachment were filed more than two\nyears after the date of attachment, making it evident that\nother than the accused herein, no other person was\ninterested in the properties acquired by the accused in the\nname of the Companies.\n\nvii) Apart from the flow of money from one account\nto the other, the conspiracy among the accused persons is\nalso proved by the evidence of Sub-Registrar, North\nBeach, Sub-Registrar office-PW.159 and the evidence of\nPW.71 Radha Krishnan, Horticultural officer. I have\nelaborately culled out the evidence of these witnesses in\nthe earlier part of the judgment. Both the above witnesses\nhave unequivocally stated before the Court that, they were\ncalled to Poes Garden and on the instructions of the higher\nofficers they attended to the errands at the instance of the\naccused. It has come in evidence that the Sub-registrar\nhas bent the rules and has registered large number of\ndocuments by taking personal interest even though all\nthese properties were undervalued. It is also shocking to\nnote that, he even registered six documents without the\nnames of the purchasers being entered in the documents,\nwhich indicate that the Sub-Registrar was also aware of\nthe purpose and design of the accused. It can be\npresumed that, the District Registrar obliged to tour the\nentire district and register the properties at the residence\nof the purchasers, only to oblige A-1 and to assist her in\nthe acquisition of huge properties.\n\n100. Thus, the prosecution having proved beyond\nreasonable doubt the intention and object of A-2 to A-4 to\nacquire and hold the properties for and on behalf of A-1, I\nhold that A-2 to A-4 are liable for conviction for the\noffence u/Sec. 109 and 120-B of\nI.P.C\n. R/w.\nSec. 13\n(1) (e)\nR/w.\nSec. 13 (2)\nof P.C. Act.\n\nTo sum up, the prosecution has proved beyond\nreasonable doubt the following facts constituting the\noffences charged against the accused viz.,\n\nI. Total assets found in : Rs.55,02,48,215.00\npossession of A-1 as\non 30.04.1996\n\nII. Total expenditure incurred : Rs.8,49,06,833.00\nby the accused\nduring the check\nperiod\n\nIII. Total of (I) and (II) : Rs.63,51,55,048.00\n\nIV. Total income of accused : Rs.9,91,05,094.00\nfrom all sources as\ndetermined above\n\nV. Value of disproportionate assets and pecuniary resources\nfound in possession of accused as on 30.04.1996 which\nhas not been satisfactorily accounted.\n\nAccordingly, answering Point Nos.1 to 3 as above, I\nproceed to pass the following:\n\nORDER\n\nProsecution has proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt that as against the income of\nRs.9,91,05,094.75 and expenditure of\nRs.8,49,06,833.00 during the check period, A-1\nacquired and possessed in her name and in the names\nof A-2 to A-4 and in the names of the business\nenterprises acquired in their names immovable\nproperties and pecuniary resources of the value of\nRs.53,60,49,954.00 which she could not satisfactorily\naccount. Hence, acting u/Sec. 248 (2) of\nCr.P.C\n., A-1\nis hereby convicted for the offence punishable u/Sec.\n13 (1) (e) R/w.\nSec. 13 (2)\nof P.C. Act.\n\nProsecution has proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt that, A-1 to A-4 were parties to criminal\nconspiracy with the object of acquiring and possessing\npecuniary resources and assets to the extent of\nRs.53,60,49,954.00 beyond the known source of\nincome of A-1. Hence, A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 are\nhereby convicted for the offence punishable u/Sec.\n120-B of\nI.P.C\n. R/w.\nSec. 13 (1) (e)\nR/w.\nSec. 13 (2)\n\nof P.C. Act.\n\nProsecution has proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt that A-2 to A-4 abetted the commission of the\nabove offence by intentionally aiding A-1 in the\nacquisition and possession of pecuniary resources and\nproperties disproportionate to her known source of\nincome as above. Hence, A-2, A-3 and A-4 are hereby\nconvicted for the offence punishable u/\nSec.109\nof\nI.P.C. R/w.\nSec. 13 (1) (e)\nR/w.\nSec. 13 (2)\nof P.C.\nAct.\n\nSENTENCE\n\nFor the offence u/Sec. 13 (1) (e) R/w.\nSec. 13\n(2)\nof the P.C. Act, A-1 Selvi. J. Jayalalitha, D/o.

Learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the\n\nappellant in Crl.A.No.835/2014 argued as under:\n\nHe submitted that Annexure-I is the assets acquired\n\nbefore the check period. Annexure-II is the assets\n\nacquired at the end of the check period i.e. 30.4.1996.\n\nAnnexure-III is the income during check period.\n\nAnnexure-IV is the expenditure during check period.\n\nAnnexure-V is Annexure-II (Assets at the end of the check\n\nperiod, i.e. 30.4.1996) minus Annexure-I (Assets before\nthe check period). Annexure-VI is Annexure-IV\n\n(expenditure during check period) minus Annexure-III\n\n(income during check period). Annexure-VII is Annexure-\n\nV plus Annexure-VI.\n\nThe learned senior counsel further submits that the\n\norder of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was not fully complied\n\nwith. Leading questions were put during the course of re-\n\nexamination which is not permissible under the\nIndian\n\nEvidence Act\n. The judgment of the trial Court at\n\nparagraph-66 relating to item No.225 is based on the oral\n\nevidence of PW.198-Mr.Jayaraman. As against item\n\nNo.225 in Annexure-IV, Rs.16,15,500/- has to be\n\nexcluded. Accused No.1 was the Chief Minister from\n\n24.6.1991 to 12.5.1996. In the year 1996, All India Anna\n\nDMK Party was defeated. DMK came to power. On\n\n14.6.1996, Dr.Subramanian Swamy presented a private\n\ncomplaint before the Principal District and Sessions Judge,\n\nChennai. Based on that, Crl.M.P.No.3238/1996 was\n\nregistered. Learned Sessions Judge ordered for an enquiry\n\nunder\nSection 202\nof Cr.P.C. PW.240-Tmt.Letika Saran,\n\nthe then DIG of Police, was ordered to conduct an enquiry\n\nand report within two months. She has misunderstood the\norder of the Court and collected various documents namely\n\nIncome Tax Department Returns and documents from\n\nBanks. She recorded statements of 300 witnesses. These\n\nstatements cannot be treated as statements recorded\n\nunder\nSection 161\nof Cr.P.C. She did not file any report.\n\nPW.240 sought for extension of time. Time sought was\n\ngranted. The said order was challenged vide\n\nCrl.M.P.No.5755/1996 and the petition was dismissed on\n\n4.9.1996 vide Ex.D.10.\n\nHe further submitted that PW.241-V.C.Perumal took\n\nup investigation. The Government passed an order\n\ndirecting to register a crime. Accordingly, Crime\n\nNo.13/1996 was registered for the offences punishable\n\nunder\nSection 13(1)(e)\nread with\nSection 13(2)\nof the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act.\n\nSri L.Nageswar Rao, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant in Crl.A.No.835/2014\n\nargued as under:\n\nHe made submissions with regard to benami\n\ntransactions, i.e. any person on behalf the public servant.\n\nThe explanation under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the Prevention\nof\nCorruption Act\ndeals with known sources of income\n\nreceived from any lawful source and intimated in\n\naccordance with provisions of law, Rules or Orders. The\n\nfirst part of the explanation deals with initial burden of\n\nproof of prosecution. Then the public servant has to\n\nestablish his case by way of preponderance of probability.\n\nLawful source of income means income earned through a\n\nsource not forbidden in law. He also submitted in respect\n\nof\nSection 106\nof Indian Evidence Act, 1872, particularly\n\non the word 'especially'. He quoted that as per the\n\nWoolmington's case, everything has to be proved by the\n\nprosecution which may not be valid. Two essential pre-\n\nrequisites for benami transactions are source of income\n\nand intention. The prosecution has to prove these two\n\naspects. In other words, the person who asserts that\n\nthere is a benami transaction has to establish the same by\n\nadducing evidence. In this case, the prosecution has not\n\nadduced any evidence in respect of benami transactions.\n\nThe case cannot be decided on surmises and conjectures\n\nand it has to be decided based on evidence. 'Any person\n\non his behalf' mentioned in\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act refers to wife and unmarried\ndaughter.\nBenami Transaction (Prohibition) Act\ncame into\n\nforce from 19th May 1998.\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n\nwas promulgated on 9th September 1989. Prior to 1989,\n\nbenami transaction was not prohibited. There is no\n\nevidence to the effect that money has gone from A-1 to\n\nthe companies of A-2 to A-4.\n\nHe further submitted that the trial Court erred in\n\ngiving a finding that it cannot rely on the Income Tax\n\nrecords on the basis of the decision in Lalu Prasad Yadav's\n\ncase. Lalu Prasad Yadav's case does not lay down any law\n\nand only an observation is made during the course of\n\ngranting leave and on maintainability of the appeal\n\npreferred by the State of Bihar.\n\nHe further submitted with regard to the expert\n\nwitnesses and how the expert witnesses have to be dealt\n\nby the Courts. He invited the attention of the Court to\n\nSection 45\nof the Indian Evidence Act, i.e. Commentary on\n\nSarkar's Evidence. He invited the attention of the Court\n\nto depositions of PWs.98, 116, 220 and exhibits P.649 and\n\nP.671. He further submitted that the valuation of the\n\nproperty is not based on scientific data. The Engineers\nhave not actually verified with the sellers or shopkeepers\n\nabout the value of the marbles, granites and other items.\n\nThey valued some of the items on lumpsum basis. This is\n\nwithout any data. The price of marbles and granites\n\nwould have been ascertained for the check period, i.e.\n\n1991 to 1996, but this has not been done so.\n\nHe further submitted that in respect of item No.179\n\nsituated at Grape Garden Farm House, Jedimetla,\n\nHyderabad, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has valued\n\nthe property at Rs.1.50 crore, whereas the Engineers of\n\nPublic Works Department, Government of AndhraPradesh,\n\nhave valued the same at Rs.6,40,33,901/-. In respect of\n\nitem No.181 situated at Door No.36, Poes Garden,\n\nChennai, including new construction made at No.36-A, the\n\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal has valued the property at\n\nRs.2,11,85,400/-, whereas the Engineers of the Public\n\nWorks Department, Government of TamilNadu, have\n\nvalued the property at Rs.7,24,98,000/-. He further\n\nsubmitted that scrutiny report is prepared by the\n\nAssessment Officer in respect of marbles and granites and\n\nthe Assessing Officer visited Bombay to collect the value of\n\nthe marbles and granites and other similar items.\nHe further submitted that in TamilNadu, there is a\n\ncustom to give gifts to political leaders by way of cash,\n\ngold, silver articles, etc. Gold is assessed at 21,280\n\ngrams. These items were indicated in Wealth Tax and\n\nIncome Tax returns. Wealth Tax was paid. Gifts are\n\nlawful sources. There is no prohibition to receive gifts by\n\nway of gold or silver articles. Some of the gold and silver\n\nitems were acquisitions were made prior to check period.\n\nThis has been indicated in the check period. This is highly\n\nimproper. Gift is permitted under the law. Acquisition of\n\nproperty is very significant in so far as check period is\n\nconcerned. Check period will be decided by the\n\nInvestigating Agency. He further submits that Fire Engine\n\nWater was used in order to push any gold articles hidden\n\nin the water tubes, but in vain.\n\nSection 114(d)\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872,\n\ndeals with presumption. Earlier investigation conducted by\n\nthe Investigation Agency in Crime No.13/1996 registered\n\non 18.9.1996 has to be taken into consideration. Crime\n\nNo.14/1996 is the present crime number. Annexure-I\n\nneed not be explained because it is prior to check period.\n\nAnnexure-II is the property mentioned during the checked\nperiod. This has to be satisfactorily explained by A-1.\n\nAnnexure-III relates to income during check period.\n\nSection 69\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961, deals with\n\nunexplained income.\nSection 122\nof the Transfer of\n\nProperty Act deals with Gifts. Gold and silver articles\n\nacquired prior to check period has been mixed up to the\n\narticles acquired during the check period.\n\nHe further submitted that items of income is not\n\nincluded in Annexure-III. According to the prosecution,\n\nincome from Grape Garden, Hyderabad is only Rs.5 lakh\n\nduring check period, i.e. for 5 years, whereas according to\n\nA-1, it is Rs.52 lakh based on the income tax returns and\n\ninspection carried out by the Income Tax Authorities. Gifts\n\nwere received in 1992. In 1991, A-1 became the Chief\n\nMinister. Gifts and cash were received to the tune of\n\nRs.2.15 crore. Certain drafts were received from foreign\n\ncountries, to the tune of Rs.77 lakh. This was shown in\n\nthe income tax returns for the year 1992-93. The order\n\npassed by the Assessing Authority was subject matter of\n\nappeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax which is at\n\nEx.P.2145. The Commissioner of Income Tax suggested\n\nthat they have taken it as professional tax because politics\nis also a profession. The Commissioner of Income Tax who\n\npassed this order was examined as PW.15. The gifts in the\n\nform of gold jewellery were received prior to 1.7.1991, i.e.\n\nprior to check period. This is not the subject matter of this\n\ncase. He further submits that he relies on the Appellate\n\nCourt Order, i.e. Ex.P.2145.\n\nHe further submits that 'Namadhu MGR' started in\n\nthe year 1989. It is a scheme. It is legally accepted by\n\nthe Authorities. DMK was formed in the year 1967. All\n\nIndia Anna DMK was formed in the year 1972 by M.G.R.\n\nHe relies on Exs.D.217 and D.231, assessment for the year\n\n1991-92.\n\nHe further submits that PW.181 was appointed by\n\nthe prosecution to ascertain the valuation of marriage\n\narrangements made at the choultry. He gave him the\n\ndrawing, choultry measurements and the pandal. He also\n\ngave details of expenses of marriage arrangements.\n\nDW.1-Ramkumar is the son of Sri.Shivaji Ganeshan. The\n\nparty-workers also contributed for the marriage. The bride\n\nwas the grand daughter of Sri.Shivaji Ganeshan. Notice\n\nwas issued to A-1 alleging that she has spent Rs.91 lakh.\nExplanation was submitted by A-1. It was not accepted by\n\nthe Assessing Authority. The Appellate Authority accepted\n\nthe explanation. Evidence of PW.181 is hearsay. The\n\nexpenditure of the marriage is highly inflated. The value\n\nof Tent or pandals were assessed at Rs.5,21,00,000/-.\n\nLawful source means not prohibited by law. Benami\n\ntransaction was a permitted activity prior to 1988. No\n\nmoney has gone from A-1. The prosecution cannot infer\n\nthat money was spent by A-1. Transfer of money should\n\nbe established. The prosecution mixed up the properties\n\nof A-1 to A-4. This is an error committed by the\n\nprosecution.\nIncome Tax Act\nis a fiscal statute.\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nis a penal statute.\n\nAssessment order of the Income Tax proceedings was to\n\nbe given weightage in the absence of overwhelming\n\nevidence of the prosecution. Income tax proceedings are\n\nrelevant. The trial Court ignored on the principle of\n\nminimal evidentiary value and relied on the ruling of the\n\nPatna High Court which was subsequently overruled.\n\nNon-schedule items are marbles and granites.\nSection 106\n\nof the Indian Evidence Act was pressed into service by the\n\ntrial Court. Though there was a scrutiny, assessment,\nenquiry, verifiable data, expertise, these aspects have not\n\nbeen considered by the trial Court. Gold jewellery were\n\ndisclosed in Wealth Tax, Income Tax returns prior to check\n\nperiod. Fixed deposit receipts prior to check period should\n\nhave been excluded.\n\nHe submitted that income from Jaya Publications\n\ndeals with printing. 'Namadhu MGR' deals with Newspaper.\n\nDetailed enquiry was done by the Income Tax Authorities.\n\nThe basis for connecting A-1 with A-2 to A-4 and\n\n'Namadhu MGR' is illegal. With regard to marriage\n\nexpenses, legal evidence is not looked into. The order\n\nwhich is set-aside by the Assessing Officer is taken into\n\naccount. The case of A-1 was proved higher than the\n\npreponderance of probability. The trial Court erred in\n\ngiving a finding that money has flown from A-1 to A-2 and\n\nA-2 to A-4 and companies. On assumption and surmises,\n\nthe trial Court has come to a conclusion that money has\n\nparted from A-1 to A-2 and A-2 to A-4. According to the\n\nprosecution, A-3 and A-4 became Directors with effect\n\nfrom 17.8.1994. A-2 to A-4 resigned from directorship\n\nbetween 5.3.1996 to 12.3.1996. The company acquired\n\nsix properties between 26.5.1993 to 30.4.1996. After\naccused Nos.3 and 4 became Additional Directors, no\n\nproperties were acquired. Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd.is a\n\npubliclimited company existing since 1986. According to\n\nthe case of the prosecution, this Company has constructed\n\ntwo servant quarters and a compound wall. Ex.P.822 is\n\nthe estimation report and cost of construction.\n\nNearly 65 rulings were cited by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel Sri. L. Nageswara Rao and\n\nSri. B.

She\n\nwas carrying on business viz., Vinod Video Vision prior to\n\ncoming in contract with accused No.1. He submits that\n\nwhat is not prohibited is lawful as per explanation to\n\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act. The\n\nInvestigating Officer have put properties of accused Nos.1,\n\n2, 3, 4, firms and companies in one basket and assessed\n\nthe value of assets of the accused and entities to the\nextent of Rs.64,42,89,616/-. He also made submission\n\nwith regard\nSection 106\nof the Indian Evidence Act. He\n\nsubmits that initial burden is on the prosecution to prove\n\nits case and after the prosecution discharged the initial\n\nburden, the burden shifts on the defence. In case if the\n\ninvestigation agency is unable to investigate in respect of\n\nthe income of the accused, then\nSection 106\nof the Indian\n\nEvidence Act has to be pressed into service. He also\n\nsubmitted according to the DVAC manual, the\n\nInvestigation Officer was authorized to collect proceedings\n\nfrom the Income Tax Department. He also submits that\n\ntrial is not fair and charges are vague. No funds have\n\nbeen transferred from the account of A-1 to A-2. Accused\n\nNo.2 is a Wealth Tax Assessee in the year 1987-88. She\n\nwas Income Tax assessee way back in the year 1993.\n\nAccused No.2 was having sufficient income.

The prosecution has to\n\nstand on its own legs and not on the weakness of the\ndefence. There is no direct evidence in respect of accused\n\nNos.3 and 4. There is no evidence with regard to the\n\nsource of income which has been parted from accused\n\nNo.1 into the accounts of accused Nos.3 and 4. He has\n\ncited the following rulings:\n\n1. P.

Nos.\n\n17/2015, 19/2015 and 20/2015 submits that no notice has\n\nbeen issued to the appellants. Without issuing the notice,\n\npassing an order of confiscation is bad in law. He further\nsubmits that Ramraj Agro Mills Pvt. Ltd. is a public limited\n\ncompany. The other companies are private limited\n\ncompanies. They are not individuals. Therefore, without\n\nissuing notice to the Managing Director or to the Company\n\nSecretary, passing an order of confiscation is not proper.\n\nTherefore, he seeks to set-aside the impugned order of\n\nattachment and confiscation. He has cited the following\n\nrulings:\n\n1. STATE BANK OF INDIA V/S. RAJENDRA\nKUMAR SINGH AND OTHERS reported in AIR\n1969 SUPREME COURT 401;\n\n2. MRS. BACHA F.

No. 18/2015\n\nsubmits that without issuing notice to the concerned party,\npassing an order of confiscation and attachment is bad in\n\nlaw.\n\nSri.Aditya Sondhi, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the appellants in Crl.A. Nos.\n\n21/2015 and 22/2015 submits that the notice prior to an\n\norder under\nSection 452\nof Cr.P.C. is must. He further\n\nsubmits that even where the accused has participated in\n\nthe Trial, separate notice and inquiry must be carried out\n\nprior to passing an order under\nSection 452\nof Cr.P.C. He\n\nfurther submits that the learned Trial Judge has failed to\n\nappreciate that the appellant is a separate legal entity that\n\nis distinct from its Directors viz., accused Nos.3 and 4.\n\nThe impugned order is vitiated as the appellant, being a\n\nseparate legal entity having a distinct character ought to\n\nhave been necessarily arraignedas an accused. The\n\nlearned Trial Judge has failed to consider the documents\n\npertaining to the appellant hadnot discussed with respect\n\nto the appellant in the impugned order. The appellant was\n\nsubjected to the proceedings under\nSection 148\nof the\n\nIncome Tax Act, 1961, for income escaping assessment.\n\nHe further submits that after due enquiry, the\n\nIncome Tax Authority recorded the statement of individual\nshareholders of the appellant, who have contributed to its\n\nshare capital and dropped the proceedings and it became\n\nfinal. The Department of Revenue has not preferred any\n\nrevision. In such circumstances, it is clear that the\n\nproperty is duly that of the appellant and there is no\n\nconsideration towards purchase of property that has\n\nflowed from accused Nos.3 and 4 much less, accused No.1,\n\nwho is a public servant. The initial burden lies on the\n\nprosecution. This burden has to be strictly discharged by\n\nadducing legal evidence of a definite character. It is not\n\nenough merely to show circumstance that may show\n\nsuspicion as the Court cannot decide on the basis of\n\nsuspicion but must act on the acceptable evidence. The\n\nprosecution must discharge this burden beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt. The prosecution has failed to show that any\n\nconsideration has move from A-1 towards acquisition of\n\nproperty in question. He further submits that the share\n\ncapacity of the appellant is Rs.1.32 Crores subscribed by\n\nindependent shareholders. He draws the attention of this\n\nCourt to Ex.D193 (Volume IX, Page 171). The said share\n\ncapital is more than sufficient to acquire the assets, which\n\nare valued at around Rs.18 Lakhs. Further, the appellant\nhas its own bank account. Attention of this Court was\n\ndrawn to Ex.P1294 (Volume IX, Page 104). The sale deed\n\nthrough which the properties purchased are duly\n\nregistered. The mode of payment was through the\n\nDemand Drafts. The vendors of the sale deeds have also\n\ndeposed in this regard.\n\nHe has cited the following rulings:\n\n1. STATE BANK OF INDIA V/S.

COMPETENT\nAUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE &\nOPPOSITE PARTIES in OJC NO.6466/2013\nLearned Special Public Prosecutor, Sri. B.V.\n\nAcharya has filed the written arguments on behalf of\n\nthe State of Karnataka as under:\n\nThe appeals filed by the appellants are not\n\nmaintainable in law. According to the law settled by the\n\nSupreme Court, the sole prosecuting agency is the State of\n\nKarnataka and in the appeals, the Public Prosecutor validly\n\nappointed by the State of Karnataka has to be heard. In all\n\nthe above appeals, very significantly, the State of\n\nKarnataka which is the sole prosecuting agency has not\n\nbeen made a party. Omission to implead the State of\n\nKarnataka as a party is a fatal defect and as the defect has\n\nnot been cured even subsequently, aforesaid appeals are\n\nliable to be dismissed in limine as not maintainable. Order\n\nof conviction cannot be set-aside as claimed by the\n\nappellants unless the sole prosecuting agency viz., State of\n\nKarnataka is made a party. The prosecution has fixed the\n\ncheck period as 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996. There is charge of\n\nconspiracy against all the four accused punishable under\n\nSection 120-B\nof IPC. There is also an alternate charge\n\nthat accused Nos.2 to 4 have abetted the commission of\n\nthe offence by the 1st accused under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n, read with\nSection 13(2)\nof\n\nthe Act. It is the prosecution case that A1 is a public\n\nservant and has abused the position as Chief Minister of\n\nthe State and has amassed wealth disproportionate to her\n\nknown source of income. It is the case that all the four\n\naccused have conspired for committing these offences and\n\nAccused Nos.2, 3 and 4 have actively assisted A1 in\n\nachieving this object. In the present case, it is the case of\n\nthe prosecution that all the assets have been acquired by\n\naccused No.1 in her name or in the name of other accused\n\nor in the name of as many as 32 business enterprises of\n\nwhich one or the other accused have been acquired in the\n\nname of these companies is established by documentary\n\nevidence on record and the same is beyond dispute. In\n\nthis connection, reference is drawn to the evidence of\n\nPW71- Radhakrishnan, Officer of the Horticulture\n\nDepartment who speaks about the circumstances under\n\nwhich various items of agricultural lands were purchased.\n\nReference is also drawn to the evidence of PW94-\n\nLakshminarayana who speaks about the registration of\n\nvarious firm/companies. So also PW159-Rajagopalan\n\nspeaks about registration of documents at the residence of\nA1 at Chennai. It is the contention of the accused that the\n\nprosecution has failed to prove that all these assets have\n\nbeen acquired from out of the funds of accused No.1. It is\n\nno doubt true that the prosecution has to establish that\n\nthe properties have been acquired from out of the ill-\n\ngotten wealth of accused No.1. According to the\n\nprosecution this part of the case has been very\n\nsatisfactorily established by the prosecution by leading\n\nclinching circumstantial evidence. It is not prudent to\n\nexpect direct evidence on this aspect. The same has to be\n\nonly by way of circumstantial evidence. A case of the\n\nconspiracy is generally proved only be leading\n\ncircumstantial evidence and the Court will have to draw\n\nproper inferences from the circumstances which are\n\nestablished in the case. In the present case, such evidence\n\nproving various circumstances from which the required\n\ninference can be drawn has been proved. It is settled law\n\nthat the court will have to consider the cumulative effect of\n\nall the circumstances so proved and not merely refer to\n\ncertain circumstances here and there and say that the case\n\nhas not been proved. It is established that accused Nos.1\n\nto 4 were residing together in No.36, Poes Garden, which\nis the official residence of accused No.1 That they were\n\nresiding together, coupled with other circumstances show\n\nthat they have acted in concert. Admittedly, A1 and A2 are\n\npartners in Jaya Publication and Sasi Enterprises. In fact, it\n\nis in evidence that most of the registered Sale Deeds have\n\nbeen actually registered at the residence of accused No.1\n\nby the Registrar who has come to her house for the said\n\npurpose. These are some of the significant features of this\n\ncase. It is also in evidence that neither A2, A3, A4 had any\n\nindependent source of income to acquire such valuable\n\nproperties. The status and income of accused No.1 has\n\nbeen discussed by the Trial Judge in para-95 of the\n\njudgment. Similarly, A3 and A4 also did not have\n\nindependent income earlier to the check period. It is in\n\nevidence that A3 is none other than foster son of A1 and\n\nhe is also a close relative of A2. The relationship between\n\nA2 and A4 is also admitted. The trial Judge on an elaborate\n\ndiscussion of the evidence on record has rightly come to\n\nthe conclusion that none of these accused had any\n\nindependent source of income to purchase the valuable\n\nassets which admittedly have been purchased in the\n\nnames of various companies of which, either A2 or A3 or\nA4 were partners or Directors. Some of the companies\n\nwhich were not doing any business or profit have been\n\nacquired by A2, A3 and A4 only for the purpose of\n\nacquiring properties, source of which is from Accused No.1.\n\nThus, it has to be noted that the Trial Judge has relied on\n\nonly such circumstances which are very satisfactorily\n\nestablished by the documentary evidence only. The trial\n\nCourt in its judgment at para-97 has pointed out that how\n\nhuge unexplained cash amounts were credited into the\n\nvarious accounts standing in the name of accused or the\n\ncompanies owned by them. He has also pointed out how\n\nthe accused have failed to explain these credits. The trial\n\nCourt has also pointed out that how though there were\n\ndifferent accounts in different Banks in the name of\n\ndifferent companies, the accused were treating all these\n\naccounts as one by transfer of funds from one account to\n\nother without any reason. The trial Court on appreciation\n\nof the entire evidence on record, it will be seen that during\n\nthe check period, accused No.1 was found to be in\n\npossession of assets and pecuniary resource of not less\n\nthan Rs.55 crores though the said assets have been\n\nstanding in the names of A1 to A4 or the various\nCompanies owned by them. It is contended that in view of\n\nthe provisions of\nBenami Transactions (Prohibition) Act\n\n1988, (hereinafter referred to as\nBenami Act\n) are not\n\nattracted to the facts of the present case. The Legislature\n\nrealizing that offence of acquiring disproportionate assets\n\nis generally resorted to by acquiring property in the name\n\nof any other person has deliberately used the expression\n\n\"he or any person on his behalf is in possession\". If in a\n\ngiven case, it is shown that the consideration for acquiring\n\nthe property as flown from the public servant concerned,\n\nhe is guilty of the offence even though the property may\n\nstand in the name of any other person or company. In the\n\ninstant case, the circumstances clearly establish that it is\n\nin effect, accused No.1 who has been in possession of the\n\nproperty or pecuniary resource though the same may be\n\nstanding in the name of different person or companies.\n\nHence, the arguments based on\nBenami Act\nis liable to be\n\nrejected. The accused Nos.1 and 2 in an attempt to\n\ndisprove the case of the prosecution have tried to establish\n\nthat during the check period, Jaya Publications of which\n\nthey are the partners, they have received interest free\n\ndeposit to the extent of 13 crores and odd from thousands\nof subscribers on promise of supply of free copies of the\n\nmagazine. According to the prosecution, this whole claim is\n\nfalse and in an attempt to substantiate this claim, accused\n\nNo.1 and 2 have not only put forward a false case, but\n\nhave also fabricated evidence. According to the accused,\n\nthe scheme was formulated in 1990 and that substantial\n\nsum was to the extent of over 13 Crores were collected for\n\nthe assessment year 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95. It is\n\nvery significant to note that during this period, neither\n\naccused Nos.1 and 2 in their individual capacity nor the\n\nfirm Jaya Publications filed any income tax returns. The\n\nreturns showing receipt of this interest free deposit are\n\nfiled before the Income Tax authorities only after the\n\nregistration of the present case and filing of the charge\n\nsheet. In fact, the returns for assessment year 1992-93\n\nwas filed on 6.11.1998 and for 1994-95 were filed on\n\n17.03.1998. Evidently, the accused have thought of\n\nputting forward this theory of deposit claim after the\n\nregistration of the present case. It is seen that in doing so,\n\nthe accused were trying to get the assistance of the\n\nauthorities of the Income Tax by filing belated returns.\n\nHowever, when the Income Tax Authorities sought the\noriginal subscription forms on behalf of the accused, it was\n\nsubmitted that those forms, counterfoils etc., which are\n\nkept in a cardboard box in a Tata Sumo vehicle parked in a\n\nhotel and the same are missing. It was also claimed that a\n\ncomplaint in this behalf had been given to the Police, but\n\nno document is produced to prove this fact. It is\n\ninteresting to note that though these documents are\n\nclaimed to have been lost during the trial, the accused\n\nsurprisingly summoned these very documents from the\n\nIncome Tax Authorities and that were produced before the\n\nCourt. The learned trial Judge on a detailed examination of\n\nthe evidence with regard to these documents has come to\n\nthe conclusion that they all appeared to have been\n\nfabricated. The circumstances establish beyond doubt that\n\nthe theory of receipt of interest free deposit over 13 crores\n\nis only an afterthought invented for the purpose of this\n\ncase. The trial Court in para- 50 of the judgment has\n\ndiscussed the evidence on this aspect and has categorically\n\ncome to the conclusion that not only the evidence\n\ntendered in this behalf is false, but several documents\n\nhave been fabricated. DW.88-Auditor who is a star witness\n\nhas clearly contradicted himself on several aspects as\npointed out by the Trial Court. This conclusion arrived at\n\nby the learned judge is fully justified on the material on\n\nrecord and to avoid repetition, it is prayed that this Court\n\nmay be pleased to peruse the discussion at para-50.1 till\n\npara 50.23. The result of the discussion is not only to show\n\nthat the so called explanation offered by the accused is\n\nfalse, but also that the accused have fabricated the\n\nevidence in support of their case. It is submitted that to\n\nthe extent of 13 Crores and odd even on the admission of\n\nthe accused, there is disproportionate asset if the\n\nexplanation by way of receipt of interest free deposit is\n\nfound to be not true. In the circumstances, adverse\n\ninference will have to be drawn against the accused and\n\nthe consequent result is at least to the extent of Rs.13\n\nCrores and odd, the case of the prosecution regarding\n\npossession of the disproportionate asset or pecuniary\n\nresources finds full corroboration. If on this aspect of the\n\nmatter, the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court is\n\ncorrect, to the extent of Rs.13 Crores, the Prosecution\n\nevidences gets corroborates from the version of the\n\naccused themselves. The expenditure incurred by the\n\naccused during the check period was a sum of\nRs.12,00,59,338.76/-. To substantiate the case of the\n\nprosecution, 42 witnesses were examined in this regard.\n\nThe evidence of these witnesses is cogent and consistent\n\nand the accused have not been able to elicit much in the\n\ncross-examination. One such item of expenditure included\n\na sum of Rs.6,47,04,222/- which were expenses incurred\n\nby accused No.1 for the purpose of the marriage of her\n\nfoster son accused No.3. The special Judge after giving due\n\nconsideration to the evidence on record has given valid\n\nreasons justifying the reduction of this expenses to about\n\nRs.3 Crores and also taking into consideration various\n\nother expenses incurred has arrived at the final value of\n\nexpenditure of Rs.8,49,06,833/-. This amount arrived at is\n\non the basis of the entire evidence being appropriately\n\nscrutinized and no other conclusion can be arrived at on\n\nthe basis of the material on record. The case of the\n\nprosecution was that there were 306 items of assets\n\nacquired by the accused. These items were substantiated\n\nthrough documents and also through various witnesses\n\nexamined in this behalf. As against the said 306 items, the\n\nSpecial Judge has scrutinized each item in detail and has\n\ngiven a finding that the value of the assets acquired during\nthe check period was Rs.55,02,48,215/-. This value arrived\n\nat is after giving deduction to various items which\n\naccording to the special Judge, the prosecution had not\n\nbeen able to fully establish. The values arrived at was on\n\nthe basis of the evidence of valuers who were examined as\n\nprosecution witnesses and on the basis of the documents\n\nin support of the acquisition of these assets. The trial\n\nCourt in para 87.9 has in a tabular form extracted the\n\nnature of the assets and its corresponding value which the\n\nprosecution has been able to prove through cogent and\n\nconsistent evidence. It is the case of the prosecution that\n\nduring the check period, the 1st accused with the\n\nassistance of other accused has acquired and come into\n\npossession of various assets both movable and immovable.\n\nIt is significant to note that acquisition of these properties\n\ncannot be disputed as they are all covered by registered\n\ndocuments. Even if the evidence regarding payment of\n\ncash over and above the price shown in the Sale Deeds are\n\nexcluded, over more than Rs.20 Crores have been paid\n\ntowards the price of these properties and regarding this\n\nacquisition, there cannot be any dispute at all. That these\n\nproperties have been acquired in the names of various\ncompanies in which the accused are interested either as\n\nPartners or Directors is also beyond doubt. The prosecution\n\nhas established that none of the accused had any\n\nindependent means to pay and purchase these properties\n\nby paying valuable consideration. In the circumstances,\n\nthe conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court that the\n\naccused have acquired these immovable properties is\n\nbeyond any challenge. Item No.3 in para 87.9 shows the\n\nnew or additional construction of buildings and the total\n\nvalue of which exceeds Rs.22 Crores. The gold and\n\ndiamond jewellery found is also more than Rs.2.5 Crores.\n\nThe Shares and Fixed Deposit which are beyond dispute\n\nare also to the extent of Rs.3 Crores and 42 Lakhs and\n\nodd. The value of the vehicles as found in column 8 is also\n\nto the extent of Rs.1,29,00,000/-. Thus, in paragraph\n\n87.9, the trial Court has rightly concluded that the\n\nprosecution has proved beyond doubt the acquisition of\n\ndisproportionate assets to the extent of Rs.55 Crores. The\n\nfinding recorded by the Trial Court does not suffer from\n\nany infirmity and there are no grounds made out for\n\ninterference by this Court.\nDr. Subramanian Swamy, the original\n\ncomplainant, has filed his written arguments as\n\nunder:\n\nA-1 was the Chief Minister of Tamilnadu from\n\n24.6.1991 till 30.9.1996. She along with A-2 to A-3\n\namassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of\n\nincome. Earlier to this, she was a member of Rajya Sabha\n\nfrom April 1984 till 27.1.1989 till 30.1.1991. She was a\n\npublic servant within the meaning of\nSection 2(b)\nof the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Crime\n\nNo.13/AC/96/HQ was registered for the offences\n\npunishable under\nSections 13(2)\nand\n13(1)(e)\nof the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act against A-1 and others.\n\nA-1 was the daughter of late Smt. N.R.Sandhya, who\n\nwas acting in Films during 1960s. A-1 was acting in Films\n\nduring 1964-1972. Smt. N.R.Sandhya died in the year\n\n1971. As per the Will dated 1.11.1971, she bequeathed\n\nher shares in the properties belonging to Natyakala\n\nNikethan to A-1. At the time of her mother's death, A-1\n\nwas owning the following properties.\n\na) Land and building at No.36, Poes Garden,\nChennai-600086.\nb) House at Plot No.36, Door No.8/3/1099,\nSrinagar Officers' Colony, Hyderabad City.\n\nc) Lands totally measuring 10.20 acres in\nSurvey No.52 and Sy.No.50 of Jeedi Metla\nVillage and Sy.No.93/1 of Pet Basheerabad\nVillage, Metchal Taluk, Ranga Reddy\nDistrict, Andhra Pradesh with Grape Garden,\nFarm House and servants' quarters\npurchased in 1968 valued at Rs.1,65,058/-\nplus Rs.13,254.50.\n\nThe above three items were bequeathed to A-1\nby her mother through Will dated 1.11.1971.\n\nd) Land in Sy.No.93/2 to the extent of 3.15\nacres in Pet Basheerabad Village, Andhra\nPradesh.\n\nUp to 1987, A-1 was in possession of properties\n\nworth about 7.5 lakhs, i.e. item Nos.(a) to (d) mentioned\n\nabove, agricultural lands measuring 3.43 acres in Cheyyur\n\nTaluk, an old Ambassador and an old Contessa Car, a new\n\nMaruti Car and company shares, bank balance to the\n\nextent of Rs.1 lakh, besides jewels.\n\nHe further states that A-1 had floated business\n\nFirms, viz. M/s. Jaya Publications, Namadu MGR and\n\nM/s.Sasi Enterprises in the between 1988 to 1990 with A-2\n\nand others as partners of these Firms. These Firms did not\n\ngenerate any income. From 13.5.1988 to 27.1.1989, she\n\nwas a member of Parliament. A-1 has purchased four\nmotor cars worth Rs.9,12,129/- and on 13.2.1989, she\n\npurchased a Jeep worth Rs.1,04,000/-. Check Period is\n\nfrom 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996. As on 1.7.1991, A-1 was\n\nfound to be in possession of properties and pecuniary\n\nresources in her name and in the name of A-2, who was\n\nliving with her, to the extent of Rs.2,01,83,957/-. These\n\ninclude the properties acquired in the name of M/s.Jaya\n\nPublications, M/s.Sasi Enterprises and Namadu MGR. After\n\n1.7.1991, the acquired assets by A-1 has gathered\n\nmomentum and during this period, A-3 and A-4 came to\n\nlive with A-1 and A-2 at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86.\n\nDuring this period, A-1 and A-2 along with A-3 and A-4\n\nfloated 32 Partnership Firms/Companies, which are\n\nmentioned in the charge sheet. During the above period,\n\nthere was no business activity in the above mentioned\n\nFirms/Companies. The activities were more in the nature\n\nof acquiring lands, machinery, buildings and vehicles which\n\nwere not production-oriented. No income tax returns were\n\nfiled by these Firms as expected by law. No assessment\n\nfor commercial tax has also been done with respect to the\n\nbusinesses of these Firms. They have not filed their\n\nreturns. A-1 has also not filed her income tax returns for\nthe assessment years 1987-88 till November 1992. When\n\nthis issue was raised by the complainant, A-1 filed income\n\ntax returns for the above periods in November 1992.\n\nSubsequent to 1.7.1991, assets in the forms of movable\n\nand immovable properties and pecuniary resources like\n\nbank deposits, etc. are found acquired not only in the\n\nname of A-1 but also in the names of A-2 to A-4 and the\n\nFirms floated in their names. A scrutiny of the various\n\nbank accounts maintained in the names of A-1 to A-4 and\n\nin the names of different Firms disclose that huge credits\n\nin cash and cash had been frequently made into various\n\naccounts which were not commensurate with the income of\n\nthe individuals and of the Firms concerned. There were\n\nfrequent transfers of amount between one account to the\n\nothers to facilitate illegal acquisition of assets. The huge\n\nquantum of such assets when viewed along with the facts\n\nthat A-1 was holding the office of Chief Minister and that\n\nA-2 to A-4 were living under the same roof with A-1 and\n\nnot having sufficient means to acquire the assets in their\n\nnames have established that the assets were actually\n\nacquired only by A-1. There was thus criminal conspiracy\n\nbetween A-1 and her associates, A-2 to A-4 to possess\nproperties and pecuniary resources by A-1 in her name\n\nand in the names of A-2 to A-4 and in the names of\n\nvarious Firms floated by them. Further, A-2 to A-4 had\n\npursuant to the said conspiracy held the said properties\n\nand pecuniary resources in their names and in the names\n\nof the Firms floated by them on behalf of A-1. Pursuant to\n\nthe said conspiracy, the properties, expensive jewellery\n\nand pecuniary resources were acquired by A-1 in her name\n\nand in the names of A-2 to A-4 and also in the names of\n\nvarious Firms. As on 30.4.1996, the assets thus acquired\n\nand possessed by A-1 are found to be worth\n\nRs.66,44,73,573/-.\n\nHe further states that in the present case, the\n\nprosecution has clearly proved beyond reasonable doubt\n\nthat the accused persons possess properties\n\ndisproportionate to their known sources of income. The\n\nburden is shifted to the accused to satisfactorily account\n\nfor the properties acquired. The accused were unable to\n\naccount for disproportionate assets even through\n\npreponderance of probabilities.\nHe further states that financial status of A-1 prior to\n\nher joining as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu also has to be\n\ntaken note of Ms. J. Jayalalitha, who showed 'NIL' Income\n\nand Wealth in 1985-86, she ceased to be an actress since\n\n1979. After becoming Chief Minister, she doubled her\n\nincome, tripled her wealth despite of drawing only Rs.1/-\n\nper month as salary of Chief Minister. It is obvious she is\n\nsome kind of financial wizard.\n\nHe further states that A-1's Wealth in the year 1992-\n\n93, in her returns, it is stated by her to be about\n\nRs.6,00,00,000/- (Rupees Six Crores). This is unbelievable\n\nand represents ill-gotten wealth. Income tax authorities\n\nhave sent her a notice on 14.12.1992. Notice sent was\n\nunder\nSection 16\nof the Wealth Tax Act and\nSection 148\nof\n\nIncome Tax Act.\n\nHe further states that A-1 owns 10 acres of Grape-\n\nWine Farm land in Hyderabad. She has claimed income of\n\nabout Rs.1 Lakh per acre from that Farm, after she\n\nbecame the Chief Minister of Tamilnadu. When her\n\nposition grows, the yield also grows. There is no reason\n\nwhy no such abnormal and unbelievable agricultural\nincome during the past years when she was not the Chief\n\nMinister. In fact, she was not in a position to build a Farm\n\nHouse with her own funds. The large scale of corruption\n\nengaged by A-1 after she becomes the Chief Minster\n\nclearly comes out when one considers her poverty status in\n\n1986 when she had taken a loan of nearly Rs.4 lakhs from\n\nMr.Ramaswamy Wodeyar, the Liquor Baron, on\n\ninstructions from the former Chief Minister\n\nM.G.Ramachandran to build her Farm House in Hyderabad.\n\nShe was a debtor in 1986. She took salary of Rs.1/-. She\n\nearned wealth in multi-crores without doing any gainful\n\nwork.\n\nHe further states that after A-1 became the Chief\n\nMinister, her financial status was not sound. She had an\n\nintention of purchasing 1.1378 grounds comprised in\n\nR.S.No.1567 of 63, Plot No.31-A, Block No.31, Mylapore\n\nDivision, adjacent to her house No.36, Poes Garden, but\n\nthe land owner was reluctant not to sell the same. The\n\nnormal market value of 1.1378 grounds in 1991 was more\n\nthan Rs.45 Lakhs. But this land was purchased and\n\nregistered on 26.7.1992 for Rs.8 Lakhs. Her financial\n\nposition was not sound to pay the sale consideration\namount by a single cheque. But she paid by three\n\ncheques, one for Rs.1 lakh, another for Rs.4 lakhs and\n\nanother cheque for Rs.3 lakhs.\n\nHe further states that defence witness examined in\n\nthis case have not adduced any valuable evidence to\n\ndiscard the prosecution evidence satisfactorily account for\n\nthe possession of huge assets disproportionate to the\n\nknown sources of income of A-1. The calculation adduced\n\nby the defence witness does not tally with the income\n\nshown by the prosecution for A-1 to A-4 and the Firms.\n\nThe evidence of defence witnesses for giving money to the\n\nFirms are not supported by any documentary, legal\n\nevidence and cannot be accepted as a lawful source of\n\nincome. Moreover, cross-examination of these witnesses\n\nhave established the fact that their claims were not based\n\non any documentary proof, but are merely oral. They\n\nhave come forward at a belated stage in order to save the\n\naccused from the criminal liability.\n\nHe further states that the plea taken by the A-1 in\n\nparagraphs 15 to 18 of the grounds of the appeal that\n\nsince income tax authorities had compounded the offences\nof A-1, failure to file income tax returns under\nSection 279\n\nof the Income Tax Act and by paying the dues and penalty,\n\nA-1 had been exonerated of any amassing of wealth\n\nillegally has no relevance in these proceedings in appeal\n\nherein, since it is well settled that such compounding has\n\nno bearing on prosecution.\n\nHe further states that as per paragraph-14 of the\n\ngrounds of appeal, income tax authorities had \"accepted\"\n\nher statement of income to be \"true and genuine\". This is\n\nfalse. Income tax authorities have not made and cannot\n\nmake any admission under Section 279 or any other\n\nprovisions of the\nIncome Tax Act\n. Thus, A-1 and others\n\ncannot escape from the clutches of the\nPrevention of\n\nCorruption Act\non the basis of disposal of the case on\n\ncompounding of the same under the\nIncome Tax Act\nand\n\ntake shelter in this appeal under this guise of compounding\n\nof the offences under the\nIncome Tax Act\n. The findings\n\nrendered by the Income Tax Department under Section\n\n279 would not be binding on the trial Court or in the\n\nadjudication of this appeal. What is more serious is that\n\nthe income tax compounding procedure was restricted to\n\nthe recovery of the income tax due and an agreement to\npay the same by A-1 willingly. It does not in any way\n\nrepresent legal vindication of any claims of A-1 and how\n\nthe income she claimed was earned.\n\nHe further states that the money flow chart\n\nestablishes that the ill-gotten money which was deposited\n\nby cash into the accounts of the accused persons and the\n\ncompanies floated by them was indeed used by them to\n\npurchase the properties and to acquire other assets. The\n\nmatrix of arguments of A-1 and the grounds adduced are\n\neither vague or exaggerated or full of weak or bald\n\nassertion without any factual basis and stretches of\n\ncredibility beyond human credulity as shown in\n\nparagraphs-116, 119 and 136 of the grounds of the\n\nappeal. Grounds urged in the Crl.A.No.835/2014 is vague,\n\nwithout merits and devoid of substance. Therefore, he\n\nrequests to confirm the conviction and the sentence\n\nimposed by the trial Court.\n\nThe written arguments filed by the third\n\nparty/intervener are as under:\n\nMost of the witnesses upto PW.57 speak about the\n\nsale of land to various business persons and accused\npersons.

He explained how\n\nhe had arrived at the final figure of Rs.66,30,30,000/-.\n\nThe above mentioned are the star witnesses of the\n\nprosecution which prove beyond all reasonable doubt the\n\nguilt of A-1 to A-4 in amassing assets disproportionate to\n\ntheir known sources of income. Especially the witnesses\n\nPWs.182, 201 and 209 who are the bank officials clearly\n\nspeak about how money was flowing from the account of\n\nA-1 and A-2 and into the account of various companies.\n\nThe accused persons set-up various defences and\n\nthey can be broadly classified under the following\n\nheadings:\n\na) Marriage Expenses was not properly computed.\n\nb) The construction costs were overly inflated and\n\nshould not be relied upon.\n\nc) The companies have a separate existence from\n\nthat of the accused and their properties should\n\nnot be considered as that of the accused persons.\n\nd) The amounts deposited into the account of\n\nNamadhu MGR was that of the proceeds of the\n\nDeposit Scheme.\ne) The Income-tax returns of the accused should be\n\nrelied upon and accepted by the Criminal Court.\n\nf) There is no material for conspiracy.\n\nAn attempt has been made by the accused persons\n\nto show that they had huge income to purchase the\n\nproperties, by filing inflated income tax returns belatedly\n\nand after the charge sheet was filed in the case. The\n\nIncome-tax returns of the Cheque period 1991 to 1996\n\nwas filed after 1997 when the charge sheet in this case\n\nwas filed. It is apparent on the face of it that the Tax\n\nreturns were filed as an afterthought to account for the\n\nillegitimate assets acquired by the accused persons, hence\n\ndo not fall with the explanation under\nSection 13(1)(e)\nof\n\nthe P.C.Act. The third party Intervener submits that the\n\ncriminal liability of the accused will not be absolved even if\n\nthe Income-tax Appellate Authority accept the tax returns.\n\nThe Income Tax Department is only a revenue collecting\n\nauthority and not an Anti-Corruption Tribunal. The duty of\n\nany revenue collecting authority is only to scrutinize the\n\nreturns and accept the tax. The Income Tax authorities do\n\nnot enquire into the lawful source of the amounts disclosed\n\nand give finding regarding the commission of bribery;\nwhereas the accused are charged for criminal liability when\n\nthe lawful source of income is not disclosed as per\nSection\nof the P.C.Act. The Income Tax authorities merely\n\naccepts the returns filed and collected tax irrespective of\n\nthe source of income. On perusal of the entire evidence on\n\nbehalf of the prosecution and the defence, it is evident that\n\nthere is no plausible explanation offered by the accused for\n\nthe properties acquired by them. The accused have rested\n\ntheir defence solely on the balance sheet and the profit\n\nand loss account statements said to have been filed before\n\nthe Income Tax authorities. But, the said documents are\n\nnot proved in accordance with law and they are not in\n\ncompliance with the statutory requirements. The auditors\n\nexamined by the accused are found to be cropped up to\n\nsupport the false defence set up by the accused. The\n\nauditors examined by the accused did not handle their\n\naccounts during the check period and they were not\n\nconversant with the true facts. The returns and the\n\nbalance sheet and the profit and loss account were\n\nmaneuvered solely with a view to offer an explanation to\n\nthe huge unexplained credits entered in their respective\n\nbank accounts.\nDW.1 nor the accused have named the persons who\n\nremitted the money to this account. The entries contained\n\nin Ex.D15 show that, the account was opened on\n\n14.8.1995 by remitting cash of Rs.1,001/- and on\n\n22.8.1995, a sum of Rs.3,40,000/-, Rs.7 Lakhs,\n\nRs.23,35,500/-, Rs.58,80,000/-, Rs.17,80,521/- is\n\nremitted to this account and on 23.8.1995, Rs.28 Lakhs\n\nhas been remitted. Even with regard to the source of the\n\nmoney remitted to this account, the version of DW.1 is\n\nthat, it is remitted by the family members. There is no\n\nevidence as to who specifically remitted this money. It has\n\ncome in evidence that the bride's father has handed over\n\nRs.14 Lakhs to PW.200 towards the marriage expenses. If\n\nbank account was opened to meet the marriage expenses\n\nand all the arrangements were looked after by DW.1 as\n\ncontended by the accused, there is no explanation as to\n\nwhy the father of the bride has to pay Rs.14 Lakhs to\n\nPW.200.\n\nThe evidence of DW.1 and the other witnesses\n\nexamined by the accused in support of their contention\n\nthat the marriage expenses were met by the bride's family\n\nis completely falsified by the declaration made by A-1 in\nher returns filed before the Income Tax Authorities as per\n\nEx.P2176, wherein she has declared Rs.29,92,761/- as the\n\namount spent by her towards the marriage. Further, if the\n\nmarriage expenses were looked after by DW.1 and he was\n\nmaintaining the account, there is no explanation by the\n\naccused as to how the original receipts and all other\n\nconnected documents in relation to the marriage expenses\n\nwere seized from the office of PW.228 under Ex.P2218.\n\nOn the other hand, several witnesses examined by the\n\naccused have consistently deposed that on hearing the\n\nmarriage of A-3, they approached A-1 expressing their\n\nintention to contribute their might. This evidence once\n\nagain indicates that the arrangements were made and\n\neven the payments were made by A-1.\n\nThe prosecution has listed 19 new/additional\n\nconstruction said to have been constructed by the accused\n\nduring the check period. The total value of these\n\nconstructions come to Rs.18,17,40,430/-.\n\nThe accused persons miserably failed in their duty to\n\nprove the facts within their special knowledge. They\n\ninstead of letting in evidence to show that the valuation\nand assessment of the buildings are higher, never gave\n\nwhat is the value of the building as per their calculations.\n\nThey instead questioned the valuation of the prosecution\n\nand sought that the entire valuation has to be discarded\n\nfrom consideration. When the value of materials and the\n\ncost of the construction is within the special knowledge of\n\nthe accused persons, it is their bounded duty to let in\n\nevidence. When they failed to in their obligation to\n\ndischarge that burden the trial Court came to the\n\nconclusion in valuing the buildings. The Engineers\n\nexamined by the prosecution are competent to estimate\n\nthe valuation of the structures. The accused themselves\n\nhave relied on the valuation report prepared by the PWD\n\nEngineers, who were part of the team to controvert the\n\nreports prepared by the prosecution witnesses. It is not\n\nexplained by the accused persons as to why the reports\n\nprepared by DW78 and DW83 are preferable to the reports\n\nprepared by the entire team which are proved in a Court of\n\nLaw. The actual cost incurred for the construction is within\n\nthe knowledge of the accused. It is the case of the accused\n\nthat contractors and architects were appointed in\n\nconnection with the construction.\nThe third Party Intervener submits that the modus of\n\nthe accused persons was to purchase defunct companies\n\nfrom its original owner then launder money obtained by\n\ncorrupt means through these companies. For this purpose,\n\nthey floated about 34 companies and opened around 100\n\nbank accounts in the names of these companies and\n\ndeposited cash into the company accounts. The documents\n\nof the companies show that these companies did not do\n\nany business except purchasing properties. At the relevant\n\ntime of acquisition of the properties during the cheque\n\nperiod, the six companies through which most of the\n\nproperties are purchased are:\n\n1) Riverway Agro Products\n\n2) Meadow Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd.\n\n3) Lex Property Development Pvt. Ltd.\n\n4) Ramraj Agro Mills Pvt.Ltd.\n\n5) Indo-Doha Chemicals Pvt. Ltd.\n\n6) Signora Enterprises\n\nThese companies were exclusively under the control\n\nand management of A2 to A4. The registration address of\n\nmost of the companies is 36, Poes Garden, Chennai. The\n\npromoters had already resigned in favour of A2 to A4.\nExcept Indo-Doha Pharmaceuticals Company Pvt. Ltd. all\n\nother promoters and erstwhile Directors have categorically\n\nstated before the Court that, on receipt of the amount\n\ninvested by them for the formation of companies, they\n\nsigned the necessary forms and went out of the company\n\nand since then, they ceased of any right or interest in the\n\nsaid property. The promoter Directors have categorically\n\nstated before the Court that they did not purchase any\n\nproperties in their names either before or after the\n\nformation of the company as long as they were on the\n\nBoard of Directors. A2 to A4 took over the management of\n\nthe company without even buying the requisite shares.\n\nThe illegally amassed wealth running to nearly 3000 acres\n\nof land is sparked in these companies. The properties\n\nregistered in the name of the companies and even dispose\n\nthem of merely by passing a mere resolution. The\n\nintention of the accused in buying over the above\n\ncompanies and taking full control over the management\n\nthereof and thereafter acquire large number of properties\n\nin the name of the companies undoubtedly manifest the\n\ncriminal motive and intention of the accused attracting the\ningredients of offences under\nSection 13(1) (e)\nof the PC\n\nAct read with\nSection 120-B\nof IPC.\n\nThe evidence of PW.182-Arunachalam, PW.203-\n\nVidyasagar and PW.209-Manickavasagam clearly would\n\nprove that the bank accounts were opened by A2 and A3 in\n\nthe name of the companies only after they took over the\n\nmanagement and control of the companies and all the\n\ntransactions relating to the said companies are stated to\n\nhave taken place through these accounts. The most\n\nimportant piece of link which connects all the accused and\n\nproves conspiracy is the fact that the funds were\n\ntransferred or remitted to these above mentioned accounts\n\neither from the bank account held in the name of Namadhu\n\nMGR, Jaya Publications or other firms run by A1 and A2.\n\nThe funds for the acquisition of the properties had flown\n\nfrom A1 either directly or through the accounts maintained\n\nin the joint names of A1 and A2.\n\nThe evidence of the erstwhile owners of these\n\ncompanies, would clearly reveal that no funds of the above\n\nnamed companies were utilized for the acquisition of the\n\nproperties. It is an admitted fact that none of the\ncompanies had filed returns either before the Registrar of\n\nCompanies or before the Income Tax Authorities declaring\n\nthe funds for the purchase of the properties or the\n\nacquisitions alleged to have been made in the name of the\n\ncompanies. The money flow chart would clearly reveal that\n\nthe funds from the purchase of these properties are proved\n\nto have been flown from the sources provided by A1 and\n\nall throughout the properties were treated as private\n\nproperties of A3 and A4. A3 and A4 obtained loan for\n\neffecting improvements in these properties and there is\n\nnothing on record to show that the loan liability has been\n\ntaken over by the above companies. It is proved beyond\n\nall reasonable doubt that these companies purchased\n\nproperties only out of the funds funneled through\n\nNamadhu MGR account in which unexplained cash was\n\ndeposited. The above companies were never represented\n\nby either the Secretary or Director and in any of the\n\nregistered deeds. Even the addresses of the companies\n\nwere never written in the body of the deed. The Registrar\n\nwho registered these properties PW181 who negotiated for\n\nthe purchase of the properties bent the rules only to help\n\nA1. The circumstances brought out in their evidence clearly\nindicate that they went out of the way to register these\n\nproperties as instructed by A1 solely to oblige A1. The\n\ncorporate veil of these companies, have to be pierced since\n\nthey were used as front for parking illegal funds.\n\nThe deposits of huge cash clearly reveal the\n\nconspiracy of A1, A2, A3 and A4 to amass wealth through\n\nillegal means. The 3rd party Intervenor submits that the\n\nproperties purchased by the accused persons, the money\n\nwas paid by way of cash or from the accounts held by the\n\naccused persons. He further submits that the ill-gotten\n\nmoney which was deposited by cash into the accounts of\n\nthe accused persons and the companies floated by them\n\nwas indeed used by them to purchase the properties and\n\nacquire other assets.\n\nNamadhu MGR deposit scheme is a bogus plea. The\n\ndefence set up by the accused that Namadhu MGR\n\nnewspaper floated a deposit scheme and the monies\n\ndeposited there were the monies of the depositors was a\n\nfalse plea. The auditors examined by the accused did not\n\nhandle their accounts during the check period and they\n\nwere not conversant with the true facts. The returns and\nthe balance sheet and the profit and loss account were\n\nmaneuvered solely with a view to offer an explanation to\n\nthe huge unexplained credits entered in their respective\n\nbanks accounts. The prosecution has proved that there\n\nwas no real source of income with the other accused and\n\nthe public servant is expected to show the real and lawful\n\nsource. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to\n\nshow that, during the check period, either the accused or\n\nthe firms run by them credited any amounts to the various\n\naccounts maintained by them. The story of the scheme\n\ndeposit canvassed by the accused has taken birth only\n\nafter filing of the charge sheet. There is not even a stray\n\nevidence to suggest that the said deposit scheme was in\n\ncirculation any time before the registration of the criminal\n\ncase against the accused. There is nothing in the entire\n\nevidence indicating that the accused had declared the said\n\ndeposit before the Income Tax authorities any time during\n\nthe check period. As already narrated above, the\n\nexistence of the said scheme was brought to light only in\n\nthe year 1998 in the returns filed on behalf of the said\n\nfirms. It is only after filing of the charge sheet, the\n\naccused appear to have master minded the above defence\nwith the active connivance of DW88, who claims to be the\n\nChartered Accountant of the accused with a view to create\n\nevidence in a bid to offer an explanation for the huge\n\namount of unaccounted money found with A1.\n\nThe accused have not produced any material before\n\nthe Court to show that Dr. Namadhu MGR had floated the\n\ndeposit scheme inviting subscription from the General\n\nPublic. M/s. S. Jaya Publication was an assessee of Income\n\nTax with Central Circle-II, Chennai from the year 1991.\n\nThe trial Court by convincing reasoning based on the\n\nevidence and analysis of the documents gives a categorical\n\nfinding that Namadhu MGR deposit scheme is a bogus\n\nscheme and an afterthought. The defence harped upon the\n\nfact that the transactions are all benami transactions and\n\nas per the abolition of\nBenami Transactions Act\n, no\n\nprosecution could be launched against the accused\n\npersons. The defence witnesses examined in this case\n\nhave not adduced any valuable evidence to discard the\n\nprosecution nor their evidence satisfactorily account for the\n\npossession of huge assets disproportionate to the known\n\nincome of A1. The calculation adduced by the defence\n\nwitnesses do not tally with the income shown by the\nprosecution for accused Nos.1 to 4 and their respective\n\nfirms.\n\nThe evidence of defence witnesses for giving money\n\nto the firms are not supported by any documentary legal\n\nevidence and cannot be accepted as a lawful source of\n\nincome. Hence, he prays for confirming the sentence and\n\nfine imposed by the trial Court to convict the accused\n\nNos.1 to 4.\n\nThe brief reply filed on behalf of the appellant\n\nto the written arguments filed by Dr. Subramanian\n\nSwamy is as under:\n\nAllegations against the appellant are borne out in a\n\ndesperate attempt to tarnish the name of A-1 without any\n\nsupporting material. The provision of law mentioned is\n\nwrong. Factual mistakes have been deliberately made\n\nwith a view to gain cheap publicity. This shows that if\n\nthird party opponents who are nurturing a personal\n\nanimosity against A-1 are permitted this solemn Court\n\nproceedings would degenerate into legalized means of\n\nwrecking personal vengeance. Namadu MGR is not a Firm.\n\nIt is a Newspaper run by Jaya Publications. The averments\nmade in paragraph-7 that A-1 as a member of Legislative\n\nAssembly acquired and possessed pecuniary resources\n\nwhich are not commensurate with her known sources of\n\nincome is wrong. In fact, deliberately, a false case has\n\nbeen lodged against the accused by the then DMK\n\nGovernment. The case was investigated and found to be\n\nfalse. The case was closed and closure report was\n\naccepted by the Principal Sessions Judge, Chennai, as per\n\nEx.D.374. The averments made in paragraph-9 of the\n\nwritten arguments mentioning that the appellant and A-2\n\nhave floated several Firms and listed 32 entities. This is\n\nfactually wrong. It is not even the case of the prosecution\n\nthat A-1 has floated these Firms or that A-1 was ever a\n\nPartner of these Firms. The assessment of the appellant\n\neither under the\nIncome Tax Act\nor\nWealth Tax Act\nwere\n\nalways scrutiny assessments which were duly completed\n\nand return of income as filed by the appellant has been\n\naccepted. This is the position for all the five years of check\n\nperiod. The allegation in paragprah-10 that there has been\n\na huge deposit of money in the account of the Firms and\n\nthe appellant cannot be justified, it only demonstrate lack\n\nof deep study of the documents filed and the explanation\noffered by the appellant. Appellant, Jaya Publication, Sasi\n\nEnterprises have been assessed under the\nIncome Tax Act\n.\n\nAssessment Orders and the orders of CIT (Appeals),\n\ncovering the entire five years of the check period have\n\nbeen produced and marked in evidence on behalf of the\n\nappellant. A perusal of those orders will belie the version\n\nof the complainant. That in none of the years during check\n\nperiod, the appellant or Jaya Publications or Sasi\n\nEnterprises have ever been made to pay tax on any\n\nunexplained income or unexplained expenditure. The\n\nallegations made in paragraph-10 are incorrect. The\n\nallegation that there was conspiracy between the appellant\n\nand A-2 to A-4 are made without any justification. Original\n\ncomplainant is not acquainted with the facts of the case.\n\nIt is revealed from the figure shown by the complainant in\n\nparagraph-13 that the value of the alleged\n\ndisproportionate assets is Rs.66,44,73,573/- whereas\n\naccording to Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption\n\nDepartment, the value of alleged disproportionate assets is\n\nRs.66,56,20,395/-. In paragraph-19(ii), the complainant\n\nhas stated that the appellant has declared Rs.60 Crores\n\nand has wondered how the appellant could have got it.\nThis is a deliberate false statement. These are made with\n\nan eye for sensationalism. Her agricultural income during\n\ncheck period has been accepted upto the Tribunal level. It\n\nis a lie and defamation to allege that the appellant had\n\ntaken loan from Rs.4 Lakhs from Ramaswamy Udayar from\n\na Liquor Barron and that too with instruction of\n\nSri M.G.Ramachandran to build a Farm House at\n\nHyderabad. There is no such incident. The complainant\n\nhas asserted many things in a desperate attempt to\n\nsomehow implicate A-1. These averments show that the\n\ncomplainant is trying to clutch at a straw.\n\nThe defence witnesses have given oral evidence\n\nsupported by documentary evidence. Their evidence is\n\nfortified by the decisions of IT authorities upheld up to the\n\nTribunal level in favour of the appellant.\n\nThe averments made in paragraphs-24 and 25\n\nappear to indicate poor understanding of factual aspects.\n\nThe compounding was in respect of non-filing of returns for\n\nthe assessment year 1993-94. The compounding was\n\naccepted on 26.11.2014, whereas the appeal was filed in\n\nSeptember 2014. Hence, the averments relating to\ncompounding order of Income Tax authorities were made\n\nin appeal is a lie. The compounding was with respect to\n\nfiling of returns in the year 1993-94 and on account of\n\ncriminal prosecution having been lodged against the\n\nappellant. In view of the compounding, the prosecution\n\nlaid against the appellant by the Income Tax department\n\nfor non-filing of return was withdrawn and the same was\n\ndismissed in favour of the appellant. It is\n\nincomprehensible as to how this has any relevance to the\n\nissue involved in the present case.\n\nThe averments made in paragraph-25 that the\n\nappellant has stated in memorandum of appeal that I.T.\n\nauthorities as \"true and genuine\" and it is on account of\n\nthe compounding. The same is wrong. The facts stated\n\nabove make it clear that the income and expenditure were\n\nindependently determined and it is not on account of\n\ncompounding under\nIncome Tax Act\n. The appellant has\n\nnot in any manner relied upon the acceptance of the\n\ncompounding application. Hence the allegation of\n\ncomplainant in this regard is a factual misstatement. The\n\nwritten arguments filed by the complainant is riddled with\nfactual misstatements made deliberately. It does not add\n\nanything to aid this Court in deciding this appeal.\n\nIn the case of ANBAZHAGAN V/S. STATE OF\n\nKARNATAKA in Crl.A.No.637/2015, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India has observed at paragraph No.36\n\nas under:\n\n\"36. We have referred to the aforesaid\ntwo authorities only to highlight the gravity of\nthe offence. We are absolutely sure that the\nlearned Single Judge, as the appellate Judge,\nshall keep in mind the real functioning of an\nappellate court. The appellate court has a duty\nto make a complete and comprehensive\nappreciation of all vital features of the case.\nThe evidence brought on record in entirety has\nto be scrutinized with care and caution. It is\nthe duty of the Judge to see that justice is\nappropriately administered, for that is the\nparamount consideration of a Judge. The said\nresponsibility cannot be abdicated or\nabandoned or ostracized, even remotely, solely\nbecause there might not have been proper\nassistance by the counsel appearing for the\nparties. The appellate court is required to\nweigh the materials, ascribe concrete reasons\nand the filament of reasoning must logically\nflow from the requisite analysis of the material\non record. The approach cannot be cryptic. It\ncannot be perverse. The duty of the Judge is\nto consider the evidence objectively and\ndispassionately. The reasonings in appeal are\nto be well deliberated. They are to be\nresolutely expressed. An objective judgment\nof the evidence reflects the greatness of mind\n\n- sans passion and sans prejudice. The\nreflective attitude of the Judge must be\ndemonstrable from the judgment itself. A\njudge must avoid all kind of weakness and\nvacillation. That is the sole test. That is the\nlitmus test. This being the position of a Judge,\nwhich is more elevated as the appellate Judge,\nwe are of the considered opinion that there is\nno justification for rehearing of the appeal as\nthe matter has been heard at length and\nreserved for verdict. The appellant has\nsubmitted his written note of submissions\nbefore the trial court and, therefore, we are\ninclined to permit him to file a written note of\nsubmissions within 90 pages before the\nlearned Single Judge/Appellate Judge. The\nState of Karnataka, which is the prosecuting\nagency, is granted permission to file written\nnote of submissions within 50 pages. The\nwritten submissions be filed latest by\n28.4.2015. The written note of submissions\nfiled before the trial court and the High Court\nalong with written note of submissions of State\nof Karnataka shall be considered by the\nlearned Single Judge and the consideration\nshould be manifest in the judgment. Written\nnote of submissions, if any, by the 4th\nrespondent shall not be considered by the\nlearned Judge. A copy of our judgment be\nsent by the Registry of this Court in course of\nthe day to the Registrar General of the High\nCourt of Karnataka so that he can place the\njudgment before the learned Single Judge for\nperusal and guidance.\"\n\nThere is no dispute with regard to the proposition of\n\nlaw laid-down in the above mentioned decisions.\n\n10. After hearing the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, learned counsel for the respondents and\n\nalso after considering the written submissions of\n\nSri.B.V.Acharya, Special Public Prosecutor,\n\nDr.Subramanian Swamy, K.Anbazhagan, the\n\nfollowing points arise for my consideration:\n\n[1] Whether the appellants - Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are\nguilty of offence with which they were charged and\nconvicted?\n\n[2] Whether the Accused Nos. 2 to 4 were parties to\ncriminal conspiracy with the object of possessing\nassets and resources of income in the name of\nAccused No.1 and in the name of Accused Nos. 2 to\n4 and 32 business enterprises floated in the names\n\nof Accused Nos. 2 to 4 and also Accused Nos. 2 to 4\n\nabetted with Accused No.1 for acquiring the\nproperties?\n\n[3] Whether the confiscation of immovable properties\nand auctioning the gold and diamond ornaments to\nmake deficit of fine amount good and remaining gold\nand diamond jewellery to be confiscated to the\nGovernment is sustainable in law or not?\n\n11. My answers to the above points are as\n\nunder for the following reasons:\n\nLitigation made by persons who advance the political\n\ngain and to settle the scores under the guise to fight a\n\nlegal battle should not be entertained. Liberty of the\n\naccused cannot be taken away except in accordance with\n\nestablished procedure of law, under the Constitution,\n\ncriminal procedure and other cognate statutes. Fair\n\ninvestigation requires that accused should not be kept in\n\ndarkness. Investigating officer must give an opportunity\n\nto the accused, call upon him to account for the excess of\n\nthe accounts over the known sources of income. The\n\nchoice of check period must be necessarily be determined\n\nby the allegations of facts on which the prosecution if\nfounded and rests. The period must be such as to yield\n\ntrue and comprehensive source of income and the\n\npecuniary resources and property in question of the public\n\nservant, either by himself or through any other person on\n\nhis behalf which are alleged to be not disproportionate. It\n\nis for the prosecution to choose the period, having regard\n\nto the acquisitive activities of the public servant in\n\namassing wealth, characterize and isolate that period for a\n\nspecial scrutiny.\n\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh issued Memo\n\nNo.700/SC D/88-4 dated 13.2.1989 for the benefit of the\n\nGovernment servant giving certain guidelines to the Anti\n\nCorruption Bureau is entitled to give allowance of a\n\nreasonable margin of 20% on the total income of a\n\nGovernment servant while computing disproportionate\n\nassets. On the basis of this memorandum of the State\n\nGovernment the High Court of Andhra Pradesh rendered in\n\nS.Thiremolaiah v. State of A.P. Inspector of Police II\n\nA.C.B., Karnool Range, Karnool\n, in which the learned Judge\n\nhas given the benefit of this Government Memo to the\n\nappellant therein though the appellant\nin that case\nwas\nprosecuted in the year 1983, that is 6 years before the\n\nissue of this Memo as in the case on hand.\n\nIn Agnihotri's case, the Apex Court held since the\n\nexcess asset was comparatively small, being less than\n\n10% of the total income of Rs.1,27,715.43/-, it would not\n\nbe right to hold that the asset found in the possession of\n\nthe accused were disproportionate to his known source of\n\nincome so as to justify the raising of presumption under\n\nSection 5(3)\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act. Proof of\n\nunexplained possession of resources or property\n\ndisproportionate to known source of income, a\n\npresumption of misconduct was made against the accused.\n\nThe reasons being that if the percentage begins to raise in\n\neach case, it gets extended till it reaches the level of\n\nincredulity to give benefit of doubt. Proof of unexplained\n\npossession of resources or property disproportionate to\n\nknown source, a presumption of misconduct was made\n\nagainst the accused. Sub-\nSection 5\nbased on a rule of\n\nevidence enabling a Court to raise a presumption of guilt in\n\ncircumstances a rule which is a complete departure from\n\nthe established principles of criminal jurisprudence that the\n\nburden always lies on the prosecution to prove all the\ningredients of the offence charged and that the burden\n\nnever shifts on the accused to disprove the charges framed\n\nagainst him (G.V.NAIR V/S.

It is clear therefore where\n\na person is charged with criminal misconduct and it is seen\n\nthat he is in possession of property or income which could\n\nnot have been amassed or earned by the official\n\nremuneration which he has obtained, then the Court is\n\nentitled to come to the conclusion that the amassing of\n\nsuch wealth was due to bribery or corruption.\n\nCharge ought to disclose under which of the different\n\nclauses of Sub-Section (1) the offence of criminal\n\nmisconduct has been committed.\n\nThe Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act and\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act\noperate in different fields. The\n\nsource of income of a particular individual will depend upon\n\nhis position in life with reference to particular occupation\n\nor avocation in view. Known source of income means\n\nknown source of income to the prosecution after a\n\nthorough investigation and the onus of satisfactorily\n\naccounting for it is not as heavy. An onus is on the\nprosecution to prove its case beyond all possibility of\n\ndoubt. (HEMANTA KUMAR MOHANTY V/S. STATE OF\n\nORISSA, 1973(1) SLR 1121).\n\nIncome is the receipt in the hand of the recipient. It\n\nis because of one's labour or expertise or property or\n\ninvestment. Windfall, gains of grafts, crime or immoral\n\naccretion will not come under the purview of known source\n\nof income.\n\nThe prosecution cannot be absolved of its liability on\n\nthe ground that it was not aware of the said income on the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case. The Government\n\nservant is to satisfactorily account for the disproportionate\n\nassets and not to prove his claim with mathematical\n\nexactitude (accuracy) beyond all possibility of doubt. One\n\nin many might be keeping accounts of expenditure for his\n\nsatisfaction, but why should he procure and preserve\n\nsupporting bills and vouchers? These are not government\n\ncash to be audited. Besides why should one keep them\n\nfrom the beginning of his career till his superannuation\n\nanticipating, to be required in a Court of Law? Even for\n\ncertain expenditure supporting vouchers are not feasible\nfor which audit accepts a flat rate. (HEMANTA KUMAR\n\nMOHANTY V/S. STATE OF ORISSA, 1973(1) SLR\n\n1121).\n\nFanciful claims, unreasonable apprehensions, vague\n\npossibilities cannot be hiding ground for accused persons.\n\nHe is bound to answer where there is no clear tendency to\n\ncriminate.

First part of the Section cast a\n\nburden on the prosecution and the second on the accused.\n\nThe accused is not bound to prove his innocence beyond\n\nall reasonable doubt. All that he needs to do is to bring\n\nout a preponderance of probability. (1981 Crl.L.J. 884)\n\nThe accused lead overwhelming evidence and\n\ndocuments to show the affluence and substantial means of\n\nhis father-in-law to create a doubt as to his possession\n\nover such property. The accused would be entitled to\n\nacquittal (Vasudevo Ramachandra Kaidalawar - 1981\n\nCRl.L.J. 884).\nA Police Officer with whom an investigation of an\n\noffence under\nSection 5(1)(e)\nof the Act is entrusted\n\nshould not proceed with a pre-conceived idea of guilt of\n\nthat person indicted with such offence and subject him to\n\nany harassment and victimisation, because in case the\n\nallegations of illegal accumulation of wealth are found\n\nduring the course of investigation as baseless, the harm\n\ndone not only to that person but also to the office he held\n\nwill be incalculable and inestimable (STATE OF HARYANA\n\nV/S. BHAJAN LAL - AIR 1992 SC 604).\n\nThe huge expenditure in marriages of daughters is\n\nnot explained and that there is no proper explanation\n\ngiven for the property in the name of his wife.

The agricultural income\n\nshown in an income tax return cannot be considered as a\n\nbasis for ascertaining income from agricultural lands.\n\nIn the absence of any evidence as to the date or the\n\nperiod of acquisition of such assets (gold), the question is\nwhat would be the date or period, which could be ascribed\n\nfor the acquisition of those assets. It is a complex\n\nquestion, which is not easy to answer. But at any time the\n\nassumption that they were acquired on the date of check\n\nperiod does not appear justified.\n\nIn a case of disproportionate assets, a person\n\nemployed in Textile Corporation of India was convicted. In\n\nappeal, the High Court observed that loan taken by the\n\naccused was not added to income and that statement of\n\naccount prepared by the concerned authority did not\n\ncontain all income particulars including the amounts drawn\n\nfrom the firm of his wife and held that the accused is\n\nentitled to benefit of doubt. (RAMESH CHANDER ABBI\n\nV/S. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA, (2006(3) AIR BOM R\n\n577). From this it is clear that, loan has to be added as\n\nan income in the Statement of Account of the accused.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIt is well settled that the burden of showing that a\n\nparticular transaction is benami and the owner is not the\n\nreal owner always rests on the person asserting it to be so\n\nand this burden has to be strictly discharged by adducing\n\nlegal evidence of a definite character which would either\ndirectly prove the fact of benami or establish\n\ncircumstances unerringly and reasonably raising an\n\ninference of that fact. The essence of benami is the\n\nintention of the parties and not unoften, such intention is\n\nshrouded in a thick veil, which cannot be easily pierced\n\nthrough. But such difficulties do not relieve the person\n\nasserting the transaction to be benami of the serious onus\n\nthat rests on him nor justify the acceptance of mere\n\nconjectures or surmises as a substitute for proof. This\n\nevidence, the learned Judge has rejected on imaginary and\n\nflimsy ground.\n\nIt was for the prosecution to prove beyond\n\nreasonable doubt and by means of legal evidence that\n\nthese were Benami properties of accused No.1. Accused\n\nNo.4 had no personal source of income. Accused No.4 was\n\nthe nephew of the Appellant and, therefore, out of love\n\nand affection he had gifted the properties to Accused Nos.2\n\nand 3. It was for the prosecution to establish by legal and\n\ncogent evidence that the gifts were not genuine and that\n\nthey were not the properties of Accused Nos.2 and 3.\nTaking in view of the testimony of all the witnesses,\n\nthe burden of proving that the gold ornaments belongs to\n\nthe appellant and not to Satpal Kaur was on the\n\nprosecution and no material was brought on record by the\n\nprosecution to discharge this burden.\n\nSURYA SANKARAM KARRI V/S.

Section 106 cannot\n\ncome into play where the facts concerned are such as\n\ncapable of being known by others. If it were possible by\n\ndue diligence and proper investigation to find out the facts\n\neven though it may be very difficult to do so, it cannot\n\nrelieve the prosecution from obligation of establishing the\n\ningredients of the offence alleged. This section cannot be\n\nused to shift the onus of establishing an essential\n\ningredient of the offence on Accused. General burden of\nproof of guilt which lies on the prosecution or on authority\n\nin the position of prosecution never shifts - Prosecution\n\ncannot rely on section 106 except in very exceptional\n\ncases and to a very limited extent. Section 106 cannot be\n\npressed into service to relieve the prosecution of its\n\nburden of proving the criminal charge though the burden\n\nof proving a plea specifically set up by an Accused, which\n\nmay absolve him from criminal liability, certainly lies upon\n\nhim, but the quantum of evidence by which he may\n\nsucceed in discharging his burden of creating a reasonable\n\nbelief, that circumstance absolving him from criminal\n\nliability may have existed, is lower than the burden resting\n\nupon the prosecution to establish guilt of the Accused\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Standard of such proof is not\n\nakin to that of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the\n\nAccused. It is trite law that such burden can be discharged\n\nby the Accused showing a preponderance of probabilities.\n\nProsecution must establish all elements of the offence.\n\nPositive facts must be proved by prosecution. Section 106\n\ncannot be invoked to make good the lacuna in proving\n\nessential facts and more emphatically for establishing the\n\nfacts necessary to give jurisdiction to the court.\nOrdinarily, there is very little scope for the application of\n\nsection 106\n, Indian Evidence Act, to criminal cases where\n\nonus of proof is always on the prosecution and the section\n\ncannot be invoked to shift the onus on the Accused. The\n\nprosecution has to establish prima facie case in the first\n\ninstance, it is not enough to establish the facts which give\n\nrise to suspicion and then by reason of section 106 to\n\nthrow the onus on the Accused to prove his innocence. The\n\nabsence of explanation or false explanation is no doubt a\n\ncircumstance that is sometimes relied upon to bring home\n\nthe guilt to the Accused in a case depending on the\n\ncircumstantial evidence, on the ground that the facts\n\nproving his innocence must be within his special knowledge\n\nand that the burden of at least offering a reasonable\n\nexplanation is on him on the principle of\nsection 106\n,\n\nEvidence Act. But this would be so only in cases where\n\nother circumstances proved are so sufficiently strong\n\nagainst him as to point to him as very probably the culprit\n\nand therefore, calling for his explanation. If such a\n\nsituation the Accused gives an explanation which may be\n\nreasonably true in the proved circumstances, the Accused\n\ngets the benefit of doubt though he may not prove the\ntruth of the explanation. But, to infer the guilt of the\n\nAccused from the absence of reasonable explanation [or a\n\nfalse explanation] where other circumstances are not by\n\nthemselves enough to call for his explanation, would be to\n\nrelieve the prosecution of its burden. Section 106 does not\n\ncast any burden on the Accused person to prove that no\n\ncrime was committed by proving the facts specially lying\n\nwithin his knowledge. The section does not warrant a\n\ndirection that, if anything is unexplained which the Jury\n\nthink the Accused could explain, they not only may, but\n\nmust find him guilty. If the knowledge of certain facts is\n\nas much available to the prosecution on exercise of due\n\ndiligence as to the Accused, the facts cannot be said to be\n\nwithin the knowledge of the Accused. Section 106 is\n\nintended to meet certain exceptional cases in which it\n\nwould be impossible or extremely difficult for the\n\nprosecution to prove the facts which is especially within\n\nthe knowledge of the Accused and knowledge of that fact\n\nis not available to the prosecution. However, section 106\n\ncannot be utilized to cast the burden on the Accused to\n\nprove his innocence to relieve the prosecution of its burden\n\nof proof. It is only in cases where the facts proved by the\nevidence give rise to a reasonable inference of guilt unless\n\nthe same is rebutted such inference can be negatived by\n\nproof of some facts which in its nature can only be within\n\nthe special knowledge of the Accused. Section 106 is\n\ndesigned to meet certain exceptional cases in which it\n\nwould be impossible or at any rate proportionately difficult\n\nfor the prosecution to establish the facts which are\n\nespecially within the knowledge of the Accused and which\n\nhe could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. Where\n\nthe prosecution fail to discharge the burden that the\n\noffence was committed by the Accused and it sought to\n\nrely on the fact that the Accused gave false information to\n\nwitnesses regarding cause of death, held the false\n\ninformation given by the Accused would have effect of\n\nbeing simply taken in aid or to lend assurance to the\n\nprosecution story and could never form basis for drawing\n\nan inference that Accused and Accused alone were guilty of\n\nthe offence. [1992 Crl. LJ 1339].\n\nWhere the Accused, a public servant, is found to be\n\nin possession of disproportionate assets, the burden is on\n\nhim to satisfactorily account for his possession of such\n\nassets. However, the Accused is not bound to prove his\ninnocence beyond all reasonable doubt. All that he needs\n\nto do so, is to bring out a preponderance of probabilities\n\n[AIR 1981 SC 1186 = 1981 [3] SCC 199].\n\nJuristic persons are not exception - it is within\n\nspecial knowledge of the Corporation which of its officer\n\nacted in fraudulent manner.\n\nThough in corruption cases, the burden of accounting\n\nfor the assets disproportionate to his income does shift to\n\nthe Accused and he is required to lead evidence and\n\nproduce material to satisfy the court, but even in such\n\ncases the presumption of innocence does not disappear\n\nnor does the basic principle of criminal law that if a\n\nplausible explanation is put forward by the Accused which\n\nfits in within the facts and circumstances of the case that\n\nthe court is duty bound to accept the explanation. [1993\n\nCrl. LJ 2051 [BOM]]\n\nThe degree and character of proof which the Accused\n\nis required to adduce for rebutting the presumption under\n\nsection 4\n[1] of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1947\n,\n\ncannot be equated with the burden resting on the\n\nprosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, a\nnear plausibility of his explanation under\nsection 342\nof the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1898 may not be enough but the\n\npresumption may be discharged if the material on record\n\nrenders the fact presumed to be improbable, the Accused\n\nmay do so by mere preponderance of probability in his\n\nfavour and not by evidence beyond reasonable doubt\n\nbesides if the story set up by the prosecution is\n\ninconsistent with the fact presumed. The presumption\n\nwould be rendered sterile ab initio if not rejected out of\n\njudicial courtesy as still born. [AIR 1977 SC 666 = 1975\n\n[4] SCC 761].\n\nThe burden to prove requisite to raise a presumption\n\nunder\nsection 5\n[3] of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act,\n, lies on the prosecution that he money standing in\n\nthe name of his wife in a bank is a benami asset of the\n\nAccused. [AIR 1977 SC 796].\n\nOnce a requisite proof to convict a public servant for\n\nhaving committed criminal misconduct under\nsection 5\n[2]\n\nread with\nsection 5\n[1][e] of\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n\nhas to be placed on record, held, the burden to account for\n\ndisproportionate assets possessed by him shifts on to the\nAccused. However, he need not prove it beyond\n\nreasonable doubt. He has only to establish his defence by\n\npreponderance of probabilities. [AIR 1981 SC 1186].\n\nThere has been a legal evidence for hearing a\n\nfinding of fact. At least the witness must say that he has\n\npersonal knowledge about the facts about which he is\n\ngiving evidence. If the witness has no personal knowledge\n\nor any means of such knowledge about the facts deposed\n\nby him, his testimony would not be evidence under any\n\nprinciple of law.

Several cases\n\nrelating to corruption or possession of disproportionate\n\nassets have been registered recently against politicians\n\nholding high posts. Who has not heard of Hawala and\n\nBofors today? Even a former Prime Minister is involved in\n\na case of corruption of offering bribes to some MPs. Cases\n\nof disproportionate assets have been registered against\n\nformer Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Himachal\n\nPradesh, Bihar etc. The list is unending. And yet, there\n\ndefinitely are innumerable other cases of corruption by\n\npoliticians which could never see the light of the day.\n\nMPs and MLAs have now been confirmed to be public\n\nservants in the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in\nthe Jharkhand Mukti Morcha case, implying that they are\n\namenable to the offences defined in the\nPrevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988\n.\n\nOne major offence defined in this Act relates to the\n\npossession of assets by a public servant which are\n\ndisproportionate to his known sources of income. This\n\ngenerally results from the acceptance of bribes over a long\n\nperiod of time as such bribes ultimately get reflected in his\n\nassets in one way or the other. With the sources of\n\nincome remaining constant, such extra assets amount to\n\ndisproportionate assets vis-à-vis his known sources of\n\nincome. For a source of income of a public servant to\n\nqualify as a known source of income, the Act requires\n\nfollowing two conditions to be satisfied:\n\n• The income is received from any lawful source;\n\n• Such receipt of income has been intimated in\n\naccordance with the provisions of any law, rules or\n\norder which are applicable to the public servant.\n\nThus, any income received from any unlawful source,\n\ne.g., bribery, smuggling cannot be considered. Secondly,\n\nif the provisions of any law, rules or order require the\nintimation of receipt of any income by a public servant to\n\nany authority, then it should have been properly intimated.\n\nFor example, the receipt of an income may be required to\n\nbe intimated in the Income Tax Return. If such intimation\n\nis not given, then such income cannot be considered. An\n\nincome which thus does not fulfill either of these conditions\n\ncannot be considered for the purposes of deciding the\n\noffence of disproportionate assets.\n\nThe importance of this provision lies in the fact that\n\nfor most public servants, in addition to the requirements\n\nunder laws such as\nIncome Tax Act\n, there are various rules\n\nrequiring intimations about their financial transactions to\n\nbe given to authorities from time to time. For example,\n\nthe All India Services (Conduct) Rules require the IAS and\n\nIPS officers to file a return at the time of their first\n\nappointment about all their assets and liabilities.\n\nSubsequently, they are required to submit a return every\n\nyear showing details of their immovable properties. They\n\nare also required to give advance intimation about every\n\ntransaction in respect of an immovable property. Even\n\ntransactions in movable properties beyond a specific value,\n\ninformation about loans taken, or any family member\njoining any private trade, business or profession have to\n\nbe intimated. This list is only illustrative. These\n\nrequirements are more strict when the transaction or\n\ndealing in question is with a person who has any official\n\ndealings with such officer. Similar rules normally exist for\n\nother public servants.\n\nAll monetary transactions of a public servant are\n\nthus kept under watch since his appointment. A major\n\nadvantage of such rules is that if a public servant has\n\nacquired any assets in a surreptitious manner without\n\nintimating to his superiors even though required under the\n\nrules, then any income generated from such property will\n\nnot be considered in his favour in view of the aforesaid\n\ndefinition of the known sources of income requiring\n\nintimation thereof. It thus helps immensely in successfully\n\nmaking out a case of disproportionate assets. The\n\nrequirement of timely intimations about the financial\n\ntransactions debars a public servant from claiming any\n\nnew or undisclosed source of income at a subsequent\n\nstage of investigation or trial of a case of disproportionate\n\nassets.\nIt is ironical that no such rules exist for ministers,\n\nMPs, MLAs or other elected representatives who are public\n\nservants now, when almost all other categories of public\n\nservants are subject to such rules. There have been some\n\nvoluntary efforts by some politicians in this direction, e.g.,\n\nthe present Prime Minister asking all ministers and Member\n\nof Parliament of his party to file statements of assets\n\nowned by them and their spouses. However, such efforts\n\nare not sufficient for the simple reason that they are\n\nvoluntary, individual, unorganized and scattered and are\n\nnot binding. There is no legal sanction behind them and\n\nno penalty or disadvantage in the case of default. No\n\nmachinery exists to ensure compliance with them. More\n\noften than not, such efforts remain only on paper and are\n\nbasically meant for the public consumption in the nature of\n\na public relations or image-boosting exercise. They are\n\nmore in the form of noble declarations made at the solemn\n\noccasion of a party coming into power and to be\n\nconveniently forgotten subsequently.\n\nIt is not a mockery that politicians, who never tire of\n\nmaking laws and rules for others, are not governed by any\n\nsuch rules in the important matter of corruption. They\ncontinue to occupy high public offices where scope for\n\ncorruption is definitely higher than any other category of\n\npublic servants, without being governed by any such rules,\n\nwhile almost all other public servants are governed by\n\nsuch rules framed by the same very politicians in the same\n\nvery matter.\n\nIn view of the impending elections to the Parliament\n\nand several State Legislative Assemblies when several\n\npoliticians will be becoming public servants as MPs, MLAs\n\nor ministers, it is high time that detailed rules are framed\n\nwith sufficient legal sanction, either in the form of some\n\nenactment or some rules under the authority of a valid law\n\nsuch as\nRepresentation of People Act\n, to ensure that all\n\nministers, MPs, MLAs, other elected representatives and\n\nother private persons holding posts under statutory bodies,\n\npublic sector undertakings and the like must comply with\n\nthe following requirements:\n\n• File a statement of all properties, assets,\n\nliabilities and sources of income in their own\n\nnames and in the names of their family\n\nmembers at the time of their appointment or\n\nelection to such posts;\n• File regular annual returns during the period of\n\noffice in respect of any changes during the\n\nyear in respect of the aforesaid items;\n\n• Report about big financial transactions (say\n\nabove Rs.1,00,000) within a month to the\n\nauthority to be prescribed in each category of\n\nsuch persons.\n\n• Report about any monetary dealings above a\n\nparticular limit to be prescribed with persons\n\nwith whom they have official dealings.\n\n• Report about the employment of any near\n\nrelative under any person or company with\n\nwhom they have official dealings.\n\n• Detailed mechanism needs to be worked out to\n\nensure compliance with such requirements\n\nwith provisions for punitive action in case of\n\nnon-compliance.\n\nIt may be agreed that such requirements will place\n\nunnecessary fetters or cause unnecessary inconvenience to\n\npoliticians as many of them are businessmen or\n\nprofessionals, already having huge assets or sources of\n\nincome and that such detailed reporting may not be\npracticable. Nevertheless, people of this country do\n\ndeserve to know about the assets of those who have\n\nthemselves chosen to be in public life and who would be\n\ngoverning them. Those who chose to be in public service\n\nowe at least this much to the people of this country.\n\nTransparency about the assets of those holding high public\n\noffices may be useful at least for forming public opinion, if\n\nnot for the proof of cases of disproportionate assets\n\nagainst the erring ones. And, who knows, it may go a long\n\nway in curbing corruption in public life whose tentacles are\n\nall pervasive in all walks of life in the country today.\n\n• The All India Services (Conduct) Rule 1968\n\n(Page No.186):\n\n10. Subscriptions.-No member of the Service\n\nshall, except with the previous sanction of the Government\n\nor of such authority as may be empowered by it in his\n\nbehalf ask for, or accept, contributions to or otherwise\n\nassociate himself with the raising of any fund or other\n\ncollections in cash or in kind in pursuance of any object\n\nwhatsoever.\n11. Gifts\n\n11(1) A member of the service may accept gifts\n\nfrom his near relatives or from his personal friends having\n\nno official dealings with them, on occasions such as\n\nwedding, anniversaries, funerals and religious functions\n\nwhen the making of gifts is in conformity with the\n\nprevailing religious and social practice, but he shall make a\n\nreport to the Government if the value of such gift exceeds\n\nRs.5,000/-.\n\nPage No.237: GOVERNMENT OF INDIA'S DECISIONS\n\nUNDER RULE 11:\n\n1. The criteria to decide acceptance of gift my a moS\n\nor his members of the family is whether it is inspired\n\nby his official position: - The main criteria to be followed\n\nin deciding whether a member of the Service or a member\n\nof his family, should be permitted to retain a gift would be\n\nwhether it has been inspired by his official position and\n\nalso whether it is likely to embarrass or influence him,\n\neither immediately or prospectively in the discharge of his\n\nofficial duties.\nPage No.252:\n\n2.1 Since the amount received, by a subscriber from the\n\nchit fund by bid would be more than the amount\n\nsubscribed by him and the difference will have to be made\n\ngood by him by future subscriptions upto the total period\n\nof the chit fund, the amount received in such case would\n\namount to loan received from the chit fund company.\n\nSince the chit fund company is not a banking company and\n\nthe provisions of the\nBanking Regulations Act\n1949 are not\n\ntherefore, applicable to such companies, a member of the\n\nService has to obtain permission of the Government under\n\nproviso to sub-rule(4) of rule 16 of the All India Services\n\n(Conduct) Rule, 1968 for receiving the money from the\n\nchit fund companies in such cases. As regards (ii) if the\n\namount received from the chit fund exceeds Rs.2,000 a\n\nmember of the Service has to report to the Government\n\nunder sub-rule (4) of the rule 16 ibid because the amount\n\nreceived by him would not be exclusively the amount\n\nsubscribed by him but would also include the commission\n\npayable by the chit fund company.\n\n3. As regards (b), a member of the Service need not\n\nobtain prior permission of the Government for taking a life\ninsurance policy. He will have, however, to submit a report\n\nto the Government as laid down below:\n\n(i) A member of the Service should submit a report to the\n\nGovernment while taking an insurance policy if the annual\n\npremium of it exceeds Rs.15,000/-. However, if the annual\n\npremium first determined is less than Rs.15,000/- but on\n\nconversion, it exceeds Rs.15,000/- a report to the\n\nGovernment is necessary at the stage. When he receives\n\nthe sum assured as survival benefit/on maturity of the\n\npolicy he need not submit any report to the Government.\n\n(ii) A member of the Service need not report to the\n\nGovernment while taking an insurance policy annual\n\npremium of which is less than Rs.2,000/-. He should\n\nhowever, submit a report to the Government as the time\n\nof receiving the sum assured as survival benefit/on\n\nmaturity of the policy.\n\n4. As regards (c) while fixed deposits in a bank or\n\ndeposits in a Savings Bank account made by a member of\n\nthe service from out of his salary or accumulated savings\n\nwould not come within the scope of sub-rule(2), it would\n\nbe necessary for the member of the service to report to\n\nthe Government all purchase of Postal or National Savings\nCertificates exceeding 15 Rs.2,000 in value, from such\n\naccumulated Savings.\n\nService Law Dictionary (Page No.24):\n\nAnnual return of immovable property. An\n\ninformation regarding the immovable property owned or\n\nheld on lease by an employee in his own name or in the\n\nname of anyone else, as on the last day of the period to\n\nwhich the return relates. Such a return is generally\n\nprescribed in respect of the public servants who are high\n\nup in the hierarchy or where the nature of their duties\n\nthrown chances of corruption. The purpose is to keep in\n\ntouch with the financial status of the employee and also to\n\nensure a check on corruption. The accumulation of assets\n\ndisproportionate to one's known source of income is an\n\noffence of criminal misconduct under\nSec.13(1)(e)\nof the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988, punishable under\n\nSec.13(2)\n.\n\nThe Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964\n\nprescribe such returns for Group 'A' and 'B' officers in\n\ngeneral [Rule 18(1)(ii)]. In addition, the Government has\n\nreserved its right to call for a special return in respect of\n\nboth movable and immovable property from any\nGovernment servant whenever they consider it appropriate\n\n[Rule 18(4)].\n\nTHE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT, 1988 - BY\n\nMALIK'S COMMENTARY (page No.480,\nSection 13\n)\n\nIn State of Maharashtra v. Ishwar, A.I.R.1996 SC\n\n722, the Court was concerned with the question as to\n\nwhen opportunity of satisfactory account should be given\n\nto the accused. The Supreme Court said that this\n\nopportunity of satisfactorily explaining about his assets and\n\nresources is before the Court when the trial commenced\n\nand not at earlier stage. The Court said the finding that\n\nprinciple of natural justice had been violated as no\n\nopportunity was given before the registration of the case,\n\nwould be unwarranted. This was a case arising under\n\nSec.5(1)(e)\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The\n\npresent provision of\nSec.13(1)(e)\nof the new Act is parallel\n\nto the provisions. These observations of the Supreme\n\nCourt go against the contention of the counsel for the\n\npetitioner that there should be investigative trial by the\n\ninvestigating officer. In this context, it is significant to note\n\nthat the words in clause (e) of\nSection 13(1)\nof the Act \"if\n\nhe or any person on his behalf is in possession or has\"\nclearly suggest that if any person is in possession of assets\n\nor pecuniary resources on behalf of the public servant, that\n\nwould be included in his assets, in the sense that he would\n\nhave to account for these assets also. In this context the\n\nprosecution could prove that what is being held by another\n\nperson is in fact being held on behalf of public servant i.e.\n\nhe is the real source of that financial or pecuniary\n\nacquisition by the other persons. Mere declaration in\n\nincome tax return of the other person when the income tax\n\nofficer does not challenge the source of pecuniary\n\nresources could itself hardly provide a defence, at least the\n\nprosecution is free to prove that these resources were held\n\nfor the accused and he was the real source of acquisition\n\nof those assets. The prosecution cannot be debarred from\n\nproving those facts merely on the ground that the other\n\npersons declared those assets in his income tax returns.\n\nThere is no such interpretation of the law.\n\nVALUATION OF BUILDINGS:\n\nThe Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant\n\nsubmits that the valuation made by the Engineers of the\n\nPWD Department is highly inflated. The rate of OTIS Lift\n\nwas checked in the spencers. He further submits that the\ncost of the marbles and granites are assessed at a very\n\nexorbitant value. The Engineers of the PWD, Government\n\nof TamilNadu have not taken the sample marble and\n\ngranites and called for tenders as to what as the rate of\n\nthose marble/granites. Even the Forest Officers have not\n\nbeen examined to evaluate the cost of the wood. Nobody\n\nhas certified that the wood used is a high quality teak\n\nwood. He further submits that the trial court has simply\n\nreduced the cost of construction to the extent of 20%.\n\nThis is based on guess work. He relies on Ex.D210.\n\nEx.D210 reads as under:\n\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA\nTHE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX\nCENTRAL CIRCLE-II(2)\n108, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Chennai-600034\n\nGIR No.701/95-96 & 96-97 :044-8268610/828201\n\nextension 7025\n\nDated 10th December 1999\n\nTo,\n\nThe Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals),\nCentral-II\nChennai-34.\n\nSir,\n\nSub: Assessment in the case of Miss.

As per the evidence on record, the value of\n\nconstruction for 207 sq.ft i.e., 2.07 squares is Rs.65,371/-.\n\nTherefore, for one square, cost of construction is\n\napproximately Rs.31,580/-. During the cross-examination\n\nof PW107-Sornam at page No.9, paper book page No.225\n\nof Volume-4, he clearly admits that there are two methods\n\nto find building value. The detailed estimate and per\n\nsquare foot method are the two ways. In this case, we\n\nhave adopted the per square foot method. In the instant\ncase, total constructed area is 1,66,839 sq. ft. Now the\n\nquestion that arises for my consideration is, what is the\n\nrate that has to be assessed for construction of one square\n\ni.e., 10x10= 100 sq.ft. As stated earlier, the Public Works\n\nDepartment fixes the rate reasonably at the higher rate,\n\ntaking into consideration of delayed payment and other\n\nmiscellaneous expenses and in case, if the contractor\n\nborrows loan from the bank, the interest that is charged on\n\nit is taken into consideration while PWD fixes the cost per\n\nsquare. This is reasonably quite higher. The date of\n\nconstruction is during the check period. Therefore,\n\nconsidering the evidence of PW.107 and also Ex.P.645, I\n\nassess the cost of construction for one square may be\n\naround Rs.28,000/- at the relevant period. Normally, it\n\nincludes foundation, bed concrete, plinth area, wall along\n\nwith super structures, windows, doors, lintel, plastering,\n\ninternal painting of doors and windows, flooring,\n\nelectrification, water supply, sanitation, dadoing tiles,\n\nlaying of tiles. Difference amount has to be borne by the\n\nowner in case granites or marbles are laid. Normally, it is\n\nconsidered as extra work in so far as staircase, flagging\n\nconcrete, sump, pump, grill work. The Public Works\nDepartment will have cost included for delay payment and\n\nother miscellaneous expenses. No prudent owner will\n\nagree for construction of a building adopting the PWD\n\nrates. The PWD rates are reasonably high when compared\n\nto the rate charged by the contractor when he constructs a\n\nbuilding adopting the method of square rate.\n\nThe total area constructed by the Accused Nos.1, 2,\n\n3, 4, firms, companies is as under:\n\nSl.

Now the question that arises for my\n\nconsideration is what is the rate that has to be assessed\n\nfor construction of a square [10 x 10] = 100 sq. feet. As\n\nstated earlier, the Public Works Department fixes the rate\n\nreasonably at the higher rate taking into consideration of\n\ndelayed payment and other miscellaneous expenses to the\n\ncontractor. As stated earlier, as per PWD itself, the\n\nconstruction cost per square will be Rs.31,580.19/-. This is\n\nreasonably quite higher. The date of construction is during\n\nthe check period. The construction rate per square may be\n\nsomewhere around Rs.28,000/-.\n\nIn the instant case, Team of Engineers inspected\n\nseveral buildings and they valued the buildings. PW.107\n\nwho is Superintendent Engineer, PWD, has deposed that\nthere are two methods to find building value, detailed\n\nestimate and per square foot are two ways. Though\n\nseveral Engineers have inspected the buildings mentioned\n\nin the annexures and the valuation report have been\n\nprepared, in some valuation not all the Engineers who\n\ninspected the buildings have affixed their signatures.\n\nSome of the Engineers who valued the reports have been\n\nexamined as defence witnesses. Though there are about\n\n14 Engineers who inspected the building and prepared the\n\nvaluation report, when they entered into witness box,\n\nexcept marking documents they have not spoken anything\n\nabout measurement of the floor area where marbles and\n\ngranites are laid. The measurement relevant to this has\n\nnot been furnished by them while giving evidence.\n\nI have carefully examined the exhibits and ascertain\n\nthe square feet even though it is mentioned in square\n\nmeters. The Engineers who gave evidence before the\n\nCourt have not stated as to what was the square feet of\n\nthe building, how many square feet marbles has been laid,\n\nhow many square feet granite have been laid. The\n\nvaluation report relating to laying of granites and marble\n\nstones on the floor do not prove themselves. The facts\nmentioned therein have to be proved by evidence after\n\ngiving opportunity to opposite parties to contest the\n\ncorrectness of such evidence by cross examination. It is\n\nwell settled that the documents do not themselves prove\n\nthe contents therein. The proof of contents have to be\n\ngiven by cogent evidence. In the instant case, Engineers\n\nwho have deposed before the Court have omitted to state\n\nthe measurement of the buildings, measurement of the\n\narea of laying granites and marbles. They simply stated\n\nthat highest quality of granites, marbles, sanitary fittings,\n\nelectrical fittings were installed. The samples of marbles\n\nand granites were not extracted and no quotations have\n\nbeen sought from the granite suppliers. Everything\n\nassessed is done more or less on guesswork rather than\n\nactual price prevailing during the check period. There is\n\npositive evidence to the effect that the sanitary\n\nequipments used are of jacquard make and granite and\n\nmarbles are more or less of the cost of Rs.70 to Rs.100 per\n\nsquare feet. I have adopted the method of determining\n\nthe valuation on the square feet method as stated by\n\nPW.107. I have calculated price of 1 square at the rate of\n\nRs.28,000/- towards cost of construction and for extra\nwork it is valued separately. Accordingly, I have calculated\n\nthe cost of construction as under:\n\nSl. AMOUNT\nNo. PARTICULARS\n1. Construction cost for 1668.39 Rs.4,67,13,800/-\nsquares @ Rs.28,000/- during\nthe check Period amounts to\n2. Cost of marbles/granites Rs. 25,66,200/-\nInterior decorations\n3. Architect fees/sanction plan Rs. 9,65,060/-\nExtra work charges:\n\n4. Staircase, sump, overhead Rs. 40,000/-\ntank\n\n5. OTIS Lift Rs. 15,000/-\n\n6 Air Conditioners Rs. 7,54,000/-\n\nTOTAL Rs.5,10,54,060/-\n\nMARRIAGE EXPENDITURE:\n\nIn respect of Marriage Expenses, the following\n\nprosecution witnesses were examined, they speak as\n\nunder:\n\nPW.181 - Thangarajan, Assistant Engineer, Building\n\nConstruction-3, Sub-division-II, Chennai.

DW.41 - K.Seetharaman,\n\nTreasurer for Mylapur Area of AIADMK Party, has deposed\n\nthat he himself and other office bearers have collected\n\nRs.50,000/- and handed over the K.R.V.Ramani and Party\n\nArea Secretary for Mylapur. Similarly, DW.42 -\n\nP.S.Annamalai, DW.43 - V.Kothandaraman and DW.77 -\n\nK.R.V.Ramani have deposed that they all are members of\n\nAll India Anna DMK Party and they were contributed\n\nmoney to the expenses of the marriage of A-3 -\n\nV.N.Sudhakaran.\n\nAccused No.1 was a Chief Minister of Tamilnadu.\n\nWhen marriage of A-3 was performed, she was also the\n\nGeneral Secretary of All India Anna DMK Party. Her role\n\nwas in dual capacity. Bride was none other than the grand\n\ndaughter of the famous Cine Actor Shivaji Ganesan. DW.1\n- Ramkumar has stated in his evidence that he has spent\n\nabout Rs.92,00,000/- for the performance of the marriage.\n\nHe was also produced the extract of SB Account No.95071,\n\nState Bank of India, Gopalpuram Branch. The material\n\nwitness - the father of the bride, Narayanaswamy has not\n\nbeen examined. He was a proper person to speak about\n\nthe marriage expenses of his daughter. The prosecution\n\nhas not been examined him. No plausible explanation is\n\nforthcoming as to why he was not examined. He was\n\nworking as a Professor in Indian Institute of Technology,\n\nChennai. The material evidence has been withheld by the\n\nprosecution. The prosecution's case is that accused No.1\n\nhas spent all the expenses pertaining to marriage. The\n\nversion of accused No.1 is that she has spent about\n\nRs.28,67,520/- for the marriage. It is a customary\n\npractice that normally expenses of the marriage will be\n\nborne by the bride's family. Even the bride's family are\n\nalso financially sound. The expenditure relating to\n\nmarriage will be of both verifiable expenditure and non-\n\nverifiable expenditure. Verifiable expenditure can be\n\nascertained by investigation. It is difficult to ascertain\n\nnon-verifiable expenditure. In this case, the bride's family\nhave stated that they incurred expenditure pertaining to\n\nmarriage. A-1 was a General Secretary of AIADMK Party.\n\nThere is a positive evidence that members of the All India\n\nAnna DMK Party also made some arrangements for the\n\nmarriage and they themselves have claimed that they\n\nhave spent some amount towards the marriage,\n\nvoluntarily. In the absence of the evidence of the bride's\n\nfather, A-1 has furnished a statement before the Income-\n\ntax department to their questionnaire stating that she has\n\nspent Rs.28,67,520/- towards the marriage, party workers\n\nspending some amount towards marriage, I am of the\n\nopinion that the liability of the marriage of A-3 by A-1 to\n\nA-4 is to the extent of Rs.28,68,000/-.\n\nLearned Special Public Prosecutor, Sri. B.V. Acharya,\n\nin his written arguments has mentioned that Accused Nos.\n\n1 to 4, firms have acquired about 306 properties.\n\nEvidence, material placed on record disclose that the value\n\nof the properties range from Rupees Ten Thousand to\n\nLakhs. But, Accused Nos. 1 to 4, firms and companies\n\nhave borrowed loan more than Rs.24 Crores. This loan\n\nhas been utilized for acquiring the immovable properties,\n\nnamely, agricultural lands, sites etc. Borrowing loan from\nthe Nationalized Banks and acquiring the properties is not\n\nan unlawful activity.\n\nThe Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption has\n\ninflated the value of assets to the extent of Rs.91,34,568/-\n\nSince these assets have been inflated by the Director of\n\nVigilance and Anti Corruption, some of the items left out\n\nwhile valuing the construction will be adjusted.\n\nLearned Special Public Prosecutor, Sri. B.V. Acharya,\n\nsubmits that the sole prosecuting agency is State of\n\nKarnataka in the appeals and the prosecutor validly\n\nappointed by the State of Karnataka has to be heard. In\n\nthe present appeals, State of Karnataka which is a sole\n\nprosecuting agency has not been made as a party.\n\nThough this appeal was heard for nearly more than\n\nfour months, inspite of it, the Government of Karnataka\n\nhas not taken steps either to appoint Special Public\n\nProsecutor even though the State of Karnataka was a\n\ntransferee court. This case arises out of private complaint\n\nand subsequently even Director of Vigilance and Anti\n\nCorruption registered a crime in Tamil Nadu during the\n\ncourse of the trial which was conducted in Tamil Nadu. At\nthat stage, this matter was transferred from the High\n\nCourt judicature of Madras to the High Court of Karnataka\n\nso that trial of the case may be conducted fairly. Since\n\nthis criminal case was transferred from Tamil Nadu, the\n\ntransferee State is the party. That being the case, as soon\n\nas criminal case was disposed of by the learned Special\n\nJudge, criminal appeals were preferred by the Accused\n\nbefore this Court. At that time, only State of Karnataka\n\nshould have been diligent in appointing Special Public\n\nProsecutor, but it has not done so. Even at the stage of\n\nhearing of the appeal for nearly four months, State of\n\nKarnataka has not taken steps to appoint Special Public\n\nProsecutor to conduct the proceedings. On the other\n\nhand, contention of the State of Karnataka is that they are\n\nnot made as parties. There was an observation by this\n\nCourt for the appearance of the learned Advocate General.\n\nAccordingly, he appeared before the Court and made\n\nsubmission that he will give accommodation to the Special\n\nPublic Prosecutor Sri.Bhavani Singh. Even during that\n\ntime, the learned Advocate General did not mention about\n\nthe accused not making Government of Karnataka as a\n\nparty. On the other hand, Sri.B.V.Acharya, learned Special\nPublic Prosecutor has urged the contention that the appeal\n\nis not maintainable, since the Government of Karnataka is\n\nnot made as a party. When the State of Karnataka is\n\naware of hearing of these appeals and daily media reports\n\nabout this case, pleading ignorance by the State of\n\nKarnataka and taking up contention that it is not\n\nmaintainable is not sustainable. Besides, it is a curable\n\nirregularity which can be cured at any stage. In that view\n\nof the matter, contention of learned Special Public\n\nProsecutor that the appeals are not maintainable has no\n\nforce and cannot be accepted.\n\nOne of the contentions raised by learned Special\n\nPublic Prosecutor is with regard to criminal conspiracy and\n\nacquisition of assets. In this regard, prosecution relies on\n\nevidence of PW.94 - R.Lakshminarayanan who speaks\n\nabout registration of firms and companies and PW.159-\n\nRajagopalan who speaks about registration of documents\n\nat the residence of Accused No.1 at Chennai. According to\n\nthe prosecution, this part of the case has been satisfactory\n\nestablished by leading clinching substantial evidence.\nIt is not prudent to expect direct evidence in this\n\naspect and the same is only by way of substantial\n\nevidence. Accused Nos. 1 to 4 were residing together at\n\nPoes Garden. No doubt, it is the contention of learned\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor that since the registration was\n\ndone at the residence of Accused No.1 and Accused Nos. 1\n\nto 4 were residing together in the same residential\n\npremises, registration of documents at the residence is not\n\nillegal. Contention at paragraph-20 of the written\n\narguments indicates more than Rs.20 Crores have been\n\npaid towards price of these properties is not borne out\n\nfrom the records or evidence. Contention of learned\n\nSenior Counsel that more than Rs.20 Crores immovable\n\nproperties have been purchased and sale deeds has been\n\nexecuted has no force since it is the borne out from the\n\nrecords that total amount mentioned in the sale deeds is\n\nabout Rs.6,24,09,120/-. Therefore, there is no force in the\n\ncontention of learned Senior Counsel.\n\nIn so far as marriage expenses are concerned,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel supports the impugned Judgment\n\nand submits that the trial court has validly reduced the\n\nexpenses to the extent of Rs.3 Crores.\nThis court after examining evidence and also\n\ndocuments has come to the conclusion that Accused No.1\n\ncannot be saddled with the entire marriage expenses. As\n\nstated earlier, according to Hindu Customs, it is bride's\n\nfather and their family members who perform the marriage\n\nand they bear the marriage expenses. Besides, there will\n\nbe non verifiable expenditure. Such being the case, it is\n\ndifficult to accept submission of learned Senior Counsel in\n\nthis aspect.\n\nThough it is contended by learned Senior Counsel\n\nthat income of Accused is Rs.9,34,26,053.56/-, but from\n\nthe evidence available and material on record, it is crystal\n\nclear that Accused Nos. 1 to 4, firms and companies have\n\nborrowed loans to the tune of Rs.24,17,31,274/-. Such\n\nbeing the case, this amount has lost sight of by the\n\nprosecution. The Investigating Agency has also not\n\ninvestigated in this regard. It appears that the\n\nInvestigating Agency has deliberately omitted to\n\ninvestigate in this aspect and narrate the same in the\n\npolice papers. Therefore, the contention of learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the State with regard to the income of the\n\nAccused has no force and the same cannot be accepted.\nThe written arguments filed by third party Intervenor\n\nonly relies upon evidence of the prosecution witnesses and\n\nalso supports the impugned Judgment of the Trial Court\n\nand also they have given tabular form with regard to\n\nadditional construction and they point out certain\n\nirregularities while registering the documents and also\n\nunder valuation. This aspect will be taken care of by the\n\nconcerned authorities under the law relating to this rather\n\nthan the provision of offence of criminal misconduct. This\n\nirregularity or discrepancy cannot lend support to the\n\noffence of criminal misconduct envisaged under\nsection\n[1][e] of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n.\n\nSri.B.V.Acharya, learned Special Public Prosecutor\n\nrelied on PW.159, who speaks about the registration of 90\n\ndocuments. The consideration amount of these sale deeds\n\nworks out approximately to Rs.3,20,72,380/-. No doubt,\n\nthe Sub-Registrar - PW.159 has visited the house of A-1\n\nfor registering the properties nearly 20-25 times. Just\n\nbecause, PW.159 visits the house of A-1 in connection with\n\nregistering the properties, that itself is not a material to\n\nbring home the guilt of the accused. Law permits the Sub-\n\nRegistrar to visit the residential houses to register the\ndocuments. Even if there is an undervaluation, the\n\nconcerned department has to take action under the law\n\nrelating to undervaluation. Even if there is non-compliance\n\nof\nIncome Tax Act\nof furnishing Tax Clearance Certificate,\n\nthe concerned Income Tax Authorities will initiate action\n\nagainst the concerned. These things cannot be taken into\n\nconsideration for bringing home of the offence of criminal\n\nmisconduct. In this case, there is a positive evidence to\n\nthe effect that Rs.24,17,31,274/- has been borrowed loans\n\nfrom the Nationalised Banks by A-1 to A-4, Firms and\n\nCompanies. This is a lawful source of income. From the\n\nevidence on record, it reveals that this amount has been\n\nutilized for acquiring the immovable properties. There is\n\nno evidence to show that ill-gotten wealth of A-1 has been\n\nparted to A-2 to A-4, Firms and Companies to acquire\n\nthese immovable properties. The prosecution has not\n\nshown the loan borrowed by accused Nos.1 to 4, Firms and\n\nCompanies. Therefore, the prosecution has not established\n\nthe offence of abetment and criminal conspiracy.\n\nLOANS AS INCOME\n\nPW.259 has positively stated in his evidence that\n\naccused Nos.1 to 4 and firms and companies have\nborrowed huge loans. Even I have carefully examined the\n\ndocuments and it is found that evidence of one PW.182 -\n\nArunachalam reveals that Accused Nos. 1 to 4 and firms\n\nand have borrowed Rs.7,35,46,000/-. Besides, Accused\n\nhave also borrowed loan from private parties. Those loans\n\nhave not been taken into consideration. Ex.D196 discloses\n\nthat Indian Bank has granted loan of Rs.84,07,172/-. The\n\nassessee advanced loan of Rs.58,66,500/-. The following\n\nare loans availed from Accused and firms and companies.\n\nAccused No.3 - Rs. 29,98,500\nJ. Farm House - Rs. 6,00,000\nMeadow Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd., - Rs. 2,00,000\n\nSasi Enterprises - Rs. 2,00,000\n\nBharani Beach Resorts - Rs. 41,35,000\n\nLex Property Development\nPvt. Ltd., from Kalyani\nConstructions - Rs.1,57,00,000\n\nIndo Doha Company was advanced loan of Rs.1 Crore from\nMagantha Investments.\n\nPW.211 - P.N. Venkatesh speaks about Rs.34 lakhs loan to\n\nAccused No.4. PW.160 speaks about grant loan of Rs.1.50\n\nCrores sanctioned to Jaya Publications. PW.176 speaks\n\nabout grant loan of Rs.1.50 Crores from Indian Bank to\n\nTansi Enterprises. PW.182 also speaks about sanction of\n\nloan. However, I have considered the loan only borrowed\nby the Nationalized Banks. The loan borrowed by the\n\nAccused Nos. 1 to 4 and firms companies are as under:\n\n1 Ex.P1027 OMTL-Indian Bank, Rs.1,50,00,000.00\nJaya Publications\n2 Ex.P1101 Agricultural\nM.D.Loan, Indian\nBank, Guna\nBhushani. On\nrequest of Guna\nBhushani, they Rs.3,75,00,000.00\nchanged the loan\nliability to A2, A3\nand A4 since they\nbecame the share\nholders.\n\n3 Ex.P1114 Indian Bank- A1 Rs. 90,00,000.00\n4 Ex.P1162 Indian Bank J.Real Rs. 25,00,000.00\nEstate\n5 Ex.P1172 Indian Bank Rs. 12,46,000.00\nJ.S.Housing\n6 Ex.P1211 Indian Bank, J farm Rs. 50,00,000.00\nhouse\n7 Ex.P1260 Indian Bank- Sasikala Rs. 25,00,000.00\n\n8 Ex.P1330 Indian Bank- Rs.1,57,00,000.00\nV.N.Sudhakaran\n9 Ex.P1354 Ramaraj Agro Mill Ltd Rs.1,65,00,000.00\n\nEx.P1357 Indian Bank- Rs. 17,85,274.00\n10 Mahalakshmi\nKalyanamandapa\nTotal Rs.24,17,31,274.00\n\nOut of the loan amount of Rs.24,17,31,274/-, a sum\n\nof Rs.5,99,85,274/- is deducted to the income assessed by\n\nDirector of Vigilance and Anti Corruption. After deducting\n\nthis amount, the balance loan amount remains as\n\nRs.18,17,46,000/-.\nINCOME FROM GRAPE GARDEN:\n\nIn so far as the income from the Grape Garden is\n\nconcerned, no doubt Income tax returns have been filed\n\nbelatedly, but that itself will not be a ground to reject the\n\nincome from the Grape Garden. Even in the earlier\n\nreturns, income from the Grape Garden has been\n\nmentioned. Though the prosecution disputes about the\n\nincome from the Grape Garden, Income Tax returns filed\n\nby the assessee and also after a detailed enquiry by the\n\nIncome Tax Authority have come to a conclusion that there\n\nis an income from the Grape Garden to the extent of\n\nRs.52,50,000/-. A portion of the income has been\n\nincluded in the Annexures filed along with the charge\n\nsheet, deducting that amount from the agricultural\n\nincome/Grape Garden is Rs.46,71,600/-.\n\nGIFTS AS INCOME:\n\nIn so far as gift items are concerned, the Accused\n\nNo.1 has claimed that she has received a sum of\n\nRs.2,15,00,000/-. Accused No.1 has performed marriage\n\nof her foster son Accused No.3 and during her birthday she\n\nreceived gifts from the party workers, friends, well wishers\n\netc. She has also filed income tax returns to that effect\nbefore the Income Tax Authorities. No doubt, there is\n\ndelay in submitting the income tax returns. That has been\n\naccepted by the Income tax authorities. Besides, there\n\nwas a marriage function of foster son of Accused No.1 and\n\nalso her birthday. In Tamilnadu, there is practice of giving\n\ngifts to political leaders on their birthdays. She has also\n\nclaimed foreign remittance of Rs.77 lakhs. Taking into\n\nconsideration all these aspects, in my view, the income\n\nthat arises from the gifts in my estimation will be around\n\nRs.1,50,00,000/-.\n\nSASI ENTERPRISES\n\nPW.113 has spoken about the rent derived from the\n\nshops given on rent from Sasi Enterprises.\n\nSasi Enterprises carried out fax, Xerox, STD, printing\n\nof building plan works.

When you subscribe,\n\nthere will be some discounts. The subscription schemes\n\nare set-up for raising money. The payment or promise of\n\npayment for consecutive issues of magazine, newspaper,\n\nbooks etc. over a specified period of time.\n\nNamadhu MGR is one of the components of the Jaya\n\nPublications. In this background, Namadhu MGR scheme\n\nwas introduced in the year 1990, to improve the circulation\n\nof newspaper i.e. Subscription Deposit Scheme. This is\n\none of component of Jaya Publications.\n\nDW.88 - K.Soundravelan, Chartered Accountant\n\nspeaks about this scheme. He has deposed that there was\n\nan option of depositing an amount ranging from\n\nRs.12,000/- - Rs.15,000/- - Rs.18,000/-. There were\n\nabout 9,000 subscribers. Depending upon the amount of\n\ndeposit of the subscribers, they will get 4, 5 or 6 free\n\ncopies of newspaper every day. The concerned subscriber\n\ncould get the deposit amount by giving 15 days prior\n\nnotice. There was a scrutiny of the account of the\nassessee - Jaya Publication for the years 1991 to 1996.\n\nI.T. authorities had required the assessee to produce the\n\nlist of the subscribers of the above mentioned deposit\n\nscheme. The said lists were produced by the assessee.\n\nI.T. authorities segregated the names of the assessees\n\ndistrict wise and sent the district wise list to the respective\n\ndistrict I.T. authorities for verification. In turn, the\n\nrespective Income Tax Officers of the District summoned\n\nthe subscribers and recorded their statements.\n\nDW.88 has deposed that the accused have produced\n\nlist of subscribers of deposit with their names and address\n\nand also the amounts subscribed for the assessment years\n\n1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97.\n\nThe said list comprises of six books and they are at\n\nEx.D229(1) to Ex.D229(6). The assessing officer did not\n\naccept the returns filed by the accused. Feeling aggrieved\n\nby the same, the accused - assessee preferred appeals\n\nbefore the Commissioner of Income Tax Appeal, Central -\n\nII in I.T. Appeal No.144/2001-02. The Appellate Authority\n\naccepted the case of the assessee regarding the scheme\n\ndeposit collection as per Ex.D232 - Order, dated\n\n28.3.2002. This Ex.D232 relates to the Assessment year\n1991-92. Similarly, Assessing Officer rejected the claim of\n\nthe assessee, against that order, the assessee preferred\n\nI.T. Appeal No.142/2001-02 before the Commissioner of\n\nIncome Tax Appeal, Circle-II. Similarly, Assessment\n\nOfficer rejected the returns of the assessee of the\n\nassessment years 1994-95 to 1996-97. The Assessing\n\nOfficer partially allowed the claim made by the assessee in\n\nrespect of the Deposit Scheme. Feeling aggrieved by the\n\npartial allowance of the claim in respect of Deposit\n\nScheme, appeal was preferred before the Commissioner of\n\nIncome Tax Appeal. The Commissioner of Income Tax\n\nAppeal partially accepted the claim of the assessee. As\n\nagainst this order, further appeal was preferred before the\n\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal - B Bench. The Appellate\n\nTribunal passed common order accepting the claim of the\n\nassessee regarding the Deposit Scheme except in respect\n\nof 41 depositors. The total amount received by Jaya\n\nPublication under the above Deposit Scheme from its\n\nsubscribers is Rs.14,23,89,000/-. 16,000 copies of\n\nnewspapers per day were printed in the year 1998.\n\n30,000 copies of newspapers per day were printed in the\n\nyear 1990. 60,000 copies of newspapers per day were\nprinted in the year 1995-96. 70,000 copies of newspapers\n\nper day were printed in the year 1996-97.\n\nDuring the cross-examination of DW.88, he states\n\nthat A-1 and A-2 became partners of M/s. Jaya Publication\n\nin the year 1990. A-2 was looking after the affairs of said\n\nfirms. In between 1990 and 1992, A-1 executed the\n\npower of attorney dated 21.5.1992 in favour A-2 for\n\nlooking after the business of Jaya Publications on her\n\nbehalf. Jaya Publications did not obtain permission for\n\nintroducing interest free Subscribers Deposit Scheme in\n\nrespect of Namadhu MGR newspaper. The said scheme\n\nhas not been registered with any authority. There is no\n\nsuch requirement. He has gone through the terms and\n\nconditions of that scheme. According to Condition No.2 of\n\nthe scheme, subscriber/deposit would receive a free copy\n\nof Namadhu MGR newspaper, but not any interest on the\n\ndeposited amount.\n\nDW.88 at paragraph-47 in his evidence has stated\n\nthat in the Order Ex.D217, there is no mention that\n\nrepresentatives of M/s. Jaya Publications produced the\n\nbooks of account before the special auditors. There is an\n\nobservation in the said order that during the said special\naudit to show receipts through Cash and Bank, but no\n\nsupporting documents were made available. He said that\n\non account of seizure of the documents of M/s.Jaya\n\nPublications by DV & AC those documents could not be\n\nmade available before the special auditors. But in the\n\norder Ex.D217, there is no mention that the said\n\ndocuments could not be made available for the reason that\n\nthey were seized by DV & AC. There is an observation\n\nmade in the para.2 of Annexure-II to Ex.D217 that all\n\npayments made through cash are not supported by any\n\noutside document or evidence and that they are only\n\nsupported by internally made vouchers with payee's\n\nsignature. There is also a further observation in para.3 of\n\nsaid Annexure-II that payments above Rs.500/- are not\n\nstamped as required under\nIndian Stamp Act\n.\n\nIn Ex.D231 is an appeal directed against the\n\nassessment order dated 04.05.2001 passed by the Deputy\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Central Circle - II, Chennai,\n\nunder Section 144 read with\nSection 251\nof the Income\n\nTax Act. The paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 of the order of the\n\nAppellate Court reads as under:\n\"7.2. During the course of appellate\nproceedings before me, the learned counsel\nsubmitted that there were changes in the\nappointment of the authorized representatives.\nTill February 1998, M/s Rajasekar & Co., CAs\nwere the appointed auditors for the appellant\nthereafter M/s. Shanmugham and Muthu, CAs\nwere appointed auditors till they were replaced\nby M/s S. Venkatram & Co., CAs. Because of\nthese frequent changes in the appointment of\nauditors, the correct data, on this issue, could\nnot be collected and, therefore, this issue could\nnot be represented properly in March, 1998,\ni.e., at the time of original assessment\nproceedings. The learned counsel further\nsubmitted that the Appellant has since\nreconciled the list of members of the scheme\nas on 31.3.1991, which consisted of 91\nmembers from whom an aggregate amount of\nRs.13,54,000/- were collected. The complete\ndetails and addresses of these 91 members\nwere already stated to have been filed before\nthe Assessing Officer during the re-assessment\nproceedings. As regards non-mentioning of\nthe scheme deposit in the impounded books of\naccounts, the learned Counsel contended that\nthe impounded books, on the basis of which\nthe Assessing Officer concluded this issue,\nconsisted only of pretty cash books of M/s Jaya\nPublications and M/s NAMADHU MGR; whereas\nthe other records like bank which actually\nreflected the transactions of scheme deposit\nwere not impounded. Thus, in his view, the\nimpounded books in question were incomplete\nand consequently, the conclusion drawn on the\nset of incomplete books would not be correct.\n\nHowever, during the re-assessment\nproceedings, the Appellant had produced the\ncomplete books of accounts, as is evident from\nthe findings recorded by the Assessing Officer\nhimself on page 20 of the assessment order,\nthe relevant portion of which reads thus: In\nthe balance sheet filed the amount of scheme\ndeposit collected was claimed to be\nRs.13,54,000/-. From the verification of the\ncomputerized bank books submitted it is seen\nthat the credits representing alleged scheme\ndeposit collection aggregate to Rs.13,11,200/-\n\nonly. No explanation was given for the\ndifference....' As regards non-production of\n\nthe application forms, the Learned Counsel\nsubmitted that the application forms, counter-\nfoils etc., kept in a cardboard box in Tata\nSumo vehicle parked in a hotel was found\nmissing and a complaint was lodged in the\nPolice in this connection. He further submitted\nthat since the original applications were lost,\nhe produced Photostat copies of the same\nbefore the Assessing Officer. The Learned\nCounsel further contended that the Assessing\nOfficer had thoroughly investigated the\n'scheme deposit' while finalizing the\nassessments for the assessment years 1994-\n\n95, 1996-97, 1997-98 and accepted the\n'scheme' though certain disallowances were\nmade for the reasons stated therein.\n\n7.3. I have carefully considered the\nsubmissions made by the Appellant in the light\nof the facts and circumstances of the case as\nbrought out in the assessment order. I have\nalso perused the list of scheme deposit as on\n31.3.1991 which contained 91 names of the\nsubscribers and the details of dates on which\ntheir deposits were made. I have also gone\nthrough the bank books and the ledger folios\ndetailing the transactions relating to the\nscheme deposit. The reasons for revising the\nclaim of Rs.10,87,067/- to Rs.13,54,000/-\nfrequent changes in the appointment of\nauditors from M/s Rajasekar &Co., CAs to M/s\nShanmugam & Muthu, CAs to M/s\nS.Venkataram & Co., CAs- are found to be\nfactually correct. Since these issues could not\nbe represented properly for want of details\nduring the original assessment proceedings,\nthe assessments for the assessment years\n1991-92 to 1993-94 were set-aside by the\nCommissioner of Income-tax (appeals) vide his\nOrder dated: 15.09.1998. it is well settled that\nwhether certain entries were made or not\nmade, in a particular year of account is totally\nimmaterial and such entries are not decisive or\nconclusive of the matter(\nKedarnath Jute Mfg.\nCo. Ltd.\n's case (1971) 82 ITR 363 (SC). It\nwould appear that in accordance with this\nprinciple, the Appellant was within its rights to\nrevise the claim from Rs.10,87,067/- to\nRs.13,54,000/-. Further, the Learned Counsel\nnever disputed the Assessing Officer's\ncontention that the credits found in the\nimpounded cash books were nothing but the\nsales and advertisements collection of one\ndaily newspaper titled 'Namadhu MGR' but, as\nalready observed, the transactions relating to\nscheme deposit were actually entered in the\nbank book, which was also produced before the\nAssessing Officer, as is evident from his own\nfindings on page 20 of the assessment order.\nAt the cost of repetition, the relevant portion is\nreproduced again: In the balance sheet filed\nthe amount of scheme deposit collected was\nclaimed to be Rs.13,54,000/-. From the\nverification of the computerized bank books\nsubmitted it is seen that the credits\nrepresenting alleged scheme deposit collection\naggregate to Rs.13,11,200/- only. No\nexplanation was given for the difference. A\ncareful reading of this finding shows that the\nAppellant had produced the relevant books of\naccounts in support of the revised claim. It is\npertinent to mention here that when the\nAppellant had actually furnished letters from\n417 subscribers confirming the deposits made\nby them, the Assessing Officer should have\ninitiated further investigation process for\nverifying these deposits transactions, either\nthrough summons or through any other made\nof enquiry, as was done during the proceedings\nfor the assessment years 1994-95, 1996-97\nand 1997-98 earlier. Instead, he has chosen\nto treat the entire scheme deposit as an 'after-\nthought' which, in my opinion, was not a\ncorrect approach. As a matter of fact, scheme\ndeposit is a common issue for all the\nassessment years from 1991-92 to 1998-99,\nand the appeals are pending before me for a\ndecision. In order to adjudicate upon this\nissue, I had requisitioned the assessment\nrecords including the confidential folders (44\nNos.) containing details of investigations made\nby the Assessing Officer. In the context of\nassessment year 1996-97 wherein the\nAppellant had claimed to have collected\nscheme deposits to the extent of\nRs.3,53,37,000/- from 2250 persons, it was\nfound that 41 persons had denied of having\ncontributed any amount towards the said\nscheme. The total amount of deposits claimed\nto have been collected from these 41 persons\namounted to Rs.5,33,000/- out of the total\nclaim of scheme deposits amounting to\nRs.3,53,37,000/. In terms of percentage, it\nworked out to 1.5%. In fact, the Assessing\nOfficer, Shri. G. Gurusamy, assisted me in\nanalyzing the relevant facts. Having regard to\nthe facts and circumstances as brought out in\nthe assessment order and keeping in view the\npercentage of denials to the extent of 1.5%, I\ndeem it appropriate to apply the same\npercentage for the disallowances i.e., 1.5% on\nthe total claim of Rs.13,54,000/- which works\nout to Rs.20,310/- or around sum of\nRs.25,000/-. The Assessing Officer is directed\nto substitute Rs.25,000/- in place of\nRs.13,54,000/-. In the result, the Appellant\ngets a relief of Rs.13,29,000/- (Rs.13,54,000/-\nminus Rs.25,000/-)\".\n\nDW.88 also states in his evidence that in para 11.0\n\nfound in page No.25 of the Order - Ex.D233, there is an\n\nobservation that the learned counsel representing the\n\nassessee inform the Assessing Officer vide his letter dated\n\n23.3.2001 that original lease agreement kept in cardboard\nbags in Tata-Sumo vehicle parked in a hotel was found\n\nmissing and a complaint was lodged with the police in that\n\nconnection.He cannot say as to how many of 9,000\n\nsubscription deposit of subscribers of Namadhu MGR\n\nSubscription Deposit Scheme, has subscribed Rs.18,000/-.\n\nIf he can verify the records and count then he will be in a\n\nposition to tell the number of such depositors and this\n\nwould take considerable time. He had seen all the said\n\n9,000 applications of the subscribers of the said scheme.\n\nHe has not put his initials on the said applications to\n\nindicate that to he has verified each of those applications.\n\nHe denies the suggestion put to him, out of 9,000\n\napplications, more than 5,000 applications were\n\nincomplete. In the application bearing Serial No.144 and\n\nReference No.207 stated to be that of S.Mada Swamy, now\n\nshown to him the place and signature are not visible. He\n\nsaid that this is so on account of passage of time. In the\n\napplication of one J.Padmanabhan at Sl.No.109, there is a\n\nmention of date and signature of the applicant but column\n\nmeant for mentioning the place is left blank.\nNAMADHU MGR - DIVISION OF JAYA PUBLICATION\n\nEvidence referred is DW.88 - K.Soundravelan, Chartered\n\nAccountant.\n\nORDERS OF\nTAX\nCOMMISSIONER\nRETURNS\nYEAR OF INCOME TAX AMOUNT\nIN\n(APPEALS) IN\nEXHIBITS\nEXHIBITS\n1992-93 Ex.D218 EX.D232 68,60,000.00\n1993-94 Ex.D219 Ex.D233 2,23,26,000.00\n1994-95 Ex.D220 Ex.D234 2,07,75,000.00\n1995-96 Ex.D221 Ex.D234 5,57,37,000.00\n1996-97 Ex.D225 - 3,53,37,000.00\nTOTAL 14,10,35,000.00\nLess: 1.5% ordered by the 21,15,525.00\nCommissioner of Income-Tax\n(Appeals)\nAs accepted by the Commissioner 13,89,19,475.00\nof Income-Tax (Appeals)\n\nAs against this, the matter was taken to the High\n\nCourt of Madras, the same is under the judicial\n\nconsideration.\n\nIn so far as the income of the Namadhu MGR - a\n\ncomponent of the Jaya Publications is concerned, there is a\n\npositive evidence to the effect that Income Tax returns\n\nhave been filed very belatedly. No plausible explanation is\n\nforthcoming from the assessee as to why there is delay in\n\nfiling returns. Under the Tax Laws, the burden is on the\n\nassessee to explain the true nature and source of the\nincome. The assessee has to prove that a particular\n\nincome has its origin in the capital amount. Where\n\nremittances were made from non-taxable territory and the\n\nIncome Tax Department established the source, the\n\npresumption that remittances are out of accumulated\n\nprofits arises. Regarding the question as to where from\n\nremittances are made being a matter within the special\n\nknowledge of the assessee, he has to prove that those\n\nremittances are from source other than accumulated\n\nprofits. When the assessee fails to explain the nature of\n\ncash credit entry, the income tax officer may presume that\n\nit falls under income from other sources. The burden of\n\nestablishing that a disputed amount is not assessee's\n\nincome lies on the assessee and not on the department.\n\nWhen an assessee claims exemption he should give\n\ndetailed facts entitling him to exemption as under Section\n\n106, when any fact is specially within the knowledge of\n\nany person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.\n\nIn this case, the Chartered Accountant - DW.88\n\nspeaks about the income of the assessee. It is undisputed\n\nfact that A-1 and A-2 are partners of Jaya Publications.\n\nNamadhu MGR - newspaper is one of the component of\nJaya Publications. In this case, accused Nos.1 and 2 have\n\nnot entered the witness box, even though they claim the\n\nincome from the subscription of the subscribers to the\n\nextent of more than Rs.14 Crores. Besides, there is a\n\ndiscrepancy in the evidence of DW.88. At one point of\n\ntime, assessee takes a contention that the applications\n\nrelating to deposit scheme were missing and a complaint\n\nwas lodged to that effect. Subsequently, in this case,\n\napplications were marked, which were presented before\n\nthe Income Tax Department. As stated earlier, there is a\n\ndelay in filing the returns. It is contention of the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents - prosecution and the General\n\nSecretary, DMK Party that this claim is fictitious claim and\n\nit is an afterthought.\n\nWhen Income Tax returns have not been filed for\n\nmany years, it disentitles the assessee substantially. A\n\ndoubt arises in the genuineness of the Income Tax returns.\n\nBut when it is produced before the Income Tax department\n\nafter a long time and is not produced when its production\n\nwas warranted, it is a suspicious circumstance against the\n\ngenuineness of the claim of the assessee in respect of this\n\nsubscription item i.e. Namadhu MGR. However, in the\ninstant case, DWs.3, 4, 5, 6 , 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,\n\n38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n\n56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, speak about the deposit of\n\namount ranging from Rs.12,000/- to Rs.18,000/- for issue\n\nof Namadhu MGR newspaper. They also state that they\n\nhave presented the applications before the Jaya\n\nPublications. Taking into consideration of the evidence of\n\ndefence witnesses mentioned hereinabove, even if there is\n\na delay in filing the Income Tax returns, this cannot be a\n\nfactor to reject the whole claim of the assessee. The\n\nevidence adduced by the defence will have some force.\n\nThis aspect has to be taken into consideration while\n\nassessing the income spoken by the defence side. Jaya\n\nPublications' activities are Printing text books, Publishing,\n\nReal Estate and Namadhu MGR - newspapers, in my view,\n\na sum of Rs.4,00,00,000/- has to be taken as an income\n\nearned by Jaya Publications.\n\nSUPER DUPER TV PVT.

Abetment is constituted by instigating a person for\n\ncommitting an offence or intentionally hiding a person\n\ncommitting it. Instigation necessarily connotes some\n\nsuggestion or support or stimulation to the commission of\n\nthe act itself. Sometimes, illegal omission also comes\n\nunder the purview of the abetment. Though the\n\nprosecution has adduced evidence, nearly about 259\n\nwitnesses, prosecution mainly relies on registration of 165\n\ndocuments i.e., sale deeds and registration of the\n\ndocuments at the residence of Accused No.1. In the\n\ninstant case, the case of the prosecution is that, Accused\n\nNo.1 has amassed wealth and she has parted with this\n\namount to Accused Nos. 2 to 4 to acquire immovable\nproperties, namely, agricultural lands, sites and 32 firms\n\nand companies. There is a positive evidence to the effect\n\nthat the Accused, firms and companies have borrowed a a\n\nloan in a sum of Rs.24,17,31,274/-. Besides, they also\n\nborrowed loans from private parties. This loan borrowed\n\nby private parties has not been considered by this Court.\n\nHowever, the evidence reveals that this amount has been\n\nutilized for purchase of agricultural lands, sites, firms and\n\ncompanies. Therefore, the question of Accused No.1\n\nabetting for Accused Nos. 2 to 4 for acquiring the\n\nimmovable properties does not arise. Accused Nos. 1 to 4\n\nindividually secured loans from the banks and they have\n\nacquired the properties. Therefore, the charge under\n\nSection 107 read with\nsection 109\nof the Act must fail.\n\nInsofar as criminal conspiracy by Accused Nos. 1 to 4\n\nis concerned, allegation against Accused No.1 is that\n\nAccused No.1 has amassed wealth and it has been parted\n\nto Accused Nos. 2 to 4 to acquire immovable properties\n\nsuch as lands, sites, partnership firms and companies. The\n\nprosecution case is that amassing the wealth and parting\n\nthe amount for Accused Nos. 2 to 4 is illegal act and it is\n\nan illegal agreement. As stated earlier, prosecution has\nrelied on evidence of PW.56 - P.S. Rajaram and PW.76 -\n\nSiva, broker, speak about sale deeds of lands. The Trial\n\nCourt has also relied on evidence of these witnesses and\n\ncame to conclusion that there was abetment as well as\n\nconspiracy to use the ill-gotten wealth for purchase of\n\nimmovable properties and also acquiring the firms and\n\ncompanies. The agreement is gist of the offence.\n\nConspiracy is an inference from circumstances. Since the\n\nconspiracy is often hatched up in utmost secrecy, it is\n\nimpossible to prove the same by direct evidence. Mere\n\nAccused Nos. 2 to 4 living with Accused No.1 does not\n\nitself contemplate offence of conspiracy. Conspiracy\n\nconstrues any combination or agreement between two or\n\nmore persons to do an unlawful act. There must be reason\n\nto believe that there was conspiracy and accused persons\n\nwere members of that conspiracy.\n\nSection 10\nof the Indian Evidence Act deals with\n\nthings said or done by the Conspirator in reference to\n\ncommon desire. This section will come into play only when\n\nCourt is satisfied that there are reasonable ground to\n\nbelieve that two or more persons have conspired together\n\ni.e. to say there must be prima facie evidence. Where\nevidence is only circumstantial, the circumstance in their\n\ntotality must be such as would not only be consistent with\n\nthe guilt of the Accused, but also inconsistent with any\n\nreasonable hypothesis of his innocence. The aspects of\n\ncriminal conspiracy are an agreement to believe an illegal\n\nact. In the present case, evidence on record discloses that\n\nAccused Nos. 2 to 4 have borrowed huge amount and they\n\nhave acquired the immovable properties like agricultural\n\nlands, legal entities. The source of income is lawful.\n\nObject is also lawful. Just because Accused Nos. 2 to 4\n\nstay along with Accused No.1, that itself is not component\n\nwhich the Court can come to the conclusion that Accused\n\nNos. 1 to 4 abetted and conspired and acquired the\n\nproperty in an improper way.\n\nIn the case of\nSONAMATI DEVI AND ANOTHER vs.\n\nTHE STATE\nreported in AIR 1958 PATNA 508 (V 45 C\n\n1262); Head Notes a, b and c read as under:\n\n\"(a) Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance\n(38 of 1944) Ss, 5 (2) 4- Claim under\nS.4\n-\n\nOnus of proof -\n(Evidence Act\n(1872) S.100.\n\n\"The entire scheme of the Ordinance\nshows that evidence has to be adduced by the\nclaimant in support of his case that he has\ninterest in the property attached, and when\nthat evidence has been adduced, it is for the\ncourt to consider whether that evidence was\nsufficient to establish his claim, independent of\nthe question whether any evidence in rebuttal\nhad been adduced by the state. If that\nevidence by itself is not sufficient to establish\nthe claim laid by the claimant, the claim must\nfail, not-withstanding the fact that no evidence\nto the contrary had been led in behalf of the\nstate. (para 4)\nAnno: C.J.I Evi Act, Ss.100-103 N.3\n\n(b) Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance\n(38 of 1944)\nS.2 (2) (a)\n- Date if termination -\n\nAppeal to High Court pending - Date of final\norder of High Court is the date.\n\n(para 5)\n\n(c) Criminal Law Amendment ordinance\n(38 of 1944), Ss.10, 13 - Acquittal by District\nJudge - Effect on attachment.\n\nThe combined effect of Ss. 10 and 13 is\nthat notwithstanding the order of acquittal the\nattachment will continue in full force until the\nDistrict Judge has passed orders in accordance\nwith the provisions of\nS.13\n. Therefore, the\nacquittal of the accused has not the effect of\nterminating the attachment.\n\n(para 6)\"\nThe Court should give a finding in case the accused\n\nis convicted, as to the amount of money or value of other\n\nproperty procured by means of the offence. This would\n\ncomply with the\nSection 12 (1)\nof the Criminal Law\n\nAmendment Ordinance, 1944.\nSection 3\nof the Criminal\n\nLaw amendment Ordinance, 1944 deals with i) the money\n\nor other property procured by means of the offence, ii)\n\nproperty other than the above. Learned District Judge\n\nshould know the amount he is to forfeit. The forfeiture by\n\nthe District Judge under\nSection 13(3)\ncannot be equated\n\nto forfeiture of property which is provided in\nSection 53\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code.\nSection 13(1)\nof the Criminal Law\n\nAmendment Ordinance, 1944 deals with upon the\n\ntermination of any criminal proceedings.\nArticle 20(1)\n\ndeals with the conviction of persons for offences and for\n\nsubjecting them to penalties. It firstly provides that no\n\nperson shall be convicted of any offence except for\n\nviolation of a law in force at the time of the commission of\n\nthe act charged as an offence. Secondly, it provides that\n\nno person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that\n\nwhich might have been inflicted under the law in force at\n\nthe time of the commission of the offence. Notice of the\ninterim order should be given to the concerned parties.\n\nThe court should indicate the money or value of the\n\nproperty obtained by means of the said offence.\nSection\nof the Ordinance lays down that criminal court\n\nconvicting the accused shall record finding as to the\n\namount of money or value of other property procured by\n\nthe accused by means of the offence. It is at the end of\n\nthe trial only the court will be in a position to evaluate the\n\nmoney or other property procured by the accused by\n\nmeans of the offence. No specific provision was made for\n\ndetermination by the court of the illegal profits and other\n\ngains obtained by the accused from the properties\n\nacquired by him by bribery or corruption. The court will\n\ndetermine to what extent the assets are disproportionate\n\nand to this extent only the assets are liable for\n\nconfiscation. Till this stage, it cannot be said with certainty\n\nas to which portion of the property under attachment is\n\nliable for confiscation. The combined effect of\nSections 10\n\nand\nis that notwithstanding the order of acquittal the\n\nattachment will continue in full force until the District\n\nJudge has passed the orders in accordance with the\nprovisions of\nSection 13\n. Therefore, acquittal of the\n\naccused has no effect of terminating the attachment.\n\nThe attachment will be in force and continue in force\n\nuntil orders as provided by\nSections 10\nand\nof Criminal\n\nLaw Amendment Ordinance (38 of 1944) are passed by the\n\nDistrict Judge.\n\nThe power to confiscate can be exercised only with\n\nrespect to the property which was actually used in\n\ncommission of offence. One of the contentions raised by\n\nlearned Counsel for the appellants is that no notice have\n\nbeen served on the companies and firms, therefore\n\nconfiscation is bad in law. Parties interested have not\n\nbeen heard. The learned Sessions Judge cannot straight\n\naway confiscate the property without giving a hearing to\n\nthe interested parties.\n\nStatement recorded under sections 161 and 162 can\n\nbe looked into during the trial and enquiry. The question\n\nof confiscation arises only after conclusion of trial. Even\n\nstatement of accused or witnesses can be looked into for\n\ndisposal of the property which takes place at the\n\nconclusion of the enquiry or trial of the case. It is well\nsettled that an order of confiscation without holding an\n\nenquiry is illegal. While disposing of the property, reasons\n\nfor choosing a particular mode should be stated. The court\n\nshould give a finding that in case the Accused is convicted\n\nfor an amount of money or value of property procured by\n\nhimself as an offence, then only there will be compliance of\n\nsection 12\n[1] of Criminal Law [Amendment] Ordinance,\n\n1944.\n\nThe Trial Court should know what amount of the\n\nAccused has to forfeit. At the first instance, property will\n\nbe attached. The Anti Corruption and Investigating Agency\n\nmade an application for attachment of the property.\n\nSubsequently, after conclusion of the trial, the property in\n\nquestion was confiscated. I understand that there are\n\nseveral miscellaneous first appeals filed before this Court\n\nwith regard to attachment. Therefore, I do not want to\n\nexpress any opinion with regard to attachment. Even in\n\ncase if there is acquittal of the Accused, it will not have the\n\neffect of terminating the attachment. However, since no\n\nnotice have been issued to the Accused, the Trial Court has\n\nnot considered the statement of witnesses and also the\n\nstatement of the accused and also the evidence placed on\nrecord. The Trial Court has failed to appreciate the\n\nevidence in a proper perspective. The immovable\n\nproperties were acquired by borrowing huge loan from the\n\nNationalised Banks. It is difficult to infer that the\n\nproperties were acquired by means of ill-gotten money.\n\nTherefore, in my view, confiscation of the properties by the\n\nTrial Court is not sustainable in law.\n\nDr. Subramanian Swamy filed a private complaint\n\nbefore the Principal Sessions and District Judge, Chennai in\n\nMiscellaneous Petition No.3238/1996 which was registered.\n\nAfter registration of the crime, exercising the power under\n\nsection 210\nof Cr.PC, both private complaint and the\n\ncomplaint instituted under the Police report were clubbed.\n\nAccused No.1 was arrayed as Accused in the First\n\nInformation Report. Though names of Accused Nos. 2 to 4\n\nwere mentioned in the first information report, they were\n\nnot arrayed as Accused. Benami transaction was also\n\nalleged in the first information report. But, the\n\ninvestigating agency did not file charge sheet for benami\n\ntransaction. The provision under\nsection 13\n[1][e] of the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nconnotes if he or any other\n\nperson on his behalf is in possession or clearly suggests\nthat any person to have resources on behalf of the public\n\nservant that would be included in his assets, in the sense\n\nthat, he would have to account to these assets also. So\n\nthe prosecution mainly relies on\nsections 13\n[1][a] and\n\n13[1][e] of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n. The charge\n\nsheet was filed against Accused Nos. 1 to 4. The\n\nallegation is that the Accused No.1 amassed wealth and\n\nAccused Nos. 2 to 4 purchased various properties. But,\n\nthe prosecution has not adduced any evidence to the effect\n\nthat Accused No.1 instigated or conspired together with\n\nAccused Nos. 2 to 4 to acquire lands and immovable\n\nproperties. The prosecution mainly relies on evidence of\n\nthe Sub-Registrar and brokers and also the sale deeds.\n\nExcept marking the sale deeds, there is no other evidence.\n\nThe burden lies on the prosecution to establish benami\n\ntransaction. The prosecution has not adduced any\n\nevidence with regard to allegation of benami transaction.\n\nAccused No.1 is cine actress. She has filed returns since\n\nshe was a minor. The property bearing No.36, Poes\n\nGarden, was acquired by her mother and also Natya Kala\n\nNikethan. Accused No.1 acquired adjacent property of Poes\n\nGarden for sum of Rs.8 lakhs. Except this, she has not\npurchased any property. The allegation of prosecution is\n\nthat Accused Nos.2 to 4 purchased the property from the\n\nill gotten money of Accused No.1. The value of immovable\n\nproperty acquired amounts to Rs.6,24,09,120/- i.e.,\n\nagricultural lands. Kodanadu Tea Estate was acquired by\n\nAccused Nos. 2 to 4 and it is worth about Rs.3.50 Crores.\n\nThe prosecution itself has shown the property of Accused\n\nNos. 1 to 4 firms and companies to the extent of\n\nRs.9,34,26,053.56/- whereas the loan borrowed by\n\nAccused Nos. 1 to 4 and also firms and companies is to the\n\nextent of Rs.24,17,31,274/-. The burden lies on the\n\nprosecution in\n'SITARAM SYAN NARAIN v. ISWARI\n\nCHARAN SARANGI AND OTHERS\n' reported in AIR 1934\n\nPATNA 492 wherein the High Court of Patna has held with\n\nregard to intermingling of goods with that of the plaintiff -\n\nburden of proving what proportion belonged to plaintiff is a\n\nmust.\n\nSection 103\nof the Indian Evidence Act,1872 reads\n\nas under:\n\n\"103.Burden of proof as to particular fact\n\n- The burden of proof as to any particular fact\nlies on that person who wishes the Court to\nbelieve in its existence, unless it is provided by\nany law that the proof of that fact shall lie on\nany particular person.\"\n\nAll the facts, however, numerous and complicated\n\nwhich goes to make the Accused guilt, must be proved by\n\nthe prosecution. If the Accused wishes to prove a\n\nparticular fact, for example, source of income from which\n\nhe acquired the assets, then he must prove it. The role\n\nplayed by each of the Accused has also to be established\n\nby the Prosecution. But, in the instant case, prosecution\n\nhas not adduced any evidence in respect of\nsection 103\nof\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act.\n\nIt is the allegation of the prosecution that Accused\n\nNos. 1 to 4 acquired various immovable properties,\n\ninvested huge amount towards construction. Though\n\nnearly 14 Engineers were examined, but the valuation\n\nreport has been marked, the Engineers did not speak\n\nanything about measurement of the buildings, except\n\nmarking the valuation report. It is well settled that the\n\ndocuments do not themselves prove the contents therein.\n\nThe proof of contents has to be given by cogent evidence.\n\nIf these two aspects have been narrated by the witnesses,\nthen an opportunity should be given to the opposite parties\n\nto contest the correctness of such evidence by cross\n\nexamination. But, in the instant case, simply valuation\n\nreport has been marked, contents have not been narrated.\n\nThe prosecution witnesses, namely, Engineers have used\n\nthe word supreme quality of marbles, granites highest\n\nquality of sanitary fittings. But, the evidence on record\n\ndiscloses that the marbles and granites were around\n\nRs.100/- and sanitary fittings are of Hindustan\n\nSanitaryware and Jaguar. I have adopted the square rate\n\nand cost of construction per square rate is taken as\n\nRs.28,000/-. The marbles or granites samples were not\n\nsent to the suppliers.Quotation is not procured. They have\n\nsimply guessed the rate and assessed the value of granite\n\nand marbles. The construction cost was valued at\n\nRs.27,79,88,945/- by the DV & AC. The construction area\n\nmeasured by way of square feet is about 1,66,839.68 sq.\n\nfeet. It amounts to 1668.39 squares. The learned\n\nSessions Judge has simply on guess work has reduced the\n\ncost of construction to the extent of 20% without verifying\n\nthe evidence and the material placed on record. This\n\nCourt has to assess the value of the construction of the\nyear 1995. This has to be assessed in the year 2015. It is\n\na very difficult task when evidence of Engineers of PWD\n\nare vague and without any data like measurement by way\n\nof square feet and measurement of area laying of marbles\n\nand granites and even to ascertain the value of teak, no\n\nForest Officer or Expert has been examined. The\n\nEngineers of the PWD are more theoretical rather than\n\npractical.\n\nInsofar as marriage expenditure is concerned,\n\nAccused No.1 has disclosed that she has spent about\n\nRs.28,68,000/- for bearing marriage expenses. DW.1 -\n\nRamkumar has deposed that he has spent about Rs.92\n\nlakhs. Bank passbook is also produced and marked. The\n\nbride's father Narayanswamy was a Professor in IIT. His\n\nevidence on record discloses that he has spent about Rs.18\n\nlakhs. There is positive evidence to the effect that party\n\nworkers of AIADMK has met the expenses of food and\n\npandal. Engineers valued pandal based on plan. Their\n\nevidence is to the effect that without inspecting the\n\npandal, they have given statement of expenditure that\n\nmight have occurred. Their evidence is hear-say. The\n\nevidence on record reveals that party workers took up the\nresponsibility of erecting pandal. SriA.R. Rahman and\n\nSriMandolin Srinivas have performed music with free of\n\ncost. The bridegroom's grandfather is Mr. Sivajiganeshan.\n\nHe was a famous Tamil film actor. He was also known to\n\nA.R. Rahman. Now the question that arises is what is the\n\namount that was spent by Accused No.1 for the marriage\n\nof Accused No.3. Accused No.1 has declared in her income\n\ntax returns that she has spent about Rs.28,68,000/-. In\n\nour Hindu customs, it is bride's family members who take\n\ncare of marriage expenditure. Nominal expenditure will be\n\nborne by bridegroom's family. Just because Accused No.1\n\nwas Chief Minister at that time, we cannot saddle all the\n\nmarriage expenses on her part. Relying on income tax\n\nreturns towards expenditure of marriage, I consider that\n\nshe has spent about Rs.28,68,000/-. Besides, evidence of\n\nfather of bride is withheld by the prosecution. Accused\n\nNo.3 Bridegroom has also not entered the witness box.\n\nThe Priest who has performed the marriage has not been\n\nexamined. The Contractor for putting up pandal has not\n\nbeen examined in this case. Due to insufficient and vague\n\nevidence, it is difficult to assess as to what is the\nexpenditure that is incurred. Besides, some expenses are\n\nnot verifiable expenditure.\n\nPW.259 - Nallamma Naidu fairly admits in his\n\nevidence that reference is made to the letter sent to\n\nGovernor through Government of Tamilnadu and in that\n\nletter disproportionate assets made was Rs.\n\nRs.62,25,20,896/-. Notice was also issued to Accused\n\nNo.1 for her say. But, she replied that, she will give reply\n\nin the Court. Annexure-II to the charge sheet revealed\n\nthat the amount disproportionate is Rs.66,44,73,537.27/-.\n\nAnnexure-VII reveals an amount of Rs.2,23,30,799/- is\n\nadded. The prosecution valued disproportionate assets at\n\nRs.66,65,20,395/-. The evidence of PW.259 is inconsistent\n\nbecause while seeking sanction he mentions amount as\n\nRs.62,25,20,896/-, but while filing charge sheet it is\n\nmentioned as Rs.66,44,73,537.27/-. The evidence of\n\nPW.259 also reveals that Accused Nos. 1 to 4 have\n\nborrowed heavy loans. Anti-Corruption and Vigilance\n\nManual is not framed in conformity with the rulings of the\n\nApex Court. Manual does not indicate as to what is the\n\npercentage of disproportionate income/assets are to be\n\nmentioned in the FIR or charge sheet. In my view, the\nomission to mention the percentage of disproportionate\n\nincome in the charge sheet is not in accordance with law.\n\nThe case of the prosecution that Accused No.1 amassed\n\nwealth and acquired agricultural lands, sites, floated firms,\n\nbecame Directors of the companies cannot be believed\n\nbecause the money that has been spent for acquiring the\n\nsaid properties can be inferred from the loans borrowed\n\nfrom the Nationalized Banks. Besides, Accused was having\n\nan income from Kodanadu Tea Estate for about ten\n\nmonths.\n\nPW.177 - Shanmugha Sundaram speaks about loan\n\napplication of Tmt. Gunapasini for a sum of Rs.3.75\n\nCrores. On request of Gunapasini, they changed the loan\n\nliability to A2, A3 and A4 since they became the share\n\nholders.\n\nThe evidence of PW.71 - S.Radhakrishnan,\n\nHorticulture Officer reveals at Page No.11 that at Metal\n\nKing Sudhakaran met Hiriyan personally for 10 minutes.\n\nHiriyan was appointed for the kodanadu Tea Estate and\n\ngiven an honorarium of Rs.5,000/- per month, that day\n\nnight he and Hiriyan went to Ooty. From there, via\nKothagiri went to Kodanadu. He introduced Hiriyan to\n\nKodanadu Manager there and later returned to\n\nThirunelveli. Kodanadu Tea Estate measures 800 acres. In\n\nthat, already in 700 acres, tea has been cultivated. The\n\nremaining were vacant lands. Hiriyan said that there, one\n\nacre of land will fetch Rs.1 lakh. In Kodanadu there were\n\ntwo Bungalows, one tea factory and quarters for the\n\nemployees.On perusal of evidence of PW.71, it is clear that\n\nKodanadu Tea Estate generated income to the extent of\n\nRs.7 Crores. This is the income generated from the tea\n\nestate. The Investigating Agency has valued the building\n\nconstructed in the tea estate and also pipes\nlaid down in\n\nthe tea estate. But, it is very strange that they have not\n\nassessed the income of the tea estate and added to\n\nAnnexure-III i.e., income during check period between\n\n1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996. The Investigating Agency has\n\nomitted this income in Annexure-III. Even defence has not\n\nexamined any witness as to what is the income generated\n\nfrom the tea estate and they have also not claimed the\n\nsame. Therefore, this court has not considered this income\n\nwhile calculating disproportionate assets. However, I am\n\nconstrained to mention that this aspect cannot be ignored\ntotally while calculating the disproportionate assets of the\n\nAccused.\n\nPW.53 - R. Ashokan speaks about capacity of\n\ngrinding 100 tonnes of paddy everyday by Ramraj Agro\n\nMills Limited. This income has also not been properly\n\nassessed. The learned Special Judge has not appreciated\n\nthe evidence placed on record in a proper perspective.\n\nThough I have not considered the value of footwear\n\nand sarees, there is discrepancy in the evidence of PW.259\n\n- Nallamma Naidu, Chief Investigating Officer. Annexure-\n\nII discloses assets at the end of the check period i.e., as\n\non 30.4.1996, combination of Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4,\n\npartnership firms, companies is Rs.66,44,73,537/-. I\n\nintend to take the value of the assets as indicated by the\n\nprosecution i.e., Rs.66,44,73,537/-.\n\nIn the case of KRISHNANAND AGNIHOTRI V/S.\n\nSTATE OF M.P reported in AIR 1977 SC 796; wherein\n\nparagraph No.33 reads as under:\n\n\"It will, therefore, be seen that as\nagainst an aggregate surplus income of\nRs.44,383.59 which was available to the\nappellant during the period in question, the\nappellant possessed total assets worth\nRs.55,732.25. The assets possessed by the\nappellant were thus in excess of the surplus\nincome available to him, but since the excess\nis comparatively very small - it is less than\n10%, of the total income of Rs.1,27,715.43 -\nwe do not think it would be right to hold that\nthe assets found in possession of the appellant\nwere disproportionate to his known source of\nincome so as to justify the raising of\npresumption under sub-Section(3) of Section\n\n5. We are of the view that, on the facts of the\npresent case, the High Court as well as the\nSpecial Judge were in error in raising the\npresumption contained in sub-Section(3) of\n\nSection 5\nand convicting the appellant on the\nbasis of such presumption.\"\n\nApplying the principle laid-down in above mentioned\n\nKrishnanand Agnihotri's Case, statements showing the\n\ncalculation of Total Assets and Income of accused Nos.1 to\n\n4, firms and companies and arriving at the percentage of\n\ndisproportionate assets thereof, are as under:\nPARTICULARS AMOUNT TOTAL AMOUNT\n(IN RUPEES) (IN RUPEES)\nAssets as per DV & AC 66,44,73,573\ni) Cost of construction:\nAs per DV & AC 27,79,88,945\nLess: As per records and finding\n5,10,54,060\nTotal (A)\n22,69,34,885\n\nii) Marriage Expenses:\nAs per DV & AC 6,45,04,222\nLess: As per finding of this\nCourt\n28,68,000\nTotal (B)\n6,16,36,222\n\n(A+B) 28,85,71,107\n\nLess: (A+B) 28,85,71,107\n\n37,59,02,466\nTOTAL ASSETS\n\nStatement of the income of Accused Nos. 1 to 4,\n\nfirms and companies are as under:\n\nSl. Amount\nParticulars\nNo. (in Rupees)\n1. Loans as income 18,17,46,000\n2. Income from grape Garden 46,71,600\n3. Gifts 1,50,00,000\n4. Sasi Enterprises 25,00,000\n5. Jaya Publications & Namadhu MGR 4,00,00,000\n6. Super Duper TV Pvt. Ltd., 1,00,00,000\n\n7. Rental Income 3,22,000\n\n8. Income assessed by DV & AC 9,34,26,054\n\n34,76,65,654\nTOTAL INCOME\nDISPROPORTIONATE ASSETS:\n\nTotal Assets - Total Income\n\nRs.37,59,02,466-Rs.34,76,65,654= Rs.2,82,36,812\n\nPercentage - Disproportionate assets x 100\nIncome\n\n- Rs.2,82,36,812 x 100\nRs.34,76,65,654\n\n= 8.12%\n\nIt is well settled law that according to Krishnanand\n\nAgnihotri's case, when there is disproportionate asset to\n\nthe extent of 10%, the accused are entitled for acquittal.\n\nA circular has been issued by the Government of Andhra\n\nPradesh that disproportionate asset to the extent of 20%\n\ncan also be considered as a permissible limit. The margin\n\nof 10% to 20% of the disproportionate assets has been\n\ntaken as a permissible limit, taking into consideration the\n\ninflatory measures. Since the value of apparels and\n\nslippers etc., are of insignificant value, I did not deduct\n\nthis amount from the assets of DV & AC. The Prosecution\n\nhas mixed up assets of Accused, firms and companies and\n\nalso added the cost of construction i.e., Rs.27,79,88,945/-\n\nand marriage expenses at Rs.6,45,04,222/- and valued the\nassets at Rs.66,44,73,573/-. If we remove the\n\nexaggerated value of cost of construction and marriage\n\nexpenses, the assets will work out at Rs.37,59,02,466/-.\n\nThe total income of the Accused, firms and companies is\n\nRs.34,76,65,654/-. Lack of proportion amount is\n\nRs.2,82,36,812/-. The percentage of disproportionate\n\nassets is 8.12%. It is relatively small. In the instant case,\n\nthe disproportionate asset is less than 10% and it is within\n\npermissible limit. Therefore, Accused are entitled for\n\nacquittal. When the principal Accused has been acquitted,\n\nthe other Accused, who have played a lesser role are also\n\nentitled for acquittal.\n\nIn an appeal from a conviction it is for the appellate\n\nCourt as for the first Court to be satisfied affirmatively that\n\nthe prosecution case is substantially true and that the guilt\n\nof the appellants has been established beyond all\n\nreasonable doubt. It is not for the appellants to satisfy the\n\nappellate Court that the first Court had come to a wrong\n\nfinding. In an appeal by some of the convicted persons, it\n\nis open to this Court as an appellate Court to examine the\n\nentire evidence. The powers of the appellate Court under\n\nthis Section are the same as those of the Trial Court. If\nafter examining the evidence, this Court is in a position to\n\nsay that the findings arrived at are erroneous, or contrary\n\nto evidence then not only there is no legal prohibition to do\n\nso but in the interest of justice, that must be done. In this\n\ncase, the Trial Court has ignored the Income Tax\n\nproceedings as minimum evidentiary value. The Trial Court\n\nhas not appreciated the evidence in a proper perspective.\n\nThough the Trial Court in its judgment mentioned that the\n\naccused availed loan by the Indian Bank, but it has not\n\nconsidered the same as income. Therefore, the Trial Court\n\nhas erred in not considering the loans as income. Even the\n\nvaluation though disputed by the defence, the Trial Court\n\nhas failed to examine the evidence relating to cost of\n\nconstruction at that relevant time and simply arrived at a\n\nconclusion that 20% of the cost has to be reduced without\n\nappreciating the evidence placed on record. This 20%\n\nreduction is calculated on surmises and conjectures. The\n\nTrial Court has assessed the Marriage Expenses at\n\nRs.3,00,00,000/-. There is no acceptable evidence to\n\npoint-out that A-1 has spent about Rs.3,00,00,000/-. In\n\nspite of it, the Trial Court has arrived at a figure of\n\nRs.3,00,00,000/- as modest and conservative estimation.\nArriving at Rs.3,00,00,000/- towards marriage expenses\n\nand fixing liability of Rs.3,00,00,000/- to A-1 alone is not\n\nproper. Most of the claims put-forth by the accused have\n\nbeen rejected by the Trial Court. It is the contention of\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellants that without treating\n\nthe witnesses as hostile, the witnesses were recalled and\n\ncross-examined. The questions are put in such a manner\n\nthat whether what they have stated in the examination-in-\n\nchief is correct or in the cross-examination is correct by\n\nsecuring answer to this question and also by adopting this\n\nmethod, they cannot wipe-out the answers elicited in the\n\ncross-examination. This is also one of the factors, which\n\nweigh in favour of the accused. If the witness gives\n\ndifferent statements at different stages, it is unsafe to\n\nplace reliance on them. Taking into consideration of overall\n\ncircumstances and material placed on record, in my view,\n\nthe Judgment and finding recorded by the Trial Court\n\nsuffers from infirmity and it is not sustainable in law.\n12. In view of the above discussion, I pass\n\nthe following:\n\nORDER\n\n[A] Criminal Appeal Nos.835/2014, 836/2014,\n\n837/2014 and 838/2014 are allowed.\n\n[i] The Judgment of Conviction and\nSentence passed in Spl.C.C.No.208 of\n2004, dated 27.9.2014, on the file of the\n36th Additional City Civil & Sessions\nJudge (Spl.
