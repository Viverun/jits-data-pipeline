Originally, the first respondent namely Retired and Pensioners\n\nWelfare Association of the TNSTC filed a writ petition to quash the G.O.(Ms).No.\n\n63 dated 07.04.2012 to the extent denying the revision of pension @ 9% from\n\n2005, @ 12% from 2007 and 15% from 2011 over and above already given.\n\n3. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition in W.P.\n\n(MD).No.14173 of 2015, vide order dated 15.12.2020 on the ground that, the\n\nclaim made by the writ petitioners based on settlement U/s 12(3) of\nIndustrial\n\nDisputes Act\nand if any dispute arise in this regard, they shall approach the\n\nPage 11 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nLabour Court by raising dispute and accordingly, the writ petition was dismissed\n\nafter observing that the writ petitioners are at liberty to approach the Labour\n\nCourt for the course of redressal of their grievances.\n\n4. The Retired Employees Welfare Association/ 3rd parties have\n\nchallenged the order passed in writ petitions and also filed a separate writ\n\npetitions stating that, there is no alternative remedy available to the appellants\n\nherein, since they are no longer workmen under the Corporation and they are\n\nalready retired and the association itself comprises only of retired persons, hence\n\nthey could not initiate any proceedings before the Labour Court, including issue\n\nraised herein, i.e., enhanced pension payable by the Corporation to the retired\n\nemployees.\n\nSubmissions made on behalf of the writ petitioners:\n\n5. Third party appellants and writ petitioner (petitioners hereinafter)\n\nsubmitted that, as per the clause 11(3) and 11(6) of the settlement entered\nu/s\n\n12(3)\nof the Industrial Dispute Act (u/s 12(3) Settlement hereinafter) dated\n\n22.01.2011 (2011 settlement hereinafter), they are entitled to get revision of\n\npension @ 9% from 2005, @ 12% from 2007 and 15% from 2011 over and above\n\nPage 12 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nthe amount already given. Originally, the prayer was made seeking revision of\n\npension as per the above 12(3) settlement. There is yet another settlement entered\n\nbetween the trade unions recorded under\nSection 12(3)\nof ID Act dated\n\n13.04.2015 (2015 settlement hereinafter), wherein the parties have agreed to\n\nrevise the pension only @ 15%. Hence separate writ petitions have been filed by\n\nsome more pensioners, challenging the provision of fixing the revision of pension\n\n@ 15%. It is alleged that, from the year 2010 onwards, the revision of pension\n\nwill be based on DA merged with the basic pay, hence it comes up to around 49%\n\nof the revision. However, the Pension Trust has granted only 15% revision over\n\nand above already given, which is against the 2011 settlement.\n\n6. The petitioners further allege that, one set of retired employees of\n\nTransport Corporations i.e., Managerial Staffs are entitled for 40% of pension\n\nrevision, but the pension revised only @ 15% that to only to the workmen\n\nemployees retired prior to 01.09.2010 with monetary benefits from 01.04.2015\n\nand this is violation of\nArticle 14\nand\nof Constitution of India and these reliefs\n\nare sought based on the admitted facts, which does not require adducing any\n\nevidence, hence the writ petitions are maintainable.\n\nPage 13 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nSubmissions made on behalf of the Pension Trust and State Government:\n\n7. The respondents/ Government and Pension Trust Board submitted\n\nthat there is no provisions in the pension rules for enabling the pensioners for\n\nseeking revision of pension. The Pension Trust is already facing financial crisis,\n\nhence further increase of pension would adversely affect the interest of the\n\npensioners, who are already receiving the pension. As per 2011 settlement, it was\n\nproposed to revise the pension and referred the matter to Pension Trust.\n\nAccordingly, the Pension Trust discussed the subject and decided to revise the\n\npension @ 15%. In subsequent settlement dated 13.04.2015, i.e., 2015 settlement\n\nalso, the decision taken by the Pension Trust board to grant 15% revision of\n\npension was accepted by the Associations and Trade Unions, hence the appellants\n\nare not entitled to claim more than what was agreed in the 12(3) settlement dated\n\n13.04.2015. They further stated that points based Variable Dearness Allowance in\n\nthe pension as on 13.09.2007 is already merged with the Basic Pay and pension\n\nwas paid with effect from 01.10.2007 and it has been continuously increased from\n\n01.10.2007, hence there is no discrimination as alleged by the petitioners herein.\n\nThey further submitted that comparison made with the managerial retired\n\nemployees is misconceived since they form different class and they have paid\n\nPage 14 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nrevised pension based on their contribution and also based on revision made on\n\npar with Government employees.\n\nReply of the Petitioners:\n\n8. In reply to the submissions made on the side of the Pension Trust\n\nBoard and the Government, petitioners submitted that, at the time of constituting\n\nPension Trust fund, it was clarified by the Government of Tamil Nadu that the\n\npension benefits will be increased as and when there is increase in the State\n\nGovernment employees. Similarly, it was intimated that there will be a provision\n\nfor the proposed scheme for periodic increase of the pension scheme, hence the\n\nGovernment or Pension Trust cannot contend that there is no provision for\n\nrevision of pension. They further submitted that whenever the pay of the State\n\nGovernment employees were revised on the basis of the Pay Commission\n\nrecommendations, the same is made applicable to the various other employees of\n\nthe statutory bodies including the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, even in the\n\nabsence of any provisions in the Pension rules. As per G.O.(Ms).No.65 dated\n\n21.05.2009, the Pension Trust started revising the pension by merging the\n\nvariable DA with effect from 01.10.2010 and the said revision shall be followed\n\nfor continuous revision of pay. Similarly, the Pension Trust had passed a\n\nPage 15 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nresolution dated 14.02.2011 to give pension revision to the retired staff as per the\n\n12(3) settlement @ 15% to the basic pensions drawn on 01.09.2010, accordingly\n\nthey had approached from the Government for grant approval for the same.\n\nHaving accepted and taken steps to get the approval from the Government, the\n\nTrust could not revisit it again and modify the rate. The petitioners also rely on\n\nthe revision of pension made to the managerial staff pensioners, and to contend\n\nthat the Government is estopped from contending that, there is no provision in the\n\npension rules for revision of pension.\n\nDiscussions and Conclusions:\n\n9. We have considered the submissions made on both sides and perused\n\nthe materials available on record:\n\n10. Pursuant to the settlement entered between the Trade Unions and the\n\nManagement of Transport Corporations under\nSection 12(3)\nof the Industrial\n\nDisputes Act, separate Pension Fund namely Tamil Nadu State Transport\n\nCorporation Pension Fund was constituted and consequently, Tamil Nadu State\n\nTransport Corporation Employees fund rules (Rules hereinafter) were framed and\n\ncame into operation from 01.09.1998.\n\nPage 16 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n11.

The Trust Fund shall be administered\nby the Board of Trustees prescribed under Rule 3(a) and its functions\nand powers are also contemplated. The rules further provides\neligible pensioner's benefits for determination of the pensioner's\nservice, salaries, family pension, commutation etc. Rule 12 further\ndeclares that the determination of eligible service, pensionable salary\nand other connected issues are subject to interpretation of the rules\nby the Government. Rule 20(A) deals with providing eligible\nDearness Allowance payable at the rate that may be determined by\nthe Government of Tamil Nadu and further constitution of the pension\nfund and framing of rules. It was implemented from the appointed\ndate of 01.09.1998.”\n\n12. The writ petitioners herein claim that they are workmen category\n\npensioners and they are entitled for revision of pension as per the wage settlement\n\nunder\nSection 12(3)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act dated 22.01.2011 (i.e.,) under\n\n2011 settlement. As per clause 11(3) and 11(6) of the 2011 settlement, the\n\nproposed revision of pension is also agreed between the parties and the revision\n\nshall be @ 9% from 2005, @ 12% from 2007 and from the year 2010 @ revision\n\nof pay and Dearness Allowance fixed to the serving employees, the pay revision\n\nPage 17 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nunder settlement dated 22.01.2011 came into effect from 01.09.2010 and the\n\nproposal shall be placed before the Pension Trust Board and approval shall be\n\nobtained form the Pension Trust Board. This clause was considered by the Trust\n\nBoard and it had made a decision to award 15% of increase in the pension\n\npayable to the retired employees and referred the matter to the Government for\n\napproval. Accordingly, the Government had considered and passed a\n\nGovernment Order in G.O.(Ms).No.53 dated 07.04.2015 by increasing the\n\npension by 15% with effect from 01.04.2015.\n\n13. It is also admitted fact that in the year 2009 itself, the Dearness\n\nAllowance of workmen pensioners. which was paid by following Variable\n\nDearness Allowance, was merged with basic pay, vide G.O.(Ms.) No.65 dated\n\n21.05.2009 and thereby is was further ordered that, further increase of Dearness\n\nAllowance will be paid by way of percentage method revision. It is also admitted\n\nthat this merger of Dearness Allowance was not granted to the managerial retired\n\nstaff. Further, the managerial staff were awarded revision of pay and pension\n\nafter the Government has taken policy decision to implement the 6th Pay\n\nCommission recommendations, which was constituted for fixing the wage and\n\nrevision of pension for the Government employees of Tamil Nadu. Accordingly,\n\nPage 18 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\na separate pension revision of 40% with effect from 01.01.2006 was paid to the\n\nmanagerial staff and this expenditure was met out by Tamil Nadu State Transport\n\nCorporation Employees Pension Fund Trust without any financial assistance from\n\nthe Government.\n\n14. Subsequent to the proposed revision of pension based on the 2011\n\nsettlement, there are further wage settlements entered in the years 2015 and 2018.\n\nBy subsequent settlement dated 13.04.2015, it was agreed that the workmen who\n\nretired prior to 01.09.2010 are entitled to 15% of the enhanced pension from\n\n01.04.2015, thereby, the G.O.(Ms.) No.53 dated 07.04.2015 passed by the\n\nGovernment was accepted by the parties to the settlement. Though the retired\n\nworkmen have demanded revision of pension based on the 2011 settlement, in the\n\nsubsequent settlement, they have accepted enhancement of 15% in the revision of\n\npension from 01.04.2015.\n\n15. As contended in the earlier paragraph, what was agreed in the 2011\n\nsettlement is only a proposal to revision the pension, i.e., with increase @ 9%\n\nfrom the year 2005, increase @ 12% from the year 2007 and the revision under\n\nsettlement dated 22.01.2011 with effect from 01.09.2010, was not concluded and\n\nPage 19 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nit was subject to the decision taken by the Pension Trust. Subsequently, the\n\ndecision was taken by the Pension Trust and concluded with issuance of G.O.\n\n(Ms.) No.53 dated 07.04.2015 and in the next settlement i.e., the settlement\n\nentered in the year 2015, the Trade Unions have accepted the same.\n\n16. In view of the above facts, we are of the view that the petitioners\n\nherein could not rely on the settlement entered in the year 2011 for the purpose of\n\nrevision of pension. However, separate writ petitions were filed before this\n\nCourt, challenging the 2015 settlement, contending that the subsequent settlement\n\nentered in the year 2015 and in clause 37 are violative of\nArticle 14\nand\nof\n\nConstitution of India, since it is discriminatory, as against the workmen\n\npensioners.\n\n17. According to the writ petitioners, the pensioners of the managerial\n\nstaff of the Transport Corporation have been granted 40% of enhancement in their\n\npension as per the 6th Pay Commission recommendations, whereas the writ\n\npetitioners, who belongs to workmen category of the very same Transport\n\nCorporation are granted only with 15% enhancement in pension with effect from\n\n01.04.2015.\n\nPage 20 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n18. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that, admittedly both\n\ncategories are receiving pension only from the very same Pension Fund, hence\n\nboth managerial staff and workmen groups forms one of the Homogeneous group\n\nand there cannot be any classification among them. Whereas the Government has\n\ndecided to increase the pension to the extent of 40% only to one set of group,\n\nwho were the retired staff of the Management. The Government ought to have\n\ngranted the very same percentage of the revision to workmen category also. The\n\nwrit petitioners herein have relied on the judgments of the Apex Court in\nD.S.\n\nNakara and Others vs. Union of India\n[(1983) 1 SCC 305], Kallakurichi Taluk\n\nRetired Officials Association, Tamil nadu and\nOthers vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n\n[(\n2013) 2 SCC 772] and All Manipur Pensioners Association vs. State of\n\nManipur and others\n[(2020) 14 SCC 625].\n\n19. The learned counsels for the petitioners further submitted that the\n\nclassification between the two groups made herein was not based on any rational\n\nprinciple, however if any rational principle followed, further it has not been done\n\nto achieve the objects. In this case, the object to be achieved is to revise the\n\npension due to the escalation cost of living and to meet the financial needs of\n\npensioners. It is further submitted by the learned counsels that the division made\n\nPage 21 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nherein is arbitrary, it runs counter to the whole gamut of the pension scheme,\n\nmore particularly the revision of pension, hence prays to set aside the G.O.(Ms.)\n\nNo.53 dated 07.04.2015 and also the clause 37 of the wage settlement dated\n\n13.04.2015.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the Government and Pension Trust submitted\n\nthat the arguments made by the petitioners that, both managerial retired staff and\n\nthe retired workmen categories form one class is misconceived and admittedly,\n\nthe managerial staff are receiving pay on par with the State Government\n\nemployees and their pay is fixed based on the recommendations of the Pay\n\nCommission constituted by the State Government and not covered under any\n\nwage settlement. Similarly, there is no provisions under the pension rules to\n\nmake revision of pension and it is a policy decision of the Government to extend\n\nthe benefit of pay revision to the workmen category.\n\n21. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the State Government\n\nthat when ever there was a wage settlement to the workers reached, consequently,\n\nthe pension benefits are also regulated, accordingly. Though there was no\n\nseparate revision of pension for the pensioners, under\nSection 12(3)\nsettlement, at\n\nPage 22 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nthe time of exit from their service, the Dearness Allowance would be paid as\n\nVariable Dearness Allowance (VDA hereinafter) covered under\nSection 12(3)\n\nsettlement. Further in respect of managerial staff, rate of Dearness Allowances is\n\nbeing paid on par with Government employees. Similarly, the managerial staff\n\nconstitute only 1% of cadre strength and remaining 99% are the workmen\n\ncategory. Since this managerial staff constitute separate category and class, they\n\ncannot be equated with the workmen category. The managerial staff were carrying\n\nhigher responsibilities, while they were in service and accordingly, they were also\n\nmade higher contribution for pension than the workmen categories.\n\n22. The learned counsel for the State further submitted that taking note\n\nof the fact that there was no revision of pension to the workmen category, by\n\nissuing G.O.(Ms.) No.65 dated 21.05.2009, the Government has taken the policy\n\ndecision to merge the V.D.A with the pension received by the employees and\n\naccordingly, it was made as basic pension. Further, it was decided to pay the\n\nDearness Allowance based on the percentage method with effect from\n\n01.10.2007, which resulted in revision of pension to the workmen category. He\n\nfurther submitted, since classification made herein is reasonable classification and\n\nworkmen category cannot be equated with the managerial staff category,\n\nPage 23 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nmanagerial staff are being paid pension and entitled to Dearness Allowance on\n\npar with the State Government servants. Whenever the Government revises the\n\nsame, it is made applicable to the managerial staff category, hence submitted that\n\nthe contention of the petitioner that there is a discrimination is not proper.\n\n23. The learned counsel of State further submitted that the petitioners at\n\nthe time of filing the writ petitions, they relied on the 2011 settlement for seeking\n\nrevision, now the very same petitioners have come with a claim that the\n\nsubsequent settlement, which accepts the Government proposal to revise the\n\npension in terms of G.O.(Ms.) No.53 and challenging the 2015 settlement only\n\nshows that the petitioners are approbate and reprobate and they are not entitled to\n\nchallenge the clause 37 of the 2015 settlement. It is also brought to the\n\nknowledge of this Court that, another settlement in the year 2018 is also rendered\n\nand the Trade Unions till now had not challenged the revision of pension ordered\n\nby Government.\n\n24. The learned counsel for State further submitted that since\n\nmanagerial staff are constituted to 1% of the Pension Trust and already the\n\nPension Trust is facing high financial difficulties and already requested the\n\nPage 24 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nGovernment to rescue the Trust Fund by making contribution. To buttress his\n\narguments, the learned counsel also relied on the letter dated 05.08.2018 sent by\n\nthe Pension Trust to the Government regarding the financial position of the\n\nPension Trust as on 31.03.2013. Further, another letter dated 11.09.2018\n\naddressed to the Government was relied on to state that there are subsequent\n\nsettlement and 7th Pay Commission implementations are pending. It is also stated\n\nin the 2013 wage statement, the Government has come forward to compensate the\n\nshort fall of the Trust Fund and only Rs.33 lakhs is available with the Trust Fund\n\nat that point of time. Hence the Pension Trust and Government had considered\n\nthe financial constraints while revising the pension to the workmen category,\n\ntherefore prays to dismiss these writ appeals and writ petitions.\n\n25. The Constitution Bench of Apex Court in\nD.S. Nakara vs. Union of\n\nIndia\n[1983 1 SCC 305] cited supra has elaborately reiterated the principle to be\n\nfollowed while revision of pension and observed in paragraph Nos.31, 42 and 65\n\nas follows:\n\n“31. From the discussion three things emerge : (i) that\npension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the\nsweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to\n1972 rules which are statutory in character because they are enacted\nin exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to\nArt.309\nand clause\n\nPage 25 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n(5) of\nArt.148\nof the Constitution ; (ii) that the pension is not an ex-\ngratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered ; and\n\n(iii) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to\nthose who in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly toiled for the\nemployer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left\nin lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum of pension is a\ncertain percentage correlated to the average emoluments drawn\nduring last three years of service reduced to ten months under\nliberalised pension scheme. Its payment is dependent upon an\nadditional condition of impeccable behaviour even subsequent to\nrequirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract of service and\nthat it can be reduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary measure.\n\n....\n\n42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the\npensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its\nupward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by\narbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of\nrevision, and would such classification be founded on some rational\nprinciple ? The classification has to be based, as is well settled, on\nsome rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to\nthe objects sought to be achieved. We have set out the objects\nunderlying the payment of pension. If the State considered it necessary\nto liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind\nit for granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to\nthat date simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior\nto that date. If the liberalisation was considered necessary for\naugmenting social security in old age to government servants then\nthose who retired earlier cannot be worst off than those who retire\nlater. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two\nclasses is not based on any rational principle and if the rational\nprinciple is the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving\nsomething more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be\ndiscriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired just a day\nprior and another a day just succeeding the specified date. Both were\nin the same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and\nboth had put in equal number of years of service. How does a\nfortuitous circumstance of retiring a day earlier or a day later will\npermit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension ? One\n\nPage 26 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nretiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of Rs. 8,100 p\na. and average emolument to be worked out on 36 months' salary\nwhile the other will have a ceiling of Rs. 12,000 p.a. and average\nemolument will be computed on the basis of last ten months average.\nThe artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any principle\nand whatever principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the\nobjects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme. In\nfact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the liberalised\npension scheme but it is counter productive and runs counter to the\nwhole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment guaranteed in\n\nArt.14\nis wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules being\nstatutory in character, since the specified date, the rules accord\ndifferential and discriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of\ncommutation of pension. A 48 hours difference in matter of retirement\nwould have a traumatic effect. Division is thus both arbitrary and\nunprincipled. Therefore the classification does not stand the test of\n\nArt.14.\n\n....\n\n65. That is the end of the journey. With the expanding\nhorizons of socio-economic justice, the socialist Republic and welfare\nState which we endeavour to set up and largely influenced by the fact\nthat the old men who retired when emoluments were comparatively\nlow and are exposed to vagaries of continuously rising prices, the\nfalling value of the rupee consequent upon inflationary inputs, we are\nsatisfied that by introducing an arbitrary eligibility criteria: 'being in\nservice and retiring subsequent to the specified date' for being eligible\nfor the liberalised pension scheme and thereby dividing a\nhomogeneous class, the classification being not based on any\ndiscernible rational principle and having been found wholly unrelated\nto the objects sought to be achieved by grant of liberalised pension\nand the eligibility criteria devised being thoroughly arbitrary, we are\nof the view that the eligibility for liberalised pension scheme of being\nin service on the specified date and retiring subsequent to that date' in\nimpugned memoranda....”\n\nPage 27 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n26. With regard to maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the\n\nretired employees for revision of pension, the Apex Court in\nD.S. Nakara\ncase\n\ncited supra has held in paragraph No.64 hereunder, hence it is argued that the\n\nsame is applicable to the writ petitioners herein.\n\n“64. Locus standi of 3rd petitioner was questioned. Petitioner\n3 is a Society registered under the\nSocieties Registration Act\nof 1860.\nIt is a non-political non-profit and voluntary organisation. Its\nmembers consist of public-spirited citizens who have taken up the\ncause of ventilating legitimate public problems. This Society received\na large number of representations from old pensioners, individually a\nlarge number of representations from old pensioners, individually\nunable to undertake the journey through labyrinths of legal judicial\nprocess, costly and protracted, and, therefore, approached petitioner 3\nwhich espoused their cause. Objects for which the 3 rd petitioner-\nSociety was formed were not questioned. The majority decision of this\nCourt in\nS.P. Gupta vs. Union of India\nrules that any member of the\npublic having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial\nredress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from\nviolation of some provision of the Constitution or the law and seek\nenforcement of such public duty and observance of such constitutional\nor legal provision. Third petitioner seeks to enforce rights that may be\navailable to a large number of old infirm retirees. Therefore, its locus\nstandi is unquestionable. But it is a point of academic importance\nbecause locus standi of petitioners 1 and 2 was never questioned.”\n\n27. The Apex Court in\nThe All Manipur Pensioners Association vs The\n\nState Of Manipur\n[(2020) 14 SCC 625] cited supra has once again reiterated the\n\nprinciple\nlaid down in\n\nD.S. Nakara\ncase and held in paragraph Nos. 7.4 to 8.2 as\n\nfollows:\n\nPage 28 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n“7.4 While the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of\n\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra) was relied upon by the appellant herein and as\nsuch which came to be considered and followed by the learned\nSingle Judge, the Division Bench considering some of the\nobservations made in the cases of\nHari Ram Gupta\n(supra);\nR.Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath Goyal (supra) and\nP.N.\nMenon\n(supra), has observed and held that the decision of this Court\nin the case of\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra) is one of the limited application\nand there is no scope for enlarging the ambit of that decision to\ncover all schemes made by the retirees or a demand for an identical\namount of pension irrespective of the date of retirement.However, by\nnot following the decision of this Court in the case of\nD.S.\nNakara\n(supra), considering some of the observations made by this\nCourt in the aforesaid decisions, namely\nP.N. Menon\n(supra) and\nother decisions, the Division Bench of the High Court has not at all\nconsidered the distinguishable facts in the aforesaid decisions.\n\n7.5 In the case of\nP.N.Menon\n(supra), the controversy was\naltogether different one.\n\nThe factual position that needs to be\nhighlighted insofar as\nP.N.Menon\n(supra) is concerned, is that the\nretired employees had never been in receipt of “dearness pay” when\nthey retired from service and therefore the O.M. in question could\nnot have been applied to them. This is how this Court examined the\nmatter. This Court also noticed that prior to the O.M. in question,\nthe pension scheme was contributory and only with effect from\n22.9.1977, the pension scheme was made non-contributory. Since the\nrespondent employees in the first cited case were not in service at\nthe time of introducing the same they were held not eligible for the\nsaid benefit.\n\nTherefore\nthe said decision\nshall not be applicable to\nthe facts of the case on hand, more particularly while considering\nand/or applying the decision of this Court in the case of\nD.S. Nakara\n\n(supra).\n\n7.6 In the case of Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra), pension was\nintroduced for the first time for the University teachers based on the\nresolution passed by the Senate and Syndicate of Jodhpur\nUniversity. The same was approved by the State Government with\n\nPage 29 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\neffect from 1.1.1990. Therefore, the controversy was not between one\nset of pensioners alleging discriminatory treatment as against\nanother set of pensioners. There were no pensioners to begin with.\nThe retirees were entitled to provident fund under the existing\nprovident fund scheme. The question of discrimination between one\nset of pensioners from another set of pensioners did not arise in the\nsaid decision. With the aforesaid facts, this Court observed that\nfinancial viability is a relevant issue.\n\n7.7 Similarly, the decision of this Court in the case of\nIndian Ex-Services League (supra) also shall not be applicable to\nthe facts of the case on hand.\nThe facts in this case and the facts in\nthe case of\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra) are clearly distinguishable.\n\nIn the\ncase of Indian Ex-Services League (supra), the dispute was with\nrespect to PF retirees and Pension retirees and to that it was held\nthat PF retirees and Pension retirees constitute different classes and\ntherefore this Court distinguished the decision of this Court in the\ncase of\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra). Therefore, the aforesaid decision shall\nnot be applicable to the facts of the case on hand at all.\n\n7.8 Similarly, the decisions of this Court in the cases of\n\nHari Ram Gupta\n(supra) and\nKallakkurichi Taluk Retired Officials\nAssociation, Tamil Nadu\n(supra) also shall not be applicable to the\nfacts of the case on hand.\n\n7.9 In view of the above, we are satisfied that none of the\njudgments, relied upon by the learned Senior Advocate for the\nrespondent – State, has any bearing to the controversy in hand. The\nDivision Bench of the High Court has clearly erred in not\nappreciating and/or considering the distinguishable facts in the\ncases of\nHari Ram Gupta\n(supra); R.Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath\nGoyal (supra);\nP.N.Menon\n(supra) and Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra).\n\n8. Even otherwise on merits also, we are of the firm\nopinion that there is no valid justification to create two classes, viz.,\n\nPage 30 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\none who retired pre-1996 and another who retired post-1996, for the\npurpose of grant of revised pension, In our view, such a\nclassification has no nexus with the object and purpose of grant of\nbenefit of revised pension. All the pensioners form a one class who\nare entitled to pension as per the pension rules.\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India ensures to all equality before law and equal\nprotection of laws. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine\nthe concept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a\nvalid discrimination. It is true that\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of\nIndia permits a valid classification. However, a very classification\nmust be based on a just objective. The result to be achieved by the\njust objective presupposes the choice of some for differential\nconsideration/treatment over others. A classification to be valid must\nnecessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing rationale has\nto be based on a just objective and secondly, the choice of\ndifferentiating one set of persons from another, must have a\nreasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved. The test for\na valid classification may be summarised as a distinction based on a\nclassification founded on an intelligible differentia, which has a\nrational relationship with the object sought to be achieved.\nTherefore, whenever a cut-off date (as in the present controversy) is\nfixed to categorise one set of pensioners for favourable\nconsideration over others, the twin test for valid classification or\nvalid discrimination therefore must necessarily be satisfied.\n\n8.1 In the present case, the classification in question has no\nreasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved while\nrevising the pension. As observed hereinabove, the object and\npurpose for revising the pension is due to the increase in the cost of\nliving. All the pensioners form a single class and therefore such a\nclassification for the purpose of grant of revised pension is\nunreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution of India. The State cannot arbitrarily pick and\nchoose from amongst similarly situated persons, a cut-off date for\nextension of benefits especially pensionary benefits. There has to be\na classification founded on some rational principle when similarly\nsituated class is differentiated for grant of any benefit.\n\nPage 31 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n8.2 As observed hereinabove, and even it is not in dispute\nthat as such a decision has been taken by the State Government to\nrevise the pension keeping in mind the increase in the cost of living.\nIncrease in the cost of living would affect all the pensioners\nirrespective of whether they have retired pre-1996 or post-1996. As\nobserved hereinabove, all the pensioners belong to one class.\nTherefore, by such a classification/cut-off date the equals are treated\nas unequals and therefore such a classification which has no nexus\nwith the object and purpose of revision of pension is unreasonable,\ndiscriminatory and arbitrary and therefore the said classification\nwas rightly set aside by the learned Single Judge of the High Court.\nAt this stage, it is required to be observed that whenever a new\nbenefit is granted and/or new scheme is introduced, it might be\npossible for the State to provide a cut-off date taking into\nconsideration its financial resources. But the same shall not be\napplicable with respect to one and single class of persons, the\nbenefit to be given to the one class of persons, who are already\notherwise getting the benefits and the question is with respect to\nrevision.”\n\n28. The Apex Court in Kallakkurichi Taluk Retired Official\n\nAssociation, Tamilnadu and Ors. vs. State of Tamilnadu and Ors. [(2013) 2\n\nSCC 772] cited supra has held in paragraph Nos.33, 34 and 35 as follows:\n\n“33. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine the\nconcept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a valid\ndiscrimination.\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India permits a valid\nclassification (see,\nState of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas\nMANU/SC/0479/1975\n: (1976) 2 SCC 310. A valid classification is\nbased on a justobjective. The result to be achieved by the just\nobjective presupposes, the choice of some for differential\nconsideration/treatment, over others. A classification to be valid\nmust necessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing\n\nPage 32 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nrationale has to be based on a just objective. and secondly, the\nchoice of differentiating one set of persons from another, must have a\nreasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved.\nLegalistically, the test for a valid classification may be summarized\nas, adistinction based on a classification founded on an intelligible\ndifferentia, which has a rational relationship with the object sought\nto be achieved. Whenever a cut off date(as in the present\ncontroversy) is fixed to categorise one set of pensioners for\nfavourable consideration over others, the twin test for valid\nclassification (or valid discrimination) must necessarily be satisfied.\n\n34. In the context of the instant appeals, it is necessary to\nunderstand the overall objective of treating \"dearness\nallowance\" (or a part of it) as \"dearness pay\". There can be no\ndoubt, that 'dearness allowance' is extended to employees to balance\nthe effects of ongoing inflation, so as to ensure that inflation does\nnot interfere with the enjoyment of life, to which an employee is\naccustomed. Likewise, the objective of 'dearness pay' is to balance\nthe effects of ongoing inflation, so that a pensioner can adequately\nsustain the means of livelihood to which he is accustomed. Having\nunderstood the reason why the Government extends the benefit of\n'dearness allowance' and 'dearness pay', to its employees and\npensioners respectively, we would venture to search for answers to\nthe twin tests which must be satisfied, for making a valid\nclassification (or a valid discrimination),in the present fact\nsituation.\n\n35. In the present context, it needs to be kept in mind, that\n'dearness allowance' ispaid to Government employees keeping in\nmind the All India Consumer Price Index. Inflation in the market\nplace is sought to be balanced by paying 'dearness allowance' to\nGovernment employees. When a State Government chooses to treat\n'dearness allowance' as 'dearness pay', the objective remains the\nsame i.e., inflation in the market place is sought to be balanced for\nretired employees by giving them the benefit of 'dearness pay'. Since\nthe component of inflation similarly affects all employees, and all\npensioners (irrespective of the date of their entry into service or\n\nPage 33 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nretirement), it is not per se possible to accept different levels of\n'dearness pay' to remedy the malady of inflation. Just like the date of\nentry into service (for serving employees) would be wholly irrelevant\nto determine the 'dearness allowance' to be extended to serving\nemployees, because the same has no relevance to the object sought\nto be achieved. Likewise, the date of retirement (for pensioners)\nwould be wholly irrelevant to determine the 'dearness pay' to be\nextended to retired employees. Truthfully, it may be difficult to\nimagine a valid basis of classification for remedying the malaise of\ninflation. In the absence of any objective, projected in this case, the\nquestion of examining the reasonableness to the object sought to be\nachieved, simply does not arise. Our straying into this expressed\nrealm of imagination, was occasioned by the fact, that the pleadings\nfiled on behalf of the State Government, do not reveal any reason for\nthe classification, which is subject matter of challenge in the instant\nappeal.”\n\n29. In the case in hand, on careful perusal of the settlement taken place\n\nin the year 2011, the clause 11 is not binding settlement and it is only a proposal\n\nto revise the pension to the pensioners belonging to the workmen category,\n\nhowever this proposal was subject to deliberation and approval of the Pension\n\nTrust Board. Accordingly, the Trust Board discussed and decided to revise the\n\npension only to the extent of 15%, that too from the date of 01.04.2015. Though\n\nin the Apex Court judgments cited supra, it has been held that the pension is\n\nneither bounty nor a matter of grace depending on the sweet will of the employer,\n\nthe pension is ex gratia of payment. At the same time, as far as revision of\n\npension is concerned, the same could not be claimed as a matter of right by the\n\nPage 34 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\npetitioners and it is the discretion of the State Government to revise the pension\n\nunless the rules framed mandates for regular revision. In this case, admittedly\n\nthere is no provisions in the pension rules for seeking revision of pension.\n\n30. Admittedly, the revision of pension as far as the workmen category is\n\nconcerned, it is being made on the basis of 12(3) settlements entered between the\n\nparties, in which the managerial staff are not entitled to enter into any settlement,\n\nor avail any benefits. The managerial staff pensioners have to wait for the\n\ndecision of the State Government to constitute the pay commission for the\n\npurpose of complying the process of revision of pension.\n\n31. The clarification Letter No.172/P2/TNSTCEPFT/2005 dated\n\n08.11.2005 written by the Trust Board to the Pensioner's Association would\n\nfurther clarify this aspect and it states that the wage settlement to the workers of\n\nthe State Transport reached during the month of August 2005 with retrospective\n\neffect from 01.09.2003 and the pension also regulated accordingly. Further\n\nreference was made to the letter dated 15.12.2005 by the Government, wherein it\n\nis stated that the instructions have been issued as per the Rule 20(a) of the\n\nPension Fund Rules, which reads as follows:\n\nPage 35 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n1. In respect of pensioners of State Transport Undertakings whose\npay scales are covered under 12(3) settlement at the time of exit\nfrom service, Dearness Allowance may be paid at the variable\nDearness Allowance payable to the employee covered under\n12(3) settlement from time to time.\n\n2. In respect of pensioners who were drawing State Government\nPay Scales and Dearness Allowance at the time of exit from\nservice, the Dearness Allowance may be paid at the rates\napplicable to State Government Pensioners.\n\nIn pursuance of the above orders D.A. To the pensioners are\nbeing regulated as detailed below:\n\n1. In respect of Officers Government Rate of D.A. is being paid.\n\n2. In respect of the workers governed under the 12(3) settlement\nV.D.A have been paid.\n\n3. To the Technical Supervisory Staff to whom a separate wage\nrevision was ordered under reference 2nd cited w.e.f. 01.01.1999\nwith monitory effect from 01.04.1999. To them revised basic Pay\nwas arrived with merger of the amount equivalent to 120 V.D.A\npoints on their existing Pay. Full D.A was paid in respect of\nthem through 120 V.D.A points were merged without reducing\nthe merged points till 7/2004. However, Government in G.O.(D)\nNo.91, Transport, dt.14.07.2004 ordered to regulate the V.D.A in\nrespect of them to avoid double payment for 120 points, since the\nsame was merged with pay and informed to regulate the\nDearness Allowance payable to the employees covered under\n12(3) settlement from time to time as per the Government\ndirections vide reference 1st cited.\n\n4. Subsequently, the VDA to the Administrative Supervisory staff\nwas also regulated from 27.12.2004 on the same lines of the\nTechnical Supervisory Staff.\n\nPage 36 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n32. Further, the above letter continues and narrates the procedures to be\n\nfollowed for regulating the pensions to the workmen category and the\n\nclassification was sought for the following issues:\n\n“Now, the Wage settlement was reached to the employees\nretrospectively from 01.09.2003, by merging the amount equivalent to\n515 V.D.A points with Basic Pay. As this being the first settlement\nreached after introduction of the New Pension Scheme to the employees\nand hence we request the Government to clarify in respect of the\nfollowing issues:\n\n1. On implementation of the wage settlement retrospectively from\n01.09.2003 to the staff the pay was revised in respect of the\nemployees who exit between 01.09.2003 and 31.08.2005. As a\nresult, the pension proposal has to be revised retrospectively\nbased on the re-fixed basic pay.\n\n2. Consequent to the revision of the basic pension, the commutation\nhas to be revised in respect of pensioners i.e., employees exit\nbetween 01.09.2003 and 31.08.2005.\n\n3. To continue to pay the existing rate of V.D.A to the pensioners\nwhose date of exit falls before 01.09.2003 and for the employees/\npensioners whose date of exit falls, on or after 01.09.2003, the\nV.D.A points to be adopted after the merger on 01.09.2003.\n\n4. The minimum pension payable to the family pensioners, will\nremain on the existing level of Rs.1,275/-.”\n\nPage 37 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\n33. The above letter of the Pension Trust was clarified by way of Letter\n\nNo.18496/D/2005-6 dated 16.05.2006, which reads as follows:\n\n“I am directed to invite attention to the reference cited and to\nstate that the pay revision to the employees of STUs is the outcome of\nWage settlement 2005 arrived on Triparty agreement (i.e) Employees\nUnion, Management and Government. Moreover, the arrears of pay\nhas been allowed to serving employees with effect from 01.09.2003.\nIt is, therefore, obligatory to settle the arrears of pension for the\nretired employees also with effect from 01.09.2003. The mode of\npayment on the Pay commission arrears adopted in cases of\nGovernment employees could not be adopted for State Transport\nUndertakings pensioners.\n\n2. In view of the above, I am to request you to adhere the\nfollowing:\n\n(i). The arrears of pension accruing consequent on the Revision of\nPay due to Wage settlement 2005, may be allowed to the pensioners\nof STUs with effect from 01.09.2003.\n\n(ii). The State Transport Undertakings may be instructed that they\nshould not seek for any financial assistance from Government for\nsettlement of arrears of pension in this regard.”\n\n34. After issuing this letter, the Government has decided to merge the\n\nV.D.A paid to the workmen category with the basic pay in the year 2009 and\n\naccordingly, it was decided to pay the basic pension based on the merged V.D.A\n\nfrom 01.10.2007. These facts reveal that from the year 2000 onwards i.e., after\n\nconstitution of the Pension Fund Trust on 01.09.1998, the Government has\n\nPage 38 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nfollowed the system of regulating the pensions of the workmen categories,\n\nwhenever there is a wage settlement. Accordingly, the pension payable was\n\nincreased by adding the V.D.A. Similarly, there is no revision of pension as far as\n\nthe pensioners belonging to the managerial staff cadre, based on settlement\nu/s\n\n12(3)\nof ID Act and their pension was subject to enhancement to the extent on par\n\nwith the enhancement of Dearness Allowance to the Government servants. This\n\nshows that the Government after constituting the Pension Fund Trust has treated\n\nthe managerial staff pensioners as a separate class. Similarly, the workmen\n\ncategory were treated differently while paying the pension benefits and both form\n\na separate class from the date of constituting pension fund. Further, it is also\n\nstated that, managerial staff pensioners constitute only 1% of the cadre strength of\n\nthe pensioners and remaining 99% of the pensioners belongs to workmen\n\ncategory.\n\n35. Though it is stated that the managerial staff have received revision of\n\npension to the extent of 40%, this revision was made in pursuant to the policy\n\ndecision taken by the Government to the extent of revision of pension on par with\n\nthe Government servants that too once in 10 years. Whereas, the workmen\n\ncategory pensioners are receiving V.D.A based on the wage settlement reached\n\nonce in three years. The object for giving 40% of the revision to the managerial\n\nPage 39 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\ncadre pensioners could not be equated with the object of revision made to the\n\nworkmen category. Further at no point of time, the petitioners/ workmen\n\ncategory has questioned the system of paying different types of Dearness\n\nAllowances paid to them, i.e., following V.D.A based on cost of living Index, for\n\nthe purpose of regulating the pension.\n\n36. Further, it is not the case of the petitioners, they were not given any\n\nrevision of Dearness Allowance, admittedly the revision of pension is also made\n\nby merging the Dearness Allowance with the basic pay. Having enjoyed all those\n\npension benefits and when the Government decided to revise the pension for the\n\nretired managerial staff, nearly after eight years from the constitution of the\n\npension fund, levelling allegation that there is discrimination of pension to\n\nworkmen category is not valid.\n\n37. It is also submitted by the Government that since the managerial staff\n\nare constituted only 1% and already there is financial difficulties raised by the\n\nPension Trust and they are seeking financial support to meet out the short fall to\n\npay various types of funds to the pensioners, is also not disputed. If the Pension\n\nTrust is burdened with further revision of pension to the 99% of the workmen\n\ncategory, it would cause huge financial implication, hence we are of the view that\n\nPage 40 of 42\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 29/12/2025 04:33:05 pm )\nW.A.(MD).Nos.82 and 888 of 2023 and W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015\n\nthe classification and revision made for the managerial staff is neither arbitrary\n\nnor irrational and the relief prayed by the petitioners herein could not be\n\nconsidered and same is not having any merits and the same is liable to be\n\nrejected.\n\n38. Accordingly, the writ appeals and writ petitions are dismissed.\n\nConsequently, connected civil and writ miscellaneous petitions stand closed.\n\n(G.R.S.,J.)
