They are eligible to\n\nparticipate in the process of Post-Graduate admission Degree and\n\nDiploma.\nThe Petitioners, after passing the MBBS examination and\n\nbased upon the then existing policies of the State of Maharashtra have\n\njoined the services of the State of Maharashtra/ Local Authorities/\n\nCorporation (for short \"the State\") for many years, as averred in the\n\nrespective Petitions. Some of them have been in service till this date.\n\nFor the purpose of their service record and future career, they are\n\ntreated as \"Medical Officer\" in various tribal, interior, naxalite and\n\ndifficult areas of the State of various Government Hospitals, Primary\n\nHealth Centers (PHC) and Clinics. (For these admission referred to as\n\n\"In-service candidates).\n\n4 Though we are concerned with the admission to the\n\nMedical Post Graduate Degree Courses (MD/MS) of academic year\n\n17/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 18 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n2014-2015, it is required to go back to the State circulars/policies (for\n\nshort, GR) dated 6 January 1990, by which it was declared and\n\nannounced that 15% seats for Post Graduate Degree Course (the\n\nDegree Course) and 25% seats for Post Graduate Diploma Course (the\n\nDiploma Course) were reserved for in-service candidates, as and by\n\nway of providing candidates an incentive to serve in the\n\nHospitals/PHC as referred above, throughout the Maharashtra State.\n\nThe students/candidates based upon the same have been acting upon\n\nregularly and so also the concerned Respondents.\n\n5 The State Government issued another notification on 22\n\nFebruary 1996 by which, the reservation for Post-Graduate Decree\n\nCourse increased to 25% in place of 15%. The reservation of 25%\n\nfor Post Graduate Diploma Course, kept intact. There is no much\n\nquarrel with regard to the existence of these two recognized sources\n\nfor in-service candidates for the purpose of participating and/or\n\napplying for such Post Graduate Course, subject to the conditions of\n\nthose circulars.\n\n6 The necessity and need of this incentive/weightage has\n\n18/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 19 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nbeen well recognized, accepted and appreciated by all. This also mean\n\nand read as a consistent representation by the State, as they intended\n\nto achieve various purposes, apart from giving practical experiences to\n\nthese medical students/officers to utilize their services for the people\n\nin rural areas. The State therefore, able to provide medical services to\n\nthe needy patient of all strata. Merely because students after\n\ncompleting their MBBS Degree have been working with the State,\n\nthese candidates therefore, never intended that they would be\n\ncontinuing in service on the basis of MBBS Degree throughout their\n\nlife. Their future avenue for the higher study is not barred for the\n\nspecial Degree Course. The whole purpose of weightage/incentive, is\n\nalways meant and treated as an additional factor for them to proceed\n\nfurther and/or to pursue their higher study as and when and\n\nwhenever possible.\n\n7 The Apex Court has recognized this in-service class, as a\n\nclass for the purpose of providing weightage/benefits as recorded\n\nabove. They are in-service and/or in-service candidates, therefore,\n\nare not prevented and/or restricted from taking their higher education\n\nof their choice. The weightage/incentive for the Post Graduate Degree\n\n19/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 20 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nand/or Post Graduate Course, as recorded above, itself means that the\n\nGovernment throughout intended and wanted such Medical Officers to\n\nwork and/or render their services in the areas referred above, apart\n\nfrom getting extra weightage/higher education, besides the Common\n\nEntrance examination marks.\n\n8 To add to that, the State again represented by another\n\ncircular dated 3 May 2011, specifying the minimum number of years\n\nof service as an entitlement for the Post Graduate Degree and\n\nDiploma. The strict condition of the compulsory bond and/or penalty\n\nclause in case of default of Rs.50 lacs is also circulated and imposed\n\nupon, whosoever wants to pursue their study and/or career through\n\ntheir channels. Everything was in order for such candidates. There\n\nwas amended regulation of 2009 (17 November 2009) to the Medical\n\nCouncil Regulation 2000 of Medical Council of India (for short, MCI)\n\nin the field whereby, the restriction was imposed to have 50%\n\nreservation for the Post Graduate Diploma Course. Nothing\n\nmentioned about the Post-Graduate Degree Course. The amended\n\nMCI regulation of 50% quota to in-service candidates was on record\n\neven on 20 October 2008.\n\n20/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 21 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n9 The State therefore, knowing fully the effect of MCI\n\nRegulations under the\nIndian Medical Council Act\n(for short, the\nIMC\n\nAct\n) proceeded to continue with 25% seats for Diploma and for\n\nDegree Courses for in-service candidates, practically every year.\n\nThroughout the State, based upon the same, the respective\n\nstudents/officers have opted as per the declaration and joined and\n\ncompleted the Degree Courses. There is nothing on record to show\n\nthat the MCI and/or such body, at any point of time, taken any\n\ndecision and/or passed any order against the State and/or any other\n\nState, principally because, this has nothing to do with \"the standard of\n\neducation\" and/or \"qualification\", for which they are empowered to\n\nregulate and control the education and its institutions.\n\n10 We are not concerned in these cases any constitutional\n\nreservation issues and/or any such policy. The incentive/weightage so\n\ndeclared and announced is always in addition to the Constitutional\n\nReservation as contemplated under\nArticles 15\n, 16\nand other\n\nprovisions. We are also not dealing with the rights and/or aspects of\n\nminority institutions as contemplated under\nArticles 29\nand\nof the\n\n21/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 22 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n11 There was issue even based upon the policy so declared by\n\nthe Government to what extent the reservation should be extended for\n\nDiploma/Degree Courses. Some students/candidates therefore, filed\n\nWrit Petition No. 5214 of 2012 (\nDr. Vaishali Dilip Pawar & Ors. Vs.\n\nThe Director of Medical Education and Research, (CET Cell) &\n\nOrs.\n) in this High Court. Even on that day the 2009 MCI regulation\n\nwas in force. There was no issue whatsoever with regard to the\n\npercentage of providing seats only to the Diploma and not to the\n\nDegree Courses. The issue was with regard to the modality, which the\n\nState should follow and consider for these two courses.\n\nThe Division\n\nBench of this Court by Judgment dated 5 July 2012, in\nDr. Vaishali\n\n(supra) after considering the various facets of Post Graduate\n\nadmissions has recorded as under:-\n\n\"4 In order to understand the grievance of the\nPetitioners, it would be necessary to advert briefly to the\n\nfactual position. In the State of Maharashtra, medical\ncolleges fall into three categories : (i) Government Medical\nColleges; (ii) Medical Colleges conducted by the Municipal\nCorporations; and (iii) Medical Colleges of private\ninstitutions including deemed universities. The in service\nquota to which the present proceedings relate is the quota\nthat is available for candidates in the service of the\nGovernment of Maharashtra and are desirous of pursuing\n\n22/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:40 :::\n\nssm 23 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\npostgraduate degree or diploma courses. There is a\nsimilar quota for municipal employees in colleges\nconducted by Municipal Corporation(s) with which the\n\npresent proceeding is not concerned. Of the total number\nof postgraduate seats, 50% are allocated to the All India\n\nquota. For the balance of the available seats, a Common\nEntrance Test is conducted. A separate merit list is\nprepared for in service candidates who are also required\nto appear for the CET. There are 23 subjects in which\n\npostgraduate degree courses are available in the State, but\ninsofar as the Government Medical Colleges are\nconcerned, only 21 subjects are available. These subjects\nfall into two categories viz. (i) clinical subjects involving\n\ncontact between the patient and the doctor such as\nmedicine, surgery, pediatrics and gynecology. There are\n\n13 such subjects; (ii) Non-clinical subjects. The State\nGovernment has taken the position that for in service\ncandidates, the 13 clinical subjects are of relevance\n\nbecause in service candidates are obliged to continue in\ngovernment service after passing their postgraduate\nexaminations. Consequently the reservation of 25% for in\nservice candidates is applied after excluding seats\n\nallocated to the all India quota and non-clinical\n\npostgraduate seats. Presently a total of 237 seats in\ngovernment colleges were available for degree courses in\nclinical subjects, of which 59 have been allotted to in\nservice candidates. For diploma courses, of the total\n\nnumber of 96 seats, 24 are available for in service\ncandidates.\n\n5 The submission of the Petitioners is that the\n\nrationale for the Government Resolution dated 22\nFebruary 1996 and as noted in the earlier Government\nResolution dated 24 October 1991, is the need to provide\nan incentive for candidates to enter government service\nafter completing their M.B.B.S. Since medical graduates\nare unwilling to do so, government service was sought to\nbe incentivised by setting apart a certain proportion of\nseats for in service candidates to pursue their\n\n23/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 24 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\npostgraduate studies either for a degree or diploma.\nHence, it has been submitted that bearing in mind the\naforesaid justification, there is no reason to exclude 50%\n\nseats of the all India quota and seats in non-clinical\nsubjects, while working out the reservation for in service\n\ncandidates. As noted earlier, the reservation for in service\ncandidates was increased to 25% by a Government\nResolution dated 22 February 1996.\n\n6 ....\n\n7 However, we find that there is a lack of clarity on\nthe part of the government in the sense that it would have\n\nbeen appropriate for the government to come out with a\ncomprehensive Government Resolution setting out the\n\nbasis on which the reservation of 25% for in service\ncandidates should be worked out. Since that has not been\ndone, candidates are left in a state of uncertainty of the\n\nmanner in which the reservation for in service candidates\nwould be implemented. This is an unsatisfactory state of\naffairs. As we have noted earlier, even this Court was\nconsiderably handicapped without the Government\n\nResolution dated 24 October 1991 being placed before it.\nThough the hearing of the Petition was adjourned on\n\nmore than one occasion, that Government Resolution was\nnot forthcoming. The Court has now been informed that\nadmissions for postgraduate degree and diploma courses\n\nhad been completed and there are no vacant seats for in\nservice candidates.\n\n8 In this view of the matter, we consider it appropriate\nto direct that in order to obviate the situation that has\n\noccurred for the present year, the State Government shall\ncome out with a Government Resolution specifying the\nmanner in which the reservation for in service candidates\nshall be worked out from the next academic year. We\nwould expect that this exercise should be completed\nexpeditiously and well in time, so that in service\ncandidates for whom the reservation is intended to act as\n\n24/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 25 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nan incentive, are not left in a state of uncertainty. The\nPetition is accordingly disposed of.\"\n\n12 There is nothing even suggested and/or even argued with\n\nregard to the restriction of 50% for Diploma Course only in 2009 MCI\n\nRegulation. The Division Bench of this Court directed the State to\n\ncome out with a GR, specifying the manner in which the reservation\n\nfor in-service candidates should be worked out from the next academic\n\nyear.\n\n13 On 24 November 2012, without complying with the orders\n\nand directions given by this Court, the State Government proceeded\n\nfor common entrance test. There is nothing on record to show and\n\nsuggested that the State have challenged these two orders, at any\n\npoint of time and/or till this date.\n\n14 On 20 June 2013, in Writ Petition No. 5290 of 2013 this\n\nCourt by an interim order directed not to proceed with the select list\n\ntill 25 June 2013, (later on vacated also) and prayed to apply\n\nResolution dated 22 February 1996. The modality and the manner\n\nwas only the issue. The reference was also made to the earlier\n\n25/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 26 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nJudgment. The Respondent-State issued a State quota for Post-\n\nGraduate Courses by notification dated 13 June 2013.\n\n15 This Court again by order dated 4 July 2013 dealing with\n\nthe distribution and reservation of the seats, including in-service\n\ncandidates for Degree and Diploma Courses, by referring to the earlier\n\njudgment of\nDivision Bench, Dr. Vaishali\n(Supra) (Writ Petition No.\n\n5214 of 2012) dated 5 July 2012, again reiterated and directed the\n\nState in the following words:-\n\n\"4. The Common Entrance Test was held on\n24/11/2012. One would have expected that in view of\nthe directions given by Division Bench of this Court, the\nGovernment would have acted well in time and it ought to\n\nhave issued the appropriate Resolution as per the\ndirections given by this Court. However, unfortunately, no\n\nResolution was issued either prior to 24/11/2012 or\nimmediately thereafter. The Government however has\nissued two Resolutions, the first Resolution is dated\n\n21/6/2013 and the other Resolution dated 2/7/2013 in\nwhich totally new stand has been taken by the State\nGovernment.\n\n5 Without going into factual aspect as to what\n\ndecision has been taken by the Government in the first\nResolution dated 21/6/2013 and second Resolution dated\n2/7/2013, in our view, it would be appropriate to direct\nas an interim measure that since the Government has not\nissued the Resolution well in time as directed by Division\nBench of this Court, the position which prevailed prior to\nthe judgment of Division Bench of this Court (Coram:-\n\n26/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 27 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nDr.D.Y. Chandrachud & R.D. Dhanuka, JJ) dated\n5/7/2012 should prevail after this order. The interim\nstay which has been granted by this Court by order dated\n\n20/6/2013 is vacated. Further process of admissions\nshould commence.\n\n6 So far as the effect of two Resolutions viz. Resolution\ndated 21/6/2013 and 2/7/2013 is concerned, the same\ncan be taken into consideration at the final hearing of this\n\nPetition. Petition shall be heard and disposed of finally at\nthe stage of admission. Further affidavit in reply,\nrejoinder to be filed within eight weeks from today.\"\n\nThe matters were kept thereafter for final disposal. Now\n\nlisted accordingly.\n\n16 In pending Writ Petition No. 5290 of 2013, as recorded\n\nabove, on 4 July 2013, this Court has again directed the State to\n\nconsider and distribute the seats based upon the then existing\n\nreservation policy and specially 1990/1996 qua Degree and Diploma\n\nCourse in question.\n\n17 The issue is that on 21 June 2013, the State again\n\nreiterated their own stand and 25% seats in each category reserved for\n\nin-service candidates after excluding the seats of all India quota. On 2\n\nJuly 2013, the State for the first time relying on the Clause 9 (1)(b)\n\n27/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 28 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nRegulation of the MCI and increased the Post-Graduate Diploma\n\nCourse to 50% for in-service candidates, who are serving in remote\n\nand difficult areas.\n\n18 Strikingly, in Resolution dated 21 June 2013, the State in\n\npreamble referred and mentioned the decision of this Court dated 5\n\nJuly 2012 Dr. Vaishali\n(supra). By this Resolution, they have\n\nsuperseded the earlier Resolution dated 22 February 1996.\n\n19 The State (Medical Education Department) within two\n\nweeks issued another impugned resolution dated 2 July 2013. Even in\n\n2 July 2013 G.R., reference was made to the order passed by the\n\nDivision Bench in\nDr. Vaishali\n(Supra) dated 5 July 2012, though\n\nthey referred also 2009 MCI Regulation. The reservation increased in\n\nrespect of the Post-Graduate Diploma Course to 50% to in-service\n\ncandidates. In this background, this Court on 4 July 2013, in a way\n\nstayed the implementation of GR dated 21 June 2013 and 2 July 2013\n\nand directed the State for the purpose of continuing the admission\n\nprocess, to follow the earlier two GRs of prior to 15 July 2012. It is\n\nrelevant to note that, till academic year 2012-2013, the State (Public\n\n28/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 29 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nHealth Department) followed 6 January 1990 and 22 February 1996\n\nGRs/policy.\n\n20 On 28 November 2013, the brochure of 2014 was\n\npublished on the website by the Director of Medical Education and\n\nDrugs Department and Research (DMER), in which clause 7.1\n\nannounced that the seats will be distributed as per the GR dated 2\n\nJuly 2013. At this stage, it is relevant to note that the confusion and\n\nrepresentation made to the people at large and specifically the\n\nconcerned students, with regard to the seats distribution for PGM-CET-\n\n2014, which reads as under:-\n\n\"NOTICE\n\nIn the PGM-CET 2014 brochure it is mentioned that the\nIn-service quota shall be 50% of all diploma seats in\nGovernment Medical College after excluding All India\n\nQuota. Accordingly, seat position & category wise\ndistribution (excluding all India Quota & In-service\nQuota).....\n\nHowever it is requested by DHS that the In-service Quota\n\nshall be 25% of diploma & 25% of Degree seats as it was\ngiven since many years. Accordingly the seal position &\ncategory wise distribution (excluding all India Quota &\nIn-service Quota)......\n\nPGM CET 2014 - category wise seal distribution of\nprivate Unaided Medical College excluding Management\nQuota.....\"\n\n29/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 30 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n21 The representation was continued with regard to the\n\nseparate reservation of candidates from all the purposes, so also GR\n\ndated 3 May 2011, about the incentive and weightage. The website\n\nitself, in addition to the brochure in question i.e. Regulation for\n\nadmission mentioned that the distribution of seats shall be either as\n\nper GR dated 2 July 2013 and/or as per the requisites received from\n\nthe DHS prevailing the earlier 25% reservation for Diploma and 25%\n\nfor Degree for the Post Graduate.\n\n22 Such confusion was continued and as there was no\n\ncommunication whatsoever, the Petitioners filed Writ Petition No.\n\n1937 of 2014 on 20 February 2014. On 21 February 2014, by tagging\n\nall these Writ Petitions, this Court has granted the relief on the\n\nstatement made by the learned Government Pleader appearing for the\n\nState-Respondents. In view of this, the selection list not\n\ndeclared/published till this date. The statement again made and\n\nrecorded in the order itself that they would like to consider the\n\nrepresentation made by the Petitioners (Medical Officers) to restore\n\nthe declared 50% for the Degree Course also. We have granted the\n\n30/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 31 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ntime accordingly.\n\n23 Importantly, the respective contesting relevant\n\ndepartments of the State of Maharashtra are not in agreement with\n\neach other to grant 50% seats only for Diploma Holders and to take\n\naway the reservation seats of Degree Courses, in question. The State\n\nhas issued clarification letter dated 1 March 2014 for the same.\nThis Court on 12 March 2014, therefore, recorded as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"1] Writ Petition No.2402 of 2014 is not on board,\nmentioned. Taken on board.\n\n2] All these matters are heard in view of the\n\nurgency expressed. The learned GP appearing for the\nState of Maharashtra, who is contesting party,\nsubmitted that the Medical Education and Drugs\n\nDepartment, State of Maharashtra insisting that no\nseats would be made available to the in service\nMedical Officers (MBBS Degree holders) in\nGovernment Hospital for the Post Graduation Degree\nCourses. That decision as alleged based upon the\n\nResolution/Policy of MCI (MCI Regulations 2000).\n\n2] However, the Public Health Department (State\nof Maharashtra) seriously contending that the said\nPolicy is not in the interest of Medical Officers\nworking in Health Department. Therefore, there is a\nclear conflict within the Department itself of the State\nof Maharashtra.\n\n31/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 32 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n3] Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners\n\nin Writ Petition No.1937 of 2014 pointed out, apart\n\nfrom other judgments, a recent judgment in case of\nChristian Medical College Vellore & ors. Vs. Union of\n\nIndia, where according to them a Medical Council of\nIndia Regulations of 2000 has substantially\nsuperseded and therefore in view of the decision, the\npresent Government Circular/Resolution whereby, the\n\nMedical Officers (MBBS Degree Holders) rights have\nbeen taken away, need to be tested/considered.\nTherefore, in view of above, at this stage, we are\ninclined to grant one week time, as a last chance, to\n\nresolve the dispute/conflict so\nreferred above\n. Stand\nover to 18.3.2014, high on board.\n\n4] Interim relief, based upon the statement made,\nto continue till then.\"\n\nThe interim order so passed based upon the statement\n\nmade is still continues.\n\n25 The State (Public Health Department) deals with providing\n\nmedical services to tribal and non-tribal or rural area in Maharashtra.\n\nThey have mechanism to appoint/select specialists which are required\n\nfor the community. All, inspite of bonds, are not joining rural services.\n\nOnce the in-service candidates joined Post-Graduate Degree Course,\n\nthey would have no choice but to join such services after post\n\ngraduation also. No reason to restrict only for Diploma Course, by\n\n32/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 33 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\noverlooking the importance of Degree Courses and need of speciality\n\nservices. Nothing on record to show that the State's Public Health\n\nDepartment was even consented for the sudden change. This itself\n\nshows non-application of mind by the Public Health Department of the\n\nState , apart from needs of the community. It is certainly not within\n\nthe domain and authority of the State. In Writ Petition No. 2019 of\n\n2014, Dr. Jayant C. Parwate and ors. (Supra), for above supporting\n\nmaterial is placed on record, which also remained uncontroverted.\n\nThe following observations made in\nChristian Medical College\n\nVellore & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n1 supports the case of Public\n\nHealth Department, requirement of Degree avenue for in-service\n\ncandidates also. It noway eliminates the right and entitlement of the\n\nPetitioners and so also the requirement of special doctors, degree\n\nholders in rural areas. The relevant paragraph reads as under:-\n\n\"176. There can be no controversy that the standard\nof education all over the country is not the same. Each State\nhas its own system and pattern of education, including the\nmedium of instruction. It cannot also be disputed that\n\nchildren in the metropolitan areas enjoy greater privileges\nthan their counterparts in most of the rural areas as far as\neducation is concerned, and the decision of the Central\nGovernment to support a single entrance examination\nwould perpetuate such divide in the name of giving credit to\nmerit. In a single window competition, the disparity in\n\n1 (2014) 2 S.C.C. 305\n\n33/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 34 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\neducational standards in different parts of the country\ncannot ensure a level playing field. The practice of medicine\nentails something more than brilliance in academics, it\n\nrequires a certain commitment to serve humanity. India has\nbrilliant doctors of great merit, who are located mostly in\n\nurban areas and whose availability in a crisis is quite\nuncertain. What is required to provide health care to the\ngeneral masses and particularly those in the rural areas,\nare committed physicians who are on hand to respond to a\n\ncrisis situation. Given the large number of people who live\nin the villages in difficult conditions, the country today has\nmore need of such doctors who may not be specialists, but\nare available as general physicians to treat those in need of\n\nmedical care and treatment in the far-flung areas of the\ncountry, which is the essence of what was possibly envisaged\n\nby the Framers of the Constitution in including\nArticle 30\nin\nPart III of the Constitution. The desire to give due\nrecognition to merit is laudable, but the pragmatic realities\n\non the ground relating to health care, especially in the rural\nand tribal areas where a large section of the Indian\npopulation resides, have also to be kept in mind when\npolicy decisions are taken in matters such as this. While the\n\ncountry certainly needs brilliant doctors and surgeons and\n\nspecialists and others connected with health care, who are\nequal to any in other parts of the world, considering ground\nrealities, the country also has need for \"barefoot doctors\",\nwho are committed and are available to provide medical\n\nservices and health care facilities in different areas as part\nof their mission in becoming doctors.\"\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n26 Importantly, in all these new matters the Respondents have\n\nnot filed any reply till this date, though time was granted on various\n\noccasions. There is urgency in view of the case so\nreferred above\n,\n\n34/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 35 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\napart from the interim order passed by this Court. Only in Writ\n\nPetition No. 5290 of 2013, a reply was filed prior to order passed by\n\nthis Court on 4 July 2013.\n\n27 On 12 March, 2014, this Court again granted one more\n\nopportunity and adjourned the matter, so that the Chief Secretary\n\nand/or the State/Higher Authority can take a decision in the matter,\n\nin view of clear conflict between two relevant State Departments. It is\n\nnot because there is a conflict between the Departments, but it is\n\nbecause, if the State has a power to change a policy/decision, it\n\ncannot be on the basis of such shaky foundation in view of conflict of\n\nviews between the concerned Departments itself.\n\n28 There cannot be any dispute with regard to the power and\n\nauthority of the State Government and/or such authority to take\n\ndecision. But should be based upon the sufficient and clear material\n\nand specifically when it is a question of change in alleged policy of\n\nabolishing the reservation of 25% for Degree courses, based upon the\n\nalleged (17 November 2009) Clause 9(3) of MCI Regulation. The\n\namendment itself recognized the requirement of in-service seats,\n\n35/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 36 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthough insistence made for Diploma Course only.\n\n29 The conflict between the two departments itself shows that\n\nthey themselves are not sure before taking such a drastic decision to\n\nabruptly change the long standing policy. The Respondent-State to\n\nimplement and/or to abrupt change of policy, definitely required\n\nsufficient material and the circumstances in the interest of people at\n\nlarge.\n\n30 The conflict between the two departments that they\n\nthemselves are not sure which part of the policy prior and/or new is in\n\nthe interest of public at large. Normally, the scope of writ jurisdiction\n\nis very limited so also the power of judicial review, but when it goes to\n\nroot of deciding the action and/or inaction of the State, even with\n\nregard to the change in distribution of seats, thereby completely\n\nrestricted the admission of the students/Medical Officers for the\n\nDegree Course, it is revocable.\n\n31 We are not deciding and/or neither there is an argument\n\nmade that the other reservation so granted, qua diploma and/or open\n\n36/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 37 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncandidates and/or All India Quota, are bad in law. The restrictive\n\nsubmission is the change of policy decision, as alleged only with\n\nregard to the students/Medical Officers, who wants to and/or who are\n\nin a given case, could have opted for the Degree Course. There is no\n\nmuch issue with regard to the rights and entitlement of in-service\n\ncandidates. The class is recognized and accepted by all and so also its\n\nAuthorities. There is no even change to that effect in the rules.\n\nTherefore, there is no reason to deal with the requirement and/or\n\nexistence of in-service clause/sources so created in so many years.\n\nThe restriction so put up without assessing or discussing anything\n\nsuddenly, is an additional factor as there are apparently absent from\n\nthe preamble and/or impugned circulars/notification. Though the\n\nreference is made to the earlier order of this Court\nDr. Vaishali\n\n(Supra), they overlooked and misinterpreted the judgment. The state\n\nrelied upon those 2009 Regulations in support of their change in\n\nstand. This sudden and abrupt decision by overlooking the pending\n\nPetitions and decisions given by this Court, definitely required to be\n\ntested under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n32 The learned Government Pleader appearing for the State ,\n\n37/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 38 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nin his argument submitted that those concerned 2009 MCI Regulations\n\neven if any, are directory only to this extent of distribution of in-\n\nservice seats between Diploma and Degree Course. We are not\n\nconcerned with ongoing procedure or qualification and/or percentage\n\nof marks. Even these medical regulations recognizes the importance\n\nof percentage and weightage for in-service candidates. We are also\n\nnot concerned with infrastructure or teaching standard of medical\n\neducation. The MCI or such authority cannot control admission\n\nprocedure or take away the rights or power of the State to frame\n\nadmission rules and distribution of seats as per requirement. Those\n\n2007/2000 regulations are in doubts and questioned. The learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the MCI and other Petitioners of open\n\ncandidates category however, referring to various Supreme Court\n\nJudgments and observations submitted that those are mandatory. The\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the Petitioners referring to the Supreme\n\nCourt\nJudgment Christian Medical College\n(Supra) and even\n\nreferring to the relevant notifications under the\nIndian Medical\n\nCouncil Act\n(for short, \"the\nIMC Act\n\") including the subsequent\n\nnotifications, (amending the 2000 MCI Regulations) pointed out that\n\n2009 Regulations are superseded and/or cannot be relied upon by the\n\n38/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 39 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nState, in view of subsequent Regulation of 15 February 2012 w.e.f. 27\n\nFebruary 2012.\n\n33 The reference to Clause 9(b) of 2009 Regulation dated 17\n\nNovember 2009 in the State Resolution by overlooking subsequent\n\nregulations and/or effect of the Supreme Court\nJudgment Christian\n\nMedical College\n(Supra) on the same, is an another factor. The State\n\nhas taken this decision by not applying its minds, not only to the\n\ndirect Judgments passed by this High Court but also to the Supreme\n\nCourt. They have changed the policy stating it to be in the interest of\n\nDiploma Course only. There is no challenge so far as the MCI\n\nRegulations to the extent of insistence for 50% reservation only for\n\nDiploma. Even if there is any insistence so referred, in no way\n\naccepted and/or followed even by the State till the impugned\n\ncirculars/policy. The MCI Regulations, even if we read, no way\n\nrestricted and/or debar that there should be no reservation\n\nwhatsoever for Degree Course. It is relevant to note that we are not\n\ndealing with the \"standard of education\" and/or \"qualification issue\"\n\nand \"Constitutional reservation\". It is legally recognized two sources,\n\nfor the Post-Graduate Courses. The restriction so imposed by this\n\n39/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 40 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nnotification/the circulars of the State only for the Post-Graduate\n\nDegree Course, therefore needs to be tested on the touch-stone of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n34 There cannot be any issue so far as the State's rights to\n\nframe or change the State policy or such Regulation. The admission\n\nrules flows from\nArticle 162\nread with entry 25, 26 of the list III,\n\nsubject to entry 66 Scheduled VII, List I of the Constitution of India.\n\nBut, at the same stroke, it is difficult to overlook all these provisions\n\nwhich entitled and/or empowered the State and/or MCI to control\n\nand/or regulate, even the admission process of this nature, all are\n\n\"subject to\" other Constitutional provisions. This definitely includes,\n\nArticle 14\n, as well as, the\nArticle 41\nof the Constitution of India. The\n\nconcept \"subject to\" is discussed by this Court in National Seed\n\nAssociation of India & Anr. Vs. The State of Maharashtra & Ors. 2 .\n\nThe relevant portion of the same reads as under:-\n\n\"23 .......\n\n18.\nIn\nK.R.C.S. Balakrishna Chetty & Sons & Co. v.\nState of Madras\n, this Court was interpreting Section\nof the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 in which\nthe words \"subject to\" were used by the legislature.\n\n2 2014 (1) Mh.L.J. 34\n\n40/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 41 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nThis Court held that the use of words \"subject to\" had\nreference to effectuating the intention of law and the\ncorrect meaning of the expression was \"conditional\n\nupon\". To the same effect is the decision of this Court\nin South India Corpn. (P) Ltd. v. Board of Revenue\n\nwhere this Court held that the expression \"subject to\"\n\nconveyed the idea of a provision yielding place to\nanother provision or other provisions to which it is\nmade subject.\n\n19. ....\n\n20.\nIn\nB.S. Vadera v. Union of India\nthis Court\n\ninterpreted the words \"subject to the provisions of any\nAct\", appearing in the proviso to\nArticle 309\nand\n\nobserved: AIR p. 124, para 24),\n\n\"24. It is also significant to note that the\n\nproviso to\nArticle 309\n, clearly lays down\nthat 'any rules so made shall have effect,\nsubject to the provisions of any such Act'.\n\nThe clear and unambiguous expressions,\n\nused in the Constitution, must be given\ntheir full and unrestricted meaning unless\n\nhedged in, by any limitations. The rules,\nwhich have to be 'subject to the provisions\nof the Constitution', shall have effect,\n\n'subject to the provisions of any such Act'.\n\nThat is, if the appropriate legislature has\npassed an Act, under\nArticle 309\n, the rules,\nframed under the proviso, will have effect,\nsubject to that Act; but, in the absence of\n\nany Act, of the appropriate legislature, on\nthe matter, in our opinion, the rules, made\nby the President or by such person as he\nmay direct, are to have (full) effect, both\nprospectively and retrospectively.\"\n\n21. ...\n\n41/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 42 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n22. There is in the light of the above decisions no\ngainsaying that Section of the Act is by reason of the\nuse of the words \"subject to the provisions of\nSection\n\" made subordinate to the provisions of\nSection 31\n.\nThe question whether an appeal would lie and if so in\n\nwhat circumstances cannot, therefore, be answered\nwithout looking into\nSection 31\nand giving it primacy\nover the provisions of\nSection 30\n. That is precisely the\nobject which the expression \"subject to the provisions\n\nof\nSection 31\n\" appearing in\nSection 30(1)\nintends to\nachieve.\n\nThis itself means that the State Legislature is empowered\n\nto enact laws even if it falls within the ambit of Concurrent\nList. However, it is \"subject to\" the Central enactment's\n\nprovisions. The State, therefore, is competent to enact the\nlaws after taking note of above provisions. The State\nLegislature, therefore, if enacts laws for the respective State\n\nbased upon the need and to achieve the object revolving\naround the State conditions and in the interest of\nparticular class or community, in the present case\nconsumer/farmer/agriculturist the issue of repugnancy\n\nand/or inconsistency even if any, need to be tested on the\nbasis of actual comparisons of the respective provisions of\n\nCentral as well as State enactments. The comparison itself\nrequires the existence of two conflicting laws.\"\n\nThere is no repugnancy and/or conflict of any power by\n\nthe State. In the present case as it is prerogative of State to frame\n\nPost-Graduate admission rules in question, based upon the declared\n\npolicy. The State's power and authority flowing from\nArticle 162\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India, is also \"subject to\" all other constitutional\n\nobligations and provisions including the boundaries of\nArticles 14\n\nand\n41.\n\n42/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 43 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n35 The facet of\nArticle 14\nincludes the reasonable\n\nclassification. For whatever may be the reason, at this stage, in view\n\nof their own conflicts in between the two departments, it is sufficient\n\nto observe that as they themselves are not clear to implement and/or\n\nnot to implement, therefore, they have clearly taken shelter of 2009\n\nMCI Regulation and tried to justify their abrupt stand. The rights of\n\nthe Petitioners to opt for Degree, if curtailed by such decision, they\n\nought to have provided with the reason and/or the decision. They\n\ncannot act abruptly and discriminately by taking away the rights of in-\n\nservice candidates, to have an option of higher Degree Courses and/or\n\nspecialized courses in the field but kept open avenue only for Diploma\n\nCourse.\n\n36 At this stage, it is necessary to observe that every student,\n\none who passed MBBS examination, though they are treated as\n\nMedical Officer \"in-service candidate\", their rights and entitlement to\n\nhave a higher study of their choice, just cannot be curtailed in such\n\nfashion without even giving sufficient time and/or notices. We are\n\nreferring to this notices and intimation in the present facts and\n\n43/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 44 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncircumstances for the simple reason that even pending these Petitions,\n\nit was pointed out that the State would like to consider the\n\nrepresentation made by the Petitioners. One Department is not\n\nagreeing with the another department, therefore, it is difficult for\n\nthem to file reply even to these Petitions. Sudden decisions, therefore,\n\nas taken, in my view, cannot be stated to be within the State\n\nGovernment powers/domain and even if they have such powers,\n\nrequired to be and are liable to be tested. In the present case, it\n\ndifficult to accept that it is well within the framework of law and the\n\nRegulations apart from their long standing and consistent\n\nrepresentation/circulars. The State, for want of specific challenge\n\ncannot take away the seats of in-service candidates, on the foundation\n\nof \"Reservation for in-service candidates affect also the open seats\n\nwhich are available to meritorious students\". This is contrary to their\n\nown circulars and other clauses of the impugned circular.\n\n37 It is necessary here to note again that the State under the\n\nConstitution itself required to provide all resources to all the\n\nconcerned for the education. When we deal with the rights of\n\neducation and which just cannot be restricted in such fashion by any\n\n44/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 45 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nauthority including the State and/or MCI to insist for arbitrarily\n\ndirected avenue to these in-service candidates only for Diploma. The\n\nsituation is, the person who have based upon the original consistency\n\ndeclared policy since 1990, proceeded and actually acted upon by\n\njoining the services with clear intention to get the weightage/incentive\n\nso declared, the impugned order/action, therefore, even not taken\n\ncare of such situation and/or rights of such candidates. The\n\nsubmission that even Diploma holders have an avenue for higher\n\neducation including Ph.D is of no assistance, when the avenue of\n\nDegree Course and/or Specialized Course in fact recognized and acted\n\nupon by the students/Petitioners like person, including the State.\n\n38 The effect of this policy, if we accept, means hereinafter\n\nthe representation is given to the students at large and basically when\n\nwe are dealing with the medical education, where right from a\n\npreliminary examination, the student decides and determines to\n\nproceed in the particular field of medicines. The specialized doctors\n\nand/or specialized Degree holders and their demand in the society,\n\njust cannot be overlooked. Whatever the material, the State cannot\n\ncompel such in-service candidates to join and/or avail avenue of\n\n45/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 46 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nDiploma only. It was never contemplated and/or even represented, till\n\nthey completed the basic course, which now entitled them, as of right,\n\nto claim weightage/incentive.\n\n39 For the students and/or the Medical Officers and\n\nwhosoever wants to go to higher study, there is always a competition.\n\nThe level of competition, because of various reason, is to the extent\n\neven to one or two marks, that changes their career and life. The\n\nstudents after taking note of incentive/weightage, read with own\n\nintellectual capacity, if has decided to go through the declared\n\nchannel, which is permissible policy in law, and they acted accordingly,\n\nso also the State by providing them incentive, including requisite\n\npayment at the relevant time and facilities as they were working and\n\nrendering their services in the rural areas, now to say that the State\n\nhas power to change the policy at any time, and no one should\n\ninterfere and/or entertain and/or interfere with the domain of\n\ngovernment, in my view, is unacceptable from the point of view of the\n\nPetitioners' crystalized rights and entitlement.\n\n40 The Supreme Court, in Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited\n\n46/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 47 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nVs. Union of India & Ors. 3 recently and even otherwise recognized\n\nthe doctrine of \"Legitimate Expectation\" \"Promissory Estoppel\" to\n\nmean and read and include \"rule of law\", \"trust\". The relevant\n\nprinciples are as under:-\n\n\"1. The doctrine of legitimate expectation can be invoked\n\nas a substantive and enforceable right.\n\n2. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is founded on\nthe principle of reasonableness and fairness. The doctrine\n\narises out of principles of natural justice and there are\nparallels between the doctrine of legitimate expectation and\n\npromissory estoppel.\n\n3. Where the decision of an authority is founded in public\n\ninterest as per executive policy or law, the court would be\nreluctant to interfere with such decision by invoking doctrine\nof legitimate expectation. The legitimate expectation doctrine\ncannot be invoked to fetter changes in administrative policy\n\nif it is in the public interest to do so.\n\n4. The legitimate expectation is different from\nanticipation and an anticipation cannot amount to an\nassertable expectation. Such expectation should be\njustifiable, legitimate and protectable.\n\n5. The protection of legitimate expectation does not\nrequire the fulfillment of the expectation where an\noverriding public interest requires otherwise. In other words,\n\npersonal benefit must give way to public interest and the\ndoctrine of legitimate expectation would not be invoked\nwhich could block public interest for private benefit.\"\n\n41 Here again, the aspect of government domains and the\n\n3 (2012) 11 SCC 1\n\n47/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 48 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\npolicy decision, including the change of admission rule of any course,\n\nat any time, always read and means on the sufficient material and/or\n\njustifiable reason for the same. The policy can be tested, being\n\ndiscriminatory, arbitrary and not in the interest of people at large. It is\n\ndifficult to accept the submission that they are also achieving some\n\nannounced purpose.\n\n42 There is no incentive/weightage given, if in-service\n\ncandidates want to go for Degree Course. Such restriction is contrary\n\nto the Constitutional provisions for the simple reason that the State's\n\nobligation to provide/give medical services at the rural areas will be\n\nrestricted. The student one who wants to go for Diploma Course will\n\njoin the services for incentive/weightage. The issue is, if the whole\n\nworld recognized that the Degree course including the specialized\n\nmedical field and some one who after taking note of Government\n\npolicy, actually worked in the rural areas now wants to claim the\n\nweightage and incentive rights, but now in view of this, the insistence\n\nis, as the State has a power, they can change this policy and control\n\neven such students career and restricted everyone whosoever in-\n\nservice and directed to go for the Diploma, in no way can be stated to\n\n48/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 49 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nbe achievable object and/or it is in the Public interest.\n\n43 The Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 1933 of 2014 (open\n\ncategory)(Non- in-service category), supported the stand of the State,\n\nas well as, the MCI and contended that the Regulations need to be\n\nimplemented as it is. The open candidate/non-service candidate\n\nchallenged only with regard to the Degree avenue, and not the\n\nDiploma, itself shows that they are apprehending that the candidates\n\none who get admission in Degree course through their in-service\n\nchannel/sources, are direct competitor with the meritorious students,\n\nbased upon academic marks. The challenge is not bonafide. It is half\n\nhearted. The 50% Diploma or 25% in two part, the quota of open\n\ncategory remain same. It is settled that the meritorious candidates\n\nneed to be given preference, the open category candidates on their\n\nown merits are entitled to get the Degree avenue. But the Petitioners\n\nlike person, in view of above, have deprived of their rights to get\n\nDegree avenue, therefore, the challenge and/or the case of the\n\nPetitioner/open category for the reasons so recorded above, is difficult\n\nto accept.\n\n49/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 50 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n44 The other submission that being Government employee of\n\nthe Government and as there was no condition and/or advertisement\n\nprovided at any point of time while permitting them to join the\n\nservices that they would be provided this incentive and/or weightage,\n\nis absolutely unacceptable for the simple reason that their incentive\n\nhas nothing to do with their service conditions. Both things are\n\ndifficult. There was nothing expected and/or declared that for want\n\nof such service condition and/or whosoever join such services, they\n\nare not entitled for any weightage and/or such incentive for Degree\n\nCourse. Both these rights are different from the respective point of\n\nview and in any way, not acceptable. I am deciding the issue of their\n\nweightage and incentive, based upon the admitted fact of their service\n\nin rural areas. The submission was also made that higher study\n\navenue is also available for the Diploma holder and therefore, there is\n\nnothing prevent them from having higher study including PhD. It is\n\nhard to accept such submission as the third person and/or party\n\ncannot dictate how, when and which course student should adopt to\n\nget the higher degree. For the reasons recorded above, there is no\n\nquestion to entertain the Petition filed by the non-in-service\n\ncandidates.\n\n50/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 51 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n45 The reference was made to a full bench judgment of this\n\nCourt in\nAshwin Prafulla Pimpalwar Vs. State of Maharashtra\nsaying that the power of State to change the admission rules, just\n\ncannot be interfered with and/or tested. They have power to change\n\nthe admission rules. Apart from the facts of the case and the reasons\n\nso recorded above, the same Full Bench Judgment itself clarified that\n\n\"if change warrants, then only change is permissible\". The relevant\n\nparagraph 54 reads as under:-\n\n\"54. That in relation to policy matters the Courts would\nnot ordinarily interfere with the Government decision\ndoes not, however, mean that the Government can act\narbitrarily. That would be totally destructive of the\n\nRule of Law and the Constitutional Scheme and the\npeculiar position of the Government in a\n\nconstitutional set up. Arbitrary decisions would be\ninconsistent with\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. The\nminimum that is, therefore, necessary is adverting to\n\nthe relevant material, eschewing all irrelevant\nconsiderations and a proper exercise of mind. More\nserious thought process is required, and clearer\nindication of application of mind is mandated, when\nthe change is striking, and the impact is massive,\n\naffecting a considerable segment of the society or an\nimportant aspect of life. In the present case, therefore,\na change should have been, as indicated in the\nGujarat case, preceded by views expressed by expert\nbodies like Medical Council, competent authorities\nlike the University, or suggestions and views of a\n\n4 1991 (2) Mh.L.J. 1336\n\n51/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::\n\nssm 52 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncommittee or a commission appointed in that behalf,\nand the like.\"\n\nAs reproduced itself provides the power of Writ Court if\n\naction/policy is arbitrary and reflects non-application of mind. This\n\njudgment itself recognized the requirement of clear view and opinion\n\nof all the departments/committee, which are missing here.\n\n46 As I have recorded, there is nothing to support and/or can\n\nbe the foundation for the State to change the rules for the first time,\n\nbased upon the MCI Rules of 2000, which itself is in doubt. The\n\nSupreme Court Judgments on the \"principle of promissory estoppel\"\n\nand \"legitimate expectations\" and even otherwise, are required to be\n\napplied upon the undisputed facts and circumstances of the case. The\n\nSupreme Court has elaborated these doctrines referring to the earlier\n\nSupreme Court Judgments, which are not at all considered in the Full\n\nBench of this Court. The Supreme Court therefore, elaborated the\n\ndoctrines and expressed that there is no total bar however, certain\n\nconditions are required to be tested. The observations so recorded\n\nabove, definitely falls within the ambit of those reasons which compel\n\nto test the action of the Respondents-State. The consistent\n\nrepresentations according to the Supreme Court itself amounts to the\n\n52/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 53 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\npromise which the students or candidates have followed and acted\n\nupon it. (\nState of Haryana & Ors. Vs. Jagdish\n5 ). In the present case\n\neven the State has acted upon it for long. Therefore, the State action\n\nis arbitrary, discriminatory and different treatment has been given to\n\nequals without clear elaborated reasons in spite of the judgments.\n\nAbove doctrines itself are additional factors which required to be\n\ninvoked against the State.\nThe law always regards and respects a reasonable\n\nclassification for the declared purpose and object of the State. It is\n\nquite settled. Having recognized these two sources, Diploma and\n\nDegree Course and provided these channels to the person like the\n\nPetitioners, who have completed the required services, now to take\n\naway such avenue and restricting it to diploma, falls within the ambit\n\nof \"discrimination\", \"breach of rule of law\" and \"trust\". (\nState of M.P.\n\n& Ors. Vs. Gopal D. Tirthani & Ors.\n6 ). The crystallized rights of\n\nweightage/incentive which accrued, based upon the positive\n\naction/representation made by the Government, therefore, just cannot\n\nbe taken away. There is no question of even asking for any\n\n5 (2010) 4 SCC 216\n6 (2003) 7 SCC 83\n\n53/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 54 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncompensation and/or damages because of this complex policy\n\ndecision, when the State itself is not sure to follow and/or not to\n\nfollow their own conflicting decisions. Having provided option and/or\n\navenue of higher education/specialty courses, which are essential in\n\nthis competitive world, just cannot be restricted in such fashion, as it\n\nis not in the public interest and the community and for the future\n\ngeneration to come. This is for the simple reason that by this, the\n\nState is not encouraging the students and/or candidates to render\n\ntheir services in rural areas in State of Maharashtra, though for the\n\nfixed period, even after getting higher Degree. The encouragement is\n\nnow, to continue to study without rendering service in Government\n\nhospitals, clinics and get the Degree Course. The experience of\n\nmedical officers, who have been actually and practically working in\n\nthese hospitals/clinics, cannot be stated to be of no use and cannot be\n\nstated to be that they are less meritorious compared to the open\n\ncandidates, because of their academic merit. The non-in-service\n\ncandidates are able to participate in this admission process, without\n\nattending and/or without going and/or without rendering their\n\nservices in the rural areas. The merits, if we talk about, in this\n\nmedical profession definitely need and mean, not only academic but\n\n54/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 55 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nalso of medical practice and experience. Therefore, to deny these\n\nPetitioners their avenue in such fashion is again treating \"equals\n\nunequally\" for no reason. This no way read to mean that meritorious\n\nstudents need not be given preference but that does not mean that the\n\nstudents one who have rendered such services and one who wants to\n\navail Degree avenue, need to be denied their rights only because this\n\ntime and this year, the Respondent-State wanted to take note of 2000\n\nMCI Regulation and/or they have discovered undisclosed material,\n\nthough there is conflict of views of their departments, to suggest that\n\nthere is or no justification for restricting this higher study avenue only\n\nfor the Diploma Course.\n\n48 The submission is also made that, there are promotional\n\nposts for both the cadre, including the Civil Surgeon and the post of\n\nDean of the Colleges. Normally the Dean is appointed in the State of\n\nMaharashtra on the basis of Degree only and not the Diploma. This\n\nfact just cannot be overlooked. It is difficult to accept the situation\n\nlike this, where the State wants to cut down such promotional posts,\n\nwhich they have not actually deleted with regard to the promotional\n\nchannel from Post-Graduate degree. The impugned action is not in\n\n55/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 56 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthe public interest or in the interest of administration.\n\n49 Even otherwise, the Constitutionally recognized\n\npercentage and reservation, just cannot be under the guidance and/or\n\ncontrol of the authorities like MCI and/or the university. The state and\n\nall the concerned authorities required to follow the Constitutional\n\nreservation as per the law. Therefore, there is no question in the\n\npresent case, even to issue any writ of mandamus and/or similar writ\n\nfor the same. In the present matters, there is not even challenge to\n\nthe entitlement of in-service candidates and/or their rights, though at\n\npresent restricted to 50% for Diploma Course. No avenue whatsoever,\n\nmade available for the Degree course. There is also no dispute with\n\nregard to the incentive/weightage so given/provided not by the\n\nGovernment but also by the MCI. Those incentive/ weightage/\n\nprovision is not restricted only for the Diploma, it is for all in-service\n\ncandidates. However, the effect of subsequent MCI amendments, as\n\nreferred and dealt with in\nChristian Medical College Vellore\n(Supra)\n\nwas not at all considered by the State and even by the open\n\ncandidates or MCI in their submissions and/or otherwise. In this\n\nprocess, there is nothing which affects and/or takes away the rights of\n\n56/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 57 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nopen candidates. The effect even if any, in view of the earlier policies\n\nso far as the State is concerned, will be of the candidates who wants\n\nto opt for Diploma Course only. There is no such challenge or\n\nopposition even raised by those candidates. Therefore, the challenge\n\nat the instance of State and the open candidates supporting the policy\n\nand opposing the Petitioners' contentions is unacceptable and liable to\n\nbe rejected.\nThere is no case of change in policy which is intended to\n\naffect the qualification standard and standard of Education, or any\n\nfinancial burden. The issue is to direct them to continue with the last\n\nyear policy of distribution of seats, which one of their own\n\ndepartment, wants to continue and other department to abolish the\n\nsame. The action cannot stated to be based upon the material and/or\n\nexigencies of the situation and any administrative necessity, specially\n\nwhen there is nothing to show that this historical and first time\n\nelimination falls within the public interest and necessarily of the\n\nadministration. Considering the requirement of expert/specialised\n\nmedicine doctors/officers/ is not in the interest of general public. The\n\ntotal abolish of Degree avenue is the issue, not the restrictive\n\n57/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 58 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\npercentage even if any. The writ Court, therefore, has no option but to\n\ninterfere with the decision, based upon the vague and scanty material\n\non record. The Government decision suffers from discrimination,\n\narbitrariness, non-application of mind to the law and the requirement\n\nof medical education and its utility in the society, including\n\nrural/tribal areas. This is not even a case of financial implications.\n\nThe consistency, trust, logical and valid and fairness regularity,\n\ncertainly in State dealings are the essential elements of any public law\n\nfor the public administration to perform multifaceted constitutional\n\nobligations. It should not be irrational, arbitrary, discriminatory, non-\n\nreasonable for public good. The Respondents have failed to consider\n\nand give weightage to their own consistent and effective practice of\n\nproviding limited avenue for Degree course, in the present facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, therefore, acted arbitrarily and misused its\n\npower. The claim and the rights of the Petitioners are based on,\n\nadmitted facts and the sanction of law, on established practice since so\n\nmany years, which was in public interest. The claims are legitimate\n\nand protectable. The Judicial review is therefore, imperative.\n\n51 These amended rules by the State are not applicable to the\n\n58/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 59 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nlocal bodies in service candidates, though they are also under\n\nSupervision of IMC Act and regulations. The selection process, by\n\nwhich Post-Graduate Degree avenue is excluded totally from\n\nconsideration by adopting wrong and vague methodology, such\n\nchange in policy cannot be accepted. It prevents the entry of such\n\nmedical officers to the Post-Graduate course itself. (\nDuddilla\n\nSrinivasa Sharma & Ors. Vs. V. Chrysolite\n) 7 .\nIn the present situation, therefore, we are concerned with\n\nthe earlier circulars/policies based upon the long standing\n\nrepresentation of providing 25% avenue to the diploma and degree\n\nand related conditions. Therefore, once the action as recorded above\n\nis illegal, contrary to law, discriminatory, arbitrary and not in the\n\ninterest for people at large, as well as, the Constitutional provisions\n\nincluding\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India, the Court\n\ntherefore, by invoking this writ jurisdiction and interfering the\n\npolicy/circular only to this extent and to fill the lacuna/vacuum at this\n\nstage of the admission directing the State to stick to the last year\n\nscheme and policy of 2012-13 and 2013-14, as that will be in view of\n\n7 AIR 2014 SC 558\n\n59/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 60 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ntheir own earlier declaration and the representation to the students at\n\nlarge. This in no way can be stated to be directing the State\n\nGovernment to frame new policy and/or provide interference with the\n\nreservation policy at any point of time. It is also made clear that the\n\nState of Maharashtra and/or such authorities like corporation who\n\nruns their own hospitals, in a given case, are entitled to fix the\n\npercentage. In the present situation as no percentage whatsoever\n\nprovided for Degree avenue therefore, their action tested in the\n\npresent Petitions, which I am inclined to accept. To follow the last\n\nyear percentage and practice/policy is workable solution, unless such\n\npolicy and/or decision the State able to take before proceeding with\n\nthe next stage as per the scheduled so recorded above. I am not\n\ninterfering with the rest of the notification, not inclined to give\n\nopinion how to implement their own policy of providing avenue for\n\nDegree, as well as, the Diploma.\n\n53 For the above reasons the submission revolving around the\n\nMaharashtra University Act is also unacceptable. The University\n\nand/or such authorities are also and always under obligation to follow\n\nthe standards of education, including the qualification so prescribed\n\n60/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 61 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nand announced including the directions, as well as, the orders issued\n\nby the State. They cannot have such regulations neither they have\n\nany jurisdiction to frame and control it.\n\n54 The submission revolving around the\nMaharashtra\n\nUniversity Health Science Act, 1998\n(for short MUHS Act) with regard\n\nto \"control and \"regulate\" and to distribute the seats at Graduate and\n\npost-graduate level is unacceptable. The power and authority based\n\nupon the constitutional provisions cannot be permitted by the\n\nUniversity Act, so far as medical/dental education and relates aspects.\n\nThe well recognized \"control\", regulation/rules under the\nIMC Act\nand\n\nregulations cannot be taken away by the MUHS Act. This in no way\n\nsufficient to deny the Petitioners' right/entitlement. The limited role\n\nof the University to register and/or enroll students and to control\n\nexaminations and its results in time, just cannot be overlooked. The\n\npower is different and so also the field. The submission revolving\n\naround the MUHS Act are rejected for above reason itself.\n\n55 As noted above I am not concerned with the standard of\n\neducation and/or qualification. The admission avenue based upon the\n\n61/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 62 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nrecognized mode and sources providing for Degree, as well as, the\n\nDiploma in no way can be stated to be the matter of breaching any\n\nalleged mandatory orders/directions of the MCI. The State's\n\nsubmission that these directions in question of providing 50% avenue\n\nonly for Diploma holder is directory and not mandatory. Now, the\n\nsame is fortified and confirmed even in the Supreme Court\nJudgment\n\nChristian\n(Supra) and\nSatyabrata Sahoo & Ors. Vs. State of Orissa\n\n& Ors.\n8 , where the effect of such insistence have not been accepted.\n\nThe State , the MCI, as well as, the open candidates submission by\n\noverlooking this and submission to maintain the notification as it is\n\nstating it to be within the domain and power of the State is therefore,\n\nunacceptable.\n\n56 The issue of jurisdiction, the Petitioners being in-service\n\ncandidates is also not acceptable in view of earlier orders passed by\n\nthis Court and the pendency of the present Petitions, specially at this\n\nstate of final hearing of the matter.\n\n57 In view of this, it is necessary to make the position clear\n\n8 (2012) 8 SCC 203\n\n62/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 63 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nwith regard to the entitlement of present Petitioners and/or similarly\n\nplaced persons, with regard to the respective percentage of Diploma\n\nand/or Degree. The submission is therefore made that on the basis of\n\nGRs of 22 February 1996 and 21 June 2013, last year the seats were\n\ndistributed. As I am accepting the submission that the\n\nreservation/distribution of the seats should be on the basis of original\n\ndeclaration of 1996 circulars, though circulars were already\n\nsuperseded, but as I am inclined to set aside 2/7/2013, 1/4/2014\n\nimpugned policy in question only with regard to deletion of degree\n\ncourse from such in-service reservation. There is no question of\n\ncreation of vacuum, once the impugned circular/letter set aside. The\n\nposition/rules/operating before coming into force of the impugned\n\ncircular be restored for this year 2014-2015. The state may, if time\n\npermit frame policy/admission rule in view of above reasons. The\n\nadmission process should not be hampered/stopped. I am inclined to\n\nobserve so far as the rights of State to fix the percentage, as they are\n\nfree to do so, the percentage so fixed for two sources each Diploma\n\nand Degree, need to be followed for the year 2014-2014 in the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n63/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 64 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n58 It appears from the material placed on record, including\n\nthe judgments that the total degree seats available on 5 July 2012\n\nwere as under:-\n\n(25% Degree and 25% Diploma from\nthe available seats after excluding\n50% All India Quota)\n\nSr. TOTAL DEGREE SEATS AVAILABLE SEATS AVAILABLE\nNo. SEATS AVALABLE FOR IN SERVICE FOR NON IN-\n\nCANDIDATES SERVICE\n\nCANDIDATES\n\n1 248\n\nig 62 186\n\n(25% Degree and 25% Diploma from\nthe available seats after excluding\n50% All India Quota)\n\nSr. TOTAL DIPLOMA SEATS AVAILABLE SEATS AVAILABLE\nNo. SEATS AVALABLE FOR IN SERVICE FOR NON IN-\n\nCANDIDATES SERVICE\nCANDIDATES\n\n1 92 23 69\n\nThis, therefore on similar line and scheme can be extended\n\nfor this 2014-2015 year also to avoid further delay and\n\nconfusion/complex.\n\n59 The following schedule is fixed by the Supreme Court for\n\n64/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 65 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthe admissions to the Post Graduate Medical Courses by order dated\n\n14 March 2014, in WP (Civil) No(s). 433 of 2013 (\nDr. Fraz Naseem &\n\nOrs.

(Dissenting)\n\nReserved on : 20 March 2014\n\nPronounced on : 24 March, 2014\n\n1] With deepest respect to my elder brother, I am unable to\n\nagree with the opinion now expressed by him. Hence, the present\n\ndissent.\n\n2]\n\nThe Petitioners in these batch of Petitions (except Writ\n\nPetition No.1933 of 2014) in effect, seek an appropriate writ to direct\n\nthe State of Maharashtra (State) to provide for 'reservation' or a\n\n'quota' of 25% seats for \"in-service candidates\" at the Post\n\nGraduate Degree Courses for the academic year 2014-15 at State\n\nrun Medical Colleges.\n\n3] As of now, the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure issued by the\n\nDirectorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), at clause\n\n7.1 provides that the seats available for admission to medical\n\npostgraduate courses will be distributed as 50% to all India Quota\n\nand remaining 50% to the State Quota. From the State quota all the\n\nPG Degree Seats will be distributed to regular PGM CET (Non In-\n\nservice) candidates. Further, from the State quota 50% Diploma\n\n68/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 69 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nSeats from Government Medical Colleges will be distributed to the\n\nIn-service Candidates from the Public Health Department and ESIS\n\nDepartment as per GR of Medical Education and Drugs Department\n\nNo. 1013/CR 137/ Edu-2 dated 2.7.2013.\n\n4] Thus, in terms of clause 7.1 of the aforesaid Brochure to be\n\nread with GR dated 2.7.2013, the State has provided for a\n\nreservation or a quota to the extent of 50% Postgraduate Diploma\n\nSeats to the in-service candidates. By this batch of Petitions (except\n\nWrit Petition No.1933 of 2014), the Petitioners who are in-service\n\ncandidates, seek reservation or quota in respect of Postgraduate\n\nDegree Seats for the academic year 2014-15. The reliefs in each of\n\nthe Petitions are not happily worded. However, in substance, the\n\nPetitioners seek a writ of mandamus to strike down the GR dated\n\n2.7.2013 and to provide for reservation or quota in respect of\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses.\n\n5] The facts necessary for appreciation of the challenge are few\n\nand not in serious dispute. There is no dispute that the Petitioners\n\nare employees of the State rendering services as \"Medical Officers\".\n\nConsequently, the Petitioners clearly answer the definition of 'in-\n\nservice candidates'. By Government Resolution (GR) dated\n\n6.1.1990, the State was pleased to reserve 15% seats for\n\n69/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 70 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses and 25% seats for Postgraduate\n\nDiploma Courses for in-service candidates in purported compliance\n\nwith the directives of the Supreme Court in the case of State of\n\nMaharashtra vs. Anjali Thukral. By GR dated 22.2.1996, the\n\npercentage of reservation for Postgraduate Degree Courses was\n\nincreased from 15% to 25%. On or about 11.6.2012, Writ Petition\n\nNo.5214 of 2012 came to be filed in this Court seeking inter alia a\n\ndirection to the State to specify the manner and modality for\n\ndetermination of the precise content of 25% of reservation in\n\nPostgraduate Degree and Diploma Courses for the in-service\n\ncandidates. This Petition was disposed of by judgment and order\n\ndated 5.7.2012 to which reference in some details shall be made\n\nhereafter. Suffice at this stage to mention that by judgment and\n\norder dated 5.7.2012 directions were issued to the State to come out\n\nwith a GR specifying the manner in which the reservation for in-\n\nservice candidates shall be worked out from the next academic year,\n\ni.e., 2013-2014, so that the in-service candidates for whom such\n\nreservation is intended to act as an incentive, are not left in a state\n\nof uncertainty. As there was no compliance with the directions\n\nissued by this Court on 5.7.2012, on or about 20.6.2013, Writ\n\nPetition No.5290 of 2013 came to be filed, in which an interim order\n\nwas made restraining the State from displaying the select list until\n\n25.6.2013. On 21.6.2013, the State issued a GR, which provided for\n\n70/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 71 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nreservation for Postgraduate Degree and Diploma Courses to in-\n\nservice candidates. Within a few days thereafter, i.e., on 2.7.2013,\n\nthe State issued yet another GR, which provided for reservations to\n\nPostgraduate Diploma Courses to the in-service candidates, but did\n\naway with reservations for the Postgraduate Degree Courses. On\n\n4.7.2013 this Court in Writ Petition No. 5290 of 2013, without going\n\ninto factual aspects as to what decision has been taken by the State\n\nin GR dated 21.6.2013 and GR dated 2.7.2013, as an interim\n\nmeasure directed that for the academic year 2013-14, the position\n\nwhich prevailed prior to judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 in Writ\n\nPetition No.5214 of 2012 should prevail. In passing this interim\n\norder, this Court clarified that such interim order was being passed\n\nwithout going into the factual aspect as to what decision has been\n\ntaken in GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 and \"since the\n\nGovernment has not issued Resolution well in time as directed by\n\nthe Division Bench of this Court\". This Court, in the interim order\n\ndated 4.7.2013, further made it clear that in so far as the effect of\n\ntwo GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same can\n\nbe taken into consideration at the final hearing of the Petition and\n\nthe Petition was directed to be disposed of at the stage of\n\nadmission. On 28.11.2013, the State published the PGM-CET 2014\n\nBrochure to govern admission to the Postgraduate Degree and\n\nDiploma Courses for the academic year 2014-2015. As noted earlier,\n\n71/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 72 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nclause 7.1 of the Brochure, by reference to GR dated 2.7.2013 has\n\nprovided that reservation for in-service candidates shall be only in so\n\nfar as Postgraduate Diploma Courses are concerned. In these batch\n\nof Petitions (except Writ Petition No.1933 of 2014), questioning the\n\nGR dated 2.7.2013, this Court made an interim order on 21.2.2014\n\nrestraining the State from publishing final select list and further\n\ndirecting the State to consider the representation made by in-service\n\ncandidates to the effect that benefit of reservation be extended to\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses as well. The representations so\n\nmade were considered and rejected by the State by communication\n\ndated 1.3.2014, which is also been impugned in some of the\n\nPetitions.\n\n6] Mr. Anturkar, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nPetitioners, inter alia, in Writ Petition No.5290 of 2013 made two\n\nsubmissions:\n\nA) Upon coming into the force of the\nMaharashtra\n\nUniversity of Health Sciences Act, 1998\n(1998 Act) with\n\neffect from 3.6.1998, the Maharashtra University of Health\n\nSciences and alone has the power to frame rules relating to\n\ncontrol and regulation of admission at the Graduate and\n\nPostgraduate level in Medical Colleges. This according to\n\nhim is clear from the provisions of\nSection 5(k)\nof 1998 Act.\n\nIn case of failure on the part of the University to frame rules\n\n72/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 73 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nrelating to control and regulation of admission, the State in\n\nterms of\nSection 9(4)\nof 1998 Act is empowered to issue a\n\ndirective to the University for framing such rules, whereupon\n\nit shall be the duty of University to comply with such\n\ndirective. As the field in this regard is covered by the\n\nstatutory provisions contained in 1998 Act, the State is\n\ndenuded of its power to issue any GRs in exercise of its\n\nexecutive powers conferred by\nArticle 162\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Accordingly, Mr. Anturkar submitted\n\nthat the GRs issued by the State after coming into force of\n\n1998 Act, i.e., after 3.6.1998, which includes in particular,\n\nthe GR dated 2.7.2013 is ultra vires, null and void and\n\nshould be so declared. Upon such declaration, the GR\n\ndated 6.1.1990, which provided for reservation for in-service\n\ncandidates, both for Postgraduate Degree as well as\n\nDiploma Courses revives. This is because in the year 1990,\n\nthe field had not been occupied by a statute like the 1998\n\nAct. On this basis, Mr. Anturkar submitted that the GR dated\n\n2.7.2013 ought to be struck down and reservations to in-\n\nservice candidates to Postgraduate Degree Courses\n\nprovided by the GR dated 6.1.1990, ought to be restored;\n\nB) Placing reliance upon paragraph 82 of the Supreme\n\nCourt Judgment in the case of Dr. Preeti Srivastava and anr\n\n73/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 74 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nvs. State of M.P. and ors. - (1999) 7 SCC 120, Mr. Anturkar\n\ncontended that the Medical Council of India (MCI), by virtue\n\nof Entry 66 of List I of the Constitution of India may have the\n\npower to lay down standards of eligibility or basic\n\nqualifications for admission to Graduate or Postgraduate\n\nMedical Courses, but beyond this stage the field is covered\n\nby Entry 25 of List III of the Constitution of India and\n\naccordingly, the State alone is empowered to deal with the\n\ncontrol and regulation of admissions to Graduate and\n\nPostgraduate Medical Courses. Mr. Anturkar, then submitted\n\nclause 9(1)(b) of the MCI Regulations 2000, which provide\n\nthat 50% of seats in Postgraduate Diploma Course shall be\n\nreserved for in-service candidates who have served atleast\n\nthree years in remote difficult areas, was really a clause\n\nbeyond the purview of powers vested in the MCI. The State,\n\ntherefore, had no reason to regard itself as being bound by\n\nsuch a clause. In any case, Mr. Anturkar submitted that a\n\nregulation framed by MCI in the matter of Postgraduate\n\nMedical Education are only directory or recommendatory.\n\nThus, the State has erred in relying upon the MCI\n\nRegulations for the purposes of restricting reservation only\n\nto Postgraduate Diploma Courses.\n\n74/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 75 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n7] Mr. Sakseria and Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned counsels\n\nappearing in some of the Petitions expressed their inability to agree\n\nwith at least the first submission advanced by Mr. Anturkar. They, in\n\nunison, contended that it is a prerogative of the State to determine\n\nthe manner and extent of reservation. The State, in absence of any\n\nstatute regulating admissions to Medical Courses, is very much\n\ncompetent to issue GRs in exercise of powers conferred by\nArticle\nof Constitution of India. They submitted that 1998 Act is\n\nbasically concerned with affiliation of health science Colleges and\n\nthe provisions thereof have no role to play in the matter of actual\n\ngrant of admissions or for that matter determination of the manner\n\nand extent of reservation. The Government Pleader appearing for\n\nthe State, naturally supported such submissions and contended that\n\nthe field in the matter of determination the manner and extent of\n\nreservation was by no means covered by the provisions of 1998 Act\n\nand consequently it was the prerogative of the State to deal with and\n\ndetermine such matters.\n\n8] Mr. Sakseria and Mr. Khandepakar, however, attacked the\n\ndenial of reservation to in-service candidates for the Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses, primarily on the following grounds:\n\n(a) That there is obviously a dispute between two\n\nDepartments of the State as a result of which the State\n\n75/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 76 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nitself is unclear as to what its policy is. This dispute and\n\nconfusion is reflected not only in the correspondence on\n\nrecord, but also in the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure. In the\n\ncircumstances, the GR dated 2.7.2013 cannot even be\n\ncalled as the policy decision of the State. The actual policy\n\ndecision of the State is contained in GR dated 22.2.1996 or\n\nin any case GR dated 21.6.2013. Accordingly, for the\n\nacademic year 2014-15, it is this policy decision that needs\n\nto be enforced;\n\n(b) Assuming that the GR dated 2.7.2013 indeed\n\nrepresents the current policy decision, then the same is\n\nstated to be based upon the MCI Regulations of 2009\n\nwhich provided for reservations to in-service candidates to\n\nthe Postgraduate Diploma Courses. The 2009 Regulations\n\nhad already been superseded by 2012 Regulations, by the\n\ntime GR dated 2.7.2013 came to be issued. Further, 2012\n\nRegulations have been struck down by the Supreme Court\n\nin the case of\nChristian Medical College Vellore & Ors vs.\n\nUnion of India\n- 2013 (9) SCALE 226.\nAs such, the GR\n\ndated 2.7.2013 is based upon non-existing material and\n\nconsequently has no legs to stand on.\n\n(c) Further, in the case of\nChristian Medical College\n\n(supra), the Supreme Court has categorically ruled that\n\n76/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 77 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nMCI is only concerned with specification of minimum\n\nstandards and has no role to play in the matter of\n\nadmissions to Medical Colleges. Such admissions fall\n\nwithin exclusive domain of the respective States.\n\nDetermination of extent of reservation which is a part of\n\nadmission process is therefore, not within the province of\n\nMCI. For this additional reason, the State was not at all\n\njustified in seeking to place reliance upon MCI Regulations\n\nin order to sustain the validity of GR dated 2.7.2013.\n\n(d) Finally, it was urged that the policy of denial of\n\nreservation to in-service candidates for Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses is ex-facie, arbitrary, unconstitutional and\n\nviolative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. The\n\nclassifications between Postgraduate Degree and Diploma\n\nCourses, is a classification based upon no intelligible\n\ndifferentia. In any case, taking into consideration the\n\nobjective of providing incentives to in-service candidates,\n\nsuch differentia has absolutely no rational nexus with such\n\nobjective. The denial of reservation to in-service candidates\n\nto Postgraduate Degree Courses, would be contrary to\n\nsocial and public interest, inasmuch as medical graduates\n\nwill be reluctant to work in remote and difficult areas for\n\nwant of any such incentives. Accordingly, they urged that\n\n77/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 78 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ndenial of such reservation, would affect the health concerns\n\nof inhabitants of rural, remote and difficult areas. For all\n\nthese reasons, they submitted that the policy of the\n\nGovernment, as expressed through GR dated 2.7.2013, is\n\nex-facie, illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory, unconstitutional,\n\nnull and void.\n\n9] The Government Pleader Shri. S.K. Shinde defended the\n\nState action of restricting reservations for in-service candidates to\n\nPostgraduate Diploma Courses only. In this regard, he submitted\n\nthat reservation in favour of in-service candidates can never be\n\ndemanded as a matter of right. The same is purely within the realm\n\nof policy. If this be so, then surely the nature and extent of such\n\nreservation is also within the realm of State policy. Without going\n\ninto the issue of whether the MCI Regulations are binding or not, if\n\nthe State as a policy measure, has decided to fall in line with MCI\n\nRegulations, which referred to reservations for in-service candidates\n\nat Postgraduate Diploma Courses, such policy can never be\n\nregarded as arbitrary, irrational or absurd. The circumstance that\n\nthere may be some better policy or that the policy now proposed is\n\nnot perfect, is not a ground to exercise the powers of judicial review.\n\nThe judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of\n\n2012 had directed the State to draw a balance bearing in mind\n\n78/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::\n\nssm 79 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nrelevant considerations including that reservation for in-service\n\ncandidates affect the open seats available to meritorious students\n\nand that in-service candidates foster the public health requirement of\n\nthe community. There is absolutely no arbitrariness involved in the\n\npolicy decision, inasmuch as, the class of in-service candidates has\n\nbeen treated equally. The classification in this case is really between\n\nin-service candidates on one hand and the non in-service\n\ncandidates on the other. Such classifications is certainly based upon\n\nthe intelligible differentia. The extent of reservation to be provided to\n\nin-service candidates, is within the policy domain of the State, which\n\nposition has in fact been asserted by the Petitioners themselves. In\n\nsuch circumstances, there is no scope for judicial review. Further,\n\nMr. Shinde submitted that no writ of mandamus can issue to the\n\nState to provide for reservation, which is infact the precise relief\n\nwhich the Petitioners in these batch of Petitions seek. For all these\n\nreasons, Mr. Shinde learned Government Pleader submitted that the\n\nPetitions may be dismissed.\n\n10] At this stage, brief reference is necessary to Writ Petition\n\nNo.1933 of 2014, which is filed by and on behalf of 'non-in-service\n\ncandidates'. As of now, such candidates support the Government\n\nPolicy as expressed by the GR dated 2.7.2013. However, it is their\n\ncase that should this policy be upset and the earlier policy restored,\n\n79/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 80 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthen as observed by this Court in its judgment and order dated\n\n5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of 2012, the open seats available\n\nto meritorious students are bound to be affected. As of now, there is\n\nno reservation in favour of in-service candidates, insofar as\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses are concerned. This means that\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses, as of now, are to be filled-in on basis\n\nof open merit. No doubt, even in-service candidates are eligible to\n\nand entitled to compete in the open category for such Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses. However, there is no reservation in their favour. In\n\ncase, such reservation is reintroduced, Dr.Sadavarte, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the Petitioners in this Petition, contended that\n\nthe non in-service candidates will be severely prejudiced.\n\nDr.Sadavarte, further submitted that providing extent of reservations\n\nis a part of determination of standards as held by the Supreme Court\n\nin the case of Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra). Accordingly, it is within\n\nthe domain of MCI to provide for extent of reservation. The State\n\nhas no legislative and consequently executive competence to\n\nprovide for any reservations over and above those which may be\n\nprescribed or provided by MCI in its Regulations.\n\n11] Mr.Ganesh Gole, learned counsel, appearing for the Medical\n\nCouncil of India submitted that the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nChristian Medical College\n(supra) had only set aside the MCI\n\n80/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 81 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nRegulations which provided for an All India Common Entrance Test\n\n(NEET). However, the rest of the provisions contained in\n\nRegulations of 2009 or 2012 were not in issue and consequently the\n\nsame have not been struck down or set aside. Mr.Gole submitted\n\nthat the MCI Regulations for Postgraduate Education are binding\n\nupon the State and further the MCI has acted well within its powers\n\nin prescribing reservation for in-service candidates to Postgraduate\n\nDiploma Courses and not for Postgraduate Degree Courses.\n\nMr.Gole, submitted that the basic rule when it comes to admissions\n\nat Postgraduate level is that the same should be on basis of merit.\n\nSome dilution to this basic rule has been permitted, inter alia by\n\nway of reservations in favour of in-service candidates. However,\n\nsuch reservation can be only to the extent and manner provided by\n\nthe MCI and not any further.\n\n12] At the outset, it is clear that the main relief which the\n\nPetitioners seek in these Petitions is a writ of mandamus to direct\n\nthe State to provide for reservation to in-service candidates to the\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses for the academic year 2014-15.\n\nTherefore, the first and foremost issue to be decided, is whether a\n\nwrit of mandamus can issue to the State to provide for a reservation\n\nor a quota to in-service candidates for admissions to Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses.\n\n81/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 82 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n13] This Court, in its judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 in Writ\n\nPetition No.5214 of 2012, has made it clear that in absence of\n\nGovernmental Policy providing for reservation of seats for them, in-\n\nservice candidates could not have asserted a legal or a\n\nconstitutional right to a quota as \"in-service candidates\". This right\n\noriginates in Governmental Policy. The relevant observations in this\n\nregard read thus:\n\nIn the absence of a governmental policy providing for\n\nthe reservation of seats for them, in service candidates\ncould not have asserted a legal or constitutional right to\na quota as in service candidates. The right originates in\n\ngovernmental policy. Hence, while framing the policy,\ngovernment is entitled to frame the terms of\nentitlement, though in a fair and non-discriminatory\nmanner. An incentive is an encouragement and in\nconferring an incentive, government can lay down\n\nconditions to govern it. Reservation for in service\ncandidates affect also the open seats which are\n\navailable to meritorious students. The government has\nto draw the balance bearing in mind relevant\nconsiderations, including the fact that in service\ncandidates as employees of government hospitals\nfoster the public health requirement of the community.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n14] From the aforesaid, it is clear that if the State were to have a\n\npolicy of providing no reservations or a quota for in-service\n\ncandidates, then the State would neither be infringing any legal or\n\nconstitutional provisions nor would it be acting in any arbitrary or\n\ncapricious manner. This means that there is neither any legal right\n\nvested in any in-service candidates to demand for such reservation\n\n82/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 83 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nor quota nor is there any corresponding legal, statutory or\n\nconstitutional duty in the State to provide for the same. Unless such\n\nbasic predicates exist, there arises no question for issuance of a writ\n\nof mandamus.\n\n15] In order to seek a writ of mandamus, the Petitioners who are\n\nin-service candidates have to demonstrate that they have a legal\n\nright to obtain reservations or quota for admission to the\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses. Correspondingly, such Petitioners\n\nare also required to demonstrate that the Respondents owe a legal\n\nduty to them to provide for such reservations or quota. The condition\n\nprecedent for issue of writ of mandamus is that there is in it one\n\nclaiming a legal right to performance of legal duty by one against\n\nwhom it is sought.\nIn case of\nMani Subrat Jain vs. State of Haryana\n\n- (1977) 1 SCC 486, the Supreme Court has observed thus:\n\n\"It is elementary though it is to be restated that no one\ncan ask for mandamus without a legal right. There must\nbe a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally\nprotected right before one suffering a legal grievance can\nask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be\n\naggrieved only when a person is denied a legal right by\nsomeone who has a legal duty to do something or to\nabstain from doing something.\"\n\n16] Another principle in the matter of issuance of writ of\n\nmandamus is that such a writ will not lie to seek or enforce a mere\n\n83/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 84 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nconcession or a relaxation. For a writ of mandamus to issue, the\n\nright claimed must be judicially enforceable and legally protected.\nIn\n\ncase of\nRajalakshmia vs. State of Mysore\n- AIR 1967 SC 993, a\n\nconcession was extended in favour of one batch of employees. The\n\napplicants who were left out applied for a writ of mandamus.\n\nHowever, such writ was declined by observing that a concession\n\ncould not be claimed as a matter of right by a writ of mandamus.\n\nSimilarly, for a writ of mandamus to issue, it has to be established\n\nthat there is dereliction of a legal duty. The duty which can be\n\nenforced by a writ of mandamus must be legal and not merely moral,\n\nequitable or permissible.\n\n17] In the present case, as observed earlier there is no right as\n\nsuch vested in-service candidates to claim reservations. The origin\n\nof such reservations is itself in the realm of Government policy.\n\nCorrespondingly, there is no legal duty in the State to provide for\n\nsuch reservation. No writ of mandamus would therefore lay at the\n\ninstance of in-service candidates to direct the State to provide for\n\nany reservations to in-service candidates. Merely because the State,\n\nby way of policy has chosen to provide such reservations for\n\nadmission to Postgraduate Diploma Courses, there is no warrant to\n\nissue a writ of mandamus directing that the State should also extend\n\nthis benefit of reservations to Postgraduate Degree Courses.\n\n84/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 85 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n18] Even in the matter of constitutional reservations, which\n\nundoubtedly stand upon a much higher pedestal, the Supreme Court\n\nof India in the case of Dr.Gulshan Prakash & ors. vs. State of\n\nHaryana & ors. - AIR 2010 Supreme Court 288, rejected a plea that\n\nthe State was duty bound to provide for reservation for SC / ST and\n\nbackward class category at the postgraduate level, by observing\n\nthus:\n\n19) As stated earlier,\nArticle 15(4)\nis an enabling\n\nprovision and the State Government is the best judge to\ngrant reservation for SC/ST/Backward Class categories at\nPost-Graduate level in admission and the decision of the\n\nState of Haryana not to make any provision for\nreservation at the Post-Graduate level suffers no infirmity.\n\nIn our view, every State can take its own decision with\nregard to reservation depending on various factors. Since\n\nthe Government of Haryana has decided to grant\nreservation for SC/ST categories/Backward Class\n\ncandidates in admission at MBBS level i.e. under\ngraduate level, then it does not mean that it is bound to\ngrant reservation at the Post-Graduate level also. As\nstated earlier, the State Government, in more than one\ncommunication, has conveyed its decision that it is not in\n\nfavour of reservation for SC/ST/Backward Classes at\nPost-Graduate level. In such circumstances, Court cannot\nissue mandamus against their decision and their\nprospectus also cannot be faulted with for not providing\nreservation in Post-Graduate Courses. However, we make\n\nit clear that irrespective of above conclusion, State of\nHaryana is free to reconsider its earlier decision, if they so\ndesire, and circumstances warrant in the future years.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n19] Again, in a context of reservations contemplated by Article\n\n85/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 86 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n16(4) of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court of India in the\n\ncase of P&T Scheduled Caste/ Tribe Employees' Welfare\n\nAssociation (regd.) and ors. vs. Union of India & ors. - (1988) 4\n\nSCC 147, has held that the provisions for reservation is only an\n\nenabling provision and consequently no writ can be issued\n\ncompelling the Government to make such reservation.\nIn the case of\n\nUnion of India vs. R. Rajeshwaran\n& anr.- (2003) 9 SCC 294, the\n\nSupreme Court of India in the context of making a provision for\n\nreservation of seats for admissions to all-India pool in the MBBS and\n\nBDS list, ruled that no writ of mandamus would be issued to provide\n\nfor such reservation. The Supreme Court went to the extent of\n\nobserving that its previous decisions where such writ of mandamus\n\nwas issued cannot be held to be laying down correct law. The\n\nrelevant observations in para '9' read thus:\n\n9. In Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab - (1999) 7 SCC 209,\nthis Court held that\nArticle 16(4)\nof the Constitution\nconfers a discretion and does not create any\n\nconstitutional duty and obligation.\nLanguage of\nArticle\n15(4)\nis identical and the view in\nComptroller and Auditor\nGeneral of India, Gian Prakash v. K.S. Jagannathan\n-\n\n(\n1986) 2 SCC 679 and Superintending Engineer, Public\nHealth v. Kuldeep Singh-\n(1997) 9 SCC 1999 that a\n\nmandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation\nor for relaxation is not correct and runs counter to\njudgments of earlier Constitution Benches and, therefore,\nthese two judgments cannot be held to be laying down\nthe correct law. In these circumstances, neither the\nrespondent in the present case could have sought for a\ndirection nor the High Court could have granted the same.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n86/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 87 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n20] If therefore, no writ of mandamus can issue to the State to\n\nmake reservations for even SC/ST and backward class categories\n\nfor admissions at the postgraduate level, then in my opinion, no writ\n\nof mandamus can equally issue to the State to provide for any\n\nreservation or quota in favour of in-service candidates. Again, if no\n\nwrit of mandamus can issue to the State directing it to provide for\n\nreservation in favour of in-service candidates, then surely no writ of\n\nmandamus can issue to the State directing it to provide for\n\nreservation or quota to in-service candidates to the Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses.\n\n21] The next important issue which arises for determination is\n\nwhether the policy of the State to provide for reservation or quota to\n\nin-service candidates for admission only to Postgraduate Diploma\n\nCourses and not to Postgraduate Degree Courses is illegal,\n\narbitrary, discriminatory absurd, irrational, null and void.\n\n22] In order to attempt an answer to the aforesaid question, it is\n\nnecessary to outline the scope of judicial review when it comes to\n\ntesting Government policy.\n\n23] This Court whilst exercising the power of judicial review of\n\n87/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 88 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nadministrative action does not act as an appellate authority. The\n\nscope of judicial review is confined to the question whether the\n\ndecision taken by the State is against any statutory provisions or\n\nviolative of the fundamental rights or other constitutional rights. The\n\ncorrectness of reasons which prompted the State to make a policy\n\nor to change a policy or to adopt one course of action instead of\n\nanother, is normally not a matter of concern in judicial review of this\n\nnature. As long as policy decisions do not infringe legal or\n\nconstitutional rights, a constitutional court will not substitute its own\n\njudgment for the judgment of the executive in such matters. In\n\nassessing legality or propriety of such policy decision of the State,\n\nthe Court cannot interfere even if a second view is possible and in\n\nthe opinion of the Court such second view is better or wiser or more\n\npractical. In matters of framing of policy, it is well settled that the\n\nState has sufficient liberty and freedom. The State has to take into\n\nconsideration several complex factors and it is not possible for the\n\nCourts to consider the competing claims and conflicting interest for\n\npurposes of determining which way the balance tilts.\n\n24] Thus the position in law is that normally, the Court while\n\nexercising power of judicial review will not interfere with the\n\ngovernment policy, unless the same is established as being in\n\nviolation of any statutory or constitutional provision. With the\n\n88/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 89 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nquestion whether a particular policy is good, bad, wise or foolish, a\n\nCourt of law is normally unconcerned. It is not for the Court to advise\n\nthe government to adopt another policy, which in the opinion of the\n\nCourt is fairer, wiser or more scientific. It is not within the domain of\n\nthe Court to weigh the pros and cons of policy or to scrutinize it and\n\ntest the degree of its beneficial or equitable disposition for the\n\npurpose of varying, modifying or annulling it, based on howsoever\n\nsound and good reasoning, except where it is arbitrary or violative of\n\nany constitutional, statutory or any other provision of law. It would be\n\ndangerous if the Court is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of\n\nthe policy or its appraisal merely on the basis of pleadings in a\n\npetition or statements in a counter. As observed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of\nBennett Coleman & Co. V. Union of India\n,\n\n(1972) 2 SCC 788, that the Courts \"cannot be propelled into the\n\nunchartered ocean of Governmental policy\".\n\n25] In the case of\nAsif Hameed Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir\n\n1989 supp (2) SCC 364, the Supreme Court observed thus :\n\n\"While exercising power of judicial review of administrative\naction, the Court is not an appellate authority. The\nConstitution does not permit the court to direct or advise\nthe executive in matters of policy or to sermonise qua any\nmatter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere\nof the legislature or executive, provided these authorities\ndo not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory\npowers.\"\n\n89/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 90 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n26] In the case of\nState of Maharashtra vs. Lok Shiksha Sanstha\n\n- (1971) 2 SCC 410, the Applications for opening of new schools\n\nwere rejected by the State. The High Court issued a mandamus to\n\nthe State directing the grant of permission. The Supreme Court\n\nreversed the High Court by observing thus:\n\nSo long as there is no violation of any fundamental rights\nand if the principles of natural justice are not offended, it\nwas not for the High Court to lay down the policy that\nshould be adopted by the educational authorities in the\nmatter of granting permission for starting schools. The\n\nquestion of policy is essentially for the State and such\npolicy will depend upon an overall assessment and\n\nsummary of the requirements of residents of a particular\nlocality and other categories of persons for whom it is\nessential to provide facilities for education. If the overall\n\nassessment is arrived at after a proper classification on\nreasonable basis, it is not for the courts to interfere with\nthe policy leading up to such assessment.\n\n27] In the case of\nMaharashtra Board of Secondary & Higher\n\nSecondary Education vs. Paritosh\n(1984) 4 SCC 27, the High Court\n\nissued a writ of mandamus directing the Board to provide for\n\nreevaluation of answer papers. The Supreme Court reversing the\n\nHigh Court observed thus:-\n\n\"The Court cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of the\n\npolicy evolved by the legislature and the subordinate\nregulation-making body It may be a wise policy which will\nfully effectuate the purpose of the enactment or it may be\nlacking in effectiveness and hence calling for revision and\nimprovement. But any drawbacks in the policy\nincorporated in a rule or regulation will not render it ultra\nvires and the Court cannot strike it down on the ground\nthat in its opinion, it is not a wise or prudent policy, but is\neven a foolish one, and that it will not really serve to\n\n90/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 91 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\neffectuate the purposes of the Act. The legislature and its\ndelegate are the sole repositories of the power to decide\nwhat policy should be pursued in relation to matters\n\ncovered by the Act and there is no scope for interference\nby the Court unless the particular provision impugned\nbefore it cane be said to suffer from any legal infirmity in\n\nthe sense of its being wholly beyond the scope of the\nregulation-making power or its being inconsistent with any\nof the provisions of the parent enactment or in violation of\nany of the limitation imposed by the Constitution\".\n\n28] In the case of\nArun Roy Vs. Union of India\n- 2002(7) SCC 368,\n\nthe Supreme Court ruled that it is open for the State to take a\n\ndecision upon National Education Policy and a Court of law cannot\n\nopine whether such policy is good or bad. A Court of law can only\n\ninterfere if such policy contravenes statutory or constitutional\n\nprovisions.\n\n29] In the case of Metropolis Theatre Company v. State of\n\nChicago- 57 L Ed 730, the Supreme Court of United States\n\nobserved that in matters of the judicial review of Government policy,\n\ncertain measures of freedom or 'play' in the 'joints' needs to be\n\nconceded to the executive. Mere errors are not subject to judicial\n\nreview. It is only palpably arbitrary exercise which can be declared\n\nas void. The Court observed thus:\n\n\"The Court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by\nthe State Government merely because it feels that\nanother policy decision would have been fairer or wiser or\nmore scientific or logical. The Court can interfere only if\nthe policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or\n\n91/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 92 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nmala fide\".\n\n30] It is also settled position in law that the Government has the\n\npower to change policy. The executive power is not limited only to\n\nframe policy, but the executive also has the power to change, re-\n\nchange, adjust and readjust the policy by taking into account the\n\nrelevant and germane considerations. As long as the changed policy\n\nis not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, there is little scope for\n\njudicial review.\n\n31] In the case of\nSangwan vs. Union of India\n- 1980 Supp SCC\n\n559, the Supreme Court was considering a position where in\n\npursuance of 1964 promotion policy, a select list was prepared and\n\nthe Petitioner included therein. However, just before the\n\nappointment, there was a change in the policy, as a result of which\n\nthe Petitioner was denied appointment. The High Court ruled in\n\nfavour of the Petitioner by observing that the State had acted in\n\narbitrary manner to depart from its consistently held policy\n\n\"overnight by making fresh selection and without antecedent\n\nreformulation\". Disapproving the approach of the High Court, the\n\nSupreme Court observed thus:\n\n\"A policy once formulated is not good for ever, it is\nperfectly within the competence of the Union of India to\nchange it, rechange it, adjust it and readjust it according\nto the compulsions of circumstances and imperatives of\n\n92/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 93 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nnational considerations. We cannot, as Court, give\ndirectives as to how the Defence Ministry should function\nexcept to state that the obligation not to act arbitrarily and\n\nto treat employees equally is binding the Union of India\nbecause it functions under the Constitution and not over\nit\".\n\n32] In the case of\nUnion of India vs. S.L. Dutta\n- (1991) 1 SCC\n\n505, the High Court set aside the changed policy in the matter of\n\npromotion to the post of Air Marshal on the ground that \"the new\n\npromotion policy was not framed after an in-depth study\" and a writ\n\nof mandamus was issued to the State to consider a case of the\n\nPetitioner on the basis of old policy. Reversing the High Court, the\n\nSupreme Court observed thus :-\n\n\"A consideration of a policy followed in the Indian Air Force\nregarding the promotional chances of officers in the\n\nNavigation Stream of the Flying Branch in the Air Force\nqua the other branches would necessarily involve scrutiny\n\nof the desirability of such a change which would require\nconsiderable knowledge of modern aircraft, scientific and\ntechnical equipment available in such aircraft to guide in\nnavigating the same, tactics to be followed by the Indian\nAir Force and so on. These are matters regarding which\n\njudges and the lawyers of courts can hardly be expected\nto have much knowledge by reason of their training and\nexperience.\"\n\n33] In the case of Tamil Nadu Education Dept. Ministerial &\n\nGeneral Subordinate Services Assn vs. State of Tamil Nadu -\n\n(1980) 3 SCC 97, the change in seniority policy was challenged as\n\narbitrary, discriminatory and violative of a constitutional guarantee.\n\nNegativing the challenge, the Supreme Court observed thus:-\n\n93/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 94 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n\"We cannot, as court, quarrel if administrative policy is\nrevised. The wisdom of yesterday may obsolesce into the\nfolly of today, even as the science of old may sour into the\n\nsuperstition now, and vice versa. Nor can we predicate\nmala fides or ulterior motive merely because assembly\ninterpellations have ignited rethinking or, as hinted by\n\ncounsel, that the Education Minsiter's sensitivity is due to\nhis having been once District Board teacher. Democratic\nprocesses - both these are part of such process - are not\nanathema to judges and we cannot knock down the order\n\nbecause government have responded to the Question\nHour or re-exmained the decision at the instance of a\nsensitive minster.\n\n34]\n\nThe policy or the changed policy as reflected in GR dated\n\n2.7.2013, is therefore, required to be tested on the touchstone of\n\nrestrictive judicial review emphasized by the Supreme Court of India\n\ntime and again.\n\n35] The Petitioners, apart from urging that the policy is ultra vires,\n\nnull and void, have failed to demonstrate why it is so. Admittedly, the\n\npolicy is not in breach of any legal or statutory provisions. There is\n\nno law which requires the State to provide for any reservation or\n\nquota in favour of in-service candidates. Accordingly, the policy does\n\nnot fall foul of any law or statutory enactment.\n\n36] The contention of the Petitioners that the policy is arbitrary,\n\ndoes not appeal to me. The Supreme Court as also Medical Council\n\n94/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 95 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nof India as time and again emphasized that admissions at the level\n\nof post-graduation or super speciality ought to be strictly on the\n\nbasis of merit. At the stage of post-graduation some dilution in the\n\nmerit criteria has been tolerated. However, the dilution is expected to\n\nbe minimum.\n\n37] In the case of\nDr. Pradeep Jain & ors vs. Union of India & ors\n.\n\n- (1984) 3 SCC 654, the Supreme Court drew out the distinction\n\nbetween the admissions to MBBS Courses and MD or MS Courses\n\nby observing that at the stage of postgraduate admissions\n\nexcellence cannot be allowed to be compromised by any other\n\nconsiderations because that would detrimental to the interest of the\n\nNation. The observations in paragraph 22 deserve mention:\n\n22. So much for admission to the M.B.B.S. course, but\ndifferent considerations must prevail when we come to\nconsider the question of reservation based on residence\nrequirement within the State or on institutional preference\nfor admission to post graduate courses, such as, M.D.,\n\nM.S. and the like. There we cannot allow excellence to be\ncompromised by any other considerations because that\nwould be detrimental to the interest of the nation. It was\nrightly pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in Jagdish Saran's\ncase, and we wholly endorse what he has said:\n\n\"The basic medical needs of a region or the\npreferential push justified for a handicapped group\ncannot prevail in the same measure at the highest\nscale of speciality where the best skill or talent,\nmust be handpicked by selecting according to\ncapability. At the level of Ph.D., M.D., or levels of\nhigher proficiency, where international measure of\ntalent is made, where losing one great scientist or\n\n95/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 96 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ntechnologist in the making is a national loss the\nconsiderations we have expended upon as\nimportant loss their potency. Here equality,\n\nmeasured by matching excellence, has more\nmeaning and cannot be diluted much without grave\nrisk.\"\n\n\"If equality of opportunity for every person in\nthe country is the constitutional guarantee, a\ncandidate who gets more marks then another is\nentitled to preference for admission. Merit must be\n\nthe test when choosing the best, according to this\nrule of equal chance for equal marks. This\nproposition has greater importance when we reach\nthe higher levels of education like post-graduate\n\ncourses. After all, top technological expertise in any\nvital field like medicine is a nation's human asset\n\nwithout which its advance and development will be\nstunted. The role of high grade skill or special talent\nmay be less at the lesser levels of education, jobs no\ndisciplines of social inconsequence, but more at the\n\nhigher levels of sophisticated skills and strategic\nemployment. To devalue merit at the summit is to\ntemporise with the country's development in the vital\nareas of professional expertise. In science and\n\ntechnology and other specialised fields of developmental\nsignificance, to relax lazily or easily in regard to exacting\nstandards of performance may be running a grave\n\nnational risk because in advanced medicine and other\ncritical departments of higher knowledge, crucial to\nmaterial progress, the people of India should not be\ndenied the best the nation's talent lying latent can\n\nproduce. If the best potential in these fields is cold-\nshouldered for populist considerations garbed as\nreservations, the victims, in the long run, may be the\npeople themselves. Of course, this unrelenting strictness\nin selecting the best may not be so imperative at other\nlevels where a broad measure of efficiency may be good\n\nenough and what is needed is merely to weed out the\nworthless.\"\n\n\"Secondly, and more importantly, it is difficult to\ndenounce or renounce the merit criterion when the\nselection is for post graduate or post doctoral courses in\nspecialised subjects. There is no substitute for sheer\nflair, for creative talent, for fine-tune performance at the\ndifficult highest of some disciplines where the best alone\nis likely to blossom as the best. To sympathise\n\n96/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 97 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nmawkishly with the weaker sections by selecting\nsubstandard candidates, is to punish society as a whole\nby denying the prospect of excellence say in hospital\n\nservice. Even the poorest, when stricken by critical\nillness, needs the attention of super-skilled specialists,\nnot humdrum second-rates. So it is that relaxation on\n\nmerit, by over ruling equality and quality all together, is a\nsocial risk where the stage is post graduate or post-\ndoctoral.\"\n\nThese passages from the judgment of Krishna Iyer, J. clearly\nand forcibly express the same view which we have\n\nindependently reached on our own and in deed that view has\nbeen so ably expressed in these passages that we do not\nthink we can usefully add anything to what has already been\nsaid there. We may point out that the Indian Medical Council\n\nhas also emphasized that playing with merit, so far as\nadmissions to post graduate courses are concerned, for\npampering local feeling, will boomerang. We may with\n\nadvantage reproduce the recommendation of the Indian\nMedical Council on this point which may not be the last word\nin social wisdom but is certainly worthy of consideration:\n\n\"Student for post-graduate training should be selected\nstrictly on merit judged on the basis of academic record\nin the undergraduate course. All selection for post-\ngraduate studies should be conducted by the\nUniversities.\"\n\nThe Medical Education Review Committee has also expressed\n\nthe opinion that \"all admissions to the post-graduate courses in\nany institution should be open to candidates on an all India\nbasis and there should be no restriction regarding domicile in\nthe State/Union Territory in which the institution is located.\" So\nalso in the policy statement filed by the leaned Attorney\n\nGeneral, the Government of India has categorically expressed\nthe view that:\n\n\"So far as admissions to the institutions of post-\ngraduate colleges and special professional colleges\nis concerned, it should be entirely on the basis of all\n\nIndia merit subject to constitutional reservations in\nfavour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\"\n\nWe are therefore of the view that so far as admissions to\npost-graduate courses, such as M.S., M.D. and the like\nare concerned, it would be eminently desirable not to\nprovide for any reservation based on residence\nrequirement within the State or on institutional preference.\nBut, having regard to border considerations of equality of\n\n97/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 98 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nopportunity and institutional continuity in education which\nhas its own importance and value, we would direct that\nthough residence requirement within the State shall not be\n\na ground for reservation in admissions to post graduate\ncourses, a certain percentage of seats may in the present\ncircumstances, be reserved on the basis of institutional\n\npreference in the sense that a student who has passed\nM.B.B.S. course from a medical college or university may\nbe given preference for admission to the post-graduate\ncourse in the same medical colleges or university but such\n\nreservation on the basis of institutional preference should\nnot in any event exceed 50 per cent of the total number of\nopen seats available for admission to the post- graduate\ncourse. This outer limit which we are fixing will also be\nsubject to revision on the lower side by the Indian Medical\n\nCouncil in the same manner as directed by us in the case\nof admissions to the M.B.B.S. course. But, even in regard,\n\nto admissions to the post-graduate course, we would\ndirect that so far as super specialities such as neuro-\nsurgery and cardiology are concerned, there should be no\n\nreservation at all even on the basis of institutional\npreference and admissions should be granted purely on\nmerit on all India basis.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n38] In the case of Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra), the Supreme\n\nCourt had ruled that at the level of super specialities, there cannot\n\nbe any reservation because in dilution of merit at this level would\n\nadversely affect the national goal of having the post possible people\n\nat the highest level of professional and education training. In the\n\ncontext of next below stage of Postgraduate Education in medical\n\nspeciality, the Supreme Court ruled that similar considerations\n\nshould prevail though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than in the\n\nsuper specialities. However, the Supreme Court cautioned that the\n\nelement of public interest in having the most meritorious students at\n\n98/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 99 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthis level of education is present even at the stage of postgraduate\n\nteaching. In this regard, reference can be usefully made to the\n\nobservations in paragraph 24, which reads thus:\n\n24. At the next below stage of postgraduate education\nin medical specialities, similar considerations also prevail\nthough perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than in the\nsuperspecialities. But the element of public interest in\n\nhaving the most meritorious students at this level of\neducation is present even at the stage of post-graduate\nteaching. Those who have specialised medical knowledge\nin their chosen branch are able to treat better and more\neffectively patients who are sent to them for expert\n\ndiagnosis and treatment in their specialised field. For a\nstudent who enrols for such speciality courses, an ability\n\nto assimilate and acquire special knowledge is required.\n\nNot everyone has this ability. Of course intelligence and\nabilities do not know any frontiers of caste or class or race\n\nor sex. They can be found anywhere, but not in everyone.\nTherefore, selection of the right calibre of students is\nessential in public interest at the level of specialised\npostgraduate education. In view of this supervening public\n\ninterest which has to be balanced against the social equity\nof providing some opportunities to the backward who are\n\nnot able to qualify on the basis of marks obtained by them\nfor postgraduate learning, it is for an expert body such as\nthe Medical Council of India, to lay down the extent of\nreservations, if any, and the lowering of qualifying marks, if\nany, consistent with the broader public interest in having\n\nthe most competent people for specialised training, and\nthe competing public interest in securing social justice and\nequality. The decision may perhaps, depend upon the\nexpert body's assessment of the potential of the reserved\ncategory candidates at a certain level of minimum\n\nqualifying marks and whether those who secure admission\non the basis of such marks to postgraduate courses, can\nbe expected to be trained in two or three years to come up\nto the standards expected of those with post-graduate\nqualifications.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n39] In the case of\nSatyabrata Sahoo vs. State of Orissa\n- (2012)\n\n99/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 100 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n8 SCC 203, the Supreme Court was called upon to rule on the\n\nvalidity of the proviso to clause 9(2)(d) of the MCI Regulations 2009,\n\nwhich provided for weightage in marks to be given as an incentive at\n\nthe rate of 10% of the marks obtained for each year's service in\n\nremote or difficult areas upto the maximum of 30% of the marks\n\nobtained, when it came to determining the merit of in-service\n\ncandidates. Based upon such clause, in-service candidates were not\n\nonly claiming weightage when it came to competition with other in-\n\nservice candidates, but also vis-a-vis open merit category\n\ncandidates. The Supreme Court struck down this proviso by\n\nobserving that the same permits encroachment upon open category,\n\nwhere merit alone ought to be the determining factor. The\n\nobservations in paragraphs 24, 25 and 27, which are relevant, read\n\nthus:\n\n24] We have referred to the above mentioned\njudgments only to indicate the fact that this Court in\nvarious judgments has acknowledged the fact that\n\nweightage could be given for doctors who have rendered\nservice in rural/tribal areas but that weightage is available\nonly in in-service category, to which 50% seats for PG\nadmission has already been earmarked. The question is\nwhether, on the strength of that weightage, can they\n\nencroach upon the open category, i.e direct admission\ncategory. We are of the view that such encroachment or\ninroad or appropriation of seats earmarked for open\ncategory candidates (direct admission category) would\ndefinitely affect the candidates who compete strictly on\nthe basis of the merit.\n\n25] The purpose and object for giving weightage to in-\nservice candidates who have rendered rural/tribal service\n\n100/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 101 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nis laudable and their interest has been taken care of by\nthe Medical Council of India as well as the prospectus\nissued for admission to the various medical colleges in\n\nState of Odisha but they have to come through the proper\nchannel i.e. the channel exclusively earmarked for in-\nservice candidates and not through the channel\n\nearmarked for candidates in the open category. The in-\nservice candidates are also free to compete through the\nopen category just like any other who fall under that\ncategory. Further, it is also relevant to note that those who\n\nget admission in postgraduate courses through the open\ncategory have to execute a bond stating that they would\nserve rural/tribal areas after completion of their\npostgraduation. In fact, weightage is given to those\ncandidates who have rendered service in rural/tribal areas\n\nwhen they compete for admission to PG (Medical)\nCourses in in-service category for whom 50% seats are\n\nearmarked.\n\n26] .....\n\n27] We notice that the seats earmarked for the open\ncategory by way of merit are few in number and\nencroachment by the in-service candidates into that open\ncategory would violate clause 9(1)(a) of the MCI\nregulations, which says students for PG medical courses\n\nshall be selected strictly on the basis of the inter se\nacademic merit i.e. on the basis of the merit determined\n\nby the competent test. Direct category or open category is\na homogeneous class which consists of all categories of\ncandidates who are fresh from college, who have\nrendered service after MBBS in Government or private\n\nhospitals in remote and difficult areas like hilly areas,\ntribal and rural areas and so on. All of them have to\ncomplete on merit being in the direct candidate category,\nsubject to rules of reservation and eligibility. But there can\nbe no encroachment from one category to another.\n\nCandidates of in-service category cannot encroach upon\nthe open category, so also vice-versa.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n40] The Supreme Court in the case of\nSatyabrata Sahoo\n(supra)\n\ntook express cognizance of clause 9(1) (a) of the MCI Regulations\n\n101/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 102 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nwhich clearly mandates that students for Postgraduate Medical\n\nCourses shall be selected strictly on basis of inter se academic\n\nmerit. In the present case, if reservations are extended to\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses, certainly the Postgraduate Degree\n\nCourses available to be filled-in on basis of open merit category will\n\nproportionately reduced.\nThe postgraduate degree seats would be\n\ndiverted to the quota or channel to be filled in by the reserved in-\n\nservice category candidates. To that extent, this is bound to affect\n\nthe open category seats which are to be filled-in strictly on basis of\n\nmerit.\n\n41] There is no question of any discrimination involved in not\n\nextending benefit of reservation to Postgraduate Degree Courses.\n\nThe benefit of reservation is available to all in-service candidates\n\nuniformly. The in-service candidates constitute a distinct class and\n\nas long as there is equality amidst this class, there arises no\n\nquestion of discrimination or violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\n\nof India. It is settled principle that equality is amongst equals. The\n\ndiscrimination which the Petitioners perhaps allege, is, as between\n\nin-service candidates and non in-service candidates. This is\n\nbecause \"non in-service candidates\" are entitled to admission to\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses retained under the State quota.\n\nHowever, there is no reservation in favour of the non in-service\n\n102/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 103 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncandidates. The in-service candidates are also entitled to compete\n\non merit to such Postgraduate Degree Courses. Thus, in the class of\n\nnon in-service candidates again, there is no discrimination, but\n\nrather there is equality. The submission that in-service candidates\n\nare deprived of an opportunity to obtain admission to Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses, is with respect, misconceived. There is absolutely\n\nno such deprivation. Absence of any reservation or quota does not\n\namount to deprivation. All that the policy provides is that when it\n\ncomes to Postgraduate Degree Courses, the admission shall be\n\nstrictly on basis of inter se merit. There can be neither any\n\narbitrariness, nor any discrimination in such an approach.\n\n42] Again, there can be no discrimination as between in-service\n\ncandidates and non in-service candidates. Admittedly, both belong\n\nto a different class. The classification between them, even according\n\nto the Petitioners themselves is based upon an intelligible differentia.\n\nThe object of Postgraduate Medical Education is not, as may be\n\nperceived by the Petitioners, to offer incentives and encouragement\n\nto in-service candidates. Rather the object of Postgraduate Medical\n\nEducation is to ensure that most meritorious students obtain\n\nadmissions. The dilution of merit is permitted only to a certain extent\n\nand on account of certain peculiar exigencies. Accordingly, providing\n\nof reservation to in-service candidates for Postgraduate Diploma\n\n103/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 104 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nCourses but not extending benefit of such reservation to\n\nPostgraduate Degree Courses, can neither be described as being\n\narbitrary or discriminatory. It cannot be said that there is no rational\n\nnexus between the classification and the object which such\n\nclassification seeks to achieve. Accordingly, the charge that in-\n\nservice candidates have been discriminated against, for want of\n\nreservation to Postgraduate Degree Courses, fails and is required to\n\nbe rejected.\n\n43]\n\nIn the case of State of M.P. Vs. Gopal D. Tirthani - (2003) 7\n\nSCC 83, upon which the reliance was placed by the Petitioners\n\nthemselves, it has been held that the classification between in-\n\nservice candidates and non in-service candidates is based upon an\n\nintelligible differentia. On this basis setting aside separate and\n\nexclusive source of entry or channel for admission to in-service\n\ncandidates came to be upheld. However, the further contention\n\nraised by the in-service candidates that a separate entrance exam\n\nought to be held for them was repealed by the Supreme Court in\n\nemphatic terms. The in-service candidates had contended that they\n\nhave served for the Government soon after their graduation in\n\nremote and hilly areas and were detached from theoretical studies\n\nand therefore it would be too much to expect from them such\n\ntheoretical knowledge of Medical Science as would enable them to\n\n104/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 105 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncompete with fresh medical graduates taking up pre-postgraduate\n\ntest and to qualify for entry into Postgraduate Courses. On this\n\nbasis, it was forcefully submitted that the State ought to be directed\n\nto conduct two separate examinations for the two classes,\n\nparticularly since the two channels were separate, exclusive and\n\nassessment of merit of one class would not affect the assessment of\n\nmerit of the other. Rejecting such contention, the Supreme Court\n\nobserved thus :\n\n23.\nIn the case of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava and Anr. v. State\n\nof M.P. and Ors.\n, the Constitution Bench has expressly\ndiscarded the submission that there need not be any\nqualifying marks prescribed for the common entrance\n\nexamination. The Medical Council of India, as an expert\nbody, is the repository of the nation's faith for laying down\nthe extent of reservations, if any and the lowering of\nqualifying marks consistent with the broader public\n\ninterest in having the most competent people for\nspecialized training and the competing public interest in\n\nsecuring social justice and equality. Even when it is\npermissible to prescribe lesser qualifying marks for a\nreserved category (not a mere separate channel of entry\nof candidates) and the general category of candidates at\nthe post-graduate level, there cannot be a big disparity\n\nbetween the two. The level of disparity in qualifying marks\nsubject to its being permitted by the expert body, must be\nminimal so that the candidates seeking admission into\npost graduation can put up to a certain level of excellence.\n\nReferring to Ajay Kumar Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar\n\nand Ors., Nivedita Jain, and Post Graduate Institute of\nMedical Education & research, Chandigarh and Ors. v.\nK.L. Narasimhan, the Constitution Bench observed that it\nis true that in spite of having been admitted through any\nchannel or may be by reservation, merely because\neverybody has to take the same post-graduation\nexamination to qualify for a post-graduate degree, it is not\na guarantee of quality. A pass mark is not a guarantee of\nexcellence. There is a great deal of difference between a\n\n105/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::\n\nssm 106 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nperson who qualifies with the minimum marks and a\nperson who qualifies with high marks. It excellence is to\nbe promoted at the post-graduate level, the candidates\n\nqualifying should be able to secure good marks while\nqualifying. Attaining minimum qualifying marks has a\ndirect relation with the standards of education. Qualifying\n\nmarks is an assessment of the calibre of students chosen\nfor admission. If the students are of a high calibre, training\nprogrammes can be suitably moulded so that they can\nreceive the maximum benefit out of a high level of\n\nteaching. If the calibre of the students is poor or they are\nunable to follow the instructions being imparted, the\nstandard of teaching necessarily has to be lowered to\nmake them understand the course which they have\nundertaken; and it may not be possible to reach the levels\n\nof education and training which can be attained with a\nbright group. The assemblage of students in a particular\n\nclass should be within a reasonable range of variable\ncalibre and intelligence, else the students will not be able\nto move along with each other as a common class.\n\nHence, the need for a common entrance test and\nminimum qualifying marks as determined by experts in the\nfield of medical education.\n\n24. ...\n\n25. ...\n\n26. ...\n\n27. The in-service candidates may have been away from\nacademics and theories because of being in service. Still\nthey need to be assessed as eligible for entrance in P.G.\nFor taking up such examination, they must either keep\nupdating themselves regularly or concentrate on studies\n\npreparatory to entrance examinations but without\nsacrificing or compromising with their obligations to the\npeople whom they are meant to serve on account of being\nin State services.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n44] The next contention, though faintly urged was that assuming\n\nthe policy may be proper, but the manner in which the change came\n\nto be brought out, renders the same arbitrary, null and void. As\n\nobserved earlier, even the changed policy, in my opinion, does not\n\n106/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 107 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ninfringe any statutory or constitutional provisions. In fact, the policy\n\nis consistent with that formulated by the MCI and approved by the\n\nSupreme Court of India. The circumstance that the earlier policy\n\nheld field for a considerable period even after the MCI Regulations\n\nof 2009 came in force, is hardly a ground to urge that the earlier\n\npolicy should continue forever or the same should never be\n\nchanged. As observed observed by the Supreme Court in the case\n\nof Tamil Nadu Education Dept. Ministerial & General Subordinate\n\nServices (supra), the wisdom of yesterday may obsolesce into folly\n\nof today, even as the science of old may sour into superstition now,\n\nand vice-versa.\n\n45] Besides, at this stage, it is necessary to refer to the decision\n\nof this Court dated 5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of 2012 in\n\nwhich directions came to be issued to the State to come out with a\n\nGovernment Resolution specifying the manner in which the\n\nreservation for in-service candidates shall be worked out. In the said\n\ndecision, this Court observed that the State while framing the policy\n\nis entitled to frame the terms of entitlement in a fair and non-\n\ndiscriminatory manner. An incentive is an encouragement and in\n\nconferring an incentive, government can lay down conditions to\n\ngovern it. Reservation for in service candidates affect also the\n\nopen seats which are available to meritorious students. The\n\n107/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 108 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ngovernment has to draw the balance bearing in mind relevant\n\nconsiderations, including the fact that in service candidates as\n\nemployees of government hospitals foster the public health\n\nrequirement of the community. There is no reason to presume\n\nthat such considerations were not taken into account by the\n\nState in issuing GR dated 2.7.2013.\n\n46] The next contention, that the GR dated 2.7.2013, cannot be\n\nregarded as a policy decision at all, is unacceptable. There is no\n\ndispute that GR dated 2.7.2013 has been issued by the State in\n\nexercise of executive powers vested in it by\nArticle 162\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. The circumstance that there may be or that\n\nthere is some dispute between two Departments of the State, is\n\nquite irrelevant. That by itself does not rob GR dated 2.7.2013 of its\n\nlegal efficacy. As long as the GR dated 2.7.2013 stands, and the\n\nintention of the State to implement the same is made known vide\n\nclause 7.1 of the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure, it cannot be said that\n\nthere is no policy decision of the State in existence. Accordingly, the\n\ncontention as to the non-existence of policy decision requires to be\n\nrejected.\n\n47] The next issue is whether the policy is based upon MCI\n\nRegulations which were either non-existing or in any case not\n\n108/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 109 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nbinding upon the State. Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to delve\n\nupon this issue in great details, because even de hors such\n\nRegulations, it was within the domain of State policy to provide for or\n\nalter the reservations or quota for in-service candidates. The\n\nsubmission of Mr. Anturkar based upon paragraph 82 of the\n\njudgment in the case of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\n(supra), however\n\nneeds to be rejected. The paragraph is a part of the minority opinion.\n\nIn the case of\nHarish Verma vs. Ajay Srivastava\n- (2003) 8 SCC 69,\n\nthe Supreme Court reversed the Full Bench of the Rajasthan High\n\nCourt, which had placed reliance on the dissenting opinion of one\n\nJudge in the\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\ncase.\n\nAs noted earlier, the\n\nmajority in the case of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\n(supra) at paragraph 24\n\nhas observed that it is for an expert body such as MCI to lay down\n\nthe extent of reservations, if any, in the context of postgraduate\n\nadmissions.\n\n48] The learned counsels for the Petitioners may be technically\n\nright in their submissions that the MCI Regulations 2009 were not in\n\nexistence when the GR dated 2.7.2013 was issued, as by then MCI\n\nRegulations, 2012 were in force. However, the further submission\n\nthat even the MCI Regulations, 2012 had by then being struck down\n\nby the Supreme Court in the case of\nChristian Medical College\n\n(supra) does not appear to be well founded.\n\nA careful reading of the\n\n109/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 110 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\njudgment in the case of\nChristian Medical College\n(supra) would\n\nindicate that the Supreme Court was really concerned with the\n\namendments to the MCI Regulations by which a National Eligibility-\n\ncum-Entrance Test (NEET) came to be introduced and further was\n\nto be actually conducted by MCI itself. Accordingly, by majority, the\n\nSupreme Court struck down the amendments to the MCI\n\nRegulations by which such NEET came to be introduced. Therefore,\n\nit cannot be said that clause 9(VII) of MCI Regulations 2012, which\n\nprovides that 50% of seats in Postgraduate Diploma Courses shall\n\nbe reserved for Medical Officers in Government service was not in-\n\nexistence or had been struck down by the Supreme Court. Further,\n\nas observed earlier, this issue is irrelevant particularly as there can\n\nbe no dispute that the State, even de hors MCI Regulations is\n\ncompetent to take a policy decision in this regard. Besides, in the\n\npresent case, this Court by its judgment and order dated 5.7.2012\n\nhad issued specific directions to the State to come out with an\n\nappropriate policy keeping in mind the interest of both, in-service\n\ncandidates as well as non in-service candidates. There is no reason\n\nto presume that the considerations adverted to by this Court in its\n\njudgment and order dated 5.7.2012 were not taken into account by\n\nthe State in taking the policy decision.\n\n110/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 111 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n49] The contention that MCI is only concerned with\n\nspecifications of minimum standards and therefore has no role to\n\nplay in the matter of admissions to medical colleges may be well\n\nfounded. However, the issue as to whether determination of\n\nextent of reservation is not a part of determination of standards\n\nis not free from doubt. The Supreme Court in the case of\nDr.\n\nPreeti Srivastava\n(supra), has in terms observed that it is for an\n\nexpert body such as the MCI to lay down the extent of reservations\n\n(paragraph 24).\n\nThe position appears to have been reiterated in\n\nparagraph 23 of the decision in case of\nGopal Tirthani\n(supra).\n\nIn\n\nthe case of\nChristian Medical Colleges\n(supra), one of the issues\n\nframed was whether the views expressed by the Constitution Bench\n\nin the case of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\n(supra) have any impact on the\n\nissues raised in said batch of Petitions.\n\nA careful reading of the\n\ndecision in the case of\nChristian Medical College\n(supra) would\n\nindicate that the contention of the learned counsels for the\n\nPetitioners that\nChristian Medical College\n(supra) has watered down\n\nthe ratio of\nDr. Preeti Srivastava\n(supra) is not at all well founded.\n\nIn\n\nthe case of\nChristian Medical College\n(supra), the Supreme Court\n\nhas essentially ruled that the MCI, itself conducting NEET, as\n\nopposed to providing for NEET cannot be said to have determined\n\nstandards for Postgraduate Medical Education. Accordingly, the\n\nnotification to the extent it enabled the MCI to itself conduct NEET\n\n111/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 112 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncame to be struck down.\n\n50] In this case, it is not necessary to go into the larger issue as to\n\nwhether the MCI Regulations bind the State in matter of formulation\n\nof policy when it comes to admission to Postgraduate Medical\n\nCourses concerned. Suffice to state that there is a long line of\n\ndecisions which takes the view that Regulations framed by the MCI\n\nin the matter of Graduate or Postgraduate Medical Education relate\n\nto Entry 66 List-I of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the State\n\nin exercise of its executive powers relatable to Entry 25 List - III of\n\nthe Constitution of India cannot frame policies which may be\n\ninconsistent with or repugnant to the MCI Regulations. At this stage,\n\nhowever, it is not necessary to go into this issue, particularly as it is\n\nclear that the State could have formulated the policy contained in\n\nGR dated 2.7.2013, even without reference to the MCI Regulations\n\nand in exercise of its executive power under 162 of the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n51] It must be stated to the credit of Mr. Anturkar, learned senior\n\nAdvocate appearing in some of the Petitions that he very specifically\n\nsubmitted that he is not raising any ground on the basis of doctrine\n\nof promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation, in view of the\n\ndecision of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Ashwin P.\n\n112/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 113 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nPimpalwar vs. State of Maharashtra\n- 1991 Mh.L.J. 1336. Mr.\n\nSakseria and Mr. Khandeparkar were, however, unclear as to\n\nwhether they were relying upon such doctrines in support of their\n\nrespective Petitions or not.\n\n52] Lest the point remains un-answered, it is necessary to point\n\nout that in none of the Petitions there are any specific pleadings\n\nsufficient to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or legitimate\n\nexpectation.\nIn the case of\nDr. Ashok Kumar Maheshwari vs State\n\nOf U.P.-\n(1998) 2 SCC 502, the Supreme Court has held that \"bald\n\npleadings cannot be made the foundation for invoking the doctrine\n\nof promissory estoppel\". In the case of Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd.\n\nvs. Commercial Tax Officer - 2005 (1) SCC 625, the Supreme Court\n\nhas held that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel\n\nclear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the Petition itself\n\nby the party invoking the doctrine and bald expressions without any\n\nsupporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted\n\nbecause the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position\n\nrelying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient\n\nto press into aid the doctrine.\n\n53] Apart from absence of any specific pleadings, the decision of\n\nthe Full Bench of this Court in the case of Ashwin Pimpalwar\n\n113/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 114 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n(supra), which lays down that the doctrines of promissory estoppel\n\nand legitimate expectation will have no application in relation to\n\nadmissions to Postgraduate Courses in Medical Colleges run by or\n\nunder the control of the State Government, cannot be just brushed\n\naside. Mr. Sakseria, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners\n\ndid not place reliance upon any decision of this Court or the\n\nSupreme Court of India which has taken a view contrary to the that\n\nexpressed by the Full Bench of this Court in the case of\nAshwin\n\nPimpalwar\n(supra). In my opinion, the feeble contention based upon\n\ndoctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation stands\n\nfully answered by the dictum of the Full Bench of this Court.\n\n54] In the case of\nAshwin Pimpalwar\n(supra) this Court was called\n\nupon to consider plea of promissory estoppel in respect of similar\n\nrules framed under\nArticle 166\nof the Constitution of India, though in\n\na different context. Under the earlier Government Resolution of\n\n1971, admission to the post graduate courses was on the basis of\n\nthe marks obtained in the \"subject concerned\" at the final M.B.B.S.\n\nexamination. The marks in the subject which was opted for post-\n\ngraduation study were alone to be considered as decisive. However,\n\nunder subsequent resolution of 1989, the \"aggregate marks\"\n\nobtained at the first, second and final M.B.B.S. examinations were\n\nthe decisive criterion. This change in rules was challenged by\n\n114/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 115 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ninvoking the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate\n\nexpectations. The Full Bench rejected such challenge by observing\n\nthat it was not possible to accept the contention that the prospectus\n\nonce issued by the Government, cannot be altered at all at a\n\nsubsequent stage. The Government which has competence to issue\n\nrules or regulations, has, as a corrollary, powers to amend or alter or\n\neven repeal and reissue such rules and regulations. It was difficult to\n\naccept the proposition that the rule of promissory estoppel operates\n\neven qua the rules for admission to the medical colleges. Altered\n\nsituations needed alteration in the rules and if on the basis of the\n\nrelevant material, the Government comes to the conclusion that the\n\nrules need a change, the plea of promissory estoppel cannot be\n\nurged to abort such a change. The Full Bench expressed itself,\n\nthus :\n\n32. Does the rule of promissory estoppel operate so\nthat the admission rules once issued could not be\naltered subsequently by the Government? It is assumed\n\nin some decisions that a student preparing for the\nqualifying examination on the basis of the Prospectus\nrelating to postgraduate courses prevailing at that\nparticular point of time is entitled to continue to receive\nbenefits or advantages arising therefrom and\n\nconsequently no change can be made to his prejudice. It\nis difficult to accept such a broad proposition. Students\nentering educational institutions with the ultimate aim of\ncompleting their scholastic career at the peak are\nexpected to strive for academic excellence, and\naccordingly, it cannot be assumed that a student would\nonly look at a GR operating at or about the time when he\nintensifies the preparation for the qualifying examination\nand regulating admission to post-graduate courses.\n\n115/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 116 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nThen again, a student is indeed expected to do his best\nthroughout his scholastic career. The heights are\nreached not by a sudden flight. They are reached by\n\nthose who toil upwards in the night while their\ncompanions slept. (The borrowing from the lines of\nLongfellow is acknowledged). In a highly competitive\n\nexamination there is a neck to neck race even among\nthose who spare no pains or times to achieve the\ncoveted goal. Quite often, imponderable factors or\nfortuitous circumstances may affect the fate. Under such\n\ncircumstances, it would be unrealistic to posit a theory of\npromissory estoppel based on the elusive concept of the\npreparation time for the qualifying examination.\n\n35. Consider, again, some actualities of life. It may be\n\nthat the Government may feel that an amendment is\nneeded even after the prospectus is published.\n\nSuppose, for example, a diploma or a degree or the\nstudy in a particular educational institution is treated as\nequivalent for the qualification provided in the\n\nprospectus. If subsequently the Government receives\nreliable evidence that the institution is either non-existent\nor a fraudulent one, cannot the prospectus be amended\nby deleting the equivalence accorded to such diploma or\n\ndegree? There cannot be, on principle, any such\nprohibition for the Government to introduce such a\n\nchange.\n\n44. Is that principle attracted, having regard to the\nfactual aspects and the circumstances available here?\nWe have indicated earlier, while discussing the doctrine\n\nof promissory estoppel, some of the peculiar features of\nacademic pursuits. They are not to be equated with\ncommercial activities or trade dealings, which raise\nquestions of immediate and easily exigible profits and\nother advantages. In particular, prosecuting a\n\npostgraduate professional course could not be linked\nwith a narrow and selfish desire for promotion of private\ninterest. The very concept of a profession is the\nantithesis of activities of a lesser calibre. Merely\nbecause of a promulgation of a particular rule or order\nby the Government authorities, a student particularly\naspiring for a post-graduate degree, and that too in a\nprofessional course, cannot with grace or legal force\ncontend that he could have a legitimate expectation in\n\n116/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 117 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthe continuity of that advantage or benefit arising from\nthe order which held the field at particular time despite\nan overriding or even a reasonable need of change.\n\nWhen viewed from the point of view of the duty of a\nGovernment to effect appropriate changes, whether it be\nin the matter of legislation, pure and simple, or in relation\n\nto its executive instructions, if and when circumstances\nwarrant the same, such a restriction would be to make\nsocieties stagnant and the Government non-functional.\n\n55] There were neither any submissions made, much less any\n\nspecific pleadings that the State had at any time held out any\n\nunequivocal representation that the policy of providing reservations\n\nor quota for in-service candidates for admission to Postgraduate\n\nDegree Courses would continue indefinitely or for some determinate\n\ntenure. In absence of such representation, there arises no question\n\nof invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\nIn the case of\n\nVyankappa N.Patki vs. State of Maharashtra\n- 1998 (2) Mh.L.J. 417,\n\na Division Bench of this Court declined to apply the doctrine of\n\npromissory estoppel, even when tuition fees were increased by the\n\nState whilst students were undergoing their course in Medical\n\nColleges, by observing that no promise was made either in the\n\nprospectus or in the rules for admission that the fees prevailing at\n\nthe time of entry to the course would remain unchanged throughout\n\nthe entire course.\n\n56] Merely because a case does not fall within the parameters of\n\n117/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 118 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nthe doctrine of promissory estoppel, the Petitioners cannot fall back\n\nupon the doctrine of legitimate expectation. There is a considerable\n\nand real difference between expectation and anticipation. There is\n\nno point in confusing one with the other. Besides, the decision of the\n\nFull Bench in the case of\nAshwin Pimpalwar\n(supra), affords the\n\ncomplete answer to such plea as well.\n\n57] In the case of\nUnion of India vs. Hindustan Development\n\nCorporation\n- 1993 (3) SCC 499, the Supreme Court has observed\n\nthat the decision taken by the Authority must be found to be\n\narbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest, where the\n\ndoctrine of legitimate expectation is to be applied. If it is a question\n\nof policy, even by way of change of old policy, the Courts cannot\n\nintervene with the decision on the ground of legitimate expectation.\n\n58] In the case of\nPunjab Communication Limited vs. Union of\n\nIndia\n- 1999 (4) SCC 727, the Supreme Court observed that change\n\nin policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be\n\njustified on \"Wednesbury reasonableness\". The decision-maker has\n\nthe choice in balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change\n\nin policy. It is therefore, clear that the choice of policy is for the\n\ndecision-maker and not the Court. The legitimate substantive\n\n118/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 119 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nexpectation merely permits the Court to find out if the change of\n\npolicy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is\n\nirrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have\n\nmade. A claim based merely on legitimate expectation without\n\nanything more cannot ipso facto give a right. For legal purposes,\n\nexpectation is not same as anticipation. Legitimacy of an\n\nexpectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of\n\nlaw.\n\n59]\n\nIn the context of the application of doctrine of legitimate\n\nexpectation to education policy, the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh vs. Himachal Pradesh Nizi Vyavsayik\n\nPrishikshan Kendra Sangh\n- (2011) 6 SCC 597, reversed the High\n\nCourt which had granted relief applying doctrine of legitimate\n\nexpectation, by observing thus:\n\n21. The High Court has lost sight of the fact that\n\neducation is a dynamic system and courses/subjects\nhave to keep changing with regard to market demand,\nemployability potential, availability of infrastructure, etc.\nNo institute can have a legitimate right or expectation to\nrun a particular course forever and it is the pervasive\n\npower and authority vested in the Government to frame\npolicy and guidelines for progressive and legitimate\ngrowth of the society and create balances in the arena\ninclusive of imparting technical education from time to\ntime. Inasmuch as the institutions found fit were allowed\nto run other courses except the three mentioned above,\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation was not\ndisregarded by the State. Inasmuch as ultimately it is the\nresponsibility of the State to provide good education,\n\n119/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 120 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ntraining and employment, it is best suited to frame a\npolicy or either modify/alter a decision depending on the\ncircumstance based on relevant and acceptable\n\nmaterials. The courts do not substitute their views in the\ndecision of the State Government with regard to policy\nmatters. In fact, the courts must refuse to sit as appellate\n\nauthority or super legislature to weigh the wisdom of\nlegislation or policy decision of the Government unless it\nruns counter to the mandate of the Constitution.\n\n22. With regard to the importance of human resources,\nespecially manpower requirement in various professional\nand technical fields, the Government is free to frame its\npolicy, alter or modify the same as to the needs of the\nsociety. In such matters, the courts cannot interfere lightly\n\nas if the Government is unaware of the situation.\n\n60]\n\nThe learned counsels appearing of the Petitioners then\n\ncontended that the GR dated 2.7.2013 had in fact been stayed by\n\nthis Hon'ble Court in its interim order dated 4.7.2013 in Writ Petition\n\nNo.5290 of 2013 and therefore the State had no right whatsoever to\n\nrely upon the same as its policy in clause 7.1 of the Brochure of\n\nPGM-CET 2014. The learned counsels contended that by interim\n\norder dated 4.7.2013, this Court, upon due consideration of GRs\n\ndated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 issued directions that the position\n\nwhich prevailed prior to the judgment of the Division Bench dated\n\n5.7.2012 (supra) should prevail. This, according to the Petitioners,\n\nconstitutes a clear judicial snub to the GR dated 2.7.2013.\n\n61] A careful reading of the interim order dated 4.7.2013 in Writ\n\nPetition No.5290 of 2013 would indicate that such is not the position.\n\n120/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 121 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nIn the first place, the interim order dated 4.7.2013 concerns\n\nadmissions to the Postgraduate Courses in the academic year 2013-\n\n14. The interim order came to be passed upon this Court being\n\nappraised that despite directions contained in the judgment and\n\norder dated 5.7.2012 (supra), the State has not issued any GR \"well\n\nin time\". Accordingly, this Court observed that it was making the\n\ninterim order \"without going into factual aspect as to what decision\n\nhas been taken by the Government in the GRs dated 21.6.2013 and\n\n2.7.2013\". Further this Court made it clear that insofar as the effect\n\nof two GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same\n\ncan be taken into consideration at the final hearing of the Petition\n\nand that the Petitions be disposed of finally at the stage of\n\nadmission. From all this, it is clear that the interim order was not to\n\napply for the admission to the Postgraduate Courses for the\n\nacademic year 2014-15 as it was reasonably expected that the\n\nPetitions would be taken up for final hearing before the\n\ncommencement of the academic year 2014-15. The Petitions have\n\naccordingly been so taken up for final hearing. In the circumstances,\n\nI see no merit in the submission that the GR dated 2.7.2013 was\n\n\"stayed\" by the interim order dated 4.7.2013. If this submission is to\n\nbe stretched any further, then it would mean that even the GR dated\n\n21.6.2013, of which the Petitioners now seek implementation was\n\nalso similarly \"stayed\". In the context of admissions for the academic\n\n121/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 122 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nyear 2014-15, which were to commence in April 2014, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the GR dated 2.7.2013 or the admission Brochure dated\n\n28.11.2013, which clarifies policy, was not issued \"well in time\".\n\nClearly, therefore, there is no merit in the submission of the\n\nPetitioners that the GR dated 2.7.2013 could not have been made or\n\naccepted as the Government policy in the matter of reservations to\n\nin-service candidates.\n\n62] In the present case, it cannot be said that the change in the\n\npolicy is abrupt, so as to warrant interference. Admittedly, there was\n\nan issue with regard to determination of quota or seats for in-service\n\ncandidates, which prompted the filing of Writ Petition No. 5214 of\n\n2012. The said Petition was disposed of by judgment and order\n\ndated 5.7.2012, in which the manner of computation of seats was in\n\nfact upheld, but directions were issued to the State to come out with\n\nResolution specifying the policy to be adopted from the academic\n\nyear 2013-14. As there was delay in formulation of policy, Writ\n\nPetition No.5290 of 2013 came to be filed, wherein interim order was\n\nmade on 4.7.2013 that admissions be proceeded with on basis of\n\nthe position prevalent prior to the judgment and order dated\n\n5.7.2012. By this time, the policy as contained in GR dated 2.7.2013\n\nwas already in place. The Brochure published on 28.11.2013, also\n\nmade it clear that for the academic year 2014-15, reservations/quota\n\n122/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 123 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nfor in-service candidates would be in accordance with the policy\n\ncontained in GR dated 2.7.2013. Thus, in the context of academic\n\nyear 2014-15, it cannot be said that the GR was not issued \"well in\n\ntime\". Accordingly, it is not possible to accede to the submissions of\n\nthe learned counsels for the Petitioners that that the position which\n\nprevailed at the time when the interim order dated 4.7.2013 was\n\nmade, prevails even now at the stage of final hearing of the\n\nPetitions. Further, there is no merit in the contention that the change\n\nin policy as disclosed in GR dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013, amounts\n\nto an abrupt change. It is not and it can perhaps not be the case of\n\nany of the Petitioners that they have altered their positions\n\ndrastically, relying upon the GR dated 21.6.2013 and consequently,\n\nit would be unjust or inequitable to permit enforcement of policy\n\ncontained in GR dated 2.7.2013. In the context of admissions for the\n\nacademic year 2014-15, the change between 21.6.2013 and\n\n2.7.2013, is by no means such as to deride the same as being\n\nabrupt or arbitrary. If the submission of the Petitioners is to be\n\naccepted, then the State would be in no position to implement\n\nchanged policy until all the current in-service candidates secure\n\nadmissions against reservations or quota for Postgraduate Degree\n\nand Diploma Courses. This, in my opinion, would not be a\n\nreasonable or a rational manner of giving effect to State policy.\n\n123/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 124 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\n63] There is yet another aspect that needs mention. In the event,\n\nthe Petitioners' plea that G.R. dated 2.7.2013 is arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable, null and void is accepted and the said G.R dated\n\n2.7.2013 is struck down then, that by itself would not revive the GR\n\ndated 21.6.2013 which had been cancelled by the GR dated\n\n2.7.2013. There is no such principle on basis of which it could be\n\nurged that once a GR is quashed, the earlier GR which it had\n\nsuperseded or cancelled automatically revives. Further it is not for\n\nthe Court to order such revival, because under such guise, the Court\n\nwould itself be enacting a policy. In case, a Court finds a policy to be\n\narbitrary, discriminatory, unconstitutional, null and void, it is within\n\nthe domain of the Court to strike down same. However, it is not for\n\nthe Court to re-formulate any policy or to declare that any old policy\n\nstands revived.\n\n64] In the case of\nState of Uttar Pradesh vs. Hirendra Pal Singh\n-\n\n2011 (5) SCC 305, the Supreme Court observed thus:\n\n27. Thus, the High Court erred in issuing directions to\nthe State authorities to proceed, as an interim measure,\n\nunder a non-existing law. Such an order seems to have\nbeen passed only to fill up the vacuum. Generally\nquashing of a subsequent notification would not affect in\nrevival of an earlier notification in whose place the\nsubsequent notification had been issued, however, the\nlegal effect of an earlier law when the later law enacted in\nits place is declared invalid, does not depend merely upon\nthe use of the words like substitution or suppression. It\ndepends upon the totality of circumstances and the\n\n124/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 125 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\ncontext in which they are used. (Vide B.N. Tewari v. Union\nof India & anr-AIR 1965 SC 1430; Indian Express\nNewspapers (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. Union of India & anr-,\n\nAIR 1986 SC 515; West U.P. Sugar Mills Association v.\n\nState of U.P. - AIR 2002 SC 948;\nZile Singh v. State of\nHaryana\n- (2004) 8 SCC 1; and\nState of Kerala v. Peoples\n\nUnion\nfor Civil Liberties -(2009) 8 SCC 46).\n\n28.\nIn\nFirm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid and Co. v. State of\nMadras\n- AIR 1963 SC 928, this Court while dealing with a\n\nsimilar issue held :\n\n\" 20. .....Once the old rule has been substituted by\nthe new rule, it ceases to exist and it does not\nautomatically get revived when the new rule is held\nto be invalid.\"\n\n29. Therefore, it is evident that under certain\n\ncircumstances, an Act which stood repealed, may revive\nin case the substituted Act is declared ultra\nvires/unconstitutional by the court on the ground of\n\nlegislative competence etc., however, the same shall not\nbe the position in case of subordinate legislation. In the\ninstant case, the L.R. Manual is consisted of executive\ninstructions, which can be replaced any time by another\n\nset of executive instructions. (Vide Johri Mal).\n\n30. Therefore, question of revival of the repealed\n\nclauses of LR Manual in case the substituted clauses are\nstruck down by the court, would not arise. In view of this,\nthe interim order would amount to substituting the legal\npolicy by the judicial order, and thus not sustainable.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n65] In the case of Brihanmumbai Mahanagar Palika vs. Secretary,\n\nBar Council of Maharashtra - 2012(6) Mh.L.J. 407, a Full Bench of\n\nthis Court, in a similar context, observed thus:\n\n30. For these reasons, we have arrived at the\nconclusion that the deletion of the second and third\nparagraphs of Rule 49 and the corresponding deletion\nby the State Bar Council of the exception cannot be\nregarded as ultra vires or unreasonable. Moreover, we\n\n125/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 126 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nmust also take note of the position in law that the\nCourt cannot issue a writ of Mandamus to the\nlegislature to enact a law and similarly a Court cannot\n\ndirect a subordinate legislative body to enact a\nparticular rule. In State of Tamil Nadu vs. K.Shyam\nSunder, the Supreme Court held that if an amending\n\nAct of the legislature is struck down for want of\nlegislative competence or on the ground that it is\nviolative of the fundamental rights in Part-III of the\nConstitution, it would be unenforceable in view of\n\nArticle 13(2)\nand the old Act would revive. But this\n\nproposition of law, the Supreme Court held, is not\napplicable to subordinate legislation. Hence, even if\nthe Court were to strike down the amendment made to\nRule 49, that would not result in a revival of Rule 49 in\nits original form. We must, however, clarify that for the\n\nreasons that we have already indicated, we have come\nto the conclusion that the deletion of the second and\n\nthird paragraphs of Rule 49 was valid.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n66] In the case of Laker Airways Ltd.. Department of Trade -\n\n(1977) 2 ALL ER 182 , the Lord Lawton observed thus:\n\n\"In the United Kingdom aviation policy is determined by\n\nministers within the legal framework set out by parliament.\nJudges have nothing to do with either policy - making or\n\nthe carrying out of policy. Their function is to decide\nwhether a minister has acted within the powers given to\nhim by statute or the common law. If he is declared by\ncourt after due process of law, to have acted outside his\n\npowers, he must stop doing what he has done until such\ntime as Parliament gives him the powers he wants. In a\ncase such as this I regard myself as a referee. I can blow\nmy judicial whistle when the ball goes out of play; but\nwhen the game restarts I must neither take part in it nor\n\ntell the players how to play.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n67] Therefore, even if this Court were to be persuaded to strike\n\ndown the GR dated 2.7.2013, the issue as to what the policy should\n\n126/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::\n\nssm 127 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nbe after such striking down, would have to be left to the\n\ndetermination of the State. Otherwise, as observed by the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of\nHirendra Pal Singh\n(supra), this Court would be\n\nsubstituting State policy by a judicial order.\n\n68] Insofar as Mr. Anturkar's submission that the field is covered\n\nby the 1998 Act and therefore, the State is denuded of its executive\n\npowers to issue GR dated 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same is not\n\nacceptable. The perusal of the provisions of 1998 Act would indicate\n\nthat the same primarily relate to establishment and incorporation of\n\nthe University of Health Sciences in the State and to provide for\n\nmatters connected therewith and incidental thereto. On the basis of\n\nprovisions contained in\nSection 5(k)\nof the 1998 Act, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the power to prescribe the reservations or define the extent\n\nof reservation is vested exclusively in the University and the State\n\nshall have no say or powers in that regard. Besides, it is the\n\ncontention of Mr. Anturkar himself that if the statute contains\n\nprovision for making sub-ordinate legislation, then so long as such\n\nlegislation has not been enacted, the statute although brought in\n\nforce, cannot be made operative. However, even assuming that Mr.\n\nAnturkar's submission that the field stands occupied by the 1998 Act\n\nis to be accepted, then even\nin that case\nthere is no question of\n\nrevival of an executive instruction of 1990, on basis of which the\n\n127/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:45 :::\n\nssm 128 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nPetitioners can claim for any reservations for in-service candidates\n\nto Postgraduate Degree Courses.\n\n69] There were no submissions advanced by the Petitioners with\n\nregard to the manner of working out of the reserved seats, although\n\nthe reliefs were sought for in some of the Petitions in this regard. As\n\na matter of abundant caution, therefore, it is made clear that this\n\nCourt finds no infirmity whatsoever in the manner in which the\n\npercentage of seats has been worked out for purposes of\n\nreservations to in-service candidates to the Postgraduate Diploma\n\nCourses. In fact, in my opinion, this issue stands settled by the\n\njudgment of this Court dated 5.7.2012(supra) wherein at paragraph\n\n6, this Court observed thus:\n\n6. .........................In that view of the matter, the\nquestion that can be considered by the Court is as to\nwhether the modality which has been followed by the\nState Government as explained above is so patently\narbitrary as to warrant the interference of this Court on the\n\nground that there is a violation of the fundamental right\nunder\nArticle 14.\nThe object of an in service quota is to\nprovide an incentive for government service. The in\nservice quota is made available to candidates who are in\ngovernment service, to pursue postgraduate degree or\n\ndiploma courses. It cannot be held that the underlying\nrationale for excluding the seats which are set apart for\nthe All India quota and the seats in non-clinical subjects is\nviolative of\nArticle 14.\nThe State Government has no\ncontrol over the allotment of seats under the All India\nquota. If the government has taken a policy decision to\nthe effect that since in service candidates are required to\nattend to patients, consequently, the reservation should\nbe allocated to clinical seats, it would be difficult for the\n\n128/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:45 :::\n\nssm 129 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nCourt to set aside such a policy on the ground of an\ninfringement of\nArticle 14.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n70] In light of aforesaid position, there is no reason to decide the\n\nissues raised in Writ Petition No.1933 of 2014. Dr. Sadavarte, made\n\nit clear that he has no quarrel with the policy expressed in clause 7.1\n\nof the Brochure and the GR dated 2.7.2013, which according to him\n\nis consistent with MCI Regulations. The Writ Petition No.1933 of\n\n2014, is accordingly disposed of.\n\n71] In the result, I see no merit in any of the remaining Petitions.\n\nThe same are liable to be dismissed and are so dismissed. There\n\nshall however, be no orders as to costs.\n\n72] In view of disposal of main Petitions, Civil Application\n\nNos.491 of 2014 does not survive and is accordingly disposed of. In\n\nso far as Civil Application No.1509 of 2013 for intervention is\n\nconcerned, the same is formally allowed.\n\n(M. S. SONAK, J.)\n\nIn view of above difference of opinion, it is necessary to\n\n129/130\n\n::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:45 :::\n\nssm 130 901-wp-judgment-5290.13\n\nplace the files/records, urgently before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for an\n\nappropriate order/direction, including for reference and/or to place\n\nthe matters before a larger Bench on the following point of reference:-\n\na) Whether the State Government Circular dated 2\n\nJuly 2013 and all actions based upon it, to the\n\nextent of deleting totally in-service reservation for\n\nthe Post-Graduate Degree Course are valid or\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia, being arbitrary, discriminatory, irrational and\n\ninvalid?\n\nThe interim order based upon the statement so made by\n\nthe learned Government Pleader to continue till further order.\n\nParties are at liberty to apply for appropriate order at any\n\ntime in view of urgency in the matter.\n\n(M.
