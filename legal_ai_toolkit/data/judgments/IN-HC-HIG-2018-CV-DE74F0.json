P. THAKER\n\nPage 4 of 102\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nDate : 28/12/2018\n\nORAL JUDGMENT\n\n(PER : HONOURABLE MS.JUSTICE HARSHA DEVANI)\n\n1. This batch of letters patent appeals is directed against\nthe common judgment and order dated 21.4.2017 passed by\nthe learned Single Judge in the captioned writ petitions\nwhereby the learned Single Judge has inter alia issued\ndirections to fill in the forty one vacancies which were left\nunfilled on account of non-joining of candidates by applying\nthe principles laid down by this court in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\nv. State of Gujarat\n, (2002) 2 GLR 1011. It appears that\ninitially there was no challenge to the impugned judgment. The\nState Government and the Gujarat Public Service Commission\ndecided to accept the judgment and started implementing the\nsame and towards that end passed an order dated 12.12.2017\nappointing five candidates who had earlier been appointed to\nposts of their lower preference, to the post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police wherein it was indicated that those\nfive candidates would be placed at merit No.49, 54, 57, 58 and\n130, respectively. Since these candidates were to be placed\nabove the appellants and their appointments were likely to\nhave an impact on the seniority of the appellants, the\nappellants preferred these letters patent appeals together with\napplications for leave to appeal as they were not parties to the\nmain petitions. By an order dated 24.1.2018, leave to appeal\ncame to be granted keeping all issues open. Since there was a\ndelay of 233 days in preferring the appeals, applications for\ncondonation of delay also came to be filed. By an order dated\n29.6.2018, the applications for condonation of delay came to\nbe rejected by this court. Being aggrieved, the appellants\n\nPage 5 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\napproached the Supreme Court, which by an order dated\n11.7.2018, condoned the delay and observed that the appeals\nbe heard finally in accordance with law.\n\n2. In Special Civil Applications No.6057, 6966, 6967 to 6973,\n5923, 7246, 6110, 6108, 6106, 7581, 6107, 5758, 8252 and\n6786 of 2011, the select list dated 26.4.2011 was subject\nmatter of challenge. Some of the petitions were based on the\nallegation that the revised select list had been prepared on the\nwrong application of the decision of the Supreme Court in the\ncase of\nPublic Service Commission, Uttaranchal v.\nMamta Bisht and others\n(2010) 12 SCC 204; whereas others\nwere based on the allegation that the revised list was prepared\non the wrong application of the decision of the Supreme Court\nin the case of\nUnion of India v. Ramesh Ram and others\n\n(2010) 7 SCC 234.\n\n3. The petitioner in Special Civil Application No.6543 of\n2001 challenged his exclusion from the category of meritorious\nreserved category (MRC) candidates because he had availed\nage relaxation of SC category and prayed that the select list\nbe struck down to that extent.\n\n4. In Special Civil Application No.11163 of 2012, the\npetitioner sought a direction to the respondents to give\nappointment to the petitioner as Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice, Class-I as SEBC male candidate on the vacancy arising\ndue to non-joining of one SEBC male candidate Mr. Vadhvana\nRohitkumar Rameshkumar and to direct the respondents to\ngive all consequential benefits of seniority and monetary\nbenefits as if the petitioner was offered the appointment as\n\nPage 6 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Police Class-I immediately after the\nvacancy arose due to non-joining of Mr. Vadhvana Rohitkumar\nRameshkumar.\n\n5. Thus, by and large the petitions were directed against the\nrevised select list dated 26.4.2011, whereas two petitions were\non a slightly different footing where reliefs as referred to\nhereinabove were claimed. Apart from the captioned petitions,\nanother petition being Special Civil Application No. 8203 of\n2012 came to be heard along with this group of petitions and\nwas decided by the impugned common judgment and order. In\nthe said petition there were allegations of favouritism and\nmanipulation of record to appoint one Reema Munshi the\nrespondent No.4 therein on the post of Deputy Superintendent\nof Police, who according to the petitioner therein was ineligible\nto hold that post. The petitioner therein had prayed for a writ\nof quo warranto against the said respondent No.4. The said\npetition came to be allowed by holding that Reema Munshi was\nineligible to hold the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police\nand consequently, she was directed to forthwith vacate the\npost. The said Reema Munshi challenged the impugned\njudgment and order to the extent it was passed in Special Civil\nApplication No. 8203 of 2012 by way of a letters patent appeal\nbeing Letters Patent Appeal No. 727 of 2017, which came to be\ndecided by a judgment and order dated 20/21.12.2017\nwhereby the letters patent appeal came to be allowed and the\ndirection passed by the learned Single Judge to the respondent\nNo.4 to vacate the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police\ncame to be set aside. Since the fact that this petition was\nclubbed with the captioned petitions and all the petitions were\n\nPage 7 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nheard and decided together has some bearing on the outcome\nof the captioned petitions, it is necessary to place these facts\non record.\n\n6. Since in majority of the petitions, the validity of the\nrevised select list dated 26.4.2011 has been challenged, the\nmain controversy in these appeals revolves around the same.\n\n7. For the sake of convenience, reference is made to the\naverments as appearing in Special Civil Applications No.6057\nof 2011.\n\n8. Special Civil Application No.6057 of 2011 has been filed\nby, in all, ten petitioners. The petitioners No.1 to 5 are women\nbelonging to the General Category and the petitioners No.6 to\n9 are men belonging to the SEBC category whereas the\npetitioner No.10 is a woman belonging to the SEBC category.\n\n9. The facts, as averred in the petition, are that the Gujarat\nPublic Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as the\n\"Commission\") published an advertisement dated 26.6.2006\nbeing Advertisement No.87/06/07 for the posts of Gujarat Civil\nServices (Class-I & II). Being eligible and qualified, the\npetitioners applied for the same and successfully passed the\npreliminary examination as well as the main examination and\nthey were placed in the final select list published by the\nCommission vide notification dated 13.5.2010. The petitioners\nwere issued individual intimation letters dated 3.8.2010 to the\neffect that they were declared successful and the result\ndeclared by the Commission on 13.5.2010 had been made\nfinal. Thereafter, the petitioners awaited the appointment\n\nPage 8 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\norders; however, the Commission published\nnotice/advertisement dated 26.4.2011 whereby it had\ncancelled the aforesaid final selection list dated 13.5.2010 and\npublished a revised selection list wherein the petitioners were\nnot included. Being aggrieved, the petitioners approached this\ncourt by way of the above referred writ petitions.\n\n10. At this juncture it may also be germane to briefly refer to\nthe contentions raised in the petition, to understand the scope\nof such petitions.\n\n11. The contentions raised in the petitions are that once the\nfinal selection list was published, the preparation of the second\nlist without notice to the successful candidates was in breach\nof the principles of natural justice. It was contended that in the\nExamination Rules there is no power of review either with the\nState Government or the Commission, giving them the power\nto review the final selection list. It was also contended that the\nrespondents have ignored the binding precedent namely, the\njudgment of this court in Dr. Komal Manubhai Katara v.\nGPSC rendered in Letters Patent Appeal No.1412 of 2009 on\n10.9.2009.\nIt was contended that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in\nUnion of India v. Ramesh Ram\n, (2010) 7 SCC 234 is\nnot applicable to the facts of the present case, wherein rule\n16(2) of the Civil Services Examination Rules, 2005 came up\nfor interpretation whereas there is no equivalent of rule 16(2)\nin the Gujarat Civil Services (Class I and Class II) Competitive\nExamination Rules, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as \"the\nGujarat Rules\") which govern the present recruitment.\n\n12. It was also contended that the authorities have\n\nPage 9 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncommitted an illegality in not preparing the waiting list in the\nlight of the amendment dated 17.1.2009/19.1.2009 namely,\nthe Gujarat Civil Services (Class I and Class II) Competitive\nExamination Rules, 2009 whereby the existing rule 17 has\nbeen substituted by a new rule 17. It was contended that such\namendment which came into force in the year 2009 cannot be\nmade applicable to the present recruitment which was initiated\nby the advertisement dated 26.6.2006. It was submitted that\nsince all the 317 vacancies would not be likely to be filled up\nfrom the select list, a waiting list/extended merit list was\nrequired to be prepared so as to fill up the existing notified\nvacancies so as to do justice to the petitioners and other\nsimilarly situated candidates who would be getting\nappointments if all the 317 notified vacancies are completely\nfilled up.\n\n13. By the impugned judgment and order, the learned Single\nJudge has disposed of the petitions with the following\ndirections:-\n\n\"41. So far other petitions are concerned, the following\ndirections are issued.\n\n41.1 Though the impugned merit list dated 26.04.2011\nprepared and published by the Gujarat Public Service\nCommission is unsustainable on facts and in law, instead\nof setting aside the said merit list, (for the reasons noted\nin the body of the judgment, more particularly in para :\n\n35.1 and 35.3), and consequently setting aside all the\nappointments of about three hundred candidates and\ntheir further promotions in the respective hierarchy, it is\n\nPage 10 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ndirected that, the posts, which have remained unfilled\nbecause of non-joining of the candidates appointed by\nthe Government vide appointment orders, claimed to\nhave been issued on 06.05.2011, based on the impugned\nselect list dated 26.04.2011, shall be offered to the next\nmeritorious candidates in the recruitment in question\n(Advertisement No.87/2006-07). It is further directed\nthat, while giving such appointments, the ceiling of the\nnotified vacancies (total 317 vacancies) shall also be kept\nin view by the Authorities.\n\n41.2 While giving such appointments, the ratio\nlaid down\nby\nthis Court in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra), as\nconfirmed by the Supreme Court of India shall also be\nkept in view.\n\n41.3 The appointments of these candidates shall be\ntreated to be notional from 06.05.2011 and they shall be\nentitled to all consequential benefits, except arrears of\npay. (vide the decision of the Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of\nState of Jammu and Kashmir Vs. Sat Pal\n\nreported in (2013) 11 SCC 737).\n\nFor this purpose, the\nState Authorities may even take guidance from the\nprocedure which it had undertaken while giving effect to\nthe directions of this Court, in the case of\nD.G.Dalal\n\n(supra), which culminated into office orders passed by\nthe General Administration Department of the\nGovernment of Gujarat on 04.08.2008 and consequential\norders, the copies of which are made available to this\nCourt by the State.\n\n41.4 The above exercise shall be completed within a\nperiod of three months from the date of receipt of this\n\nPage 11 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\norder.\n\n14. Mr. Mihir Thakore, Senior Advocate, learned counsel with\nMs. Megha Jani, learned advocate for the appellants in each of\nthe appeals, invited the attention of the court to the decision of\nthe Supreme Court in the case of\nUnion of India v. Ramesh\nRam\n(supra), to submit that\nthe said decision\nwas delivered on\nthe basis of the rules framed by the Central Government. It\nwas submitted that rule 16 of the Civil Services Examination\nRules (hereinafter referred to as the \"CSE Rules\") relating to\nthe civil services examination held by the Union Public Service\nCommission came up for interpretation in that decision. The\nattention of the court was invited to sub-rule (4) of the CSE\nRules which provides for reduction of the total number of\nrecommended candidates by the number of candidates\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and\nOther Backward Classes who acquire the merit at or above the\nfixed general qualifying standard without availing themselves\nof any concession or relaxation in the eligibility criteria. Such\nrule also provides that the Commission shall prepare a list of\nrecommended candidates and shall also declare a consolidated\nreserve list of candidates which will include candidates from\nthe general and reserved categories ranking in order of merit\nbelow the last recommended candidate under each category.\nReference was made to sub-rule (5) of rule 16 of the CSE\nRules which provides for allocation of candidates\nrecommended in terms of sub-rule (4) by the Government to\nthe services and forwarding of requisition by the Government\nto the Commission for names of candidates from the reserve\nlist for filling up the vacancies which remain unfilled in each\n\nPage 12 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncategory. It was pointed out that rule 19 of the CSE Rules\nprovides that due consideration will be given at the time of\nmaking allocation on the results of the examination to the\npreferences expressed by a candidate for various services at\nthe time of his application. The appointment to various\nservices will also be governed by the Rules/Regulations in force\nas applicable to the services at the time of appointment.\n\nIt was\nsubmitted that the ratio of the decision in\nRamesh Ram\n\n(supra) is whether a person who gets a general seat is entitled\nto claim a reserved seat to get a better preference. That ratio\nis not regarding at what stage such selection is to be made.\n\n14.1 Reference was made to the Gujarat Rules as are\napplicable to the recruitment in question and more\nparticularly, rule 9 thereof, to submit that in terms of the said\nrule, once a candidate gives a post as his first preference, he\ncannot change it. It was submitted that the learned Single\nJudge has held that the choice of preference should be\nexercised at the time of appointment and not by the\nCommission at the time of forwarding the list. It was submitted\nthat the Commission does not give appointment and that the\nlist is prepared by the Commission as per the order of merit\nafter the examination and interview and considering the\npreferences given by the concerned candidates. The attention\nof the court was invited to the advertisement dated 26.6.2006,\nto point out that the Commission has to prepare the list as per\nthe vacancies advertised. Reference was made to rules 9 and\n22 of the Gujarat Rules, to submit that rule 22 contemplates\nforwarding of the results to the Government and the\nCommission has to forward the list as contemplated under rule\n22 read with rule 9 of the rules. It was submitted that the rules\n\nPage 13 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncontemplate preparation of a select list containing the names\nrecommended by the Commission to the extent of vacancies\nnotified and that all candidates other than those whose names\nare found in this list are unsuccessful candidates whose names\nwould be reflected in the list of unsuccessful candidates and\nthere is no other wait list or reserved list. It was submitted that\nthe Commission was required to give the order of preference\nas given by the candidates under rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules\nwhich was not to be revised under any circumstances.\nAs per\nrule 17 of the Gujarat Rules, the Commission was required to\nrecommend candidates for each post and class. While the\nappointments were to be given by the Government, the list\nwas to be prepared by the Commission and that the\nCommission has not committed any error in making the list.\nAccording to the learned counsel, it would make no difference\nwhether the list was made by the Government at the stage of\nappointment or by the Commission at the stage of\nrecommendation, inasmuch as in view of the proviso to sub-\nrule (1) of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules, the preference given by\neach candidate at the time of the interview test is final. It was\nsubmitted that the Commission or the Government will have to\noffer the higher post to the successful candidate as per his\npreference and that there is nothing improper or contrary to\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamesh\nRam\n(supra) insofar as the preparation of the list is concerned.\n\n14.2 It was further submitted that by the Gujarat Civil\nServices (Class I and Class II) Competitive Examination\n(Amendment) Rules, 2009, which were notified vide\nnotification dated 17.1.2009, rule 17 of the Gujarat Rules of\n2000 came to be substituted and it was provided that there\n\nPage 14 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nshall be no waiting list and that the residual vacancies of posts,\nif any, due to non-joining of candidates (who have been\nallotted the post of Gujarat Civil Services Class I or Class II) for\nany reasons, shall be carried forward to the next occasion of\nrecruitment. It was submitted that the amendment is only\nclarificatory and does not modify the rule at all because even\nas per the existing rule, there was no scope of wait list. The\nGujarat Rules of 2000 also did not contemplate a wait list, but\ncontemplated a list of unsuccessful candidates. It was\nsubmitted that the first list was issued on 13.5.2010 and the\nrevised list was issued on 26.4.2011. While making the first\nlist, they were bound to follow the rules as prevailing then. It\nwas submitted that the existing rules were of 2009 and the\nvacancies could not have been filled since the list of\nrecommended candidates was to the extent of vacant posts to\nbe filled up.\n\n14.3 It was submitted that five candidates did not join\nservice on the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police and the\nGovernment considering the Gujarat Rules of 2000, did not\nappoint any one to those posts and proceeded to fill seats in\nseriatim. It was submitted that no duty was cast upon the\nGovernment to extend the list in the manner suggested.\nReference was made to the notification dated 6.5.2011\n(Annexure-G to the petition), to point out that out of 68\nvacancies for the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police, 68\nappointments came to be made by the Government. However,\nthe candidates at Serial No.19, 29, 31 and 34 from the general\ncategory candidates and No.42 from the Socially and\nEducationally Backward Classes (SEBC) did not join. Therefore,\nthere were five vacant posts of Deputy Superintendent of\n\nPage 15 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nPolice, including one post in the SEBC category, which were\nnever filled up and were carried forward in the next\nrecruitment and were filled up.\n\n14.4 Insofar as the applicability of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is\nconcerned, it was contended that the view taken by the\nlearned Single Judge is not correct.\n\nIt was submitted that\n\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) does not lay down any ratio as regards\nthe stage at which to apply the preference. It was submitted\nthat under rule 9(1) of the Gujarat Rules, once preference is\ngiven, it is final and the list was prepared accordingly which is\nnot contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in Ramesh\nRam.\n\n14.5 It was submitted that insofar as the applicability of\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nMamta Bisht\n\n(supra) is concerned, the only ground for holding that the list is\nnot in accordance therewith is that in other cases it has not\nbeen applied. Reference was made to paragraph 35.1 of the\nimpugned judgment, to submit that the question of exploring\nother options would arise only when the list is illegal whereas\nin the facts of the present case there being nothing illegal in\nthe revised list forwarded by the Commission, the question of\nexploring other options would not arise.\n\nIt was submitted that\non application of the decisions of the Supreme Court in\n\nRamesh Ram and Mamta Bisht\n(supra), forty candidates\nwere taken out of the first list of candidates recommended by\nthe Commission which has no relevance to the non-joining of\nother candidates.\n\nPage 16 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n14.6 Next, it was submitted that in case the successful\n\ncandidates do not join, if there is a wait list, it has to be\noperated or forty one posts in the list will remain vacant.\nHowever, the Gujarat Rules do not provide for any wait list and\nthere are only two lists; (i) a list of recommended candidates to\nthe extent of vacancies notified, and (ii) a list of unsuccessful\ncandidates. Accordingly, the candidates who were taken out of\nthe first list at the time of preparation of the revised list are\nalso amongst the unsuccessful candidates. It was submitted\nthat in the absence of a wait list, for the purpose of giving\neffect to the orders passed by the learned Single Judge, the\nvacant posts would be required to be filled from the list of\nunsuccessful candidates.\n\n14.7 Reference was made to the findings recorded by the\nlearned Single Judge in paragraph 35.3 of the impugned\njudgment, wherein the learned Judge has observed that the\nfigures of the persons affected by the impugned action of the\nrespondent authorities and the number of vacancies remaining\nunfilled from that very advertisement (notified vacancies) are\nalmost the same; thus, relief can be granted to the affected\ncandidates against the unfilled notified vacancies. It was\nsubmitted that either one of the lists, namely, the old list or\nthe revised list that can be operated. However, it cannot be\nsaid that the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nRamesh Ram and Mamta Bisht\n(supra) should also be\napplied and at the same time, the old list should also be\noperated. Referring to paragraph 39 of the impugned\njudgment wherein the learned Single Judge has held that the\nnotified vacancies which have remained unfilled because of\nnon-joining of candidates, need to be filled up by the State by\n\nPage 17 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\noffering the same to the next meritorious candidates whose\ndetails are already annexed with the merit list dated\n26.4.2011, it was submitted that there is no merit list and that\nthere is a list of successful candidates and a list of\nunsuccessful candidates and that the directions issued by the\nlearned Single Judge would result in giving effect to the list of\nunsuccessful candidates.\n\n14.8 It was pointed out that the candidate at Serial\nNo.221 was one Reema Munshi whose appointment had been\nchallenged by filing a writ of quo warranto and further that the\nlearned Single Judge has also made certain observations with\nregard to one Manek Hira, the candidate at Serial no.222. It\nwas submitted that if in the case of the said candidate, the\nGovernment had wrongly appointed her, it would make the\nappointment bad but it would not vitiate the list.\n\n14.9 Referring to the directions issued by the learned\nSingle Judge in paragraph 41.3 of the impugned order, it was\nsubmitted that if the appointments are to be notional with\nentitlement of consequential benefits, it directly affects the\nappellant as the appellants will be pushed down from the\npresent position.\n\n14.10 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nRajeshkumar Daria v. Rajasthan\nPublic Service Commission\n, (2007) 8 SCC 785, to point out\nthat in the facts of the said case the court has granted relief\nonly to the candidates who had come before it and had\nthought it fit, just and proper to accommodate those three\ncandidates without disturbing the selections and appointments\n\nPage 18 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nalready made.\n\n14.11 It was submitted that that view adopted by the\nlearned Single Judge that the decision of the Supreme Court in\nthe case of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) has not been properly\napplied and that the decision of the Supreme court in the case\nof\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) has been applied selectively, is not in\nconsonance with the said decisions. It was submitted that,\ntherefore, there being no infirmity in the revised list, the\nquestion of issuing such directions as have been issued by the\nlearned Single Judge would not arise and the impugned\njudgment and order passed by the learned Single Judge\ndeserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\n14.12 Insofar as the maintainability of the cross objections\nfiled by the petitioner of Special Civil Application No.11163 of\n2012 is concerned, the learned counsel\nplaced reliance upon\n\nthe decision of a Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court\nin the case of\nJabalpur Development Authority v. Y.S.\nSachan\n, 2004 (2) M.P.L.J. 178, wherein the court has held that\nthere can be no doubt that a respondent can defend the\njudgment pasted in a letters patent appeal where the order of\nthe Single Judge is under assail. The question that arises for\nconsideration is whether in such an appeal a cross-objection\ncan be filed. The court held that a party who is aggrieved by an\norder of the learned Single Judge can prefer an independent\nappeal. The cross objection has a different connotation. A cross\nobjection or a cross appeal is filed after receipt of the notice\nwithin the time provided under Order XLI, rule 22\nof the Code\nof Civil Procedure\n. But there is no concept of filing of cross\nobjection in a letters patent appeal. The court held that in a\n\nPage 19 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nletters patent appeal that arises from an appeal disposed of\nunder\nsection 96\nof the Code of Civil Procedure or in other\nappeal to which the Civil Procedure Code applies the matter\nwould be totally different and a cross objection would be\nmaintainable but in a matter relating to a writ appeal, no cross\nobjection can be filed. It was submitted that the present letters\npatent appeals having been filed against a judgment rendered\nin writ petitions, the cross objection is not maintainable.\n\n15. Mr. D. G. Shukla, learned advocate appearing on behalf of\nthe Gujarat Public Service Commission, submitted that for the\nreason that by virtue of the directions issued by the learned\nSingle Judge, the list prepared by the Commission was not\ndisturbed, the Commission did not deem it fit to challenge the\nimpugned judgment and order, despite certain strictures and\nobservations having been made therein. The attention of the\ncourt was invited to the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the\nCommission, to submit that the respondents have complied\nwith the directions contained in the impugned judgment. It was\nsubmitted that the list was revised consciously to apply the\nprinciples\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\nand Mamta Bisht\n(supra) and was forwarded to the State\nGovernment whereafter the appointments were made. It was\nurged that the allegations recorded in the impugned judgment\nand order are not true and the same have not been brought to\nthe notice of the Commission or the State during the course of\nsubmissions and have come on record only during the course\nof dictation of judgment.\n\nIt was submitted that after the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRajesh Daria\n\n(supra) there was a decision of this court in the case of Komal\nKatara (supra) which was contrary to the decision of Rajesh\n\nPage 20 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nDaria, but being a subsequent decision of this High Court, the\nrespondents were required to follow the same.\n\nIt was urged\nthat since the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) reiterated what was stated in\nRajesh\nDaria\n(supra) and was rendered subsequent to the decision of\nthis court in the case of Komal Katara (supra), the result was\nrevised by applying both the decisions viz.\n\nin the case of\nRamesh Ram as well as\nMamta Bisht\n(supra).\n\nIt was further\npointed out that the learned Single Judge has held that the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\nand Mamta Bisht\n(supra) are required to be applied to the\nrecruitment in question; and that there being no infirmity in\nthe application thereof, the select list may not be interfered\nwith. It was reiterated that it is only because the list was\nmaintained that the judgment and order passed by the learned\nSingle Judge was not challenged by the Commission.\n\n15.1 Mr. Shukla further drew the attention of the court to\nparagraph 32.7 of the impugned judgment and order, to\nsubmit that the learned Single Judge has recorded that the\nCommission and the State have not followed the decision in\nthe case of\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) even in the recruitment on\nthe post of Assistant Conservator of Forest and Range Forest\nOfficers in the year 2014 which was subject matter in Special\nCivil Application No.13857 of 2014 and Letters Patent Appeal\nNo.1103 of 2015. It was pointed out that insofar as the Letters\nPatent Appeal No.1103 of 2015 is concerned, the controversy\ninvolved therein was on a totally different footing viz.\n,\nin that\ncase\na reserved category candidate, who had availed of\nrelaxation, had claimed a general category post.\n\nPage 21 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n16. Mr. Utkarsh Sharma, learned Assistant Government\nPleader, drew the attention of the court to rule 9 of the Gujarat\nRules, to submit that having regard to the said rule which lays\ndown as to how preference has to be exercised, if a\nmeritorious reserved category candidate is not in a position to\nget the post of his higher preference as a general category\ncandidate, his migration to a reserved post would be automatic\ninasmuch as the candidate is bound by the order of preference\nindicated at the time of the interview test and is not permitted\nto change his order of preference even at the time of granting\nappointment. Therefore, what was done by the Commission\nwas in consonance with rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules.\n\n16.1 The learned Assistant Government Pleader further\ninvited the attention of the court to rule 18(1) of the Gujarat\nCivil Services Recruitment Examination Rules, 1980, to point\nout that the said rules specifically provided for preparation of a\nwaiting list which would remain in force till the result of the\nnext examination is declared by the Commission. Drawing a\ndistinction between the said rules and the Gujarat Rules of\n2000, it was pointed out that in the 2000 rules, this\nrequirement of preparing a wait list has been done away with,\nwhich clearly shows that no wait list was contemplated therein.\n\n17. Mr. S. N. Shelat, Senior Advocate, learned counsel with\nMr. Pathik Patel, learned advocate for the respondents No.5\nand 72, submitted that the respondents No.5, 6, 7 and 8 who\nare to be appointed against the vacant post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police in compliance with the impugned\njudgment and order are all above serial No.77 in the merit list.\nIt was pointed out that those respondents are not the original\n\nPage 22 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npetitioners, but are beneficiaries of the impugned judgment\nand order passed by the learned Single Judge, all of whom had\ngiven their first preference for the post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police and are placed higher than the\nappellants in order of merit.\n\n17.1 The attention of the court was invited to paragraph\n3 of the impugned judgment and order, wherein the learned\nSingle Judge has referred to the earlier order dated 12.5.2018\npassed in Special Civil Application No.6057 of 2011 at the time\nof issuance of notice wherein it has been clarified that any\naction taken by the respondents shall be subject to the final\ndecision of the petition. It was submitted that, therefore, in the\nappointment orders of the appellants itself, it was provided\nthat the same were subject to the final decision of the petition,\ndespite which, they did not seek to be joined as parties in the\npetition and even after the impugned judgment and order\ncame to be passed, they did not immediately approach this\ncourt challenging the same; therefore, the appellants from\ntheir very conduct are barred from challenging the impugned\norder inasmuch as such challenge is bad on the ground of\ndelay and laches as well as acquiescence.\nIn support of such\nsubmission, the learned counsel\nplaced reliance upon\nthe\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nState of U.P. v.\nArvind Kumar Srivastava\n, (2015) 1 SCC 347, wherein the\ncourt has held that those persons who did not challenge the\nwrongful action in their cases and acquiesced into the same\nand woke up after long delay would be treated as fence-sitters\nand laches and delays, and/or the acquiescence, would be a\nvalid ground to dismiss their claim.\n\nPage 23 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n17.2 It was submitted that the learned Single Judge has\nexercised discretion to the effect that the meritorious\n\ncandidates be considered while filling in the vacancies and that\nthe contention that those who have not come to the court\nshould not be granted relief cannot be countenanced. It was\nsubmitted that the appellants and all others were put to notice\nthat their appointments are subject to the result of the petition\nand, therefore, if the court were to accept the ratio as\nlaid\ndown by\nthe learned Single Judge, they cannot claim any\nequity. It was submitted that the learned Single Judge has\nultimately permitted to operate the merit list and that as on\ntoday, the appellants are not affected prejudicially, inasmuch\nas, the seniority list has not been prepared and, therefore, the\nquestion may be premature at this stage.\n\n17.3 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nState of J &K v. Sat Pal\n, (2013) 11 SCC\n737, on which the learned Single Judge has placed reliance,\nwherein one vacancy which was offered to one Trilok Nath only\ncame to be filled up. The court held that in such a situation,\nrespondent Sat Pal whose name figured in the merit/select list\nought to have been offered appointment against the said post.\nThe claim of respondent Sat Pal could not have been\nrepudiated, specially on account of his assertion, that his name\nin the merit/select list amongst Scheduled Castes candidates\nimmediately below the name of Trilok Nath was not even\ndisputed in the pleadings before the court. It was submitted\nthat in the facts of that case there is no decision of the State\nGovernment not to fill the notified vacancies.\nReference was\nmade to the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge in\nparagraph 38 of the impugned judgment wherein it has been\n\nPage 24 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrecorded that there is no decision of the State not to fill up the\nvacancies, to submit that, therefore, in the absence of any\nsuch decision having been taken by the respondents, the\nvacancies to the extent the same were advertised were\nrequired to be filled up.\n\n17.4 It was further submitted that the amended rule 17\nof the Gujarat Rules which says that there shall be no waiting\nlist and that the residual vacancies of posts if any due to non-\njoining of candidates shall be carried forward to the next\noccasion of recruitment, is not clarificatory or explanatory as\ncontended on behalf of the appellants and cannot be made\napplicable to the recruitment in question. Reliance was placed\nupon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nY.V.\nRangaiah v. J. Sreenivasa Rao\n, (1983) 3 SCC 284, for the\nproposition that vacancies in the promotional post occurring\nprior to the amendment have to be filled up in accordance with\nthe unamended rules. In the facts of the said case, the court\nset aside the panel prepared for filling vacancies under the\namended rule and directed a fresh panel to be prepared under\nthe old rules.\n\nReference was made to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nB.L. Gupta v. M.C.D.\n, (1998) 9\nSCC 223, wherein the court held that the vacancies that had\narisen prior to the amendment of the rules in 1995 can only be\nfilled in accordance with the 1978 rules and that any vacancy\nwhich arises after 1995 will have to be filled as per the\namended rules.\n\n17.5 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nN.T. Devin Katti v. Karnataka\nPublic Service Commission\n, (1990) 3 SCC 157, wherein the\n\nPage 25 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncourt held that generally a candidate has a right to be\nconsidered in accordance with the terms and conditions set out\nin the advertisement as his right crystallises on the date of\npublication of advertisement, however, he has no absolute\nright in the matter. If the recruitment rules are amended\nretrospectively during the pendency of selection, in that event\nselection must be held in accordance with the amended rules.\nWhether the rules have retrospective effect or not, primarily\ndepends upon the language of the rules and its construction to\nascertain the legislative intent. The legislative intent is\nascertained either by express provision or by necessary\nimplication; if the amended rules are not retrospective in\nnature the selection must be regulated in accordance with the\nrules and orders which were in force on the date of\nadvertisement. A candidate cannot be deprived of the right to\nbe considered for selection in accordance with the rules as\nthey existed on the date of advertisement on the amendment\nof rules during the pendency of selection unless the amended\nrules are retrospective in nature. Mr. Shelat submitted that\nwhen no decision is taken not to fill the vacancies, the\nmeritorious candidates who are waiting should be given an\nopportunity and that such candidates should not be ignored if\nmerit is the consideration. Therefore, the learned Single Judge\nwas wholly justified in directing that the vacancies on account\nof non-joining of candidates should be filled up in order of\nmerit.\n\n17.6 It was further submitted that the application of\nprinciples\nlaid down in\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the\ncase of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) has to be undertaken when an\nindividual is to be offered appointment.\n\nReference was made\n\nPage 26 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nto the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nTripurari\nSharan v. Ranjit Kumar Yadav\n, (2018) 2 SCC 656, wherein\nthe court held that\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) pertained to\nselection to posts in services through the UPSC examination.\n\n17.7 It was submitted that even if the two decisions of\nthe Supreme Court have to be applied to the facts of the\npresent case, the learned Single Judge was wholly justified in\nthrowing the seats open to the meritorious candidates. It was\nsubmitted that the question of preparing a waiting list does not\narise as there is only a merit list which has to be applied till the\nvacancies are available. It was submitted that the State\nGovernment has accepted the judgment and is inclined to\ncomply with it but for the present appeal.\n\n17.8 Insofar as the applicability of the decision of this\ncourt in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) is concerned, reference\nwas made to paragraph 12 of that decision wherein the court\nhas observed that the Government of its own is under an\nobligation to utilise the vacancies keeping in view the merit list\nand that in any case merit should not be made a casualty. It\nwas submitted that, therefore, the Government of its own is\nunder an obligation to utilise these vacancies keeping in view\nthe merit list. It was urged that when the Government has\naccepted the ratio of the decision of the learned Single Judge\nand offered appointments to the respondents, this court may\nnot deny them the benefit. It was urged that no question of\ninterpretation arises and that it is the obligation of the\nGovernment to operate the merit list and fill up the vacancies\nand that this court may not upset the benefit given to the\nrespondents.\n\nPage 27 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n18. Mr. Shalin Mehta, Senior Advocate, learned counsel\nappearing for the newly added respondent No.9 in Letters\nPatent Appeal No.814 of 2018 viz. Ruturaj Sankabhai Desai,\nwho is also a beneficiary of the impugned judgment, made\nreference to rule 17 of the Gujarat Rules as it stood prior to the\namendment in 2009, to point out that the same requires the\nCommission to recommend the qualified candidates for\nappointment to the extent of the number of vacancies to be\nfilled in. It was submitted that there is nothing on record to\nshow that vacancies are carried forward or that a decision has\nbeen taken not to fill up the vacancies; therefore, the merit list\nis required to be operated till the number of vacancies\nadvertised are filled in. It was submitted that the amended rule\n17 is a clear amendment and substitutes the old rule. Reading\nboth the rules conjointly it was pointed out that there are three\nthings in this rule which are not found in the old rule, namely,\n\n(i) the amended rule provides that there shall be no waiting\nlist; (ii) the residual vacancies of posts, if any, due to non-\njoining of candidate for any reason shall be carried forward;\nand (iii) that the Commission shall recommend the candidates\nqualified for appointment to the extent of the number of seats\nadvertised for, and not to the extent of vacancies. It was\nsubmitted that, therefore, the amended rule 17 cannot be said\nto be clarificatory and is clearly an amendment of the old rule.\n\n18.1 Reference was made to rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules,\nand more particularly, to sub-rule (2) thereof, which reads\nthus: \"The order of preference for the post indicated by the\ncandidate shall not confer any right for appointment to those\nposts. Having regard to the rank in the order of merit and the\n\nPage 28 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nnumber of posts available, the preference given by the\ncandidate shall be considered by the Government at the time\nof his appointment\". It was submitted that, therefore, before a\nmeritorious reserved category candidate is placed in a post of\nhis higher preference in a reserved category, at the time of his\nappointment he is required to be asked whether he wants to\nmigrate to the post of reserved category or not, whereas in the\nfacts of the present case, when the Commission prepared the\nlist, it chose for all the meritorious reserved category\ncandidates and that the stage of the meritorious reserved\ncategory candidates exercising option has been given a go-\nbye. It was submitted that the Commission has only to indicate\nthe order of preference of each candidate and it is the function\nof the Government at the time of allocation, whether to\nconsider a particular candidate in the general or reserved\ncategory. Therefore, the Commission could not have applied\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamesh\nRam\n(supra) at the stage of preparing the list.\n\n18.2 Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in\nthe case of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra), it was pointed out that rule\n16(2) of the CSE Rules provides that reserved category\ncandidates recommended against unreserved vacancies may\nbe adjusted against reserved vacancies by the Government if\nby this process they get a service of higher choice in order of\ntheir preference. Therefore sub-rule (2) of rule 16 of the CSE\nRules gives liberty to the meritorious reserved category\ncandidates to choose between the general quota and the\nreserved category quota, whereas insofar as the Gujarat Rules\nare concerned, there is no rule similar to rule 16(2) of the CSE\nRules. It was submitted that preference has to be considered\n\nPage 29 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nby the Government at the time of appointment and if the\nGovernment is to do this, it naturally follows that a meritorious\nreserved category candidate is required to be asked whether\nhe wants to migrate. It was submitted that migration cannot be\nconfused with preference.\n\nA meritorious reserved category\ncandidate has a choice to stay in the open merit and that the\nCommission by applying the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) at the stage of preparation of the list\ntook away the choice of a candidate whether or not to migrate\nand, therefore, the entire revised list is bad.\n\nIt was submitted\nthat who is to apply and at which stage the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is required to be\napplied is also important.\n\n18.3 As regards the applicability of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nMamta Bisht\n(supra), the\nlearned counsel\nplaced reliance upon\nthe findings recorded by\nthe learned Single Judge in paragraphs 31 to 33 of the\nimpugned judgment, to submit that on the findings recorded\nby the learned Single Judge, he was wholly justified in holding\nthat the State and the Commission have applied the same\nmore for convenience and advantage and less for upholding\nthe law.\n\n18.4 The attention of the court was invited to the\ndecision of a learned Single Judge of this court in the case of\n\nPravinchandra Hemchandbhai Panchal v. Gujarat Public\nService Commission\nrendered on 21.11.2005 in Special Civil\nApplication No.7912 of 2005, wherein the learned Single Judge\nhas held that until all the posts are filled up, the candidates\nwho have participated in the regular selection process are\n\nPage 30 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrequired to be considered for appointment as and when the\nState Government is to consider the matter of appointments\nunless there is a ban on recruitment by way of a policy\ndecision of the State Government due to any valid reason. It\nwas submitted that the decision of the learned Single Judge\nwas carried in appeal by way of Letters Patent Appeal No.84 of\n2006; however, the Division Bench had not disturbed the\njudgment. It was submitted that, therefore, it is now not open\nfor the respondents to contend that as there is no provision for\nwait list in rule 17 of the Gujarat Rules, the vacancies cannot\nbe filled up. It was submitted that thus rule 17 of the Gujarat\nRules has been interpreted by this court to mean that even if\nno wait list is contemplated, all vacancies should be filled by\nthe next meritorious candidates, and that in appeal also, the\ncourt can direct the Government to fill in all the posts as no\ndecision has been taken not to fill the vacancies.\nIt was\nsubmitted that furthermore in the light of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of Jai Narain Ram v. State of\nU.P., (1996) 1 SCC 332, all the vacancies should be filled up.\n\n18.5 Insofar as the contention that relief should be\ngranted only to those who have come before the court, the\nlearned counsel submitted that the Supreme Court has not laid\ndown any absolute proposition of law in this regard. It was,\naccordingly, urged that the appeals be dismissed and the\ndirections issued by the learned Single Judge be upheld.\n\n19. Mr. Anshin Desai, Senior Advocate, learned counsel with\nMr. Chetan Pandya and Mr. Pankaj Chaudhari for respondent\nNo.6 in Letters Patent Appeal No. 833 of 2018 submitted that\ndelay, laches and acquiescence is an issue of merit and that\n\nPage 31 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe appellants herein are not entitled to the grant of any relief\nby this court as they were fence-sitters. It was submitted that\nthe appellants herein had express or tacit knowledge that the\npetitions were pending, despite which, they did not deem it fit\nto be joined as parties nor did they seek to challenge the\nimpugned judgment immediately after the same was\ndelivered. It was contended that the appellants have no cause\nof action to file the present letters patent appeals and that the\nchallenge to the impugned judgment is premature as no event\ncan be said to have occurred which causes any prejudice to\nthe appellants. It was submitted that the appellants have come\non an apprehension and seek adjudication of an issue which\nhas not happened, which, according to the appellants is likely\nto happen. It was submitted that the State Government as well\nas the Commission have accepted the impugned judgment\nand, therefore, the appellants have no legal or fundamental\nright to question the veracity of the impugned judgment.\n\n19.1 It was contended that it is not permissible for this\ncourt to examine the merits of the impugned judgment and\norder, inasmuch as, locus of the petitioner is itself in question.\nIt was submitted that the inquiry into the irregularities and\nillegalities on the part of the respondents during the course of\nrecruitment process was not beyond the purview of the\nlearned Single Judge and that the learned Single Judge was\nwholly justified in relying upon the record while recording\nconclusions with regard to the validity of the recruitment\nprocess in question.\n\n19.2 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of Bhakra Beas Management Board v.\n\nPage 32 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nKrishan Kumar Vij, (2010) 8 SCC 701, wherein the appellant\ntherein had categorically raised the ground of delay of over\neight years in approaching the High Court for grant of the\nrelief, which the High Court had simply brushed aside and had\ncondoned such an inordinate, long and unexplained delay in a\ncasual manner. The Supreme Court held that the approach of\nthe High Court was neither proper nor legal.\n\n19.3 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nJagdish Lal v. State of\nHaryana\n, (1997) 6 SCC 538, wherein the court held that delay\ndisentitles the party to the discretionary relief under\narticle\nor\narticle 32\nof the Constitution. It was, accordingly urged\nthat the appellants have no locus to challenge the impugned\ndecision and that the appeals being barred by delay, laches\nand acquiescence, the court may not enter into the merits of\nthe impugned judgment and order and dismiss the appeals on\nthis ground alone.\n\n20. Mr. Dhaval Dave, Senior Advocate, learned counsel with\nMr. Niral Mehta learned advocate for the respondent No.31 in\nLetters Patent Appeal No.814 of 2018, namely the petitioner in\nSpecial Civil Application No.6057 of 2018 viz. Ketki Trivedi as\nwell as for a respondent in Letters Patent Appeal No.835 of\n2018 viz. Vadvia Dhirendrakumar, petitioner in Special Civil\nApplication No.6453 of 2011, submitted that the names of both\nthe candidates found place in the first select list published on\n13.5.2010. However, their names got excluded from the\nrevised select list which gave rise to cause of action to them to\nfile a petition on the ground that the revised list should not be\npermitted to operate as the respondents have no right to\n\nPage 33 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrevise the list. The learned Single Judge came to the conclusion\nthat the revised list was bad and should be set aside and,\ntherefore, the revised list was required to be set aside and the\noriginal list was required to be permitted to hold the field.\nHowever, the learned Single Judge found that instead of\nscrapping the revised list which has already been\nimplemented, equity can be done if forty seats which remained\nvacant on account of non-joining of candidates are filled in by\naccommodating such candidates, which is just, legal and\nproper in the facts and circumstances of this case.\n\n20.1 It was emphatically argued that the appellants have\nno locus to move these appeals. According to the learned\ncounsel, an appeal can only be filed by a person who can be\nsaid to be aggrieved by the judgment sought to be assailed\nand that merely because leave to appeal has been granted by\nthis court, such person does not become an aggrieved person,\nmore so, because while granting leave, this issue has been left\nopen. It was submitted that by the interim order issued at the\ntime of issuing notice, it was clarified that the appointments\nare subject to the final outcome of the petitions and that by\nthe impugned judgment; the appointments of the appellants\nhave not been disturbed. It was pointed out that the appellants\nfound place in both the lists and they are not affected in any\nmanner inasmuch as they still remain at the same stage of\nseniority. It was submitted that on account of operation of the\nrevised select list pursuant to the order of the learned Single\nJudge, no prejudice has been caused to any of the appellants\nand there is no infringement of any enforceable legal right of\nany of the appellants. It was contended that the appellants will\nhave locus to challenge the legality and validity of the\n\nPage 34 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nimpugned judgment provided there is some infringement of\nlegal right, however, mere inconvenience or prejudice would\nnot result into infringement of legal right. It was argued that if\nranking was to be disturbed there would be an infringement,\nwhereas the appellants are not able to show that a less\nmeritorious candidate has been placed above them nor are\nthey in a position to show that their seniority has been\ndisturbed. Therefore, today they have no cause of action for\npreferring the appeals, inasmuch as, from any angle, they\ncannot be said to be aggrieved.\n\n20.2 Next, it was contended that a candidate only has a\nright to promotion and there is no vested right. Moreover, no\nright of the appellants has been taken away. It was submitted\nthat implementation of a judgment and directions to\nimplement the principles of law\nlaid down in\na previous\njudgment cannot be said to infringe the legal right of the\nappellants.\nReference was made to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nJasbhai Motibhai Desai v.\nRoshan Kumar, Haji Bashir Ahmed\n, (1976) 1 SCC 671,\nwherein the court had held that where the appellant had not\nbeen denied or deprived of a legal right and had not sustained\nany injury to any legally protected interest, he has not been\nsubjected to a legal wrong and has not suffered any legal\ngrievance and, therefore, is not a \"person aggrieved\" and has\nno locus standi to challenge an order which does not deprive\nhim of his legal right.\n\n20.3 It was submitted that the learned Single Judge has\napplied the decision of this court in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\n\n(supra) while directing filling up of the vacancies left over on\n\nPage 35 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\naccount of candidates not joining. It was submitted that the\nlearned Single Judge has\nplaced reliance upon\nmaterial on\nrecord and has found that various illegalities have been\ncommitted by the State and Commission. According to the\nlearned counsel, it is immaterial as to how the material has\ncome on record, once it has come on record, the learned\nSingle Judge can rely upon it. It was submitted that the State\nand the Commission who are really affected parties, have not\nchosen to challenge the impugned judgment and hence, the\nappellants cannot be permitted to challenge the same and on\nthis threshold point itself, the appeals should not be\nentertained.\n\n21. Mr. K. B. Pujara, learned counsel for the petitioner in\nSpecial Civil Application No.11163 of 2012, who has also filed\nCross Objection No.82 of 2018 submitted that the name of the\npetitioner was included in both the lists. In the first list, he was\nat Serial No.176 and in the second list at 207. He belongs to\nthe SEBC category and had not opted for any Class-II post and\nthat his first preference was for the post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police. It was pointed out that in all sixty\neight vacancies of Deputy Superintendent of Police had been\nnotified, out of which, fourteen posts were reserved for SEBC\ncandidates. Out of these fourteen posts, four were reserved for\nfemale. Out of sixty eight candidates, four unreserved category\ncandidates did not join and one Rohit Wadhwana belonging to\nthe SEBC category did not accept the post, therefore, at that\nstage, the petitioner approached the authorities to fill the\nvacant post by appointing him whereas none of the candidates\nwho were higher in order on merit than him had approached\nthis court. It was contended that the legal position demands\n\nPage 36 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthat notified vacancies be filled up and that if a reserved\ncategory candidate does not join, the next candidate has to be\noffered appointment. It was submitted that if some candidate\ndoes not join, another candidate who stakes a claim can be\ngiven the post.\n\n21.1 Reference was made to the judgment and order\ndated 21.11.2005 passed by a learned Single Judge of this\ncourt in Special Civil Application No.7912 of 2005 wherein the\npetitioners sought preparation of list of unfilled posts which\nhad remained vacant on account of non-joining of selected\ncandidates or disqualified candidates or for any other valid\nreason. The learned Single Judge held that if the posts have\nremained vacant due to non-availability of candidates for any\nreason, the same are required to be filled up from amongst the\nnext available meritorious candidates and the list so prepared\ndeserves to be operated to that extent.\n\n21.2 Reference was made to the decision of a Division\nBench of this court in Letters Patent Appeal No.84 of 2006,\nwherein the above judgment and order passed by the learned\nSingle Judge was subject matter of challenge, whereby the\nappeal was disposed of with liberty to the appellants to seek\nreview of the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The\nattention of the court was invited to the judgment and order\ndated 31.7.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge on the\nreview petition filed by the State of Gujarat wherein the\nlearned Single Judge has held thus:\n\n\"3. Xxxxxx Even if the procedure for preparation of the\nwaiting list is given a go by, as per Rule 17 of the Rules\n\nPage 37 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nof 2000, as sought to be canvassed on behalf of the State\nGovernment, then also, the language of rule 17 provides\nfor recommendation \"the Commission shall recommend\nthe qualified candidates for appointment to the extent of\nthe number of vacancies to be filled in. The number of\nvacancies to be filled in as referred to in the rule shall\nhave reference to the number of vacancies so advertised\nand, therefore, if the direction is given for forwarding the\nname by the Commission to the Government to the\nextent of number of vacancies to be filled in as per the\nadvertisement, such cannot be a valid ground for\nrecalling and/or review of the order.\"\n\nThe learned Single Judge, accordingly, held that the directive is\nto consider a candidate for appointment on Class-I or Class-II\ncategory and such direction is to operate unless there is a ban\non recruitment by way of policy decision of the State\nGovernment due to valid reason. It was submitted that\nthe\nabove decision\nof the learned Single Judge has attained finality\nand therefore, the State authorities are bound to follow the\nsame.\n\n21.3 Reference was made to the order dated 16.8.2010\npassed in Miscellaneous Civil Application No.1768 of 2008 for\ncontempt on account of non-compliance of the order passed by\nthe learned Single Judge, wherein the Division Bench in the\ncontext of application of the decision of this court in\nD.G.\nDalal\n(supra) observed thus:-\n\n\"In our view, the same may not be required and the\nreason being that the appointments were offered to the\nrespective persons on the post of Class-I and II, as the\ncase may be at the relevant point of time in the year\n2004-2005 or during that period. It is only after the order\npassed by this Court and the litigation ended upto the\nreview, the right could be said to have been crystallised\nfor 27 posts from amongst the candidates who were in\n\nPage 38 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nwaiting list. The same was contingent upon non-joining of\nthe duty by the candidate who were offered appointment\nbut did not opt for joining the duty. Therefore, the\nposition of these 27 persons who are to be offered\nappointment or the position of 27 posts which are to be\nconsidered for the purpose of offering appointment\npursuant to the order passed in the present case would\nstand on altogether different footing, more particularly\nbecause they were in the waiting list and it is on account\nof the order passed by this Court, their consideration has\naccrued. Therefore, the State Government will have to\nconsider these 27 posts in one slot for the purpose of\noffering preferences in order of merit to the candidates\nconcerned who are eligible to enter the zone of\nconsideration against present 27 posts only. Therefore,\nsuch aspects should not operate as an obstacle in any\nmanner to the State Government in compliance of the\npresent order.\"\n\n21.4 It was submitted that considering the lapse of time,\nthe Division Bench did not think it fit to apply the decision in\nthe case of\nDG Dalal\n(supra) as five years had passed. The\nState accepted and implemented the order and that having\naccepted the earlier orders, it would not be permissible for\nthem to raise such contention in the petition.\n\n21.5 The learned counsel further drew the attention of\nthe court to a communication dated 10.7.2012 of one\nJagdishbhai Baldevbhai Desai, to point out that the said\ncandidate who was placed higher in order of merit than the\npetitioner had given up his right in favour of the petitioner.\nReliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nJai Narain Ram\n(supra), to submit that if a reserved category\nseat has to be filled up, the person who comes to the court\ngets the relief.\nIt was pointed out that the Supreme Court did\n\nPage 39 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nnot say that all the posts should be filled up but directed that\nonly one post should be filled up.\n\n21.6 Next, it was submitted that the advertisement in\nquestion was issued on 26.6.2006, whereas rule 17 of the\nGujarat Rules came to be amended subsequently in 2009. It\nwas contended that the selection process has to be completed\non the basis of the rules as they stood when the process\nstarted, and that therefore, the amendment in rule 17 would\noperate prospectively after 2009 and cannot be applied to the\nrecruitment in question. Reliance was placed upon the decision\nof the Supreme Court in the case of\nP. Mahendran v. State\nof Karnataka\n, AIR 1990 SC 405 <=> (1990) 1 SCC 411, for\nthe proposition that it is well settled rule of construction that\nevery statute or statutory rule is prospective unless it is\nexpressly or by necessary implication made to have\nretrospective effect. Unless there are words in the statute or in\nthe rules showing the intention to affect existing rights, the\nrule must be held to be prospective. If a rule is expressed in\nlanguage which is fairly capable of either interpretation it\nought to be construed as prospective only. In the absence of\nany express provision or necessary intendment the rule cannot\nbe given retrospective effect except in matter of procedure.\nMr. Pujara submitted that since the amended rule was not\nretrospective, it could not adversely affect the right of those\ncandidates who were qualified for selection and appointment\non the date when they applied for the post.\n\n21.7 It was emphatically argued that Desai Ruturaj\nSolanki who had accepted the post given to him at the relevant\n\nPage 40 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ntime, is sought to be brought in out of the blue for giving\nappointment on the vacant post of SEBC male. It was\nsubmitted that the action of the State in offering the post of\nDeputy Superintendent of Police to Desai Ruturaj Sankabhai in\nthe category of SEBC Male is bad in law as the said candidate\nhad not approached this court at the relevant time seeking\nrelief to the effect that the vacant post be filled up and was\ntherefore, not entitled to the grant of any such benefit. It was\nsubmitted that the petitioner is, therefore, aggrieved by the\ndirections issued by the learned Single Judge.\n\n21.8 Reference was made to the sur-rejoinder filed on\nbehalf of the State Government and more particularly to the\ntable below paragraph 8 thereof, to submit that the name of\nDesai Ruturaj Sankabhai does not find place therein. Reference\nwas made to the revised merit list, to point out that at item\nNo.130 Desai Ruturaj Sankabhai is treated as SEBC GM 94.\nHowever, in the list shown in the sur-rejoinder the name of\nDesai Ruturaj Sankabhai does not appear, despite which, he\nhas been offered appointment against the vacant SEBC post of\nDeputy Superintendent of Police. It was emphatically argued\nthat none of the persons above the petitioner had come\nstaking their claims at the relevant time and hence, they\ncannot be granted any relief.\n\n21.9 Referring to the issues framed by the learned Single\nJudge, it was submitted that five issues have been framed but\nthere is no issue qua the present petitioner and that except\nIssue No.5, the petitioner's case has not been considered. It\nwas submitted that there is no adjudication of his petition and\nnothing has been dealt with and in fact his petition has not\n\nPage 41 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbeen decided at all and none of the contentions raised by him\nhave been dealt with.\n\n21.10 It was argued that the decision of this court in the\ncase of\nD.G.Dalal\n(supra) has no applicability to the facts of\nthe present case, inasmuch as, D.G. Dalal was rendered in the\ncontext of the 1989 rules and as soon as the grievance arose\nthey had come to the court, which had considered their\ngrievance and granted relief to the petitioners and not to\nothers.\n\nIt was submitted that following the decision of this\ncourt in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) does not give any relief to the\npetitioner and on the contrary gives relief to others who had\nnot approached this court raising any grievance. It was\nsubmitted that the petitioner has come before this court as an\nSEBC candidate and there is a clear vacancy of SEBC Male.\nNone of the candidates having higher merit than him have\ncome to the court for all these seven years. Thus, no one has\ncome within reasonable time.\n\nThe learned Single Judge has not\nconsidered the relief prayed for by the petitioner and on the\ncontrary has said that the decision of this High Court in\nD.G.\nDalal\n(supra) should be implemented which does not give\nrelief to the petitioner but to strangers who were not before\nthe court.\n\nTherefore, the natural consequences had to be to\ndirect appointment of the petitioner as was done in\nAshok v.\nState of Karnataka\n, AIR 1992 SC 80. In that case, the\nSupreme Court had recorded that the appointments under the\nimpugned rules were made as back as in 1987 and only the\nappellants therein had approached the Tribunal for relief, the\ncase of other candidates cannot be considered as they never\napproached for redress within reasonable time. The court was\nthus inclined to grant relief only to the appellants before it who\n\nPage 42 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nwere vigilant in making grievance and approaching the\nTribunal in time. It was submitted that the petition ought to\nhave been allowed by the learned Single Judge and that the\njudgment is required to be modified to that extent by granting\nrelief to the petitioner.\n\n21.11 Referring to paragraph 35.1 of the impugned\njudgment, it was pointed out that the whole idea was to give\nrelief to the persons who were before the court and in that\nbackdrop the ultimate decision has been rendered by the\nlearned Single Judge namely to grant relief to the affected\ncandidates against the unfilled vacancies. It was submitted\nthat while it has been held that the list is bad and relief be\ngranted to those who have come to the court, while issuing the\nultimate directions, the learned Single Judge has erred in\ndirecting to make appointments in order of merit and by\napplying the decision of this court in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra). .\n\n21.12 It was urged that in the entire litigation, there is not\none petitioner who has come with the grievance like him; none\nof the parties before the learned Single Judge had requested to\napply the decision of this court in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\n\n(supra); there was no one who stated that they were the next\nmeritorious candidates and requested to be appointed; and\nthat the petitioner was the only person whose claim should\nhave been considered independently. Thus, the petitioner has\nsuffered injustice because of non-consideration of his petition\nand the nature of directions issued and the manner in which\nthey are implemented. It was, accordingly, urged that the\ncross-objection deserves to be allowed by allowing the petition\nand granting the relief as prayed for vide paragraph 14(b) of\n\nPage 43 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe petition.\n\n21.13 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nState of Orissa v. Mamata Mohanty\n,\n(2011) 3 SCC 436, for the proposition that relief not claimed\ncannot be granted. It was submitted that the beneficiaries of\nthe impugned judgment and order who were not the\npetitioners before the learned Single Judge are defending the\nimpugned judgment. It was submitted that the relief granted\nby the learned Single Judge is misdirected and merely because\nof wrong directions there are beneficiaries who are trying to\ndefend such judgment.\n\n21.14 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nU.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh\n, (2006)\n11 SCC 464, wherein the court was considering the question as\nto whether when a person who is not vigilant of his rights and\nacquiesces with the situation, his petition can be heard after a\ncouple of years on the ground that same relief should be\ngranted to him as was granted to a person similarly situated\nwho was vigilant of his rights and challenged his retirement\nwhich was said to be made on attaining the age of 58 years.\nThe court held that the respondents were guilty since they had\nacquiesced in accepting the retirement and had not challenged\nthe same in time and that if they would have been vigilant\nenough, they could have filed writ petitions as others did in the\nmatter. Therefore, whenever it appears that the claimants\nhave lost time or whiled it away and did not rise to the\noccasion in time for filing the writ petitions, then in such cases,\nthe court should be very slow in granting the relief to the\nincumbent. Secondly, it has also to be taken into consideration\n\nPage 44 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthat question of acquiescence or waiver on the part of the\nincumbent whether other parties are going to be prejudiced if\nthe relief is granted.\n\n21.15 It was submitted that the beneficiaries of the\nimpugned judgment have not approached this court seeking a\ndirection to fill up the vacancies which remained unfilled,\ntherefore, no relief could have been granted to them. It was\nargued that the beneficiaries cannot be heard in support of the\ndirections as they were not litigants before the learned Single\nJudge.\n\n21.16 As regards the contention raised on behalf of the\nappellants and other respondents that the cross-objection is\nnot maintainable, the learned counsel submitted that rule 84 of\nthe Gujarat High Court Rules provides that the provisions of\n\nOrder XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure\nand rules regarding\nappeals shall apply to letters patent appeals. It was submitted\nthat the decision of the Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High\nCourt would have no applicability to the facts of the present\ncase as the same was rendered in the context of the rules as\napplicable to that High Court which are not akin to rule 84 of\nthe Gujarat High Court Rules and hence, the contention that\nthe cross objection is not maintainable deserves to be rejected.\n\n22. Mr. G. M. Joshi, learned counsel with Mr. Asav Gadhvi,\nlearned advocate for some of the parties, adopted the\ncontentions advanced by Mr. S.N. Shelat. It was submitted that\nin Special Civil Application No.8203 of 2012, the petitioner\nsought for a writ of quo warranto, wherein, the whole file was\nvoluntarily placed before the court by the Government. The\n\nPage 45 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nState was relying upon the official record for the whole\nrecruitment process and hence, once the record is before it,\nthe court would not be precluded from looking at the record as\na whole when the challenge is composite and the court was\noffered the record for perusal.\n\n22.1 It was submitted that incorrect application of the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\nand Mamta Bisht\n(supra) were not the only irregularities and\nthat the present case is a glaring example of the Commission\nbeing dictated by the State Government in its General\nAdministrative Department. It was submitted that there were\nglaring illegalities in the preparation of the second list and the\nwhole exercise undertaken by the Commission is ultra vires\nand void. It was urged that the whole process could have been\nset aside by the court but the final list has not been set aside\nand with a view to salvage the situation, directions have been\nissued to fill up the vacant posts. It was contended that if at all,\nit is the State and the Commission which could have\nchallenged the impugned judgment on the ground that there\nare glaring observations against them; however, the State and\nthe Commission have accepted the judgment and started\nacting upon it. Therefore, the appellants of the present appeals\nwould be neither justified nor competent to challenge the\njudgment and that the history shows that the appeal was not\npreferred in time and it was stated that when the judgment\ncame the appellants did not think it proper to challenge it and\nit was only after the judgment was being implemented that\nthey came to the court.\n\n22.2 Referring to paragraph 7 of the memorandum of\n\nPage 46 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nappeal wherein it has been averred that \"Contrary to the\nexpectations that the State and/or GPSC would challenge the\njudgment by filing an appropriate LPA, the appellants were\nshocked to learn in around third week of December 2017 that\nthe Government had reallocated five candidates at Merit\nNo.49, 54, 57, 58 and 130 who were earlier allotted to the post\nof Mamlatdar, Section Officer, Sachivalaya Mamlatdar,\nMamlatdar and Taluka Development respectively as Dy. S.P.s\nwith all ancillary benefits, like seniority, pay fixation, deemed\ndate, etc.\" it was submitted that the conduct of the appellants\nis evident from the averments made in the memorandum of\nappeal. It was submitted that the position of the appellants\ndoes not change on account of the order giving appointments\nto the five candidates. Moreover, the five affected respondents\nare meritorious in their respective categories and are placed\nhigher up in the select list and none of them have been taken\nout in the revised list. It was submitted that, therefore, the\nchallenge made by the appellants who are lower in merit than\nthe persons who are sought to be appointed upon\nimplementation of the impugned judgment must necessarily\nfail.\n\n22.3 Next, it was submitted that the amended rule 17 of\nthe Gujarat Rules is a declaratory provision and has to be read\nprospectively. A person has a substantive right to be appointed\nand such right cannot be taken away. It was submitted that the\nright to be appointed if there are vacancies cannot be taken\naway by the amended rule and that subordinate legislation\nwould only apply prospectively. It was submitted that the\nrecord shows that there are illegalities other than the\napplication of the decisions of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh\n\nPage 47 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nRam and Mamta Bisht\n(supra), in support of which, the\nlearned advocate\nplaced reliance upon\nthe observations made\nby the learned Single Judge in paragraph 43.1 onwards.\n\n23. In rejoinder to the submissions made by Mr. Pujara for the\npetitioner in Special Civil Application No.11163 of 2012, Mr.\nShalin Mehta submitted that the petition has been answered\nand that the learned Single Judge has turned down prayer by\ndirecting the post to be filled up by the next meritorious\ncandidate. Therefore his petition is deemed to have been\nrejected and, therefore, the petitioner was required to file an\nappeal and the cross objection at his instance is not\nmaintainable.\n\n23.1 Referring to rule 22 of\nOrder XLI of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\n, 1908, the learned counsel submitted that the\nexplanation thereto provides that a respondent aggrieved by a\nfinding of the court in the judgment on which the decree\nappealed against is based may, under that rule, file cross\nobjection in respect of the decree insofar as it is based on that\nfinding, notwithstanding that by reason of the decision of the\ncourt on any other finding which is sufficient for the decision of\nthe suit, the decree, is, wholly or in part, in favour of the\nrespondent. It was submitted that it is only if the decree is in\nfavour of the respondent that he can file cross objections\nagainst any finding against him, whereas in the facts of the\npresent case, the petition of the petitioner is deemed to have\nbeen rejected, and hence, the cross objection is not\nmaintainable at all.\n\n23.2 Next, it was submitted that the vacant post can be\n\nPage 48 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nfilled by the candidates who are still in the list whereas the\nname of this petitioner has been deleted from the list as he\nhad not joined the post which he had been offered. Therefore,\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Jai Narain\n(supra) would not come to the aid of the petitioner. It was\nsubmitted that even otherwise even on merits, the petitioner is\nnot entitled to be appointed against the post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police SEBC Male, inasmuch as, candidates\nwho are more meritorious than the petitioner are available.\n\n23.3 Insofar as the contention that the respondents\nhaving not approached this court seeking any relief, no relief\ncan be granted in their favour is concerned, the learned\ncounsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme\ncourt in the case of\nState of U.P. v. Arvind Kumar\nSrivastava\n, (2015) 1 SCC 347, wherein the court has held that\nthe person who did not challenge the wrongful action in their\ncases and acquiesced into the same and woke up after long\ndelay only because of the reason that their counterparts who\nhad approached the court earlier in time succeeded in their\nefforts, then such employees cannot claim that the benefit of\nthe judgment rendered in the case of similarly situated persons\nbe extended to them. It was submitted that however, the court\nhas carved out an exception that this may not apply to those\ncases where the judgment pronounced by the court was\njudgment in rem with intention to give benefit to all similarly\nsituated persons, whether they approached the court or not. It\nwas submitted that normal rule is that a party has to come to\nthe court, but it cannot be said that there is no exception. In a\ncase where the court gives the judgment in rem, all are\nentitled to relief. It was submitted that the directions to fill up\n\nPage 49 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe vacancies in order of merit are valid and in consonance\nwith the law\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court and that the\ndirections are not perverse and are in conformity with law,\nand, therefore, the cross objections and the appeal both be\nturned down.\n\n23.4 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nManoj Manu v. Union of India\n, (2013)\n12 SCC 171, for the proposition that it is manifest that a person\nwhose name is included in the select list does not acquire any\nright to be appointed. The Government may decide not to fill\nup all the vacancies for valid reasons. Such a decision on the\npart of the Government not to fill up the required/advertised\nvacancies should not be arbitrary or unreasonable but must be\nbased on sound, rational and conscious application of mind.\nOnce it is found that the decision of the Government is based\non some valid reason, the court would not issue any\nmandamus to the Government to fill up the vacancies. It was\nsubmitted that in the facts of the present case, the\nGovernment has not taken any decision not to fill up the\nadvertised vacancies, and hence, the learned Single Judge was\nwholly justified in directing that the vacancies be filled up in\norder of merit.\n\n25. Mr. Hemang Parikh, learned advocate for the respondents\nNo.11 to 14 in Letters Patent Appeal No.814 of 2018 reiterated\nthe contentions raised by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents. It was submitted that the learned Single Judge\nwhile issuing directions in paragraph 41.1 of the decision has\nalso considered the larger interest and directed that the\nmeritorious candidates should be given appointments. It was\n\nPage 50 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nsubmitted that such directions being just and proper, the\nvacant posts should be permitted to be filled up by meritorious\ncandidates. It was submitted that considering the dispute\nbetween the two candidates, the learned Single Judge has\nrightly directed that the next meritorious candidates should be\nappointed.\n\n26. Mr. Nachiket Mehta, learned advocate for respondents\nNo.15 to 22 in Letters Patent Appeal No.814 of 2018 has\nadopted the submissions advanced by Mr. M. J. Thakore.\n\n27. Mr. Nisarg Shah and Mr. Mohsin Koreja, learned\nadvocates for respondents No.16 and 19 respectively in Letters\nPatent Appeal No.815 of 2018 have adopted the submissions\nadvanced by Mr. G.M. Joshi.\n\n28. Mr. A. D. Bhatt, learned advocate for respondent No.31 in\nLetters Patent Appeal No.828 of 2018 has adopted the\nsubmissions advanced by Mr. Shalin Mehta and Mr. G.M. Joshi.\n\n29. Mr. Sanat Pandya, learned advocate has adopted the\nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellants.\n\n30. In rejoinder, Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned counsel for the\nappellants submitted that insofar as the locus of the appellants\nto challenge the impugned judgment is concerned, by the\norder dated 18.12.2017 passed by the Government, five\ncandidates have been placed at Merit No.38, 43, 53, 60 and\n\n62. The resultant effect as per the directions issued by the\nlearned Single Judge is to give each of them seniority, as a\nconsequence whereof, these five candidates would be placed\n\nPage 51 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nhigher above the appellants in the seniority list. It was\nsubmitted that the seniority list has been operated for the\npurpose of promotion to the post of Superintendent of Police\nup to Serial No.24 and by placing the five candidates above\nthem, the chances of promotion of the appellants would be\nadversely affected. It was submitted that seniority is a material\nfactor in granting promotion which cannot be ignored and,\ntherefore, the appellants have locus to challenge the\njudgment. It was submitted that there is no delay on the part\nof the appellants as the moment the orders came to be made,\nthey preferred appeals. It was submitted that in the original\npetition they did not seek to be impleaded as parties as the\npetitioners therein were below them in the merit list and the\nrelief prayed for did not affect the appellants. It is the\ndirections issued by the learned Single Judge which affect the\nappellants and with which they are aggrieved. It was submitted\nthat the appeals are not premature as appointment orders\nplacing five candidates above them have already been issued.\n\n30.1 Next, it was submitted that at the time when the\ndecision of this court in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) came to be\nrendered, the 1980 rules were in force. Rule 18 thereof\ncontained a provision for wait list. Since implementation of the\ndecision of this court in D.G. Dalal entailed a lot of reshuffling,\nthe 2000 rules were brought in to prevent such reshuffling and\nthe concept of wait list was done away with. It was submitted\nthat rule 17 read with rule 19 of the 2000 rules does not\ncontemplate a wait list or filling up vacancies arising out of\nnon-joining of the candidates. Consequently, when forty one\ncandidates have not joined and there is no wait list, by\nnecessary implication, such posts have to be kept vacant.\n\nPage 52 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n30.2 Dealing with the contention of the respondents that\n\nthe amended rule 17 cannot be applied to the recruitment in\nquestion, it was submitted that the rule is clarificatory in\nnature and does not change the rules of the game.\nInsofar as\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in\nB.L. Gupta and\nanother v. M.C.D.\n, (1998) 9 SCC 223, as well as\nN.T. Devin\nKatti v. Karnataka Public Service Commission\n, (1990) 3\nSCC 157, on which reliance was placed by the learned counsel\nfor the respondents, it was submitted that in the facts of the\nsaid cases, the source from which the appointment was to be\nmade was itself changing and if the source of promotion\nundergoes a change, the principle will have applicability.\n\n30.3 It was submitted that the alleged amendment does\nnot deprive any candidate of any vested right. The amendment\nonly provides that if there is a vacancy on account of no one\ntaking a post, there shall be vacant post and that post would\nlapse and would be considered in the next recruitment. It was\nsubmitted that the provision does not modify the rules,\ninasmuch as the earlier rules also did not contemplate a wait\nlist. It was submitted that the amending rule, therefore, will\nhave to be read retrospectively with effect from the year 2000.\nIt was submitted that there is no challenge to the rules and\nthat those who have come to this court are those candidates\nwho were thrown out of the first list on application of the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\nand Mamta Bisht\n(supra).\n\n30.4 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme\ncourt in Bihar State Electricity Board v. Suresh Prasad\n\nPage 53 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nand others, (2004) 2 SCC 681, wherein the question before\nthe Supreme Court was whether the High Court was justified in\nlaw in giving direction to the appellant to fill up the vacancies\nwhich remained unfilled due to candidates not turning up to\njoin the post? The Supreme Court observed that the appellant\ntherein had taken steps for filling 25 vacancies in the post of\nOperators pursuant to Advertisement No.3/86 and remaining\n25 vacancies from Advertisement No.6/92. The results were\nnotified on the notice-board. The Board recommended names\nof successful candidates under both the advertisements. Out of\n22 candidates selected by the Board for appointment under\nAdvertisement No.3/86, 18 candidates did not turn up. The\ncourt noted that the respondents No.1 to 7 therein had applied\nfor appointment under Advertisement No.3/86 dated\n15.12.1986 and that they had qualified but were placed at\nSerial No.23 onwards in the descending order. The court\nobserved that a panel of 22 candidates was prepared for\nappointment under Advertisement No.3/86 and the\nrespondents No.1 to 7 fell beyond the cut off number. It was\nobserved that no statutory recruitment rules were shown\nwhich required the appellant Board to prepare a waiting list in\naddition to the panel. On behalf of the respondents No.1 to 7,\nit was contended that when 18 candidates failed to turn up,\nthe appellant was bound to offer posts to candidates in the\nwaiting list.\nThe court held that no such rule has been shown in\nthis regard and, accordingly, held that its decision in the case\nof\nShankarsan Dash v. Union of India\n, (1991) 3 SCC 47,\nsquarely applies to the facts of that case.\n\nThe court further\nreferred to its decision in the case of\nJai Narain Ram v. State of\nU.P.\n, (1996) 1 SCC 332, and drew a distinction that in the facts\nof the said case the matter was concerning filling of a reserved\n\nPage 54 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npost. Further, a concession was made in the counter-affidavit\nfiled on behalf of the respondent State that since the post was\na reserved post; they can only be filled up by the candidates of\nreserved categories. It was submitted that in the light of\nthe\nabove decision\n, when the rules do not provide for preparing a\nwaiting list in addition to the list of recommended candidates,\nif the selected candidates fail to turn up, the State Government\nis not bound to offer those posts to other candidates.\n\n30.5 Insofar as the decision of the learned Single Judge in\nSpecial Civil Application No.7912 of 2005 is concerned, it was\nsubmitted that such decision was based on a concession made\nby the Assistant Government Pleader and that it is in view of\nthis judgment of the learned Single Judge that the Government\nthought it fit to clarify rule 17 of the Gujarat Rules of 2000, and\nit is in that light that the rule 17 as amended by the 2009 rules\nhas to be seen.\n\n30.6 The learned counsel further\nplaced reliance upon\n\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in\nCIT v. Vatika Township\n(P) Ltd.\n, (2015) 1 SCC 1, for the proposition that legislations\nwhich modify accrued rights or which impose obligations or\nimpose new duties or attach a new disability have to be\ntreated as prospective unless the legislative intent is clearly to\ngive the enactment a retrospective effect, unless the\nlegislation is for purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a\nformer legislation or to explain a former legislation. It was\nsubmitted that in this case the list has been prepared in 2011\nwhile the amended rule 17 which came into force in 2009 has\nnot affected anyone who appeared in the exam and explains\nthe earlier rule. Referring to the decisions relied upon on\n\nPage 55 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbehalf of the respondents on the question of retrospective\noperation of a statute, it was submitted that all these\njudgments relate to pre-requisite qualifications wherein the\namended provision had the effect of disqualifying candidates,\nwho under the unamended provision were qualified, thereby\ntaking away their substantive right to participate in the\nrecruitment, whereas in the facts of the present case, the\namended rule 17 of the Gujarat Rules, does not disturb the\neligibility criteria of the candidates, and therefore, those\ndecisions would not be applicable to the facts of the present\ncase.\n\nIt was submitted that the Supreme Court in\nN.T. Devin\nKatti v. Karnataka Public Service Commission\n(supra),\nhas held that a candidate on making application for a post\npursuant to an advertisement does not acquire any vested\nright of selection, but if he is eligible and is otherwise qualified\nin accordance with the relevant rules and the terms contained\nin the advertisement, he does acquire a vested right of being\nconsidered for selection in accordance with the rules as they\nexisted on the date of advertisement. He cannot be deprived\nof that limited right on the amendment of the rules during the\npendency of selection unless the amended rules are\nretrospective in nature. It was submitted that thus that\ndecision was rendered in the context of facts where\nsubsequently the source was changed by making the\napplicants ineligible, whereas the amended rule 17 does not\nchange the source and therefore, has to be applied while\nmaking the select list in 2011. It was also contended that there\nis no difference between the expressions \"seats advertised\"\n\nand \"vacancies advertised\". It was submitted that there was\nno wait list even as per the earlier rules. Since there was no\nwait list, the question of filling up the vacancies on account of\n\nPage 56 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nnon-joining of meritorious candidates does not arise as the list\nhas already been exhausted.\n\n30.7 It was further submitted that insofar as the\npetitioner in Special Civil Application No.11163 of 2012 is\nconcerned, he did not accept the post that was offered to him\nand consequently, in view of sub-rule (4) of rule 9 of the\nGujarat Rules, his name stood deleted from the list of\ncandidates recommended by the Commission for appointment\nand, therefore, the question of offering him any post does not\narise.\n\n30.8 Insofar as the application of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is\nconcerned, it was submitted that it will make no difference\nwhether the list is finalised by the Commission or the State\nGovernment by applying Ramesh Ram, because there is no\nconcept of migration under the rules. Even if the Commission\nmakes the list it will have to shift a meritorious reserved\ncategory candidate from the general category to the reserved\ncategory if he cannot get a seat of his higher preference in the\ngeneral category.\n\nReference was made to paragraph 32 of the\nreported decision in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra), to point out that\nthe Supreme Court has held that to prevent an anomaly\nwhereby a reserved category candidate who has qualified as a\npart of the general list should not be disadvantaged by being\nassigned to a lower service against the vacancies in the\ngeneral category especially because if he availed the benefit of\nhis reserved category status, he would have got a service of a\nhigher preference. With the obvious intention of preventing\nsuch an anomaly, rule 16(2) provides that an MRC candidate is\n\nPage 57 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nat liberty to choose between the general quota or the\nrespective reserved category quota. It was submitted that\ninsofar as the Gujarat Rules are concerned, no one is at a\ndisadvantage as all the candidates are allocated posts in terms\nof the order of preference given by them, and an MRC\ncandidate is automatically shifted to the reserved category if\nhe is not able to get the post of his higher preference in the\ngeneral category. It was submitted that in the facts of the\ncase of Ramesh Ram there is no wait list, but only a reserve\nlist. Moreover, the ratio of Ramesh Ram is that there cannot be\nreservation of more than 50%. It was submitted that\nthe said\ndecision\ndoes not lay down any principle of migration. It was\ncontended that there is no scope of migration available under\nthe Gujarat Rules and that the revised list has therefore, been\ncorrectly prepared.\n\n30.9 Lastly, it was submitted that if the two judgments in\nthe case of\nRamesh Ram and Mamta Bisht\n(supra) are\nproperly applied, there is no challenge to the preparation of\nthe merit list on the basis of the Gujarat Rules of 2000, and,\ntherefore, if the court finds that the above decisions have been\nproperly applied while preparing the revised list, all the\npetitions would fail as no other relief has been claimed.\n\n30.10 Insofar as the maintainability of the cross objection\nfiled by the petitioner of Special Civil Application No.11163 of\n2012 is concerned, it was submitted that the same would not\nfall under Order XLI rule 22\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n\ninasmuch as on a reading of sub-rule (1) of rule 22 together\nwith the Explanation thereto it is clear that the same\ncontemplates filing of cross objection against a finding\n\nPage 58 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrecorded in a judgment wherein the decision is wholly or partly\nin favour of such person; whereas in the present case the\nlearned Single Judge has not granted any relief in favour of the\npetitioner and hence, in the absence of any decision in favour\nof the petitioner, the cross objection is not maintainable.\n\n31. In the light of the rival contentions advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the respective parties, the first question\nthat arises for consideration is whether the appellants have the\nlocus to prefer the present appeals?\n\n31.1 For this purpose, it would be necessary to examine\nas to whether the appellants can be said to be aggrieved by\nthe impugned judgment and order. While the impugned\njudgment does not set aside the revised merit list which was\nsubject matter of challenge in the writ petitions, the learned\nSingle Judge has directed that the vacancies that remained\nunfilled on account of non-joining of candidates be filled up\nand has further directed that the decision of this court in\nD.G.\nDalal\n(supra) be followed. To comply with the said directions,\nthe respondents have resorted to reshuffling of posts by\npushing up candidates who initially were appointed on posts of\ntheir lower preference in order of merit, to posts of their higher\npreference. Accordingly, five posts of Deputy Superintendent\nof Police which remained vacant as the candidates who were\nappointed against such posts did not join are now sought to be\nfilled up. The persons who are now sought to be appointed to\nthese posts rank higher than the appellants in the merit list\nand are, therefore, sought to be placed above the appellants\nand consequently, the seniority and chances of promotion of\n\nPage 59 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe appellants is likely to be adversely affected. Significantly,\nnone of these persons who are sought to be placed above the\nappellants had approached this court seeking any relief for\nfilling up the vacant posts.\n\nThese five persons are merely\nbeneficiaries of the directions issued by the learned Single\nJudge to apply the decision of this court in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra)\nwhile filling up the vacancies, which has resulted in reshuffling\nof seats to ensure that less meritorious candidates are not\nplaced above more meritorious candidates. It may also be\npertinent to note that these appeals are mainly defended by\nthe beneficiaries of the impugned judgment and order who had\nneither challenged the revised merit list nor the action of the\nState Government of not filling up the vacancies.\n\n31.2 It is true that despite the fact that in their\nappointment orders, it was specifically mentioned that the\nsame were subject to the final outcome of the petitions; the\nappellants did not seek to be joined as parties therein. It,\nhowever, appears that the appellants did not join in those\nproceedings presumably because their names found place in\nboth the merit lists and those who had come to the court were\nless meritorious candidates who were not likely to adversely\naffect them in any manner. It is in the light of the wide\ndirections issued by the learned Single Judge to fill up all the\nvacancies by offering them to the next meritorious candidates\nand further to keep in view the ratio\nlaid down by\nthis court in\nthe case of\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) while giving such appointments\nas a consequence whereof the candidates who were not before\nthe court are sought to be placed above the appellants, that\nthe seniority and chances of promotion of the appellants are\nadversely affected. The appellants are, therefore, directly\n\nPage 60 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\naffected by the implementation of the impugned judgment. A\nperson is said to be aggrieved by an order if that order directly\naffects or prejudices his interest. Since the appellants are\ndirectly affected and prejudiced by the impugned judgment,\nconsequently they are aggrieved parties and hence, it is open\nfor them to challenge the impugned judgment and order. The\ncontention that the appellants have no locus to challenge the\nimpugned judgment, therefore, does not merit acceptance.\n\n31.3 Insofar as the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nJasbhai Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar\n(supra) on which\nreliance has been placed on behalf of the respondents is\nconcerned, the same was rendered in the facts of a case where\na rival cinema house was being set up which would adversely\naffect the monopolistic commercial interest of the appellant\ntherein, causing pecuniary harm and loss of business from\ncompetition. The court held that such harm or loss is not\nwrongful in the eye of law, because it does not result in injury\nto a legal right or a legally protected interest. The above\ndecision would have no applicability to the facts of the present\ncase, inasmuch as in service jurisprudence, anything that\nadversely affects or prejudices a person's seniority or\nprospects of promotion results in such person suffering from a\nlegal grievance.\n\n31.4 As regards the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nShiba Shankar Mohapatra v. State of Orissa\n(supra)\nwherein it has been held that fence-sitters cannot be allowed\nto raise the dispute or challenge the validity of the order after\nits conclusion\n;\nthe said decision\nwould also not have any\napplicability to the facts of the present case inasmuch as the\n\nPage 61 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npetitioners in the writ petitions stood lower in merit than the\nappellants and the reliefs prayed for did not affect the\nappellants. It is on account of the directions issued by the\nlearned Single Judge, which are beyond the scope of the reliefs\nprayed for in the petitions that the appellants have been\naffected and are, therefore, aggrieved. Besides in\nthe above\ndecision\nthe court has held that the court exercising public law\njurisdiction does not encourage agitation of stale claims where\nthe right of third parties crystallises in the interregnum;\nwhereas in the facts of the present case third party rights are\nbeing created on account of implementation of the directions\nissued by the learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment.\nThe court has further held that the settled legal proposition\nthat emerges is that once the seniority has been fixed and it\nremains in existence for a reasonable period, any challenge to\nthe same should not be entertained. In the present case, the\nseniority of the appellants has been fixed and has remained in\nexistence for a reasonable period, and it is on account of the\ndirections issued in the impugned judgment that their seniority\nis sought to be disturbed,\n\n32. This court during the course of arguments had also\nconsidered as to whether the impugned judgment could be\nsustained without adversely affecting the appellants; however,\nit is found that so long as the directions remain the same\nwould have a direct impact on the seniority and chances of\npromotion of the appellants and hence, it is necessary to\nexamine the impugned order on merits. The contention that\nthe appellants do not have the locus standi to challenge the\nimpugned judgment is, therefore, rejected.\n\nPage 62 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n33. Before adverting to the merits of the appeals, certain\nfacts are required to be noted. In paragraph 16 of the\nimpugned judgment and order, the learned Single Judge has\nframed the following five issues:\n\n\"(1) Whether the decisions of the Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of Ramesh Ram and Mamta Bisht will have any\napplication in the recruitment in question?\n\n(2) While following the above principles of law in the\nrecruitment in question, whether the actions of the State\nand the GPSC are otherwise erroneous and / or\nmischievous, as alleged by the petitioners?\n\n(3) Whether any illegality is committed by the State while\ngiving appointments to the candidates from the\nimpugned revised merit list dated 26.04.2011, prepared\nand published by the GPSC?\n\n(4) Whether any ineligible person is appointed from the\nimpugned list and if yes, whether he / she is illegally\ncontinued by the State in service, and for that purpose,\nwhether any manipulation / tampering is made with the\nrecord by any officer, as alleged by the petitioners?\n\n(5) After giving such appointments from the impugned merit\nlist dated 26.04.2011, at least 41 candidates have not\njoined the service, which the State is refusing to make\navailable to the candidates who are next in merit, on the\nbasis of the very same examination, though the claim of\nthose next meritorious candidates is within the notified\nand vacant posts. Whether this action of the State is\nsustainable and / or whether the claim of the petitioners\nshould be accepted to the extent of notified vacant\n\nPage 63 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nposts?\"\n\n34. It may be noted insofar as Issues No.3 and 4 are\nconcerned, the same arise out of Special Civil Application\nNo.8203 of 2012 and hence, are not the subject matter of\nthese appeals.\n\n35. In these appeals, the court is primarily concerned with\nIssues No.1, 2 and 5.\n\n36.\nIn this backdrop, the next question that arises for\nconsideration is, whether the learned Single Judge was right in\nholding that the decisions in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) and\nRajesh Daria as followed in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) were not\nproperly applied during the course of the recruitment process?\n\n37. At this juncture, reference may be made to the impugned\njudgment and order to see how the learned Single Judge has\ndealt with this issue. The findings on the first issue are noted\nunder two heads. The first is qua the application of the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) and\nthe second is qua the application of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra).\n\n37.1 Insofar as the first part as regards the applicability\nof the decision of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra)\nis concerned, the learned Single Judge found that the decision\nof the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India is the\ndeclaration of law, which needs to be applied with full force\nand in totality even in the recruitment in question, though\n\nPage 64 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthere may not be any rule like that in the State of Gujarat.\n\n37.2 Insofar as the applicability of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) is concerned, the\nlearned Single Judge first examined as to whether there was\nany declaration of law in that decision and came to the\nconclusion that there is no declaration of law in that decision,\nbut that the declaration of law can be traced in the decision of\nthe Supreme Court of India in the case of\nRajesh Kumar\nDaria v. Rajasthan Public Service Commission\n, (2007) 8\nSCC 785. The learned Single Judge further held that the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh Daria is\nthe law and the same would apply to the recruitment in\nquestion as well.\nThe learned Single Judge further held that the\ndecision of this court in Komal Katara (supra) would not have\nany applicability to the recruitment in question.\n\n37.3 In paragraph 19.6 of the impugned judgment, the\nlearned Single Judge held thus:-\n\n\"19.6 Considering the totality, it is held that the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of India in the case of\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria are the declarations of\nlaw, which are applicable to all the recruitments and the\nrecruitment in question is no exception. The first issue is\nthus answered in favour of the respondent Authorities.\"\n\n38. As noticed earlier, the challenge to the revised list was on\ntwo counts. Firstly, on the ground that the rules did not\ncontemplate revision of a list which was already published; and\n\nPage 65 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nsecondly, on the ground that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) would not be applicable to the\nrecruitment in question and that in the light of the decision of\nthis court in Dr. Komal Manubhai Katara (supra) the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Mamta Bisht would also not\nbe applicable. Insofar as the first ground is concerned, a bare\nperusal of the impugned judgment reveals that such ground\nhas not been dealt with, despite which, the original petitioners\nhave not raised any grievance about the same. Insofar as the\nsecond ground is concerned, the learned Single Judge has held\nagainst the petitioners, but the petitioners have accepted the\nsaid findings recorded by the learned Single Judge and have\nnot challenged the same.\n\n39. The learned Single Judge then decided issues No.3 and 4\nwhich relate to the process of appointment by the State\nGovernment after the merit list was forwarded by the\nCommission, wherein the learned Single Judge has found\nseveral irregularities and illegalities. The learned Single Judge\nin paragraph 27.1 of the impugned judgment has held that\nissues No.3 and 4 need to be answered by holding that number\nof illegalities in procedure and in substance - both, are\ncommitted by the State while giving appointments to the\ncandidates from the revised merit list dated 26.4.2011 and\nfurther that ineligible person(s) is appointed and for that\npurpose, even manipulation and tampering is also made with\nthe record, which could be by some officer(s), which the State\nneeds to find out and deal with. Thus, it is evident that issues\nNo.3 and 4 relate to a stage after the forwarding of the revised\nmerit list by the Commission to the State Government and,\ntherefore, have no connection with the issue involved in the\n\nPage 66 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npetitions which give rise to these letters patent appeals\nwherein the validity of the merit list was subject matter of\nchallenge.\n\n40.\nInsofar as the findings on the first part of issue No.1 are\nconcerned, the learned Single Judge held that the application\nof the decision of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra)\ncould be by the State at the stage of allocation of the service\nand not by the Commission while preparing the merit list.\n\n41. At this juncture, reference may be made to the findings\nrecorded by the learned Single Judge in this regard, which are\nextracted herein below for ready reference:\n\n\"29.5 Though there cannot be any dispute that\nRamesh Ram is the law of the land and recruitment in\nquestion is no exception to it, the application thereof\ncould be by the State at the stage of allocation of the\nservice, and not by the GPSC while preparing the merit\nlist. In the present case, it is done by the GPSC and not\nby the State. This is not merely an error, it has resulted\ninto serious consequences, without any cure thereof.\nThus, it has resulted in illegality - in procedure and in\nsubstance, both. Breach in procedure is to the extent\nthat it was to be applied by the State after the\nrecommendations are received from GPSC, however it is\napplied by the GPSC before recommendations are made\nto the Government. Breach in substance is to the extent\nthat there is exclusion of number of candidates from the\nselect list on the ill-perceived application of Ramesh\nRam, though in some cases the concerned MRC had not\nonly not asked for it, he had specifically refused to do so.\nThese two aspects are interwoven and can be explained\nfrom the following examples which are not hypothetical\nbut based on the impugned merits list dated 26.04.2011.\n\n29.6 There are number of candidates, belonging to\nreserved category, who got the place in the select list on\ntheir own merits, without availing any concession and\n\nPage 67 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nwere thus Meritorious Reserved Category Candidate\n(MRC), however they were treated to be Reserved\nCategory Candidate (RC) by GPSC itself by applying\nRamesh Ram, on assumption that thereby they might get\nthe posts of their higher preference. However, when the\nrecommendations were made to the Government of\nthose candidates, and when the appointments were\ngiven to them by the State, ultimately those candidates\ndid not join the service at all. Ramesh Ram would not\ncome in play qua those candidates at all. This has\nresulted into exclusion of few reserved category\ncandidates from the select list. This is the damage which\nthe GPSC and the State both have done to the reserved\ncategory candidates. To elaborate this point further, it is\nnoted that, one candidate viz., Rohitkumar\nRameshchandra Wadhwana, Merit Rank No.76, total\nMarks obtained - 638, had not availed any concession as\nSEBC candidate and therefore his name was included as\ngeneral category candidate in the merit list of 2010 at\nSerial No.76.(This aspect is noted in the footnote of the\n2010 list.) In the impugned list dated 26.04.2011 he is\nshown as SEBC candidate I.e. though he was an MRC, he\nis now treated to be a reserved category candidate. This\nis done by the GPSC on assumption that if he continues\nto be an unreserved category candidate I.e. MRC, he may\nnot get Deputy Superintendent of Police, which is the\npost of his first preference. Therefore he is treated as\nSEBC candidate. His name therefore is included in\nAnnexure- III-B with the impugned list dated 26.04.2011.\n\nThe effect thereof is that resultantly, one SEBC candidate\nis pushed out of the list. It is noted that the said\ncandidate ultimately did not join the service at all. Thus\nthe ratio of Ramesh Ram which was to apply at the stage\nof allocation of service, that too at the option of the\nconcerned MRC, is forcefully applied by the GPSC though\nthat candidate was not to join the service at all, even if\nhe was to get the post of his first choice. The damage of\napplying Ramesh Ram wrongly is already done and still\nthe cure thereof is denied by the GPSC and the State,\nboth. It is this situation which needs to be taken care of\nby this Court. It is also noted that this example is only\nillustrative and not exhaustive.\n\n29.7 The illegality does not end there. There were many\nreserved category candidates, who got the place in the\nselect list on their own merits without availing any\n\nPage 68 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nconcession and were thus Meritorious Reserved Category\nCandidates (MRCs), however they were treated to be\nReserved Category Candidate (RC) by GPSC by applying\nRamesh Ram, on assumption that thereby they might get\nthe posts of their higher preference. However, when the\nrecommendations were made to the Government of\nthose candidates, and when in turn the appointments\nwere given to them by the State, actual benefit is not\npassed to the deserving candidates but is siphoned away\nby other candidates. For this purpose, one example is\nnoted in the later part of this judgment (para : 43.7).\n\n30. From the above, the conclusion is that, though the\ndecision of the Supreme Court of India in the case of\nRamesh Ram will have application in the recruitment in\nquestion also, it is unauthorisedly applied by the GPSC at\na premature stage, since it was to be applied by the\nState, at the stage of allocation of service to the MRCs.\nThe further conclusion is also that it is applied to even\nthose candidates, where it was not required. The\nconsequence of this illegality is that it has resulted in\nexclusion of many reserved category candidates from the\nrevised merit list dated 26.04.2011 (the impugned one),\nwho were already there in the first select list of the year\n2010 which was qua this very recruitment.\"\n\n42. It may be noted insofar the findings recorded in\nparagraph 29.7 of the impugned judgment are concerned,\nthere is no factual basis for such findings. There is no material\nwhatsoever to show that any reserved category seats have\nbeen siphoned away by any other candidate. The record of the\ncase shows that out of the meritorious reserved category\ncandidates, only one candidate did not join. Those meritorious\nreserved category candidates who are allocated seats of their\nhigher preference in the reserved category have not raised any\ngrievance that they would have preferred a seat of their lower\npreference in the general category; and in any case, in view of\nthe proviso to sub-rule (1) of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules, since\nit is not permissible to change the order of preference, a\n\nPage 69 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nmeritorious reserved category candidate who gets a seat of his\nhigher preference in the reserved category cannot refuse a\npost of his higher preference and seek a post of his lower\npreference in the general category.\n\n43. As regards the second part of Issue No.1, namely the\napplication of the decision of the Supreme Court in\nMamta\nBisht\n(supra) is concerned, the learned Single Judge held that\nthough the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nRajesh Daria\n(supra) as followed in the case of Mamta Bisht\nwill have application in the recruitment in question also, the\naction of the respondent authorities, on facts, is found less to\nuphold the law, more to take advantage of it. The learned\nSingle Judge, accordingly, has held thus:\n\n\"33. For the above reasons, it is held that, though the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court of India in the case of\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria (as followed in Mamta\nBisht) will have application in the recruitment in question,\nas answered vide issue No.1, while following the said\nprinciples of law, the actions of the State and the GPSC\nare not only erroneous but have been mischievous. The\nstand of the State and the GPSC that the impugned\naction was taken by them to uphold the law, is rejected\nand it is declared that it was more for their convenience\nand advantage, less for upholding the law.\"\n\nThus, while holding that the decisions of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria (as followed in Mamta\nBisht) would be applicable to the recruitment in question, the\nlearned Single Judge has held that while following the said\nprinciples of law, the actions of the State Government and the\nCommission are erroneous and mischievous.\n\nPage 70 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n44. In paragraph 35.1, the learned Single Judge has inter alia\nheld that since the illegality has started from the preparation\nof the impugned merit list dated 26.4.2011, the correction\nshould also start from that stage itself. The petitions therefore,\nneed to be allowed by setting aside the impugned select list\ndated 26.4.2011 prepared and published by the Commission.\nThe learned Single Judge was however of the view that the\nconsequences of doing so would be very far reaching and\ntherefore, tried to explore other options. The learned Single\nJudge thought that one way which can salvage the situation to\na substantial extent is that the total number of affected\npersons by the impugned action of the respondents is forty. It\nhas come on record that at least forty one candidates have not\njoined. After referring to the details of the vacancies, the\nlearned Single Judge observed that relief can be granted to the\naffected candidates against the unfilled notified vacancies and\nthat instead of setting aside all subsequent actions of the\nState, direction needs to be given to the State and the\nCommission to offer appointments to the next meritorious\ncandidates on the notified unfilled vacancies from the\nadvertisement in question. The learned Single Judge further\nobserved that while undertaking this exercise, the decision of\nthis court in the case of\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) shall also be kept\nin view.\n\n45. Thus, insofar as the application of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is concerned, the\nlearned Single Judge has held that though that decision would\nbe applicable to the recruitment in question, the same has to\nbe applied at the stage of allocation of posts by the\nGovernment and not at the time of preparation of the list by\n\nPage 71 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe Commission recommending names of candidates to the\nextent of the advertised vacancies. The correctness of such\nview has to be examined in the context of the rules applicable\nto the recruitment in question, namely the Gujarat Civil\nServices (Class I and Class II) Competitive Examination Rules,\n2000. For this purpose, reference may be made to relevant\nrules:-\n\n46. Rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules provides for Order of\nPreference and says that:\n\n\"(1) A candidates at the time of interview test shall\nindicate in his own hand writing, the order of preferences\nfor the posts to which he desires to be considered for\nappointment in such manner as may be prescribed by\nthe Commission:\n\nProvided that the preference once given by the\ncandidate shall be treated as final and no request for\nrevision, addition, alteration or change in the preference\nshall be entertained by the Commission or by the\nGovernment.\n\n(2)(a) The order of preference for the posts\nindicated by the candidate shall not confer any right for\nappointment to those posts. Having regard to the rank in\nthe order of merit and the number of posts available, the\npreference given by the candidate shall be considered by\nthe Government at the time of his appointment.\n\n(b) Where a candidate has not given preference\nfor any post, or the candidate has given preference only\nfor a few posts, and the number of posts for which he has\ngiven preference are not available to accommodate the\ncandidate as per his preference, such candidate shall be\nconsidered for appointment to any of the remaining posts\nafter the process of appointment of the other candidates,\nwho have given preference for all the scheduled posts, is\ncompleted.\n\n(3) The appointment of a candidate to a particular\n\nPage 72 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npost shall be subject to the provision of recruitment rules\nin force relating to that post.\n\n(4) Where a candidate fails to join the post offered\nto him, his name shall be deleted from the list of\ncandidates recommended by the Commission for\nappointment.\n\n(5) Where the candidate has been appointed to a\nparticular post, no request shall be entertained by the\nGovernment for change of appointment to another post.\"\n\n47. Thus, in terms of the sub-rule (1) of rule 9 of the Gujarat\nRules read with the proviso thereto, the candidate has to give\nhis order of preference at the time of interview and is not\npermitted to change the same thereafter. Evidently, therefore,\nallocation of seats would be in the order of preference given by\nthe candidate subject to availability of posts.\n\n48. Rule 17 bears the heading \"List of order of merit\" and\nreads thus:\n\n\"17. The names of the candidates shall be arranged by\nthe Commission in the order of merit on the basis of\naggregate marks finally awarded to each candidate in the\nMain Examination (written) and interview test and in that\norder, the Commission shall recommend the qualified\ncandidates for appointment to the extent of the number\nof vacancies to be filled in:\n\nProvided further that where the vacancies reserved for\ncandidates belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled\nTribe and Socially and Educationally Backward Class,\n(including Nomadic Tribes and Denotified Tribes) cannot\nbe filled up on the basis of the qualifying aggregate\nmarks fixed for general category, the Commission may\nrelax the standard of aggregate marks to make up the\ndeficiency in the reserved posts.\"\n\n49. Thus, to the extent the above rule is relevant for the\n\nPage 73 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\npresent purpose, it provides that the Commission shall prepare\na list in order of merit and recommend the qualified candidates\nfor appointment to the extent of the number of vacancies to be\nfilled in. Accordingly, in the present case, the Commission was\nrequired to recommend names of 317 candidates in the order\nof merit.\n\n50. While recommending the names of 317 candidates, it is\nnot as if the Commission had to just recommend candidates in\nterms of the marks obtained. While doing so, the Commission\nwas required to keep in view the reservation of seats for the\nvarious categories like Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe,\nSocially and Educationally Backward Class, etc. as well as\nreservation for women. For this purpose, the Commission was\nrequired to ascertain as to how many reserved category\ncandidates would qualify for general category seats so that the\nnumber of candidates who should be recommended in the\nreserved category can be worked out. Similarly, while\ncomputing the horizontal reservation in case of women, such\nexercise was also needed to be carried out.\n\n51. Rule 19 of the Gujarat Rules provides for \"Result of\nexamination\" and reads thus:\n\n\"(1) The Commission shall publish, in the Official\nGazette, the result of the examination in a single list of\nClass-I and Class-II posts.\n\n(2)(a) The result of the candidates, whose\nnames are to be recommended to the Government for\nthe appointment to the posts of Class-I and Class-II, shall\nbe arranged according to the order of merits of\ncandidates along with the seat number and the total\nmarks obtained by each of the candidates.\n\nPage 74 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n(b) The Commission shall also display on its notice\nboard the result of unsuccessful candidates containing\nthe names, seat number and total marks obtained by\neach of the candidates.\n\n(3) The Commission shall send a copy of the\nresult so published in the Official Gazette to the\nGovernment.\"\n\n52. On a plain reading of the above rule, it is evident that it\ncontemplates publication of the result in a single list in the\norder of merits of candidates. Clause (b) of sub-rule (2) of rule\n19 of the Gujarat Rules requires the Commission to display the\nresult of unsuccessful candidates. The rule does not\ncontemplate preparation of any wait list.\n\n53. Rule 22 provides for forwarding the result to the\nGovernment and reads thus:\n\n\"22. The Commission, on declaration of the result shall\nforward to the Government the list of candidates who are\nrecommended for appointment along with necessary\nparticulars such as whether candidate belongs to\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or Socially and\nEducationally Backward Classes including Nomadic Tribes\nand Denotified Tribes\" and his date of birth,\nqualifications, order of preference for post and such other\nparticulars as the State Government may direct.\"\n\n54. On a conjoint reading of rules 17, 19(2)(a) and 22 of the\nGujarat Rules, it emerges that names of candidates to the\nextent of notified vacancies are required to be recommended\nand the result of the candidates whose names are to be\nrecommended for appointment is required to be arranged in\nthe order of merit. The list so prepared shall contain necessary\nparticulars as to whether the candidate belongs to any\n\nPage 75 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nreserved category, his date of birth, qualifications and order of\npreference for post. Thus, the order of preference for post is\nrequired to be indicated in the list itself.\n\n55. It may be noted that the Gujarat Rules do not have any\nrule akin to rule 16 of the Civil Services Examination Rules\nwhich came up for interpretation in the case of\nRamesh Ram\n\n(supra); however, it is an admitted position that the decision of\nRamesh Ram has to be applied even to this recruitment\ninasmuch as the learned Single Judge has held Issue No.1 in\nfavour of the Government and the petitioners in the writ\npetitions have not challenged such finding. The question that\nthen arises for consideration is the manner and the stage at\nwhich the decision is to be applied and whether the course of\naction adopted by the respondents would render the revised\nlist invalid.\n\n56. A perusal of the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) shows that it was the constitutional\nvalidity of sub-rules (2) and (5) of rule 16 of the Civil Services\nExamination Rules that was subject matter of challenge\ntherein. The court was, therefore, concerned with the validity\nof those rules. Reference may be made to the relevant\nextracts of\nthe said decision\nwhich read as under:-\n\n\"19. The case of the contesting respondents is that the\nnewly introduced system which is different from the\nsingle list system followed earlier (prior to amendment of\nthe CSE Rules) will undermine the rights of the reserved\ncategory candidates to get assigned to services of higher\npreference (e.g. IAS, IPS or IRS). They also urged that this\nsystem will reduce the aggregate number of reserved\ncandidates who will be selected while simultaneously\n\nPage 76 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nincreasing the number of general candidates. It also puts\ncandidates who come through the second list at a\ndisadvantage in terms of seniority and promotions for\nrest of their career in their respective services. By the\nimpugned order, the High Court had vindicated these\ngrievances, particularly those raised by OBC candidates.\n\n20. In the light of the submissions made by the learned\ncounsel appearing for different appellants, the following\nquestions arise for consideration:\n\nI. Whether the reserved category candidates who\nwere selected on merit (i.e. MRCs) and placed in the list\nof general category candidates could be considered as\nreserved category candidates at the time of \"service\nallocation\"?\n\nII. Whether Rules 16(2), (3), (4) and (5) of the CSE\nRules are inconsistent with Rule 16(1) and violative of\n\nArticles 14\n, 16(4)\nand\nof the Constitution of India?\nIII. Whether the order of the Central Administrative\nTribunal was valid to the extent that it relied on\nAnurag\nPatel v. U.P. Public Service Commission\n, (2005) 9 SCC\n742 (which in turn had referred to the judgment in\nRitesh\nR. Sah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul\n, (1996) 3 SCC 253, which dealt\nwith reservations for the purpose of admission to\npostgraduate medical courses); and whether the\nprinciples followed for reservations in admissions to\neducational institutions can be applied to examine the\nconstitutionality of a policy that deals with reservation in\ncivil services.\"\n\n\"35. The learned counsel for the respondent questioned\nthe rationale of declaring CSE results in two phases in\norder to support the proposition that even if MRC\ncandidates are given a service of a higher preference,\nthey should not oust lower-ranked reserved category\ncandidates. However, Rule 16(2) should not be\ninterpreted in an isolated manner since it was designed\nto protect the interests of MRC candidates. MRC\ncandidates having indicated their status as SC/ST/OBC at\nthe time of application, begin their participation in the\nexamination process as reserved candidates. Having\nqualified as per the general qualifying standard, they\nhave the additional option of opting out of the reserved\ncategory and occupying a general post. Where, however,\nthey are able to secure a better post in the reserved list\n\nPage 77 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ntheir placement in the general list should not deprive\nthem of the same. In that respect, the adjustment\nreferred to in Rule 16(2) does not, in fact, denote any\nchange in the status of MRC from general to reserved. To\nthe contrary, it is an affirmation of the reserved status of\nMRC candidate. Rule 16(2) exists to protect this reserved\nstatus of the MRC candidates.\n\n36. We must also take note of the fact that when MRC\ncandidates get adjusted against the reserved category,\nthe same creates corresponding vacancies in the general\nmerit list (since MRC candidates are on both lists). These\nvacancies are of course filled up by general candidates.\nLikewise, when MRC candidates are subsequently\nadjusted against the general category [i.e. without\navailing the benefit of Rule 16(2)], the same will result in\nvacancies in the reserved category which must in turn be\nfilled up by wait-listed reserved candidates. Moreover,\nthe operation of Rule 16 does not result in the ouster of\nany of the candidates recommended in the first list. Many\nof the wait-listed candidates are accommodated in the\nsecond stage, and the relatively lower ranked wait-listed\ncandidates are excluded. It is pertinent to note that these\nexcluded candidates never had any absolute right to\nrecruitment or even any expectation that they would be\nrecruited. Their chances depend on how MRC candidates\nare adjusted.\"\n\n\"42. Therefore, we are of the firm opinion that MRC\ncandidates who avail the benefit of Rule 16(2) and are\neventually adjusted in the reserved category should be\ncounted as part of the reserved pool for the purpose of\ncomputing the aggregate reservation quotas. The seats\nvacated by MRC candidates in the general pool will\ntherefore be offered to general category candidates. This\nis the only viable solution since allotting these general\ncategory seats (vacated by MRC candidates) to relatively\nlower-ranked reserved category candidates would result\nin aggregate reservations exceeding 50% of the total\nnumber of available seats. Hence, we see no hurdle to\nthe migration of MRC candidates to the reserved\ncategory.\"\n\n\"59. On behalf of the respondents in the appeals, it was\nsubmitted that Rules 16(2), (3), (4) & (5) infringes Article\n\nPage 78 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n16(4). We do not accept this proposition since Rule 16(2)\nand the subsequent sub-rules merely recognise and\nadvance inter se merit among the reserved category\ncandidates in the manner that has been demonstrated\nbefore us by the learned Solicitor General. Therefore,\nRule 16 protects the interests of a reserved category\ncandidate selected in the general (unreserved) category\nby giving him the option either to retain his position in\nthe open merit category or to be considered for a\nvacancy in the reserved category, if it is more\nadvantageous to him/her.\n\n60. The need for incorporating such a provision is to\narrest arbitrariness and to protect the interests of the\nmeritorious reserved category candidates. If such rule is\ndeclared redundant and unconstitutional vis-à-vis\nArticles\n, 16\nand\nthen the whole object of equality clause\nin the Constitution would be frustrated and MRC\ncandidates selected as per the general qualifying\nstandard would be disadvantaged since the candidate of\nhis/her category who is below him/her in the merit list,\nmay by availing the benefits of reservation attain a\nbetter service when allocation of services is made. Rule\n16 in essence and spirit protects the pledge outlined in\nthe Preamble of the Constitution which conceives of\nequality of status and opportunity.\"\n\n57. At this juncture, reference may be made to the\naverments made in the affidavit-in-reply of the Commission\nwherein the manner in which the second list has been\nprepared has been set out. It has been averred therein that the\nfirst list was prepared by applying the decision of this court in\nKomal Katara (supra) that is, on a misunderstanding that the\nfemale candidates making it to the merit list on their own merit\nwithout availing any benefit of female reservation were not to\nbe counted towards female reservation and that only those\nfemale candidates who were included in the merit list by\nrelaxing the general merit standard were to be counted\ntowards female reservation. Out of the 317 vacancies, 101\n\nPage 79 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nwere earmarked for female candidates in addition to the\nfemale candidates who were otherwise finding place in the\nmerit list generally in the respective category. Accordingly, 28\nfemale candidates who had found place in the list on their own\nmerit were not taken into account and were excluded from the\nfemale reservation quota and thereafter 28 female candidates\nwere pushed up from the different categories by relaxing the\nminimum merit standard for each such category of female\ncandidates and placed in the merit list. This resulted in 128\nfemale candidates getting into the merit list against a total 101\nvacancies for female reservation.\n\n57.1 It is further averred that while implementing the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in\nRajesh Daria\n(supra), 28\nfemale candidates who found place in the list on their own\nmerit were also counted towards the women's reservation\nquota of 101 and consequently, 28 female candidates were\npushed out in the second list. It is further averred that as many\nas 17 MRC candidates have been offered more preferred posts\nin conformity with the decision of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram.\n\n58.\nIn the aforesaid backdrop, having regard to the Gujarat\nRules of 2000 which govern the recruitment in question, what\nis required to be examined is as to how the principles\nlaid\ndown in\n\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria\n(supra) can be\napplied to the recruitment in question.\n\n59. At this juncture, reference may be made the procedure\nprovided under rule 16 of the Civil Services Examination Rules\nas referred to in the decision of the Supreme Court in Ramesh\n\nPage 80 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nRam (supra). The court observed thus:\n\n\"Proviso to sub-rule (1) lays down that a candidate who\nbelongs to the SC, ST and OBC categories and who has\nqualified on his own in the merit list shall not be\nrecommended against the vacancies reserved for such\nclasses if such candidate has not availed of any of the\nconcessions or relaxations in the eligibility or the\nselection criteria. The other sub-rules provide as to how\nmeritorious reserved category candidates are to be\nadjusted and once they get services of their preference\nafter availing the benefit of their reserved status (as SC,\nST, OBC or any other applicable category), the\ncandidates whose names are in the consolidated reserve\nlists are to be subsequently adjusted. The consolidated\nwait list includes the candidates from general category\nand reserved category. If an MRC candidate who belongs\nto OBC category has availed the benefit of his status for\nbetter service allocation then the seat vacated by him\nwill go to a general category candidate. If he chooses not\nto avail the benefits of special status then he would be\ncounted in general category and the seat vacated by him\nin the reserved category will automatically go to a\ncandidate who belongs to the same reserved category.\n\nAs already explained, the current process entails\nthat a reserved candidate, although having done well\nenough in the examination to have qualified in the open\ncategory, does not automatically rescind his/her right to\na post in the reserved category.\"\n\n60. A perusal of the above decision reveals that rule 16 of the\nCSE Rules provided for two lists; one general category list\nwhich includes the meritorious reserved category candidates\nand the other a reserved category list with equal number of\nnames of general category and reserved category candidates\nto the extent of the number of meritorious reserved category\ncandidates included in the general category list are included. If\na meritorious reserved category candidate who belongs to the\nOBC category has availed the benefit of his status for better\n\nPage 81 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nservice allocation, then the seat vacated by him will go to a\ngeneral category candidate. If he chooses not to avail the\nbenefits of special status then he would be counted in general\ncategory and the seat vacated by him in the reserved category\nwill automatically go to a candidate who belongs to the same\nreserved category.\n\n61. Thus, while the Civil Services Examination Rules\nspecifically makes provision for a reserved list so as to meet\nwith the situation of migration of meritorious reserved\ncategory candidates to the reserved category, in the Gujarat\nRules there is no similar provision.\nIn the absence of such a\nprovision, what could be the mode of application of the ratio of\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) is\nthe question. However, one thing is clear, namely that, the\ndecision does not lay down any ratio to the effect that\npreference has to be considered at the stage of allotment of\npost by the Government.\n\n62. In this backdrop, it may be noted that in view of the\nprovisions of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules, the order of\npreference has to be given by a candidate at the time of\ninterview test which shall be treated as final and no request for\nrevision, addition, alteration or change therein shall be\nentertained by the Commission or the State Government.\nTherefore, once a candidate gives his order of preference, he is\nbound by it and cannot change it even at the stage of\nallocation of posts. Therefore, in case of a meritorious reserved\ncategory candidate, if he is in a position to get a general\ncategory post of his higher choice, he is required to be\nconsidered against such post. In case he is in a position to get\n\nPage 82 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\na post of his higher preference in the reserved category, he\nhas to be considered against such post in which case, his\nstatus would be that of a reserved category candidate.\nTherefore, to that extent one seat in the reserved category\ngets reduced and one seat in the general category gets\nincreased. Now if this exercise is carried out at the stage of\nallocation, if a meritorious reserved category candidate has to\nbe allotted a reserved category seat, then one general\ncategory seat would remain vacant and one reserved category\ncandidate from the list of names recommended by the\nCommission would be required to be pushed out creating an\nincongruous situation in the absence of any reserved list of\ncandidates. Therefore, considering the scheme of the Gujarat\nRules, which do not provide for exercise of any option at the\nstage of allotment of posts and which do not permit change of\norder of preference, the course of action adopted by the\nrespondents whereby the Commission has prepared the list by\nconsidering the preferences given by the meritorious reserved\ncategory candidates appears to be the most appropriate\nmanner of implementing the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nRamesh Ram\n(supra).\n\n63. A perusal of the select list shows that it has been\nprepared by the Commission on an application of the decisions\nof the Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram and Mamta Bisht\n\n(supra). For the purpose of applying Ramesh Ram, the\nCommission has taken into consideration the order of\npreference given by the candidates and where a meritorious\nreserved category candidate is not in a position to get the post\nof his first preference in the general category, he has been\nconsidered against the reserved post of his higher preference.\n\nPage 83 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nSignificantly, none of the meritorious reserved category\ncandidates have challenged the course of action adopted by\nthe respondents nor has any such candidate raised a grievance\nthat he was forced to migrate to a reserved seat on a post of\nhis higher preference though he would have preferred to have\nretained a post of lower preference in the general category.\nExcept for the fact that some reserved category candidates\nhave not joined service at all, which would have been possible\neven if preferences were considered at the stage of allocation\nof posts by the Government, no prejudice can be said to have\ncaused to anyone on account of the decision of Ramesh Ram\nbeing implemented at the stage of preparation of list by the\nCommission. Besides, as noted hereinabove, as the rules do\nnot provide for a wait list, preparing the list of recommended\ncandidates by applying Ramesh Ram at the stage of\npreparation of list, results in less posts remaining vacant,\ninasmuch as it is only in such cases where the candidates do\nnot join that the posts would remain vacant, whereas if\nRamesh Ram were to be considered at the stage of allocation\nof posts by the Government, the list of recommended\ncandidates would have to be prepared by considering all\nmeritorious reserved category candidates in the general\ncategory and when any such candidate opts for a post of his\nhigher preference in the reserved category, a reserved\ncategory candidate would have to be taken out of the list as\nsuch post would be then required to be filled in by a general\ncategory candidate, but the number of general category\ncandidates in the list of recommended candidates would not\nbe sufficient to fill up such general category posts, which would\nresult in such posts remaining vacant and additionally posts\nwould also remain vacant on account of non-joining of\n\nPage 84 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncandidates. For example if there are a 100 general category\nposts and in the list of 100 recommended candidates, there\nare 80 general category candidates and 20 meritorious\nreserved category candidates. Out of the 20 meritorious\nreserved candidates, 12 opt for reserved category posts of\ntheir higher preference, as a result of which 12 general\ncategory posts would be required to be filled up by general\ncategory candidates. Therefore, in all, the number of posts that\nare required to be filled up by general category candidates\nwould go up to that extent, viz. 80 + 12 general category\nposts, but the list contains only 80 general category\ncandidates, as a result of which the 12 posts would remain\nvacant as there is no provision for a wait list or reserved list.\nFurthermore, the last 12 reserved category candidates from\nthe list of recommended candidates would have to be pushed\nout of the list as no reserved category posts would be available\nfor allocation. Apart from this there might be candidates, who,\nafter allocation of posts may not join service, which would\nresult in such posts also remaining vacant. Therefore, applying\nRamesh Ram at the stage of allocation of posts would result\nin more posts remaining unfilled than by applying the decision\nat the stage of preparation of the list of recommended\ncandidates.\nIn the aforesaid premise, having regard to the\nexisting rules, no infirmity can be found in the course of action\nadopted by the State Government and the Commission in\napplying\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) at the stage of preparation of\nthe list of recommended candidates.\n\n64. In this case, the rules do not provide for preparation of a\nwait list and hence, once the entire list of the names\nrecommended by the Commission to the extent of vacancies\n\nPage 85 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nnotified is operated, there is no other list from which further\nappointments can be made, inasmuch as the rules\ncontemplate a list of candidates recommended for the posts to\nthe extent of vacancies and a list of unsuccessful candidates.\nAccordingly, the posts that remained vacant on account of\nnon-joining of candidates could not be filled in as the list had\nbeen exhausted. It is for this reason that about 41 seats\nremained vacant.\n\n65.\nInsofar as the application of the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of Mamta Bisht is concerned, which\nbasically follows the decision of the Supreme Court in\nRajesh\nDaria\n(supra), no infirmity has been pointed out by any of the\nlearned counsel for the respondents regarding the application\nthereof. It is nobody's case that the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of Mamta Bisht is required to be applied at\nthe stage of allocation of posts.\n\nIn\nRajesh Daria\n(supra), the\nSupreme Court has held that social reservations in favour of\nSC, ST and OBC under\nArticle 16(4)\nare \"vertical reservations\".\nSpecial reservations in favour of physically handicapped,\nwomen, etc. under\nArticles 16(1)\nand\n15(3)\nare \"horizontal\nreservations\". Where a vertical reservation is made in favour of\na Backward Class under\nArticle 16(4)\n, the candidates belonging\nto such Backward Class, may compete for non-reserved posts\nand if they are appointed to the non-reserved posts on their\nown merit, their number will not be counted against the quota\nreserved for the respective Backward Class. Therefore, if the\nnumber of SC candidates, who by their own merit, get selected\nto open competition vacancies, equals or even exceeds the\npercentage of posts reserved for SC candidates, it cannot be\nsaid that the reservation quota for SCs stood filled. The entire\n\nPage 86 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nreservation quota will be intact and available in addition to\nthose selected under open competition category. But the said\nprinciple applicable to vertical (social) reservations will not\napply to horizontal (special) reservations. Where a special\nreservation for women is provided within the social reservation\nfor SCs, the proper procedure is first to fill up the quota for SCs\nin order of merit and then find out the number of candidates\namong them who belong to the special reservation group of\n\"Scheduled Caste women\". If the number of women in such list\nis equal to or more than the number of special reservation\nquota, then there is no need for further selection towards the\nspecial reservation quota. Only if there is any shortfall, the\nrequisite number of Scheduled Caste women shall have to be\ntaken by deleting the corresponding number of candidates\nfrom the bottom of the list relating to Scheduled Castes. To\nthis extent, horizontal (special) reservation differs from vertical\n(social) reservation. Thus women selected on merit within the\nvertical quota will be counted against the horizontal\nreservation for women.\n\n66.\nIn the facts of the present case, while preparing the first\nlist the Commission had applied the decision of this court in\nKomal Katara (supra), which is contrary to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nRajesh Daria\n(supra) and while preparing\nthe revised list they have followed the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in Rajesh Daria, as a result of which, 28 female\ncandidates at the bottom of the first list whose names found\nplace therein on account of application of the decision of this\ncourt in Komal Katara (supra) were pushed out of the revised\nlist.\n\nIt is not the case of any of the respondents that the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) cannot\n\nPage 87 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbe applied at the stage of preparation of the list of\nrecommended candidates. Strong reliance has been placed\nupon the findings of illegalities and irregularities in the\nrecruitment process as recorded by the learned Single Judge in\nthe impugned judgment; however, no infirmity has been\npointed out as regards the application of the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of Mamta Bisht while preparing\nthe list of recommended candidates.\n\n67. The learned Single Judge, in the impugned judgment, has\nreferred to various instances wherein the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nRajesh Daria\n(supra) as\nfollowed in the case of Mamta Bisht has not been followed by\nthe Commission imputing mala fides in applying the decision in\nthe present case. It is also observed that Mamta Bisht is\nsought to be relied upon mala fide only because it was\nrendered in 2010 after the merit list was prepared though the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Rajesh Daria was already\nholding the field and was not followed while preparing the first\nmerit list.\n\nThe learned Single Judge while holding that the\ndecision of Supreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) would be\napplicable to the recruitment in question, has alleged selective\nimplementation of the law by the Commission; however no\nspecific findings as regards the correctness or otherwise of the\napplication of\nthe said decision\nhave been recorded. This issue\nhas been lost sight in the spate of allegations and imputations\nof mala fides. Thus, the learned Single Judge has recorded a\nfinding that the decision of the Supreme Court in Rajesh\nDaria as followed in Mamta Bisht would be applicable to the\nrecruitment in question, which finding has not been called in\nquestion by the respondents. Nothing has been pointed out\n\nPage 88 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbefore this court to show that such decision has been wrongly\napplied by the Commission at the time of preparation of the\nlist of recommended candidates.\n\nUnder the circumstances, in\nthe absence of any infirmity in the application of the decision\nof the Supreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) at the time of\npreparation of the list of recommended candidates, those\ncandidates who have been pushed out on account of\napplication of\nthe said decision\nwhile preparing the revised list\nare not entitled to the grant of any relief.\n\nTherefore, those\noriginal petitioners who had approached this court challenging\nthe revised list on the ground of application of the decision of\nthe Supreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) not being entitled\nto the grant of any relief, the question of issuing directions to\nfill up vacant seats to that extent did not arise.\n\n68. A perusal of the impugned judgment and order reveals\nthat the learned Single Judge has not examined as to what is\nthe prejudice caused to the petitioners on account of applying\nthe decisions of\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria\n(supra) at\nthe stage of preparation of the list of recommended candidates\nby the Commission and as to which of the petitioners were\naffected by such action. It may be noted that it is the\npetitioners in the captioned petitions who had approached this\ncourt contending that their names were illegally removed from\nthe revised list on a wrong application of the decisions of the\nSupreme Court in Ramesh Ram and Mamta Bisht. Therefore,\nwhat was required to be examined was whether the decisions\nwere properly applied and if not which of the petitioners were\naffected by such improper application, and it is these\npetitioners alone, who could have been granted relief by the\nlearned Single Judge.\n\nPage 89 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n69. In the light of the above discussion, this court finds that\nthe learned Single Judge has answered Issue No.1 correctly.\nHowever, insofar as Issue No.2 is concerned, for the reasons\nrecorded hereinabove, this court cannot bring itself to agree\nwith the learned Single Judge that\nRamesh Ram\n(supra) has\nto be applied at the stage of allocation of posts and that\n\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) has been applied mala fide. In the light\nof the above discussion, the actions of the State and the\nCommission cannot be said to be erroneous. Insofar as the\nactions of the State and the Commission being mischievous\nare concerned, in the opinion of this court, when no such\nallegation was made in any of the petitions, the learned Single\nJudge was not justified in suo motu embarking upon an inquiry\non the basis of the record produced before him in a petition\nwhich was heard along with the captioned petitions and\nwherein there were allegations of mala fide and tampering etc.\nin the process of allocation of posts. Moreover, the judgment of\nthe learned Single Judge in Special Civil Application No. 8203 of\n2017, wherein there were allegations of illegalities,\nirregularities and mala fide has already been set aside by a co-\nordinate bench by a judgment and order dated 20/21.12.2017\npassed in Letters Patent Appeal No.727 of 2017.\n\nAssuming for\nthe sake of argument that the Government and the\nCommission have selectively applied the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra), even then, once a\nfinding is recorded that the principles laid down therein would\nbe applicable to the present recruitment, merely because in\nother cases such decision has not been applied would not\nvitiate the revised list.\n\nPage 90 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n70. Next, it may be noted that the learned Single Judge has\nafter finding that the impugned revised list is invalid, tried to\nsimplify the matter by directing that as there are forty affected\npersons and forty-one vacancies, the same may be filled up by\noffering the same to the next meritorious candidates and\nfurther to apply the decision of this court in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra)\nwhile doing so. It may be noted that in this case the\nappointments have been made in the year 2011 and six years\nhave elapsed thereafter.\n\nWhile implementing the decision of\nthis court in\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra) the respondents are required\nto carry out reshuffling for the purpose of ensuring that less\nmeritorious candidates are not placed above the candidates\nwho are higher in merit, on account of which, several\ncomplications have arisen. Moreover, instead of the original\npetitioners getting relief, candidates who at no point of time\nhad raised any grievance are getting the benefit of the\njudgment.\n\n71. The learned Single Judge has held that the notified\nvacancies in the advertisement in question which have\nremained unfilled because of non-joining of candidates need to\nbe filled up by the State by offering them to the next\nmeritorious candidates. On behalf of the respondents, viz., the\noriginal petitioners as well as the beneficiaries of the impugned\njudgment, it has been contended that in the absence of the\nState having taken a conscious decision not to fill up the\nvacancies, such vacancies are required to be filled up. In this\nregard, a perusal of the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition\nshows that the writ petitioners had challenged the select list\ndated 26.4.2011 and had sought a direction to the respondents\nto operate and implement the final select list dated 13.5.2010\n\nPage 91 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nand to give the petitioners appointments accordingly. Except\nfor the petitioner in Special Civil application No.11163 of 2012,\nnone of the petitioners had come before this court seeking\nfilling up of the vacancies arising out of non-joining of\ncandidates. However, the learned Single Judge upon finding\nthat the impugned revised list requires to be set aside, has\ninstead of disturbing the appointments already made has\nmaintained the list as it is, but has issued directions for filling\nup the posts that remained vacant on account of non-joining of\ncandidates. Therefore, when in the light of what is discussed\nhereinabove, this court has upheld the validity of the\nimpugned revised list, the question of filling up the vacancies\nas directed by the learned Single Judge would not arise.\nMoreover, as noticed earlier, the rules contemplate preparation\nof single list whereby names of the candidates are required to\nbe recommended by the Commission to the extent of the\nvacancies advertised. The names of rest of the candidates\nwould find place in the list of unsuccessful candidates.\nTherefore, if there are any vacancies on account of non-joining\nof candidates, there is no other list on which the respondents\ncould fall back upon for the purpose of filling up of such\nvacancies.\n\n72. in the opinion of this court, rule 17 as substituted by the\nAmending Rules of 2009 only makes explicit what was implicit\nin the existing rule 17, namely that there shall be no waiting\nlist. Therefore, the question as to whether the amended rule\n17 of the Gujarat Rules would operate prospectively or\nretrospectively does not require to be gone into. Besides, as\nrightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants,\nthe decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the\n\nPage 92 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrespondents on the prospective operation of the rules have all\nbeen rendered in the context of facts where the rules changed\nthe eligibility criteria for appointment to a post, which made\nthe candidates ineligible for such post thereby affecting their\nsubstantive right to be considered for appointment, which is\nnot so in the present case. However, it is not necessary to\ndwell any further on this issue.\n\n73. Insofar as the other illegalities and irregularities referred\nto in the impugned judgment on the basis of the original\nGovernment record is concerned, the same relate to the stage\nof making appointment and have no relevance insofar as the\npreparation of revised merit list is concerned. Besides as\nnoticed earlier, the record was produced by the Government as\nit sought to rely upon the same in the case of Reema Munshi,\nthe petitioner in Special Civil Application No.8203 of 2012,\nwhose appointment was under challenge and against whom a\nwrit of quo warranto was sought from the court. All the\nobservations in relation to Issues No.3 and 4 primarily relate to\nthe said case. It may be recalled that the decision of the\nlearned Single Judge to the extent of that writ petition was\ncalled in question by the said candidate by filing an appeal\nbefore this court and a Division Bench of this court by a\njudgment and order dated 20/21.12.2017 rendered in Letters\nPatent Appeal No.727 of 2017 allowed the letters patent\nappeal and set aside the directions of the learned Single Judge\nthat the appellant original respondent No.4 shall vacate the\npost of Deputy Superintendent of Police. Therefore, the\nquestion of relying upon the same in the context of the other\nwrit petitioners does not arise. In case if at the stage of\nallotment any illegality has been committed, it is for the\n\nPage 93 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nindividual affected candidate to raise such grievance. In this\ncase, the court is concerned with the validity of revised merit\nlist and the observations of illegalities and irregularities in the\nmanner of appointment which is subsequent to the preparation\nof the revised list have no relevance.\n\n74. The contention that the appellants cannot be said to be\naggrieved as no less meritorious candidate has been placed\nabove the appellants on account of operation of the impugned\njudgment, loses sight of the fact that no more meritorious\ncandidate had challenged the select list or come to the court\nseeking a relief that the vacancies be filled in. Therefore, for\nyears together the appellants have been placed on the\nseniority list in a particular order which would be disturbed if\nanyone is placed above them, even if they be more meritorious\ncandidates.\n\n75.\nIn all these petitions, the petitioners in their individual\ncapacity have come before this court challenging the revised\nlist whereby their names which found place in the first list\nstood excluded on account of application of the decisions of\nthe Supreme Court in\nRamesh Ram and Rajesh Daria\n\n(supra). The scope of the petitions, therefore, was restricted to\nthe validity of the revised list and the grant of relief to the\npetitioners therein. Therefore, what was to be examined was\nwhether the petitioners were entitled to any relief. If any of the\npetitioners was wrongly excluded from the list, he or she would\nhave been entitled to the grant of relief. However, in the\nabsence of any finding that any of the petitioners was wrongly\nexcluded from the merit list, the course of action adopted by\nthe learned Single Judge was not permissible. In any case,\n\nPage 94 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nrelief could be granted to the petitioners who had come before\nthe court, and no general directions could have been issued in\nthe manner as has been done which results in mass reshuffling\nat this stage and filling up of seats by candidates who had not\ncome before this court, the implementation whereof has given\nrise to umpteen number of petitions. The learned Single Judge,\nby issuing such general directions, and not restricting the\nreliefs to the petitioners alone, has literally opened a Pandora's\nBox. The impugned judgment and order passed by the learned\nSingle Judge, therefore, cannot be sustained.\n\n76. Insofar as the petitioner in Special Civil Application\nNo.11163 of 2012 is concerned, at the outset, it may be noted\nthat the learned Single Judge in paragraph 9 of the judgment\nhas referred to the submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner. In paragraph 12.2, the response thereto by the\nlearned Advocate General has been recorded thus:\n\n\"12.2 Replying to the case the petitioners of Special\nCivil Application No.11163 of 2012, learned advocate\ngeneral has submitted that the said petitioner could not\nhave been offered the post of Dy.S.P. since he was not\nwithin the zone of merit, at the time of allotment. It is\nsubmitted that if the candidate appointed does not join,\nthe said post is not made available to any other\ncandidate and the same is carried to the next\nadvertisement. It is further submitted that the said post\neven otherwise, can not go to this petitioner, since there\nare many more persons above him in the merit list. It is\nsubmitted that this petition also be dismissed.\"\n\n77. However, thereafter there is no discussion as regards the\nmerits or otherwise of the case and no relief has been\nspecifically granted to the petitioner and his petition appears\nto have been answered along with the remaining petitioners by\n\nPage 95 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nissuing directions to fill in the vacancies by offering the posts\nto the next meritorious candidates in the recruitment in\nquestion keeping in mind the ratio\nlaid down by\nthis court in\nthe case of\nD.G. Dalal\n(supra). From the averments made in\nthe affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the respondents, it\nemerges that the petitioner is not the next meritorious\ncandidate insofar as the post of Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice SEBC Male is concerned, and there are SEBC Male\ncandidates who had given first preference for this post who are\nmore meritorious than this petitioner. In the impugned\njudgment, the learned Single Judge has not considered the\ncase of the petitioner separately, though the same stood on a\ndifferent footing, inasmuch as the said petitioner had not\nchallenged the revised merit list but had sought a direction to\nthe respondents to forthwith appoint him to the post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police Class I as SEBC Male candidate on the\nvacancy arising due to non-joining of one SEBC Male candidate\nMr. Vadhvana Rohikumar Rameshchandra. However, all the\npetitions have been decided by giving common directions to\nthe respondents to fill up the vacant posts by offering them to\nthe next meritorious candidates in the recruitment in question\nkeeping in mind the\nratio\nlaid down in\nD.G. Dalal. Therefore,\nstrictly speaking, it cannot be said that the petition has been\ndismissed or that the relief prayed for has been turned down. If\nthe petitioner was the next meritorious candidate insofar as\nthe post of Deputy Superintendent of Police SEBC Male is\nconcerned, in terms of the said directions, he would have been\nentitled to appointment to that post. Besides, it is the\nappellants who have filed this appeal challenging the order\npassed on this petition. If no relief had been granted to the\npetitioner, there was no question of the appellants herein\n\nPage 96 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbeing aggrieved so as to prefer an appeal against the order\npassed in the said petition. Therefore, the contention that\nunless there is an order passed in favour of the petitioner, he\ncannot file cross-objection does not merit acceptance. In this\nfactual background, it is not necessary to refer to the various\ndecisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the respective\nparties on the maintainability of the cross objection.\n\n78. Examining the case of this petitioner on merits, there are\ntwo impediments to the grant of relief prayed for by him:\n\nfirstly, that he is not the next meritorious candidate insofar as\nthe post of Deputy Superintendent of Police SEBC Male is\nconcerned; and secondly, sub-rule (4) of rule 9 of the Gujarat\nRules, provides that where a candidate fails to join the post\noffered to him, his name shall stand deleted from the list of\ncandidates recommended by the Commission for appointment.\n\n79. Insofar as the first issue is concerned, it has been\ncontended that the candidates who are placed above the\npetitioners on merit, have not approached this court and when\nit is the petitioner alone who has staked claim to such vacancy,\nit is he alone who should be considered; and in view of the\nclear vacancy, he should be given the appointment.\n\n80. Insofar as the candidates placed higher in merit than the\npetitioner who have not approached this court seeking any\nrelief are concerned, in the opinion of this court, the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner is justified in contending that no\nrelief can be granted to them.\nIn\nAshok v. State of\nKarnataka\n, (1992) 1 SCC 28, before the Supreme Court the\nK.S.C.S. (Direct Recruitment By Selection) Rules, 1973 were\n\nPage 97 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nchallenged on the ground that the percentage of marks for\nviva voce as 33.3% were excessive and in violation of the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court held that 50 marks\nfor interview out of 150 are clearly in violation of the judgment\nof that court in\nAshok Kumar Yadav v. State of Haryana\n, (\n1985)\n4 SCC 417, and Mohinder Sain Garg v. State of Punjab\n, (1991)\n1 SCC 662. The court after examining the record of the\nSelection Committee, found that a large number of candidates\nhad been selected though they had secured much lesser\nmarks than the appellants in the qualifying examination but\nhad secured very high marks in the viva voce out of 50 marks\nkept for this purpose. The court further found that it was an\nadmitted position that if the marks for interview were kept\neven at 15 per cent of the total marks and merit list was\nprepared accordingly, then both the appellants were bound to\nbe selected and a large number of selected candidates would\nhave gone much lower in the merit list than the appellants. In\nview of the fact that the result of the impugned selections was\ndeclared in 1987 and the selected candidates have already\njoined the posts, the court did not consider it just and proper to\nquash the selections on the above ground. The court held that\nhowever, the rules were clearly in violation of the dictum\nlaid\ndown by\nit in the above referred cases and in case the marks\nfor viva voce would have been kept say at 15 per cent of the\ntotal marks, the appellants before it were bound to be selected\non the basis of marks secured by them in interview, calculated\non the basis of converting the same to 15 per cent of the total\nmarks. Accordingly, the appeal came to be allowed with a\ndirection to the respondents to give appointments to the two\nappellants in case they are found suitable in all other respects\naccording to the rules. The learned counsel appearing on\n\nPage 98 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbehalf of the State of Karnataka pointed out that there are\nmany other candidates who had secured much higher marks\nthan the appellants in case the above criteria is applied for\nselection. The Supreme Court observed that in view of the fact\nthat appointments under the impugned rules were made as\nback as in 1987 and only the appellants therein had\napproached the Tribunal for relief, the case of other candidates\ncannot be considered as they never approached for redress\nwithin reasonable time. The court was thus inclined to grant\nrelief only to the appellants therein who were vigilant in\nmaking grievance and approaching the Tribunal in time.\n\n81. Thus, in the above judgment, the Supreme Court found\nthat admittedly if the marks secured by the appellants therein\nwere calculated in consonance with the decisions referred to\ntherein, both of them were bound to be selected. It is in this\nbackground that the relief came to be granted to those\nappellants. At the same time, the court confined the relief to\nthe appellants therein, despite the fact that there were more\nmeritorious candidates available on the ground that they had\nnever approached for redress within reasonable time.\n\n82. The above decision would be squarely applicable to the\nfacts of the present case, and accordingly, those candidates\nwho were more meritorious than the petitioner could not have\nbeen granted any relief as they had never approached for\nredress within reasonable time. At the same time, it may be\nnoted that\nin that case\n, the court found that both the\nappellants were bound to be selected if the principles\nlaid\ndown in\nthe earlier decisions had been followed, which is not\nso in the present case. The petitioner herein was not bound to\n\nPage 99 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nbe selected inasmuch as, there was one vacant post of Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police SEBC Male and there were several\ncandidates who were ranked higher in merit than him.\n\n83. Moreover, in this case, as averred in paragraph 3 of the\nmemorandum of petition, the petitioner was offered\nappointment as DILR (District Inspector of Land Records) Class-\nII by the Revenue Department by a notification dated 6.5.2011.\nHowever, the petitioner did not want to accept the said Class-II\npost and, therefore, he did not join the service as DILR Class-II.\nThe Revenue Department addressed a letter dated 19.5.2011\nto the petitioner informing him that if he would not join duty as\nDILR Class II on or before 31.5.2011, his appointment as such\nwould be cancelled. In response thereto, the petitioner\naddressed a letter dated 23.5.2011 stating that at the time of\noral interview when the preference was asked for, he had\ngiven preference only for the Class-I posts of (1) Dy. S.P., (2)\nDistrict Registrar and (3) Superintendent, Prohibition and\nExcise. The petitioner had not given preference for any post of\nClass-II. The petitioner had also requested that in the event of\nany vacancy in Class-I, the petitioner may be issued\nappointment order but he was not interested in appointment\nas DILR Class II.\n\n84. Thus, though offered a post, the petitioner failed to join\nthe same. Sub-rule (2)(b) of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules\nprovides that where a candidate has not given preference for\nany post, or the candidate has given preference only for a few\nposts, and the number of posts for which he has given\npreference are not available to accommodate the candidate as\nper his preference, such candidate shall be considered for\n\nPage 100 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nappointment to any of the remaining posts after the process of\nappointment of other candidates, who have given preference\nfor all the scheduled posts, is completed. Thus, though the\npetitioner had given preference for only Class-I posts, as no\npost of his preference was available, he was offered the post of\nDILR Class-II.\n\n85. Sub-rule (4) of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules provides that\nwhere a candidate fails to join the post offered to him, his\nname shall be deleted from the list of candidates\nrecommended by the Commission for appointment. Thus, by\noperation of sub-rule (4) of rule 9 of the Gujarat Rules, the\npetitioner, having failed to join the post offered to him, his\nname stood deleted from the list of candidates. Once his name\nstood deleted from the list of recommended candidates, even\notherwise the question of offering him appointment against\nany subsequent vacancy would not arise. Therefore, on both\ncounts, the cross objection must fail, namely, the petitioner not\nbeing the next meritorious candidate was not otherwise\nentitled to be appointed to the post; and apart from the fact\nthat the rules do not contemplate filling up vacancies arising\non account of non-joining of candidates, the name of the\npetitioner having been deleted from the list of recommended\ncandidates, the question of considering him for appointment\non any subsequent vacancy does not arise.\n\n86. In the light of the above discussion, the appeals succeed\nand are, accordingly, allowed. The impugned judgment and\norder passed by the learned Single Judge in the captioned\npetitions, is hereby quashed and set aside. Cross-Objection\nNo.82 of 2018 fails and is hereby dismissed.\n\nPage 101 of 102\n\nC/LPA/814/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n87. Before parting, it may be noted that admittedly the\nprinciples enunciated by the Supreme Court in Ramesh Ram\nand Rajesh Daria as followed in\nMamta Bisht\n(supra) are\nrequired to be followed by the State Government for the\npurpose of recruitment. However, under the existing rules the\nimplementation of such decisions gives rise to several\ndifficulties as is apparent from the complications that have\narisen in the present case, which also result in advertised posts\nbeing left vacant. Therefore, the State Government would be\nwell advised to amend the rules so as to obviate such\ndifficulties in future.\n\n88.
