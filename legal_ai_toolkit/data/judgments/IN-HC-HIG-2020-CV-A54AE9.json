And Another on 25 February, 2020\n\nAuthor:\nTarlok Singh Chauhan\n\nBench:\nTarlok Singh Chauhan\n\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA\n\nCWPOA No. 242 of 2019.\n\n.\nDecided on: 25.02.2020.\n\nSarita Sharma ...Petitioner\n\nVersus\nState of H.P. and another ..Respondents\n______________________________________________________\nCoram\n\nWhether approved for reporting ?1 No\nr to\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, Judge.\n\nFor the Petitioner : Mr. Prem P. Chauhan, Advocate.\n\nFor the Respondents : Mr. Ajay Vaidya, Senior Additional\nAdvocate General, with Mr. Vinod\n\nThakur, Mr. Desh Raj Thakur, Addl.\nAdvocate Generals, Mr. Bhupinder\nThakur and Mr. Narinder Thakur,\nDeputy Advocate Generals.\n\nTarlok Singh Chauhan, Judge (oral)\n\nThe moot question in this petition is whether the\n\nservices of an employee appointed on adhoc basis followed by\n\nregular appointment is to be counted for the purpose of\n\npensionary benefits.\n\n2. The facts are not in dispute. Pursuant to the interview\n\nheld by the duly constituted Selection Committee on 25.6.1983,\nWhether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the Judgment ? Yes\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nthe petitioner came to be appointed as Trained Graduate Teacher\n\n(for short 'TGT) and joined as such on 17.04.1985. Thereafter her\n\n.\n\nservices came to be regularised only on 23.08.1994 despite her\n\nappointment having been made against a sanctioned post.\nIn the\n\ninterregnum, some of the aggrieved persons whose adhoc\n\nservices were not counted for the purpose of regularisation\n\napproached this Court by way of CWP No. 372 of 1985 titled as\n\nSurinder Kumar and others vs. State of H.P. and another\n,\n\nwherein this Court on 04.03.1986 passed the following directions:\n\n\"4. The petitioners have claimed that the period of adhoc\nservice rendered by them should be tagged on to their regular\nservice in case of regularisation of their services for the\n\npurposes of seniority, fixation of pay etc. The Court does not\npropose to issue any directions on this question at the present\n\nstage. Such of the adhoc teachers, whose services may be\nregularised, including the petitioners, will be at liberty to make\n\nrepresentation(s) to the State Government in regard to this\nmatter within a period of four weeks from the date of\n\nregularisation. The representation(s), if and when made, shall\nbe entertained and decided in accordance with law within a\nperiod of eight weeks thereafter. If the concerned persons are\naggrieved by the decision, they would be at liberty to move the\nCourt again.\"\n\n3. In compliance to the above directions, the\n\nrespondents acceded to the request of the petitioners therein and\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\ndirected the counting of the adhoc services rendered by the\n\npetitioners therein for all purposes. However, the benefit of this\n\n.\n\ndecision was only confined to the petitioners in CWP No. 372 of\n\n1985 and not to the other similarly situated persons, constraining\n\nthe petitioner to file the instant petition for the grant of following\n\nsubstantive reliefs:\n\n(a) To issue a writ of mandamus, appropriate writ, order or\ndirection in nature thereof, directing the respondent\ndepartment to grant the benefits of entire adhoc service\n\nrendered by the petitioner towards her seniority for all purpose\n\nand intents, including for grant of proficiency step ups,\nAssured Career Progression Scheme benefits and all other\nconsequential benefits flowing thereof with arrears and interest\n\nthereon @ 18% p.a.\n\n(b) To issue an appropriate writ, order or direction in nature\nthereof to give full justice to the petitioner in the circumstances\n\nof the case and may pass such further writ, order or orders as\nthis Hon'ble Court may deem fit, proper, just and expedient in\n\nthe circumstances of the case.\"\n\n4. The only ground taken by the respondents to oppose\n\nthe claim of the petitioner is that the adhoc services rendered by\n\nthe petitioner without break followed by regular appointment is to\n\nbe counted towards increments on notional basis and not for\n\nassigning seniority. Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled for the\n\ngrant of benefits of adhoc services rendered by her towards her\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nseniority for all intents including for the grant of proficiency step\n\nup, Assured Career Progression Scheme benefits etc. and the\n\n.\n\npetitioner will be entitled for seniority and pay fixation only from\n\nthe date of regular appointment.\n\n5. The basis for making such averments have not been\n\nset-out in the reply nor could orally explained by the respondents\n\nduring the course of arguments.\n\n6.\nIn fact, the issue posed in this petition is no longer\n\nres integra in view of the decision rendered by learned Single\n\nJudge of this Court in\nParas Ram vs. State of Himachal\n\nPradesh and others\n, Latest HLJ 2009 (HP) 887 wherein it was\n\nlaid down that if adhoc service is followed by regular service in\n\nthe same post, the said service can be counted for the purpose of\n\nincrements.\n\n7. Further a Division Bench of this Court in LPA No. 36\n\nof 2010 titled\nSita Ram vs. State of H.P. and others\n, decided on\n\n15.7.2010 after placing reliance upon\nParas Ram\n's case (supra)\n\nheld that \"It is also settled principle of law that any service that is\n\ncounted for the purpose of increment, will count for pension also.\n\nTo that extent the appellant is justified in making submission that\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nperiod may be treated as qualifying service for the purpose of\n\npension also.\"\n\n.\n\n8. Adverting to the facts of the case, I have no difficulty\n\nin concluding that even though the appointment of the petitioner\n\nwas on adhoc basis but that was in no manner qualitatively\n\ndifferent from the regular employees and particularly when there\n\nwas a vacancy and need for the services of the petitioner and she\n\nwas ultimately regularized. Once that be so, then obviously it was\n\nunfair on the part of the respondents to take work from the\n\npetitioner on adhoc basis. They ought to have resorted to an\n\nappointment on regular basis.\n\n9. The taking of work on adhoc basis for long amounts\n\nto adopting the exploitative device. Later on, though the services\n\nof the petitioner have been regularized, however, the period spent\n\nby her on adhoc basis, has not been counted towards the\n\nqualifying service. Thus, the respondents have not only deprived\n\nthe petitioner from the due emoluments during the period she\n\nserved on less salary on adhoc basis but she was also deprived\n\nof counting of the period for pensionary benefits.\n\n10. The respondents have been benefitted by the\n\nservices rendered by the petitioner in the heydays of her life on\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nless salary on adhoc basis. Therefore, there is no rhyme or\n\nreason not to count the adhoc period in case it has been\n\n.\n\nrendered before regularization. If the same is denied, it would be\n\nhighly unjust, impermissible and irrational to deprive such\n\nemployees benefit of the qualifying service.\n\n11. The classification cannot be done on the irrational\n\nbasis and when the respondents are themselves counting period\n\nspent in such service, it would be highly discriminatory not to\n\ncount the service on the basis of flimsy classification. As it would\n\nrather be unjust, illegal, impermissible to make the aforesaid\n\nclassification under the Pension Rules and to make Rule valid\n\nand non-discriminatory, the same will have to be read down and\n\nit has to be held that services rendered even prior to\n\nregularisation in the capacity of adhoc shall have to be counted\n\ntowards the qualifying service even if such service is not\n\npreceded by temporary or regular appointment in a pensionable\n\nestablishment.\n\n12.\nIn a recent decision rendered by three Judges of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nPrem Singh vs. State of Uttar\n\nPradesh and others\nAIR 2019 SC 4390, it was held that the\n\nservices rendered on contract basis followed by regular\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nappointment have to be counted towards qualifying service for the\n\npurpose of pension. It shall be apposite to refer to the\n\n.\n\nobservations made in paras 28 to 34 of the judgment, which read\n\nas under:\n\n\"28. The submission has been urged on behalf of the State\nof Uttar Pradesh to differentiate the case between work-\ncharged employees and regular employees on the ground\n\nthat due procedure is not followed for appointment of work\ncharged employees, they do not have that much work\npressure, they are unequal and cannot be treated equally,\n\nwork- charged employees form a totally different class, their\n\nwork is materially and qualitatively different, there cannot be\nany clubbing of the services of the work-charged employees\nwith the regular service and vice versa, if a work-charged\n\nemployee is treated as in the regular service it will dilute the\nbasic concept of giving incentive and reward to a permanent\n\nand responsible regular employee.\n\n29. We are not impressed by the aforesaid submissions.\n\nThe appointment of the work-charged employee in question\nhad been made on monthly salary and they were required to\n\ncross the efficiency bar also. How their services are\nqualitatively different from regular employees? No material\nindicating qualitative difference has been pointed out except\nmaking bald statement. The appointment was not made for a\nparticular project which is the basic concept of the work\ncharged employees. Rather, the very concept of work-\ncharged employment has been misused by offering the\nemployment on exploitative terms for the work which is\nregular and perennial in nature. The work-charged employees\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nhad been subjected to transfer from one place to another like\nregular employees as apparent from documents placed on\nrecord.\nIn\nNarain Dutt Sharma & Ors. v. State of Uttar\n\n.\n\nPradesh & Ors. (CA No. 2019 @ SLP (C) No.5775 of 2018)\n\nthe appellants were allowed to cross efficiency bar, after '8'\nyears of continuous service, even during the period of work-\n\ncharged services. Narain Dutt Sharma, the appellant, was\nappointed as a work-charged employee as Gej Mapak w.e.f\n15.9.1978. Payment used to be made monthly but the\n\nappointment was made in the pay scale of Rs.200- 320.\nInitially, he was appointed in the year 1978 on a fixed monthly\nsalary of Rs.205 per month. They were allowed to cross\nefficiency bar also as the benefit of pay scale was granted to\n\nthem during the period they served as work-charged\n\nemployees they served for three to four decades and later on\nservices have been regularized time to time by different\norders. However, the services of some of the appellants in\n\nfew petitions/ appeals have not been regularized even though\nthey had served for several decades and ultimately reached\n\nthe age of superannuation.\n\n30. In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it was unfair\n\non the part of the State Government and its officials to take\nwork from the employees on the work-charged basis. They\n\nought to have resorted to an appointment on regular basis.\nThe taking of work on the work- charged basis for long\namounts to adopting the exploitative device. Later on, though\ntheir services have been regularized. However, the period\nspent by them in the work-charged establishment has not\nbeen counted towards the qualifying service. Thus, they have\nnot only been deprived of their due emoluments during the\nperiod they served on less salary in work charged\nestablishment but have also been deprived of counting of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nperiod for pensionary benefits as if no services had been\nrendered by them. The State has been benefitted by the\nservices rendered by them in the heydays of their life on less\n\n.\n\nsalary in work- charged establishment.\n\n31. In view of the note appended to Rule 3(8) of the 1961\nRules, there is a provision to count service spent on work\n\ncharged, contingencies or non pensionable service, in case, a\nperson has rendered such service in a given between period\nof two temporary appointments in the pensionable\n\nestablishment or has rendered such service in the\ninterregnum two periods of temporary and permanent\nemployment. The work-charged service can be counted as\nqualifying service for pension in the aforesaid exigencies.\n\n32. The question arises whether the imposition of rider that\n\nsuch service to be counted has to be rendered in-between\ntwo spells of temporary or temporary and permanent service\nis legal and proper. We find that once regularization had been\n\nmade on vacant posts, though the employee had not served\nprior to that on temporary basis, considering the nature of\n\nappointment, though it was not a regular appointment it was\nmade on monthly salary and thereafter in the pay scale of\n\nwork-charged establishment the efficiency bar was permitted\nto be crossed. It would be highly discriminatory and irrational\n\nbecause of the rider contained in Note to Rule 3(8) of 1961\nRules, not to count such service particularly, when it can be\ncounted, in case such service is sandwiched between two\ntemporary or in-between temporary and permanent services.\nThere is no rhyme or reason not to count the service of work-\ncharged period in case it has been rendered before\nregularisation. In our opinion, an impermissible classification\nhas been made under Rule 3(8). It would be highly unjust,\nimpermissible and irrational to deprive such employees\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nbenefit of the qualifying service. Service of work-charged\nperiod remains the same for all the employees, once it is to\nbe counted for one class, it has to be counted for all to\n\n.\n\nprevent discrimination. The classification cannot be done on\n\nthe irrational basis and when respondents are themselves\ncounting period spent in such service, it would be highly\n\ndiscriminatory not to count the service on the basis of flimsy\nclassification. The rider put on that work-charged service\nshould have preceded by temporary capacity is discriminatory\n\nand irrational and creates an impermissible classification.\n\n33. As it would be unjust, illegal and impermissible to make\naforesaid classification to make the Rule 3(8) valid and non\ndiscriminatory, we have to read down the provisions of Rule\n\n3(8) and hold that services rendered even prior to\n\nregularisation in the capacity of work-charged employees,\ncontingency paid fund employees or non- pensionable\nestablishment shall also be counted towards the qualifying\n\nservice even if such service is not preceded by temporary or\nregular appointment in a pensionable establishment.\n\n34. In view of the note appended to Rule 3(8), which we\nhave read down, the provision contained in Regulation 370 of\n\nthe Civil Services Regulations has to be struck down as also\nthe instructions contained in Para 669 of the Financial\n\nHandbook.\"\n\n13. It would be clearly evident from the aforesaid\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the services\n\nrendered prior to regularisation in any capacity be it work-charged\n\nemployees, contingency paid fund employees or non-pensionable\n\nestablishment or adhoc has to be counted towards qualifying\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nservice even if such service is not preceded by temporary or\n\nregular appointment in a pensionable establishment.\n\n.\n\n14. Once that be so, obviously no discrimination can be\n\nmade qua the employees, who rendered services prior to\n\nregularisation in the capacity of adhoc employees.\n\n15. Similar reiteration of law can be found in a judgment\n\nrendered by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in CWP No.3267 of\n\n2019, titled Ram Krishan Sharma vs. The Accountant General\n\n(A&E), HP and Ors., decided on 01.01.2020 and a very recent\n\njudgment rendered by this Court in CWP No. 537 of 2018, titled\n\nKedar Singh Negi vs. H.P. High\nCourt and others, decided on\n\n07.01.2020.\n\n16. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I find merit in this\n\npetition and the same is accordingly allowed. The respondents\n\nare directed to grant the benefit of entire adhoc service rendered\n\nby the petitioner towards her seniority for all intents and purposes\n\nincluding grant of proficiency step-up, Assured Career\n\nProgression Scheme benefits and all other consequential benefits\n\nflowing thereof within a period of three months from today, failing\n\nwhich, the respondents shall be liable to pay an interest of 9%\n\n::: Downloaded on - 26/02/2020 20:23:44 :::HCHP\nper annum, which initially shall be paid by the department, to be\n\nrecovered from the erring official(s).\n\n.\n\n17.
