Appellants\n\nv.\n\nSamyut Kshetriya Gramin Bank & Ors. ... Respondents\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nR.V.RAVEENDRAN, J.\n\nThe appellants are employees of the first respondent Bank, having\n\nbeen appointed between 1979 and 1982. By notification dated 28.9.1988,\n\nthe Central Government in exercise of powers conferred under section 17\n\nread with section 29 of the Provincial Rural Banks Act, 1976 framed the\n\n\"Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of Officers and\n\nOther Employees) Rules, 1988 (`Rules' for short). Rule 5 of the Rules\n\nprovided that all vacancies should be filled up by deputation, promotion\n\nor direct recruitment, in accordance with provisions contained in the\n\nSecond Schedule to the Rules. Entry 7 in the Second Schedule related to\n\nrecruitment to the posts of Area Manager or Senior Manager (in Scale II).\nIt provided that all the posts of Area Managers and Senior Managers\n\nshould be filled by promotion from among the confirmed officers (in\n\nScale I) working in the bank on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. It\n\nprescribed the educational qualification (graduate) and minimum period\n\nof service in the feeder cadre (eight years as an officer in the concerned\n\nregional rural bank). It also prescribed the mode of selection by\n\npromotion as \"Interview and assessment of performance reports for the\n\npreceding three years period as officers\". Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 10\n\nprovided that the Staff Selection Committee shall follow the procedure\n\ndetermined by the Board for selecting candidates for appointment or\n\npromotion, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central\n\nGovernment from time to time.\n\n2. At the 131st meeting of the Board of Directors of the first\n\nrespondent bank held on 29.11.1996, the following procedure for\n\npromotion of officers from scale I to scale II was approved :\n\n\"After considering the guidelines contained in the Government of\nIndia's letter dated 23rd September, 1988 and the Letter no. 823 dated\n7th October, 1996 of the National Bank, the Board passed a\nresolution that 60 points be earmarked on the basis of work done\nduring the previous three years in the Selection procedure for\npromotion on the Scale II posts and 40 points be given for interview\nand in this manner the promotion procedure should be completed.\nAlso, an information in this behalf be given to the National Bank.\"\nIn pursuance of the above, the eligible candidates (officers Scale I),\n\nincluding appellants were considered and interviewed on 16.12.1996 and\n\n17.12.1996 and a select list was published on 20.12.1996 promoting 64\n\nofficers (respondents 4 to 67) from scale I to scale II with effect from\n\n20.12.1996.\n\n3. Appellants 1 to 7 were not selected. Many who were selected, were\n\ntheir juniors. The appellants allege that their service and conduct were\n\ngood and there were no adverse entries against them and therefore, they\n\nought to have been promoted from Officer scale I to scale II. They\n\ntherefore filed a writ petition before the Allahabad High Court (WP\n\nNo.3151/1997), for quashing the entire promotion process of the first\n\nrespondent bank from scale I to scale II culminating in the order dated\n\n20.12.1996 and for a direction to the first respondent bank to undertake\n\nthe promotion process afresh. The appellants also sought quashing of the\n\nresolution of the Board of Directors dated 29.11.1996 prescribing the\n\npromotion procedure.\n\n4. The respondent bank resisted the said petition by filing a counter\n\ndefending the promotions. During arguments, the High Court secured the\n\noriginal records from the bank to ascertain the procedure followed by the\nbank in the selection. The High Court also directed that the relevant\n\ndocuments be brought on record. Accordingly, the relevant documents\n\nwere filed by the Bank with an additional affidavit, wherein the Bank\n\ndescribed the selection procedure followed by it, as follows :\n\n\"That when the proposal for promotion came before the Board, the\ndepartment of personnel under the direction of the Chairman\nprepared complete summary giving the past history and the\nproposals for selection procedure. A thick booklet was prepared and\nin chapter V of the same the details for the procedure for selection\nwere given. This book was part of the agenda put before the Board\nof Directors in its meeting of 23.9.1996 in which the process was\napproved with certain modification. A copy of the proceedings of the\nBoard meeting is Annexure A to this affidavit.\n\nThat the whole matter has to be again presented before the Board in\nits meeting dt. 29.11.96, as in the meantime a letter was received\nfrom NABARD giving certain directions. The Board in this meeting\nadopted the process given in chapter V with certain modifications in\nthe process as desired in the letter of the NABARD dated 7.10.1996\nis Annexure B to this affidavit and a copy of the NABARD letter\ndated 7.10.1996 is Annexure C to this affidavit.\n\nThat the Chapter V of the Booklet which has been approved by the\nBoard with modifications is also being filed as Annexure D to this\naffidavit.\n\nThat in the end of chapter V it is provided that the qualifying marks\nwill be 78% and those who will secure 78% or above would be\neligible for promotion.\n\nThat the selection Committee put these marks obtained on the\nseniority list and according to seniority those who were found\neligible they have been promoted. This was done in accordance with\nthe principle of seniority cum merit. As such there is nothing wrong\nin following this procedure.\n\nThat none of those petitioners could secure 78% marks and hence\nthey were not selected.\"\nThe High Court, after considering the material made available and\n\nrespective contentions, passed the impugned order dated 4.7.2001,\n\nwhereby it upheld the process of selection. It held that the two stage\n\nprocess adopted by the bank - the first preparing a list of candidates who\n\nsecured the minimum of 78 marks (aggregate) in the performance\n\nappraisal and interview, and the second promoting the candidates who\n\nsecured the minimum marks, strictly on the basis of seniority - satisfied\n\nthe seniority-cum-merit criteria for promotion. The said decision is\n\nchallenged in this appeal by special leave.\n\n5. It is contended by the appellants that the concept of promotion by\n\nseniority-cum-merit, did not contemplate prescribing of minimum\n\nqualifying marks for assessment of performance/interview, before\n\napplying the principle of seniority for promotion. It is contended that\n\nrestricting the promotion to only those who secured the minimum\n\nqualifying marks, was violative of the seniority-cum-merit principle. It is\n\nfurther contended that even if any qualifying marks could be prescribed\n\nfor assessing the minimum necessary merit required to meet the\n\nefficiency of administration, the fixation of an extremely high mark of 78\n\nout of 100 as qualifying marks, had the effect of converting the criteria of\npromotion from seniority-cum-merit to merit-cum-seniority. The\n\nappellants placed strong reliance on the decisions of this Court in\nB.V.\n\nSivaiah v. K. Addanki Babu\n[1998 (\n6) SCC 720] and Bhagwandas Tiwari\n\nv. Dewas Shajapur Kshetriya Gramin Bank\n[2006 (12) SCC 574] in\n\nsupport of their contentions.\n\n6. On the contentions urged, the following two questions arise for our\n\nconsideration :\n\n(i) Whether minimum qualifying marks could be prescribed for\nassessment of past performance and interview, where the\npromotions are to be made on the principle of seniority-cum-merit?\n\n(ii) Whether the first respondent bank was justified in fixing a high\npercentage (78%) as the minimum qualifying marks (minimum\nmerit) for promotion?\n\nRe : Question (i)\n\n7.\nIn\nState of Kerala vs. N. M. Thomas\n- 1976 (6) SCC 310, a seven-\n\nJudge Bench of this Court defined the concept of `seniority-cum-merit'.\n\nThis Court held that \"seniority-cum-merit\" means that given the\n\nminimum necessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration, the\n\nsenior though the less meritorious shall have priority.\"\n\nIn\nUnion of India\n\nvs. Lt. Gen. Rajendra Singh Kadyan\n- 2000 (6) SCC 698, this Court\nobserved that \"seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the requirement of certain\n\nminimum merit or satisfying a benchmark previously fixed, and subject\n\nto fulfilling the said requirement, the promotion is based on seniority. It\n\nwas pointed out that requirement of assessment of comparative merit was\n\nabsent in the case of `seniority-cum-merit'.\n\n8. It is also well settled that the principle of seniority-cum-merit, for\n\npromotion, is different from the principle of `seniority' and principle of\n\n`merit-cum-seniority'. Where promotion is on the basis of seniority alone,\n\nmerit will not play any part at all. But where promotion is on the principle\n\nof seniority-cum-merit, promotion is not automatic with reference to\n\nseniority alone. Merit will also play a significant role. The standard\n\nmethod of seniority-cum-merit is to subject all the eligible candidates in\n\nthe feeder grade (possessing the prescribed educational qualification and\n\nperiod of service) to a process of assessment of a specified minimum\n\nnecessary merit and then promote the candidates who are found to\n\npossess the minimum necessary merit strictly in the order of seniority.\n\nThe minimum merit necessary for the post may be assessed either by\n\nsubjecting the candidates to a written examination or an interview or by\n\nassessment of their work performance during the previous\nyears, or by a combination of either two or all the three of the aforesaid\n\nmethods. There is no hard and fast rule as to how the minimum merit is to\n\nbe ascertained. So long as the ultimate promotions are based on seniority,\n\nany process for ascertaining the minimum necessary merit, as a basic\n\nrequirement, will not militate against the principle of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit.\n\n9.\nIn\nSivaiah\n(supra), a three-Judge bench of this Court held that\n\nwhile the principle of seniority-cum-merit laid greater emphasis on\n\nseniority, the principle of merit-cum-seniority laid greater emphasis on\n\nmerit and ability, with seniority playing a less significant role. This Court\n\nheld :\n\n\"We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criteria of \"seniority-cum-\nmerit\" in the matter of promotion postulates that given the minimum\nnecessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration, the senior,\neven though less meritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made. For assessing the\nminimum necessary merit, the competent authority can lay down the\nminimum standard that is required and also prescribe the mode of\nassessment of merit of the employee who is eligible for\nconsideration for promotion. Such assessment can be made by\nassigning marks on the basis of appraisal of performance on the basis\nof service record and interview and prescribing the minimum marks\nwhich would entitle a person to be promoted on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit.\"\n10. Thus it is clear that a process whereby eligible candidates\n\npossessing the minimum necessary merit in the feeder posts is first\n\nascertained and thereafter, promotions are made strictly in accordance\n\nwith seniority, from among those who possess the minimum necessary\n\nmerit is recognised and accepted as complying with the principle of\n\n`seniority-cum-merit'. What would offend the rule of seniority-cum-merit\n\nis a process where after assessing the minimum necessary merit,\n\npromotions are made on the basis of merit (instead of seniority) from\n\namong the candidates possessing the minimum necessary merit. If the\n\ncriteria adopted for assessment of minimum necessary merit is bona fide\n\nand not unreasonable, it is not open to challenge, as being opposed to the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit. We accordingly hold that prescribing\n\nminimum qualifying marks to ascertain the minimum merit necessary for\n\ndischarging the functions of the higher post, is not violative of the\n\nconcept of promotion by seniority-cum-merit.\n\nRe : Question (ii)\n\n11. The next question is whether fixing of 78% as minimum qualifying\n\nmarks (that is as the minimum necessary merit) is unreasonable and\n\narbitrary. The Rules in this case provide that the mode of selection is by\ninterview and assessment of performance reports for the preceding three\n\nyears as officer Scale I. The seniority list of officers in scale I was\n\npublished on 4.12.1996. Thereafter, the promotion process was held by\n\nearmarking 60 marks for assessment of performance Reports (at the rate\n\nof 20 marks per year) and 40 marks were allotted for interview. The\n\nofficers possessing the minimum qualifying marks of 78%, were then\n\npromoted on the basis of seniority. What should be the minimum\n\nnecessary merit for promotion, is a matter that is decided by the\n\nmanagement, having in mind the requirements of the post to which\n\npromotions are to be made. The employer has the discretion to fix\n\ndifferent minimum merit, for different categories of posts, subject to the\n\nrelevant Rules.\nFor example, for promotions at lower levels, it may fix a\n\nlesser minimum qualifying marks and fix a comparatively higher\n\nminimum qualifying marks for higher posts. In the first respondent Bank,\n\nthe post of officer-Grade II (Area Managers and Senior Managers) is a\n\nvery senior position, next only to the top post of General Manager. As the\n\nofficers promoted to Scale II were required to head larger branches or\n\ndepartments in the Head Office, shouldering higher responsibilities and\n\nvirtually competing with commercial banks, it cannot be said that the\n\nfixing the minimum qualifying marks at 78% is excessive, unreasonable\nor arbitrary. We may refer to the following observations of this Court in\n\nK. Samantaray vs. National Insurance Col\n. Ltd. - AIR 2003 SCC 4422,\n\nin this context :\n\n\"It is for the employer to stipulate the criteria for promotion, the\nsame pertaining really to the area of policy-making. It was, therefore,\npermissible for the respondent to have their own criteria for\nadjudging claims on the principle of seniority-cum-merit giving\nprimacy to merit as well, depending upon the class, category and\nnature of posts in the hierarchy of administration and the\nrequirements of efficiency for such posts.\"\n\n12. Another aspect requires to be noticed. Where the assessment of\n\nminimum merit is with reference to previous performance record (Annual\n\nConfidential Records) and/or by interview, as contrasted from a written\n\nexamination, prescription of 78% as minimum, will not be considered as\n\nunreasonably high.\n\n13.\nIn\nSivaih\n(supra), this Court held that prescribing a minimum of 50\n\nmarks out of 100 for interview was not violative of the principle of\n\nseniority. This Court held :\n\n\"During the course of hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for\nthe respondent-Bank has placed before us the relevant documents\nrelating to the impugned selection and promotion. On a perusal of\nthe said documents, we find that 50 marks out of the total of 100\nmarks were prescribed as the minimum qualifying marks for\ninterview and only those who had obtained the qualifying marks in\ninterview were selected for promotion on the basis of seniority. It\nwas, therefore, a case where a minimum standard was prescribed for\nassessing the merit of the candidates and those who fulfilled the said\nminimum standard were selected for promotion on the basis of\nseniority. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the selection\nhas not been made in accordance with the principle of \"seniority-\ncum-merit.\"\n\nWhether the guidelines/rules adopted for assessing the minimum\n\nnecessary merit by prescribing marks under several heads or by\n\nprescribing a specific minimum mark, is reasonable or arbitrary, would\n\ndepend upon the facts of each case. If it is demonstrated that the\n\nminimum marks were fixed with the intention of favouring someone or to\n\nspecifically exclude someone, the courts may interfere. Similarly, where\n\nthe minimum marks are shown to have been fixed to defeat or nullify the\n\nmode of seniority-cum-merit for promotion, there may be a cause for\n\ninterference. In other cases, there is very little scope to interfere with the\n\nprocedure adopted to ascertain the minimum required merit.\n\n14.\nIn\nBhagwandas Tiwari\n(supra), this Court reiterated the principle\n\nlaid down in\n\nSivaiah\n(supra) and\nState of UP vs. Jalal Uddin\n(2005 (1)\n\nSCC 169] that principles of seniority-cum-merit and merit-cum-seniority\n\nare conceptually different and that in seniority-cum-merit greater\n\nemphasis is on seniority though it may not be the only determinative\nfactor. It then held on the facts of that case, that the method adopted\n\ntherein fixing 75% as minimum marks, violated the principle of seniority-\n\ncum-merit. Reliance is placed by the appellants on the following\n\nobservations of this Court:\n\n\"The contention that minimum marks were 45 out of 60, means that\nan employee is to secure 75% of marks. Such a high percentage\ncannot be a measure for prescribing minimum marks to assess merit.\nIt obviously would be a case of shifting the focus to merit-cum-\nseniority principle. It obviously would be a case of shifting the focus\nto merit-cum-seniority principle.\nIn para 37 of\nSivaiah\ncase, this\nCourt noted that minimum marks prescribed for assessing merit do\nnot depart from the seniority-cum-merit principle. But the factual\nposition is different here. There is no mention that 45 marks out of\n60 relate to the prescription of minimum marks for assessing the\nmerit.\"\n\nThe appellants contend that the Rules considered in Bhagwandas Tiwari\n\nand in this case are the same and therefore, the effect of the decision in\n\nBhagwandas Tiwari is that wherever minimum qualifying marks is fixed\n\nas 75% or more, the seniority-cum-merit rule would be violated.\n\n15. We have carefully examined the decision in Bhagwandas Tiwari.\n\nEven if the Rules applicable and mode of selection prescribed (\"interview\n\nand assessment of performance for the preceding three years period as\n\nofficers for promotion\") are the same in both cases, the criteria and\n\nstandards adopted for assessing the minimum necessary merit are\ncompletely different. We extract below the standards adopted for\n\npromotion in this case and in Bhagwandas Tiwari :\n\n\"Standards adopted in this case Marks allotted\n\n(i) Work performance during the previous years 60\n\n(ii) Interview 40\n\n--------------\n\nTotal 100\n\n=========\n\nThe minimum marks for eligibility for promotion : 78%.\n\nStandards adopted in the case of Bhagwandas :\n\n(a) Work performance during the previous 3 years 30\n\n(b) Period of service (at the rate of 2 marks per year 40\nFor competed period of service subject to a\nMaximum of 40)\n\n(c) Interview 30\n\n--------------\n\nTotal 100\n\n========\n\nIn order be selected for promotion, obtaining 45 marks shall be\ncompulsory\"\n\nIt would thus be seen that the schemes for assessing minimum necessary\n\nmarks are completely different in the two cases. While work performance\n\ncarried only 30 marks in\nBhagwandas\n's case, it carried 60 marks in this\n\ncase.\n\nWhile period of service carried 40 marks in\nBhagwandas\n's case, no\n\nmarks are provided for `period of service' in this case.\n\nWhile the marks\n\nfor interview were 30 in\nBhagwandas\n's case, it is 40 in this case. The\nminimum qualifying marks was 78 out of 100 in this case. In\n\nBhagwandas, the minimum qualifying marks prescribed was 45 marks\n\nout of 100. But ignoring the requirement of 45 out of 100, the selection\n\nCommittee adopted a minimum of 45 out of 60 (that is aggregate of\n\nmarks for work performance and Interview only) ignoring the marks\n\nof 40 for period of service though that was the highest segment. This\n\nCourt was persuaded to interfere\nin that case\n, as the guidelines which\n\nprescribed the minimum qualifying marks as 45 out of 100 was ignored\n\nand the committee changed the minimum qualifying marks to 45 out of\n\n60, thereby ignoring the marks secured for the period of service. Thus,\n\nthe decision in Bhagwandas Tiwari will not assist the appellants.\n\n14. We therefore find no merit in this appeal and it is accordingly\n\ndismissed.\n\n...........................J.\n(R V Raveendran)\n\nNew Delhi; ..........................J.\nNovember 17, 2009. (P.
