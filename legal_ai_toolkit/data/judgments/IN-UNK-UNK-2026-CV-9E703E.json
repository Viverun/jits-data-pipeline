The question involved is whether the respondent­employees are\n\n entitled to pension on completion of 15 years of service as per the\n\n State Bank of India Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for short, “the VRS\n\n framed in 2000”).\n\n 2. The matter has been referred to larger Bench due to conflict of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\n opinion between the Judges as to the admissibility of pension under\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nNARENDRA PRASAD\n\nDate: 2020.03.02\n\n16:52:03 IST\n\nReason:\n\n the VRS.\n\n\f 2\n\n3. After obtaining approval of the Government of India, the Indian\n\nBank Association (IBA) evolved a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The\n\nCentral Board of Directors of the State Bank of India (in short ‘the\n\nSBI’) adopted and approved the scheme in its meeting held on\n\n27.12.2000 for implementing the VRS for the employees of the bank\n\nby retiring them on completion of 15 years of service with the benefit\n\nprovided in the scheme. The scheme had been drawn up, keeping in\n\nview the guidelines issued by the IBA. “Memorandum” dated\n\n26.12.2000 was submitted by the Deputy Managing Director and the\n\nCorporate Development Officer for according approval to the proposals\n\ncontained in the Memorandum as also for adopting the scheme as\n\nAnnexure ‘B’ to the Memorandum.\n\n4. The basis of Memorandum dated 26.12.2000, was the advice by\n\nIBA vide letter dated 31.8.2000 in which it was pointed out that they\n\ndeliberated with the Government of India, Ministry of Finance\n\n(Banking Division), at its meeting with the Finance Minister, with\n\nChief Executives of public sector banks on 13.6.2000. The human\n\nresource and manpower planning in public sector banks were\n\nreviewed, and a Committee was constituted to examine the issues\n\nconcerned to public sector banks and to suggest suitable remedial\n\nmeasures. The Committee considered the economic reforms set in\n\n\f 3\n\nmotion in the year 1990, the high establishment cost and low\n\nproductivity in public sector banks. It was felt that the banks convert\n\ntheir human resource into assets compatible with the business\n\nstrategies through a variety of measures. The data available indicated\n\nthat 43% of the employees in public sector banks were in the 46 + age\n\ngroup, and only 12% were in the 25­35 age group. It was felt that this\n\npattern has severe implications for the banks regarding mobility,\n\ntraining, development of skills, and succession plans for higher­level\n\npositions. The workforce was in excess. In order to remedy the\n\nsituation, the Committee placed before the Government two schemes,\n\nviz., Sabbatical Leave, and a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The IBA\n\nvide letter dated 13.7.2000 sought no objection from the Government\n\nfor circulating the schemes to the banks for consideration and\n\nadoption by their Boards. The Government conveyed on 29.8.2000\n\nthat it did not have any objection for adopting and implementing the\n\nscheme by the respective Board of Directors. It advised that the banks\n\nmay adopt these schemes for sabbatical leave and voluntary\n\nretirement based on the essential features of the schemes given in the\n\nannexure to the letter. The scheme provided eligibility for all\n\npermanent employees with 15 years of service. It provided for amount\n\nof ex gratia and other benefits accepted by the Government of India\n\nwhich were to be provided (i) gratuity as per the \nGratuity Act\n/service\n\n\f 4\n\ngratuity, as the case may be; (ii) pension (including commuted value of\n\npension)/bank’s contribution towards provident fund; and (iii) leave\n\nencashment as per rules.\n\n5. After the Central Board of SBI approved the proposals contained\n\nin the memorandum on 27.12.2000, a circular was issued on\n\n29.12.2000 in which it was mentioned that the IBA advised that as the\n\nCommittee constituted by the Finance Ministry recommended\n\nintroduction of a VRS in order to rationalise the manpower, the\n\nGovernment of India has no objection for adopting and implementing\n\nthe VRS. It was clearly stated in the Circular dated 29.12.2000 that\n\nthe Central Board of Directors accorded approval for adopting and\n\nimplementing the SBI voluntary Retirement Scheme drawn up,\n\n“keeping in view the guidelines issued by the IBA.\" Copy of the scheme\n\nwas placed as Annexure B. The scheme was open from 15.1.2001 till\n\n31.1.2001. Specimen applications and other related forms inter alia for\n\npension were also circulated, which formed part of the circular. The\n\ncircular also made it clear that gratuity, provident fund contribution\n\nas per the Provident Fund Rules, pension in terms of the SBI\n\nEmployees’ Pension Fund Rules, leave encashment to be provided\n\nbeside the amount of ex gratia.\n\n\f 5\n\n6. The heart and soul of the scheme were that benefits to be given\n\non completion of 15 years of service. The eligibility for benefits was\n\nprovided to those who had completed 15 years of service as on\n\n31.12.2000.\n\n7. The SBI submitted that it reserved a right under the scheme to\n\nmodify, amend or cancel it or any of the clauses and to give effect to it\n\nfrom any date deemed fit. The Deputy Managing Director­cum­CDO\n\nwas the competent authority for the purpose. As specific queries were\n\nraised, a clarification was issued by the Deputy Managing Director on\n\n15.1.2001, in which about a query whether an employee on\n\ncompleting 15 years of pensionable service as on the relevant date of\n\nretirement, would be entitled to pensionary benefits, in response, para\n\n6(c) of the scheme was reiterated, and it was also mentioned that as\n\nper the existing rules, employees who had not completed 20 years of\n\npensionable service, were not eligible for pension.\n\n8. The clarification issued by the Deputy General Manager was not\n\nin the form of modification or amendment of the scheme. The Deputy\n\nGeneral Manager in clarification quoted the provisions and simply\n\nstated the position of a rule that the pensionable service was 20 years.\n\nThe communication was clarificatory and did not have the effect of\n\nmodifying the SBI VRS scheme as approved and adopted.\n\n\f 6\n\n9.(a) Radhey Shyam Pandey questioned the refusal of the bank to pay\n\npension, vide communication dated 26.9.2006 in the writ application\n\nfiled in the High Court at Allahabad. He retired on 31.3.2001 under\n\nthe SBI VRS. On 18.3.2001, the bank accepted the offer of the\n\nemployee to retire him voluntarily. He was aged 59 years three months\n\nand had nine months service still to go before attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation. On 31.3.2001, when the VRS became effective, he\n\nhad put in 19 years, nine months, and 18 days of pensionable service.\n\nHe had to retire on completion of 60 years, and would have put in a\n\nlittle more than 20 years of pensionable service.\n\n(b) The High Court held that the case of the employee fell under the\n\nSecond Part of Rule 22(i)(a). He was in service of the bank on and after\n\n11.11.1993 and completed ten years of pensionable service, and\n\nfurther, he attained the age of 58 years before the date he retired. The\n\nHigh Court opined that the clarification was not part of the VRS\n\nscheme. The employee retired outside rule as per the contractual\n\nretirement scheme. The contract had to prevail. In Pension Fund\n\nRules, Clause (a) in Rule 22(i) was inserted to give the employees the\n\nbenefit of pension after ten years of pensionable service even if they\n\nhad joined late. The High Court found that the matter was covered by\n\nRule 22(i)(a). The admissible benefit cannot be denied. If a contracting\n\n\f 7\n\nparty is entitled to take benefit of a permissible clause, then it cannot\n\nbe denied to him.\n\n(c) In the Chairman, State Bank of India & Ors. v. Mihir Kumar Nandi\n\n& Anr. (C.A. Nos. 5035­5037/2012), a Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt of Calcutta dismissing the intra­court appeal, affirmed the order\n\nof the learned Single Judge and directed to make the payment of\n\npension. The employee was appointed on 21.5.1988. He opted for VRS\n\non 15.1.2001. The acceptance was conveyed on 17.3.2001 by which\n\nhe was informed that he would be relieved of his duties on 31.3.2001.\n\nVide letter dated 2.8.2001, the employee was granted a pension at the\n\nrate of Rs.1024 per month. However, vide communication dated\n\n30.8.2001, the pension payment order, together with payment of\n\ncommuted value, was stopped in view of the amendment of Rule 22 of\n\nthe Pension Fund Rules. Though the amendments in Pension Fund\n\nRules were made effective with effect from 31.3.2001, and the age of\n\nretirement had been raised from 58 years to 60 years, w.e.f.\n\n22.5.1998, this had necessitated increase in age for admission to\n\nPension Fund to 58 years specified in Rule 22(i)(a) of the Rules so that\n\nthe employees who have retired/are retiring on attaining the age of 60\n\nyears after completing ten years of pensionable service on or after\n\n22.5.1998 are eligible for pension.\n\n\f 8\n\n(d) The Central Board of the SBI in its meeting held on 30.1.2001\n\naccorded approval to the amendment in Rules 8 and 22(i)(a) of the\n\nRules as set out in Annexure 1. The Trustees of the SBI Employees’\n\nPension Fund in their meeting on 30.10.2001 adopted the amended\n\nrules. Consequently, a Circular was issued on 8.11.2001. The\n\namendment was given effect from 31.3.2001, the date on which it was\n\nnotified, though it was adopted by the Trustees of the SBI Trust\n\nPension Fund in October 2001.\n\n(e) A Division Bench of the High Court held respondent­employee,\n\nas per rules on 17.3.2001, the date on which his offer was accepted,\n\nwas eligible to get the pension. On 31.3.2001, the amended rules were\n\npublished, which took away the existing right to get the pension. In\n\nVRS Scheme, it was mentioned that the pension would be payable in\n\naccordance with the rules as on 31.3.2001. The employee had no\n\nmeans of knowing about the future amendment of the Pension Rules,\n\nwhich would be detrimental to his interest. If he had known the fact,\n\nthen he would not have opted for the scheme. The silence maintained\n\nby the employer in such a situation amounted to a fraud on its part.\n\nThe High Court relied upon \nsection 17\n of the Contract Act and\n\nIllustration (d) to \nsection 19\n of the Contract Act. The High Court\n\nfurther held that it was the duty of the employer to disclose that there\n\nwould be a future amendment on the last date of their service by\n\n\f 9\n\nwhich their right to pension would be taken away. The same cannot\n\nbut be said to be unfair and arbitrary. Thus, the High Court held that\n\naction is violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. The\n\nemployee is entitled to the relief of pension along with interest.\n\n10. Ramesh Prasad Nigam (supra) had joined the services in 1984 in\n\nthe clerical cadre and was confirmed on 2.3.1985. He had applied for\n\nVRS, having completed 15 years of service and 57 years of age. The\n\nclarification was internal circulation. It was not within the knowledge\n\nof employees; as such, he was entitled to the pension.\n\n11. (a) In C.A. Nos.2287­88/2010, M.P. Hallan joined the services of\n\nthe bank on 18.5.1981 as a clerk. The acceptance under VRS was\n\ncommunicated on 17.3.2001. On 27.3.2001, he applied to withdraw\n\nhis request made under VRS as retirement was w.e.f. 31.3.2001. The\n\nBank declined application on 18.4.2001 on the ground that the last\n\ndate of withdrawal of the application was 15.2.2001. The employee\n\nclaimed pension under Pension Fund Rules in terms of SBI\n\nEmployees’ Pension Fund Rules (hereinafter referred to as ‘Pension\n\nRules’). By writing a letter on 12.4.2001, the claim of the employee for\n\nwithdrawal of application for voluntary retirement, pension, and leave\n\nencashment was again declined on 4.7.2001. Thereafter, he filed a writ\n\npetition in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana.\n\n\f 10\n\n(b) The High Court rejected the claim concerning the withdrawal\n\nfrom VRS. As the last date for withdrawal was over, and acceptance\n\nhad been communicated, however, considering Rule 22 of the Pension\n\nRules, the High Court opined that as the employee completed more\n\nthan 19 years and ten months of service on 31.3.2001, therefore, the\n\nfirst part of clause one of Rule 22 is not applicable. Further, the third\n\npart of clause (a) is not applicable as he has completed ten years of\n\nservice but not attained the age of 60 years. The case of the employee\n\nwas covered under the second part of clause (a) of Rule 22, which\n\nenabled the member to get a pension if an employee in the service of\n\nthe bank on or after 1.11.1993, and completed ten years pensionable\n\nservice and attained 58 years age. The employee applied in terms of\n\nthe Pension Rules prevailing in January 2001. Alternatively, if an\n\nemployee was in service of the bank on or after 1.11.1993, having\n\ncompleted ten years of pensionable service and on attaining the age of\n\n58 years, shall be entitled to a pension. Thus, he fulfilled the\n\nrequirement of second part of clause (a) of Rule 22 as he was in\n\nservice of the bank on 1.11.1993 and completed ten years of\n\npensionable service, and the age of 58 years, therefore, in terms of\n\nRule 22, he was entitled to pension as well as leave encashment dues\n\nalong with interest at the rate of 9 percent per annum.\n\n\f 11\n\n12. On behalf of the bank, it was submitted that VRS 2000\n\nstipulated that the pension in terms of SBI Pension Fund Rules on the\n\nrelevant date, i.e., 31.3.2001, was to be provided. In other words, in\n\ncase the employee was entitled to a pension in terms of Pension Rules\n\nand not otherwise. A provision was added in Rule 22(1) of the Pension\n\nRules in the year 1986, accordingly, the pension was to be granted in\n\nall cases relating to voluntary retirement on completion of 20 years of\n\nservice. The employees opting for the SBI­VRS would be governed only\n\nby Rule 22(i)(c) as it falls under the category of voluntary retirement.\n\nUnder Rule 22(iii), a member who has been permitted to retire under\n\nclause 22(i)(c) shall be entitled to a proportionate pension, which is on\n\ncompletion of 20 years of pensionable service. Eligibility clause 3 has\n\nnothing to do with the admissibility of the pension. It was further\n\nsubmitted that the employees who completed ten years of pensionable\n\nservice and were 60 years of age were entitled to pension; while\n\nemployees under the VRS on completion of 15 years would not get\n\npension and for that 20 years' service was necessary, the submission\n\nof employees that it would be discriminatory is based on incorrect\n\npremise. There is no challenge to the SBI Pension Rules or SBI­VRS.\n\nThe bank provided the pensionable service period of 10 years on\n\nattaining the age of 60 years in terms of reservation policy. The bank\n\nappoints late entrants like ex­servicemen who, after serving in Armed\n\n\f 12\n\nForces, join the bank and are left only with about ten years of service\n\nbefore they attain the age of superannuation. It is to grant benefit to\n\nsuch a particular category of employees that a period of 10 years on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation of 60 years was provided in Rule\n\n22(i)(a).\n\n13. The appellants further submitted that 20 years' period is\n\nprovided in case of voluntary retirement to ensure that an employee\n\non whom the bank has spent a considerable amount during training,\n\nworks for a substantial period before he seeks retirement. It is a\n\nuniform policy followed by the bank. \nRegulation 28\n was amended in\n\n2002 providing for 15 years of service. It applies to the employees who\n\nare governed by the Bank Employees' Pension Regulations, 1995.\n\nThese regulations do not apply to SBI employees as the SBI Pension\n\nRules govern them. SBI employees are entitled to Provident Fund,\n\ngratuity and pension in terms of the Rules on completion of 20 years\n\nof service. Thus, there cannot be any comparison of SBI employees\n\nwith the employees of other nationalised banks. The clarification dated\n\n11.01.2000 has also been relied on by the bank. Now more than 19\n\nyears have passed and to grant a pension to all those who have\n\nretired, w.e.f. 1.4.2001 would cast a huge financial liability on the\n\nbank.\n\n\f 13\n\n14. It was submitted on behalf of the employees that the decision\n\nrendered by the High Court is appropriate. No case for interference is\n\nmade out in appeals. The very essence of the VRS was the\n\nadmissibility of pension on completion of 15 years of service and other\n\nbenefits. Once the scheme was adopted and approved by the Central\n\nBoard of SBI, the clarification could not have been made to the\n\ndetriment of employees. The clarification did not have effect of the\n\namendment, modification, or cancellation of the VRS scheme as\n\napproved and adopted by Board. The amendment in the Pension\n\nRegulations of 1995 was carried out by other public sector banks with\n\nretrospective effect in 2002, though the scheme was floated and\n\nimplemented in the year 2000­2001. However, the benefits were\n\nextended on the strength of the VRS scheme even before amending the\n\nRegulations of 1995. The SBI adopted the Scheme in toto and Pension\n\nRule 22 providing eligibility of 20 years applies only to those cases\n\nwhere employees seek retirement in the ordinary course of completion\n\nof 10 years or 20 years, as the case may be. The VRS was taken in the\n\nspecific scheme providing eligibility and benefits on completion of 15\n\nyears of service, and that constituted a concluded contract. It was not\n\nopen to the bank to alter the terms. In case the bank's submission is\n\naccepted, it would lead to a situation that employees who have already\n\nreached the age of superannuation, would have been entitled to take\n\n\f 14\n\nVRS. The bank has misled the employees, and the action could not be\n\nsaid to be fair. Once an offer was accepted and after that to amend the\n\nrules or not to amend the rules till 31.3.2000 depended on exercise of\n\npower by SBI which may have the effect to deprive the pension when\n\nthe option was not available even to withdraw the offer as it was the\n\nlast day of the employment. Rule 22 was amended, that too with\n\nretrospective effect. Thus, the employees who joined service after\n\nretirement from other services, have completed the age of 58 years and\n\nwere in employment as on 1.11.1993 were entitled to a pension. They\n\nhave also been deprived of the benefit of pension, which would have\n\nbeen otherwise available to them. In case pension was not to be paid,\n\nit was not a profitable bargain for them to forego pension only for ex\n\ngratia benefit. It was incumbent upon the SBI to amend the Rule, in\n\ncase it was necessary to do so. Otherwise, also, the meaning of the\n\nexpression “pension” to be paid as per rules was that proportionate\n\npension to be awarded to the employees with 15 years’ service who\n\nwere eligible for benefits granted as specified in the circular and the\n\nVRS scheme. The clarification issued on 11.1.2000 only pointed out\n\nthe provisions of the VRS scheme as well as the existing position of the\n\nrule. It could not have effect to take away the benefit in any manner\n\nwhich became available to the employees of obtaining the pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of permanent pensionable service. On the one\n\n\f 15\n\nhand, employees who served for ten years and attained the age of\n\nsuperannuation were entitled to pension and to deprive the same to a\n\npermanent employee who rendered the service for 15 years, would be\n\nper se discriminatory, unfair and arbitrary. Once the scheme was\n\nfloated and approved, the bank being State within the purview of\n\nArticle 12\n of the Constitution of India, it would not be permissible for\n\nit to discriminate and act unfairly. The VRS constituted an\n\nindependent contract and was binding upon the bank. The benefits\n\ncould not have been taken away from eligible employees who accepted\n\nVRS, which was implemented by the bank for its benefit to induct new\n\nskills as well as to rationalise the workforce. Thus, appeals being\n\nbereft of merit, deserve dismissal.\n\n15. The main question is whether, under the scheme as approved\n\nand adopted by the Central Board of SBI, the pension is admissible to\n\nthe employees on completion of 15 years of permanent service.\n\nConnected question is whether employees have been denied benefit of\n\npension unfairly and arbitrarily contrary to the essential terms of the\n\nscheme.\n\n16. Firstly, it is necessary to consider the nature of the package,\n\nwhich was accepted in the resolution by the Central Board of Directors\n\nof SBI in its meeting dated 27.12.2000. As already mentioned, exercise\n\n\f 16\n\nwas done in order to rationalise the workforce as it was felt that banks\n\nwere overstaffed. The IBA advised the SBI regarding the issues\n\nconfronting the public sector banks. In the memorandum submitted to\n\nthe Central Board of Directors of SBI, the following facts were\n\nmentioned as to the adoption of Scheme in right earnest and\n\nrequirement of manpower planning:\n\n “The data available with IBA indicates that 43% of employees\n in Public Sector Banks are in the 46+ age group, and only 12%\n are in the 25­35 age group. This pattern has serious\n implications for the Banks with reference to mobility, training,\n development of skills, and succession plans for higher­level\n positions. This, coupled with excess manpower wherever it\n exists, would come in the way of induction of new skills and\n proper career progression.\n\n The Committee has recommended the introduction of a\n Voluntary Retirement Scheme that would assist the Banks in\n their effort to optimise their human resources and achieve a\n balanced age and skills profile in keeping with their business\n strategies. IBA has advised that the Government of India has\n conveyed that they have no objection to the banks' placing\n before their respective Boards of Director's proposals for\n adopting and implementing the Voluntary Retirement Scheme.\n It has been advised that Banks may adopt the scheme after\n obtaining their Boards' approval and implement it in right\n earnest.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n \"a) The high establishment costs of the Bank vis­à­vis the\n foreign banks and new private sector banks have been a\n matter of concern. The percentage of staff expenses to total\n expenses in the Bank is 21.85 against the percentage of 7.66\n and 3.04 for foreign banks and new private sector banks,\n respectively. Even if we compare it with other Public Sector\n Banks, our ratio is adverse.\n\n d) With the computerisation of accounting and other work at a\n large number of branches, manpower, which was needed for\n balancing of books, is now rendered surplus. This indicates an\n imperative need to rationalize the manpower at these\n branches. While we have already initiated steps for the\n productive redeployment of staff at these branches through\n shift banking and seven­day banking, there still exists scope\n for improvement in this area. Most of these branches are\n situated in metropolitan and urban centers. Incidentally, the\n\n\f 17\n\n experience of other banks in respect of voluntary retirement\n schemes shows that a maximum number of applications have\n been received from these centers.\n\n f) As against the average of 43% of employees in Public Sector\n Banks in the 46+ age group, we have 47% of the employees in\n this age group. Of this, 1/5th are in the age group of 56 and\n above. To put it simply, 21,824 employees will reach the age of\n superannuation and retire by March 2005.\n\n In the light of the above­mentioned factors, it will be seen\n that the manpower of the Bank will undergo major changes in\n the ensuing years in number and deployment. Further,\n considering the variety of business the Bank undertakes, and\n its special role in the banking sector, over­emphasis on\n quantitative parameters would be inappropriate. An approach\n paper on Manpower Planning is placed at Annexure­‘A’.\n\n Considering the various aspects of Manpower Planning, we\n are of the view that the Voluntary Retirement Scheme should\n be employed as a moderate tool to right­size the manpower in\n State Bank of India.\"\n\n In the light of aforesaid, it is clear that the VRS scheme was\n\ndevised as a tool to reduce overstaffing. The memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board contained the following significant aspects:\n\n “Keeping in view the above, the IBA guidelines and the\n feedback received from other Banks, the draft ‘SBI Voluntary\n Retirement Scheme (SBIVRS)’ is prepared and placed for\n approval at Annexure­‘B.'\n\n It is proposed to introduce SBIVRS for employees who have\n as on 31­12­2000, completed 40 years of age or 15 years of\n service as approved by the Government of India and conveyed\n by IBA. In terms of the IBA scheme, the Banks’ Boards may\n specify any other category as ineligible. We propose to exclude\n the Watch and Ward staff as these positions cannot be\n reduced. We also propose to exclude highly skilled and\n qualified staff from the Scheme.\n\n SBIVRS will be voluntary in nature. The decision to seek\n retirement under the Scheme rests with the employee only.\n The management will retain the discretion as to whether to\n accept or not the request for voluntary retirement under the\n Scheme. We have to ensure that while, on the one hand, our\n Bank benefits by the rightsizing of the staff strength, on the\n\n\f 18\n\n other, any sudden exodus of a very large number of staff does\n not destabilise the normal operations of the Bank. Considering\n the attractive features of the Scheme, in terms of ex­gratia\n payment, etc., a large number of applications are expected.\n However, the Bank will have to control the outflow according\n to its requirements. Towards this end, it will be necessary to\n retain the discretion with the management of the Bank to limit\n the number of employees allowed to retire in each category of\n staff to be covered under SBIVRS, and we propose to retain\n such discretion.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n It was proposed to introduce a VRS for employees who on\n\n31.12.2000, completed 15 years of service as approved by the\n\nGovernment of India and conveyed by IBA. So, it assumes significance\n\nthat what was approved and conveyed, in terms of the IBA scheme,\n\nthe Banks’ Boards were permitted to specify any other category as\n\nineligible. The SBI considering its requirement proposed to exclude the\n\nWatch and Ward staff as these positions could not be reduced. It was\n\nalso proposed to exclude the highly skilled and qualified staff from the\n\nscheme.\n\n Funds outlay was also proposed in the memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board as under:\n\n “FUNDS OUTLAY\n As per the estimate received from Bank's actuary, an outlay of\n approximately Rs. 2100 crores would be required for the\n implementation of SBIVRS if 10% of the employees opt for\n retirement. The break­up being as under:\n\n Ex­gratia Rs. 1300.00 crores\n Leave encashment Rs. 180.00 crores\n Additional Provision for Gratuity Rs. 140.00 crores\n Additional Provision for Pension Rs. 480.00 crores\n\n (These estimates may undergo a change on receipt of\n\n\f 19\n\n clarification from Government of India as to the components of\n ‘Pay’ for the purpose of Ex­gratia)”\n\n A provision was made for the pension. The bank reserved the\n\nright to modify, amend or cancel any or all the clauses. The Deputy\n\nManaging Director and CDO would be the competent authority.\n\nFollowing is the relevant clause regarding modification of the scheme:\n\n “MODIFICATION OF THE SCHEME\n Bank reserves the right to modify, amend or cancel any or all\n the clauses of the Scheme and to give effect thereto from any\n date it may deem fit. The Dy. Managing Director and CDO\n would be the Competent Authority for the purpose.”\n\n The effective date of retirement was 31.3.2001. The relevant\n\nclause is extracted hereunder:\n\n “EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT\n While the SBIVRS will be open to employees from 15th January\n 2001 to 31st January 2001 (both days included), the retirement\n under SBIVRS is proposed to be given effect from 31 st March\n 2001.\"\n\n17. The letter dated 31.8.2000 annexed to memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board of the SBI is also of utmost significance in order\n\nto understand what was accepted by the Central Board. The relevant\n\nportion of the letter dated 31.8.2000 of IBA is extracted hereunder:\n\n “Attention is invited to letter DO No. 11/1/99­IR dated\n 22.05.2000, addressed to the Chief Executive of public sector\n banks by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance\n (Banking Division), wherein banks have been advised to carry\n out detailed manpower planning in order to adopt measures to\n have optimum human resource at various levels in keeping\n with the business strategies and requirements of each bank.\n\n At the meeting the Finance Minister had with Chief Executives\n of public sector banks on 13th June 2000, the human resource\n and man­power planning in public sector banks were\n reviewed, and a Committee was constituted to examine the\n issues confronting public sector banks in that regard and\n\n\f 20\n\n suggest suitable remedial measures.\"\n\n “In order to remedy this situation with the urgency that\n circumstances demand, the Committee has placed before the\n Government two schemes, viz., Sabbatical Leave and a\n Voluntary Retirement Scheme that would assist the banks in\n their effort to optimise their human resource and achieve a\n balanced age and skills’ profile in keeping with their business\n strategies. Salient features of the two schemes are given in the\n Annexure.\n\n IBA, vide its letter dated 13th July 2000, has sought no\n objection from the Government for circulating the schemes to\n the Banks for consideration and adoption by their Boards. The\n Government have conveyed to us that they have no objection\n to the banks' placing the two schemes before their respective\n Board of Directors for adopting and implementing the above\n schemes. It has been advised that the Banks may adopt these\n schemes for sabbatical and voluntary retirement based on the\n essential features of the schemes given in the Annexure, after\n obtaining their Board’s approval and implement them in right\n earnest.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n “Banks are also requested to take special note of the following:\n\n1. \nSection 10(10C)\n of the Income Tax Act read with Rule 2BA.\n\n2. As per the amendments brought in by the \nFinance Act\n 2000,\n so long as the bank complies with the rules framed under\n \nSection 10(10C)\n, prior approval from the Chief Commissioner\n or Director General of Income­tax, as the case may be, is not\n required for VRS.\n\n3. Income­tax shall be deducted at source in respect of ex­gratia\n exceeding Rs.5.00 lakhs or such other ceiling as may be\n prescribed under the Income­tax Act.\n\n4. Only completed years of service will be reckoned for arriving at\n the minimum eligible service. Subject to this, fraction of\n service of six months and above will be reckoned as one year\n for the purpose of calculating the ex­gratia.\n\n5. While exercising discretion to decline applications for VRS or\n to make exceptions in the case of employees categorised as\n ineligible for VRS, the decision should not be discriminatory\n among employees who are similarly placed and the reasons\n therefor should be recorded.\n\n6. The competent authority for accepting VRS for the various\n categories/class of employee should be clearly laid down by\n the Board of Directors.\n\n\f 21\n\n 7. Banks should ensure compliance with requirements under\n labour legislations before giving effect to the Scheme.”\n\n18. IBA’s letter dated 31.8.2000 makes clear the salient features of\n\nthe VRS scheme that all permanent employees with 15 years of service\n\nwere eligible to retire. Ineligible persons have also been specified. In\n\nunqualified terms, it was mentioned in the annexures that such\n\nemployees would be entitled to the amount of ex gratia of 60 days’\n\nsalary for each completed year of service or salary for the number of\n\nmonths service is left, whichever is less. Other benefits admissible\n\nwere gratuity, pension including the commuted value of pension,\n\nbank's contribution towards provident fund, and leave encashment as\n\nper rules. Thus, scheme was to grant pension to all such employees\n\nwho opted for VRS on completion of 15 years of service and other\n\nbenefits as specified in the scheme. The Government of India,\n\nMinistry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, (Banking\n\nDivision), that it communicated approval vide letter dated 29.8.2000\n\nto IBA, it was sent to the SBI also, the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n “F.

The agenda submitted on 27.12.2000 for consideration of the\n\nCentral Board of SBI along with resolution are extracted as under:\n\n “AGENDA NO.3\n\n Man­ Power Planning and SBI Voluntary Retirement Scheme\n (SBI VRS)\n\n Submitted Memorandum dated the 26th December 2000 by\n the Deputy Managing Director & Corporate Development\n Officer, recommending that for the reasons stated therein,\n approval be accorded for the proposals contained in the\n Memorandum as also for adopting the stated approach to\n manpower planning and introduction SBIVRS in terms of the\n provisions contained in the Scheme at Annexure ‘B‘ of the\n Memorandum.\n\n Copies of the Memorandum were placed before the Directors\n present at the Meeting.\n\n ‘‘APPROVED”\n (SEAL)\n\n\f 23\n\n20. Annexure ‘B’ to the memorandum contained the VRS. The VRS\n\nwas prepared in view of the guidelines of the IBA. The amount of ex\n\ngratia and other benefits specified in the scheme under clauses 5/ 6 of\n\nthe scheme are extracted hereunder:\n\n “5. Amount of Ex­gratia:\n\n The staff members whose request for retirement under SBIVRS\n has been accepted by Competent Authority will be paid an\n amount of ex­gratia of 60 days‘ salary (pay plus stagnation\n increments plus dearness allowance) for each completed year\n of service (for this purpose fraction of service of six months\n and above will be taken as one year and accordingly service of\n less than six months will not be counted) or salary for the\n number of months service is left, whichever is less. Fraction of\n a month, if any, will be ignored.\n\n ‘Relevant Date‘ means the date on which the employee ceases\n to be in service of the Bank as a consequence of the\n acceptance of the Bank as a consequence of the acceptance of\n the request for voluntary retirement under the Scheme. For\n the purpose of calculation of ex­gratia, 60 days‘ salary\n mentioned in the Scheme is to be taken as equivalent to 2\n months‘ salary (with reference to salary for the month in which\n employee is relieved from service on Voluntary Retirement.\n\n Income Tax shall be deducted at source in respect of ex­gratia\n exceeding Rs. 5.00 lakhs or such other ceiling as may be\n prescribed under the \nIncome Tax Act\n on the relevant date.“\n\n The benefits were as under:\n\n “6. Other benefits\n\n (a) Gratuity as payable under the extant instructions on the\n relevant date.\n\n (b) Provident Fund contribution as per State Bank of India\n Employees‘ Provident Fund Rules as on relevant date.\n\n (c) Pension in terms of State Bank of India Employees‘ Pension\n Fund Rules on the relevant date (including commuted value of\n pension).\n\n (d) Encashment of balance of Privilege Leave, as applicable, on the\n relevant date.\n\n\f 24\n\n (e) Respective facilities extended to officers/others such as\n retention of accommodation, telephone, car, continuation of\n housing loan, etc. will be extended to officers.

However, in such cases of retention of\n physical facilities, 50% of the amount of ex­gratia payable will\n be released only after the employee surrenders the facility. No\n interest, however, will be paid for the amount so withheld. All\n other outstanding loans/advances will have to be repaid before\n date of retirement under SBIVRS, failing which the amount of\n ex­gratia and other terminal benefits payable to the employee\n will be appropriated towards the outstanding loans/advances;\n\n and the balance only will be payable to the employee.”\n\n21. Most significantly, the scheme of the IBA, accepted by the Board\n\non 27.12.2000, was for providing pension on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice. The pension specified in clause 6 of scheme was to be worked\n\nout in terms of the Pension Fund Rules including the commuted value\n\nof the pension. It was not mentioned in the VRS adopted by the SBI\n\nthat the person on completion of 15 years would not be entitled to the\n\nbenefit of pension. On the other hand, proposal of IBA, as approved by\n\nthe Government of India, was accepted in toto by SBI. When gauged in\n\nterms of the proposals of the IBA, the essential feature was that an\n\nemployee was entitled to get pension on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice. The meaning of the expression \"pension” in terms of the rules\n\nwould be proportionate pension on completion of 15 years of service as\n\nper the terms of calculation provided in Rule 23 of the Pension Rules.\n\nVRS is an independent contract and the background in which it was\n\nfloated, pension on completion of 15 years of service was an essential\n\n\f 25\n\npart of the scheme of VRS 2000, as approved by the Government and\n\nfloated by the IBA and adopted by all the Banks, and Pension Rules\n\nwere to be amended accordingly.\n\n22. The Government of India suggested to the IBA to amend\n\nRegulation 29\n of the Regulations of 1995 so that the employees do not\n\nlose the benefit of pension, the IBA may work out modalities and\n\nsuggest amendments, if any, required to be made in the Pension\n\nRegulations to ensure that the employees get the benefit of pension.\n\nThe letter dated 5.9.2000 of Government of India is extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n “F. No. 4/8/4/2000­IR\n Government of India,\n Ministry of Finance,\n Department of Economic Affairs\n (Banking Division)\n New Delhi, 5­9­2000\n\n To\n The Personnel Advisor,\n Indian Banks’ Association,\n Mumbai\n Sub.: Amendment to \nRegulation 29\n of the Pension Regulations.\n Sir,\n I am directed to refer to this Division's Letter No. 11/1/99 IR\n dated 29­8­2000, conveying the Government's no objection for\n circulation of Voluntary Retirement Scheme in public sector\n banks. The Scheme, inter alia, provides that employees with\n 15 years of service or 40 years of age shall be eligible to take\n voluntary retirement under the Scheme. As per the provisions\n contained in \nRegulation 29\n of the Pension Regulations, an\n employee can take voluntary retirement after 20 years of\n qualifying service and thereafter becomes eligible for pension.\n\n Thus, employees having rendered 15 years of service or\n completing 40 years of age but not having completed 20 years\n\n\f 26\n\n of service shall not be eligible for pensionary benefits on taking\n voluntary retirement under the Scheme.\n\n In order to ensure that such employees do not lose the benefit\n of pension, IBA may work out modalities and suggest\n amendments, if any, required to be made in the Pension\n Regulations to ensure that these employees also get the benefit\n of pension.\n\n Yours faithfully,\n sd/­\n (U.P. Singh)\n Director (IR)”\n\n23. SBI issued a circular on 10.1.2001 with respect to the\n\nwithdrawal of the application submitted under the scheme. It was\n\ndecided that the employee could withdraw the application on or before\n\n15.2.2001 by making a written request.\n\n24. Clarification was issued on 15.1.2001 to a query raised, whether\n\nor not the employees on completing 15 years of pensionable service\n\nwould be entitled to pensionary benefits. Following is a relevant\n\nportion:\n\n “3. Whether or not the employees, completing 15 years of\n pensionable service as on relevant date (date of retirement\n under SBIVRS), will be entitled for pension benefits?\n\n In this connection, we invite a reference to para 6(c) of the\n Scheme forwarded under the cover of Staff Circular letter No.\n CDO/81 dated 30/12/2000. The payment of pension to the\n employee retiring under SBIVRS would be governed by State\n Bank of India Employees Pension Fund Rules on the relevant\n date (including commuted value of pension). However, as per\n existing rules, employees who have not completed 20 years of\n Pensionable Service are not eligible for pension.”\n\n It is clear from answer that the staff circular dated 30.12.2000\n\nwas reiterated. Payment of pension to an employee retiring under VRS\n\nwould be governed by rules on the relevant date, i.e., 31.3.2001. At\n\n\f 27\n\nthe same time, the position of the existing rule was indicated that\n\nthose employees who had not completed 20 years of pensionable\n\nservice were not eligible for a pension. It was not clarified what was\n\nthe meaning and purport of para 6(c) of the scheme. It was not\n\nmentioned that an employee would not be entitled to pension on 15\n\nyears of service as per the scheme approved by the Government of\n\nIndia and floated by the IBA and adopted by the Central Board of SBI.\n\nThe above clarification being in form of opinion, could not be said to\n\nhave caused a modification, amendment, or cancellation of any of the\n\nclauses of VRS or resolution passed by the Board, nor it was so stated.\n\nIt was necessary to state that on completion of 15 years of service,\n\nemployees would not be paid pension. The existing rule position was\n\nknown to everybody, whereas the scheme was framed for providing\n\npension on completion of 15 years of service.\n\n25. Rule 22 of the Pension Rules of SBI as it existed up to 9.3.2001\n\nand amended are extracted hereunder:\n\n Existing Rule\n\n “22(i) A member shall be entitled to a pension under these\n rules on retiring from the Bank’s service­\n\n (a) After having completed 20 years' pensionable service provided\n that he has attained the age of 50 years or if he is in the\n service of the Bank on or after 01.11.93, after having\n completed ten years pensionable service provided that he has\n attained the age of 58 years.\n\n (b) After having completed twenty years' irrespective of the age he\n shall have attained if he shall satisfy the authority competent\n to sanction his retirement by approved medical certificate or\n\n\f 28\n\n otherwise that he is incapacitated for further active service;\n\n (c) After having completed twenty years pensionable service,\n irrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in\n writing;\n\n (d) After twenty­five years' pensionable service.“\n\n Amended Rule\n\n “22(i) A member shall be entitled to a pension under these\n rules on retiring from the Bank’s service­\n\n (a) After having completed twenty years' pensionable service\n provided that he has attained the age of fifty years or if he is in\n the service of the Bank on or after 01.11.93, after having\n completed 10 years, pensionable service provided that he has\n attained the age of fifty­eight years or if he is in the service of\n the bank on or after 22.05.1998. After having completed ten\n years, pensionable service provided that he has attained the\n age of sixty years.\n\n (b) After having completed twenty years' pensionable service,\n irrespective of the age he shall have attained if he shall satisfy\n the authority competent to sanction his retirement by\n approved medical certificate or otherwise that he is\n incapacitated for further active service;\n\n (c) After having completed twenty years pensionable service,\n irrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in\n writing;\n\n (d) After twenty­five years' pensionable service.\"\n\n26. It is clear from Rule 22 that pension is admissible to an\n\nemployee thus:\n\n 1) After having completed 20 years’ pensionable service provided\n\n that he has attained the age of 50 years; or\n\n 2) If he is in the service of the Bank on or after 01.11.1993, after\n\n having completed 10 years pensionable service provided that he\n\n has attained the age of 50 years; or\n\n 3) If he is in the service of the Bank on or after 22.05.1998, after\n\n having completed 10 years pensionable service provided that he\n\n has attained the age of 60 years.\n\n\f 29\n\n27. Rule 22(1)(c) was incorporated in the Pension Fund Rules w.e.f.\n\n20.9.1986 when the bank decided inter alia to introduce VRS on\n\ncompletion of 20 years of service. The unamended rule 22(i)(a)\n\nprovided the normal age of retirement to be 58 years. Thereafter, as\n\nper the guidelines issued by the Government on 22.5.1998, the age of\n\nretirement was increased from 58 to 60 years. Accordingly, Rule 22(i)\n\n(a) was proposed to be amended on 30.1.2001, and instead of 58\n\nyears, the age of retirement of 60 years was to be incorporated. On\n\n28.5.1998, the Executive Committee of the Central Board of SBI\n\npending amendment to the related service rules adopted the age of\n\nretirement as 60 years. The amendment was notified on 31.3.2001\n\nand approved by the Trustees of the SBI Employees’ Pension Fund on\n\n30.10.2001.\n\n28. Similar scheme of VRS concerning nationalised banks was\n\nimplemented according to the decision of the Government of India. In\n\nPunjab & Sind Bank, it was to remain open from 1.12.2000 to\n\n31.12.2000; Punjab National Bank: 1.11.2000 to 30.11.2000; Bank of\n\nIndia: 15.11.2000 to 14.12.2000; Union Bank of India: 1.12.2000 to\n\n31.12.2000; United Bank of India: 1.1.2001 to 31.1.2001. In SBI, the\n\nsaid scheme was adopted by the Central Board on 27.12.2000.\n\n\f 30\n\n29. The State Bank of India was constituted under the SBI Act,\n\n1955. The nationalised banks were taken over in terms of the \nBanking\n\nCompanies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970\n.\n\nUnder the Act\n of 1970, the Punjab National Bank (Employees) Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995, were framed. \nRegulation 28\n, provided pension on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation, and \nRegulation 29\n provided\n\npension on voluntary retirement on completion of 20 years of\n\nqualifying service. \nRegulation 29(5)\n, applicable to the banks mentioned\n\nabove, provided that the qualifying service of an employee retiring\n\nvoluntarily under the Regulation shall be increased by a period not\n\nexceeding five years, subject to the condition that the total qualifying\n\nservice rendered by such employee shall not exceed 33 years.\n\n30. The VRS 2000 came up for consideration before this Court in\n\nBank of India & Ors. v. O.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (2003) 2 SCC 721 in\n\nthe context of \nRegulation 29(5)\n of Regulations, 1995. The Court held\n\nthat the scheme is contractual and provided for pensionary benefits on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of service. The decision was followed in HEC\n\nVoluntary Retd.\n \nEmployees Welfare Society v. Heavy Engineering\n\nCorporation Ltd.\n, (2006) 3 SCC 708.\n\n31. Due to introduction of Scheme, \nRegulation 28\n of Regulations of\n\n1995 was proposed to be amended. It was amended in the year 2002\n\n\f 31\n\nwith a retrospective effect from 1.9.2000. By way of amendment, a\n\nproviso has been inserted in \nRegulation 28\n thus:\n\n “28. Superannuation pension.—Superannuation pension shall\n be granted to an employee who has retired on his attaining the\n age of superannuation specified in the Service Regulations or\n Settlements.”\n\n “Provided that pension shall also be granted to an employee\n who opts to retire before attaining the age of superannuation,\n but after having served for a minimum period of 15 years in\n terms of any scheme that may be framed for the purpose by\n the Bank’s Board with the concurrence of the Government.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n32. The employees who opted for VRS on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice within the specified period in 2000/2001, were given the\n\nbenefit of pension. The Regulations came to be amended in 2002 with\n\nthe retrospective effect. However, the benefit under \nRegulation 29(5)\n\nwas not extended to the optees/employees who completed 20 years of\n\nservice by adding 5 years of qualifying service. Regulations 29(1) and\n\n29(5) applicable to the said banks are extracted hereunder:\n\n “29. Pension on voluntary retirement.—(1) On or after the 1st\n day of November 1993 at any time, after an employee has\n completed twenty years of qualifying service he may, by giving\n notice of not less than three months in writing to the\n appointing authority retire from service:\n\n Provided that this sub­regulation shall not apply to an\n employee who is on deputation or on study leave abroad\n unless after having been transferred or having returned to\n India he has resumed charge of the post in India and has\n served for a period of not less than one year:\n\n Provided further that this sub­regulation shall not apply to\n an employee who seeks retirement from service for being\n absorbed permanently in an autonomous body or a public\n sector undertaking or company or institution or body, whether\n incorporated or not to which he is on deputation at the time of\n seeking voluntary retirement:\n\n\f 32\n\n Provided that this sub­regulation shall not apply to an\n employee who is deemed to have retired in accordance with\n clause (1) of \nRegulation 2\n.\n\n xxx\n (5) The qualifying service of an employee retiring voluntarily\n under this Regulation shall be increased by a period not\n exceeding five years, subject to the condition that the total\n qualifying service rendered by such employee shall not in any\n case exceed thirty­three years and it does not take him beyond\n the date of superannuation.”\n\n33. The scheme in question came up for consideration in \nO.P.\n\nSwarnakar & Ors.\n (supra), in which SBI was one of appellants in C.A.\n\nNos.3561­65/2002, the appeals were decided by this Court by a\n\ncommon judgment. It noted that reference to pension as per rules was\n\nmade for computation of pension, and the employees who had\n\ncompleted 15 years of service were to be extended the benefit of VRS\n\n2000 along with pension and other benefits. IBA wrote a letter dated\n\n11.12.2000 to all public sector banks for amending Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995. The IBA mentioned that pension was to be paid to\n\nthe employees as per VRS 2000. They would be eligible for pro­rata\n\npension; as such, \nRegulation 28\n be amended. The employees who\n\napplied for voluntary retirement after having rendered 15 years’\n\nservice, under a special/ad hoc scheme formulated with the specific\n\napproval of the Government and the Board of Directors would be\n\neligible for pro­rata pension for the period of service rendered as if they\n\nwere to retire on attaining the age of superannuation on that date. The\n\nletter made it clear that the Government of India approved the pension\n\n\f 33\n\nto be given on completion of 15 years of service. The scheme was for\n\nextending the benefit of pension to the employees retiring on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of permanent service, and the Government of\n\nIndia also desired that the IBA advised banks to make necessary\n\namendments to their pension regulations, as mentioned in the\n\nAnnexure. Thus, the essence of the VRS scheme was the benefit of\n\npro­rata pension as per the rules on completion of 15 years of\n\npensionable service.\n\n34. It is apparent that the very fulcrum of the scheme was a felt\n\nneed for inducting new workforce, with adequate knowledge of new\n\nskills such as modern technology, foreign exchange, venture capital, e­\n\ncommerce, money management, etc. as pointed out by the Ministry of\n\nFinance in its letter dated 22.5.2000. The banks were overstaffed and\n\nfor effective management and manpower planning, the desirability of\n\nintroducing VRS was felt in order to rationalise the workforce and\n\nskill. Hence a Committee was constituted by the Central Government.\n\nIn pursuance of report of the Committee, a policy decision was taken\n\nto frame the VRS. The scheme applied to employees who, on the date\n\nof the application, completed 15 years of service. The employees\n\nspecified therein were otherwise not eligible to seek voluntary\n\nretirement on completion of 15 years under the rules/regulations.\n\nUnder the scheme floated by the other banks, identical reliefs were\n\n\f 34\n\nadmissible, as in SBI VRS. The Scheme of Punjab National Bank is\n\nextracted hereunder:\n\n “7. x x x “Amount of ex gratia\n An employee seeking voluntary retirement under the\n Scheme will be entitled to the ex gratia amount mentioned\n below in para (a) or (b), whichever is less:\n\n (a) 60 days’ salary (pay plus stagnation increments plus\n special pay plus dearness relief) for each completed year of\n service;\n\n OR\n\n (b) salary for the number of months of service left;\n\n Other benefits\n An employee seeking voluntary retirement under the\n Scheme will be eligible for the following benefits in addition to\n the ex gratia amount mentioned in para 6 above of this\n Scheme:\n\n (i) Gratuity as per the \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n or\n gratuity payable under the Service Rules, as the case may be,\n as per existing rules.\n\n (ii)(a) Pension (including commuted value of pension) as per\n PNB (Employees) Pension Regulations, 1995.\n\n OR\n\n (b) Bank’s contribution towards PF as per existing rules.\n\n (iii) Leave encashment as per existing rules.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n35. The eligibility criteria in all the schemes, including SBI VRS,\n\nclearly provided that employees who completed 15 years of service and\n\nparticular age shall be eligible to apply. The benefits to which they\n\nwere entitled, were culled out. In other banks, the pension was as per\n\nPension Regulation, 1995. Thus, on eligibility of an employee,\n\nadmissibility of the available reliefs in Scheme followed i.e., the\n\namount of ex gratia and other benefits, including pension, were to be\n\npaid as provided in the scheme. Otherwise, there was no purpose of\n\nretiring an employee with 15 years of service as they were not eligible\n\n\f 35\n\nfor retirement as per the rules before completion of 20 years of service\n\nin all nationalised banks as well as SBI. A reference to the\n\nadmissibility of the pension as per rules/ regulations was made in all\n\nthe VRS to mean that proportionate pension shall be admissible as\n\nprovided in rules, this Court has noted it in \nO.P. Swarnakar\n (supra),\n\nthus:\n\n “49. An offer indisputably can be made to a group of persons\n collectively which is capable of being accepted individually, but\n the question which has to be posed and answered is as to\n whether having regard to the service jurisprudence; the\n principles of the \nIndian Contract Act\n would be applicable in\n the instant case. It is the specific case of the “banks” that the\n Schemes had been floated by way of contract. It does not have\n any statutory flavour. Reference to the Pension Scheme framed\n under the Regulations was made for computation of the\n pension.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n36. Significantly in \nO.P. Swarnakar\n (supra), this Court observed that\n\nemployees must have proceeded to apply for VRS on the basis even\n\nthough they have merely completed 15 years of service, which was not\n\na qualifying service, under the Pension Regulations of Bank, they\n\nwould be entitled to benefits in terms of the VRS scheme. The Court\n\nobserved thus:\n\n “89. Furthermore, a large number of employees have\n withdrawn their offer only when a proviso was sought to be\n added to \nRegulation 28\n aforementioned. In terms of the\n Scheme the employees, who expected to get benefits of sub­\n regulation (4) of \nRegulation 29\n would be deprived therefrom. It\n is not in this dispute that the qualifying period for receiving\n pension was 20 years. Only upon completion of 20 years, in\n terms of the statutory regulation contained in \nRegulation 29\n,\n an employee could opt for voluntary retirement, and in terms\n\n\f 36\n\n thereof, he would be entitled to the benefits specified therein.\n The said Regulations had specifically been mentioned for the\n purpose of computation, which would include invocation of\n sub­regulation (4) of \nRegulation 29\n, providing for relaxation of\n 5 years towards the qualifying period. The employees must\n have proceeded on the basis that despite the fact that they\n have merely rendered 15 years of service, which was not a\n qualifying service under the Regulations, they would be\n entitled to the pensionary benefits in terms of the Scheme. By\n introducing the proviso to \nRegulation 28\n pension was sought\n to be made pro rata in place of full pension.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n37. \nIn \nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n (supra), it was held that the scheme\n\nwas not a part of statutory regulations. It was in the realm of contract.\n\nThat being so, the Central Government did not need to place the same\n\nbefore Parliament; and secondly, if the same was a regulation, the\n\nlaying­down rule is merely directory and not mandatory.\n \nThis Court\n\nrelied upon the decisions in \nJan Mohd. Noor Mohd. Bagban v. State of\n\nGujarat\n, \nAIR 1966 SC 385 and Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. State of\n\nHaryana\n; 1979 (2) SCC 196 and held that the scheme could not be\n\nsaid to be bad in law, thus:\n\n “124. Firstly, the Scheme is not a part of the statutory\n regulation. It was in the realm of contract. That being, so it\n was not necessary for the Central Government to place the\n same before Parliament.\n\n 125. Secondly, even if the same was a regulation, the laying­\n down rule is merely a directory one and not mandatory.\n\n 126. \nIn \nJan Mohd.\n case, AIR 1966 SC 385, the law is stated in\n the following terms: (AIR pp. 394­95, para 18)\n\n “18. Finally, the validity of the rules framed under \nBombay\n Act\n 22 of 1939 was canvassed. By \nSection 26(1)\n of the Bombay\n Act, the State Government was authorised to make rules for\n the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. It was\n provided by sub­section (5) that the rules made under \nSection\n 26\n shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Provincial\n\n\f 37\n\n Legislature at the session thereof next following and shall be\n liable to be modified or rescinded by a resolution in which both\n Houses concur, and such rules shall, after notification in the\n Official Gazette, be deemed to have been modified or rescinded\n accordingly. It was urged by the petitioner that the rules\n framed under \nBombay Act\n 22 of 1939 were not placed before\n the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council at the first\n session, and therefore they had no legal validity. The rules\n under Act 22 of 1939 were framed by the Provincial\n Government of Bombay in 1941. At that time, there was no\n Legislature in session, the Legislature having been suspended\n during the emergency arising out of World War II. The session\n of the Bombay Legislative Assembly was convened for the first\n time after 1941 on 20­5­1946, and that session was prorogued\n on 24­5­1946. The second session of the Bombay Legislative\n Assembly was convened on 15­7­1946, and that of the\n Bombay Legislative Council on 3­9­1946 and the rules were\n placed on the Assembly Table in the second session before the\n Legislative Assembly on 2­9­1946 and before the Legislative\n Council on 13­9­1946. \nSection 26(5)\n of Bombay Act 22 of 1939\n does not prescribe that the rules acquired validity only from\n the date on which they were placed before the Houses of\n Legislature. The rules are valid from the date on which they\n are made under \nSection 26(1)\n. It is true that the Legislature\n has prescribed that the rules shall be placed before the Houses\n of Legislature, but failure to place the rules before the Houses\n of Legislature does not affect the validity of the rules, merely\n because they have not been placed before the Houses of the\n Legislature. Granting that the provisions of sub­section (5) of\n \nSection 26\n by reason of the failure to place the rules before the\n Houses of Legislature were violated, we are of the view that\n sub­section (5) of \nSection 26\n having regard to the purposes for\n which it is made, and in the context in which it occurs, cannot\n be regarded as mandatory. The rules have been in operation\n since the year 1941, and by virtue of \nSection 64\n of Gujarat Act\n 20 of 1964, they continue to remain in operation.\"\n\n 127. \nIn \nAtlas Cycle Industries\n' case, (1979) 2 SCC 196, the\n same view has been reiterated.\n\n 128. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the Scheme in\n question cannot be said to be bad in law.”\n\n38. The Court concerning the provision of withdrawal held that the\n\nrelevant clause of the scheme created an enforceable right in case the\n\nState Bank failed to adhere to its preferred policy.\n\n\f 38\n\n39. In our opinion, the reference in the SBI VRS to the admissible\n\nbenefits, like pension shall be as per the pension rules, was for the\n\npurpose of computation of pension. It is apparent from a reading of\n\nthe scheme that proportionate pension was admissible to employees\n\nas noted in para 49 of \nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n (supra). A similar\n\nexpression was used in the schemes of nationalised banks also. This\n\nCourt has noted expression in the scheme that pension as per rules to\n\nmean for computation of pension. The formula for computation for a\n\npension is provided in Rule 23 of the SBI Pension Rules.\n\n40. It is of utmost significance that the Central Board in its meeting\n\ndated 27.12.2000 accorded approval “for the proposals contained in\n\nthe Memorandum.” A bare perusal of the memorandum makes it clear\n\nthat the letter of IBA dated 31.8.2000 was enclosed as part of the\n\nmemorandum submitted to the Central Board. In the memorandum, it\n\nwas mentioned \"that the Government of India conveyed that they had\n\nno objection to the banks' placing before their respective Boards of\n\nDirector's proposals for adopting and implementing the Voluntary\n\nRetirement Scheme. It advised that Banks may ‘adopt’ the scheme\n\nafter obtaining their Boards' approval and implement it in ‘right\n\nearnest’.\" The memorandum also contained that the employees who\n\ncompleted 15 years of service were to be the beneficiaries of VRS as\n\napproved by the Government of India and conveyed by the IBA. The\n\n\f 39\n\napproval by Government of India and scheme, conveyed by IBA, was to\n\nprovide for the benefit of pension on completion of 15 years of service.\n\nThe same was an essential condition of the scheme. The Annexure,\n\nwhich was part of the memorandum, provided inter alia the benefit of\n\npension, including the commuted value of pension without any rider of\n\ncompletion of 20 years period of service. Once SBI accepted the\n\nproposals contained in the memorandum, when we gauge the scheme\n\nin the light of the subject matter of the memorandum which was\n\nunconditionally approved, it became clear and beyond the pale of\n\ndoubt that in VRS (Annexure B) inasmuch as the expression to\n\nprovide the benefit of pension as per rules was only for providing the\n\nproportionate pensionary benefit of the qualifying service on and above\n\n15 years, rendered by an employee.\n\n41. The IBA advised the banks for amending the rules. The\n\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, also issued a letter dated\n\n5.9.2001 to the Bank to amend the rules. There was a proposal to\n\namend the rules. After the scheme was implemented in 2000, the\n\nnationalised banks, including the Punjab National Bank, amended\n\ntheir rules in 2002 with retrospective effect. However, the fact remains\n\nthe VRS schemes were implemented by banks governed by the\n\nBanking Companies Act, 1970\n, by making payment of pension though\n\nRegulation 28\n of Regulation of 1995 provided for 20 years of qualifying\n\n\f 40\n\nservice at the relevant time. Once a particular scheme of VRS, based\n\non the recommendations of Committee formed by Government of\n\nIndia, was formulated and floated by IBA. In all fairness, it was\n\nrequired to be implemented in right earnest in that form in which it\n\nwas approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of SBI on\n\n27.12.2000. In case the Board of Directors were of the opinion that the\n\nscheme was not acceptable to them, they could have rejected it or\n\ncould have stated they reject the proposal for paying pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of service which was the essence of a scheme\n\nformed to reduce workforce of Bank and for achieving other objectives.\n\nNonetheless, on the contrary, resolution dated 27.12.2000 indicates\n\nthat the proposals of IBA/Government was approved unconditionally.\n\nThus, in case it was so necessary to amend the pension rules as done\n\nby other banks, it was incumbent upon the State Bank of India to\n\namend its rules either after implementation of the scheme as was done\n\nby other banks or before giving effect to VRS.\n\n42. It is also significant to mention that SBI accepted the scheme as\n\napproved by the Government and floated by IBA. In case SBI had\n\ndeclined to accept or wanted to modify, it was necessary for it to take\n\napproval of Government of India as to its scheme. As per \nsection 49\n,\n\nthe Central Government has the power to make rules. \nSection 50\n deals\n\nwith the power of Central Government to make regulations. \nSection\n\n\f 41\n\n50(1)\n provides that the Central Board, after consultation with the\n\nReserve Bank of India and with the previous sanction of the Central\n\nGovernment, can make Regulations. Under \nSection 50(2)(o)\n, the\n\nRegulations can be made by the Central Board with the previous\n\nsanction of the Central Government with respect to superannuation\n\npension and other funds for the benefit of the employees of the State\n\nBank. \nSection 50(2)(o)\n reads:\n\n “50. Power of Central Board to make regulations.—(1) The\n Central Board may, after consultation with the Reserve Bank and\n with the previous sanction of the Central Government [by\n notification in the Official Gazette,] make regulations, not\n inconsistent with this Act and the rules made thereunder, to\n provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the\n purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act.\n\n (2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the\n foregoing power, such regulations may provide for—\n xxx\n\n (o) the establishment and maintenance of superannuation\n pension, provident or other funds for the benefit of the employees\n of the State Bank or of the State Bank or of the dependents of\n such employees or for the purposes of the State Bank, and the\n granting of superannuation allowances, annuities and pensions\n payable out of any such fund;]”\n\n43. Thus, it is apparent that the Central Board of SBI could not have\n\nframed a scheme different than the one approved by the Central\n\nGovernment on its own, nor could have implemented it without\n\napproval of the Central Government. In case it wanted to modify or\n\namend the scheme, as approved by the Government of India, it was\n\nincumbent upon it to send its modified scheme to the Central\n\n\f 42\n\nGovernment for approval. No scheme for VRS could have been framed\n\nwithout approval of the Government of India. In fact, the Central\n\nBoard accepted the proposal of IBA, as approved by the Government of\n\nIndia. In case SBI’s stand is accepted, its scheme would have been\n\nvalid as no modification could have been made without approval of the\n\nGovernment of India. In fact, no such modification was made, as held\n\nabove.\n\n44. Once it approved the Scheme SBI being an instrumentality of\n\nState under \nArticle 12\n, is bound by the principle of fairness and\n\nrepresentation made that it accepted the contents of memorandum\n\nand the scheme floated by IBA and invited the applications based on\n\napproving the memorandum which contained proposal of pension on\n\nrendering 15 years of permanent pensionable service, it could not later\n\non wriggle out of its obligation taking a rigmarole by claiming shelter\n\nof the Rules or by not amending the Rules or by issuing a clarification\n\nwhich was fanciful, irrational and contrary to the spirit of the\n\nresolution of the Board. It would amount to an unfair and\n\nunreasonable action to deprive the employees of the benefit of pension\n\nbecause of the decision taken by the Central Board of Directors.\n\n45. SBI is bound by resolution of Central Board of Directors.\n\nThe Scheme was with the approval of the Government of India and\n\n\f 43\n\naccepted, implemented by all the banks in true spirit except by SBI. It\n\ncannot be permitted to act unfairly by virtue of having superior\n\nbargaining power by issuing vague clarification to the detriment of the\n\neconomic interest of the employees. Clarification did not have the\n\neffect of re­writing or superseding the resolution of the Central Board\n\nnor effect of making modifications in the resolution passed by the\n\nCentral Board of the SBI.\n\n46. The VRS scheme was not floated by the SBI on its own volition.\n\nIt was pursuant to an exercise that was undertaken by the IBA in view\n\nof the recent developments of modern technology considering the age\n\ngroup of the employees in the bank, the need to have a new skill, and\n\nto rationalise the manpower; a decision was taken. It was decided at\n\nthe Government level to provide pension after completion of 15 years\n\nof service as a special measure, the banks were bound to implement it\n\nin that manner or not at all. The Central Board of Directors of the SBI\n\naccepted the VRS proposal of Government and IBA without any\n\nreservation of not providing pension along with other benefits, as\n\nmandated in the VRS scheme. The action of the instrumentality of the\n\nState cannot be violative of \nArticle 14.\n It cannot be permitted to act\n\narbitrarily. \nArticles 15\n and \n16\n provide for equality and provide for an\n\numbrella against discrimination.\n\n\f 44\n\n47. Though the Deputy General Manager was authorised by the\n\nCentral Board of Directors to amend, modify or cancel the VRS. The\n\nRules were amended by other banks later in 2002. It was not stated in\n\nanswer to the query that under the VRS scheme, a person who has\n\nrendered 15 years of qualifying service would not be entitled to a\n\npension. Nor it was so stated in resolution dated 27.12.2000 of the\n\nCentral Board of SBI. That apart, Deputy General Manager tried to\n\ninterpret VRS scheme in isolation without considering what was\n\napproved by the Board. Not only the scheme but also the\n\nmemorandum have to be read together to understand resolution of\n\nBoard. Once the memorandum containing the IBAs proposal of\n\nproviding pension was approved in absolute terms, the clarification\n\ncould not be of any value to dilute the otherwise clear and\n\nunambiguous resolution of the Board of Directors. The Deputy\n\nGeneral Manager did not have any such wide and arbitrary power to\n\ndefeat the claim of the employees for pension on completion of 15\n\nyears of permanent service, which was their right. The action of\n\nD.G.M. could not be said to be in accordance with the resolution. The\n\npension was the essence of the scheme, depriving it could not be said\n\nto be authorised, such action can only be termed as unfair and\n\nunreasonable and patently violative of \nArticles 14\n, 16\n, and \n21\n of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n\f 45\n\n48. Yet another aspect which cannot be lost sight is that the bank\n\nmentioned in the scheme that the benefit would be admissible as per\n\nthe rule which prevails on the appointed day, i.e., 31.3.2001. Thus, it\n\nis apparent that when VRS scheme was floated, it was in\n\ncontemplation of amendment of rules which was suggested by the IBA\n\nand the Government of India in its communication dated 5.9.2001 so\n\nthat employees were not deprived of the benefit of pension.\n\n49. The question arises in case the bank accepts the proposal of\n\nVRS, and does not alter its rules, can employees be deprived of the\n\nbenefit of pension in such an unconscionable manner over an event on\n\nwhich they had no control. It would be nothing, but an outcome of\n\nunfair and arbitrary act in case the SBI never intended to act upon the\n\nscheme it ought not to have accepted it, and once it approved VRS, it\n\nwas incumbent upon it to amend its rule, if necessary, as was done by\n\nother banks in 2002 after scheme worked out in the year 2000. Even\n\notherwise once it accepted the proposal of the Government of India, it\n\nwould be violative of provisions of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n to permit it to\n\nwriggle out of its obligation under the guise that the bank did not\n\namend its rules or pension was not admissible as per existing rules,\n\nmainly when the scheme provided for eligibility for pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years, that formed independent contract. If the bank\n\n\f 46\n\nis permitted to get rid of the scheme due to Rule position, then the\n\nscheme itself would become void and unenforceable. Bank cannot act\n\nin a fanciful manner, particularly with respect to retirement under\n\nVRS which was contractual and deny benefit of pension, a right\n\naccrued to the employees for receiving the pension in view of the\n\nmemorandum and the resolution passed by the Central Board of\n\nDirectors adopting memorandum and the SBI­VRS.\n\n50. (a). The rights under contract cannot be taken away, and they\n\nbecome enforceable by a court of law. Bank cannot be permitted to\n\nmake a representation and later on wriggle out of its obligation. It is\n\nnot permissible to make a “misrepresentation”. Under \nsection 19\n of\n\nthe Contract Act, when consent is obtained by coercion, fraud, or\n\n‘misrepresentation,' the agreement is voidable at the option of the\n\naggrieved party. \nIn \nCentral Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. &\n\nAnr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr.\n, (1986) 3 SCC 156, this Court\n\nconsidered the contract of employment between the Central Inland\n\nWater Transport Corporation and its employees and also the rules. In\n\nthat context, observed thus:\n\n “75. Under \nSection 19\n of the Indian Contract Act, when\n consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or\n misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the\n option of the party whose consent was so caused. It is not the\n case of either of the contesting respondents that there was any\n coercion brought to bear upon him or that any fraud or\n misrepresentation had been practiced upon him. Under\n \nSection 19\n­A, when consent to an agreement is caused by\n\n\f 47\n\n undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the\n option of the party whose consent was so caused and the court\n may set aside any such contract either absolutely or if the\n party who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit\n thereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the court\n may seem just. Sub­section (1) of \nSection 16\n defines \"Undue\n influence\" as follows:\n\n “16. ‘Undue influence’ defined.—(1) A contract is said to be\n induced by ‘undue influence’ where the relations subsisting\n between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a\n position to dominate the will of the other and uses that\n position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.”\n The material provisions of sub­section (2) of \nSection 16\n are as\n follows:\n\n “(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of\n the foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position\n to dominate the will of another—\n\n (a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the\n other ....”\n We need not trouble ourselves with the other sections of the\n \nIndian Contract Act\n except \nSections 23\n and \n24\n. \nSection 23\n\n states that the consideration or object of an agreement is\n lawful unless inter alia the court regards it as opposed to\n public policy. This section further provides that every\n agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is\n void. Under \nSection 24\n, if any part of a single consideration for\n one or more objects, or anyone or any part of any one of\n several considerations for a single object is unlawful, the\n agreement is void. The agreement is, however, not always void\n in its entirety for it is well settled that if several distinct\n promises are made for one and the same lawful consideration,\n and one or more of them be such as the law will not enforce,\n that will not of itself prevent the rest from being enforceable.\n\n The general rule was stated by Willes, J., in Pickering v.\n Ilfracombe Ry. Co. (1868) LR 3 CP 235 (at p. 250) as follows:\n\n \"The general rule is that, where you cannot sever the illegal\n from the legal part of a covenant, the contract is altogether\n void; but where you can sever them, whether the illegality be\n created by statute or by the common law, you may reject the\n bad part and retain the good.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n(b). \nIn \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra), this Court considered the concept\n\nof unconscionable bargain and as to actions showing no regard for\n\nconscience; irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable, observed\n\nthus:\n\n\f 48\n\n “76. Under which head would an unconscionable bargain fall?\n If it falls under the head of undue influence, it would be\n voidable but if it falls under the head of being opposed to\n public policy, it would be void. No case of the type before us\n appears to have fallen for decision under the law of contracts\n before any court in India nor has any case on all fours of a\n court in any other country been pointed out to us. The word\n “unconscionable” is defined in the Shorter Oxford English\n Dictionary, Third Edition, Volume II, page 2288, when used\n with reference to actions, etc. as \"showing no regard for\n conscience; irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.\" An\n unconscionable bargain would, therefore, be one which is\n irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n(c). Chitty on Contracts was referred in \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra)\n\nabout the old ideas of freedom of contract in modern times, 25 th Edn.,\n\nVol. 1, para 4, Chitty observed:\n\n “79. In this connection, it is useful to note what Chitty has to\n say about the old ideas of freedom of contract in modern\n times. The relevant passages are to be found in Chitty on\n Contracts, 25th Edn., Vol. I, in paragraph 4, and are as\n follows:\n\n \"These ideas have to a large extent lost their appeal today.\n 'Freedom of contract,' it has been said, 'is a reasonable social\n ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power\n between contracting parties can be assumed, and no injury is\n done to the economic interests of the community at large.'\n Freedom of contract is of little value when one party has no\n alternative between accepting a set of terms proposed by the\n other or doing without the goods or services offered. Many\n contracts entered into by public utility undertakings and\n others take the form of a set of terms fixed in advance by one\n party and not open to discussion by the other. These are called\n 'contracts d’adhesion’ by French lawyers. Traders frequently\n contract, not on individually negotiated terms, but on those\n contained in a standard form of contract settled by a trade\n association. And the terms of an employee’s contract of\n employment may be determined by agreement between his\n trade union and his employer, or by a statutory scheme of\n employment. Such transactions are nevertheless contracts\n notwithstanding that freedom of contract is to a great extent\n lacking.\n\n Where freedom of contract is absent, the disadvantages\n to consumers or members of the public have, to some extent,\n been offset by administrative procedures for consultation, and\n\n\f 49\n\nby legislation. Many statutes introduce terms into contracts\nwhich the parties are forbidden to exclude, or declare that\ncertain provisions in a contract shall be void. And the courts\nhave developed a number of devices for refusing to implement\nexemption clauses imposed by the economically stronger party\non the weaker, although they have not recognized in\nthemselves any general power (except by statute) to declare\nbroadly that an exemption clause will not be enforced unless it\nis reasonable. Again, more recently, certain of the judges\nappear to have recognized the possibility of relief from\ncontractual obligations on the ground of 'inequality of\nbargaining power.'\"\n\nWhat the French call “contracts d’adhesion,\" the American call\n\"adhesion contracts\" or \"contracts of adhesion.\" An \"adhesion\ncontract\" is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary. 5th Edn., at\npage 38, as follows:\n\n “Adhesion contract.—Standardized contract form offered to\nconsumers of goods and services on essentially ‘take it or leave\nit’ basis without affording consumer realistic opportunity to\nbargain and under such conditions that consumer cannot\nobtain desired product or services except by acquiescing in\nform contract. Distinctive feature of adhesion contract is that\nweaker party has no realistic choice as to its terms. Not every\nsuch contract is unconscionable.”\n\n 80. The position under the American law is stated in\nReinstatement of the Law — Second as adopted and\npromulgated by the American Law Institute, Volume II which\ndeals with the law of contracts, in \nSection 208\n at page 107, as\nfollows:\n\n “§ 208. Unconscionable Contract or Term\n If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the\ntime the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the\ncontract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without\nthe unconscionable term, or may so limit the application of\nany unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable\nresult.”\nIn the Comments given under that section, it is stated at page\n107:\n\n “Like the obligation of good faith and fair dealing (§ 205),\nthe policy against unconscionable contracts or terms applies to\na wide variety of types of conduct. The determination that a\ncontract or term is or is not unconscionable is made in the\nlight of its setting, purpose and effect. Relevant factors include\nweaknesses in the contracting process like those involved in\nmore specific rules as to contractual capacity, fraud and other\ninvalidating causes; the policy also overlaps with rules which\nrender particular bargains or terms unenforceable on grounds\nof public policy. Policing against unconscionable contracts or\nterms has sometimes been accomplished by adverse\nconstruction of language, by manipulation of the rules of offer\n\n\f 50\n\nand acceptance or by determinations that the clause is contrary\nto public policy or to the dominant purpose of the contract.\nUniform Commercial Code § 2­302 Comment 1 .... A bargain is\nnot unconscionable merely because the parties to it are\nunequal in bargaining position, nor even because the\ninequality results in an allocation of risks to the weaker party.\nBut gross inequality of bargaining power, together with terms\nunreasonably favourable to the stronger party , may confirm\nindications that the transaction involved elements of deception\nor compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no\nmeaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact assent\nor appear to assent to the unfair terms.”\n (emphasis supplied)\nThere is a statute in the United States called the Universal\nCommercial Code, which applies to contracts relating to sales\nof goods. Though this statute is inapplicable to contracts not\ninvolving sales of goods, it has proved very influential in what\nis called in the United States, \"non­sales\" cases. It has many\ntimes been used either by analogy or because it was felt to\nembody a generally accepted social attitude of fairness going\nbeyond its statutory application to sales of goods. In the\nReporter's Note to said \nSection 208\n, it is stated at p. 112:\n \"It is to be emphasized that a contract of adhesion is not\nunconscionable per se, and that all unconscionable contracts\nare not contracts of adhesion. Nonetheless, the more\nstandardised the agreement and the less a party may bargain\nmeaningfully, the more susceptible the contract or a term will be\nto a claim of unconscionability.”\n (emphasis supplied)\nThe position has been thus summed up by John R. Peden in\n‘The Law of Unjust Contracts’ published by Butterworths in\n1982, at pages 28­29:\n\n “... Unconscionability represents the end of a cycle\ncommencing with the Aristotelian concept of justice and the\nRoman law laesio enormis, which in turn formed the basis for\nthe medieval church’s concept of a just price and\ncondemnation of usury. These philosophies permeated the\nexercise, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of\nthe Chancery court’s discretionary powers under which it\nupset all kinds of unfair transactions. Subsequently the\nmovement towards economic individualism in the nineteenth\ncentury hardened the exercise of these powers by emphasising\nthe freedom of the parties to make their own contract. While\nthe principle of pacta sunt servanda held dominance, the\nconsensual theory still recognized exceptions where one party\nwas overborne by a fiduciary, or entered a contract under\nduress or as the result of fraud. However, these exceptions\nwere limited and had to be strictly proved.\n\n It is suggested that the judicial and legislative trend during\nthe last 30 years in both civil and common law jurisdictions\nhas almost brought the wheel full circle. Both courts and\n\n\f 51\n\n parliaments have provided greater protection for weaker\n parties from harsh contracts. In several jurisdictions this\n included a general power to grant relief from unconscionable\n contracts, thereby providing a launching point from which the\n courts have the opportunity to develop a modern doctrine of\n unconscionability. American decisions on \nArticle 2.302\n of the\n UCC have already gone some distance into this new arena....”\n The expression “laesio enormis” used in the above passage\n refers to “laesio ultra dimidium vel enormis” which in Roman\n law meant the injury sustained by one of the parties to an\n onerous contract when he had been overreached by the other\n to the extent of more than one­half of the value of the subject­\n matter, as for example, when a vendor had not received half\n the value of property sold, or the purchaser had paid more\n than double value. The maxim “pacta sunt servanda\" referred\n to in the above passage, means \"contracts are to be kept.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n This Court held that due to inequality of bargaining power,\n\nunreasonable terms, unreasonable favour to the stronger party may\n\ninvolve an element of deception or compulsion, or may show that the\n\nweaker party had no meaningful choice. The Court in \nBrojo Nath\n\nGanguly\n (supra) also observed that in the sphere of the law of\n\ncontract, the test of reasonableness or fairness has emerged. Even an\n\nunreasonable clause cannot be enforced as that would be\n\nunconscionable.\n\n Here the reasonable construction in the matter is that the\n\npension is clearly admissible as per the resolution passed by the\n\nCentral Board of Directors of SBI, which is sought to be denied, it was\n\nfor SBI to amend Rules. Such an action would be unconscionable, and\n\ncourts cannot be said to be powerless in such a situation to enforce\n\nthe SBI VRS with an obligation to make payment of pension.\n\n\f 52\n\n(d). This Court considered the enforcement of unreasonable\n\ncontracts and enforceability thereof in \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra)\n\nthus:\n\n “83. Yet another theory which has made its emergence in\n recent years in the sphere of the law of contracts is the test of\n reasonableness or fairness of a clause in a contract where\n there is inequality of bargaining power. Lord Denning, MR,\n appears to have been the propounder, and perhaps the\n originator —at least in England, of this theory. In Gillespie\n Brothers & Co. Ltd. v. Roy Bowles Transport Ltd., (1973) QB\n 400, where the question was whether an indemnity clause in a\n contract, on its true construction, relieved the indemnifier\n from liability arising to the indemnified from his own\n negligence, Lord Denning said (at pages 415­416):\n\n “The time may come when this process of ‘construing’ the\n contract can be pursued no further. The words are too clear to\n permit of it. Are the courts then powerless? Are they to permit\n the party to enforce his unreasonable clause, even when it is so\n unreasonable, or applied so unreasonably, as to be\n unconscionable? When it gets to this point, I would say, as I\n said many years ago:\n\n ‘there is the vigilance of the common law which, while\n allowing freedom of contract, watches to see that it is not\n abused’: John Lee & Son (Grantham) Ltd. v. Railway Executive,\n (1949) 2 All ER 581.\n\n It will not allow a party to exempt himself from his liability at\n common law when it would be quite unconscionable for him to\n do so.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n In the above case, the Court of Appeal negatived the defense of\n the indemnifier that the indemnity clause did not cover the\n negligence of the indemnified. It was in Lloyds Bank Ltd. v.\n Bundy (1974) 3 All ER 757 that Lord Denning first clearly\n enunciated his theory of \"inequality of bargaining power.\" He\n began his discussion on this part of the case by stating (at\n page 763) :\n\n “There are cases in our books in which the courts will set aside\n a contract, or a transfer of property, when the parties have not\n met on equal terms, when the one is so strong in bargaining\n power and the other so weak that, as a matter of common\n fairness, it is not right that the strong should be allowed to push\n the weak to the wall. Hitherto those exceptional cases have\n been treated each as a separate category in itself. But I think\n the time has come when we should seek to find a principle to\n\n\f 53\n\n unite them. I put on one side contracts or transactions which\n are voidable for fraud or misrepresentation or mistake. All\n those are governed by settled principles. I go only to those\n where there has been inequality of bargaining power, such as\n to merit the intervention of the court.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n He then referred to various categories of cases and ultimately\n deduced therefrom a general principle in these words (at page\n\n 765):\n\n “Gathering all together, I would suggest that through all\n these instances there runs a single thread. They rest on\n ‘inequality of bargaining power.' By virtue of it, the English law\n gives relief to one who, without independent advice, enters into\n a contract on terms which are very unfair or transfers property\n for a consideration which is grossly inadequate, when his\n bargaining power is grievously impaired by reason of his own\n needs or desires, or by his own ignorance or infirmity, coupled\n with undue influences or pressures brought to bear on him by\n or for the benefit of the other. When I use the word 'undue,' I\n do not mean to suggest that the principle depends on proof of\n any wrongdoing. The one who stipulates for an unfair\n advantage may be moved solely by his own self­interest,\n unconscious of the distress he is bringing to the other. I have\n also avoided any reference to the will of the one being\n ‘dominated’ or ‘overcome’ by the other. One who is in extreme\n need may knowingly consent to a most improvident bargain,\n solely to relieve the straits in which he finds himself. Again, I do\n not mean to suggest that every transaction is saved by\n independent advice. But the absence of it may be fatal. With\n these explanations, I hope this principle will be found to\n reconcile the cases.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n(e). The Court clearly held that the contracts, which are the outcome\n\nof misrepresentation, cannot be enforced, and inequality of bargaining\n\npower merit the intervention of the court. In A. Schroeder Music\n\nPublishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay (formerly Instone) (1974) 1 WLR 1308,\n\nLord Diplock made the following observations at pp. 1315­16 thus:\n\n \"84. …. \"My Lords, the contract under consideration in this\n appeal is one whereby the respondent accepted restrictions\n upon the way in which he would exploit his earning power as a\n songwriter for the next ten years. Because this can be\n\n\f 54\n\n classified as a contract in restraint of trade the restrictions\n that the respondent accepted fell within one of those limited\n categories of contractual promises in respect of which the\n courts still retain the power to relieve the promisor of his legal\n duty to fulfill them. In order to determine whether this case is\n one in which that power ought to be exercised, what your\n Lordships have in fact been doing has been to assess the\n relative bargaining power of the publisher and the songwriter\n at the time the contract was made and to decide whether the\n publisher had used his superior bargaining power to exact\n from the songwriter promises that were unfairly onerous to\n him. Your Lordships have not been concerned to inquire\n whether the public have in fact been deprived of the fruit of the\n song writer's talents by reason of the restrictions, nor to\n assess the likelihood that they would be so deprived in the\n future if the contract were permitted to run its full course.\n It is, in my view, salutary to acknowledge that in refusing to\n enforce provisions of a contract whereby one party agrees for\n the benefit of the other party to exploit or to refrain from\n exploiting his own earning power, the public policy which the\n court is implementing is not some 19th century economic\n theory about the benefit to the general public of freedom of\n trade, but the protection of those whose bargaining power is\n weak against being forced by those whose bargaining power is\n stronger to enter into bargains that are unconscionable. Under\n the influence of Bentham and of laissez faire the courts in the\n 19th century abandoned the practice of applying the public\n policy against unconscionable bargains to contracts generally,\n as they had formerly done to any contract considered to be\n usurious; but the policy survived in its application to penalty\n clauses and to relief against forfeiture and also to the special\n category of contracts in restraint of trade. If one looks at the\n reasoning of 19th­century judges in cases about contracts in\n restraint of trade one finds lip service paid to current economic\n theories, but if one looks at what they said in the light of what\n they did, one finds that they struck down a bargain if they\n thought it was unconscionable as between the parties to it and\n upheld it if they thought that it was not.\n\n So I would hold that the question to be answered as respects\n a contract in restraint of trade of the kind with which this\n appeal is concerned is: ‘Was the bargain fair?’ The test of\n fairness is, no doubt, whether the restrictions are both\n reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate\n interests of the promisee and commensurate with the benefits\n secured to the promisor under the contract. For the purpose of\n this test, all the provisions of the contract must be taken into\n consideration.”\n\n(f). A term which exempts the stronger party from his ordinary\n\ncommon law liability should not be given effect except when it is\n\n\f 55\n\nreasonable, as observed in Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Co. Ltd.,\n\n(1949) 2 All ER 581 at 584 relied upon in \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra)\n\nthus:\n\n “85. The observations of Lord Denning, M.R., in\n Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Co. Ltd. are also useful\n and require to be quoted. These observations are as\n follows (at page 79) :\n\n \n\"In such circumstances as here the Law Commission in\n 1975 recommended that a term which exempts the stronger\n party from his ordinary common law liability should not be\n given effect except when it is reasonable: see The Law\n Commission and the Scottish Law Commission Report,\n Exemption Clauses, Second Report (1975) (August 5, 1975),\n Law Com. No. 69 (H.C. 605), pp. 62, 174; and there is a Bill\n now before Parliament, which gives effect to the test of\n reasonableness. This is a gratifying piece of law reform: but I\n do not think we need wait for that Bill to be passed into law.\n You never know what may happen to a Bill. Meanwhile, the\n common law has its own principles ready to hand. In Gillespie\n Bros. & \nCo. Ltd. v. Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.\n (1973) QB 400, I\n suggested that an exemption or limitation clause should not be\n given effect if it was unreasonable, or if it would be\n unreasonable to apply it in the circumstances of the case. I see\n no reason why this should not be applied today, at any rate in\n contracts in standard forms where there is inequality of\n bargaining power.”\n\n(g). Courts have to construe the contracts according to the tenor. \nIn\n\nthis regard, in \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra), the Court considered the\n\nquestion thus:\n\n “87. In Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport\n Ltd. (1980) AC 827, a case before the Unfair Contract\n Terms Act, 1977, was enacted, the House of Lords upheld\n an exemption clause in a contract on the defendants'\n printed form containing standard conditions. The\n decision appears to proceed on the ground that the\n parties were businessmen and did not possess unequal\n bargaining power. The House of Lords did not, in that\n case, reject the test of reasonableness or fairness of a\n clause in a contract where the parties are not equal in\n bargaining position. On the contrary, the speeches of\n Lord Wilberforce, Lord Diplock, and Lord Scarman would\n\n\f 56\n\nseem to show that the House of Lords in a fit case would\naccept that test. Lord Wilberforce, in his speech, after\nreferring to the Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977, said (at\npage 843) :\n\n “\nThis Act\n applies to consumer contracts and those based\non standard terms and enables exception clauses to be applied\nwith regard to what is just and reasonable. It is significant that\nParliament refrained from legislating over the whole field of\ncontract. After this Act, in commercial matters generally, when\nthe parties are not of unequal bargaining power, and when\nrisks are normally borne by insurance, not only is the case for\njudicial intervention undemonstrated, but there is everything\nto be said, and this seems to have been Parliament’s intention,\nfor leaving the parties free to apportion the risks as they think\nfit and for respecting their decisions.”\n (emphasis supplied)\nLord Diplock said (at page 850­51):\n\n “Since the obligations implied by law in a commercial\ncontract are those which, by judicial consensus over the years\nor by Parliament in passing a statute, have been regarded as\nobligations which a reasonable businessman would realise that\nhe was accepting when he entered into a contract of a particular\nkind, the court’s view of the reasonableness of any departure\nfrom the implied obligations which would be involved in\nconstruing the express words of an exclusion clause in one\nsense that they are capable of bearing rather than another, is\na relevant consideration in deciding what meaning the words\nwere intended by the parties to bear.”\n (emphasis supplied)\nLord Scarman, while agreeing with Lord Wilberforce, described\n(at page 853) the action out of which the appeal before the\nHouse had arisen as “a commercial dispute between parties\nwell able to look after themselves” and then added: “In such a\nsituation what the parties agreed (expressly or impliedly) is\nwhat matters, and the duty of the courts is to construe their\ncontract according to its tenor.\"\n\n 88. As seen above, apart from judicial decisions, the United\nStates and the United Kingdom have statutorily recognised, at\nleast in certain areas of the law of contracts, that there can be\nunreasonableness (or lack of fairness, if one prefers that\nphrase) in a contract or a clause in a contract where there is\ninequality of bargaining power between the parties although\narising out of circumstances not within their control or as a\nresult of situations not of their creation. Other legal systems\nalso permit judicial review of a contractual transaction entered\ninto in similar circumstances. For example, \nSection 138(2)\n of\nthe German Civil Code provides that a transaction is void\n\"when a person\" exploits \"the distressed situation,\ninexperience, lack of judgmental ability, or grave weakness of\n\n\f 57\n\n will of another to obtain the grant or promise of pecuniary\n advantages ... which are obviously disproportionate to the\n performance given in return\". The position, according to the\n French law, is very much the same.\"\n\n(h). \nIn \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra), it was pointed out what court\n\nshould do in such a matter thus:\n\n “89. Should then our courts not advance with the times?\n Should they still continue to cling to outmoded concepts\n and outworn ideologies? Should we not adjust our\n thinking caps to match the fashion of the day? Should all\n jurisprudential development pass us by, leaving us\n floundering in the sloughs of 19th­century theories?\n Should the strong be permitted to push the weak to the\n wall? Should they be allowed to ride roughshod over the\n weak? Should the courts sit back and watch supinely\n while the strong trample underfoot the rights of the\n weak? We have a Constitution for our country. Our\n judges are bound by their oath to \"uphold the\n Constitution and the laws.\" The Constitution was enacted\n to secure to all the citizens of this country social and\n economic justice. \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution\n guarantees to all persons equality before the law and the\n equal protection of the laws. The principle deducible from\n the above discussions on this part of the case is in\n consonance with right and reason, intended to secure\n social and economic justice and conforms to the mandate\n of the great equality clause in \nArticle 14.\n This principle is\n that the courts will not enforce and will, when called\n upon to do so, strike down an unfair and unreasonable\n contract, or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a\n contract, entered into between parties who are not equal\n in bargaining power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive\n list of all bargains of this type. No court can visualize the\n different situations which can arise in the affairs of men.\n One can only attempt to give some illustrations. For\n instance, the above principle will apply where the\n inequality of bargaining power is the result of the great\n disparity in the economic strength of the contracting\n parties. It will apply where the inequality is the result of\n circumstances, whether of the creation of the parties or\n not. It will apply to situations in which the weaker party\n is in a position in which he can obtain goods or services\n or means of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by\n the stronger party or go without them. It will also apply\n\n\f 58\n\n where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful\n choice, but to give his assent to a contract or to sign on\n the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or to\n accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however\n unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a clause in\n that contract or form or rules may be. This principle,\n however, will not apply where the bargaining power of the\n contracting parties is equal or almost equal. This\n principle may not apply where both parties are\n businessmen, and the contract is a commercial\n transaction. In today’s complex world of giant\n corporations with their vast infrastructural organizations\n and with the State through its instrumentalities and\n agencies entering into almost every branch of industry\n and commerce, there can be myriad situations which\n result in unfair and unreasonable bargains between\n parties possessing wholly disproportionate and unequal\n bargaining power. These cases can neither be\n enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court must judge\n each case on its own facts and circumstances.”\n\n(i). The Court in \nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n (supra) held that the contract,\n\nwhich affected a large number of persons if they are unconscionable,\n\nunfair, and unreasonable, the contract is voidable. The court would\n\nnot compel each person with whom the party with superior bargaining\n\npower had contracted to go to court to adjudge the contract voidable\n\nand would result in a multiplicity of litigation. It observed:\n\n “91. Is a contract of the type mentioned above to be adjudged\n voidable or void? If it was induced by undue influence, then\n under \nSection 19\n­\nA of the Indian Contract Act\n, it would be\n voidable. It is, however, rarely that contracts of the types to\n which the principle formulated by us above applies are\n induced by undue influence as defined by \nSection 16(1)\n of the\n Indian Contract Act, even though at times they are between\n parties one of whom holds a real or apparent authority over\n the other. In the vast majority of cases, however, such\n contracts are entered into by the weaker party under pressure\n of circumstances, generally economic, which results in\n inequality of bargaining power. Such contracts will not fall\n within the four corners of the definition of “undue influence”\n given in \nSection 16(1)\n. Further, the majority of such contracts\n are in a standard or prescribed form or consist of a set of\n\n\f 59\n\n rules. They are not contracts between individuals containing\n terms meant for those individuals alone. Contracts in\n prescribed or standard forms or which embody a set of rules\n as part of the contract are entered into by the party with\n superior bargaining power with a large number of persons who\n have far less bargaining power or no bargaining power at all.\n Such contracts which affect a large number of persons or a\n group or groups of persons, if they are unconscionable, unfair,\n and unreasonable, are injurious to the public interest. To say\n that such a contract is only voidable would be to compel each\n person with whom the party with superior bargaining power\n had contracted to go to court to have the contract adjudged\n voidable. This would only result in multiplicity of litigation,\n which no court should encourage and would also not be in the\n public interest. Such a contract or such a clause in a contract\n ought, therefore, to be adjudged void. While the law of\n contracts in England is mostly judge­made, the law of\n contracts in India is enacted in a statute, namely, the \nIndian\n Contract Act, 1872\n. In order that such a contract should be\n void, it must fall under one of the relevant sections of the\n \nIndian Contract Act\n. The only relevant provision in the \nIndian\n Contract Act\n, which can apply is \nSection 23\n, when it states\n that \"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful,\n unless ... the court regards it as ... opposed to public policy.\"\n\n(j). The Court also considered the “public policy”. The same is not the\n\npolicy of a particular Government. It connotes some matter which\n\nconcerns the public good and the public interest. Action has to be\n\nsubservient to public policy. This Court in the context of \nContract Act\n\nand Public Policy made the following observations:\n\n “92. \nThe Indian Contract Act\n does not define the\n expression \"public policy\" or \"opposed to public policy.\"\n From the very nature of things, the expressions \"public\n policy,\" \"opposed to public policy,\" or \"contrary to public\n policy\" are incapable of precise definition. Public policy,\n however, is not the policy of a particular government. It\n connotes some matter which concerns the public good\n and the public interest. The concept of what is for the\n public good or in the public interest or what would be\n injurious or harmful to the public good or the public\n interest has varied from time to time. As new concepts\n take the place of old, transactions which were once\n considered against public policy are now being upheld by\n the courts, and similarly, where there has been a well­\n\n\f 60\n\nrecognized head of public policy, the courts have not\nshirked from extending it to new transactions and\nchanged circumstances and have at times not even\nflinched from inventing a new head of public policy. There\nare two schools of thought— \"the narrow view\" school\nand \"the broad view\" school. According to the former,\ncourts cannot create new heads of public policy, whereas\nthe latter countenances judicial law­making in this area.\nThe adherents of \"the narrow view\" school would not\ninvalidate a contract on the ground of public policy\nunless that particular ground had been well­established\nby authorities. Hardly ever has the voice of the timorous\nspoken more clearly and loudly than in these words of\nLord Davey in Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Gold\nMines Ltd.: \"Public policy is always an unsafe and\ntreacherous ground for legal decision.\" That was in the\nyear 1902. Seventy­eight years earlier, Burrough, J., in\nRichardson v. Mellish, (1824­34) All ER 258, described\npublic policy as \"a very unruly horse, and when once you\nget astride it you never know where it will carry you.\" \nThe\nMaster of the Rolls, Lord Denning, however, was not a\nman to shy away from unmanageable horses and in\nwords which conjure up before our eyes the picture of the\nyoung Alexander the Great taming Bucephalus, he said\nin \nEnderby Town Football Club Ltd. v. Football Assn. Ltd.\n\n(1971) Ch 591: \"With a good man in the saddle, the\nunruly horse can be kept in control. It can jump over\nobstacles.\" Had the timorous always held the field, not\nonly the doctrine of public policy but even the Common\nLaw or the principles of Equity would never have evolved.\n\nSir William Holdsworth in his \"History of English Law,\"\n\nVolume III, page 55, has said:\n\n \"In fact, a body of law like the common law, which has\ngrown up gradually with the growth of the nation, necessarily\nacquires some fixed principles, and if it is to maintain these\nprinciples, it must be able, on the ground of public policy or\nsome other like ground, to suppress practices which, under\never new disguises, seek to weaken or negative them.\"\n\nIt is thus clear that the principles governing public policy must\nbe and are capable, on proper occasion, of expansion or\nmodification. Practices which were considered perfectly normal\nat one time have today become obnoxious and oppressive to\npublic conscience. If there is no head of public policy which\ncovers a case, then the court must in consonance with public\nconscience and in keeping with public good and public interest\ndeclare such practice to be opposed to public policy. Above all,\nin deciding any case which may not be covered by authority,\nour courts have before them the beacon light of the Preamble\nto the Constitution. Lacking precedent, the court can always\n\n\f 61\n\n be guided by that light and the principles underlying the\n Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles enshrined in\n our Constitution.\n\n 93. The normal rule of Common Law has been that a party\n who seeks to enforce an agreement which is opposed to public\n policy will be non­suited. The case of A. Schroeder Music\n Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay (1974) 1 WLR 1308, however,\n establishes that where a contract is vitiated as being contrary\n to public policy, the party adversely affected by it can sue to\n have it declared void. The case may be different, where the\n purpose of the contract is illegal or immoral. \nIn \nKedar Nath\n Motani v. Prahlad Rai\n, AIR 1960 SC 213, reversing the High\n Court and restoring the decree passed by the trial court\n declaring the appellants’ title to the lands in suit and directing\n the respondents who were the appellants’ benamidars to\n restore possession, this Court, after discussing the English\n and Indian law on the subject, said: (at page 873) :\n\n \"The correct position in law, in our opinion, is that what\n one has to see is whether the illegality goes so much to the\n root of the matter that the plaintiff cannot bring his action\n without relying upon the illegal transaction into which he had\n entered. If the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated by\n Williston and the plaintiff is not required to rest his case upon\n that illegality, then public policy demands that the defendant\n should not be allowed to take advantage of the position. A\n strict view, of course, must be taken of the plaintiff's conduct,\n and he should not be allowed to circumvent the illegality by\n resorting to some subterfuge or by misstating the facts. If,\n however, the matter is clear and the illegality is not required to\n be pleaded or proved as part of the cause of action, and the\n plaintiff recanted before the illegal purpose was achieved, then,\n unless it be of such a gross nature as to outrage the\n conscience of the court, the plea of the defendant should not\n prevail.\"\n\n The types of contracts to which the principle formulated by us\n above applies are not contracts which are tainted with illegality\n but are contracts which contain terms which are so unfair and\n unreasonable that they shock the conscience of the court.\n They are opposed to public policy and require to be adjudged\n void.”\n\n51. This Court also considered the law of contract and its\n\ninterpretation in changing times in \nDelhi Transport Corporation v.\n\nD.T.C. Mazdoor Congress & Ors.\n, (1991) Supp 1 SCC 600 thus:\n\n\f 62\n\n “279. In paragraph 4 of Chitty on Contracts (25th edn., vol. 1)\n it is stated that \"freedom of contract is a reasonable social\n ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power\n between contracting parties can be assumed and no injury is\n done to the economic interest of the community at large.\"\n\n 280. In Anson’s Law of Contract at pages 6 and 7 stated the\n scope of freedom of contract in the changing circumstances\n thus:\n\n \"Today the position is seen in a very different light. Freedom\n of contract is a reasonable social ideal only to the extent that\n equality of bargaining power between contracting parties can\n be assumed, and no injury is done to the economic interests of\n the community at large. In the more complicated social and\n industrial conditions of a collectivist society, it has ceased to\n have much idealistic attraction. It is now realised that\n economic equality often does not exist in any real sense and\n that individual interests have to be made to subserve those of\n the community hence there has been a fundamental change\n both in our social outlook and in the policy of the legislature\n towards contract and the law today interferes at numerous\n points with the freedom of the parties to make what contract\n they like. The relation between employers and employed, for\n example, have been regulated by statutes designed to ensure\n that the employee’s condition of work are safe, that he is\n properly protected against redundancy, and that he knows his\n terms of service. The public has been protected against\n economic pressure by such measures as the Rent Acts, the\n Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act, the Consumer Credit\n Act, and other similar enactments. These legislative provisions\n will override any contrary terms which the parties may make\n for themselves. Further, the legislature has intervened in the\n Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, and the Fair Trading Act,\n 1973 to promote competition in industry and to safeguard the\n interests of consumers. This intervention is specially necessary\n today when most contracts entered by ordinary people are not\n the result of individual negotiation. It is not possible for a\n private person to settle the terms of his agreement with a\n British Railways Board or with a local electricity authority.”\n The 'standard form' contract is the rule. He must either accept\n the terms of this contract in toto or go without. Since,\n however, it is not feasible to deprive oneself of such necessary\n services, the individual is compelled to accept on those terms.\n In view of this fact, it is quite clear that freedom of contract is\n now largely an illusion.\"\n\n52. (a). It has been emphasised in \nD.T.C.\n (supra) that the period of\n\ncontract is to be reasonable and the employee has a right to know the\n\n\f 63\n\nconditions of work and he is properly protected against redundancy.\n\nApproving decision in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd.\n\n& Anr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. (1983) 3 SCC 156 Court held\n\nthus:\n\n “282. \nIn \nBrojo Nath\n case (1986) 3 SCC 156, Madon, J.\n elaborately considered the development of law relating to\n unfair or unreasonable terms of the contract or clauses thereof\n in extenso, and it is unnecessary for me to traverse the same\n grounds once over. The learned Judge also considered the\n arbitrary, unfair, and unbridled power on the anvil of\n distributive justice or justness or fairness of the procedure\n envisaged therein. The relevant case law in that regard was\n dealt with in extenso in the light of the development of law in\n the Supreme Court of United States of America and the House\n of Lords in England and in the continental countries. To avoid\n needless burden on the judgment, I do not repeat the same\n reasoning. I entirely agree with the reasoning, and the\n conclusions reached therein on all these aspects.\"\n\n(b). This Court in \nD.T.C.\n (supra) with respect to the alteration of\n\nGovernment contracts and the right of the State to impose\n\nunconstitutional conditions, observed:\n\n “283. The problem also could be broached from the angle\n whether the State can impose unconstitutional conditions as\n part of the contract or statute or rule etc. In (1959­60) 73\n Harvard Law Review, in the Note under the caption\n ‘Unconstitutional Condition’ at pages 1595­96 it is postulated\n that the State is devoid of power to impose unconstitutional\n conditions in the contract that the power to withhold largesse\n has been asserted by the State in four areas i.e. (1) regulating\n the right to engage in certain activities; (2) administration of\n government welfare programme; (3) government employment;\n and (4) procurement of contracts. It was further adumbrated\n at pages 1602­03 thus:\n\n \"The sovereign's constitutional authority to choose those with\n whom it will contract for goods and services is, in effect, a\n power to withhold the benefits to be derived from economic\n dealings with the government. As government activity in the\n economic sphere increases, the contracting power enables the\n government to control many hitherto unregulated activities of\n\n\f 64\n\ncontracting parties through the imposition of conditions. Thus,\nregarding the government, as a private entrepreneur, threatens\nto impair constitutional rights. The government, unlike a\nprivate individual, is limited in its ability to contract by the\nConstitution. The federal contracting power is based upon the\nConstitution's authorisation of these acts 'necessary and\nproper' to the carrying out of the functions which it allocates to\nthe national government. Unless the objectives sought by\nterms and conditions in government contracts requiring the\nsurrender of rights are constitutionally authorised, the\nconditions must fall as ultra vires exercise of power.”\n\nAgain at page 1603, it is further emphasised thus:\n “When conditions limit the economic benefits to be derived\nfrom dealings with the government to those who forego the\nexercise of constitutional rights, the exclusion of those\nretaining their rights from participation in the enjoyment of\nthese benefits may be violative of the prohibition, implicit in\nthe due process clause of Fifth Amendment and explicit in the\nequal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against\nunreasonable discrimination in the governmental bestow of\nadvantages. Finally, disabling those exercising certain rights\nfrom participating in the advantages to be derived from\ncontractual relations with the government may be a form of\npenalty lacking in due process. To avoid invalidation for any of\nthe above reasons, it must be shown that the conditions\nimposed are necessary to secure the legitimate objectives of\nthe contract, ensure its effective use, or protect society from\nthe potential harm which may result from the contractual\nrelationship between the government and the individual.”\n\n284. Professor Guido Calabresi of Yale University Law School\nin his “Retroactivity, Paramount Power and Contractual\nChanges” (1961­62) 71 Yale Law Journal 1191, stated that the\ngovernment can make contracts that are necessary and proper\nfor carrying out any of the specific clauses of the Constitution\nor power to spend for general welfare. The Federal Government\nhas no power, inherent or sovereign, other than those\nspecifically or explicitly granted to it by the Constitution. At\npage 1197, it is further stated thus:\n\n“The government acts according to due process standards for\nthe due process clause is quite up to that task without the\nrule. Alterations of government contracts are not desirable in a\nfree country even when they do not constitute a ‘taking’ of\nproperty or impinge on questions of fundamental fairness of\nthe type comprehended in due process. The government may\nmake changes, but only if war or commerce require them and\nnot on the broader and more ephemeral grounds that the\ngeneral welfare would be served by the change. Any other rule\nwould allow the government to welch almost at will.”\nxxx\n\n\f 65\n\n 286. \nIn \nBrojo Nath\n case (supra, after elaborate consideration of\n the doctrine of “reasonableness or fairness” of the terms and\n conditions of the contract vis­a­vis the relative bargaining\n power of the contracting parties this Court laid down that the\n principles deducible from the discussion made therein is in\n consonance with right or reason intended to secure socio­\n economic justice and conform to mandate of the equality\n clause in \nArticle 14.\n The principle laid was that courts will not\n enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike down an\n unfair and unreasonable contract or an unfair and\n unreasonable clause in a contract, entered into between\n parties who are not equal in bargaining power …. It will apply\n to situations in which the weaker party is in a position in\n which he can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood\n only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go\n without them. It will also apply where a man has no choice, or\n rather no meaningful choice, but to give his assent to a\n contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or\n standard form or to accept a set of rules as part of the\n contract, however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a\n clause in that contract or form or rules may be. This principle,\n however, will not apply where the bargaining power of the\n contracting parties is equal or almost equal or where both\n parties are businessmen, and the contract is a commercial\n transaction.\n\n 287. In today’s complex world of giant corporations with their\n vast infrastructural organisations the State through its\n instrumentalities and agencies has been entering into almost\n every branch of industry and commerce and field of service,\n there can be myriad situations which result in unfair and\n unreasonable bargains between parties possessing wholly\n disproportionate and unequal bargaining power. These cases\n can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court\n must judge each case on its own facts and circumstances.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n The Court held that there can be myriad situations which result in\n\nunfair and unreasonable bargains, which are the outcome of an\n\nunequal bargaining power. Each case has to be seen on its own facts\n\nand circumstances.\n\n(c). \nIn \nD.T.C.\n (supra), the Court also held that \nArticle 14\n sheds light\n\non public policy to curb arbitrariness thus:\n\n\f 66\n\n“294. \nIn \nBasheshar Nath v. CIT\n, AIR 1959 SC 149, S.R. Das,\nC.J. held that \nArticle 14\n is founded on a sound public policy\nrecognised and valued in all States, and it admonishes the\nState when it disregards the obligations imposed upon the\nState.\n\n295. \nIn \nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu\n, (1974) 4 SCC 3,\nBhagwati, J. (as he then was) held that \nArticle 14\n is the genus\nwhile \nArticle 16\n is a specie. \nArticle 16\n gives effect to the\ndoctrine of equality in all matters relating to public\nemployment. The basic principle which, therefore, informs\nboth \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n is equality and inhibition against\ndiscrimination. \"Equality is a dynamic concept with many\naspects and dimensions, and it cannot be “cribbed, cabined\nand confined” within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a\npositivistic point of view, equality is antithetical to\narbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn\nenemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the\nother, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where\nan act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both\naccording to political logic and constitutional law and is\ntherefore violative of \nArticle 14\n, and if it affects any matter\nrelating to public employment, it is also violative of \nArticle 16.\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n strike at arbitrariness in State action and\nensure fairness and equality of treatment. In Maneka Gandhi\ncase (1978) 1 SCC 248, it was further held that the principle of\nreasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an\nessential element of equality or non­arbitrariness pervades\n\nArticle 14\n like a brooding omnipresence. In Ramana case\n(1979) 3 SCC 489, it was held that it is merely a judicial\nformula for determining whether the legislative or executive\naction in question is arbitrary and therefore constituting\ndenial of equality. If the classification is not reasonable and\ndoes not satisfy the two conditions, namely, rational relation\nand nexus, the impugned legislative or executive action would\nplainly be arbitrary, and the guarantees of equality under\n\nArticle 14\n would be breached. Wherever, therefore, there is\narbitrariness in State action, whether it be of legislature or of\nthe executive or of an \"authority\" under \nArticle 12\n, \nArticle 14\n,\n\"immediately springs into action and strikes down such State\naction.\" In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non­\narbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is\na golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of\nthe constitution.\n\n302. \nArticle 14\n is the general principle, while \nArticle 311(2)\n is\na special provision applicable to all civil services under the\nState. \nArticle 311(2)\n embodies the principles of natural justice,\nbut proviso to clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n excludes the operation\nof principles of natural justice engrafted in \nArticle 311(2)\n as an\nexception in the given circumstances enumerated in three\n\n\f 67\n\n clauses of the proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution.\n \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticles 16(1)\n, and \n311\n are to be\n harmoniously interpreted that the proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\n excludes the application of the principles of natural justice as\n an exception; and the applicability of \nArticle 311(2)\n must,\n therefore, be circumscribed to the civil services and be\n construed accordingly. In respect of all other employees\n covered by \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution, the dynamic role of\n \nArticle 14\n and other relevant articles like \nArticle 21\n must be\n allowed to have full play without any inhibition, unless the\n statutory rules themselves, consistent with the mandate of\n \nArticles 14\n, 16\n, 19\n and \n21\n provide, expressly such an\n exception.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n(d). Arbitrariness in State action whether of the legislature or the\n\nexecutive or of an authority under \nArticles 12\n, 14\n and \n21\n comes into\n\nplay to strike down such an action. The Court in \nD.T.C.\n (supra) held\n\nthus:\n\n \n“303. \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n empowers every citizen the right to\n avocation or profession etc. which includes right to be\n continued in employment under the State unless the tenure is\n validly terminated consistent with the scheme enshrined in the\n fundamental rights of the Constitution. Therefore, if any\n procedure is provided for deprivation of the right to\n employment or right to the continued employment till the age\n of superannuation as is a source to right to livelihood, such a\n procedure must be just, fair and reasonable. This Court in\n \nFertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri v. Union of\n India\n (1981) 1 SCC 568, held that \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n confers a\n broad and general right which is available to all persons to do\n works of any particular kind and of their choice. Therefore,\n whenever there is arbitrariness in State action — whether it be\n of the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under\n \nArticle 12\n, \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n spring into action and strikes\n down such an action. The concept of reasonableness and non­\n arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional spectrum and\n is a golden thread which runs through the whole fabric of the\n Constitution. Therefore, the provision of the statute, the\n regulation or the rule which empowers an employer to\n terminate the services of an employee whose service is of an\n indefinite period till he attains the age of superannuation, by\n serving a notice or pay in lieu thereof must be conformable to\n the mandates of \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the\n Constitution. Otherwise, per se, it would be void.\n In Moti Ram\n Deka case, AIR 1964 SC 600, Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then\n\n\f 68\n\n was) after invalidating the Rules 149(3) and 148(3) under\n \nArticle 311(2)\n which are in pari materia with \nRegulation 9(b)\n of\n the Regulations also considered their validity in the light of\n \nArticle 14\n and held thus: (SCR p. 731)\n\n “Therefore, we are satisfied that the challenge to the\n validity of the impugned Rules on the ground that they\n contravene \nArticle 14\n must also succeed.”\n This was on the test of reasonable classification as the\n principle then was applied. Subba Rao, J. (as he then was) in a\n separate but concurring judgment, apart from invalidating the\n rule under \nArticle 311(2)\n also held that the rule infringed\n \nArticle 14\n as well, though there is no elaborate discussion in\n that regard. But, Das Gupta, J. considered elaborately on this\n aspect and held: (SCR p. 770)\n “Applying the principle laid down in the above case to the\n present Rule, I find on the scrutiny of the Rule that it does not\n lay down any principle or policy for guiding the exercise of\n discretion by the authority who will terminate the service in\n the matter of selection or classification. Arbitrary and\n uncontrolled power is left in the authority to select at its will\n any person against whom action will be taken. The rule thus\n enables the authority concerned to discriminate between two\n railway servants to both of whom Rule 148(3) equally applied\n by taking action in one case and not taking it in the other. In\n the absence of any guiding principle in the exercise of the\n discretion by the authority, the Rule has, therefore, to be\n struck down as contravening the requirements of \nArticle 14\n of\n the Constitution.\"\n\n 308. In Ramana case (1979) 3 SCC 489, it has been held\n that: (SCC p. 504, para 10)\n “It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed by\n the rule of law, the executive government or any of its officers\n should possess arbitrary power over the interests of the\n individual.”\n The procedure adopted should match with what justice\n demands. History shows that it is always subtle and insidious\n encroachments made ostensibly for a good cause that\n imperceptibly but surely erode the foundations of liberty.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n(e). An employer cannot act in a manner that is in the negation of just,\n\nfair, and reasonable procedure. The Court held:\n\n “329. I am, therefore, inclined to hold that the courts,\n though, have no power to amend the law by process of\n interpretation but do have power to mend it so as to be in\n\n\f 69\n\n conformity with the intendment of the legislature.\n Doctrine of reading down is one of the principles of\n interpretation of statute in that process. But when the\n offending language used by the legislature is clear,\n precise, and unambiguous, violating the relevant\n provisions in the Constitution, resort cannot be had to\n the doctrine of reading down to blow life into the void law\n to save it from unconstitutionality or to confer\n jurisdiction on the legislature. Similarly, it cannot be\n taken aid of to emasculate the precise, explicit, clear and\n unambiguous language to confer arbitrary, unbridled and\n uncanalised power on an employer which is a negation to\n just, fair and reasonable procedure envisaged under\n \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution and to direct the\n authorities to record reasons, (sic) unknown or\n unintended procedure, in the manner argued by the\n learned counsel for the appellants.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n(f). In D.T.C. (supra) this Court also relied upon S.G. Jaisinghani v.\n\nUnion of India, AIR 1967 SC 1427 :\n\n “331. x x x “In this context it is important to\n emphasise that the absence of arbitrary power is the first\n essential of the rule of law upon which our whole\n constitutional system is based. In a system governed by\n rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive\n authorities, must be confined within defined limits. The\n rule of law from this point of view means that decisions\n should be made by the application of known principles\n and rules and, in general, such decisions should be\n predictable, and the citizen should know where he is. If a\n decision is taken without any principle or without any\n rule, it is unpredictable, and such a decision is the\n antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule\n of law. (See Dicey: Law of the Constitution, 10th edn.,\n Introduction cx.) ‘Law has reached its finest moments,'\n stated Douglas, J. in United States v. Wunderlich 342 US\n 98, ‘when it has freed man from the unlimited discretion\n of some ruler …. Where discretion is absolute, man has\n always suffered.’ It is in this sense that the rule of law\n may be said to be the sworn enemy of caprice. Discretion,\n as Lord Mansfield stated it in classic terms in the case of\n John Wilkes (1770) 4 Burr 2528, ‘means sound discretion\n guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not by\n humour: it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful’”.\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n\f 70\n\n(g). The Court emphasised that the decision has to be predictable\n\nand it cannot be uncertain. The decision has to be taken by\n\napplication of known principles and rules. The exercise of power\n\ncannot be whimsical or capricious. This Court in \nD.T.C.\n (supra) held:\n\n “332. In an appropriate case where there is no sufficient\n evidence available to inflict by way of disciplinary\n measure, penalty of dismissal or removal from service\n and to meet such a situation, it is not as if that the\n authority is lacking any power to make rules or\n regulations to give a notice of opportunity with the\n grounds or the material on records on which it proposed\n to take action, consider the objections and record reasons\n on the basis of which it had taken action and\n communicate the same. However, scanty the material\n may be, it must form foundation. This minimal procedure\n should be made part of the procedure lest the exercise of\n the power is capable of abuse for good as well as for\n whimsical or capricious purposes for reasons best known\n to the authority and not germane for the purpose for\n which the power was conferred. The action based on\n recording reasoning without communication would\n always be viewed with suspicion. Therefore, I hold that\n conferment of power with wide discretion without any\n guidelines, without any just, fair or reasonable procedure\n is constitutionally anathema to \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n, 19(1)(g)\n\n and \n21\n of the Constitution. Doctrine of reading down\n cannot be extended to such a situation.” (emphasis\n supplied)\n\n53. On the basis of aforesaid principles, it is apparent that once the\n\nCentral Board of Directors accepted the memorandum for making\n\npayment of pension, in case it was not accepting the proposal in the\n\nmemorandum, it ought to have said clearly that it was not ready to\n\naccept the proposals of the Government and the IBA and rejects the\n\nsame. Once it approved the proposals referred to in the memorandum,\n\n\f 71\n\nwhich were on the basis of IBA's letter and Government of India's\n\ndecision it was bound to implement it in true letter and spirit. By\n\naccepting the same, binding obligation was created upon the SBI to\n\nmake payment of pension on completion of 15 years of service. It\n\ncannot invalidate its own decision by relying on fact it failed to amend\n\nthe rule, whereas other Banks did it later on with retrospective effect.\n\nThey cannot invalidate otherwise valid decision by virtue of exclusive\n\nsuperior power to amend or not to amend the rule and act unfairly\n\nand make the entire contract unreasonable based on\n\nmisrepresentation. It was open to the Board of Directors to reject the\n\nproposal. Once it accepted the proposal to make payment of pension\n\non completion of 15 years of service as proposed in the memorandum,\n\nthough the scheme is tried to be interpreted by the SBI that pension\n\nwas to be admissible as provided in the rule that refers to\n\nproportionate pension as noted by this Court in \nO.P. Swarnakar &\n\nOrs.\n, (supra), and what was decided by Government of India/IBA, was\n\nnot taken away rather adopted by the Central Board of Directors. The\n\nscheme of contractual nature has to be read in the context and in the\n\nbackdrop of facts and what has been resolved by the Board of\n\nDirectors. There is no ambiguity with respect to the admissibility of\n\npension when the memorandum and the scheme are read together. In\n\ncase of ambiguity and even if two interpretations are possible in the\n\n\f 72\n\nbackdrop of facts of the case, one in favour of the employees has to be\n\nadopted and so­called clarification dated 11.1.2000 even if considered\n\nin the manner so as to deny the benefit of pension, has to be held to\n\nbe unenforceable, illegal and contrary to law.\n\n54. It is apparent from the eligibility clause of the VRS scheme that\n\neligibility is provided for the employees having 15 years of pensionable\n\nservice and they will be entitled for benefits as provided in the scheme.\n\nThe eligibility clause, when read with clauses providing the benefit,\n\ni.e., clauses 5 and 6 of the scheme, leaves no room for any doubt and\n\nmakes it clear that employees with 15 years of service were treated as\n\neligible to claim the benefit of the scheme floated by SBI. It was not\n\nthe provision in the VRS scheme that incumbents having completed\n\n20 years of service would be entitled for pensionary benefits. The\n\nscheme was carved out specially for attracting the employees by\n\nproviding pension and other benefits to eligible persons like ex gratia,\n\ngratuity, pension and leave encashment. Deprivation of pension would\n\nmake them ineligible for the benefits and would run repugnant to the\n\neligibility clause.\n\n55. The submission raised on behalf of the SBI that the draft scheme\n\nnowhere stipulated that 15 years’ service would be the eligibility or\n\nthat on completion of 15 years' service, the incumbent would be\n\n\f 73\n\neligible for pension, is factually incorrect. It is apparent from the\n\nmaterial circumstances, documents, and correspondence that the\n\ndecision was taken at all levels including the one by the Central Board\n\nof Directors of SBI, that the benefit of pension was to be given to the\n\nemployees on completion of 15 years of service. In that perspective,\n\nvagueness of scheme of SBI, if any, can be of no advantage as it is\n\nclear beyond the pale of doubt that pension was heart and soul of the\n\nscheme with ex gratia on completion of 15 years of service. It is due to\n\nthe reason that the benefit was to be accorded to the incumbents\n\nhaving completed 15 years of service, \nRegulation 28\n as applicable to\n\nother nationalised banks was proposed to be modified as reflected in\n\nthe letter of IBA dated 11.12.2000 and Government of India letter\n\ndated 5.9.2000. Later on, the regulation was amended in 2002 after\n\nthe scheme had already been implemented in right earnest. There was\n\nnot even an iota of doubt that VRS was to give benefits to all eligible\n\nemployees having completed 15 years of service. It was apparent from\n\nthe letter dated 29.12.2000 of SBI that the guidelines of IBA were\n\napproved by the Central Board of Directors in its meeting dated\n\n27.12.2000. Para 2 of the letter dated 29.12.2000 of SBI Deputy\n\nManaging Director­cum­SDO is extracted hereunder:\n\n \"2. Accordingly, the Central Board of Directors, in its\n meeting held on 27.12.2000, has accorded approval for\n adopting and implementing the Voluntary Retirement\n Scheme for the employees of the Bank, namely \"SBI\n\n\f 74\n\n Voluntary Retirement Scheme (SBIVRS).” The Scheme\n \"SBIVRS\" has been drawn up, keeping in view the\n guidelines issued by IBA. A copy of the Scheme is placed\n at Annexure ‘B’.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n56. As noted in \nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra), the case of bank\n\nitself was that it was a contractual scheme. The expression \"pension\"\n\nas per rules was only for the purpose of working out the proportionate\n\npension. It was clearly decided to open the scheme to employees who\n\nhave put in 15 years of service. It was not provided in the scheme that\n\nthe incumbent was required to render a pensionable service of 20\n\nyears as per the rules in order to acquire eligibility for the pension.\n\nThe submission made on behalf of SBI is too tenuous to be accepted.\n\nIt was observed in para 89 of \nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra) quoted\n\nabove that the employee must have proceeded on the basis of 15 years\n\nof service then they were entitled to pensionary benefits.\n\n \nThe Court further observed in \nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra)\n\nthat the scheme is enforceable thus:\n\n “92. However, the case of the State Bank of India stands\n slightly on a different footing. Firstly, the State Bank of India\n had not amended the Scheme. It, as noticed hereinbefore, even\n permitted withdrawal of the applications after (sic by) 15th\n February. The Scheme floated by the State Bank of India\n contained a clause (clause 7) laying down the mode and\n manner in which the application for voluntary retirement shall\n be considered. The relevant clause, as referred to hereinbefore,\n creates an enforceable right. In the event the State Bank failed\n to adhere to its preferred policy, the same could have been\n specifically enforced by a court of law. The same would,\n therefore, amount to some consideration.\"\n\n\f 75\n\n57. While construing a contract, the language and surrounding\n\ncircumstances of the overall scheme, memorandum and letters are to\n\nbe read conjointly to find out whether any departure made by the\n\nBoard of Directors in its Resolution dated 27.12.2000 is of pivotal\n\nsignificance. In this case, the decision was taken by it of approval of\n\nthe IBA scheme as proposed. Its binding effect cannot be changed on\n\nthe basis what parties choose to say afterward, nor they can be\n\npermitted to wriggle out. The contract is required to be read as a\n\nwhole. It is apparent on a bare reading that optees will be eligible for\n\nproportionate pension under the Pension Regulations of the bank and\n\ntherefore, the bank bears the risk of lack of clarity, if any.\n\n58. \nIn \nBank of India & Anr. v. K. Mohandas & Ors.\n, (2009) 5 SCC 313\n\nwherein several other banks were also parties, the question arose as to\n\nthe nature of VRS, 2000. The Court noted the objectives, the\n\namendment made in \nRegulation 28\n in 2002, providing for 15 years of\n\nservice. The scheme was open in November­December, 2000 and in\n\nUnion Bank of India in January, 2001. The employees claimed that\n\nthose who completed 20 years of service, were entitled to the benefit of\n\nprovisions contained in \nRegulation 29(5)\n of Employees’ Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995 applicable to the said banks. They claimed having\n\ncompleted the qualifying service of 20 years under \nRegulation 29\n, were\n\nentitled for 5 years’ increase in the service tenure subject to the\n\n\f 76\n\nmaximum of 33 years which was not given to them on the ground that\n\nthe benefit of VRS was available to incumbents having completed 15\n\nyears of service as provided in amended \nRegulation 28\n, and \nRegulation\n\n29\n was not applicable. This Court held that the benefit of VRS was\n\navailable to the employees having completed 15 years of service, but\n\nthe additional benefit which was available on completion of 20 years of\n\nservice was also admissible as provided in \nRegulation 29(5)\n.\n\n59. While considering the aforesaid similar scheme of VRS, this\n\nCourt observed with respect to the construction of the contract on the\n\nbasis of the import of the words. The intention of the parties must be\n\nascertained from the language they have used and considered in the\n\nlight of surrounding circumstances, and the meaning cannot be\n\nchanged by a course of conduct adopted by the parties in acting under\n\nit. This Court in \nK. Mohandas\n (supra) held thus:\n\n “28. The true construction of a contract must depend upon\n the import of the words used and not upon what the parties\n choose to say afterwards. Nor does subsequent conduct of the\n parties in the performance of the contract affect the true effect\n of the clear and unambiguous words used in the contract. The\n intention of the parties must be ascertained from the language\n they have used, considered in the light of the surrounding\n circumstances and the object of the contract. The nature and\n purpose of the contract is an important guide in ascertaining\n the intention of the parties.\n\n 29. In Ottoman Bank of Nicosia v. Ohanes Chakarian, Lord\n Wright made these weighty observations: (AIR p. 29)\n “… that if the contract is clear and unambiguous, its true\n effect cannot be changed merely by the course of conduct\n adopted by the parties in acting under it.”\n\n\f 77\n\n 30. \nIn \nGanga Saran v. Firm Ram Charan Ram Gopal\n AIR 1952\n SC 9, a four­Judge Bench of this Court stated: (AIR p. 11, para\n\n 6)\n “6. … Since the true construction of an agreement must\n depend upon the import of the words used and not upon what\n the parties choose to say afterwards, it is unnecessary to refer\n to what the parties have said about it.”\n\n 31. It is also a well­recognised principle of construction of a\n contract that it must be read as a whole in order to ascertain\n the true meaning of its several clauses and the words of each\n clause should be interpreted so as to bring them into harmony\n with the other provisions if that interpretation does no violence\n to the meaning of which they are naturally susceptible. (North\n Eastern Railway Co. v. Lord Hastings, 1900 AC 260)”\n\n60. With respect to lack of clarity in the scheme, this Court in \nK.\n\nMohandas\n (supra) relied on maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur\n\ncontra proferentem to hold that banks who were responsible for\n\nformulation of the terms in the contractual Scheme, bear the risk of\n\nlack of clarity. Thus, the benefit has to be given to the employees by\n\nmaking interpretation against the banks. The Court held :\n\n “32. The fundamental position is that it is the banks who were\n responsible for formulation of the terms in the contractual\n Scheme that the optees of voluntary retirement under that\n Scheme will be eligible to pension under the Pension\n Regulations, 1995, and, therefore, they bear the risk of lack of\n clarity, if any. It is a well­known principle of construction of a\n contract that if the terms applied by one party are unclear, an\n interpretation against that party is preferred (verba chartarum\n fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem).\n\n 33. What was, in respect of pension, the intention of the banks\n at the time of bringing out VRS 2000? Was it not made\n expressly clear therein that the employees seeking voluntary\n retirement will be eligible for pension as per the Pension\n Regulations? If the intention was not to give pension as\n provided in \nRegulation 29\n and particularly sub­regulation (5)\n thereof, they could have said so in the Scheme itself. After all,\n much thought had gone into the formulation of VRS 2000, and\n\n\f 78\n\n it came to be framed after great deliberations. The only\n provision that could have been in mind while providing for\n pension as per the Pension Regulations was \nRegulation 29\n.\n\n Obviously, the employees, too, had the benefit of \nRegulation\n 29(5)\n in mind when they offered for voluntary retirement as\n admittedly \nRegulation 28\n, as was existing at that time, was not\n applicable at all. None of Regulations 30 to 34 was attracted.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n61. \nIn \nK. Mohandas\n (supra) the Court considered the argument that\n\nRegulation 28\n would be applicable only for providing 15 years of\n\neligibility as provided by way of amendment of Regulation of 1995, and\n\nheld that as the banks are “State” within the meaning of \nArticle 12\n, it\n\nwould be an arbitrary action on their part to deny the benefit of\n\nsection 29(5)\n, and there has to be harmonious construction to the\n\nscheme and Pension Regulations, thus:\n\n “35. We are afraid; it would be unreasonable if amended\n \nRegulation 28\n is made applicable, which had not seen the light\n of the day and which was not the intention of the banks when\n the Scheme was framed. The banks in the present batch of\n appeals are public sector banks and are \"State\" within the\n meaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution and their action even\n in contractual matters has to be reasonable, lest, as observed\n in O.P. Swarnakar (2003) 2 SCC 721, it must attract the wrath\n of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n 36. Any interpretation of the terms of VRS 2000, although\n contractual in nature, must meet the test of fairness. It has to\n be construed in a manner that avoids arbitrariness and\n unreasonableness on the part of the public sector banks who\n brought out VRS 2000 with an objective of rightsizing their\n manpower. The banks decided to shed surplus manpower. By\n formulation of the special scheme (VRS 2000), the banks\n intended to achieve their objective of rationalising their force\n as they were overstaffed. The special Scheme was, thus,\n oriented to lure the employees to go in for voluntary\n retirement. In this background, the consideration that was to\n pass between the parties assumes significance and a\n harmonious construction to the Scheme, and the Pension\n Regulations, therefore, has to be given.\n\n\f 79\n\n 37. The amendment to \nRegulation 28\n can, at best, be said to\n have been intended to cover the employees with 15 years of\n service or more but less than 20 years of service. This\n intention is reflected from the communication dated 5­9­2000\n sent by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\n Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) to the\n Personnel Advisor, Indian Banks’ Association.”\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n It opined that the amendment to \nRegulation 28\n of 1995\n\nRegulation intended to cover 15 years of service, i.e., employees with\n\n15 years of service who have not completed 20 years of service. A\n\nsimilar action to amend the Rule was required to be taken by the SBI,\n\nbut it failed to take it after having floated a similar scheme. It kept it\n\nuncertain what would be the position of the rule as on the appointed\n\ndate, i.e., 31.3.2001. Be that as it may. But it was crystal clear that\n\nthe incumbent with 15 years of service was eligible for the benefit as\n\nprovided in the scheme itself. The benefit clause has to be read with\n\nthe eligibility criteria. Once VRS was formulated and adopted by the\n\nSBI in toto, it constituted a complete contractual package in itself.\n\n62. As urged on behalf of SBI if \nsection 23\n of the Contract Act is\n\napplied, then how it is helpful to the bank, is not understandable. In\n\ncase it is held that the very scheme was opposed to the law/rules, the\n\nentire scheme would fall down. Once it adopted the scheme, invited\n\napplications and the employees acted upon it and retired on the basis\n\nof the scheme, they cannot be left in lurch. In case its submission is\n\naccepted, the Scheme becomes violative of Section 23 of Contact Act,\n\n\f 80\n\nthe bank would have to suffer the consequences of striking down of\n\nthe very scheme and would be required to reinstate the employees and\n\nto pay them the salary and other benefits. However, SBI accepted the\n\nscheme, it was incumbent upon it to bring the rules in consonance\n\nwith the similar VRS scheme as was done by other banks. The SBI\n\naccepted the scheme on 27.12.2000 without any ifs and buts. Thus,\n\nthe anomaly was the outcome of the bank's inaction to propose and\n\nmake amendment of rules. In such a scenario, the action of SBI is\n\nviolative of \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n21\n of the Constitution. The situation\n\ncreated by itself is not going to benefit the bank to lend support to\n\narbitrary action. The bank was bound to extend the benefits by\n\namending the rules, if necessary, to salvage the situation for itself.\n\nBreach of law has been committed by the SBI itself, its action is\n\narbitrary and it cannot be permitted to take advantage of its own\n\nwrong.\n\n63. The pension cannot be dealt with arbitrarily and cannot be\n\ndenied in an unfair manner. The concept of pension was considered\n\nin \nD.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India\n, (1983) 1 SCC 305. The right to\n\na pension can be enforced through the court, it observed :\n\n \n“20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a\n gratuitous payment depending upon the sweet will or grace of\n the employer not claimable as a right and, therefore, no right\n to pension can be enforced through Court has been swept\n under the carpet by the decision of the Constitution Bench in\n\n\f 81\n\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n (1971) 2 SCC 330\n wherein this Court authoritatively ruled that pension is a right\n and the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of\n the Government but is governed by the rules and a\n government servant coming within those rules is entitled to\n claim pension. It was further held that the grant of pension\n does not depend upon anyone’s discretion. It is only for the\n purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to service\n and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the\n authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive\n pension flows to the officer not because of any such order but\n by virtue of the rules.\n \nThis view was reaffirmed in \nState of\n Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n, (1976) 2 SCC 1.\n\n 22. In the course of transformation of society from feudal to\n welfare and as socialistic thinking acquired respectability.\n\n State obligation to provide security in old age, an escape from\n undeserved want was recognised and as a first step pension\n was treated not only as a reward for past service but with a\n view to helping the employee to avoid destitution in old age.\n The quid pro quo was that when the employee was physically\n and mentally alert, he rendered unto master the best,\n expecting him to look after him in the fall of life. A retirement\n system, therefore, exists solely for the purpose of providing\n benefits. In most of the plans of retirement benefits, everyone\n who qualifies for normal retirement receives the same amount\n (see Retirement Systems for Public Employees by Bleakney, p.\n\n 33).”\n\n This Court observed that the principal aim of the socialist State\n\nas envisaged in the Preamble is to eliminate inequality. The basic\n\nframework of socialism is to provide security in the fall of life to the\n\nworking people and especially provides security from the cradle to the\n\ngrave when employees have rendered service in heydays of life, they\n\ncannot be destituted in old age, by taking action in an arbitrary\n\nmanner and for omission to complete obligation assured one. Though\n\nthere cannot be estoppel against the law but when a bank had the\n\npower to amend it, it cannot take shelter of its own inaction and SBI\n\n\f 82\n\nought to have followed the pursuit of other banks and was required to\n\nact in a similar fair manner having accepted the scheme.\n\n64. Resultantly, we are of the opinion that the employees who\n\ncompleted 15 years of service or more as on cut­off date were entitled\n\nto proportionate pension under SBI VRS to be computed as per SBI\n\nPension Fund Rules. Let the benefits be extended to all such similar\n\nemployees retired under VRS on completion of 15 years of service\n\nwithout requiring them to rush to the court. However, considering the\n\nfacts and circumstances, it would not be appropriate to burden the\n\nbank with interest. Let order be complied with and arrears be paid\n\nwithin three months, failing which amount to carry interest at the rate\n\nof 6 per cent per annum from the date of this order. The appeals are\n\naccordingly disposed of. No costs.\n\n …………………………J.\n (Arun Mishra)\n\n ………………….……..J.\n (M.R. Shah)\n\nNew Delhi; …….…………………..J.\nMarch 2, 2020. (B.R. Gavai)",

The rules\n under Act 22 of 1939 were framed by the Provincial\n Government of Bombay in 1941. At that time, there was no\n Legislature in session, the Legislature having been suspended\n during the emergency arising out of World War II. The session\n of the Bombay Legislative Assembly was convened for the first\n time after 1941 on 20­5­1946, and that session was prorogued\n on 24­5­1946. The second session of the Bombay Legislative\n Assembly was convened on 15­7­1946, and that of the\n Bombay Legislative Council on 3­9­1946 and the rules were\n placed on the Assembly Table in the second session before the\n Legislative Assembly on 2­9­1946 and before the Legislative\n Council on 13­9­1946. \nSection 26(5)\n of Bombay Act 22 of 1939\n does not prescribe that the rules acquired validity only from\n the date on which they were placed before the Houses of\n Legislature. The rules are valid from the date on which they\n are made under \nSection 26(1)\n. It is true that the Legislature\n has prescribed that the rules shall be placed before the Houses\n of Legislature, but failure to place the rules before the Houses\n of Legislature does not affect the validity of the rules, merely\n because they have not been placed before the Houses of the\n Legislature. Granting that the provisions of sub­section (5) of\n \nSection 26\n by reason of the failure to place the rules before the\n Houses of Legislature were violated, we are of the view that\n sub­section (5) of \nSection 26\n having regard to the purposes for\n which it is made, and in the context in which it occurs, cannot\n be regarded as mandatory.

In order to determine whether this case is\n one in which that power ought to be exercised, what your\n Lordships have in fact been doing has been to assess the\n relative bargaining power of the publisher and the songwriter\n at the time the contract was made and to decide whether the\n publisher had used his superior bargaining power to exact\n from the songwriter promises that were unfairly onerous to\n him. Your Lordships have not been concerned to inquire\n whether the public have in fact been deprived of the fruit of the\n song writer's talents by reason of the restrictions, nor to\n assess the likelihood that they would be so deprived in the\n future if the contract were permitted to run its full course.\n It is, in my view, salutary to acknowledge that in refusing to\n enforce provisions of a contract whereby one party agrees for\n the benefit of the other party to exploit or to refrain from\n exploiting his own earning power, the public policy which the\n court is implementing is not some 19th century economic\n theory about the benefit to the general public of freedom of\n trade, but the protection of those whose bargaining power is\n weak against being forced by those whose bargaining power is\n stronger to enter into bargains that are unconscionable. Under\n the influence of Bentham and of laissez faire the courts in the\n 19th century abandoned the practice of applying the public\n policy against unconscionable bargains to contracts generally,\n as they had formerly done to any contract considered to be\n usurious; but the policy survived in its application to penalty\n clauses and to relief against forfeiture and also to the special\n category of contracts in restraint of trade. If one looks at the\n reasoning of 19th­century judges in cases about contracts in\n restraint of trade one finds lip service paid to current economic\n theories, but if one looks at what they said in the light of what\n they did, one finds that they struck down a bargain if they\n thought it was unconscionable as between the parties to it and\n upheld it if they thought that it was not."

It is not possible for a\n private person to settle the terms of his agreement with a\n British Railways Board or with a local electricity authority.”\n The 'standard form' contract is the rule. He must either accept\n the terms of this contract in toto or go without. Since,\n however, it is not feasible to deprive oneself of such necessary\n services, the individual is compelled to accept on those terms.\n In view of this fact, it is quite clear that freedom of contract is\n now largely an illusion.\""

The\n rule of law from this point of view means that decisions\n should be made by the application of known principles\n and rules and, in general, such decisions should be\n predictable, and the citizen should know where he is. If a\n decision is taken without any principle or without any\n rule, it is unpredictable, and such a decision is the\n antithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule\n of law.
