By this writ petition, Petitioner seeks quashing of the order\ndated 21.01.2019, whereby his representation for treating the\nsuspension period as period in service and payment of balance salary\nhas been rejected. A writ of certiorari is also sought for quashing the\norder dated 11.02.2019, by which Petitioner was informed that the\nperiod of suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 would be treated\nas period of service without break and counted towards qualifying\nservice for calculation of terminal dues but from the date of acquittal\nof the Petitioner in the criminal case i.e. 25.05.2018.

The factual score that emerges from the writ petition is that\nPetitioner joined the Respondent/Punjab National Bank as an Officer\nin September, 1976. On 31.08.1992, Central Bureau of Investigation\n('CBI') registered an FIR against few officials of the Bank including\nthe Petitioner for alleged irregularities in some loan accounts of M/s\nPankaj Finance & Leasing Ltd. (PFLL). In September, 1993, New\nBank of India was merged with Respondent/Punjab National Bank and\nin October, 1994, sanction was given for prosecution of some\nemployees of the Bank, including the Petitioner and a charge sheet\nwas issued thereafter.\n\n3. On 17.12.1994, Petitioner was placed under suspension, which\nwas revoked on 13.12.2000, without prejudice to the criminal\nproceedings/disciplinary action pending/contemplated against him\nwith a further direction in the order to post him at a non-sensitive post\non the administrative side. One month before his superannuation, a\nshow-cause notice was served on the Petitioner on 30.05.2007 for\ncertain irregularities to which a reply was sent by the Petitioner on\n12.06.2007. On 28.06.2007, Petitioner was informed that in the wake\nof contemplated disciplinary proceedings, his superannuation benefits\nshall be withheld. Petitioner superannuated on 30.06.2007.\n\n4. Challenging the show-cause notice and the order dated\n28.06.2007, Petitioner filed a writ petition in this Court being W.P.(C)\n1290/2008, which was disposed of on 15.09.2008 with a direction to\nthe Respondent to take a decision on the show-cause notice within\nfour weeks. Instead of deciding the show-cause notice Respondent\nserved a charge sheet on the Petitioner on 06.10.2008.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 2 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\n5. On 29.11.2009, Respondent gave a second option for pension to\nthe Petitioner on deposit of Bank's contribution of Provident Fund and\nPetitioner opted for pension and deposited the desired amount.\nConsequent thereto, Respondent started paying pension to the\nPetitioner w.e.f. 29.11.2009 but without taking into consideration the\nperiod of 6 years during which Petitioner was placed under suspension\nand hence the total period computed for pension was taken as 25\nyears.\n\n6. In the meantime, Petitioner challenged the charge sheet by\nfiling W.P.(C) 7481/2008 before this Court, which was allowed vide\njudgement dated 29.10.2013, quashing the charge sheet as being\nwithout jurisdiction, with a further direction that Petitioner be paid the\nretirement benefits along with interest @ 6% p.a. w.e.f 01.07.2007.\nAdmittedly, this judgement was never assailed by the Respondent and\nwas implemented by paying the retirement dues along with interest.\n\n7. Significantly, vide judgement dated 25.05.2018, the CBI Court\nacquitted the Petitioner of all criminal charges while some of the\nco-accused were convicted. Armed with the judgement, Petitioner sent\na representation dated 04.06.2018 to the Respondent requesting for\ntreating the suspension period from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 as spent\non duty and payment of the difference between the salary and\nsubsistence allowance already paid, as also to treat the length of\nservice as 31 years for computation of pension, in accordance with\nRegulation 15 of the Punjab National Bank Officer Employees'\n(Discipline and Appeal) Regulations, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as\n'Regulations 1977').\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 3 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\n8. On 21.01.2019, Respondent passed an order rejecting the\nrequest of the Petitioner and Petitioner made further representations\nciting certain judgements in his favour. An order was passed by the\nRespondent on 11.02.2019, partly accepting the request of the\nPetitioner and agreeing to treat the suspension period as service\nwithout break for calculation of pension albeit from the date of\nacquittal and not from 29.11.2009, the date from which the Petitioner\nhas started getting his pension, on the ground that Petitioner was not\nhonourably acquitted in the criminal case and the acquittal was by\ngiving benefit of doubt. Further representations of the Petitioner failed\nto evoke any positive response, constraining him to file the present\nwrit petition.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that Regulation\n15(1) of the Regulations 1977 provides that where the employee is\nfully exonerated or the suspension is unjustifiable, he shall be granted\nfull pay for the intervening period. Regulation 15(3)(a) further\nprovides that where Regulation 15(1) applies, period of absence from\nduty shall, for all purposes, be treated as period spent on duty.\nThe ground for denying the full salary for the suspension period is that\nthe Petitioner has not been fully exonerated and was acquitted by\ngiving benefit of doubt and 'no work no pay'. The stand of the\nRespondent is completely misconceived. Petitioner stands fully\nexonerated since the charge sheet in the disciplinary proceedings was\nquashed and the CBI Court has also acquitted him while convicting\nthe others, where criminality and culpability was found by the Court,\nafter detailed examination of the evidence, both oral and documentary.\n43 witnesses were examined by the prosecution and documentary\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 4 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nevidence runs into hundreds of exhibits. The acquittal is not based on\nany flaw in the prosecution case or on ground of non-examination of\nwitnesses and/or any witness turning hostile. The Supreme Court in\n\nUnion of India and Others v. Methu Meda\n, (\n2022) 1 SCC 1 and\nCommissioner of Police, New Delhi and Another v. Mehar Singh\n,\n(2013) 7 SCC 685, has held that the expressions 'honourable\nacquittal', 'acquitted of blame' and 'clean acquittal' have been coined\nby judicial pronouncements and in cases where accused is acquitted\ndue to technicalities on account of faulty prosecution, compromise,\netc., it can be said that accused is not honourably acquitted, however,\nacquittal on account of benefit of doubt is a complete acquittal on\nmerits as observed in Mohan Lal, Constable No. 744/L, 283/Sd,\nDelhi Police, Delhi v. Union of India & Others, 1981 SCC OnLine\nDel 213.\n\n10. Respondent has gravely erred in not treating the period of\nsuspension towards calculation of the computation of pensionary\nbenefits. There is no law which permits the Respondent to reckon the\nperiod from the date of acquittal by the Criminal Court instead of from\nthe date of retirement of an employee. No provision of law or\njudgement has been cited by the Respondent for linking the\ncomputation of the period to the date of acquittal by the Criminal\nCourt.\nIn the order dated 21.01.2019, reliance is placed by the\nRespondent on the judgement of the Supreme Court in\nUnion of India\nand Others v. Jaipal Singh\n, (2004) 1 SCC 121, however, the said\njudgement is wholly inapplicable to the present case. First and\nforemost, it does not deal with the provision such as Regulation 15 of\nRegulations 1977. Secondly, it is not in the hands of an accused to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 5 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\ncontrol the length of time for which a criminal trial proceeds and\ntherefore it is extremely dangerous to link the date of the judgement\nfor the purpose of commencement of the period which is to be counted\nfor pensionary benefits. Thirdly and importantly, in the said case the\naccused was convicted by the Trial Court and then suspended and\nfinally reinstated on acquittal by the Sessions Court. In this\nbackground, the Supreme Court held that if an employee is convicted\nby the Trial Court and subsequently acquitted in an appeal, department\ncannot be faulted for having kept him out of service, since the law\nobliges a person convicted of an offence to be kept out and not\nretained in service. In this background, the Supreme Court held that\nthe department cannot be made liable to pay for the period for which it\ndid not avail the services of the employee and the High Court erred in\nallowing back wages. In the present case, Petitioner was acquitted by\nthe Trial Court as contrasted to the facts in the aforementioned case.\n\n11. It was further submitted that Petitioner is now 75 years of age\nand suffering from various ailments. He has already suffered for\nseveral years on account of a false and illegal charge sheet issued by\nthe department as well as by the CBI, both of which stand quashed by\nthe respective Courts, vindicating the stand of the Petitioner that he\nwas innocent. There is thus no impediment in the way of the Petitioner\nin getting the reliefs sought for in the present petition.\n\n12. Per contra, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that\nmost of the terminal dues of the Petitioner have been released, details\nof which have been given in the short affidavit. After the decision on\n11.02.2019 to treat the period of suspension as period of service\nwithout any break from the date of acquittal, further amounts towards\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 6 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\ngratuity and commutation of pension/monthly pension have also been\nreleased. However, Petitioner is not entitled to terminal benefits from\nthe date of superannuation for the reason that the revocation of\nsuspension was made subject to the outcome of criminal proceedings,\nwhich have ended in acquittal but by giving benefit of doubt. The\nacquittal of the Petitioner is not honourable and cannot be termed as a\ncase of \"full exoneration\". To support the contention, learned counsel\nhad taken the Court through the relevant passages of the judgement of\nthe Criminal Court delivered on 25.05.2018.\n\n13. It was further urged that Regulation 15(1) provides that where\nthe Competent Authority is of the view that the employee has been\nfully exonerated or the suspension was unjustifiable, the employee\nwill be entitled to full pay together with allowances. Since in the\npresent case, it cannot be said that the Petitioner is fully exonerated,\nhe cannot be held entitled to full benefits and it is on this count that\nthe difference in the full salary and subsistence allowance has been\ndenied to the Petitioner.\nIn support, reliance is placed on the\njudgement of the Supreme Court in\nJaipal Singh\n(supra).\n\n14. Learned counsel also placed reliance on the judgement of the\nSupreme Court in\nBaldev Singh v. Union of India and Others\n, (2005)\n8 SCC 747, to contend that once an employee is not in actual service\nfor the period he is in custody, merely because there is an acquittal\ndoes not automatically entitle him to salary for the period concerned\napplying the principle of \"no work no pay\".\n\nFor the same proposition,\nreliance was placed on the judgement in\nBanshi Dhar v. State of\nRajasthan and Another\n, (2007) 1 SCC 324 and it was argued that it\nwas only from the date the CBI Court acquitted the Petitioner that his\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 7 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nservice can be counted for the purpose of pension and gratuity.\n\nFor the\nproposition that acquittal on ground of benefit of doubt cannot be\nconsidered as a case of full exoneration i.e. honourable acquittal,\nreliance was placed on the judgements in\nC.R. Radhakrishnan v.\nState of Kerala and Others\n, (\n2017) 13 SCC 365, Management of\nReserve Bank of India, New Delhi v. Bhopal Singh Panchal\n, (1994)\nSCC 541 and Methu Meda\n(supra).\n\n15. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and examined\ntheir contentions.\n\n16. Two issues arise for consideration before this Court originating\nfrom the grievances ventilated by the Petitioner: (a) whether the\nPetitioner is entitled to full salary for the suspension period between\n17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000; and (b) correctness of the action of the\nRespondent to treat the length of service as 25 years instead of 31\nyears in failing to reckon the suspension period 17.12.1994 to\n13.12.2000, for purpose of computation of pension for the period\n29.11.2009 to 25.05.2018.\n\n17. Narrative of facts shows that Petitioner was placed under\nsuspension on 17.12.1994 pursuant to a criminal case in which charge\nsheet was filed in October, 1994. He remained under suspension till\nthe suspension order was revoked and he was reinstated on\n14.12.2000, pending final adjudication in the criminal case and subject\nto outcome of contemplated disciplinary action. Respondent initiated\ndepartmental proceedings against the Petitioner by issuing a charge\nsheet on 06.10.2008, which was quashed by this Court by a judgment\ndated 29.10.2013 in W.P.(C) 7481/2008. Subsequently, Petitioner was\nacquitted in the criminal case on 25.05.2018. Pertinently, Respondent\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 8 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\ndid not challenge the judgment dated 29.10.2013 quashing the charge\nsheet in the departmental proceedings and the State did not challenge\nthe judgment in the criminal case, acquitting the Petitioner and thus\nboth judgments have attained finality.\n\n18. Rejection of the claims of the Petitioner by the Respondent is\nprimarily predicated on its understanding that Petitioner was not\n'honourably' acquitted by the Trial Court and therefore does not fit in\nthe four corners of Regulation 15(1) of Regulations 1977, under which\nan employee is entitled to full salary and allowances only upon 'full\nexoneration' and/or where the 'suspension is found to be\nunjustifiable'. It is on this score that the Petitioner has been denied the\nbenefit of counting the suspension period for the purpose of\ncomputation of pension resulting in loss of six years and\nallowances/increments etc. minus the payments towards subsistence\nallowance. Counsel for the Petitioner laboured hard to establish that\nPetitioner's acquittal was a clean acquittal and not by giving benefit of\ndoubt as the CBI Court had conducted a full-fledged trial examining\n43 witnesses and hundreds of documents as exhibits and only on\ndetailed examination of evidence had acquitted the Petitioner, while\nconvicting 4 co-accused. In order to so demonstrate, learned counsel\nhad taken the Court through the judgment of the Criminal Court,\nwhich is appended to the writ petition.\n\n19. To test the contentions of the Respondent, Regulation 15 of\nRegulations 1977 would require an examination and the same is\nextracted hereunder, for ready reference:-\n\n\"15. Pay, Allowance and Treatment of Service on termination of\nsuspension:\n\nSignature Not Verified (1) Where the competent authority holds that the officer\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 9 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nemployee has been fully exonerated or that the suspension\nwas unjustifiable, the officer employee concerned shall be\ngranted the full pay to which he would have been entitled,\nhad he not been suspended, together with any allowance of\nwhich he was in receipt immediately prior to his suspension,\nor may have been sanctioned subsequently and made\napplicable to all officer employees.\n\n(2) In all cases other than those referred to in sub-regulation (1),\nthe officer employee shall be granted such proportion of pay\nand allowances as the competent authority may direct:\n\nProvided that the payment of allowances under this sub-\nregulation shall be subject to all other conditions to which\nsuch allowances are admissible;\n\nProvided further that the pay and allowances granted under\nthis sub-regulation shall not be less than the subsistence and\nother allowances admissible under regulation 14.\n(3) (a) In a case falling under sub-regulation (1), the\nperiod of absence from duty shall, for all purposes, be\ntreated as a period spent on duty;\n\n(b) In a case falling under sub-regulation (2), the period\nof absence from duty shall not be treated as a period spent\non duty, unless the competent authority specifically directs,\nfor reasons to be recorded in writing, that it shall be so\ntreated for any specific purpose.\"\n\n20. Plain reading of Regulation 15 (1) of Regulations 1977 shows\nthat an employee concerned is entitled to full pay and allowances, if\nhe is fully exonerated or his suspension is found to be unjustifiable. It\nis not in dispute that Respondent initially made payments to the\nPetitioner on account of Provident Fund (Petitioner's contribution),\nGratuity, Leave Encashment, commutation of Pension and monthly\npension is also being paid. Thereafter, a decision was taken that the\nperiod of suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 will be treated as\nperiod of service without any break for the purpose of Gratuity and\nPension from the date of acquittal in criminal proceedings i.e.\n25.05.2018 and pursuant thereto additional terminal benefits towards\nGratuity, commutation of Pension and monthly Pension were also\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 10 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\npaid. Therefore, the dispute that remains to be resolved between the\nparties is with respect to the salary for the suspension period minus the\nsubsistence allowance paid and counting of the period for computation\nof Pension, which is required to be decided in light of the defence of\nthe Respondent that Petitioner's acquittal is not a clean acquittal and\ndoctrine of 'no work no pay'.\n\n21. Impugned order shows that Respondent has placed reliance on\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court in\nJaipal Singh\n(supra), where the\nSupreme Court held that where an employee gets involved in a\ncriminal case and after initial conviction gets acquitted on an appeal,\nDepartment cannot be faulted with for having kept him out of service\nand cannot be made liable to pay for the period for which it could not\navail the services of the employee. Much was argued by the\nRespondent that the acquittal of the Petitioner is not a clean or\nhonourable acquittal and therefore no interference is warranted in the\nexercise of discretion by the Respondent in treating the period of\nsuspension as 'not on duty' and denying the balance wages for that\nperiod. In the short affidavit filed by the Respondent, a stand is taken\nthat it is only upon 'full exoneration' or in a case where period of\nsuspension is found to be unjustifiable under Regulation 15(1) read\nwith 15(3)(b) of Regulations 1977 that period of absence from duty\ncan be treated as period spent on duty and that in the present case,\nreading of the judgement of the criminal case would show that\nPetitioner's acquittal was not honourable so as to be termed as a case\nof 'full exoneration'.\n\n22. Before proceeding further to examine the meaning and\nconnotation of the expression 'full exoneration', which is really the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 11 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nbone of contention between the parties, Regulation 15(1) needs to be\nseen. A plain and a close reading of the said Regulation shows that an\nemployee will be entitled to full pay and allowances on termination of\nsuspension if he is fully exonerated 'or' his suspension was\nunjustifiable. Use of the word 'or' shows that the conditions are in the\nalternative, which means that even where the suspension is\nunjustifiable but an employee is fully exonerated, he would be entitled\nto wages for the suspension period. Therefore, it needs to be examined\nwhether the Petitioner's suspension was unjustifiable and to my mind,\nthe answer to this question cannot be in favour of the Petitioner. As a\nmatter of fact, Petitioner was placed under suspension on 17.12.1994\nin view of a charge-sheet filed by the CBI for penal offences as well\nas for alleged acts of corruption under the\nPrevention of Corruption\nAct, 1988\n. The suspension was revoked on 16.12.2000, without\nprejudice to the criminal/disciplinary proceedings\npending/contemplated with further stipulation that payment of\nsalary/wages for suspension period shall be decided upon final\noutcome of the pending criminal proceedings and contemplated\ndisciplinary action. In view of the seriousness of the charge-sheet filed\nby the CBI, it cannot be held that the suspension was unjustified.\nHowever, the provision is not restricted to 'unjustified suspension'\nsince\nRegulation 15(1)\nentitles payment of pay and allowances where\nthere is 'full exoneration' and in light of this stipulation, the moot\nquestion that requires consideration is whether Petitioner can be stated\nto be 'fully exonerated'. The expressions 'honourable acquittal', 'fully\nacquitted' and 'clean acquittal', were held to be unknown to\nCode of\nCriminal Procedure\nor\nIndian Penal Code\nand were developed by\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 12 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\njudicial pronouncements.\nIn\nRobert Stuart Wauchope v. Emperor\n,\n1933 SCC OnLine Cal 369, Lord Williams, J. observed as under:-\n\n\"10. ......\n\n\"The expression \"honourably acquitted\" is one which is\nunknown to courts of justice. Apparently it is a form of order\nused in courts martial and other extra-judicial tribunals. We\nsaid in our judgment that we accepted the explanation given by\nthe appellant, believed it to be true and considered that it ought\nto have been accepted by the government authorities and by the\nMagistrate. Further we decided that the appellant had not\nmisappropriated the monies referred to in the charge. It is thus\nclear that the effect of our judgment was that the appellant was\nacquitted as fully and completely as it was possible for him to be\nacquitted. Presumably, this is equivalent to what the government\nauthorities term \"honourably acquitted\".\"\n\n23.\nIn\nMethu Meda\n(supra), the Supreme Court once again\nexamined the expression 'honourable acquittal' and held as under:-\n\n\"12. In view of the above, if the acquittal is directed by the court on\nconsideration of facts and material evidence on record with the\nfinding of false implication or the finding that the guilt had not been\nproved, accepting the explanation of accused as just, it be treated as\nhonourable acquittal. In other words, if prosecution could not prove\nthe guilt for other reasons and not \"honourably\" acquitted by the\ncourt, it be treated other than \"honourable\", and proceedings may\nfollow.\n\n13. The expression \"honourable acquittal\" has been considered in\nS. Samuthiram [State v. S. Samuthiram, (2013) 1 SCC 598 : (2013) 1\nSCC (Cri) 566 : (2013) 1 SCC (L&S) 229] after considering the\njudgments in RBI v. Bhopal Singh Panchal [RBI v. Bhopal Singh\nPanchal, (1994) 1 SCC 541 : 1994\nSCC (L&S) 594] and R.P. Kapur\n[R.P. Kapur v. Union of India\n, AIR 1964 SC 787] , Raghava\nRajgopalachari [State of Assam v. Raghava Rajgopalachari, 1967\nSCC OnLine SC 1 : (1972) 7 SLR 44] ; this Court observed that the\nstandard of proof required for holding a person guilty by a criminal\ncourt and enquiry conducted by way of disciplinary proceeding is\nentirely different. In a criminal case, the onus of establishing guilt of\nthe accused is on the prosecution, until proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt. In case, the prosecution failed to take steps to examine\ncrucial witnesses or the witnesses turned hostile, such acquittal\nwould fall within the purview of giving benefit of doubt and the\naccused cannot be treated as honourably acquitted by the criminal\ncourt. While, in a case of departmental proceedings, the guilt may be\n\nSignature Not Verified proved on the basis of preponderance of probabilities, it is thus\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 13 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nobserved that acquittal giving benefit of doubt would not\nautomatically lead to reinstatement of candidate unless the rules\nprovide so.\"\n\n24.\nIn\nDeputy Inspector General of Police and Another v. S.\nSamuthiram\n, (2013) 1 SCC 598, the Supreme Court held that if a\nperson is acquitted or discharged, it cannot always be inferred that he\nwas falsely implicated and unless it is an honourable acquittal,\nbenefits cannot be claimed. In\nthe said judgment\n, the Supreme Court\nonce again examined the meaning and connotation of the expression\n'honourable acquittal' and held as follows:-\n\n\"10. Shri C. Paramasivam, learned counsel appearing for the\nappellant, submitted that the High Court was not justified in\ninterfering with disciplinary proceedings and setting aside the order\nof dismissal of the respondent. The learned counsel submitted that\nthe High Court overlooked the fact that the standard of proof in a\ndomestic enquiry and criminal enquiry is different. The mere\nacquittal by the criminal court does not entitle the delinquent for\nexoneration in the disciplinary proceedings. The learned counsel\nalso submitted that the case in hand is not where punishment of\ndismissal was imposed on the basis of conviction in a criminal trial\nand only in such situation, acquittal by a court in a criminal trial\nwould have some relevance. Further, it was also pointed out that, in\nthe instant case, the respondent was not honourably acquitted by the\ncriminal court, but was acquitted since the complainant turned\nhostile.\"\n\n25. From the conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, the principles\nthat cumulatively emerge are that where the acquittal by a criminal\ncourt is on consideration of facts and evidence on record, both oral\nand documentary, with the finding that the guilt has not been proved,\naccepting the stand of the accused as just it will be treated as\nhonourable acquittal. As held in\nMethu Meda\n(supra), if the\nprosecution is unable to prove the guilt for other reasons then it is not\nan honourable acquittal and for coming to this conclusion, the\nSupreme Court took strength from the observations of an earlier\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 14 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\njudgment in S. Samuthiram (supra), wherein the Supreme Court held\nthat if the prosecution fails to take steps to examine crucial witnesses\nor where the witnesses turn hostile, such acquittal would fall within\nthe purview of giving benefit of doubt and the accused cannot be\ntreated as honourably acquitted.\n\n26. I have perused the judgement of the criminal court in light of\nthe above principles. It is seen from the judgement that CBI had\ncharge-sheeted several people including the accused for offences\npunishable under Sections 420/467/468/471 read with 120-B\nIPC\nand\n\nSection 13(i)(d)\nread with\nSection 13(2)\nof the Prevention of\nCorruption Act, 1988. In a nutshell, the charge was that during 1989,\nM/s PFLL represented by its Director conspired with officers of the\nRespondent Bank and obtained loan of Rs.26,67,694/- on the basis of\nforged documents and advance to the tune of Rs.16,30,900/- was\ngiven against five vehicles to M/s Geetanjali Motors Ltd. on the basis\nof forged bills and an amount of Rs.10,36,794/- was given for\npurchase of three vehicles on duplicate bills of Rasna Automobile (P)\nLtd. and neither of the two firms purchased or sold the vehicles. There\nwere 8 accused in the matter and the prosecution examined 43\nwitnesses along with a plethora of documentary evidence. Defence\nalso examined several witnesses and produced documentary evidence.\nBy a detailed judgement dated 25.05.2018, the Trial Court held that\nprosecution had succeeded in proving its case against 4 accused\nbeyond reasonable doubt and convicted them whereas the Petitioner\nalong with Kuldeep Singh Malik were acquitted of all charges by\ngiving benefit of doubt. From paragraph 155 onwards, the Trial Court\nhas dealt with the case of the Petitioner who was working as Manager\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 15 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\n(loans) in the Bank and after examining the entire evidence and the\narguments of the prosecution and the defence, rendered a finding that\nloan amounts with respect to five vehicles were already processed and\nreleased prior to the joining of the Petitioner as admitted by the\nprosecution and proved by D2W1 through mark 'D2W1/3' that\nPetitioner took charge of the Department of Loans on 22.07.1989 prior\nto which drawing power with respect to five vehicles was already\nentered into and released and therefore he could have no role or\nauthority for approval of the agreements relating to the first five\nvehicles. Trial Court concluded that the act of the Petitioner in signing\nthe agreements at subsequent stage can be termed as an irregularity on\nhis part but criminality cannot be attributed to him on this account and\nthe only role that comes up in relation to the transaction of five\nvehicles is that Petitioner signed the agreements considering it a mere\nformality and therefore he cannot be held accountable.\n\n27. Insofar as the transaction with respect to the second tranche of\nthree vehicles is concerned, the Trial Court noted that during October,\n1989, documents were submitted in the Bank relating to finance of\nthree vehicles, loans No.169, 170 and 171, which were not purchased\nby M/s. PFLL and it is also true that Petitioner had signed and\napproved the three agreements and drawing powers were accordingly\nenhanced. Having so observed, the Trial Court further notes that the\nrelevant documents i.e. invoices, receipts and insurance cover notes\nannexed to the agreements were not forged as they were procured\nfrom authorized places and persons, but later the payments were\nstopped towards the seller and insurer, resulting in cancellation of\ninvoices and the documents were misused by Sushil Kumar Gupta,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 16 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\naccused No.4, to cheat the Bank. In this backdrop, Trial Court held\nthat it is quite possible that Petitioner was not personally knowing\nabout the factum of stop payment of cheques by M/s. PFLL towards\npurchase money of vehicles and insurance premium and therefore\nelement of doubt arises and it cannot be concluded that Petitioner has\nacted dishonestly in favour of M/s. PFLL, particularly, when it is\nevident that Senior Officer V.K. Bhutiani, accused No.1 was\ninstrumental in handling the accounts of PFLL. It was further held that\nthe Directors of M/s. PFLL have successfully defrauded the Bank with\ncollusion of Senior Manager and the role of the Petitioner appears to\nbe doubtful in the entire transaction and he is therefore entitled to\nbenefit of doubt.\n\n28. On a close examination of the findings of the Trial Court, I am\nof the view that there is merit in the contention of the Petitioner that\nthe prosecution despite producing 43 witnesses and hundreds of\ndocuments, was unable to establish the guilt of the Petitioner. The\nTrial Court has, upon examination of evidence, both oral and\ndocumentary, held that Petitioner cannot be held accountable for\nsigning the agreements with respect to five vehicles, pertaining to\nwhich all necessary formalities stood completed even before he joined\nthe Bank and therefore had no role in the transactions. With respect to\nthe second transaction of three vehicles, it is clearly brought forth in\nthe judgment that while the Petitioner had signed the agreements, the\ndocuments pertaining thereto such as the invoices, etc. were neither\nforged nor procured from unauthorized places/persons and it was later\nthat accused No.4 had misused the documents to cheat the Bank and\nthe Petitioner perhaps had no knowledge either of the stop payment of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 17 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\ncheques by M/s. PFLL towards purchase money or insurance premium\nof the vehicles and it cannot be concluded that he had acted\ndishonestly. Trial Court found culpability with respect to 6 accused\nand convicted them while acquitting the Petitioner and to my mind,\nthe mere use of the words 'benefit of doubt' cannot be read out of\ncontext and superfluously and will have to be given a meaning on a\nholistic reading of the judgement, where the Trial Court did not find\nthat any culpability could be attached to the Petitioner.\n\n29. Furthermore, it is not a case where the prosecution has failed to\ntake steps to examine crucial witnesses or the witnesses turned hostile,\netc., which are the category of cases in which the Supreme Court has\nheld that an acquittal will not be termed as an honourable acquittal.\n\n30. There is yet another aspect of the matter. It is true that even\nafter an acquittal in a criminal case, an employee can be subjected to\ndepartmental proceedings and if found guilty of the misconduct,\naction can be taken in accordance with the rules and regulations\ngoverning disciplinary proceedings. Once a departmental proceeding\nis initiated, even on the same allegations for which there is acquittal\nand results in a finding of guilt and imposition of penalty, it is\ncertainly open to an employer to pass an order directing that the\nemployee will not be entitled to back wages for the suspension period\nand treat the suspension period as not spent on duty and/or any other\nconsequence permissible in law. However, in the present case\nRespondent had already taken recourse to this path way back when\ncharge sheet was issued on 06.10.2008. Petitioner had superannuated\nfrom the Respondent Bank on 30.06.2007, whereafter a charge sheet\nwas issued post his retirement, preceded by a show-cause notice on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 18 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\n30.05.2007. The charge sheet pertained to the same set of allegations\nas in the criminal case. Charge sheet was challenged by the Petitioner\nby filing a writ petition in this Court being W.P.(C) No.7481/2008 and\nrelying on\nRegulation 20(3)(ii)\nof 1979 Regulations of the Bank and\nthe judgement of the Supreme Court in\nUCO Bank and Another v.\nRajinder Lal Capoor\n, (2008) 5 SCC 257, this Court quashed the\ncharge sheet vide judgment dated 29.10.2013. Relevant part of the\njudgment is as under:-\n\n\"7. The relevant paras of the judgment of Supreme Court in the\ncase of\nUCO Bank\n(supra) are paras 13 to 23 and 29 to 31 and the\nsame read as under:-\n\n\"13. Sub-regulation (1) of\nRegulation 20\nof the 1979\nRegulations, thus, deals with termination of service where the\nperformance of an officer is unsatisfactory or inadequate or\nwhere there is a bona fide suspicion about his integrity or where\nhis retention in the Bank's service is prejudicial to interests of\nthe disciplinary procedure. Other sub-regulations of Regulation\n20 provide for the mode and manner in which such termination\nmay be effected as also his entitlement to prefer an appeal\nthereagainst and other benefits to which he would be otherwise\nentitled to.\n\n14. Sub-regulation (2) of\nRegulation 20\nof the 1979 Regulations\nplaces an embargo on an official to leave or discontinue his\nservice of the Bank without giving a notice in writing. It\nprescribes a period of notice.\n\n15. Sub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\n, however, places an\nembargo on an officer to leave or discontinue or resign from\nservice without the prior approval in writing of the competent\nauthority and a notice or resignation given by such an officer\nbefore or during the disciplinary proceedings shall not take\neffect unless it is accepted by the competent authority. Clause\n\n(ii) of sub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\nmust be considered\nfrom that aspect of the matter. It raises a legal fiction. Such\nlegal fiction has been raised only for the purpose of \"this\nRegulation\" and for no other, which would mean\nRegulation\n20(1)\n. The final orders which are required to be passed by the\ncompetent authority although indisputably would be in relation\nto the disciplinary proceedings but evidently it is for the purpose\nof accepting resignation or leaving or discontinuing of the\nservice by the employee concerned or grant of approval thereof.\n\nSignature Not Verified Clause (ii) of sub-regulation (3) of Regulation 20 in effect and\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 19 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nsubstance acts as a proviso to Clause (i) thereof.\n\n16. Clause (iii) of sub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\nis an\nindependent provision. It provides for continuation of the\ndisciplinary proceedings. Such disciplinary proceedings\nindisputably for the purpose of applicability of sub-regulation\n(3) must have been initiated in terms of the 1976 Regulations.\n\n17. It is worth noticing the distinction between terminologies\n\"proceeding pending\" or \"proceeding initiated\". Clause (ii) of\nsub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\ndefines what would be\npending viz. for the purpose of attracting Clause (i) thereof.\n\n18. A disciplinary proceeding is initiated in terms of the 1976\nRegulations, which are applicable only in a case where a\nproceeding is initiated for the purpose of taking disciplinary\naction against a delinquent officer for the purpose of imposing a\npunishment on him. Disciplinary proceedings, thus, are initiated\nonly in terms of the 1976 Regulations and not in terms of the\n1979 Regulations.\n\n19. It is worth noticing that the 1979 Regulations would be\nattracted when no disciplinary proceeding is possible to be\ninitiated. The 1976 Regulations, however, on the other hand,\nwould be attracted when a disciplinary proceeding is initiated.\nBoth operate in separate fields. We do not see any nexus\nbetween Regulations 20(1) and 20(2) of the 1979 Regulations\nand the 1976 Regulations.\n\n20. The 1976 Regulations provide for the mode and manner in\nwhich a disciplinary proceeding is initiated. It expressly\nprovides for service of charge-sheet. Service of charge-sheet is a\nnecessary ingredient for initiation of disciplinary proceedings. A\npreliminary enquiry is not contemplated under the 1976\nRegulations. If such an enquiry is held, the same is only for the\npurpose of arriving at a satisfaction on the part of the\ndisciplinary authority to initiate a proceeding and not for any\nother purpose.\n\n21. If it is found that a disciplinary proceeding can be and\nshould be initiated, recourse to the 1976 Regulations would\nhave to be taken, if not, the 1979 Regulations may be resorted to\nif the conditions precedent therefor are satisfied. It is only with\na view to put an embargo on the officer to leave his job, Clause\n\n(ii) of sub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\nof the 1979\nRegulations has been made. It's scope is limited.\n\n22. We have noticed hereinbefore that each regulations operate\nin different fields. When a proceeding is initiated for the purpose\nof taking any disciplinary action on the ground of any\nmisconduct which might have been committed by the officer\n\nSignature Not Verified concerned indisputably the procedures laid down in the 1976\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 20 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nRegulations are required to be resorted to.\n\n23. The 1979 Regulations would be attracted only for the\npurpose of termination of service. Had the intention of the\nregulation-making authority been that the legal fiction created\nunder Clause (ii) of sub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\nwould\ncover both Clauses (i) and (iii), the same should have been\nplaced only after Clause (iii). In such an event, Clause (ii) of\nsub-regulation (3) of\nRegulation 20\nshould have been differently\nworded. Some non obstante clause would have been provided\nfor making an exception to the applicability of the 1976\nRegulations when a legal fiction is created, although it is\nrequired to be taken to the logical conclusion (see East End\nDwellings Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council [1952 AC 109\n: (1951) 2 All ER 587 (HL)] ), but the same would not mean that\nthe effect thereof would be extended so as to transgress the\nscope and purport for which it is created.\n\nxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx\n\n29. In terms of the 1976 Regulations drawing up of a charge-\nsheet by the disciplinary authority is the first step for initiation\nof a disciplinary proceeding. Unless and until, therefore, a\ncharge-sheet is drawn up, a disciplinary proceeding for the\npurpose of the 1976 Regulations cannot be initiated. Drawing\nup of a charge-sheet, therefore, is the condition precedent for\ninitiation of a disciplinary proceeding. We have noticed in para\n15 of our judgment that ordinarily no disciplinary proceedings\ncan be continued in absence of any rule after an employee\nreaches his age of superannuation. A rule which would enable\nthe disciplinary authority to continue a disciplinary proceeding\ndespite the officers reaching the age of superannuation must be\na statutory rule. A fortiori it must be a rule applicable to\ndisciplinary proceedings.\n\n30. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the employer\nmay take resort to a preliminary inquiry, but it will bear\nrepetition to state that the same has a limited role to play. But,\nin absence of the statutory rules operating in the field, resorting\nto a preliminary enquiry would not by itself be enough to hold\nthat a departmental proceeding has been initiated.\n\n31. Initiation of a disciplinary proceeding may lead to an evil or\ncivil consequence. Thus, in absence of clear words, the court\nmust lean in favour of an interpretation which has been applied\nby this Court in the main judgment.\" (underlining added).\n\n8. Since the admitted facts in this case are that chargesheet was\nissued to the petitioner only on 06.10.2008 i.e well after\nsuperannuation of the petitioner on 30.06.2007, therefore, in terms\nof the ratio in the case of\nUCO Bank\n(supra), disciplinary\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 21 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nproceedings are initiated only on issuance of a chargesheet and not\non issuing of show cause notice, and therefore, disciplinary\nproceedings could not be validly initiated in terms of the chargesheet\nissued after the superannuation of the petitioner. The impugned\nchargesheet is therefore liable to be and is accordingly quashed for\nthis reason itself.\n\n9. I may note that the basic charges against the petitioner with\nrespect to the chargesheet issued on 06.10.2008 were with respect to\nfactual allegations of the year 1989 i.e roughly 19 years earlier and\nwhen petitioner was the employee of his then employer M/s New\nBank of India and which bank subsequently merged with the present\nrespondent no. 1-Punjab National Bank. Since the charge sheet itself\nis quashed, and therefore there are no valid disciplinary proceedings\nagainst the petitioner, the respondent no. 1-bank also cannot invoke\n\nRegulation 20(3)(iii)\nto retain the retirement benefits of the\npetitioner.\n\n10. In view of the above, writ petition is allowed by quashing of\nthe charge sheet dated 06.10.2008 issued against the petitioner and\ndirecting that petitioner be paid his retiremental benefits alongwith\ninterest @ 6% per annum simple on the retiremental dues payable\nwith effect from 01.07.2007 and till the amount is paid to the\npetitioner. Parties are liable to bear their own costs.\"\n\n31. From a reading of the judgement, it is explicitly clear that the\ncharge sheet was quashed by the Court on the ground that the\nRegulations did not permit the issuance of the same and since it was\nwithout jurisdiction, no liberty was granted to the Respondent to\nreinitiate the disciplinary proceedings by issuing a fresh charge sheet.\nIt is an admitted position that the judgement was not challenged by the\nRespondent perhaps because it was realized that the issuance of the\ncharge sheet was illegal. The net result is that neither in the\ndepartmental proceedings nor before the criminal court, Respondent\nhas succeeded in proving the allegations/culpability against the\nPetitioner and he will be covered under the expression 'fully\nexonerated' within the meaning of\nRegulation 15(1)\nand therefore the\nimpugned action of denying him the back wages for the suspension\nperiod minus the subsistence allowance is illegal and unjustified.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 22 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\n32. Insofar as the claim of the Petitioner for computing the period\nof suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 for the purpose of\npension is concerned, the same is also valid. Respondent has already\ntreated the said period towards qualifying service for pension but has\ndenied the same for computation of pension as a result of which the\nlength of service for calculation has been taken as 25 years instead of\n31 years. Order dated 11.02.2019 counting the period of suspension\ntowards qualifying service for calculation of terminal dues is extracted\nhereunder for ready reference:-\n\n\"...\n\nReg: Your, representation dated 04.06.2018 with regards to\ntreatment of suspension period (from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000) as\nperiod in service and payment of back wages.\n\nIn continuation to our previous letter dated 21.01.2019 we inform\nyou that the competent authority has agreed to treat your period of\nsuspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 as period of service\nwithout any break. Accordingly, the period of suspension shall be\ncounted as qualifying service for calculation of terminal dues i.e.,\nGratuity and Pension from the date of your acquittal by Hon'ble\nspecial Judge CBI\n(PC Act\n)-06 i.e., 25.05.2018.\"\n\n33.\nIn\nDinesh Kumar Kain v. Assistant General Manager, Corpn\nBank & Anr.\n, 2006 SCC OnLine Del 448, this Court while dealing\nwith a similar issue pertaining to a pari materia regulation, held the\nPetitioner entitled to counting the suspension period for the purpose of\nseniority, increments, etc. In the said case, Petitioner sought quashing\nof an order by which his claim for treating the period of suspension on\nduty with consequential benefits of back wages etc. was rejected.\nPetitioner was arrested and remanded to judicial custody for alleged\noffences under\nPrevention of Corruption Act\n. He was placed under\nsuspension on arrest awaiting the outcome of the trial but no\ndepartmental proceedings were initiated. Petitioner was reinstated into\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 23 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nservice and subsequently he was acquitted of the charges. Invoking\n\nRegulation 15 (1)\nof the Corporation Bank Officer Employees'\n(Discipline & Appeal) Regulations, 1982, Respondent decided not to\ntreat the period of suspension on duty and pay and allowances for the\nsaid period were also declined. Period of suspension was, however,\nreckoned for limited purpose of continuity of service for Gratuity and\nPension and no other purpose. It needs a mention that Regulations\n15(1) and (2) in the said case are pari materia to the Regulations in\nthis case. The stand of the Respondent was that on a combined reading\nof Regulations 15(1) and (2), no employee can claim full back wages\nfor the suspension occasioned by the criminal trial where the acquittal\nwas after giving benefit of doubt.\n\n34. The Court after examining the Regulations and the facts of the\ncase including the order passed by the Respondent, whereby the\nperiod of suspension was treated to reckon for limited purpose of\ncontinuity of service for Gratuity and Pension and no other purpose,\nheld that depriving the Petitioner of continuity of service for the\npurpose of consequential benefits of seniority, increments and other\nnormal benefits would be oppressive and arbitrary.\n\n35. This Court cannot disagree with the Respondent on the\nproposition of law that grant of back wages and/or treatment of\nsuspension period as spent on duty or otherwise is a discretion which\nthe employer is entitled to exercise and in fact, is the domain of the\nemployer. To this extent, the judgements relied upon by the\nRespondent need not be again referred to as the principle is fairly well\nsettled to be open to any debate. However, it is equally well settled\nthat discretion has to be judiciously exercised and an arbitrary exercise\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 24 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nof discretion is open to interference by a Court in judicial review\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India which is an equity\njurisdiction. The impugned order shows that the Respondent has not\nexercised the jurisdiction judiciously and has applied the doctrine of\n'no work no pay' without examining the facts of the present case. It is\ntrue that the Petitioner was not working during the suspension period\nbut that was on account of the suspension order issued by the\nRespondent since at that stage the criminal case was pending.\nHowever, when the impugned order was passed, the facts were on\nrecord and in knowledge of the Respondent that the criminal case had\nresulted in an acquittal and the charge sheet in the departmental\nproceedings stood quashed. At this stage, to invoke the doctrine of 'no\nwork no pay', in my view, was completely arbitrary and illegal.\n\nRegulation 15(1)\nand (3) of Regulations 1977 does entitle the\nRespondent to deny back wages for the suspension period and/or\ntreating the period as not spent on duty, but by a plain reading of the\nRegulation, it is clear that the provisions do not fetter grant of the said\nreliefs. These are enabling provisions permitting the Respondent to\ngrant relief to an employee in case of full exoneration or where the\nsuspension period is unjustified. In light of the two judicial orders in\nfavour of the Petitioner, the question that begs an answer is whether\nthe exercise of discretion to deny reliefs to the Petitioner was judicious\nand the answer can only be in the negative.\n\n36. Learned counsel for the Respondent placed reliance on several\njudgements of the Supreme Court which are\nreferred to above\nin\nparagraphs 13 and 14. The common thread that runs in the said\njudgements is that in case the acquittal is not honourable, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:KAMAL KUMARW.P.(C) 10457/2019 Page 25 of 26\n\nSigning Date:03.06.2023\n\n12:54:39\n\nemployer has the discretion to deny benefits to the employee and the\ngrant of service benefit is not automatic. It bears repetition to state that\nthere can be no quarrel on this binding dictum of the Supreme Court.\nHowever, in the facts of the present case and in the light of the two\njudgements in favour of the Petitioner, one of this Court pertaining to\ndisciplinary proceedings and the other of the Trial Court with respect\nto criminal proceedings, the Respondent cannot take the aid of these\njudgements to deny the benefit of reliefs claimed by the Petitioner in\nthe present petition.\n\n37. For all the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is allowed\nquashing the impugned order dated 21.01.2019 and holding that\nPetitioner will be entitled to back wages for the suspension period,\nminus the amounts paid towards subsistence allowance and the\nsuspension period from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 will be treated as\nspent on duty. Accordingly, this period will be computed towards\ncalculation of pensionary benefits and in light of this, Respondent is\ndirected to refix the salary and emoluments of the Petitioner from\n1994 giving benefits of increments and pay revisions, wherever\napplicable and release the arrears of pension calculated after taking six\nadditional years of service towards computation of pensionary\nbenefits.\n\n38.
