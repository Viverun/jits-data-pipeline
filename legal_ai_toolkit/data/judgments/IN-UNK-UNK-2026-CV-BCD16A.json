Aggrieved by the order allotting seniority to him\nunder the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules, 1954, he\nfiled a writ petition under \nArt. 226\n in the High Court. A\nsingle Judge of the court allowed the petition. However in\nappeal by the State the Division Bench decided against the\nappellant who by special leave appealed to this Court. Two\nother members of the Rajasthan Administrative Service,\nsimilarly aggrieved filed writ petitions under \nArt. 32\n\nbefore this Court. The common questions that fell for\nconsideration in the appeal and writ petitions were; (i)\nwhether rr. 28B(2) and 32 of the Rajasthan Administrative\nService Rules were violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the\nConstitution because they did not contain any guidelines in\nthe matter of determining the merit of candidates; (ii)\nwhether the circular dated August 27, _ 1966 issued by the\nState Government laying down a system of marking for the\npurpose of determining the merit of candidates was invalid\nbecause it was contrary to the relevant Rules in this\nregard. The appellant G also complained that adverse\nremarks in his confidential report which had not been\ncommunicated to him had been taken into account against him\nby the Departmental Promotion Committee.\nHELD:(i) Rule 32 in essence adopts what is stated in r.\n28B. The latter rule provides for two methods of selection\none based on merit and the other based on seniority-cum-\nmerit. In other words, the rule provides that the promotion\nbased on merit in contradiction to that based on seniority-\ncum-merit shall strictly be on the basis of merit. The\nSelection Committee and the Promotion Committee consist of\nvery responsible and senior officers of the State and being\npersons of experience they can be trusted to evaluate the\nmerits of a particular officer. No doubt the word merit' is\nnot capable of easy definition, but it can be safely said\nthat merit is a sum total of various questions and\nattributes of an employee such as his academic\nqualifications, his distinction in the University, his\ncharacter, integrity, devotion to duty and the manner in\nwhich he discharges his official duties. Allied to this may\nbe various other matters or factors such as his punctuality\nin work, the quality and out-turn of work done by him and\nthe manner of his dealing with his superiors and subordinate\nofficers and the general public and his rank in the service.\nThe various particulars in the annual confidential reports\nof an officer is\n901\ncarefully and properly noted, Will also give a very broad\nand general indication regarding the merit of an officer.\nTherefore it cannot be stated that rr. 28B and 32 are in any\nmanner vague or do not give any guidelines forassessing\nthe merit of an officer. [921B-F]\n(ii)(a) The restriction contained in the proviso to sub-r.\n(2) of r. 28B is quitereasonable. Before an officer in\nthe junior scale can be considered as fit for promotion to\nthe senior scale it is necessary that he should have worked\non a post in the service at least for some period of time.\nAs to what the quantum of that period must be is not for\nthis Court to lay down. The Government has fixed this\nperiod as six years. It cannot be said that it is an\nimproper restriction. [922A-B]\n(b)The provisions contained in sub-r. (2) confining the\nselection to senior-most officers not exceeding 10 times the\nnumber of total, vacancies is also reasonable. Such a\nprovision will encourage the members of the service to\naspire for promotion for making themselves eligible by\nincreasing their efficiencies in the discharge of their\nduties. [922B-C]\n(iii)The object of the impugned circular may be to bring\nabout uniformity in the award of marks. But the directions\ncontained therein do offend the rules. This is not a case\nof the Government filling up the gaps or of giving executive\ninstructions not provided for by or not inconsistent with\nthe rules. No discretion is given to the selection or\npromotion committee to adopt any method other than that\nindicated in the circular. According to the principle laid\ndown by this Court in Sant Ram Sharma's case, if the\ncircular dated August 27, 1966 or any part of it gives\ninstructions contrary to or opposed to any of the rules, the\ncircular or that part of the circular to that extent would\nbe invalid. By this test the circular in question was\ninvalid and must be struck down. [928F-929F]\nSant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan & Anr., [1968] 1\nS.C.R. 111, applied.\n(iv)Appellant G had made a specific grievance in his writ\npetition before the High Court about the uncommunicated\nadverse remarks having been taken into account by the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee. The Division Bench of the\nHigh Court was wrong in holding that since the Committee had\nnot been made a party to the proceedings this question could\nnot be gone into. The Government which was the appointing\nauthority was a party before the High Court. It was the\nduty of the State Government to place before the High Court\nall the materials available before it to enable the Court to\nconsider whether the grievance of the appellant was\njustified or not. The appellant's case must therefore be\nreconsidered in the light of the Rules.

(6) Apptts. D/50 dated\nAugust 27, 1966 issued by the Chief Secretary to the\nGovernment of Rajasthan as well as the Order of the\nGovernment of Rajasthan No. F. 2(24) Apptts. (A-IV)/66 dated\nJanuary 4, 1967. In the two writ petitions the Order No. F.\n2(24) Apptts. (A-IV)/66 dated January 22, 1970 and in Writ\nPetition No. 139 of 1970 a further Order of the State\nGovernment No. F. 27(24)A (A-4)/66 dated February 21, 1970\nare also challenged. The nature of the various Orders as\nwell as the Rules and the Circular that are challenged will\nbe referred to later at the appropriate stage.\nCivil Appeal No. 1815 of 1970 arises out of the Division\nBench Judgment of the Rajasthan High Court dated January 20,\n1970 in D. B. Special Appeal No. 57 of 1968. The facts\nleading up to the Civil Appeal may be stated: The appellant\nis an Arts Graduate having taken his degree in 1947. He\ntook his Law Degree in the year 1961 having been placed in\nthe First Division. He joined the service of the former\nJaipur State as Inspector, Customs and Excise, in 1948. On\nthe formation of the United State of Rajasthan, he was\nappointed in the, service of the State of Rajasthan as\nInspector, Customs and Excise. In 1950 the Rajasthan\nAdministrative Service was constituted for the State of\nRajasthan and the Rules governing the 'conditions of service\nof the members therein were framed in 1954 by the Rajpramukh\nunder the proviso to \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution. Under\nthe Rules the Adminisrative Service Cadre has three cadres\nof pay, namely, Ordinary Time Scale, Senior Scale and\nSelection Grade. The appointment to the service cadre was\nby direct recruitment as well\n\n903\n\nas by promotion from other subordinate services in the State\nof Rajasthan. The appointment to the Senior Scale and\nSelection Grade was by promotion from amongst the members of\nthe service. According to the appellant ff. 27 and 32 of\nthe Rules, as they stood originally provided for promotion\nto be made only on the basis of seniority-cum-merit and that\nsub-rule(2) of r. 27 laid down various criteria to be taken\ninto account in the matter of selection of candidates for\npromotion. It was his further case that r. 28, as it\noriginally stood, laid down the procedure for recruitment by\npromotion to the service on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit. The appellant was appointed in the year 1957 as\nmember of the Rajasthan Administrative Service as a result\nof the open competitive examination held by the State Public\nService Commission under the provisions of the Rajasthan\nAdministrative Service (Emergency) Rules, 1956. The\nappellant claimed that his seniority was higher than that of\nrespondents 2 to 5 as is evident from the seniority list\npublished on July 1, 1964. At this stage it may be\nmentioned that though under the Order dated January 4, 1967\nof the State Government fifteen officers in the junior scale\nwere promoted and appointed on an officiating basis to the\nsenior scale of the service, the appellant has made only\nfour of them respondents 2 to 5 as parties in these\nproceedings on the ground that though they were juniors to\nhim, promotion has been given to them superseding his\nclaims. The other officers so promoted, even according to\nthe appellant were senior to him in service. We may also\nmention that respondent No. 5 is since dead, but for\nconvenience he will be referred to by the rank occupied by\nhim as respondent.\n\nIn 1965 the State decided to introduce the system of making\npromotions to the service on the basis of merit alone in\naddition to the existing system of making promotions on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit. With this end in view there\nwere various amendments made to the Rules by which certain\nadditions were made and certain other provisions deleted.\nOn December 14, 1965, r. 28B was incorporated providing for\nappointment by promotion to posts in the service on the\nbasis of merit and on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in\nthe proportion of 50:50 and the number of eligible\ncandidates to be considered for promotion is to be 10 times\nthe total number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis\nof merit as well as seniority-cum-merit. On the same date\nwhen r. 28B was incorporated sub-rule (2) of r. 27 was\ndeleted. On January 7, 1966 sub-rules(2) to (6) of r. 28\nwere also deleted. On December 14, 1965 a Circular was\nissued by the Chief Secretary to the Government of\nRajasthan. According to the appellant the said Circular was\na secret one issued without any authority directing the\nSelection and Promotion Committees and the Appointing\nauthorities to follow the instructions given\n\n904\n\ntherein when making selection, promotion or appointment in\nthe service. The said circular prescribed \"merit formula\nfor making selection of persons to be appointed on the basis\nof merit alone and the seniority-cum-merit formula for\nmaking selection of persons to be appointed on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit.\" The basis for both the types of\npromotions was the marking system indicated in the circular.\nWe do not think it necessary to go more elaborately into the\ndetails of this circular or the authority under which it was\nissued because it is seen that this circular was superseded\nby the circular dated August 27, 1966, which is under severe\nattack in all these proceedings. The contents of the latter\nCircular as well as the authority under which it is\npurported to have been issued will be dealt with by us in\ndue course in the latter part of the judgment. On August\n26, 1966 r. 28B was further amended by providing that the\nproportion of promotion to be made by selection on the basis\nof merit and seniority merit is to be 1:2 instead of 50:50.\nOn the same day a proviso was also added to sub-rule (2) of\nr. 28B providing that only officers who have been in service\nfor not less than six years in the lower grade of the cadre\nwill be eligible for being considered for the first\npromotion in the cadre. On August 27, 1966 the impugned\ncircular was issued by the Chief Secretary to the State\nGovernment. It is the case of the appellant that this\ncircular was issued without any authority and it was again a\nsecret circular giving directions in the matter of\nselection, promotion and appointment to the service to the\nCommittees or the Authorities in charge of the same. The\ncircular again dealt with the merit formula and the\nseniority-cum-merit formulae on the basis of marking system\nindicated therein. On September 8, 1966 the State decided\nto extend the principles of making selections on the basis\nof merit alone to appointments to senior posts also. For\nthis purpose the original r. 32 was substituted by a new\nrule providing for appointments to senior scale and\nselection grade posts on the basis of merit and seniority-\ncum-merit in the ratio of 1: 2 on the recommendation of the\nCommittee constituted under the said rule.\nIt is the case of the appellant that prior to the\nnotification dated September 8, 1966 though many posts in\nthe senior scale of service had fallen vacant even during\nthe years 1963-64 and 1964-65, those posts were not filled\nup by making promotion on the basis of the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit which was in force at the relevant time.\nBy the Order dated January, 1966, the State Government\ncreated 26 new posts in the Senior Scale of Service and 14\nposts in the Selection Grade with effect from the date of\nthe order. As a result of this creation of new posts, about\n44 vacancies became available for being filled up by\npromotion to the Senior Scale of Service in 1965-66.\nNevertheless the vacancies\n\n 905\n\nwere not filed up by the State. After the new r. 32 was\nincorporated on September 8, 1966 the Government took steps\nto fill up the 44 vacancies in the Senior Scale of Service\nand for this purpose a Departmental Promotion Committee was\nconstituted and the Committee met in the end of September,\n1966 for considering the claims of the officers for purposes\nof promotion. On the basis of the recommendations made by\nthe said Committee, the Government by the Order dated\nDecember 7, 1966 promoted 29 officers to the Senior Scale on\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit. Again by the order dated\nJanuary 4, 1967, which is another order under attack in\nthese proceedings, 15 officers including the respondents\nNos. 2 to 5 were promoted to the Senior Scale of Service on\nthe basis of merit alone.\n\nAccording to the appellant by the Orders dated December 7,\n1966 and January 4, 1967 promotions had been made quite\ncontrary to rr. 28B and 32 of the Rules. It is the\ngrievance of the appellant that under the Order dated\nJanuary 4, 1967 a large number of officers who had qualified\nfor promotion on the basis of merit under the merit formula\nwere superseded by the officers junior to them. Though\nRules 28B and 32 provided for selection on the basis of\nmerit gave no indication or guidance as to what are the\nfactors to be taken into account in assessing the merit of\nan officer. The promotions had also been made by the\nCommittee adopting the principle of awarding marks as direc-\nted by the Circular dated August 27, 1966 which had been\nissued without any authority of law. The appellant filed S.\nB. Writ Petition No. 79 of 1967 in the High Court\nchallenging the vires of rr. 28B and 32 as violative of\nArts. 14 and 16. The appellant also challenged the validity\nand legality of the Circular dated Angus 27, 1966 as well as\nthe order dated January 4, 1967 giving promotions to the\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 5 to the senior Posts, In the writ\npetition the appellant had alleged that the various amend-\nments made to the rules from time to time and the delay in\nmaking promotions to Senior Posts were all with a view to\nshow favourtism to the third respondent who was the son-in-\nlaw of the Chief Minister of Rajasthan and to the other\nrespondents who are all near relations of persons who were\nthe favourites of the Chief Minister of the State.\nAccording to the appellant, the Circular dated August 27,\n1966 was issued without any authority and in any event the\nGovernment by execution instructions had no power to fetter\nthe powers of the Selection Committees which were\nfunctioning under the statutory rules. Even the principles\nlaid down in the Circular regarding the award of marks for\nassessing the merit were arbitrary and vague. Rules 28B and\n32 were challenged as violative of Arts. 14 and 16 inasmuch\nas the basis of merit had not been defined anywhere in the\nrules and no principles or guidelines had been laid down in\nthe rules for assessing the merit of an officer.\n\n906\n\nThe provisions laying down the criteria for judging the\nmerit of an officer contained in sub-rule (2) of r. 27 as\nwell as the procedure for assessing the said merit contained\nin cls. 2 to 6 of r. 28 having disappeared by the deletion\nof those provisions, according to the appellant, arbitrary\npowers had been conferred by the rules on the Committees to\nselect any person they liked on the ground of merit. Apart\nfrom the attack levelled against rr. 28B and 32 that there\nwere no principles laid down for judging the merits of an\nofficer, the appellant also attacked as discriminatory and\nviolative of Arts. 14 and 16, the provisions of r. 28B\nproviding that the number of eligible candidates to be\nconsidered was to be 10 times the total number of vacancies\nto be filled up and that six years service was essential for\nan officer to be eligible for being considered for first\npromotion.\n\nThe Order dated January 4, 1967 was attacked on the ground\nthat the promotions had been made on the basis of illegal\nrules as well as the directions contained in the invalid\nCircular dated August 27, 1966. In particular the appellant\ncontended that though his service record for the year 1965-\n66 was quite good. nevertheless certain adverse remarks\ncontained in the confidential rolls which were not\ncommunicated to him, had been taken into account by the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee, which met in the last week\nof September, 1966 and hence there has been no proper\nconsideration of his claims for being promoted to the Senior\npost. On all these grounds the appellant attacked rules 28B\nand 32, the Circular dated August 27, 1966 and the Order\ndated January 4, 1967. He also alleged mala fide against\nthe State.\n\nThe respondents Nos. 2 to 5 do not appear to have filed any\ncounter-affidavit. But the State contended that rr. 28B and\n32 were not invalid and did not violate the provisions\neither of \nArt. 14\n or \nArt. 16.\n The requirement in the rules\nregarding promotion to be based on merit was justified as\nsuch selection was necessary to achieve efficiency in\nservice. The State controverted the allegations of mala\nhides made by the appellant. Though it was admitted that\nthe third respondent was the son-in-law of the Chief\nMinister of the State, it was denied that any favoritism was\nshown by the State either to that respondent or to the other\nrespondents in the matter giving promotions to them. On the\nother hand, the Departmental Promotion Committee considered\nthe claims of the appellantand other officers and on\nassessment of the various claims of the officers promotions\nwere given to the officers mentioned in theOrder dated\nJanuary 4, 1967 by the State Government on thebasis of\nthe recommendation of the Departmental Promotion Committee\nwhich has also recommended respondents 2 to 5. The State\nfurther contended that though promotions\n\n907\n\nhad not been made to the Senior Scale in the year 1963-64\nand 1964-65, it was not with a view to favour any particular\nofficer. Apart from the fact that the State Government had\nthe power either to fill up the posts or keep them vacant,\nin this particular case the vacancies were not filled up as\nan amendment of the rules was in contemplation of the State\nGovernment. It was urged that the rules contained various\nprinciples for assessment of merit of an officer.\nRegarding the Circular dated August 27, 1966, the State\ncontended that the marking system laid down in the Circular\nfor assessment of merit of an officer was calculated to\nensure objectivity of approach on the part of the Selection\nCommittee. As there were as many as 35 sets of service\nrules governing various services, the Circular was issued to\nbring about uniformity in the procedure for assessment of\nmerit and for making selections on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit. The State claimed that it has ample powers to\nissue such a Circular. Regarding the validity of the\nCircular the State contended that the Circular dated August\n27, 1966 was issued by the Chief Secretary in his\nadministrative capacity being the Head of the Service in the\nState. It is within his competence to give guidance for the\nproper working of any governmental machinery. The circular\nis not intended to be a piece of legislation nor is it an\norder of the Government.\n\nRegarding the confidential reports of the appellant the plea\nof the State Government was that the confidential reports of\nall the officers including that of the appellant were before\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee when it met for making\nselection in September, 1966 and that there was nothing\nillegal in the said Committee considering the adverse\nremarks, if any, made in those reports. The State finally\nprayed for dismissal of the writ petition.\nThe learned Single Judge who dealt with the writ petition\nheld that rr. 28B and 32 were not violative of either Arts.\n14 or 16. The principle of merit embodied in the rules was\nvalid and the Committee charged with the duty under the\nrules of considering the claims of various officers for\npromotion was quite competent to take all the relevant\nfactors when assessing the merits of an officer regarding\nhis suitability for promotion. The learned Judge further\nheld that the principle of merit of an officer being\nconsidered for promotion embodied in the rules, was really\nbased on the recommendation of the Administrative Reforms\nCommittee. However, the learned Judge held that the\nprovision in sub-rule (2) of r. 28B restricting the number\nof eligible candidates to be considered for promotion to\nten times the total number of vacancies, was violative of\n\nArt. 16\n inasmuch as the claims\n\n908\n\nof various other eligible officers for being considered for\npromotion was barred. The learned Judge further held that\nthis portion of sub-rule (2) of r. 28B is not easily\nseverable from the remaining portion of sub-rule(2) of r.\n28B and in consequence be held that the whole of sub-rule(2)\nof r. 28B was bad. After considering the relevant portions\nof the Circular dated August 27, 1966, the learned Judge\nheld that the administrative instructions contained therein\nhad to be adopted and followed by these Committees. The\ndirections contained therein did not leave any choice to the\nCommittees to ignore the same. The administrative\ndirections contained in the said Circular, according to the\nlearned Judge, provided a rigid formula for being adopted in\nthe matter of selection for promotion and the directions\ncontained therein restricted the powers and functions of the\nCommittees functioning under the statutory rules. According\nto the learned Judge, even on merits, cannot be considered\nto be reasonable. In this view the circular was held to be\nbad as being repugnant to the rules. Regarding the\npromotions made under order dated January 4, 1967, the\nlearned Judge held that the directions contained in the\nCircular must have been taken into account by the Selection\nCommittee and hence the promotions were not valid. On this\nreasoning, the learned Judge, by his judgment and order\ndated November 7, 1968 held that sub-rule (1) of r. 28B and\nr. 32 were valid and that sub-rule (2) of r. 28B was\nviolative of \nArt. 16\n and hence that sub-rule was bad. The\ncircular dated August 27, 1966 was struck down and the\npromotions of respondents made under the order dated January\n4, 1967 were also struck down.\n\nAggrieved by the judgment and order of the learned Single\nJudge, the first respondent, the State, filed D. D. Special\nAppeal No. 57 of 1968 and the respondents Nos. 2 and 3 filed\nD. B. Special Appeal No. 55 of 1968. The appellant herein\nfiled cross-objections, in the appeal filed by the State\nchallenging the decision of the learned Single Judge\nupholding the validity of sub-rule (1) or r. 28B and r. 32.\nThe Division Bench by its order and judgment dated January\n20, 1970 allowed the two appeals Nos. 55 and 57 of 1968 and\ndismissed the cross-objections filed by the appellant. The\nDivision Bench held that the view of learned Single Judge\nthat r. 28B(2) was bad was erroneous. On the other hand,\nthe Division Bench held that restricting the eligibility of\nofficers who have put in at least six years of service was\nquite reasonable and the further provision in r. 28B(2)\nregarding the field of selection being confined to senior\nmost officers in the Junior Scale not exceeding 10 times\nthe total number of 'Vacancies was also\n\n909\n\nreasonable. Differing from the learned Single Judge, the\nDivision Bench held that no part of r. 28B(2) was invalid.\nThe Division Bench agreed with the views of the learned\nSingle Judge regarding the validity of sub-rule (1) of r.\n28B and r. 32. Regarding the Circular dated August 27,\n1966, the learned Judges held that the marking system\nindicated therein was really based upon the previous\nCircular dated August 31, 1960 under which merit was to be\nevaluated by allotting marks on the previous record of an\nofficer. The said Circular of 1960 had been in operation in\nrespect of the said services except the Rajasthan Judicial\nService or the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, which were\nunder the control of the High Court. It is the view of the\nDivision Bench that the Circular of 1966 was very elastic\nand gave wide discretion to the Committees to assess the\nmerit of an officer. The Circular has done nothing except\nto lay down broad guidelines for the excercise of discretion\nby the Promotion Committee. The system of marking indicated\nin the Circular was quite good as it brought about\nuniformity in the procedure for assessment of merit. On\nthis reasoning the learned Judges held that the Circular of\n1966 was valid and it was in no way repugnant to the rules.\nRegarding the authority for the Circular, the learned Judges\nnoted that there has been some confusion in the stand taken\nby the State from time to time even when they made\napplications for amending their counter-affidavit for making\nit clear that the Circular has been issued not by the Chief\nSecretary in his individual capacity but by the State\nGovernment. Ultimately, the Division Bench held that they\nhad examined the cabinet file produced before them along\nwith the note sheets and that the Court was satisfied that\nthe Circular of 1966, has been issued with the approval of\nthe State Government. The learned Judges rejected the plea\nof mala fides raised by the appellant herein. Regarding the\nallegation made by the appellant that the adverse remarks\nwhich had not been communicated to him had been taken into\naccount by the Promotion Committee in September, 1966, the\nlearned Judges held that as the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee had not been impleaded as a party, the question\nwhether the adverse remarks made against the appellant had\nbeen taken into account by the said Committee cannot be gone\ninto in these proceedings. Regarding the promotions made\nunder the Order dated January 14, 1967, the Division Bench\nupheld the same as it had already held that rules 28B and 32\nas well as the Circular of 1966 were all valid. Civil\nAppeal No. 1815 of 1970 is against the decision of the\nDivision Bench, reiterating the objections regarding the\nvalidity of the rules, the Circular, as well as the\npromotions made.\n\nWrit Petition No. 76 of 1970 is filed by Motilal Kakkar,\nApart from challenging rr. 28B and 32 and the Circular of\n\n1966\n\n910\n\nand the promotions made under the order dated January 4,\n1967, the writ petitioner challenges also the order dated\nJanuary 22, 1970 confirming the promotions of respondents 2\nto 16 in the Senior Scale. The facts leading up to the writ\npetition are as follows :\n\nThe petitioner after obtaining his M. A. Degree in History\nand the Law Degree from the Lucknow University joined\nservice in the erstwhile State of Jodhpur on August 1, 1943\nas a Special Officer (Settlement). He entered the Jodhpur\nState Civil Service on March 13, 1946 as a result of the\ncompetitive examination held by the Public Service\nCommission of that State. At the time of the formation of\nthe Rajasthan Union, the petitioner was working as Assistant\nDirector, Civil ?Supplies, Jodhpur. Ultimately the\npetitioner was appointed to the Rajasthan Administrative\nService with effect from January 6, 1950. He has been\nserving in various capacities and he was also sent for\nhigher training to the United States of America by the\nGovernment of India during the period March 23, 1958 to\nSeptember 27, 1958. The petitioner thereafter was sent on\ndeputation to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi as an\nAssistant Commissioner during the period June 17, 1963 to\nApril 21, 1964. Later on he was on deputation as Principal,\nTribal Orientation and Study Centre during the period May\n22, 1964 to March 31, 1967. He became the District Manager\nof Food Corporation of India and was holding that post since\nJuly 1, 1968. After giving the history sheet of respondents\nNos. 2 to 16, the petitioner claims that he was the senior\nmost amongst them and that his seniority has been so stated\nin the relevant seniority list. After referring to the\nrules as originally framed and the amendments made from time\nto time, the petitioner attacks the validity of rr. 28B and\n32 and the Circular dated August 27, 1966 on the same\ngrounds as those mentioned in Civil Appeal No. 1815 of 1970.\n\nAccording to the petitioner respondent Nos. 2 to 16 were all\nhis juniors and on the basis of the illegal rules and the\ndirections given in the Circular, officiating promotions\nhave been given to those respondents to the Senior Scale\nunder the Order dated January 4, 1967.\n\nThe petitioner further states that after the judgment of the\nDivision Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, which is under\nattack in the Civil Appeal, the State Government passed an\norder on January 22, 1970 confirming the promotions of\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 16 in the Senior Scale. According to\nthe petitioner as the officiating promotions given to those\nrespondents under the Order dated January 4, 1967 were\ninvalid. the order of confirmation is also equally bad.\nTherefore, he seeks to get that order; also quashed.\n\n911\n\nThe State- Government has filed a very elaborate counter-\naffidavit. The stand taken by the State in respect of rr.\n28B and 32 as well as the Circular of 1966 and the Order\ndated January 4, 1967 is the same as in the Civil Appeal.\nThe State has further contended that as the rules are valid\nand the circular is also valid, the officiating promotions\ngiven under the Order dated January 4, 1967 are also valid.\nIn consequence the State points out that the order of\nconfirmation dated January 22, 1970 is also valid. The\nState disputes the allegation of mala fides and has also\npointed out that the Departmental Promotion Committee\nconsidered the claims of all the respondents including that\nof the petitioner for promotion. Promotions were made by\nthe Government on the basis of the recommendation of the\nsaid Committee. The State finally prays for the dismissal\nof the writ petition.\n\nComing to Writ Petition No. 139 of 1970, the petitioner\nchallenges the validity of the IT. 28B and 32, the Circular\ndated August 27, 1966 and the Orders dated January 4, 1967\nand January 22, 1970. The officers covered by those orders\nare respondents Nos. 3 to 17. The petitioner further\nchallenges the order dated February 21, 1970 passed by the\nState Government promoting and confirming in the Senior\nScale the respondents Nos. 18 to 33. The facts leading up\nto this writ petition may be stated:\n\nThe petitioner after obtaining the B. Sc. (Hons.)\nAgricultural Degree in the First Division from the Delhi\nUniversity and the LL. B. Degree from the Agra University\njoined service in the Delhi Administration on February 6,\n1954 as Extension Officer, Agriculture. On January 12, 1959\nhe was promoted as Block Development Officer in the Delhi\nAdministration, in which capacity he continued till\nSeptember 30, 1960. The petitioner joined the Rajasthan\nAdministrative Service on October 1, 1960 after having\npassed the competitive examination held by the State Public\nService Commission. After the probationary period of one\nyear, he was confirmed in the service with effect from\nOctober 1, 1961. His rank has been given as Nos. 332 in the\nSeniority List of the Rajasthan Administrative Officers\nissued in 1964. The petitioner gives the rank of some of\nthe respondents. After referring to the rules as well as\nthe amendments made from time to time and the Circular of\n1966, the petitioner levels the same attack as against them\nsimilar to those in the civil appeal. The petitioner then\nrefers to the officiating promotions to the Senior Scale\ngiven to the respondents Nos. 3 to 17 by the Order dated\nJanuary 4, 1967 as well as to the Order dated January 22,\n1970, confirming their promotions. According to the\npetitioner these orders are illegal and invalid for the same\nreasons urged in the civil appeal. The petitioner further\nsays that several officers were selected on probationary\nbasis and given promotions, but only respondents\n91 2\nNos. 18 to 33 were confirmed by the order dated February 21,\n1 970. These orders, according to the petitioner, are\nillegal and tile petitioner's claim for promotion has not\nbeen properly considered.\n\nThe stand taken by the State Government in this writ peti-\ntion is also similar to the stand taken in Writ Petition No.\n76 of 1970, which, we have already pointed out, again is\nsimilar to the stand taken in the civil appeal. According\nto the State Government the claim of the petitioner is not\nsustainable as he was ineligible for consideration for\npromotion under the rules. The State further contends\nthat the petitioner has not put inthe minimum period of six\nyears of service which is a condition precedent for\nconsideration for promotion to the Senior Scale under r. 32\nread with r. 28(2) of the. Rules. The State further\ncontends that the respondents Nos. 18 to 33 were selected by\nthe Promotion Committee for likely vacancies and their\nselections were in accordance with the Rules. Their\npromotions were delayed because of the orders of stay\ngranted by the Rajasthan High Court in certain writ\npetitions filed before it. As soon as stay was vacated, the\nState Government decided to promote those officers, who had\nbeen duly selected. Therefore, according to the State\nGovernment the orders dated January 22, and 21st February,\n1970 are legal and valid.\n\nFrom the statement of facts mentioned above, it will be seen\nthat the main questions that arises for consideration relate\nto the validity of rr. 28B and 32 and the Circular dated\nAugust 27, 1966. The decision regarding the orders dated\nJanuary 4, 1967, January 22, 1970 and February 21, 1970 will\nlargely depend upon the opinion expressed on the validity of\nthe Rules and the Circular.\n\nWe will first take up for consideration the attack levelled\nagainst rr. 28B and 32 as being violative of Arts. 14 and\n\n16. We have already referred to the fact that this attack\nis made on these rules on the ground that there is no\ncriteria laid down in the rules for assessing the merit of\nthe officers concerned when their claims are being\nconsidered for promotion to the Senior Scale. The further\nground on which this attack is made is that the Rules give\narbitrary powers to the Promotion Committees in the matter\nof assessing the merits of an officer.\n\nAccording to the State, on the other hand, the Rules are\nvalid and the promotions on the basis of merit are also\nvalid.\n\nIt is now necessary to refer to the relevant rules as they\noriginally stood as well as to the amendments made thereto\nfrom time to time. In 1954 the rules were framed by the\nRajpramukh\n\n913\n\nunder the proviso to \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution to\nregulate conditions of service of the officers in the\nRajasthan Administrative Service. We have already referred\nto the fact that the Rajasthan Administrative Set-vice was\nfanned in the year 1950. There were three Grades in the\nService :\n\n (i)Ordinary Time Scale Rs. 285-800 (herein\n after to be referred as the Junior Scale);\n\n (ii) Senior Scale Rs. 500-1150;\n\n (iii)Selection Grade Rs. 900-1500.\n\nIn the Civil Appeal and the two writ petitions we are\nconcerned with the promotions from junior scale to the\nsenior scale. Rule 7 relates to the sources of recruitment\nto the Service. They are, (a) by competitive examination;\n\n(b) by promotion of administrative subordinate service, (c)\nby selection from amongst the prescribed categories of\nExtension Officers and (d) by special selection from amongst\nthe persons other than the administrative subordinate\nservice in condition with the affairs of the State.\nPart IV of the Rules deals with the procedure for direct\nrecruitment. The procedure for recruitment by promotion is\ndealt with in Part V, Rule 27, as originally framed dealing\nwith the criterion for selection was as follows\n \"Rules 27. Criterion for selection : (1) For\n purposes of recruitment by\n promotion/selection/special selection shall\n be. made an the, basis of 'seniority-cummerit'\n from among all-the administrative subordinates\n Extension officers and others who are eligible\n for promolion, selection and special selection\n respectively under the provisions of the Rules\n (2)In selecting the candidates for\n promotion, regard shall be had to their;\n\n (a) personality and character;\n\n (b) tact and energy (including ability to\n undertake\n extensive tours);\n\n (c)intelligence and ability to express\n themselves in English and Hindi clearly,\n\n (d) court and other work-,\n\n (e) integrity; and\n\n (f) previous record of service.\"\n\n58-1 S. C. India/71\n\n914\n\nThe procedure for promotion was laid down in r. 28 as it\nonginally stood. Under sub-rule(1) when a decision is taken\nthat a certain number of vacancies in the service are to be\nfilled up by promotion, the Appointment Department has to\ninform the Board and the latter has to call upon all\nCollectors to submit their recommendations by a prescribed\ndate. It was further provided that the Appointment\nDepartment should also call upon the Heads of the Department\nconcerned to submit their recommendations through their\nrespective Administrative Secretaries by a prescribed date.\nSub-rules (2) to (6) dealt with the various details\nregarding the submission of the list by the District\nCollector, the various particulars to be mentioned by the\nCollector, to the Board, scrutinising the list furnished by\nthe Collector and preparing a list in the order of seniority\nof candidates considered suitable for promotion. Those sub-\nrules also dealt with the Head of the Department preparing a\nlist of candidates, eligible for promotion in the order of\nseniority and. recording. this remarks in respect of those\nofficers. Sub-rule (7) provided for the Committee consis-\nting of the, officers mentioned therein considering the\ncases of all the candidates recommended by the Board and the\nAdministrative Secretaries and interviewing them, if\nnecessary. It also provided for the Committee selecting the\nrequisite number of candidates equal to the number of\nvacancies likely to occur in the Service and to be filled up\nby promotion and to the list being prepared in the order of\nseniority. The Committee has also to make another\nsupplementary list in the manner mentioned therein in the\nsaid sub-rule. Under sub-rule (8) both the lists prepared\nby the Committee are to be submitted to the Government, who\nafter scrutinising the same have to forward them to the\nPublic Service Commission along with the character rolls,\npersonal files and other particulars relating to the\nofficers mentioned therein. Under sub-rule (9) the names of\nthe candidates considered to be suitable by the Commission\nare to be reported to the Government for final selection.\nUnder sub-rule (10) it is provided that the final selection\nis to be made by the Government and against of candidates\nconsidered suitable for promotion is to be arranged in the\norder of their seniority.\n\nRule 32 of the Rules as it originally stood made provision\nfor appointment to the Senior scale in the Cadre and it was\nas follows\n \"Rule 32, Appointments to Senior Posts:\n\n Appointments (including in an\n officiating/temporary capacity) to senior\n posts shall be made by the Government from\n amongst members of the Service on the basis\n of seniority-\n\n 915\n\n cum-merit on the. recommendations of a\n Committee which shall consist of the following\n officers : -\n\n (1) Chairman, Rajasthan Public service\n Chairman\n Commission Or a Member nomi-\n nated by him.\n\n (2)Chairman, Board of Revenue\n Member\n (3) Commissioner, Development Depart-\n Member\n ment\n (4) Special Secretary to the Government\n Member\n in the Appointments Department\n Secretary\n\nThe Committee shall consider the cases of the persons eligi-\n\nble for promotion by examining their confidential rolls and\npersonal files interviewing such of them as they deem\nnecessary and shall select a number of candidates equal to\nthe number of vacancies likely to be filled by promotion.\nProvided that Government may fill a vacancy in the senior\ngrade temporarily by appointing thereto for a period not\nexceeding six months in an officiating capacity, any member\nof the Service who is eligible for such appointment under\nthese Rules.\"\n\nIt will be seen by a reference to the rules extracted above\nthat promotion was to be on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit. Under sub-rule (7) of r. 28 and r. 32 a committee\nhas been constituted and it is on the basis of the\nrecommendation made by the said Committee that the promotion\nis ultimately made by the Government.\n\nIn 1965 the State Government took a decision to introduce\nthe system of recruitment to the service by promotion on the\nbasis of merit alone. On December 14, 1965 a notification\nwas issued amending the Rules. A new rule 28B dealing with\nthe promotion by selection on the basis of merit was\nincorporated, The said rule as originally framed was as\nfollows :\n\n \"28-B Promotion by selection on basis of\n merit\"\n\n (1) Appointment by promotion to posts in the\n Service shall be made by selection strictly on\n the basis of merit and on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit in proportion of 50:50.\n Provided that if the appointing authority is\n satisfied that suitable persons are not\n available for appointment by promotion\n strictly on the basis of merit in a particular\n year appointment by promotion on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit may be made in the same\n manner as specified in these rules.\n\n 916\n\n (2) Selection strictly on the basis of merit\n shall be made from amongst persons who are\n otherwise eligible for promotion under these\n rules; the number of eligible candidates to be\n considered for the purpose shall be ten times\n the total number of vacancies to be filled in\n on the basis of merit and seniority un-merit\n provided such number is available; where the\n number of eligible candidates exceeds ten\n times the number of vacancies, the requisite\n number of senior-most persons shall be\n considered for the purpose.\n\n (3) Except as otherwise expressly provided\n in this rule the procedure prescribed for\n selection to the post on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit shall, so far as may be,\n be followed in making selection strictly on\n the basis of merit.\n\n (4) The Committee shall prepare a separate\n list of candidates selected by it on the basis\n of merit and shall arrange their names in\n order of preference.\n\n (5) Where consultation with the Commission\n is necessary the list prepared by the\n Committee shall be forwarded to the Commission\n by the appointing authority along with the\n personal files and confidential rolls of all,\n persons whose names have been considered by\n the Committee.\n\n (6) The Commission shall consider the lists\n prepared by the Committee along with other\n documents received from the appointing\n authority and unless any change is considered\n necessary, shall approve the lists, and if the\n Commission considers it necessary to make any\n change in the lists received from the\n appointing authority the Commission shall\n inform the appointing authority of the changes\n proposed and the appointing authority, after\n taking into account the commences, if, any,\n may approve the lists finally with such\n modifications, as may in his opinion, be just\n and proper.\n\n (7) Appointment shall be made by the\n appointing authority taking persons out of the\n list finally approved under the proceeding\n sub-rule in the order in which they have been\n placed in the list.\n\n (8) Among persons appointed in the same\n class,. category or grade of posts during the\n same year, persons appointed on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit shall rank senior to those\n appointed by promotion on the basis of merit;\n the seniority inter se of persons appointed in\n the\n\n 917\n\n same class, category or grade of posts by\n promotion strictly on merit, shall, without\n regard to the order of preference, be\n determined as if such persons had been\n appointed by promotion on the seniority-cum-\n merit.\n\n (9) The provisions of this rule shall have\n effect notwithstanding anything to the\n contrary contained in any other provisions of\n these rules.\n\n Explanation :-For the purpose of determining\n the number of vacancies to be filled on either\n basis under sub-rule (1), the following cyclic\n order shall be followed from year to year.\n\n \"The first by merit.\n\n The next by seniority-cum-merit.\n\n The next by merit.\n\n The next by one by Seniority-cum-Merit\n The cycle to be repeated.\"\n\nBy the same notification of December 14, 1965 sub-rule (2)\nof r. 27 was deleted. On January 7, 1966, a further amend-\nment was made to the rules by deleting sub-rules (2) to (6)\nof r. 28. It will be seen that under the new r. 28B,\npromotion to posts in the service is to be made by selection\non the basis of merit and on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit in the proportion of 50:50. Sub-rule (2) provided for\nthe manner of selection on the basis of merit. Under sub-\nrule (3) procedure prescribed for selection to the posts on\nthe basis of seniority-cummerit has to be followed as far as\npossible in making selection strictly on the-basis of merit.\nOn August 26, 1966 by a notification certain amendments were\nmade in r. 28B. Under subrule (1) of r. 28B, the original\nproportion of selection on the basis of merit and on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit was altered and the proportion\nwas fixed as 1:2. A proviso was also added to sub-rule (2)\nof r. 28B, which is as follows :\n\n \"Provided that for the first Promotion in the\n same cadre (from a lower grade to higher\n grade) against the merit only such of the\n persons shall unless a higher period is\n prescribed elsewhere in these rules be\n eligible who have put in not less than six\n years of service in the lower grade of the\n cadre.\"\n\n 918\n\nOn September 8, 1966, the old r. 32 was substituted by a,\nnew rule dealing with the appointment to Senior Posts. The\nsaid new rule 32 runs as follows :\n\n \"32(1) Appointment to senior posts\n Appointment to Senior scale and selection\n grade posts shall be made by Government from\n amongst the members of the service on the\n basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit in the\n ratio of 1:2 on the recommendations of a\n Committee which shall consists of the follow-\n ing :-\n\n \"(1) Chairman, Rajasthan Public Service\n Commission, or a Member\n nominated by him.\n\n Chairman.\n\n (2) Chairman, Board of Revenue\n Member.\n\n (3) Commissioner. Development De-\n\n partment.\n\n Member.\n\n (4) Special Secretary to Government\n in the Appointments Department.\n Member.\n Secretary.\n (2) Except as provided in this rule, the\n\n procedure and the principles for selection by\n merit, shall, in so far as it may apply, be\n the same as provided in rule 28B. For\n selection by seniority-cum-merit, the Com-\n mittee shall consider the cases of all the\n persons eligible for promotion by examining\n their confidential Rolls and Personal files\n and interviewing such of them as may deem\n necessary, and shall select a number of\n candidates equal to the number of vacancies\n likely to be filled by promotion by seniority-\n cum-merit:\n\n Provided that Government may MI a vacancy in\n the Senior scale or selection grade posts\n temporarily by appointment thereto for a\n period not exceeding six months in an\n officiating capacity, any member of the\n service who is eligible for such appointment\n under the rules.\"\n\nThis new rule was also incorporated to give effect to the\nGovernment's decision taken in 1965 to introduce the system\nof recruitment to the service by promotion on the basis of\nmerit, as a result of which r. 28B was earlier incorporated.\nRule 32 really deals with appointments to Senior Posts; and\nunder the old rule the promotion was to be on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit. That is altered under the new rule to\npromotion on the basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit and\nthe proportion is also 1:2 as already laid down, by the\namendment made on August 26, 1966. Sub-rule (2) of new r.\n32, as will be seen, provides for the procedure and\n\n 919\n\nthe principles for selection by merit being the same as\nprovided in r. 28B. Therefore, it will be seen that the\nposition as it stood at the time when promotions of the\nvarious respondents in the appeal and in the writ petitions\nwere made was :\n\n (1) the promotions had to be made on the\n basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit in the\n ratio of 1:2 as provided by Rule 32 read with\n r. 28B;\n\n (2) under the proviso to sub-rule 2 of r.\n\n 28B the minimum period of eligibility for\n being considered for the first promotion is\n six years of service in the lower grade of the\n cadre;\n\n (3) under sub-rule 2 of r. 28B the selection\n for promotion is restricted only to officers\n eligible for promotion under the rules coming\n within ten times the total number of vacancies\n to be filled up on the basis of merit and\n seniority-cum-merit;\n\n (4) under r. 32 appointments to Senior scale\n and Selection cadre posts are also on the\n basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit in the\n ratio of 1:2, and\n (5) recommendations for appointments and\n promotions are to be made by the Committees\n concerned.\n\nIt is the grievance of the appellant and the writ\npetitioners that the combined effect of the addition of r.\n28B and the deletion of sub-rule (2) of r. 27 and sub-rules\n(2) to (6) of r. 2B is that although a provision has been\nmade for recruitment to the service by promotion on the\nbasis of \"merit alone\" no criteria) for assessing the merit\nand suitability of the candidates have been provided in the\nrules as they stand. In fact their further contention is\nthat sub-rule (2) of r. 27 had laid down the various\ncriteria for considering the suitability of a candidate and\nsub-rules (2) to (6) of r. 28 had dealt with the procedure\nfor selection of such candidates. When once these sub-rules\nhave been deleted there is no guidance whatsoever furnished\nby the rules, as they now stand, for assessing the merit.\nFurther, the restriction placed under r. 28B that only\ncandidates coming within 10 times the number of vacancies\nthat have to be filled up will be considered for selection\nand the further restriction therein that for the first\npromotion six years' service is essential, are violative of\nArts. 14 and 16. Rule 32, according to Mr. Garg, (toes not\nalso lay down any guidance or principle for assessing the\nmerit of candidates for promotion to Senior posts.\nWe are not inclined to accept these contentions of Mr. Garg.\nWe have already referred to the fact that the learned Single\nJudge, in the writ petition leading up to the civil appeal,\nis of the view that rr. 28B and 32 do not offend either \nArt.\n14\n or 16. But the\n\n920\n\nlearned Judge is of the view that as there is a restriction\nplaced upon the number of officers whose claims could be\nconsidered, under sub-rule (2) of r. 28B, that part of the\nsub-rule was invalid as offending \nArt. 16.\n As the said part\ncannot be separated, according to the learned Judge, from\nthe other parts of the sub-rule, the whole of sub-rule (2)\nof r. 28B was struck down. The Division Bench, on the other\nhand, has disagreed with this view of the learned Single\nJudge and has upheld the validity of the entire subrule (2)\nof r. 28B. We are in agreement with the views expressed by\nthe Division Bench that rr. 28B and 32 do not offend either\n\nArt. 14\n or 16.\n\nNor are we impressed with the contention of Mr. Garg that\nthere is no principle laid down in the rules for assessing\nthe merit of an officer especially after the deletion of\nsub-rule (2) of r. 27 and sub-rules (2) to (6) of r. 28. No\ndoubt sub-rule (2) of r. 27 enumerated certain factors or\nmatters to be taken into account in selecting candidates for\npromotion. Sub-rules (2) to (6) of r. 28, no doubt also\ndealt with certain aspects of procedure to be adopted for\npromotion. The deletion of the sub-rules, in our opinion,\ndoes not make the rules 28B and 32 in any manner invalid.\nWe have already extracted the relevant rules and also\npointed out that the selection or promotion is to be\nconsidered by the Committees referred to therein. It is no\ndoubt argued by Mr. Garg that introduction of the idea of\nmerit in the procedure of promotion brings in an element of\npersonal evaluation and such personal evaluation opens the\ndoor to the abuse of nepotism and favouritism. Hence it is\nargued that there is a violation of the constitutional\nguarantee under Arts. 14 and 16.\n\nWe-are unable to accept this contention. The State Govern-\nment has taken a decision in 1965 that selection to the\nservice and promotion have to be on the basis of merit and\nsenioritycum-merit. There can be no controversy that the\nmain object in such matters is to serve public interest and\nnot the personal interest of the members of the official\n\n-roup concerned. As stated by Leonard D. White in his\nIntroduction to the Study of Public Administration, 4th\nEdition p. 380: \"The Public interest is best secured when\nreasonable opportunities for promotion exist for all\nqualified employees, when really superior civil servants,\nare enabled to move as rapidly up the promotion ladder as\ntheir merits deserve and as vacancies occur, and when\nselection for promotion is made on the sole basis of merit.\nFor the merit system ought to apply as specifically in\nmaking promotions as in original recruitment.\"\nThe above statement has been quoted with approval by this\nCourt in \nSant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan and\nAnother\n(1) We may also point out that the Administrative\nReforms\n(1) [1968] 1 S. C. R. 1 1 1.\n\n 921\n\nCommittee has also emphasised that merit should be given\nadequate weightage in the matter of promotion especially for\nsenior appointments to ensure greater efficiency in\ngovernment functioning and also to provide adequate\nincentive to government servants to give their best.\nRule 32 in essence adopts what is stated in rule 28B. The\nlatter rule provides for two methods of selection: one based\non merit and the other based on seniority-cum-merit. In\nother words, the rule provides that the promotion based on\nmerit in contradistinction to that based on seniority-cum-\nmerit shall strictly be on the basis of merit. The\nSelection Committee and the Promotion Committee consist of\nvery responsible and senior officers of the 'State and being\npersons of experience they can be trusted to evaluate the\nmerits of a particular officer. No doubt the term 'merit'\nis not capable of an easy definition, but it can be safely\nsaid that merit is a sum total of various qualities and\nattributes of an employee such as his academic\nqualifications, his distinction in the University, his\nCharacter, integrity, devotion to duty and the manner in\nwhich he discharges his official duties. Allied to this may\nbe various other matters, or factors such as his punctuality\nin work, the quality and outturn of work done by him and the\nmanner of his dealings with his superiors and ,subordinate\nofficers and the general public and his rank in the service.\nWe are only indicating some of the broad aspects that may be\ntaken into account in assessing the merits of an officer.\nIn this connection it may be stated that the various\nparticulars in the annual confidential reports of an\nofficer, if carefully and properly noted, will also give a\nvery broad and general indication regarding the merit of an\nofficer. Therefore, it cannot be stated that rr. 28B and 32\nare in any manner vague ,or do not give any guide line for\nassessing the merit of an officer. No doubt sub-rule (2) of\nr. 27 dealt with certain factors which are to be taken into\naccount for considering the claims for promotion, but when\nit comes to a, question of merit, not only those factors but\nalso certain additional factors and circumstances will have\nto be taken into account and such an evaluation of merit has\nbeen left under the rules to a Committee consisting of res-\nponsible, senior and experienced officers of the State.\nWe are also not impressed with the contention that Rule\n28B(2) and its proviso confining the selection to senior-\nmost officers not exceeding ten times the number of total\nvacancies to be filled up and the further restriction\nregarding the eligibility of officers who have put in at\nleast six years of service for first promotion offend \nArt.\n16\n of the Constitution. In this respect also we agree with\nthe views expressed by the Division Bench of the Rajasthan\nHigh Court in D. B. Special Appeal\n\n922\n\nNo. 57 of 1968, The restriction contained in the proviso to\nsubrule (2) of r. 28B in our opinion, is quite reasonable.\nBefore an officer in the Junior scale can be considered as\nfit for promotion to the Senior scale, it is necessary that\nhe should have worked on a post in the Service at least for\nsome period of time. As to what quantum of that period must\nbe is not for this Court to lay down. The Government has\nfixed this period as six years. We are not in a position to\nsay that it is an improper restriction. The provisions\ncontained in sub-rule (2) confining the selection to senior-\nmost officers not exceeding 10 times the number of total\nvacancies is also, in our opinion, reasonable. Such a\nprovision will encourage the members of the service to\naspire for promotion for making themselves eligible by\nincreasing their efficiency in the discharge of their\nduties. We are of the view that rr. 28B and 32 do not\noffend either \nArt. 14\n or 16 of the Constitution.\nNow coming to the Circular dated August 27, 1966, we find it\ndifficult to agree with the view of the Division Bench of\nthe Rajasthan High Court. On the other hand, we are\ninclined to agree with the decision of the learned Single\nJudge in Writ Petition No. 79 of 67. The contention of Mr.\nGang is that the Circular by executive instructions has\nabridged or curtailed drastically the exercise of discretion\nby the Departmental Promotion Committee constituted under\nthe rules. In fact his plea is that the circular has\nsuperseded the statutory rules framed under the proviso to\n\nArt. 309.\n On the other hand, it is the contention of the\nlearned Solicitor-General, appearing for the State and of\nMr. B. Sen, learned counsel appearing for some of' the\nrespondents, that the Circular has not in any manner inter-\nfered with the powers of the Committees constituted under\nthe Rules. On the other hand, in order to bring about\nuniformity in the application of the principles for\nassessing the merit the marking system which has been in\nvague from 1960 has been adopted with slight modifications\nin the Circular of 1966. The instructions contained in the\nCircular only provide guidance to the Committees concerned\nand those instructions do not in any way contravene any of\nthe rules.\n\nBefore we deal with this aspect, we can dispose of a subsi-\ndiary contention that has been raised by Mr. Garg.\nAccording to him the circular has been issued by the Chief\nSecretary as the Head of the Service and it is not an order\nof the Government. This has been accepted by the State\nGovernment. If so, it follows that the Circular is illegal\nand void. We have already referred to the stand taken by\nthe State Government in this regard. They have specifically\ntaken the stand that the circular has been issued by the\nChief Secretary as the Head of the Service. Before the\nDivision Bench in the High Court when this matter was again\n\n 923\n\nraised by the appellant, it is seen that an application for\namending their counter-affidavit was made by the State to\nmake the position clear that the Circular was issued with\nthe approval of the Government. As pointed out by the\nDivision Bench there is some confusion in this regard. But\nultimately the Division Bench has stated that they\nthemselves have gone through the Cabinet file and the notes\nand satisfied themselves that the Circular has been issued\nwith the approval of the Government. Therefore it follows\nthat the Circular is an order of the Government and not of\nthe Chief Secretary alone.\n\nThen the question is whether the Government is competent to\nissue the said Circular and whether the Circular in any\nmanner effects the discretion and powers of the Committee\nfunctioning under the statutory rules. The position is\nclear, as \nlaid down by\n this Court in \nSant Ram Sharma v.\nState of Rajasthan and another\n(1):\n\n \"It is true that the Government cannot amend\n or supersede statutory rules by administrative\n instructions, but it the rules are silent on\n any particular point Government can fill up\n the gaps and supplement the rules and issue\n instructions not inconsistent with the rules\n already framed.\"\n\nHaving due regard to the principles stated above, we will\nnow examine the scope and contents of the Circular. The\nCircular contains administrative instructions and it does\nnot profess to lay down anything else. The Government have\nissued those instructions \"for the guidance of all\nselection/promotion committee and appointing authorities\nmentioned in the statutory service Rules. These\nadministrative instructions and the statutory service Rules\nshould together be taken as a complete code on the subject.\"\nFrom the above extract it is clear that in the matter of\nselection or promotion the Committees concerned are enjoined\nnot only to have regard to the statutory rules under which\nthey function, but also to the administrative instructions\ngiven in the Circular. This makes it very clear that it is\nnot open to the Committee concerned to ignore the\ninstructions contained in the Circular or to act contrary to\nthe directions contained therein. Therefore, it will be\nseen that if the Circular or any part of it gives\ninstructions contrary to or opposed to any of the rules, the\nCircular or that part of the Circular to that extent will be\nin-. valid. In particular we may refer to paragraphs 3 and\n5 of the Circular. Paragraph 3 deals with the merit formula\nand is as follows :\n\n(1) [1968]1 S. C. R. 111.\n\n924\n\n 3(a) \"Merit formula\" means that out of 75\n marks (marking system has been defined in\n paragraph 5), a person should get a minimum of\n 65 marks for consideration of his case for\n promotion among those who have secured 65 or\n more marks, the person who gets highest marks\n will be the first to be promoted, and the\n person who comes next in the range of marks\n will be the second to be promoted, and so on.\n The inter-se seniority of persons had been\n appointed in the same class, category or grade\n of posts by promotion strictly on merit shall\n without regard to the order of preference, be\n determined as if such persons had been\n appointed by promotion on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit. This is illustrated by\n the following example\n Name of the No. of Seniority in\n the\n Officer Marks. next below\n grade.\n\n A 75 8\n B 73 9\n c 70 4\n D 69 3\n E 65 1\n\n That if there are 5 vacant posts to be filled\n by promotion on the basis of 'merit' formula\n the inter-se seniority of these 5 selected\n persons will be the same as in next below\n grade, but if only 3 posts are to be filled\n then those who have secured 75, 73 and 70\n marks respectively will be selected and the\n remaining left out. The inter-se seniority\n amongst these selected shall be the same as\n the next below grade.\n\n (b)The eligible candidates for promotion on\n the basis of 'merit' formula shall be 10 times\n the total number of vacancies to be filled by\n way of promotion provided such number is\n available and they should be holding the post\n in the next below cadre in substantive capa-\n city. As for example, if there are twelve\n posts to be filled by way of promotion on the\n basis of both the formula (viz. four posts for\n merit and eight for seniority-cum-merit) the\n total number of eligible candidates for\n promotion on the basis of merit formula shall\n be 120. If available, if an officer could not\n secure 65 marks continuously for 5 years he\n will not be included in this list of eligible\n candidates.\n\n (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in\n sub-para (b) above, for first promotion by\n merit, only such of the candidates shall be\n eligible who have put in six years service in\n the cadre on the date of selection.\"\n\n925\n\nParagraph 4 of the Circular lays down what is \"senioritycum-\nmerit\" formula. The marking system which is applicable both\nto the selection based on 'merit' as well as to the\nselection based on \"seniority-cum-merit\" is contained in\nparagraph 5. That paragraph reads as follows :\n\n \"Para-5 The marking system will be as follows\n\n (a)Confidential Rolls for the 5 calendar\n years immediately 'preceding the date of\n selection will be examined. 5 marks will be\n ear-marked for each year's confidential Roll,\n and the marking will be:-Excellent report-5\n marks, Very good report-4 marks; Good report\n\n -3 marks; Satisfactory report-2-1/2 marks;\n\n Unsatisfactory report-2 marks-, Adverse\n report-1-1/2 marks; Adverse report with\n punishment 1 mark. If a person has been\n awarded either 'Merit Pay' or 'Cash award' by\n the Government, then the Committee may award\n him upto 5 more marks in addition to the marks\n already obtained by him. These additional\n marks will not be taken into consideration at\n the time of the next selection.\n\n (b)The record of service, which means\n service book, personal file, and Confidential\n Rolls other than the Confidential Rolls of the\n 5 years immediately preceding the selection\n maintained after the formation of Rajasthan,\n will be allotted 50 marks, and the marking\n will be (a) average or satisfactory record 50\n marks, and (b) deduction upto 2 marks for each\n punishment according to gravity may be made\n (no deduction will be made for mere warning,\n but where warning has been recorded in\n Confidential Roll, it should be considered as\n punishment and marks should be deducted).\n 'Recorded warning' means censure given by way\n of punishment under the C.C.A. Rules. If some\n marks have been deducted for any punishment\n out of 50 marks in any year of selection, then\n that deduction should not be repeated or\n counted in the next selection. Also if some\n marks have been deducted from the Confidential\n Roll of a particular year, then that deduction\n should not be repeated or counted next time.\n That Confidential Roll should be considered\n satisfactory, and marks awarded accordingly,\n with a view to ensure implementation of this,\n it would be necessary for the promotion\n Committee to keep a record of such deductions\n and additional marks as the case may be.\n\n 926\n\n (c)On the basis of above marking, only such\n persons who have secured a minimum of 6-1/2\n marks out of the total of 75 marks will be\n considered for promotion on the basis of\n 'Seniority-cum-merit' formula. Thus, as has\n been mentioned earlier, even if a junior\n person secures more than 621 marks, the senior\n will not be superseded if he has secured 62-\n 1/2 marks. Under the 'merit' formula those\n who have secured 65 marks or more will only be\n considered for promotion.\"\n\nParagraph 6 dealing with officers, who can be called for\ninterview provides that a person who has secured less than\n62-1/2 marks shall be called for interview.. But persons who\nget less than 61 marks, should not. be called for interview.\nIt further provides that those persons whose confidential\nRolls were missing or whose confidential Rolls could not be\nprepared in their absence for study or training outside\nIndia should also be called for interview.\nPara 7 of the circular lays down that adverse remarks re-\ncorded in the Confidential Rolls should be communicated to\nthe person concerned in time, so that he may get an\nopportunity to represent his case to the authority\nconcerned. However, if by chance, adverse remarks have not\nbeen communicated to him, or if the adverse remarks have\nbeen communicated but his representation had not been\ndecided by the appropriate authority, then in that event the\nperson concerned should be called for interview by the\nselection or the promotion committee and before he is asked\nto appear for interview adverse remark should be\ncommunicated to-him so that he could come prepared with what\nhe has to say in the matter. It was left open to the\nselection or promotion committee to treat the adverse\nremarks as expunged and then award marks if it felt that the\nadverse remarks were not justified. It was clearly\nemphasised that normally efforts should be made to\ncommunicate the adverse remarks and to decide the\nrepresentations before the selection committee meets.\nIn para 9 of the circular it was pointed out to all\nselection committees and appointing authorities that the\nassessment of confidential rolls and the awarding of remarks\nthereon should be rational, judiciously liberal and\nobjective, the reason being that at times a confidential\nroll may have been written with a greater sense of\nresponsibility and at other times it may not have been given\ndue care. It was also observed by way of illustration that\none officer might be liberal in the assessment of his\nsubordinates while another may be a bit miserly or sometimes\nindicative. It was, in order to have a balanced approach in\nthe matter it might at time be worthwhile for the selection\ncommittee as also\n\n927\n\nfor the appointing authority to consider whether the\nreporting officers themselves enjoyed reputation for\nefficiency, impartiality and integrity.\nFinally the circular pointed out that the instructions\ncontained therein should be strictly kept in view while\npersons are being considered for promotion, the reason being\nthat evaluation and assessment of confidential rolls make or\nmar the service prospects of ,government employees.\nOne gets a fairly good picture of the nature of the instruc-\ntions contained in the circular issued by the Government.\nNo doubt a properly evaluated marking system may be helpful\nfor assessing the merit of persons who are already in\nservice. But the instructions given in the circular are so\nrigid that they are ,opposed to the selection to be made\nstrictly on merit as provided under rr. 28B and 32.-\nFor instance the marking system provides 50 marks for the\nrecord prior to 5 years and for the five years preceding the\nselection the marking of 25 is to be on the basis of\nconfidential rolls. From this it is clear that an officer\nwho has rendered less than five years of service will not\nbe eligible to get a single mark ,out of 50 which is\nprovided for the record for the period preceding five years\nfor the simple reason that he will have no such record. The\nofficer who has put in less than five years of service has\nbeen straightaway denied 50 marks out of 75 marks and he has\nto establish his worth within the small range of 25 marks on\nthe basis of his confidential rolls which will be available\nfor a period of less than five years. This formula of\nmarking is certainly opposed to r. 28B and r. 32, the object\nof which is to ensure that merit and merit alone is to form\nthe basis for promotion, as against the quota fixed for\nmerit, in contradistinction to seniority-cum-merit.\nSimilarly, when one considers the question of first\nselection, the position is still more anamolous. An officer\nWho has put in just six years of service will get 50 marks\nfor his record of previous service which just exceeds five\nyears by one year. Another officer will have to face the\nsituation with a longer period of service. There can be no\ncomparison of the claims of the two officers on merits.\nWhile the rules give a wide discretion to the Committee for\njudging merit, paragraphs 3 and 5 of the circular place\nundue, restrictions and limitations on the exercise of dis-\ncretion and thus fetter the powers of the Committee. That\nis opposed to rr. 28B and 32.\n\n928\n\nSimilarly, in the matter of giving marks for excellent\nreport, very good report, good report, satisfactory report,\nunsatisfactory report, adverse report and adverse report\nwith punishment, the circular is arbitrary. It will be seen\nthat an officer who has satisfactory report gets 2-1/2\nmarks, and another officer with an unsatisfactory report\ngets 2 marks. The officer with an adverse report gets 1-1\\2\nmarks. , We fail to see any rhyme or reason in this marking\nsystem.\n\nAgain, under the Rules the Committee concerned, has a\ndiscretion if it deems necessary to call for interview any\nperson, whose claims are being considered by it. But this\nexercise of discretion is drastically curtailed by paragraph\n6 of the circular laying down the circumstances under which\na person, should or should not be called for interview. The\nCommittee under the said paragraph has only to mechanically\napply the directions contained therein. This provision is\nagain a serious inroad on the powers conferred on the\nCommittees by the Rules.\n\nWe are not inclined to accept the view of the learned Judges\nof the Division Bench that the circular merely gives a broad\nguidance to the Committees concerned and that the\ninstructions contained therein are elastic. Nor are we\ninclined to accept their reasoning that the Committees have\nstill got discretion to ignore the directions contained in\nthe circular and assess the merit of an officer by\nindependent evaluation. No such indication is available, so\nfar as we could see, in the circular. On the other hand,\nthe indications axe to the contrary. The circular enjoins\nthe Committees to treat the administrative instructions and\nthe statutory Service Rules together as a complete Code.\nThe object of the circular may be to bring about uniformity\nin the award of marks. But the directions contained therein\ndo' offend the rules. This is not a case of the government\nfilling up the gaps or of giving executive instructions on\nmatters not provided for by or not inconsistent with the\nrules. 'Me learned Judges of the Division Bench of the High\nCourt, have by and large, upheld the validity of the marking\nsystem as well as the other instructions contained in the\ncircular of 1966 on the ground that the marking system as\npointed out by the State has been in vogue from 1960, on the\nbasis of a previous circular, dated August 31, 1960 issued\nby the State Government. Reliance placed upon this circular\nof 1960 by the High Court, in our opinion, is not justified.\nWe have gone through the circular of 1960 which is No. F.\n1(6) Apptts. (D)160 dated 31-8-1960. That circular was\nissued by the State to clarify the misapprehension that\nappears to have been caused in the application, for\npromotion of the principle of merit-cum-seniority or\nseniority-cum-merit. For the\n\n 929\n\npurpose of having uniformity, the State Government had laid\ndown certain principles in the said circular to be borne in\nmind by the Promotion Committees. No doubt there is a\nmarking system indicated therein. But there are two\nfeatures which distinguish the circular of 1960 from that of\nthe 1966 circular. In paragraph 3 of the former circular,\nit is specifically laid down that the principles mentioned\ntherein are only in the nature of executive instructions to\nbe kept in view by the Committees when making promotions.\nIt is made clear that those Committees should, however,\nexercise their own discretion while applying the above\nprinciples in view of the fact that occasionally the\nConfidential Rolls may not have been written with full sense\nof responsibility. Moreover, some of the rules permit\ninterview before selection and in such cases the Selection\nCommittee will have to assess suitability of the officer as\na result of the interview also.\" Under the circular of 1966,\nwe have already indicated, no such discretion is left to the\nSelection or Promotion Committees to adopt any method other\nthan that indicated in the circular. In fact it is\nemphasised that the statutory service rules and the\ninstructions contained in the circular are to be treated as\na complete code by the Committees. Another point to be\nnoted is that in 1960 the question of promotion on the basis\nof merit alone had no place. That principle was adopted\nonly, as pointed out by us earlier, in1965 which led to\nthe amendment of the rules. Therefore, the principles\nmentioned in the circular of 1960 cannot be relied on when\nconsidering the validity of the present circular, when\npromotion by merit alone has been recognised by the rules\nfrom 1965. We have already indicated that the instructions\nin the 1966 circular contravene the Rules. Therefore, we\nare of the opinion that the circular dated 27-8-1966 is bad\nand accordingly it is struck down. We make it clear that we\nexpress no opinion on the validity or otherwise of the cir-\ncular of 31-8-1960. We have only referred to that circular\nto show that the High Court has committed an error in\nplacing reliance on the same.\n\nNow, coming to the promotions and confirmations made, under\nthe orders dated January 4, 1967, January 22, 1970 and\nFebruary 21, 1970, we are not inclined to disturb those\norders except to the extent indicated below in respect of\nthe promotions of respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in Civil Appeal\nNo. 1815 of 1970 under the first order dated January 4, 1967\nand their confirmation, by the second order dated January\n22, 1970.\n\nWrit Petitions Nos. 76 and 139 of 1970 have been filed in\nthis Court. only after the judgment dated January 20, 1970\nof the High Court in D. B. Special Appeal No. 57 of 1968.\nThe petitioners must have been aware that the appellant was\nchallenging only the promotions of four officers in his writ\npetition\n59-1 S.C.R. India/71\n\n 930\n\nin the High Court. Nevertheless, they kept quite and\nallowed the officiating promotions of all the officers to\nstand from 1967 and even kept quiet till the government\nconfirmed the promotion of those officers on January 22,\n1970. So far as the writ petitioners are concerned, the\nState must be considered to be justified in passing the\norder dated January 22,,1970, on which date the High Court's\njudgment was in its favour. We are entitled to take this\ncircumstance into account for denying the larger reliefs\nclaimed by the writ petitioners when they attack the orders\ndated January 4, 1970 and January 22, 1970.\nWe have referred earlier to the various orders that are\nbeing challenged in these writ petitions, apart from the\nattack on rr. 28B and 32. Under the order dated January 22,\n1970, the officers who had been promoted to officiating\nposts in the senior scale in January 4, 1967 have been\nconfirmed. We have held earlier that these orders cannot be\nreopened at the instance of these writ petitions. Another\nset of officers, who had been selected earlier, were\nappointed by promotion to the senior scale post by the order\ndated February 21, 1970. We are holding later that no\nrelief can be granted to the concerned writ petitioner even\nregarding this order.\n\nSo far as respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the Civil Appeal No.\n1815 of 1970 are concerned, we are giving separate\ndirections, regarding the reconsideration of their promotion\nand confirmation, along with the appellant in the appeal.\nThe fact that the respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the civil\nappeal have been confirmed on January 22, 1970 after the\ndecision of the High Court in favour of the State and those\nofficers is of no consequence, so far as the appellant is\nconcerned, if their original officiating promotion on\nJanuary 4, 1967 requires reconsideration by the Government.\nTheir confirmation will stand or fall depending on the final\ndecision of this Court regarding the order dated January 4,\n1967.\n\nThe appellant in the civil appeal is not challenging the\nofficiating promotions or confirmation made of the officers\nother than respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the appeal. Hence the\npromotions given and confirmations made of the other\nofficers under orders dated January 4, 1967 and January 22,\n1970 respectively should be allowed to stand. It is also\nseen that the order dated February 21, 1970 was passed by\nthe State Government, after the order of stay was vacated by\nthe High Court. The State Government, as pointed out\nearlier, was justified in passing the order dated January\n22, 1970 except regarding respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the\nappeal, on the basis of the Division Bench judgment of the\n\n 931\n\nHigh Court which had upheld the validity of the rules and\nthe circular. The same reasoning will apply to the order of\nFebruary 21, 1970 also. Therefore, the petitioner in writ\npetition No. 139 of 1970, who alone is challenging this\norder, will not be entitled to have that order reopened.\nThus both the writ petitioners will be only entitled to have\na declaration that the circular dated August 27, 1966 is\ninvalid and that it is struck down. They are' not entitled\nto any further reliefs in the writ petitions.\nIn the civil appeal Guman Singh, the appellant has raised a\ncontention that promotions of respondents Nos. 2 to 4 were\nmade on January 4, 1967 on the basis of illegal rules and\ninvalid circular. He has further contended that the\nPromotion Committee which met in September, 1966 has taken\ninto account the adverse remarks made against him which were\nnot justified and which were not communicated to him. We\nhave already expressed our views upholding the validity of\nthe rules and the invalidity of the circular. In support of\nthe contention that adverse remarks were taken into\nconsideration by the Committee, he relied upon the following\ncircumstances : The Deputy Commissioner has written a letter\ndated April 28, 1966 strongly appreciating his services as\nan officer. While so, it is a matter of surprise that\nadverse remarks came to be made in September, 1966. The\nnature of the adverse remarks has been referred to by the\nDivision Bench. It is admitted by the State that the\nPromotion Committee had met in the end of September, 1966\nand made recommendations regarding the officers who are to\nbe promoted. It is also admitted by the State Government\nthat the confidential rolls of all the officers were before\nthe Selection Committees They have not denied that the\ncircular was not taking into account by the Committee. On\nthe other hand, they have impliedly accepted that the\ncircular was before the Committee at the time of considering\nthe promotions. According to the appellant adverse remarks\nwere communicated to him only on May 11, 1967, long after\nthe decision of the Promotion Committee. Hence the\nCommittee has illegally taken into consideration the adverse\nremarks made against him and has denied him promotion on\nthat account. His contention is that after the adverse\nremarks were communicated to him, long, afterwards he made\nrepresentations and the adverse remarks were directed to be\nexpunged. In this connection, learned counsel relied upon\nthe counter-affidavit filed in this Court on behalf of the\nState in writ petition No. 76 of 1970 to the effect that the\nadverse entries in the confidential rolls of Shri Guman\nSingh, the appellant, were expunged on his representations.\nTherefore, according to the appellant, his claims for\npromotion have not been properly dealt. with by the\npromotion Committee.\n\n932\n\nThe allegation of the appellant in his writ petition that\nthe promotion Committee had taken into consideration the\nadverse remarks, when it met in September, 1966, does not\nappear to be unfounded, however, as we are giving directions\nfor reconsideration of the appellant's claims for promotion,\nif otherwise he is eligible under the Rules, we do not\nexpress any opinion on this aspect as facts have to be\ninvestigated.\n\nThe learned Judges of the 'Division Bench have brushed aside\nthe grievance of the appellant regarding This matter by\nobserving that as the Departmental Promotion Committee is\nnot a, party to the proceedings, the question whether the\nCommittee took into account the adverse remarks said to have\nbeen made against the appellant, cannot be gone into in\nthese proceedings. This approach made by the learned Judges\ndoes not appeal to us. The Government, which is the\nappointing authority, was a party before the High Court. It\nmust have had before it, when it passed the orders on\nJanuary 4, 1967, all the records regarding promotion. It\nwas the duty of the State Government to place before the\nHigh Court all the materials available before it to enable\nthe Court to consider whether the grievance of the appellant\nwas justified or not. The appellant had made a specific\ngrievance in his writ petition about the uncommunicated\nadverse remarks having been taken into account by the\nCommittee. The Government could have obtained a report or\nan affidavit regarding the true facts from a responsible\nofficer of the Committee and placed it before the High\nCourt. Anyhow, as- mentioned earlier, it is not necessary\nfor us to pursue this aspect further except to point out\nthat we do not agree with the reasoning of the High Court in\nthis regard. The High Court has also declined to interfere\nwith the order dated January 4, 1967 as it upheld the\nvalidity of rr. 28B and 32 as well as the circular of August\n27, 1966. Though we are upholding the validity of the two\nrifles, we disagree from the High Court's view regarding the\nvalidity of the circular. We are also giving separate\ndirections regarding the order dated January 4, 1967.\nWe are, accordingly of the opinion that so far as the appel-\nlant (in the civil appeal) and respondents Nos. 2 to 4 are\nconcerned, the officiating promotions made of the latter\nofficers on January 4, 1967 as well as their confirmation by\norder dated January 22, 1970 will have to be reviewed and\nreconsidered by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the\nGovernment. It is needless to state that the circular dated\nAugust 27, 1966 should not be taken into consideration. The\nclaims of the appellant and respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the\nappeal will have to be considered only on the basis of the\nRules. We also make it clear\nthat a reconsideration of the claims of the appellant and\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 4 will be necessary, only if the\nappellant, is found, in the first instance, to be eligible\nas per the Rules for being considered for promotion. His\neligibility is to be decided with reference to the date when\nthe Departmental promotion Committee met in September, 1966\nfor considering promotion. This direction becomes necessary\nas we are upholding the validity of Rules 28B and 32. If\nultimately, respondents Nos. 2 to 4 are found eligible for\npromotion under the rules, they will retain their rank on\nthe basis of promotion given to them on January 4, 1967. If\nnot, suitable alterations will have to be made both in this\norder as well as in the order of January 22, 1970. Once\nagain we are emphasising that the fact that the respondents\nNos. 2 to 4 have been confirmed on January 22, 1970, is of\nno consequence because if their original promotion on\nJanuary 4, 1967 is not valid, their confirmation on January\n22, 1970 will not have any greater sanctity. Of course, if\non reconsideration they are found eligible for promotion,\ntheir confirmation and rank given to them win stand.\nThe allegations of mala fides made by the appellant against\nthe State have been, in our opinion, rightly rejected by the\nDivision Bench. Mala fides were alleged against the State\nin amending the Service Rules from time to time and the\ndelay in making promotions on the ground that they were all\ndone with a view to help the son-in-law of the Chief\nMinister and the other officers who were relations of\npersons in the good books of the Chief Minister. The same\nallegations have been repeated in the two writ petitions\nalso. Those allegations have been denied by the State. For\nthe reasons given by the Division Bench, with which we\nagree, we have no hesitation in rejecting the allegations of\nmala fides made by the appellant in the appeal and in the\nwrit petitions.\n\nIn the appeal and the writ petitions we hold that rr. 28B\nand 32 are valid and that the circular dated August 27, 1966\nis struck down as illegal and invalid. In the writ\npetitions there will be only a declaration that the circular\ndated August 27, 1966 is invalid and that it is struck down.\nIn other respect both the writ petitions will stand\ndismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\nSo far as the appeal is concerned there will be a further\norder at subject to the observations contained in this\njudgment a direction will issue to the first respondent, the\nState to instruct the Departmental Promotion Committee to\nreview and reconsider the promotions already given to\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the appeal under the order dated\nJanuary 4, 1967 and\n\n934\n\nto decide their claims afresh only on the basis of the\nRules. If the appellant is found eligible for being\nconsidered for promotion under the Rules, his claim also\nwill have to be considered along with that of the\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 4. No directions are necessary\nregarding respondent No. 5 as he is already dead. Depending\non the fresh recommendations, any, made by the Departmental\nPromotion Committee, the first respondent, will also make\nany modifications that may be found necessary in the orders\ndated January 4, 1967 and January 21, 1970. The modi-\nfications, if any, will be confirmed only to the appellant\nand the respondents Nos. 2 to 4 as the appellant is not\nchallenging the promotions given to other officers under the\nsaid two orders. If ultimately respondents Nos. 2 to 4 are\nfound eligible for promotion and the appellant is not found\neligible, the rank given to those respondents will remain\nthe same as is now due to them as per the orders dated\nJanuary 4, 1967 and January 21, 1970. Otherwise, suitable\nalterations will have to be made.\n\nPending the review and reconsideration, ordered as above,\nand which must be done as expeditiously as possible, and\ndepending upon the result of the same, the promotion already\ngiven to respondents Nos. 2 to 4 to the senior scale will\ncontinue to be in force.\n\nIn the result the order and judgment of the Division Bench\nof the High Court upholding the validity of the circular\ndated August 27, 1966 and declining to interfere with the\norder dated January 4, 1967 so far as the appellant and\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 4 are concerned are hereby set aside\nand the appeal allowed to that extent.\n\nParties will bear their own costs throughout.\nG. C.\nAppeal allowed in part.\n\n935",

      "text": "before this Court. The common questions that fell for\nconsideration in the appeal and writ petitions were; (i)\nwhether rr. 28B(2) and 32 of the Rajasthan Administrative\nService Rules were violative of Arts. 14 and 16 of the\nConstitution because they did not contain any guidelines in\nthe matter of determining the merit of candidates; (ii)\nwhether the circular dated August 27, _ 1966 issued by the\nState Government laying down a system of marking for the\npurpose of determining the merit of candidates was invalid\nbecause it was contrary to the relevant Rules in this\nregard. The appellant G also complained that adverse\nremarks in his confidential report which had not been\ncommunicated to him had been taken into account against him\nby the Departmental Promotion Committee.\nHELD:(i) Rule 32 in essence adopts what is stated in r.\n28B. The latter rule provides for two methods of selection\none based on merit and the other based on seniority-cum-\nmerit. In other words, the rule provides that the promotion\nbased on merit in contradiction to that based on seniority-\ncum-merit shall strictly be on the basis of merit. The\nSelection Committee and the Promotion Committee consist of\nvery responsible and senior officers of the State and being\npersons of experience they can be trusted to evaluate the\nmerits of a particular officer. No doubt the word merit' is\nnot capable of easy definition, but it can be safely said\nthat merit is a sum total of various questions and\nattributes of an employee such as his academic\nqualifications, his distinction in the University, his\ncharacter, integrity, devotion to duty and the manner in\nwhich he discharges his official duties. Allied to this may\nbe various other matters or factors such as his punctuality\nin work, the quality and out-turn of work done by him and\nthe manner of his dealing with his superiors and subordinate\nofficers and the general public and his rank in the service.\nThe various particulars in the annual confidential reports\nof an officer is\n901\ncarefully and properly noted, Will also give a very broad\nand general indication regarding the merit of an officer.\nTherefore it cannot be stated that rr. 28B and 32 are in any\nmanner vague or do not give any guidelines forassessing\nthe merit of an officer. [921B-F]\n(ii)(a) The restriction contained in the proviso to sub-r.\n(2) of r. 28B is quitereasonable. Before an officer in\nthe junior scale can be considered as fit for promotion to\nthe senior scale it is necessary that he should have worked\non a post in the service at least for some period of time.\nAs to what the quantum of that period must be is not for\nthis Court to lay down. The Government has fixed this\nperiod as six years. It cannot be said that it is an\nimproper restriction. [922A-B]\n(b)The provisions contained in sub-r. (2) confining the\nselection to senior-most officers not exceeding 10 times the\nnumber of total, vacancies is also reasonable. Such a\nprovision will encourage the members of the service to\naspire for promotion for making themselves eligible by\nincreasing their efficiencies in the discharge of their\nduties. [922B-C]\n(iii)The object of the impugned circular may be to bring\nabout uniformity in the award of marks. But the directions\ncontained therein do offend the rules. This is not a case\nof the Government filling up the gaps or of giving executive\ninstructions not provided for by or not inconsistent with\nthe rules. No discretion is given to the selection or\npromotion committee to adopt any method other than that\nindicated in the circular. According to the principle laid\ndown by this Court in Sant Ram Sharma's case, if the\ncircular dated August 27, 1966 or any part of it gives\ninstructions contrary to or opposed to any of the rules, the\ncircular or that part of the circular to that extent would\nbe invalid. By this test the circular in question was\ninvalid and must be struck down. [928F-929F]\nSant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan & Anr., [1968] 1\nS.C.R. 111, applied.\n(iv)Appellant G had made a specific grievance in his writ\npetition before the High Court about the uncommunicated\nadverse remarks having been taken into account by the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee. The Division Bench of the\nHigh Court was wrong in holding that since the Committee had\nnot been made a party to the proceedings this question could\nnot be gone into. The Government which was the appointing\nauthority was a party before the High Court. It was the\nduty of the State Government to place before the High Court\nall the materials available before it to enable the Court to\nconsider whether the grievance of the appellant was\njustified or not. The appellant's case must therefore be\nreconsidered in the light of the Rules. [932C-H]"

It was urged that the rules contained various\nprinciples for assessment of merit of an officer.\nRegarding the Circular dated August 27, 1966, the State\ncontended that the marking system laid down in the Circular\nfor assessment of merit of an officer was calculated to\nensure objectivity of approach on the part of the Selection\nCommittee. As there were as many as 35 sets of service\nrules governing various services, the Circular was issued to\nbring about uniformity in the procedure for assessment of\nmerit and for making selections on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit. The State claimed that it has ample powers to\nissue such a Circular. Regarding the validity of the\nCircular the State contended that the Circular dated August\n27, 1966 was issued by the Chief Secretary in his\nadministrative capacity being the Head of the Service in the\nState. It is within his competence to give guidance for the\nproper working of any governmental machinery. The circular\nis not intended to be a piece of legislation nor is it an\norder of the Government."

After considering the relevant portions\nof the Circular dated August 27, 1966, the learned Judge\nheld that the administrative instructions contained therein\nhad to be adopted and followed by these Committees. The\ndirections contained therein did not leave any choice to the\nCommittees to ignore the same. The administrative\ndirections contained in the said Circular, according to the\nlearned Judge, provided a rigid formula for being adopted in\nthe matter of selection for promotion and the directions\ncontained therein restricted the powers and functions of the\nCommittees functioning under the statutory rules. According\nto the learned Judge, even on merits, cannot be considered\nto be reasonable. In this view the circular was held to be\nbad as being repugnant to the rules. Regarding the\npromotions made under order dated January 4, 1967, the\nlearned Judge held that the directions contained in the\nCircular must have been taken into account by the Selection\nCommittee and hence the promotions were not valid. On this\nreasoning, the learned Judge, by his judgment and order\ndated November 7, 1968 held that sub-rule (1) of r. 28B and\nr. 32 were valid and that sub-rule (2) of r. 28B was\nviolative of \nArt. 16\n and hence that sub-rule was bad.

Regarding the Circular dated August 27,\n1966, the learned Judges held that the marking system\nindicated therein was really based upon the previous\nCircular dated August 31, 1960 under which merit was to be\nevaluated by allotting marks on the previous record of an\nofficer. The said Circular of 1960 had been in operation in\nrespect of the said services except the Rajasthan Judicial\nService or the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, which were\nunder the control of the High Court. It is the view of the\nDivision Bench that the Circular of 1966 was very elastic\nand gave wide discretion to the Committees to assess the\nmerit of an officer. The Circular has done nothing except\nto lay down broad guidelines for the excercise of discretion\nby the Promotion Committee. The system of marking indicated\nin the Circular was quite good as it brought about\nuniformity in the procedure for assessment of merit. On\nthis reasoning the learned Judges held that the Circular of\n1966 was valid and it was in no way repugnant to the rules.\nRegarding the authority for the Circular, the learned Judges\nnoted that there has been some confusion in the stand taken\nby the State from time to time even when they made\napplications for amending their counter-affidavit for making\nit clear that the Circular has been issued not by the Chief\nSecretary in his individual capacity but by the State\nGovernment. Ultimately, the Division Bench held that they\nhad examined the cabinet file produced before them along\nwith the note sheets and that the Court was satisfied that\nthe Circular of 1966, has been issued with the approval of\nthe State Government. The learned Judges rejected the plea\nof mala fides raised by the appellant herein. Regarding the\nallegation made by the appellant that the adverse remarks\nwhich had not been communicated to him had been taken into\naccount by the Promotion Committee in September, 1966, the\nlearned Judges held that as the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee had not been impleaded as a party, the question\nwhether the adverse remarks made against the appellant had\nbeen taken into account by the said Committee cannot be gone\ninto in these proceedings. Regarding the promotions made\nunder the Order dated January 14, 1967, the Division Bench\nupheld the same as it had already held that rules 28B and 32\nas well as the Circular of 1966 were all valid. Civil\nAppeal No. 1815 of 1970 is against the decision of the\nDivision Bench, reiterating the objections regarding the\nvalidity of the rules, the Circular, as well as the\npromotions made."

The\nlatter rule provides for two methods of selection: one based\non merit and the other based on seniority-cum-merit. In\nother words, the rule provides that the promotion based on\nmerit in contradistinction to that based on seniority-cum-\nmerit shall strictly be on the basis of merit. The\nSelection Committee and the Promotion Committee consist of\nvery responsible and senior officers of the 'State and being\npersons of experience they can be trusted to evaluate the\nmerits of a particular officer. No doubt the term 'merit'\nis not capable of an easy definition, but it can be safely\nsaid that merit is a sum total of various qualities and\nattributes of an employee such as his academic\nqualifications, his distinction in the University, his\nCharacter, integrity, devotion to duty and the manner in\nwhich he discharges his official duties. Allied to this may\nbe various other matters, or factors such as his punctuality\nin work, the quality and outturn of work done by him and the\nmanner of his dealings with his superiors and ,subordinate\nofficers and the general public and his rank in the service.\nWe are only indicating some of the broad aspects that may be\ntaken into account in assessing the merits of an officer.\nIn this connection it may be stated that the various\nparticulars in the annual confidential reports of an\nofficer, if carefully and properly noted, will also give a\nvery broad and general indication regarding the merit of an\nofficer. Therefore, it cannot be stated that rr. 28B and 32\nare in any manner vague ,or do not give any guide line for\nassessing the merit of an officer. No doubt sub-rule (2) of\nr. 27 dealt with certain factors which are to be taken into\naccount for considering the claims for promotion, but when\nit comes to a, question of merit, not only those factors but\nalso certain additional factors and circumstances will have\nto be taken into account and such an evaluation of merit has\nbeen left under the rules to a Committee consisting of res-\nponsible, senior and experienced officers of the State.\nWe are also not impressed with the contention that Rule\n28B(2) and its proviso confining the selection to senior-\nmost officers not exceeding ten times the number of total\nvacancies to be filled up and the further restriction\nregarding the eligibility of officers who have put in at\nleast six years of service for first promotion offend \nArt.\n16\n of the Constitution.

But the instructions given in the circular are so\nrigid that they are ,opposed to the selection to be made\nstrictly on merit as provided under rr. 28B and 32.-\nFor instance the marking system provides 50 marks for the\nrecord prior to 5 years and for the five years preceding the\nselection the marking of 25 is to be on the basis of\nconfidential rolls. From this it is clear that an officer\nwho has rendered less than five years of service will not\nbe eligible to get a single mark ,out of 50 which is\nprovided for the record for the period preceding five years\nfor the simple reason that he will have no such record. The\nofficer who has put in less than five years of service has\nbeen straightaway denied 50 marks out of 75 marks and he has\nto establish his worth within the small range of 25 marks on\nthe basis of his confidential rolls which will be available\nfor a period of less than five years. This formula of\nmarking is certainly opposed to r. 28B and r. 32, the object\nof which is to ensure that merit and merit alone is to form\nthe basis for promotion, as against the quota fixed for\nmerit, in contradistinction to seniority-cum-merit.\nSimilarly, when one considers the question of first\nselection, the position is still more anamolous. An officer\nWho has put in just six years of service will get 50 marks\nfor his record of previous service which just exceeds five\nyears by one year. Another officer will have to face the\nsituation with a longer period of service. There can be no\ncomparison of the claims of the two officers on merits.\nWhile the rules give a wide discretion to the Committee for\njudging merit, paragraphs 3 and 5 of the circular place\nundue, restrictions and limitations on the exercise of dis-\ncretion and thus fetter the powers of the Committee. That\nis opposed to rr. 28B and 32."

No doubt there is a\nmarking system indicated therein. But there are two\nfeatures which distinguish the circular of 1960 from that of\nthe 1966 circular. In paragraph 3 of the former circular,\nit is specifically laid down that the principles mentioned\ntherein are only in the nature of executive instructions to\nbe kept in view by the Committees when making promotions.\nIt is made clear that those Committees should, however,\nexercise their own discretion while applying the above\nprinciples in view of the fact that occasionally the\nConfidential Rolls may not have been written with full sense\nof responsibility. Moreover, some of the rules permit\ninterview before selection and in such cases the Selection\nCommittee will have to assess suitability of the officer as\na result of the interview also.\" Under the circular of 1966,\nwe have already indicated, no such discretion is left to the\nSelection or Promotion Committees to adopt any method other\nthan that indicated in the circular. In fact it is\nemphasised that the statutory service rules and the\ninstructions contained in the circular are to be treated as\na complete code by the Committees. Another point to be\nnoted is that in 1960 the question of promotion on the basis\nof merit alone had no place. That principle was adopted\nonly, as pointed out by us earlier, in1965 which led to\nthe amendment of the rules. Therefore, the principles\nmentioned in the circular of 1960 cannot be relied on when\nconsidering the validity of the present circular, when\npromotion by merit alone has been recognised by the rules\nfrom 1965. We have already indicated that the instructions\nin the 1966 circular contravene the Rules. Therefore, we\nare of the opinion that the circular dated 27-8-1966 is bad\nand accordingly it is struck down. We make it clear that we\nexpress no opinion on the validity or otherwise of the cir-\ncular of 31-8-1960.

They are' not entitled\nto any further reliefs in the writ petitions.\nIn the civil appeal Guman Singh, the appellant has raised a\ncontention that promotions of respondents Nos. 2 to 4 were\nmade on January 4, 1967 on the basis of illegal rules and\ninvalid circular. He has further contended that the\nPromotion Committee which met in September, 1966 has taken\ninto account the adverse remarks made against him which were\nnot justified and which were not communicated to him. We\nhave already expressed our views upholding the validity of\nthe rules and the invalidity of the circular. In support of\nthe contention that adverse remarks were taken into\nconsideration by the Committee, he relied upon the following\ncircumstances : The Deputy Commissioner has written a letter\ndated April 28, 1966 strongly appreciating his services as\nan officer. While so, it is a matter of surprise that\nadverse remarks came to be made in September, 1966. The\nnature of the adverse remarks has been referred to by the\nDivision Bench. It is admitted by the State that the\nPromotion Committee had met in the end of September, 1966\nand made recommendations regarding the officers who are to\nbe promoted. It is also admitted by the State Government\nthat the confidential rolls of all the officers were before\nthe Selection Committees They have not denied that the\ncircular was not taking into account by the Committee. On\nthe other hand, they have impliedly accepted that the\ncircular was before the Committee at the time of considering\nthe promotions. According to the appellant adverse remarks\nwere communicated to him only on May 11, 1967, long after\nthe decision of the Promotion Committee. Hence the\nCommittee has illegally taken into consideration the adverse\nremarks made against him and has denied him promotion on\nthat account. His contention is that after the adverse\nremarks were communicated to him, long, afterwards he made\nrepresentations and the adverse remarks were directed to be\nexpunged. In this connection, learned counsel relied upon\nthe counter-affidavit filed in this Court on behalf of the\nState in writ petition No. 76 of 1970 to the effect that the\nadverse entries in the confidential rolls of Shri Guman\nSingh, the appellant, were expunged on his representations.\nTherefore, according to the appellant, his claims for\npromotion have not been properly dealt. with by the\npromotion Committee."

This approach made by the learned Judges\ndoes not appeal to us. The Government, which is the\nappointing authority, was a party before the High Court. It\nmust have had before it, when it passed the orders on\nJanuary 4, 1967, all the records regarding promotion. It\nwas the duty of the State Government to place before the\nHigh Court all the materials available before it to enable\nthe Court to consider whether the grievance of the appellant\nwas justified or not. The appellant had made a specific\ngrievance in his writ petition about the uncommunicated\nadverse remarks having been taken into account by the\nCommittee. The Government could have obtained a report or\nan affidavit regarding the true facts from a responsible\nofficer of the Committee and placed it before the High\nCourt. Anyhow, as- mentioned earlier, it is not necessary\nfor us to pursue this aspect further except to point out\nthat we do not agree with the reasoning of the High Court in\nthis regard. The High Court has also declined to interfere\nwith the order dated January 4, 1967 as it upheld the\nvalidity of rr. 28B and 32 as well as the circular of August\n27, 1966. Though we are upholding the validity of the two\nrifles, we disagree from the High Court's view regarding the\nvalidity of the circular. We are also giving separate\ndirections regarding the order dated January 4, 1967.\nWe are, accordingly of the opinion that so far as the appel-\nlant (in the civil appeal) and respondents Nos. 2 to 4 are\nconcerned, the officiating promotions made of the latter\nofficers on January 4, 1967 as well as their confirmation by\norder dated January 22, 1970 will have to be reviewed and\nreconsidered by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the\nGovernment. It is needless to state that the circular dated\nAugust 27, 1966 should not be taken into consideration. The\nclaims of the appellant and respondents Nos. 2 to 4 in the\nappeal will have to be considered only on the basis of the\nRules. We also make it clear\nthat a reconsideration of the claims of the appellant and\nrespondents Nos. 2 to 4 will be necessary, only if the\nappellant, is found, in the first instance, to be eligible\nas per the Rules for being considered for promotion. His\neligibility is to be decided with reference to the date when\nthe Departmental promotion Committee met in September, 1966\nfor considering promotion. This direction becomes necessary\nas we are upholding the validity of Rules 28B and 32. If\nultimately, respondents Nos. 2 to 4 are found eligible for\npromotion under the rules, they will retain their rank on\nthe basis of promotion given to them on January 4, 1967. If\nnot, suitable alterations will have to be made both in this\norder as well as in the order of January 22, 1970. Once\nagain we are emphasising that the fact that the respondents\nNos. 2 to 4 have been confirmed on January 22, 1970, is of\nno consequence because if their original promotion on\nJanuary 4, 1967 is not valid, their confirmation on January\n22, 1970 will not have any greater sanctity. Of course, if\non reconsideration they are found eligible for promotion,\ntheir confirmation and rank given to them win stand.\nThe allegations of mala fides made by the appellant against\nthe State have been, in our opinion, rightly rejected by the\nDivision Bench. Mala fides were alleged against the State\nin amending the Service Rules from time to time and the\ndelay in making promotions on the ground that they were all\ndone with a view to help the son-in-law of the Chief\nMinister and the other officers who were relations of\npersons in the good books of the Chief Minister. The same\nallegations have been repeated in the two writ petitions\nalso. Those allegations have been denied by the State. For\nthe reasons given by the Division Bench, with which we\nagree, we have no hesitation in rejecting the allegations of\nmala fides made by the appellant in the appeal and in the\nwrit petitions."
