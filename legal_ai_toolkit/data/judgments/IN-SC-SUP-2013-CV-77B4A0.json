Leave granted in all the Special Leave Petitions.\n\n2. These appeals are directed against the common judgment\nand final order dated 8th December, 2010 passed by the\nHigh Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ Petition\nNos. 58206 of 2005 and in connected Writ Petition Nos.\n58214, 59016, 59018, 59035 and 59758 of 2005, whereby the\nHigh Court has allowed all the Writ Petitions and set\naside the Circular No. 17 of 2009 dated 30th\nNovember, 2009 and Circular dated 12th July, 2010 in so\nfar as they make a provision to exclude the employees\nfrom consideration for promotion, who are otherwise\neligible to be considered for promotion and are within\nthe zone of consideration, on the basis that they have\neither obtained the ‘D’ rating in the annual performance\nreport or have been penalized for any misconduct in the\npreceding 5 years.\n\nBackground:-\n\n3. Before we take up for consideration, the issues involved,\nit would be appropriate to briefly notice the background\nleading to the present litigation.\n\n4. There are currently about 82 Regional Rural Banks\n(for short “RRBs”) sponsored by various nationalized\nbanks, set up under the\nRegional Rural Banks Act, 1976\n\n(for short “the\nRRB Act, 1976\n”). There are about 67,000\nemployees of the Bank, spread all over India mostly in\nthe interiors.\n\n5. To ensure uniformity amongst all the RRBs,\nSection 29\n\nread with\nSection 17\nof the RRB Act, 1976 empowers the\nCentral Government to lay down the terms and conditions\nof service of employees of all the banks.\nSection 17\nof\nthe RRB Act, 1976 empowers the RRBs to appoint such\nnumber of officers and other employees as it may consider\nnecessary or desirable in such manner as may be\nprescribed for the efficient performance of its functions\nand to determine the terms and conditions of their\nappointment and service.\nSection 24\nof the Act lays down\nthat in the discharge of its functions, RRBs shall be\nguided by such directions in regard to matters of policy\ninvolving public interest and the Central Government may,\nafter consultation with the National Bank for Agriculture\nand Rural Development (for short “NABARD”), may\nprescribe. Under\nSection 29\nof this Act, the Central\nGovernment has been empowered to make rules after\nconsultation with the NABARD and the Sponsor Banks for\ncarrying of the provisions of the\nRRB Act, 1976\n. By\nClause (ba) of sub-section (2) of\nSection 29\n, which was\ninserted by the\nRegional Rural Banks (Amendment Act\n),\n1988, the Central Government was empowered to make rules\nrelating to the manner in which the officers and other\nemployees of the RRBs shall be appointed.\n\n6. Till the year 1988, there were no statutory rules\ngoverning the promotion of employees of RRBs and the same\nwere governed by various Circulars issued by the Central\nGovernment and NABARD. On 1st December, 1987, NABARD\nissued guidelines to all RRBs vide letter No. IDD.RRB.NO.\n\nC-78/316(GEN)/87-88, explaining the concept of\npromotion by “Seniority-cum-Merit” as envisaging\npromotion by seniority with due considerations to minimum\nmerit/fitness prescribed. Further, it was stipulated\nthat “this rule envisages promotion by seniority with due\nconsiderations to minimum merit/fitness prescribed.\nFitness implies that there is nothing against an officer;\nno disciplinary action is pending against him and none is\ncontemplated. The officer has neither been reprimanded\nnor any adverse remarks have been conveyed to him in the\nreasonable recent past”. Although the aforesaid Circular\nwas issued in relation to promotion of Managers to the\npost of Area/Sr. Manager, it was observed that the\nsimilar procedure may be followed in case of the\npromotion of Sr. Clerk and internal promotion to Field\nSupervisor and Manager Posts.\n\n7. The Central Government vide a Notification\ndated 28th September, 1988 framed statutory rules, known\nas Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of\nOfficers and other Employees) Rules, 1988 (for short “the\nRRB Rules, 1988). These rules were made in exercise of\nthe powers conferred on the Central Government by\nSection\nread with\nSection 17\nof the RRB Act, 1976 after\nconsultation with the NABARD and the Sponsor Banks\nspecified in the First Schedule of the Rules.\n\n8. Second Schedule of the aforesaid Rules laid down the\ncriteria for appointment to different categories of posts\nwhether by direct recruitment or by promotion in all the\nRRBs. The criterion for promotion on all the posts was\nspecified as seniority-cum-merit. With regard to the\npost of Area / Senior Manager, Clause 7 of Schedule 2\nprovided that the appointment on the aforesaid post shall\nbe made 100% by promotion from amongst confirmed officers\nworking in the Bank. Promotion will be on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit. If suitable officers are not\navailable internally, these posts are to be filled by\ndeputation in another banks or organization on\ndeputation.\n\n9. Clause 7(c) pertains to the mode of selection, which\nprovided for “interview and assessment of performance\nreports for the preceding 3 years period as officer for\npromotion”. It is relevant to note here that in these\nrules, the provisions pertaining to merit/fitness\ncontained in the NABARD Circular dated 1st December, 1987\nwere not incorporated. Even though, the 1988 Rules have\nbeen promulgated in consultation with NABARD and the\nSponsor Banks.\n\n10. In spite of the promulgation of the RRB Rules, 1988, the\nRRBs continued to make promotions by taking into\nconsideration the criteria laid down in the 1987 Circular\nin addition to the provisions contained in the RRB Rules,\n1988. This led to the actions of the RRBs being\nchallenged by way of Writ Petitions in Andhra Pradesh\nHigh Court and Madhya Pradesh High Court. Both the\nAndhra Pradesh as well as the Madhya Pradesh High Court\nheld that if seniority-cum-merit criterion is adopted for\nthe purposes of seniority, then the first senior most\neligible employee has to be tested to find out whether he\npossesses the minimum required merit for holding the\nhigher post and only if he is not found suitable or fit,\nhis immediate junior may be tested for the purpose of\npromotion. These decisions of the High Courts were\nchallenged by the various RRBs as well as the promoted\nofficers whose promotion has been set aside by this\nCourt.\n\n11. The controversy was laid at rest by this Court in\nthe judgment delivered in the case of\nB.V. Sivaiah & Ors.\nVs. K. Addanki Babu & Ors.\n[1] This Court distinguished the\nprinciple of “Merit-cum-Seniority” and the principle of\n“Seniority-cum-Merit”. It has been held that the principle\nof “Merit-cum-Seniority” lays greater emphasis on merit and\nseniority plays a less significant role. Seniority is to be\ngiven weight only when merit and seniority are approximately\nequal. As between two officers of “seniority-cum-merit”,\nthe criterion of seniority-cum-merit lays greater emphasis\non seniority. However, this Court added a caveat that an\nofficer can not claim promotion as a matter of right by\nvirtue of seniority alone and if he is found unfit in the\ndischarge of duties of the higher post, he may be passed\nover and the officer junior to him may be promoted. The\naforesaid judgment of this Court was delivered\non 17th July, 1998.\n\n12. Thereafter on 29th July, 1998, in exercise of the\npowers conferred by\nSection 29\nread with\nSection 17\nof RRB\nAct, 1976, in supersession of the RRB Rules, 1988, the\nCentral Government, after consultation with the National\nBank and Sponsor Bank specified in the Second Schedule,\npromulgated the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and\nPromotion of Officers and other Employees) Rules, 1998. The\nrelevant provision for appointment by promotion as a Scale\nII officer is as under:-\n\n“2.\n\n(a) Name of Post Scale II Officer\n(b) Classification Group ‘A’\n(C) Source of appointment 100 % by promotion\n(d) Whether promotion to be Promotion shall be made\nmade on seniority basis on the basis of\nseniority\nor seniority-cum-merit -cum-merit\nbasis.\n(e) Eligibility Officer holding post for eight years as\nan officer on regular basis\nin the Regional Rural Bank\nshall be considered for\npromotion to Scale-II post\nin that bank :\n\nProvided that no officer\nshall be considered for\npromotion unless he has been\nconfirmed in feeder grade\npost:\n\nProvided further that the\nBoard may, with the prior\napproval of National Bank\nrelax the qualifying service\nfor a period not exceeding\ntwo years, if eligible\nofficers are not available.\nNote:\n\n(I) The officers eligible for promotion to the post of Area\nManagers/Senior Managers/Officers Scale-II on or before\npublication of this notification, shall continue to be\nconsidered for promotion to Scale-II officer Post.\n\n(II) The service of the incumbents, who are holding the\npost eligible for promotion before publication of this\nnotification, shall continue to be counted for the purpose\nof promotion to the Scale II officer post.\n\n(f) Mode of Selection The selection of the candidates\nshall be made by the committee\non the basis of written test,\ninterview and assessment of\nPerformance Appraisal Reports\nfor the preceding five years\nas an officer in Scale I/Field\nSupervisor.\n\n(g) Composition of Committee The committee (for considering\npromotion) shall consist of\nthe following persons, namely,\n\ni) The chairman of the\nconcerned Regional Rural Bank-\n\nChairman\n\n(ii) A director nominated the\nsponsor bank-Member.\n\n(iii) A director nominated by\nthe National Bank Member.\n\nNote: If none of the members of the Committee belongs to Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes, the Board may nominate a person belonging\nto Schedule Castes or Schedule Tribe as an additional member and\nsuch person shall participate in the process of selection by the\nconcerned committee.\n\n(h) Reckoning of the The minimum eligibility in\nminimum eligibility terms of the number of\nyears of service for promotion\nshall be reckoned as on the 1st\nApril of the year in which the\nvacancy is expected to arise or\nhas actually arisen.\n\n(i) Number of candidates The number of candidates\nto be\nTo be considered for considered for\npromotion from\nPromotion officer Scale I to\nofficer Scale II shall be\nrestricted to four times the\nnumber of vacancies available\nfor promotion.\n\n(j) Selection process for The Selection shall be on the\nPromotion basis of performance\nin the written test,\ninterview and perforlmance\nappraisal reports for\npreceding five years as per\nthe division of marks given\nbelow.\n\n(A) Written Test 60 Marks\n(B) Interview 20 Marks\n(C) Performance 20 Marks\nAppraisal Reports\n\nTOTAL MARKS 100 MARKS\n(A) Written test (60 marks) The candidates shall be\nrequired to appear for\nwritten test comprising of\ntwo parts viz. part (A)\ncovering Banking Law and\nPractice of Banking and Part\n(B) covering Credit Policy\nCredit Management including\npriority Sector, Economics\nand Management.\n\n60 marks allotted to written\ntest shall be further divided\nas under :\n\nPart ”A” 30 Marks\nPart “B” 30 Marks\nA list of only those\ncandidates, who secure a\nminimum of 40% marks in each\npart shall be prepared and\nsuch candidates shall be\ncalled for interview. “\n\n13. The Rules also provide that the written test shall be\nin two parts viz. Part A and Part B, each consisting of 30\nmarks. It was provided that the list of those candidates\nshall be prepared, who secure a minimum of 40% marks in\neach part and such candidates shall be called for\ninterview. Thus the Rules had clearly introduced the\nminimum necessary merit as\nlaid down by\nthis court in the\ncase of\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra). However, it appears that one\nof the Sponsor Banks, namely Punjab National Bank issued\nguidelines dated 27th February, 1999 laying down the\n“procedure to be adopted in RRBs for promotion in different\ncadres – clarification thereof”, to all its Sponsored\nRegional Rural Banks.\n\nPresent Litigation:\n\n14. Thereafter, the individual officers of erstwhile RRBs\nfiled 13 Writ Petitions before the High Court in the year\n2004-2005 on the ground that the Circular sought to debar\ntotally from consideration for promotion, officers against\nwhom disciplinary action was pending or contemplated as\nwell as those, who had been reprimanded or had obtained a\n‘D’ rating in their annual performance reports in the\npreceding 5 years before the selection process commences.\n\n15. Whilst the aforesaid matters were still pending, it\nappears that the Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda\nissued another clarification by the Circular No. 17 of 2009\ndated 30th November, 2009. The aforesaid circular entitled\n“Appointment and Promotion of Officers and other Employees\nof RRBs” reiterated the provision contained in the\nNotification dated 29th July, 1998. Pursuant to the\naforesaid, Sarva U.P. Gramin Bank issued a Circular dated\n12th July, 2010 incorporating the clarification contained\nin the Circular dated 12th July, 2010, subsequently\nreiterated on 30th November, 2009. The aforesaid Circulars\nwere also challenged in Writ Petition Nos. 55913, 50638,\n50629, 51003 and 50633 of 2010.\n\n16. All the aforesaid writ petitions were clubbed and\ndecided by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad by a\ncommon judgment dated 8th December, 2010. By the\naforesaid judgment, the High Court quashed the Circular\nNo. 17 of 2009 dated 30th November, 2009 and Circular\ndated 12th July, 2010. The appellant bank was directed to\nconsider the claim of the respondents (Writ Petitioners)\nfor promotion in accordance with the procedure and method\nof punishment provided by the competent authority for\nselections. The High Court in its judgment concluded :-\n\n“1. Where a person is eligible to be considered for\npromotion, his exclusion, on the ground that he has\nsuffered minor or major penalties, cannot be a ground to\nexclude him from consideration. The competent authority, as\nheld in\nK.V. Janakiram\n(supra) and\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra),\ncan lay down minimum standards required and also prescribe\nmode of assessment of merit of the employees eligible to be\nconsidered for promotion. The assessment can be made by\nassigning marks on the basis of appraisal of performance on\nthe service record and interview. The competent authority\nmay also prescribe minimum marks which would entitle a\nperson to be promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\nThe employee, however, cannot be excluded and denied his\nright to be considered by the selection committee for\npromotion.\n\n2. The persons, who have been awarded censure entry or\nother minor punishments, thus cannot be excluded from the\nzone of consideration for promotion. The question of\nassessment on merit is to be made by the Selection\nCommittee at the time of selection and not before that by\neliminating the person who is within the zone of\nconsideration.\n\n3. We are further of the opinion that the circulars issued\nby the bank cannot override the statutory Rules nor can\nsupplement it to the extent that the persons, who are\notherwise eligible to be considered for promotion, will be\nrendered ineligible and will not be given a chance to be\nconsidered for promotion.”\n\n17. Aggrieved by the aforesaid observations and the\ndecision of the High Court, the appellant bank has filed\nthe present appeals.\n\nSUBMISSIONS :\n\n18. We have heard very lengthy submissions by the learned\ncounsel for the parties.\n\n19. We may first briefly notice the submissions on behalf\nof the appellants. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned senior counsel\nappearing for the appellants submitted that the Circular\ndated 30th November, 2009 and 12th July, 2010 were not\nultra vires of the RRB Rules, 1998. The two Circulars have\nonly supplemented the RRB Rules, 1998, where they are\nsilent. The Circulars do not have the effect of\nsupplanting the RRB Rules, 1998. He elaborated that the\naforesaid Rules do not provide for and/or are silent with\nregard to the treatment to be given /meted out to the case\nwhere “adverse remarks” have been recorded against an\nofficer during the preceding 5 years, i.e., period under\nconsideration for promotion. He submitted that the Sponsor\nBanks have merely reiterated the earlier Circular issued by\nthe NABARD on 1st December, 1987, which was subsequently\nclarified on 27th February, 1999.\nThe Circulars dated 30th\nApril, 2009 and 12th July, 2010 have merely reiterated the\nearlier position. The appellant bank had only reiterated\nthe aforesaid guidelines after the amalgamation of the\nsmall RRBs into one RRB (appellant bank) vide Notification\ndated 30th November, 2007. However, these guidelines were\nbeing followed by erstwhile RRBs also prior to\namalgamation. Learned senior counsel relied on the\njudgment in the case of\nSant Ram Sharma Vs. State of\nRajasthan & Ors.\n[2] to submit that it was permissible for\nthe appellant bank to fill up the gaps and supplement the\nrules and issue instructions which were not inconsistent\nwith the statutory rules. Learned senior counsel further\nsubmitted that the aforesaid Circulars have been issued in\norder to bring about uniformity as different RRBs were\nfollowing different procedures for making promotions on\nsimilar posts. Since the Rules of 1998 are silent with\nregard to non-consideration of officers, who have adverse\nremarks against them in the preceding 5 years, it was\nnecessary to lay down uniform guidelines.\nHe emphasised\nthat DPC under the RRB Rules, 1998 consists of :- (a)\nChairman, RRB, (b) Director nominated by Sponsor Banks and\n\n(c) Director nominated by NABARD. In the absence of\nuniform guidelines, DPC consisting of individuals will be\nconferred with power to decide whether an individual\nofficer despite having been punished in the preceding 5\nyears should be recommended/selected for promotion or not.\nAccording to Mr. Dhruv Mehta, introduction of such a\nprocess will lead to infusion of arbitrariness in the\nprocess of promotion. In such circumstances, the promotion\nof a particular officer, in spite of having been punished,\nwill be based entirely on the perception of individual\nmembers of DPC. This could lead to more litigation by the\nofficers, who are not selected/approved for promotion in\nspite of having a clean record. He points out that without\nthe aforesaid guidelines, an officer, even though, he has\nbeen punished for gross misconduct, would have to be\npromoted in case he obtains minimum 40% marks in the\nwritten test, because in other parameters, namely interview\nand performance appraisal, the RRB Rules, 1998 do not\nprescribe minimum marks. Debarring such a person from\npromotion would not be arbitrary as the rationale behind\nsuch procedure is to weed out the unfit at the initial\nstage.\nIn support of this submission, the learned senior\ncounsel relied on the observations made by this Court in\nthe case of\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava & Ors. Vs. Samyut\nKshetriya Gramin Bank & Ors.\n[3] The instructions,\naccording to him, merely prescribe minimum merit necessary\nfor discharging the function of the higher post.\nTherefore, the procedure prescribed in the Circulars would\nnot violate the concept of promotion by seniority-cum-\nmerit. Learned senior counsel further submitted that same\nprocedure will be followed in cases, where an officer has\nbeen communicated adverse remarks and graded as ‘D’ in the\n5 years preceding the selection process.\n\nIn support of\nthis submission, the learned counsel relied on certain\nobservations made by this Court in\nCivil Appeal No. 6072 of\n2012, Ram Ashish Dixit Vs. Chairman, Purvanchal Gramin Bank\n& Ors\n.\n\n20. The next submission of Mr. Dhruv Mehta was that the\nemployee only has a right to be considered for promotion\nand does not have an absolute right to be promoted only on\nthe basis of seniority. Learned senior counsel reiterated\nthat criteria of “fitness”, i.e., a candidate should not be\nfound to be “unfit to discharge the duties of higher post”\nis a condition implicit in the criteria of promotion on the\nbasis of “seniority-cum-fitness” criteria.\n\n21. Learned senior counsel has further submitted that\ndifferent rules prescribed different criterias for\nadjusting the suitability of candidates for promotion viz.\n“seniority-cum-fitness”, “seniority-cum-merit” and “merit-\ncum-seniority”. However, the “fitness” of a candidate to\ndischarge duties of higher post, has to be considered\nnecessary, relevant and an implicit condition of promotions\nin all the above criterias. He draws support for the\naforesaid submission from the judgment of this Court in the\ncase of\nState of Mysore & Anr. Vs. Syed Mahmood & Ors.\n[4]\nand\nHaryana State Warehousing Corporation & Ors. Vs. Jagat\nRam & Anr.\n[5]\n\n22. Mr. Dhruv Mehta then submitted that the\nemployee/officers, who have not been promoted in view of\nthe guidelines dated 30th November, 2009 and 12th July,\n2010, had not been debarred from consideration as they\nwere, in fact, considered along with all the other\nofficers, who had completed the requisite period of service\nbut have been weeded out/eliminated at the threshold, in\nview of the fact that they had been either punished or\ngraded ‘D’ in the 5 years preceding the selection. Learned\nsenior counsel further submitted that non-promotion of\nthose officers, who have either been punished or have been\nrecipient of adverse remarks such as Grade ‘D’, would not\nbe violative of\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. The candidates, who have been imposed\npenalty/punishment or whose performance is assessed as\nunsatisfactory during the period under consideration for\npromotion can not be placed at par with the candidates, who\nhave not been imposed any punishment/penalty or whose\nperformance has been outstanding, very good or good during\nthe said period. The classification made on the basis of\nthe service record is a reasonable classification and has a\nnexus with the object sought to be achieved namely\npromotion to the next grade/cadre.\nIn support of this, he\nrelies on the judgment of this Court in the case of\nUnion\nof India & Ors. Vs. K.V. Jankiraman & Ors.\n[6]\n\n23. Mr. Dhruv Mehta has also brought to the attention of\nthis court the “subject wise bifurcation” of the present\nspecial leave petitions, which appears to have been\npremised on the basis of different levels of punishment\nimposed on the writ appellants/respondents herein which\nrendered them ineligible from consideration for promotion.\nThe bifurcation is as under :\n\ni) SLP (C) No. 9284-9301/2011: The concerned employees in\nthis bunch were rendered ineligible for consideration\nfor promotion due to imposition of punishment on them\nduring the preceding five years.\n\nii) SLP (C) No. 9181-86/2011: The assessment of the\nconcerned employees in this bunch was rendered\n“unsatisfactory”, i.e., they were rated “D” in any one\nyear out of preceding five years.\n\niii) SLP (C) No. 9432-9444/2011: Some punishment was imposed\non the employees herein during the preceding five years\nand also, their performance was rated as unsatisfactory,\ni.e., they were rated “D”.\n\niv) SLP (C) 9306-9309/2011: Issues raised by the writ\npetitioners herein were not same/similar to the lead\nmatter therein.\n\n24. Lastly, he submits that this Court in a catena of\njudgments has held that an employee can be validly debarred\nfrom consideration for promotion during the rigour of\npunishment. He has made a reference to the following\njudgments:-\n\nState of T.N. Vs. Thiru K.S. Murugesan & Ors.\n[7],\nL.\nRajaiah Vs. Inspector General of Registration &\nStamps, Hyderabad & Ors.\n[8] and Collector of\nThanjavur Distt.\n\n&\nOrs. Vs. S. Rajagopalan & Ors.\n[9]\n\n25. On the other hand, learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent, Mr. Fakhruddin, submitted that the submissions\nmade by the appellants about the usurpation of the power of\nselection of the management by the members of the DPC\nclearly indicates that the two Circulars have not been\nissued bonafide and are in fact intended to whittle down\nthe role and powers of Independent Selection Committee\nprescribed in the statutory rules of 1998. The function of\nselection has been statutorily conferred on the DPC, and\ncan not be permitted to be usurped by the Bank Management.\nHe further submitted that by virtue of\nSection 29\nand\n\nSection 17\nof the RRB Act, 1976, the powers to determine\nthe service conditions including promotions of the\nemployees of the RRBs are vested in the Central Government.\nTherefore, the two Circulars can not be permitted to\nprevail over the provision of the statutory rules of 1998.\nMr. Fakhruddin emphasised that Government of India has\npromulgated the aforesaid rules in consultation with NABARD\nand the Sponsor Bank. Even then, no provision has been\nmade in the aforesaid rules to debar the employees/officers\nfor being considered for promotion amongst them who fall in\nthe zone of consideration, on the basis that they have been\neither penalized or given an unsatisfactory/’D’ rating\nannual performance appraisal report. It is submitted by\nall the learned counsel appearing for the respondent that\nthe RRB Rules, 1998 are in consonance with the observations\nmade by this Court in the case of\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra) and\nis a complete code, which does not need to be supplemented\nby any instructions. It is further submitted that in the\nguise of laying down minimum marks as a benchmark to\ndetermine the suitability/fitness/merit for promotion, the\nappellants have introduced the criteria of merit-cum-\nseniority in the place of seniority-cum-merit. Such change\nin the criteria could only be made by making the necessary\namendment in the Rules and not by issuing\nguidelines/Circulars by the Sponsor Banks or NABARD.\n\n26. Learned senior counsel further submitted that the two\nCirculars are wholly arbitrary since even the employees who\nhad been only given the lowest penalty of censure or\nreprimand can be eliminated at the threshold, from being\nconsidered for promotion. It is further submitted by the\nlearned counsel for the respondent that blanket debarment\nwill have the effect of giving an unbridled/untrampled\npower in the hands of the superiors of an employee. Such\npower can be abused and misused to give/deny “promotion to\na particular employee/officer due to personal reasons and\nlikes and dislikes of a particular officer”. Learned\nsenior counsel, therefore, submitted that the High Court\nhas correctly quashed the aforesaid two Circulars.\n\nCONSIDERATION/CONCLUSIONS :\n\n27. We have given due consideration to the submissions\nmade by the learned counsel for the parties. It is by now\nsettled beyond cavil that statutory rules can be\nsupplemented but can not be supplanted. This is the ratio\nof law\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nSant Ram Sharma\n(supra).\nIt has been reiterated by this Court in a catena of\nsubsequent judgments. It is, however, not necessary to\nburden the present judgment by making a copious reference\nto the other decisions which merely reiterated the same\nratio.\n\n28. We have noticed earlier that till 1988, there were no\nstatutory rules governing the promotions of the employees\nof RRB. The promotions in these banks were governed by\nvarious Circulars issued by the Government, NABARD and the\nSponsor Banks. One such Circular is\ndated 1st December, 1987, which provided that the word\n“merit”, provides that criteria of seniority-cum-merit\nenvisages promotion by seniority with due consideration to\nminimum merit/fitness prescribed. However, the Circular\nfurther provided that fitness implies that there is nothing\nagainst an officer, no disciplinary action is pending\nagainst him and none is contemplated. The officer has\nneither been reprimanded nor any adverse remarks have been\nconveyed to him in the reasonable recent past.\n\n29. The aforesaid Circular is prior in time to the RRB\nRules, 1988. The aforesaid rules clearly provided that\npromotion shall be made by following the criteria of\nseniority-cum-merit. Rule also provides that any\nofficer/employee having 8 years of service as an\nofficer/employee shall be eligible to be considered for\npromotion. The criteria for determining the minimum merit\nrequired of the candidate for promotion is to be\nascertained on the basis of his performance in the written\ntest, interview and his assessment in the performance\nappraisal report. There is no provision in the Rules that\nan employee/officer, who has been punished in the 5 years\npreceding the selection process or has been given an\nadverse remark or graded ‘D’ shall not be considered for\npromotion at all. The Circular dated 1st December, 1987\nwas, therefore, clearly contrary to the 1988 statutory\nrules, and, therefore, ceased to have any legal effect from\nthe date of the enforcement of the rules.\n\n30. It is a matter of record that the RRB Rules, 1988\nwere superseded by the RRB Rules, 1998. The aforesaid\nrules incorporated the principle of minimum merit as\nenunciated by this Court in\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra). In\nParagraph 18 of the aforesaid judgment, this Court observed\nas follows:-\n\n“18. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n“seniority-cum-merit” in the matter of promotion postulates\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\nefficiency of administration, the senior, even though less\nmeritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made. For\nassessing the minimum necessary merit, the competent\nauthority can lay down the minimum standard that is\nrequired and also prescribe the mode of assessment of merit\nof the employee who is eligible for consideration for\npromotion. Such assessment can be made by assigning marks\non the basis of appraisal of performance on the basis of\nservice record and interview and prescribing the minimum\nmarks which would entitle a person to be promoted on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit.”\n\n31. Following the aforesaid observations, the RRB Rules,\n1998 have introduced a detailed procedure for determining\nthe minimum merit for promotion to the next higher\npost/grade. The RRB Rules, 1998 clearly provided that\nofficers holding post in 8 years as an officer on regular\nbasis in the RRB shall be considered for promotion to the\nnext higher post. The aforesaid rule does not provide that\nany employee/officer, who has suffered a punishment or has\nreceived an adverse appraisal/Grade ‘D’ in the performance\nappraisal, shall not be eligible. However, the Circulars\ndated 30th November, 2009 and 12th July, 2010 enables the\nappellant banks to eliminate such employees, which is\nclearly contrary to the provisions contained in the\nstatutory service rules. The procedure prescribed under\nthe aforesaid two Circulars clearly has the effect of\nsupplanting the provision of eligibility, which is not\npermissible.\n\n32. Such an additional provision can not be justified on\nthe basis that it would form part of the minimum merit\nrequired to be considered for promotion.\nIn our opinion,\nthe reliance placed in support of this proposition on the\njudgment in the case of\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava\n(supra)\nis wholly misplaced. In the aforesaid judgment, this Court\nhas observed as follows:-\n\n“11. It is also well settled that the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit, for promotion, is different from the\nprinciple of “seniority” and the principle of “merit-cum-\nseniority”. Where promotion is on the basis of seniority\nalone, merit will not play any part at all. But where\npromotion is on the principle of seniority-cum-merit,\npromotion is not automatic with reference to seniority\nalone. Merit will also play a significant role. The\nstandard method of seniority-cum-merit is to subject all\nthe eligible candidates in the feeder grade (possessing the\nprescribed educational qualification and period of service)\nto a process of assessment of a specified minimum necessary\nmerit and then promote the candidates who are found to\npossess the minimum necessary merit strictly in the order\nof seniority. The minimum merit necessary for the post may\nbe assessed either by subjecting the candidates to a\nwritten examination or an interview or by assessment of\ntheir work performance during the previous years, or by a\ncombination of either two or all the three of the aforesaid\nmethods. There is no hard-and-fast rule as to how the\nminimum merit is to be ascertained. So long as the ultimate\npromotions are based on seniority, any process for\nascertaining the minimum necessary merit, as a basic\nrequirement, will not militate against the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit”\n\n33. These observations clearly apply at the time when the\neligible persons are being considered for promotion by the\nDPC. Eligibility under the rules is on the basis of minimum\nlength of service – eight years, unless relaxed by two\nyears confirmation in the lower/feeder post. It is not\npossible to accept the submission of Mr. Dhruv Mehta that\nbare minimum merit can be determined even before the list\nof candidates is placed before the DPC for consideration of\ntheir merit. Rule (2e) clearly provides firstly for the\ndetermination of the eligibility, as noticed above. The\ncriteria for promotion (seniority-cum-merit) is provided in\nRule 2(d). Rule 2(f) provides for “mode of selection”. It\nis clearly provided that “the selection of the candidates\nshall be made by the committee…………”. The second part of\nRule 2(f) provides the criteria for determination of the\nbare minimum merit. In fact, for this very reason, the\nrules themselves provide that in order to succeed in the\nwritten test, a candidate has to secure a minimum 40% marks\nin each part of the written test consisting of 30 marks\neach. It is only when all the candidates within the zone of\nconsideration have participated in the selection procedure\nand their performance is assessed on the basis of written\ntest, interview, and past performance i.e. performance\nappraisal that the minimum merit would become relevant.\nWhen the bare minimum merit of the candidates is\ndetermined, the promotion shall be made on the basis of\nseniority irrespective of the better performance of the\njunior candidates in the written test/interview/performance\nappraisal.\n\n34. Similarly, the reliance placed by Mr. Dhruv Mehta on\nthe judgment of this Court in K.V. Jankiraman’s case\n(supra) is also misplaced. In this judgment, this Court\nconsidered the circumstances under which the banks could\nresort to the “sealed cover procedure”, when considering\nthe claims of the eligible candidates for promotion. The\ncourt also examined the impact of departmental punishment\nfor assessment of the suitability of an employee for\npromotion. The relevant ratio of this Court is as under :\n\n“29. According to us, the Tribunal has erred in holding\nthat when an officer is found guilty in the discharge of\nhis duties, an imposition of penalty is all that is\nnecessary to improve his conduct and to enforce discipline\nand ensure purity in the administration. In the first\ninstance, the penalty short of dismissal will vary from\nreduction in rank to censure. We are sure that the Tribunal\nhas not intended that the promotion should be given to the\nofficer from the original date even when the penalty\nimparted is of reduction in rank. On principle, for the\nsame reasons, the officer cannot be rewarded by promotion\nas a matter of course even if the penalty is other than\nthat of the reduction in rank. An employee has no right to\npromotion. He has only a right to be considered for\npromotion. The promotion to a post and more so, to a\nselection post, depends upon several circumstances. To\nqualify for promotion, the least that is expected of an\nemployee is to have an unblemished record. That is the\nminimum expected to ensure a clean and efficient\nadministration and to protect the public interests. An\nemployee found guilty of a misconduct cannot be placed on\npar with the other employees and his case has to be treated\ndifferently. There is, therefore, no discrimination when in\nthe matter of promotion, he is treated differently. The\nleast that is expected of any administration is that it\ndoes not reward an employee with promotion retrospectively\nfrom a date when for his conduct before that date he is\npenalised in praesenti. When an employee is held guilty and\npenalised and is, therefore, not promoted at least till the\ndate on which he is penalised, he cannot be said to have\nbeen subjected to a further penalty on that account. A\ndenial of promotion in such circumstances is not a penalty\nbut a necessary consequence of his conduct. In fact, while\nconsidering an employee for promotion his whole record has\nto be taken into consideration and if a promotion committee\ntakes the penalties imposed upon the employee into\nconsideration and denies him the promotion, such denial is\nnot illegal and unjustified. If, further, the promoting\nauthority can take into consideration the penalty or\npenalties awarded to an employee in the past while\nconsidering his promotion and deny him promotion on that\nground, it will be irrational to hold that it cannot take\nthe penalty into consideration when it is imposed at a\nlater date because of the pendency of the proceedings,\nalthough it is for conduct prior to the date the authority\nconsiders the promotion. For these reasons, we are of the\nview that the Tribunal is not right in striking down the\nsaid portion of the second sub-paragraph after clause (iii)\nof paragraph 3 of the said Memorandum. We, therefore, set\naside the said findings of the Tribunal.”\n\nThese observations make it abundantly clear that\npromotion can be justifiably denied to eligible candidate at\nthe time of his/her performance appraisal by the DPC. The\nfact that the officer/employee has been departmentally\npunished would form part of the service record and can be\ntaken into account by the DPC. In such circumstances, the\nemployee cannot possibly claim to have been subjected to a\nfurther penalty on the basis of the misconduct which led to\nhis punishment. This, however, would not permit the\nmanagement to debar an employee from being considered for\npromotion at the stage of considering whether such an\nemployee is “eligible” to be considered in terms of Rule\n2(e).\n\n35. The observations in\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava\n(supra)\nalso do not support the submissions made by Mr.\nDhruv Mehta. In paragraph 13, it is observed as follows :\n\n“13. Thus it is clear that a process whereby eligible\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary merit in the\nfeeder posts is first ascertained and thereafter,\npromotions are made strictly in accordance with seniority,\nfrom among those who possess the minimum necessary merit is\nrecognised and accepted as complying with the principle of\n“seniority-cum-merit”. What would offend the rule of\nseniority-cum-merit is a process where after assessing the\nminimum necessary merit, promotions are made on the basis\nof merit (instead of seniority) from among the candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit. If the criteria\nadopted for assessment of minimum necessary merit is bona\nfide and not unreasonable, it is not open to challenge, as\nbeing opposed to the principle of seniority-cum-merit. We\naccordingly hold that prescribing minimum qualifying marks\nto ascertain the minimum merit necessary for discharging\nthe functions of the higher post, is not violative of the\nconcept of promotion by seniority-cum-merit.”\n\nThese observations also make it clear that whilst\nassessing the eligibility of the candidates, determination\nof bare minimum merit is not envisaged. There is, in fact,\na complete segregation of Rule 2(e) from Rule 2(f).\nDetermining the eligibility of candidate is in the nature\nof a ministerial function. The management merely has to see\nthat the candidate possesses the minimum length of service\nand that he/she is confirmed in the feeder cadre. The\ndetermination of bare minimum merit is on the basis of the\nperformance in the written test/interview and performance\nappraisal. This is the function of the Selection Committee\ni.e. Departmental Promotion Committee.\n\n36. There is no doubt that punishment and adverse service\nrecord are relevant to determine the minimum merit by the\nDPC. But to debar a candidate, to be considered for\npromotion, on the basis of punishment or unsatisfactory\nrecord would require the necessary provision in the\nstatutory service Rules. There is no such provision under\nthe 1998 Rules.\n\n37.\nIn\nB.V.Sivaiah\n(supra), this Court laid down the broad\ncontours defining the term “bare minimum merit” in the\nfollowing words :\n\n“We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n‘seniority-cum-merit’ in the matter of promotion postulates\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\nefficiency of administration, the senior, even though less\nmeritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made. For\nassessing the minimum necessary merit, the competent\nauthority can lay down the minimum standard that is\nrequired and also prescribe the mode of assessment of merit\nof the employee who is eligible for consideration for\npromotion. Such assessment can be made by assigning marks\non the basis of appraisal of performance on the basis of\nservice record and interview and prescribing the minimum\nmarks which would entitle a person to be promoted on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit.”\n\nFrom the above, it becomes clear that the\ndetermination of the bare minimum criteria is the function\nof the DPC and cannot be taken-over by the management at\nthe time of determining the eligibility of a candidate\nunder Rule 2(e).\n\n38. The reliance placed by Mr. Dhruv Mehta on the\njudgment of this court in the case of\nRam Ashish Dixit\n\n(supra) is also misconceived. In the aforesaid case, the\nofficer had been considered for promotion during the\npendency of the departmental proceedings to Middle\nManagement Grade II. However, the result was kept in a\nsealed cover. After finalization of the proceedings, the\nappellants requested the authority to open the sealed\ncover. He was, however, informed that he can not be\npromoted in view of the bank Circular dated 28th March,\n1998 as he had been punished. Subsequently, again his case\nwas to be considered for promotion in September, 1999.\nHowever, he was denied consideration for promotion in view\nof the conditions contained in Circular dated 28th March,\n1998. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that\nthe punishment imposed upon the staff of the Bank can not\nbe treated to be an ineligibility for promotion since the\neligibility for promotion is prescribed under the RRB\nRules, 1988. It was submitted on behalf of the bank\n(respondent therein) that since stoppage of increment for 3\nyears is a punishment imposed upon the appellants, during\nthe period, he would be undergoing punishment, he could not\nhave been considered to be eligible for promotion.\nTherefore, according to the bank, respondent had been\nrightly held to be ineligible under Circular dated 28th\nMarch, 1998. It was also claimed by the bank that the\nCircular is supplementary in nature and can not be said to\nbe in any manner inconsistent and ultra vires of the rules.\nIn answering the rival submissions, this Court held as\nunder:-\n\n“The criteria for promotion from Junior Manager Grade-I to\nMiddle Management Grade-II is on the basis of the seniority-\ncum-merit. Clearly therefore, the fact that the appellant\nhas been punished for a misconduct, the same would form a\npart of his record of service which would be taken into\nconsideration while adjudging his suitability on the\ncriteria of seniority-cum-merit. If on such assessment of\nhis record of service the appellant is not promoted, it\ncannot be said to be by way of punishment. It is a non-\npromotion on account of the appellant not reaching a\nsuitable standard to be promoted on the basis of the\ncriteria.”\n\n39. We also do not find any merit in the submission of\nMr. Dhruv Mehta that the Circular No.17 of 2009\ndated 30th November, 2009 and Circular dated 12th\nJuly, 2010 are to ensure that the individual members of the\nDPC do not recommend for promotion an individual officer\ndespite having been punished in the preceding 5 years. Such\ncurtailment of the power of the DPC would have to be\nlocated in the statutory service rules. The 1998 Rules do\nnot contain any such provision. The submission needs merely\nto be stated, to be rejected. We also do not find any merit\nin the submission of Mr. Mehta that without the aforesaid\nguidelines, an officer, even though, he has been punished\nfor gross misconduct would have to be permitted to be\npromoted as no minimum marks are prescribed for interview\nor performance appraisal. In our opinion, it is fallacious\nto presume that under the 1998 Rules, once an officer gets\nthe minimum marks in the written examination, he would be\nentitled to be promoted on the basis of seniority alone.\nThere is no warrant for such a presumption. The misconduct\ncommitted by eligible employee/officer would be a matter\nfor DPC to take into consideration at the time of\nperformance appraisal. The past conduct of an employee can\nalways be taken into consideration in adjudging the\nsuitability of the officer for performing the duties of the\nhigher post.\n\n40. There is another very good reason for not accepting\nthe submissions made by Mr. Dhruv Mehta. Different\nrules/regulations of the banks provide specific punishments\nsuch as “withholding of promotion, reduction in rank,\nlowering in ranks/pay scales”. However, there is another\nrange of penalty such as censure, reprimand, withholding of\nincrements etc. which are also prescribed under various\nstaff regulations. To debar such an employee from being\nconsidered for promotion would tantamount to also\ninflicting on such employee, the punishment of withholding\nof promotion. In such circumstances, a punishment of\ncensure/ reprimand would, in fact, read as\ncensure/reprimand + 5 years debarment from promotion. Thus\nthe circulars issued by the bank debarring such employees\nfrom being considered would be clearly contrary to the\nstatutory rules. The circulars clearly do not fall within\nthe ratio in Sant Ram’s case (supra).\n\n41.\nIn our opinion, the observations made by this Court\nin the case of\nRam Ashish Dixit\n(supra) are a complete\nanswer to the submissions made by the learned counsel for\nthe appellants, Mr. Dhruv Mehta. Therefore the High Court,\nin our opinion, has rightly quashed the aforesaid two\nCirculars and directed that the respondent be considered\nfor promotion in accordance with the applicable rules.\n\n42. We, therefore find no merit in the civil appeals\nfiled by the appellant-bank, and are accordingly dismissed.\nNo costs.\n\n……..….…………………J.\n[Surinder Singh\nNijjar]\n\n………………………….J.\n[H.L.
