RAMACHANDRA RAO, J.\n\nIn this batch of LPAs and Writ Petitions, common questions of\n\nlaw arise and so they are being disposed off by this common order.\n\nA brief overview of the facts\n\nThe respondents in the LPAs (except LPA-558-2019), the\n\nappellants in LPA-558-2019 and the petitioners in the Writ Petitions are\n\nland owners whose lands had been acquired under the\nNational Highway Act,\nby the National Highway Authority of India (for short 'the NHAI') for\n\nthe purpose of widening/four-laning of certain National Highways.\n\nThereafter, matters were referred to the concerned District\n\nRevenue Officer-cum- Land Acquisition Officer (the Revenue Authority of the\n\nState) (hereinafter referred to as the 'competent authority') and he passed\n\nawards and awarded compensation, but while doing so, he did not grant\n\nbenefits akin to those under Section 23, Section 28 and\nSection 34\nof the Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894.\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 6 of 45\n\nWrit Petitions were filed in this Court challenging the award of\n\nthe competent authority by landowners without approaching the arbitrator\n\nunder\nsection 3G (5)\nof the National Highway Act, 1956.\n\nThey were partly allowed by a learned Single Judge of this Court\n\nwhich judgments are challenged by the NHAI in the Letters Patent Appeals\n\nbeing LPAs-4965-2018, 428-2019, 475-2019, 224-2019, 4968-2018, 280-\n\n2019, 52-2019.\n\nIn LPA-324-2019, the landowners did approach the Arbitrator and\n\nhe passed an award under\nsection 3G(5)\n, but the said award was not challenged\n\nby them under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\nInstead the land owners filed Writ Petition in this Court which was allowed by\n\nthe learned Single Judge. The said order is challenged by the NHAI in the said\n\nLPA.\n\nIn LPA-558-2019, the landowners had filed a writ petition\n\nchallenging the arbitral award passed on 04.05.2016 by the arbitrator\n\nconfirming the order dt.30.04.2012 passed by the competent authority, but the\n\nsame was dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground that they have a\n\nremedy to challenge the same under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996. This judgment is challenged by them in the said LPA.\n\nIn CWP-18775-2019, CWP-25229-2019, CWP-14487-2019 and\n\nCWP-18799-2019, the landowners had not approached the statutory Arbitrator\n\nfor enhancement of compensation granted by the competent authority under\n\nthe National highways Act,1956 and had straight away approached this Court\n\nseeking the benefits akin to those granted under\nSection 23\nand\nof the Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894.\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 7 of 45\n\nContentions of the land owners\n\nThe landowners place reliance on the judgment of the Division\n\nBench of this Court in M/s\nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings vs. Union of\n\nIndia and Ors.1\n\nIn\nM/s\nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n(1 supra), a Division\n\nBench of this Court held that in acquisitions of land under the\nNational\n\nHighway Act, 1956\n, solatium and interest in terms of Section 23(2) and\n\nSection 28\nof the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 should be granted to landowners\n\nand Section 3-J and Section 3-G of the said Act, which did not provide for\n\npayment of solatium and interest and other statutory benefits similar to the\n\nprovisions contained in\nsection 23\n(1-A),\nsection 23(2)\nand\nsection 28\nof the\n\nLand Acquisition Act, 1894, were struck down.\n\nThis judgment was approved by the Supreme Court in\nUnion of\n\nIndia and another vs. Tarsem Singh\nand others2.\n\nThe Supreme Court in\nTarsem Singh\n(2 supra) noted that\n\nsolatium and interest were awarded to landowners for compulsory acquisition\n\nof their lands for the purpose of National Highways until the National\n\nHighways Laws (Amendment) Act, 1997 was enacted; after the\nLand\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894\nwas repealed and the\nRight to Fair Compensation and\n\nTransparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013\n\n(Act 30 of 2013) came into force, under section 105 of the said Act, a\n\nnotification dt.28.08.2015 was issued directing that provisions of the 2013 Act\n\nrelating to determination of compensation in accordance with the First\n\nSchedule would be extended to cases of land acquisition under the enactments\n2011(4) R.C.R. (Civil) 375 (DB) dt.28.03.2008\n2019(9) SCC 304\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 8 of 45\n\nspecified in the Fourth Schedule; that the\nNational Highways Act, 1956\nwas\n\nalso mentioned in the Fourth Schedule to the 2013 Act; since the Government\n\nitself is of the view that solatium and interest should be granted even in cases\n\nthat arise between 1997 and 2015, it cannot contend that landowners, who\n\nwere not granted solatium and interest in arbitral awards, should avail the\n\nremedy under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nchallenging the awards passed under the\nNational Highways Act, 1956\n. It\n\ntherefore declared that the provisions of the\nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\n\nrelating to solatium and interest contained in\nsection 23\n(1-A),\nsection 23(2)\n\nand interest payable in terms of\nsection 28\nproviso will apply to acquisitions\n\nmade under the\nNational Highways Act, 1956\n, and\nsection 3-J\nof the National\n\nHighways Act, 1956 was declared unconstitutional to the extent it did not\n\ngrant the said benefits to land owners.\n\nCounsel for the land owners contended:\n\na) In a welfare State, statutory authorities are bound to pay adequate\n\ncompensation to the land losers; inspite of delay, the High Court can grant\n\nrelief since there is a compelling demand for justice; and delay and laches\n\nis not an absolute impediment to deny exercise of discretion in favour of\n\nthe land loser when no third party interest is involved. They contended that\n\nno hard and fast rule exists that the High Court should always refuse to\n\nexercise its jurisdiction in favour of a party who moves it after\n\nconsiderable delay or is otherwise guilty of laches. They relied on the\n\ndecision in Tukaram Kana Joshi and Others Vs. MIDC and Others3,\n2013(1) SCC 353\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 9 of 45\n\nVetindia Pharmaceuticals Limited Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and\n\nAnother4\n.\n\nb) That the decision rendered by a Division Bench of this Court, in M/s\n\nGolden Iron and Steel Forgings\n(1 Supra) delivered on 28.03.2008 was\n\nnot stayed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.10695 of 2011 filed\n\nchallenging it and the same was disposed of on 03.08.2017 as settled out of\n\nCourt. They contended that\nthe said decision\nwas binding on the competent\n\nauthority and yet in the awards passed in all the matters in this batch after\n\n28.03.2008 ( some on 23.4.2008 and others on 31.12.2014 and\n\n21.12.2009), deliberately the competent authority passed awards denying\n\nthe benefits under Sections 23(1-A), 23(2) and 28 of the\nLand Acquisition\n\nAct, 1894\nto the land owners who are deprived of land by virtue of\n\nnotifications under the NHAI Act, 1956; this was impermissible on the part\n\nof the competent authority and amounts to contempt of the orders passed\n\nby this Court; and technical pleas ought not to be raised by the\n\nappellants/statutory authorities to deny legitimate claims flowing from\n\nstatute to land losers.\n\nc) Prior to 1997, benefits under\nSections 23\n(1-A), 23(2) and 28 of the\nLand\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894\nwere granted to all land losers whose lands were\n\nacquired under the\nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\nfor purpose of National\n\nHighways; the State itself had taken a decision that solatium and interest\n\nshould be granted even in cases that arise between 1997 when the\n\namendment was made to the NHAI Act, 1956 and 2015 (as recorded in\n\nTarsem Singh\n(2 Supra)); and so the land owners are entitled to the said\n2021(1) SCC 804\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 10 of 45\n\nbenefits even if they did not challenge the awards of the competent\n\nauthority before the arbitrator under Section 3J(5) of the NHAI Act, 1956\n\nor even if they did not challenge any arbitrator's award passed under the\n\nsaid provision under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 and they had directly filed Writ Petitions in this Court. It is\n\ncontended that the NHAI cannot discriminate among the landowners and\n\ngrant the said benefit to some of them and deny it to others similarly\n\nplaced.\n\nd) That Supreme Court in\nTarsem Singh\n(2 Supra) (at para 52 of the SCC)\n\nhad declined to interfere even in cases where applications under\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 had not been filed\n\nchallenging the awards of the competent authority under the\nNational\n\nHighways Act,1956\nwhen the land owners had approached the High Courts\n\ndirectly under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India as in M/s\nGolden\n\nIron and Steel Forging\n(1 Supra) ; that remedy under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is not an effective alternative\n\nremedy because the Court cannot modify an erroneous arbitral award as\n\nwas held in NHAI Vs. M. Hakeem5 and in other cases and so the writ\n\npetitions filed by them are maintainable.\n\nContentions of counsel for the NHAI\n\nShri Chetan Mittal, Senior Counsel for NHAI contends that in\n\nLPAs-4965-2018, 4976-2018, 52-2019, 324-2019, there is more than 10 years\n\ndelay on the part of the landowners in challenging the awards passed by the\n\ncompetent authority; that in LPA-204-2020, 205-2020, there is more than 7 years\n\ndelay on the part of the landowners in challenging the awards passed by\n2021 (9) SCC 1\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 11 of 45\n\nthe competent authority; that in LPAs-1536-2019, 1537-2019, 1539-2019, and\n\n1550-2019,there is more than 3 years delay on the part of the landowners in\n\nchallenging the awards passed by the competent authority; and on the ground\n\nof laches and delay in seeking relief before this Court, the landowners should\n\nbe denied relief and orders of the learned Single Judge granting such relief\n\nshould be set aside.\n\nThe following is the table submitted by the counsel for the\n\nNHAI:-\n\nLPA No. Date of Date of Award Whether Benefits granted Delay in filing\nSec. 3-A by competent challenged Writ Petition\nNotification authority before the\nArbitrator\n?\n\nLPA-4965-2018 24.12.2004 23.04.2008 No\nSec. 23(2)\n&\nyears, 3\n\nSec.28\nof the months, 22 days\n\nL.A.

In the facts of these cases, it is clear that from the point\nof view of the landowner it is immaterial that his land is acquired under the\n\nNational Highways Act\nand not the\nLand Acquisition Act\n, as solatium cannot\nbe denied on account of this fact alone.\n\n.........\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 20 of 45\n\n52. There is no doubt that the learned Solicitor General, in the\naforesaid two orders, has conceded the issue raised in these cases. This\nassumes importance in view of the plea of Shri Divan that the impugned\njudgments should be set aside on the ground that when the arbitral awards did\nnot provide for solatium or interest, no\nSection 34\npetition having been filed by\nthe landowners on this score, the Division Bench judgments that are impugned\nbefore us ought not to have allowed solatium and/or interest. Ordinarily, we\nwould have acceded to this plea, but given the fact that the Government itself is\nof the view that solatium and interest should be granted even in cases that arise\nbetween 1997 and 2015, in the interest of justice we decline to interfere with\nsuch orders, given our discretionary jurisdiction under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution of India. We therefore declare that the provisions of the\nLand\nAcquisition Act\nrelating to solatium and interest contained in\nSections 23\n(1-A)\nand (2) and interest payable in terms of\nSection 28\nproviso will apply to\nacquisitions made under the\nNational Highways Act\n.

State of Haryana21\n, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that if the alternative remedy is not effective, then a writ petition under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India can be entertained. It held:\n\n\"9. Before we deal with the larger issue, let me put out of the\n\nway the contention that found favour with the High Court in rejecting\nthe writ petition. The learned Single Judge as well as the Division\nBench recalling the observations of this Court in\nAssistant Collector\nof Central Excise v. Jainson Hosiery Industries22\nrejected the writ\npetition observing that \"the petitioner who invokes the extraordinary\njurisdiction of the court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution must\nhave exhausted the normal statutory remedies available to him\". We\nremain unimpressed. Ordinarily it is true that the court has imposed\na restraint in its own wisdom on its exercise of jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 226\nwhere the party invoking the jurisdiction has an effective,\nadequate alternative remedy. More often, it has been expressly stated\nthat the rule which requires the exhaustion of alternative remedies is\na rule of convenience and discretion rather than rule of law. At any\nrate it does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court.\n\nIn fact in the very\ndecision relied upon by the High Court in\nState of U.P. v.\nMohammad Nooh23\nit is observed \"that there is no rule, with regard\nto certiorari as there is with mandamus, that it will lie only where\n1985 (3) SCC 267, at page 274\n1979 (4) SCC 22\nAIR 1958 SC 86\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 30 of 45\n\nthere is no other equally effective remedy\". It should be made\nspecifically clear that where the order complained against is alleged\nto be illegal or invalid as being contrary to law, a petition at the\ninstance of person adversely affected by it, would lie to the High\nCourt under\nArticle 226\nand such a petition cannot be rejected on the\nground that an appeal lies to the higher officer or the State\nGovernment. An appeal in all cases cannot be said to provide in all\nsituations an alternative effective remedy keeping aside the nice\ndistinction between jurisdiction and merits. Look at the fact situation\nin this case. Power was exercised formally by the authority set up\nunder the Rules to grant contract but effectively and for all practical\npurposes by the Chief Minister of the State. To whom do you appeal\nin a State administration against the decision of the Chief Minister?\nThe clitch of appeal from Caesar to Caesar's wife can only be\nbettered by appeal from one's own order to oneself. Therefore this is\na case in which the High Court was not at all justified in throwing\nout the petition on the untenable ground that the appellant had an\neffective alternative remedy. The High Court did not pose to itself the\nquestion, who would grant relief when the impugned order is passed\nat the instance of the Chief Minister of the State. To whom did the\nHigh Court want the appeal to be filed over the decision of the Chief\nMinister. There was no answer and that by itself without anything\nmore would be sufficient to set aside the judgment of the High\nCourt.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nAgain in\nCIT v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal24\n, the Supreme Court\n\ndeclared as under:\n\n\"15. Thus, while it can be said that this Court has recognised\nsome exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy i.e. where the\nstatutory authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of\nthe enactment in question, or in defiance of the fundamental\nprinciples of judicial procedure, or has resorted to invoke the\nprovisions which are repealed, or when an order has been passed in\ntotal violation of the principles of natural justice, the proposition\nlaid\ndown in\nThansingh Nathmal case, Titaghur Paper Mills case and\nother similar judgments that the High Court will not entertain a\n(2014) 1 SCC 603, at page 610\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 31 of 45\n\npetition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution if an effective\nalternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the statute\nunder which the action complained of has been taken itself contains a\nmechanism for redressal of grievance still holds the field. Therefore,\nwhen a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances,\na writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory\ndispensation.\n\n16. In the instant case, the Act provides complete machinery for the\nassessment/reassessment of tax, imposition of penalty and for\nobtaining relief in respect of any improper orders passed by the\nRevenue Authorities, and the assessee could not be permitted to\nabandon that machinery and to invoke the jurisdiction of the High\nCourt under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution when he had adequate\nremedy open to him by an appeal to the Commissioner of Income Tax\n(Appeals). The remedy under the statute, however, must be effective\nand not a mere formality with no substantial relief.\nIn\nRam and\nShyam Co. v.

LPA filed against the said order\n\nwas dismissed on the ground of delay in filing it. The Supreme Court directed\n\nthat though, the notification dt.17.05.1996 under\nsection 4\nof the Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894 had lapsed, and though there was a delay of 20 years in\n\napproaching the High Court, in exercise of its power under\nArticle 136\nand\nof the Constitution of India, the said date should be taken as date of\n\ndeemed acquisition of the land of the respondents by the appellants; and\n\nmarket rate as on that date should be given to them along with all other\n\nstatutory benefits excluding interest from 17.05.1996 till the writ petition was\n\nfiled in the High Court. Thus the landowners were granted relief by the\n\nSupreme Court to some extent in spite of their laches for more than 20 years.\n\nIn\nOmvir Singh\n(7 supra) cited by the counsel for the NHAI, an\n\nappeal was filed in the High Court in 2014/2015, 16 years after rejection of\n\nreview applications by a reference Court refusing to review its order passed in\n\n1998 refusing to enhance compensation to landowners under the\nLand\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894\n. The High Court condoned the delay in filing the\n\nappeal, enhanced the compensation, but denied interest for the period of delay.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to interfere with the order of the High Court\n\ncondoning the delay in preferring the appeal but decided the SLP on merits\n\nholding that the landholders will not be entitled to statutory benefits excluding\n\ninterest on the enhanced amount of compensation for the delayed period in\n\npreferring appeal before the High Court.\n\nSimilar view was taken in\nRameshwar\n(8 supra) where the appeal in the\n\nHigh Court was entertained 22 years from the date of the judgment of the\n\nreference Court.\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 34 of 45\n\nIn\nJaspal Singh and others\n(9 supra) also, landowners who had\n\ndelayed filing of appeals in the High Court, were denied interest on enhanced\n\namount of compensation for the period of delay.\n\nIn\nExecutive Engineer, Nimna Dudhna Project\n(10 supra) also\n\nthe Supreme Court held that landowners should be denied interest for the\n\nperiod of delay in filing first appeals in the High Court challenging award of\n\nthe reference Court.\n\nThus, none of the above decisions supports the plea of the NHAI\n\nthat mere delay or laches in seeking remedy under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India is sufficient to refuse relief to a litigant.\n\nOn the other hand, counsel for the landowners cited Tukaram\n\nKana Joshi and others (3 supra). In that case, the Supreme Court held that\n\nthat delay and laches is only one of the facets to deny exercise of discretion but\n\nit is not an absolute impediment. If the whole thing shocks the judicial\n\nconscience, then the Court should exercise its discretion to entertain the writ\n\npetition, when no third-party interest is involved. In that case, land was\n\nnotified under\nsection 4\nof the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on 06.06.1964 for a\n\nproject but no subsequent proceedings were taken up and the acquisition\n\nproceedings lapsed. Possession of the land was taken in 1964 but no\n\ncompensation was paid to the landowners/petitioners though others similarly\n\nsituated were paid compensation in 1966. In 2009, the landowners approached\n\nthe High Court which dismissed the writ petition on the ground of delay and\n\nlaches but the Supreme Court reversed its decision by giving the above\n\nreasons. The Supreme Court declared:\n\n\"12.The State, especially a welfare State which is governed by the\nrule of law, cannot arrogate itself to a status beyond one that is\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 35 of 45\n\nprovided by the Constitution. Our Constitution is an organic and\nflexible one. Delay and laches is adopted as a mode of discretion\nto decline exercise of jurisdiction to grant relief. There is another\nfacet. The Court is required to exercise judicial discretion. The\nsaid discretion is dependent on facts and circumstances of the\ncases. Delay and laches is one of the facets to deny exercise of\ndiscretion. It is not an absolute impediment. There can be\nmitigating factors, continuity of cause action, etc. That apart, if the\nwhole thing shocks the judicial conscience, then the Court should\nexercise the discretion more so, when no third-party interest is\ninvolved. Thus analysed, the petition is not hit by the doctrine of\ndelay and laches as the same is not a constitutional limitation, the\ncause of action is continuous and further the situation certainly\nshocks judicial conscience.\n\n13. The question of condonation of delay is one of discretion and\nhas to be decided on the basis of the facts of the case at hand, as\nthe same vary from case to case. It will depend upon what the\nbreach of fundamental right and the remedy claimed are and when\nand how the delay arose. It is not that there is any period of\nlimitation for the courts to exercise their powers under\nArticle 226\n,\nnor is it that there can never be a case where the courts cannot\ninterfere in a matter, after the passage of a certain length of time.\nThere may be a case where the demand for justice is so\ncompelling, that the High Court would be inclined to interfere in\nspite of delay. Ultimately, it would be a matter within the\ndiscretion of the Court and such discretion, must be exercised\nfairly and justly so as to promote justice and not to defeat it. The\nvalidity of the party's defence must be tried upon principles\nsubstantially equitable. (\nVide P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of\nT.N.8\n,\nState of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal9\nand\nTridip Kumar\nDingal v. State of W.B.10\n)\n\n14. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to when the High\nCourt should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of a party\nwho moves it after considerable delay and is otherwise guilty of\nlaches. Discretion must be exercised judiciously and reasonably. In\nthe event that the claim made by the applicant is legally sustainable,\ndelay should be condoned. In other words, where circumstances\njustifying the conduct exist, the illegality which is manifest, cannot be\nsustained on the sole ground of laches. When\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 36 of 45\n\nsubstantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against\neach other, the cause of substantial justice deserves to be\npreferred, for the other side cannot claim to have a vested right in\nthe injustice being done, because of a non-deliberate delay. The\ncourt should not harm innocent parties if their rights have in fact\nemerged by delay on the part of the petitioners. (\nVide Durga\nPrashad v.

In that case, the\nrequisition of premises made by the State was assailed.\"\n\nIn\nVetindia Pharmaceuticals Limited\n(4 supra) the Supreme\n\nCourt reiterated the said principle and held that jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution of India is equitable in nature, and it is not a mandatory\n\nrequirement that every delayed petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\n\nof India must be dismissed on the ground of delay. It observed:\n\n\"15. That brings us to the question of delay. There is no doubt that\nthe High Court in its discretionary jurisdiction may decline to exercise\nthe discretionary writ jurisdiction on the ground of delay in\napproaching the court. But it is only a rule of discretion by exercise of\nself-restraint evolved by the court in exercise of the discretionary\nequitable jurisdiction and not a mandatory requirement that every\ndelayed petition must be dismissed on the ground of delay.\nThe\nLimitation Act\nstricto sensu does not apply to the writ jurisdiction. The\ndiscretion vested in the court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\ntherefore has to be a judicious exercise of the discretion after\nconsidering all pros and cons of the matter, including the nature of\nthe dispute, the explanation for the delay, whether any third-party\nrights have intervened, etc. The jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nbeing\nequitable in nature, questions of proportionality in considering\nwhether the impugned order merits interference or not in exercise of\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 37 of 45\n\nthe discretionary jurisdiction will also arise. This Court in\nBasanti\nPrasad v. Bihar School Examination Board7\n, after referring to\nMoon\nMills Ltd. v. M.R. Meher8\n,\nMaharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular\nMotor Service9\nand\nState of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal10\n, held that if\nthe delay is properly explained and no third-party rights are being\naffected, the writ court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution may\ncondone the delay, holding as follows: (Basanti Prasad case7, SCC p.\n796, para 18)\n\"18. In the normal course, we would not have taken exception to\nthe order passed by the High Court. They are justified in saying that a\ndelinquent employee should not be permitted to revive the stale claim\nand the High Court in exercise of its discretion would not ordinarily\nassist the tardy and indolent person. This is the traditional view and is\nwell supported by a plethora of decisions of this Court. This Court\nalso has taken the view that there is no inviolable rule, that, whenever\nthere is delay the Court must refuse to entertain a petition. This Court\nhas stated that the writ court in exercise of its extraordinary\njurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution may condone the\ndelay in filing the petition, if the delay is satisfactorily explained.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIn\nSukh Dutt Ratra v. State of H.P.25\nrecently the Supreme Court\n\ndeclared in a case where the State deprived a person of property without\n\nfollowing due process of law and sought to contest his case on ground of\n\nlaches as under:\n\n\"18. There is a welter of precedents on delay and laches which conclude\neither way--as contended by both sides in the present dispute--however, the\nspecific factual matrix compels this Court to weigh in favour of the appellant\nlandowners. The State cannot shield itself behind the ground of delay and laches\nin such a situation; there cannot be a \"limitation\" to doing justice. This Court in\na much earlier case --\nMaharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular Motor Service26\n,\nheld : (AIR pp. 335-36, para 11)\n\"11. ... 'Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or\na technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either\nbecause the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as\n(2022) 7 SCC 508, at page 516\nAIR 1969 SC 329\n\nSURESH KUMAR\n\n2023.04.18 09:41\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nintegrity of this document\n\n[2023:PHHC:053158-DB]\nLPA-4965-2018\n2018 and connected cases\n\nPage 38 of 45\n\nequivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though\nperhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it\nwould not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be\nasserted in either of these cases,\ncases, lapse of time and delay are most material.\n\nBut in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be\njust, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by\nany statute of limitations, the validity of that defenc\ndefence must be tried upon principles\nsubstantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are,\nthe length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which\nmight affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the\none course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy'\nremedy'.\"\n\n19. The facts of the present case reveal that the State has, in a clandestine and\narbitrary manner, actively tried to limit disbursal of compensation as required by\nlaw, only\nnly to those for which it was specifically prodded by the courts, rather than\nto all those who are entitled. This arbitrary action, which is also violative of the\nappellants' prevailing\nArticle 31\nright (at the time of cause of action),\nundoubtedly warranted\nwarranted consideration, and intervention by the High Court, under\nits\nArticle 226\njurisdiction.\"\n\nThe action of the competent authority under\nSection 3G (1)\nof the\n\nNational Highways Act,1956 in denying the solatium and interest akin to that\n\ngranted under\nSections 23(2)\nand\nof the Land Acquisition Act,1894 inspite\n\nof binding precedents such as M/s Golden\nlden\nIron and Steel Forgings\n(1\n1 supra)\n\nand\nSunita Mehra\n(19 supra) shocks our judicial conscience, and it seems\nms that\n\nit is actively trying to limit the quantum of compensation as required by law\n\nbeing paid to only those for which it is specifically prodde\nprodded\nd by the Courts,\n\nrather than to all those who are entitled, and act arbitrarily.
