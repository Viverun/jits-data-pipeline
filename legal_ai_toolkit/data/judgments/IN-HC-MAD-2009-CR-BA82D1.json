  "text": "Madhya Pradesh High Court\n\nRajesh Kumar Sahu vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 7 July, 2009\n\nMCrC No.2859/2009.\n07.07.2009.\nShri Dilip Parihar, Advocate for the applicant.\nShri A.L. Patel, Govt. Advocate for the respondent-State.\n\nArguments heard.\n\nThis is the third application for grant of bail inter alia on the ground\nof delay in trial. The earlier ones were dismissed as withdrawn with liberty\nto file afresh in the light of subsequent events.\n\nAfter being arrested in connection with Crime No.36/2008\nregistered at P.S. Waidhan, in respect of the offences punishable under\nSections 498A and 304B read with\nS.34\nof the IPC, the applicant is in\njudicial custody since 16.01.2008. The corresponding trial is pending as\nS.T. No.84/2008 before First ASJ, Waidhan Distt. Sidhi.\n\nThe applicant is the husband of Vimla (since deceased). Their\nmarriage was solemnized nearly 3 years prior to her death. The\nallegations against him, in short, are that he was also involved in\nsubjecting Vimla to cruelty and harassment due to non-satisfaction of a\ndemand for motorcycle in dowry and ultimately, on 03.01.2008, Vimla was\nfound dead under suspicious circumstances and her viscera was found to\ncontain rat poison (zinc phosphide).\n\nThe progress report forwarded by learned Sessions Judge depicts a\nsorry state of affairs. Some of the unusual features of the trial as\nhighlighted in the report may be enumerated as under -\n\n(i) On 22.09.2008, the first date fixed for recording of\nprosecution evidence, 4 witnesses could not be\nexamined due to non-production of applicant-accused\nfrom the jail.\n\n(ii) On 23.09.2008, as many as 6 out of 7 witnesses, who\nappeared before the Court in obedience to the\nsummons, were given up by the public prosecutor.\n\n(iii) On 25.09.2008, 3 witnesses including medical expert Dr.\nR.B. Singh and Executive Magistrate B.L. Bahariya were\npresent but they had to return unexamined on account\nof non-production of the applicant-accused.\n\nIt is true that normally the trial should be conducted in presence of\nthe accused. However, under certain circumstances as contemplated in\n\nSection 317\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, trial can be held even in\nabsence of the accused. This section applies irrespective of whether the\naccused is in jail or on bail.\n\nIn criminal cases, the State is the prosecutor but the interests of\nState and the complainant are not always the same. The role of the\nProsecutor in any criminal trial, whether at the instance of the State or a\nprivate party is to safeguard the interests of both the complainant and the\naccused. As observed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court,\nthough in a different context -\n\n\"the duties of the Prosecutor and the requirements of\na fair trial do not vary from case to case. Besides, there is\nalways the Court to safeguard the interests of the accused\nand the complainant, to control the proceedings and to check\nomissions and commissions of the Prosecutor. The court is\nnot a silent spectator to the proceedings but an active\nparticipant in it\" (See.\nVijay v. State of Maharashtra\nCRI.L.J. 2093).\n\nThe Court has to consider whether the progress of the trial is likely\nto be hampered on account of non-production of the accused. It is the\nduty of the prosecutor as well as the defence counsel to assist the Court\nin reaching a proper conclusion as to whether the evidence of\nuninterested persons like Doctor or the Executive Magistrate, who had not\nwitnessed the incident, can be recorded even in absence of the accused.\nMoreover, the prosecutor is also expected to make a fair and honest\nselection of witnesses so as to enable the Court to expedite the trial. For\nexample, initially, he may call only one of the 5 witnesses to the inquest\nproceedings. Needless to say that summoning of witnesses who are\nsubsequently declared by him as unnecessary not only causes\ninconvenience to them but also results in burden on the State Exchequer.\n\nOrdinarily, a person shall be eligible to be appointed as a Public\nProsecutor in a District only if he has been an advocate of 7 years\nstanding but no such person can be appointed as a Public Prosecutor\nunless his name appears in the panel prepared by District Magistrate in\nconsultation with District and Sessions Judge. Time and again, the Apex\nCourt has emphasized the need of ensuring that the prosecuting agency\ndischarges its duty and responsibility fairly and efficiently as the society\nacting through the State and the Public Prosecutor is also entitled to\njustice. In this view of the matter, it is for the State to ascertain that only\nsuitable persons, having requisite experience, are appointed to perform\nduty of the Public Prosecutors/Additional Public Prosecutors for the\nDistrict.\n\nAdverting to the merits of the case, it may be seen that death of\nVimla is shrouded with suspicion as poisoning has been ascertained as the\ncause thereof. Further, it would not be desirable to enter into merits of\nthe defence that the demand for motorcycle was apparently improbable in\nview of the admitted fact that it was a love marriage.\n\nThis apart, in a dowry death case, bail should not be granted solely\non the ground of delay in trial particularly when the defence was\ncontributorily responsible for it.\n\nTaking into consideration the nature of allegations and other facts\nand circumstances of the case attracting statutory presumption under\n\nSection 113-B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, the repeat bail application\nstands dismissed with the observation that if the trial is not completed\nwithin a period of three months from the date of receipt of certified copy\nof this order and the delay is not attributable to the applicant, he shall be\nat liberty to re-agitate the prayer for grant of bail before this Court.\n\nCopy of this order be forwarded to the Principal Secretary,\nDepartment of Law and Legislative Affairs, Bhopal, District & Sessions\nJudge, Sidhi and District Magistrate, Sidhi for information and necessary\naction.\n\nC.C. as per rules.\n\n(R.C. Mishra)\nJUDGE",
