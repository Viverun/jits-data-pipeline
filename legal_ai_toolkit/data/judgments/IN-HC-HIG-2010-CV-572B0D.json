Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed\nto see the Judgment? Yes\n\n2. To be referred to the Reporter or not? Yes\n\n3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the\nDigest? Yes\n\nGITA MITTAL, J\n\n1. The instant case is a testimony to events which lead to an\n\nunprecedented ethnic cleansing of a minority community from\n\nthe Kashmir valley on account of the inability of the State to\n\nprotect them and their property from violence, who, as a result,\n\nwere rendered homeless. Such turmoil was faced by the\n\nminority community in the state of Jammu & Kashmir after\n\nDecember, 1989, compelling its members to flee home, hearth\n\nand State for bare survival.\n\nThese writ petitions have been filed by some of such\n\ndisplaced persons who were Central Government employees\n\nseeking protection against forcible eviction of the quarters\n\noccupied by them on the ground that it is the only roof available\n\nto them.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 8 of 157\n\n2. The petitioners contend that those representing the\n\nCentral Government in the Kashmir valley, especially those who\n\nwere representing the intelligence agencies, para military and\n\ndefence forces as well as the Government media became prime\n\ntargets of the militants to the extent that lists of such persons\n\nwho had to be targeted were published and circulated in the\n\nlocalities. Family members and friends of such Government\n\nemployees were killed and their properties destroyed for the\n\nmessage to permeate. As a result, immediate steps for\n\nevacuation of such officials on emergency basis were taken by\n\nthe Government of India in order to at least protect their lives.\n\n3. The writ petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos. 5681/2007, 2869,\n\n8599, 8600, 8601/2008, 11377/2009, 15239, 15240, 15245,\n\n15246, 862, 15241, 15264, 15279, 15698, 1779/2004,\n\n2641/2006, 7057/2007, 8641, 9609, 11548, 11488, 11489,\n\n11490 & 11491/2009 were shifted from Jammu & Kashmir to\n\nDelhi and posted in the local offices of the central organization\n\nand department where they were employed.\n\n4. The facts disclose that all the petitioners (or the person on\n\nwhom they were dependant as in the case of Smt. Phoola Raina\n\nwidow of Late Sh. T.N. Raina writ petitioner in W.P.(C) No.\n\n15698/2004) upon being brought to Delhi were allotted\n\nGovernment accommodation to reside in, not only by virtue of\n\ntheir employment but also their extreme need for shelter. These\n\nallottees of the quarters, superannuated from service on\n\ndifferent dates over the period of time.\n\n5. W.P.(C) No.15698/2004 has been filed by Smt. Phoola\n\nRaina, widow of Late Shri T.N. Raina who was a Government\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 9 of 157\n\nservant. Shri Raina was the allottee of Government\n\naccommodation bearing no. DG-915, Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi-\n\n23. While still in service Shri T.N. Raina unfortunately expired\n\non the 4th of August, 2001. The petitioner contends that late Sh.\n\nT.N. Raina and family which included herself were compelled to\n\nflee from the valley in circumstances identical to those of the\n\nother petitioners. This petitioner is surviving on a meager\n\npension and she cannot afford any alternate accommodation.\n\n6. The petitioner in W.P.(C) No.5681/2007 evacuated in the\n\nsame emergent conditions, is stated to be afflicted with the\n\nParkinson's disease since his retirement. His home in Kashmir\n\nstands burnt. His relative, one Mrs. Chuni Lal had gone to\n\nretrieve her belongings from Kashmir, but was shot dead at\n\npoint blank range. The petitioner is stated to be barely\n\nsurviving on his pension. He has no place to return in his home\n\nstate.\n\n7. So far as the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.2869/2008 and his\n\nfamily are concerned, they were shifted out by the Government\n\non account of the perception of a serious threat to their lives. It\n\nis contended that the militants have burnt the petitioner‟s\n\nancestral home in order to demonstrate their intention of not\n\nsparing him. In addition, they have shot dead his uncle and wife\n\nat point blank range. As a result, other than the quarter under\n\noccupation, the petitioner is without any alternate shelter.\n\n8. Shri P.K. Koul, the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 15239/2004,\n\nwas a resident of Razdan, Kochhaa, Bana Mohalla, Habba Kadal,\n\nSrinagar and his entire property in Srinagar has been destroyed\n\nby the communal riots and terrorist movements. He clearly\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 10 of 157\n\nstates that he has no other house anywhere in India. This\n\npetitioner was lastly posted as the Director General with the\n\nBorder Security Force at R.K. Puram, New Delhi. While in\n\nservice, this petitioner was allotted the premises no. H-52,\n\nSarojini Nagar, New Delhi. On 31st July, 2002, the petitioner\n\nsuperannuated from service. The allotment of this\n\naccommodation in his name was cancelled by a letter dated\n\n27/28th August, 2002 with effect from 1st December, 2002\n\ndirecting the petitioner to vacate the accommodation\n\nimmediately and he was informed that on failure to vacate,\n\naction to evict him under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\nwould be taken. The\n\nrespondents also informed the petitioner that on failure to\n\nvacate, he would be liable to pay damage rent @ Rupees 150\n\nper sq. mtr. for the entire period of over stay. The petitioner\n\nwas permitted to retain the accommodation from 1st December,\n\n2002 to 31st April, 2003 on payment of four times of the normal\n\nlicense fee for the next two months.\n\n9. The petitioner and his family are permanent residents of\n\nthe State of J&K and did not leave their home state voluntarily\n\nbut were driven out of the Srinagar valley. Their household\n\ngoods were looted and house was burnt by the terrorists. Other\n\nthan the one residence, which also stands destroyed by the\n\nmilitants in Srinagar, Shri P.K. Koul owned no other property. A\n\ngrievance is made that the respondents have taken no action for\n\nthe reconstruction of the houses of the petitioners and others\n\nlike him which were destroyed by the militants and to\n\nrehabilitate them resulting in a pitiable condition and absence\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 11 of 157\n\nof any security for them. Consequently, they are unable to\n\nreturn to their own homes.\n\n10. In this background, the petitioner submitted a\n\nrepresentation dated 24th March, 2003 seeking permission from\n\nthe respondent to retain his accommodation on payment of the\n\nexisting normal license fee setting out the above facts. Despite\n\npermitting retention of accommodation by other similarly placed\n\npersons, this request of the petitioner was rejected by the letter\n\ndated 20th February, 2003. The respondent no. 2 further\n\nreferred the case for eviction of the petitioner, treating him as\n\nan unauthorised occupant of public premises under the\nPublic\n\nPremises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n.\n\n11. In these proceedings, the following eviction order dated\n\n23rd September, 2003 was passed against the petitioner which\n\nwas served on him on 18th November, 2003:-\n\n\"OFFICE OF THE ESTATE OFFICER AND DEPUTY\nDIRECTOR OF ESTATE (LIT.)

The petitioner filed an appeal registered as PPA No.\n\n333/2003 challenging the said eviction order.\n\nIt is contended that the learned Additional District Judge\n\nmechanically dismissed the petitioner's appeal by an order\n\ndated 10th September, 2004 ignoring the orders passed by the\n\nSupreme Court and other precedents of this court in respect of\n\nidentically placed persons, necessitating the present petition.\n\nThe submission is that the cancellation of the petitioner's\n\nallotment by the letter dated 27/28th August, 2002; rejection of\n\nthe petitioner‟s request by the letter dated 20th of February,\n\n2003; the order of eviction dated 23rd September, 2003, as well\n\nas the order of the learned ADJ dated 10th September, 2004 are\n\nlegally not sustainable.\n\nThe writ petition lays a challenge to these orders as well\n\nas the non-action of the respondents.\n\n13.

In these writ petitions, the petitioners have all contended\n\nthat they are permanent residents of Jammu & Kashmir and\n\nhave no desire whatsoever to reside in Delhi. However, on\n\naccount of the prevailing circumstances and the inability of the\n\nGovernment to secure their lives and properties in their home\n\nstate, they are unable to return to the state. Their properties\n\nand only homes in the valley have either been destroyed or\n\noccupied.\n\n15. Passage of time also has brought no change in the\n\nconditions prevalent in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The\n\npetitioners remain unable to return to their own homes.\n\n16. Mr. R.K.Handoo, Mr. B.L. Wali and Mr. Samrat Nigam,\n\nlearned counsels appearing for the petitioners, with all the\n\nvehemence at their command, have urged that the status of the\n\npetitioners stands reduced to that of `refugees' in their own\n\ncountry with nowhere to go and no support at all from the state,\n\nthe only difference being that instead of being displaced to\n\nanother country, the petitioners stand evicted within their own\n\ncountry.\n\n17. The petitioners have contended that discretion and power\n\nis vested in the respondents under SR 317-B-25 of the Allotment\n\nof the Government Residence (General Pool in Delhi) Rules to\n\npermit any person to occupy public premises. Instances have\n\nbeen cited of the respondents permitting other persons\n\nincluding identically displaced Kashmiris to occupy public\n\npremises. It is complained that the respondents have unfairly\n\nfailed to consider the special circumstances so far as the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 17 of 157\n\npetitioners are concerned and have discriminated against them.\n\nThe writ petitioners thus assail the failure of the respondents to\n\nexercise the discretion vested in them to permit the petitioners\n\nto continue to occupy the quarters, in accordance with law on\n\nthe ground of arbitrariness.\n\n18. The submission is that the refusal of the respondents to\n\npermit the petitioners to retain the allotment on payment of\n\nnormal license fee is illegal and results in violation of the\n\nconstitutional rights of the petitioner as well as the\n\nconstitutional and public law obligations, responsibilities and\n\nduties of the respondents.\n\n19. It is submitted that in the given circumstances the\n\npetitioners cannot be deemed to be in „unauthorised occupation‟\n\nfor the purposes of the application of the\nPublic Premises\n\n(Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n. The\n\npetitioners contend that the respondents were constitutionally\n\nmandated to protect their right to life under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India and having failed to do so, were bound to\n\nensure the right to shelter of the petitioners, which is an\n\nessential concomitant thereof. In this background, the\n\npetitioners challenge inaction qua the rights of the petitioners;\n\nthe legality and validity of the cancellation of the allotments of\n\nthe quarters; as well as the proceedings and all orders under\n\nthe\nPublic Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act,\n. It is contended that the respondents have ignored all\n\nrelevant material in initiating the proceedings against the\n\npetitioners, passing the impugned orders.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 18 of 157\n\nRespondents contentions\n\n20. Mr. Jatan Singh, learned Standing Counsel for the Union\n\nof India and Mr. R.V. Sinha, learned counsel for the respondents\n\nchallenge the very maintainability of these writ petitions. It is\n\ncontended that the public premises were allotted to employees\n\nof the Government by virtue of their employment. Such\n\nrelationships having come to an end on superannuation/demise\n\nof the government servant, learned counsels strongly urge that\n\nthe petitioners have no right at all to continue to occupy the\n\nofficial accommodation after their retirement. It is further\n\nurged that the petitioners have no right or entitlement to any\n\naccommodation from the respondents. The submission is that\n\nthe decisions against the petitioners are in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1971 and judicial precedents on the\n\nsubject and cannot be faulted on any legally tenable grounds.\n\nMaterial pleadings\n\n21. Before examining these submissions, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners have drawn attention to the petitioner's\n\npleadings in grounds\nA to H, K, L & M of WP (C)\n\nNo.15239/2004 P.K. Koul Vs.

Because the Petitioner has the\nFundamental Right to live which is\nguaranteed to him under the\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India and\nwhich Right includes the Right to\nShelter also.\n\nE.

His pensionary income is\nnot even sufficient to buy food\nmaterial for his family members. He\nhas no other income whatsoever.\n\nG. Because unless the Respondent\nNo.1 namely, the Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment who is the nodal agency\nto ensure proper shelter to the\ncitizens of India provide suitable\naccommodation to the Petitioner and\nother similarly placed Kashmiri\nmigrants at affordable price and in\neasy installments, no retired\nKashmiris can acquire a house of\ntheir own and move to the same. The\nRespondents have of their own and\nmove to the same. The\nRespondents have not taken any\npositive action in this direction so\nthat the Kashmiri migrants are\nrehabilitated properly and with\ndignity.\n\nH. Because in the face of the\npeculiar circumstances and abnormal\nconditions prevailing in the State of\nJammu and Kashmir, employees of\nthe State of J & K were granted relief\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia on humanitarian considerations\nand on the basis of equality.\n\nxxx xxx\nxxx\n\nK.

The above narration would show that the respondents\n\nadmit the correctness of the factual submissions, rights claimed\n\nand entitlements of the petitioners in these grounds of the writ\n\npetition.\n\nNature of rights involved in these petitions\n\nConstitutional guarantees\n\n23. Before proceeding to examine the challenge laid by the\n\npetitioners, it is essential to examine the right of the petitioners\n\nwhich is involved.\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nof the Constitution of India\n\nstates that all citizens shall have the right to reside and settle in\n\nany part of the territory of India.\nArticle 21\non the other hand\n\nstates that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal\n\nliberty except according to procedure established by law.\n\n24. The petitioners question the jurisdiction and legality of the\n\nrespondent‟s actions and threat to forcibly evict them from their\n\nonly shelter in purported exercise of statutory powers utilizing\n\nthe process prescribed under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n(hereafter referred to as the\n\n„Public Premises Act, 1971‟).\n\n25. In 1995 (2) SLR 72, P.G. Gupta Vs. State of Gujarat &\n\nOrs., the Supreme Court held that food, shelter and clothing are\n\nthe minimal human rights. The court reiterated its earlier\n\nexpansion of the right to residence and settlement by again\n\nholding that, it is a \"fundamental right under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 24 of 157\n\nand it is a facet of inseparable meaningful right to life under\n\nArticle 21\"\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n26. Fundamental rights are guaranteed to the citizens of India\n\nunder part III of the Constitution of India. In (1996) 2 SCC\n\n549 Chameli Singh & Ors. Vs. State of U.P. & Anr., the\n\nSupreme Court held that the right to shelter is a fundamental\n\nright available to every citizen of India. It was also read into the\n\nright to life guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution to\n\nmake it more meaningful. In para 8 of the judgment, the court\n\nsuccinctly set out the nature of the right and the mandate on the\n\nstate as follows:-\n\n\"8. In any organised society, right to live as a\nhuman being is not ensured by meeting only the\nanimal needs of man. It is secured only when he is\nassured of all facilities to develop himself and is freed\nfrom restrictions which inhibit his growth. All human\nrights are designed to achieve this object. Right to\nlive guaranteed in any civilised society implies the\nright to food, water, decent environment, education,\nmedical care and shelter. These are basic human\nrights known to any civilised society. All civil,\npolitical, social and cultural rights enshrined in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and\nConvention or under the Constitution of India cannot\nbe exercised without these basic human rights.\nShelter for a human being, therefore, is not a mere\nprotection of his life and limb. It is home where he\nhas opportunities to grow physically, mentally,\nintellectually and spiritually. Right to shelter,\ntherefore, includes adequate living space and\ndecent structures, clean and decent surroundings,\nsufficient light, pure air and water, electricity,\nsanitation and other civic amenities like roads etc. so\nas to have easy access to his daily avocation. The\nright to shelter, therefore, does not mean a mere\nright to a roof over one's head but right to all\nthe infrastructure necessary to enable them to\nlive and develop as a human being. Right to\nshelter when used as an essential requisite to\nthe right to live should be deemed to have been\nguaranteed as a fundamental right. As is\nenjoined in the Directive Principles, the State\nshould be deemed to be under an obligation to\nsecure it for its citizens of course subject to its\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 25 of 157\n\neconomic budgeting. In a democratic society as a\nmember of the organised civil community one should\nhave permanent shelter so as to physically, mentally\nand intellectually equip oneself to improve his\nexcellence as a useful citizen as enjoined in the\nFundamental Duties and to be a useful citizen and\nequal participant in democracy. The ultimate object of\nmaking a man equipped with a right to dignity of\nperson and equality of status is to enable him to\ndevelop himself into a culture being. Want of decent\nresidence, therefore, frustrates the very object of\nthe Constitutional animation of right to equality,\neconomic justice, fundamental right to\nresidence, dignity of person and right to live\nitself.......\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court unequivocally declared that all the civil,\n\npolitical, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights and Convention, 1948 or under the\n\nConstitution of India cannot be exercised without, inter alia, the\n\nbasic human right of shelter.\n\n27. The right to shelter as an essential concomitant of the\n\nfundamental right to life was also pressed by the pavement\n\ndwellers in the pronouncement reported at (1997) 11 SCC 121\n\nAhmedabad Municipal Corporation Vs. Nawab Khan Gulab\n\nKhan & Ors. The Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad was\n\ncomplaining against encroachment and occupation of\n\npavements in the urban limits of Ahmedabad by the pavement\n\ndwellers (respondents therein). The court was concerned with\n\nthe plea of violation of fundamental rights of the pavement\n\ndwellers under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nand\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia and their entitlement to shelter. The summation by the\n\nCourt placing reliance on the several precedents on the subject\n\nthrows light on the very question which has been raised herein\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 26 of 157\n\nalso. After reiterating the principles in earlier judgments, the\n\nobservations of the Supreme Court read as follows:-\n\n\"13. Socio-economic justice, equality of status\nand of opportunity and dignity of person to foster\nthe fraternity among all the sections of the\nsociety in an integrated Bharat is the arch of the\nConstitution set down in its preamble.\nArticles\nand\nenjoins the State to provide facilities\nand opportunities.\nArticles 38\nand\nof the\nConstitution enjoin the State to promote welfare\nof the people by securing social and economic\njustice to the weaker sections of the society to\nminimise inequalities in income and endeavour\nto eliminate inequalities in status. In that case, it\nwas held that to bring the Dalits and the Tribes\ninto the mainstream of national life, the State\nwas to provide facilities and opportunities as it is\nthe duty of the State to fulfil the basic human\nand constitutional rights to residents so as to\nmake the right to life meaningful.\nIn\nShantistar\nBuilders v. Narayan Khimalal Totame\nAIR 1990\nSC 630, another Bench of three Judges had held\nthat basic needs of man have traditionally been\naccepted to be three-food, clothing and shelter.\nThe right to life is guaranteed in any civilised\nsociety. That would take within its sweep the\nright to food, the right to clothing, the right to\ndecent environment and a reasonable\naccommodation to live in. The difference\nbetween the need of an animal and a human\nbeing for shelter has to be kept in view. For an\nanimal, it is the bare protection of the body; for a\nhuman being, it has to be a suitable\naccommodation which would allow him to grow\nin every aspect-physical, mental and intellectual.\nThe surplus urban-vacant land was directed to\nbe used to provide shelter to the poor.\nIn Olga\nTellis case (supra), the Constitution Bench had\nconsidered the right to dwell on pavements or in\nslums by the indigent and the same was\naccepted as a part of right to life enshrined\nunder\nArticle 21;\ntheir ejectment from the place\nnearer to their work would be deprivation of\ntheir right to livelihood.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\nIt would, therefore, be clear that though no\nperson has a right to encroach and erect\nstructures or otherwise on footpath, pavement or\npublic streets or any other place reserved or\nearmarked for a public purpose, the State has\nthe Constitutional duty to provide adequate\nfacilities and opportunities by distributing its\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 27 of 157\n\nwealth and resources for settlement of life and\nerection of shelter over their heads to make\nthe right to life meaningful, effective and fruitful.\nRight to livelihood is meaningful because no one\ncan live without means of this living, that is the\nmeans of livelihood. The deprivation of the right\nto life in that context would not only denude life\nof effective content and meaningfulness but it\nwould make life miserable and impossible to live.\nIt would, therefore, be the duty of the State\nto provide right to shelter to the poor and\nindigent weaker sections of the society in\nfulfilment of the constitutional objectives.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n25.\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nof the Constitution provides\nto all citizens fundamental rights to travel, settle\ndown and reside in any part of the Bharat and\nnone have right to prevent their settlement. Any\nattempt in that behalf would be unconstitutional.\nThe Preamble of the Constitution assures\nintegrity of the nation, fraternity among the\npeople and dignity of the person to make India\nan integrated and united Bharat in a socialist\nsecular democratic republic. The policy or\nprinciple should be such that everyone should\nhave the opportunity to migrate and settle down\nin any part of Bharat where opportunity for\nemployment or better living conditions are\navailable and, therefore, it would be\nunconstitutional and impermissible to prevent\nthe persons from migrating and settling at places\nwhere they find their livelihood and means of\navocation. It is to remember that the Preamble is\nthe arch of the Constitution which accords to\nevery citizen of India socio-economic and\npolitical justice, liberties, equality of opportunity\nand of status, fraternity, dignity of person in an\nintegrated Bharat. The fundamental rights and\nthe directive principles and the preamble being\ntrinity of the Constitution, the right to residence\nand to settle in any part of the country is assured\nto every citizen. ..........The right to life\nenshrined under\nArticle 21\nhas been interpreted\nby this Court to include meaningful right to life\nand not merely animal existence as elaborated in\nseveral judgments of this Court including\nHawkers' case, Olga Tellis case and the latest\nChameli Singh's case and host of other decisions\nwhich need no reiteration.

The petitioners are facing threatened forcible eviction\n\nfrom the only shelter they know which was allotted by the\n\nrespondents, either to them or the person on whom they were\n\ndependant. If compelled to vacate without provision of an\n\nalternative, the inevitable consequence is, that the petitioners\n\nwould be rendered homeless.\n\n29. It is obvious that the present petitions raise an important\n\naspect of right to shelter of these displaced persons under\n\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nand which has been declared by the Supreme\n\nCourt to be an integral and essential part also of their right to\n\nlife, guaranteed as a fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. In the several binding judicial precedents\n\nnoticed hereinabove, the Supreme Court has further held that\n\nsuch violation may also adversely impact and violate the right to\n\noccupation and profession under\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nof the\n\nConstitution of India which is the other basic human right of the\n\npetitioners inextricably involved in the instant case.\n\nInternational perspective - conventions; norms; guiding\nprinciples and their applicability to present case\n\n30.

This court has had occasion to examine the source of the\n\nright to housing, shelter and protection against forcible\n\nevictions by residents of Jhuggi Jhopri clusters (hutments) in the\n\njudgments dated 14th July, 2006 in W.P.(C) No. 5007/2002\n\nreported at MANU/DE/9327/2006 entitled\nJagdish vs. DDA\n\nand also the pronouncement of this court dated 11th February,\n\n2010 in W.P.(C) No. 8904/2009\nSudama Singh & Ors. vs\n\nGovernment of Delhi & Anr.\nwith connected writ petitions.\n\nIn this regard, in these judgments as well, reference was made\n\nto the following international & regional covenants and\n\ndeclarations on the right to adequate housing which declare\n\nthat provision of housing as well as the protection against\n\nforced eviction is the unequivocal responsibility of the state :-\n\n(i)The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948\nmakes the following statement:\n\n\"\nArticle 25.1\n\nEveryone has the right to a standard of living\nadequate for the health and well-being of himself and his\nfamily including food, clothing, housing and medical care\nand necessary social services, and the right to security in\nthe event of unemployment, sickness, disability,\nwidowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in\ncircumstances beyond his control.\"\n\n(ii) The International Convention on the Elimination\nof All forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965 contains\nthe following :\n\n\"\nArticle 5\n\nIn compliance with the fundamental\nobligations\nlaid down in\n\narticle 2\nof this\nConvention, States Parties undertake to\nprohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 30 of 157\n\nin all its forms and to guarantee the right of\neveryone, without distinction as to race,\ncolour, or national or ethnic origin, to\nequality before the law, notably in the\nenjoyment of the following rights :\n\nxxxx\n\n(d) Other civil rights, in particular\n\nxxxx\n\n(iii) The right to housing.\"\n\n(iii).\nArticle 11\nof the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations on the 16th of\nDecember, 1966 further codifies the right to housing and\nstates thus :\n\n\"\nArticle 11\n\n\"1.\nThe State Parties to the present Covenant\nrecognize the right of everyone to an adequate\nstandard of living for himself and his family,\nincluding adequate food, clothing, and\nhousing, and to the continuous improvement of\nliving conditions...........\"\n\nIndia has signed and ratified this covenant and is thus a\nstate party to it.\n\n(iv) Part II of the Declaration of Social Progress and\nDevelopment, 1969 states thus :\n\n\"Social progress and development shall aim\nat the continuous raising of the material and\nspiritual standards of living of all members of\nsociety, with respect for and in compliance\nwith human rights and fundamental freedoms\nthrough the attainment of the following main\ngoals:\n\nxxxx\n\nArticle 10(f)\n\nThe provision for all, particularly persons in\nlow-income groups and large families, of\nadequate housing and community services.\n\n(v) Part III Section (8) of the Vancouver Declaration\nof Human Settlements, 1976 mandates as follows :\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 31 of 157\n\n\"III Guidelines for Action\n\nxxxx\n\n8.

It concluded that forced evictions are\nprima facie incompatible with the\nrequirement of the Covenant...............\n\n(2) The international community has long\nrecognized that the issue of forced evictions is a\nserious one. In 1976, the United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements noted that\nspecial attention should be paid to \"undertaking\nmajor clearance operations should take place\nonly when conservation and rehabilitation are\nnot feasible and relocation measures are made.\n\nIn 1988, in the Global Strategy for Shelter to\nthe Year 2000, adopted by the General\nAssembly in its resolution 43/181, the\n\"fundamental obligation (of Government) to\nprotect and improve houses and neighborhoods,\nrather than damage or destroy them\" was\nrecognized. Agenda 21 stated that \"people\nshould be protected by law against unfair\neviction from their homes or land\". In the\nHabitat Agenda Governments committed\nthemselves to \"protecting all people from, and\nproviding legal protection and redress for,\nforced evictions that are contrary to the law,\ntaking human rights into consideration; [and]\nwhen evictions are unavoidable, ensuring, as\nappropriate, that alternative suitable solutions\nare provided\". The Commission on Human\nRights has also indicated that \"forced evictions\nare a gross violation of human rights........\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 33 of 157\n\n(x) Annexure-I of the Report of the Special\nRapporteur on Adequate Housing lays down some\nbasic principles and guidelines on development based\nevictions and displacement. It provides the guidelines\non relocation of the displaced which read as follows :\n\n\"52. The Government and any other parties\nresponsible for providing just\ncompensation and sufficient alternative\naccommodation, or restitution when\nfeasible, must do so immediately upon the\neviction, except in cases of force majeure. At a\nminimum, regardless of the circumstances and\nwithout discrimination, competent authorities\nshall ensure that evicted persons or groups,\nespecially those who are unable to provide for\nthemselves, have safe and secure access to: (a)\nessential food, potable water and sanitation; (b)\nbasic shelter and housing; (c) appropriate\nclothing; (d) essential medical services; (e)\nlivelihood sources; (f) fodder for livestock and\naccess to common property resources\npreviously depended upon; and (g) education\nfor children and childcare facilities. States\nshould also ensure that members of the same\nextended family or community are not\nseparated as a result of evictions.\n\nxxx\n\n55. Identified relocation sites must fulfil the\ncriteria for adequate housing according to\ninternational human rights law. These include:\n\n(a) security of tenure;\nXxx\n(c) affordable housing;\n\n(d) habitable housing providing inhabitants\nwith adequate space, protection from cold,\ndamp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to\nhealth, structural hazards and disease vectors,\nand ensuring the physical safety of occupants;\nxxx\n\n(d) No affected persons, groups or communities\nshall suffer detriment as far as their human\nrights are concerned, nor shall their right to\nthe continuous improvement of living\nconditions be subject to infringement. This\napplies equally to host communities at\nresettlement sites, and affected persons,\ngroups and communities subjected to forced\neviction;\n\nxxxx\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 34 of 157\n\n57. Rehabilitation policies must include\nprogrammes designed for women and\nmarginalized and vulnerable groups to ensure\ntheir equal enjoyment of the human rights to\nhousing, food, water, health, education, work,\nsecurity of the person, security of the\nhome, freedom from cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment, and freedom of\nmovement.\n\n58. Persons, groups or communities\naffected by an eviction should not suffer\ndetriment to their human rights, including\ntheir right to the progressive realization of the\nright to adequate housing. This applies\nequally to host communities at relocation\nsites.\"\n\n(Emphasis` supplied)\n\n32. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and\n\nCultural Rights in May, 2008, in its Concluding\n\nObservations on India, called upon the Indian government\n\nparticularly to address the issue of rising homelessness,\n\nincluding the need for disaggregated data on the homeless. In\n\nthe observations relating to India as a state party, it specifically\n\nstated as follows:-\n\n\"30. The Committee is concerned about the lack of\na national housing policy, which particularly addresses\nthe needs of the disadvantaged and marginalized\nindividuals and groups, including those living in slums\nwho are reportedly growing in numbers, by providing\nthem with low-cost housing units. The Committee also\nregrets that sufficient information was not provided by\nthe State party on the extent and causes of\nhomelessness in the State party.\n\nThe Committee also requests the State party to\nprovide, in its next periodic report, detailed information\non homelessness in the State party and the extent of\ninadequate housing, disaggregated by, inter alia, sex,\ncaste, ethnicity and religion.\n\n70. The Committee urges the State party to address\nthe acute shortage of affordable housing by adopting a\nnational strategy and a plan of action on adequate\nhousing and building or providing low-cost rental\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 35 of 157\n\nhousing units, especially for the disadvantaged and low\nincome groups, including those living in slums. In this\nconnection, the Committee reminds the State party\nof its obligations under\nArticle 11\nof the Covenant\nand refers to its General Comment No. 4 on the\nright to adequate housing (1991) to guide the\nGovernment's housing policies. The Committee\nalso requests the State party to provide, in its next\nperiodic report, detailed information on\nhomelessness in the State party and the extent of\ninadequate housing, disaggregated by, inter alia,\nsex, caste, ethnicity and religion.\n\n71. The Committee recommends that the State\nparty take immediate measures to effectively\nenforce laws and regulations prohibiting\ndisplacement and forced evictions, and ensure\nthat persons evicted from their homes and lands\nbe provided with adequate compensation and / or\noffered alternative accommodation, in accordance\nwith the guidelines adopted by the Committee in its\nGeneral Comment No. 7 on forced evictions (1997). The\nCommittee also recommends that, prior to\nimplementing development and urban renewal\nprojects, sporting events and other similar activities,\nthe State party should undertake open, participatory\nand meaningful consultations with affected residents\nand communities. In this connection, the Committee\ndraws the attention of the State party to its General\nComment No. 4 on the right to adequate housing\n(1991) and further requests the State party to provide\ninformation in its next periodic report on progress\nachieved in this regard, including disaggregated\nstatistics relating to forced evictions.\"\n\n33. The above narration would show that the international\n\ncovenants and instruments refer to basic human rights. All of\n\nthem have recognized right to shelter as a basic human right,\n\nessential for survival. It needs no elaboration that the concept\n\nof human rights emanates from the ancient doctrine of natural\n\nrights based on natural law. The experiences of the Post-\n\nSecond World War which brought forth the International\n\nCharters and Conventions leading to the emergence of the\n\npresent day human rights. The first documented use of the\n\nexpression „human rights‟ is to be found in the Charter of the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 36 of 157\n\nUnited Nations, adopted on 25th June, 1945. This Charter was of\n\ncourse not binding but stated that it was only an ideal to be\n\nlater developed. By adopting the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights in December, 1948 the UN General Assembly\n\ntook the concrete step of formalising the various human rights.\n\nThis was followed by the International Bill of Rights. The\n\ndeficiency in the binding nature of the declaration was removed\n\nby the U.N. General Assembly by adopting on 16th December,\n\n1966, firstly, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which\n\nformulated legally enforceable rights of the individual and,\n\nsecondly, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n\nwhich was addressed to the states to implement them by\n\nlegislation. These covenants came into force in December, 1976\n\nafter ratification by the requisite number of member states.\n\nIndia is a party to both these covenants which were\n\nadopted on 16th December, 1966 and bind this country.\n\n34. The above narration shows that homelessness may result\n\nfrom several causes including natural disasters; development\n\nprojects, economic deprivation as well as human rights\n\nviolations. International law terms persons who stand displaced\n\nfrom their countries as \"refugees\" and recognizes that they are\n\nentitled to protection from being returned to places where their\n\nlives or freedom could be threatened.\n\n35. At the same time there are growing instances\n\ninternationally of persons and even communities who are\n\ncompelled to abandon homes on account of threat of imminent\n\nviolence or stand forcibly evicted by use of violence and\n\ncompelled to relocate to other places even within their own\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 37 of 157\n\ncountry. They cannot return to their homes within the\n\nboundaries of their own countries in the face of the continuing\n\nthreat of persecution and danger to their properties. Such\n\npersons cannot be termed as \"refugees\" as described by learned\n\ncounsels for the petitioners. In international parlance, persons\n\ncompelled to relocate within the boundaries of their own\n\ncountries stand categorised as \"Internally Displaced\n\nPersons\" (abbreviated as „IDP‟s hereafter).\n\n36. The present petitioners along with several other families,\n\nhave been compelled to relocate within India and would\n\ntherefore fall under the category of such internally displaced\n\npersons ('IDPs') who have received either insufficient or no\n\nprotection by the State, from or during their persecution.\n\n37. Except that IDPs are forced to flee from their homes to\n\nanother location with their own country, refugees and IDPs\n\nappear to be similarly situated. However, international\n\ncovenants respect the principle of non-interference with the\n\ninternal politics of one country, and consequently there exist no\n\ninternational conventions relating to IDPs.\n\n38. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has\n\nrecognised that the IDPs also face the same problems as\n\ninternational refugees and require to be treated with dignity by\n\ntheir own governments with full respect given to their basic\n\nhuman rights.\n\n39. In this regard, a guiding document has been framed by\n\nFrancis Denge, the representative of the Secretary General of\n\nthe United Nations on Internal Displaced Persons, in 1998\n\nwhich is titled as \"Guiding Principles on Internal\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 38 of 157\n\nDisplacement\" which was presented to the UNCHR. The\n\nCommission in a unanimously adopted resolution took note of\n\nthese principles which address the specific needs of internally\n\ndisplaced persons worldwide and identify rights and guarantees\n\nrelevant to the protection of persons from forced displacement\n\nand to their protection and assistance during displacement as\n\nwell as during return or resettlement and reintegration. The\n\nintroduction to these Guidelines defines \"Internally Displaced\n\nPersons\" („IDP‟s) in Clause 2 as follows :-\n\n\"2. For the purposes of these principles, internally\ndisplaced persons are persons or groups of persons who\nhave been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their\nhomes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a\nresult of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict,\nsituations of generalized violence, violations of human\nrights or natural or human made disasters, and who have\nnot crossed an internationally recognized State border.\"\n\n40. So far as housing of IDPs is concerned, these guidelines\n\ncontain the following important provisions :-\n\n\"Principle 3\n\n1.National authorities have the primary duty and\nresponsibility to provide protection and humanitarian\nassistance to internally displaced persons within their\njurisdiction.\n\n2.Internally displaced persons have the right to\nrequest and to receive protection and humanitarian\nassistance from these authorities. They shall not be\npersecuted or punished for making such a request.\n\nxxx\n\nPrinciple 7\nPrior to any decision requiring the displacement of\npersons, the authorities concerned shall ensure that\nall feasible alternatives are explored in order to avoid\ndisplacement altogether.

When recovery of\nsuch property and possessions is not possible,\ncompetent authorities shall provide or assist\nthese persons in obtaining appropriate\ncompensation or another form of just\nreparation.\"\n\n41. The United Nations Charter thus establishes the\n\nobligation upon member nations to promote the key human\n\nrights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 though\n\nnot a treaty, but is a declaration published by the General\n\nAssembly of the United Nations and is the primary document\n\nwhich is concerned with the listing of the rights. It affirmatively\n\nlays down the common standards of achievement for all peoples\n\nand all nations. It consequently has an effect which is similar to\n\na treaty. Further every nation who is a signatory to the\n\naforenoticed International Covenant on Economic, Social and\n\nCultural Rights ('ICESR') must refrain from acts which would\n\ndefeat the object and purpose of the covenant. The preamble to\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 42 of 157\n\nthe ICESCR establishes that \"the ideal of free human beings\n\nenjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if\n\nconditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his\n\neconomic, social and cultural rights as well as his civil and\n\npolitical rights\".\n\nArticle 11\nof this covenant emphasises that the state\n\nparties recognises the right of every person to an adequate\n\nstandard of living which include adequate housing and\n\ncontinued improvement of living conditions. The right for\n\npeople to be free from want is the very foundation of the\n\nICESCR.\n\n42. The international human rights law thus establishes a\n\nlegal obligation for ensuring minimum welfare guarantees. The\n\nconventions, treaties and declarations as well as the guiding\n\nprinciples manifest the international consensus that every\n\nnation has a duty to ensure and provide these guarantees\n\nincluding, inter alia shelter and basic general assistance to\n\nevery person on its soils.\n\n43. The aforenoticed international conventions which exist\n\nas well as the Guideline Principles for IDPs therefore\n\nrecognize that shelter and housing is a basic human right of\n\nevery individual which is the bare minimum to be provided to\n\ninternally displaced persons.\n\nThese Principles also emphasise all rights of displaced\n\npersons and caste a mandate on the national authorities\n\nconcerned of their primary duty and responsibility to provide\n\nprotection and humanitarian assistance to internally displaced\n\npersons within their jurisdiction which includes their right to\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 43 of 157\n\nsafety as well as protection against forcible return and\n\nresettlement in a place where their life, safety, liberty and or\n\nhealth would be ensured. The Guiding Principles have been\n\nevolved after an elaborate consultative process.\n\n44. Before proceeding any further, it is necessary to examine\n\nthe bindingness of the above principles on the courts in India.\n\nThe extent, manner and applicability of International\n\nConventions and treaties in interpretation and expansion of\n\nrights, have been authoritatively considered and are well settled\n\nby a catena of binding precedents of the Supreme Court.\nIn the\n\nauthoritative pronouncement reported at\nJT2008(7)SC11,\n\n2008(9)SCALE69 Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. Vs.\n\nSuper Cassette Industries Ltd.\nthe Supreme Court traced\n\nthe evolution of the jurisprudence on the issue under\n\nconsideration in paras 48 to 54 which may usefully be extracted\n\nand read as follows:-\n\n\"48. Beginning from the decision of this Court in\nKesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\nMANU/SC/0445/1973 : AIR 1973 SC 1461, there is\nindeed no dearth of case laws where this Court has\napplied the norms of international laws and in particular\nthe international covenants to interpret domestic\nlegislation. In all these cases, this Court has\ncategorically held that there would be no inconsistency\nin the use of international norms to the domestic\nlegislation, if by reason thereof the tenor of domestic law\nis not breached and in case of any such inconsistency,\nthe domestic legislation should prevail.\n\nIn Jagdish Saran and Ors. v. Union of India\nMANU/SC/0067/1980 : (1980) 2 SCR 831, it was\nobserved:\n\n\"It is also well-settled that\ninterpretation of the Constitution of\nIndia or statutes would change from\ntime to time. Being a living organ, it\nis ongoing and with the passage of\ntime, law must change. New rights\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 44 of 157\n\nmay have to be found out within the\nconstitutional scheme. Horizons of\nconstitutional law are expanding.\"\n\n49. In the aforementioned judgment, this\nCourt referred to a large number of decisions for the\npurpose of treaties and conventions. Yet again in\nIndian Handicrafts Emporium and Ors. v. Union of\nIndia MANU/SC/0640/2003 : AIR 2003 SC 3240, this\nCourt considered the Convention on International\nTrade in Endangered Species (CITIES) and applied the\nprinciples of purposive constructions as also not only\nthe Directive Principles as contained in Part IV of the\nConstitution but also Fundamental Duties as contained\nin Part IVA thereof. Referring to Motor General\nTraders and Anr. v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors.\nMANU/SC/0293/1983 : (1986) 1 SCR 594, Rattan Arya\nand Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr.\n\nMANU/SC/0550/1986 : (1986) 2 SCR 596 and\nSynthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and Ors. v. State of U.P.\nAnd Ors. MANU/SC/0595/1989 : AIR 1990 SC 1927,\nthis Court held:\n\n\"There cannot be any doubt\nwhatsoever that a law which was at one\npoint of time was constitutional may be\nrendered unconstitutional because of\npassage of time. We may note that apart\nfrom the decisions cited by Mr. Sanghi,\nrecently a similar view has been taken in\n\nKapila Hingorani v. State of Bihar\n\n(supra) and John Vallamattom and Anr.\n\nv. Union of India (supra).\"\n\n50. These judgments were referred to in the\ndecision of Liverpool and London S.P. and I Asson.\nLtd.\nv. M.V. Sea Success I and Anr. MANU/SC/0951/2003\n:\n\n(2004) 9 SCC 512, wherein this Court observed that as\nno statutory law in India operated in the field,\ninterpretative changes, if any, must, thus be\nmade having regard to the ever changing global\nscenario. Liverpool also referred for the proposition\nthat the changing global scenario should be kept\nin mind having regard to the fact that there does\nnot exist any primary act touching the subject\nand in absence of any domestic legislation to the\ncontrary. Concurring with the said decisions, it\nwas however opined that the same could not\nmean that it restricted the jurisdiction of the\nIndian High Courts to interpret the domestic\nlegislation strictly according to the judge made\nlaw.\n\n51. Liverpool and London S.P. and I Asson.\nLtd.\n\n(supra) has been followed by the Supreme Court in a\nplethora of cases inter alia\nThe State of West Bengal\nv. Kesoram Industries Ltd. & Ors\n.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 45 of 157\n\nMANU/SC/0038/2004 : (2004) 2 66 ITR 721(SC).\nIn\n\nPratap Singh v. State of Jharkhand and Anr\n.\n\nMANU/SC/0075/2005 : 2005 CriLJ 3091 wherein this\nCourt directed to interpret the\nJuvenile Justice Act\nin\nlight of the Constitutional as well as International Law\noperating in the field. (See also\nCentrotrade Minerals\nand Metal Inc. v. Hindustan Copper Limited\nMANU/SC/8146/2006\n: (2006) 11 SCC 245 : State of\nPunjab;\nState of Punjab and Anr. v. Devans Modern\nBrewaries Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/0961/2003\n: (2004)\n11 SCC 26 and Anuj Garg and Ors. v. Hotel\nAssociation of India and Ors. MANU/SC/8173/2007 :\n\nAIR 2008 SC 663.\n\n52. However, applicability of the International\nConventions and Covenants, as also the resolutions,\netc. for the purpose of interpreting domestic statute\nwill depend upon the acceptability of the Conventions\nin question. If the country is a signatory thereto\nsubject of course to the provisions of the domestic law,\nthe International Covenants can be utilized. Where\nInternational Conventions are framed upon\nundertaking a great deal of exercise upon giving an\nopportunity of hearing to both the parties and filtered\nat several levels as also upon taking into consideration\nthe different societal conditions in different countries\nby laying down the minimum norm, as for example, the\nILO Conventions, the couirt would freely avail the\nbenefits thereof. Those Conventions to which India\nmay not be a signatory but have been followed by way\nof enactment of new Parliamentary statute or\namendment to the existing enactment, recourse to\nInternational Convention is permissible.\n\n53. This kind of stance is reflected from the\ndecisions in PUCL v. Union of India\nMANU/SC/0274/1997 : AIR 1997 SC 1203, John\nVallamattom v. Union of India MANU/SC/0480/2003 :\n\nAIR 2003 SC 2902, Madhu Kishwar v. State of Bihar\nMANU/SC/0468/1996 : AIR 1996 SC 1864, Kubic\nDarusz v.

With regard to the application of International\n\nconventions and treaties in India, the Supreme Court laid the\n\nfollowing principles in para 47 of the judgment :-\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 46 of 157\n\n\"In interpreting the domestic/municipal laws,\nthis court has extensively made use of International\nlaw inter alia for the following purposes :\n\n(i) As a means of interpretation;\n\n(ii) Justification or fortification of a stance\ntaken;\n\n(iii) To fulfill spirit of international obligation\nwhich India has entered into, when they\nare not in conflict with the existing\ndomestic law;\n\n(iv) To reflect international changes and reflect\nthe wider civilization;\n\n(v) To provide a relief contained in a covenant,\nbut not in a national law;\n\n(vi) To fill gaps in law.\"\n\n46. In AIR 1997 SC 3011 Vishaka and others Vs. State of\n\nRajasthan and Others, the court was concerned with a writ\n\npetition filed for preservation and enforcement of the right to\n\ngender equality and fundamental rights of working women\n\nunder\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nof the Constitution of India,\n\nSection 2\nof Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 and the\n\nentitlements of working women under the Convention on\n\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.\n\nThere was no specific domestic legislation on the subject. With\n\nregard to the importance and applicability of international\n\nconventions and treaties, the court held as follows -\n\n\"7. In the absence of domestic law occupying the\nfield, to formulate effective measures to check the evil\nof sexual harassment of working women at all work\nplaces, the contents of International Conventions and\nnorms are significant for the purpose of interpretation\nof the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with\nhuman dignity in\nArticles 14\n, 15\n, 19(1)(g)\nand\nof the\nConstitution and the safeguards against sexual\nharassment implicit therein. Any International\nConvention not inconsistent with the fundamental\nrights and in harmony with its spirit must be read into\nthese provisions to enlarge the meaning and content\nthereof, to promote the object of the constitutional\nguarantee. This is implicit from\nArticle 51(c)\nand the\nenabling power of the Parliament to enact laws for\nimplementing the International Conventions and\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 47 of 157\n\nnorms by virtue of\nArticle 253\nread with Entry 14 of\nthe Union List in Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nArticle 73\nalso is relevant. It provides that the\nexecutive power of the Union shall extend to the\nmatters with respect to which Parliament has power to\nmake laws. The executive power of the Union is,\ntherefore, available till the Parliament enacts\nlegislation to expressly provide measures needed to\ncurb the evil.\"\n\n47.\nIn (\n1999) 1 SCC 759 Apparel Export Promotion\n\nCouncil vs. A.K. Chopra\n, also the Supreme Court was dealing\n\nwith the case of sexual harassment at the place of work which\n\nvitiated the working environment and observed that the\n\ninternational instruments cast an obligation on the Indian State\n\nto gender sensitise its laws and that the courts are under an\n\nobligation to see that the message of the international\n\ninstruments is not allowed to be drowned. The Supreme Court\n\nagain emphasised that the courts must never forget the core\n\nprinciples embodied in International Conventions and\n\nInstruments and reiterated the above principles.\n\n48.\nIn (\n2003) 6 SCC 1 Kapila Hingorani Vs. State of\n\nBihar\n, the Apex court stressed on the importance of respecting\n\nInternational Treaties and Conventions while interpreting the\n\nConstitution and domestic law so as to effectuate the recognised\n\nrights and observed as follows-\n\n\"47. It is also well-settled that a statute should be\ninterpreted in the light of the International Treaties and\nConventions.\nIn\nChairman, Railway Board and\nOrs. v. Mrs. Chandrima Das and\nOrs. MANU/SC/0046/2000\n: 2000CriLJ1473 this Court\nstated the law thus:-\n\n\"24. The International Covenants and\nDeclarations as adopted by the United Nations\nhave to be respected by all signatory States\nand the meaning given to the above words in\nthose Declarations and Covenants have to be\nsuch as would help in effective\nimplementation of those rights. The\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 48 of 157\n\napplicability of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights and the principles\nthereof may have to be read, if need be,\ninto the domestic jurisprudence.\"\n\n49. As noticed above, right to residence and to settle in any\n\npart of the country is assured to every citizen as a fundamental\n\nright under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nof the Constitution of India. (Ref :\n\n1997 (\n11) SCC 121 Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation vs.\n\nNawab Khan Gulab Khan & Ors.\n) The right to shelter springs\n\nfrom this right and has been considered to be an integral part\n\nfor a meaningful enjoyment of right to life under\nArticle 21\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. (Ref.: 1995 Suppl.\n3 SCC 456 : AIR\n\n1996 SC 114 U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad & Anr. Vs.\n\nFriends Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. & Anr.)\n\n50. In the instant case also there is no specific domestic\n\nlegislation at all for internally displaced persons. As noticed\n\nhereinabove, there are also no International Conventions\n\ngoverning rights of such persons. It is now an accepted rule of\n\njudicial construction that regard must be had to international\n\nconventions, norms and guiding principles for construing\n\ndomestic law when there is no inconsistency between them and\n\nthere is a void in the domestic law.\n\n51. It is noteworthy that there is no specific law, rule,\n\nregulation or instrument providing for treatment of IDPs or\n\nsetting out any minimum standards for their protection,\n\nrehabilitation and relocation. The Guiding Principles on\n\nInternal Displacement reiterate the very right to shelter\n\nconstitutionally guaranteed and recognized as a basic human\n\nright in the international instruments. These Guidelines thus\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 49 of 157\n\nconsolidate and fill gaps in national and international law\n\nrelating to such displaced persons. They also provide a\n\nvaluable benchmark for what must be ensured as part of the\n\nbasic human rights security of such persons and would guide\n\nconsideration of the rights of the present petitioners.\n\n52. It has been observed by the Supreme Court in (\n2003) 6\n\nSCC 1 Kapila Hingorani Vs. State of Bihar\nthat\n\nindisputably, the state parties to the International Covenant on\n\nEconomic, Social & Cultural Rights were to take appropriate\n\nsteps to ensure realisation of this thought. So far as the present\n\ncase is concerned, this covenant specifically states the right of\n\neveryone to an adequate standard of living including housing.\n\n53. The rules laid down and right recognised in the\n\naforenoticed conventions as well as the Guiding Principles\n\nwould bind the present adjudication also in the light of the\n\nfollowing principle\nlaid down in\n\nEntertainment Network\n\n(supra) :-\n\n\"54 Furthermore, as regards the question where\nthe protection of human rights, environment, ecology\nand other second generation or third-generation\nrights is involved, the courts should not be loathe to\nrefer to the International Conventions.\"\n\n54. The petitioners are members of the larger group from\n\ntheir community which stands forcibly evicted from one part of\n\nthe country rendering them homeless and resourceless. They\n\nare without resources at the place of their relocation and are\n\nfaced with the threat of forcible eviction from their\n\naccommodation. By way of these writ petitions, the petitioners\n\nseek protection and enforcement of their fundamental right to\n\nlife which includes shelter. The international conventions\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 50 of 157\n\nrecognise shelter as a basic human right. The Guiding\n\nPrinciples reiterate the same rights and responsibilities of the\n\nstate so far as IDPs are concerned. Consideration of the\n\npetitioners‟ rights, therefore, would necessarily involve ensuring\n\nthe objectives and declarations made in the above international\n\ninstruments especially those endorsed by India reiterated by the\n\nGuiding Principles for IDPs.\n\nThe Protection of Human Rights Act\n, 1993\n\n55. The issue in the instant case has another dimension to it\n\nwhich is of importance. In discharge of the obligation under\n\nthe international covenants, India promulgated an ordinance\n\nappointing commissions and courts for the protection of human\n\nrights. This ordinance was replaced by the\nProtection of\n\nHuman Rights Act, 1993\nwas promulgated on 8th January,\n\n1994 to provide for the constitution of the national and state\n\nhuman rights commissions and human rights courts for better\n\nprotection and for matters connected therewith or incidental\n\nthereto. „Human rights‟ are defined in clause (d) of sub-section\n\n(1) of\nSection 2\nas the „rights relating to life, liberty, equality\n\nand dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or\n\nembodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by\n\ncourts in India‟.\n\nThe expression „international covenants‟ is also defined to\n\ninclude the two covenants adopted by the General Assembly on\n\n16th December, 1966 and such other covenants and conventions\n\nadopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations as the\n\nCentral Government may specify by notification. The\n\nenforceability of the several rights recognised under the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 51 of 157\n\nInternational Covenants, therefore, stands recognized by this\n\nlegislation in India. The said Act was made by the Parliament\n\nhaving regard to the changing social realities and growing\n\nconcern in India about issues relating to human rights with a\n\nview of bringing about greater accountability and transparency\n\nin enforcement of the laws of the nation.\n\n56. It is essential to note that in fact no new right is being\n\ncreated, recognized or reiterated by the international\n\ninstruments or the said guidelines. The right to shelter of every\n\nperson has been recognized as an essential concomitant of right\n\nto life under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. It would\n\nclearly be covered under the definition of a „human right‟ under\n\nSection 2(1)(d)\nof the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993\n\nwhich includes right relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity.\n\nThe right to shelter, an essential part of right to life, would\n\ntherefore also be a statutorily recognized right under\nSection\n\n2(1)(d)\nof the Act of 1993 and enforceable as such also.\n\nThe present petitioners, as persons displaced from their\n\nhomes and state, by way of these writ petitions are thus,\n\nseeking enforcement of such right to shelter.\n\n57. The above discussion would show that state courts are\n\nbound to use international human rights covenants, which also\n\nstand incorporated into the\nProtection of Human Rights Act,\n, as a pillar of support for the rights recognised thereby\n\nand to ensure the requisite assistance as well as access to\n\nshelter as a positive right so that the bare minimum for those in\n\nneed is enabled. The petitioners assert such rights in the\n\nchallenge laid in these writ petitions.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 52 of 157\n\nQ Whether the statutory provisions of\nPublic Premises\n\n(Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\nwhich\n\nwould have the effect of defeating the constitutional\n\nrights of the petitioners, could be validly invoked against\n\nthem?\n\n58. On behalf of the respondents, it is urged that the\n\nallotment of the quarters to the petitioners (or their\n\npredecessors) stands cancelled. They are therefore in\n\nunauthorised occupation of the Government accommodation and\n\ntherefore liable to be evicted under the provisions of the\nPublic\n\nPremises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n. The\n\nsubmission is that the proceedings taken by the respondents\n\nand the orders passed against the petitioners were justified and\n\nare in accordance with law.\n\n59. On the other hand, the petitioners have urged that even in\n\ntheir wildest dreams, they had never envisaged a situation when\n\nthey would not be in a position to reside in their own homes\n\nafter retirement. On account of grave threats to their safety,\n\nthe petitioners have been prevented from returning to their\n\nhomes. The petitioners are not residing in Delhi on account of a\n\ndesire not to return to the valley or to perpetuate residence in\n\nDelhi, but for reasons totally beyond control of these petitioners.\n\nThe writ petitioners have stated that their homes in Kashmir\n\nhave either been destroyed or rendered inaccessible to them\n\nprimarily on account of the inability of the respondents to\n\nprotect the same. They do not have adequate means to acquire\n\nany property in Delhi. It is the petitioners contention that the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 53 of 157\n\npension admissible to them does not enable them to afford\n\nrented accommodation or acquire their own houses. The\n\npetitioners have submitted that the respondents have permitted\n\nsimilarly situated persons to continue in the allotted\n\naccommodation. Reliance is also placed on orders of the\n\nSupreme Court, this Court and the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal also prohibiting eviction of similarly placed persons\n\nfrom allotted accommodation.\n\nIn this background, the petitioners assail also the failure\n\nto consider their requests to the respondents to exercise\n\ndiscretion vested in them under the Allotment of Government\n\nResidences (General Pool in Delhi) Rules, 1963 to permit the\n\npetitioners to continue to occupy the allotted premises. It is\n\nurged that this refusal was discriminatory, arbitrary and has\n\nfailed to consider the relevant circumstances.\n\n60. It is contended by the petitioners that in these facts, they\n\nare not in unauthorized occupation of the quarters and that the\n\nrespondents could not have taken recourse to proceedings\n\nunder the Public Premises Act, 1971 which would have the\n\neffect of ousting them and their families from their only\n\nresidence without taking steps of making provision of\n\nreasonable alternatives. The contention is that the entire\n\naction taken by the respondents and implementation of the\n\nthreat of forcible eviction would result in violation of the\n\nfundamental and basic human rights of the petitioners and,\n\ntherefore, is unconstitutional, without jurisdiction and\n\ncompletely illegal.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 54 of 157\n\nBinding judicial precedents\n\n61. So far as the conditions which were in existence in the\n\nstate of Jammu & Kashmir, the restoration of normalcy and the\n\ncircumstances in which they are occupying these quarters are\n\nconcerned, reliance has been placed by the petitioners on the\n\nproceedings and orders passed in several similar cases prior\n\nhitherto which have been completely ignored by the\n\nrespondents. Attention is drawn to the orders of the Supreme\n\nCourt of India in SLP (C) No.7639/1999 Shri J.L. Koul &\n\nAnr. Vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors. Shri J.L. Koul &\n\nthe other petitioners in this case were Kashmiri pandits who\n\nwere employees of the State Government and being State\n\nGovernment servants, had been allotted residential\n\naccommodations in Jammu between 1989-90. Their houses in\n\nthe valley were either destroyed or burnt down by militants.\n\nEven though they had retired from service, these petitioners\n\nwere permitted to retain the government accommodations in\n\nJammu for safety reasons. Such a step was considered\n\nnecessary and inevitable by the State Government as the\n\natmosphere was not congenial for the appellants to return to the\n\nvalley, more so when they had lost their respective houses.\n\n62. It appears that other state government employees\n\nawaiting allotment of official accommodation, could not get the\n\nsame for the reason that these retired persons continued to\n\noccupy the official accommodation. They filed a writ petition\n\nbefore the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir complaining\n\nagainst the failure of the State Government to provide them\n\nwith official accommodation. A learned Single Judge of the High\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 55 of 157\n\nCourt of Jammu & Kashmir had allowed the writ petition and\n\npassed a judgment on 24th January, 1997 directing eviction of all\n\nthose persons who had ceased to be government servants for\n\nany reason but were still occupying the state accommodation.\n\nThe learned Single Judge had also directed that the persons who\n\nwere not in government service but required Government\n\naccommodation because of security reasons, should be tried to\n\nbe accommodated within one complex so that their security is\n\nensured, reducing the burden on the state which would have to\n\nincur lesser amount for their security.\n\n63. For the reason that the state government was attempting\n\nto evict these occupants without providing them with alternative\n\naccommodations, a challenge was laid to the judgment of the\n\nSingle Judge dated the 24th of January, 1997 by a letters patent\n\nappeal. This appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench by a\n\njudgment dated 14th March, 1997, however, giving an\n\nopportunity to the appellants to approach the appropriate\n\nauthority for relief. In this background, these persons led by\n\nShri J.L. Koul, filed the above special leave petition before the\n\nSupreme Court. On a consideration of the matter, an interim\n\norder order dated 11th April, 1997 was passed by the court\n\ndirecting the state government to maintain status quo regarding\n\nthe possession of the property.\n\n64. Mr. R.K. Handoo, learned counsel for the petitioners has\n\nreferred to certain orders passed by the Supreme Court of India\n\nin the said petition. On 26th August, 1997, the Supreme Court\n\nhad required counsel representing the State of Jammu &\n\nKashmir to ascertain from the State Government as to whether\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 56 of 157\n\nthe petitioners can be put back in to the houses owned by them\n\nin the Kashmir Valley and to ensure protection of their persons\n\nas also their properties.\n\n65. The case was thereafter taken up by the Supreme Court\n\non 28th January, 1998 when the Supreme Court took notice of\n\nthe massacre of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley which\n\nhad taken place a few days prior to the hearing and recorded\n\nthe following order :-\n\n\"This order is being made in the backdrop of a\nmassacre of Kashmiri Pandits which took place a\ncouple of days ago in the Kashmir valley.\nAdjourned sine die. Stay to continue. The petition to\nbe activated on mentioning by counsel for the State of\nJammu and Kashmir as and when the State is in a\nposition to assure return of the petitioners to their\nrespective homes in the Kashmir valley and ensure\ntheir safety and personal property.\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\n66. It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court had also passed\n\nan order on 3rd December, 2008 (in Shri J.L. Koul & Others\n\nvs. State of J&K aforenoticed) directing the respondent-state\n\nto frame a rehabilitation scheme within a period of six months\n\nand to place the same before the court. For the reason that no\n\nmaterial or scheme was placed before it by the respondents, on\n\n17th September, 2009, the Supreme Court directed the Chief\n\nSecretary of the State to file a personal affidavit as to what\n\nsteps had been taken pursuant to the orders of the court.\n\n67. An affidavit dated 6th October, 2009 was thereafter filed\n\nby the Chief Secretary in the case. The appeal was disposed of\n\nby a final judgment on 27th October, 2009 which stands reported\n\nat 2009 (\n1) AD SC 253 J.L. Koul & Others Vs. State of\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n. So far as rehabilitation of the Kashmiri\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 57 of 157\n\nmigrants is concerned, the affidavit dated 6th October, 2009 has\n\nbeen considered in para 7 of the judgment in the following\n\nterms:-\n\n\"7. In pursuance of the said order, the Chief Secretary\nhas filed the affidavit dated 6.10.2009. In the said\naffidavit it has been disclosed that out of 54 appellants\n23 had already handed over the Government\naccommodation to the State Department and the same\nhad been allotted to the Government employees. Only\n31 migrants/retirees are presently in occupation of the\nGovernment accommodation. It has further been\nclarified that there are 37,280 families who have been\nregistered for the relief including the accommodation\nand out of them only 5,000 families could be provided\nthe accommodation in the camps. However, it had been\nundertaken that the Government would provide such\nfacilities to all Kashmiri migrants till they are residing at\nthe present places. The relevant part of the affidavit\nreads as under:-\n\n\"5. That it is further submitted that Govt.\nformulated a package for return and rehabilitation\nof Kashmiri Migrants which involves an outlay of\nRs.1618.40 crores. This is for the first time since\n1990, that Govt. of India has come up with a\npolicy for Return and Rehabilitation of\nKashmiri Migrants. The policy has been framed\non the recommendations of a working group\nconstituted by Govt. of India to suggest various\nconfidence building measures in the J&K State.\nWhile framing the policy various needs of the\nmigrants have been taken into consideration, such\nas housing, education, revival of Agriculture and\nHorticulture land, employment etc. The details of\nthe package announced on 5th June 2008 are\nreproduced as under:-\n\ni) Return and Rehabilitation Package of\nKashmiri Migrants: The total package involves an\noutlay of Rs.1618.40 crore. The main\ncomponents of the package are as under: (a)\nHousing\n\ni) Assistance @ Rs.7.5 lac for fully or partially\ndamaged house left behind by migrant.\n\n(ii) Rs.2.00 lac for dilapidated/unused houses.\n\n(iii) Rs.7.5. lac for purchase/construction of a\nhouse in Group Housing Societies for those who\nhave sold their properties during the period after\n1989 and before the enactment of \"The J&K\nMigrant Immovable Property (Preservation,\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 58 of 157\n\nProtection and Restraint of Distress Sale) Act,\n1997\" on 30.5.1997.\n\n(b) Transit Accommodation : Construction of\ntransit accommodation at three sites @ Rs.20.00\ncrore each for total Rs.60.00 crore. Alternatively,\nRs.1.00 lac per family towards rental and\nincidental expenses to those families who may not\nbe accommodated in transit accommodation.\n\n(c) Continuation of Cash Relief to Migrants:\n\nMigrants families at Jammu and Delhi who are\nrecipients of cash relief and free ration would\ncontinue to receive the same @ Rs.5000 per family\nper month (including rations) for a period of two\nyears after their return to the valley.\n\n7. That it may be further submitted that\nunemployed youth were asked to convey their\nwillingness for serving in Kashmir Valley. In\nresponse to the same, 14074 unemployed youth\nhave expressed their willingness in writing for\nserving in Kashmir valley.\n\n8. That it is further submitted that a form called\n\"EXPRESSION OF INTEREST\" was circulated\namong the migrants in order to ascertain their\nwillingness to return to valley and so far 1676\nfamilies have expressed their willingness to return\nto valley and avail the concession available under\nthe package.\n\n9. That it is further submitted that land at the\nfollowing three sites have already been identified\nfor construction of transit accommodation, the\ndetails whereof are as under: a- Land at Vessu,\nDistrict Kulgam 100 Kanals. b- Land at Qazigund,\nDistrict Anantnag 25 Kanals. c- Land at Khanpura,\nDistrict Baramulla 50 Kanals\n\n10. That it may be further submitted that 200\nflats are nearing completion at Sheikhpora\nBudgam. In addition to this, 18 flats are available\nat Mattan Anantnag. These flats are to be used as\ntransit accommodation by the Kashmiri migrants\nwho wish to return to valley. The migrants shall\nstay in the transit accommodation till they re-\nconstruct or renovate their houses.\n\n11. That it may be further submitted that State\nGovernment had also constituted an Apex Advisory\nCommittee to oversee the implementation of\nReturn and Rehabilitation package for Kashmiri\nMigrants in the month of September 2009 and\nimmediately after the constitution of the Apex\nLevel 8 Committee, various suggestions were put\nforth in a meeting held on 23.9.2009.\n\n12. That it may be further submitted that the\nState Cabinet vide its decision No.130/11/2009\ndated 1.10.2009 has approved the package for\nReturn and Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Migrants to\nKashmir Valley. However, with regard to\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 59 of 157\n\nimplementation of employment scheme a\nCommittee has also been ordered to be constituted\nto go into the legal and other implications for\nmaking recruitments of the migrant youth against\nvarious posts before the said scheme is formally\nnotified. The Committee has to submit its report\nwithin a period of two weeks.\n\n13. That the State Government is keen to\nrehabilitate the Kashmiri Migrants in the Kashmir\nvalley and shall provide every type of assistance\nfor their return and rehabilitation. The process for\nthe rehabilitation in valley has been initiated in\nJune 2008 after Govt. of India announced the\npackage for their return.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Supreme Court observed that this case had remained\n\npending before it for twelve years and that the court had been\n\ninsisting upon the state to frame the scheme of rehabilitation of\n\nthe appellants and particularly for providing them\n\naccommodation. Placing reliance on the above\n\naffidavits/undertakings given by the respondents, the Court\n\nfurther observed that the authorities have framed the\n\nrehabilitation scheme and for implementation of the same, it has\n\ngot sufficient resources also. In this background, the Supreme\n\nCourt issued the following directions:-\n\n\"9. In view of the above affidavit/undertaking given\nby the State and after hearing Mrs. Purnima Bhat Kak,\nLd. Counsel for the appellants and Mr. Anis\nSuhrawardy, Ld. Counsel for the State, we dispose of\nthe appeal with a pious hope that State shall take all\nendeavours to rehabilitate the persons who have\nbeen victim of terrorism and till the State is able\nto rehabilitate and provide the appropriate\naccommodation to 31 appellants-retirees/oustees,\nthey shall continue to possess the\naccommodations which are in their respective\npossession on this date.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n68. It is noteworthy that the only difference between the\n\npetitioners before the Supreme Court and those who are before\n\nthis court is, that the petition before the Supreme Court\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 60 of 157\n\nrelated to persons who were retired employees of the State\n\nGovernment while the present petitioners are all employees of\n\nthe Central Government and its departments. However, the\n\npetitioners before the Supreme Court and the present writ\n\npetitioners are identically placed victims of the militancy and\n\nthe rights asserted by both sets of the petitioners and issues\n\nraised by them are identical.\n\n69. While the above petition remained pending in the\n\nSupreme Court, some other similarly placed employees were\n\nfacing the same threat of eviction as the present set of\n\npetitioners. Some such persons approached this court while\n\nothers filed a petition before the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal. The orders passed in these matters would also have a\n\nbearing on the present consideration.\n\n70. Reference requires to be also made to a judgment passed\n\non 2nd August, 2006 in WP (C) No.11742/2005 entitled\nP.K.\n\nHandoo Vs. Estate Officer & Anr.\nby this court which is\n\nreported at 132 (2006) DLT 672. Shri P.K. Handoo was also a\n\nKashmiri Pandit and part of the minority community in the\n\nKashmir valley. An employee with the Intelligence Bureau of\n\nthe Government of India, he had retired from the service on 31st\n\nJuly, 2004 whereafter efforts to cancel his allotment and evict\n\nhim by way of proceedings under the Public Premises Act, 1971\n\nhad been undertaken. Sh. P.K.Handoo filed the writ petition\n\nassailing this action and the eviction order dated 30th June, 2005\n\npassed against him in the proceedings by the estate officer and\n\nalso sought issuance of a writ of mandamus against the\n\nrespondents to allow him to retain the official accommodation\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 61 of 157\n\nwhich had been allotted to him till such time that the\n\nGovernment made it possible for him to return to Srinagar or till\n\nsuitable alternative accommodation is provided to him in Delhi.\n\n71. The observations made by this court in the judgment\n\ndated 2nd August, 2006 in\nP.K. Handoo\n(supra) while dealing\n\nwith the very objections urged in these proceedings, deserve to\n\nbe considered in extenso and read as follows :-\n\n\"11. The argument submitted by the learned\ncounsel for the respondents is typically gauche. It\nlacks sensitivity. Kashmir has never ceased to be a hub\nof terrorist activity which is mainly directed against the\nHindu Pandits. The violence in the State is at its peak.\nDue to the obstinacy of terrorists and helplessness of\nthe government to counter terror, the situation could\nnot improve. Indian Constitution applies to all the\ncitizens of India. Equal protection means the right to\nequal treatment in similar circumstances. There\nshould be no discrimination between one person and\nanother if as regards the subject matter of the\nlegislation their position is the same. It is settled law\nthat a judicial or quasi judicial decision cannot offend\n\nArticle 14.\n\n12.\nIn the result, I allow the writ petition in\nterms of the order passed by the Apex Court in the\ncase of\nJ.L. Koul Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir\n\n(supra). Respondents are directed to allow the\npetitioner to retain Quarter No.D-845, Mandir Marg,\nNew Delhi, pending decision in SLP © No.7369/2007,\nsubject to payment of normal licence fees or in the\nalternative the respondents may provide alternative\naccommodation to the petitioner and his family\nanywhere in Delhi till the pendency of the above said\nwrit petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. No\ncosts.\"\n\n(underlining supplied)\n\n72. Learned counsels for the petitioners have also painstakingly\n\npointed out the earlier similar directions made as back as on\n\n30th December, 2002 by the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal in OA No.2378/2002 entitled Tej Kishan Vs. Union\n\nof India & Ors. on the same issue which have also been noticed\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 62 of 157\n\nand reiterated in the\nP.K. Handoo\n(supra) judgment. It is\n\nnoteworthy that Shri Tej Kishan, a Kashmiri displaced person\n\nhad made a request for retention of Government\n\naccommodation beyond superannuation which was turned down\n\nby the Government by an order dated 13th August, 2002. This\n\nrefusal was assailed by way of proceedings before the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal. In these proceedings, the Tribunal had\n\nplaced reliance on a letter dated 2nd July, 2002 written to the\n\nDelhi Development Authority („DDA‟) by the Ministry of Urban\n\nDevelopment & Poverty Alleviation on the subject of preferential\n\nallotment of DDA flats to J&K migrant Central Government\n\nemployees who had retired or were retiring. The tribunal noted\n\nthe letter in the following terms:-\n\n\"12. By referring to the letter dated 2.7.2002 written\nto the DDA by the Ministry of Urban Development\n& Poverty Allevation, it is stated that this has been\ndecided as under:-\n\n\"......But the situation prevailing in J&K is such that\ndoes not permit the safe return of these\nretired/retiring Central Government employees who\ncan settle after retirement at their native place.\nKeeping this background in view, a decision has been\ntaken to allot about 100 MIG and LIG Flats in Dwarka\nto such retired/retiring J&K migrant Central\nGovernment employees so that the Central Pool\nAccommodation could be got vacated from them.\nDDA is, therefore, requested to formulate a housing\nscheme for retired/retiring J&K migrant Central\nGovernment employees and send a draft thereof to\nthis Ministry within a fortnight for approval.\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\n73. In the above judgment, the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal also observed on violation of\nArticle 14\nby the\n\nrespondents holding that \"the state shall not by its act\n\ndiscriminate as between two individuals who are similarly\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 63 of 157\n\ncircumstanced.\" These findings are also noticed in para 10 of\n\nthe judgment in P.K. Handoo‟s case (supra).\n\n74. I have had occasion to deal with a similar issue in a\n\njudgment dated the 11th of April, 2008 rendered in W.P.(C)\n\nNo.1065/2007 M.K. Koul Vs. Union of India & Ors. In this\n\ncase also the petitioner was a retired Kashmiri employee of the\n\nCentral Government who could not return to Kashmir for the\n\nsame reason as the petitioners. Proceedings for his eviction\n\nwere also initiated by the respondents under the\nPublic\n\nPremises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n.\n\nDuring the course of hearing on 7th April, 2008, a query was put\n\nto counsel for the respondent in this case in respect of the\n\nposition with regard to the safety and security of the Kashmiri\n\nPandits in the valley. The position was revealed to be the same\n\nas before. In para 14 of the said judgment, consequently it was\n\nrecorded that \"the respondents are not in a position to ensure\n\ntheir safety and protection and as such, in case they are\n\ndisplaced from the accommodation which they are occupying,\n\nthey will not be in a position to return to their respective homes\n\nin the Kashmir valley\".\n\nConsequently, the following directions were issued:-\n\n\"15. In this background, the respondents\ncertainly cannot be permitted to maintain the\norder of cancellation of the petitioner's\nallotment or to enforce the eviction order which\nhas been passed against the petitioner or to evict\nthe petitioners from the premises which they are\noccupying.\n\n16. There is no doubt, that the petitioner was\nmaking payment of the normal licence fee while he\nwas in service. Interest of justice and equity merit\nthat the petitioner be required to make payment of\nthe licence fee on the same basis till such time as the\nrespondents are able to ensure safety of personal\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 64 of 157\n\nproperty of the petitioner in their home State or are in\na position to provide similar alternative\naccommodation to the petitioner or the petitioner\nacquires any other residential property in Delhi.\n\n17. In view of the above discussion, this writ\npetition is allowed.\n\nThe respondents are directed to permit the\npetitioner to continue to occupy the Quarter No.N-\n299, Sector-8, R.K. Puram, New Delhi subject to\npayment of the same licence fee as was being paid by\nthe petitioner on the date when he retired. This\norder shall continue to operate till such time as the\nrespondents provide similar alternative\naccommodation to the petitioner, or the petitioner\nacquires any residential property in his name.\n\nThis writ petition is allowed in the above terms.\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIt is noteworthy that these orders have not been assailed\n\nand have attained finality.\n\n75. It is urged by learned counsel for the respondents that\n\nfailure of the Government of India to challenge the orders\n\npassed in WP(C) No.11742/2005 entitled\nP.K.Handoo v.\n\nEstate Officer & Anr.\n; WP (C) No.1065/2007 entitled\n\nM.K.Kaul v. UOI & Ors.\nand the other cases are immaterial\n\nand would have no bearing on the instant case. Reliance is\n\nplaced on the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at\n\n(2006) II SCC 709 Col.\n\nB.J. Akkara Vs. Government of\n\nIndia & Ors.\nin support of this submission.\n\n76. It is noteworthy that Col.\nB.J. Akkara\n's case (supra)\n\nrelated to efforts of the Government to recover payment of\n\nexcess amount as pension. Certain orders stood passed in the\n\nwrit petition filed by other employees who had raised a similar\n\nchallenge. These orders had not been challenged by the\n\nGovernment. In this background, the petitioner had contended\n\nthat the Government was estopped from recovering the amount\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 65 of 157\n\nfrom him in view of those orders which had attained finality.\n\nThe Apex Court rejected the contentions and held that the\n\nUnion of India would not be barred from resisting the\n\nsubsequent writ petitions involving similar issues or challenging\n\nsubsequent judgments of the High Court realising the\n\nseriousness or magnitude of the issues or financial implications.\n\nThe position would be different only if it is established that the\n\nGovernment had adopted a pick and choose method only to\n\navoid relief to the petitioner on account of mala fide or ulterior\n\nmotives. It was held that principles of estoppel, res judicata,\n\nlegitimate expectation or fairness in action were not attracted\n\non the facts of the case.\n\nNo plea of violation of fundamental rights was involved in\n\nAkkara‟s case (supra). There can be no comparison with the\n\nfacts of\nAkkara\n's case (supra) with those of the present cases.\n\n77. The aforenoticed judgments and orders were clearly\n\nrelevant and binding upon the respondents for construing and\n\ntaking a view on the contentions and claims of the petitioners.\n\nThe respondents were also bound by the deposition and the\n\npolicy placed before the Supreme Court which resulted in its\n\njudgment dated 6th of October, 2009. The available records do\n\nnot show any consideration of the aforenoticed judgments and\n\norders so far as the rights and plight of the petitioners are\n\nconcerned.\n\nCancellation of allotments and action under the Public Premises\n\nAct, 1971\n\n78. Mr. Jatan Singh, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondent No.1 has contended that the decision to cancel the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 66 of 157\n\nallotments and to initiate the proceedings under the Public\n\nPremises Act, 1971 as well as the orders of the Estate Officer\n\nand the judgments of the Appellate Court are in terms of\n\nstatutory provisions cannot be assailed by way of these writ\n\npetitions.\n\nReliance is placed on the pronouncements of this court\n\nreported at (1995) II AD Delhi 293 Union of India Vs. S.M.\n\nAggarwal & 31 others; 2000 (55) DRJ 57 Bhim Singh Vs.\n\nUnion of India & Anr.;\nAIR 1977 Delhi 268 Hardwari Lal\n\nVerma Vs. The Estate Officer & Ors.\nin support.\n\n79. This objection of the respondents ignores well settled first\n\nprinciples of law. Merely because the impugned action is taken\n\nand order passed in purported exercise of statutory power\n\nwould not render it immune from judicial scrutiny. The question\n\nas to manner in which such action and orders viz-a-viz their\n\neffect on fundamental rights will be examined, stands answered\n\nby the Supreme Court in AIR 1978 SC 597; (\n1978) 1 SCC 248\n\nManeka Gandhi Vs Union of India and others\n. In this case,\n\nthe court had made the following observations with regard to\n\nthe impact of action taken under provisions of the\nPassport Act\n:-\n\n\"Now, if the effect of State action on a\nfundamental right is direct and inevitable, then a\nfortiorari, it must be presumed to have been intended by\nthe authority taking the action and hence, this doctrine\nof direct and inevitable effect has been described by\nsome jurists as the doctrine of intended and real effect.\nThis is the test which must be applied for the purpose of\ndetermining whether Section 10 (3) (c ) of the impugned\norder made under it is violative of Article 19 (1)(a) or\n\n(g).\"\n\n80. The Supreme Court further ruled that it is not necessary to\n\nassail the constitutional validity of the statutory provisions\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 67 of 157\n\nunder which the impugned order is made and that the court\n\nwould still be able to examine as to whether the order made in\n\nexercise of statutory power was invalid for the reason that it\n\ncontravened a fundamental right holding as follows :-\n\n\"But that does not mean that an order made under\n\nSection 10(3)(c)\n) may not violate\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nor (g).\nWhile discussing the constitutional validity of the\nimpunged order impounding the passport of the\npetitioner, we shall have occasion to point out that even\nwhere a statutory provision empowering an authority to\ntake action is constitutionally valid, action taken under it\nmay offend a fundamental right and in that event, though\nthe statutory provision is valid, the action may be void.\n\nIt is true, and we must straightaway conceded that\nmerely because a statutory provision empowering an\nauthority to take action in specified circumstances is\nconstitutionally valid as not being in conflict with any\nfundamental rights, it does not give a carte blanche to\nthe authority to make any order it likes so long as it is\nwithin the parameters\nlaid down by\nthe provision. Every\noffer made under a statutory provision must not only be\nwithin the authority conferred by the statutory provision,\nbut must also stand the test of fundamental rights.\nParliament cannot be presumed to have intended to\nconfer power on an authority to act in contravention of\nfundamental rights. It is a basic constitutional\nassumption underlying every statutory grant of power\nthat the authority on which the power is conferred,\nshould act constitutionally and not in violation of any\nfundamental right. This would seem to be elementary\nand no authority is necessary in support of it.\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\n81. In\nthe above case\n, the Supreme Court held that even\n\nthough the impugned order was within the terms of the relevant\n\nsection, \"it must nevertheless, not contravene any fundamental\n\nrights and if it does, it would be void\".\n\nSo far as the present case is concerned, even it were to\n\nbe held that the action taken by the respondents was\n\npermissible under the statutory provisions, but if it violated or\n\nadversely impacted fundamental rights of the petitioners, it\n\nwould have to be voided. This objection to the maintainability of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 68 of 157\n\nthe present writ petitions is therefore misconceived and is\n\nrejected.\n\n82. An examination of the order of cancellation of the\n\nallotment requires to be undertaken. The only rules relied upon\n\nin support of the power to permit occupancy of the quarters are\n\nthe Allotment of Government Residences (General Pool in\n\nDelhi) Rules, 1963. Cancellation of the allotment has been\n\neffected under these very rules.\n\n83. The respondents have permitted the petitioners to occupy\n\nthe same in exercise of power conferred on them. It is not the\n\nrespondents' case that the petitioners came into possession of\n\nthe quarters illegally or without authority. The occupancy is\n\nbeing treated as unauthorised by the respondents for the\n\nreason that they have cancelled the allotments.\n\n84. In view of this stand of the respondents, it becomes\n\nnecessary to examine the provisions of the Public Premises Act,\n\n1971.\n\n85. For the purposes of the instant case, the expression\n\n\"unauthorized occupation\" as defined under\nsection 2(g)\nof the\n\nPublic Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)\n\nAct, 1971 has to be construed.\n\nSection 2(g)\nof the said statute reads as follows :-\n\n\"2(g) \"unauthorised occupation\", in relation to\nany public premises, means the occupation by any\nperson of the public premises without authority for\nsuch occupation, and includes the continuance in\noccupation by any person of the public premises\nafter the authority (whether by way of grant or any\nother mode of transfer) under which he was\nallowed to occupy the premises, has expired or has\nbeen determined for any reason whatsoever.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 69 of 157\n\n86. So far as the proceedings for eviction under the Public\n\nPremises Act, 1971 are concerned,\nSections 4\nand\nthereof\n\ndeserve to be also considered. The relevant extract reads thus:-\n\n\"4. Issue of notice to show cause against order\nof eviction. - (1) If the estate officer is of opinion\nthat any persons are in unauthorised occupation of\nany public premises and that they should be\nevicted, the Estate Officer shall issue in the\nmanner hereinafter provided a notice in writing\ncalling upon all persons concerned to show cause\nwhy an order of eviction should not be made.\n\n(2) The notice shall-\n\n(a) specify the grounds on which the order of\neviction is proposed to be made; and\n\n(b) require all persons concerned, that is to say, all\npersons who are, or may be in occupation of, or\nclaim interest in, the public premises,-\n\n(i) to show cause, if any, against the proposed\norder on before such date as is specified in the\nnotice, being a date not earlier than seven days\nform the date of issue thereof, and\n\n(ii) to appear before the Estate Officer on the date\nspecified in the notice along with the evidence\nwhich they intend to produce in support of the\ncause shown, and also for personal hearing, if such\nhearing is desired.]\n\nxxxx\n\n5. Eviction of unauthorised occupants. - (1) If,\nafter considering the cause, if any, shown by any\nperson in pursuance of a notice under\nsection 4\n\nand [any evidence produced by him in support of\nthe same and after personal hearing, if any, given\nunder clause (b) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 4\n], the\nestate officer is satisfied that the public premises\nare in unauthorised occupation, the estate officer\nmay make an order of eviction, for reasons to be\nrecorded therein, directing that the public\npremises shall be vacated, on such date as may be\nspecified in the order, by all persons who may be\nin occupation thereof or any part thereof, and\ncause a copy of the order to be affixed on the outer\ndoor or some other conspicuous part of the public\npremises.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 70 of 157\n\n(2) If any person refuses or fails to comply with the\norder of eviction [ on or before the date specified\nin the said order or within fifteen days of the date\nof its publication under sub-section (1), whichever\nis later.] the estate officer or any other officer duly\nauthorised by the estate officer in his behalf [ may,\nafter the date so specified or after the expiry of the\nperiod aforesaid, whichever is later, evict that\nperson] from, and take possession of, the public.\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\n87. The present cases raise a pertinent question as to\n\nwhether the cancellation of the allotments to the petitioners\n\nwas justified and valid and whether the petitioners‟ occupancy\n\nthereafter could be brought within the meaning of the\n\nexpression \"unauthorised\" under Section 2(g) of the Public\n\nPremises Act, 1971.\n\n88. The statutory definition of the expression \"unauthorised\n\noccupation\" in Section 2(g) of the Public Premises Act, 1971\n\nthus requires judicial interpretation for the purposes of the\n\npresent cases.\nIn this regard the oft quoted words of Justice\n\nP.N. Bhagwati in (\n1983) 1 SCC 228 National Textile\n\nWorkers' Union vs. P.R. Ramakrishnan\nwould be apposite\n\nwhen it was stated as follows :-\n\n\"We cannot allow the dead hand of the past to stifle\nthe growth of the living present. Law cannot stand still\n: it must change with the changing social concepts and\nvalues. If the bark that protects the tree fails to grow\nand expand along with the tree, it will either choke the\ntree or if it is a living tree, it will shed that bark and\ngrow a new living bark for itself. Similarly, if the law\nfails to respond to the needs of changing society, then\neither it will stifle the growth of the society and choke\nits progress or if the society is vigorous enough, it will\ncast away the law which stands in the way of its\ngrowth. Law must therefore constantly be on the move\nadapting itself to the fast changing society and not lag\nbehind.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 71 of 157\n\n89. While interpreting statutory provisions, the Supreme Court\n\nhas also approved and applied in a number of cases, the\n\nprinciple of \"updating construction\" while interpreting statutes\n\nas set out by the leading jurist Francis Bennion in his\n\ncommentaries titled 'Statutory Interpretation', 2nd Edn., pg 617.\n\n{Ref : (2003) 4 SCC 601 State of Maharashtra vs. Dr.\n\nPraful D. Desai ; (\n1997) 5 SCC 482 CIT Vs. Poddar Cement\n\nPvt. Ltd.\n; (\n2000) 8 SCC 740 Basavaraj R. Patil vs. State of\n\nKarnataka\n}.\nThese principles have been noticed in (1996) 2\n\nSCC 428 State vs. S.J. Choudhary and read as follows :-\n\n\"(2) It is presumed that Parliament intends the court to\napply to an ongoing Act a construction that\ncontinuously updates its wording to allow for changes\nsince the Act was initially framed (an updating\nconstruction). While it remains law, it is to be treated\nas always speaking. This means in its application on\nany date, the language of the Act, though necessarily\nembedded in its own time, is nevertheless to be\nconstrued in accordance with the need to treat it as\ncurrent law.\"\n\nAt page (618-19), of the report, it is further noted that:-\n\n\"In construing an ongoing Act, the interpreter is to\npresume that Parliament intended the Act to be applied\nat any future time in such a way as to give effect to the\ntrue original intention. Accordingly, the interpreter is\nto make allowances for any relevant changes that have\noccurred, since the Act's passing, in law, social\nconditions, technology, the meaning of words, and\nother matters. Just as the US Constitution is regarded\nas 'a living Constitution', so an ongoing\nBritish Act\nis\nregarded as 'a living Act'. That today's construction\ninvolves the supposition that Parliament was catering\nlong ago for a state of affairs that did not then exist is\nno argument against that construction. Parliament, in\nthe wording of an enactment, is expected to anticipate\ntemporal developments. The drafter will try to foresee\nthe future, and allow for it in the wording.\"\n\nIt was, therefore, observed that an ongoing Act is taken\n\nto be always speaking stating that :-\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 72 of 157\n\n\"An enactment of former days is thus to be read today,\nin the light of dynamic processing received over the\nyears, with such modification of the current meaning of\nits language as will now give effect to the original\nlegislative intention. The reality and effect of dynamic\nprocessing provides the gradual adjustment. It is\nconstituted by judicial interpretation, year in and year\nout. It also comprises processing by executive\nofficials.\"\n\nThus, the courts have over the period of time applied this\n\nprinciple to interpret various terms and phrases including\n\n\"stage carriage\" has been interpreted to include \"electric\n\ntramcar\"; \"steam tricycle\" to include \"locomotive\"; \"telegraph\"\n\nto include \"telephone\"; \"banker‟s book\" to include \"microfilm\";\n\n\"to take note\" to include \"use of tape recorder\"; \"documents\" to\n\ninclude \"data bases\"; \"handwriting\" was construed to include\n\n\"typewriting\" {Ref: 1996(2) SCC 428 State Vs.\n\nS.J.Chaudhary}. \"Notice in writing\" in\nSection 138\nof the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, were construed to include a\n\n\"notice by fax\".\n{Ref : (\n1999) 4 SCC 567 SIL Import USA\n\nVs. Exim Aides Silk Exporters\n}. This principle of legal\n\ninterpretation would squarely apply to the construction to be\n\nplaced on the provisions of Public Premises Act, 1971.\n\n90. Because of the peculiar circumstances prevalent in the\n\nKashmir valley, members of the minority community were\n\ntargetted and singled out for hostility as a class in their home\n\nstate. Admittedly, the state was unable to protect their rights\n\nor properties.\n\n91. The state authorities assessed the threat perception and\n\ndanger to the lives to some of the petitioners who were bodily\n\nevacuated from their homes in the valley. The transfer of the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 73 of 157\n\npetitioners, (or that of the persons on whom they were\n\ndependent), to Delhi, which preceded the allotment of quarters,\n\nwas thus compelled by the inability of the respondents to\n\nprotect and ensure the right to life of the petitioners. The same\n\nwas certainly involuntary. The allotments were a result of the\n\nextreme necessity recognised and adjudged by the respondents\n\nthemselves. It is also noteworthy that those fleeing to safety\n\nhad no opportunity to secure or salvage their properties.\n\n92. It is an admitted fact that over this period, the properties\n\nof the petitioners in Jammu & Kashmir have either been\n\ndestroyed or, in other cases, occupied by militants or the\n\nmajority groups in the state. On account of the inability of the\n\nGovernment to protect the lives and properties of the\n\npetitioners, despite the Constitutional mandate, the\n\npetitioners have been deprived of their properties, are\n\nunable to return to their homes and face danger to their\n\nlives, if they do so.\n\n93. The accommodation allotted to the petitioners is the only\n\naccommodation which they have ever known in this city. The\n\npetitioners state that they do not own any other property. It is\n\nthe same sheer necessity which compels the petitioners to\n\ncontinue to occupy the premises which was allotted to them. It\n\nis clearly evident that having identified and supplied such need\n\nof the petitioners, absent any alternative with them, the\n\nrespondents would be required to maintain the same.\n\n94. The petitioners have been at the receiving end of the\n\nthreats not only for the reason that they were from another\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 74 of 157\n\ncommunity but also largely because they represented the face of\n\nthe Central Government in the valley as its employees.\n\n95. It is important to note that the scheme noticed in the\n\naforenoticed affidavit dated 6th October, 2009 (filed by the Chief\n\nSecretary before the Supreme Court in\nJ.K. Koul vs. Union of\n\nIndia\n(supra); talks of 'Return and Rehabilitation'. It does not\n\neven advert to resettlement. No reference is made to the safety\n\nor security of the migrants who agreed or attempted to return.\n\nInterestingly, there is reference to 37280 Kashmiri families who\n\nhad registered for the relief including accommodation out of\n\nwhich out of which only 5000 families have been provided\n\naccommodation. An undertaking stood given to the Supreme\n\nCourt that the government would provide such facilities to all\n\nthe Kashmiri migrants till they are residing at the present\n\nplaces. Persons as the petitioners are not even covered under\n\nthose who are dealt with in this affidavit.\n\n96. It is also noteworthy that the affidavit filed before the\n\nSupreme Court refers to a total package of the Central\n\nGovernment involving an outlay of Rupees 1618.40 crores.\n\n97. The affidavit of the Chief Secretary does not even refer to\n\nthe utilisation of this huge amount of public money and the fate\n\nof the proposed facilities. There is nothing even before this\n\ncourt which could suggest that the facilities promised before the\n\nSupreme Court, have even come into existence.\n\n98. The alternatives propounded and the schemes pertaining\n\nto Kashmiri migrants noticed in the judgments of the Supreme\n\nCourt and of this court remain in the realm of proposals and\n\nunimplemented schemes alone without any element of reality or\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 75 of 157\n\nfairness. No alternative at all has been made available to or\n\noffered to the petitioners even during the hearings before this\n\ncourt. In the light of the well settled principles laid in the\n\nabove precedents, the inevitable conclusion is that the\n\nrespondents have not taken the relevant factors into\n\nconsideration and have acted arbitrarily and unreasonably.\n\nThe above discussion clearly manifests that the respondents\n\nhave not acted fairly in discharge of their positive obligation\n\nand have not sufficiently engaged with the problems and\n\ndifficulties of the petitioners.\n\n99. The petitioners have been prevented from residing in their\n\nhomes in Jammu & Kashmir for the reason that the State has\n\nbeen unable to secure their lives or protect their homes. In\n\nfact, the respondents also admit their inability to ensure\n\nprotection to the life and limb of the petitioners in case they\n\nwere to return to the home state, let alone any measure of\n\nsecurity for their continued residence in the place of their birth,\n\nin case they returned.\n\n100. On behalf of the respondents, it has been argued at length\n\neven in these proceedings that the Union of India has\n\nformulated a package for return and rehabilitation of the\n\ndisplaced persons. This by itself shows that the situation is not\n\nsuch that the petitioners are in a position to return to their\n\nhomes. The respondents are clearly unable to ensure protection\n\nto the lives of the petitioners and their families or security in\n\ntheir homes.\n\n101. Mr. Jatan Singh, learned standing counsel for the UOI has\n\nplaced reliance on the pronouncement of this court reported at\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 76 of 157\n\n2000 (55) DRJ 57 Bhim Singh Vs. Union of India & Anr . In\n\nthis case, the petitioner had sought upgradation of the\n\naccommodation allotted to him on grounds of the security cover\n\nwhich had been granted to him as a president of a political\n\nparty. A challenge was also laid to the eviction proceedings. It\n\nwas held that the accommodation allotted to him was not liable\n\nto be upgraded. It is noteworthy that the petitioner in that case\n\ndid not hail from the Kashmir valley. No plea that the petitioner\n\ncould not return to his own accommodation on account of\n\ninability of the state to protect either his life or the property was\n\nputforth or considered. In the present case, the petitioners seek\n\nno upgradation of accommodation but only protection of their\n\nbasic human right and the fundamental right to life. There is no\n\nparity at all between Bhim Singh's case (supra) and the\n\npresent cases.\n\n102. It needs no elaboration that a judgment has to be\n\nexamined in the context of the factual matrix which it decides.\n\nThe judgment reported at (1995) II AD Delhi 293 Union of\n\nIndia Vs. S.M. Aggarwal & 31 Others, also relied upon by the\n\nrespondents, was a case of eviction of shopkeepers who were\n\nlicencees in shops which were public premises and had failed to\n\nshow cause in answer to the notice issued by the Estate Officer.\n\nThis case cannot be compared with the factual matrix noticed\n\nhereinabove.\n\n103. The respondents have also placed reliance on the\n\npronouncement of this court reported at\nAIR 1977 Delhi 268\n\nHardwari Lal Verma Vs. The Estate Officer & Ors.\nwherein\n\nthe court held that an allottee of a Government quarter is\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 77 of 157\n\nmerely a licencee. There can be no dispute at all with this\n\nproposition. However, Hardwari Lal Verma had also not raised\n\nany question of violation of basic human and constitutional\n\nrights as the petitioners have in the present case. No fact\n\nsituation as in the present case was involved.\n\n104. The petitioners are not continuing to occupy the subject\n\npremises because they want to do so. They are also not claiming\n\na right to indefinitely occupy the public premises or asserting a\n\ntitle or a right thereto in respect of the subject property. The\n\npetitioners have merely sought protection of their right to\n\nshelter till such time, as the respondents are able to ensure\n\ntheir right to life in their home state or make available a\n\nreasonable alternative shelter to the petitioners. The\n\nrespondents have themselves considered such requests and\n\npermitted identically placed persons to continue to occupy the\n\nallotted accommodation. Such a claim has also been\n\nentertained and granted by not only the Supreme Court, but\n\nalso by this court as well in several precedents noticed\n\nhereinabove. The respondents have admitted in their counter\n\naffidavit that the petitioners have nowhere else to go.\n\n105. Within the larger group of the IDPs from Kashmir, the\n\npetitioners form a special class and are retired government\n\npersonnel. When the petitioners were forced to relocate, they\n\nreceived government accommodation not only as an incidence\n\nof their service, but also on account of their compulsive eviction\n\nfrom their homes. They have also not been able to get any\n\nbenefit of any of the schemes framed by the government which\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 78 of 157\n\nclearly admit the special needs and entitlement of these\n\ndisplaced persons.\n\n106. Despite this hard reality, the representations,\n\nundertakings and promises of the Central Government, upon\n\nretirement, the allotments to the petitioners stand cancelled\n\nand they are being asked to vacate Government\n\naccommodation; otherwise they face the threat of eminent\n\nforcible eviction therefrom pursuant to proceedings taken\n\nagainst them under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n.\n\n107. The petitioners may thereby be compelled to return to the\n\nviolent situation where from they were evicted/evacuated/or\n\nforced to flee. Forcing the petitioners who are IDPs to return\n\nto the area where they were persecuted violates the principle of\n\nnon-refoulement which is the principle in international law\n\nforbidding the expulsion of a refuge into an area where such\n\nperson mights be again subjected to persecution. The\n\nrespondents cannot be permitted, to on a hyper-technical\n\nconstruction of statutory provision or arbitrary exercise of\n\npower to create a situation where the homeless petitioners are\n\ncompelled to return to the areas where they may face violence\n\nand threat to their life and liberty.\n\n108. The respondents have themselves recognised the\n\nentitlement of the petitioners to appropriate residence, when\n\nthey made the allotments. The only reason advanced by the\n\nrespondents for their decision to cancel the allotment and to\n\nevict the petitioners is that they have retired. The relevant\n\nfactor as to the developments in the state of Jammu & Kashmir\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 79 of 157\n\nand the effect of such eviction has not even been remotely\n\nconsidered. No examination of the issue of whether the spirit or\n\nintendment of the avowed policy of rehabilitation been\n\nachieved, or not, has been undertaken.\n\n109. The situation which was to be addressed in these cases\n\nwas truly exceptional. This aspect has also not even remotely\n\nentered the respondents consideration. In fact the decisions of\n\nthe respondents amply illustrates that the respondents are not\n\nrational, reasonable or consistent in their decision making. The\n\nconstruction placed by the respondents in the cases of these\n\nIDPs on the permissibility of the occupancy of the quarters\n\nunder the Allotment Rules as relateable solely to their service\n\nresults in violation of constitutional guarantees and was clearly\n\nand completely unwarranted. It needs no further elaboration\n\nthat the rights which the petitioners are complaining breach of,\n\nare the rights guaranteed to them under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nand\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. For these reasons, the\n\ninterpretation of the expression \"unauthorised occupation\" by\n\nthe respondents as well as in the impugned orders is blinkered,\n\nrestricted and impermissible in the given facts. The expression\n\n\"authority for such occupation\" appearing in\nSection 2(g)\nmust\n\ntake within its ambit the constitutional violations which result\n\nfrom the restricted working of the statutory provisions by the\n\nrespondents. It was incumbent upon all concerned with the\n\ndecision making to take into consideration the most material\n\ndevelopments in the home state of the petitioners and the fact\n\nthat the State was unable to guarantee protection of life and\n\nliberty to the petitioners in case they return; the insufficiency\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 80 of 157\n\nand inability of the resettlement/rehabilitation effort and the\n\nabsence of any alternative to the petitioners for the purposes of\n\nconstruction of the expression \"authority for such occupation\".\n\nNo legal interpretation could be acceptable which does not take\n\ninto its consideration these relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nThe petitioners are occupying the accommodation because of\n\nthe failure of the respondents to discharge the constitutional\n\nmandate and their public law obligations of protecting the right\n\nto life and liberty of the petitioners. As noticed above, the\n\nauthority to occupy the quarters so far as the petitioners were\n\nconcerned was derived from the constitutional guarantees.\n\nSuch occupancy cannot be deemed or held to be\n\n\"unauthorised\" by any measure.\n\n110. The significant difference between the cases of the\n\npetitioners and that of an unauthorised occupant of public\n\npremises is that the writ petitioners have continued to occupy\n\nthe public premises only on account of the inability of the state\n\nto protect the fundamental and basic human rights of the\n\npetitioners.\n\n111. The respondents would have the records of the\n\ncircumstances in which the petitioners and their successors in\n\ninterest were transferred and evacuated to Delhi and also the\n\nextreme necessity of making the allotments of the quarters to\n\nthese persons who were not only Government servants but also\n\nIDPs. The Directorate of Estates which has effected the\n\nimpugned decisions cancelling the allotments would be aware\n\nof the pronouncements in respect of identically placed persons\n\nof the Supreme Court in\nP.K. Koul Vs. Estate Officer\n, this\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 81 of 157\n\ncourt in\nJ.K. Koul vs. Union of India\n, the order of the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal in Tej Kishan Vs. Union of India &\n\nOrs. and implemented the same. The respondents are aware of\n\nthe prevalent situation.\n\n112. No legal interpretation would be acceptable which does\n\nnot take into its consideration the relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances. There can also be no statutory interpretation\n\nwhich results in violation and constitutional guarantees and\n\nprotection.\n\nThe present petitioners certainly cannot be compared\n\nwith or treated in the same manner in which the respondents\n\nwould deal with any other occupant who has not suffered the\n\ngross violations and deprivations as the petitioners, and is\n\nunauthorisedly occupying the public premises.\n\n113. It, therefore, has to be held that the occupation by\n\npetitioners cannot be construed as \"unauthorized occupation\" of\n\nthe quarters within the meaning of the expression in\nSection\n\n2(g)\nof the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized\n\nOccupants) Act, 1971.\n\n114. An examination of the impugned orders is now\n\nnecessitated. The cancellation of the allotments and the action\n\ninitiated under the Public Premises Act, 1971 were resisted by\n\nthe petitioners on the several grounds on which these writ\n\npetitions are premised. However, the same resulted in the\n\nimpugned orders of eviction.\n\n115. The sole reason given by the Estate Officer for passing the\n\nimpugned orders of eviction is that the allotments in favour of\n\nthe petitioners stand cancelled and that they had failed to prove\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 82 of 157\n\nthat they were not in unauthorized occupation of the instant\n\npremises. None of the other contentions of the petitioner have\n\nbeen even mentioned let alone considered.\n\n116. The petitioners' appeals assailing these eviction orders\n\nstand rejected.\n\n117. The petitioners had placed the several decisions relating\n\nto similarly situated persons before the respondents, the Estate\n\nOfficer as well as the learned Additional District Judges. A plea\n\nwas taken that because of failure of the respondents to ensure\n\nthe protection of the rights of the petitioners under\nArticle 21\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India they continued to occupy the quarters.\n\nThe petitioners had also urged that they stood deprived of home\n\nand hearth because of the failure of the respondents to ensure\n\nthe constitutional guarantees and discharge the mandate\n\nthereunder.\n\n118. The appellate orders notice the petitioners' contention\n\nthat the petitioners have made several representations to\n\nvarious authorities for allowing them to retain the\n\naccommodation on the ground that they belong to Kashmir and\n\nit was not feasible to return in view of the communal riots and\n\nterrorists movements. These requests have not been acceded\n\nto. The impugned appellate orders record that the petitioners\n\nhave challenged the eviction orders on the ground that the\n\nEstate Officer had failed to consider the fact that they were\n\nKashmiri migrants and cannot return to Srinagar till normalcy\n\nis restored. It was also a ground of appeal that the Estate\n\nOfficer had not considered the orders in SLP No. 1369/1997 by\n\nthe Supreme Court and that the petitioners' cases were on the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 83 of 157\n\nsame footings. The challenge had also been laid to the orders\n\nof the estate officer on grounds of arbitrariness and violation of\n\nprinciples of natural justice.\n\n119. The appellate court in the impugned orders has also\n\nproceeded on the sole ground that there was no lease or license\n\ndeed issued in favour of the petitioners by the Government of\n\nIndia. The orders of the Apex Court were not considered on the\n\nsole ground that copy of the Special Leave Petition had not been\n\nplaced before the court and that the petitioners were not a\n\nparty to the proceedings. The learned appellate court was also\n\nof the view that the petitioners were provided accommodation\n\nin Delhi because they were in service in Delhi and not because\n\nof terrorists threats and further that accommodation was given\n\nonly by virtue of employment. It was also concluded that no\n\nrelief had been granted to the petitioners by the Supreme Court\n\nand therefore, the orders did not assist the Supreme Court.\n\nThe eviction orders had been sustained in view of these\n\nconclusions.\n\n120. As a result, such working of the Public Premises Act by\n\nthe respondents, the petitioners are being threatened with\n\neviction from the only shelters that they know, without any\n\nalternative being available to them.\n\n121. The respondents are bound to act in a manner which is\n\ncompatible with the constitutional rights of the petitioner while\n\nthis court has to take into account and require the legislation to\n\nbe read compatibly with such rights. The object is to ensure\n\nthat the actions and orders must be such as to avert or rectify\n\nany violation of such basic rights.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 84 of 157\n\n122. The scheme of the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\nshows that the notice which\n\nis issued under\nSection 4\nto show cause is required to specify\n\nthe grounds on which the eviction is proposed to be made and\n\nrequire the persons concerned to show cause against the\n\nproposed order before the specified date when they are to\n\nproduce evidence in support of the show cause. Under\nSection\nof the Act, the Estate Officer is required to consider the show\n\ncause by the noticee under\nSection 4\nas well as the evidence\n\nproduced by him and after personal hearing, if any, given.\n\nThereafter, the Estate Officer is required to record reasons for\n\nhis satisfaction for making an order of eviction. The orders of\n\nthe estate officer discloses no reasons at all to support\n\nsatisfaction to order eviction. The impugned orders do not\n\nreflect the consideration of the contentions on the evidence\n\nplaced by the petitioners.\n\n123. The due process clause in the Constitution mandates\n\nensuring that the state provides a humane standard of living to\n\nits citizens.\n\n124. The letter from Ministry of Urban Development to Delhi\n\nDevelopment Authority placed on record in Tej Kishan vs. UOI\n\n(supra) before the Central Administrative Tribunal (also relied\n\nupon in 132 (\n2006) DLT 672 P.K. Handoo vs. Estate Officer\n\nindicates engagement of the authorities with this issue and the\n\ndecision of the Central Government directing that schemes be\n\nframed by the Delhi Development Authority as well for making\n\npreferential allotments of accommodation to Kashmiri migrants.\n\nIn addition, the Government affidavit dated 6th October, 2009 in\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 85 of 157\n\nJ.L. Koul (supra) filed in the Supreme Court of India also\n\nexpresses the same concern as has been expressed in the above\n\nGuiding Principles on Internal Displacement.\n\nThese actions unequivocally manifest the respondents'\n\nawareness about the positive obligation imposed upon them to\n\nensure that the persons displaced from Kashmir are required to\n\nbe resettled and/or rehabilitated. There is admission of\n\nresponsibility and culpability. The working of the measures,\n\nhowever, reflects that the steps which have been taken are\n\ninadequate and hopelessly insufficient. Even in the prolonged\n\nhearing before this court, the respondents could place no\n\nalternative so far as the petitioners were concerned.\n\n125. In AIR 2010 SC 1476 State of West Bengal vs. The\n\nCommunity for Protection of Democratic Rights, West\n\nBengal & Ors., the Supreme Court has also held that the court\n\nwas required to weigh the impact of a particular government\n\nscheme, statute or action on the fundamental rights of those\n\neffected by the government scheme, statute or action. In case\n\nany statute or action abrogates or abridges such rights, it would\n\nbe violative of the basic structure/doctrine of the Constitution.\n\nFor this reason as well, any application or enforcement\n\nof statutory provisions, rules, regulations that impacts or\n\nimpinges fundamental rights has to be struck down.\n\n126. In [2004] EWCA Civ 540 Secretary of State for the\n\nHome Department vs. Wayoka Limbuela, Binyam Tefera\n\nTesema & Yusif Adam, the House of Lords has prescribed a\n\ntest to determine whether a statutory scheme or a government\n\npolicy caused a violation of fundamental rights. It was observed\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 86 of 157\n\nthat when a reasonable evaluation of all relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances shows that a government policy would subject\n\npetitioners to an immediate and serious deprivation of the basic\n\nnecessities of life, then the court may properly grant relief. It\n\nwas also held that the state would be liable for both action and\n\ninaction as long as the action or inaction results in a serious\n\ndeprivation of rights or human dignity.\n\n127. In the light of the directions by the Supreme Court and\n\nthis court in the aforenoticed cases relating to identically\n\nsituated displaced persons who are victims of violence, the\n\ncontest by the respondents to the present writ petitions on\n\ntechnical, specious and legally untenable grounds is unfair to\n\nsay the least. Similar issues have arisen before and orders\n\nstand passed in favour of the similarly placed persons therein.\n\n128. The petitioners have suffered on account of the\n\nrespondents failure to protect their life and liberty when they\n\nwere compelled to flee from their homes in Kashmir. In\n\ninternational law, refugees are protected from being compelled\n\nto return to places or situations where their lives or freedom\n\ncould be threatened. It is pointed out that the respondents\n\nhave implemented this principle in the cases of Chakmas,\n\nTibetans, and else where IDPs, who are citizens of the same\n\ncountry, certainly cannot be treated differently and compelled\n\nto return to violent situations.\n\n129. The proceedings as well as the impugned decisions and\n\norders have completely failed to take into consideration the\n\nmaterial issue of the impact of the proceedings and the orders\n\nwhich would result in forcible eviction of the petitioners from\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 87 of 157\n\nthe only shelters known to them without any alternative. The\n\nimpugned cancellation of allotments, the orders of eviction\n\npassed by the Estate Officer and the aforenoticed orders\n\ndismissing the appeals of the petitioners are in the teeth of the\n\nconstitutional guarantees to the petitioners under\nArticles\n\n19(1)(e)(g)\nand\nand therefore not sustainable.\n\n130. Such cancellation of allotment and forcible eviction at the\n\nhands of the State utilizing the shield of a statutory right to do\n\nso under the Public Premises Act, 1971 results in violation of the\n\nconstitutional rights of the petitioners. It is manifest therefore\n\nsuch that such application of law as would have an impact of\n\nviolating the fundamental rights of the petitioners is\n\nimpermissible under the constitutional scheme.\n\nProportionality test\n\n131. The proportionality of the impact on the fundamental right\n\ninvolved by working of the statutory provision as against the\n\nobjective of the concerned statute is another important test for\n\nadjudicating upon the legality of the interference with the right\n\nwhich would have a bearing on the present case. In a\n\npronouncement of the House of Lords reported at (2007)\n\nUKHL 11:(2007) 4 All ER 15 Huang Vs. Secretary of State\n\nfor the Home Department, the decision making role and\n\nfunction of the appellate immigration authorities in the context\n\nof the\nHuman Rights Act, 1998\nand the Immigration and Asylum\n\nAct, 1999 was in issue. The House examined the scope of\n\nreviews by the prescribed authorities. The private parties\n\ncomplained of violation of their rights under\nArticle 8\nof the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 88 of 157\n\nEuropean Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\n\nFundamental Freedoms, 1950 which provides as under:-\n\n\"1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private\nand family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.\nThere shall be no interference by a public authority\nwith the exercise of this right except such as is in\naccordance with the law and is necessary in a\ndemocratic society in the interests of national security,\npublic safety or the economic well-being of the country,\nfor the prevention of disorder or crime, for the\nprotection of health or morals, or for the protection of\nthe rights and freedoms of others.\"\n\nThe consideration by the House of Lords on the principle of\n\nproportionality of the impact of the interference on the right vis-a-\n\nvis, the legitimate end in view is important and reads as follows :-\n\n\" xxx xxxx\n\nIn most cases where the applicants complain\nof a violation of their art 8 rights, in a case where the\nimpugned decision is authorised by law for a\nlegitimate object and the interference (or lack of\nrespect) is of sufficient seriousness to engage the\noperation or art 8, the crucial question is likely to be\nwhether the interference (or lack of respect)\ncomplained of is proportionate to the legitimate\nend sought to be achieved. Proportionality is a\nsubject of such importance as to require separate\ntreatment.\n\nPROPORTIONALITY\n\nIn de Freitas Vs. Permanent Secretary of\nMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Lands and Housing\n[1999] 1 AC 69 at 80, [1998] 3 WLR 675 at 684, the\nPrivy Council, drawing on South African, Canadian\nand Zimbabwean authority, defined the questions\ngenerally to be asked in deciding whether a measure\nis proportionate :\n\n`....Whether : (i) the legislative objective is\nsufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental\nright; (ii) the measures designed to meet the\nlegislative objective are rationally connected to it; and\n\n(iii) the means used to impair the right or freedom are\nno more than is necessary to accomplish the\nobjective.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 89 of 157\n\nThis formulation has been widely cited and\napplied. But counsel for the applicants (with the\nsupport of Liberty, in a valuable written intervention)\nsuggested that the formulation was deficient in\nomitting reference to an overriding requirement which\nfeatured in the judgment of Dickson CJ in R v Oakes\n[1986] 1 SCR 103, from which this approach to\nproportionality derives. This feature is (at 139) the\nneed to balance the interests of society with those of\nindividuals and groups. This is indeed an aspect\nwhich should never be overlooked or discounted. The\nHouse recognised as much in R (Razgar) v Secretary\nof State for the Home Dept [2004] UKHL 27 at [17]-\n[20], [26], [27], [60],[77], [2004] 2 All ER 821 at [17]-\n[20], [26], [27], [60], [77], [2004] 2 AC 368 when,\nhaving suggested a series of questions which an\nadjudicator would have to ask and answer in deciding\na convention question, it said (at [20]) that the\njudgment on proportionality -\n\n`must always involve the striking of a fair\nbalance between the rights of the individual and the\ninterests of the community which is inherent in the\nwhole of the convention. The severity and\nconsequences of the interference will call for careful\nassessment at this stage.'\n\nIf, as counsel suggest, insufficient attention has\nbeen paid to this requirement, the failure should be\nmade good.\n\nxxxx\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n132. Having regard to the drastic violation which results from\n\nthe impugned action and orders, it has to be held that the\n\ndecision of the authorities to cancel the allotments and proceed\n\nfor eviction as well as the impugned orders against the\n\npetitioners are not in accordance with law even on reasonable\n\nassessment of proportionality viz-a-viz the object of eviction of\n\nunauthorised occupants of the Public Premises Act, 1971.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 90 of 157\n\nViolation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\n\n133. The petitioners have also complained that the respondents\n\nhad discretion to permit the petitioners to continue to occupy\n\nthe premises under SR 317-B-25 of the Allotment of\n\nGovernment Residences (General Pool in Delhi) Rules,\n\n1963. It is contended that the respondents were bound to\n\nconsider the matter on the relevant consideration of the right to\n\nshelter of the petitioners which was involved and cannot\n\npremise their action on extraneous and impermissible reasons\n\nor considerations.\n\nMr. B.L. Wali, learned counsel for petitioners has urged\n\nthat the failure to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioners\n\nis in fact not only in violation of the constitutional obligations of\n\nthe respondents, but is arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\n134. Shri P.K. Kaul, (writ petitioner in W.P.(C) No.15239/2004)\n\nhad earlier filed WP (C) No.6551/2003, submitting that the\n\nrespondents had arbitrarily failed to consider his request for\n\nregularization despite having knowledge of the special\n\ncircumstances of the case. Mr.B.L.Wali, learned counsel for this\n\npetitioner has placed the order which was passed on 15th\n\nOctober, 2003 in the earlier writ petition, which directed the\n\nrespondents to consider the question of regularization of\n\nallotment in favour of the petitioner in view of the special\n\ncircumstances. It was directed that the petition including its\n\nenclosures should also be considered while disposing of the\n\npetitioner's representation.\n\n135. Despite these orders, the writ petitioner has contended\n\nthat there has been no consideration in terms of this order till\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 91 of 157\n\ndate. He has, therefore, filed the writ petition being WP (C)\n\nNo.15239/2004 challenging the notice issued by the Estate\n\nOfficer under\nsection 4\nof the Public Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1972 to him.\n\n136. The other writ petitioners have also made similar requests\n\nto the respondents for exercise of discretion which were\n\nreiterated by them in the reply to the notices issued by the\n\nEstate officer under Section 4 of the Public Premises Act as well\n\nas in the appeals which were filed. The same ground of\n\nchallenge to the respondents‟ action has been urged in these\n\nwrit petitions.\n\n137. Mr.B.L.Wali, learned counsel appearing for some of the\n\npetitioners has pointed out that the respondents have exercised\n\ndiscretion favourably and permitted some identically situated\n\ndisplaced Kashmiris to continue in allotted premises after\n\nretirement whereas this has been arbitrarily denied to the\n\npetitioners. Learned counsels contend that the respondents‟\n\naction so far as the present petitioners are concerned, is\n\ndiscriminatory and not sustainable.\n\n138. The respondents on the other hand place reliance on the\n\npronouncement of the court in (\n1997) 1 SCC 444 Shiv Sagar\n\nTiwari vs. Union of India\nand dispute that they have any\n\ndiscretion in the matter.\n\n139. Allotment of government accommodations are effected\n\nunder the provisions of Allotment of Government Residences\n\n(General Pool in Delhi) Rules, 1963. Reference is made to\n\nSR 317-B-25 thereof which empowers the Government to relax\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 92 of 157\n\nthe provisions of these rules and deserves to be considered in\n\nextenso. The same reads as follows:-\n\n\"SR 317-B-25: The Government may for reasons to\nbe recorded in writing relax all or any of the provisions\nof the Rules in this Division in the case of any officer or\nresidence or class of officers or type of residences.\"\n\n140. It is undisputed before us that despite the propounded\n\nrehabilitation schemes stated before the Supreme Court and\n\nestablishment of preferential quotas in allotments placed before\n\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal, the respondents have not\n\nbeen able to rehabilitate or resettle any of the petitioners.\n\n141. The respondents have also not denied the availability of\n\nthe discretion under SR 317 B 25 of the Allotment Rules, 1963\n\nand its favourable exercise in favour of some Kashmiri IDPs.\n\nYet, the respondents have failed to exercise the same discretion\n\nin favour of the present petitioners. No explanation for the\n\nsame is even attempted.\n\n142. On the issue of exercise of discretion, in the judgment\n\nreported at AIR 1980 SC 1622, Municipal Council Ratlam\n\nVs. Vardichan & Ors., the court was concerned with the public\n\npower of the Magistrate under\nSection 133\nof the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure. The court observed that the „public power\n\nof the magistrate under the Code‟ is 'a public duty to the\n\nmembers of the public who are victims of nuisance and so he\n\nshall exercise it when the jurisdictional facts are present as\n\nhere'. So far as exercise of discretion is concerned, it was\n\nobserved as follows :-\n\n\"9. So the guns of Section 133 go into action\nwherever there is public nuisance. The public power of\nthe Magistrate under the Code is a public duty to the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 93 of 157\n\nmembers of the public who are victims of the nuisance,\nand so he shall exercise it when the jurisdictional facts\nare present as here. \"All power is a trust-that we are\naccountable for its exercise-that, from the people,\nand for the people, all springs, and all must exist.\"\n\nDiscretion becomes a duty when the beneficiary\nbrings home the circumstances for its benign\nexercise.\n\nxxxx\"\n\n143. Given the established violation of the fundamental rights\n\nof the petitioners resulting in their displacement; the\n\ndestruction of their property coupled with the prevalent\n\nconditions in their home state; and lack of any alternate to\n\nthem, the exercise of discretion under the SR-317 B-25 of the\n\nallotment of Allotment of Government Residences (General Pool\n\nin Delhi) Rules, 1963 in favour of the petitioners would thus be\n\nthe bounden duty of the respondents. The mandate of the\n\nSupreme Court in Municipal Council Ratlam vs. Vardichan\n\n(supra) would bind even the court.\n\n144. The pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at\n\n(1997) 1 SCC 444 entitled\nShiv Sagar Tiwari Vs. Union of\n\nIndia & Ors.\n, has been placed before this court by the\n\nrespondents. In this case, the court was concerned with gross\n\nmisuse of discretionary power relating to allotment of\n\naccommodation to government employees. As against the\n\npermissible discretionary quota of 10 per cent, such allotments\n\nhad shot up to 70 per cent. On top of these, 8,768 houses were\n\nallotted on \"Special Compassionate Grounds\" in exercise of\n\ndiscretion under the authority of a letter dated 18th July, 1996\n\nfrom the Cabinet Secretary. The Government of India had\n\nsubmitted that it had exercised discretion vested in it under the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 94 of 157\n\naforenoticed SR. The court had concluded that the conduct of\n\nthe respondents did not disclose application of mind and\n\ndiscretion was not exercised fairly. In para 56 of the judgment,\n\nit was observed as follows:-\n\n\"56. The decision of the present Central Government on\nthis aspect as finding place in the letter of the Cabinet\nSecretary dated 18-7-1996 bearing DO No.1/44/1/96-\nCAV is that \"where it is considered absolutely\nnecessary\" small number of out-of-turn allotments\nwould be made for which purpose also the\nMinistries/Departments would formulate clear rules and\nguidelines. During the course of hearing, on being\ndesired to know as to why out-of-turn allotment is at all\nrequired, the submission advanced on behalf of the\nUnion of India was that there are a few officers, who by\nvirtue of the duties discharged, have to be\naccommodated in government quarters to facilitate\nsmooth functioning of the Government.xxx\"\n\n145. In view of the gross abuse of the discretion vested in the\n\nrespondents, in para 57 at page 463 of the report, it was held\n\nthat a case to permit minimal out of turn allotments was made\n\nout which has to be regulated and transparency has to be\n\nmaintained in such allotments. The court considered private\n\ncitizens who could be allotted out of the discretionary quota\n\nwhich included accredited journalists and news cameraman,\n\npolitical parties, artistes, social worker etc and other\n\norganizations as well.\n\nIn\nShiv Sagar Tiwari vs. UOI\n(supra), it was held that\n\nthe discretion conferred has to be exercised to advance the\n\npurpose to subserve which the power exists and that even the\n\nMinister, if he/she be the repository of discretionary power,\n\ncannot claim that either there is no discretion in the matter or\n\nunfettered discretion. The Supreme Court held that exercise of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 95 of 157\n\nsuch discretion was an exception and deprecated the above\n\naction of the Government making the same into a norm.\n\nNoteworthy, is the Government's stand in this case that vesting\n\nof some discretion in the matter of allotment of quarters was\n\nessential.\n\nIn this background, the contention of the respondents\n\nthat exercise of discretion was prohibited by the Supreme Court\n\nin this case is totally misconceived.\n\n146. On the other hand, in the instant cases, the petitioners\n\nhave assailed the arbitrariness in exercise of the discretion\n\nadmittedly conferred on the respondents and the failure to\n\npermit continuation of occupation of the allotted\n\naccommodation in the exceptionable circumstances and\n\nconditions in which they were placed. The pronouncement of\n\nthe Supreme Court, in fact, assists the petitioners as the court\n\nrecognized existence of and permissible exercise of discretion\n\nwhile deprecating its abuse.\n\n147. The standards on which an authority would exercise\n\ndiscretion were settled by the Supreme Court in the judgment\n\nreported at (1979) 3 SCC 489 entitled\nRamana Dayaram\n\nShetty vs. International Airport Authority of India & Ors.\n\nas follows :-\n\n\"10. xxx........It is indeed unthinkable that in a\ndemocracy governed by the rule of law the executive\nGovernment or any of its officers should possess arbitrary\npower over the interests of the individual. Every action of\nthe executive Government must be informed with reason\nand should be free from arbitrariness. That is the very\nessence of the rule of law and its bare minimal\nrequirement. And to the application of this principle it\nmakes not difference whether the exercise of the power\ninvolves affection of some right or denial of some\nprivilege.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 96 of 157\n\nxxx\n\n12. .............It must, therefore, be taken to be the law\nthat where the Government is dealing with the public,\nwhether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts\nor issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of\nlargess, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its\nsweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any\nperson it pleases, but its action must be in conformity\nwith standard or norms which is not arbitrary, irrational\nor irrelevant. The power or discretion of the Government\nin the matter of grant of largess including award of jobs,\ncontracts, quotas, licences etc., must be confined and\nstructured by rational, relevant and non-discriminatory\nstandard or norm and if the Government departs from\nsuch standard or norm in any particular case or cases,\nthe action of the Government would be liable to be struck\ndown, unless it can be shown by the Government that the\ndeparture was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid\nprinciple which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable\nor discriminatory.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n148.\nIn para 85 of the pronouncement reported at AIR 1974\n\nSC 555 entitled\nE.P. Royappa vs. State of Tamilnadu & Anr.\n\nthe Supreme Court laid down the following binding principles :-\n\n\"85. .....In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn\nenemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic\nwhile the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute\nmonarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that\nit is unequal both according to political logic and\nConstitutional law and is therefore violative of\nArticle 14\n,\nand if it affects any matter relating to public\nemployment, it is also violative of\nArticle 16.\n\nArticles 14\n\nand\nstrike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure\nfairness and equality of treatment. They require that\nState action must be based on equivalent relevant\nprinciples applicable alike to all similarly situate and it\nmust not be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant\nconsiderations because that would be denial of equality.\nWhere the operative reason for State action, as\ndistinguished from motive inducing from the\nantechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and relevant\nbut is extraneous and outside the area of permissible\nconsiderations, it would amount to mala fide exercise of\npower and that is hit by\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\nMala fide\nexercise of power and arbitrariness are different lethal\nradiations emanating from the same vice : in fact the\nlatter comprehends the former. Both are inhibited by\n\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 97 of 157\n\nTherefore, even if it were to be held as urged by the\n\nrespondents that this court could be held to be powerless to\n\ndirect exercise of discretion in a particular manner, in view of\n\nthe clear principles\nlaid down in\nthese judicial precedents, there\n\nis no prohibition upon this court from examining as to whether\n\nthe respondents have failed to exercise discretion on relevant\n\ncriterion. There is also no prohibition on this court to examine\n\nwhether the respondents have acted arbitrarily or discriminated\n\nagainst the petitioners.\n\nThe impugned action of the respondents against the\n\npetitioners and the orders assailed herein have to be tested on\n\nthe above principles.\n\n149. A similar argument of the respondent that the allottees\n\nwere prohibited from permitting retention of accommodation\n\nbeyond the permissible period after retirement was rejected by\n\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal in the aforenoticed decision\n\nrendered on 30th December, 2002 in O.A. No.2378/2002\n\nShri Tej Kishan Vs. Union of India & Ors. The Tribunal had\n\nexamined the petitioner‟s challenge to the respondent‟s action\n\non the plea of discrimination premised on the conduct of the\n\nrespondents in exercising discretion in favour of some similarly\n\nsituated migrants and not in favour of the petitioners and\n\nobserved as follows:-\n\n\"31. Respondents have not disputed that\nKashmir migrants who were identically and equally\nsituated, on their request have been allowed to\nretain the accommodation till the normalcy comes\nback in State of J&K and till they are returned,\nensured further the safety of their persons and\nproperty and reconstruction of their houses. For\nthese three Kashmir migrants, who are placed in\nsimilar situation and with same conditions, a\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 98 of 157\n\ndifferent criteria was adopted on the ground of\nmerits in their case, and the principle not to be\ngiven a general application. Applicant who is also a\nKashmir migrant having no place to live in Delhi a large\nfamily to support, is on a similar footing with those who\nwere allowed to retain the accommodation. In order to\nsatisfy the requirements of law, the respondents have to\nestablish that there has been an intelligible differentia\nand which has a reasonable nexus with the object\nsought to be achieved. No grounds whatsoever have\nforthcome which can be treated as reasonable or\nrelevant for to mete out the aforesaid requirements of\nlaw and to pass dual test which will render the decision\nin consonance with the\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. In absence of any reasons and the fact that the\napplicant is equal in all respects should not have been\nmeted out a differential treatment. This in my\nconsidered view, is unsustainable being violative of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\"\n\n150. The tribunal rejected the arguments of the respondents\n\npremised on the pronouncement in\nShiv Sagar Tiwari\n(supra)\n\nas well as scarcity of resources holding as follows :-\n\n32. Moreover, the contention that the directions\nissued in\nShiv Sagar Tiwari\n's case supra and the fact\nthat the Government accommodations are few and the\npersons claiming the same are more and the rules do not\npermit retention beyond the specified period, is no\njustification for rejecting the case of the applicant as in\nJ.L. Koul's case, even in an interim order passed, the\nApex Court was well aware about the decision rendered\nin\nShiv Sagar Tiwari\n's case as well as the Rules were\nalso in existence at that time as well which prohibits\nretention of accommodation beyond the permissible\nperiod. Conscious of this, the Apex Court in the light of\nthe fact and conditions as well as circumstances of\nKashmir migrants, who have their own houses destroyed\nin Kashmir and those retired inclined to go back directed\nthe Government to ensure their protection and as well as\nof their property so that they may be put back to their\nrespective houses owned by them in Kashmir on\n28.1.1998 i.e. much after the decision of S.S. Tiwari's\ncase supra as well as the instructions through OM in\n17.11.1997, the matter has been pending sine die and to\nbe activated only after the State of Jammu and Kashmir\nensures return of the petitioners to their respective\nHomes with safety of their persons and property. The\naforesaid petition is still pending before the Apex Court.\n\n33. I also find that the Government by the letter\ndated 2.7.2002 in order to hold the retirees or retiral\nofficials of Kashmir migrants working in Delhi, who could\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 99 of 157\n\nnot get back to J&K due to prevailing situation, a\ndecision has been taken to allot about 100 MIG/LIG Flats\nand for which DDA has been requested to formulate the\nHousing Scheme for which a draft has been sent to the\nMinistry for approval. The aforesaid decision also\nincorporated that these houses are being allotted to\nKashmir migrants retiring or retired so that the general\npool accommodation got vacated from them. This on a\nliteral consideration connotes that the Kashmir migrants\nwho are in retention of general pool accommodation on\nretirement, are to be evicted only after the DDA\nformulate a Housing Scheme to allot MIG/LIG flats to\nthem.\n\n34.\nIn my considered view, the review undertaken\nby the respondents in compliance of the earlier\ndirections of this Court has not taken note of letter dated\n2.7.2002 as well as the directions in\nKoul\n's case supra. If\na post-facto approval can be accorded by CCA and\napproval by the Ministry for Urban Development denying\nthe same to the applicant who is similarly situated and is\nequal in all respects, smacks of arbitrariness and hostile\ndiscrimination which, as per various pronouncements of\nthe Apex Court, cannot be countenanced and would be\nan antithesis to rule of laws doctrine of equality.\n\n35. In the result and for the forgoing reasons, OA\nis partly allowed. Impugned order dated 13.8.2002 is\nquashed and set aside. Respondents are directed to\nallow the applicant to retain the Government\naccommodation pending decision in SLP (Civil)\nNo.7369/97. No costs.\"\n\n(underlining supplied)\n\nThis decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal has\n\nattained finality and also stands implemented.\n\n151. Before this court the respondents have not even\n\nattempted to show how the present petitioners can be\n\ndistinguished from either Shri Tej Kishan (supra) or from the\n\ninstances noticed in para 31 of the judgment of the Tribunal.\n\nOn the contrary, as set out above, in answer to grounds (A) and\n\n(B) of the writ petition noticed in para 22 above, the\n\nrespondents have stated that these contentions of the petitioner\n\nare a \"matter of record\".\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 100 of 157\n\n152. There is no dispute also to the fact that the orders in\n\nJ.L.Koul, P.K.Handoo, M.K.Koul, Tej Kishan\n(supra) have\n\nattained finality and these persons continue to occupy the\n\nallotted accommodation despite superannuation.\n\n153. The respondents are unable to point a single distinction,\n\nlet alone a relevant one, between the present petitioners and\n\nthose in the decided cases. The petitioners are identically\n\nsituated, yet have been denied equal treatment. Not a whit of\n\nexplanation for not treating these petitioners as those in the\n\ncited precedents is suggested by the respondents. Even the\n\nimpugned orders unfortunately do not attempt to deal with this\n\naspect of the matter.\n\n154. As noticed above, the respondents contended before the\n\nSupreme Court in\nShiv Sagar Tiwari\n(supra) that they have\n\nthe discretion to draw exceptions in the matter of allotments of\n\npublic premises and have relied on instances and categories\n\nwhen this discretion was exercised in favour of persons who\n\nwere even not in public service and were never even employed\n\nby the Government.\n\n155. In ground L of WP(C ) no.15329/2004, Shri P.K.Koul, the\n\npetitioner has stated that the respondents have allotted the\n\nGovernment accommodation not only serving Government\n\nemployees, but to various other categories of employees who\n\nhave nothing to do with Government service. It has been\n\nstated that \"employees working in the office of the political\n\nparties, journalists, freedom fighters, artists etc.\" are also\n\nallotted general pool accommodation. This averment is not\n\ncontested by the respondents who have only submitted that the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 101 of 157\n\nallotment of the quarter is made as per the rules and policy\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Government.\n\n156. It is trite that residuary rules are interpreted and worked\n\nto empower authorities permitting exceptions from applicability\n\nof the rule to remove hardships (Ref : 1993 Supp.3 SCC 515\n\n(para 33) Syed Khalid Rizvi vs. UOI & Ors; (1996) 8 SCC\n\n762 SBI & Ors. vs. Kashinath Kher & Ors.; (1988) 4 SCC\n\n179 Ashok Kr. Uppal and Ors. vs. State of J&K).\n\n157. The orders in Tej Kishan (supra) make a detailed\n\nreference to the voluntary exercise of discretion in favour of\n\nthree migrants by the respondents which was the entire basis\n\nof the finding of arbitrariness by the Tribunal in the action\n\ntaken against Tej Kishan and co-petitioners. These very\n\nfindings squarely apply to the cases of the present petitioners.\n\n158. No explanation is rendered or reason given by the\n\nrespondents for the rejection of identical requests of some of\n\nthe petitioners or for not favourably considering the said\n\nrequests of the petitioners. The failure to even consider these\n\nrequests despite the specific directions in P.K. Koul's previous\n\nwrit petition reflect highhandedness, unreasonableness and\n\narbitrariness on the part of the respondents. The respondents\n\nhave granted approval to similarly situated persons. Denial\n\nthereof to the equally placed petitioners certainly tantamounts\n\nto hostile discrimination against them which is impermissible\n\nand as observed above 'an antithesis to the equality clause'.\n\nThe action of the respondents in not favourably considering the\n\npetitioners' representations; in cancelling the allotments of the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 102 of 157\n\npetitioners and proceeding against them under the Public\n\nPremises Act, 1971 as well as the impugned orders are,\n\ntherefore, not sustainable also being in violation of\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\nChange in Policy\n\n159. There is yet another important side to the claim asserted\n\nby the petitioners which requires consideration. The declared\n\npolicy of the state with regard to the IDPs from Kashmir is\n\nconcerned with their rehabilitation. Forcible eviction from their\n\ncurrent residences without an alternative is not even remotely\n\nsuggested in these policies. The same is evident from the\n\naffidavit placed before the Supreme Court in\nJ.L.Koul vs. State\n\nof Jammu & Kashmir\n(supra) and the letter dated 2nd July,\n\n2002 placed before the Central Administrative Tribunal in\nTej\n\nKishen Vs. Union of India\n(supra). The decision taken to\n\ncancel the petitioners' allotments and to initiate proceedings\n\nunder the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)\n\nAct, 1971\nwithout making available of alternative shelter clearly\n\nsuggests a drastic change in the government policy so far as\n\nthese IDPs are concerned.\n\n160.\nIn a recent judgment of the Supreme Court reported at\n\nMANU/SC/0476/2010 Sindhu Education Society & Anr. Vs.\n\nThe Chief Secretary, Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.\n, the\n\nSupreme Court observed that framing a policy is the domain of\n\nthe Government. The framework of the policy and the working\n\nof such Government Policy has essentially to be done within the\n\nframework of the Constitution & the laws. As and when\n\nGovernment changes its policy decision, it is expected to give\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 103 of 157\n\nvalid reasons thereof and act in larger interest of the entire\n\ncommunity rather than a section. In para 66 of the judgment,\n\nthe Supreme Court held that :\n\n\"........... It is a settled canon of administrative\njurisprudence that state action, must be supported by\nsome valid reasons and should be upon due\napplication of mind. In the affidavits filed on behalf of\nthe state, nothing in this regard could be pointed out\nand in fact, none was pointed out during the course of\narguments. Absence of reasoning and apparent non-\napplication of mind would give colour of arbitrariness\nto the state action.\"\n\nThe position in the cases in hand is no different. The state\n\ndoes not again even suggest a reasonable explanation or valid\n\nreason for the change from the rehabilitative policy to the\n\ndecision to evict the petitioners and thereby threatening them\n\nwith imminent homelessness\n\n161. The respondents would have the right to change its\n\npolicy upon change in circumstances. (Ref: (1998) 1 SCR\n\n1120 State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Ram Lubhaya Begga &\n\nOrs.). No such change is pointed out in the present cases. The\n\ndecision to treat the petitioners as unauthorized occupants\n\nwithout their resettlement is clearly not premised a change of\n\npolicy upon application of mind and therefore not sustainable.\n\nResponsibility of the Central Government\n\n162. It has been suggested by Mr. Jatan Singh, learned\n\nstanding counsel for the Union of India that the Central\n\nGovernment has no responsibility vis-a-viz the petitioners in the\n\ngiven facts and that only the State of Jammu and Kashmir is\n\nliable for the infraction of the rights of the petitioners.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 104 of 157\n\n163. The submission on behalf of the petitioners on the other\n\nhand is that the duty and responsibility of the state authorities\n\nvis-a-vis these groups of persons which stands recognized and\n\nadmitted by the both the state and Central Government itself.\n\nAs such, the rights of the petitioners cannot be ignored,\n\nimperilled or violated by any of the respondents.\n\n164. It is urged that the respondents have heartily engaged\n\nwith and manifested extreme concern for refugees from other\n\ncountries, but have handled inadequately, and even failed to\n\naddress the difficulties of internally displaced persons.\n\n165. Reference is also made to the policies of regularization of\n\nunauthorized constructions and encroachments on public lands\n\nare pointed out. Several schemes and policies of the\n\nrespondents with regard to the disadvantaged masses so far as\n\nrehabilitation and resettlement is concerned. The attention of\n\nthis court is drawn also to the several judgments concerned with\n\nthe right of shelter of pavement and jhuggi-jhompri dwellers\n\nincluding\nOlga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation &\n\nOrs.\n;\nAhmedabad Municipal Corporation vs. Nawab Khan\n\nGulab Khan & Ors.\n;\nJagdish vs. DDA\n; Sudama Singh &\n\nOrs.vs. Government of Delhi & Anr. which have been\n\nreferred above\n. The petitioners have urged at some length that\n\nthe respondents have shown utter insensitivity not only in\n\nprotecting their rights but even in the pursuit of the matter\n\nbefore this court.\n\n166. The question which begs an answer is having failed to\n\nensure the life and safety of the petitioners or to protect their\n\nproperty, or to guarantee either of them, what would be the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 105 of 157\n\nobligation, duty and responsibility of the respondents qua the\n\npetitioners.\n\n167. It is an admitted fact that the petitioners were all\n\nemployed by the Central Government or its agencies. In order\n\nto avoid compromising the security issues of these persons, a\n\nmore detailed analysis of the factual matrix is not being\n\nundertaken. However, the present cases set out instances of\n\nextreme trauma faced by the petitioners and their family\n\nmembers as well as the continued threat to their life and\n\nproperty. In one of the cases, the petitioner is a destitute lady\n\nwho was working in the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting\n\nof the Government of India used to give live performances and\n\nconducted programs on behalf of the Central Government in\n\nremote villages in the valley as well as on the electronic media\n\nmaking her face known to the militants. Her troupe was\n\nattacked in 1987 while performing at Khamabal in District\n\nAnantnag and they had to flee for their life. In this background,\n\nshe was transferred to Delhi, and was allotted the premises by\n\nthe respondents. The petitioner points out that in mid-1990, the\n\nSongs and Drama Division Office in Srinagar, Kashmir was\n\nblown up and the entire staff transferred to Delhi. Not only the\n\nhouse of her in-laws but her ancestral/parental rental house also\n\nstands burnt down and she has no place to return to in Kashmir.\n\nEven after she was evacuated from the valley, her brother\n\nreceived threats to her life by way of communications advising\n\nthe petitioner to desist from participating or performing in\n\nprograms in support of the Government. This communication\n\nhas been placed on record. The petitioner was deserted by her\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 106 of 157\n\nhusband decades ago and she stands abandoned by the State\n\nwith none to assist to her. The writ petition states that she is\n\ngetting a meager amount of 4500/- as pension, insufficient\n\neven to sustain her, let alone acquiring rights in any property.\n\n168. Another petitioner who was the author and the voice of a\n\nprogramme on the All India Radio in Srinagar division which\n\nbecame popular across the line of control was so targetted by\n\nthe militants. A price for his head was even announced. In one\n\nof the cases, despite the security cover, an attempt was made\n\non the life of the petitioner whose property and belongings\n\nstand looted and gutted in Srinagar and he has no property at\n\nall anywhere in the country. There are other petitioners who\n\nwere working in the intelligence agencies in the state who were\n\nevacuated on emergency basis after their colleagues were shot\n\ndead. Several of the petitioners have lost close friends and\n\nrelatives on account of the attacks by militants.\n\nThe petitioners were targetted because they were the\n\nface of the Central Government in the Kashmir valley and are\n\nunable to return for the same reason.\n\n169. So far as ensuring the right to shelter is concerned, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that the state is deemed to be under an\n\nobligation to secure the same to its citizens [Ref : (1996) 2 SCC\n\n549 Chameli Singh & Ors. vs. State of U.P.(supra), that it is\n\nimperative for the state to provide permanent housing\n\naccommodation to the deprived.\n\n170. In 1995 (2) SLR 72 P.G. Gupta vs. State of Gujarat the\n\nSupreme Court had further declared that it was the duty of the\n\nstate to construct houses at reasonable costs and make them\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 107 of 157\n\neasily accessible to the poor, and that such principles have been\n\nexpressly embodied in our Constitution to ensure socio-\n\neconomic democracy so that everyone has a right to life, liberty\n\nand security of the person.\n\nIn this context, in para 11 of the pronouncement, the court\n\nexpressly laid down the imperative duty of the state to provide\n\npermanent housing accommodation to the poor in the housing\n\nschemes undertaken by it, or its instrumentality and observed\n\nas follows:-\n\n\"11. As stated earlier, the right to residence and\nsettlement is a fundamental right under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\n\nand it is a facet of inseparable meaningful right to life\nunder\nArticle 21.\nFood, shelter and clothing are\nminimal human rights. The State has undertaken as its\neconomic policy of planned development of the country\nand has undertaken massive housing schemes. As its\npart, allotment of houses was adopted, as is enjoined by\nArts. 38, 39 and 46, Preamble and 19(1)(e), facilities and\nopportunities to the weaker sections of the society of the\nright to residence, make the life meaningful and liveable\nin equal status with dignity of person. It is, therefore,\nimperative of the State to provide permanent\nhousing accommodation to the poor in the housing\nschemes undertaken by it or its instrumentalities within\ntheir economic means so that they could make the\npayment of the price in easy instalments and have\npermanent settlement and residence assured under\n\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nand\nof the Constitution. xxxxx\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\n171. The Supreme Court has repeatedly reiterated the well\n\nsettled position that the state has the constitutional duty to\n\nprovide adequate facilities and opportunities to all including the\n\ndisadvantaged and the displaced, by distributing its wealth and\n\nresources for the settlement of life and erection of shelter over\n\ntheir heads. The court has emphasized the constitutional right\n\nof every citizen to migrate and settle in any part of India for\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 108 of 157\n\nbetter employment opportunity and it would be the duty of the\n\nstate to provide right to shelter to the disadvantaged in society.\n\n(Ref :\nAhmedabad Municipal Corporation Vs. Nawab Khan\n\nGulab Khan & Ors.\n(supra).\n\n172. The forcible removal of pavement and slum dwellers by\n\nthe agencies of the state without their resettlement or\n\nrehabilitation has been repeatedly deprecated by the courts in\n\nthe plethora of judgments on the subject. In case they have to\n\nbe evicted from the place they are occupying, state authorities\n\nare bound to formulate schemes and policies. The respondents\n\nhave gone on record with regard to such projects as are in\n\nvogue for their relocation, resettlement and rehabilitation. (Ref:\n\n(\n1985) 3 SCC 545 Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal\n\nCorporation & Ors.\n; (\n1997) 11 SCC 121 Ahmedabad\n\nMunicipal Corporation Vs. Nawab Khan Gulab Khan &\n\nOrs.\n; MANU/DE/9327/2006 Jagdish vs. DDA; decision of this\n\ncourt dated 11th February, 2010 W.P.(C) No. 8904/2009\n\nSudama Singh & Ors.) Placing reliance on the obligations\n\nunder the international instruments, the courts have repeatedly\n\nstated that adequate and reasonable facilities for resettlement\n\nand effective steps taken for rehabilitation have to be made\n\navailable before forcible eviction.\n\n173. An issue involving chakmas who were tribals from\n\nerstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) went to the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case reported at (\n1996) 1 SCC 742 National\n\nHuman Rights Commission vs. State of Arunachal\n\nPradesh Anr. In\nthis case, a public interest litigation was filed\n\nby the National Human Rights Commission seeking\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 109 of 157\n\nenforcement of rights under\nArticle 21\nof the Indian\n\nConstitution, of about 65,000 Chakma/Hajong tribals. It was\n\nalleged that these Chakmas had settled primarily in the State of\n\nArunachal Pradesh and were being persecuted by sections of\n\nthe citizens of the state i.e. the All Arunachal Pradesh Students\n\nUnion referred to as \"AAPSU\" hereafter. It was additionally\n\ncomplained that the applications of the Chakmas under the\n\nCitizenship Act\nand Rules thereunder were not being forwarded\n\nby the State Government for consideration to the Central\n\nGovernment in accordance with law.\n\nIn deciding the matter, the Supreme Court placed citizens\n\nas well as non-citizens on a common platform so far as the\n\nrights under\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution are\n\nconcerned.\n\nSo far as the constitutional and the statutory obligations\n\nof the states to protect the rights of those who reside within the\n\nterritory of that state are concerned, the court observed as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\"20. We are a country governed by the Rule of Law. Our\nConstitution confers certain rights on every human-\nbeing and certain other rights on citizens. Every person\nis entitled to equality before the law and equal\nprotection of the laws. So also, no person can be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according\nto procedure established by law. Thus the State is\nbound to protect the life and liberty of every human-\nbeing, be he a citizen or otherwise, and it cannot permit\nany body or group of persons, e.g., the AAPSU, to\nthreaten the Chakmas to leave the state, failing which\nthey would be forced to do so. No State Government\nworth the name can tolerate such threats by one group\nof person to another group of persons; it is duty bound\nto protect the (Sic) group from such assaults and if it\nfails to do so, it will fail to form its Constitutional as well\nas statutory obligations. Those giving such (Sic) would\nbe liable to be dealt with in accordance with law. The\nState Government must act impartially and carry out its\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 110 of 157\n\nlegal obligations to safeguard the life, health and well-\nbeing of Chakmas residing in the State without being\ninhibited by local politics. Besides, by refusing to\nforward their applications, the Chakmas are denied\nrights, Constitutional and statutory, to be considered for\nbeing registered as citizens of India.\"\n\nThe court considered the factual matrix and prevalent\n\ncircumstances in detail and thereafter issued, inter alia, a writ\n\nof mandamus directing the State of Arunachal Pradesh, to\n\nensure that the life and personal liberty of each and every\n\nChakma residing within the State shall be protected and any\n\nattempt to forcibly evict or drive them out of the State by\n\norganised groups, such as the AAPSU, shall be repelled, if\n\nnecessary by requisitioning the service of para-military or police\n\nforce. The Union of India was directed to provide such\n\nadditional force as is necessary to protect the lives and liberty of\n\nthe Chakmas on the request of the first respondent. The\n\nSupreme Court further directed that the Chakmas shall not be\n\nevicted from their homes except in accordance with law and\n\nshall not be denied domestic life and comfort therein; the State\n\nGovernment was directed to deal with the quit notices and\n\nultimatums issued by the AAPSU and any other group which\n\ntantamounted to threats to the life and liberty of each and every\n\nChakma in accordance with law. The Supreme Court has thus\n\nrecognized the responsibility of the Central Government to\n\nprovide forces to protect the right to life of the threatened\n\npersons.\n\n174. Unlike the Chakmas, the petitioners are IDPs who\n\ncomplain of violation of the same rights and seek redressal\n\nthereof. However, the extreme situation of hardship and\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 111 of 157\n\ndifficulties being faced by the petitioners and other persons\n\nsimilarly placed is no different. The State Government has\n\nbeen unable to protect or secure the life and property of the\n\npetitioners. The Central Government has not been able to\n\nadequately address the several issues which have been raised.\n\nMany of the petitioners had been physically evacuated by the\n\nCentral Government in extreme situations. All the petitioners\n\nwere employees of the Government in Delhi and have\n\nsuperannuated in Delhi. The attempt being made at present is\n\nalso by the Central Government at Delhi is to forcibly evict the\n\npetitioners by taking recourse to statutory provisions.\n\n175. It is the constitutional duty of the state to protect human\n\nrights and the fundamental rights of all persons. The distinction\n\nbetween such rights and legal rights which may require\n\nadjudication in appropriate proceedings has also been\n\nemphasised on several occasions.\n\nIn (1982) 3 SCC 235 People's Union for\nDemocratic\n\nRights & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n, the court observed\n\nthat denial of statutory rights of the labour force, which was a\n\nvulnerable section of the community, tantamounted to breach of\n\ntheir constitutional rights and was therefore enforceable\n\nagainst the government. It was held that it was the duty of the\n\nUnion of India, the Delhi Administration and the DDA to ensure\n\nthat the constitutional obligation towards labour are discharged\n\nby the contractors to whom they had entrusted construction\n\nwork. It was held that the Union of India, Delhi Administration\n\nand DDA cannot fold their hands in despair and become silent\n\nspectators of the breach of constitutional prohibitions being\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 112 of 157\n\ncommitted by their own contractors. In this context, the court\n\nheld as follows :-\n\n\"21. Before leaving this subject, we may point out\nwith all the emphasis at our command that whenever\nany fundamental right, which is enforceable against\nprivate individuals such as, for example a fundamental\nright enacted in\nArticle 17\nor 23 or 24 is being violated,\nit is the constitutional obligation of the State to take the\nnecessary steps for the purpose of interdicting such\nviolation and ensuring observance of the fundamental\nright by the private individual who is transgressing the\nsame. Of course, the person whose fundamental right is\nviolated can always approach the court for the purpose\nof enforcement of his fundamental right, but that cannot\nabsolve the State from its constitutional obligation to\nsee that there is no violation of the fundamental right of\nsuch person, particularly when he belongs to the\nweaker Section humanity and is unable to wage a legal\nbattle against a strong and powerful opponent who is\nexploiting him. The Union of India, the Delhi\nAdministration and the Delhi Development Authority\nmust therefore be held to be under an obligation to\nensure observance of these various labour laws by the\ncontractors and if the provisions of any of these labour\nlaws are violated by the contractors, the petitioners\nindicating the cause of the workmen are entitled to\nenforce this obligation against the Union of India, the\nDelhi Administration and the Delhi Development\nAuthority by filing the present writ petition. The\npreliminary objections urged on behalf of the\nrespondents must accordingly be rejected.\"\n\nThe failure of the state to ensure statutory rights was held\n\nto provide the essential basis for maintaining the writ petition\n\nunder\nArticle 32\nfor enforcing fundamental rights against the\n\nState and its agencies.\n\n176. It is noteworthy that a writ petition was filed in this court\n\nin connection with compensation payable to residents of\n\nKashmir whose property had been destroyed in the disturbances\n\nin Kashmir. The judgment of this court reported at\nAIR 2005\n\nDelhi 110 B.L. Wali & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.\nhas\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 113 of 157\n\nmade observations on this very unacceptable stand of the\n\nGovernment of India in its affidavit which is under\n\nconsideration. These observations before the Court read as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"20. Respondent No.1, Union of India, has also filed\nan affidavit under the signatures of Mr. K.M. Kuti, Under\nSecretary in the said Ministry dealing with the\nDepartment of Jammu & Kashmir affairs. Respondent\nNo.1/UOI by way of the said affidavit effectively washes\nits hands off the matter. It is stated that relief and\nrehabilitation are State subjects. Para 2 of the parawise\nreply may be reproduced to show the stand of the Union\nof India:\n\n\"2. That the averments made in para 2 of the\npetition that UOI is invested with the\nresponsibility to rehabilitate and provide relief to\nthe citizens who suffer as a result of failure of\nstate to protect their life and property is\nmisconceived, incorrect and is denied. The\nanswering respondent respectfully submits that\nLaw and Order as well as Relief and\nRehabilitation are State Subjects. Ministry of\nHome Affairs has the responsibility of providing\nRelief and Rehabilitation to refugees from West\nPakistan (now Pakistan), East Pakistan (now\nBangladesh), Sri Lanka, Tibet and to the\nrepatriated Indian Nationals. Therefore, the\npresent writ petition qua the answering\nrespondent is not maintainable.\"\n\n21. The Government of India, thus, considered its\nresponsibility for providing relief and rehabilitation to\nrefugees, who are not citizens of this country, but not\nto citizens of the country who are refugees in their own\ncountry. The apathy is writ large on its face.\n\n22. There is a vast para para phernelia of military\nand para military personnel in the State of Jammu &\nKashmir of the Central Government. The boundaries of\nthe country are to be protected. The condition in the\nState was so serious that it has been taken as a priority\nissue. The dislocation of persons from the Valley is a\nwell-known undisputed fact. How can the Government\nof India wash its hands of the whole matter and\nabsolve itself of the responsibility for providing a safe\nliving to the citizens of the country?\n\n23.\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India provides for\nthe Fundamental Right of Protection of Life and\nPersonal Liberty. Life cannot be bare existence.\nPersons who are displaced and suffered injury to life\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 114 of 157\n\nand property as a result of terrorism cannot be left\nwithout remedy. It is the duty and responsibility of the\nState to protect its citizens. Citizens like the\npetitioners are victims of environment, which is not\ntheir own creation. The State owes a responsibility to\ncreate an environment for safe and dignified existence\nof the citizens.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThis court rejected the stand of the Government of India\n\nthat the responsibility towards the payment of the compensation\n\nrests with the State Government alone holding as follows:-\n\n\"31.The Government of India cannot also absolve\nitself of the responsibility and is liable to ensure that\nthe State Government remits the amount. A large\namount of funds flow to the State of Jammu &\nKashmir from the Central Government keeping into\nconsideration the disturbed conditions and, thus, the\nCentral Government cannot say that it has no role to\nplay. The State of Jammu & Kashmir is an integral\npart of our country and the writ of the Central\nGovernment runs. In the cases of victims of Charari\nSharief incident, funds have been disbursed out of\nthe Prime Minister Relief Fund to make a package of\nRs.2 lakhs of ex-gratia compensation apart from\nother benefits.\"\n\n177. In this judgment, the court held that what holds true for\n\nloss of life and limb, would hold true for loss of property\n\noccasioned by failure of the State to protect the same. It is\n\nnoteworthy that in the present writ petitions, the petitioners\n\nhave not been deprived of their property and homes in\n\naccordance with law as, for instance, in the case of acquisition\n\nproceedings. The deprivation is a direct result of the failure to\n\ncontrol the violence against the petitioners. The principles\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthe above judgment would apply to the Kashmiri\n\nmigrants on every score. More important is the clear finding\n\nby the court of the responsibility of the Central Government for\n\nthe rehabilitation and relief to the IDPs from Kashmir.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 115 of 157\n\n178. It is unfortunate that despite this adjudication, the stand\n\nwhich was rejected has again been taken in these proceedings.\n\nThis position on behalf of the Central Government in fact\n\nignores the commitments made in legal proceedings noticed\n\nabove.\n\n179. It is noteworthy that the displacement of the petitioners\n\nis also not intra-state. The petitioners have been compelled to\n\nleave the boundaries of their state and are residing in Delhi.\n\n180. The Central Government has acknowledged its\n\nresponsibility in the matter inasmuch it has intervened in the\n\nmatter. Several of the present petitioners stand evacuated by it\n\nand the allotments of the quarters in the instant case stand\n\nmade it. Central resources are being utilized for development\n\nprojects and security purposes in the state and admittedly the\n\nCentral Government has accepted and assumed responsibility\n\ntowards rehabilitation and resettlement of the persons displaced\n\nas well in the grants and reservation made by it.\n\n181. It was observed in (1978) 1 SCR 1 State of Rajasthan\n\n& Ors. vs. UOI by Chief Justice Beg that :-\n\n\"In our country national planning involves disbursements\nof vast amounts of money collected as taxes from citizens\nresiding in all the States and placed at the disposal of\nthe Central Government for the benefits of the States\nwithout even the \"conditional grants\" mentioned above.\nHence, the manner in which State Government function\nand deal with sums placed at their disposal by the Union\nGovernment or how they carry on the general\nadministration may also be matters of considerable\nconcern to the Union Government.\"\n\n182. The expansion and interpretation by the courts has\n\naffirmatively established a positive right to housing and shelter\n\nfor every person as part of the fundamental right. Human\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 116 of 157\n\nrights and fundamental rights are inalienable; their violations\n\nare indefeasible. The state is under a constitutional obligation\n\nand duty to protect these rights. When violated, a citizen is\n\nentitled to their enforcement. The constitutional mandate upon\n\nit, is coupled with the statutory duty and public law obligations\n\nto ensure the protection of the fundamental and basic human\n\nrights to all, in addition to its obligation under the several\n\ninternational instruments noticed above. This essentially\n\nremains in the exclusive domain of state functions. Failure to\n\nprotect the citizens from eminent loss of life and property as\n\nwell as maintenance of public order, implicates the state for\n\nculpable inaction.\n\n183. Mr. Jatan Singh, learned standing counsel for the Union\n\nof India has urged that these petitioners are not public servants\n\nand can claim no right to continue in the allotted public\n\npremises. It has been vehemently urged that on account of\n\ntheir superannuation, they ceased to be Government servants\n\nand are disentitled to retain Government accommodation.\n\nLearned Standing Counsel has urged at some length that the\n\nGovernment of India has formulated a rehabilitation package\n\nwhich necessitates that all these petitioners must return to their\n\nhomes in Kashmir. It is contended that by their failure to\n\nvacate, the rights of the several Government employees who are\n\nwaiting to be allotted Government accommodation are adversely\n\neffected. Unfortunately the respondents are unable to submit\n\nthat the petitioners would be safe upon return or how the\n\nrespondents propose to ensure protection of life and liberty of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 117 of 157\n\nthe petitioners or ensure restoration of their property in the\n\nKashmir valley.\n\n184. Before the Supreme Court of India, the respondents have\n\naccepted responsibility and obligation to the IDPs from Kashmir\n\nand claimed to have advanced huge grants to the State of\n\nJammu Kashmir and also set out a detailed scheme in the\n\naffidavit filed before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the instant case given the nature and extent of the\n\nviolations, the Union of India cannot abdicate responsibility in\n\nthe matter, or avoid its constitutional obligation of at least\n\nensuring reasonable shelter or a roof to these petitioners.\n\nFinancial stringency of the Government\n\n185. Placing reliance on the judgment reported at (\n2005) 6\n\nSCC 138 Master Marine Services Pvt. Ltd. vs. Metcalfe and\n\nHodgkinson Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.\n, it has been further argued by\n\nMr. Jatan Singh that this court is bound to exercise judicial\n\nrestraint and cannot be unmindful of the administrative burden\n\nand increase in unbudgeted expenditure on account of quashing\n\ndecisions. It is urged that in this background, while exercising\n\npower of judicial review of an administrative decision, the court\n\ncannot substitute its own decision without the necessary\n\nexpertise and compel the respondents to exercise discretion to\n\npermit the petitioner to continue to occupy the aforenoticed\n\naccommodation.\n\n186. This submission fails to consider the nature of the rights\n\nwhich are involved in the case in hand.\nMetcalfe Hodgkinson\n\nPvt. Ltd.\n(supra) related to a challenge to award of a tender\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 118 of 157\n\nand contract of work of professional services to the appellant\n\nand was not concerned with a plea of violation of basic human\n\nrights and constitutional guarantees as are involved in the\n\ninstant case.\n\nThe consideration in\nMetcalfe Hodgkinson Pvt.\n\nLtd.\n(supra) has no application to the present case.\n\n187. In (2003) 6 SCC 1 Kapila Hingorani vs. State of\n\nBihar & Ors. the State Government had, however, pleaded\n\nfinancial stringency to shift its liability to the Union of India or\n\nto the State of Jharkhand. In para 67 of the judgment dated 9 th\n\nof May, 2003 Supreme Court had held that the liability of the\n\nstate of Bihar cannot be shifted to the Union of India only\n\nbecause it is the repository of funds raised by it through excise\n\nand other central levies and impost, and consequently it would\n\nnot be indirectly or vicariously liable for the failings on the part\n\nof the State Public Sector Undertakings. It was held that either\n\nprecedentially or jurisprudentially, the Union of India cannot be\n\nheld liable and no such direction as was being sought by the\n\nstate government could be issued.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, clearly declared the\n\nposition that financial stringency may not be a ground for not\n\nissuing requisite directions when a question of violation of\n\nfundamental right arises.\nIn this regard, the court noticed the\n\nemphasis given by it on this aspect including the judgments\n\nreported at [1987]\n1SCR641 Rural Litigation and\n\nEntitlement Kendra and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n\nand Ors.\n; 1980CriLJ1075 Municipal Council, Ratlam vs.\n\nVardichan & Ors.; [1996]\n3SCR80 B.L. Wadhera v. Union\n\nof India\n; (\n1995)4SCC507 State of H.P. v. H.P. State\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 119 of 157\n\nRecognised & Aided Schools Managing Committees and\n\nOrs.\n; AIR 1996 SC 2426 Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor\n\nSaimiti & Ors. vs. State of West Bengal & Anr.]\n\nIn para 65 of (2003) 6 SCC 1 entitled\nKapila\n\nHingorani Vs. State of Bihar & ors\n, the Court rejected the\n\ncontention of the State of Bihar also to this effect.\n\n188.\nIn para 6 at page 589 of (\n1993) 3 SCC 584 All India\n\nImam Organisation vs. UOI\n, the Supreme Court held that:-\n\n\"6....Much was argued on behalf of the Union and\nthe Wakf Boards that their financial position was not\nsuch that they can meet the obligations of paying the\nImams as they are being paid in the State of Punjab. It\nwas also urged that the number of mosques is so large\nthat it would entail heavy expenditure which the Boards\nof different States would not be able to bear. We do not\nfind any correlation between the two. Financial\ndifficulties of the institution cannot be above\nfundamental right of a citizen. If the Boards have\nbeen entrusted with the responsibility of supervising\nand administering the Wakf then it is their duty to\nharness resources to pay those persons who perform\nthe most important duty namely of leading community\nprayer in a mosque the very purpose for which is\ncreated.\"\n\n189. On the same issue in (\n1995) 4 SCC 507 State of H.P.\n\nvs. H.P. State Recognised & Aided Schools Managing\n\nCommittees\n, the Supreme Court observed that:-\n\n\"16. The constitutional mandate to the State, as\nupheld by this Court in\nUnni Krishnan\ncase - to provide\nfree education to the children up to the age of fourteen\n\n- cannot be permitted to be circumvented on the\nground of lack of economic capacity or financial\nincapacity.\"\n\n190. The observations of the Supreme Court at (2005) 2 SCC\n\n262 Kapila Hingorani vs. State of Bihar & Others, while\n\ndismissing the review petition filed by the Bihar Government,\n\nseeking a review of the earlier order dated 9th May, 2003 are\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 120 of 157\n\nalso topical on this objection of the respondents and need to be\n\nconsidered. The State of Bihar had submitted that the state had\n\nno liability to pay the salaries of the employees of the statutory\n\ncorporations/companies incorporated under the\nIndian\n\nCompanies Act\nand that they were not completely under the\n\ncontrol of the State. Before the Supreme Court, counsel for the\n\nState of Bihar had urged that the remedy of the employee was\n\nto file appropriate applications before the Company Judge who\n\nwas seized of the winding up proceedings in relation to such\n\ncompany.\n\nThese submissions were rejected by court observing that\n\nin the order dated 9th May, 2003., the court had considered the\n\nmatter from the human rights aspect as well as the fundamental\n\nrights of the employees in the public sector undertaking\n\noperating in the state of Bihar. The court noticed that after the\n\npassing of the order dated 9th May, 2003, several employees\n\ndied due to non-payment of their salaries. The court placed\n\nreliance, inter alia on para 24 of the directions dated 9th May,\n\n2003 and while rejecting the review petition filed by the\n\nrespondents observed as follows :-\n\n\"24. This Court further observed that the State\nhas a constitutional obligation and acts in a fiduciary\ncapacity vis-à-vis performance of its constitutional\nduties and functions by the public sector\nundertakings as it has constitutional obligations in\nrelation thereto.\"\n\n(Underlining supplied)\n\nSo far as protection of such human rights and\n\nfundamental rights, and remedy for violation thereof, is\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 121 of 157\n\nconcerned, the court issued directions to the state government\n\nto pay the salaries of employees in the public sector\n\nundertakings in the following terms :-\n\n\"22. ......\n\nThe Government companies/public sector\nundertakings being 'States' would be constitutionally\nliable to respect life and liberty of all persons in terms\nof\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. They,\ntherefore, must do so in cases of their own employees.\nThe Government of the State of Bihar for all intent and\npurport is the sole shareholder. Although in law, its\nliability towards the debtors of the Company may be\nconfined to the shares held by it but having regard to\nthe deep and pervasive control it exercises over the\nGovernment companies; in the matter of enforcement\nof human rights and/or rights of the citizen of life and\nliberty, the State has also an additional duty to see that\nthe rights of employees of such corporations are not\ninfringed.\n\nThe right to exercise deep and pervasive control\nwould in its turn make the Government of Bihar liable\nto see that the life and liberty clause in respect of the\nemployees is fully safeguarded. The Government of the\nState of Bihar, thus, had a constitutional obligation to\nprotect life and liberty of the employees of the\nGovernment owned companies/corporations who are\nthe citizens of India. It had an additional liability having\nregard to its right of extensive supervision over the\naffairs of the company.\"\n\nxxx\n\n37. We make it clear that we have not issued\naforementioned directions to the States of Bihar and\nJharkhand on the premise that they are bound to pay\nthe salaries of the employees of the public sector\nundertakings but on the ground that the employees\nhave a human right as also a fundamental right\nunder\nArticle 21\nwhich the States are bound to\nprotect. The directions, which have been issued by this\nCourt on 9th May, 2003 as also which are being issued\nherein, are in furtherance of the human and\nfundamental rights of the employees concerned and not\nby way of an enforcement of their legal right to arrears\nof salaries. The amount of salary payable to the\nconcerned employees or workmen would undoubtedly\nbe adjudicated upon in the proper proceedings.\nHowever, these directions are issued which are\nnecessary for their survival. Undoubtedly, any amount\npaid by Justice Uday Sinha Committee pursuant to\nthese directions shall be duly credited for.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 122 of 157\n\n191. The principle reiterated by the Supreme Court was that\n\nfinancial difficulties of the institution or the state cannot be\n\nabove the fundamental rights of the citizen. It has also been\n\nobserved that in a situation of the nature which was before the\n\ncourt, it was obliged to issue necessary directions to mitigate\n\nthe extreme hardship of the employees involving of human\n\nrights of the citizens of the country at the hands of the state\n\ngovernment and companies and corporations owned and\n\ncontrolled by it.\n\n192. Other than the bald reference to the judgment in\n\nMetcalfe\n(supra), learned standing counsel has placed no\n\nfactual assertions in support thereof.\n\nSuch submission is clearly\n\nuntenable in view of the admitted Government position in the\n\naffidavit dated 6th October, 2009 filed in\nJ.K. Koul\n(supra)\n\nbefore the Supreme Court of its responsibility as well as liability\n\nqua the displaced Kashmiris.\nThe same stands admitted in the\n\ndiscretion exercised in favour of the three persons cited in Tej\n\nKishan (supra) and the letter dated 2nd July, 2002 placed\n\nbefore the Central Administrative Tribunal as also in the policy\n\nof reservation/preferential allotment of the flats. The\n\nrespondents have clearly admitted their responsibility and are\n\nbound by their commitments.\n\n193. Before this court, the respondents have not stated that\n\nthere is any assessment or calibration in terms of priorities of\n\nthe various of the several projects which the respondents need\n\nundertake or the various areas which Government business\n\naddresses. The respondents explain neither the financial\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 123 of 157\n\nburden of ensuring shelter to these IDPs nor the extent of the\n\navailable resource. Mere announcement of schemes and\n\nallocation of large volume of funds by the Government as a\n\nreaction to court directions upon occurrence of events in the\n\ncountry by themselves are insufficient and may prove to be\n\nmeaningless. Displacement as that of the present petitioners\n\nclearly reflects the imperative to take a holistic view and for the\n\ndecision makers to take a 'minimum-needs' based approach\n\nwhere ensuring basic human rights and social welfare are\n\nconcerned.\n\n194. Experience and examples abound in this city and the\n\naforenoticed judicial precedents of forcible evictions relating to\n\nslums and jhuggi dwellers. Defenceless and disadvantaged\n\ncitizens are forcibly evicted from their shelters which are then\n\ndestroyed. And then, the long arm of the state, gives a hyper\n\ntechnical interpretation to legal definitions, takes the shield of\n\nstatutory provisions and implements what is touted as the \"rule\n\nof law\" in removal of \"encroachments\" by the disadvantaged.\n\nOthers illegal constructions and deviants are \"regularised\" or\n\n\"compounded\". This very ethos is illustrated in the present writ\n\npetitions.\n\n195. Instance after instance of schemes in Delhi for\n\nregularising not only rank illegal and unauthorised\n\nconstructions but also large scale encroachments on public land\n\nare in existence and being implemented. So much so that the\n\nCentral Government has promulgated ordinances and statutes\n\nprohibitting demolitions of huge illegal buildings and even\n\ninterdicting court orders. Interestingly such legislations benefit\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 124 of 157\n\nsuch law breakers who do not even need rehabilitation or state\n\nsupport, who are certainly not disadvantaged or displaced.\nThe\n\nDelhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006\nwas enacted by the\n\nParliament concerned that action for violation of the provisions\n\nof the Master Plan 2001 and building bye laws was causing\n\nhardship and irreparable loss to a large number of people. No\n\nreference to public safety, public interest, environment\n\nconcerns, enforcement of legal provisions or the financial\n\nimpact and loss is displayed.\n\n196. The judgment reported at 2010 (\nIII) AD (Delhi) 513\n\nHarijan Kalyan Samiti Regd. & Ors. vs. Government of\n\nNCT of Delhi\nmakes a reference to Government policy to\n\nregularise 1400 unauthorised colonies. The huge loss to the\n\npublic exchequer of indiscriminately regularising illegal\n\nencroachments on land acquired after payment of large sums as\n\ncompensation from public funds by the government;\n\nencroachments those on public land as also violations of\n\nbuilding regulations is not even computed, let alone addressed.\n\n(Ref: (2006) 3 SCC 399 M.C. Mehta vs. UOI & Ors.;\nAIR\n\n2005 SC 1 Friends Colony Development Committee vs.\n\nState of Orissa & Ors\n.)\n\n197. Yet the respondents urge \"financial stringency\" so far as\n\nthe present petitioners are concerned. The essence of the\n\npolicy of rehabilitation and resettlement, so far as the\n\npetitioners is concerned has not only been given a complete go\n\nby but the respondents are completely denying all liability for\n\nthe same.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 125 of 157\n\n198. Apart from a vague suggestion of insufficiency of funds,\n\nthe respondents do not substantiate such plea with any\n\nmaterial. The respondents have not shown any consideration of\n\nthe petitioners' needs, let alone any steps take to address their\n\nplight. There is nothing which could enable this court to arrive\n\nat a conclusion that the respondents had difficulty in working\n\nthe rights of the petitioners on account of financial incapacity.\n\nTo say the least, similar submissions were termed as \"typically\n\ngauche\" and \"lacking insensitivity\" by this court in\nP.K.\n\nHandoo vs. Estate Officer\n(supra) and already stand rejected\n\nin\nB.L. Wali & Ors. vs. UOI\n(supra). The impugned action\n\nand the submissions manifests the huge barriers which a\n\ndisplaced citizen of the country faces in accessing even basic\n\nand guaranteed constitutional rights despite the admitted\n\nresponsibility of the state for the breaches and violations of the\n\nconstitutional protections suffered by them.\n\nAppropriate remedy, role of the court and nature of relief\n\n199. It is now necessary to consider the nature of remedy and\n\nrelief which would be available to a citizen for violation of the\n\nfundamental right to life as well as threat thereto. The\n\nSupreme Court has repeatedly judicially awarded compensation\n\nin cases of established breach of public duty to protect the\n\nfundamental rights and violations thereof, especially the\n\nguarantees of personal liberty and life.\n\n200. In AIR 1983 SC 1086 Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar ,\n\nthe court was concerned with violation of rights resulting from\n\nillegal detention. The observations of the court on the duty of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 126 of 157\n\nthe court deserve to be considered in extenso and read as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\"10. .........\nArticle 21\n, which guarantees the\nright to life and liberty will be denuded of its\nsignificant content if the power of this Court were\nlimited to passing orders of release from illegal\ndetention. One of the telling ways in which the\nviolation of that right can reasonably be prevented\nand due compliance with the mandate of\nArticle 21\n\nsecured, is to mulct its violators in the payment of\nmonetary compensation. Administrative sele(sic)sis\nleading to flagrant infringements of fundamental\nrights cannot be corrected by any other method\nopen to the judiciary to adopt. The right to\ncompensation is some palliative for the unlawful\nacts of instrumentalities which act in the name of\npublic interest and which present for their\nprotection the powers of the State as a shield. If\ncivilisation is not to perish in this country, as it has\nperished in some others too well-known to suffer\nmention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into\naccepting that, respect for the rights of individuals\nis the true bastion of democracy. Therefore, the\nState must repair the damage done by its officers to\nthe petitioner's rights.\"\n\n201. So far as the remedy which would be available in cases\n\ninvolving infringement of fundamental rights and the power of\n\ncourts, Dr. A.S. Anand, J [as his Lordship then was] in his\n\nconcurring judgment in AIR 1993 SC 1960 entitled\nNilabati\n\nBehara @ Lalita Behura Vs. State of Orissa\nhad observed as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\"33. The public law proceedings serve a different\npurpose than the private law proceedings. The relief\nof monetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in\nproceedings under\nArticle 32\nby this Court or under\n\nArticle 226\nby the High Courts, for established\ninfringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution is a remedy\navailable in public law and is based on the strict\nliability for contravention of the guaranteed basic and\nindefeasible rights of the citizen. The purpose of\npublic law is not only to civilize public power but also\nto assure the citizen that they live under a legal\nsystem which aims to protect their interests and\npreserve their rights. Therefore, when the court\nmoulds the relief by granting \"compensation\" in\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 127 of 157\n\nproceedings under\nArticle 32\nor 226 of the\nConstitution seeking enforcement or protection of\nfundamental rights, it does so under the public law by\nway of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the\nliability for the public wrong on the State which has\nfailed in its public duty to protect the fundamental\nrights of the citizen. The payment of compensation in\nsuch cases is not to be understood, as it is generally\nunderstood in a civil action for damages under the\nprivate law but in the broader sense of providing\nrelief by an order of making `monetary amends' under\nthe public law for the wrong done due to breach of\npublic duty of not protecting the fundamental rights\nof the citizen. The compensation is in the nature of\n`exemplary damages' awarded against the wrongdoer\nfor the breach of its public law duty and is\nindependent of claim compensation under the private\nlaw in an action based on tort, through a suit\ninstituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or/and\nprosecute the offender under the penal law.\n\nxxx xxx xxxx\n\n37. This Court and the High Courts,\nbeing the protectors of the civil liberties of the\ncitizen, have not only the power and jurisdiction\nbut also an obligation to grant relief in exercise\nof its jurisdiction under\nArticles 32\nand\nof\nthe Constitution to the victim or the heir of the\nvictim whose fundamental rights under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India are established to\nhave been flagrantly infringed by calling upon\nthe State to repair the damage done by its\nofficers to the fundamental rights of the citizen,\nnotwithstanding the right of the citizen to the remedy\nby way of a civil suit or criminal proceedings. The\nState, of course has the right to be indemnified by\nand take such action as may be available to it against\nthe wrongdoer in accordance with law - through\nappropriate proceedings. Of course, relief in exercise\nof the power under\nArticle 32\nor 226 would be\ngranted only once it is established that there has been\nan infringement of the fundamental rights of the\ncitizen and no other form of appropriate redressal by\nthe court in the facts and circumstances of the case,\nis possible.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n202.\nIn (\n1988) 4 SCC Sheela Barse vs. UOI & Ors.\n, the\n\ncourt was concerned with gross violations of the constitutional\n\nand statutory rights of a large number of children in the country\n\nwho were suffering custodial restraints. While commenting on\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 128 of 157\n\nthe nature of proceedings in public interest litigation and the\n\nissue of protection and enforcement of their rights, the court\n\nmade the following observations with regard to the duty of the\n\ncourt :-\n\n\"6. ........More importantly the Court is not\nmerely a passive, disinterested umpire or\nonlooker, but has a more dynamic and positive\nrole with the responsibility for the organisation\nof the proceedings, moulding of the relief and--\nthis is important -- also supervising the\nimplementation thereof.\"\n\n203. Where infringement of fundamental rights is established,\n\nthe duty of the court does not stop at giving a mere declaration.\n\nIn 1997 (\n1) SCC 416 D.K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal\n, it\n\nwas laid down that in such a case, the court must proceed\n\nfurther and give compensatory relief, not by way of damages as\n\na civil action but by way of compensation under the public law\n\njurisdiction for the wrong done, due to breach of the public duty\n\nby the State of not protecting the fundamental right to life of\n\nthe citizens. To repair the wrong done and give judicial redress\n\nfor legal injury is a compulsion of judicial conscience.\n\n204. Unlike the several cases noted hereinabove including\n\ncases of\nRudul Shah, D.K. Basu, Leelawati Behura, Sheela\n\nBarse\n(supra) etc. in the instant case, the state or its\n\ninstrumentalities itself have not harmed or punished the\n\npetitioners. However, the state has totally failed to protect the\n\nfundamental right to life of the petitioners and to protect them\n\nfrom violence, harassment and pogroms. This is in clear\n\nabdication of the constitutional responsibility of the State.\n\nResponsibility for the violence in the State is not the question\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 129 of 157\n\nbefore this court. The issue before this court is restricted to the\n\nquestion of the rights of the petitioner.\n\n205. So far as the approach of a court on such issues is\n\nconcerned, in para 13 of the pronouncement reported at (\n2003)\n\n4 SCC 601 State of Maharashtra vs. Dr. D. Praful B. Desai\n,\n\nthe Supreme Court stated that one needs to set out the\n\napproach which a court must adopt in deciding such questions\n\nand reiterated that the first duty of the court is to do justice.\n\n206. In para 15 of AIR 1980 SC 1622 Municipal Council,\n\nRatlam vs. Vardichan & Ors., the court observed that:-\n\n\"15. ......... The nature of the judicial process is\nnot purely adjudicatory nor is it functionally that of an\numpire only. Affirmative action to make the remedy\neffective is of the essence of the right which otherwise\nbecomes sterile.\"\n\n207. In para 11 of (1997) 6 SCC 241 Vishakha & Ors. vs.\n\nState of Rajasthan & Ors., the Supreme Court held that the\n\nobligation of the Supreme Court under\nArticle 32\nof the\n\nConstitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights in the\n\nabsence of legislation must be viewed along with the role of\n\njudiciary envisaged in the Beijing Statement of Principles of the\n\nIndependence of the Judiciary in the LAWASIA region. These\n\nprinciples were accepted by the Chief Justices of the Asia and\n\nthe Pacific at Beijing in 1995 as those representing the\n\nminimum standards necessary to be observed in order to\n\nmaintain the independence and effective functioning of the\n\njudiciary. The objectives of the judiciary mentioned in the\n\nBeijing Statement are:\n\n\"Objectives of the Judiciary:\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 130 of 157\n\n10. The objectives and functions of the\njudiciary include the following:\n\n(a) to ensure that all persons are\nable to live securely under the Rule\nof Law;\n\n(b) to promote, within the proper\nlimits of the judicial function, the\nobservance and the attainment of\nhuman rights; and\n\n(c) to administer the law impartially\namong persons and between\npersons and the State.\"\n\nIn Clause 10(a) of the objectives of the Chapter on\n\n'Objectives of the Judiciary', it has been clearly stipulated that\n\nthe objectives and functions of the judiciary include ensuring\n\nthat all persons are able to live securely under the rule of law.\n\n208. So far as the manner in which relief is required to be\n\nmoulded so as to ensure protection of the constitutional rights\n\nof the petitioners in this bunch of writ petitions are concerned,\n\nlearned counsel for petitioner has placed reliance on the\n\npronouncement of this court dated 10th September, 2004 in\n\nWP(C) No. 172/1997 entitled\nSmt. Kamla Devi vs. Govt. of\n\nNCT of Delhi & Ors. In\nthis judgment, learned brother B.D.\n\nAhmed, J was dealing with a case relating to a prayer for\n\ncompensation for the death of one Uday Singh, an electrician\n\nwho was killed in an explosion on account of terrorist activity in\n\nDelhi.\n\nThe court held that lower courts would lose their efficacy\n\nif they cannot possibly respond to the needs of the society -\n\ntechnicalities there might be many but the justice-oriented\n\napproach ought to not be thwarted on the basis of such\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 131 of 157\n\ntechnicality since technicality cannot and ought not to outweigh\n\nthe course of justice.\n\n209. While referring to several pronouncements of the Apex\n\nCourt with regard to compensation for custodial death; death of\n\nschool children on a picnic; death of a passenger in a train in\n\naction on the part of the railway employees, it was further\n\nobserved in\nKamla Devi\n's case (supra) as follows :-\n\n\"7. xxx\nThe fact of the matter is that Uday Singh lost his\nlife on account of an act of terrorism. The State failed\nto prevent it. The Primary duty of the State is to\nmaintain peace and harmony amongst its citizens. If\nfor some reason, it is unable to put the lid on\nsimmering discontent, then it is its duty to protect\ninnocent citizens from harm. If it fails in this duty,\nthen it must compensate the citizens who have been\nwronged.\"\n\nReliance was placed on the pronouncement in\nAIR 1993\n\nSC 1960 Nilabati Behara @ Lalita Behura Vs. State of\n\nOrissa\nwherein it had been also observed that while directing\n\nmonetary compensation for established infringement of the\n\nfundamental rights, the courts take into account not only the\n\ninterest of the applicant and the respondent but also the\n\ninterests of the public as a whole with a view to ensure that\n\npublic bodies or officials do not act unlawfully and do perform\n\ntheir public duties properly particularly where the fundamental\n\nright of a citizen under\nArticle 21\nis concerned. Law is in the\n\nprocess of development and the process necessitates developing\n\nseparate public law procedures as also public law principles.\n\n210. In AIR 1989 Mad. 205\nR. Gandhi & Ors. vs. UOI &\n\nAnr.\n, the Madras High court was concerned with the inability of\n\nthe State to enforce public order putting in jeopardy the life and\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 132 of 157\n\nliberty, home and hearth of the victims involved. The petition\n\nsought redressal for the trials and tribulations undergone by the\n\nminority Sikh community of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and a\n\nfew others in the wake of the assassination of late Prime\n\nMinister Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31st October, 1984.\n\nObserving\n\non the violation of the fundamental rights and the duty of the\n\nstate, the Madras High Court placed reliance on the\n\nobservations of the Supreme Court in the\nOlga Tellis\n(supra)\n\ncase, and held as follows:-\n\n\"21. The maintenance of law and order is the\nprimary duty of the State and under our Constitution\nit is a State subject and tops the State List. No\nGovernment worth the name can abdicate this\nfunction and put the life and liberty, the hearth and\nhome of the citizens in jeopardy.\nArticle 38\nof the\nConstitution enjoins on the State to strive to promote\nthe welfare of the people by securing and protecting,\nas effectively as it may, a social order in which justice,\nsocial, economic and political, shall inform all the\ninstitutions of the national life. Under\nArticle 19(a)\n\nand (g) of the Constitution, any citizen of this country\nis entitled to reside and settle in any part of the\nTerritory of India and to practice any profession or to\ncarry on any occupation, trade or business.\nArticle 21\n\nlays down that no person-shall be deprived of his right\nor personal liberty except according to the procedure\nestablished by law. As pointed out by the Supreme\nCourt in\nBombay Pavement Dweller\n's case,\nMANU/SC/0039/1985 : AIR1986SC180 , no person\ncan live without the means of living, that is, the\nmeans of livelihood and the easiest way of depriving a\nperson of his right to life would be to deprive him of\nhis means of livelihood to the point of abrogation.\nUnder\nArticle 300(A)\nof the Constitution, no person\nshall be deprived of his property save by authority of\nlaw and to allow his properties to be reduced to ashes\nby the force of darkness and evil is a clear deprivation\nof the right to property guaranteed by the\nConstitution. The members of the Sikh Community\nform an integral part of the Indian society; they have\nevery right to settle down in Coimbatore and carry on\ntheir profession. They have the Constitutional right to\nlive and they cannot be deprived of their means of\nlivelihood. Their right to property is inviolable. All\nthese Constitutional rights of the Sikhs and a few\nmembers of the other communities have been\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 133 of 157\n\nflagrantly infringed by the inaction of the law\nenforcing authorities. Fundamental rights are not\nmere brutum fulmen. They are the throbbing\naspirations and realities of civilised human life, they\ncannot be rendered desuetude or dead-letter or as\nobserved by Bhagwati, J. as he then was, 'a paper\nparchment, a teasing illusion and a promise of\nunreality', by the failure of the State to protect those\nrights. These unfortunate victims of arson and\nviolence are, therefore, entitled to seek reasonable\ncompensation from the State of Tamil Nadu, which\nhas failed in its duty to protect their Constitutional\nand legal rights.\n\n22. ......It is a matter of regret that the State of\nTamil Nadu, which has failed to carry out its\nelementary function of enforcing public order should\ntreat the victims of its own lapses as beggars with\nbowls for alms. It is not charity that is expected of the\nGovernment, but legal recompense for wrongs done\nto them, for injuries inflicted on them on account of\nthe break-down of the Governmental machinery. The\nsecond respondent-- State of Tamil Nadu cannot,\ntherefore, shirk its responsibility for these\nunfortunate happenings or try to escape from its\nobligation as a social welfare State to make\nsuitable amends.\"\n\n(underlining supplied)\n\n211. Examining the claim for compensation on account of death\n\nof a spouse in similar riots targeting members of the same\n\ncommunity in Delhi in 1984, Anil Dev Singh, J in the judgment\n\nreported at 1996 (3) AD (Delhi) 333 : 1996 (38) DRJ 203\n\nBhajan Kaur vs. Delhi Admn. has observed as follows:-\n\n\"(10)\nArticle 21\nis the Nation's commitment to\nbring every individual or group of persons within its\nprotective fold. This Nation belongs to members of all\nthe communities. They arc equal members of the Indian\nsociety. Equality before law and equal protection of\nlaws is ensured to them by\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution to them. None is to be favoured or\ndiscredited. The conduct of any person or group of\npersons has to be controlled by the State for the lofty\npurpose enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. It is\nthe duty of the State to create a climate where the\ncleavage between members of the society belonging to\ndifferent faiths, caste and creed are eradicated. The\nState must act in time so that the precious lives of the\npeople are not destroyed or threatened. Otherwise,\n\nArticle 21\nwill remain a paper guarantee. Time is long\noverdue for adopting measures that have more than a\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 134 of 157\n\nhortatory effect in enforcing\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. The State cannot adopt a \"do nothing\naltitude\". Like disease prevention, the State must take\nevery precaution, measure and initiative to prevent\nterrorem populi of the magnitude represented by 1984\nriots and in the event of an outbreak of riots it must act\nswiftly to curb the same and not allow precious time to\nslip by, as any inaction or passivity on its part can\nresult in loss of precious life and liberty of individuals\namounting to violation and negation of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. The State has to enforce minimum\nstandards of civilized behavior of its citizens so that the\nlife, liberty, dignity and worth of an individual is\nprotected and preserved and is not jeopardised or\nendangered. If it is not able to do all that then it cannot\nescape the liability to pay adequate compensation to\nthe family of the person killed during riots as his or her\nlife has been extinguished in clear violation of\nArticle\nof the Constitution which mandates that life cannot\nbe taken away except according to the procedure\nestablished by law. \"\n\nIt is noteworthy that in para 25, the learned Judge in\n\nBhajan Kaur‟s case, was of the view that the judicial trend is to\n\naward substantial compensation for illegal extinction or\n\ndeprivation of life and liberty.\n\n212. I had also occasion to consider a claim for compensation\n\nfor injuries and loss suffered by the petitioner in the 1984 riots\n\nin Delhi in the aftermath of the assassination of late Smt. Indira\n\nGandhi in which members of one community were targetted.\nIn\n\nthe judgment reported at 120 (\n2005) DLT 156 Manjit Singh\n\nSawhney vs. UOI & Ors.\n, placing reliance on the principles\n\nlaid down in\nthe aforenoticed pronouncements, it had been\n\nobserved as follows :-\n\n\"20. The award of monetary relief to the victim for\ndeprivation of fundamental right is to be guided by the\naforestated principle requiring the state to make\nmonetary amends under public law for the wrong done\ndue to breach of the public duty of not protecting the\nfundamental rights of the citizens. This computation is\nnot guided by any strict arithmetical formula and it has\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 135 of 157\n\nto be borne in mind that money cannot remove the\ntrauma and the battering suffered by a victim.\"\n\n213. The observations of the Supreme Court in\nAIR 1981 SC\n\n487 Ajay Hasia vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors.\nare also\n\nclassical and topical on this aspect and shed light on the issue\n\nunder consideration as follows :-\n\n\"Where constitutional fundamentals vital to the\nmaintenance of human rights are at stake, functional\nrealism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic\ntool, for constitutional law must seek the substance and\nnot the form..... It must be remembered that the\nfundamental rights are constitutional guarantees given'\nto the people of India, and : are not merely paper hopes\nor fleeting promises and so long as they find a place in\nthe Constitution, they should not be allowed to be\nemasculated in their application by a narrow and\nconstricted judicial interpretation. The Courts should\nbe anxious to enlarge the scope and width of the\nFundamental Rights by bringing within their sweep\nevery authority which is an instrumentality or agency\nof the Government or through the corporate personality\nof which the Government is acting, so as to subject the\nGovernment in all its myriad activities, whether\nthrough natural persons or through corporate entities,\nto the basic obligations of the Fundamental Rights.\"\n\n214. It is a well settled principle of interpretation of the\n\nconstitution as well as statutes that the same have to be read\n\nkeeping the societal changes and growth. Law must change to\n\nkeep pace with the on going developments and new rights may\n\nhave to be found out within the constitutional scheme. (Ref :\n\n(\n2003) 6 SCC 1 Kapila Hingorani vs. State of Bihar\n(para\n\n60 at page 30). The imperative necessity to take recourse to\n\ntake such interpretative changes by the courts has resulted in\n\nthe expansion to the right to life ensured under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\nThe court relied on earlier judgments and reiterated\n\nthat the first duty of the court is to do justice. In para 62, the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 136 of 157\n\nSupreme Court also declared that the right to development in\n\nthe developing country is itself a human right.\n\n215. The duty to ensure constitutional rights rests not only\n\non the Supreme Court or the High Court in exercise of\n\njurisdiction under\nArticle 32\nand\nbut would be the mandate\n\nof every court and its essential judicial function. The claims\n\nin the present cases have to be adjudicated on these principles.\n\n216.\nIn\nP.K. Koul\n(supra), a specific order was passed on 15th\n\nOctober, 2003 in W.P.(C) No. 6551/2003 by this court to decide\n\nthe petitioner‟s representation dated 16th January, 2003 seeking\n\npermission to continue to retain the quarter. Without\n\nmeaningfully complying with this order, the respondents have\n\ntaken recourse to the proceedings under the\nPublic Premises\n\n(Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\n. Such a\n\ndecision of the respondent patently violates the petitioner‟s\n\nbasic human rights and constitutional guarantees noted\n\nhereinabove. Other petitioners have also made similar\n\nrepresentations on which orders have not been passed by the\n\nrespondents.\n\n217. Smt. Phoola Raina who is the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.\n\n15698/2004 is the wife of late Sh. T.N. Raina who expired in\n\nharness on 4th August, 2001. She and family were dependent on\n\nlate Shri T.N.Raina and residing with him in the allotted\n\nquarter. The respondents have been unable to rehabilitate this\n\nlegal heir who is also a Kashmiri displaced person and if forcibly\n\nevicted from the premises in her possession, she has nowhere to\n\ngo. It is contended by Phoola Raina that the meager pension\n\nshe is receiving is her only source of income which is\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 137 of 157\n\ninsufficient to even bear the expense of food for her family\n\nmembers. The writ petitioner has also placed reliance on SR-\n\n317 B-25 of the allotment of Allotment of Government\n\nResidences (General Pool in Delhi) Rules, 1963. In view of the\n\nabove discussion, it is clearly evident that so far as her claim is\n\nconcerned, the same fundamental and human rights as those of\n\nthe other writ petitioners are involved and she is entitled to the\n\nsame relief and consideration as the others.\n\n218. The petitioners in the present cases have complained of\n\nviolation of their right to life in their home state. This situation\n\nhas come to be despite the 1984 riots, which mark an\n\nunfortunate watershed in Indian history, when examined from\n\nany aspect. The threatened breach of primarily of their right to\n\nshelter, a basic human right and an integral part of the\n\nguarantee under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India, even at\n\ntheir displaced location at the hands of the respondents has\n\ncompelled invocation of this court‟s extra-ordinary jurisdiction\n\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\n\n219. The pleadings in the case would show that there is no\n\ndispute to the facts pleaded by present petitioners. There\n\ncannot be and there is not even a suggestion that the right to\n\nshelter of the petitioners in their home state has been abridged\n\nby any procedure established by law. Such infraction of their\n\nrights is purely on account of the inability of the respondents to\n\ndischarge their constitutional obligation; duty and responsibility\n\nof protecting the life and property of the petitioners.\n\nThe respondents have a positive duty to provide basic\n\nnecessities to its citizens. It certainly defies commonsense and\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 138 of 157\n\nall notions of human dignity to permit the respondents to\n\nexclude such facilities as bare shelter which is essential and\n\nnecessary to encourage the self respect and dignity of these\n\ndisplaced persons in a human manner consistent with well\n\nrecognized modern standards thereof.\n\nThe courts have a constitutional duty and international\n\nlegal obligations to ensure the right of every person to be free\n\nfrom want of basic essentials.\n\n220. The above discussion would show that there cannot be any\n\ndispute about the nature of and protection of the right of the\n\npetitioners. However, the manner in which it is to be enforced\n\nagainst the respondents deserves consideration.\n\n221. The instant cases relate to a unique situation. It has been\n\nrepeatedly stated by the Supreme Court that in case of violation\n\nof the right to life and personal liberty, the court is not helpless\n\nto grant relief and should be prepared to forge new tools and\n\ndevise new remedies for the purpose of vindicating the most\n\nprecious of the precious fundamental right to life and personal\n\nliberty. (Ref.: (1981) 1 SCC 627: AIR 1981 SC 928 Khatri &\n\nOrs. Vs. State of Bihar & Ors.).\n\n222.\nIn (1991) 4 SCC 584 :\nAIR 1992 SC 248 Union\n\nCarbide Corporation Vs. Union of India\n, it was stated by the\n\nChief Justice Ranganath Misra that \"we have to develop our own\n\nlaw and if we find that it is necessary to construct a new\n\nprinciple of liability to deal with an unusual situation which has\n\narisen and which is likely to arise in future.......... there is no\n\nreason why we should hesitate to evolve such principle of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 139 of 157\n\nliability..........\".\nThe observations of Venkatachaliah, J (as his\n\nLordship then was) in this case who had rendered the leading\n\njudgment in the Bhopal Gas case with regard to the courts'\n\npower to grant relief are the same.\n\nThese principles have been reiterated in AIR 1993 SC\n\n1960 Smt. Nilabati Behera alias\nLalita Behera Vs. State of\n\nOrissa & Ors\n.\n\n223. The jurisdiction of the court to mould the relief so as to do\n\njustice to a party complaining of infringement of Chapter III\n\nrights is wide and requires to fit the contours of the right which\n\nis violated. It is essential, therefore, that while adjudicating on\n\nthe questions raised, the relief to be granted has to be moulded\n\nkeeping in mind the unique challenges laid and the claims made\n\nin these petitions.\n\n224. In (1987) 1 SCC 395 M.C. Mehta vs. UOI & Ors., the\n\ncourt expanded on the jurisdiction and obligation of the court to\n\nmould a new relief in the following terms :-\n\n\"3. .......It may now be taken as well settled that\n\nArticle 32\ndoes not merely confer power on this Court to\nissue a direction, order or writ for enforcement of the\nfundamental rights but it also lays a constitutional\nobligation on this Court to protect the fundamental\nrights of the people and for that purpose this Court has\nall incidental and ancillary powers including the power\nto forge new remedies and fashion new strategies\ndesigned to enforce the fundamental rights. It is in\nrealisation of this constitutional obligation that this\nCourt has in the past innovated new methods and\nstrategies for the purpose of securing enforcement of\nthe fundamental rights, particularly in the case of the\npoor and the disadvantaged who are denied their basic\nhuman rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no\nmeaning.\"\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 140 of 157\n\n225. The Supreme Court has categorically held in (\n1996 ) 9\n\nSCC 300 J.P. Ravidas & Ors. vs. Navyuvak Harijan\n\nUtthapan Multi Unit Industrial Coop. Society Ltd. & Ors.\n\nthat any contract or action which is opposed to constitutional\n\nanimation is void. The court as custodian and protector of\n\nfundamental and basic human rights has a sacred duty to deter\n\nbreaches thereof.\n\n226. It is also well settled that it is not only the right of the\n\nlitigants, but also the duty of the court to not only enforce\n\nfundamental rights but also award compensation against the\n\nstate for violation of those rights. In other words, 'the power of\n\nthe court is not only injunctive in ambit, that is preventing the\n\ninfringement of a fundamental right but it is also remedial in\n\nscope and provides the relief against the breach of the\n\nfundamental right already committed.' (AIR 1989 Mad. 205\nR.\n\nGandhi vs. UOI & Anr.\n(supra)\n\n227. On the aspect of appropriate compensation for established\n\nbreaches of fundamental rights, reference can also usefully be\n\nmade to the observations of the Division Bench of this court in\n\nthe judgment reported at 2001 (\n1) JCC Delhi 57 Government\n\nof NCT of Delhi vs. Shri Nasiruddin (Father\nof deceased\n\nMohd. Yasin) to the following effect :-\n\n\"21. It is true that perfect compensation is\nhardly possible and money cannot renew a physique\nframe that has been battered and shattered, as stated\nby Lord Morris in West v. Shephard (1964) AC 326.\nJustice requires that it should be equal in value,\nalthough not alike in kind. Object of providing\ncompensation is to place claimant as far as possible in\nthe same position financially, as he was before\naccident. ....... Compensation awarded should not\nbe inadequate and should neither be\nunreasonable, excessive, nor deficient. There can\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 141 of 157\n\nbe no exact uniform rule for measuring the\ndamage.\"\n\n228. In the present cases, the petitioners have complained of\n\ngrievous violence to their lives and properties and the admitted\n\nhelplessness of the respondents to protect the same. We are\n\nconcerned with forced ouster, though not by the State, but\n\nwhich is a direct result of the inability of the state to protect the\n\nlife and property of a class of its citizens resulting in their\n\nforced displacements. The petitioners are now threatened with\n\ncompulsive eviction from their occupied quarters without any\n\nalternative despite the threats to their lives in their home state.\n\nThe UN Commission on Human Rights has unequivocally stated\n\nthat forced evictions are a gross violation of human rights. The\n\nInternational Community has long recognised forced eviction as\n\na serious matter and it has been reported repeatedly that\n\nclearance operations should take place only when conservation\n\narrangements and rehabilitation are not feasible, relocation\n\nmeasures stand made.\n\n229.\nIn (\n1990) 1 SCC 328 S.M.D. Kiran Pasha vs.\n\nGovernment of A.P.\n, the Supreme Court had observed that a\n\nwrit petition would be maintainable under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India also when a right under\nArticle 21\nis\n\nthreatened as contradistinguished from the right when it is\n\ninfringed. In para 21 at page 342 of the report, the court held\n\nas follows :-\n\n\"21. In the language of Kelsen the right of an\nindividual is either a mere reflex right-the reflex of\nlegal obligation existing towards this individual; or a\nprivate right in the technical sense -the legal power\nbestowed upon an individual to bring about by legal\naction the enforcement of the fulfillment of an\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 142 of 157\n\nobligation existing toward him, that is, the legal power.\nFrom the above analysis it is clear that in the instant\ncase the appellant's fundamental right to liberty is the\nreflex of a-legal obligation of the rest of the society,\nincluding the State, and it is the appellant's legal power\nbestowed upon him to bring about by a legal action the\nenforcement of the fulfillment of that obligation\nexisting towards him. Denial of the legal action would,\ntherefore, amount to denial of his right of enforcement\nof his right to liberty. A petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus would not be a substitute for this enforcement.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThese principles have been reiterated by the Apex Court\n\nin (\n2003) 6 SCC 1 Kapila Hingorani vs. State of Bihar\n.\n\n230. These judicial concepts have evolved from conservative\n\nand traditional judicial systems and concepts. Legal\n\ninterpretation as well as judicial pronouncements lean towards\n\nproviding for the social needs of society and societal\n\ndevelopments.\n\nIn this background, the objection of the respondents that\n\nthe petitioners are disentitled to relief is devoid of legal merit.\n\n231. In view of the harm inflicted by a third party against\n\nwhich the state could offer no protection in the present cases, a\n\npositive obligation is also imposed upon the state to compensate\n\nthe petitioners in reparation of the effects of the harm caused\n\nby the third party. It remains a fact that the State's inability to\n\nsecure the life and property of the petitioners compelled them\n\nto flee their homes. The same inability prevents the petitioners‟\n\nreturn to their homes.\n\n232. So far as compensation is concerned, it is again well\n\nsettled that the same would not be monetary alone. Principle 18\n\nof the Guiding Principles for IDPs as set out by the UN\n\nmandates that competent authorities shall provide internally\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 143 of 157\n\ndisplaced persons with and ensure safe access to essential food\n\nand potable water, basic shelter and housing, appropriate\n\nclothing, essential medical services and sanitation etc.\n\nResettlement and reintegration are an essential part of the\n\nrehabilitation of IDPs. They have the right to participate fully\n\nand equally in public affairs at all levels and are entitled to\n\nequal access to public services in the part of the country where\n\nthey are resettled. Principle 29 mandates when recovery of the\n\nproperty and possessions which the IDPs left behind or were\n\ndispossessed of upon their displacement is not possible, they are\n\nentitled to be provided appropriate compensation or another\n\nform of 'just reparation'.\n\n233. Reference can usefully be made to the observations of the\n\nConstitutional Court of South Africa in (2001) 3 LRC 209\n\nGovernment of Republic of South Africa & Ors. vs.\n\nGootboom & Ors. wherein the court observed as follows :-\n\n\"93... this case shows the desperation of\nhundreds of thousands of people living in\ndeplorable conditions throughout the country. The\nConstitution obliges the state to act positively to\nameliorate these conditions. The obligation is to\nprovide access to housing, health care, sufficient\nfood and water, and social security to those unable\nto support themselves and their dependants. The\nstate must also foster conditions to enable citizens\nto gain access to land on an equitable basis.\"\n\n234. There can be no dispute at all that whether it be a jhuggi\n\nor mud built thatched house or a mansion considered in\n\nShantistar\n(supra), without security of limb and life as well as\n\nthe property, no enjoyment thereof is possible. In order to be\n\nmeaningful, the shelter which is envisaged has to be in an\n\nenvironment which is safe and secure, not only from the\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 144 of 157\n\nelements, but from the larger threats and dangers which have\n\nbeen created by mankind.\nEven if the respondents were in a\n\nposition to provide shelter in the home state of the petitioners\n\nas envisaged in the affidavit filed in J.L. Koul (supra), in order\n\nfor such right to be meaningfully enjoyed, it has to be ensured\n\nthat there is peace within the community and the state; that its\n\nlaw enforcement agencies are able to ensure that the\n\nconstitutional guarantees and protections of the citizens are\n\nfully secured.\n\n235. The respondents are not in a position to facilitate the\n\nreturn to their homes for the petitioners. Even if the petitioners\n\nwere to so return, the respondents are not in a position to state\n\nthey could protect and guarantee their safety and security. The\n\nrespondents do not even remotely suggest that they could get\n\nrestitution to the petitioners of their properties which had been\n\nleft behind in the Kashmir valley.\n\n236. The Supreme Court has also prescribed different reliefs in\n\ncases involving breaches of constitutional rights. In Municipal\n\nCouncil Ratlam Vs. Vardichan & Ors.(supra), the Supreme\n\nCourt was of the view that punitive action in the given facts was\n\nthe remedy which was effective to ensure the essence of the\n\nright involved.\n\n237.\nIn\nNational Human Rights Commission vs. State of\n\nArunachal Pradesh Anr.\n(supra), the court had directed the\n\nstate to ensure that the life and personal liberty of each and\n\nevery Chakma residing within the Government of Arunachal\n\nPradesh, the state was protected and any attempt to forcibly\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 145 of 157\n\nevict or drive them out was repelled in view of the violations\n\nand threat to their lives.\n\nAs noticed above, in para 13 of\nNilabati Behara @ Lalita\n\nBehura Vs. State of Orissa\n(supra), the court had moulded\n\nrelief by granting monetary compensation in view of the failure\n\nto protect fundamental rights of the persons. In fact the court\n\nheld that the refusal to pass orders for compensation would be\n\ndoing lip service and that the court was under an obligation to\n\ngrant relief (para 37).\n\nIn 1997 (\n1) SCC 416 D.K. Basu vs. State of West\n\nBengal\n, the Supreme Court emphasized a justice oriented\n\napproach which was responsive to the needs of the society. The\n\ncourt had also granted monetary compensation for violations in\n\nthis case.\n\nDenial of wages was the consideration and relief moulded\n\nappropriately in\nKapila Hingorani Vs. State of Bihar\n\n(supra).\n\n238. Compensation to these petitioners which could be\n\nconsidered appropriate and perfect thus would have to include\n\ncomprehensive resettlement such as economic rehabilitation\n\nand affordable housing schemes which have been clearly\n\nenvisaged by the respondents. Several other measures towards\n\nmeaningful rehabilitation essential in terms of the Guiding\n\nPrinciples have not even entered the respondents‟\n\nconsideration. The same has however not been possible so far.\n\nThis court cannot shut its eyes or judicial conscience or remain\n\noblivious to the stark realities.\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 146 of 157\n\n239. The issues raised in the present case have arisen before\n\nin the context of persons facing displacement on account of\n\ndevelopment and infrastructure projects especially major river\n\nvalley projects.\nIn (2000) 10 SCC 664 :\nAIR 2000 SC 3751\n\nNarmada Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India\nthe Supreme\n\nCourt was concerned with the displacement of tribals as a result\n\nof construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam. In para 62 at page\n\n702 of the SCC report the court held that if the displaced\n\npersons were in a better position to lead a decent life enjoying\n\nbetter amenities and facilities and earn their livelihood in the\n\nrehabilitated location, their fundamental rights guaranteed\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution would per se not be violated\n\nby the construction of the dam and the resultant displacement.\n\nThis position was reiterated in (\n2005) 4 SCC 32 Narmada\n\nBachao Andolan vs. UOI & Ors\n.\n\n240. In para 60 (pg 394) of (2004) 9 SCC 362 N.D. Jayal &\n\nAnr. Vs. UOI & Ors., Rajendra Babu, J held that\n\nrehabilitation of oustees of a dam is a logical corollary of\nArticle\nof the Constitution and that the oustees should be in the\n\nbetter position to lead a decent life and earn livelihood in the\n\nnew locations.\n\nNo reason at all as to why forcibly displaced persons as\n\nthe petitioners should not be similarly treated given the\n\nviolations of their constitutional rights.\n\n241. Before this court, the petitioners are aggrieved by the\n\ndeprivation of their homes and property and the threat by the\n\nrespondents to evict them from the only shelter possessed by\n\nthem. Looked at from any angle, the respondents cannot avoid\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 147 of 157\n\ntheir constitutional obligation of protecting the life and liberty\n\nof the petitioners and ensuring shelter to these victims of\n\ncriminal acts who stand displaced from their home for no fault\n\nof theirs, primarily on account of failure of the respondents to\n\nprotect their Constitutional rights. In case rehabilitation is not\n\npossible then the respondents have no option but to ensure\n\nmeaningful and reasonable resettlement in the above terms. To\n\nmitigate effects of the displacement from home, hearth and\n\nproperty, the respondents are thus legally obliged to provide at\n\nleast reasonable shelter as part of the proportional\n\ncompensation to the petitioners for violation of their basic and\n\nfundamental rights.\n\nSuch 'just reparation' would constitute part of \"reasonable\n\ncompensation\" and would be a step towards suitable\n\nrehabilitation of the petitioners. Relief in these petitions has to\n\nbe so moulded.\n\n242. It is now necessary to examine the contours and\n\nparameters of the state responsibility.\n\n243. Mr. Jatan Singh and Mr. R.V. Sinha, learned counsel for\n\nthe Union of India have urged at length that the petitioners\n\nwere fully aware about the fact that eventually they were to\n\nretire from the Government service. The submission is that they\n\nwere required to have made their life plans and alternate\n\narrangements with this unavoidable event in mind.\n\n244. The further contention is that, the government ensures\n\nadequate financial security to retiring employees, who have the\n\nbenefit of pension as well as other retiral benefits which run\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 148 of 157\n\ninto several lakhs of rupees including gratuity, provident fund\n\netc. and nothing further can be expected of the respondents.\n\n245. Pension, gratuity and other retiral benefits are not\n\nunique to the petitioners, but are available to every person who\n\nretires from the service of the country. What distinguishes\n\nthese petitioners is the fact that they have been placed in a\n\nunique position and are unable to return to their homes as a\n\nconsequence of the inability of the State to discharge its\n\nconstitutional obligations.\n\n246. The question still remains as to whether the pension and\n\nthe monetary retiral benefits could be \"adequate compensation\"\n\nfor the infringement of the petitioners indefeasible rights to life\n\nand due discharge of the constitutional obligation of the State.\n\nThe answer clearly has to be in the negative.\n\n247. We are here concerned with the entitlement of shelter to\n\nIDPs. So far as the nature of the development which would\n\nmeet the guarantee of shelter and ensure a life of dignity to the\n\nperson concerned, in para 9 of the pronouncement reported at\n\n(\n1990) 1 SCC 520 Shantistar Builders Vs. Narayan\n\nKhimalal Totame & Ors.\n, the Supreme Court had observed as\n\nfollows:-\n\n\"9. Basic needs of man have traditionally been\naccepted to be three-food, clothing and shelter. The\nright to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That\nwould take within its sweep the right to food, the right\nto clothing, the right to decent environment and a\nreasonable accommodation to live in. The difference\nbetween the need of an animal and a human being for\nshelter has to be kept in view. For the animal it is the\nbare protection of the body; for a human being it has to\nbe a suitable accommodation which would allow him to\ngrow in every aspect - physical, mental and intellectual.\nThe Constitution aims at ensuring fuller development of\nevery child. That would be possible only if the child is in\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 149 of 157\n\na proper home. It is not necessary that every citizen\nmust be ensured of living in a well- built comfortable\nhouse but a reasonable home particularly for people in\nIndia can even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-\nbuilt fire-proof accommodation.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nUndoubtedly, so far as the reasonableness and adequacy\n\nof the measures which the respondents are required to take,\n\nmust meet the principles\nlaid down in\nthe aforenoticed\n\npronouncements of the courts, the international conventions,\n\nthe standards in the guiding principles for IDPs and ensure the\n\nrights of the petitioners.\n\n248. The above International instruments and Guidelines for\n\nIDPs provide not only for the right to adequate shelter and\n\nhousing services but also refer to access to land on equitable\n\nbasis to all. They recognise and cast a positive obligation on the\n\nstate i.e. the respondents, to take other reasonable measures\n\npossible to ensure complete realisation of the right to adequate\n\nhousing of the petitioners. It is evident that the respondents\n\ncannot avoid their responsibility and duty to ensure that the\n\naforenoticed basics to the petitioners. These are the principles\n\nwhich had to guide the consideration of the issues which were\n\nbefore the respondents and have been raised in this bunch of\n\nwrit petitions.\n\n249. The claim for shelter in these writ petitions is thus\n\npressed as part of the compensation for the violation of the\n\npetitioners rights. The petitioners seek directions to the\n\nrespondents to permit them to occupy the premises in their\n\noccupation till such time the respondents are able to discharge\n\ntheir constitutional duty of protecting the lives and property of\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 150 of 157\n\nits citizens and providing them permanent residences. In\n\nsimilar cases, the Supreme Court and this court has permitted\n\nthe displaced persons to continue to occupy the occupied\n\nquarter. Order to this effect stand passed by the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal as well. The respondents have\n\npermitted some of IDPs to continue with their occupation of the\n\nallotted quarters after retirement. There is clearly no\n\njustification at all for not permitting the petitioners to do so in\n\nthe given facts and circumstances.\n\nRights of dependants of deceased allottees.\n\n250. There is yet another aspect of the matter. The petitioners\n\nbefore this court include Smt. Phoola Raina, a widow of the\n\nallottee. The respondents do not dispute that she was a\n\ndependant of the allottee and that she is also an IDP. It is also\n\nnot the respondent‟s case that she is a person of means who is\n\nliving in Delhi in circumstances which are different from those\n\nof the others from her home State. There is no material to show\n\nthat this petitioner has any alternative shelter under the\n\nschemes and policy of the respondents or has been adequately\n\ncompensated.\n\n251. So far as the claimed rights or the violations urged by\n\nSmt. Phoola Raina are concerned, other than a bald plea that\n\nshe was not the allottee, the respondents are unable to point out\n\nany distinction from the other petitioners. The respondents do\n\nnot state that she can safely return to any residence in the\n\nKashmir valley. It is also not averred that this petitioner owns\n\nany property into which she could shift. It is not even suggested\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 151 of 157\n\nthat there is any difference in the constitutional rights or\n\nscheme between her and the other petitioners. Not a single\n\ncircumstance which could disentitle this petitioner to grant of\n\nrelief against the threatened eviction and violation of her\n\nconstitutional rights has been placed or made out in the case.\n\nTill such time that the respondents are able to meaningfully and\n\nreasonably rehabilitate this petitioner, her forcible eviction\n\nunder the shield of statutory process is also without any doubt\n\nconstitutionally impermissible.\n\n252. As noted above the respondents have admittedly made\n\ndiscretionary allotments in favour of persons who are not\n\nGovernment servants. It is not explained as to why such\n\ndiscretion could not be exercised in favour of this petitioner.\n\nCertainly permitting such a dependant of the deceased allottee\n\nto continue to occupy the accommodation under occupation till\n\nalternate shelter was made available would not violate any rule\n\nas well. The same would clearly be in consonance with the\n\nconstitutional mandate and the principles which emerge from\n\nthe several judgments noticed above. It is clearly evident that\n\nsuch a dependant would be permitted to continue to occupy the\n\nallotted accommodation till such time that the respondents\n\nmeaningfully resettle and rehabilitate the IDPs or they acquire\n\ntheir own alternatives or if the respondents are able to show\n\nthat they have the means to make alternate meaningful and\n\nreasonable arrangements.\n\nConclusions\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 152 of 157\n\n253. In view of the above discussion, absent any alternative;\n\nthe admitted failure of the respondents to protect the\n\nconstitutional rights of the petitioner and the threats which\n\nsubsist in case they were compelled to return to their State;\n\ngiven the arbitrary and wrongful failure to exercise the\n\ndiscretion under the SR-317 B-25 of the Allotment of\n\nGovernment Residences (General Pool in Delhi) Rules, 1963 in\n\nfavour of the petitioners; the drastic violation of the\n\nfundamental and basic human rights of the petitioner which\n\nresults upon such implementation of the statutory provisions;\n\nkeeping view the schemes of rehabilitation and resettlement of\n\nKashmiri migrants of the respondents, and also the several\n\njudicial precedents and administrative orders in respect of\n\nsimilarly placed persons, the action of the respondents in\n\ntreating the petitioners as unauthorised occupants and\n\nproceeding against them under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\nwas completely misdirected\n\nand unwarranted.\n\n254. It is evident that the learned appellate courts in the\n\nappeals also adopted a hyper technical approach ignoring the\n\nserious violation of constitutional rights which has resulted to\n\nthe petitioners and the drastic consequences of rendering them\n\nhomeless which results on implementation of the eviction order.\n\nThe constitutional rights of the litigants are not only well\n\nestablished but are without any limitations. The orders do not\n\nindicate that the several important questions raised by the\n\npetitioners were deemed to deserve an adjudication including\n\nthe manner in which superior courts had dealt with similarly\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 153 of 157\n\nsituated displaced persons. The learned courts paid no\n\nattention to the declared policy of resettlement and\n\nrehabilitation of Government or the constitutional rights and\n\nguarantees which all courts are bound to enforce.\n\n255. The action of the respondents in denying favourable\n\nconsideration of the request to continue to occupy the quarters\n\nsuffers from the vice of discrimination and arbitrariness. The\n\ndecision to treat the petitioners as unauthorized occupants and\n\nproceed against them under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971\nas well as the impugned\n\norders are in violation of the constitutional guarantees and\n\nbasic human rights of the petitioners, and do not show\n\napplication of mind to relevant material or consideration\n\nthereof. The impugned decision to cancel the allotments, the\n\naction under the Public Premises Act;; and the impugned orders\n\nof the Estate Officer and the appellate orders are\n\nconstitutionally and legally not sustainable.\n\n256. The special leave petition in J.L Koul (supra) was filed\n\nin 1997 and the rehabilitation scheme was placed before the\n\ncourt for the first time in 2006 which proceedings culminated in\n\nthe judgment dated 3rd December, 2008 after twelve years.\n\nAdjudication was still necessitated in\nP.K. Handoo vs. Estate\n\nOfficer\n(supra) decided on 2nd August, 2006;\nM.K. Koul\n\n(supra) decided on11th April, 2008.\nI find that the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal had passed a detailed judgment on 30th\n\nDecember, 2002 in OA No. 2378/2002 entitled Tej Kishan vs.\n\nUOI. In all these cases by final adjudications, the petitioners\n\nhave been permitted to continue with occupation of the quarter\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 154 of 157\n\nconcerned. Despite the proceedings and judgments in the\n\nabovenoticed matters, the respondents have still proceeded\n\nagainst the petitioner in the manner noticed above.\n\n257. Instead of facilitating the resettlement and rehabilitation\n\nof the petitioners who are internally displaced persons as per\n\nthe declared policy, they have arbitrarily been exposed to the\n\nadditional trauma of the threat of forcible evictions and the\n\nuncertainty and insecurity of seeking the adjudication by\n\npursuing litigation. In these circumstances, the petitioners are\n\nentitled to exemplary costs from the respondents inasmuch as\n\nthe threat of forcible eviction by the process resorted to by the\n\nrespondents impacts the fundamental rights of the petitioners.\n\n258. In this background, while allowing the writ petitions and\n\nhaving regard to the number of the petitions which have been\n\nunnecessarily generated and the lack of material with regard to\n\nthe persons responsible for the unfortunate decision making,\n\nonly the litigation costs of the present cases are being awarded.\n\n259. It is essential to make it clear that it is only in the\n\npeculiar fact situation of the present cases and the extreme\n\nhardship of the petitioners involving violation of the\n\nfundamental rights and human rights of the citizens of India\n\nthat such continued occupation of the public premises by the\n\npetitioners has to be permitted. No inference can be laid that\n\nany person not having a property of its own or not having\n\nsuffered the violations aforenoticed can or has been permitted\n\nto continue to indefinitely occupy the public premises.\n\nTherefore, the principles laid down in this judgment would bind\n\nonly a fact situation as in the present case or similar\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 155 of 157\n\ncircumstances when the State has been unable to protect the\n\nfundamental and basic human rights of its citizens compelling\n\nthem to be displaced from the place of their residence and is\n\nnot in a position to ensure their safety or security in case they\n\nreturn to the place of their residence.\n\nResult\n\nIn view of the above discussion, it is directed as follows\n\n(i) The impugned orders cancelling the allotment of the\n\npetitioners; the orders of eviction passed in the proceedings\n\nheld against the petitioners under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction\n\nof Unauthorised Occupants) Act\nand the appellate orders which\n\nare detailed in para 13 are hereby set aside and quashed.\n\n(ii) A direction is issued to the respondents to make all\n\nendeavours to adequately, effectively and reasonably\n\nrehabilitate and resettle the petitioners, making provisions for\n\nappropriate accommodations for them.\n\n(iii) Till such time, the respondents are able to provide\n\nalternative accommodation to the petitioner and his/or her\n\nfamily anywhere in Delhi, the petitioners shall be allowed to\n\nretain and occupy the allotted accommodation (also detailed in\n\ncolumn no. 2 of para 13 above) subject to payment of normal\n\nlicense fees.\n\n(iv) Each of the petitioners shall be entitled to costs of\n\nRs.25,000/- which shall be paid within a period of six weeks\n\nfrom the date of passing the order.\n\nThese writ petitions are allowed in the above terms.\n\nCM Nos. 11011/2004, 11013/2004, 11026/2004,\n11029/2004, 736/2006, 11016/2004, 11044/2004,\n11050/2004, 11444/2004, 1557/2006, 2379/2006,\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 156 of 157\n\n10547/2007, 13421/2007, 15540/2008, 16497/2008,\n16449/2008, 16501/2008, 5796/2009, 7654/2009,\n10986/2009, 11351/2009, 11242/2009, 11244/2009 &\n11246/2009\n\nIn view of the orders passed in the respective writ\n\npetitions, these applications do not require further adjudication\n\nand are disposed of accordingly.\n\n(GITA MITTAL)\nJUDGE\n\nNovember 30, 2010.\n\naa/kr\n\nW.P.(C) No.15239/2004 Page 157 of 157",
