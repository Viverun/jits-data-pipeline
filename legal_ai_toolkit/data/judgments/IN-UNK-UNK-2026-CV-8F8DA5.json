Aggrieved by the said Judgment, State of NCT of Delhi\n preferred an appeal to the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi.\n Vide Judgment dated 13.01.20 in Crl. A. 576/2019 and\n Crl. M.A. 37206/2019, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi\n set aside the Judgment passed by the Ld. Predecessor and\n remanded the case back to this Court for framing\n alternate charge under \nsection 302\n IPC against accused\n persons and for giving opportunity to the accused persons\n to cross-examine Dr Amandeep Kaur, for leading\n additional evidence in defence and for recording\n statement\n u/s 313\n Cr. P.C. afresh and for the Trial Court\n to arrive at its own conclusion. The relevant extract of the\n said Judgment passed by the Hon'ble High Court of\n Delhi is reproduced below:\n\n \"11. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this\n Court finds that in the present case the deceased has\n died due to Aluminium Phosphide poisoning. The said\n poison was found in the blood and stomach of the\n deceased-Ms. Bhawna @ Pinky.\n\n 12. However, the Trial Court has acquitted the\n respondents of the charge framed under \nSection 304B\n\n IPC primarily on the ground that Doctor Amit Sharma\n (PW-12) had deposed that Aluminium Phosphide will\n not act if given by injection.\n\n \n13. From the Trial Court judgment, it is apparent that\n though Dr. Amandeep Kaur, Assistant Professor,\n Department of Forensic Medicine, Maulana Azad\n Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

While it is true that the opinions of Dr. Amit\n Sharma (PW-12) and Dr. Amandeep Kaur are advisory\n and contradictory, yet the Trial Court should have\n examined both the opinions and given reasons as to\n why it was accepting one opinion and rejecting the\n other.\n\n 15. Further, this Court is of the view that in the present\n appeal, it cannot examine as to whether the opinion of\n Dr. Amandeep Kaur is contrary to medical texts as\n firstly the said submission has not been examined by\n the Trial Court. Moreover, as no alternate charge\n under \nSection 302\n IPC had been framed, this Court if\n it were to reject the submission of learned counsel for\n respondents, would not be able to carry the matter to\n its legal conclusion.\n\n 16. Consequently, this Court in exercise of its power\n under \nSection 464(2)\n of the Code of Criminal\n Procedure (hereinafter referred to as \"\nCr.P.C\n\").\n remands the case back to the Trial Court as there has\n been an omission on the part of Trial Court to frame\n charge and such omission has resulted in failure of\n justice.\n\n 17. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside\n and the matter is remanded back to the Trial Court for\n framing of an alternate charge under \nSection 302\n IPC\n against the accused persons. The accused persons will\n be given an opportunity to cross-examine Dr.\n Amandeep Kaur and to lead additional evidence in\n defence, if they so desire. The statement of the accused\n under \nSection 313\n Cr. P.C. shall also be recorded\n afresh.\"\n\nALTERNATE CHARGE\n\n39. On 27.03.21, Alternate charge\n u/s 302\n/\n34\n IPC was framed\n against all the three accused persons to which they\n pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

Dr. Amandeep Kaur, Professor, Department of Forensic\n Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok\n Nayak Hospital was examined as PW-21, cross examined\n by the Ld. Counsel for accused persons. The evidence of\n PW-21 is reproduced below:\n\n \"ON SA.\n\n On 10/08/2016, I was posted as Assistant Professor at\n Department of Forensic Medicine Maulana Azad\n Medical College & Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi.\n On that day an application was moved by SI Mohit\n Malik PS Prashad Nagar Delhi seeking clarification in\n respect of skin samples preserved in case FIR No.\n 126/2008 PS Prashad Nagar and put forward few\n queries on which a subsequent opinion vide No.\n FM/XII/(MLW)/10/OPN/Yr of PM 2008/ OPN/118\n dated 12/08/2016 which is exhibited as\n Ex.PW21/A(running into 3 pages) bearing my\n signatures at points A on each page, was given by me\n as follows.\n\n Q-1. What is the purpose of keeping skin samples\n during the postmortem of deceased?\n\n Ans. The skin samples are preserved from the alleged\n site of insect bite for analysis of insect toxins.\n\n Q-2. If the purpose of keeping skin samples during the\n postmortem of deceased to rule out the insect bite then\n it is requested that please provide the address of\n laboratory where the skin sample will be sent for\n expert opinion?\n\n Ans. The samples are sent for chemical analysis to\n FSL/CFSL where the facility to assess such toxin is\n available. If not, FSL/CFSL may be contacted for\n further guidance regarding this matter.\n\n \nQ-3. During the FSL examination of other two samples\n i.e. blood and viscera, FSL Rohini opined that\n aluminum phosphide is found in the body of the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 19 of 73\n deceased. Kindly opine whether the above mentioned\n poison is taken orally or otherwise, also you are\n requested to please opined whether any insect bite can\n cause the above mentioned poison i.e. aluminum\n phosphide.\n\n Ans. The commonest route of poisoning in case of\n aluminum phosphide is through ingestion of the\n compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution\n which is easily available. However, poisoning can\n occur through inhalation of vapours or through\n injection of the compound in solution form. Insect bite\n does not cause aluminum phosphide poisoning.\n\n Q-4. Is it necessary to obtain expert opinion of skin\n samples when the other samples opined as aluminum\n phosphide?\n\n Ans. As a cause of death has already been opined as\n aluminum phosphide poisoning in the subsequent\n opinion. Further analysis of skin sample is not\n required.\n\n XXXXXX by Sh. Kishore Kumar, ld. Counsel for all\n accused persons.\n\n \"I have no personal knowledge about this case. I was\n not the head of the department at the that time when I\n had given the opinion Ex.PW21/A. I was posted as\n Assistant professor in the department of Forensic\n Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok\n Nayak Hospital, Delhi.\n\n Q. Under which capacity you have given this\n opinion to the police?\n\n Ans. I was authorized by my HOD.\n\n Q. Do you have any such authorization letter to\n give said opinion?\n\n Ans. I do not have any such authorization at present\n and even in the Court file and the same may be called\n from the record.\n\n It is wrong to suggest that I was not authorized by the\n HOD to give opinion Ex.PW21/A or that I myself gave\n the opinion to SI Mohit Malik as per his convenient.\n\n \nI am doctor of medicine (MD) in Forensic Medicine.

I did not conduct\n research in respect of aluminium phosphide(ALP).\n Vol., we in forensic medicine do see cases / conduct\n postmortems which subsequently have been alleged to\n die of aluminium phosphide (ALP) or thereafter\n confirmed by forensic science laboratory report. I do\n not have any knowledge in respect of aluminium\n phosphide. I rely upon the encyclopedia, my seniors\n research and their books, scientific literatures etc. in\n respect of ALP. It is correct that acute aluminium\n phosphide poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning;\n mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent\n commonly accidental and rarely homicidal. It is\n correct that ALP used as rodenticide, weedicide or\n pesticide in grain, wheat, rice etc. in tablets form.\n ALP is available in only powder and tablet forms.\n It is correct that ALP used in fumigant and oral\n pesticide. It is correct that if ALP comes in contact\n with water or moisture in air, it releases phosphine gas\n which vaporises in air. It is correct that after release of\n phosphine gas, the residue powder is harmless. It is\n also correct that on coming to contact with moisture\n present in air (or with HCL or and water in the\n stomach), ALP liberates phosphine leaving behind\n aluminium hydroxide(or chloride) which is harmless\n and non toxic. The contents of the textbook of Forensic\n Medicine and Toxicology are correct which is written\n by Dr. Anil Aggarwal (retired Director Professor). He\n was my senior. I have seen the book today in the Court.\n It is correct that commonly the ALP cannot be given by\n force homicidally as it emits very bad smell like rotten\n fish and garlic. As far as I know the absorption of ALP\n through intact skin is rare, hence, if it causes burning\n on the skin (by ALP or phosphine) is not known to me.\n I cannot say regarding the mode of intake of ALP in\n this case if it was ingested, injected or inhaled. I know\n Dr. Amit Sharma. Dr. Amit Sharma is senior and\n expert. I have seen the postmortem report and opinion\n given by Dr. Amit Sharma. The deceased Bhavna had\n taken ALP orally in the present case as per the FSL\n report already Ex.PW-7/C. Any tablet / poison tablet\n when taken orally do appear in blood either by\n absorption or after metabolism. It is wrong to suggest\n that I gave my opinion to the police at the instance of\n the IO and complainant. It is wrong to suggest that I\n am deposing falsely.\"\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

PP for the State argued that the prosecution has\n proved its case against the accused persons beyond\n reasonable doubt. It is argued that the accused persons\n misled the doctors by informing that the deceased was\n bitten by the insect, however, the postmortem report and\n subsequent FSL result reveal that the deceased had\n expired due to poisoning. It is argued that the burden was\n upon the accused persons to prove as to how the deceased\n had expired. It is further argued that the accused persons\n have caused disappearance of evidence as they have\n cleaned the vomiting of the deceased from the place of\n incident. It is argued that the deceased had died\n unnaturally under suspicious circumstances and the cause\n of death is confirmed due to poisoning. It is argued that\n there is no evidence on record that the poison was\n consumed by the deceased herself and the circumstances\n point towards the guilt of the accused persons. It is\n therefore, prayed that the accused persons may be\n convicted for the offences charged against them.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

Counsel for the accused persons has filed written\n submissions and it is argued that the present FIR was\n registered on the complaint of the mother of the deceased\n Bhawna against the accused persons (husband and\n brothers-in-laws of the deceased) u/s. 498A/304 B/201/34\n \nIPC\n and after thorough investigation, the prosecution had\n filed charge-sheet against the accused persons and\n produced 21 witnesses. He further stated that the accused\n persons also led 7 witnesses in their defence. It is further\n argued that on the basis of entire evidences and materials\n on record, the accused persons were acquitted by the ld.\n Predecessor of this Court vide judgment dated\n 13.08.2018. It is further argued that after the remand back\n of the case by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, the\n prosecution produced Dr. Amandeep Kaur as PW-21 and\n even she has not supported the prosecution's case. She\n corroborated the version of PW-12 Dr. Amit Sharma\n (who conducted PM of deceased). It is argued that PW-12\n stated that \"as there were no evidence of any sign of\n struggle, injury mark in this case therefore deceased\n possibly taken the tablet/poison herself\". \nIt is argued that\n both above important witnesses stated that \"ALP is\n available in Tablet and Powder form and same cannot be\n given via injection\". It is argued that Bhawna was\n conscious and she herself told the witnesses that some\n insect has bitten on her arm. It is argued that there were\n no marks of struggle on body of deceased.

It is argued that they\n were living separately having their own mess from other\n family members. It is argued that accused Praveen and\n Bhupender were living separately from deceased and\n Bhaskar and hence, they have no concern and\n interference in the family of the deceased. It is argued\n that there was no demand of dowry, harassment, cruelty\n by accused and his family. It is argued that Bhawna never\n made any complaint in respect to demand of dowry,\n harassment and cruelty to police, authority and her family\n members and the accused never received any dowry or\n any thing from the side of the deceased. It is argued that\n Bhawana was suffering from lower abdomen pain and\n Gyane problem since long time and she was undergoing\n treatment for her problems from various hospitals. It is\n argued that she loved the children and wanted to get a\n child from her womb. It is argued that she had suffered\n miscarriages and due to above, she was under stress and\n depression. It is argued that Bhaskar used to provide\n treatment for Bhawna so that she could deliver healthy\n child and does not suffer pain. It is argued that whenever\n she used to suffer any medical problem, Bhaskar used to\n take her to the doctor and hospital for treatment. It is\n argued that no incriminating material was found and\n accused persons cooperated during the investigation and\n they joined investigation.\n \nIt is argued that the accused\n were at their work at the time of incident and they were\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

It is argued that the dead body of deceased-wife\n was handed over to her husband (Bhaskar) and he\n performed the last rituals of deceased in the presence of\n complainant, both relatives and neighbors. It is argued\n that till then there was no complaint from the side of\n complainant against accused persons. It is argued that\n there was no motive or intention to kill the deceased\n because there was no complaint whatsoever against\n accused as they loved each other and living happily and\n her husband performed all his duties as an ideal husband\n towards deceased. It is argued that there was no struggle\n mark on the body of the deceased. It is argued that PW-17\n Smt. Meena (sister of deceased) already stated that \"I\n have deposed against accused before the court and police\n at the instance of my mother, brother, police and also\n being a sister of Bhawna\" and it is also on record that she\n is mentally ill.\n \nIt is argued that during the present trial,\n the complainant (mother of the deceased) i.e. plaintiff had\n also filed a civil suit for recovery of Stridhan of the\n deceased against the accused no. l i.e defendant on the\n similar facts and incidents which was dismissed by the\n court of Ms. Harshita Vatsayan Ld.

Therefore, there existed no\n cause of action. In light of evidence, the bills relied\n appears to be fake. The plaintiff has also failed to prove\n the allegations made by her regarding cruelty and\n harassment committed by the defendant and his family\n members against her daughter. She has also miserably\n failed to prove any such demand\". It is argued that in the\n said civil suit, the complainant had leveled the similar\n allegations and facts as of the case before this ld. Court. It\n is further argued that the accused persons are innocent. It\n is further argued that the deceased was suffering from\n said illness since long time and due to this, she was under\n\n \nstress and depression and Bhaskar (husband) being an\n ideal husband performed his duties and also was\n providing best treatments from various hospitals.

It is further argued that\n the complainant also made false and fabricated\n allegations against mother-in-law of deceased who was\n already admitted in Safdarjung Hospital even prior to\n incident. It is further argued that all alleged\n incidents/facts of the story of prosecution are also false,\n fabricated and after-thought, as the complainant herself\n admitted that she never visited at the matrimonial home\n of her daughter and accused never demanded dowry and\n the deceased never made any complaint in respect to\n demand of dowry, cruelty and harassment even before her\n death. It is further argued that the all accused persons\n were not present on the spot at the time of incident and\n they were called by family members when the deceased\n suffered ill and they also took her to the best hospital with\n her family members. It is further argued that no\n incriminating material was found from the spot or from\n the accused persons. It is further argued that the accused\n persons cooperated with investigation and there was no\n reason for causing death of the deceased by the accused\n persons due to dowry demand or harassment soon before\n death. It is further argued that the prosecution has failed\n to prove any motive or intention to kill the deceased.\n \nIt is\n further argued that after remanding back, except PW-21,\n (who has also not supported the prosecution's case) the\n prosecution has not produced any other evidence/witness\n and material against the accused persons and on the basis\n of evidences/witnesses and materials on record, the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

It is further argued that there is\n no allegation of 406 \nIPC\n in the present case and there was\n no cruelty, harassment and demand of dowry by the\n accused at any time. It is further argued that there are no\n ingredients/facts/material in the present case to show that\n soon before her death, Bhawna was subjected to cruelty\n or harassment by her husband or any relatives of her\n husband for or in connection with, any demand of dowry.\n It is further argued that the prosecution has failed to\n establish his case beyond reasonable doubts and the\n accused persons have already rebutted the presumption\n u/s. 304-B and 113-B \nIPC\n and hence, \nSec. 304\n B, 201,\n 498 A/34 \nIPC\n are not made out against the accused. It is\n further argued that the prosecution has also failed to give\n any cogent and material evidence against the accused\n persons who have been charged\n u/s. 302\n IPC. Therefore,\n it is respectfully prayed that the accused persons may\n kindly be acquitted in the present case from all false and\n fabricated allegations in the interest of justice.

Counsel for complainant has also filed written\n submissions. He stated that at the outset, it is brought to\n kind consideration of this court that the instant case was\n never tried in its true perspective, owing to the failure of\n justice. It is further argued that the Hon'ble High Court of\n Delhi set aside the Judgment passed by the Ld.\n predecessor of this Court vide order dated 13/08/2018 by\n which it had acquitted all the accused\n u/s. 498A\n/\n304 B\n \n201\n/\n34\n IPC on the ground that none of the sections under\n which charges had been framed against them for the\n death of Ms. Bhawna @ Pinky and remanded it back vide\n its order dated 13/01/2020 to frame alternate charge\n under\n u/s. 302\n IPC and accused persons were given\n opportunity to examine Dr. Amandeep Kaur who had\n opined contradictory to PW-12 Dr Amit Sharma. It is\n further argued that the Hon'ble High court also observed\n in Para 18 of its judgment that all the contentions of all\n parties are left open. It is humbly submitted that in the\n light of the observations of Hon'ble High court, the\n complainant is submitting what was not considered by the\n Ld predecessor Court which resulted into failure of\n justice in the instant case. It is further humbly submitted\n that the family members of the accused were made\n witnesses in the instant case and their submissions alludes\n towards hiding of facts relevant to determine the instant\n case. It is further argued that their submissions are\n untrustworthy vis-a-vis medical and other facts which\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

It\n is further argued that they concocted a story of insect bite\n and made the relevant evidence i.e vomiting disappear\n and mislead the entire trial resulting into failure of justice\n in the instant case. It is further argued that the deceased\n Bhawna was married to accused Bhaskar on 08/02/2006\n as per Hindu rituals and she expired in the seven years of\n marriage in her matrimonial home under unnatural\n circumstances. It is further argued that she was poisoned\n by the accused persons and a false and cooked up story of\n insect bite was created to cover their culpable criminal\n act of murdering a human being. It is further argued that\n that the deceased was admitted to Ganga Ram Hospital at\n 3:30 PM on 10/07/2008 by accused No. 1 as per MLC\n which records the fact that the deceased Bhawna was\n brought by accused no.1 to Ganga Ram hospital with the\n complaint that insect bite over (R) forearm at 11.00 AM\n at his residence 16/835 E Bapa Nagar, Padam Singh\n Road, Karol Bagh Delhi.

It is further argued that at para (ix) in\n external examination, Dr. Amit Sharma has mentioned\n that contusion present over right arm before right elbow\n and venepuncture wound (query Insect Bite or injection\n mark) was found present in the middle of the contusion.\n It is further argued that the subcutaneous tissues and\n muscle underneath the injury shows extraction of blood.\n It is further argued that that Ex. PW-7/C the viscera\n Report/ FSL report mentioned that Aluminium Phosphide\n was detected in Stomach and Intestine of the deceased\n Bhawan, hence, the cause of death was poisoning by\n ALP. It is further argued that the Death Certificate of\n Ganga Ram Hospital under the signature of Resident\n Doctor Amit Madaan on 11/07/2008 mentions cause of\n death as Insect Bite/ Unknown/Poisoning. It is further\n argued that that Death Report- Unnatural Death by\n poisoning (Inquest Report) mentions that the deceased\n was in good health, not suffering from any disease, not\n taken any medicine, taken Bread and Tea between 10:30\n AM and 1:30 PM on 10/07/08 at the commencement of\n symptom. It is further argued that the deceased started\n vomiting as first symptom and she was sensible in the\n intervals of the convulsions.\n \nIt is further argued that the\n medical evidence clearly established that the deceased\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 32 of 73\n Bhawna was administered poison and a concocted story\n of Insect Bite was created to cover up the murder by the\n accused persons. It is further argued that that the story\n cooked up by the accused persons is revealed in their\n statements/examinations before the Court. It is further\n argued that in PMR, it has been found that a condition of\n stomach hemorrhage congesting the whole stomach\n which goes on to cook and scientifically prove that there\n would have been heavy vomiting replete with blood. It is\n further argued that the accused did not help in fair\n investigation and made these evidences disappear. It is\n further argued that when the visible reactions and\n symptoms of the poisoning by ALP subsided only then\n the accused persons took the victim to hospital for any\n medical treatment under a conspiracy to hide the murder\n and created a false story of insect bite which has been\n falsified by the fact that the victim was subjected to\n Aluminium Phoshide poisoning. It is further argued that\n that the prosecution had to rely on the statement of family\n members of the accused persons who deposed only to\n save the skin of the accused persons and lied before the\n Court about the time, cause of death, vomiting fouls\n smell and other relevant with be read vis-a-vis statement\n of PW-14 Dev Shankar and PW-17 Meena who deposed\n before PW-18 Inspector Harish Kumar that they had seen\n vomiting and PW-17 was very clear that foul smell was\n coming out of the room where the deceased was kept and\n from her clothes.\n \nIt is further argued that the submissions\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 33 of 73\n of PW-13, PW-15, PW-16 may be read vis-a-vis the\n medical facts and submissions of PW-14, PW-17, PW-18\n and PW-19 to cull out the truth and real facts. It is\n humbly submitted that it has also come on record that all\n the accused persons came to the spot within 15 minutes in\n the congested gali which is not motorable. It is further\n argued that these facts go on to prove that the accused\n persons were present on the spot. It is further argued that\n that PW-14 and PW-17 proved beyond unreasonable\n doubt that the deceased did not make any submission\n with regard to the insect bite only she indicated towards\n her forearm where the wound was present which even\n PW-12 has found out that it needed enquiry whether it is\n insect bite or injection mark. It is further argued that that\n the submissions of PW-12 and PW-21 both doctors went\n on to prove that the death of Bhawna is due to the\n poisoning (ALP herein ) and PW-21 has established that\n it cannot be caused by insect bite. It is further argued that\n PW-12 only opined that ALP is easily available in market\n and as there was no sign of struggle, injury mark\n deceased possibly has taken the poison herself. It is\n further argued that such opinion was unwarranted as he\n himself found the injury on the right arm in the nature of\n injection or insect bite he was not sure hence, his opinion\n with regard to suicide which is merely advisory is not to\n be relied upon in the instant case.\n \nIt is further argued that\n PW-21 had opined that the commonest route of poisoning\n in ALP case through ingestion of the compound in the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

It is\n further argued that insect bite does not cause ALP\n poisoning. It is further argued that the deposition of PW-\n 21 goes on to establish that the ALP is very pungent and\n has reiterated the fact that she has seen FSL report PW-\n 7/C about which it has been opined by PW-12 that the\n deceased had taken it orally. It is further argued that she\n has gone to say that ALP poisoning is extremely lethal\n mode of ingestion is usually suicidal, commonly\n accidental and rarely homicidal. It is further argued that\n she has gone to establish that when ALP will come into\n contact with stomach water it will release Phosphine\n leaving behind Aluminium hydroxide (or chloride) which\n is non toxic. It is further argued that that it is humbly\n submitted that the Phosphine gas is the reason of Pungent\n foul smell of 20 ALP. It is further argued that the\n submission of PW-21 may be read vis-a-vis the fact that\n vomiting and foul smell was found at the spot which was\n never let to come before the Court. It is further argued\n that the accused persons flushed the most essential piece\n of evidence for which only they are liable. It is further\n argued that that the defence has tried to create a theory\n that the deceased was suffering from depression as she\n had given birth the still born and because of that\n depression she committed suicide.\n \nIt is further argued that\n this theory has been created to give a cover to their both\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

It is further argued that the\n defence has not produced any documents which show\n that the deceased was treated for depression. It is further\n argued that all the documents are with regard to Lower\n abdomen pain suffered by the deceased. It is further\n argued that DW-1 and DW-2 cannot even identify the\n signature of the doctors whose signature was there on the\n documents, they cannot be relied upon. It is further\n argued that DW-4 has submitted that the summoned\n record was destroyed hence, it did not prove anything. It\n is further argued that in their statement\n u/s. 313\n Cr. P.C.\n the accused no.1 has admitted that he deliberately gave\n false and fake address in the medical papers showing the\n treatment of the deceased Bhawna. It is further argued\n that in his statement, accused No.1 again tried to create a\n theory that when he alongwith Meena and Bimla was\n taking the deceased to Ganga Ram Hospital by auto/TSR,\n Bhawna was conscious and she told them that she had\n been bitten by some insect. It is further argued that he is\n lying to save himself under the concocted theory of insect\n bite which is falsified by the medical proofs. It is further\n argued that the accused persons have not been able to\n explain all the incriminating medical evidence and Ex.\n PW-19/A and the submission of Inspector Harish Kumar\n who punctured the theory of insect bite which is again\n proved by Ex. PW-7/CFSL report whereby ALP was\n found the reason and cause of death which cannot be due\n to insect bite as per PW-21.\n \nIt is further argued that in a\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs.

Appeal no. 301/2015 titled Balvir\n Singh vs state of Uttarakhand, the Hon'ble SC in para 29\n has mentioned that \"in such circumstances, the only\n inference can be drawn is that the Aluminium Phosphide\n either in liquid form or in the form of tablets was\n procured by the accused husband and the same was\n administered to the deceased\" and the theory of suicide as\n sought to be put forward on behalf of appellant/accused is\n ruled out. It is further argued that in the instant case also,\n the theory of suicide is ruled out by the facts and\n circumstances and it gets proved that the the only\n inference can be had that the accused persons procured\n ALP and administered it to the deceased and created a\n concocted theory of Insect Bite. It is thus prayed that the\n accused persons be convicted for the alleged offences.\n\nLAW, ANALYSIS, AND FINDINGS\n\n45. This Court has heard the rival final arguments and\n perused the judicial record meticulously.\n\n46. The accused persons are prosecuted for the offences\n u/s\n 498A\n/\n304B\n/\n201\n/\n302\n/\n34\n IPC. The prosecution was under\n\n obligation to prove the following ingredients:\n\n a. That all the accused persons in furtherance of their\n common intention, jointly subjected deceased Bhawna\n to cruelty by demanding dowry and committed an\n offence under \nSection 498-A\n/\n34\n IPC.\n\n \nb. That all the accused persons jointly and in furtherance\n of their common intention caused the death of Smt.\n Bhawna within seven years of her marriage by\n subjecting her to cruelty for fulfillment of their demand\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 37 of 73\n of dowry and thereby committed an offence under\n \nSection 304B\n/\n34\n IPC.\n\n c. That accused Bhaskar and accused Praveen jointly and\n in furtherance of their common intention flushed out the\n floor where deceased Bhawna had vomited before she\n died and by doing so, they destroyed the evidence and\n thereby committed an offence under \nSection 201\n/\n34\n\n IPC.\n\n d. That all the accused persons jointly and in furtherance\n of their common intention caused the murder of Smt.\n Bhawna by administering Aluminium Phosphide (ALP)\n to her and thus committed the offence under \nSection\n 302\n/\n34\n IPC.\n\nFINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/\nS.\n498A\n IPC\n\n47. With reference to the first point, the prosecution was\n required to establish the fact that there was a demand of\n dowry and in furtherance thereof, deceased Bhawna was\n subjected to cruelty. In this regard, it is important to\n mention the essential components of \nSection 498-A\n IPC\n which are as follows:\n\n (i) That the perpetrator is the husband or relative\n of the husband of a woman.\n\n (ii) Such woman is subject to cruelty, which is:\n\n (a) Any wilful conduct which is likely to drive\n the woman to commit suicide or to cause\n grave injury or danger to life, limb or health,\n whether mental or physical.\n\n (b) Harassment with a view to coerce her or any\n person related to her to meet any unlawful\n demand for any property or valuable security.\n\n48. \nSection 498-A\n IPC was incorporated in the Act 1983 as a\n response to \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n. Cruelty as\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 38 of 73\n defined in this Section, consists of two Clauses as\n mentioned above in point (ii) (a) and (ii) (b). \nSection 498-\n A \nIPC postulates the wilful conduct on the part of\n perpetrator. Mensrea is an essential ingredient of the\n offence. Complainant, in order to substantiate her\n averments has to prove that there was an unlawful\n demand from husband or any of his relative.\n\n49. Now, adverting to the facts of the present case, the most\n important material public witnesses of the prosecution\n with regard to the allegations of demand of dowry and\n subjecting the deceased to cruelty are PW-2 Parvati Devi\n (Mother of deceased), PW-3 Naresh Kumar (Elder\n brother of deceased), PW-13 Indra (Neighbour of\n deceased), PW-15 Daulat Ram (Brother in law of\n deceased). This court shall now analyse the testimonies of\n these witnesses to conclude whether the alleged offence\n of \nSection 498A\n IPC is made out or not against the\n accused persons.\n\n50. PW-2 Parvati Devi (mother of deceased) in her testimony\n mainly alleged that at the time of marriage all the house-\n hold articles and jewellery were given to the accused\n persons, but they were not satisfied. She further alleged\n that the accused persons including the mother-in law\n (since expired) used to torture, harass and pressurize the\n deceased to bring money from her parents and as such,\n the accused persons were demanding dowry. She also\n alleged that she had given Rs.20,000/- on one occasion\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 39 of 73\n and Rs.25,000/- on another occasion to the in-laws of her\n deceased daughter. She also alleged that three days prior\n to the death of her daughter, when she had gone to drop\n her daughter to her in-laws' house, accused Bhaskar\n quarrelled with them and threatened her.\n\n51. Bare perusal of the examination-in-chief of PW-2 would\n reveal that there are no specific averments with regard to\n demand of dowry and subjecting the deceased Bhawna to\n cruelty. During her cross-examination, PW-2 herself has\n stated that accused Bhaskar loved his wife very much and\n they were living happy married life. PW-2 has further\n stated that since the day of marriage of her daughter\n Bhawna with accused Bhaskar till her death, she never\n made any complaint regarding demand of dowry, money,\n articles, assault or harassment.\n\n52. PW-3 Naresh Kumar (elder brother of deceased) in his\n testimony mainly alleged that huge amount was spent on\n the marriage of his sister with accused Bhaskar and\n household articles given to her in-laws. He alleged that\n after 6/7 months of her marriage, Bhawna's husband used\n to torture her and she was not allowed to visit her\n parental house. He alleged that accused Bhaskar used to\n talk in a rude manner and did not allow her to call her\n parents and that all the accused persons used to torture\n her for less dowry. He alleged that his sister deceased\n Bhawna told him that her husband Bhaskar, dewar\n Praveen, jeth Bhupender and mother-in-law Krishna Devi\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 40 of 73\n (since expired), used to torture, harass and pressurize her\n to bring more money and dowry from her parents. He\n alleged that on one occasion Rs.20,000/- was given and\n on another occasion Rs.25,000/- was given to her in-laws\n as pressurized by them alleging that they need this money\n for purchasing goods / material for their shop / business.\n\n53. During his cross-examination, PW-3 has stated that at the\n time of marriage of his sister Bhawna, he was residing in\n a tenanted house. PW-3 further admitted that his sister\n was suffering from gynaecological problem and was\n being treated at Lady Harding Hospital, AIIMS, Maharaja\n Agarsen Hospital, Dr. Mrs. Kochhar Clinic etc. PW-3\n also admitted that deceased Bhawna suffered two\n miscarriages and had also delivered pre-mature child.\n PW-3 also admitted that accused Bhaskar used to provide\n treatment to deceased Bhawna so that she could deliver\n healthy child and do not suffer pain. PW-3 further stated\n that whenever deceased Bhawna used to suffer any\n medical problem, accused Bhaskar used to take her to the\n doctor. It has also been admitted by PW-3 that his sister\n deceased Bhawna and accused Bhaskar used to love each\n other a lot. It is further stated by PW-3 that deceased\n Bhawna never made any complaint to the police, court or\n any other authority regarding harassment or dowry\n demand or beating. PW-3 also stated that last rites of\n deceased Bhawna were done by her husband accused\n Bhaskar and his family.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 41 of 73\n\n 54. PW-2 and PW-3 who are mother and brother of deceased\n Bhawna, are the vital public witnesses of prosecution and\n their testimonies are crucial for determining the\n culpability of the accused persons. A meticulous perusal\n of their testimonies would reveal that they do not inspire\n confidence of the Court. None of the duo alleged that at\n the time of marriage, there was a demand of dowry. They\n have also not claimed any articles given in dowry nor\n there is any allegation of \nSection 406\n IPC against accused\n persons. Both the witnesses have alleged two instances of\n making payment of Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- without\n any specific details and documentary proof.\n\n55. The other material witness PW-13 Smt. Indra who is\n stated to be the neighbour of accused persons and\n deceased Bhawna, has turned hostile and has not\n supported the prosecution case. She stated that on the day\n of incident, when she saw certain people gathering\n outside the house of accused persons and she inquired\n from Bhawna as to what has happened, to which Bhawna\n herself stated that some insect had bitten her. PW-13 was\n cross-examined by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State but of\n no benefit to the prosecution. During cross-examination,\n PW-13 stated that deceased Bhawna did not vomit in her\n presence. Certain Court questions were also put to the\n witness and in response to that, PW-13 stated that on the\n day of incident deceased Bhawna was lying on bed on\n ground floor and she was neither smeared with vomiting\n nor was emitting any foul smell. In her cross-\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 42 of 73\n examination by the accused persons, PW-13 stated that\n when she had talked with deceased Bhawna, she was\n conscious. PW-13 further stated that deceased Bhawna\n used to talk with her frequently and used to say that she\n was living in good condition in her matrimonial house.\n PW-13 further stated that deceased Bhawna was residing\n separately on the third floor with her husband. It is\n further stated by PW-13 that she had not heard that any\n demand for dowry was made or deceased Bhawna was\n harassed or beaten up for dowry. PW-13 has categorically\n stated that deceased Bhawna was living happily with her\n husband Bhaskar.\n\n56. The next witness PW-15 is Brother-in-law (Jija Ji) of\n deceased Bhawna who stated in his cross-examination\n that no demand of dowry was made in his presence.\n\n57. To add further, the accused persons examined DW-1 from\n AIIMS who produced the record pertaining to the\n medical history and treatment of deceased Bhawna at\n Gynae Department of AIIMS. DW-2 from Sardar Vallabh\n Bhai Patel Hospital produced the medical documents\n Mark B. DW-3 from Gynae Department, Lady Harding\n Medical College produced the medical record pertaining\n to deceased Bhawna for her treatment at Lady Harding\n Medical College for gynae problem. DW-4 Record Clerk\n from Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Punjabi Bagh produced\n medical record pertaining to the treatment of deceased\n Bhawna related to gynae problem, at their hospital.

It is not in dispute that the deceased by suffering from\n gynae problem for which she was under treatment at\n several medical institutions. Further, DW-6 Vijay Kumari\n stated that deceased Bhawna and accused Bhaskar were\n living happily and lovingly, on the third floor of the\n building having separate kitchen. She also deposed that\n deceased Bhawna used to share her feelings with her and\n she had never complained of any harassment, beatings or\n maltreatment given by her husband and her in-laws on\n account of dowry. She further stated that deceased\n Bhawna was suffering from lower abdomen pain and\n some gynae problem. DW-6 further stated that deceased\n Bhawna also delivered immature infants twice at AIIMS\n and thereafter, she was under depression and frustration.\n DW-6 further stated that deceased Bhawna was under\n\n treatment for above mentioned problem and accused\n Bhaskar used to take her to the hospital regularly. She\n deposed that deceased Bhawna was keen desirous to have\n a child due to which she was under depression. DW-6\n was cross examined on behalf of the State but no\n contradiction emerged in her statement.\n\n59. DW-7 Asha also stated that deceased Bhawna was\n suffering from lower abdomen pain and gynae problem,\n due to which deceased Bhawna went under depression\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 44 of 73\n and was undergoing treatment for the same. She further\n stated that accused Bhaskar used to love her and never\n harass her or demanded any dowry. DW-7 was cross-\n examined at length by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State but,\n no material contradiction has emerged in her cross\n examination.\n\n60. Accused Bhaskar examined himself as DW-5 and stated\n that deceased Bhawna was living happily with him. He\n further stated that deceased Bhawna was suffering from\n lower abdomen pain and gynae problem. She was being\n treated from AIIMS, Maharaj Agrasen Hospital, Sardar\n Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital, Dr. Mrs. Kochar and Lady\n Harding Hospital. He further stated that deceased\n Bhawna had delivered pre-mature infants at AIIMS and\n thereafter, she was under depression and tension. He\n further deposed that deceased Bhawna was given proper\n medical treatment for her problem till her death.\n\n61. It evinces from the aforementioned testimonies on record\n that though the prosecution witnesses are alleging that\n deceased Bhawna was treated badly and there was a\n demand of dowry by the accused persons but to the\n contrary, the defence witnesses including the accused\n Bhaskar as DW-5 are alleging that there was no demand\n of dowry and deceased Bhawna was treated properly and\n was also given proper medical treatment and was not\n subjected to cruelty. From the testimonies of prosecution\n witnesses, two instances of demand of Rs.20,000/- and\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 45 of 73\n Rs.25,000/- are coming out but there is no other instance\n of giving any cash or any article by the parents or brother\n of deceased Bhawna to any of the accused persons. It is\n needless to mention that mere allegations of demand of\n dowry would not suffice in themselves. These allegations\n have to be much more than mere averments itself. The\n burden to prove the specific allegation of demand of\n dowry is upon the prosecution and it was for the\n prosecution to prove the facts that dowry was demanded.\n The obligation was upon the prosecution to prove specific\n instances beyond one or two casual instances of payment,\n which should be put forward in the form of evidence,\n which is absent in the present case\n\n62. Though PW-2 and PW-3 have alleged that there was a\n demand of dowry however, they are not citing any\n specific incident except payment of money on two\n occasions. They themselves have stated that this money\n was given to the accused persons for their necessity as\n they had to do some business out of the said money. The\n defence witnesses and even the prosecution witnesses\n have deposed that deceased Bhawna used to love her\n husband and her husband was providing medical\n treatment to her. None of the PWs have disputed the fact\n that deceased Bhawna was being treated at various\n hospitals by her husband. It is not the case of prosecution\n that all the medical expenses of deceased Bhawna or her\n day to day household expenses occasionally, frequently\n or regularly were borne by the family of deceased and not\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 46 of 73\n by the husband. None of prosecution witnesses have\n deposed that the expenses of treatment of deceased were\n not borne by her husband.\n\n63. It is also not the case of prosecution that at the time of\n marriage, there was any demand of dowry or any dowry\n in the form of cash and jewellery etc. was given. There\n are no allegations of \nSection 406\n IPC against the accused\n persons.\n\n64. The testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 are nothing but oral\n evidence which could not be substantiated or\n corroborated by any concrete evidence. PW-2, PW-3 and\n PW-13 have deposed that accused Bhaskar and deceased\n Bhawna used to love each other. PW-16 and PW-17 have\n also deposed similar facts.\n\n65. Therefore, the testimonies of complainant and other\n prosecution witnesses cannot be said to qualify any of the\n essential ingredients of \nSection 498-A\n IPC. In different\n words, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses are\n insufficient to substantiate the allegations of dowry\n demand and subjecting the deceased to cruelty. Thus, the\n charge of \nSection 498A\n/\n34\n IPC does not stand proved\n against the accused persons.\n\nFINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/S 304B\n\nIPC\n\n66.

If other conditions are\n satisfied, when the deceased committed suicide, still the\n death comes within the scope of \nSection 304B\n IPC.\n\n69. \nSection 304B\n IPC has proximate nexus with \nsection 113A\n\n and \n113B\n Indian Evidence Act which lays down the\n presumption in such cases where death of a married\n woman occurs otherwise than under normal\n circumstances within 7 years of her marriage.\n\n70. \nSection 113A\n and \n113B\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n reads as under:-\n\n 113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a\n married woman.\n\n When the question is whether the commission of suicide\n by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any\n relative or her husband and it is shown that she had\n committed suicide within a period of seven years from\n the date of her marriage and that her husband or such\n relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the\n Court may presume, having regard to all the other\n circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been\n abetted by her husband or by such relative of her\n husband.\n\n Explanation.--- For the purposes of this section,\n \"cruelty\" shall have the same meaning as in \nsection\n 498A\n of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1960).\n\n 113B. Presumption as to dowry death.\n\n When the question is whether a person has committed\n the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon\n before her death such woman has been subjected by\n such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in\n connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall\n presume that such person had caused the dowry death.\n\n \nExplanation. --- For the purposes of this section\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 49 of 73\n \"dowry death\" shall have the same meaning as\n insection 304B of the \nIndian Penal Code\n (45 of 1960).\n\n71. In GV Sidaramesh Vs State of Karnataka, [(2010) 3\n SCC 152], it was held that there must be material to show\n that soon before the death of woman, such woman was\n subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection\n with demand of dowry, then only a presumption can be\n drawn that a person has committed the dowry death of a\n woman.\n\n72. It was further held in \nKailash Vs State of MP\n, [AIR 2007\n SC 107], that the words 'soon before' in \nsection 113B\n\n Evidence Act cannot be limited by fixing time limit. It is\n left to be determined by the courts, depending upon the\n facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n73. \nIn \nC.Veerudu Vs State of AP\n, [1989 CRLJ(NOC) 52\n (AP)], it was held in that so far as presumption under\n \nsection 113A\n Evidence Act is concerned, unless the\n offence\n u/s 498A\n IPC is established, no presumption can\n be invoked.\n\n74. From the above-mentioned precedents, it is clear that the\n death must be within seven years of marriage and it\n should be as a result of cruelty soon before her death and\n such cruelty should be related the dowry. In the present\n case, the prosecution has not been able to establish that\n there was a demand of dowry and the offence under\n \nSection 498-A\n IPC has been committed. \nIn such\n circumstances, the judgment \nC Veerudu\n (supra) applies\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 50 of 73\n with full force and vigour.\n\n75. Now, adverting back to the facts of the present case,\n PW-2 Smt. Parvati (mother of deceased) is the star\n witness of the prosecution. With regard to the cruelty\n soon before death or any other cruelty, it is conspicuous\n that PW-2 has not thrown much light in her entire\n examination-in-chief. There are only two instances\n regarding demand of dowry and cruelty as alleged by\n PW-2 in her examination-in-chief. She has stated that she\n gave Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- to the accused persons\n and when she had gone alongwith her daughter to her\n in-laws house to drop her there, accused Bhaskar\n quarrelled with them and also threatened her by saying\n that \"mai teri aankh phor donga\". Besides these facts, no\n other incident has been deposed with regard to the cruelty\n or harassment of deceased Bhawna, soon before her death\n or at any point of time.\n\n76. During her cross-examination, PW-2 has stated that the\n last rites of deceased Bhawna were performed by her in-\n laws. She also stated that no complaint was ever lodged\n with the police at any point of time before the death of\n deceased Bhawna. PW-2 has also admitted that deceased\n Bhawna was suffering from gynae problem and was\n treated in that regard by her husband accused Bhaskar.\n PW-2 during her cross examination categorically stated\n that accused Bhaskar loved his wife very much and they\n were living happy married life.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 51 of 73\n\n 77. If the evidence of PW-2 is to be considered as it is, it does\n not prove the essential ingredients of \nSection 304B\n IPC.\n In other words, testimony of PW-2 is not sufficient to\n bring the case of prosecution within the realm of \nSection\n 304B\n/\n34\n IPC.\n\n78. Coming to the testimony of PW-3 Naresh Kumar, he is\n the brother of deceased Bhawna and is a material witness.\n His testimony is most important for proving the story of\n prosecution. He stated that after the marriage of his sister\n deceased Bhawna, she was tortured by her husband for\n dowry, but no specific instance has been deposed by him.\n He has not disclosed as to how this fact came into his\n knowledge. He has not deposed whether he was witness\n to any such incident or someone else had told him. \nPW-3\n has clarified in this regard that his sister deceased\n Bhawna used to tell him that her husband, dewar\n Praveen, jeth Bhupender and mother-in-law (since\n expired) used to torture and harass her, but no details\n have been furnished by PW-3 as to when any such\n incident has happened. With regard to payment of\n Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/-, it is stated by PW-3 that it\n was given to deceased Bhawna for the reason that it was\n needed for purchasing of goods/material for their\n business/ shop. In cross examination, PW-3 stated that he\n suspects that his sister deceased Bhawna has been killed\n by accused persons. No specific detail or basis for such\n belief has been explained by PW-3 as to how he has\n reason to believe that it was accused persons who had\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 52 of 73\n killed his sister deceased Bhawna.\n\n79. With regard to allegations qua 'cruelty soon before death',\n PW-3 stated that deceased Bhawna was suffering from\n gynae problem however, accused Bhaskar used to provide\n treatment to her. He also stated that accused Bhaskar and\n deceased Bhawna used to love each other. He also\n admitted that no complaint was ever lodged to the police,\n court or any other authority qua dowry demand,\n harassment or beating. It is apparent that testimony of\n PW-3 also does not suffice for attracting \nSection 304B\n/\n34\n\n IPC against accused persons.\n\n80. The next important public witness examined by the\n prosecution is PW-13 Smt. Indra. She did not support the\n story of prosecution and stated that deceased Bhawna told\n her that some insect had bitten her. PW-13 further stated\n that deceased Bhawna did not vomit in her presence and\n when she saw deceased Bhawna on the day of incident,\n she was not smeared with vomiting nor there was any\n foul smell coming from her clothes.\n\n81. PW-15 Daulat Ram (brother-in-law of deceased) was the\n one who reached at the spot in question on 10.07.2008\n and saw that Bhawna was lying unconscious and upon\n inquiry, in-laws' of deceased Bhawna told that some\n insect bite on her arms. PW-15 also reached at Ganga\n Ram hospital on same day. Deceased Bhawna was in\n emergency ward of Ganga Ram hospital when PW-15\n made a call to the mother of deceased Bhawna about the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 53 of 73\n incident. It is stated by PW-15 that he came to know\n about the death of Bhawna on the next day. PW-15 in his\n cross-examination has stated that his wife Smt. Meena,\n sister of deceased Bhawna was not mentally fit. PW-15\n corroborated the fact that Bhawna (since deceased)\n delivered two dead infants at AIIMS. PW-15\n categorically stated that no demand of dowry was made\n in his presence. Thus, testimony of PW-15 is also of no\n benefit to the prosecution for the allegations regarding\n 304B/34 \nIPC\n against accused persons.\n\n82. PW-16 Smt. Bimla (Sister-in-law (Devrani) of deceased,\n is again a material witness who is stated to be residing in\n the same house at ground floor. She stated that on he day\n of incident at around 1:00 pm, she saw her sister-in-law\n Asha had gone to roof for drying the clothes. She also\n saw that Bhawna was lying on bed. Asha called her and\n said that Bhawna was not well. She has stated that\n Bhawna told her that one insect bit her on the right arm in\n the bathroom while she was taking the bath. Thereafter,\n Bhaskar, Praveen and Raj Kumar were called. \nOne doctor\n was also called who said that Bhawna got food poisoning\n and advised her to shift to Ganga Ram hospital. During\n her cross-examination, PW-16 has stated that when she\n reached in the room of Bhawna, she was conscious. She\n further stated that Bhawna and Bhaskar used to live\n happily and there was no complaint from her side against\n the accused persons. She further stated that Bhawna was\n disturbed as she had delivered two dead child and that she\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 54 of 73\n was also being treated at AIIMS. There is nothing in the\n testimony of PW-16 to support the allegations regarding\n 304B/34 \nIPC\n against accused persons.\n\n83. PW-17 Meena (sister of deceased) deposed that on the\n day of incident, when she reached the house of Bhawna,\n she saw that Bhawna was lying on bed and her hair were\n wet and tied. She further stated that foul smell was\n coming from the room and her clothes. One cloth in the\n size of bandage was tied on her arm. Her husband came\n after five minutes. When she inquired about the bandage\n on the arm of Bhawna, one of the sister-in-law of\n deceased Bhawna told that mosquito has bitten her.\n During her cross examination, PW-17 stated that\n deceased Bhawna had stated through her gestures that she\n was given something by syringe. PW-17, however,\n admitted that she is being treated for mental illness at\n RML hospital. She has further stated that she has deposed\n against the accused persons at the instance of her mother\n and brother and also being sister of deceased Bhawna. By\n admitting such fact, PW-17 has put her entire statement\n under doubt. \nShe herself has suggested that she is\n deposing at the instance of her mother, brother and being\n sister of deceased Bhawna. Thus, she seems to be an\n interested witness. Above all, she herself has admitted\n that she is getting treatment for mental illness from RML\n hospital for the last more than 5 years. Testimony of PW-\n 5 is does not substantiate nor it is reliable to prove the\n allegations of offence\n u/s. 304B\n/\n34\n IPC against the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 55 of 73\n accused persons.\n\nMEDICAL EVIDENCE\n\n84. Now coming to the medical evidence, Dr. Vikas Sharma\n had prepared the MLC of deceased Bhawna on the day of\n incident when she was taken to Ganga Ram hospital,\n however, he had left the services of the hospital. The\n prosecution examined PW-10 Dr. Sanjay Solanki who\n identified the handwriting and signature of Dr Vikas\n Shrama on the MLC of deceased Bhawna Ex.PW10/A.\n The MLC reflects the alleged history of insect bite and\n further states that patient was not fit for statement and\n referred to further department.\n\n85. Another important witness examined with regard to\n medical evidence is PW-5 Y.P. Malhotra, the Executive\n Magistrate who conducted inquest of deceased Bhawna.\n On 11/07/2008, he went to Ganga Ram Hospital and\n recorded the statement of Bhaskar, Parveen, Smt. Parwati\n (mother of deceased) and Naresh (brother of deceased).\n He proved his inquest report as Ex.PW5/C.\n\n86. Next crucial witness examined by prosecution is PW-12\n Dr. Amit Sharma who had conducted the post-mortem on\n the dead body of deceased Bhawna. PW-12 opined that\n the cause of death was poisoning due to Aluminium\n Phosphide and proved the Post-mortem report as\n Ex.PW12/A. During cross examination, PW-12 stated\n that most common mode of intake of Aluminium\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 56 of 73\n Phosphide is through oral routes in the form of tablet\n which are readily and easily available in open market. He\n categorically stated that it will not act if given via\n injection. He further stated that it is extremely difficult\n and virtually impossible to give an adult and healthy\n individual this tablet forcibly. He ruled out the possibility\n of an struggle of injury mark upon the deceased alleging\n that there was no evidence of any such sign.\n\n87. PW-20 Jitender Kumar is the witness from FSL Rohini\n who examined the blood sample etc pertaining to\n deceased Bhawna and in his report Ex.PW7/C, he opined\n that Ex.1A, Ex.1B, Ex.2B and Ex.2C were found\n containing phosphide and Ex.2A was found containing\n aluminium phosphide. No material contradiction has\n emerged from the cross examination of this witness.\n\n88. Apart from above, the remaining witnesses are police\n officials including IO who have conducted the\n investigation or remained apart thereof. It is important to\n mention here that neither the incident nor any part thereof\n has happened in the presence of any of the police officials\n which is a matter of record. Investigating officers of the\n case including other police officials have stated whatever\n has been alleged by the other witnesses and as mentioned\n in the charge-sheet which is not repeated here for the sake\n of brevity.\n\n89. Accused persons have also led their evidence in defence\n and examined 7 witnesses to prove that the deceased was\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 57 of 73\n suffering from gynae problems and was receiving\n treatments from different hospitals viz. AIIMS, Sardar\n Ballabh Bhai Patel hospital, Lady Harding Medical\n College, Maharaja Agrasen hospital and to prove that\n was under depression as she was unable to deliver a\n child. From the medical evidence led in defence, it\n evinces that the deceased had delivered immature, still\n born child twice and she was having difficulty in\n conceiving the child again due to which she was suffering\n from depression.\n\n90. From the careful perusal of the evidence on record, it is\n apparent that the prosecution is not able to shift the\n burden upon the accused that it were the accused persons\n who subjected deceased Bhawna to cruelty soon before\n her death and due to that she died. It is pertinent to\n mention that the nature of cause of death of Bhawna is\n not disputed. After considering the testimony of PW-12\n Dr. Amit Sharma who conducted the post-mortem of\n deceased and the testimony of PW-20 Jitender Kumar\n from FSL, it transpires that poisonous substance i.e.\n Aluminium Phosphide was found in her body. In other\n words, the death of Bhawna was not natural for the\n reason that the cause of death was due to poisonous\n substance by the name of Aluminium Phosphide.\n\n91. None of the prosecution witnesses, be it PW-2 Parvati\n Devi or PW-3 Naresh Kumar or PW-16 Bimla or PW-17\n Meena has stated anything in this regard that soon before\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 58 of 73\n her death Bhawna was subjected to cruelty by the\n accused persons. As concluded earlier, the testimonies of\n the PWs do not even qualify the essential ingredients of\n \nSection 498A\n IPC itself. It is apparent that the IO during\n the investigation has not been able to collect any concrete\n evidence qua cruelty upon deceased Bhawna. In these\n circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion\n that the prosecution case has not crossed the threshold\n required to raise the most basic and essential presumption\n under \nSection 113B\n Evidence Act and thus, it has not\n been able to establish the offence\n u/s 304B\n IPC against\n the accused persons.\n\n92. It is needless to say that \nSection 113B\n Evidence Act lays\n down a presumption, however, there has to be some\n sufficient and cogent material on which such presumption\n is based. It has come on record that Bhawna (since\n deceased) did not die naturally as some poisonous\n substance by the name of Aluminium Phosphide was\n found in her body which is the cause of her death. There\n is nothing on record to suggest that the said poisonous\n substance was administered to her by the accused\n persons. This Court is of the opinion that the prosecution\n has failed to prove the culpability of accused persons\n beyond reasonable doubt that they had subjected Bhawna\n to cruelty soon before her death and thereby caused her\n death or that her death was caused due to their actions.\n\n93. To recapitulate, the following position emerges after\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 59 of 73\n consideration of evidence on record:\n\n A) It is a matter of record that marriage of Bhawna\n (since deceased) took place with accused Bhaskar in Feb\n 2006 and she had expired on 11.07.2008. The death is\n therefore, within the seven years of her marriage. It is\n also reflected from the record that the death is not natural\n as per post-mortem report and the cause of her death is\n due to poisoning by Aluminium Phosphide.\n\n B) The allegations of demand of dowry are raised,\n however, except payment of cash on two occasions i.e.\n Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- there is no evidence\n available on record. There is no specific details and no\n documentary proof. Further, with regard to payment of\n such cash, PW-2 and PW-3 have themselves stated that\n accused persons demanded this money for their necessity\n i.e. for their business purpose. If, this submission is\n presumed to be correct, even then it is not leading to\n conclusive demand of dowry by the accused persons.\n\n C) None of the public witness has stated with certainty\n that accused Bhaskar or other accused persons used to\n torture the deceased or subject her to cruelty. To the\n contrary, it has been said by all the public witnesses and\n more particularly PW-2 Parvati Devi (mother of deceased\n Bhawna) and PW-3 Naresh Kumar (brother of deceased\n Bhawna) that accused Bhaskar and Bhawna (since\n deceased) were living happily and lovingly.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 60 of 73\n D) With regard to cruelty, either with regard to \nSection\n 498-A\n IPC or \nSection 304-B\n IPC under the qualification\n 'soon before her death', none of the PWs have thrown\n any light on this subject. It is not the case of prosecution\n nor it is alleged by PW-2 and PW-3 that there was\n demand of dowry at the time of marriage or thereafter.\n They did not depose that dowry either in the form of cash\n or jewellery was given, as per the requirement and\n demand of accused persons. There is a difference\n between gift given at the time of marriage and dowry.\n The difference though, is a thin line difference, however,\n is of great importance and entirely depend upon the\n testimonies of prosecution witnesses. Testimonies of any\n of the prosecution witnesses, in this regard, do not inspire\n the confidence of this Court.\n\n \nE) PW-13, PW-15, and PW-16 are the most important\n witnesses who had seen the deceased just before her\n death. None of these witnesses have said anything with\n regard to any cruelty caused upon the deceased. To the\n contrary, all these witnesses have stated that they were\n told by deceased that some insect had bitten up on her\n arm. PW-17 Meena (sister of deceased) deposed that\n when she reached at the house of Bhawna (since\n deceased), she was lying on bed and upon inquiry,\n Bhawna (since deceased) herself had stated that some\n mosquito had bitten her. None of these prosecution\n witnesses have alleged that Bhawna (since deceased) had\n stated that either something was injected into her or she\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 61 of 73\n was given some tablets orally against her wishes.\n\n F) It has come on record that the death of Bhawna\n (since deceased) was not natural and as per report from\n FSL, poisonous substance by the name of Aluminium\n Phosphide was found in her body. However, prosecution\n has not been able to collect any evidence as to how such\n poisonous substance went into the body of the deceased.\n The possibility of any force or struggle or taking such\n poisonous substance through injection has been ruled out\n by PW-12 Dr. Amit Sharma.\n\n G) PW-13 Smt. Indra (neighbour of accused persons\n and deceased) stated that deceased used to share all her\n feelings with her but she never complained against\n accused persons that she was harassed or subjected to\n cruelty.\n\n H) No complaint is stated to has been lodged against\n the accused persons either by Bhawna or by her parents\n or brother at any point of time that accused persons used\n to demand dowry or that she was subjected to cruelty or\n harassment.\n\n \nI) It is also reflected from the evidence on record that\n Bhawna was having some gynae problem for which she\n was being treated at various hospitals and clinic. It has\n also not been disputed that Bhawna had given birth to\n two still born premature children and as she was not able\n to have any child, therefore, she was under some kind of\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 62 of 73\n depression.\n\n94. In the light of aforementioned discussions, this Court is\n of the considered opinion that prosecution has not been\n able to establish the offence\n u/s 304B\n/\n34\n IPC against the\n accused persons.\n\nFINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/S 201\n\nIPC\n\n95. Now coming to the charge\n u/s. 201\n/\n34\n IPC against\n accused Bhaskar and Praveen, this offence depends upon\n the prime offence under \nSection 304-B\n IPC. In other\n words, concealing or removing the evidence by the\n accused persons is always dependent upon and subject to\n the commission of main substantive crime. As concluded\n above, the evidence available on record is not sufficient\n to establish that Bhawna (since deceased) died due to\n cruelty which was soon before her death, by the accused\n persons. With regard to \nSection 201\n IPC, though\n prosecution has examined PW-14 Dev Shankar Singh and\n PW-15 Daulat Ram who had come to the spot, however,\n they have not stated with certainty that there was any\n vomiting found spread on the spot. Only one witness i.e.\n PW-17 Meena has stated that she had observed foul smell\n coming from the room and the clothes of Bhawna,\n however, she also did not see any vomiting on the floor or\n at any other place. No other PW has stated anything in\n this regard that he or she saw vomit at the place of\n incident.\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 63 of 73\n\n 96. PW-14 Dev Shankar Singh is an independent witness\n who reached at the spot and had examined Bhawna. PW-\n 14 had also not seen anything either on the bed or at the\n floor. PW-14 had stated that he saw some water on the\n floor. If, the testimony of PW-14 is presumed to be\n correct, even then it cannot be said with certainty that the\n water found on the floor was there in order to wash the\n vomiting. Thus, the testimonies of all the PWs available\n on record are not sufficient to conclude any of the\n essential ingredients of \nSection 201\n IPC. Thus, the\n prosecution has failed to establish its case for the offence\n under \nSection 201\n/\n34\n IPC against the accused persons.\n\nFINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/S 302\n\nIPC\n\n97. The accused persons are alternatively charged\n u/s. 302\n\n IPC consequent to the observations of the Hon'ble High\n Court of Delhi in the Judgment on appeal. Regarding the\n allegations of murder of deceased by the accused persons,\n it is pertinent to mention that there is no direct evidence.\n Adverting to the circumstantial evidence, there is no\n proof on record that the accused persons were present on\n the spot when the alleged incident had taken place.\n\n98.

The statement of PW-2 Parvati Devi Ex PW2/A was\n recorded by the IO wherein she raised that allegations of\n harassment of deceased Bhawna and dowry demand and\n causing of death of deceased by the accused persons. On\n such statement of PW-2, the present FIR was registered.\n\n101. As per prosecution story PW-16 Bimla (jethani of\n deceased) was informed on 10.07.2008 by her devrani\n Asha, about the ill health of the deceased Bhavna. PW-16\n went to the deceased who told her that one insect had\n bitten on her arm in the bathroom. After that accused\n persons Bhaskar (husband of deceased), Praveen (jeth of\n deceased) and Rajkumar were called. The sister and\n brother in law of deceased were also called. One doctor\n was also called.\n\n102. The sister of deceased namely Meena (PW-17) on\n receiving the said information, reached at the house of\n her sister Bhawna and there, jethani of the deceased told\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 65 of 73\n her that mosquito had bitten her. In evidence, Meena\n admitted that she has given statement to police wherein\n she had stated that her sister Bhawna had told her that\n some insect had bitten on her left arm.\n\n103. PW-15 Daulat Ram (brother in law of deceased and\n husband of PW-17) also on receiving information reached\n at the house of deceased, where the deceased was found\n unconscious and her in laws informed him that she was\n bitten by some insect.\n\n104. PW-14 Dev Shanker Singh was the assistant at the clinic\n of Dr Rakesh Malhotra. He was asked by one person to\n accompany him as the doctor has already left. He went to\n the spot and found one female lying on bed and on\n asking, she indicated towards her arm. The family\n members present there told him that some insect had\n bitten her. He advised them to take the patient\n immediately to Ganga Ram Hospital.\n\n105. The MLC Ex PW10/A of deceased reveals that she was\n brought to Ganga Ram Hospital by her husband accused\n Bhaskar at about 3.00 pm on 10.07.08 with the alleged\n history of insect bite on 10.07.08 at around 11 am. She\n was not fit for statement.\n\n106. During treatment, the deceased Bhawna expired on\n 11.07.08 at about 3.30 am. Post-mortem was conducted\n on the dead body of deceased vide PM report Ex PW12/A\n and the opinion regarding cause of death was reserved for\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 66 of 73\n after the viscera chemical analysis, blood sample and soft\n tissue report.\n\n107. The FSL report Ex PW7/A revealed that stomach and\n piece of small intestine was found to contain \"Aluminium\n Phosphide\" and the blood, pieces of liver, spleen and\n kidney were found to contain \"Phosphide\".\n\n108. Vide subsequent opinion report Ex PW12/B, Dr Amit\n Sharma opined regarding cause of death as follows:\n\n \"Answers to the query asked by IO :- Since it is clearly\n mentioned in the viscera report that Aluminium\n Phosphide was detected in stomach and intestines,\n therefore it was taken orally. Poisoning by Aluminium\n Phosphide is usually suicidal in manner.\"\n\n109. Vide further report Ex PW12/DA, Dr Amit Sharma\n responded to the queries posed by the IO as follows:\n\n \"Q-1 Whether Aluminium Phosphide can be given\n through injection or tablet easily available in open\n market?\n\n Ans:- Most common mode of intake of Aluminium\n Phosphide is through oral route in the form of tablets\n of Aluminium Phosphide that are readily available in\n the open market. It will not act if given via injection.\n\n Q-2 Whether it can be given forcibly to anyone and\n what is the status in this case?\n\n Ans:- It is extremely difficult and virtually impossible to\n given an adult healthy individual this tablet forcibly. As\n there were no evidence of any any signs of struggle\n injury marks in this case therefore the deceased\n possibly taken the tablet herself.\n\n Q-3 How much quantity of Aluminium Phosphide is\n sufficient to cause death in human beings?\n\n Ans:- One tablet of Aluminium Phosphide is fatal if\n consumed by as person.\"\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 67 of 73\n\n 110. In the subsequent opinion/report dated 12.08.16 by Dr\n Amandeep Kaur, Assistant Professor, Department of\n Forensic Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and\n Lok Nayak Hospital, stated as under:\n\n \"Ques.3. During the FSL examination of other two\n samples i.e. blood and viscera, FSL, Rohini opined that\n Aluminium Phosphide is found in the body of the\n deceased. Kindly opine whether the above mentioned\n poison is taken orally and otherwise. Also, you are\n requested to please opine whether any insect bite can\n cause the above mentioned poison, i.e. Aluminium\n Phosphide.\n\n Ans.3. The commonest route of poisoning in case of\n Aluminium Phosphide is through ingestion of the\n compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution which\n is easily available. However, poisoning can occur\n through inhalation of vapours or through injection of\n the compound in solution form. Insect bite does not\n cause Aluminium Phosphide poisoning.\"\n\n111. Apparently, though Dr Amandeep Kaur opined that the\n death in this case was due to Aluminium phosphide\n poisoning but she also mentioned that \"the said\n poisoning can occur ...through injection of compound in\n solution form\".\n\n112. Thus, the opinions of Dr Amit Sharma (PW-12) and Dr\n Amandeep Kaur were prima-facie contradictory to each\n other. \nIn this regard, Dr Amandeep Kaur was examined in\n court as PW-21 and she proved has report as Ex.\n PW21/A. She deposed that commonest route of poisoning\n in case of aluminium phosphide is through ingestion of\n compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution which\n is easily available, however, poisoning can occur through\n inhalation of vapours or through injection of the\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 68 of 73\n compound in solution form. She deposed that insect bite\n does not cause aluminium phosphide poisoning.\n\n113. During cross examination, she admitted that she has no\n personal knowledge about this case. She was not the head\n of the department at the that time when she had given the\n opinion Ex.PW21/A. She denied the suggestion that she\n was not authorized by the HOD to give opinion\n Ex.PW21/A or that she herself gave the opinion to SI\n Mohit Malik as per her convenience. She stated that she\n is doctor of medicine (MD) in Forensic Medicine and she\n did not conduct any research in the chemicals i.e.\n hazardous chemical, poison or other chemical even used\n in the farming or in other fields and she did not conduct\n research in respect of Aluminium Phosphide (ALP). She\n voluntarily deposed that they in forensic medicine do see\n cases/conduct postmortems which subsequently have\n been alleged to die of Aluminium Phosphide (ALP) or\n thereafter confirmed by forensic science laboratory\n report.\n\n114. PW-21 further stated that she does not have any\n knowledge in respect of Aluminium Phosphide. She\n stated that she relied upon the encyclopedia, her seniors\n research and their books, scientific literatures etc. in\n respect of ALP. She admitted that acute Aluminium\n Phosphide poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning;\n mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent commonly\n accidental and rarely homicidal. She admitted that ALP is\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 69 of 73\n used as rodenticide, weedicide or pesticide in grain,\n wheat, rice etc. in tablets form and that ALP is available\n in only powder and tablet forms. She admitted that if ALP\n comes in contact with water or moisture in air, it releases\n phosphine gas which vaporises in air. She admitted that\n after release of phosphine gas, the residue powder is\n harmless. She admitted that on coming to contact with\n moisture present in air (or with HCL or and water in the\n stomach), ALP liberates phosphine leaving behind\n Aluminium Hydroxide (or chloride) which is harmless\n and non toxic. She admitted that commonly, ALP cannot\n be given by force homicidally as it emits very bad smell\n like rotten fish and garlic. She further stated that as far as\n she knew the absorption of ALP through intact skin is\n rare, hence, if it causes burning on the skin (by ALP or\n phosphine) is not known to her.\n\n115. After seeing the PM report and the opinion given by Dr.\n Amit Sharma, PW-21 stated that the deceased Bhavna\n had taken ALP orally in the present case as per the FSL\n report already Ex.PW-7/C. She stated that any tablet\n /poison tablet when taken orally do appear in blood either\n by absorption or after metabolism.\n\n116. The allegations against the accused persons are that they\n caused murder of the deceased by administering\n Aluminium Phosphide (ALP) to her. It is one of the\n allegation that the deceased was given some poisonous\n substance through injection on her arm. First of all, it is\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 70 of 73\n confirmed through forensic evidence that the deceased\n has expired due to Aluminium Phosphide poisoning. Now\n coming to the question whether the same was\n administered to her through injection, the answer comes\n out to be in negative. PW-21 specifically admitted that\n when ALP comes in contact with water, phosphine gas is\n released and the residue is harmless. Thus, ALP could not\n have been administered in solution form through\n injection. Moreover, PW-21 after going thought the PM\n report and the opinion given by Dr Amit Sharma\n categorically deposed that the deceased had taken the\n ALP orally in the present case. PW-12 Amit Sharma also\n in clear terms reported that since the ALP was found in\n blood, stomach and intestines, it was taken orally. Thus,\n there remained no contradiction in the reports of PW-12\n and PW-21.\n\n117. It is the case of prosecution that the deceased was given\n ALP forcefully, then in this context, it is important to read\n the cross examination of PW-21 wherein she states that\n the mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent\n commonly accidental and rarely homicidal. She also\n admitted that commonly the ALP cannot be given by\n force homicidally as it emits very bad smell like rotten\n fish and garlic. \nIn the report Ex. PW12/DA, Dr Amit\n Sharma reported that it is extremely difficult and virtually\n impossible to give an adult heathy individual this tablet\n forcibly and as there were no evidence of any sign of\n struggle injury marks in this case therefore, the deceased\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 71 of 73\n possibly took the tablet herself.\n\nSKIN SAMPLE OF DECEASED\n\n118. The judicial record reflects that vide order dated\n 29.04.2017, the Addl. PP for State prayed that the skin\n sample of the deceased be sent for obtaining expert\n opinion as to whether the alleged bite mark on the skin of\n the deceased was made by insect or by injection. The ld.\n Predecessor observed that since this facility is not stated\n to be available in FSL Rohini and FSL CBI (Lodhi Road),\n therefore, it was directed that the samples be sent to\n CFSL Hyderabad to obtain the expert opinion. The order\n dated 28.02.2018 of the ld. Predecessor of this Court\n records the report of CFSL Hyderabad that facility for\n giving the requisite opinion is not available and therefore,\n no opinion could be given. As such, the sample of skin\n collected from the deceased lend no credit to the\n prosecution case.\n\n119. There is nothing on record to suggest that the accused\n persons administered ALP to the deceased. There is no\n direct or circumstantial evidence to connect the accused\n persons to the alleged crime. Thus, the offence u/s.\n 302/\n34\n does not also stand proved against the accused\n persons.\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION\n\n120. For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that the\n prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against\n\nFIR No. 126/2008 \nState Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.\nPS Prasad Nagar\n, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34 \nIPC\n 72 of 73\n the accused persons beyond reasonable doubts. The\n benefit of doubt goes in favour of the accused persons.\n\n121. Hence, all the accused persons namely Bhaskar, Praveen\n @ Pappu and Bhupinder are acquitted for the offences\n under \nSection 498-A\n/\n304-B\n/\n201\n/\n302\n/\n34\n IPC, charged\n against them.\n\n122.

I do\n not have any knowledge in respect of aluminium\n phosphide. I rely upon the encyclopedia, my seniors\n research and their books, scientific literatures etc. in\n respect of ALP. It is correct that acute aluminium\n phosphide poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning;\n mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent\n commonly accidental and rarely homicidal. It is\n correct that ALP used as rodenticide, weedicide or\n pesticide in grain, wheat, rice etc. in tablets form.\n ALP is available in only powder and tablet forms.\n It is correct that ALP used in fumigant and oral\n pesticide. It is correct that if ALP comes in contact\n with water or moisture in air, it releases phosphine gas\n which vaporises in air. It is correct that after release of\n phosphine gas, the residue powder is harmless. It is\n also correct that on coming to contact with moisture\n present in air (or with HCL or and water in the\n stomach), ALP liberates phosphine leaving behind\n aluminium hydroxide(or chloride) which is harmless\n and non toxic. The contents of the textbook of Forensic\n Medicine and Toxicology are correct which is written\n by Dr. Anil Aggarwal (retired Director Professor). He\n was my senior. I have seen the book today in the Court.\n It is correct that commonly the ALP cannot be given by\n force homicidally as it emits very bad smell like rotten\n fish and garlic. As far as I know the absorption of ALP\n through intact skin is rare, hence, if it causes burning\n on the skin (by ALP or phosphine) is not known to me.\n I cannot say regarding the mode of intake of ALP in\n this case if it was ingested, injected or inhaled. I know\n Dr. Amit Sharma. Dr. Amit Sharma is senior and\n expert. I have seen the postmortem report and opinion\n given by Dr. Amit Sharma. The deceased Bhavna had\n taken ALP orally in the present case as per the FSL\n report already Ex.PW-7/C. Any tablet / poison tablet\n when taken orally do appear in blood either by\n absorption or after metabolism. It is wrong to suggest\n that I gave my opinion to the police at the instance of\n the IO and complainant. It is wrong to suggest that I\n am deposing falsely.\""
