The petitioner has also\nprayed that this court shall direct the learned arbitrator to deposit in this court all\n\nthe records, paper and proceedings of the arbitration between the respondent no. 1\n\n(original claimant) and the society i.e. Apsara Coop. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. By the\nimpugned award the learned arbitrator had declared that the MOU dated 30 th April,\n2008 executed between M/s. Heritage Enterprises (original claimant in arbitration\n\nproceedings and respondent no. 1 herein) and Apsara Coop. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. is valid\nsubsisting, enforceable and binding upon those parties and that the claimant is\nentitled to specific performance thereof.\n\n2. At the threshold Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1\nraises a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this petition. In view of the\nissue of maintainability raised by the learned senior counsel for respondent no. 1 I\nhave heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioner as well as the respondent\nno. 1 on the issue of maintainability of this petition filed by the petitioners.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n3/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n3. Mr.Samdani learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1 submits that the\n\nmemorandum of understanding which recorded an arbitration agreement was\nbetween the respondent no. 1 developer and M/s. Apsara Co-op. Hsg. Soc., Ltd a\n\nsociety registered under the provisions of\nMaharashtra Co-operative Societies Act,\n. The said society consists of 24 tenements allotted to 24 persons who are\nmembers of the said society. Petitioners are three of the members of the said\n\nsociety. Learned senior counsel submits that the petitioners were not parties to the\nsaid memorandum of understanding which contained arbitration agreement. It is\n\nsubmitted that the society had passed a resolution pursuant to which dispute was\nreferred to arbitration. The petitioners were not parties to the arbitration\n\nproceedings as they were not parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n4. It is submitted that since the petitioners were not parties to the arbitration\nagreement, petitioners cannot file a petition under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, for impugning an arbitral award. In support of this submission\n\nlearned senior counsel invited my attention to\nsection 34\nand also definition of\n\n'Party' defined under\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Act. It is submitted by the learned\nsenior counsel that only a party to the arbitration agreement can file a petition\n\nunder\nsection 34\nof the Act and not an outsider. It is submitted that\nsection 34\nhas\nto be read with\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Act. There is no general power under\nsection\nof the Act to permit a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement to\nfile a petition for impugning an arbitral award. It is submitted that the said Apsara\n\nCo. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. who was party to the arbitration agreement and also before the\nlearned arbitrator has accepted the arbitral award by passing a resolution. The\nimpugned award has been acted upon by the society. The petitioners who are\nmembers of the society thus cannot be allowed to impugn the arbitral award as\nthey were not parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n4/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n5. Learned senior counsel submits that this court has no power to grant any\n\nleave to the petitioners to file arbitration petition and to impugn the arbitral award.\nIt is submitted that this is not an appellate proceeding in which a party aggrieved\n\ncan apply for leave to file an appeal. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on\n\nsection 36\nof the Mah. Coop. Societies Act, 1960 and submits that the society\nhaving registered is a body corporate and thus society only can be sued or sue in its\n\nown name. Society has to act through the committee. No members can file any\nproceedings on behalf of the society. It is submitted that the members of the\n\nsociety speak through society and has no independent say.\nIn support of this\nsubmission, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of Division\n\nBench of this court in case of\nGirish Mulchand Mehta Vs. Mahesh S.Mehta &\nAnr.\n2010 (1) All MR 719 and in particular paragraphs 15 and 16 which read thus :\n\n15. The Appellants would then rely on the decision of the Apex\nCourt in\nRamesh Himmatlal Shah v. Harsukh Jadhavji Joshi\n\nreported in MANU/SC/0531/1975 : AIR 1975 SC 1470 to\n\ncontend that the flats in question occupied by them have been\nallotted to them by the Housing Society which allotment is\n\ncoupled with the right to transfer their shares of the Society\nand interest in the said flat which is the property of the Society.\n\nIn\nthe said decision\n, the Apex Court has observed that the right\nso enjoyed by the member is the species of the property\n\nnamely the right to occupy a flat of this type, which assumes\nsignificant importance and acquires under the law a stamp of\ntransferability in furtherance of interest of commerce. It went\non to observe that there is no fetter in any of the legal\nprovisions against such a conclusion and for which reason the\n\nattachment and sale of the property of the member in execution\nof the decree are valid under the law. The legal position\nexpounded by the Apex Court in\nthe said decision\nwill be of no\navail to the case on hand. The crucial question is whether the\nmembers can be heard to say that their rights in the flats\noccupied by them were dehors the rights of the Society therein\nand that they were not claiming under the Society at all. In our\nconsidered opinion such stand of the members(Appellants\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n5/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nherein) cannot be countenanced.\n\n16. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the General\nBody of the Society which is supreme, has taken a conscious\n\ndecision to redevelop the suit building. The General Body of\nthe Society has also resolved to appoint the Respondent No. 1\nas the Developer. Those decisions have not been challenged at\nall. The Appellants who were members of the Society at the\n\nrelevant time, are bound by the said decisions. The Appellants\nin the dispute filed before the Cooperative Court have only\nchallenged the Resolution dated 27/4/2008, which challenge\nwould merely revolve around the terms and conditions of the\n\nDevelopment Agreement.\nAs a matter of fact, the General\nBody of the Society has approved the terms and conditions of\n\nthe Development Agreement by overwhelming majority.\nMerely because the terms and conditions of the Development\nAgreement are not acceptable to the Appellants, who are in\n\nminuscule minority (only two out of twelve members), cannot\nbe the basis not to abide by the decision of the overwhelming\nmajority of the General Body of the Society. By now it is well\nestablished position that once a person becomes a member of\nthe Cooperative Society, he looses his individuality with the\n\nSociety and he has no independent rights except those given to\n\nhim by the statute and Bye-laws. The member has to speak\nthrough the Society or rather the Society alone can act and\nspeaks for him qua the rights and duties of the Society as a\nbody (see\nDaman Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab\nreported in\n\nMANU/SC/0392/1985 : AIR 1985 SC 973).\n\nThis view has\nbeen followed in the subsequent decision of the Apex Court in\nthe case of\nState of U.P. v. Chheoki Employees Cooperative\nSociety Ltd.\nreported in MANU/SC/0332/1997 : AIR 1997 SC\n1413. In this decision the Apex Court further observed that the\n\nmember of Society has no independent right qua the Society\nand it is the Society that is entitled to represent as the\ncorporate aggregate. The Court also observed that the stream\ncannot rise higher than the source. Suffice it to observe that so\nlong as the Resolutions passed by the General Body of the\nRespondent No. 2 Society are in force and not overturned by a\nforum of competent jurisdiction, the said decisions would bind\nthe Appellants. They cannot take a stand alone position but are\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n6/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nbound by the majority decision of the General Body. Notably,\nthe Appellants have not challenged the Resolutions passed by\n\nthe General Body of the Society to redevelop the property and\nmore so, to appoint the Respondent No. 1 as the Developer to\n\ngive him all the redevelopment rights. The propriety rights of\nthe Appellants herein in the portion (in respective flats) of the\nproperty of the Society cannot defeat the rights accrued to the\nDeveloper and/or absolve the Society of its obligations in\n\nrelation to the subject matter of the Arbitration Agreement. The\nfact that the relief prayed by the Respondent No. 1 in\nSection 9\n\nPetition and as granted by the Learned Single Judge would\naffect the propriety rights of the Appellants does not take the\n\nmatter any further. For, the propriety rights of the Appellants in\nthe flats in their possession would be subservient to the\n\nauthority of the General Body of the Society. Moreso, such\nrights cannot be invoked against the Developer (Respondent\nNo. 1) and in any case, cannot extricate the Society of its\n\nobligations under the Development Agreement. Since the relief\nprayed by the Respondent No. 1 would affect the Appellants,\nthey were impleaded as party to the proceedings under\nSection\nof the Act, which was also necessitated by virtue of Rule\n803E of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. The\n\nsaid Rule reads thus:\n\n\" R803E. Notice of Filling Application to persons likely to\nbe affected.-\n\nUpon any application by petition under the Act, the\nJudge in chambers shall, if he accepts the petition, direct\nnotice thereof to be given to all persons mentioned in the\npetition and to such other persons as may seem to him to be\nlikely to be affected by the proceedings, requiring all or any\n\nof such persons to show cause, within the time specified in\nthe notice, why the relief sought in the petition should not\nbe granted.\"\n\n6. Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel submits that since the petition filed by\nthe petitioners itself is not maintainable this court cannot enter into the merits of\nthe matter and any adjudication on merits in these circumstances would be without\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n7/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\njurisdiction.\nIn support of this submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance\n\non the judgment of Supreme Court in case of\nT.K.Lathika Vs. Seth Karsandas\nJamnadas\n(1999) 6 SCC 632 and in particular paragraph 9. It is submitted that the\n\nsaid M/s. Apsara Coop. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. who were the parties to the arbitration\nproceedings have not been even impleaded as party respondent to this proceedings.\n\n7. Mr. Thacker learned senior counsel for petitioners in reply to the preliminary\nobjection raised by Mr. Samdani, learned senior counsel submits that the\n\npetitioners are admittedly the members of the said society. It is submitted that the\npetitioners being allottees of flats have right and interest to occupy their respective\n\nflats which rights can be even sold/transferred and can be attached in execution of\nthe decree. It is submitted that since the society has in collusion with the\n\nrespondent no. 1 has not impugned the arbitral award which was rendered against\nthe society and in favour of the respondent no. 1 developer which affected the\nrights of the petitioners, petitioners being parties affected by the impugned award,\n\nare entitled to exercise their rights under\nsection 34\nof the said Act to impugn such\n\narbitral award.\n\n8. Learned senior counsel submits that even minority members of the society\ncan challenge an arbitral award if the majority members have decided not to\nchallenge the arbitral award for any reasons. It is submitted by the learned senior\ncounsel that though petitioners were not parties to the arbitration proceedings,\n\nsince the liability of the society as well as members are now crystalized under the\nsaid award and the rights of the petitioners having been affected and prejudiced,\npetitioners are entitled to challenge the impugned award. It is submitted by the\nlearned senior counsel that this court has wide powers to grant leave to the\npetitioners to challenge the impugned award. Learned senior counsel submits\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n8/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nthat the petitioners have very good chances of succeeding in this petition on merits\n\nand this court therefore, shall grant such leave in favour of the petitioners to\nimpugn the arbitral award.\n\n9. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in case of Ramesh Himmatlal Shah Vs. Harsukh Jadhavji Joshi AIR 1975\n\nSC 1470 and in particular paragraphs 17 and 18 in support of the submission that\nthe flat in a tenant co-partnership housing society under the Maharashtra Co-\n\noperative\nSocieties Act\nis liable to attachment and sale in execution of the decree\nagainst the member who has been allotted flat by the society and is accordingly\n\nparty aggrieved., Paragraphs 17 and 18 of\nthe said judgment\nread thus:\n\n17. From a review of the foregoing provisions the position\nwith reference to the particular Society is as follows:\n\nThere is no absolute prohibition in the Act or in the Rules or in\nthe Bye-laws prohibiting transfer of interest of a member in the\n\nproperty belonging to the Society. The only transfer which is\nvoid under the Act is one made in contravention of Sub-section\n\n(2) of\nSection 47\n[see\nSection 47(3)\n]. We have not been able to\nfind any other provision anywhere to the same effect. In the\nscheme of the provisions a dichotomy is seen between share or\ninterest in the capital and interest in property of the Society.\n\nWhile\nSection 29(2)\nrefers to transfer of a member's share or\nhis interest in the capital or property of any society,\nSection 31\n\nin contrast speaks of \"the share or interest of a member in the\ncapital of a society\".\nThe Act\n, therefore, makes a clear\ndistinction between the share or interest in the capital and\n\nshare or interest in property of the Society. We have also\nnoticed that the Act does recognise interest in the immovable\nproperty of the Society as well [see\nSection 47(1)(b)\n]. We have\nseen the qualifications for membership. There is no reason to\nsuppose that if the qualifications under the Bye-laws are\nfulfilled an application\" for membership may be rejected. It is\nadmitted that the flat is owned by the Society and the\njudgment-debtor has a right or interest to occupy the same.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n9/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n18. This right or interest to occupy is a species of property. We\nhave to consider whether this right to the particular property is\n\nattachable and saleable in execution of the decree against the\njudgment-debtor. It is contended by Mr. Chatterjee, amicus\n\ncuriae, that\nSection 31\nof the Act completely bars attachment\nand sale of the said property in execution of the decree. We\nhave already pointed out the difference in language between\n\nSection 29\nand\nSection 31\nand also made reference to\nSection\n\n47(1)(b)\nin that connection. There is nothing in the language of\n\nSection 31\nto indicate that the right to occupation which is the\nright to be sold in auction is not attachable in execution of the\ndecree. There is nothing in\nSection 31\nto even remotely\n\ninclude a prohibition against attachment or sale of the\naforesaid right to occupation of the flat. Once\nSection 31\nis out\n\nof the way, we are left with\nSection 29\nwherein we do not find\neven a provision of prior consent for transfer of share or\ninterest in such property. The only restrictions under\nSection\n\n29(2)\nare that the member may not transfer his interest in the\nproperty prior to one year and the transfer is made to an\nexisting member of the Society or to a person whose\napplication for membership has been accepted by the Society.\nIt is true that bye-law 71D says that a member to whom a\n\ntenement is allotted shall not assign or underlet, vacate or part\n\nwith the possession of the tenement or any part thereof without\nthe previous consent in writing of the Managing Committee,\nbut there is nothing to show that contravention of this bye-law\nmakes the assignment void under the Act unlike in the case of\n\na transfer being void under\nSection 47(3)\n. There is no\nimpediment to ratification of the assignment by the Committee\nparticularly in view of the legal position arising out of the\nconjoint effect of\nSection 29\n, Rule 24 and bye-law 9.\nSection\nread with Rule 24 shows that there is no prohibition as such\n\nagainst transfer of a share to a member or even to a non-\nmember if he consents to be a member and makes an\napplication for membership by purchasing aye shares as\nprovided under bye-law 9. Reading the aforesaid provisions\nthere is no reason to think that there is any question of refusal\nof membership of the Society to a non-member if he is\nqualified otherwise and makes an appropriate application in\nwhich case the transfer of shares will be operative and thus the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n10/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nassignment of the right to occupation will hold good. Further it\nis significant that under\nSection 146(a)\nof the Act,\n\ncontravention of Sub-section (2) of\nSection 47\nis punishable\nunder\nSection 147\nof the Act. Contravention of any bye-law is,\n\nhowever, no offence. We, therefore, unhesitatingly come to the\nconclusion that this species of property, namely the right to\noccupy a flat of this type, assumes significant importance and\nacquires under the law a stamp of transferability in furtherance\n\nof the interest of commerce. We have seen no fetter under any\nof the legal provisions against such a conclusion. The\nattachment and the sale of the property in this case in\nexecution of the decree are valid under the law.\n\n10. Mr. Thacker learned senior counsel also placed reliance on the judgment of\n\nDelhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar And Ors. Vs., Lf. Governor of Delhi\nand another AIR 1983 Delhi 301 and in particular paragraph 17 to 21, 25 to 27 in\n\nsupport of the submission that even minority members of the society can challenge\nan arbitral award. Paragraphs 17 to 21 and 25 to 27 of the said judgment read\nthus :\n\n17. In the case of Co-operative Society, the liability of a\n\nmember may be limited or it may be unlimited. If there is a\nlimited liability, then the Society will use the words 'limited' or\nits equivalent as part of its name. It so happens that in the\ninstant case, the liability of the members is limited' as it uses\n\nthe word 'limited' as part of its name. All this is provided in\nvarious sections of the\nDelhi Co-operative Societies Act, 1972\n,\nEven when the liability is limited, any claim against the\nSociety can be recovered from the property of the Society as\nwell as from the members of the Society to the extent of their\n\nliability. This is so provided in\nS. 75\nof the Act Even if no\npersonal liability is involved, it is obvious that each member of\nthe Society has an interest in the Society and as each member\ncan have only one share, all the members share the interest\nequally. If the interests of the Society are adversely affected,\nthe value of the share of each member to that extent is\ndiminished. So, it cannot be denied that each member has an\ninterest in the Society. One of the items in the award is that a\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n11/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nsum of Rupees 22,45,742/- has to be paid to the\nAdministration. There is also another item to the effect that the\n\nSociety shall not contest the smooth acquisitions of its land\nand shall not appeal for enhancement of its compensation.\n\nThese two items are sufficient to show that the interest of the\nmembers is adversely affected to some extent, though it is\ndifficult to see the exact implications of the award.\n\n18. It appears that on this ground the members of the\nSociety can maintain objections if the Society itself does not\nfile the same.\n\n19. There is yet another reason to come to the conclusion that\nthe objection could be maintained. From an analysis of the\n\nfacts set out earlier in the judgment, it plainly appears that the\nManaging Committee was superseded on 9th July, 1971. The\napplication moved in this Court under S. 14 of the Arbitration\n\nAct was moved by Shri Bal Mokand Vig who was the ex-\n\nSecretary of the Society.\nS. 14 (2)\nof the Act provides that the\narbitrators or umpire may file the award at the request of the\nparties or under directions by the Court. Obviously, for the\n\npurpose of that application, a member of the Society was\ntreated as being competent to obtain an order from the Court to\n\ndirect the filing of the award. If we come to the conclusion that\nno objections could be filed, then it would also have to be held\nthat the award has been wrongly filed in the Court because it\nwas at the instance of a party not entitled to maintain the\n\napplication. We do not think that this is the correct view. The\nexact language used in\nS. 14 (2)\nis as follows:\n\n\" The arbitrators or umpire shall, at the request of any party\nto the arbitration agreement or any person claiming under\nsuch Party or if so directed by the Court cause the award or\n\na signed copy to be filed in the Court.\"\n\nThis shows that a person claiming under a party to the\narbitration agreement has also a right. If this right exists under\n\nS. 14 (2)\n, it would appear that that party can also move the\nCourt and consequently can also file the objections. All the\nmembers of the Society can be deemed to be persons claiming\nunder the Society and, therefore, they are entitled to get the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n12/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\naward filed in the Court and must also have the right to\nmaintain the objections, otherwise, there was no point in\n\ngiving the right to a person claiming under a party to move the\narbitrator or the Court, as seems to be implicit in the language\n\nof\nS. 14 (2)\n. For this reason also it seems the objections could\nbe maintained by the members.\n\n20. It is now necessary to turn to perhaps the most important\n\naspect of this case, which is regarding the rights of individual\nmembers of a Corporation to maintain a suit in the name of the\nCorporation or in the interest of the Corporation, since it is the\nanalogy of a Corporation that has been applied here to a Co-\n\noperative Society as well. This matter was considered by the\nFederal Court in Dr. Satya Charan Lal v. Rameshwar Prosad\n\nBajoria, . It was stated in that judgment that it was well-settled\nthat in order to redress a wrong done to a company or to\nrecover monies or damages alleged to be due to the company,\n\nthe action should be brought by the company itself. This was\nthe rule in Foss v. Harbottle, . It is unnecessary to refer to the\nother cases cited by the Federal Court. The law was\nsummarised in the following terms:-\n\n\" The correct position seems to us to be that ordinarily the\ndirectors of a company are the only persons who can\n\nconduct litigation in the name of the company, but when\nthey are themselves the wrong-doers against the company\nand have acted mala fide or beyond their powers, and their\npersonal interest is in conflict with their duty in such a way\n\nthat they cannot or will not take steps to seek redress for the\nwrong done to the company, the majority of the\nshareholders must in such a case be entitled to take steps to\nredress the wrong.\"\n\nThis view upheld the right to the majority of share-holders to\nmaintain an action in the name of the company. The law has\nbeen summarised in this behalf in Para No. 767 of Halsbury's\nLaws of England, Fourth Edition Vol. 7 as follows:\n\n\" In an action to redress a wrong done to a company or to\nrecover money or damages alleged to be due to it, the\ncompany is the only proper plaintiff, but its name should be\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n13/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nused as plaintiff by direction of the company or its\ndirectors. Where the members complaining represent the\n\nmajority of the company, the action may be brought in the\ncompany's name, ever though the directors object. The\n\ncourt may allow the matter to stand so that a company\nmeeting can be held to decide whether the action should\nproceed in the company's name. At such a meeting the votes\nof the persons complained of cannot be excluded.\n\nNevertheless, proceedings may be brought by any member\nor members in his or their own name or names where such\nauthority cannot be obtained and the act complained of is of\na fraudulent character or oppressive or is ultra vires the\n\ncompany, or criminal or where the wrongdoers control the\nmajority of votes; or where the result would otherwise be\n\nthat the company was carrying out by an ordinary\nresolution something which could only be properly carried\nout by a special resolution, or by any other resolution\n\nrequiring a prescribed majority.\"\n\nThus, the position as far as the latest Edition of Halsbury's\nLaws of England is concerned is that the action may be\nbrought without the directors consent by a majority of\n\nshareholders in the name of the company and in some cases\n\nwhere the majority does not support the litigation by the\nshareholders in their representatives capacity. In such a case,\nthe suit may be either by all the complaining members\naltogether or representatively by some of them. There is no\n\ncase in which the minority of shareholders cannot protect their\ninterest.\n\n21. Keeping this in view, it does not seem right to hold that the\nmembers of the Society who have filed objections cannot\n\nmaintain the objections. These objections have been filed in\nthe individual names of the members and now, they are\nsupported by the present management of the Society. No\nmeeting was called by the Court because it was not a case of\nobjections being filed in the name of the CO-operative Society.\n\n25. Applying the above principle to the case of the present\nobjector, on the footing that they are a minority set of\nshareholders in the Co-operative Society, it would appear that\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n14/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nsome remedy should be open to them in respect of the\nSociety's failure to object to the award. For the purpose of this\n\nanalysis, it must be assumed that there is something wrong\nwith the award, if this is so, it would be for the Society to\n\nchallenge the same in normal circumstances. If the persons in\ncharge of the management refuse to challenge the award, then\nit should be open to the minority shareholders to maintain a\nsuit in respect of the award. However.\nS. 32\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct states that no suit can lie on any ground whatsoever for a\ndecision upon the existence, effect or validity to arbitration\nagreement or award. So, these 143 members could not\nmaintain a suit, on the principles laid down by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Jawahar Lal Barman v. Union of India,\nMANU/SC/0005/1961 : AIR 1962 SC 378. This means that\n\nthey can only approach The Court under the\nArbitration Act\n.\nThis is, therefore, an additional ground on which the\nobjections could be heard by the Court.\n\n26. To summarise the conclusions, it may be useful to state the\nfollowing propositions:-\n\n(1) In the case of Corporations, where there are members, a\n\nsuit may be maintained by the Corporation acting through its\ndirectors. If the directors refuse to act or the action complained\n\nof is that of the directors themselves, then such a suit can be\nmaintained by the majority shareholders in the name of the\nCorporation.\n\n(2) If the action is challenged by the minority shareholders\nwhen the directors refuse to act, then the action or suit has to\nbe brought by the minority shareholders in their own name.\n\nThis may be done by them acting jointly or there may be a\nrepresentative suit by a class of shareholders or members.\n\n(3) In the case of an arbitration award which is filed in Court,\nthe objections may be filed by the parties thereto or if the\nparties refuse to file objections or fail to file objections, then a\nperson claiming under them can also file objections provided\nthey can show some interest in the subject-matter of the award\nor reference, as the case may be.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n15/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n(4) The principle which applies to appeals, namely, that third\nparties can also file objections, even though not parties to the\n\nsuit, applies also to objections against an award being made a\nrule of the Court subject to the same limitations, i.e., the\n\nobjectors must show that they have an interest in the subject-\nmatter of award or reference and they obtain leave of the Court\nwhich should normally not be refused.\n\n(5) In the case of arbitration awards against a Corporation\nwhich have been filed in the Court, members of the\nCorporation can maintain objections as they are debarred from\nfiling a suit because of\nS. 32\nof the Arbitration Act, to\n\nchallenge the award or the arbitration agreement, as the case\nmay be. These objections can be filed on the same basis as a\n\nsuit can be filed by majority or minority shareholders of a\ncompany, which means that if the majority shareholders object\nto the award they can do so in the name of the company and if\n\nthe minority shareholders challenge the same, they can do so\nin their own names,\n\n(6) In order to determine whether it is the majority or minority\nshareholders who are maintaining the objections, the Court can\n\neven call a meeting of the company.\n\n27. Applying these propositions to the circumstances of this\ncase, it clearly appears that the nominated management of the\nSociety was not willing to file objections to the award. The\naward was filed at the instance of one of the members of the\n\nCo-operative Society and not at the instance of the parties to\nthe reference. Against this award, objections could be filed by\nthe majority of the members in the name of the Co-operative\nSociety or by a minority in their own names. If the objectors\n\ncould establish an interest in the subject-matter of the award,\nthey were entitled to get the leave of the Court to maintain the\nobjections or they could be treated as persons claiming under a\nparty and, therefore, entitled to maintain objections.\nAlternatively, they could maintain these subjections on the\nprinciples on which minority shareholders could challenge the\ndecision of the majority. For all these reasons, we think the\nobjections in this case were maintainable and we could allow\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n16/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nthe present appeal.\n\n11. Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel in rejoinder invited my attention to the\n\njudgment of Madras High Court in case of Chennai Container Terminal Pvt.\nLtd.etc. Vs. Union of India and Ors. reported in AIR 2007 Madras 225 (DB) and\nsubmits that Division Bench of Madras High Court has considered the judgment of\n\nDelhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar and Ors. (supra) relied upon by\nMr.Thacker learned senior counsel and has also considered the provisions of\n\nSection 34\nread with\nsection 2(1)(h)\nof Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and\nhas distinguished the judgment of learned Delhi Court on the ground that the\n\nprovisions for impugning award under\nsection 30\nread with 33 of the\nArbitration\nAct, 1940\nwhich were considered by the Delhi High Court and\nsection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are totally different. It is submitted that the\nprinciples laid down by Madras High Court in which the court had considered the\nprovisions under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read\n\nwith\nsection 2(1)(h)\nwhich are squarely applicable to the facts of this case and\n\nshall be considered by this court and not the judgment of Delhi High Court.\nParagraph 9 to 11 of the said judgment of Madras High Court read thus :-\n\n9. However, in the case on hand the learned single Judge\nhas held that though\nSection 34\nof the Act contemplates\nchallenge of the award made by the party to the arbitration\nagreement, in view of\nSection 2(1)(h)\nof the Act, the import of\nthe word 'party' can be judiciously expanded, if the context so\n\nwarrants. Hence, the word 'party' may include not only the\nsignatory to the arbitration agreement, but also a party non-\n\nsignatory to the agreement. According to the learned single\nJudge, the contextual facts and circumstances warrant\nexpansion of the definition found under\nSection 2(1)(h)\nof the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 to include the\nGovernment of India, which is a party non-signatory for the\npurpose of challenging the award under\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n17/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nWe fail to appreciate the stand taken by UOI that it is a non-\nsignatory party to the agreement. Learned ASG was unable to\n\nshow as to how UOI can be said to be a party to the agreement\nin the face of express provision contained in the agreement,\n\nwhich defined party to include only \"ChPT & CCTPL\". The\nword 'Party' is defined in\nSection 2(1)(h)\nof the Act to mean a\n\"party to an arbitration agreement\" and therefore, ordinarily,\nthe expression 'Party' as used in\nSection 34\nof the Act must\n\ncarry the same meaning, namely, a party to the arbitration\nagreement or award. But, as the opening part of\nSection 2(1)\n\n(h) of the Act shows, the definitional meaning is subject to\nanything repugnant in the subject or context. We must,\n\ntherefore, see whether there is anything in\nSection 34\nor in the\ncontext in which it occurs which should compel us to place a\n\nbroader meaning different from the one given to it in\nSection\n2(1)(h)\n. In our opinion, there is nothing in the subject or\ncontext of\nSection 34\nwhich would suggest us to depart from\n\nthe definitional meaning of the expression 'party'. The\nexpression 'party' is used in\nSection 34(2)\nin its definitional\nsense to mean a party to the arbitration proceedings and does\nnot include a third person, who is not a party to the agreement.\nTo our mind the interpretation suggested by the learned ASG\n\nwould make the Act totally unworkable. It is well settled that\n\nan award is final and binding only on the parties and can be\nenforced only against the party to the award. A third party\nwould therefore be in a position to challenge the award, but\nnot be bound by it, if the challenge fails. Equally, a third party\n\ncan render the limitation period envisaged under the Act otiose\nby merely claiming knowledge of the award long after the\nperiod of limitation has expired.\n\n10. Learned ASG, however, submitted that UOI is an\n\naggrieved party inasmuch as the arbitrator has totally\nmisconstrued the guidelines of UOI and therefore, the UOI can\nchallenge the award of the arbitrator. In support of his\nsubmission, learned ASG placed reliance on the Division\nBench judgment of the Delhi High Court in Sohan Nayyar v.\nLt. Governor, Delhi MANU/DE/0483/1982 : AIR 1983 Delhi\n\n301. The said decision is under the old\nArbitration Act\nof 1940\nand the Bench clearly found that the provisions of the Act of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n18/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n1940 do not specify as to which can make an application, and\ntherefore held that as the Act does not prohibit filing of an\n\nobjection by a third parties, there is no bar to some one else\nfiling objections provided they have some interest in the\n\nsubject matter of the litigation. As observed by the Supreme\nCourt in\nSundaram Finance Limited v. NEPC Limited\n, the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nis based on\nUNCITRAL Model. It is entirely different from the\nArbitration\n\nAct, 1940\n. The provisions of this Act must, therefore, be\ninterpreted and construed independently and in fact reference\nto 1940 Act may actually lead to misconstruction. In order to\nget help in construing these provisions it is more relevant to\n\nrefer to the UNCITRAL Model Law rather than the 1940 Act.\n\n11. Learned ASG, relying upon the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in ITI Ltd v. Siemens Public Communications Network\nLtd. MANU/SC/0502/2002 : [2002]3SCR1122 submitted that\n\nthe provisions\nof CPC\nwould apply to the proceedings under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act and an aggrieved party for the purpose of\nchallenging the award can invoke\nSection 34\nof the Act. The\ncontention is required to be stated only for rejection. In ITI\n\nLtd. Case the Court held that merely because second appeal is\nbarred under Sub-section (3) of\nSection 37\n, remedy of revision\n\nwould not cease to be available. Although revision is not\nspecifically provided for by the Act but in the absence of any\nexpress exclusion\nof CPC\n, no inference can be drawn that\n\nprovisions\nof CPC\nwould not apply to proceedings arising\nunder the Act and revision is not maintainable. This decision\nhas no application to the case on hand.\nSection 34\nof the Act\nread with the definition of 'party' in\nSection 2(1)(h)\nof the Act\nmakes it amply clear that only a party to the arbitration\n\nagreement can invoke the provisions of\nSection 34\nof the Act.\nA third party has no locus standi to challenge the award under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\nREASONS AND CONCLUSION\n\n12.\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides for an\napplication for setting aside arbitral award.\nSection 34(2)\nprovides for the grounds\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n19/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nof challenge of an arbitral award on which such award may be set aside by the\n\ncourt. The said provision also provides that an arbitral award may be set aside if\nthe party making application furnishes any of the proof that is specifically setout in\n\nsection 34(2) (a) (i)\nto (v). Under\nsection 2(1) (h)\nparty is defined as 'party' means\na party to an arbitration agreement.\n\n13. A perusal of the record clearly indicates that none of the members of the\nsociety were parties to the development agreement entered into between the\n\nrespondent no.1 and the society. It is however the case of the petitioners that since\nthe society did not challenge the impugned award and the said award has affected\n\nthe rights of the petitioners in respect of their respective flats in the society,\npetitioners who are claiming through the society are also thus parties to the\n\narbitration agreement and being parties aggrieved are entitled to challenge the\nimpugned award though the society has not impugned the said arbitral award.\n\n14. A perusal of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nin toto shows that the\n\nterm party has been used in almost every section of the said Act. Under\nsection 7\n\nof the said Act the parties by an agreement can submit to arbitration all or certain\n\ndisputes which have arisen or may arise between them in respect of a defined legal\nrelationship whether contractual or not. It is provided that an arbitration agreement\nshall be in writing.\nSection 7(4)\nof the Act provides as to when an arbitration\nagreement can be construed as in writing if it is contained in various documents\n\nand pleadings.\n\n15.\nSection 8\nprovides that a party to an arbitration agreement can file an\napplication before a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter\nwhich is the subject of an arbitration agreement, to refer parties to arbitration.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n20/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nSection 9\nof the Act provides for interim measures which can be applied by a party.\n\nSection 10\nprovides for composition of arbitral tribunal which can be determined\nby the parties to the arbitration agreement.\nSection 11\nof the Act provides for\n\nappointment of arbitrators in the mode and manner prescribed therein and\nprescribes for an application to be made by a party to the arbitration agreement for\nappointment of arbitrators before the Chief Justice or any person or institution\n\ndesignated by him.\n\n16.\nSections 12\nand\nof the Act provides for grounds for challenge which\nchallenge can be made only by the parties to the arbitration agreement. Under\n\nsection 14\nof the Act, the parties to the arbitration agreement can apply to the court\nto decide on the termination of the mandate if a controversy remains concerning\n\nany of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-\nsection 1\nof\nsection 14\n.\nSection\nof the Act provides for termination of mandate and for making an application by\nthe parties to the arbitration for substitution of arbitrator.\nSection 17\nof the Act\n\npermits parties to the arbitration agreement to apply for interim measures before\n\nthe arbitral tribunal.\nSection 18\nof the Act provides that the parties shall be treated\nwith equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present his case.\n\n17.\nSection 19\nprovides for determination of rules of procedure and further\nprovides that subject to the said part, the parties are free to agree on the procedure\nto be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings.\nSection 20\n\nprovides for an agreement between the parties to the arbitration agreement to agree\non the place of arbitration.\nSection 21\nprovides as to when the arbitral proceedings\ncommences unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\nSection 22\nto\nof the Act\nprovides for the mode and manner of conducting arbitration proceedings by the\nparties before the arbitral tribunal and consequence of a default of a party.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n21/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n18.\nSection 28\nof the Act provides that what rules shall be applicable to\n\nsubstance of dispute. The arbitral tribunal has to decide in accordance with the\nterms of the contract entered into between the parties. Under\nsection 31\n, the\n\narbitral tribunal has to render reasons in the arbitral award unless the parties have\nagreed that no reasons are to be given. It provides that a signed copy of the arbitral\naward has to be delivered or shall be delivered to each party. The arbitral tribunal\n\nis empowered to grant interest unless the parties have otherwise agreed that interest\nnot to be awarded by the arbitral tribunal. Under\nsection 32\nof the Act the arbitral\n\nproceedings are terminated if the parties agree on the termination of the\nproceedings. Under\nsection 33\n, a party may apply for correction, interpretation and\n\nfor additional award. Under\nsection 34\nof the Act, a party can challenge an arbitral\naward on the grounds setout therein.\n\n19. A perusal of the aforesaid provisions of the Act and the scheme makes it\nclear that only the parties to the arbitration agreement can exercise various rights\n\nand invoke the mechanism of adjudication of disputes by arbitration by referring\n\ntheir disputes to arbitration for adjudication and not by an outsider. The only\nexception carved out under the Act is under\nsections 40\nand\ni.e. in case of the\n\ndeath of a party to the arbitration agreement which can be enforceable by or\nagainst the legal representative of the deceased and in case of insolvency, if such\ninsolvant was party to arbitration agreement and if official assignee or receiver\nadopts such contract.\n\n20. In my view the arbitral tribunal is a private forum and gets jurisdiction to\nadjudicate upon the disputes between the parties to the arbitration agreement and\nnot the persons who are not parties to the arbitration agreement. Proceedings under\n\nsection 34\nof the Act are not by way of an appeal. There is no other provision\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n22/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nunder the Act for challenge of an arbitral award except what is provided under\n\nsection 34\nof the Act. In my view only a party to the arbitration agreement which\nis defined under\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Act can challenge an arbitral award under\n\nsection 34\nof the Act and not by a person who is not a party to the arbitration\nagreement unless covered by\nsections 40\nand\nof the Act. However if a person\nis wrongly impleaded as party to the arbitration proceedings and is aggrieved by\n\narbitral award, he can invoke\nsection 34\nof the Act.\n\n21. Division Bench of this court in case of\nGirish Mulchand Mehta and\nanother\n(supra) has held that a member of the society speaks through the society\n\nand has no independent right qua the society. Society is entitled to represent as the\ncorporate aggregate.\n\nDivision bench of this court has considered the judgment of\n\nSupreme Court in case of\nRamesh Himmatlal Shah\n(supra) which is relied upon\nby Mr.Thacker, learned senior counsel for the petitioners and held that the\nmembers of the society not having challenged the resolution passed by the society\n\nand such resolution not having been set side by the appropriate forum are binding\n\non all the members.\n\n22. Supreme court in case of\nFirm Ashok Traders vs. Gurmukhdas Saluja and\nothers\nAIR 2004 SC 1433 while construing\nsection 9\nof the Act held that a person\nnot a party to an arbitration agreement cannot enter the court for protection under\n\nsection 9\nof the Act. A party to an arbitration agreement can invoke the said\n\njurisdiction for securing relief which the court has power to grant before, during or\nafter arbitral proceeding by virtue of\nsection 9\n. The court is competent to grant\nsuch relief to a party under clauses (i) and (ii) of\nsection 9\n. In my view the\nprinciples\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court while interpreting\nsection 9\nof the Act\nwhich provides for a remedy of interim measures available only to a party to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n23/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\narbitration agreement are applicable also to the proceedings under\nsection 34\nof the\n\nAct for setting aside an award only by a party to an arbitration agreement subject to\n\nsections 40\nand\nof the Act and by a person wrongly impleaded as party to\n\narbitration proceedings and is aggrieved by such arbitral award.\n\n23. Supreme court in case of The state of\nMaharashtra & Ors. vs. Ark Builders\n\nPvt. Ltd.\nAIR 2011 SC 1374 while interpreting\nsection 31 (5)\nof the Act has held\nthat copy of an arbitral award has to be delivered to the party by the arbitral\n\ntribunal and the limitation for making an application for correction or interpretation\nof award under\nsection 33(1)\nand for making an application for setting aside an\n\naward under\nsection 34(3)\ncommences from the date of delivery of such arbitral\naward by the arbitral tribunal to a party to the arbitration agreement. Paragraph 12\n\nof\nthe said judgment\nreads thus:-\n\n12. We are supported in our view by the decision of this Court\n\nin\nUnion of India v. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors\nMANU/SC/0214/2005\n: (2005) 4 SCC 239; in paragraph 8 of\n\nthe decision it was held and observed as follows:\n\n8. The delivery of an arbitral award under Sub-section (5)\nof\nSection 31\nis not a matter of mere formality. It is a matter\nof substance. It is only after the stage under\nSection 31\nhas\n\npassed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings\nwithin the meaning of\nSection 32\nof the Act arises. The\ndelivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to\nbe \"received\" by the party. This delivery by the Arbitral\nTribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in\n\nmotion several periods of limitation such as an\napplication for correction and interpretation of an award\nwithin 30 days under\nSection 33(1)\n, an application for\nmaking an additional award under\nSection 33(4)\nand an\napplication for setting aside an award under\nSection\n34(3)\nand so on. As this delivery of the copy of award has\nthe effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also\nbringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n24/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nexpiry of the prescribed period of limitation which would\nbe calculated from that date, the delivery of the copy of\n\naward by the Tribunal and the receipt thereof by each party\nconstitutes an important stage in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n24. Supreme Court in case of\nBenarsi Krishna Committee & Ors. vs. Karmyogi\n\nShelters Pvt. Ltd.\n(2012) 9 SCC 496 has held that copy of the award has to be\ndelivered to the party as defined in\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Act which clearly\nindicates that such a person shall be a party to the arbitration agreement. A copy of\n\nthe award can be served only on the party himself and not his or her agent or\n\nadvocate. Paragraph 15 of\nthe said judgment\nof the Supreme Court read thus :-\n\n15. Having taken note of the submissions advanced on behalf\n\nof the respective parties and having particular regard to the\nexpression \"party\" as defined in\nSection 2(h)\nof the 1996 Act\nread with the provisions of\nSections 31(5)\nand\n34(3)\nof the\n1996 Act, we are not inclined to interfere with the decision of\n\nthe Division Bench of the Delhi High Court impugned in these\nproceedings. The expression \"party\" has been amply dealt with\n\nin\nTecco Trechy Engineer\n's case (supra) and also in\nARK\nBuilders Pvt. Ltd.\n's case (supra), referred to hereinabove. It is\none thing for an Advocate to act and plead on behalf of a party\nin a proceeding and it is another for an Advocate to act as the\n\nparty himself. The expression \"party\", as defined in\nSection\n2(h)\nof the 1996 Act, clearly indicates a person who is a party\nto an arbitration agreement. The said definition is not qualified\nin any way so as to include the agent of the party to such\n\nagreement. Any reference, therefore, made in\nSection 31(5)\n\nand\nSection 34(2)\nof the 1996 Act can only mean the party\nhimself and not his or her agent, or Advocate empowered to\nact on the basis of a Vakalatnama. In such circumstances,\nproper compliance with\nSection 31(5)\nwould mean delivery of\na signed copy of the Arbitral Award on the party himself and\nnot on his Advocate, which gives the party concerned the right\nto proceed Under\nSection 34(3)\nof the aforesaid Act.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n25/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\n25.

An\narbitrator can be appointed under the said Act at the instance of a party to an\n\narbitration agreement only in respect of the disputes with another party to the\narbitration agreement. If there is a dispute between a party to an arbitration\n\nagreement with other parties to the arbitration agreement as also non-parties to the\narbitration agreement, reference to arbitration or appointment of arbitrator can be\n\nonly with respect to the parties to the arbitration agreement and not the non-parties.\nIt is held that since there was no arbitration agreement between the parties, the\n\nimpleadment of the person not party to arbitration agreement as a respondent in the\narbitration proceedings and the award against such person in such arbitration can\nnot be sustained. Paragraphs 5, 7 and 19 of\nthe said judgment\nread thus :-\n\n5. The High Court of Delhi by two orders dated 23.5.2000\nappointed a retired Judge of the High Court as the sole\narbitrator. The arbitrations ended in two awards dated\n1.5.2002. The first award directed respondents 2 and 3 and\n\nappellant to pay Rs. 93,23,288/- (that is Rs. 50 lakhs with\ninterest at 20; up to the date of the appointment of arbitrator)\nwith interest at 18% per annum from 24.5.2000. Similarly the\nsecond award directed respondents 2 and 3 and appellant to\npay Rs. 46,49,315/- (that is Rs. 25 lakhs with interest at 20%\n\nupto the date of appointment of arbitrator) with interest at 18%\nper annum from 24.5.2000. The two arbitration awards were\nchallenged by the appellant by filing applications under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act (OMP No. 319/2002 and 322/2002). The\nsecond and third respondents also challenged the awards in\nOMP No. 320/2002 and 321/2002.

Sub-section (1) of\nSection 7\n\ndefines an arbitration agreement as an agreement by the parties\nto submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have\narisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined\nlegal relationship, whether contractual or not. Sub-section (2)\n\nprovides that an arbitration agreement may be in the form of\nan arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate\n\nagreement. Sub-section (3) requires an arbitration agreement to\nbe in writing. Sub-section (4) explains as to when an\narbitration agreement could be said to be in writing, that is: (a)\n\na document signed by the parties; (b) an exchange of letters,\ntelex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which\nprovide a record of the arbitration agreement; or (c) an\nexchange of statements of claim and defence in which the\n\nexistence of the arbitration agreement is alleged by one party\nand not denied by the other. Sub-section (5) provides that the\n\nreference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration\nclause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in\nwriting and the reference is such as to make that arbitration\nclause a part of the contract. Thus there can be reference to\n\narbitration only if there is an arbitration agreement between the\nparties.\nThe Act\nmakes it clear that an Arbitrator can be\nappointed under the Act at the instance of a party to an\narbitration agreement only in respect of disputes with another\nparty to the arbitration agreement. If there is a dispute between\n\na party to an arbitration agreement, with other parties to the\narbitration agreement as also non-parties to the arbitration\nagreement, reference to arbitration or appointment of arbitrator\ncan be only with respect to the parties to the arbitration\nagreement and not the non-parties.\n\n19. As there was no arbitration agreement between the parties\n(the first respondent and appellant), the impleading of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n27/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nappellant as a respondent in the arbitration proceedings and the\naward against the appellant in such arbitration cannot be\n\nsustained. As a consequence, both the arbitration awards, as\nagainst the appellant are liable to be set aside. If the first\n\nrespondent wants to enforce the alleged guarantee of the\nappellant, it is open to the first respondent to do so in\naccordance with law.\n\n26. In my view since the petitioners herein could not have been impleaded as\nparties to the arbitration proceedings before the learned arbitrator for want of\narbitration agreement between the petitioners and the respondent no.1, nor the\n\npetitioners were parties to the arbitration proceedings, petitioners have no locus to\n\nfile petition under\nsection 34\nof the Act for setting aside such an arbitral award.\n\n27. This court in case of Supreme Megha Constructions LLP Vs.Symphony\n\nCo-operative Housing Society Limited and Mr.Ajay Wadhwa applicant in Notice\nof Motion (L) No.2410 of 2014 in Suit (L) No. 867 of 2014, delivered on 29 th\nOctober 2014 has held that since the applicant in the notice of motion who was\n\nmember of the society was not party to the arbitration agreement cannot file an\n\napplication under\nsection 8\nof the said Act for referring the parties to the suit to\narbitration. This court has considered\nsection 8\nread with the definition of party\n\nunder\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the said Act and has held that society was party to the\narbitration agreement and not the applicant member and thus application under\n\nsection 8\nwould not be maintainable at the instance of such member who was not\nparty to the arbitration agreement. Paragraphs 23 and 24 of\nthe said judgment\nread\n\nthus :-\n\n23. Perusal of the record indicates that except the plaintiff\nand the defendant no.1 society, none of the parties to this\nproceedings are party to development agreement. In my view\nsince applicant and other defendants except the society are not\nparties to the arbitration agreement, even if application under\n\nsection 8\nwould have been filed by the applicant to this Notice\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n28/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nof Motion or other defendants except the society, same would\nnot have been maintainable. Application under\nsection 8\ncan\n\nbe filed only by a party to the arbitration agreement.\nSection 8\n\nhas to be read with\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996.\n\n24. This court in case of\nVardhaman Developers Ltd. vs.\nAndheri Krupa Prasad Co-op.Hsg.Soc.Ltd\n. & Ors. in Notice\n\nof Motion (L) No. 248 of 2014 in Suit No.94 of 2014 in a\njudgment rendered on 20th February, 2014 has taken a view\nthat the member of the society who was not party to the\narbitration agreement cannot mention an application under\n\nsection 8\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. I am\ntherefore of the view that even such application under\nsection\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act if would have been\nfiled by a member claiming through the society which society\nis party to the arbitration agreement, such application would\n\nnot be maintainable.\n\n28. In my view the principles\nlaid down by\nthis court in\nthe said judgment\nin the\ncase of Supreme Megha Constructions LLP (supra) would be applicable to the\n\napplication made by the petitioners under\nsection 34\nof the said Act. I am therefore\n\nof the view that this petition is not maintainable at the instance of the petitioners.\n\n29. In so far as judgment of Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar and\n\nothers (supra) relied upon by Mr.Thacker, learned senior counsel is concerned, a\nperusal of the said judgment clearly indicates that the said judgment was delivered\nin the proceedings governed by the provisions of\nArbitration Act\n1940.\nIn case of\n\nChennai Container Terminal Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra) Division Bench of Madras High\ncourt has dealt with the proceedings under the provisions of the\nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n. Question of law considered by the Madras High Court was\nwhether the applicant who was neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor to\nthe arbitration proceedings could file an application under\nsection 34\nof the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n29/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act for setting aside the arbitral award. The Madras\n\nHigh Court has held that there is nothing in the subject or context of\nsection 34\n\nwhich would suggest the court to depart from the definitional meaning of the\n\nexpression 'party' . It is held that the expression party is used in\nsection 34 (2)\nin\nits definitional sense to mean a party to the arbitration proceedings and does not\ninclude a third person who is not party to the agreement.\n\n30. It is held that a third party can render the limitation period envisaged under\n\nthe Act otiose by merely claiming knowledge of the award long after the period of\nlimitation as expired. The Madras High Court in\nthe said judgment\nhas\n\ndistinguished the judgment of Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar (supra)\nby holding that the Delhi high Court had found that the provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act\n1940 did not specify as to who can make an application and\ntherefore held that as the said\nArbitration Act\n1940 did not prohibit filing of an\nobjection by a third party, there was no bar to someone else filing objections\n\nprovided they had some interest in the subject matter of the litigation. The Madras\n\nHigh Court adverted to the judgment of Supreme Court in case of M/s.Sundaram\nFinance Limited vs. M/s.NEPC Limited 1999(2) SCC 499 holding that the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n1996 is based on UNCITRAL Model and is\nentirely different from the\nArbitration Act\n1940. The Supreme Court has held in\nthe said judgment that the provisions of\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\nmust therefore be interpreted and construed independently and in fact reference to\n\n1940 Act may actually lead to misconstruction.\n\n31. A perusal of\nsection 30\nread with\nsection 33\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940\nmakes it clear that an application to challenge the existence or validity of an\narbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of either determined could\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n30/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nbe applied to the court by any party to the arbitration agreement or any person\n\nclaiming under him. A perusal of the said Act makes it clear that the expression\n'party to an arbitration agreement' has not been defined under the said\nArbitration\n\nAct\n1940. A perusal of the provisions of\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nand in particular\nsection 34(2)\nmakes it clear that an application for setting aside an\naward can be made only by the party which is defined under\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the\n\nsaid Act or by the party to the arbitration proceedings.\n\n32. A perusal of\nsection 34\nof the Act makes it clear that the said application has\n\nto be filed within the time prescribed under\nsection 34(3)\nof the said Act. The time\n\nto file such application commences from the date of such party receiving copy of\nthe arbitral award from the learned arbitrator. Under\nsection 31(5)\nof the Act the\n\narbitral tribunal has to deliver a copy of the award to each party. It is thus clear\nthat a party to the arbitration agreement who may be a party to the arbitration\nproceedings and/or all the parties to the arbitration proceedings only would be\n\nentitled to be furnished with a copy of the arbitral award by the learned arbitrator\n\nunder\nsection 31(5)\nof the Act and upon delivery of copy of award from the\narbitrator it which would commence the period of limitation for the purpose of\nfiling an application under\nsection 34\nand can be filed within the time prescribed\n\ntherein. If the arguments of the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners\nare accepted that the petitioners though were not parties to the arbitration\nagreement nor were parties to the arbitration proceedings can file an application for\n\nsetting aside an award, there would be no limitation for filing an application for\nsetting aside an arbitral award at the instance of such an outsider.\n\n33. In my view the grounds of challenge which are available under\nsection 34\nof\nthe Act and various other provisions which are applicable to the parties who are\ndefined under\nsection 2(1) (h)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot\n\n::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\nKvm\n\n31/31\n\nARBP515.13\n\nbe exercised by an outsider or by a person who is not a party to the arbitration\n\nagreement or the arbitration proceedings. In my view the petitioners who are\nmembers of the society which society was party to the arbitration agreement not\n\nhaving filed application for setting aside the impugned award cannot step into the\nshoes of the society and cannot be granted any leave to challenge the arbitral\naward. In my view there is no provision under the\nArbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996\nfor granting any such leave as prayed by the petitioners to file an\napplication under\nsection 34\nfor setting aside the arbitral award.\n\n34. In my view the petition filed by the petitioners who are neither parties to the\n\narbitration agreement nor parties to the arbitration proceedings can not maintain\nthis petition.\n\n35. I therefore pass the following order :-\n\n(a) Arbitration Petition is dismissed as not maintainable.\n\n(b) No order as to costs.\n\n[R.D.
