JUSTICE SAMEER JAIN\nJudgment\nReserved On :: 05/03/2025\n\nPronounced on :: 25/04/2025\n\nREPORTABLE :\n\n\"I wish I had been more disabled -- then perhaps the system\n\nwould have seen me.\"\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (2 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nThese words reflect not a wish for greater suffering, but\n\na bitter irony -- that in the rigid, checkbox-driven machinery of\n\nthe State's welfare framework, a person's lived experience of\n\ndisability may fall through the cracks. In a system meant to uplift\n\nthe disadvantaged, the petitioner stands at a paradox: disabled,\n\nyet not disabled enough to be seen.\n\n1. Considering the interwoven and identical set of facts\n\nand legal issues framed and put-forth the present petitions were\n\ntagged and are henceforth adjudicated vide this common\n\njudgment, with consent of the counsel representing the parties, in\n\nboth the petitions.\n\n2. Before proceeding to examine the present petitions on\n\ntheir merits, it is imperative to first delineate the foundational\n\nfacts and the core issues arising therein. A precise appreciation of\n\nthe factual matrix and procedural background is essential to\n\ncontextualize the grievances of the petitioners and the legal\n\nquestions that fall for adjudication. The salient aspects of the\n\npetitions are, therefore, summarized as under:\n\nIn SBCWP No. 4343/2001 :-\n\n3. The petitioner appeared in the Rajasthan Administrative\n\nServices Examination, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as 'RAS'\n\nExamination) and secured an overall merit rank of 360. However,\n\nduring the course of the post-examination formalities, the\n\npetitioner was subjected to a medical examination by the\n\ncompetent Medical Board. Upon assessment, the petitioner was\n\ndeclared medically unfit for appointment to the Rajasthan\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (3 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nAdministrative Service and its allied services on account of a visual\n\nimpairment diagnosed as Congenital Nystagmus (CN).\n\n4. Congenital Nystagmus is an ocular motor disorder of\n\nuncertain etiology, typically manifesting at birth or in early infancy.\n\nIt is clinically characterized by involuntary, rhythmic oscillations of\n\nthe eyes, which may affect visual acuity and ocular stability.\n\nDespite the said diagnosis, the petitioner's visual impairment, as\n\nassessed, was less than 20%, thereby falling below the minimum\n\nthreshold required to qualify as a benchmark disability under\n\napplicable norms.\n\n5. Specifically, in accordance with the criteria laid down in\n\nthe relevant notification issued by the Union Public Service\n\nCommission (UPSC) for the Civil Services Examination (CSE), the\n\npetitioner was classified under Category 0, with corrected visual\n\nacuity in the better eye recorded between 6/9 to 6/18, and in the\n\nworse eye between 6/24 to 6/36. As such, the petitioner was not\n\nconsidered eligible either under the general category (due to\n\nmedical unfitness) or under the reserved category for persons with\n\nbenchmark disabilities (due to non-qualification of the 40%\n\ndisability threshold).\n\n6. During the pendency and adjudication of the present\n\nwrit petition, this Court, by way of an interim order dated\n\n03.09.2001, had granted protective relief in favor of the petitioner.\n\nVide the said interim direction, it was ordered that one seat in the\n\nRajasthan Co-operative Subordinate Service -- Inspector Grade II\n\nbe kept reserved and vacant for the petitioner, subject to the final\n\noutcome of the writ proceedings.\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (4 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nIn SBCWP No. 3500/2006 :-\n\n7. The petitioner, pursuant to his candidature in the\n\nRajasthan Administrative Services Examination, 2003, secured an\n\noverall merit position at Rank 21. Notwithstanding such\n\ncommendable performance, the petitioner was appointed to the\n\nRajasthan Accounts Service instead of the Rajasthan\n\nAdministrative Service (RAS), albeit the fact that both services are\n\ncategorically classified as non-technical in nature under the\n\nprevailing Medical Examination Instructions issued by the\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan in the year 1975.\n\n8. Pursuant to the declaration of results and in accordance\n\nwith the post-examination protocol, the petitioner was subjected\n\nto a medical examination on 14.11.2005. The Medical Board, upon\n\nevaluation, declared the petitioner unfit for appointment to the\n\nRAS cadre on account of his pre-existing condition of Congenital\n\nNystagmus (CN). Aggrieved by this determination, the petitioner\n\nsubmitted a formal representation seeking reconsideration of the\n\nmedical opinion. In response, the petitioner was re-examined by\n\nthe Medical Board on 02.01.2006. However, the subsequent\n\nmedical opinion merely reiterated the prior conclusion of unfitness\n\nwithout furnishing any cogent reasons or objective justification for\n\nthe adverse finding.\n\n9. It is pertinent to highlight that notwithstanding the\n\npetitioner's superior merit position at Rank 21, the respondents\n\nproceeded to appoint the next candidate in order of merit, one Ms.\n\nPrabha Gautam, who secured Rank 22, to the Rajasthan\n\nAdministrative Service cadre. In contrast, the petitioner was\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (5 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nappointed to the Rajasthan Accounts Service. It is a matter of\n\nrecord that the petitioner has, since his appointment, continuously\n\nserved in the Rajasthan Accounts Service for a period of\n\napproximately two decades and has discharged his official duties\n\nwith utmost diligence, integrity, and to the unqualified satisfaction\n\nof his superior officers.\n\nSUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE\n\nPETITIONER :-\n\n10. At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner had consistently demonstrated\n\nacademic excellence and commitment to public service throughout\n\nhis educational and professional career. In the year 1989, the\n\npetitioner qualified the Senior Secondary Examination with\n\n71.60% marks from the Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan,\n\nAjmer. Thereafter, in 1993, he completed his graduation from\n\nRajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner, securing 71.60% marks\n\nand attaining the third position in the University merit list. The\n\npetitioner further qualified the National Eligibility Test (NET) in his\n\nfirst attempt in 1995 and subsequently completed his M.Sc. in\n\nAgriculture (Agronomy) in 1996 from the RAU University, Bikaner\n\nwith distinction, being awarded a gold medal for his academic\n\nperformance. Demonstrating his continued dedication to academic\n\npursuits, the petitioner re-qualified the NET examination in the\n\nyears 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he appeared in the Rajasthan\n\nAdministrative Services (RAS/RTS) Examination and successfully\n\ncleared all stages, securing the 360th rank in the final merit.\n\nSubsequently, in the RAS Examination conducted in 2003, the\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (6 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\npetitioner improved his performance significantly and secured an\n\noverall rank of 21, reflecting his consistent and meritorious\n\nacademic and competitive examination record.\n\n11. It was further submitted that the petitioner despite\n\nbeing a meritorious candidate, is repeatedly subjected to arbitrary\n\nand discriminatory treatment by the respondent authorities,\n\nresulting in denial of rightful appointment in the Rajasthan\n\nAdministrative Service (RAS), despite his better performance and\n\nranking in the merit list. Thence, the petitioner seeks appropriate\n\nrelief for the infringement of his fundamental and legal rights. It\n\nwas then apprised to the Court that on 05.07.2001, the petitioner\n\nwas declared medically unfit for appointment to the RAS on\n\naccount of the pre-existing condition termed Congenital\n\nNystagmus. Nonetheless, the said declaration was made without\n\naffording the petitioner any meaningful opportunity of clarification\n\nor recourse. Thereafter, on 31.07.2001, upon the petitioner's\n\nrequest, a re-medical examination was conducted by the duly\n\nconstituted Medical Board. However, the petitioner was again\n\ndeclared medically unfit. In this regard, it was submitted that the\n\nsaid medical report was not supplied to him despite repeated\n\nrequests, thereby denying him access to a vital document\n\naffecting his career and right to employment.\n\n12. Consequentially, the petitioner was constrained to\n\napproach this Court and had filed SB Civil Writ Petition No.\n\n4343/2001 (Dr. Deva Ram Shivram v. State of Rajasthan & Ors.),\n\nwherein the petitioner challenged the denial of appointment solely\n\non the basis of medical unfitness sans taking note of the merit\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (7 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nscored by the petitioner, which he contended to be arbitrary,\n\nwithout justification, and in violation of the principles of natural\n\njustice.\n\n13. It was averred that in the year 2003, the Rajasthan\n\nPublic Service Commission (RPSC) issued a fresh advertisement\n\nfor the RAS/RTS Examination, 2003 for filling various posts in the\n\nState and sub-ordinate services. The petitioner, determined to\n\nserve the State, once again participated in the said competitive\n\nexamination. The petitioner cleared all the stages of the\n\nexamination with distinction and secured an overall 21 st rank in\n\nthe general merit category. It is crucial to note that the petitioner\n\ndid not avail of any benefit of reservation under the physically\n\nhandicapped category, as he did not possess a disability certificate\n\nqualifying him for such classification. Further, vide communication\n\ndated 05.07.2003, the office of the Commissioner (Disabilities)\n\ninformed the petitioner that he had less than 20% disability and\n\nhence was ineligible to be issued a disability certificate for availing\n\nbenefits under the physically handicapped category. The said\n\ncommunication is on record as Annexure-8.\n\n14. Thereafter, the petitioner was once again called for a\n\nmedical examination on 14.11.2005. However, to the petitioner's\n\ngrave prejudice, he was yet again declared medically unfit on\n\naccount of defective vision, without any substantial deviation in\n\nthe medical opinion or a detailed consideration of the nature of the\n\nduties to be performed under the RAS cadre. Being aggrieved, the\n\npetitioner submitted a detailed representation dated 10.12.2005\n\nbefore the then Hon'ble Chief Minister and other competent\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (8 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nauthorities seeking review of the adverse medical opinion and\n\nconsideration for service allocation (Annexure-10 in SBCWP\n\nNo.3500/2006). In response, a Medical Board was re-constituted\n\nand the petitioner underwent a subsequent medical examination\n\non 02.01.2006. However, the outcome of this exercise was once\n\nagain unfavorable and remained consistent with the previous\n\nopinion, without providing the petitioner any benefit of doubt or\n\nreasonable accommodation.\n\n15. It was sequentially argued that on 21.04.2006, a\n\ncandidate namely Ms. Prabha Gautam, who stood 22 nd i.e. next in\n\nthe merit list and a rank lower to the petitioner, was appointed to\n\nthe RAS cadre service along with other candidates, while the\n\npetitioner stood excluded without being provided any valid or\n\nreasoned justification. It was further submitted that on the very\n\nnext day, i.e. on 22.04.2006, the Government, invoking its powers\n\nof discretion and purported excellence, appointed the petitioner\n\nnot to the RAS cadre service, but to the Rajasthan Accounts\n\nService, despite the fact that both the services were classified\n\nunder the \"non-technical category\" under the relevant recruitment\n\nguidelines framed and issued by the Government of Rajasthan,\n\nDepartment of Personnel (Group II) in the year 1975\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'guidelines of 1975'). Therefore, it\n\ncan be deduced that this act of appointing the petitioner to a\n\nservice other than the one earned on merit, and lower in\n\npreference, without any objective rationale, is arbitrary,\n\nunjustified, and violative of the fundamental rights of the\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (9 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\npetitioner as enshrined under the provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n16. It was also apprised to the Court that as per the\n\nInstructions for Medical Examination dated 01.01.1975 bearing\n\nNo. F.15(1)DOP/A-II/74-I while holding that a candidate is not fit\n\naccording to the norms laid down in those guidelines i.e.\n\nGuidelines of 1975, it would be permissible for a Medical Board to\n\nrecommend to Government of Rajasthan for reasons specifically\n\nrecorded in writing that the candidate in question may be\n\nadmitted to the service without any disadvantage to the State\n\ngovernment. At the same time, by the said guidelines it was made\n\nunambiguous that it is to be noted that the question is one of the\n\nlikelihood of continuous service and the rejection of a candidate\n\nneed not be advised on account of the presence of a defect which\n\nis only a small proportion of cases, if found to interfere with\n\ncontinuous effect of service.\n\n17. In these circumstances, the petitioner was left with no\n\nalternative remedy but to approach this Court once again by filing\n\nthe a writ petition in 2006 (connected herein), seeking appropriate\n\ndirections for appointment in the Rajasthan Administrative Service\n\nin accordance with his merit, and to set aside the medical\n\nunfitness findings as being unreasoned and arbitrary.\n\nNevertheless, the continued exclusion of the petitioner from the\n\nRAS cadre service, despite demonstrable merit and in absence of\n\nany sustainable medical disqualification, is violative of his\n\nfundamental rights and liable to be set.\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (10 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\n18. In view of the factual background already submitted\n\nbefore the Court, it was reiterated that the petitioner is an\n\nacademically distinguished and professionally accomplished\n\nindividual who has consistently demonstrated merit, competence,\n\nand administrative capability throughout his career. Learned\n\ncounsel submitted that the petitioner is a Gold Medalist in M.Sc.\n\n(Agronomy), conferred by a recognized university, and his\n\nachievements in academics are reflective of his cognitive and\n\nprofessional abilities. It was submitted that such academic\n\nexcellence negates any presumptive inference of incapability in\n\ndischarging administrative duties under the RAS cadre.\n\nNevertheless, the petitioner holds a 'B' Certificate of the National\n\nCadet Corps (NCC) and has qualified the National Eligibility Test\n\n(NET), in addition to publishing 15 peer-reviewed research papers\n\nand authoring a book titled \"Agronomic Terminology\", published by\n\nthe Indian Society of Agronomy, IARI, New Delhi. These\n\naccomplishments substantiate the petitioner's intellectual and\n\nadministrative acumen.\n\n19. Moreover, despite being diagnosed with Congenital\n\nNystagmus, the petitioner has continuously served in various\n\nhigh-responsibility public positions inter alia, Treasury Officer,\n\nChief Accounts Officer, Assistant General Manager (Medical\n\nServices), Comptroller of Sri Karan Narendra Agricultural\n\nUniversity, Officer on Special Duty (Revenue Mobilization), Jaipur\n\nDevelopment Authority, Accounts Officer, Tribal Area Development\n\n(TAD) Department, Jaipur, Accounts Officer, Jila Parishad Nagaur\n\nand has also undergone training at the prestigious Harishchandra\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (11 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nMathur Rajasthan Institute of Public Administration (HCM RIPA).\n\nAt no point the petitioner has faced any impairment which\n\nobstructed the efficient performance of his official duties, nor has\n\nany adverse report been recorded against him in this regard in the\n\nACRs qua him over the years.\n\n20. In light of the above averred achievements, it was\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner has demonstrated consistent\n\nadministrative and professional excellence, and any inference\n\ndrawn solely from a minor physical condition is wholly unjustified,\n\nunreasonable, and contrary to established constitutional and\n\nstatutory safeguards.\n\n21. Unfolding the arguments further, learned counsel had\n\naverred that the petitioner has successfully qualified all stages of\n\nthe RAS Examination 2003 and secured 21 st rank in the general\n\ncategory merit list, having undergone the same rigorous\n\ncompetitive process as other candidates. Thus, the denial of\n\nappointment despite high merit is a manifest violation of\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution of India, which guarantee equality of\n\nopportunity in public employment. The RAS recruitment process is\n\nmerit-centric. The petitioner being placed well within the range of\n\nselected candidates, ought to be appointed to the RAS cadre.\n\nInstead, a lower-ranked candidate (Rank 22) was appointed,\n\nthereby evidencing invidious discrimination.\n\n22. Nevertheless, from a rational thinking it can be inferred\n\nthat the action of respondents defies all logic and reasoning as\n\nwhile a person suffering from 40% benchmark disability is eligible\n\nfor appointment against the post in question, under the physically\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (12 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nhandicapped category, a candidate with a lesser degree of\n\ndisability, like the case of the petitioner, and is treated as\n\nmedically unfit. Such a candidate may not be entitled to the\n\nbenefit of reservation under the physically handicapped category,\n\nyet the statutory declaration clearly indicates that the petitioner's\n\ncondition does not disqualify him.\n\n23. The petitioner was not suffering from a benchmark\n\ndisability, as defined under Section 2(r) of the Rights of Persons\n\nwith\nDisabilities Act, 2016\n(hereinafter referred to as the\n\nAct of 2016), i.e., a disability of 40% or more. In fact, the\n\nDisability Commissioner, vide communication dated 05.07.2003,\n\ncertified that the petitioner had less than 20% disability, thereby\n\ndisqualifying him from availing any reservation but simultaneously\n\nbeing unreasonably excluded from general selection. For the sake\n\nof handiness the said definition is reproduced herein below:\n\n(r) \"person with benchmark disability\" means\na person with not less than forty per cent. of a\nspecified disability where specified disability has\nnot been defined in measurable terms and\nincludes a person with disability where specified\ndisability has been defined in measurable terms,\nas certified by the certifying authority;\n\n24. The action of the respondent authorities in denying\n\nappointment to the RAS cadre, while offering placement in the\n\nRajasthan Accounts Service (also a non-technical service under\n\nthe Guidelines of 1975), is arbitrary and irrational, violating the\n\nDoctrine of Reasonableness as enunciated under the provisions of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India and the fundamental rights\n\nof the petitioner as enshrined under\nArticle 21\nof the same.\n\nLikewise, the denial of service on medical grounds, despite\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (13 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nmedical fitness for equivalent posts, amounts to hostile\n\ndiscrimination and violates the spirit and objectives of the\n\nGuidelines of 1975, which govern classification of services as\n\ntechnical or non-technical and appointment thereto and\nSections\nand\n, of the Act of 2016 which mandate non-discrimination\n\nin public employment and equal opportunities.\n\n25. Subsequently, it was contended that ever since 2005,\n\nthe Union Public Service Commission and Central Government are\n\nappointing physically challenged candidates with benchmark\n\ndisabilities in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) cadre. By\n\n2008, the State of Rajasthan itself had implemented similar\n\npractices in the RAS cadre; moreso, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nand various High Courts have laid down in a catena of decisions\n\nthat meritorious candidates with lesser or non-benchmark\n\ndisabilities must not be excluded from appointment solely on\n\nmedical grounds if they are otherwise capable of discharging the\n\nfunctions required.\n\n26. The petitioner is consistently rated as \"Outstanding\" or\n\n\"Very Good\" in his Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) over the\n\nlast 20 years of government service, his official record further\n\naffirms that there is no hindrance or barrier arising from his\n\nphysical condition. Thus, excluding the petitioner from\n\nconsideration due to a disability that is less than the threshold for\n\neven claiming reservation reflects a flawed system, forcing\n\nmeritorious persons into an unjust dilemma -- to be \"more\n\ndisabled\" to qualify for equitable treatment. This ironical and\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (14 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nunjust position violates both human dignity and equal protection\n\nunder law.\n\n27. In support of the contentions noted hereinabove, and to\n\nconclude the stance taken, learned counsel had placed reliance\n\nupon the judgment passed by the Division Bench of this Court in\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. v. Ranjan Tak &\n\nAnr., DB Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 953/2023, decided\n\non 29.11.2024, wherein in similar circumstances, the Court\n\ndirected appointment of a meritorious candidate with 30%\n\ndisability in recognition of their capabilities and in light of the\n\nprinciples enshrined in the Act of 2016.\n\nSUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE\n\nRESPONDENTS :-\n\n28. Per contra, learned Additional Government Counsel\n\nappearing for the respondent-State, has strenuously opposed the\n\nreliefs sought in the writ petition and had raised the following legal\n\nand factual contentions:\n\n29. Non-Claim of Reservation under Disability\n\nCategory: It was submitted that the petitioner had not, at any\n\nstage, claimed consideration under the reserved category for\n\npersons with disabilities and in the absence of such a claim, the\n\npetitioner cannot subsequently assert any right to reservation\n\nunder the physically handicapped category. It is a well-settled\n\nprinciple that rights flowing from a reserved category cannot be\n\nextended to a candidate who has not claimed such benefit at the\n\nrelevant time. The law does not permit retrospective accrual of\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (15 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nsuch benefit where no foundational claim has been made in the\n\napplication or during the selection process.\n\n30. Medical Ineligibility and Supremacy of Medical\n\nBoard Opinion: It was further contended that, in accordance with\n\nthe prevailing rules and the medical guidelines operative at the\n\nrelevant time, the petitioner was declared medically unfit and\n\nunsuitable for the RAS cadre on a recurring basis by the duly\n\nconstituted Medical Board. As per Rules 19 and 20 of the\n\nRajasthan State and Subordinate Services (Direct\n\nRecruitment by Combined Competitive Examinations)\n\nRules, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 1999),\n\nfitness as determined by the Medical Board is a mandatory\n\neligibility criterion. The petitioner, being declared unfit, does not\n\npossess any vested right to seek appointment in the RAS cadre.\n\nMoreover, the consistent view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is\n\nthat the opinion of the Medical Board must be accorded primacy in\n\nservice matters concerning physical fitness.\nIn support of the\n\ncontentions noted hereinabove, learned counsel had placed\n\nreliance upon the ratio encapsulated in No.14666828M Ex CNF\n\nNarsingh Yadav v. Union of India & Ors., Civil Appeal No.\n\n7672/2019;\nOm Prakash Singh v. Union of India & Ors.,\n\nCivil Appeal No.\n5655/2010; Shri Munna Singh v. Union of\n\nIndia & Ors., Writ Petition No. 316/2020;\nD.K. Trivedi &\n\nOrs. v. State of Gujarat & Ors.\n, (1986) Supp.\n\nSCC 20;\n\nRaojibhai Jivabhai Patel & Ors. v. State of Gujarat & Ors.\n,\n\n(1989) Supp.\n(2) SCC 744; State of Rajasthan & Ors. v.\n\nSunita, DB Special Appeal Writ No. 572/2023; decided by the\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (16 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nCourt at Principal Seat, Jodhpur, vide order dated 31.08.2024,\n\nalong with other connected appeals.\n\n31. Doctrine of Estoppel and Acquiescence: It was\n\nfurther submitted that, in view of the petitioner's medical\n\nineligibility, the respondent-State, in exercise of its discretionary\n\npowers, considered the case of the petitioner with sensitivity and\n\ngranted him appointment in the Rajasthan Accounts Service on\n\nhumanitarian grounds. The petitioner, having accepted such\n\nappointment without protest or demur, is now estopped from\n\nchallenging the said appointment. The doctrine of estoppel by\n\nconduct and the principle of acquiescence bar the petitioner from\n\nseeking any alternate appointment or claiming elevation to the\n\nRAS cadre.\n\n32. Qua the issue of non-Challenge to Rules and Guidelines\n\nlearned counsel had pointed out that the petitioner had neither\n\nchallenged the validity of the guidelines of the year 1975 nor the\n\nrelevant rules and guidelines that govern recruitment and fitness\n\nfor appointment. In the absence of such a challenge, the\n\npetitioner's claim remains unsustainable in law. Moreso, a\n\nstatutory rule or government order carries the presumption of\n\nlegality and must be complied with unless declared ultra vires by a\n\ncompetent court. It was further submitted that, as clarified\n\nthrough the affidavits of the Chief Secretary and the Principal\n\nSecretary, the reservation or selection of candidates with\n\ndisabilities for RAS and IAS services began only during the period\n\n2005-2007. Prior to that, no such reservation existed. Despite\n\nthis, the petitioner was favorably considered and accommodated\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (17 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nbased on his meritorious record and positive performance\n\nfeedback, demonstrating the State's leniency and empathetic\n\napproach. However, such a one-time exception cannot be\n\nconverted into a precedent or a matter of right. Therefore, it can\n\nbe inferred that no vested right to employment in a particular\n\ncadre is created by the appointment so granted to the petitioner in\n\nthe Rajasthan Account Service cadre.\n\n33. Lastly, it was argued that employment in a particular\n\ncadre or service, especially in posts such as RAS, is not a matter\n\nof right but subject to fulfilling statutory criteria, including medical\n\nfitness. The discretionary power exercised by the State in offering\n\nalternate suitable employment is within its domain and cannot be\n\nconverted into an enforceable legal right by the petitioner.\n\n34. In view of the aforementioned submissions, learned\n\nAdditional Government Counsel has prayed for the dismissal of the\n\nwrit petition, stating that no case is made out for judicial\n\ninterference. The action of the respondent-State is well within the\n\nbounds of law, reason, and administrative discretion.\n\nDISCUSSION AND FINDINGS :-\n\n35. Having heard the rival arguments advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for both the parties, upon a perusal of the\n\nmaterial available on record, more specifically the erstwhile ACRs\n\nof the petitioner, scanning the judgments cited at the Bar and\n\njuxtaposing the contentions noted herein above, this Court at the\n\noutset is of the view that the Indian Constitution enshrines\n\njustice -- social, economic, and political -- as a core ideal of\n\nthe Preamble. India's model of governance is that of a welfare\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (18 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nstate, where the State bears a solemn duty to protect the\n\ninterests of its vulnerable and marginalized populations.\nArticle 41\n\nas enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy, of the\n\nConstitution of India further obligates the State to secure \"the\n\nright to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of\n\nunemployment, old age, sickness and disablement.\" In this\n\ncontext, the Act of 2016, is a manifestation of India's commitment\n\nto equality and dignity for all persons with disabilities. It mandates\n\nnon-discrimination in employment (\nSection 20\n), reasonable\n\naccommodation, and reservation in government posts.\n\n36. Yet in the matter in hand, the petitioner despite being\n\nmeritorious, qualified, and aspiring was denied consideration for a\n\nRAS cadre services not because he is able, but because his\n\ndisability is not \"sufficiently severe\" to meet the technical\n\nthreshold for reservation. Thus, he is excluded from both the\n\ngeneral category, due to functional limitations, and from the\n\nreserved category, due to not meeting the 40% disability\n\nthreshold. This leads to a tragic administrative blind spot, a form\n\nof constructive exclusion wherein, the petitioner is neither \"abled\"\n\nnor \"disabled enough\" to benefit from the system. The legal\n\nframework, intended to be inclusive, becomes ironically\n\nexclusionary. Hence the grief behind the statement: \"I wish I had\n\nbeen more disabled.\" It is not a rejection of self, but a damning\n\ncritique of a system that values percentage points over real\n\nbarriers, and checkboxes over capability. It calls into question\n\nwhether the State is truly seeing its citizens, or merely scanning\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (19 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nthem for conformity to pre-set categories under the garb of\n\nempathy and consideration.\n\n37. Consequentially, it is apposite to jot down certain\n\nundisputed facts of the present petitions:\n\n37.1 That it is an admitted position that the petitioner\n\nsuffers from low vision and is diagnosed with Congenital\n\nNystagmus.\n\n37.2 That the medical records dated 14 th March, 2001, 31st\n\nJuly, 2001, 1st December, 2005, and 6th January, 2006 including\n\nthe re-examination and re-medical assessments, consistently\n\nconclude that the petitioner is \"unfit for RAS, allied services due to\n\ndefective vision.\" However, no satisfactory justification of rationale\n\nbehind the said opinion is noted by the concerned experts.\n\n37.3 That the petitioner had successfully qualified all stages\n\nof the Rajasthan Administrative Services Examination conducted in\n\nthe year 1999 and was placed at 360 th position in the overall merit\n\nlist. Subsequently, in the RAS Examinations held in the years 2001\n\nand 2003, the petitioner once again qualified all stages and\n\nsecured a significantly improved 21st rank in the merit list. The\n\npetitioner, in both the Rajasthan Administrative Services (RAS)\n\nExaminations conducted in the years 1999 and 2003, had\n\nappeared under the 'general category' and not under any reserved\n\ncategory, despite being eligible for Other Backward Classes (OBC)\n\nreservation and having a known medical condition of low vision.\n\nNotably, the petitioner successfully secured 360 th and 21st\n\npositions in the final merit list, respectively, which reflects his\n\nacademic and competitive merit beyond any reservation benefit.\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (20 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\n37.4 That one Ms. Prabha Gautam, who secured the 22 nd\n\nrank in the said merit list, was appointed to the RAS cadre service.\n\nIn contrast, the petitioner, despite attaining the 21 st rank, was\n\ninitially excluded from appointment by an order dated 21.04.2006.\n\nHowever, upon consideration of the petitioner's representation and\n\npursuant to directions issued by the office of the Hon'ble Chief\n\nMinister, the petitioner was subsequently allocated to the\n\nRajasthan Accounts Service on 22.04.2006.

Accordingly, in\n\nthe peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner\n\nwas permitted to join service, reflecting a conscious and reasoned\n\ndecision by the competent authority.\n\n37.6 This Court further observes that at no point did the\n\npetitioner apply under or seek the benefit of the physically\n\nhandicapped category, nor did he claim any reservation in the\n\nselection process. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- the\n\nexpress mention of one category (general) implies the exclusion of\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (23 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nthe other (reserved), thereby confirming that the petitioner sought\n\nconsideration solely on merit.\n\n38. It is also pertinent to note that the petitioner does not\n\nfall within the definition of a person with \"benchmark disability\" as\n\ncontemplated under the applicable legal framework, being below\n\nthe 40% threshold. The Commissioner for Disabilities, in\n\ncategorical terms, recorded a finding that the petitioner does not\n\npossess a benchmark disability. Contrarily, the medical boards,\n\nconsistently from the year 1999 through 2006, opined that the\n\npetitioner was unfit for the Rajasthan Administrative Services and\n\nallied services, on account of his visual impairment. This apparent\n\ncontradiction between administrative and medical determinations\n\ncalls for the application of the principle audi alteram partem i.e.\n\nthe right to be heard as well as a harmonized interpretation of\n\nmedical incapacity and administrative discretion; however, in the\n\nmatter in hand the plea of the petitioner was not considered by\n\nthe medical board within the stipulated period, moreover, the\n\npetitioner had to move from pillars to pole to attain the said\n\nmedical opinion.\n\n39. Notwithstanding the adverse medical opinions, the\n\npetitioner's professional record, as reflected in his Annual\n\nConfidential Reports (ACRs), is found to be consistently\n\nexemplary. The petitioner is rated as either \"outstanding\" or \"very\n\ngood\" in all relevant service periods. No adverse, stigmatic, or\n\nderogatory remarks appear on record. This Court at this nascent\n\njuncture deems it appropriate the rely on the principle of Res ipsa\n\nloquitur i.e. the thing speaks for itself, and is of the opinion that\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (24 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nthe petitioner's service record speaks to his efficiency,\n\ncompetence, and contribution, which has proven to be an asset to\n\nthe State across various departments, corporations, and postings.\n\n40. The petitioner's ACRs, academic records, and service\n\ncredentials indicate consistent excellence, as reflected by ratings\n\nof \"Outstanding\" and \"Very Good.\" In terms of Rules 19 and 20 of\n\nthe Rajasthan State and Subordinate Services (Direct Recruitment\n\nby Combined Competitive Examination) Rules, 1999, the State\n\nGovernment is vested with discretionary authority to grant\n\nappointments. While such discretion is not a vested right in favour\n\nof the petitioner, once the government itself, through its highest\n\nexecutive offices, namely the Hon'ble Chief Minister and Chief\n\nSecretary, has exercised this discretion in the petitioner's favour\n\nfor Rajasthan Accounts Services, the subsequent exclusion from\n\nRAS cadre appears to be not only arbitrary, but also discriminatory\n\nand violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India.\n\n41. Upon perusal of the Guidelines of 1975 pertaining to\n\nmedical fitness and classification of services, it is noted that the\n\nsaid guidelines divide governmental services into two broad\n\ncategories: technical and non-technical. Technical services include\n\nposts requiring specialized physical standards, such as\n\nengineering, medical, and certain Group 'B' services. In contrast,\n\nnon-technical services, such as, the Rajasthan Administrative\n\nServices, Rajasthan Accounts Services, and analogous posts, are\n\nnot predicated upon stringent physical fitness criteria. The\n\nGuidelines explicitly recognize that individuals with diminished\n\nphysical capabilities, including low vision, are capable of\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (25 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\ndischarging duties effectively in non-technical services. Thus,\n\nwhere no essential physical prerequisites exist, exclusion solely on\n\nmedical grounds, in absence of statutory bar or functional\n\nincapacity, may amount to arbitrariness.\n\n42. Upon a comprehensive reading of the Guidelines of\n\n1975 relating to medical assessment for government services, this\n\nCourt finds no material distinction between the functional nature\n\nor service requirements of the Rajasthan Administrative Service\n\nand the Rajasthan Accounts Service. Both are classified as \"non-\n\ntechnical services\" and are not contingent upon heightened\n\nphysical standards. Thus, any differentiation in treatment between\n\nthese two cadres, on the ground of medical unfitness due to low\n\nvision, appears to be bereft of any rational basis and is\n\ninconsistent with the object of the said guidelines. Such\n\ndifferential treatment without intelligible differentia violates the\n\ntest laid down in the ratio of\nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil\n\nNadu\n: (1974) 4 SCC 3.\n\n43. Moreover, in the ratio encapsulated in Oil and Natural\n\nGas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (Supra), the Division Bench\n\ncategorically held that individuals falling in the intermediate\n\ncategory i.e., those with less than 40% disability but more than\n\nnegligible impairment ought not to be excluded from consideration\n\nmerely on the ground of not possessing a benchmark disability.\n\nThe Division Bench, while construing\nSections 2(h)\n,\n2(r)\n,\n2(s)\n, and\nof the Rights of Persons with\nDisabilities Act, 2016\n(hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the Act of 2016), held that:\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (26 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\n43.1 The term \"discrimination\" under\nSection 2(h)\nincludes\n\ndenial of reasonable accommodation;\n\n43.2 The principles of \"equality\" and \"non-discrimination\"\n\nenshrined in\nSection 3\nmandate that individuals with disabilities be\n\ntreated with parity;\n\n43.3 The definitions of \"person with benchmark disability\"\n\nunder\nSection 2(r)\nand \"person with disability\" under\nSection 2(s)\n\nmust be interpreted harmoniously to avoid exclusion of those with\n\nless than 40% disability from the purview of equal opportunity.\n\n44. The Division Bench held that if persons with benchmark\n\ndisabilities are granted reservation and appointment, the exclusion\n\nof those with a lesser degree of disability who are otherwise\n\nmeritorious, from the appointment, on grounds of medical\n\nunfitness, would defeat the legislative intent and spirit of the Act\n\nof 2016. It was poignantly observed that such a person cannot be\n\nleft to ponder, \"Why was I not more disabled, so as to qualify for\n\nconsideration?\" Such an interpretation would be contrary to\n\ninternational human rights instruments, including the principles of\n\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons\n\nwith Disabilities (UNCRPD), 2007, The Persons with\n\nDisabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and\n\nFull Participation) Act, 1995\nand antithetical to the objectives\n\nof the Act of 2016. The relevant extract from the dictum passed\n\nby the Division Bench is reproduced herein below:\n\n\"25. While dealing with persons with disabilities, a\npublic functionary is required to act with higher degree\nof sensitivity, objectivity and in furtherance, not only\nlaws, but also the spirit of the Act of 2016. Equality of\ntreatment is not merely a statutory right, but a\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (27 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nfundamental right which is at stake in the present case.\nDenial of such right not only violates the Constitution\nor Statue, but also the basic human right of specially\nabled persons to live with dignity. Learned Single Judge\nrightly observed that the treatment meted out to\nRespondent No. 1 amounts to rubbing salt to such\ninjury by denying Respondent No.1 his legitimate and\nlegal right and make him think the worst that the ball\nshould have caused 10% more injury so that his merit\nwould not be trampled upon and he could get\nappointment at least against the reserved posts. We\nwould add by saying that denial of appointment to\nRespondent No. 1 has added insult to injury which\nmust be deprecated.\n\nThat is the reason why in the beginning of our\njudgment, we have observed that it is the attitudinal\nbarrier which is the matter of concern.\nSection 2\n,\nclause (c) of the Act of 2016, in that context, defines\nthe word, 'barrier' as below:\n\n\"2. Definitions.--In this Act, unless the context\notherwise requires,--\n\n(a) ........\n\n(b) .......\n\n(c) \"barrier\" means any factor including\ncommunicational, cultural, economic,\nenvironmental, institutional, political, social,\n\nattitudinal or structural factors which hampers the\nfull and effective participation of persons with\ndisabilities in society;\"\n\n26. We hope and trust that the appellants while\ndealing with persons with disabilities will act free from\nsuch barrier which hampers the full and effective\nparticipation of the persons with disabilities in the\nsociety. We are also of the view that present is a fit\ncase where cost should be imposed upon the\nappellants.\"\n\n45. The petitioner has rendered over two decades of\n\nexemplary service in non-technical roles, where his disability did\n\nnot hinder performance. The respondents' claim of his unsuitability\n\nfor field posts is negated by the record of consistent high\n\nperformance, thus undermining the rationale for denial of RAS\n\ncadre. Therefore, the maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit (an\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (28 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nact of the court shall prejudice no one) must apply to ensure the\n\npetitioner's rights are not defeated by executive inconsistency.\n\n46. It is also noted that persons possessing benchmark\n\ndisabilities have, since the year 2005 up to 2007, been appointed\n\nto high-ranking posts within the Indian Administrative Service\n\n(IAS) and Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS). The petitioner\n\nhas submitted a list of 26 such instances (Reiterated in order\n\ndated 22.01.2025), of which at least five appointments were\n\nexpressly acknowledged by the State in the affidavit filed by the\n\nlearned Chief Secretary. The only contention raised by the State is\n\nthat, during the relevant time, statutory provisions did not\n\nexplicitly permit such appointments. Notwithstanding this position,\n\nthe State adopted a sympathetic approach by offering the\n\npetitioner an appointment in the Rajasthan Accounts Service,\n\nalbeit while declining his claim to the RAS, citing alleged non-\n\nperformance in field postings as recorded in the departmental\n\norder-sheet.\n\n47. This Court finds that such selective reliance on medical\n\nassessment and selective exclusion from a particular cadre,\n\ndespite meritorious performance and subsequent acknowledgment\n\nof capability in another cadre, warrants judicial scrutiny under the\n\nprinciples of reasonable classification and substantive equality\n\nenshrined under\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n48. The Court, invoking the UNCRPD, 2007 principles and\n\nthe provisions of the Act of 2016, observes that the law recognizes\n\ntwo distinct categories:\n\n(I) Persons with benchmark disabilities (≥40%)\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (29 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\n(II) Persons with disabilities (<40%)\n\nThe interpretation, as herein drawn by the respondents, that\n\ndenies a person with lesser disability from appointment on medical\n\ngrounds, while accommodating a more disabled person under the\n\nreservation category, is a paradoxical injustice and contrary to the\n\ndoctrine of proportional equality as enshrined under\nArticles 14\n,\n, and\nof the Constitution of India. Such interpretation\n\nfrustrates the legislative intent and compels a person to lament\n\nthat they were not more disabled.\n\n49. The reasoning adopted in the government's internal\n\nnotes that the petitioner is fit for Rajasthan Accounts Service but\n\nnot for RAS, is fundamentally flawed and based on a\n\nmisinterpretation of the applicable guidelines. The record shows\n\nthat from 2005 to 2007 and earlier, candidates with benchmark\n\ndisabilities were appointed to IAS and RAS posts. Thus, the denial\n\nto the petitioner who stands higher on merit and without a claim\n\nfor reservation is arbitrary, illusory, and contrary to judicial\n\nprecedents and the constitutional mandate of substantive\n\nequality; especially when once the petitioner was adjudged fit for\n\nRajasthan Accounts Service, and the Guidelines of 1975 treat both\n\ncadres similarly, a contrary view for RAS cannot sustain judicial\n\nscrutiny. The respondents' selective application of the rules\n\noffends the principle of non-arbitrariness.\n\n50.\nThe Constitution of India and the Act\nof 2016 provide a\n\nlevel playing field for differently-abled persons. When a candidate\n\nplaced 21st in merit, with outstanding service records, gold\n\nmedals, and commendable publications, is denied a rightful post\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (30 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\nsolely due to lesser disability, it constitutes a direct affront to\n\nArticle 14\nand amounts to per iniquitatem jus non oritur i.e. a\n\nright does not arise from injustice. The Division Bench in Oil and\n\nNatural Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (Supra) emphasized the\n\nneed for sensitive and inclusive governance. Equal treatment and\n\neffective participation of specially-abled persons is a constitutional\n\nobligation, and their dignity must not be compromised by flawed\n\ninterpretations.\n\n51. The contention of principles of acquiescence or estoppel\n\non the ground of the petitioner's joining Rajasthan Accounts\n\nService is unsustainable. The petitioner has consistently\n\nchallenged the denial of his candidature for services of RAS cadre,\n\nas evident from his filings in 2001 and 2006. Thus, the doctrine of\n\napprobate and reprobate does not apply.\n\nCONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS :-\n\n52. In view of the foregoing observations and analysis, this\n\nCourt finds the rejection of the petitioner's candidature for the\n\nRAS cadre services is arbitrary, discriminatory, and\n\nunconstitutional, warranting judicial intervention under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution of India. Thence, the decision dated\n\n05.07.2001 holding the petitioner to be unfit for Rajasthan\n\nAdministrative Services and allied services due to defective vision\n\nis hereby quashed and set aside.\n\n53. Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the\n\nrespondents are directed to:\n\n53.1 Grant the petitioner appointment w.e.f. 21.04.2006 i.e.\n\nthe date on which the next candidate in merit, Ms. Prabha Gautam\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\n[2025:RJ-JP:16526] (31 of 31) [CW-4343/2001]\n\n(Rank 22), was appointed in the RAS cadre service in the\n\nRajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) cadre; with all\n\nconsequential benefits, including arrears, seniority, promotions\n\nand pensionary advantages;\n\n53.2 Include notional calculation for pension and other\n\nservice-related benefits from the date of filing of the first petition\n\nin 2001, considering that by way of interim order dated\n\n03.09.2001, granted in SB Civil Writ Petition No.4343/2001, one\n\npost was directed to be kept vacant for the petitioner.\n\n53.4 This Court further directs that, in recognition of the\n\nundue hardships, humiliation and prolonged discrimination\n\nendured by the petitioner, he be compensated with ₹5,00,000/-\n\n(Rupees Five Lakhs Only), to be paid by the respondent-State.\n\n54. In a symbolic gesture of institutional redressal and\n\nacknowledgment of merit, the petitioner shall be formally granted\n\nRAS cadre appointment in the presence of the Chief Secretary of\n\nthe State, reflecting a progressive and sensitive governance ethos\n\ntoward differently-abled citizens.\n\n55. The above directions shall be implemented within a\n\nperiod of one month from the date of pronouncement of this\n\njudgment.\n\n56. With these directions, these writ petitions stand\n\nallowed. Stay application and/or pending applications, if any, shall\n\nstand disposed of.\n\n(SAMEER JAIN),J\n\nPreeti Asopa\n\n(Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
