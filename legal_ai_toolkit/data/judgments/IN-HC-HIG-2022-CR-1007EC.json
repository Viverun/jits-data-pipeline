Averments contained in the petition, which is duly supported\n\nby an affidavit, reveal that FIR sought to be quashed in the instant\n\nproceedings came to be lodged at the behest of the respondent No.4 Sh.\n\nBhavneshwar Dutt (herein after referred to as \"the complainant\"), who\n\nalleged that on 1.7.2021, he had parked his motorcycle bearing registration\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nNo. HP 33C 7677 outside his house. He alleged that when on 2.7.2021, at\n\n.\n\n8:00am, he came outside his house, his motorcycle as detailed herein\n\nabove was missing. He alleged that on inquiry, he was informed that his\n\nmotorcycle is parked in the court yard of petitioner -Vishal. On the basis of\n\naforesaid complaint, police conducted investigation and found that\n\npetitioner-accused Parveen Kumar had actually stolen motorcycle of\n\nrespondent No.2 alongwith other co-accused namely Abhishek Sharma and\n\nUday Sharma and thereafter, they had sold the same for sum of Rs.\n\n8,000/- to petitioner accused No.4 Vishal Kumar. Petitioners No. 1 to 3\n\nafter having stolen the motorcycle changed its number plate with a view to\n\nsave themselves and put the number of scooter i.e. HP 74-2228 on the\n\nmotorcycle, however, police recovered the motorcycle and handed over the\n\nsame to the respondent and registered the case against all the petitioners.\n\nThough after completion of investigation, police presented challan in the\n\ncompetent court of law, but before same could be taken to its logical end,\n\nparties have entered into compromise, whereby they have resolved to settle\n\ntheir dispute amicably inter-se them. In the aforesaid background, all the\n\npetitioners, who are students of ITI, Hamirpur, have approached this Court\n\nfor quashing of FIR as well as consequent proceedings pending in the\n\ncompetent court of law.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\n3. Vide order dated 10.8.2022, this Court while directing the\n\n.\n\nrespondent -State to verify the factum with regard to compromise, if any,\n\narrived inter-se parties also deemed it necessary to cause presence of the\n\nparties, especially respondent No.4, at whose instance FIR sought to be\n\nquashed came to be instituted. Pursuant to aforesaid order, Mr. Narender\n\nGuleria, learned Additional Advocate General has placed on record\n\ncommunication dated respondent No.14.9.2022, received from\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Mandi, perusal whereof reveals that parties to the\n\nlis have amicably settled the dispute inter-se them.\n\n4. Respondent No. 4, who is present in the Court and duly\n\nrepresented by Mr. Mukul Sood, Advocate, states oath that he of his own\n\nvolition and without there being any external pressure has entered into\n\ncompromise, whereby both the parties have resolved to settle their dispute\n\namicably. He states that since all the petitioners are well known to him, he\n\ndoes not wish to prosecute the case further. He states that otherwise also,\n\nentire career of the petitioners would be ruined in case they are convicted\n\nin the criminal proceedings initiated at his behest. He states that since all\n\nthe petitioners have already apologized for their misconduct and have\n\nundertaken not to repeat such act in future, he shall have no objection in\n\ncase prayer made by the petitioners for quashing of FIR is accepted.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nRespondent No. 4 while admitting the contents of the compromise also\n\n.\n\nadmits the signatures on the same.

Mr. Narender Guleria, learned Additional Advocate General,\n\nhaving heard aforesaid statement made by respondent No.4 states that in\n\nview of the amicable settlement arrived inter-se parties, no fruitful purpose\n\nwould be served in case FIR sought to be quashed as well as consequent\n\nproceedings pending before the court below are allowed to sustain. He\n\nfurther states that otherwise also, chances of conviction of the petitioners\n\nin view of the aforesaid statement made on oath by the petitioners are very\n\nremote and bleak and as such, prayer made in the instant petition may be\n\naccepted.\n\n6. Since the petition has been filed under\nSection 482\nCr.PC, this\n\nCourt deems it fit to consider the present petition in the light of the\n\njudgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in\nNarinder Singh and others\n\nversus State of Punjab and another\n(2014)6 Supreme Court Cases 466,\n\nwhereby Hon'ble Apex Court has formulated guidelines for accepting the\n\nsettlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to accept the\n\nsettlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings. Perusal\n\nof judgment\nreferred above\nclearly depicts that in para 29.1, Hon'ble Apex\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nCourt has returned the findings that power conferred under\nSection 482\n\n.\n\nof the Code is to be distinguished from the power which lies in the Court to\n\ncompound the offences under\nsection 320\nof the Code. No doubt, under\n\nsection 482\nof the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the\n\ncriminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable,\n\nwhere the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However,\n\nthis power is to be exercised sparingly and with great caution. Para Nos. 29\n\nto 29.7 of the judgment are reproduced as under:-\n\n\"29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down\nthe following principles by which the High Court would be guided\nin giving adequate treatment to the settlement between the\nparties and exercising its power under\nSection 482\nof the Code\nwhile accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or\nrefusing to accept the settlement with direction to continue with\n\nthe criminal proceedings:\n\n29.1Power conferred under\nSection 482\nof the Code is to be\ndistinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound\n\nthe offences under\nSection 320\nof the Code. No doubt, under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code, the High Court has inherent power to\nquash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not\n\ncompoundable, where the parties have settled the matter between\nthemselves. However, this power is to be exercised sparingly and\nwith caution.\n\n29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that\nbasis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the\nguiding factor in such cases would be to secure:\n\n(i) ends of justice, or\n\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nWhile exercising the power under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C the High\n\n.\n\nCourt is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two\n\nobjectives.\n\n29.3. Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions\nwhich involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly,\nfor offences alleged to have been committed under special statute\nlike the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by\nPublic Servants while working in that capacity are not to be\nquashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim\nand the offender.\n\n29.4. On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly\nand pre-dominantly civil character, particularly those arising out\nof commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial\nrelationship or family disputes should be quashed when the\n\nparties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves.\n\n29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as\nto whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused\nto him by not quashing the criminal cases.\n\n29.6. Offences under\nSection 307\nIPC would fall in the category of\nheinous and serious offences and therefore is to be generally\ntreated as crime against the society and not against the\nindividual alone. However, the High Court would not rest its\n\ndecision merely because there is a mention of\nSection 307\nIPC in\nthe FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be\nopen to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of\n\nSection 307\nIPC is there for the sake of it or the prosecution has\ncollected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to\nproving the charge under\nSection 307\nIPC. For this purpose, it\nwould be open to the High Court to go by the nature of injury\n\nsustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate\nparts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical report in\nrespect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\nguiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High\nCourt can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In\nthe former case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash\nthe criminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be\npermissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding\nthe offence based on complete settlement between the parties. At\nthis stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nsettlement between the parties is going to result in harmony\n\n.\n\nbetween them which may improve their future relationship.\n\n29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section\n482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role.\nThose cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after\nthe alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under\n\ninvestigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the\nsettlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\nbecause of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still\non and even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those\ncases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start\nor the evidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show\n\nbenevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima\nfacie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above.\nOn the other hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost\ncomplete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at\nthe stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain\nfrom exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code, as in\n\nsuch cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the\n\ncase finally on merits and to come a conclusion as to whether the\noffence under\nSection 307\nIPC is committed or not. Similarly, in\nthose cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial\ncourt and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High\nCourt, mere compromise between the parties would not be a\nground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the offender\n\nwho has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge is\nproved under\nSection 307\nIPC and conviction is already recorded\nof a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of sparing\na convict found guilty of such a crime\".\n\n\"32. We find from the impugned order that the sole reason\nwhich weighed with the High Court in refusing to accept the\n\nsettlement between the parties was the nature of injuries. If we go\nby that factor alone, normally we would tend to agree with the\nHigh Court's approach. However, as pointed out hereinafter, some\nother attendant and inseparable circumstances also need to be\n\nkept in mind which compels us to take a different view.\n\n33. We have gone through the FIR as well which was recorded on\nthe basis of statement of the complainant/victim. It gives an\nindication that the complainant was attacked allegedly by the\naccused persons because of some previous dispute between the\nparties, though nature of dispute, etc. is not stated in detail.\nHowever, a very pertinent statement appears on record viz.\n\"respectable persons have been trying for a compromise up till\nnow, which could not be finalized.\" This becomes an important\naspect. It appears that there have been some disputes which led\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nto the aforesaid purported attack by the accused on the\n\n.\n\ncomplainant. In this context when we find that the elders of the\n\nvillage, including Sarpanch, intervened in the matter and the\nparties have not only buried their hatchet but have decided to\nlive peacefully in future, this becomes an important\nconsideration. The evidence is yet to be led in the Court. It has\nnot even started. In view of compromise between parties, there is\n\na minimal chance of the witnesses coming forward in support of\nthe prosecution case. Even though nature of injuries can still be\nestablished by producing the doctor as witness who conduced\nmedical examination, it may become difficult to prove as to who\ncaused these injuries. The chances of conviction, therefore,\nappear to be remote. It would, therefore, be unnecessary to drag\n\nthese proceedings. We, taking all these factors into\nconsideration cumulatively, are of the opinion that the\ncompromise between the parties be accepted and the criminal\nproceedings arising out of FIR No.121 dated 14.7.2010 registered\nwith police station Lopoke, District Amritsar Rural be quashed.\nWe order accordingly.\"\n\n7. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case\nGian Singh v. State of\n\nPunjab\nand anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303 has held that power of the High\n\nCourt in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in\n\nexercise of its inherent power is distinct and different from the power of a\n\nCriminal Court for compounding offences under\nSection 320\nCr.PC. Even\n\nin the judgment passed in\nNarinder Singh\n's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nhas held that while exercising inherent power under\nSection 482\nCr.PC the\n\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime and its\n\nsocial impact and it cautioned the Courts not to exercise the power for\n\nquashing proceedings in heinous and serious offences of mental depravity,\n\nmurder, rape, dacoity etc.\nHowever subsequently, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nin Dimpey Gujral and Ors. vs. Union Territory through Administrator,\n\n.\n\nUT, Chandigarh and Ors. (2013( 11 SCC 497 has also held as under:-\n\n\"7. In certain decisions of this Court in view of the settlement\narrived at by the parties, this Court quashed the FIRs though\n\nsome of the offences were non-compoundable. A two Judges'\nBench of this court doubted the correctness of those decisions.\nLearned Judges felt that in those decisions, this court had\npermitted compounding of non-compoundable offences. The said\nissue was, therefore, referred to a larger bench.\n\nThe larger Bench in\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n(2012) 10 SCC\n303 considered the relevant provisions of the Code and the\njudgments of this court and concluded as under: (SCC pp. 342-\n43, para 61)\n\n61. The position that emerges from the above discussion\ncan be summarised thus: the power of the High Court in\n\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and\n\ndifferent from the power given to a criminal court for\ncompounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.\nInherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in accord with the\nguideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the\n\nends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\nCourt. In what cases power to quash the criminal\nproceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of each case and\n\nno category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of\nsuch power, the High Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious\n\noffences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\nrape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even\nthough the victim or victim's family and the offender have\nsettled the dispute. Such offences are not private in\n\nnature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation to\nthe offences under special statutes like\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act\nor the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity etc; cannot\nprovide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings\ninvolving such offences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand\non different footing for the purposes of quashing,\nparticularly the offences arising from commercial,\nfinancial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\ntransactions or the offences arising out of matrimony\n\n.\n\nrelating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the\n\nwrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category\nof cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in\nits view, because of the compromise between the offender\nand victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and\n\nbleak and continuation of criminal case would put\naccused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme\ninjustice would be caused to him by not quashing the\ncriminal case despite full and complete settlement and\ncompromise with the victim. In other words, the High\nCourt must consider whether it would be unfair or\n\ncontrary to the interest of justice to continue with the\ncriminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal\nproceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law\ndespite settlement and compromise between the victim\nand wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,\nit is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if\n\nthe answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the\nHigh Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash\n\nthe criminal proceeding.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n8. In the light of the above observations of this court in Gian\nSingh, we feel that this is a case where the continuation of\ncriminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of\n\nlaw because the alleged offences are not heinous offences\nshowing extreme depravity nor are they against the society.\nThey are offences of a personal nature and burying them would\nbring about peace and amity between the two sides. In the\ncircumstances of the case, FIR No. 163 dated 26.10.2006\n\nregistered under\nSection 147\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC at Police Station Sector 3, Chandigarh and all\nconsequential proceedings arising there from including the final\n\nreport presented under Section 173 of the Code and charges\nframed by the trial Court are hereby quashed.\n\n8. Recently Hon'ble Apex Court in its latest judgment dated 4th\n\nOctober, 2017, titled as\nParbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai\n\nKarmur and others versus State of Gujarat and Another\n, passed in\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1723 of 2017 arising out of SLP(Crl) No.9549 of 2016,\n\nreiterated the principles/ parameters\nlaid down in\n\nNarinder Singh\n's case\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nsupra for accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings. It would\n\n.\n\nbe profitable to reproduce para No. 13 to 15 of the judgment herein:\n\n\"13. The same principle was followed in\nCentral Bureau of\nInvestigation v. Maninder Singh\n(2016)1 SCC 389 by a bench of\n\ntwo learned Judges of this Court. In that case, the High Court\nhad, in the exercise of its inherent power under Section 482\nquashed proceedings under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 read\nwith Section 120-B of the Penal Code. While allowing the appeal\nfiled by the Central Bureau of Investigation Mr Justice Dipak\n\nMisra (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that the\ncase involved allegations of forgery of documents to embezzle the\nfunds of the bank. In such a situation, the fact that the dispute\nhad been settled with the bank would not justify a recourse to\nthepower under Section 482:\n\nr\"...In economic offences Court must not only keep in view\nthat money has been paid to the bank which has been\n\ndefrauded but also the society at large. It is not a case of\nsimple assault or a theft of a trivial amount; but the\noffence with which we are concerned is well planned and\nwas committed with a deliberate design with an eye of\npersonal profit regardless of consequence to the society\n\nat large. To quash the proceeding merely on the ground\nthat the accused has settled the amount with the bank\nwould be a misplaced sympathy. If the prosecution\nagainst the economic offenders are not allowed to\n\ncontinue, the entire community is aggrieved.\"\n\n14. In a subsequent decision in State of Tamil Nadu v R\n\nVasanthi Stanley (2016) 1 SCC 376, the court rejected the\nsubmission that the first respondent was a woman \"who was\nfollowing the command of her husband\" and had signed certain\ndocuments without being aware of the nature of the fraud which\n\nwas being perpetrated on the bank. Rejecting the submission,\nthis Court held that:\n\n\"... Lack of awareness, knowledge or intent is neither to\nbe considered nor accepted in economic offences. The\nsubmission assiduously presented on gender leaves us\nunimpressed. An offence under the criminal law is an\noffence and it does not depend upon the gender of an\naccused. True it is, there are certain provisions in Code of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nCriminal Procedure relating to exercise of jurisdiction\n\n.\n\nUnder Section 437, etc. therein but that altogether\n\npertains to a different sphere. A person committing a\nmurder or getting involved in a financial scam or forgery\nof documents, cannot claim discharge or acquittal on the\nground of her gender as that is neither constitutionally\n\nnor statutorily a valid argument. The offence is gender\nneutral in this case. We say no more on this score...\"\n\n\"...A grave criminal offence or serious economic offence or\nfor that matter the offence that has the potentiality to\ncreate a dent in the financial health of the institutions, is\n\nnot to be quashed on the ground that there is delay in\ntrial or the principle that when the matter has been\nsettled it should be quashed to avoid the load on the\nsystem...\"\n\n15.The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on\n\n(i)\n\nthe subject may be summarized in the following propositions:\n\nSection 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High\n\nCourt to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to\nsecure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer\nnew powers. It only recognizes and preserves powers which\ninhere in the High Court;\n\n(ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to\n\nquash a First Information Report or a criminal\nproceeding on the ground that a settlement has been\narrived at between the offender and the victim is not the\nsame as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of\n\ncompounding an offence. While compounding an offence,\nthe power of the court is governed by the provisions of\n\nSection 320\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n\nThe power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if\nthe offence is non-compoundable.\n\n(iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or\n\ncomplaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction\nunder Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether\nthe ends of justice would justify the exercise of the\ninherent power;\n\n(iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a\nwide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the\nprocess of any court;\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\n(v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First\n\n.\n\nInformation Report should be quashed on the ground that\n\nthe offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves\nultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case\nand no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be\nformulated;\n\n(vi) In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while\ndealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity\nof the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving\n\nmental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and\ndacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim\nor the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such\noffences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but\nhave a serious impact upon society. The decision to\n\ncontinue with the trial in such cases is founded on\nthe overriding element of public interest in punishing\n\npersons for serious offences;\n\n(vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be\ncriminal cases which have an overwhelming or\npredominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a\n\ndistinct footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent\npower to quash is concerned;\n\n(viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from\n\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or\nsimilar transactions with an essentially civil flavour\n\nmay in appropriate situations fall for quashing where\nparties have settled the dispute;\n\n(ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal\n\nproceeding if in view of the compromise between the\ndisputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and\nthe continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause\noppression and prejudice; and\n\n(x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\npropositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences\ninvolving the financial and economic well-being of the state\nhave implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\ndispute between private disputants. The High Court\n\n.\n\nwould be justified in declining to quash where the\n\noffender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or\neconomic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of\nthe act complained of upon the financial or economic\nsystem will weigh in the balance.\n\n9. It is quite apparent from the aforesaid exposition of law that\n\nHigh Court has inherent power to quash criminal proceedings even in those\n\ncases which are not compoundable, but such power is to be exercised\n\nsparingly and with great caution. In the judgments, referred hereinabove,\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has categorically held that Court while exercising\n\ninherent power under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C., must have due regard to the\n\nnature and gravity of offence sought to be compounded. Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nhas though held that heinous and serious offences of mental depravity,\n\nmurder, rape, dacoity etc. cannot appropriately be quashed though the\n\nvictim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute, but it has also\n\nobserved that while exercising its powers, High Court is to examine as to\n\nwhether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation\n\nof criminal cases would put the accused to great oppression and prejudice\n\nand extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal\n\ncases. Hon'ble Apex Court has further held that Court while exercising\n\npower under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C can also be swayed by the fact that\n\nsettlement between the parties is going to result in harmony between them\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nwhich may improve their future relationship. Hon'ble Apex Court in its\n\n.\n\njudgment rendered in State of Tamil Nadu supra, has reiterated that\n\nSection 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an\n\nabuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice and has\n\nheld that the power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the\n\noffence is non-compoundable. In the aforesaid judgment Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has held that while forming an opinion whether a criminal\n\nproceedings or complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction\n\nunder Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of\n\njustice would justify the exercise of the inherent power.\n\n10. In the case at hand also, offences alleged to have been\n\ncommitted by the petitioners do not involve offences of moral turpitude or\n\nany grave/heinous crime, rather same are petty offences, as such, this\n\nCourt deems it appropriate to quash the FIR as well as consequential\n\nproceedings thereto, especially keeping in view the fact that the petitioners\n\nand respondent have compromised the matter inter-se them, in which case,\n\npossibility of conviction is remote/bleak and no fruitful purpose would be\n\nserved in continuing with the criminal proceedings.\n\n11. Since the matter stands compromised between the parties and\n\nrespondent No 4 is no more interested in pursuing the criminal proceedings\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS\nagainst the petitioners, no fruitful purpose would be served in case\n\n.\n\nproceedings initiated at the behest of the respondent are allowed to\n\ncontinue, as such, prayer made in the petition at hand can be accepted.\n\n12. Consequently, in view of the averments contained in the\n\npetition as well as the submissions having been made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties that the matter has been compromised, and keeping\n\nin mind the well settled proposition of law as well as the compromise being\n\ngenuine, FIR No. 266 of 2021, dated 25.8.2021, under\nSections 379\n,\nand\nof IPC, registered with Police Station Balh, District Mandi, H.P., as\n\nwell as consequent proceedings, if any, pending before the court below, are\n\nordered to be quashed and set-aside.\n\n13. The present petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms.\n\nPending application(s), if any, also stands disposed of.\n\n20th October, 2022 (Sandeep Sharma),\n(manjit) Judge\n\n::: Downloaded on - 27/10/2022 20:31:53 :::CIS",
