P. COLABAWALLA, J.\n\n RESERVED ON : DECEMBER 07, 2018.\n PRONOUNCED ON : JANUARY 03, 2019.\n\nJUDGMENT [ PER B. P. COLABAWALLA J. ]:\n\n1. By these two Arbitration Petitions filed under \nSection\n\n37\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short the\n\n\"\nArbitration Act\n\"), the Petitioners challenge the order dated 4th\n\nJuly, 2018 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 17\n of the\n\nArbitration Act (for short the \"impugned order\"). By the\n\nimpugned order, pending the hearing and final disposal of the\n\narbitration proceedings, and as an interim measure, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal directed the Petitioners in both Petitions to jointly and\n\nseverally deposit an amount of Rs.190 Crores, or in the alternative\n\nAswale 4/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nto provide a bank guarantee for the said amount, and deposit the\n\nsame with the Tribunal within a period of four weeks from the date\n\nof the impugned order. In addition to the aforesaid direction, the\n\nArbitral Tribunal also restrained the Petitioners in Arbitration\n\nPetition No. 913 of 2018 (Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal) from selling, transferring, alienating, disposing\n\nof and / or encumbering their interests (legal, beneficial and/or\n\neconomic) in any and all the properties of the Petitioners\n\n(Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 before the Arbitral Tribunal) where ever\n\nlocated in India or outside, other than in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness, including the properties as listed in Schedule-I to the\n\nsection 17\n application. A similar relief was also granted against\n\nthe Petitioners in Arbitration Petition No. 939 of 2018\n\n(Respondent Nos.5, 6 and 7 before the Arbitral Tribunal). It is\n\nbeing aggrieved by this order, that the present Petitions have been\n\nfiled.\n\n2. Since both the Arbitration Petitions challenge the\n\nsame order, they are being disposed of by this common judgment.\n\nRespondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 in both these Petitions were the\n\nClaimants before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Petitioners in\n\nAswale 5/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nArbitration Petition No. 913 of 2018 were Respondent Nos.1, 2, 3\n\nand 4 before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Petitioners in Arbitration\n\nPetition No. 939 of 2018 were Respondent Nos.5, 6 and 7 before\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. For the sake of convenience and ease of\n\nreference, I shall hereafter refer to the parties as they were\n\narrayed before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n3. Before setting out and dealing with the legal\n\nsubmissions of the parties, it would be necessary to set out a few\n\nfacts. The Claimants are investors in the Respondent No.3\n\ncompany (Maharana Infrastructure and Professional Services\n\nLimited) with the aggregate value of their investment being about\n\nRs.190 Crores. This investment was in the form of the Claimants\n\nholding equity shares of the Respondent No.3 company to the\n\nextent of Rs.41.37%. The rest of the shares of Respondent No.3\n\nare held by Respondent Nos.1 and 2 (who are the promoters) and\n\ntwo others.\n\n4. This investment of Rs.190 Crores was made by the\n\nClaimants in different tranches and at different points of time.\n\nThe inter-se terms of this investment and the rules of the\n\nAswale 6/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ninvestors are governed by the Share Holders Agreement dated\n\n27th December, 2012 and thereafter supplemented by a\n\nsupplementary Share Holders Agreement dated 30th July, 2014\n\nand thereafter further amended by the amendment Agreements\n\ndated 29th August, 2014 and 13th November, 2014 respectively.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, all these agreements shall hereafter\n\nbe collectively referred to as the \"SHA\".\n\n5. Clause 17.3 of the SHA dated 27th December, 2012\n\ncontains an arbitration clause. Clause 17.2 provides that in case\n\nof any dispute arising between the parties with regard to the\n\nsubject matter of the agreement, the disputing parties shall in the\n\nfirst instance attempt to resolve it, failing which any disputing\n\nparty may submit a claim to be settled by arbitration.\n\n6. Pursuant to Clause 17.3 of the said Agreement, the\n\nClaimants by their notice dated 2nd August, 2017 invoked\n\narbitration against the Respondents. I must mention here that\n\nRespondent Nos.1 to 3 are signatories to the arbitration\n\nagreement whereas Respondent Nos. 4 to 7 are not signatories.\n\nBefore the Arbitral Tribunal, it was the case of the Claimants that\n\nAswale 7/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nRespondent Nos.4 to 7 are equally bound by the arbitration\n\nagreement, inter alia, by reason of their status of being \"group\n\nentities\" of Respondent No.3 and also by reason of they being the\n\n\"alter ego\" of Respondent Nos. 1 to 3. It is on this basis that the\n\nClaimants invoked the arbitration proceedings against all the\n\nRespondents and also filed a Petition under \nSection 9\n of the\n\nArbitration Act for interim reliefs, pending the constitution of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal.\n\n7. Suffice it to state that the dispute ultimately landed up\n\nin the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court by its order dated 1st\n\nDecember, 2017 [passed in Arbitration Petition (Civil) No. 39 of\n\n2017 with Arbitration Petition Nos. 41, 40 and 45 of 2017]\n\nreferred the disputes to the Arbitral Tribunal and directed that\n\nthe question as to whether the alleged non-signatories to the\n\nagreement (Respondent Nos. 4 to 7) are to be parties in the\n\narbitral proceedings would be decided by the Arbitrator. Once this\n\norder was passed by the Supreme Court, this Court by its order\n\ndated 14th December, 2017 (Kathawalla, J.), directed that the\n\nPetition filed under \nSection 9\n of the Arbitration Act be treated as\n\nan application under \nSection 17\n and be decided by the Arbitral\n\nAswale 8/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nTribunal. That is how the Arbitral Tribunal decided the\n\napplication under \nSection 17\n in which the impugned order was\n\npassed.\n\n8. The application under \nSection 17\n was made broadly on\n\nthe ground that the Claimants were apprehensive that their\n\ninvestments were unsafe on account of certain activities alleged\n\nagainst the Respondents. The Claimants also alleged that their\n\nrights under the SHA have not been allowed to be exercised and\n\nthe SHA permitted the Claimants to unconditionally exit from\n\nRespondent No.3 on account of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) not\n\nhaving fructified by the deadline of 31st March, 2013. For this\n\npurpose, the Claimants placed reliance on Clause No. 8.1 of the\n\nSHA and submitted that the said Clause inter alia provided that\n\nRespondent Nos.1 and 2 or Respondent No.3 itself was required to\n\npurchase the equity shares that the Claimants held in Respondent\n\nNo.3 at a value to be determined in accordance with Clause 8.5 of\n\nthe SHA. This is the fundamental and basic dispute which the\n\nClaimants raised against the Respondents in the arbitration\n\nproceedings.\n\nAswale 9/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n9. In the arbitration proceedings, the Claimants valued\n\ntheir equity shareholding in Respondent No.3 at approximately\n\nRs. 590 Crores as per the valuation report dated 22nd April, 2017\n\nmade by Deloitte Haskins and Sells LLP. It is to secure this claim\n\nthat the \nSection 9\n Petition was filed and which was thereafter\n\nconverted into an application under \nSection 17\n of the Arbitration\n\nAct.\n\n10. The \nSection 17\n application was basically based on the\n\nallegations that the conduct of the Respondents show that they\n\nhave been siphoning monies from Respondent No.3 company to\n\nRespondent No.5 (Society) which has thereafter been diverted to\n\nthe promoters (Respondent Nos.1 and 2) or entities controlled by\n\nthem. It was the allegation of the Claimants that Respondent\n\nNos.5 to 7 are affiliated societies and related parties to the\n\npromoters (Respondent Nos.1 and 2). In turn, Respondent No.3\n\n(and which runs educational and infrastructural development\n\nservices to affiliated societies, including Respondent No.5),\n\nentered into a Master Services Agreement dated 29th March, 2011\n\nas amended by another agreement dated 8th January, 2013 with\n\nRespondent No.5. Similar Master Services Agreements were also\n\nentered into by Respondent No.3 with Respondent Nos. 6 and 7.\n\nAswale 10/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n11. It is the case of the Claimants that under the Master\n\nServices Agreement, for consideration of exclusivity and as a\n\nperformance guarantee, a security deposit of Rs. 20 Crores was to\n\nbe deposited by Respondent No.3 with Respondent No.5. It is the\n\nspecific case of the Claimants that during the financial years\n\n2012-13 and 2013-14, Respondent No.3 did exceedingly well. On\n\naccount of this, the Claimants did not object to higher security\n\ndeposits of Rs.184.86 Crores being placed by Respondent No.3\n\nwith Respondent No.5 even though it was much higher than what\n\nwas contemplated originally under the Master Services\n\nAgreement.\n\n12. However, according to the Claimants, during the\n\nfinancial year 2014-15, the Claimants discovered that the\n\nfinancials of Respondent No.3 as represented to them, were\n\ncompletely false and misleading and that the audited financials of\n\nRespondent No.3 for the financial year 2014-15 were significantly\n\nless than the provisional financial statements forwarded to the\n\nClaimants for the said financial year. In these circumstances, the\n\nClaimants questioned any further security deposits being placed\n\nAswale 11/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nby Respondent No.3 with the other Respondents. However,\n\nwithout the knowledge and consent of the Claimants, Respondent\n\nNo.3 placed further security deposits of Rs.92.48 Crores with\n\nRespondent No.5 in financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16. It is in\n\nview of this conduct of the Respondents and considering that the\n\nClaimants were kept in the dark, they engaged the services of\n\nPrice Water House Coopers Private Limited (for short \"PWC\") to\n\ncarry out a forensic review of Respondent No. 3's financial status.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, PWC provided its findings on 10th\n\nApril, 2017 which corroborated the suspicions of the Claimants\n\nthat there was large scale siphoning of monies from Respondent\n\nNo.3 which were first diverted to Respondent No.5 and ultimately\n\ndissipated to the promoters and other related parties/entities.\n\n13. It is the case of the Claimants that in addition to the\n\ninstances of siphoning monies from Respondent No.3, the\n\nClaimants found that there were various other fundamental\n\nbreaches of the SHA. For instance, the holding of the 7th AGM of\n\nthe Respondent No.3 company was without notice to the\n\nClaimants and several affairs of Respondent No.3 were being\n\nconducted in breach of the Claimants' affirmative voting rights.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their affirmative voting rights have\n\nAswale 12/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nbeen deliberately and systematically denied by Respondent No.3\n\nand its promoters so much so that even the statutory right of\n\ninspection of the books of accounts was denied to the Claimants for\n\na long period of time. To put it in a nutshell, in view of all this, the\n\nClaimants ultimately filed a Petition under \nSection 9\n of the\n\nArbitration Act before this Court and which was then converted\n\ninto an application under \nSection 17\n to be considered by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal.\n\n14. This application under \nSection 17\n before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal was opposed by Respondent Nos.1 to 3 by filing their\n\naffidavit. The crux of the case made out therein was that, there\n\nwas no breach of the terms of the SHA by the Respondents; that\n\nthe IPO could not fructify in time because of the defaults on the\n\npart of the Claimants; that all dealings between Respondent Nos.1\n\nto 3 and Respondent Nos.5 to 7 were on a Arms Length Basis; that\n\nthe deposits were correctly given by Respondent No.3 to\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7 under the terms of the SHA read with the\n\nMaster Services Agreement; and that the forensic report\n\nsubmitted by PWC was one sided and could not be relied upon. To\n\nput it in a nutshell in substance Respondent Nos.1 and 3 denied\n\nthat there was any justification for making any interim orders as\n\nAswale 13/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nprayed for.\n\n15. Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 also filed an affidavit taking up\n\nthe stand that the arbitration proceedings and any applications\n\nmade therein were not tenable against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 as\n\nthere was no contractual privity nor any arbitration agreement\n\nbetween any of the Claimants and Respondent Nos.5 to 7. It was\n\ncontended that the \nSection 17\n application was not sustainable\n\nagainst Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 and further contended that in any\n\nevent all the transactions had taken place on an Armed Length\n\nBasis, as was evident from the facts on record. In the result,\n\nRespondent Nos.5 to 7 prayed for rejecting the application for any\n\nreliefs against them.\n\n16. When the application under \nSection 17\n was taken up\n\nby the Arbitral Tribunal on 12th February, 2018, the learned\n\ncounsel appearing on behalf of Respondent Nos.1 to 4 stated that\n\nalthough the statement of claim had been filed on 1st February,\n\n2018, the Written Statement of Respondent Nos.1 to 4 was\n\nrequired to be filed by 15th March, 2018. It was therefore\n\nrequested that it would be more appropriate if the \nSection 17\n\napplication is heard after the Written Statement has been taken on\n\nAswale 14/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nrecord as Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 would not be able to bring any of\n\nthe factual details before said date. Similarly, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 submitted that in\n\nthe reply filed to the \nSection 9\n Petition (and which was now\n\nconverted into \nSection 17\n application) they had merely objected to\n\nbeing made parties and they had no opportunity of dealing with\n\nthe factual aspects pleaded in the Petition.\n\n17. Taking all this into consideration, by an order dated\n\n12th February, 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the Claimants\n\nto make their submissions on all points of facts and law including\n\nthe issue as to whether Respondent Nos.5 to 7 could be made\n\nparties to the arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal also directed\n\nthat by a short speaking order, the Tribunal would indicate\n\nwhether Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 have been properly made parties,\n\nand if so, they would be given an opportunity for dealing with the\n\nfactual averments made in the application under \nSection 17\n before\n\nbeing called upon to make any submissions. It is in these\n\ncircumstances that the application under \nSection 17\n was heard on\n\n12th February, 2018 and 13th February, 2018 during the course of\n\nwhich the Claimants made their submissions on facts and law\n\nAswale 15/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nincluding the question as to whether the arbitration proceedings\n\ncould be tenable against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 and who were not\n\nsignatories to the arbitration agreement. The matter was\n\nthereafter posted for further hearing on 22nd and 23rd March,\n\n2018.\n\n18. On 22nd March, 2018, the Claimants concluded their\n\nsubmissions. Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 made their submissions on\n\nthe tenability of the proceedings which were thereafter continued\n\non 23rd March, 2018. At that stage and once those submissions\n\nwere completed, the Tribunal took the view that Respondent Nos.\n\n5 to 7 were necessary parties, although no reasons were adduced\n\nfor the decision at that stage in view of the directions already\n\ngiven in the order dated 12th February, 2018, namely, that the\n\nreasons would be contained in the final order disposing of the\n\napplication under \nSection 17\n to the \nArbitration Act\n. Hence,\n\nfurther proceedings were fixed on 24th and 25th April, 2018.\n\n19. On 24th April, 2018, three applications were made for\n\nadjournment. On the said date, the Tribunal passed a detailed\n\norder indicating tortuous course of the proceedings and why the\n\nmatters would not be adjourned as requested. One of the\n\nAswale 16/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\napplications reiterated the following preliminary objections and\n\nrequested the Tribunal to decide them as preliminary issues. They\n\nwere as under:-\n\n \"Issue No.1: Whether the Hon'ble Sole Arbitrator has jurisdiction to\n decide this dispute in view of the bar under \nSecs.241\n, \n242\n and \n430\n of the\n Company's Act, 2013?\n\n Issue No.2: Whether the Hon'ble Sole Arbitrator can without first\n disclosing the reasons for holding that it is necessary that \"the\n Respondent Nos.5 to 7 are made parties to the present proceedings hear\n on merits the interim application under \nSec.17\n of the Act?\n\n Issue No.3: Whether the preliminary issue set-forth at Issue No.1 above\n is required to be disposed of first before the interim application under\n \nSec.17\n of the Act can be heard?\"\n\n20. In view of the fact that Respondent No.3 repeatedly\n\nasked for adjournment on one ground or the another, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal passed an ad-interim order on 24th April, 2018 and\n\ncancelled the hearing fixed on 25th April, 2018 and adjourned the\n\nhearing of the application on 7th and 8th May, 2018. Submissions\n\non behalf of all the Respondents were started on 7th May, 2018\n\nand completed on 8th May, 2018. The Claimants also completed\n\ntheir submissions in rejoinder on the said date. It is thereafter\n\nthat the impugned order came to be passed on 4th July, 2018.\n\n21. On going through the impugned order, I find that the\n\nAswale 17/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\npreliminary issues raised by the Respondents and as set out by me\n\nearlier are dealt with by the Arbitral Tribunal in great detail from\n\nparagraphs 16 to 37 thereof (pages 52 to 80 of the paper book).\n\n22. To put it in a nutshell, on Issue No.1 regarding\n\njurisdiction to decide the dispute in view of the bar under \nSections\n\n241\n, \n242\n and \n430\n of the Companies Act, 2013, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, after discussing the law on the subject, inter alia came to\n\nthe conclusion that the arbitration proceedings were not one\n\nwhich would legitimately fall within the purview of \nSections 241\n,\n\n242\n and \n271\n of the Companies Act, 2013 nor was it a matter\n\nwhich would fall exclusively within the special jurisdiction of the\n\nNCLT. The Tribunal took the view that the dispute referred to it\n\nwas a purely contractual dispute which could very well be\n\nentertained and adjudicated by a Civil Court / Arbitral Forum. It is\n\nfor this reason it overruled the first preliminary issue. Issue No.2\n\nregarding the joinder of Respondent Nos.5 to 7 to the arbitration,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal, by applying the principles laid down in the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of \nChloro Controls India\n\nPvt Ltd v/s Severn Trent Water Purification Inc.\n [(2013) 1\n\nSCC 641], came to the conclusion that it had jurisdiction to decide\n\nthe claims made against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7. In view of the\n\nAswale 18/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nfindings of the Tribunal with reference to Issue No.1, Issue No.3\n\nand as reproduced by me earlier did not survive.\n\n23. I must mention here that Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 also\n\ncontended that they being societies registered under the \nSocieties\n\nRegistration Act, 1860\n, were not sued in the name of the\n\nconcerned office bearers identified and determined as per the\n\nrespective Rules and Regulations, and hence the proceedings\n\nagainst them were not tenable. This argument was also negated\n\nby the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n24. Thereafter, from paragraph 38 onwards, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal examined the merits of the matter and whether the\n\nClaimants had made out a prima facie case for grant of interim\n\nreliefs under \nSection 17\n of the Arbitration Act. This discussion of\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal can be found from paragraphs 38 to 47 of the\n\nimpugned order (pages 80 to 94 of the paper book). While\n\nexamining the merits of the matter, the Arbitral Tribunal placed\n\nreliance on the PWC report and the submissions made in relation\n\nthereto. The Claimants alleged that the PWC report was prepared\n\nprincipally on the Respondents' own documents which were\n\nforwarded by the Respondents to the Claimants, and therefore, the\n\nAswale 19/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nsaid report was eminently reliable. They submitted that the only\n\nreply given by the Respondents to the said PWC report was that\n\nthe same was bogus, inequitable and unilateral. Apart from this\n\nvague and bald denial, no attempt was made by the Respondents\n\nto impugn the findings in the said PWC report on any rational\n\nground. In a nutshell, it was the case of the Claimants that apart\n\nfrom merely stating that the PWC report was bogus, inequitable\n\nand unilateral, there was absolutely no explanation given or\n\nreasons stated as to why the said report, at least at the prima facie\n\nstage, could not be relied upon. As far the contents of the PWC\n\nreport are concerned, the Claimants highlighted the following\n\nfacts in support of their case for grant of interim reliefs:-\n\n i. The audited financial statements of the financial\n year 2014-2015 was shared with Claimant No.3\n on 17th March 2016 and exhibited a significant\n decline in the profit and revenues when\n compared with the provisional financial\n statements for the said period which had been\n sent to the Claimants and which showed\n Respondent No.3 to be quite profitable and\n growing. The difference between the provisional\n financial statement and the audited financial\n statement were quite stark and worrying.\n\nAswale 20/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n ii. Though the Claimants disputed the audited\n financial statements for financial year 2014-\n\n 2015, they were purportedly adopted at an AGM\n of Respondent No.3 convened on 29th\n December, 2015 and it is the case of the\n Claimants that this AGM was held without notice\n to the Claimants in breach of Clause 6.8.2 of the\n S.H.A. and also in violation of \nSection 101\n of the\n Companies Act, 2013. Despite this allegation\n being made, the Respondents did not produce\n any proof of the notice of the said AGM having\n been served on the Claimants.\n\n iii. The PWC Forensic Review (paragraph 2.26)\n shows that approximately Rs.24 Crores were\n paid by Respondent No.5 (MPEC) to Respondent\n No.1 (Mr.Shailendra Bhaduria), his family\n members and a related party by the name\n \"Essbee Media Private Limited\". The only\n explanation given in the affidavit by Respondent\n Nos.1 to 3 in their affidavit in rejoinder dated\n 16th August 2018 is that the same was extended\n \"in the normal course of business\". Apart from\n this bare statement, there is no explanation as to\n what the normal course of business was that\n required such big payments to be made to\n Respondent No.1, his family members and\n\nAswale 21/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n related parties.\n\n iv. The PWC Review (vide paragraph 5.18) also\n shows that there is wide discrepancy between\n services provided by a service provider and the\n nature of services sought to have been availed by\n Respondent No.3 Company. For instance,\n Mahalaxmi Traders, a dealer of marble, is\n claimed to have given advertisement services to\n Respondent No.3 including media hoarding\n services. Similarly, Respondent No.3 claims to\n have availed of curriculum development and\n Rural Development related services from Core\n Vertical Trade Private Limited, when the said\n Company is a commission agent, commodity\n brokers and auctioneers.\n\n25. It was further contended by the Claimants that the\n\nbalance-sheets of Respondent No.5 for the Financial Years 2010 to\n\n2017 (and filed as Annexures to the reply affidavit dated 13th\n\nApril, 2018), revealed questionable advances/loans inter-se\n\nbetween the Respondents and escalation of deposit/security\n\namounts. Whilst the balance-sheet showed inter-party\n\ntransactions amongst the Respondents being negligible in the\n\nFinancial Year 2010-11, they had drastically increased after the\n\nAswale 22/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nClaimants' investment in Respondent No.3. This, according to the\n\nClaimants, at least prima facie indicated an attempt to\n\ndivert/diversify the finances. The Claimants also pointed out\n\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal (from balance-sheet of Respondent\n\nNo.5), the inter-party/related party transactions which were\n\nseriously questioned. They were:-\n\n i. Respondent No.1 (Shailendra Bhaduria)\n advanced an unsecured loan to Respondent No.5\n in Financial Year 2010-11 of an amount of\n Rs.1,45,448/- which came down to Rs.45,448/ -\n\n in Financial Year 2011-12. Subsequently,\n approximately an amount of Rs.11 Crores\n appears to have been extended by Respondent\n No.5 to Respondent No.1 for which there is no\n explanation except a bare statement that the\n same \"were duly accounted for on production of\n end-utilization production bills\". No other\n material has been placed on record from which\n the appropriateness of the transaction can be\n examined.\n\n ii. Advances have been made by Respondent No.5\n to other Respondents and their family members\n as seen from the following instances:\n\nAswale 23/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n (a) Respondent No.2 (Mrs.Surabhi Bhaduria)\n was advanced an amount of\n Rs.1,49,44,349.72 by Respondent No.5 for\n the first time in Financial Year 2012-13.\n\n This declined sharply in Financial Year\n 2013-14 and then increased once again\n approximately to Rs.76 lakhs in Financial\n Year 2014-15.\n\n (b) Respondent No.1 received an advance of\n approximately Rs.10 crores in Financial\n Year 2014-15 which is seen to have\n increased to Rs.11.03 crores in Financial\n Year 2015-16.\n\n (c) Respondent No.1 (Shailendra Bhaduria)\n and his family members along with\n Respondent No.2 were advanced amounts\n of approximately Rs.13 crores in Financial\n Year 2016-1 7.\n\n iii. For the Financial Year 2016-17 (as on 31st\n March 2017) as seen from the balance sheet\n dated 23rd October 2017, advances by\n Respondent No.5 to the family members of\n Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.3 have\n completely vanished from the balance sheet\n without any plausible explanation or\n\nAswale 24/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n justification.\n\n iv. That there were inter-party/ related party\n transactions with Respondent No.3 which\n appeared to be doubtful and suspicious. In\n Financial Year 2013-14, Respondent No.3\n Company is shown as a creditor of Respondent\n No.5 to the extent of Rs.17 crores and that the\n said amount is shown under the head \"Unsecured\n Loans\" and to the extent of Rs.33.7 crores under\n the heading ''Sundry Creditors\". Respondent\n No.3 seems to have further extended credit of\n Rs.75 crores in addition to the deposit of Rs.267\n crores as on 31st March 2015. Suddenly, the\n credit from Respondent No.3 to Respondent No.5\n was reduced by Rs.75 crores in the previous\n years to Rs.17 crores in Financial year 2015-16.\n\n There is no explanation as to whether\n Respondent No.5 has repaid the amount of Rs.58\n crores and in what manner. Despite being\n shareholders of Respondent No.3 Company, the\n Claimants are kept completely in the dark on this\n issue.\n\n v. In the Financial Year 2015-16, Respondent No.5\n had advanced Rs.10,54,11,057/- to 'Advance\n Medical Science & Educational Society', of which\n Respondent No.1 and Respondent no.2 are the\n\nAswale 25/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:25 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n Chairman and Secretary respectively. In\n Financial Year 2016-17, the advances\n outstanding to the said Society were\n Rs.5,92,17,293/-, but there is no information as\n to how the repayment had been done. Nothing is\n discernible from the balance sheet of Respondent\n No.5.\n\n vi. That the said 'Advance Medical Science &\n Education Society' has been debarred by the\n Ministry of Health & Family Welfare from\n accepting students for academic year 2017-18\n and 2018-19 on account of various deficiencies\n in faculty, residents, clinical material and\n infrastructure. The Writ Petition filed by the said\n Society is disposed of without any relief being\n granted to the Society on the question of\n admitting students in the academic year 2017-\n\n 18. In these circumstances, the Claimants\n impugn the large amounts of advances given to\n 'Advance Medical Science & Educational Society'\n as wholly doubtful and suspicious.\n\n vii. In Financial Year 2015-16, approximately\n Rs.24.74 crores were advanced by Respondent\n No.5 to Essbee Media Private Limited (related\n party of the Respondents) and security deposits\n of Rs.6.19 crores were also advanced in the same\n year. Although Essbee Media Private Limited\n\nAswale 26/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n provides printing and publishing services to\n Respondent No.3, Respondent No.3 has availed\n curriculum development services from Essbee\n Media Private Limited. There is inconsistency in\n the nature of services availed and the nature of\n services available from Essbee Media Private\n Limited, according to the Claimants.\n\n viii. Mahalaxmi Traders is a related party of the\n Respondents. This entity first received an\n advance of Rs.35 Lakhs from Respondent No.5 in\n Financial Year 2011-12. The amount of advance\n stood increased to Rs.70 lakhs in Financial year\n 2012-13. For the first time in Financial Year\n 2013-14, Mahalaxmi Traders is reflected in the\n balance sheet of Respondent No.5 as a \"Sundry\n Creditor\" to the extent of Rs.3.06 crores. The\n credit advance to Mahalaxmi Traders increased\n in subsequent years to Rs.8 crores in the\n Financial Year 2014-15 and further to Rs.13.16\n crores in the Financial Year 2015-16.\n\n26. It is on the basis of all these instances and factors that\n\nthe Claimants alleged that there was diversion of funds invested\n\nby the Claimants in Respondent No.3 and also round tripping of\n\nmoney into the pockets of Respondent Nos.1 and 2 and other\n\nAswale 27/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nfamily members. The facts as set out above were not disputed\n\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph\n\n44 clearly records that despite all these serious allegations, apart\n\nfrom a bare denial and characterization of the PWC report as\n\nbogus and one sided, there was no serious attempt made to meet\n\nwith the serious allegations made by the Claimants. The Tribunal\n\nfurther recorded that even during the submissions made before\n\nthe Tribunal, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nRespondent Nos.1 to 3 did not make any submissions with regard\n\nto the material allegations against them. The only attempt made\n\nwas to contend that the Claims and the application were beyond\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and therefore, no relief could be\n\ngranted. What is important to note is that it is nobody's case that\n\nthis recording of the Arbitral Tribunal is an incorrect recording in\n\nthe impugned order.\n\n27. Be that as it may, the Arbitral Tribunal, upon a\n\nconsideration of the material on record was prima facie satisfied\n\nthat the Claimants had made out a case for grant of interim reliefs\n\nas prayed for and thereafter proceeded to pass the impugned\n\norder. As mentioned earlier, by the impugned order, the Tribunal\n\nAswale 28/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ndirected the Respondents to jointly and severally deposit an\n\namount of Rs.190 Crores or in the alternative to provide a bank\n\nguarantee for the said amount. In addition thereto, the\n\nRespondents were also restrained from alienating, transferring,\n\ndisposing of and/or encumbering any of their properties. It is this\n\norder that is challenged before me under \nSection 37\n of the\n\nArbitration Act.\n\n28. At the outset, Mr. Jagtiani, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the Claimants (Respondent Nos.1 to 3 in\n\nboth Petitions), submitted that paragraphs 13 to 37 of the\n\nimpugned order deal with preliminary issues that were framed by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal as to whether the proceedings before it were\n\ntenable and whether it had jurisdiction to entertain the arbitration\n\nproceedings. All these questions were answered in favour of the\n\nClaimants and all the objections with reference to jurisdiction\n\nwere overruled by the Arbitral Tribunal. This being the case, Mr.\n\nJagtiani raised a preliminary objection that the findings given by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal on jurisdictional issues cannot be challenged\n\nat this stage and can be challenged only once the final award is\n\npassed and if the same is adverse the Respondents. In this regard\n\nAswale 29/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nhe brought to my attention the provisions of \nSection 16\n of the\n\nArbitration Act. He, therefore, submitted that all the Respondents\n\nto the arbitration can only challenge the impugned order insofar\n\nas it relates to the merits of the case.\n\n29. On the other hand, Mr. Kamdar, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of Respondent Nos.1 to 4 (Petitioners in\n\nArbitration Petition No.913 of 2018), submitted that Respondent\n\nNos.1 to 4 had not filed any application under \nSection 16\n before\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal, and therefore, there was no occasion for the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to consider the aforesaid jurisdictional issues.\n\nThe findings given by the Arbitral Tribunal were only prima facie\n\nin nature to consider whether reliefs can be granted to the\n\nClaimants or otherwise. He submitted that if they are prima facie\n\nin nature, those prima facie findings can certainly be challenged\n\nand to show that even prima facie the Arbitral Tribunal had gone\n\nwrong in coming to the conclusion that it could entertain the claim\n\nfiled by the Claimants.\n\n30. As far as Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 are concerned, Mr.\n\nSamdani, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the said\n\nAswale 30/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nRespondents, very fairly stated before me that they had raised\n\nthese jurisdictional issues before the Arbitral Tribunal which were\n\ndecided by the Arbitral Tribunal in the impugned order, and\n\ntherefore, Respondent Nos.5 to 7 are not challenging the findings\n\nof the Arbitral Tribunal on the jurisdictional issues at this stage\n\nand they would challenge the same if and when Respondent Nos. 5\n\nto 7 suffer an Award and the same is challenged under \nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n31. I will deal with this issue first. \nSection 16\n of the\n\nArbitration Act deals with the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nto rule on its own jurisdiction. \nSection 16\n reads thus:-\n\n \"16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.--\n\n (1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling\n on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration\n agreement, and for that purpose,--\n\n (a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be\n treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the\n contract; and\n\n (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and\n void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\n\n (2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be\n raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; however,\n a party shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because\n that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.\n\n (3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority\n shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its\n\nAswale 31/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.\n\n (4) The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in sub-\n\n section (2) or sub-section (3), admit a later plea if it considers the delay\n justified.\n\n (5) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to in sub-section\n (2) or sub-section (3) and, where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision\n rejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an\n arbitral award.\n\n (6) A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application\n for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with \nsection 34\n.\"\n\n32. \nSection 16(1)\n provides that the Arbitral Tribunal can\n\nrule on its own jurisdiction including ruling on any objections with\n\nrespect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.\n\nFor that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a\n\ncontract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other\n\nterms of the contract. \nSection 16(1)\n further provides that a\n\ndecision by the Arbitral Tribunal that the contract is null and void\n\nshall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\n\nSub-section (2) of \nSection 16\n stipulates that a plea that the\n\nArbitral Tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not\n\nlater than the submission of the statement of defence. However, a\n\nparty shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely\n\nbecause that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment\n\nof an arbitrator. \nSection 16(3)\n deals with a plea about the Arbitral\n\nAswale 32/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nTribunal exceeding the scope of its authority and stipulates that\n\nsuch a plea shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be\n\nbeyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral\n\nproceedings. Sub-section (4) of \nSection 16\n gives discretion to the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to admit a plea regarding its jurisdiction or\n\nauthority even at a later stage than the one referred to in sub-\n\nsection (2) or sub-section (3), if it considers that the delay is\n\njustified. Sub-section (5) stipulates that when the Arbitral\n\nTribunal decides on a plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-\n\nsection (3) and it takes a decision rejecting such a plea, it shall\n\ncontinue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral\n\naward. In other words, what sub-section (5) of \nSection 16\n\nstipulates is that when a jurisdictional issue is raised before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal and the Arbitral Tribunal rules that it has\n\njurisdiction, then, the arbitral proceedings would continue until\n\nthey culminate into an arbitral Award. The plea of jurisdiction,\n\nwhen rejected, cannot be challenged before the Court at that stage.\n\nIt can only be challenged when the final Award is challenged\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act. This is clear from an ex-\n\nfacie reading of \nSection 16(6)\n. This becomes further clear when\n\none reads \nSection 16\n with \nSection 34\n and \nSection 37\n of the\n\nAswale 33/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nArbitration Act\n. In fact, \nSection 37\n, and which deals with\n\nappealable orders clearly stipulates that an Appeal shall lie from\n\nthe orders as mentioned therein (and from no others). \nSection\n\n37(2)(a)\n specifically stipulates that an Appeal shall lie to a Court\n\nfrom an order of the Arbitral Tribunal accepting the plea referred\n\nin sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of \nSection 16\n. In other words,\n\nwhat \nSection 37(2)(a)\n stipulates is that where the Arbitral\n\nTribunal rules that it has no jurisdiction or that the dispute before\n\nit exceeds the scope of its authority, then, an Appeal shall lie from\n\nsuch an order of the Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 37\n of the\n\nArbitration Act. However, if such pleas are rejected by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal, then, no Appeal would lie under \nSection 37\n of\n\nthe Arbitration Act. The rejection of such a plea then can only be\n\nchallenged when the arbitral award is challenged under \nsection 34\n\nof the Act. This position is very clear on an ex-facie reading of\n\nSections 16\n, \n34\n and \n37\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n33. Having said this, we shall now examine the\n\npreliminary issues raised before the Arbitral Tribunal and which\n\nhave been reproduced by me earlier. As recorded in the impugned\n\norder itself, that one of the applications filed by Respondent Nos. 5\n\nAswale 34/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nto 7 reiterated the preliminary objections and requested the\n\nTribunal to decide them as preliminary issues. Issue No.1 was\n\nwhether the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the\n\ndispute in view of the bar under Sections 241, 242 as well as other\n\nprovisions of the \nCompanies Act, 2013\n. As far this issue is\n\nconcerned, the Arbitral Tribunal has ruled that it has the\n\njurisdiction to decide the dispute. As mentioned earlier, the\n\nfindings on this issue can be found in paragraphs 19 to 26 of the\n\nimpugned order. Since the Arbitral Tribunal has ruled that it has\n\nthe jurisdiction to decide the dispute, in my view, the findings\n\ngiven with reference to this issue cannot be subjected to an Appeal\n\nunder \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act at this stage. The\n\nRespondents will always be at liberty to challenge the findings on\n\nthis issue, if they suffer an Award adverse to them and the same is\n\nchallenged under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n34. As far as Issue No.2 is concerned, the said issue was\n\nwith reference to Respondent Nos.5 to 7 being made parties to the\n\narbitration proceedings. This issue categorically called upon the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to disclose the reasons for holding that\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7 are necessary parties to the present\n\nAswale 35/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nproceedings before hearing the interim application under \nSection\n\n17\n of the Arbitration Act on merits. In other words, what this\n\nissue called upon the Arbitral Tribunal to decide was that whether\n\nit had jurisdiction to pass any orders against Respondent Nos. 5 to\n\n7 especially considering that they were not signatories to the\n\narbitration agreement. This issue also was decided by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal and it came to the conclusion that it had jurisdiction even\n\nover Respondent Nos. 5 to 7. It came to this conclusion by relying\n\nupon the principles \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nChloro Controls India Pvt Ltd\n (supra). The Arbitral Tribunal,\n\nhaving come to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction over\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7, the findings on this issue also cannot be\n\nchallenged in an Appeal under \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\nThese findings can be challenged by the concerned Respondents, if\n\nthey ultimately suffer an Award adverse to them and the same is\n\nchallenged under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act. I must\n\nmention here that as a part of Issue No.2, an issue was also raised\n\nwhether the proceedings against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 would lie\n\nin view of the fact that they were societies registered under the\n\nSocieties Registration Act, 1860\n and they had not been sued in the\n\nname of the concerned office bearers identified and determined as\n\nAswale 36/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nper the respective Rules and Regulations. This plea of Respondent\n\nNo.5 to 7 was also rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal. Hence, even\n\nthe findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on this issue cannot be\n\nchallenged at this stage and can be challenged if the concerned\n\nRespondents ultimately suffer an Award and which is challenged\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n35. As far as Issue No.3 is concerned, it called upon the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to decide Issue No.1 first, before deciding the\n\nsection 17\n application. Accordingly, Issue No.1 was decided by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal inter alia holding that the dispute between the\n\nparties was a purely contractual dispute which could be decided\n\nby a Civil Court / Arbitral Tribunal. It would not be one which\n\nwould legitimately fall within the purview of Sections 241, 242\n\nand other provisions of the \nCompanies Act, 2013\n nor was it a\n\nmatter which would fall exclusively within the special jurisdiction\n\nof the NCLT. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore held that it had\n\njurisdiction to decide the dispute between the Claimants and the\n\nRespondents. It was thereafter that the \nsection 17\n application\n\nwas decided on merits, namely, whether the Claimants had made\n\nout a prima facie case for grant of interim reliefs. This being the\n\nAswale 37/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ncase, the Respondents could have no grievance because Issue No.1\n\nwas decided first and thereafter the Arbitral Tribunal decided the\n\nsection 17\n application, albeit the reasons on all jurisdictional\n\nissues were given in the impugned order.\n\n36. Looking to all these facts, it is clear that all the\n\npreliminary issues that the Arbitral Tribunal was called upon to\n\ndecide were touching the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThese issues have been decided by the Arbitral Tribunal by giving\n\ndetailed reasons, albeit in the same order that decides the \nSection\n\n17\n application. In fact, this was also made clear to the parties by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal vide its order passed on 12th February,\n\n2018. In this order, the Tribunal directed the Claimants to make\n\ntheir submissions on all points of facts and law including the\n\njurisdictional issues. The Tribunal also directed that it would\n\nindicate whether Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 were necessary and\n\nproper parties and if so, they would be given an opportunity for\n\ndealing with the factual averments made in the \nSection 17\n\napplication before being called upon to make their submissions. It\n\nis in these circumstances that the reasons on the jurisdictional\n\nissues have been set forth by the Arbitral Tribunal in the\n\nAswale 38/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nimpugned order which also decides whether the Claimants are\n\nentitled to any interim reliefs under \nSection 17\n of the Arbitration\n\nAct. I, therefore, find that the objection raised by Mr. Jagtiani, the\n\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the Claimants, that I\n\ncannot give any finding on the jurisdictional issues at this stage, to\n\nbe well founded.\n\n37. I am unable to accept the submissions of Mr. Kamdar\n\nthat the findings given by the Arbitral Tribunal on these issues are\n\nonly prima facie, and therefore, I can look into these findings to\n\nexamine whether prima facie the Tribunal had jurisdiction or\n\notherwise. The Tribunal has taken its decision holding that it has\n\njurisdiction to decide the disputes between the parties and having\n\ndone so, these findings certainly cannot be challenged under\n\nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act at this stage. These findings, if at\n\nall, can be challenged by the Respondents if they suffer an Award\n\nadverse to them and the same is challenged under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Arbitration Act. I, therefore, find that the objection raised by\n\nMr. Jagtiani is fully justified and is required to be upheld.\n\n38. Having said this, I shall now turn my attention as to\n\nAswale 39/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nwhether the Claimants made out a prima facie case for grant of\n\nreliefs as prayed for in their \nSection 17\n application. In this regard,\n\nMr. Kamdar, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nRespondent Nos.1 to 4, submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had\n\ngone completely wrong in not only directing the Respondents to\n\ndeposit Rs. 190 Crores, but then further went on to grant an\n\ninjunction restraining all the Respondents from creating third\n\nparty rights and/or interests in all their properties, assets etc. He\n\nsubmitted that this could never have been done by the Tribunal\n\nconsidering the concession made by the Claimants as recorded in\n\nparagraph 46 of the impugned order. Mr. Kamdar submitted that\n\nparagraph 46 of the impugned order categorically records that\n\n\"the Applicants at this stage\" (namely, at the stage of the \nSection\n\n17\n application) would be satisfied if the actual amount of invested\n\nmoney was protected pending the further proceedings. Mr.\n\nKamdar submitted that it is an admitted position that the actual\n\namount invested by the Claimants was a sum of Rs. 190 Crores.\n\nThis being the position, the Tribunal could not have ordered\n\ndeposit of Rs.190 Crores and also granted the injunction, was the\n\nsubmission.\n\nAswale 40/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n39. Mr. Kamdar further submitted that an injunction of\n\nthe nature that was granted by the Arbitral Tribunal against all\n\nthe Respondents would hamper the entire business activity of the\n\nRespondents and would virtually bring it to a standstill. Merely\n\nbecause the Tribunal was of the opinion that the balance-sheets\n\nand the PWC report allegedly reveal questionable advances/loss\n\ninter-se between the Respondents and an escalation of the\n\ndeposit/security amounts from Respondent No.3 to Respondent\n\nNos.5 to 7, and that too without there being any material proof\n\nthat the transactions were questionable or doubtful or suspicious,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal could not have blindly accepted the\n\ncontention of the Claimants and thereafter pass the interim order\n\nas sought for by the Claimants. Mr. Kamdar submitted that\n\nthough the Tribunal has placed heavy reliance on the PWC report,\n\nand which was seriously disputed by the Respondents in their\n\nreply, the same clearly revealed that it was unilateral and a one\n\nsided report based on the material supplied by the Claimants to\n\nPWC. Mr. Kamdar further submitted that the PWC report is\n\npartisan report and at the highest is an unproven opinion of an\n\nexpert. This being the case, before any relief could be granted to\n\nthe Claimants, they had to make out an independent prima facie\n\nAswale 41/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ncase. In these circumstances, the Tribunal had completely gone\n\nwrong in placing heavy reliance on the PWC report, was the\n\nsubmission of Mr. Kamdar.\n\n40. Mr. Kamdar then submitted that the order for deposit\n\nand even the order of injunction did not meet the standards as set\n\nout under Order 38 or \nOrder 39 of the CPC\n to enable the Tribunal\n\nto pass such drastic interim orders. In this regard he took me\n\nthrough the averments in the Petition filed by the Claimants and\n\nsubmitted that no case was made out for granting such drastic\n\nreliefs. He submitted that all the balance-sheets of the company\n\nwere known to the Claimants and in fact all of them have been\n\nsigned by the Claimants. This being the case, and the Claimants\n\nbeing fully aware of all transactions, could not make any grievance\n\nthat they were kept in the dark or that the Respondents were\n\nacting in collusion with each other and behind the back of the\n\nClaimants to allegedly siphon away all the Claimants' investments.\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Kamdar relied upon Emails dated 8th August,\n\n2014 and 25th February, 2015 addressed by the Respondents to\n\nthe Claimants. These Emails form part of the compilation of\n\ndocuments that was tendered on behalf of Respondent Nos.1 to 4\n\nAswale 42/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nbefore me and is at pages 2482 and 2484 respectively. Relying\n\nupon these Emails, Mr. Kamdar submitted that this clearly\n\nshowed that the Claimants were in the full know of things\n\nincluding the deposits that were given by Respondent No.3 to\n\nRespondent No.5. He submitted that these Emails were\n\nsuppressed before the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore the\n\nClaimants had approached the Tribunal with unclean hands and\n\non this ground also the Claimants were not entitled to any relief\n\nwhatsoever.\n\n41. Mr. Kamdar then submitted that the claim in the\n\narbitration is nothing but a claim for damages and this being the\n\ncase, to secure such a claim, an order of deposit of Rs.190 Crores\n\ncould never have been made. This is more-so when one takes into\n\nconsideration that the Respondents are carrying on business of\n\nconducting educational institutions involving a large number of\n\nstudents, faculty and employees. This order of deposit would cause\n\na greater hardship to the Respondents than to the Claimants and\n\nwhich was completely lost sight of by the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr.\n\nKamdar further submitted that the SHA governs the inter-se\n\nrights between the parties to the said SHA and admittedly each of\n\nAswale 43/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nthe Claimants had entered into separate SHAs for the purpose of\n\ninvesting in the share capital of Respondent No.3. It was therefore\n\nsubmitted that the rights and liabilities of each of the Claimants\n\nand cause of action (if any), or entitlement to relief, was a\n\nseparate, distinct and an independent cause of action. Hence, the\n\nclaim made was also bad for misjoinder of parties and causes of\n\naction, was the submission.\n\n42. Mr. Kamdar then submitted that admittedly the\n\ntransactions between Respondent No.3 and Respondent Nos. 5, 6\n\nand 7 were of refundable security deposits and which was to the\n\nknowledge of the Claimants. This is clearly borne out even by the\n\naverments in the Petition filed seeking interim reliefs. Mr.\n\nKamdar submitted that even assuming that there were incorrect\n\nor fraudulent entries in the books of Respondent No.5, the same\n\ncould not be a ground for granting reliefs against Respondent\n\nNos.1 to 4. To put it differently Mr. Kamdar submitted that\n\nlooking into the books of accounts of Respondent Nos. 5 to 7, relief\n\ncould not be granted against Respondent Nos.1 to 4. He further\n\nsubmitted that what the Arbitral Tribunal had effectively done\n\nwas to pierce the corporate veil and thereafter proceeded to grant\n\nAswale 44/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nrelief. This could not be permitted and especially in arbitration\n\nproceedings, was the submission. For all the aforesaid reasons,\n\nMr. Kamdar submitted that the impugned order passed by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal cannot be sustained and ought to be set aside in\n\nAppeal under \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act. In support of the\n\naforesaid submissions, Mr. Kamdar relied upon the following\n\ndecisions:-\n\n \n(\ni) Wind World (India) Limited and Others v/s Enercon GmbH\n and another\n [Arbitration Petition (L)No.374 of 2016 decided\n on 29th March, 2016].\n\n (ii) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited v/s M/s Jindal\n Drilling and Industries Limited [Arbitration Petition No. 587\n of 2014 decided on 28th April, 2015]\n\n \n(\niii) Balwant Rai Saluja Another v/s Air India Limtied and\n Others\n [(2014) 9 SCC 407].\n\n \n(\niv) K. D. Sharma v/s Steel Authority of India Limited and Others\n\n [(2008) 12 SCC 481].\n\n43. Mr. Samdani, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 (the Petitioners in Arbitration\n\nPetition No.939/2018), basically adopted the arguments\n\ncanvassed by Mr. Kamdar. In addition to the aforesaid\n\narguments, Mr. Samdani submitted that admittedly Respondent\n\nNos.5 to 7 were not signatories to the arbitration agreement and\n\nAswale 45/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nwere sought to be sued as a related party. He brought to my\n\nattention the prayers in the Statement of Claim filed in the\n\narbitration proceedings and submitted that there was no direct\n\nprayer against Respondent Nos.5 to 7. The prayers against\n\nRespondent Nos.5 to 7 were all indirect prayers, namely, to direct\n\nRespondent No.5 to repay and restitute the refundable security\n\ndeposit placed with it by Respondent No.3 to enable Respondent\n\nNo.3 to satisfy its payment obligation to the Claimants under the\n\nSHA. He submitted that no direct relief was sought against\n\nRespondent No.5 to 7. This being the case, he submitted that if no\n\ndirect final relief was sought against Respondent Nos.5 to 7, no\n\ninterim relief could be granted against them either. This was for\n\nthe simple reason that interim relief is always granted in the aid of\n\nthe final relief and if no direct final relief is claimed, then, there\n\nwas no question of granting any interim relief.\n\n44. Mr. Samdani then submitted that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, while granting relief under \nSection 17\n, either of deposit,\n\nattachment before judgment or an injunction, is bound by the\n\nsame principles and conditions as set out under Order 38 or \nOrder\n\n39 of the CPC\n. In other words, Mr. Samdani submitted that before\n\nAswale 46/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ngranting the reliefs sought for by the Claimants, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal had to be satisfied that the conditions laid down under\n\nthe provisions of Order 38 or Order 39 have been duly complied\n\nwith by the Claimants. In the facts of the present case, Mr.\n\nSamdani submitted that those conditions were not satisfied by the\n\nClaimants and hence they were not entitled to the reliefs as\n\nprayed for.\n\n45. Over and above this, Mr. Samdani also laid great stress\n\non paragraph 46 of the impugned order wherein, according to Mr.\n\nSamdani, a statement was recorded on behalf of the Claimants\n\nthat they would be satisfied if the actual amount of invested\n\nmoney is protected pending the further proceedings. He\n\nsubmitted that in light of this statement made on behalf of the\n\nClaimants, it was highly unjustified that Respondent Nos.5 to 7\n\nwere injuncted from dealing with all their properties and whose\n\nvalue, according to Mr. Samdani, was far in excess of even the\n\nentire claim made in the arbitration proceedings. In other words,\n\nMr. Samdani submitted that the injunction granted against\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7 was highly excessive and ought to be set\n\naside on that ground alone. As far as the deposit order is\n\nAswale 47/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nconcerned, Mr. Samdani fairly did not repeat the arguments that\n\nwere canvassed by Mr. Kamdar and only adopted the same that\n\nthere was no justification for passing an order of deposit as no case\n\nwas made out for such a drastic order. In these circumstances,\n\nMr. Samdani submitted that the impugned order cannot be\n\nsustained and ought to be set aside.\n\n46. In support of all his propositions, Mr. Samdani relied\n\nupon the following decisions:-\n\n \n(\ni) Adhunik Steels Ltd v/s Orissa Manganese and Minerals (P)\n Ltd.\n [(2007) 7 SCC 125].\n\n \n(\nii) Raman Tech and Process Engg. Co and Another v/s Solanki\n Traders\n. [(2008) 2 SCC 302].\n\n \n(\niii) Nimbus Communications Ltd v/s Board of Control For\n Cricket In India\n. [2013 (1) Mh. L. J. 39].\n\n \n(iv) Board of Control for Cricket in \nIndia v/s Jaipur IPL Cricket\n Private India Limited\n. [Arbitration Appeal (L)No. 30742 of\n 2010 decided on 14th December, 2010].\n\n \n(\nv) Jagdish Singh v/s Madhuri Devi\n [(2008) 10 SCC 497].\n\n47. On the other hand, Mr. Jagtiani, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the Claimants, submitted that there was no\n\nmerit in the contentions canvassed by the Respondents. He\n\nAswale 48/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nsubmitted that all these arguments that are now being canvassed\n\nbefore me and on the merits of the application, were never\n\ncanvassed before the Tribunal. In fact, on the merits of the\n\nmatter, Mr. Jagtiani was at pains to point out the findings of the\n\nTribunal at paragraph 44 where the Tribunal specifically records\n\nthat apart from a bare denial and characterization of the PWC\n\nreport as bogus and one sided, there was no serious attempt made\n\nto meet with the serious allegations made by the Claimants. The\n\nonly attempt made before the Tribunal was to contend that the\n\ndisputes were beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and\n\nhence no interim relief could be granted.\n\n48. Mr. Jagtiani then submitted that the Respondents\n\nhave completely misconstrued the statement of the Claimants that\n\nwas recorded in paragraph 46 of the impugned order. Prayer (a)\n\nof the \nSection 17\n application was for liquid security and not with\n\nreference to the injunctions that were prayed for. He submitted\n\nthat prayer clauses (a) and (b) of the \nSection 17\n application\n\nsought for to secure the entire amount of Rs. 590 Crores. It was in\n\nrelation to these prayers that a statement was made that for the\n\ntime being the Claimants would be satisfied if the actual amount of\n\nAswale 49/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nthe invested money is protected pending further proceedings. In\n\nother words, Mr. Jagtiani submitted that it was only with\n\nreference to the prayers of liquid security that the Claimants\n\nstated before the Tribunal that they would be satisfied if amount of\n\nRs.190 Crores was furnished as liquid security. That statement\n\ndoes not in any way give up their claim or dis-entitle them to the\n\nrelief of injunction. He submitted that in fact the relief of\n\ninjunction was granted in favour of the Claimants by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal by its order dated 24th April, 2018 and which was\n\ngranted as an ad-interim relief. He, therefore, submitted that it\n\nwas completely incorrect on the part of the Respondents to\n\ncontend that the injunction could operate only until the deposit\n\nwas made or that the injunction was sufficient to secure the claim\n\nof the Claimants and therefore there was no need to pass an order\n\nof deposit of a sum of Rs.190 Crores. Mr. Jagtiani submitted that\n\neven the Arbitral Tribunal understood the statement of Claimants\n\nin the same manner and therefore, after recording the statement\n\nof the Claimants that for the time being they are restricting their\n\nclaim to the actual amount of money invested in Respondent No.3\n\n(in paragraph 46), proceeded to grant the relief of deposit of\n\nRs.190 crores as well as the injunctive reliefs as prayed for (in\n\nAswale 50/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nparagraph 47 of the impugned order).\n\n49. As far as the argument canvassed by the Respondents\n\nthat the injunction was excessive in nature, Mr. Jagtiani\n\nsubmitted that this was highly unfair to the Arbitral Tribunal. He\n\nsubmitted that this Court had passed an order asking the\n\nRespondents to disclose their assets along with the value of each\n\nasset as well as the status thereof. Though the affidavit was filed,\n\nneither the necessary information was given nor was the status of\n\nthe properties disclosed. He submitted that in fact Respondent\n\nNos.5 to 7 have categorically made a statement in their reply that\n\nall their assets are encumbered. This being the factual position,\n\nand since the Respondents did not disclose to the Tribunal as to\n\nwhat was the value of their assets, the Tribunal has no choice but\n\nto grant an injunction in relation to all the assets belonging to the\n\nRespondents. He submitted that the Respondents cannot take\n\nadvantage of their own wrong by first not disclosing the value of\n\nthe assets and thereafter contend that the injunction is excessive.\n\n50. As far as the contention of the Respondents that no\n\ncase has been made out for granting such drastic orders, Mr.\n\nAswale 51/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nJagtiani took me through PWC report. He submitted that the PWC\n\nreport clearly indicated that there were many transactions which\n\ncaste a doubt on how money was being taken out from Respondent\n\nNo.3 to Respondent No.5 and thereafter routed to the promoters,\n\nnamely, Respondent Nos.1 and 2. He submitted that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has examined the PWC report in the great detail in the\n\nimpugned order and thereafter found that the Claimants have\n\nmade out a prima facie case. It was the submission of Mr. Jagtiani\n\nthat none of the allegations and the transactions referred to in the\n\nPWC report (and on which the reliance was placed by the\n\nClaimants), were seriously disputed by the Respondents. This\n\nbeing the case, the Arbitral Tribunal, and in the absence of any\n\nexplanation given by the Respondents in this regard, could not be\n\nfaulted for relying upon the observations in the report of the PWC\n\nto come to a prima facie finding whether the Claimants had made\n\nout a case or not. He submitted that at least as far as the\n\ninjunction granted against Respondent Nos.5 to 7 is concerned,\n\nthey cannot make any grievance with reference to the same\n\nbecause in their affidavit in reply, Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 have\n\nthemselves stated that they have no intention of disposing of any\n\nof their properties. This being the case, there was nothing wrong\n\nAswale 52/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nin granting injunctive reliefs against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7\n\nrestraining them from disposing of their properties except in\n\nusual course of business, was the submission. Mr. Jagtiani\n\nsubmitted that it now turns out that the apprehension of the\n\nClaimants is well founded because even after the injunction order\n\nwas passed by the Tribunal, the Respondents have alienated\n\nseveral of their properties and which has been recorded by this\n\nCourt in its order dated 29th October, 2018 in Chamber Summons\n\nNo. 1030 of 2018 in Commercial Execution Application No. 2113\n\nof 2018.\n\n51. As far as the case under Order 38 or under Order 39 is\n\nconcerned, Mr. Jagtiani submitted that the Petition elaborately\n\nsets out how the money is siphoned away from Respondent No.3\n\nby giving huge security deposits to Respondent No.5 and which (at\n\nleast a part of it), were then routed to the promoters, namely,\n\nRespondent Nos.1 and 2. He submitted that looking to the\n\ntransactions in question and which have been elaborated in the\n\nPWC report, there was a serious apprehension that monies of\n\nRespondent No.3 were being routed to Respondent Nos.1 and 2\n\nthrough Respondent No.5. It was in these circumstances that the\n\nAswale 53/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nrelief of deposit as well as the injunction was sought for. The\n\nArbitral Tribunal examined all this material that was placed\n\nbefore it and thereafter came to a prima facie finding that the case\n\nfor grant of interim reliefs was made out. He submitted that this\n\norder of the Arbitral Tribunal was one which is certainly a\n\nplausible view and this Court, under \nSection 37\n, ought not to\n\ninterfere with the discretion exercised by the Tribunal unless it is\n\nfound to be wholly perverse or palpably contrary to the provisions\n\nof law. He submitted that in the facts of the present case, no such\n\ncase has been made out and therefore this Appeal holds no merit\n\nand ought to be dismissed.\n\n52. Mr. Jagtiani also pointed out that the Claimants have\n\nalready filed the evidence of five witnesses including a witness to\n\nprove the PWC report through a partner of PWC. Till date, despite\n\nthe directions of the Tribunal, no evidence is filed by the\n\nRespondents. To put it in a nutshell, Mr. Jagtiani submitted that\n\neven till today the findings given in PWC report have not been\n\nrefuted by the Respondents. This being the case, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal could not be faulted for relying upon the same and\n\nthereafter granting the reliefs as was done in the impugned order.\n\nAswale 54/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nFor all these reasons, Mr. Jagtiani submitted that there was no\n\nmerit in the Petitions, and therefore, the same ought to be\n\ndismissed with costs.\n\n53. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at\n\ngreat length and have gone through the papers and proceedings in\n\nthe Arbitration Petition as well as the impugned order passed by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. The first argument that was canvassed\n\nbefore me was in relation to the statement made by the Claimants\n\nrestricting their claim to the sum of Rs.190 Crores at the interim\n\nstage and which has been recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal in\n\nparagraph 46 of the impugned order. According to Mr. Kamdar as\n\nwell as Mr. Samdani, since the Claimants had, at the interim stage,\n\nrestricted their claim to the sum of Rs.190 Crores, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal had completely gone wrong in not only directing the\n\nRespondents to deposit the said amount or in the alternative give\n\na bank guarantee, but thereafter also granted an injunction\n\nagainst the Respondents from disposing of any of their properties.\n\nIt was the submission of the learned counsel that both the reliefs\n\ncould not have been granted especially in view of the statement\n\nthat was recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 46 of the\n\nAswale 55/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nimpugned order. This being the case, the order passed by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal was highly excessive and was liable to be set\n\naside, was the argument. To understand this argument, it would\n\nbe appropriate to reproduce paragraph 46 of the impugned order:\n\n \"46: Mr. Jagtiani, learned counsel for the Applicants submitted\n that although in the application there has been prayer for securing\n an amount of Rs. 591,01,18,200/-, he would be for the time being\n satisfied if the actual amount of invested money is protected\n pending the further proceedings. The actual amount of invested\n money is said to be Rs. 190 Crores.\"\n\n54. On going through the prayers in the \nSection 17\n\napplication and reading it with paragraph 46 (reproduced above),\n\nI am unable to agree with the submission of Mr. Kamdar and Mr.\n\nSamdani on this point. Prayer (a) of the \nSection 17\n application\n\nseeks an order and direction against the Respondents to jointly\n\nand severally deposit an amount of Rs.591 Crores, being the\n\namount equivalent to the fair value of the equity shares held by\n\nthe Claimants in the Respondent No.3 company. Prayer (b), and\n\nwhich is an alternative prayer, seeks an order and direction\n\nagainst the Respondents to provide an unconditional bank\n\nguarantee in the sum of Rs. 591 Crores. Thereafter, prayer\n\nclauses (c) to (g) seek an injunction against all the properties\n\nbelonging to the Respondents. When one reads the statement\n\nAswale 56/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nrecorded in paragraph 46 of the impugned order along with the\n\nprayers in the \nSection 17\n application, it is quite clear that the\n\nstatement made and recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal in\n\nparagraph 46 was in relation and restricted only to prayer clauses\n\n(a) and (b). In other words, the statement recorded on behalf of\n\nthe Claimants is that for the time being the Claimants would be\n\nsatisfied if the liquid security of the invested money (the sum of\n\nRs.190 Crores) is protected pending the further proceedings. I am\n\nin agreement with Mr. Jagtiani, the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Claimants, that it is only with reference to prayer\n\nclauses (a) and (b), and which dealt with the liquid security, that\n\nthe Claimants stated before the Arbitral Tribunal that they would\n\nbe satisfied if the amount of Rs.190 Crores was furnished as\n\nsecurity. This statement did not in any way give up the claim of\n\nthe Claimants or dis-entitle them to the relief of injunction. One\n\nmust not lose sight of the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal had\n\nalready granted an ad-interim injunction against the Respondents\n\nfrom disposing of any of their properties by its order dated 24th\n\nApril, 2018. That ad-interim injunction has also been continued\n\nby the Arbitral Tribunal in the impugned order. What is also\n\npertinent to note is that this statement of the Claimants is\n\nAswale 57/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nrecorded in paragraph 46 of the impugned order. Thereafter, the\n\nTribunal in paragraph 47 proceeded to grant the interim reliefs\n\nand which is the operative part of the impugned order. In the\n\noperative part, the Tribunal not only directed the Respondents to\n\ndeposit a sum of Rs.190 Crores, or in the alternative to provide a\n\nbank guarantee for the said amount, but also proceeded to grant\n\nan injunction restraining the Respondents from disposing of any of\n\ntheir properties and further directing them to provide a complete\n\ndisclosure on affidavit of all the details of any of their immovable\n\nand / or movable properties. On reading the impugned order, I\n\nfind that the Arbitral Tribunal also understood the statement\n\nmade on behalf of the Claimants as one that was restricted to\n\nprayer clauses (a) and (b) and not with reference to the injunctive\n\nreliefs sought for by the Claimants. If in fact the statement made\n\non behalf of the Claimants was with reference to all the prayers in\n\nthe \nSection 17\n application, the operative part of the impugned\n\norder and which can be found in the very next paragraph, would\n\nhave read quite differently. I, therefore, find considerable force in\n\nthe argument of Mr. Jagtiani that the statement made on behalf of\n\nthe Claimants and as recorded in paragraph 46, was only\n\nrestricted to prayer clauses (a) and (b) of the \nSection 17\n\nAswale 58/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\napplication and that is also how the Arbitral Tribunal understood\n\nit. This being the case, I do not think that Mr. Kamdar and Mr.\n\nSamdani are correct in their submission when they say that the\n\nClaimants at the interim stage, restricted their entire claim only\n\nto a sum of Rs. 190 Crores. This argument would therefore have\n\nto be rejected.\n\n55. There is yet another reason for coming to the aforesaid\n\nconclusion. Paragraph 46 clearly records that the learned counsel\n\nfor the Applicants submitted that although in the application there\n\nis a prayer for securing an amount of Rs.591 Crores, the\n\nClaimants for the time being would be satisfied, if the actual\n\namount of invested money is protected pending the further\n\nproceedings. Admittedly, only prayer clauses (a) and (b) deal\n\nwith the question of providing security. This also clearly indicates\n\nthat the statement recorded in paragraph 46 was with reference\n\nto prayer clauses (a) and (b) only which dealt with to secure the\n\nactual amount and not with reference to the prayers of injunction.\n\nLooking to all these facts, I am clearly of the view that the\n\nstatement made on behalf of the Claimants in paragraph 46 of the\n\nimpugned order was only restricted to prayer clauses (a) and (b)\n\nAswale 59/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nand did not in any way dis-entitle them to seek the relief of\n\ninjunction in addition to securing the amount of Rs.190 Crores and\n\nwhich was sought as a liquid security. As stated earlier, it is quite\n\nclear that the Arbitral Tribunal also understood this statement in\n\nthe same fashion, and therefore, directed the Respondents to\n\nfurnish security in the sum of Rs. 190 Crores either by way of a\n\ndeposit or by furnishing a bank guarantee and thereafter also\n\nproceeded to grant the relief of injunction as sought for by the\n\nClaimants. I, therefore, have no hesitation in rejecting the first\n\nargument canvassed by Mr. Kamdar and Mr. Samdani\n\nrespectively.\n\n56. The next submission made by Mr. Kamdar and Mr.\n\nSamdani was that the injunction granted by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nwas highly excessive and if allowed to continue to operate would\n\nhamper the entire business activity of the Respondents thereby\n\nbringing it to a virtual standstill. Both counsels submitted that\n\nheavy reliance placed by the Arbitral Tribunal on the PWC report\n\nwas wholly misguided especially considering that this was at the\n\nhighest a unilateral and a one-sided report. At best, it was the\n\nopinion of an expert yet to be proved, was the submission. It was\n\nAswale 60/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nfurther submitted that the values of all the properties of the\n\nRespondents were far in excess of the entire claim made in the\n\nArbitration and hence, the Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in\n\ngranting such a drastic order of injunction.\n\n57. I am unable to agree with these submissions. Firstly,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal has analyzed the entire record before it in\n\ngreat detail. From Paragraphs 39 to 41, the Arbitral Tribunal has\n\nexamined the PWC report as well as the balance-sheets of\n\nRespondent No.5 for the financial years 2010 to 2017. It has\n\nnoted that there are very serious allegations in the PWC report\n\nand which have been set out in great detail in the impugned order.\n\nThereafter, in paragraph 44, the Tribunal categorically records\n\nthat despite all these serious allegations, apart from a bare denial\n\nand characterization of the PWC report as bogus and one sided,\n\nthere was no serious attempt made to meet these serious\n\nallegations. The Tribunal has categorically recorded that even\n\nduring the submissions, the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespective Respondents did not make any submissions with\n\nregard to the material allegations against them and the only\n\nattempt made was to contend that the claims and the applications\n\nAswale 61/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nwere beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is nobody's case\n\nthat this recording of the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 44 of the\n\nimpugned order, is an incorrect recording. On going through the\n\nimpugned order, I find, and in fact the same was also conceded\n\nbefore me, that as far as the merits of the allegations made in the\n\nSection 17\n application were not dealt with by the Respondents\n\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal. The Respondents chose to rest their\n\narguments on the basis that the Arbitral Tribunal had no\n\njurisdiction and hence could not grant any interim relief. This was\n\nthe path that the Respondents chose to take. This being the case,\n\nthe Respondents today cannot complain, and that too at the\n\nappellate stage, that the reliefs granted by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand based on the PWC report as well as the balance-sheets of\n\nRespondent No.5, was not based on any proof or that the same was\n\nhighly excessive. One must also not lose sight of the fact that the\n\nPWC report was prepared admittedly on the basis of the\n\ndocuments that were supplied by the Respondents to the\n\nClaimants and which were then forwarded to PWC for a forensic\n\nanalysis. I, therefore, do not think that this report, at least prima\n\nfacie, could be rejected by the Tribunal as being unilateral and one\n\nsided. The Respondents were given a fair opportunity to deal with\n\nAswale 62/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nthe said report and make their submissions thereon. However, the\n\nRespondents chose not to respond to the same. This being the\n\nposition, I do not think that the Arbitral Tribunal in any way\n\nmisdirected itself in relying upon the same to grant the reliefs as\n\nsought for in the \nSection 17\n application. I clearly find that the\n\nmaterial placed on record shows that the Claimants had clearly\n\nmade out a case under Order 38 as well as \nOrder 39 of the CPC\n.\n\nThe averments to that effect can also be found in paragraphs 142\n\nto 173 and 180 to 185 of the \nSection 17\n application. It now\n\ntranspires that despite the injunction order granted by the\n\nTribunal, the Respondents have disposed of some of their\n\nproperties and in violation of the injunction order. This in fact has\n\nbeen recorded by this Court in its order dated 29th October, 2018\n\npassed in Chamber Summons No. 1030 of 2018 in Commercial\n\nExecution Application No. 2113 of 2018. This order specifically\n\nrecords that the 5th Respondent, after the injunction order, had\n\npurported to transfer two properties to third parties for a\n\nconsideration of Rs. 7.50 Lakhs and 7.10 Lakhs. This money was\n\nordered to be brought back in this Court. Pursuant thereto, a\n\nDemand Draft of Rs. 14.60 Lakhs was brought into Court by\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7. The said order of 29th October, 2018\n\nAswale 63/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nfurther records that additional 10 properties were disposed of\n\nwith no explanation provided. Looking even to the subsequent\n\ndevelopments (i.e. after passing of the impugned order), it is now\n\nquite clear that despite the injunction order, the Respondents\n\nhave purported to transfer and dispose of their properties. I, am\n\ntherefore, clearly of the view that the Tribunal was fully justified\n\nin granting the reliefs that it did. In these circumstances, no\n\ninterference is called for with the impugned order in an Appeal\n\nunder \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n58. As far as the argument of the Respondents that the\n\ninjunction was excessive in nature, I find this argument to be\n\nwholly ridiculous. Even at the stage when the Petition under\n\nSection 9\n was filed, the Respondents were directed by this Court to\n\ndisclose on oath all their properties including their value and\n\nstatus. Though this affidavit was filed, what was the status and\n\nvalue of the properties was never disclosed. This being the case, I\n\ndo not think that the Tribunal was in any way unjustified in\n\ngranting the injunction order against the Respondents restraining\n\nthem from disposing of any of their properties. Without disclosing\n\nthe value of their properties, I do not see how the Respondents can\n\nAswale 64/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\ncontend that the injunction granted is excessive. This is more so\n\nwhen one takes into consideration that the Tribunal has\n\nrestrained the Defendants from disposing of any of their\n\nproperties except in the ordinary course of business. This would\n\nclearly indicate that the injunction is not of a nature that would\n\nbring the entire business activities of the Respondents to a\n\nstandstill, as was sought to be contended before me by the learned\n\nSenior Counsels appearing for the Respondents. This being the\n\ncase, I find that the argument of the counsels for the Respondents\n\nthat the injunction granted by the Tribunal was excessive in\n\nnature, to be wholly without any merit and has to be rejected.\n\n59. The argument of Mr. Kamdar regarding the misjoinder\n\nof parties and causes of action does not detain me further. It was\n\nfairly conceded before me that no such argument was ever\n\ncanvassed before the Arbitral Tribunal. This being the case, such\n\nan argument cannot be canvassed now before me to try and justify\n\nthat the interim order passed by the Tribunal requires\n\ninterference. It will always be open to the Respondents to canvass\n\nthis argument before the Arbitral Tribunal at the appropriate\n\nstage, if so advised.\n\nAswale 65/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n60. Even the argument made by Mr. Samdani that no\n\ndirect relief was sought against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 and hence\n\nno relief could be granted against them at the interim stage is\n\nwithout any merit. In the statement of claim, there is relief sought\n\nagainst Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 to repay the security deposits back\n\nto Respondent No.3 so as to ensure that Respondent No. 3 can\n\nsatisfy the claim of the Claimants. It is to secure this, that relief\n\nhas been granted in the interim application even against\n\nRespondent Nos. 5 to 7. I, therefore, think that it is incorrect on\n\nthe part of Mr. Samdani to contend that no interim relief could\n\nhave been granted against the said Respondents. This argument\n\nalso would therefore have to be rejected. This is more so when\n\nthere were serious allegations made against all the Respondents\n\nfor siphoning away monies from Respondent No.3 to Respondent\n\nNo. 5 and which were then rerouted to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2\n\nand which has been duly set out in great detail in the impugned\n\norder. All these parties, and as recorded in the impugned order,\n\nare related parties. In fact the Chairman and Secretary of\n\nRespondent No.5 are Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. These\n\nfacts have not been disputed. Why the monies were paid by\n\nAswale 66/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nRespondent No. 5 to Respondent Nos.1 and 2 has not been\n\nexplained at all even before me. Even now no attempt was made\n\nto explain or refute the findings that were given in the PWC report\n\nor the observations made by the Arbitral Tribunal regarding the\n\nmonies paid by Respondent No.5 to Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. I\n\nmust mention that the amounts were quite large in the sum of\n\nRs.24 Crores approximately. I, therefore, find that Mr. Samdani is\n\nnot correct in simply stating that because no direct relief was\n\nsought against Respondent Nos. 5 to 7, no interim relief could\n\nhave been granted against them. I must also mention that in the\n\nAffidavit filed by Respondent Nos.5 to 7 before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, they have clearly stated that they do not intend to\n\ndispose of any of their properties. This being the case, I do not\n\nthink that the Arbitral Tribunal was in any way wrong in granting\n\nthe injunctive reliefs against Respondent Nos.5 to 7 also.\n\n61. This now only leaves me to deal with the decisions that\n\nwere relied upon by the Respondents. The first decision relied\n\nupon by Mr. Kamdar was a decision of this Court in the case of\n\nWind World (India) Limited and Others\n(supra). The facts of\n\nthis case would reveal that the Arbitral Tribunal by its order dated\n\nAswale 67/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\n8th March, 2016 had directed the Petitioners to produce various\n\ndocuments and also granted various interim measures. The\n\ninterim measures granted by the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nwas against Petitioner Nos. 2 and 3 to do or not to do various acts\n\nin respect of preservation of partnership assets of various Limited\n\nLiability Partnerships (LLPs) and a Private Limited Company or\n\npreventing of any distribution of the assets etc of those LLPs and\n\nthe Private Limited Company. It was an admitted fact that the\n\nLLPs or the Private Limited Company were not parties to the\n\narbitral proceedings and it was thus argued that no interim\n\nmeasures could have been passed against those third parties. It is\n\nin these circumstances and in these facts that the observations of\n\nthis Court have to be read. This Court held that the power of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal under \nSection 17\n is a limited one and the interim\n\nmeasures must be related to the protection of the subject matter of\n\nthe dispute and the order may be addressed only to the party to\n\nthe arbitration. It is also in these circumstances that this Court\n\ntook the view that the Arbitral Tribunal has no power to lift the\n\ncorporate veil. I fail to see how this decision can be of any\n\nassistance to the Respondents. In the facts before me, the reliefs\n\nthat have been granted are not against any third party but against\n\nAswale 68/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nthe Respondents who are parties to the arbitration. They were\n\nduly heard and given an opportunity to make their submissions\n\neven on the merits of the case. This being the case, I find that this\n\ndecision is of no assistance to the Respondents.\n\n62. The next decision relied upon was a decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of ONGC Ltd Vs. Jindal Drilling and Industries\n\nLtd (supra). In this case, this Court held that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal had no power to lift the corporate veil. The facts of this\n\ncase also would reveal that relief was granted against a party who\n\nwas not a party to the arbitral proceedings. \nIn fact, in this\n\ndecision, a Single Judge of this Court referred to the case of \nChloro\n\nControls India Pvt Ltd\n (supra) and came to the conclusion that\n\nin the factual matrix before it, the Supreme Court decision in the\n\ncase of \nChloro Controls India Pvt Ltd\n (supra), has no application\n\nat all.\n \nIn contrast, in the facts of the present case, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, by relying upon \nChloro Controls India Pvt Ltd\n (supra),\n\nhas come to a categorical finding that Respondent Nos. 5 to 7 were\n\nnecessary parties to the arbitration and overruled their objection\n\nthat the Arbitral Tribunal had no jurisdiction in relation to them\n\nas they were not signatories to the arbitration agreement.\n This\n\nAswale 69/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nbeing the case, I find that the factual matrix in the case of ONGC\n\nLtd Vs. Jindal Drilling and Industries Ltd (supra) was totally\n\ndifferent from the factual situation in the present matter. This\n\njudgment therefore also is clearly distinguishable on facts and is of\n\nno assistance to the Respondents.\n\n63. Even the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nBalwant Rai Saluja and Another\n (supra) is of no assistance to\n\nthe Respondents. This decision of the Supreme Court has not been\n\nrendered with reference to the \nArbitration Act\n but with reference\n\nto Labour Laws and the employer-employee relationship. I fail to\n\nsee how this decision of the Supreme Court in any way assists the\n\nRespondents. In this decision, the Supreme Court has held that as\n\na general principle of \"Corporate Law\", a parent company is not\n\nliable for the acts of its subsidiary. The Doctrine of \"Piercing the\n\nCorporate Veil\" stands as an exception to the principle that the\n\nCompany is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its\n\nshareholders, with its own legal rights and obligations. This\n\ndecision, in fact states under what circumstances the Corporate\n\nVeil can be pierced by the Court. This decision does not in any way\n\nseem to suggest that the Arbitral Tribunal, in a given factual\n\nAswale 70/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nsituation, does not have the power to pierce the corporate veil,\n\nespecially when that particular party is a party to the arbitration\n\nproceedings. This decision also, therefore, is of no assistance to\n\nthe Respondents.\n\n64. The last decision relied upon by Mr. Kamdar, was a\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of \nK.D. Sharma\n\n(supra). This decision clearly lays down that no relief can be\n\ngranted to a party that has come to court with unclean hands.\n\nWhilst there is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition, I fail to\n\nsee how this decision can be of any assistance to the Respondents.\n\nI do not find that in the facts of this case, the Claimants had\n\napproached the Arbitral Tribunal with unclean hands. There was\n\nnothing on the record of the Arbitral Tribunal to even suggest that\n\nthe Claimants had approached the Tribunal with unclean hands.\n\nThis argument was sought to be canvassed before me by placing\n\nreliance upon some documents which were tendered before me\n\nand which were never forming part of the proceedings before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal. In particular, reliance was placed on the Emails\n\ndated 8th August 2014 and 25th February 2015 to contend that the\n\nClaimants were fully in the know-of all things. Even on going\n\nAswale 71/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nthrough these Emails, I do not find that such is the case. These\n\nEmails do not in any way indicate that the Claimants were aware\n\nthat monies were being siphoned away from Respondent No.3 to\n\nRespondent No.5 and which were then rerouted to Respondent\n\nNos.1 and 2. I, therefore, find that the reliance placed on this\n\ndecision also is of no assistance to the Respondents.\n\n65. As far as the decisions relied upon by Mr. Samdhani\n\nare concerned, they all deal with the powers to be exercised by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal while granting reliefs under \nsection 17\n of the\n\nArbitration Act. These decisions hold that the Arbitral Tribunal is\n\nbound by the principles laid down under Order 38 or \nOrder 39 of\n\nthe CPC\n. Whilst there is no real quarrel with these propositions, in\n\nthe factual situation before me, I have held earlier that these\n\nprinciples and tests have been duly considered by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal before granting any relief to the Claimants. As\n\nmentioned earlier, there were serious allegations made against the\n\nRespondents of siphoning away monies from Respondent Nos.3 to\n\nRespondent No.5 and which were then rerouted to Respondent\n\nNos.1 and 2. Though ample opportunity was given to the\n\nRespondents to meet these allegations, they chose not to do so.\n\nAswale 72/73\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 03/01/2019 ::: Downloaded on - 10/01/2019 01:01:26 :::\n\n carbp.913.939.18.single.doc\n\nThey only chose to argue before the Arbitral Tribunal that it had\n\nno jurisdiction and hence no relief could be granted. This being\n\nthe case, the Tribunal recorded in paragraph 44 that no attempt\n\nwas made by the Respondents to refute the serious allegations\n\nmade against them. Considering what was stated in forensic\n\nreport of PWC and the Balance Sheets of Respondent No.5, the\n\nTribunal came to the conclusion that the Claimants were entitled\n\nto the reliefs as sought for. This being the case, I find that the\n\nTribunal correctly applied the tests laid down under Order 38 and\n\nOrder 39 of the CPC\n before granting the reliefs that it did. This\n\nbeing the case, I find that the reliance placed by Mr. Samdhani on\n\nall the aforesaid decisions listed by me earlier can be of no\n\nassistance to the Respondents.\n\n66. In view of the foregoing discussion, I find no merit in\n\nboth the Petitions. They are accordingly dismissed. However, in\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as\n\nto costs.\n\n ( B. P.
