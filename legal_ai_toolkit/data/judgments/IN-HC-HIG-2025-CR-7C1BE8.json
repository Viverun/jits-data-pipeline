Bhalswa\nDairy.\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV NARULA\nJUDGMENT\n\nSANJEEV NARULA, J.:\n\n1. This application under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha\nSanhita, 20231 (erstwhile\nSection 439\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n19732) seeks regular bail in proceedings arising from FIR No. 374/2023\nregistered under\nSections 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code, 18603 at\nP.S., Bhalswa Dairy.\n\n2. The Applicant's earlier bail application before this Court was\ndismissed as withdrawn on 11th March, 2025, at which stage charges had not\nyet been framed and directions were issued for expeditious conduct of the\ntrial. As per the latest report received from the Trial Court, charges have\n\"BNSS\"\n\"\nCr.P.C\n.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 1 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\nsince been framed; however, no prosecution witness has been examined and\nthe trial has not made any meaningful progress. During this period, the\nApplicant has undergone a further substantial span of incarceration. In these\ncircumstances, and having regard to the implications for personal liberty,\nthis Court considers it appropriate to entertain the present application and\nexamine the matter on its merits.\n\nFACTUAL MATRIX\n\n3. The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:\n\n3.1. The deceased, Moni Gupta, aged 25 years, married the Applicant,\nAkash Gupta, on 01st December, 2016, and was residing with him at\nMukundpur, Delhi.\n\n3.2. On 04th April, 2023, information was received at P.S. Bhalswa Dairy\nthat the deceased had been admitted to BJRM Hospital, Jahangirpuri, with\nsuspected history of poison ingestion. During treatment, she was declared\ndead. The crime team inspected the matrimonial home, seized certain\nexhibits including cloth material, a packet of \"Laxman Rekha\", a white solid\nsubstance, and the deceased's damaged mobile phone. The body was\npreserved for post-mortem and viscera was retained for FSL analysis. On the\nbasis of this information, the present FIR came to be registered.\n3.3. During investigation, the father of the deceased stated that from the\nearly years of marriage, his daughter had been subjected to persistent cruelty\nand dowry-related harassment by the Applicant and his family members. He\nalleged that dowry articles worth approximately INR 2,51,000 were given at\nthe time of marriage, and an additional sum of INR 2,00,000 was paid in\n2018, yet demands for money continued. It is further alleged that the\n\"\nIPC\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 2 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\ndeceased repeatedly informed her parents that she was being beaten and\npressurised to bring more money from her parental home. He also referred to\nan earlier incident when the deceased left the matrimonial home and was\nlater found at Banaras Railway Station, allegedly after being assaulted by\nthe Applicant and his family members.\n\n3.4. The statement of the minor daughter of the deceased, recorded under\n\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. on 22nd June, 2023, alleges prior acts of violence against\nthe deceased as well as demand for money on the night preceding the\nincident.\n\n3.5. Investigation has since been completed, a chargesheet has been filed,\ncharges have been framed, and the matter is presently pending for recording\nof prosecution evidence.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\n4. Ms. Nandita Rao, Senior Counsel for Applicant, urges the following\ngrounds in support of the Application:\n\n4.1. The Applicant has been falsely implicated. During six years of\nmarriage, no complaint of cruelty or dowry demand was ever lodged by the\ndeceased or her family. Even in the present case, the prosecution has not\nidentified any specific date, time, or concrete instance of an alleged dowry\ndemand or act of cruelty and relies only on broad, omnibus assertions.\n4.2. The statement of the minor child under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. was\nrecorded nearly two months after the incident and is therefore vulnerable to\ntutoring and embellishment. The child's version alleging beatings and burn\ninjuries is entirely contradicted by the post-mortem report, which records no\nexternal injuries on the body of the deceased.\n\n4.3. There is no contemporaneous material, such as messages, audio or\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 3 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\nvideo recordings, written complaints, or any other documentary evidence, to\nsupport the allegation of dowry-related harassment or sustained cruelty.\n4.4. The Applicant has already been in custody for more than two years\nand six months. Investigation is complete, the chargesheet has been filed,\nand charges have been framed. Out of 29 listed witnesses, not a single one\nhas been examined so far, and the trial is unlikely to conclude in the near\nfuture. Custodial interrogation is no longer required, and there is no\nallegation that the Applicant has attempted to threaten witnesses or interfere\nwith the proceedings. In this backdrop, it is argued that further incarceration\nwould be unjustified and disproportionate.\n\n5. Hitesh Vali, APP for the State, opposes the application on the\nfollowing grounds:\n\n5.1. The case concerns death of a young married woman under unnatural\ncircumstances, within seven years of marriage, thereby attracting the\nprovisions of\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC and the statutory presumption\nunder\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act. In such circumstances, the\nallegations cannot be viewed lightly at the stage of bail.\n5.2. Reliance is placed on the material collected during investigation,\nparticularly the detailed allegations of dowry-related harassment made by\nthe complainant (father of the deceased) and the statement of the minor\ndaughter recorded under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C. These material taken together,\nprima facie indicate a sustained course of cruelty and harassment \"in\nconnection with\" dowry demands, and thus the essential ingredients of\n\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC are duly made out, at this stage.\n5.3 The supplementary statement of the complainant specifically alleges\nthat the deceased was beaten on 20-25 occasions on account of dowry\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 4 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\ndemands. It is also stated that on one such occasion, about one and a half\nyears prior to the incident, the deceased left the matrimonial home and was\nlater traced at Banaras Railway Station. Further, it is recorded that on 03 rd\nApril, 2023, the deceased informed her mother that she had again been\nassaulted, was being pressurised to bring money from her parental home,\nand no longer wished to live. These assertions are corroborated by the\nstatements of the complainant's wife and son.\n\n5.4. As per the Applicant's disclosure during interrogation, on the evening\nof 03rd April, 2023, he was consuming alcohol with a relative and when the\ndeceased objected, a quarrel ensued, during which he slapped her and asked\nher to bring money from her father. Thereafter, the deceased consumed\npoison. The case diary also refers to a conversation retrieved from the\ndeceased's mobile phone between her and her father-in-law, in which she\nreportedly complained of cruelty.\n\n5.5. The allegations and the material reflect a sustained pattern of cruelty\nand harassment related to dowry, and releasing the Applicant at this stage\nmay expose the complainant and other material witnesses, who are yet to be\nexamined, to potential pressure or intimidation, thereby affecting the\nfairness of the trial.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n6. This Court has considered the rival submissions and examined the\nmaterial placed on record, including the 164 statement of the minor\ndaughter, relied upon by the prosecution. The Applicant stands charged,\ninter alia, under\nSection 304B\nIPC, which creates a distinct offence of\n'dowry death' and is complemented by the statutory presumption under\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 5 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.4 For that presumption to\narise, the prosecution must, at least prima facie, demonstrate: (i) the death of\na woman occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; (ii) such\ndeath took place within seven years of marriage; and (iii) soon before her\ndeath, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his\nrelatives, in connection with any demand for dowry. Once these\nfoundational facts are established, the law permits a presumption that the\nhusband or his relatives caused the dowry death.\n\n7. In the present case, the first two elements are, at this stage, not in\ndispute. The marriage took place on 1st December, 2016, and the death\noccurred on 4th April, 2023, due to ingestion of poison. The core issue, even\nat the threshold, concerns the third requirement, namely, whether there is\nmaterial to indicate that the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment\n\"soon before her death\" and whether such treatment bears a proximate nexus\nwith any alleged demand for dowry.\n\n8. The prosecution places reliance on the statement of the minor child,\naged about six years, recorded under\nSection 164\nCr.P.C., to establish a\nproximate link between the alleged dowry-related cruelty and the death. In\nthat statement, the child attributes physical assault to the Applicant on the\nnight preceding the incident, including allegations of beating and burning.\nAt the same time, as confirmed by the APP for the State, the post-mortem\nreport does not record any external injuries, burn marks, or other signs of\nrecent physical violence on the body. The statement of a child witness is\ncertainly relevant and cannot be disregarded; however at this stage, it can\nonly be observed that given the young age of the witness, the delay in\n\"the\nEvidence Act\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 6 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\nrecording the statement, and the absence of medical corroboration of recent\nassault, its ultimate weight and reliability will require careful evaluation at\ntrial.\n\n9. The prosecution also relies on the statement of the complainant (father\nof the deceased), who asserts that on 03rd April, 2023, the deceased spoke to\nher mother and complained of harassment, pressure to bring money, and loss\nof will to live. Beyond these assertions, however, the material presently\navailable does not disclose any specific, time-linked instance of dowry-\nrelated harassment in close proximity to the death, save for a general\nallegation of a monetary payment in 2018 and broad references to past ill-\ntreatment.\n\n10. There is also reference to a conversation retrieved from the deceased's\nphone between her and her father-in-law, in which the deceased voices\ncertain grievances. However, on the material on record, it is not shown that\nthe conversation makes any specific reference to dowry or to a demand for\nmoney soon before the incident, or that it records an occurrence directly\nconnected with the circumstances leading to the death. Whether this\nconversation, read with other statements, ultimately satisfies the \"soon\nbefore\" requirement is a matter that will fall for fuller examination at trial.\n\n11. At this stage, the absence of medically-corroborated injuries and the\nlack of proximate, time-linked allegations of dowry demand cast a prima\nfacie doubt on whether the necessary live link between alleged cruelty and\nthe death stands made out. Whether the prosecution ultimately establishes\nthe essential ingredients of the offences is a matter that will fall for\nappreciation on the basis of the evidence that parties may adduce at trial and\ncannot be pre-judged at the bail stage.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 7 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\n12. As per the nominal roll, the Applicant has undergone custody of more\nthan 2 years and 6 months. The investigation stands completed and a\nchargesheet has already been filed. Charges have been framed and the\nmatter is now pending for recording of prosecution evidence. Out of 29 cited\nwitnesses, none has been examined so far. There is no material before this\nCourt to suggest that the Applicant has any past criminal antecedents, nor\nhas any specific instance been pointed out where he attempted to abscond or\ninterfered with the investigation. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to\nproceed on the footing that the trial will take further time to reach\nconclusion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that prolonged pre-\ntrial incarceration, once investigation is over and the accused is no longer\nrequired for custodial interrogation, must be approached with care,\nparticularly in the context of\nArticle 21\nand the right to a speedy trial.\n\n13. The general principles governing the grant of bail are well settled.\nBail is not to be withheld as a form of pre-trial punishment, and the primary\npurpose of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at trial. 5 While\nconsidering a bail application, due regard must be given to the nature and\ngravity of the accusation, the severity of the punishment in the event of\nconviction, the prima facie evaluation of the material, the likelihood of the\naccused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of tampering with evidence\nor influencing witnesses.\n\n14. Having regard to the totality of circumstances, including the duration\nof custody, the stage of the proceedings, the nature of the material on record,\nand the settled principles governing grant of bail, this Court is of the view\nSee also:\nSanjay Chandra v. CBI\n, (2012) 1 SCC 40;\nSatender Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of\nInvestigation\n, (2022) 10 SCC 51.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 8 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\nthat the Applicant has made out a case for being released on bail. The\napprehensions expressed by the State that the Applicant may threaten or\nintimidate the complainant or other witnesses can be addressed by imposing\nstringent conditions.\n\n15. Accordingly, the Applicant is directed to be released on bail on\nfurnishing a personal bond for a sum of ₹25,000/- with two sureties of the\nlike amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Duty MM, on the\nfollowing conditions:\n\na. The Applicant shall cooperate in any further investigation as and\nwhen directed by the concerned IO;\n\nb. The Applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement,\nthreat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case or\ntamper with the evidence of the case, in any manner whatsoever;\nc. The Applicant shall under no circumstance leave the country without\nthe permission of the Trial Court;\n\nd. The Applicant shall appear before the Trial Court as and when\ndirected;\n\ne. The Applicant shall provide the address where he would be residing\nafter his release and shall not change the address without informing the\nconcerned IO/ SHO;\n\nf. The Applicant shall, upon his release, give his mobile number to the\nconcerned IO/SHO and shall keep his mobile phone switched on at all times.\ng. The Applicant shall report to the concerned PS on first Friday of\nevery 3 months;\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 9 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01\n\n16. In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/complaint lodged\nagainst the Applicant, it would be open to the State to seek redressal by\nfiling an application seeking cancellation of bail.\n\n17. It is clarified that any observations made in the present order are for\nthe purpose of deciding the present bail application and should not influence\nthe outcome of the trial and also not be taken as an expression of opinion on\nthe merits of the case.\n\n18. The bail application is allowed in the afore-mentioned terms.\n\nSANJEEV NARULA, J\nNOVEMBER 26, 2025\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 3131/2025 Page 10 of 10\n\nSigning Date:26.11.2025\n\n16:58:01",
