JUSTICE MOHD. YOUSUF WANI, JUDGE\n ,\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n 01. The instant bail application has been filed under the\n\n provisions of Section 483 of Bharatiya Nagraik Suraksha\n\n Sanhita, 2023, [hereinafter referred to as „BNSS, for short],\n\n corresponding to Section 438 of the repealed \nCode of Criminal\n\n Procedure\n, 1973, [hereinafter referred to as „ Code‟ for short],\n\n for grant of bail in favour of the petitioner/accused in case FIR\n\n No. 116/2022 of Police Station, Katra, the investigation\n\n wherein has already culminated into the filing of final police\n\n report/challan filed before the court of learned Principal\n\n Sessions Judge, Reasi [hereinafter referred to as „the Trial\n\n Court‟] in terms of the provisions of \nSection 193\n of the BNSS,\n\n corresponding to \nSection 173\n of the Code under \nsections 376\n,\n\n \n506\n IPC and 3/4 of \nProtection of Children from Sexual\n\n Offences Act\n 2012, [herein referred to as „ \nPOCSO Act\n‟]\n\n 2\n\n pursuant to the dismissal of his earlier bail application by the\n\n Trial Court.\n\n02. The bail has been sought on the grounds that\n\n petitioner/accused has been falsely and frivolously involved in\n\n the case FIR No. 116/2022 of Police Station, Katra, registered\n\n under \nSections, 376\n,\n506\n IPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act, which has\n\n culminated in the filing of final report/challan pending before\n\n the learned Trial Court. That an earlier bail application filed for\n\n and on behalf of the petitioner/accused before the learned Trial\n\n Court on 14th February, 2024, came to be dismissed by the\n\n learned Trial Court vide Order dated 8th June, 2024 as being\n\n non-maintainable on the ground that this Court in a criminal\n\n petition filed under Section 482 of the Code, corresponding to\n\n Section 528 of the BNSS, stayed the process of taking\n\n cognizance on the final report/challan while allowing the\n\n presentation of the same vide Order dated 8th May, 2024. That\n\n aggrieved by the Order dated 8th June, 2024, passed by the\n\n learned Trial Court while dismissing the bail application, the\n\n petitioner/accused approached this Court with a bail application\n\n bearing No. 133/2024 and this Court, vide Order, dated 21st\n\n June, 2024, set-aside the Order dated 8th June, 2024, of the\n\n learned Trial Court, directing for adjudication of the bail\n\n application on merits. That the learned Trial Court pursuant to\n\n the Order dated 21st June, 2024, of this Court heard the bail\n\n application afresh and disposed of the same on merits while\n\n dismissing the same vide Order dated 10th July, 2024, which\n\n necessitated the filing of instant bail application. That the\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 3\n\nmedical evidence, FSL opinion and more especially, the DNA\n\nAnalysis Report have ruled out the involvement of the\n\npetitioner/accused in the commission of alleged crime. That\n\nbasically a couple, namely, \"X\" [husband] and \"Y\" [wife]\n\nresidents of Panjar District Udhampur along with their minor\n\nchildren came to Katra in the year 2011 in search of their\n\nemployment as labourers/private workers on account of their\n\nextreme poverty. That the mother of the petitioner/accused\n\ngave them shelter and in lieu of the same, Mrs. \"Y\" used to\n\nattend the house hold works of the mother of the accused when\n\n\"X\" used to go for begging at Railway Track, out of which\n\namount the major portion was used to be taken by the mother of\n\nthe accused. That \"Y\" while giving birth to her 5th child in the\n\nyear 2015 expired and later on her husband \"X\" also died in the\n\nyear 2018. That the children of the deceased couple consisting\n\nof four daughters and one son continued to live with mother of\n\nthe accused even after the death of their parents as none of\n\ntheir relatives came forward to own them. That in February,\n\n2021, two daughters of the deceased couple including the\n\nprosecutrix ran away from Katra on the pretext of seeing their\n\nland at their parental village Panjar, Udhampur, as they came to\n\nbe informed by some villagers that their parental uncles are\n\ngoing to sell out their share in the land also. That while going to\n\ntheir native village Panjar, Udhampur, they met their step\n\nmaternal grandfather and thereafter both the girls stayed at his\n\nresidence for 15 to 20 days. That as per the version of one of\n\ngirls, i.e., sister of the prosecutrix, she narrowly escaped an\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 4\n\nattempt of sexual assault of her said maternal step grandfather\n\non which night she ran away from his home and slept on the\n\nroad side and reached Katra next morning. That the other girl\n\ni.e., complaint/victim preferred to stay at her step maternal\n\ngrandfather‟s house despite, the insistence by her sister for\n\ncoming back to Katra. That the respondent no. 2/victim\n\ncontinued to live at maternal grandfather‟s house till February,\n\n2022, where she reportedly gave birth to a baby girl who is now\n\nabout more than one month old. That the parental uncle‟s son\n\nof the respondent no. 2/victim, upon hearing about the matter\n\napproached the concerned police station in Panjar, Udhampur\n\nfor taking action against the maternal grandfather of the\n\nprosecutrix for committing forcible repeated rape upon her,\n\nmaking her pregnant and even managing her delivery in a\n\nJungle (Forest). That the step maternal grandfather of the\n\nrespondent no. 2/prosecutrix, by use of his influence succeeded\n\nin shifting the blame upon the petitioner/accused. That on 23 rd\n\nApril, 2022, the said person brought the respondent no. 2 to\n\nPolice Station, Katra, under his influence and succeeded in\n\nlodging a complaint written in Urdu before the SHO, Police\n\nStation, Katra, involving the petitioner/accused in commission\n\nof the crime. \nThat it was alleged in the said complaint lodged\n\nby the respondent no. 2 at the behest of her said step maternal\n\ngrandfather that the petitioner/accused allured her and forcibly\n\ncommitted rape on her, whereafter he threatened her of dire\n\nconsequences in case she made a revelation of the same, who\n\nlastly took the prosecutrix to her step maternal grandfather‟s\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 5\n\nplace at Panjar, where, after one month, she gave birth to a\n\nbaby girl. That the respondent no. 1, i.e., SHO, Police Station,\n\nKatra, without looking to the genuineness of the highly\n\nmotivated complaint prepared and filed by said step maternal\n\ngrandfather of the victim through her, registered the FIR No.\n\n116/2022 against the petitioner/accused for commission of\n\noffences under \nSections 376\n,\n506\n IPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act.\n\nThat the registration of the FIR against the petitioner/accused is\n\nalso backed by the persons who have committed the murder of\n\nthe brother of the petitioner/accused and were acquitted by the\n\nTrial Court, but regarding which acquittal, the mother of the\n\npetitioner/accused has filed a criminal revision which is\n\npending before this Court alongside the acquittal appeal filed\n\nby the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. That the\n\nregistration of the FIR against the petitioner, was assailed by\n\nhim through the medium of a criminal petition filed under\n\nSection 482 of the Code bearing No. CRM(M) No. 368/2022\n\ntitled \nPawan Kumar vs. UT of Jammu and Kashmir and Anr.\n, in\n\nwhich, this Court in the first instance directed that while\n\nproceeding with the investigation of the case, the respondent\n\nno. 1 shall await the orders of this Court for filing charge sheet,\n\nif any, contemplated. That this Court subsequently vide Order\n\ndated 8th May, 2024, passed on the said petition directed the\n\nprosecution to file the challan before the Trial Court, but barred\n\nthe taking of cognizance in the criminal case till further orders\n\nof this Court. That it is the case of the prosecution as mentioned\n\nin the challan that the DNA Analysis has ruled out the\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 6\n\npetitioner/accused as being the biological father of the child\n\nwho was born from the respondent no. 2 out of the alleged\n\noffence of rape. That the learned Trial Court, while rejecting\n\nthe bail vide Order dated 10th July, 2024 has committed an\n\nerror as the Court has failed to appreciate that the allegations\n\nagainst the petitioner/accused as per the prosecution are full of\n\ninherent contradictions and based on no overwhelming\n\nevidence. That the learned Trial Court has overlooked the very\n\nimportant aspect i.e., DNA Analysis Report while rejecting the\n\nbail application. That the petitioner/accused in his petition\n\nearlier filed before this Court under Section 482 of the Code\n\nhas averred that he has been falsely implicated in the case as he\n\nhad no physical contact with the alleged prosecutrix. That the\n\npetitioner/accused voluntarily opted for his DNA profiling for\n\nallowing the State to ascertain his involvement. That the\n\nincarceration of the petitioner in the case despite his non-\n\ninvolvement as per the DNA Report is unjustified under law.\n\nThat the learned Trial Court has rejected the bail application of\n\nthe petitioner only on the basis of statement of respondent no. 2\n\nrecorded during investigation under Section 164 of the Code,\n\nwhich, inter alia, is to the effect that petitioner raped her for\n\nthree to four years and when she revealed the matter to her\n\nmother, she did not pay any heed to the same and instead\n\nturned her out from her residence, which version could not be\n\nbelieved as being without any clear dates and being belated.\n\nThat had the respondent no. 2 been subjected to the rape by the\n\npetitioner continuously for years, then she ought to have raised\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 7\n\n an alarm earlier. That the respondent no. 2 was residing for\n\n more than one and a half year at Panjar in her step maternal\n\n grandfather‟s house, who, in fact, subjected her to repeated rape\n\n and made her pregnant where after he by use of his influence\n\n and by exerting undue influence on the respondent no. 2\n\n succeeded in filing a false complaint before the SHO, Katra, for\n\n registration of FIR. That the petitioner will not jump over the\n\n concession of the bail and shall abide any conditions that may\n\n be imposed by the Court.\n \nThat the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of\n\n India in a criminal appeal No. 537/2020 titled \nJayanat\n\n Chatterjee vs. The State of West Bengal\n enlarged the\n\n appellant/accused to bail on the ground that DNA Report did\n\n not show him as the biological father of the child born.\n\n03. The respondent no. 1 i.e., Union Territory of Jammu and\n\n Kashmir through SHO, Police Station Katra Reasi resisted the\n\n bail petition on the grounds, inter alia; that the\n\n petitioner/accused is involved in commission of offences\n\n punishable under \nSections 376\n,\n506\n IPC and 3/4 of POSCO\n\n Act arising out of case FIR No. 116/2022 registered with Police\n\n Station, Katra Reasi; that the statements of the witnesses\n\n especially that of the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix recorded\n\n under Sections 161 and 164-A of the Code, the medical\n\n examination of the respondent no. 2 and her age determination\n\n have corroborated the commission of offences by the\n\n petitioner/accused during investigation of the case and the final\n\n report/challan stands also filed before the competent court\n\n which is pending trial; that the DNA profiling of the new born\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 8\n\n baby who has subsequently died due to dehydration at SMGS\n\n Hospital, Jammu, respondent no. 2/prosecutrix and also of the\n\n petitioner/accused has been done and that the learned Trial\n\n Court has rightly dismissed the earlier bail application of the\n\n petitioner on merits as the offences committed by the petitioner\n\n are heinous and antisocial.\n\n04. The bail petition has been resisted on behalf of the respondent\n\n no. 2 i.e., prosecutirix on the grounds that the\n\n petitioner/accused does not deserve the concession of bail as he\n\n has committed serious, non-bailable and antisocial offences in\n\n relation to a minor orphan girl by taking advantage of her\n\n orphanage and helplessness. That the nature of the crime\n\n committed by the petitioner/accused is of utmost seriousness.\n\n The petitioner/accused not only forcibly raped the victim\n\n resulting in her pregnancy and the birth of a baby at the age of\n\n 14 years, but coerced her with a false promise of marriage to\n\n ensure her silence. That both the petitioner and his mother\n\n further threatened to kill the victim in case she discloses the\n\n crime. That fearing her life, the respondent no. 2 was\n\n compelled to flee to her maternal grandfather‟s residence where\n\n she gave birth in isolation in March, 2022. That the release of\n\n the petitioner/accused on bail is likely to pose a significant\n\n threat to the safety and wellbeing of the victim who has already\n\n suffered immense trauma. That the accused in order to flee\n\n from the clutches of law absconded since 23rd February, 2022\n\n and was only apprehended on 11th February, 2024. That in view\n\n of the severity of the charges and potential consequences on the\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 9\n\nvictim‟s health and wellbeing, there is high likelihood that the\n\npetitioner may attempt to evade the judicial process and cause\n\nharm to the victim if granted bail. That mention of the maternal\n\ngrandfather of the victim as an offender is an attempt on the\n\npart of the petitioner to create confusion and to shift the blame.\n\nThat the statement of the victim clearly reveals that the\n\noffences have been committed by the petitioner and not by the\n\nsaid person. That the police concerned during investigation of\n\nthe case did not find any evidence regarding involvement of the\n\nBalak Ram. That the re-examination of the DNA samples is\n\nnecessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings.\n\nThat the initial DNA test results may have been influenced by\n\nfactors, such as, sample contamination or procedural errors.\n\nFurthermore, the doctors, who conducted the original DNA\n\ntest, be examined as witnesses during the trial to ensure that\n\nthere was no tampering whatsoever. That the petitioner‟s\n\ncontinuous attempt to question the DNA Analysis Report is an\n\neffort to divert attention from the core issue of sexual assault,\n\nwhich the victim‟s statement clearly establishes. That granting\n\nof bail in this case would set a dangerous precedent,\n\nparticularly, as the crime involves heinous acts against a minor.\n\nSuch an act is not only a grave violation of victim‟s rights but\n\nalso an affront to societal morals and the rule of law. That the\n\nallegations in the FIR and the criminal challan against the\n\npetitioner cannot be dismissed as false, frivolous, or baseless\n\nsolely on the basis of delay in reporting. The delay in reporting\n\nsuch traumatic events is not unusual and should not be used to\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 10\n\n undermine the seriousness of the allegations. The victim, who\n\n was a mere child and an orphan, of 14-15 years old at the time\n\n of the alleged incidents, is likely to have experienced\n\n significant psychological trauma, fear and coercion, which\n\n could have impeded her ability to report the crime immediately.\n\n The fact that the victim did not raise an alarm immediately or\n\n that the accused is not the biological father the child does not\n\n negate the occurrence of the crime or the credibility of the\n\n victim‟s account. The respondent no. 2 has given the detailed\n\n para-wise response to the bail application also.\n\n05. Learned counsel for the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix in support\n\n of the memo of his objections has placed reliance on the\n\n Authoritative Judgments cited as \nRahul Kumar vs. Union\n\n Territory of Jammu and Kashmir\n through SHO Police\n\n Station Miran Sahib Jammu and Ors, reported in (2023) SCC\n\n Online J&K 323, State of Bihar vs. Bajballav Parasad,\n\n reported in (2017) 2 SCC 178 and Y vs. State of Rajasthan\n\n and Anr, reported in (2022) 9 SCC 269. It has been laid down\n\n in the relied upon cases that seriousness of the crime committed\n\n by the accused, the age of the prosecutrix and the statutory\n\n presumptions under \nSections 29\n and \n30\n of the POCSO Act are\n\n needed to be considered while dealing with the bail application\n\n of an accused involved in serious offences of sexual assault in\n\n relation to a minor victim. It has also been laid down in the\n\n relied upon cases that the court cannot conduct a mini trial\n\n while considering a bail application as the same is likely to\n\n prejudice the merits of the main case.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 11\n\n06. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, who almost\n\n reiterated their respective stands taken in the bail application\n\n and the objections respectively.\n\n07. I have perused the instant bail application and objections filed\n\n in rebuttal by the respondents. Considered the rival\n\n submissions.\n\n08. The final report/challan in terms of the provisions of Section\n\n 193 of BNSS is reported to have been already filed before the\n\n Trial Court, in which, the taking of cognizance stands barred\n\n pending further orders by this Court as per its order dated 8 th\n\n May, 2024, passed on a petition filed under Section 482 of the\n\n Code by the petitioner/accused.\n\n09. The petitioner/accused, as per the police report/challan, a copy\n\n whereof is enclosed with the instant bail application, is alleged\n\n to have committed the offences punishable under \nSections\n\n 376\n,\n506\n IPC and 3/4 of POSCO Act arising out of case FIR\n\n No. 116/2022 of Police Station Katra, Reasi.\n\n10. Admittedly, in case of non-bailable offences which do not\n\n carry a sentence of death or imprisonment for life in alternative,\n\n bail is a rule and its denial an exception especially in cases\n\n where firstly the custodial questioning of an accused is not\n\n imperative for the logical and scientific conclusion of the\n\n investigation and secondly where there is nothing on record to\n\n show that the accused, if admitted to bail, will misuse the\n\n concession by tampering with the prosecution evidence, by\n\n non-cooperation and association with the investigating agency\n\n and also by absconding at the trial.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 12\n\n11. Apart from the statutory bar, if any, two paramount\n\n considerations viz. likelihood of accused fleeing from justice\n\n and tampering with the prosecution evidence relate to the\n\n ensuring of a fair trial of the case in a court of law. It is\n\n essential that due and proper appreciation and weightage should\n\n be bestowed on these factors apart from others. The grant of\n\n bail or the denial of the same falls within the purview of the\n\n judicial discretion meant to be exercised on sound legal\n\n principles upon the logical interpretation and application of the\n\n same in the given facts and circumstances of the case. The\n\n necessary arrests subject to the law of bails as provided under\n\n the Code, BNSS and the provisions of different special\n\n Legislations are permissible under the Constitution of our\n\n Country by way of a reasonable exception to the fundamental\n\n right to liberty guaranteed under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution\n\n and the mandate of the provisions of \nArticle 22\n of the\n\n Constitution is meant to be followed upon making any such\n\n necessary arrests.\n\n12. \nIn \nState of Rajasthan Jaipur Vs. Balchand\n AIR 1977 S.C.\n\n 2447. The Hon‟ble Apex Court has held, \"basic rule may\n\n perhaps be tersely put as bail not jail, except where there are\n\n circumstances of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of\n\n justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating\n\n offences or intimidating the witnesses and the like, by the\n\n petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 13\n\n 13. It is also well settled that the bar imposed under section 480 of\n\n BNSS on the exercise of the discretion in the matters of bail\n\n subject to proviso contained in the section, is confined to the\n\n offences carrying a sentence of death or imprisonment for life\n\n in alternative and the offences carrying a sentence of\n\n imprisonment for life disjunctive of death sentence are\n\n exempted from the embargo.\n\n 14. No single rule or a golden litmus test is applicable for\n\n consideration of a bail application and instead some material\n\n principles/guidelines are needed to be kept in mind by the\n\n Courts and the Magistrates for consideration of a bail\n\n application especially including:-\n\ni. The judicial discretion must be exercised with the\n utmost care and circumspection;\n\nii. That the Court must duly consider the nature and the\n circumstances of the case;\n\niii. Reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being\n tampered;\n\niv. Investigation being hampered or\nv. The judicial process being impeded or subverted.\nvi. The liberty of an individual must be balanced against the\n larger interests of the society and the State.\nvii. The court must weigh in the judicial scales, pros and\n cons varying from case to case.\n\nviii. Grant of bail quo an offence punishable with death or\n imprisonment for life is an exception and not the rule;\nix. The court at this stage is not conducting a preliminary\n trial but only seeking whether there is a case to go for\n trial;\n\nx. The nature of the charge is the vital factor, the nature of\n evidence is also pertinent, the punishment to which the\n party may be liable also bears upon the matter and the\n likelihood of the applicant interfering with the witnesses\n or otherwise polluting the course or justice, has also a\n bearing on the matter.\n\nxi. The facts and circumstances of the case play a predominant\n role.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 14\n\n15. The Hon‟ble Apex Court in Gur Bakash Singh Sibbia Vs.\n\n State of Punjab AIR 1980 S.C. 1632, referred to the following\n\n extract from the American Jurisprudence having bearing on the\n\n subject of bail,\n\n \"where the grant of bail lies within discretion of the\n court, granting or denial is regulated to a large extent, by the\n facts and circumstances of each particular case. Since the object\n of detention order/imprisonment of the accused is to secure his\n appearance and submission to jurisdiction and the judgment of\n the court, the preliminary enquiry is whether a recognizance or\n bond would yeild that end. It is thus clear that the question\n whether to grant bail or not, depends for its answer upon a\n Variety of circumstances, the cumulative effect of which must\n enter into the judicial verdict. Any one single circumstance\n cannot be treated as of universal validity for justifying the grant\n or refusal of bail\".\n\n16. It has been laid down by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in \nSanjay\n\n Chandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation\n AIR 20012 SC\n\n 830 at Para 14 of its Judgment as under:-\n\n 14) In bail applications, generally, it has been laid\n down from the earliest times that the object of bail is\n to secure the appearance of the accused person at his\n trial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail\n is neither punitive nor preventive. Deprivation of\n liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it can\n be required to ensure that an accused person will\n stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more\n than verbal respect to the principle that punishment\n beings after conviction, and that every man is\n deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly\n found guilty. From the earliest times, it was\n appreciated that detention in custody pending\n completion of trial could be a cause of great hardship.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 15\n\n From time to time, necessity demands that some un-\n convicted persons should be held in custody pending\n trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in\n such cases, necessity is the operative test. In this\n country, it would be quite contrary to the concept of\n personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution that any\n person should be punished in respect of any matter,\n upon which, he has not been convicted or that in any\n circumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty\n upon only the belief that he will tamper with the\n witnesses if left at liberty, save in the most\n extraordinary circumstances. Apart from the question\n of prevention being the object of a refusal of bail,\n one must not lose sight of the fact that any\n imprisonment before conviction has a substantial\n punitive content and it would be improper for any\n court to refuse bail as a mark of disapproval of\n former conduct whether the accused has been\n convicted for it or not or to refuse bail to an un-\n convicted person for the purpose of giving him a\n taste of imprisonment as a lesson.\"\n\n17. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nDataram Singh vs State of UP and\n\n Anr.\n 2018 3 SCC 22 has held that even if grant or refusal of bail is\n\n entirely the discretion of a Judge, such discretion must be exercised\n\n in a judicious manner and in a humane way observing as follows:\n\n \"2. There is no doubt that the grant or denial of bail is entirely\n the discretion of the judge considering a case but even so, the\n exercise of judicial discretion has been circumscribed by a\n large number of decisions rendered by this court and by every\n High Court in the country. Yet, occasionally there is a necessity\n to introspect whether denying bail to an accused person is the\n right thing to do on the facts and in the circumstance of a case.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 16\n\n 3. While so introspecting, among the factors that need to be\n\n considered is whether the accused was arrested during\n investigations when that person perhaps has the best\n opportunity to tamper with the evidence or influence\n witnesses. If the investigating officer does not find it necessary\n to arrest an accused person during investigations, a strong\n case should be made out for placing that person in judicial\n custody after a charge-sheet is filed. Similarly, it is important\n to ascertain whether the accused was participating in the\n investigations to the satisfaction of the investigating officer\n and was not absconding or not appearing when required by\n the investigating officer. Surely, if an accused is not hiding\n from the investigating officer or is hiding due to some genuine\n and expressed fear of being victimized, it would be a factor that\n a judge would need to consider in an appropriate case. It is\n also necessary for the judge to consider whether the accused is\n a first time offender or has been accused of other offences and\n if so, the nature of such offences and his or her general\n conduct. The poverty or the deemed indigent status of an\n accused is also an extremely important factor and even\n Parliament has taken notice of it by incorporating an\n Explanation to \nSection 436\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n 1973. An equally soft approach to incarceration has been taken\n by Parliament by inserting Section 436A in the \nCode of\n Criminal Procedure\n 1973.\"\n\n18. \nIn \nPankaj Jain vs Union of India and Anr.\n 2018 5 SCC 743 the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the grant of bail has to be\n\n exercised compassionately. Heinousness of crime by itself cannot be\n\n the ground to out rightly deny the benefit of bail if there are other\n\n overwhelming circumstances justifying grant of bail.\n The Hon‟ble\n\n Apex Court in its Judgments cited as Siddharam Satlingappa\n\n Mhetre Vs. State of Maharastra AIR 2011 SC 312 and Sushila\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 17\n\n Aggarwal and Ors. Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) and Anr 2020 SC\n\n online 98, has interpreted law even on the subject of anticipatory\n\n bail with a very wide outlook and while interpreting concept of\n\n liberty guaranteed under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of our\n\n Country in a flexible and broader sense.\n\n19. This Court is conscious of the legal position that offences under\n\n \nSections 376\n IPC and 4 of \nPOCSO Act\n charged against the\n\n petitioner/accused carry a sentence of life imprisonment owing to\n\n which fact attraction or otherwise of the bar under Section 480 of\n\n BNSS, corresponding to Section 437 of the Code is to be addressed\n\n to. As hereinbefore mentioned, the bar imposed under Section 480\n\n of BNSS is not confined to the cases where the imprisonment for\n\n life is provided as an alternative punishment disjunctive of death\n\n penalty. I deem it proper to reproduce the relevant extracts of the\n\n pronouncements of the Hon‟ble Apex Court and also of this Court\n\n to the clarification of the issue:-\n\n Gurcharan Singh & Ors. V/s State (Delhi\n Administration) AIR 1978 SC179\n \"If a police officer arrests a person on a reasonable suspicion\n of commission of an offence punishable with death or\n imprisonment for life and forwards him to a Magistrate, the\n Magistrate at that stage will have no reason s to hold that\n there are no reasonable grounds for believing that he has not\n been guilty of such an offence. At that stage, unless the\n Magistrate is able to act under the proviso to section 437 (1),\n bail appears to be out of the question. The only limited inquiry\n may then relate to the materials for the suspicion. The position\n will naturally change as investigation progresses and more\n facts and circumstances come to light section 439 (1) on the\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 18\n\nother hand, confers special powers on the High Court or the\ncourt of Sessions in respect of bail. Unlike under section 437\n(1) there is no ban imposed under section 439 (1) against\ngranting of bail by the High court or the Court of Sessions to\npersons accused of an offence punishable with death or\nimprisonment for life. It is, however, legitimate to suppose that\nthe High Court or the court of Sessions will be approached by\nan accused only after he has failed before the Magistrate and\nafter the investigation has progressed throwing light on the\nevidence and circumstances implicating the accused. Even the\nCourt of Sessions will have to exercise its judicial discretion in\nconsidering the question of granting of bail under section 439\n(1) The overriding considerations in granting bail which are\ncommon both in the case of section 437 (1) and section 439 (1)\nare the nature and gravity of the circumstances in which the\noffence is committed, the position and the status of the accused\nwith reference to the victim and the witnesses, the likelihood of\nthe accused fleeing from justice of repeating the offence of\njeopardizing his own life being faced with a grim prospect of\npossible conviction in the case, of tampering with witnesses,\nthe history of the case as well as of is investigation and other\nrelevant grounds which in view of so many variable factors,\ncannot be exhaustively set out. The two paramount\nconsiderations viz likelihood of the accused fleeing from\njustice and his tampering with prosecution evidence relate to\nensuring a fair trial of the case in a court of justice. It is\nessential that due and proper weight should be bestowed on\nthese two factors apart from others.\"\n\n Jawahar Barwa Vs. State of J&K, 1973 JKLR 74.\n\n\"Cases are conceivable in which a person is accused of an\noffence punishable with imprisonment for life or in the\nalternative with imprisonment for a lesser term. To quote some\ninstances take for example the offences under \nsection 371\n,\n372\n\nand \n376\n IPC all of which are punishable with imprisonment\nfor life or imprisonment of either description for ten years and\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 19\n\nfine. The question arises, as in fact it was raised by Mr. Beg,\nappearing for the petitioner, whether the restriction imposed\nin \nsection 497 (1)\n Cr.P.C. providing that no bail should be\ngranted where there are reasonable grounds for believing that\nthe accused is guilty of an offence punishable with\nimprisonment for life, applies equally to such cases. The object\nof the law in providing an alternate punishment seems to be to\nleave room for the court to impose a lesser punishment than\nimprisonment for life where, in its opinion, there are some\nextenuating circumstances which lessen the gravity of the\noffence. As a corollary it must follow that the restriction\nimposed by section 497 (1) is not intended to cover a case\ninvolving an offence punishable with imprisonment for life and\nin the alternative imprisonment for a lesser term if there are\nextenuating circumstances which lessen the gravity of the\noffence. Even so the court may decline to enlarge the accused\non bail in such case as in other cases involving non-bailable\noffences where larger interests of the state or of the public so\ndemand or because there is reasonable possibility of the\naccused absconding or tampering with the witnesses or for\nsimilar other consideration.....\"\n\n Assadullah Khan and ors v/s State, SLJ 1980 J&K 31\n\"The very fact that an offence u/s 376 RPC was punishable\n\"with imprisonment for life or ten years\" amply makes out the\ndistinction between the categories of cases of this class and\nthose which fall within the category where punishment\nprovided is death or life imprisonment. It could not be correct\nto equate offences punishable with imprisonment for life or 10\nyears in their gravity and seriousness and in matter of bail\nwith those as are punishable either with death or\nimprisonment for life. The bar for setting out on bail was\ncomplete in respect of offences which are punishable either\nwith death or imprisonment for life. That bar in law could not\nbe extended to any other offence.\"\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 20\n\nMohinder Singh v/s State, KLJ 1987 237\n\"Therefore the rule of caution for granting bail is in respect of\nany non-bailable offences which carry punishment of either\ndeath or life. The proviso, therefore, classifies the offences on\nthe basis of punishment as there are huge number of offences\nwhich are non-bailable some of them defined heinous. First\ncategory comes murder u/s 302 RPC while under section\n371,372,376,377 RPC etc. Comes later. Thus latter portion of\nclause (1) \nsection 497\n Cr.P.C excludes the offences which\ncarry sentences for life or 10 years which we are concerned\nhere. The gravity of the charge under Murder is definitely\ngrave. Therefore, punishment provided iis death or life with no\nother alternative, the forceful portion of the clause 1st of\nsection 497 Cr.P.c. is, therefore, to be read in isolation while\nthe first portion of the clause (1) of \nsection 497\n Cr.P.C. which\ngives a clear command as in section 498 Cr.p.c. for granting\nthe bail. But even\n u/s 498\n Cr.P.C. the latter portion of the 1 st\nproviso has its play and it should be deemed a ride while\ngranting bail\n u/s 489\n Cr.P.C. in non-bailable offences\ncarrying death penalty or life imprisonment. Therefore, there\nis clear distinction between offences which carry punishment\nof death or life and offense which carry life and 10 years. This\ndemarcation is very much embedded in clause (1) of \nsection\n497\n Cr.P.C. In this view of the matter. I am not at all in\nagreement with the counsel for the complainant that the life\nimprisonment provided as punishment u/s 377 RPC should be\nregarded with equal force with offences which carries the\npunishment of death penalty or life. In my opinion the offences\nu/s 371,372, 376 and 377 RPC and other carrying similar\npunishment are out of the clutches of last clause of (1) of\n\nsection 497\n Cr.P.C. The bail in this case is, therefore, to be\nconsidered on its own merit without applying the rider\nindicated in clause (1) of \nsection 497\n Cr.P.C.\"\n\nSatyan, Petitioner Vs State, Respondent Cr.L.J. 1981 1313\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 21\n\n \"The Magistrate is not justified in holding that he has no\n power to grant bail to a person accused on the sole ground\n that the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life.\n The prohibition against granting bail is confined to cases\n where the sentence is either death or alternatively\n imprisonment for life. The expression \"offence punishable with\n death or imprisonment for life\" in section 437 (1) does not\n extend to offences punishable with imprisonment for life only\n (1926 27 Cr.L.J. 401 (Rang) and 1926 27 Cr.LJ 1063 (Nag)\n Re1.\n\n The legislature has made a liberal approach in the matter of\n granting bail and has shown its disapproval in the matter of\n keeping an accused person in custody in cases where he is\n ordinarily entitled to bail. The purpose of keeping a person in\n custody is to ensure his appearance in court at the time of trial\n and that he is also made available for the purpose of execution\n of the sentence. The purpose is not penal in character\"\n\n20. This Court is also conscious of the fact that provisions of \nSections 29\n\n of the POCSO Act presume commission, abetment or attempt of\n\n offences defined under \nSections 3\n,\n5\n,\n7\n and \n9\n of the said Act, in any\n\n prosecution against an accused for commission, abetment and\n\n attempt of said offences. The provisions of \nSection 30\n of the\n\n POCSO Act, also presume existence of the culpable mental state of\n\n the accused in any prosecution for any offence under the said Act,\n\n which requires a culpable mental state on the part of the accused.\n\n However, the accused‟s right in defense to prove that he had no\n\n such mental state with respect to the act charged as an offence is\n\n being protected under the provisions of the aforementioned \nSection\n\n 30\n of the POCSO Act.\n\n21. It is also true that as per the \nSection 31\n of the POCSO Act, the\n\n provisions of the Code including the provisions as to bail and bonds\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 22\n\n are applicable in the proceedings before a Special Court under the\n\n \nPOCSO Act\n.\n\n22. The presumptions under \nSections 29\n and \n30\n of the POCSO Act are\n\n not absolute but are rebuttable presumptions. Such provisions of the\n\n Act are to be considered at the conclusion of the trial and they do\n\n not operate as a bar for grant of bail if there are other conditions and\n\n circumstances which even before recording the evidence during the\n\n trial make out a prima facie case for not relying upon and\n\n considering such presumptions. Such presumptions are in the form\n\n of an additional advantage to the prosecution and do not absolve the\n\n prosecution from proving the foundational facts of its case. No\n\n doubt it is for the accused to prove his innocence after the\n\n prosecution establishes its case in terms of the foundational facts.\n\n23. The offence under \nSection 376\n IPC charged against the\n\n petitioner/accused carries a rigorous imprisonment of not less than\n\n 10 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life and with\n\n fine. The offence punishable under 4 of the \nPOCSO Act\n also\n\n charged against the petitioner/accused carries a maximum\n\n punishment of life imprisonment.\n\n24. So in view of the punishments provided for the offence of rape under\n\n \nSection 376\n IPC and for the offence of penetrative sexual assault\n\n under \nSection 4\n of the POCSO Act, the bar created under Section\n\n 480 of BNSS is not attracted.\n\n25. Admittedly, the offences charged against the petitioner/accused are\n\n heinous in nature and highly antisocial. A murderer destroys the\n\n physical body of a victim, but a rapist destroys the very soul of the\n\n victim. Society looks with great apathy and hatred an unchaste girl\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 23\n\n and it is immaterial whether she becomes so by a voluntary act or\n\n under force or compulsion.\n\n26. It is the admitted case of the prosecution that DNA Analysis of the\n\n victim, the baby and the petitioner/accused has ruled out the later,\n\n i.e., petitioner as being the biological father of the baby.\n\n27. The learned counsel for the petitioner/accused, during his arguments,\n\n submitted that the Hon‟ble Apex Court in a Criminal Appeal No.\n\n 537/2020 tiled \nJayanat Chatterjee vs. The State of West Bengal\n\n admitted the appellant/accused therein to bail taking into\n\n consideration the DNA Analysis report which did not show him as\n\n father of the child born.\n\n28. The learned counsel for the respondent no. 2, in support of his\n\n arguments, also relied upon the case law holding that DNA evidence\n\n showing a lack of biological connection does not invalidate the\n\n seriousness of rape allegations or justify bail based on such evidence\n\n alone. He also submitted during his arguments that a Court has to\n\n consider the other evidence on the record of the file and shall not\n\n decide only on the basis of DNA Analysis report, which is never\n\n 100% accurate.\n\n29. A DNA test has to be lent credibility especially after the\n\n incorporation of Section 53-A in the Code w.e.f. 23rd June, 2006,\n\n which has made it necessary for the prosecution to go for DNA test,\n\n in rape cases, facilitating the prosecution to prove its case against\n\n the accused prior to 2006, the prosecution could have still resorted\n\n to this procedure of getting DNA test for making its case foolproof.\n\n \nThe Hon‟ble Supreme Court in \nMukesh and Anr. vs. State\n for NCT\n\n of Delhi and Ors. AIR2017 SC 2061 decided on 5th May, 2017, has\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 24\n\n laid much emphasis on the DNA Analysis being accurate as a\n\n technique outcome of recent scientific development. The Apex\n\n Court in the said case has, inter alia, held at para-87 of the\n\n Judgment that DNA evidence is now a predominant forensic\n\n technique for identifying criminals when biological issues are left at\n\n the scene of crime. It is profitable to reproduce the para-88 of the\n\n Judgment.\n\n \n88. Observing that DNA is scientifically accurate and\n exact science and that the trial court was not justified\n in rejecting DNA report, in \nSantosh Kumar Singh v.\n State\n through CBI (2010) 9 SCC 747, the Court held\n as under:-\n\n \"65. We now come to the circumstance with\n regard to the comparison of the semen stains with the\n blood taken from the appellant. The trial court had\n found against the prosecution on this aspect. In this\n connection, we must emphasis that the court cannot\n substitute its own opinion for that of an expert, more\n particularly in a science such as DNA profiling which\n is a recent development.\"\n\n30. It is also true that prosecution and the complainant have right under\n\n law to lead evidence as against the accuracy of the DNA Analysis\n\n report during trial of the case. However, during investigation stage\n\n or the initial trial stage, ahead of recording evidence, such analysis\n\n report can be considered for consideration of a bail petition.\n\n31. As hereinbefore, mentioned at para-14, a series of guiding\n\n factors/underlying principles are needed to be kept in mind while\n\n considering a bail application of an accused involved in non-\n\n bailable offences, regarding which there is no immediate statutory\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 25\n\n bar, as in case of an offence punishable U/s 103 of BNS\n\n corresponding to \nSection 302\n IPC or in offences punishable U/ss 19,\n\n 24, 27-A and offences in relation to commercial quantities under\n\n \nNDPS Act\n or, in case of offences mentioned under Chapter-IV and\n\n VI, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967 etc. etc., for\n\n exercise of judicial discretion among which the factor,\n\n \"circumstances under which, offence is committed,\" also finds its\n\n place which needs to be given due weightage.\n\n32. In the facts and circumstances of the case, especially, while\n\n considering the DNA Profiling report, which does not connect the\n\n petitioner with the alleged crime, and the circumstances under\n\n which the crime is alleged to have been committed, this Court is of\n\n the opinion that it may meet the ends of justice in case the petitioner\n\n is admitted to bail subject to reasonable terms and conditions.\n\n33. It is very needful to mention that petitioner/accused during\n\n investigation of the case FIR against him preferred a petition under\n\n Section 482 of the Code being CRM (M) No. 368/2022 for\n\n quashment of the FIR mainly on the ground that he has been falsely\n\n implicated in the case which is evident from the DNA Analysis\n\n report which does not connect him with the alleged crime. As per\n\n the Order dated 8th May, 2024 of this Court passed in the said\n\n petition, the Police concerned was permitted to file police\n\n report/challan before the competent Court, but the taking of\n\n cognizance on the same has been stayed, pending further orders\n\n from this Court. The trial on the main criminal case/challan is\n\n needed to be started and to be proceeded expeditiously. After all the\n\n outcome of the petition filed under Section 482 of the Code\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 26\n\n pending before this Court shall have a direct bearing on the trial of\n\n the criminal case.\n\n34. For the foregoing reasons and discussion, the instant application is\n\n allowed and the petitioner/accused is admitted to bail subject to his\n\n furnishing personal and surety bonds each in the amount of Rs.\n\n 50,000/- for complying with the conditions of this order. The\n\n surety/bail bond shall be furnished to the satisfaction of the learned\n\n Trial Court. The bail order shall, however, be subject to the\n\n following conditions:-\n\n a) The petitioner/accused shall remain punctual at the\n\n trial of the case.\n\n b) The petitioner/accused shall not directly or indirectly,\n\n make any inducement, threat or promise to the\n\n prosecution witnesses especially the prosecutrix so as\n\n to dissuade them from making their statements at the\n\n trial of the case.\n\n c) The petitioner/accused shall not leave the limits of the\n\n Jammu, Division of the Union Territory of J&K\n\n without the prior permission of the learned Trial\n\n Court and shall not repeat the commission of crime.\n\n35. In case the requisite surety/bail bond is furnished and attested, the\n\n learned trial court shall issue a formal release order directing the\n\n Superintendent of the concerned Jail, where the petitioner is lodged,\n\n to release him from the custody in the instant case subject to the\n\n furnishing of his requisite personal bond to the satisfaction of\n\n Superintendent of the concerned jail.\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 27\n\n36. The observations in this order have been so made for the limited\n\n purposes of disposal of this bail application filed under Section 483\n\n of BNSS [439 of the Code] and shall not be construed as any\n\n interference or prejudging of the merits of the case, to be decided at\n\n the conclusion of the trial.\n\n37. The learned Registrar Judicial, Jammu, shall take necessary steps for\n\n getting the pending petition under Section 482 of the Code being\n\n CRM(M) No. 368/2022 titled \nPawan Kumar Vs. UT of JK and\n\n Anr\n, specially assigned expeditious speedy disposal thereof to an\n\n appropriate Bench of this Court under the orders of Hon‟ble the\n\n Chief Justice, provided the same is not already disposed of. The\n\n pendency of the said petition has halted the trial of the criminal case\n\n against the petitioner/accused, who is alleged to have committed the\n\n serious offences punishable under \nSections 376\n IPC, 4 of \nPOCSO\n\n Act\n, being against the society. The petitioner/accused may not be\n\n interested in the speedy disposal of the said petition, which has\n\n halted the trial of the main criminal case.\n\n38. The learned Trial Court shall, notwithstanding the pendency of the\n\n aforesaid petition under Section 482 of the Code before this Court,\n\n in which, by Order dated 8th May, 2024, the cognizance on the\n\n criminal case has been barred till further orders of this Court,\n\n continue to list the same [criminal case/challan] without any\n\n effective proceedings till and subject to disposal of the petition\n\n (refer to order dated 8th May, 2024 passed therein) with short\n\n adjournments, not exceeding 15 days and ensure the presence of the\n\n petitioner/accused at the trial with liberty to proceed under the\n\n provisions of Sections 491,492 of BNSS, corresponding to Sections\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 28\n\n 446, 446-A of the Code, in case of t he absconding at the trial of the\n\n petitioner/accused.\n\n39. Before parting, it is felt needful to observe that sometimes self\n\n induced environment, life situation, opportunity, fear, helplessness\n\n and undue influence compels a girl child to fall an easy prey to the\n\n sexual assault.\n\n40. The prosecutrix alongwith her sisters and brother was putting up in\n\n the house of the petitioner/accused since the time her parents were\n\n alive. After the death of the parents of the prosecutrix, none of her\n\n relatives came forward to own her and her other sisters. The\n\n petitioner/accused had an opportunity to do the illegal act. The\n\n prosecutrix being a minor child is supposed to be an unaware of the\n\n consequences of the act allegedly committed in relation to her. The\n\n situations are different where the illegal acts are being committed\n\n by persons having an entrustment or custody of females in their\n\n responsible capacities as public servants.\n\n41. Some bare minimum preventive measures in aid of law need to be\n\n taken by the prudent parents and guardians in respect of their\n\n children/wards to save them from exploitation on account of their\n\n vulnerability based on infancy, immaturity, bonafide belief, fear,\n\n reputation etc. etc. Sometimes children are thrown voluntarily by\n\n their parents and guardians in exploitation prone environment\n\n unmindful of the consequences. No doubt the law enforcing\n\n agencies are always at high alert but the criminal minded always\n\n find an opportunity to commit crime. The chastity of a girl is of\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 29\n\n predominating factor in the matter of her marriage. The society\n\n looks up with apathy, abhorrence and hatred to an unchaste girl\n\n and this includes the girl ravished by force or under compulsion.\n\n Most of the incidents relating to sex offences are not at all reported\n\n to the police. The court cannot loose sight of the fact that in sexual\n\n offences, the failure to report the incident to the police can be due\n\n to a variety of reasons particularly due to reluctance of the\n\n prosecutrix and her family members go to the police and complain\n\n about incident which concerns the reputation of the prosecutrix and\n\n the honour of the family members. It is only upon a cool thought\n\n that a complaint of sex offences is generally lodged. In the present\n\n society and more particularly in conservative villages, the chastity\n\n of a girl is of a great importance for her matrimonial relations.\n\n42. A little bit reasonable care and precaution in aid of law is sure to\n\n prevent an unfortunate incident of exploitation and save honour and\n\n reputation of a child. The long penal provisions containing Proviso\n\n upon Proviso cannot repair and restore the loss in terms of honour\n\n and reputation. No doubt our Parliament upon taking a serious note\n\n of the incidents of rape and gang-rape of women under the age 16\n\n years and 12 years, has made suitable amendments in the Penal\n\n Laws and also legislated special Acts for protection of children from\n\n sexual offences so as to generate an environment of deterrence by\n\n providing stringent punishments. \nArticle 15\n of our Constitution\n\n inter alia confers upon the State powers to make special provisions\n\n for children. Further \nArticle 39\n inter alia provides that the State\n\n shall in particular direct its policy towards securing that tender age\n\n of the children is not abused and their childhood and youth is\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 30\n\n protected against an exploitation and they are given facilities to\n\n develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and\n\n dignity.\n\n43. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Children,\n\n ratified by India on 11th Dec. 1992, requires the State Parties to\n\n undertake all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral\n\n measures to prevent the inducement or coercion of a child to\n\n engage in any unlawful sexual activity.\n\n44. The prosecutrix and her other minor sisters being orphans were\n\n living in the home of petitioner/accused even after death of their\n\n parents and their relatives did not bother to come to their rescue.\n\n Even the authorities under the \nJuvenile Justice (Care and\n\n Protection of Children) Act\n 2015 (hereinafter for short referred to\n\n as the Act) fail to act in respect of the said children in accordance\n\n with the provisions of Chapter-VI and VII of the aforesaid Act and\n\n the rules framed there under. Guilty are liable for penalty U/s 34 of\n\n the Act for non reporting. Concerned Child Welfare Committee(s)\n\n shall in a discreet manner swing into action, verify the present\n\n position of the prosecutrix/respondent No.2 and her minor sisters\n\n and brother and press into the service the measures for their\n\n rehabilitation and social re-integration if needed in consultation\n\n with their relatives.\n\n45. The learned Trial Court shall verify as to whether an application by\n\n or on behalf of the prosecutrix/respondent no. 2 for award of\n\n compensation under Victim Compensation Scheme in force stands\n\n filed and processed. In case such an application is not found to have\n\n been filed, the learned Trial Court shall take necessary steps in\n\n Bail App. No. 150/2024\n\n 31\n\n coordination with the District Legal Service Authority, Jammu, so\n\n that the entitlement of the prosecutrix to compensation under Victim\n\n Compensation Scheme is addressed to at an earliest.\n\n 46.

The proviso, therefore, classifies the offences on\nthe basis of punishment as there are huge number of offences\nwhich are non-bailable some of them defined heinous. First\ncategory comes murder u/s 302 RPC while under section\n371,372,376,377 RPC etc. Comes later. Thus latter portion of\nclause (1) \nsection 497\n Cr.P.C excludes the offences which\ncarry sentences for life or 10 years which we are concerned\nhere. The gravity of the charge under Murder is definitely\ngrave. Therefore, punishment provided iis death or life with no\nother alternative, the forceful portion of the clause 1st of\nsection 497 Cr.P.c. is, therefore, to be read in isolation while\nthe first portion of the clause (1) of \nsection 497\n Cr.P.C. which\ngives a clear command as in section 498 Cr.p.c. for granting\nthe bail. But even\n u/s 498\n Cr.P.C. the latter portion of the 1 st\nproviso has its play and it should be deemed a ride while\ngranting bail\n u/s 489\n Cr.P.C. in non-bailable offences\ncarrying death penalty or life imprisonment. Therefore, there\nis clear distinction between offences which carry punishment\nof death or life and offense which carry life and 10 years. This\ndemarcation is very much embedded in clause (1) of \nsection\n497\n Cr.P.C. In this view of the matter. I am not at all in\nagreement with the counsel for the complainant that the life\nimprisonment provided as punishment u/s 377 RPC should be\nregarded with equal force with offences which carries the\npunishment of death penalty or life. In my opinion the offences\nu/s 371,372, 376 and 377 RPC and other carrying similar\npunishment are out of the clutches of last clause of (1) of"
