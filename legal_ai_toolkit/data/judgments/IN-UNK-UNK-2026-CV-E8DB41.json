Since all these applications are filed by the same\n\npetitioners, the applications were consolidated, jointly\n\nheard, and are being disposed of by this common order.\n\n 2. The common case of the de-facto complainants\n\nin the respective crimes is that the accused were running\n\nestablishments named 'Nedumparambil Credit Syndicate'\n\nand 'Nedumparambil Nidhi Limited'. The accused had\n\noffered high interest on fixed deposits to the de-facto\n\ncomplainants. Accordingly, the de-facto complainants\n\ndeposited money in the said establishment on the belief of\n\ngetting high interest. However, the accused did not pay\n\nthe interest or return the capital. Thus, the accused have\n\ncommitted the above offences.\n\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 69 2024:KER:70789\n\n 3. Heard; Sri.Jai George, the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioners; Smt. Seetha S.,\n\nSri.C.S.Hrithwik, and Smt. Pushpalatha. M.K, the learned\n\nSenior Public Prosecutors.\n\n 4. The learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners are totally innocent of the\n\naccusations levelled against them. They have been falsely\n\nimplicated in the crime. There is no material to\n\nsubstantiate that the petitioners have committed the\n\nabove offences. In any given case, the petitioners have\n\nbeen in judicial custody for the last 140 days, the\n\ninvestigation in the cases is not complete, and the final\n\nreports have not been filed, despite the lapse of 90 days.\n\nTherefore, the petitioners are entitled to be released on\n\nstatutory bail in all the crimes, as contemplated under\n\nsub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code. By the\n\ncommon order dated 06.08.2024 in B.A.No.5656/2024\n\nand connected cases, the common order dated\n\n30.08.2024 in B.A.No.7170/2024 and connected cases,\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 70 2024:KER:70789\n\nthe common order dated 09.09.2024 in B.A.No.7300/2024\n\nand connected cases, and the common order dated\n\n11.09.2024 in B.A.No.7615/2024 and connected cases,\n\nthis Court has already enlarged the petitioners on bail.\n\nThe petitioners are entitled to the benefit of a similar\n\norder. Hence, the applications may be allowed.\n\n 5. The learned Public Prosecutors opposed the\n\napplications. They submitted that the petitioners have\n\ncommitted serious economic offences by cheating the\n\npublic at large. There are numerous cases registered\n\nagainst the petitioners for committing similar offences.\n\nThe petitioners are not entitled to statutory bail since\n\ntheir arrests were recorded in this batch of cases only\n\nfrom 28.06.2024 to 05.09.2024. Since \nSection 409\n of the\n\nIPC is incorporated, the petitioners are liable to be\n\npunished with life sentences. Therefore, the time period\n\nto file final reports is up to 90 days, which has not lapsed\n\nin these cases. If the petitioners are enlarged on bail,\n\nthere is every likelihood of them committing similar\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 71 2024:KER:70789\n\noffences. Hence, the applications may be dismissed.\n\n 6. The common prosecution case in all the crimes\n\nis that the petitioners had induced the de-facto\n\ncomplainants to deposit money in their establishments on\n\nthe assurance of paying them high interest. However, the\n\naccused failed to pay the interest or return the capital\n\nwithin the stipulated time period. The fact remains that\n\nthe petitioners were arrested in Crime No.644/2024 of\n\nthe Thiruvalla Police Station as early as on 07.05.2024.\n\nThey have been in judicial custody for the last 140 days.\n\nIn one batch of cases, this Court has already enlarged the\n\npetitioners on statutory bail, since the final reports were\n\nnot filed within the stipulated time period. The\n\npetitioners are actually entitled to the benefit of statutory\n\nbail since they are languishing in jail from 07.05.2024. It\n\nis only because their arrests were subsequently recorded\n\nin the present crimes, that they are not entitled to\n\nstatutory bail as on today. However, the fact remains that\n\nthe petitioners have been in judicial custody for the last\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 72 2024:KER:70789\n\n140 days, the investigation in the cases is practically\n\ncomplete, and recoveries have been effected.\n\n \n7. Recently, in \nManish Sisodia v. Directorate of\n\nEnforcement\n [2024 INSC 595] the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt has observed that, over a period of time, the trial\n\ncourts and the High Courts have forgotten a very well-\n\nsettled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a\n\npunishment. From its experience, it appears that the trial\n\ncourts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in\n\nmatters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is the rule\n\nand refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in\n\nbreach. On account of non-grant of bail even in straight\n\nforward open and shut cases, the Honourable Supreme\n\nCourt is flooded with huge number of bail petitions\n\nthereby adding to the huge pendency. It is high time that\n\nthe trial courts and the High Courts recognize the\n\nprinciple that \"bail is the rule and jail is an exception.\n\n \n8. Similarly, in \nJalaluddin Khan v Union of\n\nIndia\n [2024 INSC 604] the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 73 2024:KER:70789\n\nobserved in the following lines:\n\n \"21. xxx xxxx xxx When a case is made out for a\n grant of bail, the Courts should not have any hesitation in\n granting bail. The allegations of the prosecution may be\n very serious. But, the duty of the Courts is to consider the\n case for grant of bail in accordance with the law. \"Bail is\n the rule and jail is an exception\" is a settled law. Even in a\n case like the present case where there are stringent\n conditions for the grant of bail in the relevant statutes, the\n same rule holds good with only modification that the bail\n can be granted if the conditions in the statute are satisfied.\n The rule also means that once a case is made out for the\n grant of bail, the Court cannot decline to grant bail. If the\n Courts start denying bail in deserving cases, it will be a\n violation of the rights guaranteed under \nArticle 21\n of our\n\n Constitution.\"\n\n 9. \nIn \nSatender Kumar Antil v. CBI and\n\nanother\n [(2022) 10 SCC 51], the Hon'ble Supreme Court,\n\nafter a meticulous survey of all the precedents on the law\n\ngoverning bail, has laid down exhaustive guidelines for\n\nthe Courts while dealing with the bail applications. It is\n\nprofitable to extract the relevant paragraphs of the\n\ndecision in this context of the case on hand, which reads\n\nthus:\n\n \"12. The principle that bail is the rule and jail is the\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 74 2024:KER:70789\n\n exception has been well recognised through the repetitive\n pronouncements of this Court. This again is on the touchstone\n of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of India. This Court in Nikesh\n Tarachand Shah v. Union of India [Nikesh Tarachand\n Shah v. Union of India, (2018) 11 SCC 1 : (2018) 2 SCC (Cri)\n 302] , held that : (SCC pp. 22-23 & 27, paras 19 & 24) .\"\n\n \n13. Further this Court in \nSanjay\n Chandra v. CBI [Sanjay Chandra\n v. CBI, (2012) 1 SCC 40 :\n\n (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 26 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 397] , has observed\n that : (SCC p. 52, paras 21-23)\n \"21. In bail applications, generally, it has been laid\n down from the earliest times that the object of bail is to secure\n the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable\n amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor\n preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a\n punishment, unless it is required to ensure that an accused\n person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe\n more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment\n begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed to be\n innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty.\n\n 10. \nIn \nPrabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of\n\nDelhi\n)[2024 SCC OnLine SC 934], the Honourable\n\nSupreme Court has observed as follows:-\n\n \"21. The Right to Life and Personal Liberty is the\n most sacrosanct fundamental right guaranteed under\n \nArticles 20\n, 21\n and \n22\n of the Constitution of India. Any\n attempt to encroach upon this fundamental right has been\n frowned upon by this Court in a catena of decisions. \nIn this\n regard, we may refer to following observations made by\n this Court in the case of \nRoy V.D. v. State of Kerala\n[(2022)\n SCC OnLine SC 929 : 2022 INSC 756]:--\n\n \"7. The life and liberty of an individual is so\n sacrosanct that it cannot be allowed to be interfered with\n except under the authority of law. It is a principle which\n has been recognised and applied in all civilised countries.\n In our Constitution \nArticle 21\n guarantees protection of life\n and personal liberty not only to citizens of India but also\n to aliens.\"\n\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 75 2024:KER:70789\n\n 11. On an overall consideration of the facts, the\n\nrival submissions made across the Bar, and the materials\n\nplaced on record, particularly on considering the fact that\n\nthe petitioners have been in judicial custody for the last\n\n140 days, the investigation in the cases is practically\n\ncomplete, recoveries have been effected, and the\n\npetitioners have been enlarged on bail in several cases by\n\nthis Court, I am of the firm view that the petitioners'\n\nfurther detention is unnecessary. Hence, I hold that the\n\npetitioners are entitled to be enlarged on bail; but subject\n\nto stringent conditions.\n\n In the result, the applications are allowed, by\n\ndirecting the petitioners to be released on bail in each\n\ncrime, on them executing a bond for Rs.1,00,000/-\n\n(Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for\n\nthe like sum, in each of the crimes to the satisfaction of\n\nthe courts having jurisdiction, which shall be subject to\n\nthe following conditions:\n\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 76 2024:KER:70789\n\n (i) The petitioners shall appear before\n the Investigating Officers on every fourth Saturday\n between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m till the final reports are\n laid. They shall also appear before the Investigating\n Officers as and when required;\n\n (ii) The petitioners shall not directly or\n indirectly make any inducement, threat or procure to\n any person acquainted with the facts of the case so\n as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the\n court or to any Police Officer or tamper with the\n evidence in any manner, whatsoever;\n\n (iii) The petitioners shall not commit any\n offence while they are on bail;\n\n (iv) In case of violation of any of the\n conditions mentioned above, the jurisdictional court\n shall be empowered to consider the application for\n cancellation of bail, if any filed, and pass orders on\n the same, in accordance with law.\n\n (v) Applications for deletion/modification of\n the bail conditions shall be moved and entertained by\n the court below.\n\n B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases\n\n 77 2024:KER:70789\n\n \n(vi) Needless to mention, it would be well\n within the powers of the Investigating Officer to\n investigate the matter and, if necessary, to effect\n recoveries on the information, if any, given by the\n petitioners even while the petitioners are on bail as\n \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSushila\n Aggarwal v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another\n\n [2020 (1) KHC 663].\n\n Sd/-\n\n C.S.DIAS,JUDGE\nNAB",
