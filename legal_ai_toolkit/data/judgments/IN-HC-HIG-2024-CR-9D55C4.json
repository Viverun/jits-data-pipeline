It is alleged by the complainant that the deceased and the\napplicant got married on 26.04.2021. The deceased was\nsubjected to cruelty and harassment and was also tortured for\ndowry within a few days of marriage. A car and ₹2,00,000/- were\ndemanded by the applicant and his parents and they even tried to\nstrangulate the deceased. The complainant's daughter died after\nforty days of hospitalization, that is, on 21.06.2022.\n\n5. The complainant alleged that his daughter had been killed\nby the applicant and his parents which led to the registration of\nthe present FIR.\n\n6. During the course of the investigation, the statements of\nthe family members of the deceased were recorded under\nSection\nof the CrPC wherein they made specific allegations against\nthe husband/ applicant, Mother-in-Law, and Father-in-Law of the\ndeceased. It was alleged that the deceased was harassed by the\napplicant and her In-Laws for dowry. They demanded a car and\n₹2,00,000/- and often taunted her and even tried to strangulate\nher. Due to the alleged behavior of the applicant and his parents,\nthe deceased was compelled to commit suicide.\n\n7. The applicant was arrested on 22.06.2022 and the co-\naccused Shri Satya Narayan (Father-in-Law of the deceased) and\nShrimati Suman (Mother-in-Law of the deceased) were arrested\non 14.10.2022.\n\n8. On 17.08.2022, the charge sheet in the present case has\nbeen filed qua the applicant under\nSections 304B\n/\n498A\n/\nof the\nIPC.\n\n9. Vide order dated 13.10.2022, the learned Additional\nSessions Judge-2, Dwarka Courts, Delhi, passed the order on\ncharge qua the applicant under\nSections 304B\n/\n498A\n/\nof the\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 2 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:31\n\nIPC\n.\n\n10. The applicant had preferred two bail applications before\nthe learned Trial Court, which were dismissed, firstly, on\n12.07.2023 and, then on 18.12.2023. Being aggrieved, the\napplicant has preferred the present application.\n\n11. The learned senior counsel for the applicant submits that\nthe applicant and the deceased shared a good relationship with\neach other and she never complained of any altercations or\ndisputes. The allegations of cruelty and demand for dowry are\nmade for the first time in the present FIR. He submits that there\nwas no demand for dowry by the applicant or any of his family\nmembers soon before the death of the deceased.\n\n12. He submits that the deceased shared a cordial relationship\nwith her in-laws and they used to encourage her to pursue her\nfurther studies. Furthermore, they were the ones who on seeing\nthe deceased hanging from the fan, untangled her, rushed her to\nthe hospital, and attended to her needs during her hospitalisation.\n\n13. He submits that the deceased committed suicide due to her\nhyper and sensitive nature which is evident from the fact that on\nan earlier occasion also, she tried to pressurize the applicant by\ncutting her wrist and uploading its photograph on WhatsApp.\nThe said fact was duly admitted by the complainant during his\nexamination before the learned Trial Court.\n\n14. He submits that the testimonies of all the material\nwitnesses have already been recorded in the present case, and\nthere is no likelihood of the applicant influencing the witnesses.\nHe further submits that there are inherent contradictions in the\ntestimony of the complainant recorded before the learned Trial\nCourt as only vague allegations are made against the applicant\nwithout attributing any specific role in the alleged incident or\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 3 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:31\nstating any date/time where any such incident happened.\n\n15. He submits that even though the complainant had met the\nSDM on the fateful day on which her daughter committed suicide\ni.e., on 12.05.2022, however, he did not raise any grievance on\nthe said day and had only lodged the complaint after the death of\nher daughter.\n\n16. He submits that the investigation is complete and the\nchargesheet has already been filed. He states that as per the FSL\nReport, nothing incriminating has been found against the\napplicant. He further submits that the co-accused persons, being\nthe parents of the applicant, have already been enlarged on bail\nby orders dated 23.05.2023 passed by the learned ASJ-02,\nDwarka Courts, New Delhi. Therefore, the applicant is entitled to\nbe released on bail on the ground of parity.\n\n17. Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for\nthe State opposes the grant of bail to the present applicant on the\nground that there are serious allegations against him. It is pointed\nout that the deceased suffered harassment at the hands of the\napplicant and his family members and was compelled to commit\nsuicide because of their behaviour.\n\n18. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State\nfurther submits that by virtue of\nSection 113B\nof the Indian\nEvidence Act,1872, there is a presumption against the applicant\nthat he caused death owing to the demand for dowry.\n\n19. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have\nperused their record.\n\n20. It is not in dispute that the allegations made by the\ncomplainant are that of demand for a car and ₹2 lakhs from the\ndeceased. It is further alleged that accused persons harassed her\non several occasions which led to the deceased committing\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 4 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:31\nsuicide.\n\n21. However, it cannot be disputed that there is no previous\ncomplaint against the applicant with respect to alleged\nharassment in relation to the demand for dowry. The statements\nof the family members of the deceased are also bereft of any\nparticulars in terms of the date or time with regard to the\ninstances of demand for dowry.\n\n22. It is not denied that even though an incident of attempt to\ncommit suicide took place on 12.05.2021, no complaint or\nallegation was made by the complainant till 21.06.2021.\n\n23. The complainant has also stated in his testimony that he\ncannot tell any date, month, or an occasion as to when the\ndemand of ₹2,00,000/- and for a car was raised by the applicant\nand his family members. He also has not been able to say as to\nwhich of the accused persons demanded the money and a car.\n\n24.\nSection 304\nof the IPC reads as under:\n\n\"304B. Dowry death. -- (1) Where the death of a woman is\ncaused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise\nthan under normal circumstances within seven years of her\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any\nrelative of her husband for, or in connection with, any\ndemand for dowry, such death shall be called \"dowry death\",\nand such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused\nher death.\n\nExplanation: For the purposes of this sub-section, \"dowry\"\n\nshall have the same meaning as in\nsection 2\nof the Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\n\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven\nyears but which may extend to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n25. The basic ingredient to attract presumption in terms of\n\nSection 304B\nof the IPC is that the death should have occurred\nunder circumstances which are not normal within seven years of\nher marriage and the victim was subjected to cruelty or\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 5 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:31\nharassment by her husband or any of her husband's relative in\nconnection with any demand for dowry soon before the death.\n\n26. It is not a case of the prosecution that the applicant or his\nfamily members have been alternatively charged for offences\nunder Section 302 or 306 of the\nIPC\n. In fact, the other co-\naccused persons are stated to have been enlarged on bail by the\nlearned Trial Court. As pointed out by the learned counsel for the\napplicant, at this stage, the FSL Report does not point out\ntowards any incriminating material against the applicant.\n\n27. It is pointed out that only 10 out of 20 prosecution\nwitnesses have been examined. It is, however, not disputed that\nall the prime witnesses have been examined. The Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in\nSajid Khan v. State of Rajasthan & Anr.\n: SLP (Crl.)\nNo. 2290/2023 had granted bail to the accused husband charged\nfor offences punishable under\nSection 498A\nand\n304B\nof the IPC\nconsidering that all the vital witnesses have been examined and\nthe accused husband was in custody for around 15 months. It\nwas noted that conclusion of the trial will take some time.\n\n28. The object of judicial custody is to secure the presence of\nthe accused persons during the trial. The object is neither\npunitive nor preventive and the deprivation of liberty has been\nconsidered as a punishment. Delay in the commencement and\nconclusion of the trial is a factor to be taken into account and the\naccused cannot be kept in custody for an indefinite period if the\ntrial is not likely to be concluded within a reasonable time. The\npresence of the accused can be secured at the time of trial by\nputting appropriate conditions.\n\n29. Therefore, in the above circumstances, in the absence of\nany specific allegation of demand of dowry or causing\nharassment to the deceased soon before her death in connection\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 6 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:32\nwith any demand of dowry; and considering that the applicant\nhas been in custody since 22.06.2022; and the fact that the\nchargesheet has already been filed, I am inclined to grant bail to\nthe present applicant. Any apprehension of the applicant\nabsconding or fleeing can also be taken care of by putting\nappropriate conditions.\n\n30. Without commenting further on the merits of the case,\nkeeping the facts and circumstances in mind and the fact that the\ntrial is likely to take some time, I am satisfied that the applicant\nhas made a case for the grant of regular bail.\n\n31. In view of the above, the applicant is directed to be\nreleased on bail on furnishing a bail bond for a sum of ₹50,000/-\nwith two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of learned\nTrial Court / Duty MM / Link MM on the following conditions:\n\na. The applicant shall not leave the country without prior\npermission of the learned Trial Court;\n\nb. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial and appear\nbefore the learned Trial Court as and when directed;\nc. The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any\ninducement, threat or promise to any person\nacquainted with the facts of the present case;\nd. The applicant shall not, in any manner, try to contact\nany of the witnesses;\n\ne. The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the\nconcerned Investigating Officer /SHO at the time of\nhis release and the mobile shall be kept in working\ncondition at all times;\n\nf. The applicant shall, in case of change of residential\naddress and/or mobile number, intimate the concerned\nInvestigating Officer regarding the same.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 7 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:32\n\n32. In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/ complaint\nlodged against the applicant, it would be open to the State to seek\nredressal by filing an appropriate application for cancellation of\nbail.\n\n33. It is also made clear that the observations made in the\npresent case are only for the purpose of considering the bail\napplication and should not influence the outcome of the trial and\nalso not be taken as an expression of opinion on the merits of the\ncase.\n\n34. The present application is allowed in the aforesaid terms.\n\nAMIT MAHAJAN, J\nMARCH 7, 2024 / UG\n\nBAIL APPLN. 125/2024 Page 8 of 8\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 22/03/2024 at 22:14:32",
