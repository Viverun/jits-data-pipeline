Since the writ petitions involve the question of interpretation and\n\napplicability of the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 based on the\n\nsame factual matrix, these are heard together and being disposed of by\n\nthis common judgment.\n\n[2] Another writ petition being WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 filed by the\n\nrespondent No.5 herein challenging the final seniority list in the cadre of\n\nDeputy Directors, Department of Environment and Climate Change, Govt.\n\nof Manipur is also pending.

As the post of Data Analyst was re-designated to\n\nthe post of Deputy Director in the Department, it is equivalent to the newly\n\nre-designated post of Deputy Director.\n\n[6] Vide order dated 09.03.2016, the petitioner was posted\n\nagainst the newly re-designated post of Deputy Director by an order dated\n\n08.08.2016 issued by the Joint Secretary (Forests & Environment),\n\nGovernment of Manipur in which the petitioner's name is at serial No. 1.

Meanwhile, there was an objection from\n\nOne Dr. T. Brajakumar (respondent No. 5) in respect of the tentative\n\nseniority list which was settled after due consideration.\n\n[8] In such circumstances, the petitioner submitted a\n\nrepresentation dated 04.03.2022 to the Addl. Chief Secretary (Forest &\n\n Page 6\n Environment), Government of Manipur requesting to consider the case of\n\nthe petitioner for promotion to the post of Joint Director in the Department.\n\nThereafter, the said representation was forwarded by the Director of\n\nEnvironment & Climate Change, Manipur to the Addl. Chief Secretary\n\n(Forest, Environment & Climate Change), Manipur. As the representation\n\nsubmitted by the petitioner was not conveyed and having no alternative,\n\nthe petitioner approached this Court praying for directing the respondents\n\nto consider the case of the petitioner for promotion to the next higher post\n\nof Deputy Director to Joint Director as per RR as he has completed 5 (five)\n\nyears of regular service.\n\n[9] Being aggrieved by the order dated 25.07.2022 issued by the\n\nDeputy Secretary, (For., Envt. & CC), Government of Manipur, the\n\npetitioner challenged the same by filing a writ petition being WP(C) No. 849\n\nof 2022 wherein an interim order dated 19.10.2022 was passed directing\n\nthe respondents to carry out decision for promotion to the post of Joint\n\nDirector in the Directorate and to finalise the seniority list on or before\n\n15.11.2022.

Even though the\n\nfinal seniority list was published, no promotion to the post of Joint Director\n\nwas made despite the Hon'ble Courts' order. Thereafter, a notification\n\ndated 07.06.2023 was issued by the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. & CC),\n\nGovernment of Manipur for holding the DPC Meeting. On recommendation\n\n Page 7\n of the DPC Meeting held on 09.06.2023 and vide order dated 15.06.2023\n\nissued by the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. & CC), Government of\n\nManipur, the petitioner along with two incumbents were appointed on\n\npromotion to the post of Joint Director in the Department of Environment\n\nand Climate Change, Manipur.\n\n[10] However, the respondent No. 5 (who is at serial No. 3) in the\n\nseniority list of Deputy Director challenged the said seniority list by filing a\n\nwrit petition being WP(C) No. 262 of 2023 and the same was dismissed as\n\nwithdrawn. Thereafter, another writ petition being WP(C) No. 289 of 2023\n\nwas filed and in the order dated 31.03.2023 wherein it is clearly mentioned\n\nthat if the respondent No. 5 [petitioner herein] and respondent No. 6\n\n[Deputy Director at sl. No.2, and she is not a party in WP(C) Nos. 613 &\n\n634 of 2023] are given promotion on the basis of the seniority list, such\n\npromotion shall be outcome of the said writ petition. However, there was no\n\nstay order of the final seniority list of Deputy Directors. As per the\n\nnotification dated 01.08.2017 issued by the Deputy Secretary (For., Envt. &\n\nCC), Government of Manipur publishing the Rules regulating the method of\n\nrecruitment to the post of Director (re-designated from Senior Scientific\n\nOfficer) in the Directorate of Environment, Manipur, the feeder post of\n\nDirector is Joint Director with 5 years of regular service.\n\n[11] An Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 was issued by the\n\nSpecial Secretary (DP), Govt. of Manipur regulating the appointment on in-\n\ncharge basis to various post, when none is found eligible from the feeder\n\n Page 8\n cadre for appointment/promotion on regular basis.

Thus, with a view to bring uniformly, clarity and enforceable\n norms in making such in-charge appointment, the following norms\n are nearby issued for compliance by all concerned:\n\n i. Appointment on in-charged basis shall be made\n against a post only when there is no official eligible\n as per RR to fulfil the said post either by direct\n recruitment or promotion through duly constituted\n DPC.\n\n ii. In absence of any official eligible as per RR to fill up\n a particular post, the senior most person amongst\n cadre/officials belonging to the feeder post of the said\n particular post shall be appointed to hold the said\n post on in-charged basis, at no extra remuneration\n and in addition to the substantial post held by the\n appointee in lower post. Needless to say, the\n appointee shall draw pay against the lower post\n substantially held by him.\n\n iii. Where no arrangement can be made as in para (ii)\n above, an in-charge appointment shall be made to a\n vacant post from a person holding a similar post (at\n same rank and/or designation), at no extra\n remuneration.\n\n iv. An official appointed on in-charge basis against any\n post shall have the same financial power as a person\n appointed on substantial basis against the said post\n would enjoy.\n\n 5. These instructions shall be applicable while making\n appointments on in-charge basis to all posts under the State\n Government existing in all Government departments, agencies,\n societies, bodies, offices, companies, PSUs, autonomous bodies,\n etc.\"\n\n Page 9\n [12] Another Office Memorandum dated 09.03.2021 was issued by\n\nthe Special Secretary (DP), Govt. of Manipur in continuation of the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 03.10.2020 adding (v) to Para 4 and the same reads\n\nas below:\n\n v. \"Integrity certificate based on Vigilance Clearance,\n non-pendency of Departmental Enquiry, non-\n pendency of FIR cases which has been taken\n cognizance by Magistrate etc. is mandatory for in-\n charge appointments, especially the Head of\n Departments\".\n\n[13] In the light of the Office Memorandums dated 03.10.2020 and\n\n09.03.2021, the petitioner submitted a representation dated 19.06.2023 to\n\nthe concerned authorities requesting to consider his case for promotion to\n\nthe post of Director in the Directorate of Environment & Climate Change,\n\nManipur on in-charge basis being the senior-most incumbent and the said\n\nrepresentation was not considered by the concerned authorities. The\n\npetitioner filed a writ petition being WP(C) No. 491 of 2023 and the same\n\nwas disposed of on 05.07.2023 directing the respondents especially\n\nrespondent No. 1 to consider the representation dated 19.06.2023\n\nsubmitted by the petitioner on its own merit and in light of the Guideline of\n\nthe Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020 and also directing to dispose of\n\nthe same by issuing a speaking order within a period of three months.\n\n[14] Vide order dated 28.08.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary\n\n(DP), Govt. of Manipur, the respondent No. 5 was appointed as Director on\n\nin-charge basis in violation of the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020.\n\n Page 10\n By way of writ petition being WP(C) No. 613 of 2023, the petitioner has\n\nchallenged the order dated 28.08.2023 passed by the official respondents\n\nmaking the respondent No.5 herein as Director on in-charge basis as\n\nviolative of the OM dated 03.10.2020 as the latter is junior to the petitioner\n\nwho is the seniormost officer in the cadre of Deputy Director as well as\n\nJoint Director. Vide order dated 31.08.2023 in WP(C) No. 613 of 2023, this\n\nCourt stayed the impugned order dated 28.08.2023 till next date as\n\nviolative of the OM dated 03.10.2020. It may be noted that respondent\n\nNo.5 appeared on 31.08.2023 by filing a caveat petition. However, the\n\nofficial respondent issued another order dated 29.08.2023 in supersession\n\nof the earlier order dated 28.08.2023 making the respondent No.5 to look\n\nafter the charge of Director (Envt. & CC) as an interim arrangement till a\n\nregular Director is appointed. It is submitted that the official respondent\n\nhas malafidely issued the impugned order dated 29.08.2023 by modifying\n\nthe order dated 28.08.2023, which is under challenge and the said\n\nimpugned order is allegedly a back dated order because the same was\n\nneither placed by the Government Advocate nor by the counsel for\n\nrespondent No. 5 (who appeared on caveat) before the Hon'ble Court while\n\nhearing the matter on 31.08.2023 for passing the interim order dated\n\n31.08.2023.\n\n[15] Heard Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel assisted by\n\nMr. Ng. Jotindra, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. M. Rarry, learned\n\nState Special Counsel assisted by Ms. T. Keishing, learned counsel for\n\nState Respondent Nos. 1-4 and Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior\n\n Page 11\n counsel assisted by Mr. L. Sevananda, learned counsel for private\n\nrespondent No.5. Mr. A. Romenkumar, learned senior counsel assisted by\n\nMr. RK Bana, learned counsel appeared on behalf of the respondent No.6\n\nin WP(C) no. 289 of 2023. This Court has considered the material on\n\nrecord and relevant case laws cited at bar and written submissions filed by\n\nthe parties.\n\n[16] The short question of law involved in the present petitions is\n\nthe interpretation and applicability of the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.10.2020 and subsequent Office Memorandum dated 09.03.2021 issued\n\nby the Government of Manipur laying down guidelines for appointment of\n\nthe seniormost on in-charge basis, when none in the feeder cadre is\n\neligible for appointment by direct recruitment or by promotion as per\n\nRecruitment Rule.\n\n[17] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has\n\npointed out that on the recommendation of the Manipur Public Service\n\nCommission (in short, MPSC), vide order dated 02.03.2007 issued by the\n\nGovt. of Manipur, the petitioner was appointed on regular basis as Data\n\nAnalyst in the Forest & Environment Department, Manipur and vide another\n\norder dated 04.03.2009, his period of ad-hoc service wef 23.06.1999 to\n\n01.03.2007 was linked up for the purpose of pensionary benefit and not for\n\nother purposes including seniority. It is submitted that the petitioner was\n\nregularly appointed on 02.03.2007. Learned senior counsel draws the\n\nattention of this Court to an order dated 05.11.2011 appointing the\n\nrespondent No.5 as Research Officer on regular basis along with two other\n\n Page 12\n persons as Junior Scientific Officers in the Environment & Ecology Wing,\n\nDepartment of Forest & Environment, Manipur. Vide order dated\n\n24.12.2011, the Environment & Ecology Wing was upgraded to full fledged\n\nDirectorate of Environment, Manipur and by an order dated 04.11.2019, it\n\nwas re-named as \"Directorate of Environment & Climate Change, Manipur\".\n\nThereafter, by an order dated 09.03.2016, there was a mass re-designation\n\nwith up-gradation along with incumbents in the new Directorate of\n\nEnvironment & Climate Change. In this exercise, the post of Data Analyst\n\n(held by the petitioner), 2 post of Junior Scientific Officer and one post of\n\nResearch Officer (held by the private respondent No.5) were re-designated\n\nand upgraded as four posts of Deputy Directors. The pay scale of the\n\nexisting posts of Rs.9300-34800 + GP 4300 was upgraded to Rs.9300-\n\n34800 + GP 5400. Consequently, an order dated 08.08.2016 was issued\n\nappointing four employees as Deputy Directors on redesignation and the\n\nname of the petitioner was placed at serial No.1 and that of the private\n\nrespondent at No.4. In the Final Seniority List of 3 Deputy Directors (one\n\ndied during service) dated 11.01.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary\n\n(For., Envt.&CC), Govt. of Manipur, the petitioner was placed at serial No.1\n\nwith initial date of regular appointment as 02.03.2007 as Data Analyst and\n\nthe respondent No.5 at serial No.3 with initial date of appointment as\n\n05.01.2011 as Research Officer. The final seniority of the Deputy Directors\n\nhas been challenged by the respondent No.5 herein by way of writ petition\n\nbeing WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 and vide order dated 30.03.2023, this Court\n\npassed an order that any appointment shall be subject to the outcome of\n\n Page 13\n the writ petition, but the final seniority was not stayed. Learned senior\n\ncounsel further submits that on the basis of a duly constituted DPC\n\nproceedings 09.06.2023 in consultation with MPSC, the three incumbent\n\nDeputy Directors were recommended for promotion to the three posts of\n\nJoint Directors on consideration of all relevant materials including the\n\nACRs. Accepting the recommendations of the DPC, the Deputy Secretary\n\n(For., Envt.&CC), Govt. of Manipur promoted the three Deputy Directors to\n\nthe higher posts of Joint Directors. In the promotion order, the name of the\n\npetitioner is placed at serial No.1 while the respondent No.5 is shown at\n\nserial No.3.\n\n[18] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has\n\nstated that by an order dated 28.08.2023 (first impugned order) issued by\n\nthe Deputy Secretary (DP), Government of Manipur, the respondent No.5\n\nwas appointed to hold charge of Director (Environment & Climate Change)\n\non in charge basis till appointment of a regular Director. Subsequently, by\n\nanother order dated 29.08.2023 (first impugned order) and in supersession\n\nof earlier order dated 28.08.2023, the respondent No.5 was allowed to look\n\nafter the charge of Director (Environment & Climate Change) on in charge\n\nbasis till appointment of a regular Director as an interim measure subject to\n\nthe outcome of WP(C) No. 289 of 2023.\n\n[19] Learned senior counsel has pointed out that the first\n\nimpugned order dated 28.08.2023 was challenged by the petitioner in\n\nWP(C) No. 613 of 2013 and vide order dated 31.08.2023, this Court stayed\n\nthe order dated 28.08.2023 till next date. It is submitted that the second\n\n Page 14\n impugned order dated 29.08.2023 was issued in order to frustrate the\n\ninterim order dated 31.08.2023 of suspending the first order dated\n\n28.08.2023 granted by this Court in WP(C) No.613 of 2023. It is\n\nvehemently submitted that the second order dated 29.08.2023 was back-\n\ndated for the simple reason that both the State and private respondent\n\nNo.5 who appeared on caveat in WP(C) No. 613 of 2013 did not produce\n\nthe order dated 29.08.2023 during the course of hearing on 31.08.2023\n\nand the second impugned order dated 29.08.2023 was produced for the\n\nfirst time on 11.09.2023 by the State respondent during the course of\n\nhearing of WP(C) No. 613 of 2013. The petitioner also challenged the\n\nsubsequent order dated 29.08.2023 in WP(C) No. 634 of 2013 on similar\n\ngrounds as taken in WP(C) No. 613 of 2013 and additional ground of back-\n\ndated order.\n\n[20] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner\n\ndraws the attention of this Court to the order dated 09.03.2016 for re-\n\ndesignation and up-gradation, the order dated 08.08.2016 of posting on\n\nactual re-designation of the petitioner and others in the cadre of Deputy\n\nDirectors and the final seniority list of Deputy Directors dated 11.01.2023.\n\nIn the seniority list, the initial date of regular appointment is shown as\n\n02.03.2007 from the date of appointment as Data Analyst, while for other\n\nincumbents including the respondent No.5, same is shown as 05.01.2011.\n\nIt is submitted that there is no illegality in placing the petitioner as the\n\nsenior most Deputy Director. Learned senior counsel has pointed out that\n\nthe final seniority list is not stayed by this Court in the writ petition being\n\n Page 15\n WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 challenged by the respondent No.5 herein and only\n\npromotion done on the basis of this seniority list will be subject to its\n\noutcome. It is stated that the final seniority list of Deputy Directors can be\n\nconsidered for any including promotion, in-charge arrangement, etc.\n\n[21] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner\n\nfurther refers to the proceedings of the DPC dated 09.06.2023 for\n\npromotion to the post of the Joint Directors where the petitioner was\n\nrecommended at serial No.1 and the respondent No.5 at serial No.3 on the\n\nconsideration of the seniority, ACRs and other aspects and promotion\n\norder dated 15.06.2023. He submits that in view of Para 2.2 of the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 03.07.1986 issued by Department of Personnel &\n\nTraining, Govt. of India determining the seniority position of the promotees\n\nin the order in which they are recommended by the DPC. It is clarified that\n\nuntil a final seniority list which is different from the order recommended by\n\nthe DPC is issued by the competent authority, it will be safe to consider\n\nthe seniority list for the time being. Reference is made to the decision of\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nB. Thirumal v. Ananda Sivakumar\n:\n\n(2014) 16 SCC 593 @ Para 18, 19 & 23 to the point that if no selection\n\nprocedure is involved in upgradation, it is merely giving a financial benefit\n\nand cannot be considered as a promotion to higher post. It is stated that in\n\nthe case in hand, the order dated 09.03.2016 for re-designation and up-\n\ngradation, the order dated 08.08.2016 of posting on actual re-designation\n\nof the petitioner and others in the cadre of Deputy Directors, are nothing\n\nbut simple re-designation of the earlier posts as Deputy Directors and are\n\n Page 16\n not promotion orders. Hence, the petitioner will retain his seniority wef\n\n02.03.2007 while the respondent No.5 and other wef 05.01.2011. It is\n\nemphasised that the petitioner is seniormost both in the cadre of Deputy\n\nDirector as well as Joint Director.\n\n[22] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner\n\nexplains the object behind the Office Memorandum dated 03.10.2020\n\nwhere the Govt. of Manipur laying down the guidelines for making in-\n\ncharge appointment to a post where none in the feeder post is eligible for.\n\nHe refers to Para 4 of the OM and as per Para 4(ii), the seniormost in the\n\nfeeder cadre is to be made in-charge appointment till regular appointment.\n\nIt is further mentioned that the petitioner is seniormost in the cadre of\n\nDeputy Director as well as Joint Director. The impugned orders dated\n\n28.09.2023 and 29.08.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary (DP), Govt. of\n\nManipur allowing the respondent No.5 to look after the charge of Director\n\ntill appointment of a regular Director is void ab-initio as the same has been\n\nissued in violation of OM dated 03.10.2020. It is clarified that as there is no\n\nvigilance case or FIR against the petitioner, the OM dated 09.03.2021 will\n\nnot be applicable to the petitioner. Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel\n\nfor the petitioner vehemently submits that the OMS have statutory value as\n\nissued in exercise of power under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution. It is\n\npointed out that Para 4(iii) of OM dated 03.10.2020 will not be attracted at\n\nthe first instance and the same is to be resorted only when none is\n\navailable under Para 4(ii). With respect to the passing of the interim order,\n\nlearned senior counsel refers to the decisions reported as (2004) 4 SCC\n\n Page 17\n 697, (2007) 11 SCC 447 and (2009) 10 SCC 388. It is prayed that the\n\nimpugned orders dated 28.08.2023 and 29.08.2023 be set aside and the\n\npetitioner be made in-charge Director as stipulated under OM dated\n\n03.10.2020.\n\n[23] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State submits that\n\nthe OM dated 03.10.2020 is not issued under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution\n\nand hence it has no statutory value for strict compliance. Even if it is\n\npresumed to be applicable, Para 4(iii) of the OM has been invoked for\n\nmaking in-charge arrangement by a person holding same rank. It is\n\nclarified that the respondent No.5 is also holding the same rank as the\n\npetitioner, being promoted on the same day. In absence of final seniority\n\nlist in the feeder cadre of Joint Director, there is no wrong in preferring the\n\nrespondent No.5 considering his contribution and expertise in the filed of\n\nenvironment and climate change. Learned counsel submits that in absence\n\nof final seniority list, Para 4(ii) of the OM will not be applicable. Mr. Rarry,\n\nlearned counsel refers to a judgment dated 31.08.2023 passed by a\n\nlearned Single Judge of this Court in WP(C) No. 527 of 2023 where Mr. HS\n\nPaonam successfully argued that a junior can be made in-charge\n\narrangement on the basis of the same OM. Mr. HS Paonam however,\n\nclarifies that in the case cited herein, the senior was having vigilance case\n\nand was not considered in view of Para 4(v) of OM dated 09.03.2021.\n\n[24] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State further has\n\npointed out that there is no material to show that the second impugned\n\norder dated 29.09.2023 was issued backdated in order to frustrate the\n\n Page 18\n interim order dated 31.03.2023 passed in WP(C) No. 613 of 2023 staying\n\nthe first impugned order dated 28.08.2023. During the course of hearing of\n\nthese cases, learned counsel for State submits that one post of OSD\n\nequivalent to Director has been framed and offered to the petitioner. On\n\ninstruction, Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner\n\nrejected the offer. Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special Counsel for State relies on\n\nthe decisions of (2009) 12 SCC 175 @ Pr 18 [wrong provision or non-\n\nmentioning of provision does not make the order invalid], (1988) 4 SCC\n\n275 @ Pr 12,13&14 [whole text should be read from beginning to end while\n\ninterpreting any document], (2007) 10 SCC 548 @ Pr 25, (2003) 5 SCC\n\n604 @ Pr. 49, & (2003) 11 SCC 614 @ Pr 44 [seniority is not a\n\nfundamental right], (2008) 8 SCC 348 @ Pr. 16&17, & (2007) 3 SCC 470\n\n@ Pr. 5,7,12,18,19 [limited effect of interim order, if not extended], and\n\n(1988) 7 SCC 469 @ Pr. 8 [ case must establish on pleadings]. It is prayed\n\nthat there is no illegality in the impugned orders and the writ petitions may\n\nbe dismissed being devoid of any merit.\n\n[25] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. L.\n\nSevananda, learned counsel for the respondent No.5 has pointed out that\n\nthe impugned orders are not as per the Office Memorandum dated\n\n03.10.2020. It is clarified that for applicability of the OM, there should be an\n\nappointment of a person on in-charge basis at the first place. In the present\n\ncase, the first order 28.08.2023 has been superseded by the second order\n\ndated 29.08.2023 to rectify the mistake of considering the cadre Deputy\n\nDirector while all the incumbents are holding posts of Joint Directors. It is\n\n Page 19\n pointed out that in the second order dated 29.08.2023, the crucial word\n\n'appointment' is not used and the said order has been issued in the\n\nadministrative exigency. He further continues that even if the OM is\n\npresumed to be applicable for the sake of argument, but not admitting, the\n\nOM will not be applicable as there is no final seniority list in the cadre of\n\nJoint Directors. It is pointed out that the allegation of backdated order is not\n\nproved by any material. Learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 5\n\nrefers to Black Law Dictionary (4th Edition) with respect to the definition\n\nof appointment and Principle of Statutory Interpretation (14th Edition)\n\nby Justice GP Singh regarding giving plain and literal meaning to the\n\ncontents of the impugned order dated 29.08.2023. To emphasise his other\n\npoints, learned senior counsel refers to the case laws reported as 1991 (2)\n\nSCC 773, (2007) 4 SCC 737 and (2003) 4 SCC 289. It is further submitted\n\nthat judicial review does not lie against the administrative order issued in\n\nthe exigency of the service and in public interest, unless patent illegality on\n\nface of it is apparent. Accordingly, it is prayed that the writ petitions be\n\nrejected.\n\n[26] This Court considers the rival submissions made at bar, the\n\nmaterials on record and settled proposition of law. Since the pure question\n\nof law of applicability of OMs dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021 are\n\nconsidered on the admitted facts without calling for counter and rejoinder\n\naffidavits, this Court will not go into other allegations of back-dated order\n\nand final seniority list. The available seniority lists will be considered for the\n\n Page 20\n limited issue with respect to the OMs. It is clarified that the final seniority list\n\nof Deputy Directors is not stayed in WP(C) No. 289 of 2023.\n\n[27] On a bare perusal of the OM dated 03.10.2020, nothing is\n\nmentioned that it was issued in exercise of power under \nArticle 309\n of the\n\nConstitution. Hence, there is force in the submission of Mr. M. Rarry that\n\nthe same does not have statutory value. However, it will be necessary to\n\nexamine the object behind issuing the same. In Para 4 of the OM, it is\n\nstated that the same is issued \"... with a view to bring uniformly, clarity and\n\nenforceable norms in making such in-charge appointments...\" and Para\n\n4(ii) stipulates consideration of the seniormost in the feeder cadre and 4(iii)\n\nempowers State to appoint any other person when seniormost is not\n\navailable. This Court is of the view that Para 4(ii) has to be considered first\n\nif no eligible person as per Recruitment Rule is available and when such\n\nsenior person is not available, resort to Para 4(iii) may be made. In view of\n\nPara 4(v) of OM dated 09.03.2021, the seniormost incumbent may be\n\nignored, if there is vigilance or FIR case is pending against him, specially\n\nwith respect to in-charge appointment of Head of Departments. The OMs\n\nwill be binding in case of appointment of in-charge arrangement is to be\n\nmade. It is the considered opinion of this Court that OMs dated 03.10.2020\n\nand 09.03.2021 are binding on the State Government while making in-\n\ncharge appointment when such aspect are not found in the relevant rules.\n\nThe submission of Mr. M. Hemchandra that the impugned order dated\n\n29.08.2023 is not issued as per OM dated 03.10.2020 does not have any\n\n Page 21\n merit. The order dated 29.08.2023 is an in-charge appointment in disguise\n\nto frustrate the OMs and this submission is rejected.\n\n[28] Applying the facts of the present case to the views observed\n\nin Para 27 above, the writ petitions can be disposed of on the basis of\n\nmaterials available on record.\n\n[29] It is admitted that as on the petitioner is seniormost in the\n\ncadre of the Deputy Director, unless the final seniority list dated 11.01.2023\n\nis set aside finally in WP(C) No. 289 of 2023. Moreover, as per\n\nrecommendation of DPC held on 09.06.2023 for promotion to Joint Director\n\nand actual promotion order and posting dated 15.06.2023, the petitioner\n\ncan be considered seniormost tentatively until finalisation of seniority of\n\nJoint Directors, in view of Para 2.2 of OM dated 03.07.1986 issued by\n\nDoPT, Govt. Of India.\n\n[30] In the case of Government of AP v. AV Venugopala Rao:\n\n(1995) 1 SCC 159, Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld as rational and\n\nreasonable that pending finalisation of seniority list, seniormost eligible\n\nemployee in the provisional list could be made in-charge of the promotional\n\npost to avoid administrative hardship or heart burning among rival\n\nclaimants. Reading the ration of this case along with the OMs dated\n\n03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021, pending finalisation of the final seniority list of\n\nJoint Directors, the petitioner is at least provisionally seniormost in the\n\ncadre of the Joint Directors. This Court is of the view that the petitioner\n\n Page 22\n should be considered as Director on in-charge basis till appointment of a\n\nregular Director as no vigilance case or FIR is pending against him.\n\n[31] In the circumstances, the writ petitions are allowed and\n\nimpugned orders dated 28.08.2023 and 29.08.2023 are set aside. The\n\nState respondents are directed to appoint the petitioner as in-charge\n\nDirector (Envt. & CC), Manipur within a period of 15 days from the receipt\n\nof this judgment. No cost. Misc. applications, if any, are disposed of\n\naccordingly.\n\n[ 32] This Court appreciates the valuable assistance given by the\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the parties.\n\n[33] List WP(C) No. 289 of 2023 on 15.01.2024 for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n[34] Send a copy of this judgment to the respondent No.1 for\n\ninformation and doing needful.\n\n JUDGE\n\nFR/NFR\njoshua\n\n KH.
