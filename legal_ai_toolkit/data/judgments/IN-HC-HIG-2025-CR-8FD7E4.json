It is stated that from the WhatsApp chat of the deceased/Chhaya with\nher friend Alka D/o Rammehar Singh which was taken into possession\nthrough seizure memo proves that deceased/Chhaya was going through\nmental pressure and torture at her in-law's place for dowry and like\ndemands.\n\n3.8. It is stated that on 13.08.2023 three (3) accused namely Ombir\n(Father-in-law of deceased), Anita (mother-in-law of deceased) and\nShubham (husband of deceased) were arrested and sent to Judicial Custody.\n3.9.

Learned senior counsel for the Applicant states that the Applicant is\nthe father-in-law of the deceased.

He states that the investigation in the present case is complete and the\nchargesheet already been filed on 09.11.2023. He states that the Applicant\nhas been in custody for approximately 1 Year and 6 Months.\n4.3. He states that during investigation nothing incriminating came on\nrecord against the Applicant, there was only general and vague allegation\nagainst the Applicant with no specific role being mentioned in the FIR.\n4.4. He states that the testimony of the complainant i.e., the mother of the\ndeceased has already been recorded before the Trial Court.\n4.5. He states that the PM report would show that the injuries mentioned\nare only bruises and the said injuries could have been caused when the\nhanging dead body was being taken down.\n\n4.6. He states that though at the time when the incident is alleged to have\nhappened the father-in-law i.e., the Applicant, mother-in-law, sister-in-law\nand brother-in-law were present at the place of incident, but the said fact\ncannot be used to ascribe liability on the Applicant.\n4.7.

He states that Applicant is residing separately prior to the\nsolemnization of the marriage of deceased and his son.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 5 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\n4.9.

He states that the Registration Certificate (RC) of the\ni10 Car is in the name of Shubham.\n\nArguments of the State\n\n5. In reply, Mr. Khanna, learned APP states that the deceased was\nmarried to Shubham who is a co-accused in the captioned FIR and she\ncommitted suicide within four (4) months of her marriage.\n5.1. He states that the deceased/Chhaya was a graduate and an\noccupational therapist and was pursuing Masters Degree after her marriage.\n5.2. He states that the statement of mother of deceased/Chhaya was\nrecorded under\nSection 164\nof the Cr.P.C. He states that in the said statement\nshe disclosed the incidents of dowry demand made by the Applicant and the\nco-accused prior to and during the marriage of the deceased and co-accused\nShubham. He states that she also disclosed various incidents of cruelty and\ndowry demand made by the Applicant and co-accused persons after the\nmarriage and before the death of the deceased.\n\n5.3. He states that there is enough material available on record to invoke\nthe presumption of\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which is\napplicable to the cases under\nSection 304-B\nof the IPC. He states that the\nsaid essential ingredients are: (a) The death of the deceased with injuries in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 6 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\notherwise than under normal circumstance; (b) The death happening within\n7 years of marriage and (c) Cruelty or harassment in connection with the\ndemand of dowry soon before the death of the deceased.\n5.4. He states that the cause of death in the present case as per the PM\nreport was Asphyxia because of antemortem hanging. He states that there\nare several antemortem injuries present on the body of the deceased. He\nstates that as per the statement of the relevant witnesses including the\nmother and brother of the deceased the marriage between the deceased and\nthe co-accused was not going well because of the constant cruelty and\ndemand of dowry and therefore, the deceased committed suicide within four\n(4) months of the marriage.\n\n5.5. He states that the statement of Alka, friend of the deceased was\nrecorded wherein she stated that the deceased used to tell her during the\ncourse of their conversations that the in-laws of the deceased used to be\nangry because the family of the deceased did not give the Venue Car which\nwas demanded by them. He states that the said friend/Alka also disclosed\nthat once she met the deceased during her exam and saw blue bruises on her\narms which looked like marks of physical assault. He states that the\nWhatsApp chats between Chhaya and Alka have been placed on record with\nthe charge-sheet. He states that the deceased/Chhaya and Alka were\npursuing their Masters in Occupational Therapy together.\n5.6. He states that alternate charge under\nSection 302\nIPC was added at the\nstage of framing of charges because as per the evidence available on record\nit also seems that there is a possibility of the deceased having been beaten\nand then forcefully hung.\nBy the manufacturer Hyundai.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 7 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\n5.7. He states that the cheque of Rs. 7 Lakhs which was taken by\nApplicant herein at the time of farewell of the deceased/Chhaya from her\nparental home was deposited in the account of the deceased/Chhaya and\nthereafter, that amount was used for purchasing a i10 car of Rs. 8.5 Lakhs\n(approx.) in the name of co-accused Shubham, which goes on to prove that\nthe demand of dowry as mentioned in the statement of witnesses is correct\nand probable.\n\n5.8. He states that though the Applicant herein was allotted a Govt.\naccommodation at B-6, Type-4, T-6, B-6, NBCC Flat, Kidwai Nagar, East,\nand as per the inquiry it was revealed that the Applicant along with his wife\nused to visit to Applicant's permanent address i.e., A-64, Gali No.8,\nJagatpuri Extension Shahdara Delhi to stay with his son i.e., co-\naccused/Shubham and other family members on weekends and holidays.\n5.9. He states that there are total of 28 witnesses and 5 witnesses have\nalready been examined. He states that the case is at a very crucial stage as\nrelevant and material witnesses are yet to be examined i.e., Vijay\n(middleman), Jai Karan, father of the deceased and the friend/Alka. He\nstates that there are chances that if the Applicant is released on bail he might\nflee away from the process of justice and might influence the said relevant\nand material witnesses.\n\nArguments of the Complainant\n\n6. Mr. Verma, learned counsel for the complainant states that the\nexistence of ante-mortem injuries on the body of the accused are\ninconsistent with the version of the accused to the effect that the deceased\ncommitted suicide by hanging.\n\n6.1 He states that it is a matter of record that neither police nor any\nindependent witness saw the deceased hanging because as per the version of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 8 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\nthe accused they brought down the deceased from the fan and rushed her to\nthe hospital. He states that an examination of the crime scene upon\nreconstruction does not substantiate the theory of death by hanging and\ntherefore the Trial Court has rightly framed an alternate charge under\n\nSection 302\nIPC.\n\nAnalysis and conclusion\n\n7. This Court has heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused\nthe record.\n\n8. The chargesheet in the present case has been filed inter alia, for the\noffences punishable under\nSections 302\n/\n498A\n/\n/\n304B\n/\nof the IPC, since\nas per prosecution the Applicant along with his family met out the\ndeceased/Chhaya with cruelty, assault and dowry demands and the deceased\ndied by ante-mortem hanging at her matrimonial home, within 4 months of\nmarriage thereby attracting the presumptions under\nSections 113-A\nand\n113-\nB\nof the Indian Evidence Act.\n\n9. A Coordinate Bench of this Court in\nJayanti Prasad Goel v. Smt.\nSumitra Jain & Ors3\nwhile considering and application for cancelation of\nbail granted to the mother-in-law and sister-in-law in case where the bride\nhad burnt to death has observed that when a death takes place of a bride in a\nmatrimonial home the Court should be mindful of the magnitude and\nseriousness of the offence and should give due consideration to the provision\nof\nSections 113-A\nand\n113-B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in the\nexercise of jurisdiction, while granting bail.\n\n10. The deceased/Chhaya was a graduate pursuing a Masters degree in\noccupational therapy and a young woman of 26 years, who had recently\nbeen married barely four (4) months ago. The spirited nature of this young\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 9 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\nwoman is apparent from the WhatsApp chat produced by her friend Alka.\nThere is no evidence placed on record by the accused to explain why a\nyoung and educated woman would suddenly commit suicide as per the\naccused's version. The Applicant has not even attempted to offer a version\nand thus the Applicant has been unable to even prima facie rebut the\npresumption raised under\nSections 113-A\nand\n113-B\nof the Indian Evidence\nAct.\n\n11. The existence of ante-mortem external injuries on the\ndeceased/Chhaya as per the PM report, which are prima facie inconsistent\nwith the accused's version of death by hanging; as well as the statement of\nthe deceased's friend/Alka who stated in her statement to the police that she\nhad seen bruises on the deceased/Chhaya, when they met for the exam\nearlier are serious allegations, which have not been reasonably explained by\nthe Applicant. In this case, it is a matter of record that neither the police nor\nthe maternal family of the deceased/Chhaya saw her hanging as alleged by\nthe accused since as per the accused they brought her body down and rushed\nher to the hospital. The Trial Court has framed an alternate charge under\n\nSection 302\nIPC against the accused.\n\n12. The statement of the witnesses recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C.,\nthe WhatsApp chat between the deceased and her friend Alka; prima facie\nshow that the deceased was subjected to cruelty in pursuance to the demand\nof dowry for a Venue Car by the Applicant along with the other co-accused.\n\n13. The counsel for the Applicant during the course of argument has\nadmitted that the Applicant along with other co-accused was present in the\nmatrimonial house on the date when the crime/incident happened. The\nallegation for demand of a Venue Car in the dowry is specific and supported\nCRL.M(M) 1300/1992, at Para 7, 19 and 24.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 10 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\nby specific details and witness statements. The fact that the demand of\nVenue Car could not be fulfilled by the parents of the deceased has also been\nalleged specifically. In addition to the family members, the midde-man Vijay\nwho arranged the marriage and the deceased's friend Alka have also stated\nabout the said demand for the Venue Car by the Applicant herein. Both Vijay\nand Alka are independent witness and are yet to step into the witness box.\nTherefore, at this stage, the argument of the Applicant that there is no\nincriminating evidence against the Applicant regarding the motive or\ndemand of dowry being the cause behind death of the victim is unmerited.\n\n14. The learned senior counsel for the Applicant has raised the argument\nthat bail is rule and jail is exception and that the present Applicant has been\nin custody for more than 1.5 years and thus considering the right of speedy\ntrial enshrined under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India, the Applicant\nherein should be granted bail.\n\n15. The facts urged that chargesheet has been filed and the Applicant has\nbeen in jail for more than 1.5 Years and therefore he should be granted bail,\nhas to be tested in the light of the fact that, what would be the effect of the\norder granting bail in cases involving offences which are serious and\nheinous in nature, on the trial of the case (Re:\nIshwar Ji Nagaji Mali v.\nState of Gujarat4\n). The recognition of the menace of dowry and its evil\neffects on the society leading to unnatural deaths of young women does not\nrequire emphasis and is well recognized.\n\nIn this regards it would also be\nappropriate to refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nX v.\nState of Rajasthan5\n, wherein the Supreme Court held that in cases\ninvolving serious offences Court should not be lenient in granting bail as the\n(2022) 6 SCC 609 at Para 11.\n2024 SCC OnLine SC 3539.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 11 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\nsame impacts the trial. The relevant para of\nthe said judgment\nreads as\nunder:\n\n\"14. Ordinarily in serious offences like rape, murder, dacoity,\netc., once the trial commences and the prosecution starts\nexamining its witnesses, the Court be it the Trial Court or the\nHigh Court should be loath in entertaining the bail application\nof the accused.\n\n15. Over a period of time, we have noticed two things, i.e., (i)\neither bail is granted after the charge is framed and just before the\nvictim is to be examined by the prosecution before the trial court,\nor (ii) bail is granted once the recording of the oral evidence of the\nvictim is complete by looking into some discrepancies here or\nthere in the deposition and thereby testing the credibility of the\nvictim.\n\n16. We are of the view that the aforesaid is not a correct practice\nthat the Courts below should adopt. Once the trial commences, it\nshould be allowed to reach to its final conclusion which may\neither result in the conviction of the accused or acquittal of the\naccused. The moment the High Court exercises its discretion in\nfavour of the accused and orders release of the accused on bail\nby looking into the deposition of the victim, it will have its own\nimpact on the pending trial when it comes to appreciating the\noral evidence of the victim. It is only in the event if the trial gets\nunduly delayed and that too for no fault on the part of the accused,\nthe Court may be justified in ordering his release on bail on the\nground that right of the accused to have a speedy trial has been\ninfringed.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n16. The chargesheet in the present case has been filed on 09.11.2023 and\ncharges have been framed on 12.02.2024. Further five (5) witnesses have\nalready been examined and the trial is proceeding smoothly without any\nimpediment, with next date of hearing being 11.03.2025. The examination of\nVijay (the middleman), Jai Karan (father of the deceased) and Alka (the\nfriend of the deceased) is still pending and these are crucial public witness.\nThe counsel for the Applicant has not brought on record anything which\nwould go on to show to the contrary that there is delay in trial. Therefore,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned By:RASHMI DABAS BAIL APPLN. 4031/2024 Page 12 of 13\n\nSigning Date:26.02.2025\n\n18:47:18\n\nthe argument raised that trial is likely to take time cannot be a ground for\ngranting bail considering the offence involved and the allegations leveled\nagainst the Applicant.\n\n17. Therefore, considering the overall facts and circumstances of the\npresent case as well as the fact that the case of the complainant has been\nsupported by the witnesses examined so far before the Trial Court and taking\ninto the account the PM report of the deceased, and the discussion made in\nthe preceding paragraphs, coupled with the gravity of the offence, no ground\nfor grant of bail is made out at this stage.\n\n18. With the aforesaid directions/observations the present application\nstands dismissed along with pending application if any.\n\n19. Needless to mention, observations made in the present order are\npurely for the purpose of adjudicating the present application and shall not\nbe treated as an expression on the merits of the matter.\n\n20.
