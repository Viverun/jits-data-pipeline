Petitioners in W.P.(C) No.25723 of 2013 were\n\nappointed as Members of the Commission on various dates\n\nin 2010, 2011 and 2013. One of the petitioners in W.P.\n\n(C) No.28226 of 2007 had already retired in 2007 and\n\nthe other petitioners therein were sitting members at\n\nthe time of filing the writ petition in 2007. They are\n\naggrieved by the amendment effected in 2002 which took\n\naway the benefit which was conferred by the earlier\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:4:\n\namendment effected in 1998, based on which the members\n\nstarted getting the benefit of full pay as well as\n\npension attached to the post in which they were working\n\nprior to their appointment as members of PSC.\n\n3. The appointment of the Chairman and members of\n\nPSC are governed by\nArticle 316\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. As per the Proviso to\nArticle 316\n, one half of\n\nthe members of the PSC shall be persons who at the date\n\nof their respective appointments have held office for\n\nat least 10 years either under the Government of India\n\nor under the Government of the state. Clause 2 provides\n\nthat a member of PSC of a state shall hold office for a\n\nterm of 6 years from the date of assumption of office\n\nor until he attains the age of 62 years whichever is\n\nearlier. Clause 3 provides that a person who holds\n\noffice as a member of the PSC shall on the expiration\n\nof his term of office be ineligible for reappointment\n\nto the office.\nArticle 318\nprovides that in the case of\n\na State Commission, the Governor of the state may, by\n\nregulation determine the number of members of the\n\nCommission and their conditions of service; it further\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:5:\n\nprovides that conditions of service of a member of PSC\n\nshall not be varied to his disadvantage after his\n\nappointment. Under\nArticle 319\n, the Chairman as well as\n\nmembers of the State Public Service Commission shall be\n\nineligible for any other employment either under the\n\nGovernment of India or under the Government of the\n\nstate. Under\nArticle 322\n, the expenses of the state\n\nPSC including any salary, allowances and pensions\n\npayable to or in respect of members or staff the\n\ncommission shall be charged on the Consolidated fund of\n\nthe state.\n\n4. The Governor of Kerala has framed the Kerala\n\nPublic Service Commission (Composition and Conditions\n\nof Service of Members and Staff) Regulations, 1957\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'Regulations'), in exercise\n\nof powers conferred under\nArticle 318\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. As per regulation 4 of these\n\nregulations, the salary of the Chairman and other\n\nmembers were fixed as Rs.22,850/- per month and\n\nRs.22,500/- per month respectively (since revised)\n\nalong with DA and City Compensatory Allowance at the\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:6:\n\nrates admissible to the officers of the State Govt. As\n\nper clause 2 of regulation 4 it was provided that a\n\nmember who was holding a post under the Govt. of India\n\nor a State shall on appointment as Chairman or other\n\nmember receive salary and DA as mentioned in clause\n\n(1). However as per the proviso they would be allowed\n\nto draw their salary last drawn in Govt. of India\n\nservice or State Govt. service minus the pension\n\nincluding commuted value of pension and the pension\n\nequivalent of other retirement benefits throughout the\n\nperiod of their service in the Commission if the last\n\npay drawn by them during such service is higher than\n\nthe pay attached to the posts. Sub clause (ii) of\n\nClause 2 of that regulation further provides that the\n\nsalary mentioned in clause (1) shall be reduced by such\n\namount not exceeding the pension and the pension\n\nequivalent of other retirement benefits if any in case\n\nof appointment as Chairman or other member of a person\n\nwho has retired or deemed to have retired from service\n\nunder the Government, a Local Body, a University or\n\nPrivate College or an Aided School or any other body\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:7:\n\nwholly or substantially owned or controlled by the\n\nGovernment.\n\n5. Relevant portion of\nRegulation 4\nreads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"(1) There shall be paid to the Chairman a salary at\nthe rate of twentytwo thousand eight hundred and fifty\nrupees per mensum and to other members at the rate of\ntwentytwo thousand five hundred rupees per mensum.\n\nChairman and other members shall also be paid Dearness\nAllowance and City Compensatory Allowance at the rates\nadmissible to the officers of the State Government\ndrawing equivalent pay:\n\nxxxxxxx\n(2) A person who holds at the time of his appointment\nto the Commission is holding a post in the Government\nof India or Government of a State shall on appointment\nas Chairman or other Member, receive the Salary and\nDearness Allowance mentioned in Clause (1):\n\nProvided that such person shall be allowed to draw his\nsalary last drawn in the Government of India service,\nthe All India Service or the State service, as the case\nmay be, minus pension including commuted value of\npension and pension equivalent to other retirement\nbenefits throughout the period of his service in the\nCommission if the last pay drawn by him during such\nservice is higher than the pay attached to the posts:\nxxxxxxx\n(ii} In the case of an appointment as Chairman or other\nmember, of a person who has retired or deemed to have\nretired from service under the Government or local\nbody, a University or a private college or an aided\nschool or any other body wholly or substantially owned\nor controlled by government and who is on receipt or\nhas received or has become entitled to receive any\nretirement benefits by way of pension, gratuity,\ncontributory provident fund or otherwise his salary as\nmentioned in clause (1) shall be reduced by such amount\nnot exceeding the pension (including any portion of the\npension which may have been commuted) and pension\nequivalent of other retirement benefits if any.xxxxx\"\n\n6. Before the appointment of petitioners as\n\nMembers of the Commission, the 1st petitioner in W.P.(C)\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:8:\n\nNo.28226 of 2007 retired from service of State\n\nGovernment; the 2nd petitioner retired from a teaching\n\npost in an aided College and 3rd petitioner retired from\n\nthe University of Calicut. Petitioners 1 and 2 in W. P.\n\n(C) No.25723 of 2012 retired from service under the\n\nState Government and petitioners 3 to 5 retired from\n\nteaching posts in aided colleges. The grievance of the\n\npetitioners is that the regulations were once amended\n\nin 1998, pursuant to the judgment of the apex court in\n\nD.S Nakara V Union of India: AIR 1983 SC 130, for grant\n\nof full salary and full pension to the Chairman and\n\nMembers irrespective of the pension which they were\n\ndrawing on account of the past service. Prior to\n\namendment in 2002, sub-clause (ii) of clause (2) of\n\nRegulation 4\n, which was incorporated in the Regulations\n\nas per GO(P) No.648/98/GD dated 15.12.1998 (which is\n\nproduced as Ext.P2 in W.P.(C) No.28226 of 2007) reads\n\nas follows:\n\n(ii) in the case of an appointment as Chairman or\nother member, of a person who has retired or deemed to\nhave retired from service under the Government or local\nbody, a University or a Private College or an aided\nschool or any other body wholly or substantially owned\nor controlled by government and who is on receipt or has\nreceived or has become entitled to receive any\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:9:\n\nretirement benefits by way of pension, gratuity,\ncontributory provident fund or otherwise his salary\nshall be as mentioned in clause 1 and he shall be\neligible to receive such retirement benefits.\"\n\n7. The amendment brought about in 1998 enabling\n\nthe Chairman and Members to draw pension as well the\n\nsalary without any deduction was nullified in 2002,\n\nrestoring the position as existed prior to 1998, as per\n\nExt.P3 order issued on 23.10.2002 restoring the\n\nposition prior to 1998, in tune with the provisions\n\ncontained in Rule 100 of Part III KSR.\n\n8. Thus the grievance of the petitioners who are\n\npensioners by virtue of the service rendered by them\n\nunder the Govt.of Kerala/ Private aided\n\nColleges/University is that salary was being paid to\n\nthem after deducting the amount equivalent to the\n\npension they were drawing and they were getting only a\n\nmeagre amount towards salary though they are members of\n\na Constitutional body. The matter was taken up by the\n\nPSC before the Government pointing out that the\n\nattitude shown towards the petitioners who are members\n\nof a constitutional body by treating them on par with\n\nthose holding civil posts under the Government, was not\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:10:\n\nproper. However Government rejected the request of the\n\npetitioners as well as that of the PSC. The writ\n\npetitions are filed under the above circumstances\n\nseeking a declaration that the amendment brought about\n\nto subclause (ii) of Clause (2) of\nRegulation 4\nby way\n\nof Ext.P3 is unconstitutional pointing out that the\n\nmembers of the PSC cannot be equated to those holding\n\ncivil posts under the Government so as to invoke Rule\n\n100 of Part III KSR in fixing their pay.\n\n9. According to the petitioners appointment of\n\nhalf of the members of the PSC are made from among\n\nthose who have rendered 10 years service in\n\nState/Central Government as per\nArticle 316\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Therefore they cannot be\n\ntreated as reemployed persons.\n\n10. Respondents have filed a counter affidavit\n\nstating that the pay of the petitioners were fixed\n\ndeducting the pension they were drawing as revised from\n\ntime to time. It is stated that they have opted to draw\n\npension attached to the post they were holding prior to\n\ntheir appointment as Members of PSC, under clause 7A\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:11:\n\n(2) of the Regulations. It is stated that the amendment\n\nto regulation 4(2) was made subsequent to the\n\nmodification to rule 100 of Part III KSR which\n\ndispensed with the practice of getting dual benefit of\n\npension and salary at the same time on the\n\nreappointment of retired Govt. servant to the post of\n\nChairman and members of PSC. The amendment was effected\n\nonly prospectively. They get the same emoluments\n\nattached to the post of members/Chairman minus the\n\npension attached to their previous service and there\n\nwould not be any difference in the net emoluments. As a\n\nmatter of public policy Govt. had stopped the practice\n\nof granting dual benefits of pension and salary. Rule\n\n100 was amended and consequential amendment was made in\n\nsub clause(ii) of Clause 2 of regulation 4 of the\n\nRegulations prospectively in order to ensure that it is\n\nnot ultravires the provisions of the Constitution. As\n\nper\nRegulation 4\nthe pension and pensionary benefits\n\nequivalent to retirement benefits had to be deducted\n\nfrom the reemployment salary which was adopted in rule\n\n100. Though certain amendments were effected subsequent\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:12:\n\nto the judgment of the Apex court in D.S. Nakara V\n\nUnion of India: AIR 1983 SC 130, Rule 100 was amended\n\nand the same was incorporated in the Regulations.\n\n11. In the counter affidavit by PSC in WP(C) No.\n\n25723 of 2013, it is stated that the Chairman and\n\nmembers of the Commission who were appointed to hold\n\nconstitutional posts cannot be treated on par with\n\nemployees appointed under the Public Services or other\n\nActs or Rules and therefore there is no question of\n\nextension of rule 100 of Part III KSR, which applies\n\nonly in the case of those retired officers who are\n\nemployed in Public Services after retirement from such\n\nservices under Government. Therefore it is illogical to\n\ntreat them as re-employed pensioners for the purpose of\n\nregulating their service conditions. The power to fix\n\nthe conditions of service is vested only in the\n\nGovernor of the State under\nArticle 318\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Persons like petitioners\n\nappointed to a constitutional body are entitled to draw\n\npensionary benefits by way of the service rendered by\n\nthem and it is their statutory entitlement that cannot\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:13:\n\nbe reckoned as part of the salary due to them for their\n\nservice as member/Chairman. The salary of the\n\nmembers/Chairman is charged on the consolidated fund\n\nwhereas pension and gratuity is admissible for past\n\nservice is subject to vote by the legislature. It is\n\nalso pointed out that MLAs, MPs etc. who receive\n\npension from consolidated funds would continue to get\n\nfull salary. It is also pointed out that the duties and\n\nfunctions of the Chairman and members of the Commission\n\nare one and the same irrespective of the source from\n\nwhich they are appointed that is whether they were\n\nemployed or not before their appointment as members.\n\n12. The learned Counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners relied on the judgment of this Court in\n\nWP(C) No.11560 of 2012 and WP(C) No.3081 of 2013 and\n\nargued that petitioners cannot be treated as mere re-\n\nemployed hands and they are entitled to enjoy special\n\nprivilege, being members of a constitutional body.\n\n13. The learned Government Pleader relied on the\n\njudgments in\nGopinatha Pillai vs. State of Kerala\n:\n\n2004 (3) KLT 290, V.S.Mallimath vs. Union of India and\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:14:\n\nanother : 2001 (4) SCC 31, M.S.chawla and others vs.\n\nState of Punjab and another : 2001 (\n5) SCC 358 , Guru\n\nGobinda Basu vs. Sankari Prasad Ghosal\n:\nAIR 1964 SC\n\n254, Confederation of Ex-Servicemen Associations and\n\nothers vs. Union of India and others\n: 2006 (\n8) SCC\n\n399, Pashupati Nath Sukul vs. Nem Chandra Jain\n: 1984\n\n(2) SCC 404 and Ashraf M. vs. State of Kerala and\n\nothers : 2013 (2) KHC 559 and argued that the\n\npetitioners who are re-employed pensioners are entitled\n\nto get pay only after deducting the pension they are\n\ndrawing.\n\n14. Heard Sri.Jaju Babu, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for petitioner in W.P.(C) No.25273 of 2013,\n\nSri.S.P.Aravindakshan Pillai, the learned Counsel for\n\nthe petitioners in W.P.(C) No.28226 of 2007, Sri.\n\nKannan, learned Government Pleader and Sri.P.C.\n\nSasidharan, the learned Standing Counsel for the PSC.\n\n15. The question arising in these cases is whether\n\nthe pension drawn by petitioners by virtue of the\n\nservice rendered by them as employees under the State\n\nGovernment, aided Colleges and University can be\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:15:\n\ndeducted from the pay attached to that of the Member of\n\nPSC.\n\n16. From the pleadings it is clear that till the\n\nissuance of Ext.P2 in 1998 and thereafter from 2002,\n\nthe pay of the members who were drawing pension was\n\nbeing fixed after deducting the pension equivalent. It\n\nwould also appear that none of the petitioners have\n\nenjoyed the benefit of Ext.P2 amendment effected in\n\n1998, as all of them appear to have been appointed as\n\nMembers subsequent to the amendment effected in 2002.\n\nWhatever it may be it is necessary to examine whether\n\npension being drawn by petitioners was liable to be\n\ndeducted from the pay attached to the post.\n\n17. All the petitioners are drawing pension by\n\nvirtue of the service rendered by them in either State\n\nGovernment or aided Colleges/University. Pension is\n\nsanctioned to them and the pension sanctioned to them\n\nis regulated under the provisions contained in Part III\n\nKSR, as provided in Rule 1(a) of Part III KSR. In other\n\nwords all of them are governed by Part III KSR, based\n\non which they continue to draw pension. Chapter VII of\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:16:\n\nthe KSR deals with re-empoyment of pensioners. Under\n\nRule 92 of Part III KSR every employee who is re-\n\nemployed should be specifically called to the\n\nprovisions of this chapter by the authority re-\n\nemploying him, and by the Audit Officer whenever he\n\nbecomes aware of such an appointment. Rule 92 is\n\napplicable to any pensioner drawing pension under Part\n\nIII, irrespective of the post in which one is re-\n\nemployed/ appointed after retirement. Rule 100 as it\n\nexisted prior to 22.09.2009 reads as follows:\n\nThe pay of a re-employed pensioner will be fixed at an\namount equal to the difference between the pay drawn by\nhim at the time of his retirement and pension and\npension equivalent of other forms of retirement benefits\nadmissible to him, limited however, to the minimum of\nthe scale of pay of the post of re-employment, provided\nthat the pay plus pension and pension equivalent of\nother forms of retirement benefits shall not exceed\nRs.3,500. He will also be allowed to draw the full\npension in addition to the pay so fixed but will not be\ngiven temporary or adhoc increase in pension. He will\nget the basic pension besides the re-employment pay\nfixed under the rule plus full Dearness Allowance on the\nre-employment pay. No increment will be earned during\nthe period of re-employment, except in the case of\nmilitary pensioners re-employed in civil posts.\"\n\n18. After the amendment in 2009, relevant portion\n\nof Rule 100 reads as follows:\n\nThe pay of the re-employed State Government employee\nwhoretired from a post with pay scales currently in force\nwill be the pay drawn at the time of retirement minus basic\npension. In the case of others the pay drawn at the time of\nretirement would updated and fixed at the appropriate stage\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:17:\n\nin the scale of pay of the post held at the time of\nretirement or the scale of pay of the post of re-employment\nas the case may be, if it is a stage.xxxxxRe-employed\npensioners are entitled to the benefit of dearness\nallowance, city compensatory allowance, House Rent\nAllowance applicable from time to time on the pay before\nreducing pension but are not entitled to dearness relief on\npension. They will also be entitled to the benefit of\nannual increment with effect from first April 1992. Re-\nemployed pensioners are not eligible for stagnation\nincrements.\"\n\n19. In the case of the petitioners the Regulation\n\ngoverning them has incorporated the provisions in Rule\n\n100. But even in a case where there was no such\n\nprovision under the Kerala Consumer Protection Rules,\n\nthis court in the judgment in\nGopinatha Pillai vs.\n\nState of Kerala\n: 2004 (3) KLT 290 held that Rule 100\n\nwill apply to a pensioner who is re-employed. It was\n\nheld that the appointment of a District Judge as\n\nPresident of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum\n\ncannot be said to be not a re-employment.\n\nIn\nGopinatha\n\nPillai\n's case a retired District Judge who was\n\nappointed as the President of the Consumer Disputes\n\nRedressal Forum claimed that he is entitled to the pay\n\nattached to the post of President of CDRF, as provided\n\nin the\nConsumer Protection Act\nand the Rules framed\n\nunder it. In the light of the judgment in\nM.S.Chawla\n\nand others vs. State of Punjab and another\n: 2001 (5)\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:18:\n\nSCC 358 this court found that the pay has to be fixed\n\nin accordance with rule 100 of Part III KSR in the case\n\nof any re-employed pensioner.\n\nThe judgments in\nState of\n\nKerala vs. Govindankutty\n: 1999 (2) KLT 746 and\n\nGovindankutty vs. State of Kerala: 1996 (2) KLT 1007\n\nwas held not good law in the light of the judgment in\n\nM.S.Chawla's case. It was held that the provisions\n\ncontained in\nConsumer Protection Act\nor Rules cannot\n\nhave any overriding effect over Rule 100 of Part III\n\nKSR, in fixing the pay of re-employed pensioners,\n\naccording to which the pay of the re-employed pensioner\n\nhas to be fixed at an amount equal to the difference\n\nbetween the pay drawn by him at the time of his\n\nretirement and pension equivalent of other forms of\n\nretirement benefits admissible to him. Referring to\n\nrule 1 (a) of Chapter I of Part III KSR the Division\n\nBench observed that pension of all employees to whom\n\nthe Kerala Service Rules apply would be regulated by\n\nthe provisions in the general rules. Therefore the\n\nauthority competent to fix the pay and allowances of\n\nthe post to which the pensioner is re-employed has to\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:19:\n\ndetermine whether the pension shall be claimed wholly\n\nor partly and pay would have to be fixed on re-\n\nemployment at an amount equal to the difference between\n\nthe last pay drawn and pension admissible subject to\n\nthe minimum of the scale of pay of the post of re-\n\nemployment with a maximum limit of Rs.3500/-. It was\n\nheld that though the President of CDRF was appointed\n\nunder\nSec.10\nof the Consumer Protection Act, he\n\ncontinued to be a pensioner governed by the Kerala\n\nService Rules; the contention that\nConsumer Protection\n\nAct\nis a central enactment and therefore Rule 100 of\n\nPart III KSR could not have overriding power was\n\nrepelled. This Court found that as long as the\n\nPresident of the CDRF continued to be a pensioner\n\ngoverned by the provisions contained in the KSR his re-\n\nappointment pay would be governed by rule 100 of Part\n\nIII KSR and that the provisions of Consumer Protection\n\nRules would not have any overriding effect in the\n\nmatter of pay and allowances.\n\n20. In M.S.Chawla's case the provisions under the\n\nConsumer Protection Act\nwas considered with reference\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:20:\n\nto Punjab Civil Service Rules which contain provisions\n\nin pari materia with those in KSR and the apex court\n\nfound that the pension of the superannuated District\n\nJudges were governed by the Punjab Civil Service Rules\n\nwhich provides for fixation of pay on re-employment. It\n\nwas also held that the appointment of a District Judge\n\nafter his retirement cannot be said to be not a re-\n\nemployment.\n\n21. 10.\nIn\nV.S.Mallimath vs. Union of India and\n\nanother\n: 2001 (4) SCC 31 the apex court considered the\n\nclaim of the retired Chief Justice of this court for\n\ncomputation of salary in the post of Member of the\n\nNational Human Rights Commission, without deduction of\n\npensionary benefits. But it was found that the pension\n\nreceived towards the service rendered as Chief Justice\n\nof High Court must be treated as service in connection\n\nwith the affairs of the Union and the same was\n\ndeductible under Rule 3(b) of National Human Rights\n\nCommission Chairperson and Members (Salaries,\n\nAllowances and other Conditions of Service) Rules,\n\n1993. The writ petition was filed when salary was paid\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:21:\n\nto him only after deducting the pensionary benefits. As\n\nper rule 3(b) of the National Human Rights Commission\n\nChairperson and Members (Salaries, Allowances and other\n\nConditions of Service) Rules, 1993 a member is eligible\n\nfor salary equal to that of a Judge of the Supreme\n\nCourt. Under the proviso a member who is in receipt of\n\npension in respect of any previous service under the\n\nGovernment of the Union or Government of a State, his\n\nsalary shall stand reduced to the extent of the pension\n\nbeing drawn. Paragraph 4 of the judgment would show\n\nthat a contention was raised on behalf of the\n\npetitioner that the petitioner was holding the post of\n\nChief Justice of the High Court which is a\n\nconstitutional post and therefore no deduction can be\n\nmade, pointing out that the service rendered as a Chief\n\nJustice cannot be said to be service under the Union or\n\nof a State. But those contentions were not accepted in\n\nview of rule 3 (b) observing that a Judge of a High\n\nCourt belonging the third organ of the State, which is\n\nindependent of the other two organs namely the\n\nExecutive and the Legislature though occupies a unique\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:22:\n\nposition under the Constitution cannot have any impact\n\non fixing the pay on his appointment as a member of the\n\nHuman Rights Commission and it would not affect the\n\nindependence of the judiciary.\n\nIt was also observed\n\nthat the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India is an\n\nofficer under the Union Government, as held in\n\nGurugobinda Basu vs. Sankari Prasad Ghosal\n: 1964 (4)\n\nSCR 311. It was held that the expression Govt.\n\noccurring in rule 3(b) has to be construed in a wider\n\nsense and service rendered by a Judge or Chief Justice\n\nof High Court must be held to be a service in\n\nconnection with the affairs of the Union. There also it\n\nwas held that in the absence of any definition to re-\n\nemployment, it cannot be said that the appointment of\n\nthe petitioner as member of the NHRC is not a re-\n\nemployment.\n\n22. In the present case, it is true that the\n\nappointment of 50% of the members is to be done from\n\namong those who were in Central Government or\n\nGovernment of a State. Petitioners are persons who\n\nretired from the service of State Government as well as\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:23:\n\nfrom aided Colleges and University. However all of them\n\nare pensioners and they are drawing pension in\n\naccordance with the provisions contained in Part III\n\nof Kerala Service Rules. Though the conditions of their\n\nservice, on appointment as Members of PSC, are governed\n\nby the Regulations, it cannot be said that they are not\n\ndrawing pension in terms of the provisions in KSR. As\n\nper Rule 1(a) the pension of all employees to whom KSR\n\napplies are regulated by part III. As per Rule 2(ii) of\n\nPart I KSR, the Rules in KSR apply to every person\n\nemployed in whole time service of Government. Though\n\nRule 3 of Part I KSR excludes the persons for whom\n\nspecial provision is made governing their conditions of\n\nservice, the Regulations, 1957 which govern the service\n\nconditions of petitioners on their appointment as\n\nMembers, framed under\nArticle 318\n, incorporate the\n\nprovisions in Rule 100 of Part III KSR.\n\n23.\nArticle 318\nconfers power on Governor to\n\nregulate the pay and allowances and conditions of\n\nservice of the members. No restriction is imposed for\n\nexercising this power. The Regulations 1957 including\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:24:\n\nthe amendment carried out to it as per Ext.P3 are\n\nissued with due authority. While laying down the\n\nconditions of service provisions are made on par with\n\nrule 100 of Part III KSR, in such a way that the total\n\namount of pension along with the pay does not exceed\n\nthe pay admissible to the members of PSC, by deducting\n\nthe pension from the pay admissible under clause (1) of\n\nRegulation 4\n. When persons drawing pension are\n\nappointed as members there is nothing wrong in\n\nregulating their pay, as per regulation issued on par\n\nwith Rule 100 of part III KSR. Moreover Rule 92 as well\n\nas Rule 100 mandates that the authority appointing a\n\npensioner on re-employment or the audit officer shall\n\nalert such persons of the rules regarding the pay\n\nadmissible to them .\n\n24. When\nArticle 316\nprovides for appointment of\n\nhalf of the members of the Commission from among those\n\nwho had 10 years service in State Government or Central\n\nGovernment, nothing is stated regarding the eligibility\n\nfor pay or pension to such 50% of the members.\n\nTherefore as long as there is no dispute as to the\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:25:\n\nauthority to frame regulations there is nothing illegal\n\nor unconstitutional in regulating the pay of those\n\ndrawing pension, by way of Regulations incorporating\n\nthe principles underlying Rule 100 of Part III KSR\n\nlimiting their total emoluments including pay and\n\npension to a sum not less than the pay fixed under\n\nRegulation 4(1)\n. Such a provision is necessary to see\n\nthat there is parity in pay in the case of all the\n\nmembers appointed from different sources and to avoid\n\nthe possible disparity between those appointed from\n\nthose with 10 years drawing pension and full pay and\n\nthose appointed directly without pension but full pay\n\nonly.\n\n25. Though the judgments relied on by the learned\n\nGovernment Pleader do not relate to appointments after\n\nretirement to constitutional bodies, when the\n\nRegulation 4(2)(ii)\nitself is issued incorporating Rule\n\n100, the contention that Rule 100 of part III KSR would\n\nnot apply to them is irrelevant. Moreover the ratio of\n\nthe judgments in\nGopinatha Pilla\n's case, M.S. Chawla's\n\ncase, Retd Chief Justice V.S. Malimath's case (supra)\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:26:\n\nwill apply to the present case on all fours.\n\n26. Though the payment of the salary, allowances\n\nand pension of the members of PSC are to be made from\n\nthe consolidated fund of the State Government, under\n\nArticle 322\nof the Constitution, nothing prevents the\n\nrespondents from framing regulations which restricts\n\nthe drawing of full salary along with full pension.\n\nMoreover in the light of the dictum laid down in\n\njudgment in\nGurugobinda Basu\n's case (supra) reiterated\n\nin V.S. Malimath V Union of India (supra), it cannot\n\nalso be said that the petitioners are not governed by\n\nKSR on their appointment after retirement as members of\n\nPSC. The fact that amendment was effected in tune with\n\nthe amendment to Rule 100 does not make the provision\n\nunconstitutional in any manner.\n\n27.\nIn\nConfederation of Ex-Servicemen Associations\n\nand others vs. Union of India and others\n: 2006 (8) SCC\n\n547, relied on by the learned Government Pleader the\n\napex court was considering the claim made by ex-\n\nservicemen for medical facilities even after\n\nretirement. The apex court found that classification\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:27:\n\nmade between in service defence personnel and retired\n\ndefence personnel is reasonable. Apex court considered\n\nthe contention that the ex-servicemen cannot be\n\ncompared with retired Civilian Central Govt. employees.\n\nIf certain benefits extended to inservice employees are\n\nnot extended to retired employees, it cannot be\n\nsuccessfully contended that there is discrimination or\n\nviolation of\nArticle 14.\nIn case the classification is\n\nfounded on an intelligible differentia which must\n\ndistinguish persons or things that are grouped together\n\nand such a differentia has rational nexus to the object\n\nsought to be achieved by the statute or legislation, it\n\ncan be said that the classification has fulfilled the\n\ntwin test. Therefore it was held that the\n\nclassification between defence personnel and other than\n\ndefence personnel is also reasonable. The public policy\n\nunderlying Rule 100 of Part III KSR as well as\n\nsubclause (ii) of Clause (2) of regulation 4 are the\n\nsame. It cannot be said to suffer from any\n\nirrationality or unconstitutionality.\n\n28. At the same time it is pertinent to note that\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:28:\n\nsuch restrictions were in force except during the\n\nperiod from 1998 to 2002. It would also appear that the\n\nappointments of all the petitioners were subsequent to\n\nthe amendment in 2002. The issues which arose in WP(C)\n\nNo.3081 of 2013 and W.P.(C) No.12560 of 2012 are\n\nentirely different.\n\nIn the above circumstances, I am of the view that\n\nthe amendment effected in sub clause (ii) of Clause\n\n(2) of\nRegulation 4\ndoes not suffer from any\n\nunconstitutionality.\n\nThe writ petitions are dismissed.\n\nSd/-\n\nP.V.ASHA\n\nJUDGE\nrkc\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:29:\n\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nEXHIBIT P1 EXT.P1 COPY OF GO(P).NO.27/2011/GAD\nDATED 25.01.2011 ISSUED BY THE IST\nRESPONDENT\n\nEXHIBIT P2 EXT.P2 COPY OF GO(P)NO.316/2010/GAD\nDATED 14.09.2010 ISSUED BY THE IST\nRESPONDENT\n\nEXHIBIT P3 EXT.P3 COPY OF GO(P)NO.185/2013/GAD\nDATED 22.06.2013 ISSUED BY THE IST\nRESPONDENT\n\nEXHIBIT P4 EXT.P4 COPY OF GO(MS)NO.413/2010/GAD\nDATED 27.12.2010 ISSUED BY THE IST\nRESPONDENT\n\nEXHIBIT P5 EXT.P5 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP DATED\n15.6.2011 OF THE IST PETITIONER\n\nEXHIBIT P6 EXT.P6 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP DATED\n3.11.2010 OF THE 2ND PETITIONER\n\nEXHIBIT P7 EXT.P7 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP DATED\n13.05.2011 TE 3RD PETITIONER\n\nEXHIBIT P8 EXT.P8 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP DATED\n21.3.2011 OF THE 4TH PETITIONER\n\nEXHIBIT P9 EXT.P9 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP DATED\n05.09.2013 OF THE 5TH PETITIONER\n\nEXHIBIT P10 EXT.P10 COPY OF THE GO(P).NO.648/98/GD\nDATED 15.12.1998\n\nEXHIBIT P11 EXT.P11 COPY OF THE GO(P).345/2002\nDATED 23.10.2002\n\nEXHIBIT P12 EXT.P12 COPY OF THE DECISION DATED\n26.9.2011 OF THE KERALA PUBLIC SERVICE\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:30:\n\nCOMMISSION.\n\nEXHIBIT P13 EXT.P13 COPY OF THE REPRESENTATION\nDATED 26.09.2011 SUBMITTED BY THE\nCHAIRMAN OF THE KERALA PUBLIC SERVICE\nCOMMISSION TO THE IST RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P14 EXT.P14 COPY OF THE REPLY DATED\n12.3.2012 ISSUED BY THE IST RESPONDENT\nTO THE SECRETARY,KERALA PUBLIC SERVICE\nCOMMISSION\n\nEXHIBIT P15 EXT.P15 COPY OF THE REPRESENTATION\nDATED 16.12.2012 SUBMITTED BY THE\nPETITIONERS TO THE FINANCE MINISTER\n\nEXHIBIT P16 EXT.P16 COPY OF THE ADVICE OF THE LAW\nSECRETARY DATED 30.11.2012.\n\nEXHIBIT P17 EXT.P17 COPY OF THE ORDER\nNO.84594/SPL.E1/2012/GAD DATED 7.8.2013\nISSUED BY THE IST RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P18 EXT.P18 COPY OF THE\nGO(P)NO.25/2013/H.EDN DATED 31.01.2013.\n\nEXT.P19 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP NO.19/D/MB-62/7183\nDT.12.12.13 ISSUED TO THE 1ST\nPETITIONER.\n\nEXT.P20 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP NO.19/D/MB-62/7185\nDT.12.12.13 ISSUED TO THE 2ND\nPETITIONER\n\nEXT.P21 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP NO.19/D/MB-62/7181\nDT.12.12.13 ISSUED TO THE 4TH\nPETITIONER\n\nEXT.P22 COPY OF THE PAY SLIP NO.19/D/MB-61/7187\nDT.12.12.13 ISSUED TO THE 3RD\nPETITIONER.\n\nEXT.P23 COPY OF COMMUNICATION VIDE\nNO.P7/1011110618/1/979 DT.23.1.14\nISSUED BY THE 3RD RESPONDENT TO THE 1ST\nW.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE\n\n:31:\n\nPETITIONER.\n\nRESPONDENTS'\nEXHIBITS\n\nEXT.R1A TRUE COPY OF THE REPLY\n\nNO.74617/SPL.E1/2011/GAD DT.12.3.12\n\nEXT.R1B COPY 0F THE REPLY\nNO.84594/SPL.E1/2012/GAD DT.7.8.13\n\nEXT.R1C TRUE COPY OF THE REPLY\nNO.67349/SPL.E1/2012/GAD DT.27.9.12",
