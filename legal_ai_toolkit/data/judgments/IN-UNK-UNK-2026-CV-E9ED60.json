Of Nct Of Delhi) on 17 September, 2008\n\nAuthor: \nGita Mittal\n\nBench: \nGita Mittal\n\n IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI\n\n Crl.Rev.P. No.184/2009\n\n Date of decision: 17th September, 2008\n\n MANOJ KUMAR ... Petitioner\n through: Mr. Virendra Kumar, Adv. with\n Mr. P.K. Arya, Adv.\n\n VERSUS\n\n STATE (GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI) ....Respondents\n through: Ms. Fizani Husain, APP for the State\n with SI Jagdish Yadav, PS Subzi\n Mandi.\n\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MS. JUSTICE GITA MITTAL\n 1.Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed to\n see the Judgment? Yes\n 2. To be referred to the Reporter or not? Yes\n 3.Whether the judgment should be reported in the\n Digest? Yes\n\n GITA MITTAL, J (Oral)\n\n*\n\n1. By this petition, the petitioner assails an order dated 21st\n\nFebruary, 2009 passed by the learned ASJ whereby the court has\n\nadmitted the petitioner to bail subject to his furnishing a bail bond of\n\nRs.20,000/- with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of\n\nthe Metropolitan Magistrate with the condition that at the time of bail,\n\nthe applicant shall deposit a draft of Rs.2,00,000/- in court which shall\n\nbe released to either of the parties after completion of the trial.\n\n2. The principal ground of challenge to the order passed by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge is premised on a submission of lack of\n\njurisdiction of the learned court to impose such condition. It is urged\n\n -1-\n\n that there is no statutory provision nor any judicial pronouncement\n\nbased whereon the learned court would have the authority in law to\n\nimpose such condition upon a person at the time of granting bail to\n\nhim or her.\n\n3. In the instant case, the prosecution has contended that the\n\npetitioner stands implicated in a complaint lodged by the Punjab\n\nNational Bank, Subzi Mandi Branch, Delhi to the effect that he has\n\ntaken payment of Rs.98,000/- from their branch on 30th August, 2007.\n\nA complaint was lodged by the Punjab National Bank that one Ashok\n\nKumar has taken payment from their branch through a bearer cheque\n\nissued by Ajay Kumar from an account maintained at their branch\n\noffice at district Daurala, Meerut. During investigation, a co-accused\n\nSubhodh Kumar disclosed that the petitioner was his relative and they\n\nused to commit theft from the postal department as well as from\n\npersons involved in courier service. Demand drafts were removed\n\nfrom envelopes and after making alterations, the amounts of these\n\ndemand drafts were withdrawn by depositing them in fake and\n\nfictitious accounts opened in different banks. These considerations\n\nhave weighed with the learned Additional Sessions Judge who while\n\nadmitting the complaint to bail has imposed the condition of deposit of\n\nRs.2,00,000/- upon the petitioner.\n\n4. This petition has been necessitated for the reason that the\n\npetitioner has not complied with the condition and remains in judicial\n\ncustody since 19th September, 2008. The petitioner has contended\n\nthat he is the sole earning member of the family which consists of his\n\n -2-\n\n ailing mother. It is further contended that the learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge has accepted the position that he is not likely to flee\n\nfrom justice or tamper with witnesses.\n\n5. Ms. Fizani Husain, learned APP for the State has contended that\n\napart from the instruments in question, the petitioner stands\n\nimplicated in 18 different cases relating to 18 cheques in the name of\n\ndifferent persons in Delhi and Rajasthan.\n\n6. These very submissions were placed before the learned court\n\nwhich has considered the matter and has passed the order dated 21st\n\nFebruary, 2009 admitting the petitioner to bail conditional on making\n\nthe above deposit. The challenge in the present case is confined to\n\nthe imposition of the conditions of deposit of Rs.2,00,000/- with the\n\ncourt and the further direction that it could release this amount to\n\neither of the parties after completion of trial.\n\n7. The power to impose any condition while granting bail to any\n\nperson is to be found in \nSection 437\n of the Cr.P.C. which reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"437. When bail may be taken in case of non-\n\n bailable offence.\n\n 1[(1) When any person accused of, or suspected of, the\n commission of any non-bailable offence is arrested or\n detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a\n police station or appears or is brought before a court\n other than the High Court or Court of Session, he may be\n released on bail, but-\n\n (i) Such person shall not be so released if there\n appear reasonable grounds for believing that he\n has been guilty of an offence punishable with death\n\n -3-\n\n or imprisonment for life;\n\n (ii) Such person shall not be so released if such\n offence is a cognizable offence and he had been\n previously convicted of an offence punishable with\n death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for\n seven years or more, or he had been previously\n convicted on two or more occasions of a non-\n\n bailable and cognizable offence:\n\nProvided that the court may direct that a person referred\nto in clause (i) or clause (ii) be released on bail if such\nperson is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman\nor is sick or infirm:\n\nProvided further that the court may also direct that a\nperson referred to in clause (ii) be released on bail if it is\nsatisfied that it is just and proper so to do for any other\nspecial reason:\n\nProvided also that the mere fact that an accused person\nmay be required for being identified by witnesses during\ninvestigation shall not be sufficient ground for refusing to\ngrant bail if he is otherwise entitled to be released on\nbail and gives an undertaking that the shall comply with\nsuch directions as may be given by the court.]\n\n(2) If it appears to such officer or court at any stage of\nthe investigation, inquiry or trial as the case may be,\nthat there are not reasonable grounds for believing that\nthe accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but\nthat there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into\nhis guilt, 2[the accused shall, subject to the provisions of\nsection 446A and pending such inquiry, be released on\nbail], or, at the discretion of such officer or court on the\nexecution by him of a bond without sureties for his\nappearance as hereinafter provided.\n\n(3) When a person accused or suspected of the\ncommission of an offence punishable with imprisonment\nwhich may extend to seven years or more or of an\noffence under Chapter VI, Chatter XVI or Chapter XVII of\nthe \nIndian Penal Code\n 45 of 1860 or abetment of, or\nconspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offence, is\nreleased on bail under sub-section (1) the court may\nimpose any condition which the court considers\nnecessary-\n\n -4-\n\n (a) In order to ensure that such person shall attend\n in accordance with the conditions of the bond\n executed under this Chapter, or\n\n (b) In order to ensure that such person shall not\n commit an offence similar to the offence of which\n he is accused or of the commission of which he is\n suspected, or\n\n (c) Otherwise in the interests of justice.\n\n (4) An officer or a court releasing any person on bail\n under sub-section (1), or sub- section (2), shall record in\n writing his or its 3[reasons or special reasons] for so\n doing.\n\n (5) Any court which has released a person on bail under\n sub-section (1), or sub- section (2), may, if it considers it\n necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested\n and commit him to Custody.\n\n (6) If, any case triable by a Magistrate, the trial of a\n person accused of any non bailable offence is not\n Concluded within a period of sixty days from the first\n date fixed for - taking evidence in the case, such person\n shall, if he is in custody during the whole of the said\n period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the\n Magistrate, unless for reasons to be recorded in writing,\n the Magistrate otherwise directs.\n\n (7) If, at any time after the conclusion of the trial of a\n person accused of a non bailable offence and before\n Judgment is delivered the Court is of opinion that there\n are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is\n not guilty of any such offence, it shall release the\n accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a\n bond without sureties for his appearance to hear\n judgment delivered.\"\n\n8. Sub-\nSection 2\n of \nSection 438\n enumerates some conditions which\n\ncan be imposed while granting anticipatory bail and reads as follows:\n\n \"438 (2) When the High Court or the Court of Session\n makes a direction under sub- section (1), it may include\n such conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of\n the particular case, as it may thinks fit, including -\n\n -5-\n\n (i) A condition that the person shall make himself\n available for interrogation by a police officer and\n when required;\n\n (ii) A condition that the person shall not, directly or\n indirectly,- make any inducement, threat or promise\n to any person acquainted with the facts of the case\n so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to\n the court or to any police officer,\n\n (iii) A condition that the person shall not leave India\n without the previous permission of the court;\n\n (iv) Such other condition as may be imposed under\n sub-section (3) of \nsection 437\n, as if the bail were\n granted -under that section.\"\n\n9. This court had occasion to consider the expression \"such other\n\nconditions as the court considers necessary in the interest of justice\"\n\nin a judicial pronouncement reported at 2002 (3) JCC 1721\n\nJagmohan Singh Kataria & Anr. Vs. State of NCT of Delhi has\n\nbeen placed. Construing the statutory provisions, it was held that\n\nsuch conditions have to be read ejusdem generis to the conditions\n\nwhich are enumerated in sub-\nsection 3\n of \nSection 437\n or sub-\nsection\n\n2\n of \nSection 438\n of the Cr.P.C. The judicial principle which was laid\n\ndown by the court is that a criminal prosecution and threat of\n\nincarceration cannot be utilised as a tool for recovery of money from a\n\nperson who is implicated in the case. In this behalf, the observation of\n\nthis court in this precedent can be usefully adverted to and read as\n\nfollows:\n\n \"5. A careful consideration of the provisions of \nSections\n 437(3)\n and \n438(2)\n Criminal Procedure Code shows that\n conditions which can be imposed are primarily with a view\n\n -6-\n\n to ensure availability of the accused during investigation,\n enquiry or trial and his non-interference with the course of\n justice. Other conditions which Court may think fit can\n also be imposed but idea should be to ensure his\n presence as and when required and his non-interference\n with the investigation, enquiry or trial. It is obvious that\n other conditions should be \"ejusdem generis\" to the\n conditions which are already enumerated under \nSections\n 437(3)\n or 438 (2) \nCriminal Procedure Code\n proceedings\n for bail are not the forum for settlement of claims or\n recovery of outstanding dues. At the stage of\n consideration of bail, parties raise claims or counter-\n claims which are yet to be decided on merits. Therefore,\n there is every possibility of the Court falling into a serious\n error by imposing conditions requiring deposit of money\n or return of any specific property which issues are to be\n decided on merits in appropriate proceedings. That's why\n superior courts have often frowned upon the practice of\n imposing such condition while granting anticipatory bail or\n regular bail. In the caseof Sajani Khanna & Anr. Versus\n State 2002 (1) JCC 465, learned Additional Sessions Judge\n had imposed the condition of depositing a sum of Rs.15\n lacs in the form of FDR in the name of the trial court as\n security while granting anticipatory bail for the offence\n under \nSection 406\n/\n420\n IPC. Supreme Court observed that\n imposition of such condition was unreasonable. In the\n case of Sandeep Jain Vs. National Capital Territory of Delhi\n Rep. by Secretary, Home Deptt. 2002 (2) JCC (SC) 639\n while granting bail to the accused appellant for th e\n offence under \nSections 420\n and \n406\n IPC, learned\n Metropolitan Magistrate imposed some conditions. In\n compliance to these conditions, one of the sureties issued\n three cheques for Rs.2 lacs each to the complainant. On\n presentation these cheques were dishonoured. Wife of\n the complainant moved Court for cancellation of the bail\n whereupon bail was cancelled. Appellant was sent to\n prison. The Apex Court observed that such unreasonable\n conditions should not be imposed while granting\n bail/anticipatory bail.\n\n In view of the above, impugned order whereby the\n petitioners were required to submit a FDR of Rs.5 lacs as a\n pre-condition of bail is hereby set aside.\"\n\n10. This very issue also arose for consideration before the Division\n\nBench of this court in the judgment reported at\n\nMANU/DE/0094/2008=147 (2008) DLT 1=2008 (229) ELT 350\n\n -7-\n\n (Del) Raj Kumar Aggarwal Vs. Director General, Central Excise\n\n& Anr. The Division Bench placed reliance on the principles laid down\n\nby the Apex Court in (2001) 13 SCC 457 Sheikh Ayub Vs. State of\n\nM.P. and (2006) 9 SCC 169 Shyam Singh Vs. State and prior\n\njudgments of this and laid down the legal position as follows:-\n\n \"17. Considerable arguments had been generated on the\n question of imposition of conditions by the learned Single\n Judge. Our attention has been drawn to the use of these\n words inter alias under \nSection 437(3)\n and \n438(1)(b)(2)\n of\n the Cr.PC. We see no reason to make a distinction between\n the word conditions of bail or terms of bail either in the\n context of \nSection 167(2)\n or Chapter-XXXIII. They have\n been employed as synonymous of each other. \nIn\n \nSreenivasulu Reddy v. State of Tamil Nadu\n 7 (2000) CCR 96\n the accused had already deposited a sum of Rupees 35\n crore out of the Rupees 50 crore imposed in the Bail Order.\n Their Lordships had emphasised that while exercising\n jurisdiction under \nSection 438(2)\n of the Cr.PC, the Court\n ought only to impose such conditions/terms for enlarging\n an accused on bail as would ensure that the accused does\n not abscond. These conditions should not be intended or\n calculated to carry out and effect recoveries from the\n accused.\n \nIn \nSandeep Jain v. State of Delhi\n 1 (2000) SLT 368\n a direction to deposit Rs. 2 lacs apart from furnishing of a\n bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties was held to be\n unreasonable.\n In Sheikh Ayub v. State of M.P. (2004) 13\n SCC 457 the Supreme Court deleted the direction to\n deposit a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- , which was the amount\n allegedly misappropriated by the accused. \nSimilarly, in\n \nShyam Singh v. State\n (2006) 9 SCC 169 the condition that\n the accused should make a payment of Rs. 1,00,000/- per\n month after his release on bail was found by the Apex\n Court not to be justified. Their Lordships observed that\n while it is of course open to a Court to grant or refuse bail it\n was impermissible for it to assume that an offence has\n been committed even at the stage of grant of bail and to\n direct repayment of any amount is both onerous and\n unwarranted. The condition of depositing a sum of Rs.\n 1,00,000/- was struck down.\n \nIn \nAmarjit Singh v. State (NCT\n of Delhi\n) 2002(61) DRJ 67, after adverting to Sandeep Jain,\n the Supreme Court had recorded that we have no\n hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the imposition\n of condition to deposit the sum of Rs. 15,00,000/- in the\n form of an FDR in the Trial Court is an unreasonable\n\n -8-\n\n condition and, thereforee, we set aside the condition as a\n condition precedent for granting anticipatory bail.\n \nA\n Division Bench of this Court in \nM.R. Narayanan v. State\n\n 103(2003) DLT 434, applying the ratio in Sreenivasulu\n Reddy also concluded that conditions akin to deposit of\n money ought not to be imposed as a ground for grant of\n bail; that conditions/terms are imposed solely to ensure the\n presence of the accused at the time of trial. The only\n situation where money may be deposited in fact arises\n from the volition of the accused. This is where the required\n person by any Court to execute a bond instead elects,\n under \nSection 145\n of the Cr. PC, to seek permission from\n the Court to deposit a sum of money or Government\n promissory notes in lieu of executing a bond. This is so\n because a mere deposit of money may in some cases\n prove to defeat the purpose behind sureties being made\n available since the source of the monetary deposit is\n untraceable and an accused can abscond if he finds the\n deposit to be trivially incommensurate to his freedom.\"\n\n (underlined supplied)\n\n11. It is trite that the considerations which are required to weigh with\n\nthe court while considering the application seeking grant of bail are\n\nextremely well settled. Several judicial precedents are to be found\n\nspecially in the context of economic offences wherein a comparison is\n\ndrawn which relates to the financial amount involved in the offence.\n\nHowever, the imposition of a pre-deposit of an amount as a condition\n\nfor grant of bail has been repeatedly deprecated. It has been held\n\nthat imposition of such condition is not exercise of sound judicial\n\ndiscretion. (Ref. 2000 Crl.L.J. 464 Avinash Arora & Anr. Vs. State\n\nof UT of Chandigarh & Anr.)\n\n12. The courts have held that a condition which is imposed on a\n\nperson who stands incarcerated as a condition for bail would only\n\naggravate his situation and result in non-availability of the benefit of\n\nthe order of bail/anticipatory bail. The Apex Court has held that\n\n -9-\n\n imposition of such a condition is unreasonable and in a given case,\n\nmay be both onerous and unwarranted.\n\n13. It would appear that the situation where money may be\n\ndeposited may arise from the volition of the accused as for instance, a\n\nperson elects under \nSection 145\n of the Cr.P.C. to deposit money in lieu\n\nof executing a bond. However, the court has cautioned that in some\n\ncases, mere deposit of the money may be a device to defeat the\n\npurpose behind the requirement of sureties being made available to\n\nensure the appearance of an accused person. The source of the\n\nmonetary deposit is not available to the court and would be\n\nuntraceable. If the accused finds the deposit to be trivially\n\nincommensurate to his freedom, he would abscond. A solemn duty is\n\nthus cast on the court to take adequate care to ensure exercise of the\n\ndiscretion on the binding legal principles laid in the above\n\npronouncements so as to ensure the appearance of the accused\n\nperson while setting him at liberty.\n\n14. The petitioner remains in jail despite the order passed on 21st of\n\nFebruary, 2009 admitting him to bail because of his inability to comply\n\nwith the condition of deposit on account of pecuniary and financial\n\nhardship. The order does not reflect any connection between the\n\ncondition which has been imposed and necessity to ensure\n\nappearance of the applicant. In the light of the binding legal principles\n\nlaid down in the judicial pronouncements noted hereinabove, it has to\n\nbe held that the court had no jurisdiction to impose such a condition\n\nwhich was imposed while granting bail to the petitioner.\n\n - 10 -\n\n 15. Accordingly, it is directed that the order dated 21st February,\n\n2009, to the extent that it imposes the condition for deposit of the\n\namount of Rs.2,00,000/- by the petitioner, shall stand hereby set aside\n\nand quashed.\n\n16. It is further directed that as a result the applicant shall be\n\nreleased on bail subject to his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of\n\nRs.25,000/- with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of\n\nthe metropolitan magistrate/duty/link magistrate as directed by the\n\norder dated 21st of February, 2009.\n\n This petition is allowed in the above terms.\n\n Dasti.\n\nSeptember 17, 2009 Gita Mittal, J.\naa\n\n - 11 -",

It is obvious that\n other conditions should be \"ejusdem generis\" to the\n conditions which are already enumerated under \nSections\n 437(3)\n or 438 (2) \nCriminal Procedure Code\n proceedings\n for bail are not the forum for settlement of claims or\n recovery of outstanding dues.

Therefore,\n there is every possibility of the Court falling into a serious\n error by imposing conditions requiring deposit of money\n or return of any specific property which issues are to be\n decided on merits in appropriate proceedings. That's why\n superior courts have often frowned upon the practice of\n imposing such condition while granting anticipatory bail or\n regular bail. In the caseof Sajani Khanna & Anr. Versus\n State 2002 (1) JCC 465, learned Additional Sessions Judge\n had imposed the condition of depositing a sum of Rs.15\n lacs in the form of FDR in the name of the trial court as\n security while granting anticipatory bail for the offence\n under \nSection 406\n/\n420\n IPC. Supreme Court observed that\n imposition of such condition was unreasonable. In the\n case of Sandeep Jain Vs. National Capital Territory of Delhi\n Rep. by Secretary, Home Deptt. 2002 (2) JCC (SC) 639\n while granting bail to the accused appellant for th e\n offence under \nSections 420\n and \n406\n IPC, learned\n Metropolitan Magistrate imposed some conditions. In\n compliance to these conditions, one of the sureties issued\n three cheques for Rs.2 lacs each to the complainant. On\n presentation these cheques were dishonoured. Wife of\n the complainant moved Court for cancellation of the bail\n whereupon bail was cancelled. Appellant was sent to\n prison.

Our attention has been drawn to the use of these\n words inter alias under \nSection 437(3)\n and \n438(1)(b)(2)\n of\n the Cr.PC. We see no reason to make a distinction between\n the word conditions of bail or terms of bail either in the\n context of \nSection 167(2)\n or Chapter-XXXIII. They have\n been employed as synonymous of each other. \nIn\n \nSreenivasulu Reddy v. State of Tamil Nadu\n 7 (2000) CCR 96\n the accused had already deposited a sum of Rupees 35\n crore out of the Rupees 50 crore imposed in the Bail Order.\n Their Lordships had emphasised that while exercising\n jurisdiction under \nSection 438(2)\n of the Cr.PC, the Court\n ought only to impose such conditions/terms for enlarging\n an accused on bail as would ensure that the accused does\n not abscond. These conditions should not be intended or\n calculated to carry out and effect recoveries from the\n accused.\n \nIn \nSandeep Jain v. State of Delhi\n 1 (2000) SLT 368\n a direction to deposit Rs. 2 lacs apart from furnishing of a\n bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties was held to be\n unreasonable.\n In Sheikh Ayub v. State of M.P. (2004) 13\n SCC 457 the Supreme Court deleted the direction to\n deposit a sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- , which was the amount\n allegedly misappropriated by the accused. \nSimilarly, in\n \nShyam Singh v. State\n (2006) 9 SCC 169 the condition that\n the accused should make a payment of Rs. 1,00,000/- per\n month after his release on bail was found by the Apex\n Court not to be justified. Their Lordships observed that\n while it is of course open to a Court to grant or refuse bail it\n was impermissible for it to assume that an offence has\n been committed even at the stage of grant of bail and to\n direct repayment of any amount is both onerous and\n unwarranted. The condition of depositing a sum of Rs.\n 1,00,000/- was struck down.\n \nIn \nAmarjit Singh v. State (NCT\n of Delhi\n) 2002(61) DRJ 67, after adverting to Sandeep Jain,\n the Supreme Court had recorded that we have no\n hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the imposition\n of condition to deposit the sum of Rs. 15,00,000/- in the\n form of an FDR in the Trial Court is an unreasonable"

The only\n situation where money may be deposited in fact arises\n from the volition of the accused. This is where the required\n person by any Court to execute a bond instead elects,\n under \nSection 145\n of the Cr. PC, to seek permission from\n the Court to deposit a sum of money or Government\n promissory notes in lieu of executing a bond. This is so\n because a mere deposit of money may in some cases\n prove to defeat the purpose behind sureties being made\n available since the source of the monetary deposit is\n untraceable and an accused can abscond if he finds the\n deposit to be trivially incommensurate to his freedom.\""
