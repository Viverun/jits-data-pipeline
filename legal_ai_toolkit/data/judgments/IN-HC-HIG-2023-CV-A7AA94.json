The succinct distinction between 'venue' and 'seat' of\narbitration is one of the most hotly debated aspects of\narbitration in India, though for some time a quietus was put, to\nit, by a Five-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of Bhartiya Aluminium Company (for short, BALCO)\nVs.Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services INC1, but\nunfortunately after a decade of it's authoritative\n1 (2012) 9 SCC 552\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n2/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\npronouncement, once again the debate between the 'venue'\nand 'seat' has reappeared, in the wake of the latest decision of\nthe Supreme Court in the case of\nRavi Ranjan Developers Pvt.\nLtd. Vs. Aditya Kumar Chatterjee2\n.\n\n2. This enigma is placed before me through the present\ncase, where the counter arguments are advanced on issue,\nwhether prescription of mere, 'venue' in the arbitration clause\ncontained in the 'Lease Agreement' would confer jurisdiction\non this Court to appoint an Arbitrator, as prayed in the\napplication, particularly when the subject matter of the suit\nwould fall outside the jurisdiction of this Court.\n\n3. The applicant before me is a Private Limited Company,\nregistered under the provisions of the\nCompanies Act\n, inter\nalia, engaged in the business of manufacturing of Mustard oil,\nhaving it's plant at Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The respondent is\nalso engaged in the business of production, processing and\npreservation of edible oil.\n\nThe applicant and the respondent entered into a Lease\nAgreement on 01/04/2019, wherein the Mustard Oil Plant\nbelonging to the applicant, and located in Rajasthan was leased\nout to the respondent, by executing a Lease Agreement in\nIndore (State of Madhya Pradesh).\n\nThe Lease Agreement executed on 01/04/2019, expired\non 31/03/2020 and the respondent came with an offer to\nextend the arrangement for a further period of seven years.\n\n2 2022 SCC OnLine SC 568\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n3/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nCorrespondence was exchanged between the parties for\nextension of the existing Lease and, ultimately on October 20,\n2020, the Lease Agreement was renewed and it became\neffective from 01/01/2021, where the monthly license rental\nwas agreed at Rs.3,00,000/- per month. However, the Lessor\nsought to terminate the said Agreement, by issuing a notice of\ntermination to the respondent, as contemplated in the Lease\nAgreement, by seeking vacant peaceful possession of it's\nmanufacturing plant, failing which it was notifed that the\nrespondent is liable to pay rent of Rs.15,00,000/- per month.\n\nThis notice was contested by submitting that the\ntermination is illegal and not binding. The notice period\nexpired on September 19, 2021 and on 13/10/2021, the\napplicant forwarded a notice for termination of the Lease\nAgreement and invoked arbitration on 24/11/2021 as per\nclause 20 of the Lease Agreement. The respondent con tested\nthe invocation of arbitration, by submitting it's reply.\n\n4. Since the disputes arose between the applicant and the\nrespondent, out of the Lease Agreement, which comprised of\nclause for referring the disputes for arbitration and since the\nparties failed to reach a consensus to negotiate the arbitration\nproceedings, within 30 days of the invocation notice, the\napplicant has approached this Court, with a request to\nexercise the power of the Court under sub-section (6) of\nSection 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for\nshort, \"The Act of 1996\")\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n4/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n5.

The learned counsel for the applicant would justify the\nrelief, for appointment of a sole Arbitrator, at the hands of this\nCourt, by relying upon the following decisions of the Apex\nCourt, which according to him, has sealed the position of law,\nto the effect that the seat of arbitration is it's centre of gravity,\nas\nlaid down by\nthe Constitution Bench in the case of BALCO\n(supra). Reliance is placed particularly on paragraphs 96 to\n98 of the law report.\n\nReliance is also placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of\nBrahmani River Pellets Limited Vs.\nKamachi Industries Limited3\n, where once again the party\nautonomy contemplated under\nSection 20\nof the Act of 1996,\ncame to be recognised and it was held that the intention of the\nparties to confer jurisdiction upon a particular Court would be\nindicative of implied exclusion of jurisdiction of other Courts.\n\nAccording to the learned counsel, it was held in the facts\nof the case that when the parties have agreed that the 'venue'\nof arbitration shall be at Bhubaneshwar, the intention of the\nparties is to exclude all other Courts and, therefore, it was held\nthat the Madras High Court has erred in assuming the\n\n3 (2020) 5 SCC 462\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n5/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act of 1996, since only\nthe Orissa High Court could have entertained the application\nfled under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n7. Further the learned counsel Mr.Chandran would press\ninto service the decision of Three-Judge Bench of the Apex\nCourt in the case of BGS SGS Soma JV Vs.NHPC Limited 4,\nwhere the concept of 'seat' was once again focused upon and in\nthe background facts, it was specifcally held as under:-\n\n\"wherever there is a expressed designation of a 'venue' and no\ndesignation of any alternative place as the 'seat', combined\nwith a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration\nand no other signifcant, contrary indicia, the inexorable\nconclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical\nseat of the arbitral proceedings\".\n\nBy gainfully relying upon the observations in the law\nreport, where it was concluded that when both the parties\nhave chosen the Court at New Delhi to have exclusive\njurisdiction, the fact that the part of cause of action may have\narisen in Faridabad, was held to be of no relevance.\n\nReliance is also placed upon\nMankastu Impex Private\nLimited Vs. Airvisual Limited5\n, where the shashoua test was\nreiterated, by relying upon the decision in the case of BGS SGS\nSoma JV (supra).\n\nThe decision of the learned single Judge of this Court in\nthe case of\nPriya Malay Sheth Vs. VLCC Health Care Ltd.\n(citation) is also cited, and according to the learned counsel,\n\n4 (2020) 4 SCC 234\n5 (2020) 5 SCC 399\n6 Comm.Arb.App.(L) No.3094/22 decided on 06/06/2022\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n6/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nJustice G.S.Kulkarni has rightly captured the essence of the\nexisting position of law, fowing through the authoritative\npronouncements of the Apex Court.\n\n8. The respondent resisted the application, seeking\nappointment of a sole Arbitrator, by contesting the same on\ntwo counts, the frst being that the Lease Agreement is\ninsuffciently stamped and also on the ground of lack of\njurisdiction in this Court to entertain the application, as\naccording to the learned counsel Mr.Vaishnav for the\nrespondent, the Lease Agreement comprise of a clause, under\nwhich, it is agreed that 'venue' of arbitration shall be Mumbai,\nbut Mumbai was never intended to be a 'seat' of arbitration.\nIt is sought to be argued that the claims sought to be projected\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal is for recovery of possession /\neviction of the respondent from the Mustard oil plant, which is\nsituated in Ganganagar, and since, the Lease Agreement is\nexecuted in Indore (State of Madhya Pradesh), this Court\nwould not exercise jurisdiction, as it is not a Court, as defned\nunder\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act of 1996.\n\nThe proposition propounded by the learned counsel, by\nrelying upon the authoritative pronouncements of the highest\nCourt of the country is, the term 'seat' and 'venue' have\ndifferent connotations and cannot be used interchangeably.\nReliance is also placed upon the Constitution Bench decision\nin the case of BALCO (supra) to bolster his argument that it\nhas been categorically held by the Apex Court that the terms\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n7/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n'seat' and 'venue' have different meanings and these two\nterms cannot be used interchangeably.\n\nThe learned counsel would further submit that Law\nCommission of India in it's 246th report gave a suggestion for\nsubstituting the term 'place', in\nsection 20(2)\nwith 'seat' and in\n\nsection 20(3)\nwith 'venue'. However, these changes are not\nimplemented in the 2015 Amendment and the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in\nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\nVs. Datawind Innovations Private Limited & Ors.\n7, has\ncategorically observed that such amendment was unnecessary\nin view of the BALCO (supra) judgment and it was noted that\nthe Law Commission specifcally adverted to the difference\nbetween 'seat' and 'venue' and has recommended so, but the\namended Act does not contain the above amendments.\n\nPresumably the BALCO (supra) in no uncertain terms has\nreferred to 'place' as 'juridical' seat for the purposes of\nSection\n2(2)\nof the Act. It further made it clear that\nSection 20(1)\n\nand\nSection 20(2)\n, where the word 'place' is used refers to\njurisdictional seat whereas in\nSection 20(3)\n, the word 'place' is\nequivalent to 'venue'. This being the settled law, it was found\nunnecessary to expressly interpret what the Constitution\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has already done by way\nof construction of the Act.\n\n9. The learned counsel, in support of the case of the\nrespondent, also placed reliance upon the decision of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mankastu Impex Private\n\n7 2017(7) SCC 678\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n8/42\nCARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nLimited\n(supra) and, in particular, on the following\nobservation :-\n\n\"20. It is well-settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of\narbitration\" cannot be used inter-changeably. It has also been\nestablished that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot\nbe the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they\nhave intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. The\nintention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined\nfrom other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the\nparties.\"\n\n10. The learned counsel would strenuously rely upon the\ndecision of the Apex Court in the case of\nRavi Ranjan\n(supra),\nwhere the question arose, whether the Calcutta High Court has\njurisdiction to pass an order appointing the Arbitrator in the\ncase, where the parties executed the Development Agreement\nfor a property situated at Muzaffarpur, Bihar and also\nregistered the Agreement in Muzaffarpur, but the arbitration\nclause provided that the seat of the Tribunal 'shall be at\nKolkata'.\n\nWhile allowing the Appeals, the Apex Court has, inter\nalia, observed that, Kolkata was only the venue for holding the\nseating of the Tribunal and 'venue' does not indicate the 'seat',\nsince particularly, when no agreement was arrived between\nthe parties, to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the\nCourt in Calcutta, which was only intended to be the 'venue'. It\nwas, therefore, held that Calcutta High Court lacks the\njurisdiction to entertain an application under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act of 1996 and it was held that an application cannot be\nmoved in any High Court in India, unmindful of the territorial\njurisdiction.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n9/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nThe learned counsel would submit that it has been\nspecifcally held, by the Two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court\nthat\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act of 1996 has to be harmoniously\nread with\nSection 2(1)(e)\nand construed to mean a High Court,\nwhich exercises superintendence/supervisory jurisdiction\nover a Court within the meaning of\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act.\n\n11. Assisted by the aforesaid authoritative pronouncements,\nthe learned counsel for the respondent would submit that this\nCourt has no jurisdiction to entertain the application in the\nwake of the peculiar facts involved in the present case, and\nmerely because the venue of arbitration has been decided to be\nin Mumbai, it cannot be construed as 'seat' of arbitration as\nthe plant is situated in Ganganagar and Bombay High Court\nwill have no territorial jurisdiction, as it is not a 'Court' within\nthe meaning of\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act of 1996.\n\nPer contra, the learned counsel for the applicant has\nrelied upon a decision in the case of\nBBR (India) Private\nLimited Vs. S.P.Singla Constructions Private Limited8\n\nANALYSIS OF SUBMISSIONS\n\n12. Before I proceed to deal with the rival contentions to\nascertain whether, this Court would be in a position to exercise\nit's power for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of clause\n20 of the Lease Agreement, it would be apposite to reproduce\nthe arbitration clause contained in the Agreement, which\nreads thus :-\n\n8 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 493\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n10/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n\"In case of any dispute/difference arising out of this\nagreement, the same shall be referred to the sole Arbitrator to\nbe appointed by the Lessee in consultation and approval with\nthe Lessor.

The statutory scheme compiled in the Act of 1996\nprovide for appointment of an Arbitrator by the Court, when\nthe circumstances enumerated in\nSection 11\nof the Act of\n1996, come into foreplay and in particular, where the parties\nto an agreement fail to arrive at the consensus regarding the\nappointment of the Arbitrator, and as contemplated by the\nappointment procedure agreed between the parties, one party\nfails to act as required or the parties or the two appointed\narbitrators fail to reach an agreement expected of them, or\nunder the procedure, a person, including an institution, fails to\nperform any function entrusted to him or it, on a request by\nthe parties, the High Court or the Supreme Court, as the case\nmay be, take such necessary measures as are warranted.\n\n14.\nThe Act\nof 1996 has defned certain terms and in\nSection\n, the term 'Court' is defned as under :-\n\n\"(e) \"Court\" means-\n\n(i) in the case of an arbitration other than intentional\ncommercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original\njurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in\nexercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having\njurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter\nof the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a\nsuit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to\nsuch principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\n\n(ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration,\nthe High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\njurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n11/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nforming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had\nbeen the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High\nCourt having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of\nCourts subordinate to that High Court.\"\n\n15.\nSection 20\nof the Act specify the place of arbitration and\nthe relevant Section reads thus :-\n\n\"20.

The discretion is left in the parties to agree upon the\nlanguage to be used in the proceedings and if there is no\nagreement, the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine the language\nto be used throughout the proceedings.\n\n17. The place of arbitration in terms of\nSection 20\nmay thus\neither refer to 'seat' or 'venue' and the legislature has carefully\nchosen not to apply the term, 'venue' or 'seat', but instead it\nhas used th e term 'place of arbitration'.\n\nThe term 'place of arbitration' itself carries two distinct\nmeanings;\nSection 20(1)\nand\n20(2)\nsignifying the seat of\narbitration, whereas notwithstanding sub-section (1) and (2)\nof\nSection 20\n, any indication to the location, as distinct from\nthe seat, where the Arbitral Tribunal would conduct it's\nproceedings, signifying the geographical location.\n\nDespite the importance of choice of a 'seat' in arbitration\nproceedings, it being a juridical concept, the arbitration\nagreements often apply the terms 'seat', 'venue' or 'place'\ninter-changeably and in such situation, it is left either to the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n13/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nCourt or Arbitral Tribunal to determine, which place would\namount to 'seat' of the arbitration.\n\n18. Indian jurisprudence on the subject of arbitration,\nundisputedly has witnessed divergent use, with regard to it's\nvarious fascets, including the subject-matter of arbitrability of\nthe dispute and the fne line of distinction between 'seat' and\n'venue'. Through various binding precedents, the highest\nCourt of this country, the Hon'ble Apex Court and various High\nCourts assigned distinct connotation to the term 'seat', 'venue',\n'place', but it was the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nthe case of BALCO (supra) examined the concept of 'seat' and\n'venue' and deduced an inference that they are distinct. It\noffered a clarifcation that although the arbitration\nproceedings may take place anywhere in the world, the seat of\nthose proceedings is located at a specifc Arbitral institution\nsuch as international commercial Court or another similar\nauthority, whereas the venue where the meetings are held,\nwould only refer to any geographical area, within which the\nparty can negotiate.\n\n19. The conundrum between the 'seat' and the 'venue'\nexpressedly featured in the case of BALCO (supra) before a\nConstitution Bench of the Apex Court, and in paragraph 75,\nTheir Lordships turned down the argument advanced, that Act\nof 1996 does not make seat of the arbitration as the centre of\ngravity and observed as under :-\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n14/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n\"75. We are also unable to accept the submission of the\nlearned counsel for the appellants that the\nArbitration Act,\ndoes not make seat of the arbitration as the centre of\ngravity of the arbitration. On the contrary, it is accepted by\nmost of the experts that in most of the national laws,\narbitrations are anchored to the seat/place/situs of\narbitration. Redfern in Paragraph 3.54 concludes states that\n\"the seat of the arbitration is thus intended to be its centre of\ngravity.\" This, however, does not mean that all the\nproceedings of the arbitration have to take place at the seat of\nthe arbitration. The arbitrators at times hold meetings at\nmore convenient locations. This is necessary as arbitrators\noften come from different countries. It may, therefore, on\noccasions be convenient to hold some of the meetings in a\nlocation which may be convenient to all. Such a situation was\nexamined by the court of appeal in England in Naviera\nAmazonica Peruana S.A. Vs. Compania Internacionale de\nSeguros del Peru wherein at p.121 it is observed as follows :\n\n\"The preceding discussion has been on the basis that\nthere is only one \"place\" of arbitration. This will be the\nplace chosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will\nbe designated in the arbitration agreement or the\nterms of reference or the minutes of proceedings or in\nsome other way as the place or \"seat\" of the\narbitration. This does not mean, however, that the\narbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings\nat the place of arbitration. International commercial\narbitration often involves people of many different\nnationalities, from many different countries. In these\ncircumstances, it is by no means unusual for an\narbitral tribunal to hold meetings or even hearings in a\nplace other than the designated place of arbitration,\neither for its own convenience or for the convenience of\nthe parties or their witnesses...... It may be more\nconvenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one\ncountry to conduct a hearing in another country, for\ninstance, for the purpose of taking evidence..... In fact\ncircumstances each move of the arbitral tribunal does\nnot of itself mean that the seat of arbitration changes.\nThe seat of arbitration remains the place initially\nagreed by or on behalf of the parties.\"\n\nParagraph 76, further recorded as under :-\n\n\"76. It must be pointed out that the law of the seat or\nplace where the arbitration is held, is normally the law to\ngovern that arbitration. The territorial link between the place\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n15/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nof arbitration and the law governing that arbitration is well\nestablished in the international instruments, namely, the New\nYork Convention of 1958 and the UNCITRAL Model Law of\n1985. It is true that the terms \"seat\" and \"place\" are often\nused interchangeably. In Redfern and Hunter on International\nArbitration, 5th Edn. (para 3.51), the seat theory is defned\nthus: \"The concept that an arbitration is governed by the law\nof the place in which it is held, which is the 'seat' (or 'forum'\nor locus arbitri) of the arbitration, is well established in both\nthe theory and practice of international arbitration. In fact,\nthe 1923 Geneva Protocol states:\n\n\"2. The arbitral procedure, including the constitution of\nthe arbitral tribunal, shall be governed by the will of the\nparties and by the law of the country in whose territory the\narbitration takes place.\"\n\n20. Dealing with the defnition of the term \"Court\", in\nparagraph 96, the Constitution Bench has remarked as\nunder :-\n\n\"96. .....\n\nWe are of the opinion, the term \"subject-matter of the\narbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject-matter of the\nsuit\". The term \"subject-matter\" in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nis confned\nto Part I. It has a reference and connection with the process of\ndispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having\nsupervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. Hence,\nit refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the\nseat of the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\nhas to be construed keeping in view the\nprovisions in\nSection 20\nwhich give recognition to party\nautonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by\nthe learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render\n\nSection 20\nnugatory. In our view, the legislature has\nintentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court\nwhich would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is\nlocated and the courts where the arbitration takes place. This\nwas necessary as on many occasions the agreement may\nprovide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be\nneutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts where the\narbitration takes place would be required to exercise\nsupervisory control over the arbitral process. For example, if\nthe arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties\nare from Delhi, (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n16/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nas between a party from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata)\nand the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order under\n\nSection 17\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996, the appeal against\nsuch an interim order under\nSection 37\nmust lie to the Courts\nof Delhi being the Courts having supervisory jurisdiction over\nthe arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This would be\nirrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed\nunder the contract were to be performed either at Mumbai or\nat Kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In\nsuch circumstances, both the Courts would have jurisdiction,\ni.e. the Court within whose jurisdiction the subject matter of\nthe suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of\nwhich the dispute resolution i.e. arbitration is located.\"\n\n21. While construing\nSection 20\n, which determine the place\nof arbitration, it was specifcally held as under :-\n\n\"98. .....A plain reading of\nSection 20\nleaves no room for doubt\nthat where the place of arbitration is in India, the parties are\nfree to agree to any \"place\" or \"seat\" within India, be it Delhi,\nMumbai etc. In the absence of the parties' agreement thereto,\n\nSection 20(2)\nauthorises the tribunal to determine the\nplace/seat of such arbitration.\nSection 20(3)\nenables the\ntribunal to meet at any place for conducting hearings at a\nplace of convenience in matters such as consultations among\nits members for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties.\"\n\nIn Paragraph 117 of the law report, the conclusion is drawn in\nthe following words :-\n\n\"117. It would, therefore, follow that if the arbitration\nagreement is found or held to provide for a seat/place of\narbitration outside India, then the provision that the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996\nwould govern the arbitration\nproceedings, would not make\nPart I of the Arbitration Act,\napplicable or enable the Indian courts to exercise\nsupervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration or the award. It\nwould only mean that the parties have contractually imported\nfrom the\nArbitration Act, 1996\n, those provisions which are\nconcerned with the internal conduct of their arbitration and\nwhich are not inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of\nthe English procedural law/curial law. This necessarily\nfollows from the fact that Part I applies only to arbitrations\nhaving their seat/place in India.\"\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n17/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n22. The Constitution Bench accepted that the parties could\nconfer jurisdiction on an unconnected/neutral forum to\nsupervise arbitration proceedings, but did not offer\nclarifcation, whether this choice would be the exclusive or\nnon-exclusive choice.\n\nThis clarifcation, however, came from the Apex Court in\nthe case of\nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n(supra)\nwherein it was clarifed that the contracting party would\nchoose an un-connected forum as a 'seat' and that would vest\nexclusive jurisdiction in the said Court to decide any dispute.\n\n23.\nIn the case of\nUnion of India Vs. Hardy Exploration and\nProduction (India) Inc.9\n, the parties entered into a production\nsharing contract containing an arbitration clause, which\nprovided that the \"venue of conciliation or arbitration\nproceedings....unless the parties otherwise agree, shall be\nKuala Lumpur...\" and that \"arbitration proceedings shall be\nconducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Model Law on\nInternational Commercial Arbitration of 1985....\"\n\nUnion of India challenged the arbitral award rendered in\nthe arbitration proceedings under\nSection 34\nof the Act before\nthe Delhi High Court on the ground that the arbitration clause\ndid not satisfy the seat of arbitration, but only specifed the\nvenue of arbitration as 'Kuala Lumpur' and, hence, New Delhi\nwas the 'seat' of arbitration.\n\nThe above claim was contested by Hardy Exploration\nand in the background facts, the Apex Court held that the\nchoice of Kuala Lumpur as a 'venue' did not mean that Kuala\n9 (2019) 13 SCC 472\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n18/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nLumpur was the 'seat' of arbitration. It was held that the mere\nchoice of venue could not by itself be construed as choice of the\nseat of arbitration; instead, venue could become the seat, if\nsometing else is added to it as a concomitant, though the Apex\nCourt did not deem it appropriate to identify as to what would\nbe the additional factors, which would be considered by it to\ndetermine, whether the choice of venue is to be treated as\nchoice of seat.\n\n24. After this decision, came the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of\nBrahmani River Pellets Limited\n(supra),\nwherein the arbitration clause in form of caluse 18 read thus :-\n\n\"18. Arbitration shall be under Indian Arbitration and\nConciliation Law 1996 and the Venue of Arbitration shall be\nBhubaneswar.\"\n\nIn paragraph 15, the Apex Court held as under :-\n\n\"15. As per\nSection 20\nof the Act, parties are free to agree\non the place of arbitration. Party autonomy has to be\nconstrued in the context of parties choosing a court which has\njurisdiction out of two or more competent courts having\njurisdiction. This has been made clear in the three-Judges\nBench decision in\nSwastik Gases (P) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn.\nLtd\n.\n\n15.1. In the said case, respondent-Indian Oil Corporation\nLtd. appointed M/s. Swastik Gases (P) Ltd. situated at Jaipur,\nRajasthan as their consignment agent. The dispute arose\nbetween the parties as huge quantity of stock of lubricants\ncould not be sold by the applicant and they could not be\nresolved amicably. In the said matter, Clause 18 of the\nagreement between the parties provided that the agreement\nshall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata.\n15.2 The appellant-Swastik invoked Clause 18 -\narbitration clause and fled application under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act before the Rajasthan High Court for appointment of\narbitrator. The respondent contested the application made by\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n19/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nSwastik inter alia by raising the plea of lack of territorial\njurisdiction of the Rajasthan High Court in the matter. The\nplea of Indian Oil Corporation was that the agreement has\nbeen made subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata and\nthe Rajasthan High Court lacks the territorial jurisdiction in\ndealing with the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n15.3 The designated Judge held that Rajasthan High\nCourt did not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act and gave liberty to\nSwastik to fle the arbitration application in the Calcutta High\nCourt which order came to be challenged before the Supreme\nCourt.\n\n15.4 Pointing out that the words like \"alone\", \"only\",\n\"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been used\nin the agreement and use of such words is not decisive and\nnon-use of such words does not make any material difference\nas to the intention of the parties by having Clause 18 of the\nagreement that the courts at Kolkata shall have the\njurisdiction, the Supreme Court held as under:-\n\n\"31. In the instant case, the appellant does not dispute that\npart of cause of action has arisen in Kolkata. What the\nappellant says is that part of cause of action has also arisen in\nJaipur and, therefore, the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High\nCourt or the designate Judge has jurisdiction to consider the\napplication made by the appellant for the appointment of an\narbitrator under\nSection 11\n. Having regard to\nSection 11(12)\n\n(b) and\nSection 2(e)\nof the 1996 Act read with\nSection 20(c)\n\nof the Code, there remains no doubt that the Chief Justice or\nthe designate Judge of the Rajasthan High Court has\njurisdiction in the matter. The question is, whether parties by\nvirtue of Clause 18 of the agreement have agreed to exclude\nthe jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or, in other words,\nwhether in view of Clause 18 of the agreement, the\njurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court\nhas been excluded?\n\n32. For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect\nof the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides\nthat the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the\ncourts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for\njurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like \"alone\",\n\"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been\nused but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make\nany material difference. The intention of the parties--by\nhaving Clause 18 in the agreement-- is clear and\nunambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n20/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\njurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone\nshall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of\njurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement, the\nmaxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play\nas there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal\nmaxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of\nanother. By making a provision that the agreement is subject\nto the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have\nimpliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the\ncontract specifes the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular\nplace and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the\nmatter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties\nintended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not\nhit by\nSection 23\nof the Contract Act at all. Such clause is\nneither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It\ndoes not offend\nSection 28\nof the Contract Act in any manner.\"\n\n25. Paragraphs 18 and 19 recorded the conclusion in the\nfollowing words :-\n\n\"18. Where the contract specifes the jurisdiction of the\ncourt at a particular place, only such court will have the\njurisdiction to deal with the matter and parties intended to\nexclude all other courts. In the present case, the parties have\nagreed that the \"venue\" of arbitration shall be at\nBhubaneswar. Considering the agreement of the parties\nhaving Bhubaneswar as the venue of arbitration, the intention\nof the parties is to exclude all other courts. As held in Swastik,\nnon-use of words like \"exclusive jurisdiction\", \"only\",\n\"exclusive\", \"alone\" is not decisive and does not make any\nmaterial difference.\n\n19. When the parties have agreed to have the \"venue\" of\narbitration at Bhubaneswar, the Madras High Court erred in\nassuming the jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\nSince only Orissa High Court will have the jurisdiction to\nentertain the petition fled under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, the\nimpugned order is liable to be set aside.\"\n\n26.\nIn this case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court deviated from\nthe decision in\nHardy Exploration\n(supra) holding that the\nparties' choice of the \"venue of arbitration\" is really that of the\n\"seat of arbitration\", though the Apex Court did not consider it\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n21/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nnecessary to examine whether there existed any\ncircumstances, justifying designation of venue as designation\nof seat.\n\n27. Thereafter, the Apex Court was once again confronted\nwith a similar issue in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) , wherein the\narbitration agreement specifed that, \"the arbitration\nproceedings shall be held at New Delhi/Faridabad\".\nIt is this\ndecision, in which the Apex Court declared it's earlier decision\nin\nHardy Exploration\n(supra) to be per incuriam, since it did\nnot follow the decision of the Five-Judge Bench in BALCO\n(supra), which approved the \"shashoua principle\".\n\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated the \"shashoua\nprinciple\" and laid down the following tests for determining\nthe 'seat' of arbitration :-\n\n\"1. Where the arbitration clause contains a choice of a place as\nthe venue of arbitration proceedings, the use of the\nexpression \"arbitration proceedings\" signifes that the entire\nproceedings would be held at such place, as opposed to one or\nmore hearings. In such case, the chosen venue is really the\nseat of the arbitration.\n\n2. Where the arbitration clause contains wording such as\n\"tribunals are to meet at or have witnesses, experts or the\nparties\" where only hearings are to be conducted at such\nplace, it would lead to the conclusion that, other things beings\nconsistent, the chosen venue is not the seat of the arbitration.\n\n3. Where the arbitration clause contains wording such as\n\"arbitration proceedings shall be held at\" at a particular\nvenue, this would indicate that the arbitration proceedings\nare anchored at such venue and accordingly, such venue is\nthe seat of the arbitration.\n\n4. In all these cases above, there must be no other\n\"signifcant contrary indicia\" which suggest that the chosen\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n22/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nvenue is merely a geographically convenient place for meeting\nand not the seat of the arbitration.\n\n5. In the context of an international arbitration, if a\nsupranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration, then\nthis would be a further indication that the venue is really the\nseat of the arbitration Similarly, in the context of a domestic\narbitration, the choice of the Act to govern arbitral\nproceedings would point towards the choice of venue being in\nreality a choice of seat.\"\n\nIn paragraph, 61, the Hon'ble Apex specifcally held that,\n\"wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and\nno designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\",\ncombined with a supranational body of rules governing the\narbitration, and no other signifcant contrary indicia, the\ninexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the\njuridical seat of the arbitration proceedings.\"\n\n28. In paragraph 82, it is specifcally held as under :-\n\n\"82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may\nbe concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place\nof arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the \"venue\" of\nthe arbitration proceedings, the expression \"arbitration\nproceedings would make it clear that the \"venue\" is really the\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression\ndoes not include just one or more individual or particular\nhearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including\nthe making of an award at that place. This language has to be\ncontrasted with language such as \"tribunal are to meet or\nhave witnesses, experts or the parties\" where only hearings\nare to take place in the \"venue\", which may lead to the\nconclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated\nis not the \"seat\" of arbitral proceedings,but only a convenient\nplace of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral\nproceedings \"shall be held\" at a particular venue would also\nindicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral\nproceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that the\nplace is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled\nwith there being no other signifcant contrary indicia that the\nstated venue is merely a \"venue\" and not the \"seat\" of the\narbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such\na clause designates a \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings. In an\ninternational context, if a supranational body of rules is to\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n23/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\ngovern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that\n\"the venue\", so stated, would be the seat of the arbitral\nproceedings. In a national context, this would be replaced by\nthe\nArbitration Act, 1996\nas applying to the \"stated venue\",\nwhich then becomes the \"seat\" for the purposes of\narbitration.\"\n\n29. Another decision of the Apex Court, which is relevant\nand which must be referred to is in the case of\nMankastu\nImpex Private Limited\n(supra), where the parties, an Indian\ncompany and a Hong Kong company had entered into a\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU), which stipulated In-\ndian law as governing law and specifed that the Court at New\nDelhi has jurisdiction for resolution of disputes by providing\nas under :-\n\n\"Arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" and \"place of\narbitration shall be Hong Kong\".\n\nWhen the dispute arose between the parties, the Mankastu\nImpex Private Limited approached the Supreme Court for\nappointment of a sole arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act of\n1996 and it was contended that the Courts at New Delhi shall\nhave jurisdiction and the seat of arbitration was New Delhi.\n\nRelying upon the decision in the case of\nHardy\nExploration\n(supra), it was argued that Hong Kong was only\nthe venue and not the seat.\n\nThe respondent -Airvisual, relying upon the decision in\nthe case of BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) , contended that Hong\nKong was the seat of arbitration, on the basis that the\narbitration agreement in the MoU specifcally provided that\nthe place of arbitration was Hong Kong.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n24/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nIn the wake of the rival contentions, it was held that\nmere reference to Hong Kong as the \"place of arbitration\" did\nnot signify that the parties had chosen Hong Kong as the seat\nof arbitration. Instead, the intention of the parties have to be\ndetermined by examining the rest of the arbitration\nagreement and their conduct, as the use of the words\n\"arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" in rest of the\nagreement clearly indicated that the seat of the arbitration\nwas Hong Kong and the Hong Kong law was the procedural law\nand, hence, the Indian Courts did not have jurisdiction.\n\n30. Once again in\nPASL Wind Solutions Private Limited Vs.\nGE Power Conversion Indian Private Limited10\n, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court clarifed the position in the case of\nMankastu\nImpex\n(supra), when it drew a parallel in the agreement\nbetween the parties, which provided for \"that dispute to be\nresolved in Zurich in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation\nand Arbitration of the ICC\". It was held that seat of arbitration\nis Zurich and this conclusion was derived upon one signifcant\nfactor, being the agreement between the parties provided that\nthe dispute shall be resolved in Zurich.\n\n31.\nIn this legal scenario, when the position of law was\ncrystallised as above, the Two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court\ndelivered it's decision in the case of\nRavi Ranjan\n(supra),\nwhere it determined a similar issue, in the backdrop of the fact\nthat the Development Agreement was entered into between\n10 (2021) 7 SCC 1\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n25/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nthe parties for development of the property situated at\nMuzaffarpur in Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta High\nCourt. The Development Agreement was also executed in\nMuzaffarpur and contained an arbitration clause, which read\nas under :-\n\n\"37. That in case of any dispute or difference between the\nparties arising out of and relating to this development\nagreement, the same shall be settled by reference of the\ndisputes or differences to the Arbitrators appointed by both\nthe parties and such arbitration shall be conducted under the\nprovisions of the\nIndian Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\nas amended from time to time and the sitting of the said\nArbitral Tribunal shall be at Kolkata.\"\n\n32. The facts placed before the Court reveal that, the\nrespondent moved an arbitration application in Calcutta High\nCourt, seeking appointment of an Arbitrator, but it was\nwithdrawn on technical grounds. It again fled a second\narbitration petition, wherein the appellant fled an affdavit\nquestioning the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High\nCourt, by submitting that Calcutta High Court has no\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain and determine the\napplication, as the agreement has been executed and\nregistered in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and the piece and parcel of\nland, subject matter of the agreement, was also situated in\nMuzaffarpur Municipal Corporation, outside Calcutta. It was\nalso objected on the ground that no part of cause of action has\narisen within the jurisdiction of the Court and, hence, the\nCourt in Calcutta had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain\nand determine the present application, as it is not a Court\nwithin the meaning of\nSection 2(i)(e)\nof the Act of 1996.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n26/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nMerely because a place of sitting was Kolkata was not\ndeterminative of the jurisdiction in Calcutta High Court was\nthe submission advanced.\n\nThe Calcutta High Court allowed the arbitration petition\nand appointed a sole Arbitrator. The said order was passed,\nsince the counsel for the parties did not dispute the existence\nof valid arbitration clause and agreed to appoint an Arbitrator\nto settle the disputes.\n\nIt was sought to be argued that the consent was given on\nbehalf of the appellant, without any instructions.\n\n33. The question which, therefore, arose for consideration\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court was, whether the Calcutta\nHigh Court had jurisdiction to appoint an Arbitrator. The\nanswer was given in the negative, in the following words :-\n\n\"20. The question in this case is, whether the Calcutta\nHigh Court had territorial jurisdiction to pass the impugned\norders. The answer to the question has to be in the negative\nfor the reason that the Development Agreement was\nadmittedly executed and registered outside the jurisdiction of\nthe High Court of Calcutta, the agreement pertains to\ndevelopment of property located in Muzzafarpur outside\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. The Appellant has its\nregistered offce in Patna outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta\nHigh Court. The appellant has no establishment and does not\ncarry on any business within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta\nHigh Court. As admitted by the respondent, no part of the\ncause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of Calcutta\nHigh Court.\"\n\n34. Further observation in paragraphs 26 to 28 is also\nrelevant, which read thus :-\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n27/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n\"26. Of course, under\nSection 11(6)\n,an application for\nappointment of an Arbitrator necessarily has to be moved in\nthe High Court, irrespective of whether the High Court has the\njurisdiction to decide a suit in respect of the subject matter of\narbitration and irrespective of whether the High Court at all\nhas original jurisdiction to entertain and decide suits. As\nsuch, the defnition of Court in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the A &\nAct would not be applicable in the case of a High Court\nexercising jurisdiction under Section 11 (6) of the A & C Act\nto appoint an Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal\n\n27. At the same time, an application under Section\n11(6) of the A & C Act for appointment of an Arbitrator/\nArbitral Tribunal cannot be moved in any High Court in India,\nirrespective of its territorial jurisdiction. Section 11(6) of the\nA & C Act has to be harmoniously read with Section 2(1)(e)\nof the A & C Act and construed to mean, a High Court which\nexercises superintendence/supervisory jurisdiction over a\nCourt within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the A & C Act.\n\n28. It could never have been the intention of Section\n11(6) of the A & C Act that arbitration proceedings should be\ninitiated in any High Court in India, irrespective of whether\nthe Respondent raised or carried on business within the\njurisdiction of that High Court, and irrespective of whether\nany part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of\nthat Court, to put an opponent at a disadvantage and steal a\nmarch over the opponent.\"\n\n35. By referring to the decision in the case of\nMankastu\nImpex\n(supra) and\nHardy Exploration\n(supra), the Hon'ble\nApex Court concluded as under :-\n\n\"46. In this case, the Development Agreement provided\nthat the sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal would be conducted\nin Kolkata. As observed above, the parties never agreed to\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court in respect of\ndisputes, nor did the parties agree upon Kolkata as the seat of\narbitration. Kolkata was only the venue for sittings of the\nArbitral Tribunal.\n\n47. It is well settled that, when two or more Courts have\njurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising out of an arbitration\nagreement, the parties might, by agreement, decide to refer\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n28/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nall disputes to any one Court to the exclusion of all other\nCourts, which might otherwise have had jurisdiction to decide\nthe disputes. The parties cannot, however, by consent,\nconfer jurisdiction on a Court which inherently lacked\njurisdiction, as argued by Mr.Sinha.\n\n48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not\nagree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the Courts in\nKolkata. It was not the intention of the parties that Kolkata\nshould be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata was only intended\nto be the venue for arbitration sittings. Accordingly, the\nRespondent himself approached the District Court at\nMuzaffarpur, and not a Court in Kolkata for interim protec-\ntion under Section 9 of the A & C Act. The Respondent having\nhimself invoked the jurisdiction of the of the District Court at\nMuzaffarpur, is estopped from contending that the parties\nhad agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta\nHigh Court to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the\nparties to the agreement construed the arbitration clause to\ndesignate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are\nconstrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently lacks\njurisdiction to entertain the application of the Respondent\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act. The High Court\nshould have decided the objection raised by the Appellant, to\nthe jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, to entertain the\napplication under Section 11(6) of A & C Act, before\nappointing an Arbitrator.\"\n\n36. Recently, in the case of\nBBR (India) Private Limited\n\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the issue,\nwhether the change in place of conducting arbitration due to\nappointment of new Arbitrator will shift the jurisdictional seat\nof arbitration. In this case, the arbitration agreement did not\nstipulate either the 'seat' or 'venue' and the sole Arbitrator\ndetermined the venue of proceedings.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court, relying upon BGS SGS Soma\nJV (supra), held that the reference to the venue of the\nproceedings was really a reference to the seat of the\narbitration and once the seat is fxed by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n29/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nunder\nSection 20(2)\n, it shall remain static and fxed, whereas\nthe venue can be moved to new location, but change of venue\ndoes not change the seat of arbitration and the Court held that,\nsubsequent hearings or proceedings at a different location\nother than the place fxed by the Arbitrator as the seat of\narbitration should not be treated as a change or relocation of\njurisdictional seat.\n\n37. The seat of arbitration is a juridical concept, which refers\nto the legal home of the arbitration and it assumes great\nsignifcance, since the seat would determine the procedural\nlaw applicable to the arbitration process. The Courts of the\nseat have exclusive jurisdiction over the conduct of arbitration\nexcept in relation to certain ancillary matters like grant of\ninterim relief and enforcement of arbitral award. As a result,\nthe seat of arbitration has primary jurisdiction over the\narbitration, with all other jurisdictions becoming secondary.\nThus, the seat is considered to be centre of gravity of\narbitration and it is often described as anchor for the\narbitration.\n\nIn contrast, the venue of arbitration is merely a\ngeographical location, where the parties and/or the Arbitral\nTribunal may fnd it convenient to meet or hold meetings, with\nlittle signifcance.\n\nWhen place of arbitration is referred to, it may either\ncover a 'seat' or a 'venue'.\nThe Act\nof 1996 do not defne the\nterms 'seat' or 'venue', but instead uses the term, 'place of\narbitration' in\nSection 20\nand this has been interpreted by the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n30/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nHon'ble Apex Court by referring to the two distinct meaning\nbeing assigned.\n\nHowever,\nSection 20(1)\n, which uses the expression\n'place' in the same context, in terms of the 'seat' i.e. the 'centre\nof gravity' of an arbitration, the same expression 'place' is\nused in the different context i.e. 'venue', which is a location for\nconducting meetings, hearings and consultations, which can be\nchanged in accordance with the convenience of the Arbitrators\nor the parties. Often, it result into a confusing state of affairs,\nwhen there is a reference to 'seat of arbitration', which\nindicate a legal system, which an arbitration can call it's\n'home', indicating not a physical location, but connection with\nthe legal system of a country, which has great signifcance in\nthe context of the international arbitration because the choice\nof 'seat' can effectively determine, what is the governing law of\narbitration. It would determine, whether Part I or\nPart II of\nthe Act\nof 1996 is applicable, but within a domestic framework\nof Indian Courts, the choice of seat as 'city' has no relevance to\nthe applicable system of law, which shall be always the Indian\nlaw irrespective of which city is chosen as 'seat'.\n\nPrior to the decision in BALCO (supra), a stipulation of\n'seat' in arbitration clause was not perceived to have bearing\npurely on domestic arbitration. A jurisdiction of a Court was\ndetermined by taking recourse to\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act of\n1996 and the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code,\n1908. However, the Five-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in\nBALCO (supra) clearly opined that the subject matter of\narbitration cannot be confused with the subject matter of the\nseat. The former has reference and connection with the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n31/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nprocess of dispute resolution. It was held that jurisdiction is\nvested in two courts i.e. the court having jurisdiction over the\ncause of action and the court where the arbitration takes\nplace. The Five-Judge Bench clothed the jurisdiction upon the\ncourts located at the seat of arbitration. Even in the purely\ndomestic context which in the Court's world do not otherwise\nexist, thus paving the way for the concept of 'seat' to assume\ncenter stage in domestic arbitrations, despite indication in the\nstatutory framework to the contrary. Persuaded to accept\nthat the party autonomy is supreme, the Constitution Bench\nfound it appropriate to extend it's scope in the domestic\narbitration too. This was attempted through para 96 of the\njudgment, focusing upon the concept of 'seat' in Indian\narbitration, by clearly carving out a term 'subject-matter of\narbitration', so as to identify the Court having supervisory\ncontrol over the arbitration proceedings, which was held to be\nessentially a Court of the 'seat of the arbitration' process.\n\nWhile emphasising on party autonomy, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, however, conferred upon jurisdiction on two\ndifferent Courts to exercise the power under the Act i.e. the\nCourt with supervisory jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration\nand the Court in whose jurisdiction the cause of action arose.\nThe observation in the case of BALCO (supra), in para 96,\nparticularly created confusion and led to conficting decisions\nof different High Courts.\nHowever, in\nEnercon (India) Limited\n& Ors. Vs. Enercon GMBH & Anr.11\n, the Apex Court once again\nruled to the effect that once a seat of arbitration has been fxed\nin India, it would be in the nature of exclusive jurisdiction to\n\n11 (2014) 5 SCC 1\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n32/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nexercise the supervisory powers over the arbitration process.\n\nIn\nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n(supra) , while the\nApex Court was dealing with the issue of exclusive jurisdiction\nwith reference to the seat of arbitration, it re-examined the\nconcept of 'seat' and 'venue' and the conclusion drawn was,\nonce a seat is designated, it is akin to exclusive jurisdiction\nclause and consequently, the Courts at the 'seat' are vested\nwith the exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers and\nregulate arbitral proceedings to the exclusion of all other\nCourts, including the Courts, where the cause of action arose.\n\nThe above principle was followed in\nBrahmani River\nPellets Limited\n(supra).\n\n38. The aforesaid authoritative rulings are, therefore,\nindicative of the fact that the Apex Court deviated from the\nconcurrent jurisdiction principle highlighted in paragraph 96\nof BALCO (supra) and held that the exclusive jurisdiction is in\nthe Court of 'seat' of arbitration. It was ultimately in BGS SGS\nSoma JV (supra), a Three-Judge Bench, speaking through\nHon'ble Shri Justice Rohinton Nariman (as His Lordship was\nthen), offered some stability to the contradicting trends by\nexpressly recording a fnding that there do not exist a concept\nof concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nThe Three-Judge Bench reiterated that once the parties\ndesignate the seat of arbitration, only the Courts governing the\nseat shall have exclusive jurisdiction to govern such\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n33/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\narbitration proceedings and the jurisdiction of all other Courts\nstand ousted.\n\nThe aforesaid observation came in the wake of the fact of\nan arbitration clause, which stipulated that arbitration shall\nbe held in New Delhi/Faridabad and 71 sittings were held in\nDelhi and the Award was passed in Delhi, which was appealed\nin District Court, Faridabad, Haryana. In paragraphs 60 and\n61, it is held as under :-\n\n\"60. The judgments of the English courts have examined\nthe concept of the \"juridical seat\" of the arbitral proceedings,\nand have laid down several important tests in order to deter-\nmine whether the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings has, in\nfact, been indicated in the agreement between the parties.\nThe judgment of Cooke, J., in Shashoua, states :\n\n\"34. London arbitration is a well-known phenomenon which is\noften chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as\nthe law of New York, governing the substantive rights of the\nparties. This is because of the legislative framework and\nsupervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are\nkeen to adopt. When therefore there is an express designation\nof the arbitration venue as London and no designation of any\nalternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational\nbody of rules governing the arbitration and no other signifcant\ncontrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that\nLondon is the juridical seat and English Law the curial law. In\nmy judgment it is clear that either London has been designated\nby the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the\narbitration, or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all\nthe relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in\naccordance with the fnal fall back provision of\nSection 3\nof the\nArbitration Act.\"\n\n61. It will thus be seen that wherever there is an\nexpress designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any\nalternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational\nbody of rules governing the arbitration, and no other\nsignifcant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that\nthe stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral\nproceeding.\"\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n34/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n39.\nIn paragraph 91 of the said law report, the principle laid\ndown in\nHardy Exploration\n(supra), was not approved, as it\nwas found to be contrary to BALCO (supra) and paragraphs 98\nand 99, it was specifcally recorded as under :-\n\n\"98. However, the fact that in all the three appeals before\nus the proceedings were fnally held at New Delhi, and the\nawards were signed in New Delhi, and not at Faridabad, would\nlead to the conclusion that both parties have chosen New\nDelhi as the \"seat\" of arbitration under\nSection 20(1)\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1996. This being the case, both parties have,\ntherefore, chosen that the courts at New Delhi alone would\nhave exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.\nTherefore, the fact that a part of the cause of action may have\narisen at Faridabad would not be relevant once the \"seat\" has\nbeen chosen, which would then amount to an exclusive\njurisdiction clause so far as courts of the \"seat\" are concerned.\n\n99. Consequently, the impugned judgment is set aside,\nand the\nSection 34\npetition is ordered to be presented in the\ncourts in New Delhi, as was held by the learned Single Judge\nof the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram. The appeals\nare allowed in the aforesaid terms.\"\n\n40. In BGS SGS Soma JV (supra), once again Shashoua\nprinciple was reiterated. In no uncertain terms, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court concluded that when a clause designates a\nvenue of arbitration and declare that arbitration shall be held\nat such a place, it indicates that venue is actually the seat,\ncoupled with the fact that there are no contrary signifcant\nindicia that 'venue' is not a 'seat'.\nThe judgment of\nHardy\nExploration\n(supra), was held to be contrary to the principle\n\nlaid down in\nBALCO (supra) and, hence, \"not being good law\".\n\nIt was categorically held that the Three-Judge Bench in\n\nHardy Exploration\n(supra), failed to apply the Shashoua\nprinciple to the arbitration clause in question and had it been\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n35/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\napplied, in the facts of the case, the answer would have been\nthat Kuala Lumpur, which was stated to be the 'venue' of\narbitration proceedings, would be governed by a supranational\nset of rules i.e. UNCITRAL Model Law, and there being no\nother contrary indicated, Kuala Lumpur would have been the\njuridical 'seat' of arbitration.\n\nBy construing that there is no contrary indication, where\nIndia was designated as 'seat' and the parties had chosen\neither New Delhi or Faridabad, as a place where the arbitration\ncould be held, considering the wordings, \"arbitration\nproceedings shall be held at New Delhi/Faridabad, India\" and,\nsince the clause did not state that it is the venue nor is the\nlanguage used \"the Tribunal may meet,\" or \"may hear\nwitnesses, experts or parties\", the use of word 'venue' is really\nthe 'seat' of the arbitral proceedings and, hence, New Delhi/\nFaridabad, India was designated as seat of arbitration under\n\nSection 20(1)\nof the Act of 1996 and, hence, it was held that\nthe Courts at New Delhi alone, would have exclusive\njurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.\n\n41.\nIn\nMankastu Impex Private Limited\n(supra), the Three-\nJudge Bench relied upon the principle\nlaid down in\nBALCO\n(supra) and focused upon the exclusive jurisdiction clause, the\nmoment 'seat' is determined in arbitration proceedings.\nConstruing a clause in the MoU stipulating that the MoU is\ngoverned by the law of India and the Courts at New Delhi shall\nhave jurisdiction, it was held that the the words did not mean\nto take away or dilute the intention of the parties in clause\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n36/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n17.2, where it was agreed that the arbitration shall be\nadministered in Hong Kong, since the words in clause 17.1 did\nnot suggest that the seat of arbitration is in New Delhi. Since,\nthe arbitration was seated at Hong Kong, the petition fled\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act of 1996 in New Delhi was held\nto be without jurisdiction and not entertained.\n\n42. The law has thus been crystallized to the above effect\nfrom the series of judgments and while this legal scenario was\nprevailing, when the decision delivered by the Two-Judge\nBench of the Appex Court in\nRavi Ranjan\n(supra) is carefully\nperused, it is apparent that Their Lordships dealt with the\npeculiar facts and on it's assimilation, considered the objection\nraised by the respondent in the reply that whenever there is\ndesignation of place of arbitration in the arbitration clause as\nbeing the 'venue', the expression \"arbitral proceedings\" would\nmake it clear that venue is really the 'seat'.\n\nIn the peculiar facts it is noted that the appellant fled\npetition under\nSection 9\n. Thereafter, the respondent moved\nan arbitration petition before Calcutta High Court, seeking\nappointment of Arbitrator, which was withdrawn for technical\nreasons and a second arbitration petition came to be fled once\nagain before the Calcutta High Court, which was allowed by\nappointing an Arbitrator and this appointment was challenged\nbefore the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\nWhile dealing with the issue, whether Calcutta High\nCourt had territorial jurisdiction to pass the impugned order,\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n37/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellant emphasised upon the\nproperty being located in Muzaffarpur, outside jurisdiction of\nCalcutta High Court and the appellant having it's registered\noffce in Patna.\nSection 2(1)(e)\n, defning the term 'Court', was\npressed into service and the argument advanced was, no suit\ncould have been fled in any Court over which the Calcutta\nHigh Court exercise the jurisdiction, as the suit admittedly\npertain to immovable property situated at Muzaffarpur in\nBihar, outside the territorial jurisdiction of Calcutta High\nCourt and no part of action arose in the jurisdiction of Calcutta\nHigh Court.\n\nThe crux of the matter is crystallized in paragraph 27,\nwhere it is recorded as under :-\n\n\"27.
