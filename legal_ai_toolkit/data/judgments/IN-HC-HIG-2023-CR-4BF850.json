Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.\n\n3. On the complaint of Shobha W/o Manjunath, on\n\n23.06.2023 FIR in Crime No.82/2023 was registered by the\n\nChickballapura Police Station, Chickballapura against one Lohith\n\nBabu and three others. Petitioner is arrayed as accused No.3 in\n\nthe FIR. In the complaint, it is averred that the complainant's\n\ndaughter - Thejaswini was married to accused No.1 - Lohith\n\nBabu on 07.02.2022. The complainant has stated that at the\n\ntime of marriage they had paid dowry to the accused persons\n\nas per their demand. Inspite of the same, the accused persons\n\nwere torturing and harassing her daughter. In this regard,\n\npanchayath was held and inspite of the same, the accused\n\npersons continued to harass and torture the complainant's\n\ndaughter. About 20 days prior to the complaint, complainant's\n\n-3-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:36605\n\nCRL.P No. 9281 of 2023\n\ndaughter - Thejaswini had suffered from typhoid fever, inspite\n\nof that the accused persons did not take her to the hospital.\n\n4. Thereafter, the complainant and her husband\n\nbrought their daughter to their home and got treated and on\n\n21.06.2023 they had left her in her matrimonial home. On\n\n23.06.2023 at about 10.00 a.m., the complainant was informed\n\nby her son that the complainant's daughter - Thejaswini was\n\nnot receiving the phone. She immediately telephoned the\n\naccused and he informed her that her daughter - Thejaswini\n\nhad committed suicide by hanging herself to a fan in a room.\n\nImmediately, the complainant and her family members went to\n\nthe house of Lohith Babu and thereafter, had approached the\n\npolice and filed the compliant, which has resulted in registration\n\nof FIR in Crime No.82/2023.\n\n5. During the course of investigation in the said case,\n\nthe petitioner was arrested on 23.06.2023. His bail application\n\nfiled in Crl.Misc.No.386/2023 before the I Addl. District &\n\nSessions Judge, Chikkaballapura, was dismissed on\n\n17.07.2023. Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court.\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:36605\n\nCRL.P No. 9281 of 2023\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\npetitioner is the elder brother of accused no.1 who is the\n\nhusband of the deceased. The petitioner is staying separately\n\nalong with his wife and children. Investigation in the case is\n\ncomplete and charge sheet has been filed. Accordingly, he\n\nprays to allow the petition.\n\n7. Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the bail\n\napplication.\n\n8. The complainant is the mother of the deceased -\n\nThejaswini. Thejaswini and her husband - Lohith Babu, who is\n\naccused No.1 in the FIR are stated to be residents of Ward\n\nNo.19 of the Chickballapur District, whereas the material\n\nproduced by the petitioner along the criminal petition would go\n\nto show that the petitioner and his wife - Shilpa were residing\n\nin a premises at Ward No.24 of Chickballapur District. The\n\ninquest mahazar would go to show that the body of Thejaswini\n\nwas found hanging in a room in her husband's house and the\n\ndoor of the room in which Thejaswini had hanged herself was\n\nbroke open and thereafter, the body was brought down and the\n\npost-mortem report of the Thejaswini would go to show that\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:36605\n\nCRL.P No. 9281 of 2023\n\ndeath was due to asphyxia as a result of suspension by the\n\nneck (antimortem hanging).\n\n9. This material prima-facie would go to show that\n\nThejaswini had died by committing suicide and she had left a\n\ndeath note before committing suicide. In the said note it is\n\nstated that the accused persons have tortured her, but there is\n\nno mention of any demand for payment of dowry either\n\nimmediately prior to she committing suicide or even earlier to\n\nthe same. For the purpose of attracting offence under\nSection\n\n304B\nof IPC there should be some material to show that the\n\naccused persons had harassed or tortured the deceased\n\nimmediately prior to she committing the act of suicide and such\n\nharassment or torture should be in respect of demand for\n\ndowry. Such material is not present in the death note of the\n\ndeceased. The petitioner who has no criminal antecedents is in\n\ncustody from 23.06.2023 onwards.\n\n10. Investigation in the case is complete and charge\n\nsheet has been filed. The allegation against the petitioner is\n\nrequired to be proved in full-fledged trial. Under these\n\ncircumstances, I am of the view that, petitioner has made out a\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:36605\n\nCRL.P No. 9281 of 2023\n\nprima facie case for grant of regular bail. Accordingly, the\n\nfollowing:\n\n::ORDER::\n\nThe petition is allowed.\n\nThe petitioner/accused No.3 is directed to be enlarged on\n\nbail in Crime No.82/2013 registered by the Chickballapura\n\npolice station, Chickballapura, for the offences punishable\n\nunder Sections 498A, 302, 304B, R/w 34 of\nIPC\nand\nSections 3\n\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, subject to the following\n\nconditions:\n\na) The petitioner shall execute personal\nbond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000 (Rupees One Lakh\nonly) with two sureties for the likesum, to the\nsatisfaction of the jurisdictional Court;\n\nb) The petitioner shall appear regularly on\nall the dates of hearing before the Trial Court\nunless the Trial Court exempts his appearance for\nvalid reasons;\n\nc) The petitioner shall not directly or\nindirectly threaten or tamper with the prosecution\nwitnesses;\n\nd) The petitioner shall not leave the\njurisdiction of the Trial Court without permission of\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:36605\n\nCRL.P No. 9281 of 2023\n\nthe said Court until the case registered against him is\ndisposed off.\n\nSD/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nNMS",
