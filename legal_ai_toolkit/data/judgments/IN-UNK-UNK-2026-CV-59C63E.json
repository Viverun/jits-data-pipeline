The Divi-\nsion Bench of the High Court struck down the Regulation,\nholding that the Regulation gave absolute, unbridled and\narbitrary powers to the management to terminate the services\nof any permanent or temporary employee, and such power was\nviolative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. Hence, the\nCorporation filed the appeal before this Court, by special\nleave.\n The validity of similar provisions in Para 522 of the\nShastri Award, rule 1(i) of the District Board Rules 1926,\nPart V, \nRegulation 13\n of Indian Airlines Employees' Service\nRegulations, \nRegulation 48\n of Air India Employees' Service\nRegulations and also the clause in the contract of appoint-\nment in respect of employees of Zilla Parishad and the New\nIndia Assurance Company, also came up for consideration in\nthe connected appeals and applications filed before this\nCourt.\n It was contended on behalf of the Delhi Transport Corpo-\nration that there was sufficient guideline in \nRegulation\n9(b)\n and the power of termination, properly read, would not\nbe arbitrary or violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution,\nthat the Court would be entitled to obtain guidance from the\npreamble, the policy and the purpose of the Act and the\npower conferred under it and to see that the power was\nexercised only for that purpose, that even a term like\n'public interest' could be sufficient guidance in the matter\nof retirement of a government employee, and such a provision\ncould be read into a statute even when it was not otherwise\nexpressly there, that it was well-settled that the Court\nwould sustain the presumption of constitutionality by con-\nsidering matters of common knowledge and to assume every\nstate of facts which could be conceived and could even read\ndown the section, if it became necessary to uphold the\nvalidity of the provision, that the underlying\n144\nrationale of this rule of interpretation, or the doctrine of\nreading down of a statute being that when a legislature,\nwhose powers were not unlimited, enacted a statute, it was\naware of its limitations, and in the absence of express\nintention or clear language to the contrary, it must be\npresumed to have implied into the statute the requisite\nlimitations and conditions to immunise it from the virus of\nunconstitutionality, that since every legislature intended\nto act within its powers, in a limited Government, the\nlegislature would attempt to function within its limited\npowers and it would not be expected to have intended to\ntransgress its limits, that the guidelines for the exercise\nof the power of termination simpliciter under \nRegulation\n9(b)\n could be found in the statutory provisions of the 1950\nAct under which the regulations had been framed, the pream-\nble; \nSections 19\n, \n20\n and \n53\n, the context of \nRegulation 9(b)\n\nread with Regulations 9(a) and 15, that even for the exer-\ncise of this power, reasons could be recorded although they\nneed not be communicated which would ensure a check on the\narbitrary exercise of power and effective judicial review in\na given case, ensuring efficient running of services and in\npublic interest and the regulations in question were paral-\nlel to, but not identical with, the exceptions carved out\nunder proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n, that even the power of\ntermination simipliciter under \nRegulation 9(b)\n could only be\nexercised in circumstances other than those in \nRegulation\n9(a)\n, i.e. not where the foundation of the order was 'mis-\nconduct', the exercise of such power could only be for\npurposes germane and relevant to the statute, that the\nprinciples of natural justice or holding of an enquiry is\nneither a universal principle of justice nor inflexible\ndogma and the principles of natural justice were not incapa-\nble of exclusion in a given situation, if importing the\nright to be heard has the effect of paralysing the adminis-\ntrative process or the need for promptitude or the urgency\nof the- situation so demands, natural justice could be\navoided; that the words \"where it is not reasonably prac-\nticable to hold an enquiry\" may be imported into the regula-\ntion, that where termination took place by the exclusion of\naudi alteram partem rule in circumstances which were circum-\nscribed and coupled with the safeguard of recording of\nreasons which were germane and relevant, then the termina-\ntion would not render the regulation unreasonable or arbi-\ntrary, and if the regulation was read in this manner it\ncould not be said that the power was uncanalised or unguid-\ned, that under ordinary law of \"master and servant\" the\nCorporation was empowered by the Contract of Service to\nterminate the services of its employees in terms thereof;\nthe Declaration in Brojo Nath's case that such a contract\nwas void under \nsection 23\n of the Indian Contract Act or\nopposed to public policy offending the Fundamental Rights\nand the Directive Principles was not sound in law; as a\nmaster, the Corporation had unbridled right\n145\nto terminate the contract in the interests of efficient\nfunctioning of the Corporation or to maintain discipline\namong its employees, and if the termination, was found to be\nwrongful, the only remedy available to the employees was to\nclaim damages for wrongful termination but not a declaration\nas was granted in Brojo Nath's case.\n On behalf of the workmen/intervenors, it was submitted\nthat provision of any rule that service would be liable to\ntermination on notice for the period prescribed therein\ncontravened \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution, as arbitrary and\nuncontrolled power was left in the authority to select at\nits will any person against whom action would be taken; that\n\nArticles 14\n, 19\n and \n21\n were inter-related and \nArticle 21\n did\nnot exclude \nArticle 19\n and even if there was a law providing\na procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty and\nthere was, consequently no infringement of fundamental right\nconferred by \nArticle 21\n, such law in so far as it abridged\nor took away any fundamental right under \nArticle 19\n would\nhave to meet the challenge of that Article, that violation\nof principle of natural justice by State action was viola-\ntion of \nArticle 14\n which could be excluded only in excep-\ntional circumstances, and, therefore, a clause which autho-\nrised the employer to terminate the services of an employee,\nwhose contract of service was for indefinite period or till\nthe age of retirement, by serving notice, and which did not\ncontain any guidance for the exercise of the power and\nwithout recording reasons for such termination, violated the\nfundamental rights guaranteed under \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n\nand \n21\n and principles of natural justice and was void under\n\nSection 2(g)\n of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and unforce-\nable under \nSection 2\n(hi; that since audi alteram partem was\na requirement of Article 14. and conferment of arbitrary\npower itself was contrary to \nArticle 14\n, the rule in ques-\ntion could not be sustained as valid; that the Constitution-\nal guarantees under \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n were for all persons\nand there could be no basis for making a distinction between\n'workmen' to whom the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n and other\nindustrial laws applied and those who were outside their\npurview, and the law applicable to the former could only add\nto and not detract from the rights guaranteed by Part 111 of\nthe Constitution; that the power to terminate the services\nof a person employed to serve indefinitely or till the age\nof retirement could be exercised only in cases of proved\nmisconduct or exceptional circumstances having regard to the\nConstitutional guarantee available under \nArticle 14\n,\n19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n and unless the exceptional circumstances\nwere spelt out, the power to terminate the services would\ncover both permissible and impermissible grounds rendering\nit wholly invalid, particularly because, the requirement of\naudi alteram partem which was a part of the guarantee of\n146\n\nArticle 14\n was sought to be excluded, and there could be no\nguidance available in the body of the law itself, since the\npurpose for which an undertaking was established and the\nprovisions dealing with the same in the law could provide no\nguidance regarding exceptional circumstances under which\nalone the power could be exercised, that the question in-\nvolved, in the instant cases was not the exercise of power\nwhich an employer possessed to terminate the services of his\nemployee, but the extent of that power; that provisions of\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi Road Transport Authority\n(Conditions of Appointment and Service) Regulations, 1952,\ncould not be rendered constitutional by reading the require-\nment of recording reasons and confining it to cases where it\nwas not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry and read-\ning it down further as being applicable to only exceptional\ncases would not be permissible construction and proper; that\nthe Regulation conferred arbitrary power of leaving it to\nthe DTC Management to pick and choose, either to hold an\nenquiry or terminate the services for the same misconduct\nand there was nothing in the provisions of the Act or the\nregulations from which the Management could find any guid-\nance and, therefore, in order to conform to the constitu-\ntional guarantees contained in \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n,\nthe regulation would have to make a distinction between\ncases where services were sought to be terminated for mis-\nconduct and cases of termination on grounds other than what\nwould constitute misconduct; that regulation 9(b) deliber-\nately conferred wide power of termination of service without\ngiving reasonable opportunity to an employee even if he was\nregular or permanent employee, in addition to regulation 15\nwhich provided for dismissal or removal after a disciplinary\nenquiry, thus, the intention of the regulation-making au-\nthority was clear and unambiguous; the provision was not\ncapable of two interpretations, and consequently, the ques-\ntion of reading down did not arise, and reading down in the\ninstant cases involved not interpretation of any single word\nin regulation 9(b) but adding a whole clause to it, which\namounted to rewriting the provisions, which courts had\nrefused to make up for the omission of the legislature, and\nwould inevitably drain out \nArticle 14\n of its vitality, and\nthe right to equality which was regarded as a basic feature\nof the Constitution, and subject permanent employees of the\nDTC to a tremendous sense of insecurity which is against the\nphilosophy and scheme of the Constitution, that unless the\nprovision of the Constitution itself excluded the principles\nof natural justice, they continued to be applicable as an\nintegral part of the right to equality guaranteed by the\nConstitution, that as the employees of the DTC were not\nGovernment employees, \nArticle 311(2)\n was not applicable, and\n\nArticle 14\n fully applied to them, including the principles\nof natural justice.\n147\n On behalf of the Indian Airlines Corporation and the Air\nIndia, which filed intervention applications, it was submit-\nted that there had been distinction between the discharge\nsimpliciter and dismissal from service by way of punishment,\nthat the effect of the judgments of this Court in the Cen-\ntral Inland Water's case and West Bengal's case was to take\naway the right of the employer to terminate the services of\nan employee by way of discharge simpliciter, that this Court\nhad recognised the existence of the inherent right of an\nemployer to terminate the services of an employee in terms\nof the contract of employment and also under the various\nlabour enactments, that a plain reading of the amended\n\nRegulation 13\n of the Indian Airlines Employees' Regulations\nand a cumulative reading of the amended regulations 48 and\n44 of the Air India Employees Service Regulations clearly\nestablished that the vice, if any, of arbitrariness had been\ncompletely removed and that the power to terminate had been\nvested with the Board of Directors, and not with any indi-\nvidual, and sufficient guidelines made available to the\nBoard to exercise the restricted and limited power available\nto the employer under these regulations.\n On behalf of another intervenor, New India Assurance\nCo., it was submitted that the Central Inland Water's case\nwas erroneous, insofar as it made complete negation of power\nof the employer to terminate and rendered the termination\nillegal even where the employer had made all the necessary\ninvestigation and had given hearing to the employee con-\ncerned before making the order, and took in even private\nemployment; therefore, the judgment of this Court should be\nread down and made applicable prospectively.\n In Civil Appeal No. 4073 of 1986 it was contended on\nbehalf of the Bank employee whose services were terminated\nunder para 522 of the Shastri Award, that mere failure of\nthe employee to mention the loan taken by him from another\nbranch of the Bank, which was repaid subsequently, had\ndeprived him of his livelihood, and his services were termi-\nnated without charge of 'misconduct' and without an enquiry,\nand paragraph 522 of the Shastri Award gave no indication as\nto on what conditions this arbitrary uncontrolled power\ncould be used to get rid of one or more permanent employees\nfor \"efficient management of Banks\" on subjective opinions\nor suspicion not tested in enquiry into facts, and that this\nprovision provided for \"insecurity of tenure\" for lakhs of\npermanent employees; \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n and the\nintegrated protection of these Fundamental Rights excluded\nthe \"doctrine of pleasure\" and insisted on security of\ntenure \"during good behaviour\", and the right to livelihood\ncould not be rendered precari-\n148\nous or reduced to a \"glorious 'uncertainty\", that no princi-\nple of interpretation permitted reading down a provision so\nas to make it into a different provision altogether differ-\nent from what was intended by the legislature or its dele-\ngate, and there could not be any reading down which was\ncontrary to the principles of interpretation; that if two\nprovisions existed, firstly to remove from service after\nholding an enquiry on a charge of 'misconduct' and secondly,\nwithout serving a charge-sheet or holding an enquiry, all\nprovisions for holding enquiry would be rendered otiose and\nwould be reduced to a mere redundancy, that the Court had a\nduty to correct wrongs even if orders had been made which\nwere later found to be violative of any fundamental right\nand to recall its orders to avoid injustice; that substan-\ntive provision of para 522 could not be controlled or cur-\ntailed effectively so as to confine its operation within\nnarrow constitutional limits; that it was not the duty of\nthe court to condone the constitutional delinquencies of\nthose limited by the Constitution if they arrogated uncon-\ntrolled unconstitutional powers, which were neither neces-\nsary nor germane for supposed efficiency of services in the\nBanks as a business enterprise, and that in a system gov-\nerned by rule of law, discretion when conferred upon execu-\ntive authorities must be confined within clearly defined\nlimits.\n In Civil Appeal No. I 115 of 1976, the appellant-employ-\nee of the Zila Parishad contended that his services were\nterminated on account of the vindictiveness of some of the\nemployees of the respondent, and without enquiry. The em-\nployer submitted that the termination order was passed on\nthe basis of the condition in the mutually agreed terms of\ncontract of appointment, and resolution passed by the Board,\nand that Rule 1(i) of District Board Rules, 1926, Part V\ngave right to both the parties to terminate the employment\non one month's notice.\n On the questions (i) whether \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the\nDelhi Road Transport Authority (Conditions of Appointment\nand Service) Regulations, 1952, was arbitrary, illegal,\ndiscriminatory and violative of audi alteram partem and so\nconstitutionally invalid and void; and (ii) whether the\nRegulation could be interpreted and read down in such a\nmanner as to hold that it was not discriminatory, or arbi-\ntrary and did not confer unbriddled and uncanalised power on\nthe authority to terminate the service of an employee,\nincluding a permanent employee, without any reason whatsoev-\ner.\n Dismissing Civil Appeal No. 2876 of 1986 (appeal by the\nDelhi Transport Corporation), allowing Civil Appeal No. 1115\nof 1976, and directing other matters to be placed before a\nDivision Bench, in ac-\n149\ncordance with the majority decision (per Ray, Sharma, Sawant\nand K. Ramaswamy, JJ.) this Court,\nHELD: Per Ray, J.:\n 1. I \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi Road Transport Author-\nity (Conditions of Appointment and Service) Regulations,\n1952 which confers powers on the authority to terminate the\nservices of a permanent and confirmed employee by issuing a\nnotice terminating the services or by making payment in lieu\nof notice without assigning any reasons in the order and\nwithout giving any opportunity of hearing to the employee\nbefore passing the orders is wholly arbitrary, uncanalised\nand unrestricted violating principles of natural justice as\nwell as \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. There is no guide-\nline in the Regulations or in the Delhi Road Transport\nAuthority Act, 1950 as to when or in which cases and circum-\nstances this power of termination by giving notice or pay in\nlieu thereof can be exercised. [264G, 285C]\n 1.2 Government Companies or Public Corporations which\ncarry on trade and business activity of State being State\ninstrumentalities, are State within the meaning of \nArticle\n12\n of the Constitution and as such they are subject to the\nobservance of fundamental rights embodied in Part 111 as\nwell as to conform to the directive principles in Part IV of\nthe Constitution. In other words, the Service Regulations or\nRules framed by them are to be tested by the touchstone of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. Furthermore, the procedure\nprescribed by their Rules or Regulations must be reasonable,\nfair and just and not arbitrary, fanciful and unjust. [264H,\n265A-B]\n 1.3 The 'audi alteram partem' rule which, in essence,\nenforces the equality clause in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitu-\ntion is applicable not only to quasi-judicial orders but to\nadministrative orders affecting prejudicially the party-in-\nquestion unless the application of the rule has been ex-\npressly excluded by the Act or Regulation or Rule which is\nnot the case here. Rules of natural justice do no supplant\nbut supplement the Rules and Regulations. Moreover, the Rule\nof Law, which permeates the Constitution of India, demands\nthat it has to be observed both substantially and\nprocedurally. Rule of law posits that the power to be\nexercised in a manner which is just, fair and reasonable and\nnot in an unreasonable, capricious or arbitrary manner\nleaving room for discrimination. [265D-E]\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n does not expressly exclude the application\nof the\n150\n'audi alteram parterm' rule and as such the order of termi-\nnation of service of a permanent employee cannot be passed\nby simply issuing a month's notice or pay in lieu thereof\nwithout recording any reason in the order and without giving\nany hearing to the employee to controvert the allegation on\nthe basis of which the purported order is made. [265F]\n 1.4 Considering from all these aspects \nRegulation 9(b)\n\nis illegal and void, as it is arbitrary, discriminatory and\nwithout any guidelines for exercise of the power. It confers\nunbridled, uncanalised and arbitrary power on the authority\nto terminate the services of a permanent employee without\nrecording any reasons and without conforming to the princi-\nples of natural justice. It is also void under \nSection 23\n of\nthe Contract Act, as being opposed to public policy and also\nultra vires of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.

This however, does not under any\ncircumstances, mean that where the plain and literal meaning\nthat follows from a bare reading of the provisions of the\nAct, Rule or Regulations that it confers arbitrary uncana-\nlised, unbridled unrestricted power to terminate the serv-\nices of a permanent employee without recording any reasons\nfor the same and without adhering to the principles of\nnatural justice and equality before the law as envisaged in\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution, it can be read down to save\nthe said provision from constitutional invalidity, by bring-\ning or adding words in the said legislation, such as saying\nthat it implies that reasons for the order of termination\nhave to be recorded. [271C-F]\n 2.2 In interpreting the provisions of an Act, it is not\npermissible where the plain language of the provision gives\na clear and unambiguous meaning that it can be interpreted\nby reading down and presuming certain expressions in order\nto save it from constitutional invalidity.

In the interest of efficiency of the public bodies,\nhowever, they should have the authority to terminate the\nemployment of undesirable, inefficient, corrupt, indolent\nand disobedient employees, but it must be exercised fairly,\nobjectively and independently; and the occasion for the\nexercise must be delimited with precision and clarity.\nFurther, there should be adequate reason for the use of such\na power, and a decision in this regard has to be taken in a\nmanner which should show fairness, avoid arbitrariness and\nevoke credibility. And this is possible only when the law\nlays down detailed guidelines in unambiguous and precise\nterms so as to avoid the danger of misinterpretation of the\nsituation. An element of uncertainty is likely to lead to\ngrave and undesirable consequences. Clarity and precision\nare. therefore, essential for the guidelines. [272D-F]\n 1.2 \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi Road Transport Authori-\nty (Condition of Appointment and Service) Regulation, 1952\ncannot, therefore. be upheld for lack of adequate and appro-\npriate guidelines. [272G]\nPer Saw,ant, J.\n\n 1.1. There is need to minimise the scope of the arbi-\ntrary use of power in all walks of life. It is inadvisable\nto depend on the good sense of the individuals. however\nhigh-placed they may be. It is all the more improper and\nundesirable to expose the precious rights like the rights of\nlife. liberty and property to the vagaries of the individual\nwhims and fancies. It is trite to say that individuals are\nnot and do not become wise because they occupy high seats of\npower, and good sense, circumspection and fairness do not go\nwith the posts, however high they may be. There is only a\ncomplaisant presumption that those who occupy high posts\nhave a high sense of responsibility. The presumption is\nneither legal nor rational. History does not support it and\nreality does not warrant it. In particular, in a society\npledged to uphold the rule of law, it would be both unwise\nand impolitic to leave any aspect of its life to be governed\nby discretion when it can conveniently and easily be covered\nby the rule of law. [276E-F]\n 1.2 Beyond the self-deluding and self-asserting right-\neous presumption, there is nothing to support the 'high\nauthority' theory. This\n\n153\n\ntheory undoubtedly weighed with some authorities for some\ntime in the past. But its unrealistic pretensions were soon\nnoticed and it was buried without even so much as an ode to\nit. [278A-B]\n 1.3 The employment under the public undertakings is a\npublic employment and a public property. It is not only the\nundertakings but also the society which has a stake in their\nproper and efficient working. Both discipline and devotion\nare necessary for efficiency. To ensure both, the service\nconditions of those who work for them must be encouraging,\ncertain and secured, and not vague and whimiscal. With\ncapricious service conditions, both discipline and devotion\nare endangered, and efficiency is impaired. [276G-H, 277A]\n 1.4 The right to life includes right to livelihood. The\nright to livelihood, therefore, cannot hang on to the fan-\ncies of individuals in authority. The employment is not a\nbounty from them nor can its survival be at their mercy.\nIncome is the foundation of many fundamental rights and when\nwork is the sole source of income, the right to work becomes\nas much fundamental. Fundamental rights can ill-afford to be\nconsigned to the limb of undefined premises and uncertain\napplications. \nThat will be a mockery of them. [277B]\n 1.5 Both the society and the individual employed, there-\nfore, have an anxious interest in service conditions being\nwell-defined and explicit to the extent possible. The arbi-\ntrary rules which are also sometimes described as Henry VIII\nRules, can have no place in any service conditions. [\n277C]\n Sukhdev Singh & Ors. v.

Union of India & Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 122, referred to.\n 2.1 The doctrine of reading down or of recasting the\nstatute can be applied in limited situations. It is essen-\ntially used, firstly, for saving a statute from being struck\ndown on account of its unconstitutionality. It is an exten-\nsion of the principle that when two interpretations are\npossible--one rendering it constitutional and the other\nmaking it constitutional the former should be preferred. The\nunconstitutionality may spring from either the incompetence\nof the legislature to enact the statute or from its viola-\ntion of any of the provisions of the Constitution. The\nsecond situation which summons its aid is where the provi-\nsions of the statute are vague and ambiguous and it is\npossible to gather the intention of the legislature from the\nobject of the statute, the context in which the provision\noccurs and the purpose for which it is made. However, when\nthe provision is cast in a definite and unambiguous language\nand its intention is clear, it is not permissible either to\nmend or bend it even if such recasting is in accord with\ngood reason and conscience. In such circumstances, it is not\npossible for the Court to remake the statute. Its only duty\nis to strike it down and leave it to the legislature if it\nso desires, to amend it. If the remaking of the statute by\nthe courts is to lead to its distortion that course is to be\nscrupulously avoided. The doctrine can never be called into\nplay where the statute requires extensive additions and\ndeletions.\n \nNot only it is no part of the court's duty to\nundertake such exercise, but it is beyond its jurisdiction\nto do so.

United States, 398 US 333;\n26 L.ed. 2nd 308, referred to.\n\n155\n\n 2.2 Therefore, the doctrine of reading down cannot be\navailed of for saving the regulation in the instant case. In\nthe first instance, the regulation is a part of the service\nregulations of the employees made by the Delhi Road Trans-\nport Authority in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-\nsection (1) read with clause (c) of sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 53\n of the Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950, whose\nobject is to provide for the establishment and the regula-\ntion of Road Transport Authority for the promotion of a co-\nordinated system of road transport in the State of Delhi.\nThere is nothing either in the object of the service regula-\ntions or in the object of the Act which has a bearing on\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n. If anything the object of the Act would\nrequire framing of such service regulations as would ensure\ndedicated and diligent employees to run the undertaking. The\ndedication of the employees would pre-suppose security of\nemployment and not a constant hanging of the Democle's sword\nover their head, and hence would in any case not bear the\nexistence of such regulation. Secondly, the language of\nregulation is so crystal clear that no two interpretations\nare possible to be placed on it and hence it is not permis-\nsible to read in it any meaning other than what is clearly\nsought to be conveyed by it. Thirdly, the context of the\nregulation makes it abundantly clear that it is meant to be\na naked hire and fire rule and the authority has been vested\nwith unguided and arbitrary power to dispense with the\nservices of any category of the employees. Sub-clause (a) of\nthe Regulation mentions elaborately the circumstances in\nwhich the services of an employee can be terminated without\nany notice or pay in lieu of such notice. Sub-clause (b)\nfollows closely on its heel and states in clear language\nthat when the termination is made due to reduction of estab-\nlishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned in\nsub-clause (a), one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof is\nall that is necessary to be given for terminating an employ-\nee's services. The intention of the rule-making authority,\ntherefore, is more than clear. It was to give an absolute\nfree hand without any limitations whatsoever to terminate\nthe services of any employee. Both the language of the\nregulation as well as the context in which it is cast leave\nno scope for reading into it any further provision. [289C-H,\n290A]\n 2.3 Moreover, reading in the rule circumstances under\nwhich alone the rule can be used, and reading it down to\nread in it words or expressions or provisions in order to\nsave the legislation would not only distort the intention of\nthe rule-making authority but would also require extensive\namendment of a very vague nature to it. The reading in the\nregulation of a provision that the concerned employees\nshould be given a hearing with regard to his mis-conduct\nwill require that be should first be intimated of the mis-\nconduct of which he is guilty. But\n\n156\n\nthat kind of a situation is taken care of by sub-clause (a)\nof the said regulation. There is. therefore. no need of a\nseparate prevision for the same. If. on the other hand. the\nservices of an employee are to be terminated on grounds\nother than those mentioned in sub-clause (a), then those\ngrounds being unknown to the employee, cannot be met by him\neven if he is given a hearing. The Court cannot read in the\nrule all circumstances where it is not possible or necessary\nto hold an enquiry. Such situations are capable of being\nformulated easily and conveniently at least in general terms\nas is done by the Constitution-makers in the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311( 2).\n The reading of such circumstances in the\nexisting regulation would require its extensive recasting\nwhich is impermissible for the Court to do. There is no\nauthority which supports such wide reading down of any\nprovision of the statute or rule/regulation. Therefore the\ndoctrine of reading down is singularly inapplicable to the\npresent case. [281B, 290B, 291A-F]\n\n 3. Clause (b) of \nRegulation 9\n contains the much hated\nand abused rule of hire and fire reminiscent of the days of\nlaissez faire and unrestrained freedom of contract. [274E]\nPer Ramaswamy.J 1.\n\n \n1.1 The question of security of work is of most impor-\ntance. If a person does not have the feeling that he belongs\nto an organisation engaged in promotion. he will not put\nforward his best effort to produce more. That sense of\nbelonging arises only when he feels that he will not be\nturned out of employment the next day at the whim of the\nmanagement. Therefore, as far as possible security of work\nshould be assured the employees so that they may contribute\nto the maximisation of production. [\n300D-E]\n Daily Rated Casual Labour v.

Security of tenure enures the\nbenefit of pension on retirement. Dismissal, removal or\ntermination of his/her service for inefficiency, corruption\nor other misconduct is by way of penalty. He/She has a right\nto security of tenure which is essential to inculcate a\nsense of belonging to the service or organisation and in-\nvolvement for maximum production or efficient\n\n157\n\nservice. It is also a valuable right which is to be duly put\nan end to only as per valid law.\n [300A-G]\n Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR 185 at\n195-196; Calcutta Dock Labour Board v.

The\nfundamental rights, protected by Part III of the constitu-\ntion, out of which \nArticles 14.\n 19 and 21 are the most\nfrequently\n\n158\n\ninvoked to test the validity of executive as well as legis-\nlative actions when these actions are subjected to judicial\nscrutiny, are necessary means to develop one's own person-\nality and to carve out one's own life in the manner one\nlikes best subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in\nthe paramount interest of the society and to a just. fair\nand reasonable procedure. The effect of restriction or\ndeprivation and not of the form adopted to deprive the right\nis the conclusive test. Thus, the right to a public employ-\nment is a constitutional right under \nArticle 16(1).\n All\nmatters relating to employment include the right to continue\nin service till the employee reaches superannuation or his\nservice is duly terminated in accordance with just, fair and\nreasonable procedure prescribed under the provisions of the\nConstitution or the Rules made under proviso to \nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution or the statutory provision or the Rules.\nregulations or instructions having statutory flavour made\nthereunder. But the relevant provisions must be conformable\nto the rights guaranteed in Parts III & IV of the Constitu-\ntion. \nArticle 21\n guarantees the right to live which includes\nright to livelihood. to many. assured tenure of service is\nthe source.\n \n[311G; 312G-H, 313A-B]\n R.C.

[1985] Suppl.\n 2 SCR\n131 at 233 referred to.\n\n 1.6 \nArticle 14\n is the general principle while \nArt.\n311(2)\n is a special provision applicable to all civil serv-\nices under the State. \nArticle 311(2)\n embodies the principles\nof natural justice but proviso to clause (2) of \nArt. 311\n\nexcludes the operation of principles of natural justice\nengrafted in \nArt. 311(2)\n as an exception in the given cir-\ncumstances enumerated in these clauses of the proviso to\n\nArt. 311(2)\n of the Constitution. \nArticle 14\n read with Arti-\ncles 16(1) and 311 are to be harmoniously interpreted that\nthe proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n excludes the application of the\nprinciples of natural justice as an exception; and the\napplicability of \nArticle 311(2)\n must, therefore, be circum-\nscribed to the civil services and to be construed according-\nly. In respect of all other employees covered by \nArticle 12\n\nof the Constitution the dynamic role of \nArticle 14\n and other\nrelevant Articles like 21 must be allowed to have full play\nwithout any inhibition. unless the statutory rules them-\nselves, consistent with the mandate of Articles 14.16.19 and\n21 provide, expressly, such an exception. [317F-H, 315A]\n Union of India & Ant. v. Tulsiram Patel & Ors., [1985]\nSuppl. 2 SCR 131 at 233; A.K. Kraipak & Ors. etc. v. Union\nof India & Ors., [1970] 1 SCR 457 and Union of India v. Col\nJ.N.

Whenever\nthere is arbitrariness in State action--whether it be of the\nLegislature or of the Executive or of an authority under\n\nArticle 12.\n \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n spring into action and strike\ndown such an action. The concept of reasonableness and non-\narbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional spectrum\nand is a golden thread which runs through the whole fabric\nof the Constitution. [315B-D]\n 1.8 Thus, \nArticle 14\n read with 16(1) accords right to an\nequality or an equal treatment consistent with principles of\nnatural justice. Any law made or action taken by the employ-\ner, corporate statutory or instrumentality under \nArticle 12\n\nmust act fairly and reasonably. Right. to fair treatment is\nan essential inbuilt of natural justice. Exercise of unbri-\ndled and uncanalised discretionary power impinges upon the\nright of the citizen; vesting of discretion is no wrong\nprovided it is exercised purposively, judiciously and with-\nout prejudice. Wider the discretion, the greater the chances\nof abuse. Absolute discretion is destructive of freedom than\nof man's inventions. Absolute discretion marks the beginning\nof the end of the liberty. The conferment of absolute power\nto dismiss a permanent employee is antithesis to justness or\nfair treatment. The exercise of discretionary power wide of\nmark would bread arbitrary, unreasonable or unfair actions\nand would not be consistent with reason and justice. [320B-\nD]\n 1.9 The right to public employment which includes right\nto continued public employment till the employee is superan-\nnuated as per rules or compulsorily retired or duly termi-\nnated in accordance with the procedure established by law is\nan integral part of right to livelihood which in turn is an\nintegral part of right to life assured by \nArt. 21\n of the\nConstitution. Any procedure prescribed to deprive such a\nright to livelihood or continued employment must be just,\nfair and reasonable procedure and conformable to the mandate\nof \nArticles 14\n and \n21.\n \nIn other words, an employee in a\npublic employment also must not be arbitrarily, unjustly or\nunreasonably deprived of his/her livelihood which is ensured\nin continued employment till it is terminated in accordance\nwith just, fair and reasonable procedure.

Disci-\npline in that regard amongst the employees is its essential\nfacet and bas to be maintained. The society is vitally\ninterested in the due discharge of the duties by the govern-\nment employees or employees of corporate bodies or statutory\nauthorities or instrumentalities under \nArt. 12\n of the Con-\nstitution. The government or corporate employees are,\nafter-all, paid from the public exchequer to which everyone\ncontributes either by way of direct or indirect taxes. The\nemployees are charged with public duty and they should\nperform their public duties with deep sense of responsibili-\nty. The collective responsibility of all the officers from\ntop most to the lowest maximises the efficient public admin-\nistration. They must, therefore, be held to have individual\nas well as collective responsibility in discharge of their\nduties faithfully honestly with full dedication and utmost\ndevotion to duty. Equally the employees must also have a\nfeeling that they have security of tenure. They should also\nhave an involvement on their part in the organisation or\ninstitution, corporation, etc. They need assurance of serv-\nice and protection. The public interest and the public good\ndemands that those who discharge their duties honestly,\nefficiently and\n\n161\n\nwith a sense of devotion and dedication to duty should\nreceive adequate protection and security of tenure. There-\nfore, before depriving an employee of the means of liveli-\nhood to himself and his dependents, i.e. job, the procedure\nprescribed for such deprivation must be just, fair and\nreasonable under Arts. 21 and 14 and when infringes \nArt.\n19(1)(g)\n must be subject to imposing reasonable restrictions\nunder \nArt. 19(5).\n [320G-H, 321A-D, 322D]\n 1.11 Conferment of power on a high rank officer is not\nalways an assurance, in particular, when the moral standards\nare generally degenerated, that the power would be exercised\nobjectively, reasonably, conscientiously, fairly and justly\nwithout inbuilt protection to an employee. Even officers who\ndo their duty honestly and conscientiously are subject to\ngreat pressures and pulls. Therefore, the competing claims\nof the \"public interest\" as against \"individual interest\" of\nthe employees are to be harmoniously blended so as to serve\nthe societal need consistent with the constitutional scheme.\n[322D-E]\n 1.12 \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi Road Transport (Condi-\ntions of Appointment and Service) Regulations, 1952, is\narbitrary, unjust, unfair and unreasonable offending Arti-\ncles 14, 16(1), 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution. It is\nalso opposite to the public policy and thereby is void under\n\nSection 23\n of the Indian Contract Act. [330G]\n 1.13 Under ordinary law of master and servant, whether\nthe contract of service is for a fixed period or not, if it\ncontains a provision for termination of service by notice,\nin terms thereof, it can be so determined and if the con-\ntract finds no provision to give notice and the contract of\nservice is not for a fixed period, law implies giving of a\nreasonable notice. Where no notice or a reasonable notice\nwas issued. before terminating the contract. the termination\nof the contract of service is wrongful and the aggrieved\nemployee is entitled at law to sue for damages. It is not\ndisputed that the Delhi Road Transport Corporation is a\nstatutory Corporation under the Delhi Road Transport Act and\nthe Regulations are statutory and its employees are entitled\nto the fundamental rights enshrined in Part 111 of the\nConstitution. The Corporation or an instrumentality or other\nauthority under \nArticle 12\n is not free, like an ordinary\nmaster (a private employer) to terminate the services of its\nemployees at its whim or caprices or vagary. It is bound by\nthe Act and the Regulation and paramount law of the land,\nthe Constitution. [292G-H; 293A-B]\n 1.14 Any law, much less the provisions of \nContract Act\n,\nwhich are inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaran-\nteed in Part III of\n\n162\n\nthe Constitution, are void by operation of \nArticle 13\n of the\nConstitution. The law of contract, like the legal system\nitself, involves a balance between competing sets of values.\nFreedom of contract emphasises the need for stability.\ncertainty and predictability. But, important as values are.\nthey are not absolute, and there comes a point when they\nface a serious challenge. 'This Court, as a court of consti-\ntutional conscience enjoined and is jealously to project and\nuphold new values in establishing the egalitarian social\norder. As a court of constitutional functionary exercising\nequity jurisdiction, this Court would relieve the weaker\nparties from unconstitutional contractual obligations,\nunjust, unfair, oppressive and unconscionable rules or\nconditions when the citizen is really unable to meet on\nequal terms with the State. It is to find whether the citi-\nzen, when entered into contracts of service, was in distress\nneed or compelling circumstances to enter into contract on\ndotted lines or whether the citizen was in a position of\neither to \"take it or leave it\" and if it finds to be so,\nthis Court would not shirk to avoid the contract by appro-\npriate declaration. \n[\n302G, 303B, 304H, 305A-B]\n Central Inland Water Transport Company Limited v.

All the provisions should be read together. If the\nwords of the statutes are in themselves precise and unambig-\nuous, the words, or phrases or sentences themselves alone\ndo, then no more can be necessary than to expound those\nwords or phrases or sentences in their natural and ordinary\nsense. But if any doubt arises from the terms employed by\nthe legislature, it is always safe means of collecting the\nintention, to call in aid the ground and cause of making the\nstatute, and have recourse to the preamble, which is a key\nto open the minds of the makers of the statute and the\nmischiefs which the Act intends to redress. In determining\nthe meaning of statute the first question to ask always is\nwhat is the natural or ordinary meaning of that\n\n163\n\nword or phrase in its context. It is only when that meaning\nleads to some result which cannot reasonably be supposed to\nhave been the intent of the legislature, then it is proper\nto look for some other possible meaning and the court cannot\ngo further. [323D-G]\n 2.2 The Doctrine of Reading Down is, therefore, an\ninternal aid to construe the word or phrase in a statute to\ngive reasonable meaning, but not to detract, disort or\nemasculate the language so as to give the supposed purpose\nto avoid unconstitutionality. Thus, the object of reading\ndown is to keep the operation of the statute within the\npurpose of the Act and constitutionally valid. [324E, 325B]\n 2.3 It cannot be accepted that the Courts, in the proc-\ness of interpretation of the Statute, would not make law but\nleave it to the legislature for necessary amendments. In an\nappropriate case, Judges would articulate the inarticulate\nmajor premise and would give life and force to a Statute by\nreading harmoniously all the provisions ironing out the\ncreezes. The object is to elongate the purpose of the Act.\n[323B]\n 2.4 The Courts, though, have no power to amend the law\nby process of interpretation, but do have power to mend it\nso as to be in conformity with the intendment of the legis-\nlature. \nDoctrine of reading down is one of the principles of\ninterpretation of statute in that process. But when the\noffending language used by the legislature is clear, precise\nand unambiguous, violating the relevant provisions in the\nconstitution, resort cannot be had to the doctrine of read-\ning down to blow life into the void law to save it from\nunconstitutionality or to confer jurisdiction on the legis-\nlature. Similarly it cannot be taken aid of to emasculate\nthe precise, explicit, clear and unambiguous language to\nconfer arbitrary, unbridled and uncanalised power on an\nemployer which is a negation to just, fair and reasonable\nprocedure envisaged under \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the Consti-\ntution and to direct the authorities to record reasons,\nunknown or unintended procedure.

This power is in addition to the normal\npower in \nRegulation 15\n to conduct an enquiry into misconduct\nafter giving reasonable opportunity. Thereby the legislative\nintention is manifest that it intended to confer such draco-\nnian power couched in language of width which hangs like\nDamocles sword on the neck of the employee, keeping every\nemployee on tenter-hook under constant pressure of uncer-\ntainty, precarious tenure at all times right from the date\nof appointment till date of superannuation. It equally\nenables the employer to pick and choose an employee at whim\nor vagary to terminate the service arbitrarily and capri-\nciously. \nRegulation 9(b)\n, thereby deliberately conferred\nwide power of termination of services of the employee with-\nout following the principles of audi alteram partem or even\nmodicum of procedure of representation before terminating\nthe services of permanent employee. [327E-G]\n 2.6 No doubt, the power to take appropriate and expedi-\ntious action to meet the exigencies of weeding out ineffi-\ncient, corrupt, indolent officers or employees from service\nshould be provided and preserved to the competent authority\nbut any action taken without any modicum of reasonable\nprocedure and prior opportunity always generates an un-\nquenchable feeling that unfair treatment was meted out to\nthe aggrieved employee. To prevent miscarriage of justice or\nto arrest a nursing grievance that arbitrary whimsical or\ncapricious action was taken behind the back of an employee\nwithout opportunity, the law must provide a fair, just and\nreasonable procedure as is exigible in a given circumstance\nas adumbrated in proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n of the Constitution.\nIf an individual action is taken as per the procedure on its\nown facts its legality may be tested. But it would be no\njustification to confer power with wide discretion on any\nauthority without any procedure which would not meet the\ntest of justness, fairness and reasonable-\n\n165\n\nness envisaged under Arts. 14 and 21 of the Constitution.\nTherefore, conferment of power with wide discretion without\nany guidelines, without any just, fair or reasonable proce-\ndure is constitutionally anathema to Arts. 14, 16(1),\n19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution. Doctrine of reading\ndown cannot be extended to such a situation. [328A-C, 329B-\nC]\n 2.7 In view of the march of law, made by \nArticle 14\n it\nis too late in the day to contend that the competent author-\nity would be vested with wide discretionary power without\nany proper guidelines or the procedure. When it is found\nthat the legislative intention is unmistakably clear, unam-\nbiguous and specific, the preamble, the other rules and the\ncircumstances could not be taken aid of in reading down the\nprovisions of the rules or the regulations of the constitu-\ntional scheme. [330F-G]\n 3.1 The phrases \"public policy\", opposed to public\npolicy, or \"contrary to public policy\" are incapable of\nprecise definition. It is valued to meet the public good or\nthe public interest. What is public good or in the public\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public\ngood or the public interest vary from time to time with the\nchange of the circumstances. Therefore, in the absence of\nspecific head of public policy which covers a case, then the\ncourt must in consonance with public conscience and in\nkeeping with public good and public interest invent new\npublic policy and declare such practice or rules that are\nderogatory to the constitution to be opposed to public\npolicy. The rules which stem from the public policy must of\nnecessity be laid to further the progress of the society, in\nparticular when social change is to bring about an egalitar-\nian social order through rule of law. In deciding a case\nwhich may not be covered by authority, courts have before\nthem the beacon light of the trinity of the Constitution\nviz., the preamble, Part III and Part IV and the play of\nlegal light and shade must lead on the path of justice\nsocial, economic and political. Lacking precedent, the court\ncan always be guided by that light and the guidance thus\nshed by the trinity of our Constitution. [308C-D, 309G-H,\n310A]\n 3.2 Since Constitutions are the superior law of the\nland, and because one of their outstanding features is\nflexibility and capacity to meet changing conditions, con-\nstitutional policy provides a valuable aid in determining\nthe legitimate boundaries of statutory meaning. Thus public\npolicy having its inception in Constitutions may accomplish\neither a restricted or extended interpretation of the liter-\nal expression of a statute. A statute is always presumed to\nbe constitutional and where necessary, a constitutional\nmeaning will be inferred to preserve validity. Likewise,\nwhere a statute tends to extend or preserve a constitutional\n\n166\n\nprinciple, reference to analogous constitutional provisions\nmay be of great value in shaping the statute to accord with\nthe statutory aim or objective. Therefore, when the provi-\nsions of an Act or Regulations or Rules are assailed as\narbitrary, unjust, unreasonable, unconstitutional, public\nlaw element makes it incumbent to consider the validity\nthereof on the anvil of inter play of Arts. 14, 16(1),\n19(1)(g) and 21 and of the inevitable effect of the provi-\nsion challenged on the rights of a citizen and to find\nwhether they are constitutionally valid. [310C-D, 311E]\n\n 4. The absence of arbitrary power is the first essential\nof the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional\nsystem is based. In a system governed by rule of law, dis-\ncretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be\nconfined within defined limits. The rule of law from this\npoint of view means that decisions should be made by the\napplication of known principles and rules and, in general,\nsuch decisions should be predictable and the citizen should\nknow where he is. If a decision is taken without any princi-\nple or without any rule it is unpredictable and such a\ndecision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance\nwith the rule of law. [328D-E]\n\n 5. No doubt, it is open to the authorities to terminate\nthe services of a temporary employee without holding an\nenquiry. But in view of the march of law made, viz., that it\nis not the form of the action but the substance of the order\nwhich is to be looked into, it is open to the Court to lift\nthe veil and pierce the action challenged to find whether\nthe said action is the foundation to impose punishment or is\nonly a motive. The play of fair play is to secure justice\nprocedural as well as substantive. The substance of the\norder, the effect thereof is to be looked into. [330C-D]\nShamsher Singh v. State of Punjab, [1975] 4 SCR 814, re-\nferred to.\n\n It is for concerned authorities to make appropriate\nrules or regulations and to take appropriate action even\nwithout resorting to elaborate enquiry needed consistent\nwith the constitutional scheme.

Brojo-\n\nnath Ganguly, [1986] 3 SCC 156-AIR 1986 SC 1517, affirmed.\nPer Mukharji, CJ., (Contra)\n\n 1. The constitutionality of the conferment of power to\nterminate services of a permanent employee without holding\nan enquiry is sustained by reading that the power must be\nexercised on reasons relevant for the efficient running of\nthe services or performing of the job by the societies or\nthe bodies. It should be done objectively, the reasons\nshould be recorded, and the basis that it is not feasible or\npossible reasonably to hold any enquiry without disclosing\nthe evidence which in the circumstances of the case would be\nhampering the running of the institution. The reasons though\nrecorded, need not be communicated, it is only for the\npurpose of running of the institution. There should be\nfactors which hamper running of the institution without the\ntermination of the employment of the employee concerned at\nthe particular time, either because he is a surplus or\ninefficient, disobedient and dangerous. [235C-E]\n 2.1 The philosophy of the Indian Constitution, as it has\nevolved, from precedent to precedent, has broadened the\nhorizons of the right of the employees and they have been\nassured security of tenures and ensured protection against\narbitrariness and discrimination in discharge or termination\nof his employment. This is the basic concept of the evolu-\ntion from the different angles of law of master and servant\nor in the evolution of employer and employee relationship.\nIt is true that the law has traveled in different channels,\ngovernment servants or servants or employees having status\nhave to be differentiated from those whose relationships are\nguided by contractual obligations. However, the basic and\nfundamental question to be judged is, in what manner and to\nwhat extent, the employees of either of semi-Government or\nstatutory corporations or public undertakings who enjoy the\nrights, privileges, limitations and inhibitions of institu-\ntions who come within the ambit of \nArticle 12\n of the Consti-\ntution could be affected in their security of tenure by the\nemployers consistent with the rights evolved over the years\nand rights emanating from the philosophy of the Constitution\nas at present understood and accepted. [229D-G]\n 2.2 Efficiency of the administration of these undertak-\nings is very vital and relevant consideration. Production\nmust continue, services must be maintained and run. Efficacy\nof the services can be manned only by the disciplined em-\nployees or workers. Discipline. decency and\n\n168\n\norder will have to be maintained. Employees should have\nsense of participation and involvement and necessarily sense\nof security in semipermanent or quasi-permanent or permanent\nemployment. There must be scope for encouragement for good\nwork. In what manner and in what measure, this should be\nplanned and ensured within the framework of the Constitution\nand, power mingled with obligations, and duties enjoined\nwith rights, are matters of constitutional adjustment at any\nparticular evolved stage of the philosophy of our Constitu-\ntion. [230A-C]\n 2.3 Arbitrary, whimsical or discriminatory action can\nflow or follow in some cases by the preponderance of these\npowers to terminate. The tact that the power is entrusted\nwith a high ranking authority or body is not always a safe\nor sound insurance against misuse. At least, it does not\nalways ensure against erosion of credibility in the exercise\nof the power in particular contingency. Yet discipline has\nto be maintained, efficiency of the institution has to be\nensured. It has to be recognised that quick actions are very\noften necessary in running of an institution or public\nservice or public utility and public concern. It is not\nalways possible to have enquiry because disclosure is diffi-\ncult; evidence is hesitant and difficult, often impossible.\nIn those circumstances, the approach to the location of\npower, possession and exercise of which is essential for\nefficient running of the industries or services, has to be a\nmatter both of balancing and adjustment, on which one can\nwager the salivation of rights and liberties of the employ-\nees concerned and the future of the industries or the serv-\nices involved. [330D-F]\n 2.4 The power to terminate the employment of permanent\nemployment must be there. Efficiency and expediency and the\nnecessity of running an industry or service make it impera-\ntive to have these powers. Power must, therefore, be with\nauthorities to take decision quickly, objectively and inde-\npendently. Power must be assumed with certain conditions of\nduty. The preamble, the policy, purpose of the enacting\nprovision delimit the occasions or the contingencies for the\nneed for the exercise of the power and these should limit\nthe occasions of exercise of such powers. The manner in\nwhich such exercise of power should be made should ensure\nfairness, avoid arbitrariness and mala fide and create\ncredibility in the decisions arrived at or by exercise of\nthe power. All these are essential to ensure that power is\nfairly exercised and there is fair play in action. Reasons\ngood and sound, must control the exercise of power. [230G-H,\n231A]\nThus, for the running of the industry or the service, effi-\nciently,\n\n169\n\nquickly and in a better manner or to avoid dead-locks or\ninefficiency or friction, the vesting of the power in cir-\ncumstances must be such that it will evoke credibility and\nconfidence. Notice of hearing and opportunity in the form of\nan enquiry may or may not be given, yet arbitrariness and\ndiscrimination and acting whimsically must be avoided. \nThese\npowers must, therefore, be so read that the powers can be\nexercised on reasons, which should be recorded, though need\nnot always be communicated, and must be by authorities who\nare high ranking or senior enough and competent and are\nexpected to act fairly, objectively and independently. The\noccasion for the use of power must be clearly circumscribed\nin the above limits. These must also circumscribe that the\nneed for exercise of those powers without holding a detailed\nor prolonged enquiry is there. [\n231E, F-G]\n Workmen of Hindustan Steel Ltd. & Anr. v.

Our law making bodies\nare not law unto themselves and cannot create or make all\nlaws. They can only confer powers or make laws for the\nconferment of powers on authorities which are legal and\nvalid. Such powers conferred must conform to the constitu-\ntional inhibitions. [232C-D]\n 3.2 Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is\nenacted from experience of evils. But its general language\nshould not necessarily be confined to the form that the evil\nhad taken place. Time works changes, brings into existence\nnew conditions and purposes and new awareness of limita-\ntions. Therefore, a principle to be valid must be capable of\nwider application than the mischief which gave it birth.\nThis is particularly true of the constitutional construc-\ntions. Constitutions are not ephemeral enactments designed\nto meet passing occasions, but designed to approach immor-\ntality as nearly as human institutions can approach it. In\nthe application of a Constitutional limitation or inhibi-\ntion, the interpretation cannot be only of 'what has been'\nbut of 'what may be'. Therefore. in the interpretation of\nthe provisions of an Act, where two constructions are possi-\nble, the one which leads towards constitutionality of the\nlegislation would be preferred to that which has the effect\nof\n\n171\n\ndestroying it. If the Courts do not read the conferment of\npower in the aforesaid manner, the power is liable to be\nstruck down as bad. [233B-D]\n 3.3 The Court must proceed on the premise that the law\nmaking authority intended to make a valid law to confer\npower validly or which will be valid. The freedom therefore,\nto search the spirit of the enactment or what is intended to\nobtain or to find the intention of parliament gives the\nCourt the power to supplant and supplement the expressions\nused to say what was left unsaid. This is an important\nbranch of judicial power, the concession of which if taken\nto the extreme is dangerous, but denial of that power would\nbe ruinous and this is not contrary to the expressed inten-\ntion of the legislature or the implied purpose of the legis-\nlation. [234G-H; 235A]\n 3.4 It has been said that if the legislature has mani-\nfested a clear intention to exercise an unlimited power, it\nis impermissible to read down the amplitude of that power so\nas to make it limited. This cannot be agreed to. Our legis-\nlatures are limited by the constitutional inhibitions and it\nis made, that the Court should read their Acts and enact-\nments with the attribute that they know their limits and\ncould not have intended to violate the Constitution. It is\ntrue that the Court should be loath to read down where there\nare clear, unambiguous and positive terms in a legislation\nand should proceed with a straight forward method of strik-\ning down such legislations. But where the statute is silent\nor not expressive or inarticulate, the Court must read down\nin the silence of the statute and in the inarticulation of\nits provisions, the Constitutional inhibitions and transmute\nthe major inarticulate premise into a reality and read down\nthe statute accordingly. [236H, 237A-B]\n 3.5 The plain thrust of legislative enactment has to be\nfound out in the inarticulate expressions and in the silence\nof the legislation. In doing so, to say what the legislature\ndid not specifically say is not distortion to avert any\nconstitutional collision. [237E]\n In the language of the relevant provisions of the\ninstant cases, there is no intention of the legislature to\nflout the constitutional limitations. [237E]\n Elliot Ashto Welsh 11 v. United States, 398 US 333, 26\nEd. 2d. 308, referred to.\n\n \n3.6 It is not that the reading down is used for a\npurpose which is just the opposite which the legislature had\nintended. Legislature had not\n\n172\n\nintended arbitrary or uncontrolled-or whimsical power.\nIndeed it considered. This is not the proper way to read\nthat power in the \nRegulation 9(b)\n. Para 522 of the Shastri\nAward, read properly, must be circumscribed with the condi-\ntions indicated above as a necessary corollary or conse-\nquence of that power. It is also not reading to the legisla-\nture conditions which were not there in the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution. [\n237H, 238A-B]\n Union of India & Anr. v. Tulsiram Patel\n, [1985] Supp.\n 2\nSCR 131, relied on.\n\n \nNo doubt, absolute powers cannot be regulated without\nessential legislative policy, but in the instant cases\nproperly read, absolute power was not there. Power that was\nonly constitutionally valid, that power can be presumed to\nhave been given and if that presumption is made, conditions\nindicated above inevitably attach. But these conditions are\nnecessary corollary flowing from the conferment of the power\nof termination in a constitutional manner for the smooth,\nproper and efficient running of the industry. [238C, E]\n 3.7 In the circumstances power must be there, the power\nmust be read down in the manner and to the extent indicated\nabove, of terminating the services of permanent employees\nwithout holding any enquiry in the stated contingencies and\nthis would be either by virtue of the silence of the provi-\nsion indicating the contingencies of termination or by\nvirtue of constitutional inhibitions.

The exercise of such powers can only be for purposes\ngermane and relevant to the statute, viz., the employee is\nincompetent or unsuitable so as to make his continuance in\nthe employment detrimental to the interest of the institu-\ntion, or where the continuance of the employee is a grave\nsecurity risk making his continuance detrimental to the\ninterest of the Corporation and where because of the conduct\nof the employee, or there is lack of confidence in the\nemployee which makes it necessary in the interest of the\nCorporation to immediately terminate the services of the\nemployee etc., etc. Therefore, each case of conferment of\npower involved should be judged on the aforesaid basis.\n[236E-G]\n 3.9 Having regard to the finality of the position of\nlaw and having regard to the theory that parties have ad-\njusted their rights on the understanding of the law as it\nwas, justice of the situation would be met if pending liti-\ngations are examined and disposed of in the light of afore-\nsaid principles.

The expression 'declared' is wider\nthan the words 'found or made'. To declare is to announce\nopinion. Indeed, the latter involves the process. while the\nformer expresses result. Interpretation, ascertainment and\nevolution are parts of the process, while that interpreted,\nascertained or evolved is declared as a law. The law de-\nclared by this Court is the law of the land. To deny this\npower to this Court on the basis of some outmoded theory\nthat the Court only finds law but does not make it, is to\nmake ineffective the powerful instrument of justice placed\nin the hands of the highest judiciary of this country.\nTherefore. there should be a more active and creative role\nfor the courts in declaring what the law is.

These civil appeals, special\nleave petitions and civil miscellaneous petitions deal with\nthe question of constitutional validity of the right of the\nemployer to terminate the\n\n175\n\nservices of permanent employees without holding any inquiry\nin certain circumstances by reasonable notice or pay in lieu\nof notice. The facts involved in these matters are diverse\nbut the central question involved in all these is one, i.e.\nwhether the clauses permitting the employers or the authori-\nties concerned to terminate the employment of the employees\nby giving reasonable notice or pay in lieu of notice but\nwithout holding any inquiry, are constitutionally valid and,\nif not, what would be the consequences of termination by\nvirtue of such clauses or powers, and further whether such\npowers and clauses could be so read with such conditions\nwhich would make such powers constitutionally and legally\nvalid? In order to appreciate the question the factual\nmatrix of these cases so far as these are relevant for the'\ndetermination of the aforesaid questions, will have to be\nborne in mind in the light of the actual legal provisions\ninvolved in the respective cases.\n\n It will, therefore, be proper and appropriate to deal\nwith the relevant facts in civil appeal No. 2876 of 1986\nfirst. The appellant herein--the Delhi Transport Corpora-\ntion, is a statutory body formed and established under\n\nSection 3\n of the Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950 read with\nDelhi Road Transport (Amendment) Act, 1971 (hereinafter\ncalled 'the Act'). The appellant carries out the objects of\nvital public utility, according to the appellant, i.e.\ntransport of passengers in the Union Territory of Delhi and\nother areas. Respondent No. 2, Sri Ishwar Singh was appoint-\ned as conductor therein on probation for a period of 1 year\nin 1970. The probation period was extended thereafter for a\nfurther period of one year and thereafter he was regularised\nin service of the appellant. Similarly, respondent No.\n3--Sri Ram Phal was appointed as Assistant Traffic Incharge\nand after the probation period he was regularised in serv-\nice. Respondent No. 4--Sri Vir Bhan was appointed as driver\nand after completing the probation period he was also regu-\nlarised in service. It is stated that respondents Nos. 2 to\n4 became, according to the appellant, inefficient in their\nwork and started inciting other staff members not to perform\ntheir duties. They were served with termination notices on\n4th June, 1985 under \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi Road\nTransport Authority (Conditions of Appointment & Service)\nRegulations, 1952. On 11th June, 1985 respondents Nos. 2 to\n4 and their Union being respondent No. I-DTC Mazdoor Con-\ngress, filed writ petition No. 1422/85 in Delhi High Court,\nchallenging the constitutional validity of Regulation 9(b)\nof the Delhi Road Transport Act. On 11th May, 1986 the\ndivision bench of the High Court of Delhi allowed the said\nwrit petition and struck down \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the said\nRegulations, and directed the appellant to\n\n176\n\npay back respondents' wages and benefits within 3 months\nfrom the date of the said judgment. This is an appeal,\ntherefrom, by special leave. The question, therefore, is,\nwas the High Court justified in the view it took? It may be\nmentioned that regulations 9(a) & (b) were framed in exer-\ncise of the powers conferred\n u/s 53\n of the said Act, which\nenables the formulation of Regulations. \nRegulation 9\n of the\nsaid regulations, which is material for the present contro-\nversy, reads as follows:\n\n\"9. Termination of service: (a) Except as otherwise speci-\nfied in the appointment orders, the services of an employee\nof the authority may be terminated without any notice or pay\nin lieu of notice:\n\n(i) During the period of probation and without assigning any\nreason thereof.\n\n(ii) For misconduct,\n\n(iii) On the completion of specific period of appointment.\n\n(iv) In the case of employees engaged on contract for a\nspecific period, on the expiration of such period in accord-\nance with the terms of appointment.\n\n(b) Where the termination is made due to reduction of estab-\nlishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned at\n\n(a) above, one month notice or pay in lieu thereof will be\ngiven to all categories of employees.\n\n(c) Where a regular/temporary employee wishes to resign from\nhis post under the authority he shall give three/one month's\nnotice in writing or pay in lieu thereof to the Authority\nprovided that in special cases, the General Manager may\nrelax, at his discretion, the conditions regarding the\nperiod of notice of resignation or pay in lieu thereof.\"\n\n The said Regulation, as set out hereinbefore, deals with\ntermination of services. Four contingencies are contemplated\nvide clause (a) of \nRegulation 9\n, whereupon the services of\nemployees may be terminated without any notice or pay in\nlieu thereof except as otherwise provided in the appointment\norder. Apart from these four contingencies where termination\nis made due to reduction of establishment\n\n177\n\nor in circumstances other than those mentioned in clause (a)\nabove, one month's notice of pay in lieu thereof is required\nto be given to all categories of employees. Therefore,\nexcept in the said four cases, if there is reduction of\nestablishment or there is any termination uncovered by these\nfour contingencies referred to in clause (a) the same shall\nbe by giving one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof to\nall categories of employees. Clause (c) postulates when a\nregular or temporary employee wishes to resign from his post\nunder the authority then in such a situation one month's\nnotice in writing or pay in lieu thereof to the authority\nmay be provided.\n\n The High Court in the judgment under appeal noted that\nsince the filing of this petition the notices issued by\nD.T.C. to its various employees have been withdrawn and all\nthese persons have been reinstated, therefore, the court was\nnot concerned with the validity of clause (a) of \nRegulation\n9\n but respondents Nos. 2 to 4 against whom action had been\ntaken by the appellant by issuing notices of termination\nunder \nRegulation 9(b)\n had not been reinstated and the court\nconsidered the validity of \nRegulation 9(b)\n. It was held by\nthe court that the said provision gave absolute, unbridled\nand arbitrary powers to the Management to terminate the\nservices of any permanent or temporary employee. It was\ncontended that such power was violative of \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution.\n\n \nIn support of this contention, reliance had been placed,\non which the High Court also relied upon, on the decision of\nthis Court in \nWorkmen of Hindustan Steel Ltd. & Anr. v.\nHindustan Steel Ltd. & Ors.\n, [1985] 2 SCR 428. In that case,\nStanding Order 31 of M/s. Hindustan Steel Ltd., a public\nsector undertaking, had prescribed for a detailed procedure\nfor dealing with cases of misconduct; and for imposing major\npenalty, the employer had to draw up a chargesheet and give\nan opportunity to the delinquent workman to make his repre-\nsentation within 7 days. If the allegations were controvert-\ned, an enquiry had to be held by an officer to be nominated\nby the management and in such an enquiry reasonable opportu-\nnity of explaining and defending the alleged misconduct had\nto be given to the workman. Suspension of the delinquent\nworkman pending enquiry was also permitted. At the end of\nthe enquiry, if the charges were proved, and it was provi-\nsionally decided to impose any major penalty, the delinquent\nworkman had to be afforded a further reasonable opportunity\nto represent why the penalty should not be imposed on him.\nStanding Order 32 provided for a special procedure in case a\nworkman was convicted for a criminal offence in a court of\nlaw or where the General\n\n178\n\nManager was satisfied for reasons to be recorded in writing\nthat it was inexpedient or against the interests of security\nto continue to employ the workmen' viz. the workman could be\nremoved or dismissed from service without following the\nprocedure \nlaid down in\n Standing Order No. 31. There the\nappellant was an Assistant in the respondent's undertaking,\nwho was removed from service on the ground that it was no\nlonger expedient to employ him. The management dispensed\nwith the departmental enquiry, after looking into the secret\nreport of one of their officers that the appellant therein\nhad misbehaved with the wife of an employee and that a\ncomplaint in respect thereof had been lodged with the po-\nlice. In the reference to the Industrial Tribunal, the\nTribunal held that as the employer dispensed with the disci-\nplinary enquiry in exercise of the power conferred by Stand-\ning Order 32, it could not be said that the dismissal was\nunjustified, and that if there were allegations of miscon-\nduct, the employer was quite competent to pass an order of\nremoval from service without holding any enquiry in view of\nthe provisions contained in Standing Order 32, and rejected\nthe reference. There was an appeal to this Court. This Court\nheld that the reasons for dispensing with the enquiry do not\nspell out what was the nature of the misconduct alleged to\nhave been committed by the appellant and what prompted the\nGeneral Manager to dispense with the enquiry. As there was\nno justification for dispensing with the enquiry, imposition\nof penalty of dismissal without the disciplinary enquiry as\ncontemplated by Standing Order 31 was illegal and invalid.\nIt was directed that the respondent should recall and cancel\nthe order dated 24th August, 1970 removing the appellant\nfrom service, and reinstate him and on the same day the\nappellant was directed to tender resignation of his post\nwhich should be accepted by the respondent. The respondent\nshould pay as and by way of back wages and future wages, a\nsum of Rs.1.5 lakhs to the appellant within 2 months which\nshould be spread over from year to year commencing from the\ndate of removal from service. It was reiterated that where\nan order casts a stigma or affected livelihood, before\nmaking the order, principles of natural justice of a reason-\nable opportunity to present one's case and controvert the\nadverse evidence must have full play. Even under the Consti-\ntution which permits dispensing with the inquiry under\n\nArticle 311(2)\n a safeguard is introduced that the concerned\nauthority must specify reasons for its decision why it was\nnot reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry. Standing\nOrder 32 nowhere obligates the General Manager to record\nreasons for dispensing with the inquiry as prescribed by\nStanding Order 31. On the contrary, it was held that the\nlanguage of Standing Order 32 enjoins a duty upon the Gener-\nal Manager to record reasons for his satisfaction why it was\ninexpedient\n\n179\n\nor against the interest of the security of the State to\ncontinue to employ the workman. Reasons for dispensing with\nthe enquiry and reasons for not continuing to employ the\nworkman, stand wholly apart from each other. This Court\nfinally observed that it was time for the public sector\nundertaking to recast Standing Order, and to bring it in\ntune with the philosophy of the Constitution failing which\nthe vires of the said Standing Order ,would have to be\nexamined in an appropriate proceeding.\n\n \nReliance was also placed before this Hon'ble Court on\nthe decision of this Court in the case of \nWest Bengal State\nElectricity Board and Others v. Desh Bandhu Ghosh and Oth-\n\ners, [1985] 3 SCC 116, where this Court was concerned with\nregulations 33 and 34 of the West Bengal State Electricity\nBoard. The said regulations 33(1) and 34 were as follows:\n\n\"33(1) Unless otherwise specified in the appointment order\nin any particular case, the services of a permanent employee\nof the Board may be terminated without notice--\n\n(i) on his attaining the age of retirement or by reason of a\ndeclaration by the competent medical authority that he is\nunfit for further service; or\n\n(ii) as a result of disciplinary action;\n\n(iii) if he remains absent from duty, on leave or otherwise,\nfor a continuous period exceeding 2 years.\n\n34. In case of a permanent employee, his services may be\nterminated by serving three months' notice or on payment of\nsalary for the corresponding period in lieu thereof.\"\n The High Court had come to the conclusion \nin that case\n\nthat \nRegulation 34\n was arbitrary in nature and suffered from\nthe vice of enabling discrimination. The High Court, there-\nfore, struck down the first paragraph of \nRegulation 34\n and\nas a consequence quashed the order terminating the services\nof the first respondent therein. It was contended before\nthis court on appeal that the \nRegulation 34\n did not offend\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution, that \nSections 18-A\n and \n19\n of\nthe Electricity Supply Act laid down sufficient guidelines\nfor the exercise of the power under \nRegulation 34\n and in any\ncase the power to terminate the services of any permanent\nemployee was vested in high ranking officials who might be\nexpected to exercise the same in a\n\n180\n\nreasonable way. This Court was unable to accept that argu-\nment. This Court was of the view that the regulation was\ntotally arbitrary and conferred on the Board a power which\nwas capable of vicious discrimination. This Court was of the\nview that it was naked 'hire and fire' rule, the time for\nbanishing which, according to this Court in the said deci-\nsion, altogether from employer-employee relationship was\nfast approaching. It is only parallel, this Court was of the\nview, to the Henry VIII clause so familiar to administrative\nlawyers.\n\n Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Moti\nRam Deka v. North East Frontier Railway, [1985] 5 SCR 683,\nwhere Rules 148(3) and 149(3) of the Indian Railway Estab-\nlishment Code had been challenged on the ground that these\nRules were contrary to \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution.\nThe challenge was upheld though no opinion was expressed on\nthe question whether the rule offended \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution or not since then \nArticle 14\n has been inter-\npreted in several decisions of this Court and conferment and\nexercise of arbitrary power on and by the State or its\ninstrumentalities have been frowned upon and struck down by\nthis Court as offending \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n \nIndeed, it was noted in \nS.S. Muley v. J.R.D. Tara\n,\n[1979] 2 SLR 438 by this Court that, Justice Sawant, of\nBombay High Court had considered at great length \nRegulation\n48(a)\n of the Air India Employees' Service Regulations which\nconferred similar power on the Corporation as \nRegulation 34\n\nconfers on the Board in the present case. The learned Judge\ntherein (Sawant, J.) had struck down that Regulation.\n \nReli-\nance had also been placed on another decision of the Bombay\nHigh Court in the case of \nManohar P. Kharkhar v. Raghuraj\n.\n[1981] 2 LLJ 459. This Court found it difficult to accept\nthe reasoning therein. In that view of the matter the appeal\nwas dismissed.\n\n \nReference in this connection may also be made to the\ndecision of this Court in \nCentral Inland Water Transport\nCorporation Limited and Anr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Anr.\n,\n[1986] 3 SCC 156. There the appellant-Corporation was a\nGovernment company incorporated under the \nCompanies Act\n. The\nmajority shares of the Corporation were held by the States\nof West Bengal and Assam. \nArticle 51\n of the Articles of\nAssociation of the Corporation conferred upon the President\nof India power to issue directions/instructions regarding\naffairs and conduct of the business of the Corporation or of\nthe Directors thereof as also regarding exercise and per-\nformance of its functions pertaining to national security\nand public interest. \nArticle 51-A\n of the\n\n181\n\nsaid articles entitled the President to call for returns,\naccounts etc. of the Corporation. \nArticles 14\n, 15\n, 16\n, 17\n\nand \n37\n conferred on the President power to appoint and\nremove Chairman and the Board of Directors of the Corpora-\ntion. \nArticles 41\n and \n42\n were regarding the' President's\ncontrol over the working of the Corporation. \nArticle 47\n\nprovided for appointment of the auditors of the Corporation\nto be made by the Central Government on the advice of the\nComptroller' and Auditor-General of India and the nature of\ncontrol to be exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor-\nGeneral in the matter of audit and accounts. Since another\ncompany namely the Rivers Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. was\ncarrying on the same business as the Corporation was doing,\na Scheme of Arrangement was entered into between the Corpo-\nration and that Company for dissolution of the latter and\ntaking over of its business and liabilities by the former.\nThe Scheme, inter alia, stipulated that the Corporation\nshall take as many of the existing staff or labour as were\npossible and that those who could not be taken over shall be\npaid by the transferor company all moneys due to them under\nthe law and all legitimate and legal compensations payable\nto them either under \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n or otherwise\nlegally admissible and that such moneys shall be provided by\nthe Government of India to the transferor Company who would\npay these dues. The Calcutta High Court approved the Scheme.\nEach of the respondents therein were in the service of the\nsaid company. Their services were taken over by the Corpora-\ntion after the High Court's sanction to the Scheme of Ar-\nrangement. While the respondent Ganguly therein was appoint-\ned as the Deputy Chief Accounts Officer and was later pro-\nmoted as Manager (Finance), the respondent Sengupta was\nappointed as Chief Engineer (River Services) and was later\npromoted as General Manager (River Services)- Their appoint-\nment letters were in stereotype forms under which the Corpo-\nration could without any previous notice terminate their\nservices, if the Corporation was satisfied that the employee\nwas unfit medically or if he was guilty of any insubordina-\ntion, intemperance or other misconduct, or of any breach of\nany rules pertaining to this service or conduct or non-\nperformance of his duties. The letters of appointment fur-\nther stipulated that they would have been subject to the\nrules and regulations of Corporation. Rule 9(i) of the\nCorporation's Service, Discipline and Appeal Rules of 1979\nhad provided that the services of permanent employee could\nbe terminated on three months' pay plus DA to the employee\nor on deduction of a like amount from his salary as the case\nmight be in lieu of the notice. By confidential letter the\nrespondent Ganguly was asked to reply within 24 hours to the\nallegations of negligence made against him. After having his\nrepresentation and detailed reply, a notice under\n\n182\n\nRule 9(i) was served on him terminating his services with\nimmediate effect by paying three months' pay. Similarly a\ncharge-sheet was issued to the respondent Sengupta intimat-\ning that a disciplinary inquiry was proposed against him\nunder the Rules and calling upon him to file his written\nstatement of defence. Sengupta denied the charges made\nagainst him and asked for inspection of documents and copies\nof statements of witnesses mentioned in the said charge-\nsheet. But a notice was serviced on him under Rule 9(i)\nterminating his services with immediate effect of paying\nthree months' salary. Both Ganguly and Sengupta filed Writ\nPetitions before High Court. A Division Bench of that Court\nallowed the same. The Corporation filed appeals before this\nCourt. The main questions for determination therein were (i)\nwhether the appellant-Corporation was an instrumentality of\nthe State as to be covered by \nArticle 12\n and \n36\n of the\nConstitution and (ii) whether an unconscionable term in a\ncontract of employment entered into with the Corporation was\nvoid under \nSection 23\n of the Contract Act and violative of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution and as such whether Rule\n19(i) which formed part of the contract of employment be-\ntween the Corporation and its employees to whom the said\nRules applied, was void? This Court confirmed the judgment\nof the High Court with modification in the declaration made\nand dismissed the Corporation's appeal to this Court. This\nCourt held that the appellant was State within the meaning\nof \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution. This \nCourt further held\n\nthat an unconscionable bargain or contract is one which is\nirreconcilable with what is right or reasonable or the terms\nof which are so unfair and unreasonable that they shock the\nconscience of the Court. This Court was of the view that the\ndoctrine of distributive justice is another jurisprudential\nconcept which has affected the law of contracts. According\nto that doctrine, distributive fairness and justice in the\npossession of wealth and property could be achieved not only\nby taxation and regulatory control of private and contractu-\nal transactions even though this might involve some sacri-\nfice of individual liberty. This Court referred to \narticles\n38\n and \n39\n of the Constitution so far as the test of reasona-\nbleness was concerned. The test of reasonableness or fair-\nness of a clause in a contract where there was inequality of\nbargaining power is another theory recognised in the sphere\nof law of contacts. It was reiterated in that decision that\nthe Courts will not enforce and will, when called upon to do\nso, strike down an unfair and unreasonable contract, or a\nclause in the contract.\n Reference was made to the observa-\ntions of Lord Diplock in A. Schroeder Music Publishing Co.\nLtd. v. Macaulay (formerly Instone), [1974] i W.L.R. 1308\nand that test was:\n\n183\n\n\"Whether the restrictions are both reasonably necessary for\nthe protection of the legitimate interests of the promisee\nand commensurate with the benefits secured to the promiser\nunder the contract? For the purpose of this test all the\nprovisions of the contract must be taken into\nconsideration.\"\n\n Justice Madon of this Court in the said decision found\nthat this was in consonance with right and reason, intended\nto secure social and economic justice and conformed to the\nmandate of the equality clause in \nArticle 14\n of the Consti-\ntution. It was further recognised that there might be myriad\nsituations which result in unfair and unreasonable bargains\nbetween parties possessing wholly disproportionate and\nunequal bargaining power. These cases can neither be enumer-\nated nor fully illustrated. The Court must judge each case\non its own facts and circumstances. The above principle\nwould apply, this Court reiterated, where the inequality of\nbargaining power is the result of the disparity in the\neconomic strength of the contracting parties or where the\ninequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the\ncreation of the parties or not or where the weaker party is\nin a position in which he could obtain goods or services or\nmeans of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the\nstronger party or go without them or where a man had no\nchoice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his\nassent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in pre-\nscribed or standard form or to accept a set of rules as part\nof the contract, however, unfair, unreasonable and uncon-\nscionable clause in that contract or form or rules might be.\nThis Court, however, reiterated that this principle would\nnot apply where the bargaining power of the contracting\nparties is equal or almost equal. This principle would not\napply where both parties are businessmen and the contract is\na commercial transaction. The contracts of this type to\nwhich the principle formulated above applied were not con-\ntracts which were tainted with illegality but were contracts\nwhich contained terms which were so unfair and unreasonable\nthat they shock the conscience of the Court. In the vast\nmajority of cases such contracts are entered into by the\nweaker party under pressure of circumstances, generally\neconomic, which results in inequality of bargaining power.\nSuch contracts will not fall within the four corners of the\ndefinition of \"undue influence\" given in \nSection 16(1)\n of\nthe Contract Act, even though at times they are between\nparties one of whom holds a real or apparent authority over\nthe other. Contracts in prescribed or standard forms or\nwhich embody a set of rules as part of the contract are\nentered into by the party with superior bargaining power\nwith large number of persons or\n\n184\n\na group of persons, if they are unconscionable, unfair and\nunreasonable, are injurious to the public interest, should\nbe adjudged void according to Justice Madon, under \nSection\n23\n of the Contract Act on the ground of being opposed to\npublic policy. Public policy, it was reiterated, is not the\npolicy of any particular Government. It connotes some matter\nwhich concerns the public good and the public interest. The\nprinciples governing public policy must be and are capable\non proper occasion, of expansion or modification. If there\nis no head of public policy which covers a case, then the\nCourt must in consonance with public conscience and in\nkeeping with public goods and public interest declare such\npractice to be opposed to public policy. In any case which\nis not covered by authority, courts should be guided by the\nPreamble to the Constitution and the principles underlying\nthe Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. Rule\n9(i) can aptly be called 'the Henry VIII Clause\" this Court\nopined therein. It confers an absolute, arbitrary and un-\nguided power upon the Corporation to exercise that power.\nThis Court was concerned with the \"Central Inland Water\nTransport Corporation Ltd. Service Discipline and Appeal\nRules\" framed by the Corporation. The relevant provisions of\nthe said Rule 9 relating to permanent employees therein were\nas follows:\n\n\"9. Termination of employment for Acts other than misdemea-\nnour--\n\n(i) The employment of a permanent employee shall be subject\nto termination on three months' notice on either side. The\nnotice shall be in writing on either side. The Company may\npay the equivalent of three months basic pay and dearness\nallowances, if any, in lieu of notice or may deduct a like\namount when the employee has failed to give due notice.\n\n(ii) The services of a permanent employee can be terminated\non the grounds of \"services no longer required in the inter-\n\nest of the Company\" without assigning any reason. A perma-\nnent employee whose services are terminated under this\nclause shall be paid 15 days' basic pay and dearness allow-\nance for each completed year of continuous service in the\nCompany as compensation. In addition he will be entitled to\nencashment of leave to his credit.\"\n\nThis Court found that Rule 9(i) can be called 'the Henry\nVIII\n\n185\n\nClause'. It confers an absolute,-arbitrary and unguided\npower upon the Corporation. It does not even say who on\nbehalf of the Corporation was to exercise that power. While\nthe Rules provided for four different modes in which the\nservices of a permanent employee could be terminated earlier\nthan his attaining the age of superannuation, namely, Rules\n9(i), 9(ii), 36(iv)(b) read with 38 and 37, Rule 9(i) is the\nonly rule which does not state in what circumstances the\npower conferred by that rule is to be exercised. Thus even\nwhere the Corporation could proceed under a regular disci-\nplinary inquiry, it is free to resort instead to Rule 9(i)\nin order to avoid the trouble of an inquiry. No opportunity\nof a hearing was at all intended to be afforded to the\npermanent employee whose service was being terminated in the\nexercise of that power. It violated audi alteram partem rule\nof natural justice also which was implicit in \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution. It is not covered by any of the situations\nwhich would justify the total exclusion of the audi alteram\nparterm rule. The view that the Board of Directors would not\nexercise this power arbitrarily or capriciously as it con-\nsisted of responsible and highly placed persons ignored, it\nwas held, the fact that however highly placed a person might\nbe, he must necessarily possess human frailties and \"power\ntends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\nIt was, however, held that Rule 9(i) was also discriminatory\nfor the Corporation was given power to discriminate between\nemployee and employee. It was stated that it could back up\none employee and apply to him Rule 9(i). It could pick up\nanother employee and apply to him Rule 9(ii). It was further\nreiterated that the Corporation was a large organisation.\nThe said Rules formed part of the contract of employment\nbetween the Corporation and its employees who were not\nworkmen. These employees had no powerful Union to support\nthem. They had no voice in the framing of the said Rules.\nThey had no choice but to accept the said Rules as part of\ntheir contract of employment. There was gross disparity\nbetween the Corporation and its employees, whether they be\nworkmen or officers. The Corporation could afford to dis-\npense with the services of an officer and will find many\nothers to take his place but an officer cannot afford to\nlose his job because if he does so, there are not many jobs\nwaiting for him. It was, therefore, held that clause 9(i) of\nthe said regulation was against right and reasons and it was\nwholly unconscionable. It had been entered into between\nparties between whom there was gross inequality of bargain-\ning power. Rule 9(i) was a term of the contract between the\nCorporation and all its officers, it was noted. It affected\na large number of persons and it squarely fell within\nthe principle stated earlier. The Government and its agen-\ncies and instrumentalities constitute the largest employer\nin the country. A\n\n186\n\nclause such as Rule 9(i) in a contract of employment, it was\nnoted, affecting large sections of the public was harmful\nand injurious to the public interest for it tended to create\na sense of insecurity in the minds of those to whom it\napplied and consequently against public good. Such a clause,\ntherefore, was opposed to public policy and as such it is\nvoid under \nSection 23\n of the Contract Act, it was held. It\nwas further held that it was not possible to accept the\ncontention that this was a contract entered into by the\nCorporation like any other contract entered into by it in\nthe course of its trading activities and the Court, there-\nfore, ought not to interfere with it. The employees could\nnot be equated with goods which could be bought and sold,\nnor could a contract of employment be equated with a mercan-\ntile transaction between two businessmen much less when the\ncontract of employment was between a powerful employer and a\nweak employee. Although it was reiterated that the aforesaid\nrule 9(i) was supported by mutuality inasmuch as it con-\nferred an equal right upon both the parties but considering\nthe unequal position of the Corporation and its employees,\nthere was no real mutuality, this Court opined. It was\nreiterated that the Corporation being covered by \nArticle 12\n,\nits actions must also be in accordance with the Directive\nPrinciples prescribed by Part IV of the Constitution. Refer-\nence may be made to paragraph 39 of the aforesaid decision\nwhere this Court noted that in the working of the Constitu-\ntion, it was found that some of the provisions of the Con-\nstitution were not adequate for the needs of the country or\nfor ushering in a Welfare State and the constituent body\nempowered in that behalf amended the Constitution several\ntimes. By the very first amendment made in the Constitution,\nnamely, by the \nConstitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951\n\nclause (6) of \nArticle 19\n was amended with retrospectitive\neffect. \nUnder this amemdment, sub-clause (g) of \nArticle\n19(1)\n which guarantees to all citizens the right to carry on\noccupation, trade or business, was not to prevent the State\nfrom making any law relating to the carrying on by the\nState, or by a Corporation owned or controlled by the State,\nof any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the\nexclusion, complete or partial of citizens or otherwise.\nThis amendment also validated the operation of all existing\nlaws insofar as these had made similar provisions. \nArticle\n298\n of the Constitution, as originally enacted, provided\nthat the executive power of the Union and of each State was\nto extend, subject to any law made by the appropriate legis-\nlature, to the grant, sale, disposition or mortgage of any\nproperty held for the purposes of the Union or of such State\nas the case may be, and to the purchase or acquisition of\nproperty for those purposes respectively, and to the making\nof contracts. and it further provided that all property\nacquired for the purposes of the Union or of\n\n187\n\nState was to vest in the Union or in such State, as the case\nmight be. This Court referred to the decision of this Court\nin \nSukhdev v. Bhagatrarn Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi\n, [1975] 3\nSCR 619, \"the Governing power wherever located must be\nsubject to the fundamental constitutional limitations.\"\n The High Court in the judgment under appeal was unable\nto accept the plea of alternative remedy and allowed the\nWrit Petition and declared regulation 9(b) of the Regula-\ntions to be illegal and ultra vires and as a consequence\nthereof the orders terminating the services of respondents\nNos. 1 to 4 were quashed and these respondents were deemed\nto be in the service of DTC and back wages and all other\nbenefits by way of annual increments were directed to be\npaid.\n\n Learned Solicitor General of India contended before us\nthat in the facts and the circumstances of this case, there\nwas sufficient guideline in the \nRegulation 9(b)\n and the\npower of termination, properly read, would not be arbitrary\nor violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. It may be\nmentioned that under the general law of contract of employ-\nment, which was commonly known as the 'law of master and\nservant', which is not termed as law of employer and employ-\nee, whether the contract of service is for a fixed period or\nnot, if it contained a provision for its termination by\nnotice, it could be so terminated. If there was no provision\nfor giving notice and the contract was not for a fixed\nperiod, the law implied an obligation to give a reasonable\nnotice. Where no notice in the first case or no reasonable\nnotice in the second case was given and the contract was\nwrongfully terminated, such wrongful termination would give\nrise to a claim for damages. In this connection, reference\nmay be made to the observations of this Court in the five-\njudge bench decision in Union of India & Anr. v. Tulsi Ram\nPatel, [1985] Supp. 2 SCR 131 at p. 166. This is also the\nposition at common law. See Chitty on Contract; 26th Edition\nVol. II, p. 808 or 25th Edition Vol. II p. 712, paragraph\n3490. In this connection, reliance may also be placed at\nparagraphs 607 and 608 of Volume No. 16, 4th Edition of\nHalsbury's Law of England.\n\n \nUnder the Industrial Law, subject to the relevant statu-\ntory provision, the services of an employee could be termi-\nnated by reasonable notice. In such a case it was always\nopen to the Industrial Tribunal to examine whether the power\nof termination by reasonable notice was exercised bona fide\nor mala fide. If, however, the industrial Court was satis-\nfied that the order of discharge was punitive, that it was\nmala fide, or that it amounted to victimisation or unfair\nlabour practice, the\n\n188\n\nindustrial court was competent to set aside the order and in\nproper cases, direct the reinstatement of the employee.\nReference may also be made to the observations of this Court\nin \nTata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen & Anr.\n, [1964] 2 SCR\n125 at 130. If, however, the exercise of such power was\nchallenged on the ground of being colourable or mala fide or\non account of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the\nemployer must disclose to the Court the ground of his im-\npugned action, so that the same may be tested judicially.\nSee the observations of this Court in L. Michael & Anr. v.\nM/s Johnston Pumps India Ltd., [1975] 3 SCR 489 at 498.\n The relationship between a statutory corporation and its\nemployees is normally governed by the relevant rules, regu-\nlations and standing orders. A statutory Corporation is\n\"State\" within the meaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution\nand its action is subject to judicial review in certain\ncases and certain circumstances. In the facts and circum-\nstances of these cases, we have proceeded on that basis and\nwe are of the opinion that it is the correct basis. The\nexercise of such power under regulations similar to the one\nimpugned which has been upheld in various types of cases are\ninstructive in their variety.\n \nIt may be mentioned that the\nexercise of power under the very same \nRegulation 9(b)\n was\nupheld by the Court in a matter, wherein in an action by the\nemployee of D.T.C., this Court in Delhi Transport Corpora-\ntion \nUndertaking v. Balbir Saran Goel\n, [1970] 3 SCR 757 at\n764 held that even if the employees of the respondent\nthought that he was a cantankerous man and it was not de-\nsirable to retain him in service it was open to them to\nterminate his services in terms of \nRegulation 9(b)\n and it\nwas not necessary to dismiss by way of punishment for mis-\nconduct.\n\n Reliance was placed on this decision by the High Court\nin the Judgment under appeal. The High Court in our opinion\nrightly pointed out, however, that the decision was on a\ndifferent basis and could not be availed of in deciding\ncontroversy involved in the present determination. \nIn \nAir\nIndia Corporation, Bombay v. V.A. Rebellow & Anr.\n, [1972] 3\nSCR 606, this Court dealing with the power of the Air India\nto terminate the services of a person who was alleged to\nhave misbehaved with air hostesses, observed on page 6 16 of\nthe report that the anxiety of the Legislature to effective-\nly achieve the object of duly protecting the workmen against\nvictimisation of unfair labour practice consistently with\nthe preservation of the employer's bona fide right to main-\ntain discipline and efficiency in the industry for securing\nthe maximum production in peaceful, harmonious atmosphere is\nobvious from the\n\n189\n\noverall scheme of these sections. This Court on page 620 of\nthe report observed that the record merely disclosed that\nthe appellant had suspicion about the complainant's suit-\nability for the job in which he was employed and this led to\nloss of confidence in him with the result that his services\nwere terminated under \nRegulation 48\n. Loss of confidence in\nsuch circumstances could not be considered to be mala fide,\nit was held.\n \nSimilarly in \nMunicipal Corporation of Greater\nBombay v. P.S. Malvenkar & Ors.\n, [1978] 3 SCR 1000 at page\n1006, where it was alleged that the services of an employee\nof Bombay Municipal Corporation were unsatisfactory, this\nCourt held that the powers of dismissal after an inquiry and\nthe powers of simpliciter termination are to distinct and\nindependent powers and as far as possible neither should be\nconstrued so as to emasculate the other or to render it\nineffective. One is the power to punish an employee for\nmisconduct while the other is the power to terminate sim-\npliciter the service of an employee without any other ad-\nverse consequence.\n\n \nIt may be mentioned that the case of civil servants is,\nhowever, governed by their special constitutional position\nwhich accords them status; the legal relationship (between\nthe Government and its servants) is something entirely\ndifferent, something in the nature of status. It is much\nmore than a purely contractual relationship voluntarily\nentered into between the parties. The duties of state are\nfixed by the law and in the enforcement of these duties\nsociety has an interest. In the language of jurisprudence\nstatus is a condition of membership of a group of which\npowers and duties are exclusively determined by law and not\nby agreement between the parties concerned. See the observa-\ntions of this Court in \nRoshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India\n,\n[1968] 1 SCR 185 at 195 D-E. But even then the services of a\ntemporary civil servant (although entitled to the protection\nof \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution) is subject to termina-\ntion by notice. But beside the above, the government may\nfind it necessary to terminate the services of a temporary\nservant if it is not satisfied with his conduct or his\nsuitability for the job and/or his work.\n See the observa-\ntions of this Court in Champak Lal Chiman Lal Shah v. The\nUnion of India, [1964] 5 SCR 190 at 204. The services of a\ntemporary government servant, further. may be terminated on\none month's notice whenever the government thinks it neces-\nsary or expedient to do so for administrative reasons. It is\nimpossible, this Court observed, to define before hand all\nthe circumstances in which the discretion can be exercised.\nThe discretion was necessarily left to the Government. \nSee\nobservations of this Court in \nRam Gopal Chaturvedi v. State\nof M. P.\n, [1970] 1 SCR 472 at 475.\n\n190\n\n The aforesaid position of a government servant has been\nanalysed in depth by the decision of this Court in Union of\nIndia v. Tulsi Ram Patel, (supra), where it was reiterated\nthat the doctrine of pleasure is not a relic of the feudal\nages or based upon any special prerogative of the Crown but\nis based on public interest and for the public good because\nit is as much in public interest and for public good that\ngovernment servants who are inefficient, dishonest or cor-\nrupt or have become a security risk should not continue in\nservice and that the protection afforded to them by the Acts\nand the Rules made under \nArticle 309\n and by \nArticle 311\n of\nthe Constitution be not abused by them to the detriment of\nthe public interest and public good. It was reiterated on\npage 190 of the report that if in a situation as envisaged\nin one of the three clauses of the second proviso to Clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n arises and the relevant clause is proper-\nly applied and the disciplinary inquiry dispensed with, the\nconcerned government servant cannot be heard to complain\nthat he is deprived of his livelihood. This Court reiterated\nthat the livelihood of an individual is a matter of great\nconcern to him and his family but his livelihood is a matter\nof his private interest where such livelihood is provided by\nthe public exchequer and the taking away of such livelihood\nis in the public interest and for the public good, and the\nformer must yield to the latter public policy, it was reit-\nerated, requires, public interest needs and public good\ndemands that there should be such a doctrine. It was further\nreiterated that the rules of natural justice are not immuta-\nble but flexible. These rules can be adopted and modified by\nstatutes and statutory rules and also by the constitution of\nthe Tribunal which has to decide a particular matter and the\nrules by which such Tribunal is governed. Not only, can the\nprinciples of natural justice be modified but in exceptional\ncases they can even be excluded. See the observations of\nthis Court at page 237 G of the aforesaid report. Reference\nwas also made to the observations of this Court at pages\n214-215 of the aforesaid report. Thus, the Constitution\nBench laid down that even where a government servant enjoys\nconstitutional status there can be exclusion of inquiry in\nthe cases prescribed for termination of employment.\n It must, however, be borne in mind that in some recent\ncases this Court has taken the view that a regulation pro-\nviding for the termination of the service of an employee of\nthe public corporation by notice only or pay in lieu thereof\nis invalid under \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. \nWe have\nreferred to the decisions of the \nWorkmen of Hindustan\nSteel\n's case (supra); West Bengal State Electricity Board's\ncase (supra) and Central Inland Water Transport Corpora-\ntion's case (supra).\n \nMr.\n\n191\n\nAshok Desai, learned Solicitor General of India submitted\nthat the decisions in the \nWest Bengal State Electricity\nBoard\n's (supra) and Central Inland Water Transport Corpora-\ntion's case (supra) were incorrectly decided and the deci-\nsion proceeded on the theory of unconscionable bargains and\nthat termination by notice is against public policy.\n He,\nhowever, drew our attention to Gheru Lal Parekh v. Mahadeo-\ndas Maiya & Others, [1959] Supp. 2 SCR 406 and 440 where it\nwas held that though theoretically it may be permissible to\nevolve a new head under exceptional circumstances in a\nchanging world, it is advisable in the interest of stability\nof society not to make any attempt to discover new heads of\navoidance of such clauses in these days. Furthermore, as\nstated above, learned Solicitor General submitted that in\nthe ordinary law of contract termination of employment by\nreasonable notice on either side has never been regarded as\nunconscionable. Therefore, the learned Solicitor General\nsubmitted that this part of the above judgments was errone-\nous and should be overruled.\n\n It must, however, be noted that in a later judgment of\nthis Court, which followed this line of reasoning, it was\nrecognised that a public corporation requires protection\nfrom employees who are inefficient or those who lacked\nprobity or even made faulty policy decisions. Reference was\nmade to the decision of this Court in O.P. Bhandari v. 1.\nT.D.C. & Ors., [1986] 4 SCC 337 where this Court held that\nso far as some of the higher placed employees are concerned\n(described as 'gold collar' employees) public sector under-\ntakings may be exposed to irreversible damage on account of\nfaulty policy decisions or on account of lack of efficiency\nor probity of such employees and its very existence might be\nendangered beyond recall. A public corporation may not be\nable to cut the dead wood and get rid of a managerial cadre\nemployee in case he is considered to be wanting in perform-\nance or integrity. Reference may be made to page 343 para-\ngraph 5 (supra) of the report. It may be mentioned that in\nMoti Ram Deka's case (supra) at p. 707 of the said report, a\nsimilar rule was considered by seven learned Judges in the\ncontext of government servants in Railway. The majority\njudgment did not express opinion on the question of the\nRailway rule being bad on the ground of unguided and uncana-\nlised power. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Das Gupta held\nthat the rule gave no guidance and was, therefore, violative\nof \nArticle 14.\n (See page 769 of the report). On this point\nMr. Justice Shah, as the learned Chief Justice then was, in\nhis judgment observed at page 799-800 of the aforesaid\nreport:\n\n\"In considering the validity of an order an assumption that\nthe power may be exercised mala fide and on that ground\n\n192\n\ndiscrimination may be practised is wholly out of place.\nBecause of the absence of specific directions in Rule 148\ngoverning the exercise of authority conferred thereby, the\npower to terminate employment cannot be regarded as an\narbitrary power exercisable at the sweet will of the author-\nity, when having regard to the nature of the employment and\nthe service to be rendered, the importance of the efficient\nfunctioning of the rail transport in the scheme of our\npublic economy, and the status of the authority invested\nwith the exercise of power would appropriately be exercised\nfor the protection of public interest on grounds of adminis-\ntrative convenience. Power to exercise discretion is not\nnecessarily to be assumed to be a power which will invali-\ndate the conferment of power. Conferment of power has neces-\nsarily to be coupled with the duty to exercise it bona fide\nand for effectuating the purpose and policy underlying the\nrules which provide for the exercise of the power. If in the\nscheme of the rule, a clear policy relating to the circum-\nstances in which the power is to be exercised is discerni-\nble, the conferment of power must be regarded as being made\nin furtherance of the scheme, and is not open to attack as\ninfringing the' equality clause. It may be remembered that\nthe rules relating to termination of employment of temporary\nservants and those on probation, and even those relating to\ncompulsory retirement generally do not lay down any specific\ndirections governing the exercise of the powers conferred\nthereby. The reason is obvious: the appointing authority\nmust in all these cases be left with discretion to determine\nemployment having regard to the exigencies of the service,\nsuitability of the employee for absorption or continuance in\nthe cadre, and the larger. interest of the public being\nserved by retaining the public servant concerned in\nservice.\"\n\n \nLearned Solicitor General submitted that the question is\nwhether it is the very existence of power which is bad or\nthe exercise is bad in any specific case. It was submitted\nthat the Court would be entitled to obtain guidance from the\npreamble, the policy and the purpose of the Act and the\npower conferred under it and to see that the power is exer-\ncised only for that purpose. It was submitted that even if a\nstatute makes no clarification Court would ascertain if the\nstatute laid down any principle or policy. In such a case,\nthe statute will be upheld although a given exercise may be\nstruck down in particular cases. See\n\n193\n\nthe observations of this Court in \nShri Ram Krishna Dalmia v.\nJustice Tandolkar\n, [1959] SCR 279 at 299. The guidance in\nthe statute for the exercise of discretion may be found from\nthe preamble read in the light of surrounding circumstances\nor even from the policy or the purpose of the enactment or\ngenerally from the object sought to be achieved.\n See the\nobservations of this Court in Jyoti Prasad v. The Adminis-\ntrator for the Union Territory of Delhi, [1962] 2 SCR 125 at\n\n139. Even a term like 'public interest' can be sufficient\nguidance in the matter of retirement of a government employ-\nee. See the observations of this Court in \nUnion of India v.\nCol\n. J.N. Sinha & Anr., [1970] 2 SCC 458 at 461 and such a\nprovision can be read into a statute even when it is not\notherwise expressly there.\n \nLearned Solicitor General draw\nour attention to the observations of this Court in \nN.C.\nDalwadi v. State of Gujarat\n, [1987] 3 SCC 611 paragraphs 9\nand 10 at page 619. It is well settled and the learned\nSolicitor General made a point of it that the Court will\nsustain the presumption of constitutionality by considering\nmatters of common knowledge and to assume every state of\nfacts which can be conceived and can even read down the\nsection, it was submitted, if it becomes necessary to uphold\nthe validity of the provision.\n Reliance was placed on the\ndecision of this Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P.,\nIndore & Ors. v. Radhakrishan & Ors., [1979] 2 SCC 249 at\n\n257.\n In the case of Olga Tellis & Ors. etc. v. Bombay Munici-\npal Corporation & Ors., [1985] Suppl. 2 SCR 51 at 89 this\nCourt has held that considering the scheme of the act, a\nsection which enabled the Commissioner to remove encroach-\nment without notice must be read to mean that notice would\nbe given unless circumstances are such that it is not rea-\nsonably practicable to give it. This \nCourt further held\n that\nthe discretion is to be exercised in a reasonable manner so\nas to comply with the constitutional mandate that the proce-\ndure accompanying the performance of a public act must be\nfair and reasonable. We must lean in favour of that inter-\npretation because it helps to sustain the validity of the\nlaw.\n\n Learned Solicitor General submitted that the appeal\ninvolved herein the power of Delhi Transport Corporation (a\nstatutory corporation) regarding termination of service\nsimpliciter under \nRegulation 9(b)\n. These Regulations were\nframed as mentioned under Section 53 of the Delhi Road\nTransport Authority Act, 1950. The said Act was replaced by\nthe \nDelhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957\n but the regula-\ntions have been saved and even though in 1971 a new Corpora-\ntion, viz. the Delhi Transport Corporation (the appellant),\nwas constituted\n\n194\n\nunder the \nRoad Transport Corporation Act, 1950\n, the regula-\ntions have been continued.\n\n The guidelines for the exercise of such power, according\nto the Solicitor General, could be found in the statutory\nprovisions of the 1950 Act under which the regulations have\nbeen framed, the preamble; \nSections 19\n and \n20\n (equivalent to\n\nSections 18\n and \n19\n of the Road Transport Corporation Act,\n1950); \nSection 53\n (equivalent to 45 of the \nRoad Transport\nCorporation Act, 1950\n); the context of \nRegulation 9(b)\n read\nwith 9(a) and 15. Even for the exercise of this power,\nreasons could be recorded although they need not be communi-\ncated. This will ensure according to the Solicitor General,\na check on the arbitrary exercise of power and effective\njudicial review in a given case. The present regulations are\nparallel, to but not identical with, the exceptions carved\nout under \nArticle 311(2)\n proviso. It was submitted that even\nthe power of termination simpliciter under \nRegulation 9(b)\n\ncan only be exercised in circumstances other than those in\n\nRegulation 9(a)\n, i.e., not where the foundation of the order\nis 'misconduct'. The exercise of such power can only be for\npurposes germane and relevant to the statute. It was submit-\nted by the learned Solicitor General that these would in-\nclude several cases which have been held by Courts to give\nrise to termination simpliciter including where the employee\nshows such incompetence or unsuitability as to make his\ncontinuance in employment detrimental in the interest of the\nCorporation, where the continuance of the employee is a\ngrave security risk making his continuance detrimental in\nthe interest of the Corporation, if there is a justifiable\nlack of confidence which makes it necessary in the interest\nof the Corporation to immediately terminate the services.\nThese are illustrative and not exhaustive.\n\n It was submitted by the learned Solicitor General that\nthe above guidelines of recording reasons and confining\naction under \nRegulation 9(b)\n for purposes germane and rele-\nvant to the statute would prevent arbitrary action by the\nCorporation while enabling it to run its services efficient-\nly and in public interest. Thus, there is no vice of arbi-\ntrariness in the regulation. The judgment of the High Court,\ntherefore, cannot and should not be upheld according to the\nlearned Solicitor General.\n\n In Civil Appeal No. 2876 of 1986, the learned Attorney\nGeneral urged that the settled rule judicially evolved in\nmatters of constitutional adjudication is that in order to\nsustain the constitutionality of legislation, the words of a\nstatute may be qualified, its operation limited and condi-\ntions, limitations and obligations may be implied or\n\n195\n\nread into the statute in order to make it conform to consti-\ntutional requirements. The underlying rationale, according\nto the learned Attorney General, of this rule of interpreta-\ntion, or the doctrine of reading down of a statute is that\nwhen a legislature, whose powers are not unlimited, enacts a\nstatute, it is aware of its limitations, and in the absence\nof express intention or clear language to the contrary, it\nmust be presumed to have implied into the statute the requi-\nsite limitations and conditions to immunise it from the\nvirus of unconstitutionality. From what the learned Attorney\nGeneral submitted and what appears to be the correct that\nevery legislature intends to act within its powers. There-\nfore, in a limited Government, the legislature attempts to\nfunction within its limited powers. It would not, therefore,\nbe expected to have intended to transgress its limits. In Re\nThe Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act, [1941] FCR 12, the\nquestion before the Federal Court was about the meaning of\nthe word 'property' in the Act. The Court limited the opera-\ntion of the word 'property' to property other than agricul-\ntural land because otherwise the Central Legislature would\nhave had no competence to enact the statute. The Court\nobserved at pages 26 and 27 of the Report as follows:\n\n\"No doubt if the Act does affect agricultural land in the\nGovernors' Provinces, it was beyond the competence of the\nLegislature to enact it: and whether or not it does so much\ndepend upon the meaning which is to be given to the word\n'property' in the Act. If that word necessarily and inevita-\nbly comprises all forms of property, including agricultural\nland, then clearly the Act went beyond the powers of the\nLegislature; but when a Legislature with limited and re-\nstricted powers makes use of a word of such wide and general\nimport, the presumption must surely be that it is using it\nwith reference to that kind of property with respect to\nwhich it is competent to legislate and to no other. The\nquestion is thus one of construction, and unless the Act is\nto be regarded as wholly meaningless and ineffective, the\nCourt is bound to construe the word 'property' as referring\nonly to those forms of property with respect to which the\nLegislature which enacted the Act was competent to legis-\nlate; that is to say, the property other than agricultural\nland ...... \"\n\n \nSee also the observations of Chief Justice Gwyer at\npages 27 to 29 of the Report on how legislations of legisla-\nture with limited powers should be construed. See also the\nobservations of this Court in \nR.M.D.\n\n196\n\nChamarbaugwalla v. Union of India\n, [1957] SCR 930, at p. 935\nand 938. There \nsection 2(d)\n of Prize Competitions Act, 1955\ndefined 'prize competition' as meaning any competition in\nwhich prizes are offered for the solution of any puzzle. As\ndefined, the statute covered not only competition in which\nsuccess depended on chance but also those which involved\nsubstantial degree of skill. It was conceded that the Act\nwould be violative of \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n of the Constitution\nif competitions which involved substantial degree of skill\nwere included in the statutory definition. See the observa-\ntions of this Court at p. 935 of the report. This Court\nrejected the argument of the petitioners therein that since\nthe language of the definition of prize competition was wide\nand unqualified, it was not open to the Court to read into\nit a limitation which was not there.\n \nThis principle was\nreiterated and applied by this Court in the case of \nKedar\nNath Singh v. State of Bihar\n, [1962] Supp. (2) SCR 769. The\nquestion before this Court was about the validity of\n s. 124A\n\nof the Indian Penal Code. This Court in order to sustain the\nvalidity of the section on the touch-stone of \nArticle\n19(1)(a)\n of the Constitution of India, limited its applica-\ntion only to acts involving intention or tendency to create\ndisorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to\nviolence. This Court held that it was well settled that if\ncertain provisions of law construed in one way would make\nthem consistent with the Constitution, and another interpre-\ntation would render them unconstitutional, the Court would\nlean in favour of the former construction. The provisions of\nthe sections read as a whole, along with the explanations,\nmake it reasonably clear that the sections aim at rendering\npenal only such activities as would be intended, or have a\ntendency, to create disorder or disturbance of public peace\nby resort to violence.\n\n \nReference may also be made to the decision of this Court\nin \nR.L. Arora v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n, [1964] 6 SCR 784\nwhere the question was about the Constitutionality of sec-\ntion 41(aa) of the \nLand Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1962\n.\nThis Court upheld the validity of the section following the\nprinciple of interpreting the said rule in a way which would\nbe consistent with the Constitution. See the observations of\nthis Court at p. 797 of the said report.\n\n \nThe technique of reading down has been adopted in numer-\nous cases to sustain the validity of the provision. For\nexample, in \nJagdish Pandey v. The Chancellor, University of\nBihar & Anr.\n, [1968] 1 SCR 23 1, at pages 236-37, this Court\nmade resort to section 4 of the Bihar State Universities\nAct, 1962. It was observed that \nsection 4\n so read literally\nit did appear to give uncanalised powers to the Chancellor\nto\n\n197\n\ndo what he liked on the recommendation of the Commission\nwith respect to teachers covered by it. But this Court was\nof the opinion that the legislature did not intend to give\nsuch an arbitrary power to the Chancellor and was of the\nopinion that s. 4 should be read down and if it is read\ndown, there was no reason to hold that the legislature was\nconferring a naked arbitrary power on the Chancellor and\nthat power cannot be struck down ,as discriminatory under\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n \nSee the observations of this\nCourt in \nSunil Batra v. Delhi Administration & Ors.\n, [1978]\n4 SCC 494. There the constitutionality of\n s. 30\n, sub-section\n(2) and \nsection 56\n of the Prisons Act, 1894 was in question.\nKrishna Iyer, J, speaking for this Court at p. 511, para 34,\nof the report observed that the Court does not 'rush in' to\ndemolish provisions where judicial endeavour, amelioratively\ninterpretational, may achieve both constitutionality and\ncompassionate resurrection. This salutary strategy, the\nlearned Judge observed, of sustaining the validity of the\nlaw and softening its application was of lovely dexterity.\nThe semantic technique of updating the living sense of a\ndated legislation is, in our view, perfectly legitimate.\nSemantic readjustments are necessary to obviate alegicidal\nsequel and a validation-oriented approach becomes the phi-\nlosophy of statutory construction sometimes.\n \nSimilar obser-\nvations were made in \nN.C. Dalwadi v. State of Gujarat\n,\n(supra).\n \nIn \nTinsukhia Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. State of\nAssam & Ors.\n, [1989] 3 SCC 709, this Court upheld the valid-\nity of \nsections 9\n and \n10\n of the Act by reading in several\nmatters by necessary implication in order to sustain the\nvalidity of the sections.\n \nIn \nCharan Lal Sahu & Ors. v. Union\nof India\n, [1989] Supp. SCALE 1, at pages 53 and 54, paras\n101 as well as p. 61, para 114, it was observed that this\nprinciple of reading down has been adopted in U.S. Supreme\nCourt in several cases.\n See also United States of America v.\nEdward A. Rumely, 97 Lawyers Edition 770 at 775. \nThe princi-\nple as enunciated in Rumely's case (supra) has been approved\nby this Court in \nShah & Co. v. State of Maharashtra\n, [1967]\n3 SCR 466 at 477-78. This principle of reading down or\nplacing limited construction has been adopted by courts in\nEngland in deciding the validity of bye-laws and regula-\ntions. See Reg.\n v. Sadlers Co., 10 H.L.C. 404, at 460 and\n463 and Faramus v. Film Artists Association, 1962 QB 527 at\n\n542. The courts must iron out the creases, as said Lord\nDenning in Seaford Court Estates, [1949] 2 KB 481. This\nCourt has also on numerous occasions followed this practice.\nSee the observations of this Court in M. Pentiah and Ors. v.\nVeera Mallappa and Ors., [1961] 2 SCR 295; Bangalore Water\nSupply and Sewerage Board etc. v. A. Rajappa & Ors., [1978]\n3 SCR 207. See also H.M. Seervai's 'Constitutional Law of\nIndia', 3rd Edn. Vol. I, pages 119-120. In the background of\nthis, the learned Attorney General also\n\n198\n\ndrew our attention that the present regulation, as mentioned\nhereinbefore, should be read and construed in the said\nmanner and the reasons and conditions of its exercise can be\nspelt out and it may be so construed. He submitted that it\nshould be spelt out that the regulation requires reasons to\nbe there, reasons which are germane and relevant.\n The principles of natural justice or holding of an\nenquiry is neither a universal principle of justice nor\ninflexible dogma. The principles of natural justice are not\nincapable of exclusion in a given situation. For example,\n\nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution which essentially em-\nbodies the concept of natural justice, itself contemplates\nthat there may be situations which warrant or permit the\nnon-applicability of the principles underlying \nArticle\n311(2)\n of the Constitution. Reference may be made to the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution. This\ncourt has also recognised that the rule of audi alteram\npartera can be excluded where having regard to the nature of\nthe action to be taken, its object and purpose and the\nscheme of the relevant statutory provision, fairness in\naction does not demand its application and even warrants its\nexclusion. If importing the right to be heard has the effect\nof paral.Vsing the administrative process or the need for\npromptitude or the urgency of the situation so demands,\nnatural justice could be avoided. \nSee the observations of\nthis Court in \nManeka Gandhi\n's case at p. 681 of the report\n(supra).\n This Court in Tulsi Ram Patel's case (supra) had in\nterms ruled that not only, therefore, can the principles of\nnatural justice be modified but in exceptional cases they\ncan even be excluded. But the principles of natural justice\nmust not be displaced save in exceptional cases. Consequent-\nly, the learned Attorney General submitted that the words\n\"where it is not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry\"\n\nmay be imported into the regulations. It was submitted by\nthe learned Attorney General that the exclusion of audi\nalteram partera rule in circumstances which are circum-\nscribed and coupled with the safeguard of recording of\nreasons which are germane and relevant, the termination in\nsuch a situation would not render the regulation unreasona-\nble or arbitrary. Then it could not be said that the power\nwas uncanalised or unguided if the regulation is construed\nand read down in the manner indicated above, according to\nthe learned Attorney General. The reading down, the learned\nAttorney General conceded cannot, however, be done where\nthere was no valid reason and where it would be contrary to\nproclaimed purpose. See the observations of this Court in\n\nMinerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, [1981] 1\nSCR 206, at p. 239 and 259.\n\nOn behalf of the workmen of the respondent DTC, Shri\n\n199\n\nRamamurthi, submitted that the Constitutional questions of\ngreat public importance arising in the present appeal, have\nto be examined in the light of the law \nlaid down by\n the Full\nCourt in the case of R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, [1970] 3\nSCR 530 at 577 and by larger Constitution Benches in the\ncases of \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n (supra), Moti Ram\nDeka v. Union of India (\nsupra), State of West Bengal v.\nUnion of India\n, (supra) and the Constitution Bench decisions\nin the cases of \nOlga Tellis and Others v. Bombay Municipal\nCorporation and Others\n, (\nsupra), Fertilizer Corporation\nKamgar Union (Regd.) Sindri and Others v. Union of India and\nOthers\n, [1981] 2 SCR at 60-61, \nUnion of India v. Tulsiram\nPatel and Others\n (supra), Sukhdev Singh & Others v. Bhagat\nRam Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and Another (supra) and Ajay\nHasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. etc., [1981] 2\nSCR 79 at 100-102. According to Shri Ramamurthi these deci-\nsions are authority for the following propositions:\n\n \n(a) The declarations in the provisions contained in\nthe Fundamental Rights Chapter involve an obligation imposed\nnot merely upon the \"State\" but upon all persons to respect\nthe rights declared, unless the context indicates otherwise,\nagainst every person or agency seeking to infringe them. See\nthe observations of this Court in \nState of West Bengal v.\nUnion of India\n, [1964] 1 SCR 371 at page 438:\n\n (b) Part III of the Constitution weaves a pattern of\nguarantee on the texture of basic human rights. The guaran-\n\ntees delimit the protection of those rights in their allot-\nted field. They do not attempt to enunciate distinct right.\n[See R.C. Cooper's case (supra( at p. 577 of the report].\nThe extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental\nright is determined not by the object of the Legislature nor\n2by the form of the action, but by its direct operation upon\nthe individual's rights.\n\n \n(c) Any person who is deprived of his right to live-\nlihood except according to just and fair procedure estab-\nlished by law can challenge the deprivation as offending the\nright to life, conferred by \nArticle 21.\n See the observations\nof this Court in \nOlga Tellis\n's case (supra( at 80-81 and 85\nof the report.\n \nTherefore, the holding to the contrary in\n\nA.V. Nachane & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr.\n, [1982] 2 SCR\n246 is no longer good law.\n\n In any event Counsel is right that the observations\nmade at p. 259 of the report (supra) were in a different\ncontext and the challenge\n\n200\n\nbased on \nArticles 19(1)(g)\n and \n31\n does not appear to have\nany substance in resolving the present controversy before\nus. Mr. Ramamurthi submitted that provision of any Rule that\nservice shall be liable to termination on notice for the\nperiod prescribed therein contravenes \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution as arbitrary and uncontrolled power is left in\nthe authority to select at its will any person against whom\naction will be taken. See the observations of this Court in\nMoti Ram Deka's case (supra) at p. 770 and 751 of the re-\nport.\n\n \nIt was submitted that \nArticles 14\n, 19\n and \n21\n of the\nConstitution are inter-related and the law must, therefore,\nnow be taken to be well settled that \nArticle 21\n does not\nexclude \nArticle 19\n and even if there is a law providing a\nprocedure for depriving a person of personal liberty (this\nwill equally apply to life) and there is, consequently, no\ninfringement of fundamental right conferred by \nArticle 21\n,\nsuch law in so far as it abridges or takes away any funda-\nmental right under \nArticle 19\n would have to meet the chal-\nlenge of the Article. See the observations of this Court in\n\nManeka Gandhi\n's case (supra). \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n, it was\nurged, confers a broad and general right which is available\nto all persons to do work of any particular kind and of\ntheir choice.\n \nSee the observations in \nFertilizer Corporation\nKamgar Union\n's case (supra) at p. 60-61 of the report.\n According to Mr. Ramamurthi, there is a distinction\nbetween Public Employment or service and \"pure master and\nservant cases\".\n \nHe referred to the observations of this\nCourt in \nIndia Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. The Commercial Tax Offi-\n\ncer, Bhavanipore & Ors., [1975] 2 SCR 619 at 657; followed\nin \nA.L. Kalra v. The Project and Equipment Corporation of\nIndia Ltd.\n, [1984] 3 SCR 646 at 664; Whenever, therefore,\naccording to Shri Ramamurthi, there is arbitrariness in\nState Action whether it be of the Legislature or of the\nExecutive or of an authority under \nArticle 12\n, \narticle 14\n\nimmediately springs into action and strikes down such State\naction. In fact, the concept of reasonableness and\nnon/arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme\nand is a golden thread which runs through the whole of the\nfabric of the Constitution.\n \nSee the observations of this\nCourt in \nBandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India & Ors.\n,\n[1984] 2 SCR 79 at 101. A violation of a principle of natu-\nral justice by State action is a violation of \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution, which can be excluded only in exceptional\ncircumstances.\n See the observations of this Court in Tulsi\nRam Patel's case (supra) at 229, and at 233 of the report.\nIt was, therefore, submitted that a clause authorising the\n?201\nemployer to terminate the services of an employee whose\ncontract of service is for an indefinite period or till the\nage of retirement, by serving notice violates the fundamen-\ntal rights guaranteed under \nArticles 14\n, 19(1) (g)\n and \n21\n of\nthe Constitution for \nArticle 21\n is violated when right to\nlivelihood is taken away by termination of service of a\nperson; employed for an indefinite period or till the age of\nretirement except for proved misconduct. Assuming, it was\nargued, that in such a case right to livelihood can be taken\naway by termination of service by giving notice, nonetheless\nit could be validly done only, according to Shri Ramamurthi,\nif:\n\n (i) There is a fair and just procedure by way of--(1)\nrecording of reasons and (2) notice to show cause;\n\n (ii) And the right to terminate is restricted to\nexceptional grounds.\n\n When the service of a person employed for an indefinite\nperiod or till the age of retirement is terminated, Shri\nRamamurthi assets, then \nArticle 14\n is violated when there is\nno guidance for the exercise of power and reasons are not\nrequired to be recorded and principles of natural justice\nare abrogated. Similarly \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n is violated,\naccording to him, for the reasons that there is no guidance,\nno requirement of reasons to be recorded and there is viola-\ntion of the principles of natural justice.\n\n Shri Ramamurthi reminded us that before India became\nindependent in 1947, the \nIndian Contract Act\n 1872 was ap-\nplicable only to British India on its own force. \nBy Merged\nState Laws Act, 1949\n it was extended to the new provinces\nand merged States to the States of Manipur, Tripura by\nVindhya Pradesh by Union territories \nLaw Act\n 1950. It was\nalso extended to the States merged in the States of Bombay\nand Punjab by \nBombay Act\n 4 of 1950 and Punjab Act 5 of 1950.\nWith the promulgation of the Constitution, the Indian Con-\ntract Act 1872 extends to the whole of India except the\nState of Jammu & Kashmir. Shri Ramamurthi asserted the what-\never might have been the position in regard to the provinces\ncomprised in British India before independence, as far as\nother areas, forming part of the Union of India under the\nConstitution are concerned, only the \nIndian Contract Act\n\n1872 is applicable. By \narticle 372\n of the Constitution, this\nAct has been continued in operation even after the Constitu-\ntion came into force, subject to the other provisions of the\nConstitution.\n\n202\n\n A contract of service, according to Shri Ramamurthi is a\nspecies of contract and will, therefore, be governed by the\nprovisions of the \nIndian Contract Act\n 1872. \nThis Act\n has\nbeen held to be an Amending as well as a Consolidating Act.\nTherefore, there can be no question of common law of Eng-\nland, as made applicable in India during the British Rule,\nbeing the basis for deciding any question relating to con-\ntract of employment after 1950. In any event any provisions\nof either the \nIndian Contract Act, 1872\n, or of the English\nCommon Law Applicable in British India before the Constitu-\ntion came into force would be void by reason of \nArticle 13\n\nof the Constitution if it infringed any of the fundamental\nrights contained in Part III of the Constitution, pleaded\nMr. Ramamurthi before us. Under \nSection 2(h)\n of the Indian\nContract Act, 1872 an agreement (including an agreement of\nservice) becomes a contract only when it is enforceable by\nlaw. If it is not enforceable in law, it would be void by\nreason of \nsection 2(g)\n of the Contract Act. The question for\nconsideration would, therefore, be whether a clause in an\nagreement of service when it is for an indefinite period or\ntill the age of retirement providing for termination by\ngiving notice would be enforceable? It was submitted by the\nworkers' union that it would not be enforceable if it vio-\nlates the fundamental rights guaranteed by \nArticles 14\n,\n19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution. See the observations of\nthis Court in Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) at 709 of the\nReport. It was submitted that the broader submission was\nthat under our Constitution there can be no contract of\nemployment providing for termination of service by an em-\nployer of an employee by giving notice, when the employment\nis for indefinite period or till the age of retirement. In\nany event, such a clause cannot find a place either in the\ncontract of service or in the statutory provisions governing\nthe conditions of service in the case of public employment\nunder the 'state' as defined in \nArticle 12\n of the Constitu-\ntion.\n\n \nShri Ramamurthi urged that the observations contained in\nthe judgment of this Court in \nTulsiram Patel\n's case (supra)\nat 166 of the report, regarding the ordinary law of master\nand servant cannot be construed as laying down the proposi-\ntion that under the Indian law, even if a contract of serv-\nice is for an indefinite period or till the age of retire-\nment, it can still be terminated by giving reasonable period\nof notice.\n \nIn any event, even in the Common Law of England,\na distinction is made between public employment and \"pure\nmaster and servant cases\" [See the observations of this\nCourt in \nSukhdev Singh\n's case (supra) at page 657 of the\nreport.\n\nMr. Ramamurthi submitted that the doctrine of pleasure\n\n203\n\nadvanced by the learned Solicitor General of India was\nconfined to employment under the Union of India and States\ndealt with under Part XIV, Chapter I of the Constitution and\ncannot and do not extend to employment under local or other\nauthorities referred to under \nArticle 12\n of the Constitu-\ntion. There cannot be any pleasure by such authority in\nrespect of employment of the permanent employee. It was\nsubmitted by Shri Ramamurthi further that even in cases of\nemployment under the Union and the States, the pleasure\ndoctrine is limited by the express provisions of \nArticle 311\n\nof the Constitution. For that reason, according to him, it\nhas lost some of its majesty and power. He referred us to\nthe observations of this Court in Moti Ram Deka's case\n(supra) at p. 704 and Tulsi Ram Patels's case (supra) at\npage 196.\n\n \nIn dealing with the question of validity of rules autho-\nrising the Government to terminate the services of temporary\nservants as upheld by this court in Champaklal Chimanlal\nShah's case (\nsupra) and Ram Gopal Chaturvedi\n's case (supra)\nit was submitted that it is important to note that the\nvalidity of the rules was challenged on the ground of denial\nof equality of opportunity in employment under the State\nguaranteed by \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. In that con-\ntext this Court observed at p. 20 1 (supra) of the report\nthat there can also be no doubt, if such a class of tempo-\nrary servants could be recruited, there could be nothing\ndiscriminatory or violative of equal opportunity if the\nconditions of service of such servants are different from\nthose of permanent employees. It is thus apparent that this\nCourt, it was submitted, had no occasion to consider the\nreasonableness of a provision for termination of service on\ngiving notice under \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution and,\ntherefore, this decision can be of no assistance to the\nappellants. Shri Ramamurthi submitted that since, audi\nalteram partem is a requirement of \nArticle 14\n, in view of\nrecent decisions of this Court, and conferment of arbitrary\npower itself is contrary to \nArticle 14\n, the rule in question\ncan, according to Shri Ramamurthi, no larger be sustained as\nvalid.\n\n As far as the decision in Ram Gopal Chaturvedi's case\n(supra) was concerned, Shri Ramamurthi submitted that the\nreasons given for rejecting the argument that the rule\nconfers an arbitrary and unguided power are not valid for in\nMoti Ram Deka' case (supra), where the view of two learned\njudges of this Court who had held similar power to be arbi-\ntrary had not ever been noticed. The observation that it is\nimpossible to define before hand all the circumstances in\nwhich the discretion can be exercised and the discretion had\nnecessarily to be left to the Government, has not taken into\nconsideration the circumstance\n\n204\n\nthat the denial of audi alteram parlem which is a require-\nment of \nArticle 14\n, can be only in exceptional circumstances\nand, therefore, such circumstances have necessarily to be\nspelt out. This Court had no occasion, according to Shri\nRamamurthi, to consider the cumulative impact of the funda-\nmental rights guaranteed by \nArticle 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of\nthe Constitution.\n\n Shri Ramamurthi sought to urge before us that industrial\nlaw recognises the right of the employer to exercise, bona\nfide, the power to terminate the services of workman by\ngiving notice, except in case of misconduct, which is unlike\nthe law of master and servant. Shri Ramamurthi urged that it\nis important to note that in all cases under industrial law,\ndecisions have been rendered by industrial tribunal when\ndisputes had been raised by workmen challenging the action\nof the employer terminating their services by giving notice,\nunder the terms of the contract of service or the Certified\nStanding Orders. The question was never raised, nor could it\nbe raised, before the Tribunals that the very term in the\ncontract of service or in Standing Orders would have to\nstand the test of \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Con-\nstitution. Further a constitution bench of this Court had\nrejected the contention that Industrial Tribunals should\nmake a distinction between public sector and private sector\nindustries. Reliance was placed on the observations of this\nCourt in Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v. The Workmen & Ors.,\n[1987] 1 SCR 652 at 669. On the consideration of the rele-\nvant material placed before us, we are asked to come to the\nconclusion that the same principles evolved by industrial\nadjudication in regard to private sector undertakings will\ngovern those in the public sector undertakings having a\ndistinct corporate existence. Therefore, all the decisions\nreferred to by the appellant, it was argued, and interven-\ners, were all concerned with applying the industrial law\neven though some Of them dealt with employees, working in\nstatutory corporations or public sector undertakings. It\nwas, therefore, submitted by Shri Ramamurthi that these\ndecisions could afford no assistance to the Court, in decid-\ning the issues raised in the present case, where the validi-\nty of a term of employment, permitting the employer to\nterminate the services of a permanent employee by simply\ngiving notice, is challenged on the ground that such a term\nviolates fundamental rights guaranteed by \nArticles 14\n,\n19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution. It was submitted fur-\nther that the constitutional guarantees under \nArticles 14\n\nand \n21\n of the Constitution are for all persons and there can\nbe no basis for making a distinction between 'workmen' to\nwhom the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n and other industrial laws\napply and those who are outside their purview. The laws\napplicable to the former\n\n205\n\ncan only add to and not detract from the rights guaranteed\nby Part III of the Constitution.\n\n \nIt was important to note that all the decisions so far\nrendered by this Court striking down rules and regulations\nor a provision in the contract of service, authorising\ntermination of service of permanent employees by giving\nnotice relate to cases of non-workman and we were referred\nto the decisions in West Bengal State Electricity Board's\ncase (\nsupra), Central Inland Water Transport Corporation\nLtd.\n 's case (\nsupra) and O.P. Bhandari\n's case (supra). There\nis the theory that possibility of abuse of power is no\nground for striking down the law.\n \nAttention may be drawn to\nthe observations of this Court in \nThe Collector of Customs,\nMadras v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty\n, [1962] 3 SCR 786 at 825\nand Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh v. Radhakri-\nshan & \nOrs.\n (supra). However, these decisions, it was sub-\nmitted on behalf of the respondents, would have no relevance\nfor the present case because the power to terminate the\nservices of a person employed to serve indefinitely or till\nthe age of retirement can be exercised only in cases of\nproved misconduct or exceptional circumstances having regard\nto the Constitutional guarantee available under \nArticles 14\n,\n19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution. Unless the exceptional\ncircumstances are spelt out the power to terminate the\nservices would cover both permissible and impermissible\ngrounds rendering it wholly invalid, it was urged. This was\nparticularly so because the requirement of audi alteram\npartem which is a part of the guarantee of \nArticle 14\n is\nsought to be excluded. There can be no guidance available in\nthe body of the law itself because the purpose for which an\nundertaking is established and the provisions dealing with\nthe same in the law can provide no guidance regarding excep-\ntional circumstances under which alone the power can be\nexercised. The question involved, Shri Ramamurthi empha-\nsised, in these cases is not the exercise of power which an\nemployer possesses to terminate the services of his employee\nbut the extent of that power.\n\n Shri Ramamurthi drew our attention to the award and\nreferred to paragraph 5.6 of the Shastri Award and other\nprovisions of the award defining misconduct and also para-\ngraph 522 of the Award dealing with the procedure for termi-\nnation of employment and 523 onwards. Mr. Ramamurthi further\nsubmitted that provisions of \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi\nRoad Transport Authority (Conditions of Appointment and\nService) Regulations, 1952 cannot be rendered constitutional\nby reading the requirement of recording reasons and confin-\ning it to cases where it is not reasonably practicable to\nhold an enquiry\n\n206\n\nand reading it down further as being applicable to only\nexceptional cases would not be permissible construction and\nproper.\n\n Shri Ramamurthi drew our attention to the true scope of\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n of the aforesaid Regulations in the light of\nthe judgment of this Court in Balbir Saran Goel's case\n(supra). This rule, it has to be borne in mind, according to\nhim, has been interpreted as applicable to all cases of\ntermination including termination for misconduct as defined\nin the Standing Orders. In the aforesaid decision, at p. 761\nof the report. this Court observed that:\n\n\"\nRegulation 9(b)\n clearly provides for termination of serv-\nices in two modes: the first is where the services may be\nterminated without any notice or pay in lieu of notice. This\ncan be done among other reasons for misconduct. The second\nmode is of terminating the services owning to reduction of\nestablishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned\nin clause (a) which relate to termination without notice.\nWhen termination is made under clause (b) one month's notice\nor pay in lieu thereof is to be given to the employee. Thus\nit is clear that if the employer chooses to terminate the\nservices in accordance with clause (b) after giving one\nmonth's notice or pay in lieu thereof it cannot amount to\ntermination of service for misconduct within the meaning of\nclause (a). It is only when some punishment is inflicted of\nthe nature specified in \nRegulation 15\n for misconduct that\nthe procedure laid down therein for an enquiry etc. becomes\napplicable.\"\n\n If this was the true scope of the Regulation, Shri\nRamamurthi contended, then it was obvious that it leaves the\nchoice entirely to the DTC Management either to proceed\nagainst the person for misconduct by holding an enquiry or\nfor the same misconduct terminate his services by giving one\nmonth's notice. It is the conferment of such a power that\nhas been held to be unguided and arbitrary in all decisions\nfrom Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) to the more recent deci-\nsions of this Court such as West Bengal Electricity Board's\ncase (supra), etc. Therefore, it was submitted that the\nargument based on the assumption that \nRegulation 9(b)\n was\nconfined to cases under than misconduct really overlooked\nthe interpretation placed upon this Regulation by this\nCourt.\n\nShri Ramamurthi further submitted that if regulation 9(b)\ncon-\n\n207\n\nfers this arbitrary power of leaving it to the DTC manage-\nment to pick and choose then it is plain that there is\nnothing in the provisions of the Act or the regulations from\nwhich the DTC management can find any guidance. It was,\ntherefore, the submission of the respondents that in order\nto conform to the Constitutional guarantees contained in\n\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution as inter-\npreted by this Court, the first and foremost the regulation\nwill have to make a distinction between cases where services\nare sought to be terminated for misconduct and cases of\ntermination on grounds other than what would constitute\nmisconduct. As far as termination or dismissal on ground of\nmisconduct is concerned, ordinarily the detailed procedure\nfor establishing misconduct had to be followed. In cases\nwhere it is not possible to follow the detailed procedure,\nthen at least the minimum procedure of issuing a show cause\nnotice should be followed after recording reasons why it is\nnot practicable to hold a full-fledged enquiry. In cases\nwhere even this requirement of the elementary principles of\nnatural justice is not to be followed, then the regulation\nmust itself indicate those cases in which principles of\nnatural justice can be totally abrogated after recording\nreasons.\n\n As far as termination of service of a permanent employee\non grounds which do not constitute misconduct is concerned,\nassuming that this is held to be permissible, it can be only\nin very exceptional cases and that too after observing at\nleast the elementary principle of natural justice of asking\nfor explanation before terminating the services and also\nrecording reasons. Shri Ramamurthi urged that to read all\nthis into the regulations would literally mean re-writing\nthe regulations which is not permissible under any of the\ndecisions or the law.\n\n As one of the cases cover termination under The Punjab\nCivil Services Rules, 1952, Shri Ramamurthi drew our atten-\ntion to some of the provisions of these rules. He drew our\nattention to rule 3.12 which provides that unless in any\ncase it be otherwise provided in those rules, a Government\nemployee on substantive appointment to any permanent post\nacquired a lien on that post and ceased to hold any lien\npreviously acquired on any other post. He also drew our\nattention to rule 3.15(a) which provided that except as\nprovided in clause (b) and (c) of that rule and in note\nunder rule 3.13, a Government employee's lien on a post may,\nin no circumstances, be terminated, even with his consent,\nif the result would be to leave him without a lien or a\nsuspended lien upon a permanent post. Clause (b) of rule\n3.15 provided that notwithstanding the provisions of rule\n3.14(a), the lien of a Govern-\n\n208\n\nment employee holding substantively a permanent post shall\nbe terminated while on refused leave granted after the date\nof compulsory retirement under rule 6.21; or on his appoint-\nment substantively to the post of Chief Engineer of the\nPublic Works Department. And clause (c) of this rule provid-\ned that a Government employee's lien on a permanent post,\nshall stand terminated on his acquiring a lien on a perma-\nnent post (whether under the Central Government or a State\nGovernment) outside the cadre on which he is borne. Note\nunder rule 3.13 speaks about a Government employee holding\nsubstantially the post of a Chief Engineer of the Public\nWorks Department, taking leave immediately on vacating his\npost he then shall during the leave be left without a lien\non any permanent post. The expression 'vacate' used in the\nnote refers only to vacation as a result of completion of\ntenure of attainment of superannuation.\n\n Mr. R.K. Garg, appearing for the respondents in C.A. No.\n4073 of 1986 stated that the Attorney General had rightly\npointed out that employee's services were terminated under\nPara 522 of the Shastri Award merely because he had failed\nto mention a loan of Rs. 1.5 lakhs taken from another Branch\nof the Bank. Mr. Garg pointed out that the loan had been\nrepaid. The failure to mention this loan had deprived the\nappellant of his livelihood. The use of this power claimed\nunder Para 522 of the Shastri Award was not defended by the\nAttorney General in this case. We had fairly conceded that\nhe might not support this termination when the case is heard\non merits. But, that does not derogate from the wide ampli-\ntude of this uncontrolled, arbitrary power claimed by the\nmanagement under Para 522 of the Shastri Award. Powers\nclaimed under Para 522 must, therefore, be examined in the\nbackground of the facts and circumstances of this Appeal. It\nwas submitted that this Court must hold that nothing in Para\n522 of the Shastri Award confers on the management power so\nfar as they can get rid of permanent employees of the Banks\nmerely after service of notice on the imaginary belief that\nthey were doing so for \"efficient Management\" of the Banks.\nMr. Garg reminded us that it is common knowledge that all\ndespots act as tyrants in the firm belief that the intolera-\nble indignities and atrocities they inflict, were necessary\nin public interest and to save the Society. Mr. Garg submit-\nted that the rule of law cannot be preserved if absolute,\nuncontrolled powers are tolerated and fundamental rights or\nDirective Principles are allowed to be reduced to a \"dead\nletter\".\n\n Mr. Garg urged that the fundamental requirements of\nnatural justice are not dispensible luxury. The express\nlanguage of Para 522 of\n\n209\n\nthe Shastri Award is totally destructive of this require-\nment.\n\n The express language as mentioned hereinbefore of Para\n522 of the Shastri Award provides:\n\n\"(1) In cases not involving disciplinary action for miscon-\n\nduct and subject to clause (6) below. The employment of a\npermanent employee may be terminated by three months' notice\nor on payment of three months' pay and allowances in lieu of\nnotice. The services of a probationer may be terminated by\none month's notice or on payment of a month's pay and allow-\nances in lieu of notice.\"\n\nRule 148(3) reads:\n\n\"(3) Other (non-pensionable) railway servants shall be\nliable to termination on notice on either side for the\nperiods shown below. Such notice is not, however, required\nin cases of dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure\nafter compliance with the provisions of Clause (2) of Arti-\n\ncle 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the age\nof superannuation, and termination of service due to mental\nor physical incapacity.\"\n\n\"Note: The appointing authorities are empowered to reduce or\nwaive, at their discretion, the stipulated period of notice\nto be given by an employee, but the reason justifying their\naction should be recorded.\"\n\nRule 348(4) reads:\n\n\"In lieu of the notice prescribed in this rule, it shall be\npermissible on the part of the Railway Administration to\nterminate the service of a railway servant by paying him the\npay for the period of notice.\"\n\nRule 149(3) reads:\n\n\"Other railway servants: The services of other railway\nservants shall be liable to termination on notice on either\nside for the periods shown below. Such notice is not howev-\ner, required in cases of dismissal or removal as a discipli-\nnary measure after compliance with the provisions\n\n210\n\nof clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution, retirement\non attaining the age of superannuation, and termination of\nservice due to mental or physical incapacity.\"\n\n It was urged by Mr. Garg that the services of a perma-\nnent bank employee cannot be terminated without charge of\n'misconduct' and without an enquiry and the aforesaid para-\ngraph gives no indication as to on what conditions this\narbitrary uncontrolled power can be used to get rid of one\nor more permanent employees for \"efficient management of\nBanks\" on subjective opinions or suspicion not tested in\nenquiry into facts. It was further urged that this provision\nprovides for \"insecurity of tenure\" for lakhs of permanent\nemployees, \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution\nand the integrated protection of these Fundamental Rights\nexcludes the \"doctrine of pleasure\" and insists on security\nof tenure \"during good behaviour\". The right to livelihood\ncannot be rendered precarious or reduced to a glorious\nuncertainty\", it was urged by Mr. Garg. Mr. Garg submitted\nthat the right to \"hire and fire\" was the prerogative\nclaimed by the employer in the days of uncontrolled \"laissez\nfaire.\" This was the \"doctrine of pleasure of the Crown\" in\ncase of Government servants, who held office during the\npleasure of the King who had absolute powers over his sub-\njects. \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n secure the rights of the\ncitizen and act as limits on the powers of the \"State\" in\nDemocratic Republic of India. Unjust, arbitrary, uncon-\ntrolled power of \"premature\" termination of services of\npermanent employees should not be tolerated according to Mr.\nGarg by the Constitution of free India.\n\n In case of Government servants, \nArticles 311(1)\n and\n\n311(2)\n of the Constitution expressly restrict the \"doctrine\nof pleasure\" contained in \nArticle 310.\n \nArticle 14\n also\ninsists on natural justice as was provided in \nArticle\n311(2)\n, in order to prevent arbitrary use of power of termi-\nnation. \nArticles 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n read together require just,\nfair and reasonable procedure for termination of services\nfor good cause. Without these safeguards, employees are\nreduced to the status of slaves of their masters. Employers\nare no longer masters as in the days of slavery of feudal\nrelations, Mr. Garg tried to emphasise. He submitted that\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution did not permit permanent\nrailway employees to be exposed to termination of their\nservices on notice without charge of misconduct or a reason-\nable opportunity to answer the charge. Rules 148 and 149 of\nthe Railway Establishment Code which have been set only\nhereinbefore have the same effect, as is the effect of para\n522 of the Shastry Award, and both these Rules were declared\nunconstitutional in Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) by a seven\n\n211\n\nJudges' Bench, according to Mr.-Garg.\n\n Rules 148 and 149 were found violative of \nArticle 14\n for\ntwo reasons, it was submitted:\n\n (i) Railway servants in the matter of termination of\nservice could not form a separate Class from other Govern-\n\nment servants (As per majority view, in the Judgment of\nJustice Gajendragadkar, in Moti Ram Deka '5 case [1964] 5\nSCR 683,729-731).\n\n (ii) Rule 148 conferred unguided, uncontrolled power\nof termination and, therefore, was hit by \nArticle 14.\n (As\nper Justice Subba Rao and Justice Das Gupta, in Moti Ram\nDeka's case (supra).\n\n \nMr. Garg sought to urge that this binding decision of\nseven Judges' Bench in Moti Ram Deka's (supra) was applied\nin \nGurdev Singh Sidhu v. State of Punjab & Anr.\n, [1964] 7\nSCR 587 at 592-593 by the Constitution Bench of five Judges\nto strike down a Service Rule which permitted compulsory\nretirement on completion of 10 years' services on the ground\nof 'inefficiency' etc. This Court held that Compulsory\nretirement could not be tolerated even after 10 years of\nservice in view Of such retirement being not based on rele-\nvant considerations, including expected longivity of life\nof the employees in India.\n If the power of removal by way of\ncompulsory retirement even after ten years was held uncon-\nstitutional in Gurdev Singh's case (supra) para 522 of the\nShastri Award was far more arbitrary, unjust and unreasona-\nble, it was urged before us.\n\n \nIt was reiterated before us that in view of the binding\ndecision of seven Judges in Moti Ram Deka's Case and its\napplication by five Judges in Case of compulsory retirement\nafter 10 years in \nGurdev Singh\n's Case (supra), it is not\nopen to the employees to submit that similar powers claimed\nunder paragraph 522 of the Shastri Award, even without 10\nyears' service for removal without charge of 'misconduct'\nand without enquiry, can be upheld as constitutional on any\ngrounds whatsoever. It cannot be upheld as constitutional on\nany grounds whatsoever.\n It cannot be done without over-\nruling Moti Ram Deka's case or without an express constitu-\ntional provision like second Proviso (a), (b) or (C) to\nArticle 311(2), which was adopted.by the Constituent Assem-\nbly, not by a court of law, it was reiterated before us.\n\n212\n\n \nIt was submitted that no principle of interpretation\npermits reading down a provision so as to make it into a\ndifferent provision altogether different from what was\nintended by the legislature or its delegate. (\nR. M.D.C.\n 's\ncase (supra).\n\n It was urged that it was established law that on reading\ndown a provision, Court cannot preserve a power for a pur-\npose which is just the opposite of what the legislature had\nintended. Para 522 of the Shastri Award was not at all\nintended to be used within limits expressed or implied. The\nCourt must not legislate conditions such as were adopted by\nthe Constituent Assembly in case of second Proviso to Arti-\ncle 311(2) in the Constitution of India. Even Parliament\ncould not graft such limitations on \nArticle 311(2)\n, if\nsecond Proviso to \nArticle 311\n was not there in the Constitu-\ntion. This Court cannot and ought. it was submitted not to\narrogate powers to legislate what was patently outside even\nthe competence of Parliament of India.\n\n It was submitted that in Tulsi Ram Patel's Case, the\nmajority decision could not hold second Proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n unconstitutional. In order to give effect to the\nexpress language of second Proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n, Court\ndenied the protection of \nArticle 14\n to permit the President\nto terminate the services without following principles of\nnatural justice' in cases covered by the said Proviso. In\nevery other case, natural justice is the command of \nArticle\n311(2)\n of the Constitution was submitted.\n\n The operation of \nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n311(2)\n of the\nConstitution does not permit Courts to lay down essential\nlegislative policy, such as was laid down by the Constituent\nAssembly to over-ride 311(2) of the Constitution.\n Mr. Garg, therefore, submitted that the requirement of\ndefining 'misconduct' in the Standing Orders and providing\nby meticulous provisions for a just, fair and reasonable\nenquiry into charges of 'misconduct' are the mandatory\nrequirement of \nIndustrial Employment Standing Orders Act\n.\n\n(\nU. P State Electricity Board v. Hari Shankar Jain\n, [1979] 1\nSCR 355/362-3).\n\n \nShri Garg urged that the I.L.O. Conventions, accepted by\nIndia. required all employers to frame Standing Orders. He\nfurther urged that the demands of natural justice, which\nform part of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution have been raised\nto the status of 'public policy' controlling \nsection 23\n of\nthe Indian Contract Act. On that basis, clauses in\n\n213\n\ncontract of employment which provide for removal from serv-\nice on the will of the employer have been condemned as 'The\nHenry VIII Clause' (see the observations of this Court in\n\nCentral Inland Water Transports\n case (supra) against the\nethos of the Constitution of Socialist Democratic Republic\nof India.\n \nIn this connection, reference was made to the\ndecision of this Court in Central Inland Water Transport's\ncase (\nsupra) and Maneka Gandhi\n's case (supra). In India,\nShri Garg submitted. workers have a right to participate in\nthe management. The participation in the management cannot\nexclude the 'power to be heard' and thus participate in a\ndecision to remove a permanent employee. Government alone\nhas power to refer to the industrial tribunal, Shri Garg\nsubmitted. He was against any reading down which is contrary\nto the principles of interpretation.\n He referred to the\nobservations of the Privy Council in Nazir Ahmed's case [AIR\n1936 PC 253]. He submitted that if two provisions exist,\nfirstly, to remove from service after holding an enquiry on\na charge of a 'misconduct'; and secondly without serving a\ncharge-sheet or holding an enquiry all provisions for hold-\ning enquiry will be rendered otiose and will be reduced to a\nmere redundancy. Such an interpretation will expose workers\nto harsher treatment than those guilty of misconduct, who\nwill enjoy greater protection than those who have committed\nno misconduct. Such powers are patently discriminatory.\n Reference under \nsection 10\n of the Industrial Disputes\nAct would serve no purpose, submitted Mr. Garg. Court has a\nduty, according to him. to correct wrongs even if orders\nhave been made which are later found to be violative of any\nfundamental right and to recall its orders to avoid injus-\ntice. \nHe referred to the decision of this Court in \nA.R.\nAntulay v. R.S. Nayak and Anr.\n, [1988] 2 SCC 602. He remind-\ned us that no draft had been submitted by the Attorney\nGeneral or the Solicitor General, which could be added as a\nproviso to para 522 of the Shastri Award by this Court as a\npiece of judicial legislation to amend the impugned para\n\n522. Substantive provision of para 522 could not be con-\ntrolled or curtailed effectively so that its operation could\nbe confined within narrow constitutional limits. Mr. Garg\nreminded us that it is not the duty of the court to condone\nthe constitutional delinquencies of those limited by the\nConstitution if they arrogate uncontrolled unconstitutional\npowers, which are neither necessary nor germane for supposed\nefficiency of services in the Banks as a business enter-\nprise. Mr. Garg submitted that in a system governed by rule\nof law, discretion when conferred upon executive authorities\nmust be confined within clearly defined limits. The rule of\nlaw from this point means that decisions should be made by\nthe application of known\n\n214\n\nprinciples and rules and. in general, such decisions should\nbe predictable and the citizen should know where he is. Law\ncan only reach its finest moments when it has freed man from\nthe unlimited discretion of ruler. He referred to the obser-\nvations of this Court in \nS.C. Jaisinhhani v. Union of India\nand Ors.\n, [1967] 2 SCR 703 at p. 718-19.\n\n On behalf of the Interveners in Civil Appeal No. 2876,\nMr. P.P. Rao submitted that the aforesaid decision in Tulsi\nRam Patel's case (supra) was an authority for the proposi-\ntion that but for clause (b) of the second proviso to Arti-\ncle 311(2) of the Constitution, the principles of natural\njustice could not have been excluded from the scope of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. It was urged by him that the\nsaid second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n being itself a consti-\ntutional provision, such exclusion was upheld by this Court\nin the said Tulsi Ram Patel's case (supra). page 237 and at\nlast para to p. 242. Mr. Rao drew our attention to the\nwell-settled rule of interpretation and submitted that where\ntwo interpretations are possible, one of which would pre-\nserve and gave the constitutionality of the particular\nstatutory provision while the other would render it uncon-\nstitutional and void, the one which saves and preserves its\nconstitutionality should be adopted and the other should be\nrejected. Fie, further, submitted that unless the provision\nof the Constitution itself excludes the principles of natu-\nral justice, they continue to be applicable as an integral\npart of the right to equality guaranteed by the Constitu-\ntion.\n\n It was further reiterated that as the employees of the\nDTC were not Government employees, \nArticle 311(2)\n of the\nConstitution was not applicable. Consequently, the second\nproviso thereof was also not applicable, with the result\nthat \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution fully applied to them\nand it included the principles of natural justice as held in\nTulsi Ram Patel's (supra) itself at p. 233, last paragraph.\nMr. Rao submitted that it is not permissible to read down\nstatutory provisions when the avowed purpose is to confer\npower on an authority without any limitation whatever. That\nwould be reading down contrary to the expressed or manifest\nintention of the legislature. \nHe drew our attention to the\nobservations of this Court in \nMinerva Mills Limited v. Union\nof India & Ors.\n, [1981] 1 SCR 206 at 261. Therein, at p. 259\nof the report, it was reiterated that the principles of\nreading down could not be distorted even when words of width\nare used inadvertently. In the instant case, Mr. Rao submit-\nted, reading down would amount to distortion of the right to\nequality conferred by \nArticle 14\n, which was regarded as a\nbasic feature of the Constitution.\n \nNothing short of an\namendment of the Constitution could cut down the scope of\nthe basic\n\n215\n\nprinciple of equality, submitted Mr. Rao then referred to us\n\nKesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\n, [1973] Supp. 1\nS.C.R. 1 and submitted that any constitutional amendment\nwhich impairs the doctrine of equality would be liable to be\ndeclared unconstitutional on the ground of violation of the\nbasic structure of the Constitution.\n\n In the instant case, Mr. Rao submitted, regulation 9(b)\ndeliberately conferred wide power of termination of service\nwithout giving a reasonable opportunity to an employee even\nif he is a regular or permanent employee, in addition to\nregulation 15 which provided for dismissal or removal after\na disciplinary enquiry. Therefore, the intention of the\nregulation-making authority was clear and unambiguous. The\nprovision is not capable of two interpretations. Consequent-\nly, the question of reading down did not arise. Mr. Rao drew\nour attention to the observations of the Supreme Court of\nAmerica in Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v. United States, 26\nLawyers' Edition 2nd, 308 at 327. Mr. Rao submitted that the\ndecisions referred to by the learned Attorney General were\nnot applicable to the instant case. \nHe submitted that the\ndecision of the Federal Court in \nRe The Hindu Women's Rights\nto Property Act\n's case (supra) involved the interpretation\nof a single word in the context of legislative competence.\nThat was not the context of the present controversy, submit-\nted Mr. Rao. Mr. Rao submitted that R.M.D. Chamarbaughwal-\nla's case (supra) was a case on severability. That was a\ncase where the word 'competition' was interpreted. In the\npresent case, the suggested reading down involves, according\nto Mr. Rao, not interpretation of any single word in regula-\ntion 9(b) but adding a whole clause to it which amounted to\nrewriting the provisions. Courts have refused to rewrite\nlegislation to make up for the omissions of the legislature.\n\nReliance was placed by Mr. Rao on \nNalinakhya Bysack v. Shyam\nSunder Halder & Ors.\n, [1953] SCR 533, at p. 544-545.\n \nMr Rao\nreferred to the observations of this Court in \nKedar Nath\nSingh v. State of Bihar\n, (supra) involving the interpreta-\ntion of \nsection 124A\n IPC in the context of \nArticle 19(1)(a)\n\nof the Constitution. The content of \nArticle 19(1)(a)\n was not\ncut down. In the present case, the suggested reading down\nwould inevitably drain out \nArticle 14\n of its vitality.\n\nShri Rao drew our attention to the decision of this\nCourt in \nR.L. Arora v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n, (supra) and\nsubmitted that \nthe said decision\n did not involve cutting\ndown the scope of a fundamental right.\n \nHe also drew our\nattention to the decision of this Court in \nJagdish Pandey v.\nThe Chancellor, University of Bihar\n (supra) which did not\ninvolve reading down so as to sacrifice the principle of\nnatural justice\n\n216\n\nwhich are considered an essential part of the rule of law.\n\nIn \nMunicipal Committee, Amritsar & Anr. v. State of Punjab &\nOrs.\n, [1969] 3 SCR 447, this Court was concerned with the\nintention of the legislature and interpreted the Act con-\nsistent with the said intention. In the instant case. the\nintention was to confer power of termination of services of\nall categories of employees without any further enquiry.\n\nSunil Batra v. Delhi Administration\n (supra) was again a\ndecision where this Court found that the intention of the\nlegislature was not to confer arbitrary power. In the in-\nstant case, the intention was different.\n \nN.C. Dalwadi v.\nState of Gujarat\n. (supra) was a case of giving reasonable\ninterpretation to a provision which was capable of such an\ninterpretation. In the scheme of DTC Regulations. regulation\n9(b) was not susceptable to two interpretations. submitted\nMr. Rao. According to Mr. Rao, the principle of reading down\nwas not applicable where the intention of the law maker was\nto confer too wide a power intended to be exercised without\ngiving an opportunity to the affected party to be heard. It\nwas, therefore, submitted that the principle of reading down\nwas not applicable and if applied would amount to cutting\ndown the scope of \nArticle 14\n and subjecting permanent em-\nployees of the DTC to a tremendous sense of insecurity which\nis against the philosophy and scheme of the Constitution.\n\n Mr Nayar, appearing in Civil Appeal No. 1115 of\n1976--(Shri Samara Singh v. Zila Parishad Ferozepure) for\nthe respondent, drew our attention to the fact that the\nappellant, Shri Satnam Singh was appointed by the respondent\nvide letter of appointment dated 9th March. 1961 the appel-\nlant ceased to work for the respondent, when his services\nwere terminated simpliciter vide Resolution dated 26th\nNovember, 1965. He, therefore, had worked for the respondent\nonly for a short period of less than four years. The serv-\nices of the appellant ceased on the basis of the contract.\nthe terms of which were mutually agreed between the parties.\nIn case he had continued to work, he would have reached the\nage of superannuation in the year 1984. His total emoluments\nwith effect from 1st November, 1964 to 30th September,\n1984 would have been approximately Rs.2,46,464. Mr. Nayar\nfiled a detailed statement and stated that the appellant\nceased to work for the respondent with effect from 26th\nNovember, 1964 when he was discharged from service.\n In this case, it is necessary to bear in mind that the\nappellant, Shri Satnam Singh was appointed by the respond-\nent, Zila Parishad, Ferozepure by letter of appointments\ndated 9th March. 1961. The Board approved his terms of\nappointment and the same were duly\n\n217\n\naccepted by the appellant. The 'relevant clause of Contract\nbetween the parties for present purposes was clause 4 which\nwas as follows:\n\n\"His services will be terminated on one month's notice on\neither side provided it will be open to pay him his salary\nfor the period by which the notice falls short of one month.\nSimilarly, if he wishes to resign he may do so by depositing\nwith the District Board his salary for the period by which\nthe notice given by him fails short of one month.\"\n\n The appellant, however, was continued to be governed by\nthe Statutory Rules, known as District Board Rules, 1926.\nAccording to the respondent, the appellant did not cooperate\ninasmuch as he was not available in the Headquarters and\npresumably left without permission and without handing over\nimportant record and documents of the District Board, etc.\nBut the appellant's version, as stated in the grounds of\nappeal, was entirely different. He urged that it was on\naccount of vindictive attitude on the part of some of the\nemployees of the respondent, which had produced his termina-\ntion order without enquiry. The District Board resolved that\nin terms of condition 4 of the terms of appointment, his\nservices should be terminated on one month's notice or pay\nin lieu thereof.\n\n Mr. Nayar submitted that rule 1(i) of District Board\nRules, 1926, Part V also gave right to both the parties to\nterminate the contract of employment on one month's notice,\netc. The said rule reads as follows:\n\n\"In the absence of a written contract to the contrary every\nofficer or servant employed by a District Board shall be\nentitled to one month's notice before discharge or to one\nmonth's wages in lieu thereof, unless he is discharged\nduring the period of probation or for misconduct or was\nengaged for a specified term and discharged at the end of\nit.\"\n\n The services of the appellant were terminated vide\nResolution dated 26th November, 1964 of the Board and he was\ndischarged by allowing him one month's salary in lieu of\nnotice. The termination order was dated 14th December, 1964.\nThe appellant, Shri Satnam Singh filed a suit for declara-\ntion in the Court of Senior Sub-Judge, Ferozepure, challeng-\ning the order of termination dated 14th December, 1964 as\nillegal, void, ultra vires, etc. The Senior Sub-Judge,\nFerozepure, vide judgment and decree dated 9th January, 1969\nheld\n\n218\n\nthat the discharge of the appellant amounted to dismissal\nand as clearly no enquiry was held against him, the termina-\ntion simpliciter was bad in law. The respondent, Zila Pari-\nshad filed an appeal in the Court of 3rd Additional District\nJudge, Ferozepure, who vide order dated 22nd December, 1969\naffirmed the decision of the trial Judge and dismissed the\nappeal of the respondent. The respondent filed regular\nappeal in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandi-\ngarh, inter alia, pleading that the appellant was validly\ndischarged in terms of his appointment order and rule 1(i),\nPart V-A of the District Board Rules, 1926.\n\n The learned Single Judge of the High Court considered\nthe matter in detail and referred to various judgments of\nthis Court and held that it could not be said that the\naction of termination prima facie amounted to an order of\ndismissal even though the appellant was at the time a con-\nfirmed employee of the respondent. The learned Single Judge\nfound that the respondent had a contractual right to termi-\nnate the services of the appellant by giving a month's\nnotice or a month's salary in lieu of notice. According to\nShri Garg, the removal of the appellant from service was in\naccordance with the terms governing his appointment. Merely\nbecause on the 7th of November, 1964, the respondent re-\nsolved to charge sheet the appellant for acts of omission\nand commission and ordered an enquiry, and such an enquiry\nnever commenced, would certainly not be enough reason to\nhold that the termination of the appellant's services, was\nordered by way of punishment and therefore, amounted to his\ndismissal, argued Mr. Nayar. It was submitted by Mr. Nayar\nthat the appellant had conceded that condition no. 4 was\nlegally good but he had argued that it was not meant to be\neffective after the appellant had been confirmed.\n Aggrieved by the order mentioned above, the appellant\nhad filed Letters Patent Appeal before the Division Bench of\nthe High Court. The Division Bench of the High Court by an\norder dated 13th September, 1972 referred the question of\nlaw for the decision of the full bench. The full bench of\nthe High Court refrained the question of law as under:\n\n\"Whether, the termination of services of a permanent Dis-\ntrict Board Employee by giving him one month's notice or pay\nin lieu thereof in terms of the conditions of his appoint-\nment and/or rule 1 in part V-A of the District Board Rules,\n1926, is bad in law and cannot be made?\n\n219\n\n The majority of the learned Judges, inter alia, held\nthat the appellant not being a government servant cannot\nhave the protection of \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution as he\nwas not a civil servant under the Central Government of the\nState Government. He was an employee of the District Board\nand his tenure of appointment was governed by the provisions\nof the District Board's Act, 1883 and the rules flamed\nthereunder as well as by the terms and conditions of his\nappointment. The condition no. 4 gave mutual right to the\nDistrict Board as well as to the appellant to terminate the\nservice by giving one month's notice or pay in lieu of\nnotice, etc. The condition in the appointment letter shall\nnot be deemed to have been abrogated by the Punjab Civil\nServices Rules. The Court held further that the condition\nstated in the letter of appointment of the appellant contin-\nued to bind the parties even after the appellant's confirma-\ntion and his services could be terminated by an order of\ndischarge simpliciter in accordance with the condition no. 4\nthereof as this condition was almost in the same terms as\nRule I in Part V-A of the Rules. It was further held by the\nfull bench of the High Court that the Punjab Civil Service\nRules had no over-riding effect and these rules were to\napply in respect of matters for which no provision had been\nmade anywhere else because of the phrase used \"so far as may\nbe\".\n\nRule 8.1 of the Business Rules reads as under:\n\n\"In all matters relating to the conditions of service of its\nemployees the Board shall so far as may be follow the rules\nfrom time to time in force for servants of the Punjab Gov-\nernment.\"\n\n The finding of the Letters Patent Bench in this regard\nwas as under:\n\n\"According to Rule 8.1 ibid, the Punjab Civil Services Rules\nwere to apply in respect of matters for which no provision\nhad been made anywhere else because of the phrase used \"so\nfar as may be\". Naturally, if a provision was made anywhere\nelse, which went counter to the Punjab Civil Services Rules,\nthe application of the latter rules It thus follows that the\nPunjab Civil Services Rules were not to apply to the appel-\nlant in respect of matters for which specific provision was\nmade in his letter of appointment, which constituted the\ncontract of service between him and the District Board, as\nhe joined\n\n220\n\nservice on those terms.after accepting the same.\"\n\n The learned Chief Justice of Punjab & Haryana High\nCourt, however, dissented. The answer to the question,\ntherefore, was given in the negative vide order dated 3rd\nApril, 1974. The Division Bench of the High Court which\nheard the matter after the question of law was answered by\nthe Full Bench, dismissed the appeal of the appellant vide\norder dated 28th October, 1974 and this appeal to this Court\narises from this order.\n\n The appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1115/76, who appeared\nin person before us reiterated the relevant facts and urged\nthat his removal was bad and the rule under which he was\nremoved may be quashed. It may be mentioned that as regards\nletter of Shri Kuldip Singh Virk to the Senior Superintend-\nent of Police, Ferozepure regarding the charges of corrup-\ntion against the appellant, a case under\n s. 5(2)\n of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act was registered. The appellant\nwas tried for the said alleged offence and acquitted of the\ncharges by the Special Judge Ferozepure. A further case was\nregistered under\n ss. 381\n/ \n409\n of IPC against the appellant.\nAccordingly, the appellant was tried by the Judicial Magis-\ntrate Ferozepure. The charge was framed by the Judicial\nMagistrate against the appellant. Against the aforesaid, the\nappellant filed a petition in the High Court and the charge\nand the proceedings in question were thereupon quashed by\nthe High Court in July/August, 1967. There were three more\ncases tried by the Special Judge, Ferozepure and acquitted.\n The appellant filed a document in this Court claiming\nthe monetary claim on the basis that his termination was\nwrongful. According to the appellant, he was entitled to\nrecover Rs.4,83,061.90 paise. However. according to the\nstatement filed by Shri Nayar, learned counsel for the\nrespondents in this case, the appellant was entitled to\nwithdraw from the District Board Rs.2,46,464.46 paise, in\ncase he would have been in service before his date of super-\nannuation, i.e., 30th September, 1984. There is no evidence\nfrom either side as to whether the appellant had worked\nsomewhere else though the appellant did not work with the\nrespondent because of his suspension. The appellant had,\nhowever, stated that he did not so work. In that view of the\nmatter, if the contentions or' the appellant are accepted\nthat the clause under which the terms of employment of the\nappellant was agreed and under which the termination was\neffected without any enquiry and further in view of the fact\nthat the learned trial Judge before whom the appellant had\nfiled the suit first and decreed the suit declaring the\n\n221\n\nappellant to be entitled to be in service, the appellant, in\nour opinion. should rightly be granted a monetary claim for\nRs.4,83,061.90 paise and further interest at 6% from 30th\nSeptember, 1984. This would be in consonance with justice\nand equity in the facts and the circumstances of this case.\nThis order, however, will have to be passed if we accept the\ncontention on behalf of the appellant herein on the con-\nstruction of the clause.\n\n \nIn the matter of M/s Indian Airlines, which is the\nsubject-matter of the Application for Intervention No. 1 of\n1990:in Civil Appeal No. 2846 of 1986, Mr. Lalit Bhasin, on\nbehalf of the interveners contended that there has been\ndistinction between the discharge simpliciter and dismissal\nfrom service by way of punishment. According to Mr. Bhasin\nthe effect of the judgments of this Court in the \nCentral\nInland Water\n's case (supra) and \nWest Bengal\n's (supra) was to\ntake away the right of the employer to terminate the serv-\nices of an employee by way of discharge simpliciter. Accord-\ning to Mr. Bhasin, this Court had recognised the existence\nof the inherent right of an employer to terminate the serv-\nices of an employee in terms of the contract of employment\nand also under the various labour enactments.\n Attention of this Court was invited to the provisions of\nthe \nIndustrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946\n, which\napplies to all industrial establishments whether in the\npublic or private sector. Under and as a part of the said\nAct, model standing' orders are set out and Standing Order\nNo. 13 provides for simple termination of employment by\ngiving one month's notice etc. Similarly, there are provi-\nsions under various Shops and Establishments Acts of differ-\nent States providing for termination of employment of perma-\nnent employee after giving one month's notice or pay in lieu\nof notice. Attention of this Court was invited to\n s. 30\n of\nDelhi Shops and Establishments Act.\n\n \nThe Industrial Disputes Act\n itself makes distinction\nbetween discharge and dismissal and attention of this Court\nwas invited to\n s. 2(00)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act,\nwhich defines 'retrenchment'. This section expressly ex-\ncludes termination of services as a result of nonrenewal of\ncontract of employment. \nSection 2(s)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act defines 'workman' to include any person who has\nbeen dismissed, discharged or retrenched. Section 2A distin-\nguishes discharge, dismissal and retrenchment.\n It is pertinent to point out that the Original Regula-\ntion 13 of Indian Airlines Employees Service Regulations was\nset out as under:\n\n222\n\n\"13. The services of an employee are terminable at 30 days\non either side or basic pay in lieu:\n\nProvided however, the Corporation will be at liberty to\nrefuse to accept the termination of his service by an em-\nployee where such termination is sought in order to avoid\ndisciplinary action contemplated or taken by the\nManagement.\"\n\n \nAfter the decisions of this Court in Central Inland\nWater's case (supra), Indian Airlines initiated steps to\namend its \nRegulation 13\n and bring it in line with \nArticle\n311(2)\n of the Constitution as directed by this Court in\n\nHindustan Steels Lid\n' case (supra). It appears that the\nBoard of Directors of Indian Airlines had accordingly ap-\nproved of the amendments to \nRegulation 13\n and the amended\nRegulation reads as under:\n\n\"(a) The services of an employee may be terminated without\nassigning any reasons to him/her and without any prior\nnotice but only on the following grounds not amounting to\nmisconduct under the Standing Orders, namely:\n\n(i) If he/she is, in the opinion of the Corporation (the\nBoard of Directors of Indian Airlines) incompetent and\nunsuitable for continued employment with the Corporation and\nsuch incompetence and unsuitability is such as to make\nhis/her continuance in employment detrimental to the inter-\n\nest of the Corporation;\n\n OR\nIf his/her continuance in employment constitutes, in the\nopinion of the Corporation (the Board of Directors of Indian\nAirlines), a grave security risk making his/her continuance\nin a service detrimental to the interests of the Corporat\nion;\n\n OR\nif in the opinion of the Corporation (the Board of Directors\nof Indian Airlines) there is such a justifiable lack of\nconfidence which, having regard to the nature of duties\nperformed, would make it necessary in the interest of the\nCorporation, to immediately terminate his/her services.\n\n223\n\n(b) The employee can seek termination of his/her employment\nby giving 30 days notice or basic pay in lieu:\n\nProvided however the Corporation will be at liberty to\nrefuse to accept the termination of his/her service by an\nemployee where such termination is sought in order to avoid\ndisciplinary action contemplated or taken by the\nManagement.\"\n\n According to Mr. Bhasin, in the amended \nRegulation 13\n,\nIndian Airlines had taken care to set out the circumstances\nin which the services of an employee can be terminated by\nway of discharge and without holding enquiry. Mr Bhasin\nurged that these are eventualities which do not constitute\nmisconduct and yet retention of an employee in the service\nby the management for any one of the grounds mentioned in\nthe aforesaid Regulation might be considered as detrimental\nfor the management or against public interest. Mr. Bhasin\nsubmitted that the power has been vested with the Board of\nDirectors and not with any individual. According to Mr.\nBhasin, plain reading of \nRegulation 13\n, as amended, would\nclearly establish that the vice. if any, or arbitrariness is\ncompletely removed and sufficient guidelines are made avail-\nable to the highest functionary, namely, the Board of Direc-\ntors to exercise the restricted and limited power now avail-\nable to the employer under these Regulations.\n Similar submissions have been made on behalf of Air\nIndia, who are interveners. Submissions made hereinbefore\nwere alternative submissions. The original \nRegulation 48\n of\nAir India Employees Service Regulations was as follows:\n\n\"Termination .'\nThe services of an employee may be terminated without as-\nsigning any reason, as under:\n\n(a) of a permanent employee by giving him 30 day's notice in\nwriting or pay in lieu of notice;\n\n(b) of any employee on probation by giving him 7 days'\nnotice in writing or pay in lieu of notice:\n\n(c) of a temporary employee by giving him 24 hours' notice\nin writing or pay in lieu of notice.\n\n224\n\nExplanation.' For the purposes of the regulation, the word\n\"pay\" shall include all emoluments which would be admissible\nif he were on Privilege leave.\"\n\n After the decisions of this Court declaring the afore-\nsaid Regulation as void in Civil Appeal No. 19 of 1982 in\nthe Case of Manohar P. Kharkar & Anr. v. Kaghu Raj & Anr.,\nAir India amended the aforesaid Regulation, which now reads\nas under:\n\n\"(a) The services of a permanent employee may be terminated\nwithout assigning any reasons to him/her and without any\nprior notice but only to the following grounds not amounting\nto misconduct under Service \nRegulation 42\n, namely:\n\n(i) if he/she is, in the opinion of the Corporation (the\nBoard of Directors of Air India) incompetent and unsuitable\nfor continued employment with the Corporation and such\nincompetence and unsuitability is such as to make his/her\ncontinuance in employment detrimental to the interests of\nthe Corporation;\n\n OR\nIf his/her continuance in employment constitutes, in the\nopinion of the Corporation (the Board of Directors of Air\nIndia), a/grave security risk making his/her continuance in\nservice detrimental) to the interests of the Corporation;\n\n OR\nIf, in the opinion of the Corporation (the Board of Direc-\ntors of Air India), there is such a justifiable lack of\nconfidence which, having regard to the nature of duties\nperformed, would make it necessary, in the interest of the\nCorporation, to immediately terminate his/her services.\n\n(b) The services of an employee on probation may be termi-\nnated without assigning any reason to him/her but on giving\n30 days notice in writing or pay in lieu thereof.\n\n(c) The services of a temporary employee may be terminated\nwithout assigning any reason to him/her but on giving 15\ndays notice in writing or pay in lieu thereof.\n\n225\n\nExplanation For the purpose of this Regulation the word\n\"pay\" shall include all emoluments which would be admissible\nif he were on privilege leave.\"\n\n The question regarding justification of the action taken\nby the management was touched by this Court, but since the\naction was based on the old \nRegulation 48\n, it had to be\nquashed. It was submitted on behalf of the Air India that\ncare had been taken to suit the circumstances in which the\nservices of an employee could be terminated by way of dis-\ncharge simpliciter and without holding enquiry. These are\neventualities which do not constitute misconduct and yet\nretention of an employee in the service of the management\nfor any one of the grounds mentioned in the said Regulation\nmight be considered as detrimental for the management or\nagainst public interest. It was submitted that the said\nregulation 48 has to be read with \nRegulation 44(A)\n which\nreads as under:\n\n\"44(A)(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Regu-\nlations and if, in the opinion of the Corporation (the Board\nof Directors of Air India), it is not possible or practica-\nble to hold an enquiry under the relevant provisions of\nthese Regulations, the Corporation may, if satisfied that\nthe employee has been guilty of any misconduct, any one of\nthe punishment mentioned in \nRegulation 43\n on the employee\nconcerned.\n\nProvided that before exercising his extra ordinary power,\nthe Board shall give 30 days prior notice to the employee\nconcerned of the act of misconduct that the reasons why it\nis not possible or practicable to hold an enquiry into such\nmisconduct, and the punishment proposed by the Board and the\nemployee shall be entitled to make a full written represen-\ntation to the Board in response to such notice.\n\n(ii) No action shall be taken under the Regulation until the\nBoard has taken into consideration the representation made\nby the concerned employee under the proviso to Section (i)\nwithin the notice period.\"\n\n The original regulation 44 was also modified. According\nto the interveners, the cumulative reading of regulation 48,\nas amended, and regulation 44, as amended, would clearly\nestablish that the vice, if any, of arbitrariness is com-\npletely removed and sufficient guidelines are\n\n226\n\nmade available to the Board of Directors to exercise the\nrestricted and limited power now available to the employer\nunder these Regulations.\n\n \nIn C.M.P. No. 30309 of 1988, on behalf of the New India\nAssurance Co., the intervention application was filed. It\nwas stated that in the courts below the writ petition No.\n835 of 1975 was filed by the employee challenging his termi-\nnation and the appeal filed thereon were decided on grounds\navailable to the petitioner at that time. A special leave\npetition was filed by the employee concerned which has now\nbecome C.A. No. 655 of 1984. After the judgment in the\n\nCentral Inland Water\n's case (supra), an additional ground is\nnow being taken to contend that a contract entered into way\nback in the sixties when the employee concerned was an\nemployee of the Orissa Cooperative Insurance Society Ltd.,\nCuttack could not be enforced now and the same ought to be\ndeclared void in view of the Central Inland Water's case\n(supra).\n\n The intervention was allowed on 24th January, 1990 and\nSmt. Shyamla Pappu, Senior Advocate submitted written sub-\nmissions. It was submitted that adjudication on the merits\nand the consideration of the facts and circumstances of the\ncase may be left to the Bench hearing the matter after the\ndecision of the question of law referred to the Constitution\nBench.\n\n In this connection, it may, however, be noted that the\nGeneral Insurance was nationaIised under the provisions of\nthe \nGeneral Insurance Provisions (Nationalisation) Act, 1972\n\nand the said Act came into force on 20th September, 1972.\nPrior to this, \nGeneral Insurance (Emergency Provisions) Act,\n1971\n was passed under the provisions of which Act all under-\ntakings of all Insurers vested in the Central Government\nwith effect from I3th May, 1971. This was pending nationali-\nsation which took place in 1972 as aforesaid.\n \nSection 7(1)\n of the said Act which provided for the\ntakeover of former employees reads as under:\n\n\"Every whole-time officer or other employee of an existing\nInsurer other than an Indian Insurance Company, who was\nemployed by that insurer, wholly or mainly with his general\ninsurance business immediately before the appointed day,\nshall, on the appointed day, become an officer or other\nemployee, as the case may be, of the Insurance Company, in\nwhich the Undertaking to which the service of the officer\n\n227\n\nor other employee relates has vested and shall hold his\noffice or service on the same terms and conditions and with\nthe same rights to pension, gratuity and other matters as\nwould have been admissible to him if there had been no such\nvesting and shall continue to do so until his employment in\nthe Indian Insurance Company in which the undertaking or\npart has vested, is terminated or until his remuneration,\nterms and conditions are duly altered by that Indian Insur-\nance Company.\"\n\n The original terms and conditions had not been altered\nand the employees like the appellant in C.A. No. 855/84\ncontinued to be governed by the original terms and condi-\ntions of the contract at the time of termination. The origi-\nnal terms and conditions of employment, therefore, continued\nin force. The contract of service was entered into when the\nappellant joined the Orissa Cooperative Insurance Society\nLtd. way back in 196 1 and at the time of take-over by the\nCentral Government was the Divisional Manager of the said\nsociety. After the take over by the Central Government of\ngeneral insurance in 1972, a great deal of reorganisation\nhad to be effected in order to tone up the system of general\ninsurance which had become unwieldy due to the mushroom\ngrowth of societies with no control whatsoever when insur-\nance was in private hands.\n\n It was submitted by Smt. Shyamla Pappu that there are\nmany such cases where action was taken soon after nationali-\nsation of general insurance in 1972. If such orders are set\naside today, Smt. Shyamla Pappu posed the question, what\nwould be the result? Would the order set aside, at this\nstage give the employee a right to be reinstated'? If the\nanswer to the above is in the affirmative, would it be\nconducive to efficiency in the conduct of a public utility\nsuch as general insurance, Smt. Pappu raised the question.\nWould it not hamper the Company's business considering that\nthe reduction/reorganisation of staff was essential for the\neffective functioning of the public service? Smt. Pappu\nasked the question would the public service not be saddled\nwith unnecessary and/or incompetent staff, thus, burdening\nthe public utility/service with unmanageable costs and staff\nthat is ineffective'? It was urged that the New India Assur-\nance Company had a clause, in the contract at the relevant\ntime, which was as follows:\n\n\"in the event of the society not having any further need of\nany employees services, whether permanent or temporary,\nwhich shall be decided by the board, the Principal Officer\n\n228\n\nshall give 30 days notice in writing for termination of his\nservices or in lieu thereof pay such employee a sum equiva-\nlent to one month pay including allowance upto the period of\nnotice.\"\n\n \nThe above clause covered cases of retrenchment, aboli-\ntion of posts and other situations which had been adjudicat-\ned upon by this Court. If, however, the \nCentral Inland\nWater\n's case (supra) is applied, Smt. Shyamla Pappu submit-\nted, then the management of the Intervene r Company will be\npowerless even in a case of abolition of posts or retrench-\nment or any other allied situation. It is seen that the\npower to terminate an employee is co-existent with the power\nto appoint. Smt. Shyamla Pappu relied on the \nGeneral Clauses\nAct\n and submitted that the Central Inland Water's case\n(supra) was erroneous in so far as it made a complete nega-\ntion of this power.\n \nThen, it was submitted by her that in\ncase of an employer who had made all the necessary investi-\ngation and the employee concerned has been fully heard\nbefore the order 01' termination and if the decision of\n\nCentral Inland Water\n's case was applied, then even such a\ncase would be a case of illegal termination, considering\nthat there would be no power to terminate.\n \nIt was submitted\nthat the \nCentral Inland Water\n's case had to be read down\nbecause paras 77, 92 and 93 of the report take in even\nprivate employment. The sweep of the judgment cannot hold\ngood and had to be curtailed.\n\n According to Smt. Pappu, what then was the position of\nterminations effected when the law was different? It cannot\nbe said that they are entitled to relief now. It should be\nclarified that the judgment of this Court would apply pro-\nspectively, it was submitted. Past cases might be treated as\nconcluded in view of the law prevailing at that time and\nalso in view of the contentions urged by the parties in the\ncourts below at various stages. In the event, this Court\ncomes to the conclusion that even old cases would be covered\nby the judgment now rendered, the orders already passed may\nbe upheld and a post-decisional hearing might be directed so\nthat the management concerned has the opportunity of showing\nthat there existed good reasons for termination though the\nsame were not communicated to the employee concerned because\nthe law then existing did not require such a communication.\nIn the interest of justice, we should allow such a course.\n In the light of the provisions and in the facts and the\ncircumstances of the case, it is, therefore, necessary to\nconsider the validity of the power of termination of employ-\nment by the employers or authorities of the employees with-\nout holding any enquiry in the circum-\n\n229\n\nstances noted in the several civil appeals and applications\nherein.\n\n \nIn these civil appeals. the question of actual user of\npower is not the main issue. but the validity of clauses or\nregulations containing the aforesaid power. The instances of\nactual user of power, however, are not wholly irrelevant on\nthe question of the validity or extent of the power because\nthese explain the extent and content of power and/or occa-\nsion for such user. Firstly. we have to. in view of the\nfacts and the circumstances of the Civil Appeal No. 2876 of\n1986, consider the amplitude of the power under clause (b)\nof \nRegulation 9\n of the Regulations concerned. We have noted\nthe contents of that Regulation. We have also noted the\namplitude of the expression of that power as was canvassed\nbefore the High Court in the matter under appeal and as\nnoticed by the decision of this Court in \nDelhi Transport\nUndertaking v. Balbir Saran Goel\n's case (supra). A survey of\nthe several authorities of law and the development of law\nfrom time to time would lead one to the conclusion that the\nphilosophy of the Indian Constitution, as it has evolved,\nfrom precedent to precedent. has broaden the horizons of the\nright of the employees and they have been assured security\nof tenures and ensured protection against arbitrariness and\ndiscrimination in discharge or termination of his employ-\nment. This is the basic concept of the evolution from the\ndifferent angles of law of master and servant or in the\nevolution of employer and employee relationship. It is true\nthat. the law has travelled in different channels, govern-\nment servants or servants or employees having status have to\nbe differentiated from those whose relationships are guided\nby contractual obligations.\n\n But it has to be borne in mind that we are concerned in\nthese matters with the employees either of semi-Government\nor statutory corporations or public undertakings who enjoy\nthe rights. privileges. limitations and inhibitions of\ninstitutions who come within the ambit of \nArticle 12\n of the\nConstitution. It is in the background of these parameters\nthat we must consider the question essentially and basically\nposed in these matters. The basic and the fundamental ques-\ntion to be judged is. in what manner and to what extent, the\nemployees of these bodies or corporations or institutions\ncould be affected in their security of tenure by the employ-\ners consistent with the rights evolved over the years and\nrights emanating from the philosophy of the Constitution as\nat present understood and accepted.\n\n We have noted the exhaustive and the learned analysis of\nthe background of the diverse facts projected in the several\ncases and appeals before us.\n\n230\n\nEfficiency of the administration of these undertakings is\nvery relevant consideration. Production must continue,\nservices must be maintained and run. Efficacy of the serv-\nices can be manned by the disciplined employees or workers.\nDiscipline, decency and order will have to be maintained.\nEmployees should have sense of participation and involvement\nand necessarily sense of security in semi-permanent or\nquasi-permanent or permanent employment. There must be scope\nfor encouragement for good work. In what manner and in what\nmeasure. this should be planned and ensured within the\nframework of the Constitution and, power mingled with obli-\ngations, and duties enjoined with rights, are matters of\nconstitutional adjustment at any particular evolved stage of\nthe philosophy of our Constitution.\n\n We have noted several decisions, numerous as these are,\nand the diverse facts, as we have found. We have noted that\nin some cases arbitrary action or whimsical action or dis-\ncriminatory action can flow or follow by the preponderance\nof these powers. The fact that the power so entrusted with a\nhigh ranking authority or body is not always a safe or sound\ninsurance against misuse. At least, it does not always\nensure against erosion of credibility in the exercise of the\npower in particular contingency. Yet, discipline has to be\nmaintained, efficiency of the institution has to be ensured.\nIt has to be recognised that quick actions are very often\nnecessary in running of an institution or public service or\npublic utility and public concern. It is not always possible\nto have enquiry because disclosure is difficult; evidence is\nhesitant and difficult, often impossible. In those circum-\nstances, what should be the approach to the location of\npower and what should be the content and extent of power,\npossession and exercise of which is essential for efficient\nrunning of the industries or services'? It has to be a\nmatter both of balancing and adjustment on which one can\nwager the salvation of rights and liberties of the employees\nconcerned and the future of the industries or the services\ninvolved.\n\n Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles and objects, it\nappears to us that the power to terminate the employment of\npermanent employment must be there. Efficiency and expedien-\ncy and the necessity of running an industry or service make\nit imperative to have these powers. Power must, therefore,.\nwith authorities to take decision quickly, objectively and\nindependently. Power must be assumed with certain conditions\nof duty. The preamble, the policy, purpose of the enacting\nprovision delimit the occasions or the contingencies for the\nneed for the exercise of the power and these should limit\nthe occasions\n\n231\n\nof exercise of such powers. The manner in which such exer-\ncise of power should be made should ensure fairness, avoid\narbitrariness and mala fide and create credibility in the\ndecisions arrived at or by exercise of the power. All these\nare essential to ensure that power is fairly exercised and\nthere is fair play in action. Reasons, good and sound, must\ncontrol the exercise of power.\n\n We have noted the rival submissions. Learned Attorney\nGeneral of India and the learned Solicitor General and\nothers appearing those who sought for sustaining the power\nby the employers or the authorities, contend that for effi-\nciency of the industry, for the attainment of the very\npurpose for which institutions are created, there should be\npower to terminate the employment- of undesirable, ineffi-\ncient, corrupt, indolent, disobedient employees in those\ncases where holding of enquiry or prolonging these employees\nfor that purpose would be detrimental, difficult and frus-\ntrating. It is in this context that we should examine the\npower under the aforesaid \nRegulation 9(b)\n. The power must be\nthere, the power must be utilised by person or authority,\nhigh ranking enough or senior enough who can be trusted or\nwho can be presumed to be able to act fairly, objectively\nand independently. The occasion for the exercise of the\npower must be delimited with precision, clarity or objectiv-\nity. And those occasions must be correlated to the purpose\nfor which the powers are sought to be exercised. In concrete\nterms, for the running of the industry or the service,\nefficiently, quickly and in a better manner or to avoid\ndeadlocks or inefficiency or friction, the vesting of the\npower in circumstances must be such that will evoke credita-\nbility and confidence. Reasons must be there, reasons must\nbe perspectable, reasons must be relevant and the reasons\nmust be of authority independently, fairly and objectively\narrived at.\n\n Notice of hearing may or may not be given, opportunity\nin the form of an enquiry may or not be given, yet arbi-\ntrariness and discrimination and acting whimsically must be\navoided. These power must, therefore, be so read that the\npowers can be exercised on reasons, reasons should be re-\ncorded, reasons need not always be communicated, must be by\nauthorities who are competent and are expected to act fair-\nly, objectively and independently. The occasion for the use\nof power must be clearly circumscribed in the above limits.\nThese must also circumscribe that the need for exercise of\nthose power without holding a detailed or prolonged enquiry\nis there.\n\nAs we have noted, a good deal of controversy was that these\n\n232\n\ninhibitions or limitations or conditions are not there in\nthe amplitude or the extent of the power enumerated or\nstated in \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the aforesaid Regulations\nconcerned or of similar provisions that we have examined in\nthese cases.\n\n We have noted the argument, learned and interesting, on\nthe question of judicial law making imputing to the legisla-\ntures what these have not articulated. Should the courts say\nor can say what the legislatures have not said'? We have\nnoted the controversy of how should legislation of limited\nlegislatures, Parliaments or rule making bodies, who are not\nexpected or enjoined to make rules or laws contrary to or in\nderogation or the constitutional prohibitions and inhibi-\ntions be read. We have been tempted to read down in the path\nof judicial law making on the plea that legislature could\nnot have intended to give powers to the authorities or\nemployers which would be violative of fundamental rights of\nthe persons involved in the exercise of those powers and,\ntherefore, should be attributed those powers on conditions\nwhich will only make these legal or valid. Our law making\nbodies are not law into themselves and cannot create or make\nall laws. They can only confer powers or make laws for the\nconferment of powers on authorities which are legal and\nvalid. Such powers conferred must conform to the consitu-\ntional inhibitions. The question, therefore, is--is it\npossible or desirable to read down the power conferred under\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n or similar regulations permitting employer\nor the authority to terminate the employment of the employ-\nees by giving reasonable notice or pay in lieu of notice\nwithout holding enquiry with the conditions indicated or\nmentioned hereinbefore? Will it or will it not amount to\nmaking laws of stating which the legislature or the law\nmaking body has not stated?\n\n We have been reminded that judges should not make laws.\nBut the question is--can the judges articulate what is\ninarticulate and what can be reasonably and plainly found to\nbe inherent on the presumption that a legislature or a law\nmaking body with the limited authority would act only within\nlimitations so as to make the legislation or law valid and\nthe legislature must be presumed to act with certain amount\nof knowledge and fairness protecting the rights of people\nconcerned and aiming at fairness in action?\n\n We have noted the rival contentions. We have noted the\nsubmission that Mr. Garg, Mr. Ramamurthi and others invited\nus not to read down and against legislating positively with\nconditions. But the question is--are those conditions which\nwe are invited to attribute to\n\n233\n\nthe legislature or the law making bodies contrary to or\nagainst the manifest intention of the legislature?\n Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is\nenacted, it is true, from experience of evils. But its\ngeneral language should not, therefore, necessarily be\nconfined to the form that evil had taken. Time works\nchanges, brings into existence new conditions and purposes\nand new awareness of limitations. Therefore, a principle to\nbe valid must be capable of wider application than the\nmischief which gave it birth. This is particularly true of\nthe constitutional constructions. \nConstitutions are not\nephemeral enactments designed to meet passing occasions.\nThese are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall,\n\"designed to approach immortality as nearly as human insti-\ntutions can approach it ..... \". In the application of a\nConstitutional limitation or inhibition, our interpretation\ncannot be only of 'what has been' but of 'what may be'. See\nthe observations of this Court in \nSunil Batra v. Delhi\nAdministration\n (supra). Where, therefore, in the interpreta-\ntion of the provisions of an Act, two constructions are\npossible, one which leads towards constitutionality of the\nlegislation would be preferred to that which has the effect\nof destroying it. If we do not read the conferment of the\npower in the manner we have envisaged before, the power is\nliable to be struck down as bad. This, we say in spite of\nthe argument by many including learned Solicitor General of\nIndia and Smt. Shyamla Pappu that in contractual obligations\nwhile institutions or organisations or authorities, who come\nwithin the arebit of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution are free\nto contract on the basis of 'hire and fire' and the theory\nof the concept of unequal bargain and the power conferred\nsubject to constitutional limitations would not be applica-\nble. We are not impressed and not agreeable to accept that\nproposition at this stage of the evolution of the constitu-\ntional philosophy of master and servant framework or if you\nwould like to call it employer or employee relationship.\nTherefore, these conferments of the powers on the employer\nmust be judged on the constitutional peg and so judged\nwithout the limitations indicated aforesaid, the power is\nliable to be considered as arbitrary and struck down.\n Whenever a statute comes up for consideration, it must\nbe remembered that it is not within human powers to ,foresee\nthe manifold sets of facts which may arise, and, even if it\nwere, it is not possible to provide for them in terms free\nfrom all ambiguity. The English language, and for that\nmatter any language in use today, is not an instrument of\nmathematical precision. It has been said that our literature\nwould have been much the poorer if it were.Leaving, how-\n\n234\n\never. the question of richness or poverty of our literature\napart, we must proceed on the assumption that human mind\ncannot foresee everything. It has, therefore, been said that\nwhen a question arises whether the power has been properly\nconferred and even if so, the extent of it. Lord Denning has\nopined that a Judge in such a situation cannot simply fold\nhis hand and blame the draftsmen and look for new enactment.\nLord Denning invites us to set to work on the construction\ntask of finding the intention of the Parliament or the law\nmaking body and we must. however. do this not only from the\nlanguage of the statute. because. as we have seen. language\nis an imperfect medium and very often thoughts are perpetu-\nally in search of 'broken language'. But the judge must also\ndo it from a consideration of the social conditions which\ngive rise to it, and o[ the mischief which it was intended\nto remedy and also in the light of the constitutional inhi-\nbitions and then supplant the written words and add to it\nend give 'force and life' to the intention and purpose of\nthe legislature or the law making authority. A judge must\nnot alter the material of which a law or an instrument is\nwoven, but he can and should iron out the creases and if one\nmay venture to say, make articulate the inarticulate premise\nbut make articulate only which follow from necessary compul-\nsions of the situations and the constitutional position. See\nin this connection the observations of Lord Denning in \"The\nDiscipline of Law\" at p. 12.\n\n It is true that judicial jealously of legislature in law\nmaking has long been outdrawn, but the strict construction\nremains still an established rule. It is generally accepted\nprinciple that judges in interpreting statutes, should give\neffect to the legislators' intent. By doing so. the courts\ndo recognise their subordinate position and their obligation\nto help the legislature to achieve its purpose. But in that\neffort. creativity is essential. There have been differences\nof opinion on the practices that the courts may employ in\nattempting to discover the legislative intent. In the begin-\nning, conventional practice was only to look to the words of\nthe statutes. Now the entire spectrum has to be examined. It\nhas been said that judges are not unfettered glossators.\n\n is true that there is no actual expression used ena-\nbling the legislation or the statute in question indicating\nthe limitations or conditions as aforesaid. But it must\nproceed on the premise that the law making authority intend-\ned to make a valid law to confer power validly or which will\nbe valid. The freedom, therefore, to search the spirit of\nthe enactment or what is intended to obtain or to find the\nintention of the Parliament gives the Court the power to\nsupplant and supplement the expressions used to say what was\nleft unsaid. This is a power which\n\n235\n\nis an important branch of judicial power, the concession of\nwhich if taken to the extreme is dangerous, but denial of\nthat power would be ruinous and this is not contrary to the\nexpressed intention of the legislature or the implied pur-\npose of the legislation. It was not as Shri Ramamurthi tried\nto argue that legislature wanted to give an uncontrolled and\nabsolute power to discharge employees on the part of the\nemployers without any enquiry in all circumstances. That\ncannot be and that was not intended to be as can be implied\nfrom all the circumstances.\n\n In the aforesaid view of the matter, I would sustain the\nconstitutionality of this conferment of power by reading\nthat the power must be exercised on reasons relevant for the\nefficient running of the services or performing of the job\nby the societies or the bodies. It should be done objective-\nly, the reasons should be recorded, it should record this\nand the basis that it is not feasible or possible reasonably\nto hold any enquiry without disclosing the evidence which in\nthe circumstances of the case would be hampering the running\nof the institution. The reasons should be recorded, it need\nnot be communicated and only for the purpose of the running\nof the institution, there should be factors which hamper the\nrunning of the institution without the termination of the\nemployment of the employee concerned at that particular time\neither because he is a surplus, inefficient, disobedient and\ndangerous.\n\n Construction or interpretation of legislative or rule\nprovisions proceeds on the assumption that courts must seek\nto discover and translate the intention of the legislature\nor the rule-making body. This is one of the legal fictions\nupon the hypothesis of which the framework of adjudication\nof the intention of a piece of legislation or rule proceeds.\nBut these are fictional myths to a large extent as experi-\nence should tell us. In most of the cases legislature, that\nis to say, vast majority of the people who are supposed to\nrepresent the views and opinions of the people, do not have\nany intention, even if they have, they cannot and do not\narticulate those intentions. On most of these issues their\nis no comprehension or understanding. Reality would reveal\nthat it is only those who are able to exert their view-\npoints, in a common parliamentary jargon, the power lobby,\ngets what it wants, and the machinery is of a bureaucratic\nset up who draft the legislation or rule or law. So, there-\nfore, what is passed on very often as the will of the people\nin a particular enactment is the handy work of a bureaucrat-\nic machine produced at the behest of a power lobby control-\nling the corridors of power in a particular situation. This\ntakes the mythetical\n\n236\n\nshape of the 'intention of the people' in the form of legis-\nlation. Again, very often, the bureaucratic machine is not\nable to correctly and properly transmute what was intended\nto be conveyed. In such a situation, is it or is it not\nbetter, one would ponder to ask, whether the courts should\nattribute to the law-making body the knowledge of the values\nand limitations of the Constitution, and knowledge of the\nevils that should be remedied at a particular time and in a\nsituation that should be met by a particular piece of legis-\nlation, and the court with the experience and knowledge of\nlaw, with the assistance of lawyers trained in this behalf,\nshould endeavour to find out what will be the correct and\nappropriate solution, and construe the rule of the legisla-\ntion within the ambit of constitutional limitations and upon\nreasonable judgment of what should have been expressed. In\nreality, that happens in most of the cases. Can it be con-\ndemned as judicial usurpation of law-making functions of the\nlegislature thereby depriving the people of their right to\nexpress their will? This is a practical dilemma which Judges\nmust always, in cases of interpretation and construction,\nface and a question which they must answer.\n\n I have noted the guidelines for the exercise of the\npower, preamble, relevant sections from which the reasons\nshould be inferred and recorded, although they need not be\ncommunicate. These should be recorded in order to ensure\neffective judicial review in a given case. Termination\nsimpliciter under \nRegulation 9(b)\n or similar powers can be\nexercised only in circumstances other than those in regula-\ntion 9(a). The exercise of such powers can only be for\npurposes germane and relevant to the statute. There are\nseveral illustrations of that, namely, the employee is\nincompetent or unsuitable so as to make his continuance in\nthe employment detrimental to the interest of the institu-\ntion, where the continuance of the employee is a grave\nsecurity risk making his continuance detrimental to the\ninterest of the Corporation and where because of the conduct\nof the employee, there is lack of confidence in the employee\nwhich makes it necessary in the interest of the Corporation\nto immediately terminate the services of the employee.\nThese, however, are illustrative and not exhaustive. There-\nfore, each case of the conferment of the power involved\nshould be decided on the aforesaid basis.\n\n I am conscious that clear intention as indicated in a\nlegislation cannot be permitted to be defeated by means of\nconstruction. It has been said that if the legislature has\nmanifested a clear intention to exercise an unlimited power,\nit is impermissible to read down the amplitude of that power\nso as to make it limited. I do not agree. Our\n\n237\n\nlegislatures are limited by the constitutional inhibitions\nand it is time, in my opinion, that we should read their\nActs and enactments with the attribute that they know their\nlimits and could not have intended to violate the Constitu-\ntion. It is true that where there are clear, unambiguous and\npositive terms in a legislation, the Court should be loath\nto read down. It should proceed with a straight-forward\nmethod of striking down such legislations. But where the\nstatute is silent or not expressive or inarticulate, the\nCourt must read down in the silence of the statute and in\nthe inarticulation of its provisions, the constitutional\ninhibitions and transmute the major inarticulate premise\ninto a reality and read down the statute accordingly. It is\ntrue perhaps, as has been said, that in the history of\nconstitutional law, statutes are seldom read down to mean\nwhat they say and intend. It is begging the question. If the\nstatutes are seldom read down to mean what they say and\nintend. It is begging the question. If the statute does not\nspecifically say, in such circumstances, as to how do we\nfind the intention to transgress the constitutional limita-\ntions. At least, the relevant provisions of the relevant\nstatutes and the rules, mentioned hereinbefore, are, in my\nopinion, on these points, not expressive enough to betray an\nintention transgress constitutional limitations. I am afraid\nthat reference to Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v. United States,\n398 US 333; 26 L.Ed. 2d 308 is inept in the background of\nthe principles we are confronted with. The plain thrust of\nlegislative enactment has to be found out in the inarticu-\nlate expressions and in the silence of the legislation. In\ndoing so, to say what the legislature did not specifically\nsay, is not distortion to avert any constitutional colli-\nsion, In the language of the relevant provisions with which\nwe are confronted, I do not find that intention of the\nlegislature to flout the constitutional limitations.\n I am also unable to accept the contention of Mr. Garg as\nwell as Mr. Ramamurthi that it is clear as a result of the\nconstitutional position of the security of tenure of the\nemployees as well as the expressed language of the provi-\nsions of several enactments that there is no valid power of\nthe termination of employment of the permanent employees\nwithout holding an enquiry or giving an opportunity to the\nemployees to rebut the charges on the grounds of termination\nin all circumstances. It was contended, as I have noted, by\nShri R.K. Garg that no principle of interpretation permitted\nreading down a provision so as to make it into a different\nprovision altogether different from what was intended by the\nlegislature or its delegate. \nReference was made to the\ndecision of this Court in \nR.M.D.C.\n 's case (supra). I am\nunable to accept this contention. It is not that the reading\ndown is used for a purpose which is just the opposite which\nthe legislature had intended.\n\n238\n\nLegislature had not intended arbitrary or uncontrolled or\nwhimsical power. Indeed it considered. This is not the\nproper way to read that power in the said \nRegulation 9(b)\n.\nPara 522 of the Shastri Award, read properly, must be cir-\ncumscribed with the conditions indicated above as a neces-\nsary corollary or consequence of that power. It is also not\nreading to the legislature conditions which were not there\nin the second proviso \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution. \nIn\nview of the ratio of the five-judge Bench decision of this\nCourt in \nTulsiram\n's case (supra), which had examined all the\nrelevant decisions, I am unable to accept the submission of\nShri R.K. Garg and Mr. Ramamurthi. Absolute powers, it is\ntrue, cannot be regulated without essential legislative\npolicy, but here properly read, absolute power was not\nthere. Power that was only constitutionally valid, that\npower can be presumed to have been given and if that pre-\nsumption is made, conditions indicated above inevitably\nattach.\n\n We are not concerned with the concept of industrial\ndemocracy sought to be propounded by Mr. Garg in this case.\nThe validity and the propriety of having industrial democra-\ncy is not in issue. What is in issue is demonstrable fair\nplay and justice, as sought for by Mr. Garg, in the exercise\nof the power which must be conceded as an essential at-\ntribute for proper functioning of the institution.\n It is true that no drafts as such have been submitted by\nthe learned Attorney General or by the learned Solicitor\nGeneral nor by any counsel appearing for the management. But\nthese conditions, which we have noted, are necessary corol-\nlary flowing from the conferment of the power of termination\nin a constitutional manner for the smooth, proper and effi-\ncient running of the industry.\n\n In the aforesaid view of the matter, 1 am unable to\naccept the submissions of Mr. Garg and Mr. Ramamurthi. The\npower must be there, the power must be read down in the\nmanner and to the extent indicated above, in my opinion, of\nterminating the services of permanent employees without\nholding any enquiry in the stated contingencies and this\nwould be by either virtue of the silence of the provision\nindicating the contingencies of termination or by virtue of\nconstitutional inhibitions. That reading would not violate\nthe theory that judges should not make laws.\n\n In the aforesaid view of the matter, I direct that\nwhenever question of exercise of the power of termination of\npermanent employees by reasonable notice without holding any\nenquiry arises, the extent of\n\n239\n\nthe power should be read in the manner indicated above and\nwe reiterate that such powers can be exercised for the\npurposes of the Act which will be determinable by the pream-\nble and by relevant enacting provisions and the contingen-\ncies for the exercise of the power must be specified and\npowers should be exercised by authority competent and inde-\npendent enough and should be articulated by reasons stated\neven if not communicated. These are the limitations inherent\nand latent in the framework of our Constitution and the\npower with these limitations is valid.\n\n Having regard to the aforesaid view, I will have to\ndispose of the appeals in terms of the aforesaid principles.\n Next the question arises--what would be the position of\nthe rights and liabilities determined as anterior to or\nbefore our reading these powers to be conditioned as afore-\nsaid. Having regard to the finality of the position of law\nand having regard to the theory that parties have adjusted\ntheir rights on the understanding of the law as it was, in\nour opinion, justice of the situation would be met if we\ndeclare and hold that pending litigations should be examined\nin the light of the aforesaid principles and dispose of in\nthe aforesaid light, namely, where issues of damages or\nconsequences of termination by virtue of exercise of the\npower are still pending adjudication in any forum and have\nnot been finally adjudicated, these should be re-examined by\nthe appropriate authorities before whom these issues are\npending in the light of these principles, that is say, the\nexercise of the power should be judged on these conditions\nand in the light of those conditions. If in the light of\nthese conditions, the exercise of the power is valid, the\ntermination should be held to be valid, if on the other\nhand, there was exercise without compliance with these\nconditions, the termination would be invalid and conse-\nquences in law of damages or reinstatement or others will\nfollow. But previous terminations where the lis is no longer\npending before any authority will not be reopened. To that\nextent. I will declare this to be the law prospectively.\n I had, after circulating the draft judgment herein, the\nadvantage of the views of my learned brothers. They do not\nagree with me. With respect. I am definitely of the opinion\nthat time has come for the judicial interpretation to play\nfar more active, creative and purposeful role in deciding\nwhat is \"according to law\". Law as evolved in India today,\nin my opinion, makes the limitations on user of power quite\nclear and distinct, in this branch. These are constitutional\nlimitations. Therefore, every provision in any legislation\nby limited legislatures, in\n\n240\n\nmy opinion, should be judged bearing in mind that the legis-\nlature and the law-making authorities were aware and are\nbound by these constitutional limitations. These inhibitions\nmust be read into these provisions so that law becomes\neffective, purposeful and legal. In that view of the matter,\nI am of the opinion that we should approach the question of\nconstitutional limitations or inhibitions in our interpreta-\ntion in deciding in each individual cases by not 'what has\nbeen' but 'what may be'. This is the role and purpose of\nconstitutional interpretation by the apex Court of the\ncountry. I know that this view of mine is not shared in this\ndecision by my learned brothers. I respect their views, but\nI would like to hope that one day or the other this Court\nwould be mature enough to fulfil what is purposeful and I\nbelieve to be the true role and purpose of the Court in\ninterpretation in the light of constitutional inhibitions.\nHaving had the advantage of the views of my learned broth-\ners, I regret, with respect, I cannot join them in their\nviews. I am the loser for the same, but I will fondly hope\nonly for the time being.\n\n I believe that we must do away with 'the childish fic-\ntion' that law is not made by the judiciary. Austin in his\nJurisprudent at page 65, 4th edn. has described the BIack-\nstone's principle of finding the law as 'the childish fic-\ntion'. Chief Justice K. Subba Rao in I.C. Golak Nath & Ors.\nv. State of Punjab & Ant'., [1967] 2 SCR 762 at p. 811 has\nreferred to these observations. This Court under \nArticle 14\n1\n of the Constitution is enjoined to declare law. The ex-\npression 'declared' is wider than the words 'found or made'.\nTo declare is to announce opinion. Indeed, the latter in-\nvolves the process, while the former expresses result.\nInterpretation, ascertainment and evolution are parts of the\nprocess, while that interpreted, ascertained or evolved is\ndeclared as law. The law declared by this Court is the law\nof the land. To deny this power to this Court on the basis\nof some outmoded theory that the Court only finds law but\ndoes not make it, is to make ineffective the powerful in-\nstrument of justice placed in the hands of the highest\njudiciary of this country. See the observations of Chief\nJustice K. Subba Rao in 1. C. Golak Nath & Ors'. \nv. \nState of\nPunjab & Anr.\n, (supra at pp. 813/14).\n I would, therefore,\nplead for a more active and creative role for the courts in\ndeclaring what the law is.\n\n In the aforesaid light, in Civil Appeal No. 2876 of\n1986, having regard to the facts and the circumstances and\nthe attitude taken by the Delhi Transport Corporation, I do\nnot interfere with the order of the High Court. The appeal\nshall, therefore, fail.\n\n241\n\n Having regard to the facts and the circumstances and the\nobservations above. Civil Appeal No. 655 of 1984 (M.L.\nKamra v. Chairman-cum-Managing Director, New India Assurance\nCo. ) will be placed before a division bench of this Court\nto be disposed of in accordance with law and the light of\nthe observations made herein.\n\n For the reasons that I have indicated above, in Civil\nAppeal No. 1115 of 1976 (Satnam Singh v. Zilla Parishad\nFerozepur & Anr., ), with the facts herein where apparently\nno reasons were recorded, the appeal of Satnam Singh suc-\nceeds and in the interest of justice, the monetary relief\nshould be given to the appellant which is quantified at\nRs.4,83,061.90 paise (Rupees four lakhs eighty three thou-\nsand and sixty one and ninety paise). I have indicated\nbefore the basis on which this quantification has been made.\n \nFor the same reasons, Civil Appeal No. 4073(NL) of 1986\n(Mahesh Kumar Giroti v. Regional Manager, Region 11, Region-\nal Office, State Bank of India, Bareilly & Ors.), Civil\nAppeal No. 331 of 1987 (The Delhi Transport Corporation &\nAnr. v. Shri Hans Raj), Civil Appeal No. 328 of 1987 (The\nDelhi Transport Corporation & Anr. v. Shri Rohtash Singh),\nSpecial Leave Petition No. 75 12 of 1987 (\nDelhi Transport\nCorporation v. Shri Mohinder Singh & Anr.\n), and Civil\nAppeal No. 330 of 1987 (\nThe Delhi Transport Corporation &\nAnr. v. Shri Prem Singh\n) should be placed before the divi-\nsion bench of this Court to be disposed of in accordance\nwith the observations made herein and in accordance with\nlaw. The appeals I would dispose of accordingly.\n Intervention of the parties are allowed and the C.M.Ps.\nare disposed of in the aforesaid terms.\n\n RAY, J. I have had the privilege of deciphering the\njudgment rendered by the learned Chief Justice. As the\nquestion involved in these groups of appeals for decision is\nvery important, it is deemed necessary to express my views\non this important matter.\n\n \nThe pivotal question which arises for consideration is\nwhether \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Regulations framed under\n\nsection 53\n of the Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950 which\nprovides for termination of services of permanent employees\non giving simply one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof\nwithout recording any reason therefore in the order of\ntermination is arbitrary, illegal, discriminatory and viola-\ntive of Audi Alteram Partern Rule and so constitutionaly\ninvalid and void. It is\n\n242\n\nalso necessary to consider in this respect whether the said\nRule 9(b) can be interpreted and read down in such a manner\nto hold that it was not discriminatory nor arbitrary nor\ndoes it confer unbridled and uncanalised power on the trans-\nport authority to, terminate, however, the services of any\nemployee including permanent employee without any reason\nwhatsoever by the Delhi State Transport Authority. It is\nalso necessary to consider whether such a power can be\nexercised without conforming to the fundamental right em-\nbodied in the \nArticle 14\n as interpreted by this Court in\n\nE.P. Royappa\n's case that arbitrariness is the anti-thesis of\nequality enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. In\nother words, whether such a regulation has to comply with\nthe observance of fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III\nof the Constitution and whether such a power is to be exer-\ncised in furtherance of and in consonance with the Directive\nPrinciples embodied in \nArticle 38\n and \n39\n of the Constitu-\ntion.\n\n It is convenient to set out the relevant provisions of\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n framed by the Delhi Road Transport Authority\nunder the 1950 Act.\n\n9(b) Termination of services\n\n(b) Whether the termination is made due to reduction of\nestablishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned\nin (a) one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof will be\ngiven to all categories of employees.\n\n On a plain reading of this Regulation it is apparent\nthat the authority has been conferred the power to terminate\nthe services of any employee whether permanent or temporary\nby giving the month's notice or pay in lieu thereof without\nrecording any reason whatsoever in the purported order of\ntermination of services. Thus a regular, temporary or perma-\nnent employee of the State Transport Authority can be dis-\nmissed or removed from service at the whims and caprices of\nthe concerned authority without any reason whatsoever and\nundoubtedly this evidence that such unbridled, indiscrimi-\nnate and uncanalised power to terminate the services even of\na permanent employee without assigning any reason and with-\nout giving any opportunity of hearing as far play and jus-\ntice demands a reasonable procedure is per se, arbitrary and\ndiscriminatory. It has been contended by the Attorney Gener-\nal, appearing on behalf of the State that such a power is\nnot uncanalised or unbridled and arbitrary in as much as\nfirstly such power has been conferred on the responsible\nauthority namely D.T.C.\n\n243\n\nfor public purposes and secondly, the \nRegulation 9(b)\n is to\nbe read down so as to make it constitutionally valid. It\nwill be seen that there is guidance for exercise of this\npower in the regulation itself. It has also been submitted\nin this connection by the learned Attorney General that a\nprovision of the Constitution has to be presumed to be valid\nunless it is proved by the other side challenging the con-\nstitutional validity of such a provision that the same is\narbitrary and so void. Several authorities have been cited\nat the Bar on this point.\n\n It is profitable to refer to the earlier pronouncements\nof this Court on this crucial question. Rules 148(3) and\n149(3) in contravention of the provision of \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution were challenged before this Court in the\ncase Moti Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways,\nMaligaon, Pandu, etc., [1964] 5 SCR 683. Rule 148(3) of the\nRailways Establishment Code is set out here under:\n\n\"148(3) \"Other (non-pensionable) railway servants:\n\nThe service of other (non-pensionable) railway servants\nshall be liable to termination on notice on either side for\nthe periods shown below. Such notice is not however required\nin cases of dismissal or removal as a disciplinary measure\nafter compliance with the provisions of clause (2) of Arti-\ncle 311 of the Constitution, retirement on attaining the age\nof superannuation and termination of service due to mental\nor physical incapacity.\"\n\n In this case the service of Moti Ram Deka, a peon em-\nployed by the Railway and Sudhir Kumar Das a confirmed\nclerk, whose services have been terminated under Rule 148(3)\nof the said Rules challenged the termination of their serv-\nices before the Assam High Court which rejected the same and\nultimately it came up to this Court on Special Leave. It was\nheld by the Majority that Rules 148(3) and 149(3) are in-\nvalid in as such as they are inconsistent with the provi-\nsions of \nArt. 311(2)\n, as they purport to removal from serv-\nice of permanent servants without compliance with the proce-\ndure prescribed by \nArticle 311(2).\n It was also held that the\nRule 148(3) contravenes \nArt. 14\n as it does not give any\nguidance for exercise of the discretion by the authority\nconcerned and hence it is invalid.\n\n \nIt is necessary to refer in this connection to the\npronouncement of this Court in the case of \nParshotam Lal\nDhingra v. Union of India\n, [1958] SCR 828 where it has been\nheld that protection of \nArticle 311\n is\n\n244\n\navailable only where dismissal, removal or reduction in rank\nis sought to be inflicted by way of punishment and not\notherwise. Thus even the probationer or temporary employee\nif removed from service or dismissed from service as a penal\nmeasure having civil consequences has to conform to the\nprocedure prescribed by \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution.\nEven a probationer who has no right to the post cannot be\nremoved from service as a penal measure without complying\nwith \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution.\n\n \nIn the case of \nShyam Lal v. The State of Uttar Pradesh\nand Anr.\n, [1955] SCR 26 it was held by this Court that a\ncompulsory retirement from service under the Civil Services\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules does not amount\nto dismissal or removal within the meaning of \nArticle 311\n of\nthe Constitution and therefore does not fall within the\nprovision of the said Act.\n\n \nIn the case of \nShri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice\nS.R. Tendolkar & Others\n, [1959] SCR 279 the constitutionali-\nty of the \nCommission of Enquiry Act, 1952\n was challenged. It\nwas held that the Act was valid and intra vires and that the\nnotification was also valid excepting the words \"as and by\nway of securing redress or punishment\" in CI. 10 thereof\nwhich went beyond the Act.\n\n It has been further held that it is now well settled\nthat while \nArticle 14\n forbids class legislation, it does not\nforbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legis-\nlation. Thus, to pass the test of permissible classification\ntwo conditions must be fulfilled, namely, that (i) That the\nclassification must be rounded on an intelligible differen-\ntia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped\ntogether from others left out of the group and, (ii) that\nthat differentia must have a rational relation to the object\nsought to be achieved by the statute in question.\n It has also been held that it must be presumed that the\nlegislature understands and correctly appreciates the need\nof its own people, that its laws are directed to problems\nmade manifest by experience and that its discriminations are\nbased on adequate grounds.\n\n This Court observed in Jyoti Pershad v. The Administra-\ntor For the Union Territory of Delhi, [1962] 2 SCR 125 while\nholding that \nSection 19\n of the Slum Areas (Improvement and\nClearance) Act, 1956, was not obnoxious to the equal protec-\ntion of laws guaranteed by Art, 14 of the Constitution,\nthere was enough guidance to the competent\n\n245\n\nauthority in the use of his discretion under \nSection 19(1)\n\nof the Act. The restrictions imposed by \nSection 19\n of the\nAct could not be said to be unreasonable.\n\n It has been further observed that (1) If the statute\nitself or the rule made under it applies unequally to per-\nsons or things similarly situated, it would be an instance\nof a direct violation of the Constitutional Guarantee and\nthe provision of the statute or the rule in question would\nhave to be struck down.\n\n (2) The enactment or the rule might not in terms enact a\ndiscriminatory rule of law but might enable an unequal or\ndiscriminatory treatment to be accorded to persons or things\nsimilarly situated. This would happen when the legislature\nvests a discretion in an authority, be it the Government or\nan administrative official acting either as an executive\nofficer or even in a quasi-judicial capacity by a legisla-\ntion which does not lay down any policy or disclose any\ntangible or intelligible purpose, thus clothing the authori-\nty with unguided and arbitrary powers enabling it to dis-\ncriminate.\n\n \nIn \nState of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei & Ors.\n,\n[1967] 2 SCR 625 the respondent joined service of the State\nGovernment in 1938. In the service record certain date of\nbirth was recorded. In 196 1 Government held enquiry as to\ndate of birth and she was asked to show cause why a certain\ndate of birth should not be taken as a date of birth. The\nenquiry report was not disclosed to her and she was not\ngiven any opportunity to meet the evidence. The Government\nrefixed her date of birth and ordered that she will be\ncompulsorily retired. It was held that such a enquiry and\ndecision were contrary to the basis concept of justice and\ncannot have any value. It is true that the order is adminis-\ntrative in character, but even an administrative order which\ninvolves civil consequences as already stated, must be made\nconsistently with the rules of natural justice after inform-\ning the first respondent of the case of State, the evidence\nin support thereof and after giving an opportunity to the\nfirst respondent of being heard and meeting or explaining\nthe evidence. No such steps were admittedly taken; the High\nCourt was, in our judgment, right in setting aside the order\nof the State.\n\n \nIn \nA.K. Kraipak and Others v. Union of India and Others\n,\n[1969] 2 SCC 262 it has been held at page 268-269 Paragraph\n13:\n\n\"The dividing line between an administrative power and a\n\n246\n\nquasi judicial power 'is quite thin and is being gradually\nobliterated. For determining whether a power is an adminis-\ntrative power or a quasi-judicial power one has to look to\nthe nature of the power conferred, the person or persons on\nwhom it is conferred, the framework of the law conferring\nthat power, the consequences ensuing from the exercise of\nthat power and the manner in which that power is expected to\nbe exercised. Under our Constitution the rule of law per-\nvades over the entire field of administration. Every organ\nof the State under our Constitution is regulated and con-\ntrolled by the rule of law. In a welfare State like ours it\nis inevitable that the jurisdiction of the administrative\nbodies is increasing at a rapid rate. The concept of rule of\nlaw would lose its vitality if the instrumentalities of the\nState are not charged with the duty of discharging their\nfunctions in a fair and just manner. The requirement of\nacting judicially in essence is nothing but a requirement to\nact justly and fairly and not arbitrarily or capriciously.\nThe procedures which are considered inherent in the exercise\nof a judicial power are merely those which facilitate if not\nensure a just and fair decision .........\n\nWhat was considered as an administrative power some years\nback is now being considered as a quasi'judicial power. ' '\n In the case of \nUnion of India v. Col\n. J.N. Sinha and\nAnr., [1971] 1 SCR 79 1. Col. J.N. Sinha was compulsorily\nretired by an order of the President of India dated 13.8.69\nunder \nSection 56(j)\n of the Fundamental Rules from Government\nservice without assigning any reason in the order. The High\nCourt on a writ petition against the impugned order held\nthat there was violation of principles of natural justice.\nOn an appeal on Special Leave this Court held:\n\n\"Rules of natural justice are not embodied rules nor can\nthey be elevated to the position of fundamental rights. As\nobserved by this Court in \nKraipak and Ors. v. Union of India\n\n\"the aim of rules of natural justice is to secure justice or\nto put it negatively to prevent miscarriage of justice.\nThese rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law\nvalidly made. If a statutory provision can be read consist-\nently with the principles of natural justice, the courts\nshould do so because it must be presumed that the legisla-\n\n247\n\nture and the statutory authorities intend to act in accord-\nance with the principles of natural justice. But on the\nother hand a statutory provision either specifically or by\nnecessary implication excludes the application of any or all\nthe principles of natural justice then the court cannot\nignore the mandate of the legislature or the statutory\nauthority and read into the concerned provision the princi-\nples of natural justice. Whether the exercise of a power\nconferred should be made in accordance with any of the\nprinciples of natural justice or not depends upon the ex-\npress words of the provisions conferring the power, the\nnature of the power conferred, the purpose for which it is\nconferred and the effect of the exercise of that power.\"\n\n It was held that Fundamental Rule 56(j) does not in term\nrequire that any opportunity should be given to the con-\ncerned servant to show cause against the compulsory retire-\nment. The order of the President is, therefore, not bad as\nthe authority bona fide forms that opinion.\n\n \nIn the case of \nAir India Corporation v. V.A. Rebello &\nAnr.\n, AIR 1972 SC 1343 the service of the respondent was\nterminated under \nRegulation 48\n of the Air India Employees'\nService Regulations. The said \nRegulation 48\n reads as under:\n\nCHAPTER VIII--Cessation of Service\n X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\n\n48. Termination: The service of an employee may be terminat-\n\ned without assigning any reason, as under:\n\n(a) of a permanent employee by giving him 30 days' notice in\nwriting or pay in lieu of notice;\n\n(b) of an employee on probation by giving him 7 days' notice\nin writing or pay in lieu of notice;\n\n(c) of a temporary employee by giving him 24 hours' notice\nin writing or pay in lieu of notice.\n\n \nIn this case the complainant, V.A. Rebello was dismissed\nfrom service under \nRegulation 48\n by paying salary of 30 days\nin lieu of notice. The order does not suggest any misconduct\non behalf of the\n\n248\n\ncomplainant and it is not possible to hold that the order\nwas passed on any misconduct. This has been challenged by\nthe complainant by filing a complaint before the National\nIndustrial Tribunal. Under \nSection 33-A\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 the order was challenged as amounting to\ndismissal from service. The Tribunal held in its award that\nthe discharge of the respondent is not a discharge simplic-\niter but in breach of \nsection 33-A\n of Industrial Disputes\nAct and as such directed the complaint to be considered on\nthe merits. On appeal by Special Leave this Court while\nconsidering the purpose and scope of \nSection 33(1)\n and \n33(2)\n\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, held following its decision\nin \nThe Workmen of Sudder Office Cinnamara v. The Management\n,\n[1971] 2 Lab LJ 620 as follows:\n\n\"That if the termination of service is a colourable exercise\nof the power vested in the management or as a result of\nvictimisation or unfair labour practice, the Industrial\nTribunal would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside\nsuch a termination. In order to find out whether the order\nof termination is one of termination simpliciter under the\nprovisions of contract or of standing orders, the Tribunal\nhas ample jurisdiction to go into all the circumstances\nwhich led to the termination simpliciter. The form of the\norder of termination, is not conclusive of the true nature\nof the order, for it is possible that the form may be merely\na camouflage for an order of dismissal for misconduct. It\nis, therefore, open to the Tribunal to go behind the form of\nthe order and look at the substance. If the Tribunal comes\nto the conclusion that though in form the order amounts to\ntermination simpliciter but in reality cloaks a dismissal\nfor misconduct, it will be open to it to set aside the\norders as a colourable exercise of power by the management.\"\n\n \nThe same principles have also been reiterated in the\nlater decision of this Court in \nTara Oil Mills Co. Ltd. v.\nWorkmen & Anr.\n, [1964] 2 SCR 125. It has been observed in\nthis case:\n\n\"That the position of the industrial workman is different\nfrom that of a Government servant because an industrial\nemployer cannot \"hire and fire\" his workmen on the basis of\nan unfettered right under the contract of employment, that\nright now being subject to industrial adjudication; and\nthere is also on the other hand no provision of the Consti-\ntution like Arts. 3 10 and 311 requiring consideration in\nthe\n\n249\n\ncase of industrial workmen.\"\n\nIt has been further observed:\n\n\"That \nRegulation 48\n which has been set out earlier as its\nplain language shows does not lay down or contemplate any\ndefined essential pre-requisite for invoking its operation.\nAction under this Regulation can be validly taken by the\nemployer at his sweet will without assigning any reason. He\nis not bound to disclose why he does not want to continue in\nservice the employee concerned. It may be conceded that an\nemployer must always. have some reason for terminating the\nservices of his employee. Such reasons apart from misconduct\nmay, inter alia, by want of full satisfaction with his\noverall suitability in the fact that the employer is not\nfully satisfied with the overall result of the performance\nof his duties by his employee does not necessarily imply\nmisconduct on his part.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n, [1978] 2\nSCR 62 1. The petitioner was issued a passport on June 1,\n1976 under the \nPassport Act, 1967\n. On the 4th July, 1977,\nthe petitioner received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977, from\nthe Regional Passport Officer, Delhi, intimating to her that\nit was decided by the Government of India to impound her\npassport under\n s. 10(3)(c)\n of the Act \"in public interest.\"\nThe petitioner was required to surrender her passport within\n7 days from the receipt of that letter. The petitioner\nimmediately addressed a letter to the Regional Passport\nOfficer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of\nreasons for making the order as provided in \nSection 10(5)\n,\nreply was sent by the Government of India, Ministry of\nExternal Affairs on 6th July 1977 stating inter alia that\nthe Government decided \"in the interest of the general\npublic\" not to furnish her copy of the statement of reasons\nfor the making of the order. The petitioner challenges the\naction of the Government in impounding her passport by a\nwrit petition. Sub-section (1) of \nSection 10\n empowers the\nPassport Authority to vary or cancel the endorsement on a\npassport or travel document or to vary or cancel it on the\nconditions subject to which a passport or travel document\nhas been issued having regard to, inter alia, the provisions\nof s. 6(1) or any notification under \nSection 19\n. Sub-section\n(2) confers powers on the Passport Authority to vary or\ncancel the conditions of the passport or travel document on\nthe application of the holder of the passport or travel\ndocument and with the previous approval of the Central\nGovernment, Sub-section (3) pro-\n\n250\n\nvides that the Passport Authority may impound or cause to be\nimpounded or revoke a passport or travel document on the\ngrounds set out in cl.(a) to (h). The order impounding the\npassport in the present case was made by the Central Govern-\nment under cl. (c) which reads as follows:\n\n\"(c) If the passport authority deems it necessary so to do\nin the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,\nthe security of India, friendly relations of India with the\nforeign country, or in the interest of the general public.\"\n\n It was held that the right to travel and go outside the\ncountry is included in the right to Personal Liberty.\n In order to apply the test contained in Arts. 14 and 19\nof the Constitution we have to consider the objects for\nwhich the exercise of inherent rights recognised by \nArt. 21\n\nof the Constitution are restricted as well as the procedure\nby which these restrictions are sought to be imposed, both\nsubstantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them\nwill have to pass the test imposed by Arts. 14 and 19,\nwhenever facts justifying the invocation of either of these\nArticles may be disclosed. Violation for both Arts. 21 and\n19(1)(g) may be put forward making it necessary for the\nauthorities concerned to justify the restriction imposed by\nshowing satisfaction of tests of validity contemplated by\neach of these two Articles.\n\n The tests of reason and justice cannot be abstract. They\ncannot be divorced from the needs of the nation. The tests\nhave to be pragmatic otherwise they would cease to be rea-\nsonable. The discretion left to the authority to impound a\npassport in public interest cannot invalidate the law it-\nself.\n\n The orders under \nSection 10(3)\n must be based upon some\nmaterial even if the material concerns in some cases of\nreasonable suspicion arising from certain credible asser-\ntions made by reliable individual. In an emergent situation,\nthe impounding of a passport may become necessary without\neven giving an opportunity to be heard against such a step\nwhich could be reversed after an opportunity is given to the\nholder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary.\n It is well-settled that even if there is no specific\nprovision in a statute or rules made thereunder for showing\ncause against action proposed to be taken against an indi-\nvidual, which affects the right of\n\n251\n\nthat individual the duty to give reasonable opportunity to\nbe heard will be implied from the nature of the function to\nbe performed by the authority which has the power to take\npunitive or damaging action.\n\n \nAn order impounding a passport must be made quasi-judi-\ncially. This was not done in the present case. It cannot be\nsaid that a good enough reason has been shown to exist for\nimpounding the passport of the petitioner. The petitioner\nhad no opportunity of showing that the ground for impounding\nit given in this Court either does not exist or has no\nbearing on public interest or that the public interest can\nbe better served in some other manner. The order should be\nquashed and the respondent should be directed to give an\nopportunity to the petitioner to show cause against any\nproposed action on such grounds as may be available.\n Even executive authorities when taking administrative\naction which involves any deprivation of or restriction on\ninherent fundamental rights of citizens must take care to\nsee that justice is not only done but manifestly appears to\nbe done. They have a duty to proceed in a way which is free\nfrom even the appearance of arbitrariness, unreasonableness\nor unfairness. They have to act in a manner which is patent-\nly impartial and meets the requirements of natural justice.\n It is also pertinent to refer in this connection the\npronouncement of this Court in the case of \nE.P. Royappa v.\nState of Tamil Nadu and Anr.\n, [1974] 2 SCR 348.\n\n\"Equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies, one belongs\nto the rule of law in a public while the other to the whim\nand caprice of an absolute monarch. \nArticle 14\n strikes at\narbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and\nequality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness which\nlegally as well as philosophically, is an essential element\nof equality or non-arbitrariness pervades \nArticle 14\n like a\nbrooding omni-presence and the procedure contemplated by\n\nArticle 21\n must answer the test of reasonableness in order\nto be in conformity with \nArticle 14\n, it must be right and\njust and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nMunicipal Corporation of Greater Bombay\nv. Malvenkar and Ors.\n, [1978] 3 SCR 1000 the services of\nrespondent No. 2, a permanent clerk in the Bombay Electric\nSupply and Transport Undertaking, which is run by the appel-\nlant were terminated from the\n\n252\n\nclose of work on January 23,' 1968 as her record of service\nwas unsatisfactory. The order of termination stated that the\nrespondent No. 2 should be paid one month's wages in lieu of\nnotice and would also be eligible for all the benefits as\nmight be admissible under the Standing Orders and Service\nRegulations of the Undertaking. The respondent No. 2 made an\napplication before the Labour Court under \nSection 42(4)\n of\nthe Bombay Industrial Relations Act contending that the\norder terminating her services was invalid as it was not\npassed by the competent authority as envisaged by the Stand-\ning Order and that the so called Executive Assistant to the\nGeneral Manager had no authority to terminate her services\nbecause no validly sanctioned post of that designation\nexisted on 20th or 23rd January, 1968. It was also contended\nthat the aforesaid oders besides being mala fide was viola-\ntive of the principles of natural justice in as much as the\nsame was passed without holding any enquiry. The Labour\nCourt dismissed the application. The respondent's appeal\nbefore the President of the Industrial Court was however\nallowed. The Industrial Court held that the impugned orders\nbore only the initials of the Central Manager and therefore\nit was passed by an authority which was lacking in authori-\nty, the wording \"unsatisfactory service record\" cast a\nstigma and was patently punitive attracting the non-observ-\nance of Standing Order No. 26 which did not create an abso-\nlute right in the management to terminate the services of an\nemployee for misconduct without holding an enquiry or giving\nher a fair opportunity of being heard. A Writ application\nfiled by the appellant was dismissed holding inter alia that\nthe appellant was dismissed holding inter alia that the fact\nthat Standing Order 26 required reasons to be mentioned in\nthe order terminating the services of an employee did not\nmean that an order of dismissal on the ground of misconduct\ncould be converted into an order of discharge simpliciter by\nmentioning therein the nature of misconduct.\n While allowing the appeal on Special Leave it was held\nby this Court that under Standing Order 26 powers have been\ngiven to the Management in a particular case and this ques-\ntion has to be determined having regard to the substance of\nthe matter and not its form. One is the power of holding\ndisciplinary enquiry under clause (3) of Standing Order 231\nread with standing Order 23 and the other is the power to\nterminate the services of an employee by one calendar\nmonth's written notice or pay in lieu thereof under Standing\nOrder 26. The question is as to which power has been exer-\ncised by the Management in a particular case and this ques-\ntion has to be determined having regard to the substance of\nthe matter and not its form. There are two distinct and\nindependent powers and as far as possible, neither should\n\n253\n\nbe construed so as to emasculate the other or to render it\nineffective. One is the power to punish an employee for\nmisconduct while the other is the power to terminate sim-\npliciter the service of an employee without any other ad-\nverse consequences. Proviso (i) to clause (1) of Standing\nOrder 26 requires that the reason for termination of the\nemployment should be given in writing to the employee when\nexercising the power of termination of services of the\nemployee under Standing Order 26. The Management is required\nto articulate the reason which operated in its mind for\nterminating the services of the employee. But merely because\nthe reason must obviously not be arbitrary. capricious or\nirrelevant, it would not necessarily in every case make the\norder of termination punitive in character so as to require\ncompliance with the requirements of clause (2) of Standing\nOrder 21 read with Standing Order 23. It was further held\nthat the service of the respondent was not satisfactory was\nundoubtedly based on past incidents set out in the record\nbut for each of these incidents punishment is one form or\nanother had already been meted out to her and it was not by\nway of punishment for any of these incidents, but because as\ngathered from these incidents, her record of service was\nunsatisfactory that her service was terminated by the man-\nagement under Standing Order 26. The appellant produced\nsatisfactory evidence to show that the impugned order termi-\nnating the service of the respondent was justified and hence\nthe impugned order must be sustained despite its having been\npassed without complying with the requirements of clause (2)\nof Standing Order 21 read with Standing Order 23. This\ndecision has been made in the special facts and circum-\nstances in that particular case.\n\n \nIn the case of \nManohar P. Kharkhar And Anr. v. Raghuraj\n& Anr.\n, [1981] 4 LLJ 459 the petitioners challenged the\norder of termination of services dated 29.4. 1981, under\n\nRegulation 48\n of Air India Employees' Service Regulations.\nThe petitioner No. 1 was The Director of Engineering and the\nHead of the Engineering Department while the petitioner No.\n2 was Deputy Director of Engineering (Maintenance) and the\nHead of the Maintenance Division of the Air India Corpora-\ntion. The Chairman and Managing Director of the said Corpo-\nration lost confidence in their ability and suitability to\nhold such important posts of Head of Departments which were\nreasonable for maintenance of the Air Crafts, safety of the\nAir Crafts and safety of the passengers carried therein and\nthe order of termination were based on the note of The\nChairman dated 29.4. 1981. Loss of confidence was the result\nof the negligence and failure to discharge their duty culmi-\nnating in the admitted sabotage in the case of Makalu, an\nair craft\n\n254\n\nfor the flight of VVIP. On this occasion the petitioners\nservices were terminated on April 29, 1981 by the Chairman\nwho recorded in its record the ground of loss of confidence.\nThis order was challenged as arbitrary and capricious and\n\nRegulation 48\n was violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitu-\ntion as it contained to guidelines for choosing between\nemployees and employees, occasion to occasion for the con-\ntemplated action.\n\n In negativing the contentions, it was held after exhaus-\ntively analysing the note dated 29.4.1981, that sheer un-\nsuitability and unfitness to hold office is not a misconduct\nin its generic sense or in its artificial meaning under\n\nRegulation 42\n. Regulations 42 to 44 have no application.\nConfidence in the petitioners' suitability was lost due to\nsuch overall inefficiency of the departments under the\npetitioners. Conclusions could not be different even if it\nassumed that the note contemplated finding of the petition-\ners guilty of gross inefficiency and negligence. Inefficien-\ncy by itself did not amount to misconduct in its generic\nsense.\n\n \nIt was further held that the petitioners have no right\nto the post and do not possess any security of tenure. It\nwas also held that if the Corporation choose to act under\n\nRegulation 48\n and the action is not mala fide, arbitrary or\ncapricious the question of its having acted in colourable\nexercise of its power could not arise. It was further held\nthat the power conferred under \nRegulation 48\n to terminate\nthe services of permanent employees on 30 days notice with-\nout assigning any reason is not violative of \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution. Accordingly the writ petition was dis-\nmissed and the rule was discharged. This decision however\nhas not duly considered the ratio of the decision made by\nthis Court in \nL. Michael & Anr. v. Johnaton Pumps India\nLtd.\n, [1975] 3 SCR 489 and also in the case of \nAir India\nCorporation v. V.A.

Desh\nBandhu Ghosh and Others\n, [1985] 3 SCC 116 the first respond-\nent, a permanent employee of the West Bengal State Electric-\nity Board, filed the writ petition out of which the appeal\narises in the Calcutta High Court to quash an order dated\nMarch 22, 1984 of the Secretary, West Bengal State Electric-\nity Board terminating his services as Deputy Secretary with\nimmediate effect on payment of three months' salary in lieu\nof three months' notice. The order was made under \nRegulation\n34\n of the Board's Regulations which enables the Board to\nterminate the services of any permanent employee 'by serving\nthree months' notice or on payment of salary for the corre-\nsponding period in lieu thereof.\" The \nRegulation 34\n reads as\nfollows:\n\n\"34. In case of a permanent employee, his services may be\nterminated by serving three months' notice or on payment of\nsalary for the corresponding period in lieu thereof.\"\n\n This order of termination was challenged on the ground\nthat \nRegulation 34\n was arbitrary in nature and it was pat-\nently discriminatory. The High Court struck down the first\nparagraph of \nRegulation 34\n and quashed the order of termina-\ntion of service of the first respondent.\n\n \nIn the case of \nWorkmen of Hindustan Steel Ltd. and Anr.\nv. Hindustan Steel Ltd. and Ors.\n, [1985] 2 SCR 428. Standing\nOrder 32 which provided for conferment of power in the\nGeneral Manager to terminate the services of an employee if\nsatisfied for reasons recorded in writing that it was inex-\npedient or against the order of security to employ the\nworkman, the workman could be removed or dismissed from\nservice without following the procedure \nlaid down in\n Stand-\ning Order 31.\n\n\"32. Special Procedure in certain cases.\n\nWhere a workman has been convicted for a criminal offence in\na Court of law or where the General Manager is satisfied,\nfor reasons to be recorded in writing, that it is inexpedi-\nent or against the interests of security to continue to\nemploy the workman, the workman may be removed or dismissed\nfrom service without following the procedure \nlaid down in\n\nStanding Order 31.\"\n\n The appellant, an Assistant in the 1st Respondent-under-\ntaking was removed from service on the ground that it was\n'no longer expe-\n\n256\n\ndient' to employ him. The management dispensed with the\ndepartmental enquiry, after looking into the secret report\nof one of their officers that the appellant had misbehaved\nwith the wife of an employee and that a complaint in respect\nthereof had been lodged with the police. The Tribunal held\nthat as the employer dispensed with the disciplinary enquiry\nin exercise of the power conferred by Standing Order 32, it\ncould not be said that the dismissal from service was not\njustified and the respondent was quite competent to dismiss\nhim from service without holding any enquiry.\n It was held that the reasons for dispensing with the\nenquiry do not spell out what was the nature of the miscon-\nduct alleged to have been committed by the appellant and\nwhat prompted the General Manager to dispense with the\nenquiry.\n\n As there was no justification for dispensing with the\nenquiry imposition of penalty of dismissal without the\ndisciplinary enquiry as contemplated by Standing Order 31 is\nillegal and invalid.\n\n It was further held that :-\"A Standing Order which\nconfers such arbitrary. uncanalised and drastic power to\ndismiss an employee by merely stating that it is inexpedient\nor against the interest of the security to continue to\nemploy the workman is violative of the basic requirement of\nnatural justice inasmuch as that the General Manager can\nimpose penalty of such a drastic nature as to affect the\nlivelihood and put a stigma on the character of the workman\nwithout recording reasons why disciplinary inquiry is dis-\npensed with and what was the misconduct alleged against the\nemployees. It is time for such a public sector undertaking\nas Hindustan Steel Ltd. to recast S.O. 32 and to bring it in\ntune with the philosophy of the Constitution failing which\nit being other authority and therefore a State under \nArt. 12\n\nin an appropriate proceeding, the vires of S.O. 32 will have\nto be examined. It is not necessary to do so in the present\ncase because even on the terms of S.O. 32, the order made by\nthe General Manager is unsustainable.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nTata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen &\nAnr.\n, (supra) the service of Mr. Banerjee, an employee of\nthe appellant, was terminated on the ground that the appel-\nlant had lost confidence in him and in lieu of notice he was\npaid one month's salary. The Union to which Mr. Banerjee\nbelonged took up his cause and on the failure of -'he par-\nties to reach a settlement the matter was referred to the\nIndustrial Tribunal by the Government. It was contended\nbefore the Tribunal by the appellant that the order of\ntermination of services of Mr.\n\n257\n\nBanerjee was an order of discharge which it was competent to\nmake under R. 40(1) of the Service Rules, whereas the re-\nspondent contended that the termination was not a discharge\nsimpliciter but was in substance dismissal and that the\nTribunal was entitled to consider the propriety of the\nappellant's action.\n\n The Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to look into\nthe reasons behind the discharge of an employee. On the\nexamination of the evidence the Tribunal found that no mala\nfides on the part of the employer had been proved and that\nthe termination of service did not amount to victimisation\nor unfair labour practice. Even so it held that the dis-\ncharge was not justified and directed the reinstatement of\nMr. Banerjee.\n\n This Court held that in the matter of an order of dis-\ncharge of an employee the form of the order is not decisive.\nAn Industrial Tribunal has jurisdiction to examine the\nsubstance of the matter and decide whether the termination\nis, in fact, discharge simpliciter or it amounts to dismiss-\nal which has put on the cloak of discharge simpliciter. The\ntest always has to be whether the act of the employer is\nbona fide or whether it is a mala fide and colourable exer-\ncise of the powers conferred by the terms of contract or by\nthe standing orders.\n\n \nIn \nO.P. Bhandari v. Indian Tourism Development Corpora-\n\ntion Ltd. and Others, [1986] 4 SCC 337. The question of\nconstitutionality of Rule 31(v) of the Indian Tourist Devel-\nopment Corporation Rules came up for consideration before\nthis Court in this case. Rule 31 is quoted below:\n\n\"31. Termination of services--The services of an employee\nmay be terminated by giving such notice or notice pay as may\nbe prescribed in the contract of service in the following\nmanner:\n\n(v) of an employee who has completed his probationary period\nand who has been confirmed or deemed to be confirmed by\ngiving him 90 days' notice or pay in lieu thereof.\"\n\nIt has been observed by this Court:\n\n\"This rule cannot co-exist with \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the\nConstitution of India. The said rule must therefore die, so\nthat the fundamental rights guaranteed by the aforesaid\n\n258\n\nconstitutional provisions remain alive. For otherwise. the\nguarantee enshrined in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitu-\ntion can be set at naught simply by framing a rule authoriz-\ning termination of an employee by merely giving a notice. In\norder of uphold the validity of the rule in question it will\nhave to be held that the tenure of service of a citizen who\ntakes up employment with the State will depend on the pleas-\nure or whim of the competent authority unguided by any\nprinciple or policy. And that the services of an employee\ncan be terminated though there is no rational ground for\ndoing so. even arbitrarily or capriciously. To uphold this\nright is to accord a \"magna carta\" to the authorities in-\nvested with these powers to practice uncontrolled discrimi-\nnation at their pleasure and caprice on considerations not\nnecessarily based on the welfare of the organisation but\npossibly based on personal likes and dislikes, personal\npreferences and prejudices. An employee may be retained\nsolely on the ground that he is asycophancy and indulges in\nflattery, whereas the services of one who is meritorious\n(but who is wanting in the art of sycophancy and tempermen-\ntally incapable of indulging in flattery) may be terminated.\n\nThe power may be exercised even on the unarticulated ground\nthat the former belongs to the same religious faith or is\nthe disciple of the same religious teacher or holds opinions\ncongenial to him. The power may be exercised depending on\nwhether or not the concerned employee belongs to the same\nregion. or to the same caste as that of the authority exer-\ncising the power, of course without saying so. Such power\nmay be exercised even in order to make way for another\nemployee who is favourite of the concerned authority. Pro-\nvincialism, casteism, nepotism, religious fanaticism, and\nseveral other obnoxious factors may \nin that case\n freely\noperate in the mind of the competent authority on deciding\nwhom to retain and whom to get rid of. And these dangers are\nnot imaginary ones. They are very much real in organisations\nwhere there is a confluence of employees streaming in from\ndifferent States. Such a rule is capable of robbing an\nemployee of his dignity, and making him a supine person\nwhose destiny is at the mercy of the concerned authority\n(whom he must humour) notwithstanding the constitutional\nguarantee enshrined in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitu-\ntion of India. To hold otherwise is to hold that the funda-\n\n259\n\nmental right embedded in \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n is a mere\npaper tiger and that is so ethereal that it can be nullified\nor eschewed by a simple device of framing a rule which\nauthorizes termination of the service of an employee by\nmerely giving a notice of termination. Under the circum-\nstances the rule in question must be held to be unconstitu-\ntional and void.\"\n\nThis decision followed the observations of this Court in\n\nCentral Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited And\nAnother v. Brojo Nath Gangtdy and Another\n and \nWest Bengal\nState Electricity Board v. Desh Bandhu Ghosh and Ors.,\n(Supra\n).\n\n \nIn \nCentral Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited\nand Another v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another\n, [1986] 3 SCC\n156 the appellant Corporation is a Government Company incor-\nporated under the \nCompanies Act\n. The Majority shares of the\nCorporation are held by the Union of India and the remaining\nshares are held by the State of West Bengal and Assam.\n\nArticle 47\n provided for appointment and reappointment of the\nauditors of the Corporation to be made by the Central Gov-\nernment on the advice of the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral\nof India and the nature of control to be exercised by the\nComptroller and Auditor-General in the matter of audit and\naccounts. \nArticle 51-A\n entitled the President to call for\nreturns, accounts etc. of the Corporation. The respondents\nin the two appeals were in the service of the said company.\nTheir appointment letters were in a stereotype form under\nwhich the Corporation could without any previous notice\nterminate their services. A Scheme of Arrangement was en-\ntered into between the Corporation and that company for\ndissolution of the latter and takeover of its business and\nliabilities by the former. The Scheme inter alia stipulated\nthat the Corporation shall take as many of the existing\nstaff or labour as possible and that those who could not be\ntaken over shall be paid by the concerned company all moneys\ndue to them under the law and all legitimate and legal\ncompensations payable to them either under Industrial Dis-\nputes Act or otherwise legally admissible and that such\nmoneys shall be provided by the Government of India to the\ntransferor Company who would pay these dues. The two re-\nspondents were in the service of the said company and their\nservices were taken over by the Corporation after the Scheme\nof Arrangement was sanctioned by the High Court. The re-\nspondent Ganguly was appointed as the Deputy Chief Accounts\nOfficer and was later promoted as Manager (Finance), the\nrespondent Sengupta was appointed as Chief Engineer (River\nServices) and was\n\n260\n\nlater promoted as General Manager (River Services).\n Rule 9(i) of the Corporation's Service, Discipline and\nAppeal Rules of 1979 provided that the services of a perma-\nnent employee could be terminated on three months' notice on\neither side or on payment of three months' pay plus DA to\nthe employee or on deduction of a like amount from his\nsalary as the case may be in lieu of the notice. A notice\nunder Rule 9(i) was served on him terminating his services\nwith immediate effect by paying three months' pay. Both\nGanguly and Sengupta filed writ petition before High Court\nand a Division Bench of that Court allowed the same.\n The Corporation filed appeals before Supreme Court. The\nimpugned questions for determination were (i) whether the\nappellant Corporation was an instrumentality of the State so\nas to be covered by \nArticles 12\n and \n36\n of the Constitution\nand (ii) whether an unconscionable term in a contract of\nemployment entered into with the Corporation was void under\n\nSection 23\n of the Contract Act and violative of \nArticle 14\n\nand as such whether Rule 9(i) which formed a part of the\ncontract of employment between the Corporation and its\nemployees to whom the said Rules applied, was void? This\nCourt held that it being a Government Company within the\nmeaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution has to comply with\nthe rights embodied in Part III of the Constitution and the\nDirective Principles in Part IV of the Constitution. It was\nfurther held that by extending the executive power of the\nUnion and each of the States to the carrying on any trade or\nbusiness. \nArticle 298\n does not convert either the Union of\nIndia or any of the States which collectively form the Union\ninto a merchant buying and selling goods or carrying on\neither trading or business activity, for the executive power\nof the Union and the States, whether in the field of trade\nor business or in any other field, is always subject to\nconstitutional limitations and particularly the provisions\nrelating to Fundamental Rights in Part III and is exercisa-\nble in accordance with and for the furtherance of the Direc-\ntive Principles of State Policy.\n\n Rule 9(i) can aptly be called the 'Henry VIII Clause'.\nIt confers an absolute. arbitrary and unguided power upon\nthe Corporation. It does not even state who on behalf of the\nCorporation is to exercise that power. While the Rules\nprovide for four different modes in which the services of a\npermanent employee can be terminated earlier than his at-\ntaining the age of superannuation, namely, Rules 9(i),\n9(ii). 36(iv)(b) read with Rules 38 and 37. Rule 9(i) is the\nonly rule which does not state in what circumstances the\npower conferred by the rule is\n\n261\n\nto be exercised. Thus even where the Corporation could\nproceed under Rule 36 and dismiss an employee on the ground\nof misconduct after holding a regular disciplinary inquiry,\nit is free to resort instead to Rule 9(i) in order to avoid\nthe hassle of an inquiry. No opportunity of a hearing is at\nall to be afforded to the permanent employee whose service\nis being terminated in the exercise of this power. It thus\nviolates audi alteram partent rule of natural justice also\nwhich is implicit in \nArticle 14.\n It is not covered by any of\nthe situations which would justify the total exclusion of\nthe audi alteram partem rule. The view that the Board of\nDirectors would not exercise this power arbitrarily or\ncapriciously as it consists of responsible and highly placed\npersons ignores the fact that however highly placed a person\nmay be he must necessarily possess human frailties and\n\"power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts abso-\nlutely.\"\n\n Rule 9(i)is also discriminatory for it enables the\nCorporation to discriminate between employee and employee.\nIt can pick up one employee and apply to him Rule 9(i). It\ncan pick up another employee and apply to him Rule 9(ii). It\ncan pick up yet another employee and apply to him Rule\n36(iv)(b) read with Rule 38 and to yet another employee it\ncan apply Rule 37. All this the Corporation can do when the\nsame circumstances exist as would justify the Corporation in\nholding under Rule 38 a regular disciplinary inquiry into\nthe alleged misconduct of the employee.\n\n \nThis court in \nDelhi Transport Undertaking v. Balbir\nSaran Goel\n, [1970] 3 SCR 757 considered the question whether\nthe services of a permanent employee under Delhi Transport\nUndertaking could be terminated under \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the\nRegulation without complying with the procedure prescribed\nby \nRegulation 15\n and (ii) whether although the order was\nmade in perfectly harmless and innocuous terms purporting to\nbe within \nRegulation 9(b)\n it was a mere camouflage for\ninflicting punishment for breach of Standing Order 17. as\nthe respondent approached the High Court without exhausting\nthe Departmental remedies and held that the order was not\nproved to be made mala tide on the part of the authority\nterminating the service nor the question of mala fide was\ngone into by the Courts below.\n\n \nRegulation 9(b)\n empowered the authorities to terminate\nthe service after giving one month's notice or pay in lieu\nthereof. The order was held to have been made unequivocally\nin terms of the \nRegulation 9(h)\n as the employee was a con-\ntankerous person and it was desirable to retain him in\nservice. The order was upheld. The question\n\n262\n\nwhether \nRegulation 9(b)\n was illegal and void as it conferred\narbitrary and uncanalised power to terminate the service of\na permanent employee without recording any reason and with-\nout giving any opportunity of hearing before passing the\npurported order as required under \nArticle 14\n of the Consti-\ntution was neither raised nor considered in this case.\n \nIn L. Michael & Anr. v. M/s \nJohnston Pumps India Ltd.\n,\n(supra) the services of the appellant, an employee of the\nrespondent, were terminated by the latter giving him one\nmonth's notice as per. the standing orders without assigning\nany reasons for the termination. An industrial dispute was\nreferred to the Labour Court. The management alleged that\nthe employee misused his position by passing an important\nand secret information about affairs of the company to\ncertain outsiders, that even after he was transferred to\nanother section he made attempts to elicit information from\nthe section with a view to pass it on to outsiders, and that\ntherefore, the management lost confidence in the employee\nand terminated his services by a bona fide order. The Labour\nCourt confirmed the order.\n\n On appeal this Court set aside the order holding that\nthe Labour Court has misled itself on the law. This Court\ndirected reinstatement of the employee with all back wages.\n The manner of dressing up an order does not matter. The\nCourt will lift the veil to view the reality or substance of\nthe order.\n\n The Tribunal has the power and indeed the duty to X-ray\nthe order and discover its true nature, if the object and\neffect, if the attendant circumstances and the ulterior\npurpose be to dismiss the employee because he is an evil to\nbe eliminated. But if the management, to cover up the ina-\nbility to establish by an inquiry, illegitimately but inge-\nniously passes an innocent looking order of termination\nsimpliciter, such action is bad and is liable to be set\naside. Loss of confidence is no new armour for the manage-\nment; otherwise security of tenure, ensured by the new\nindustrial jurisprudence and authenticated by a catend of\ncases of this Court can be subverted by this neo formula\nLoss of Confidence in the law will be the consequence of the\nLoss of Confidence doctrine.\n\n An employer who believes and suspects that his employee\nparticularly one holding a position of confidence, has\nbetrayed that confidence, can, if the conditions and terms\nof employment permit\n\n263\n\nterminate his employment and discharge him without any\nstigma attaching to the discharge. But such belief or suspi-\ncion or' the employer should not be a mere whim or fancy. It\nshould be bona fide and reasonable. It must rest on some\ntangible basis and the power has to be exercised by the\nemployer objectively', in good faith. which means honestly\nand with due care and prudence. If the exercise of such\npower is challenged on the ground of being colourable or\nmala fide or an act of victimisation or unfair labour prac-\ntice. the employer must disclose to the Court the grounds of\nhis impugned action so that the same may be tested judicial-\nly.\n\n \nThis Court in the case of workmen of Hindustan Steel\nLtd. and Ant. v. \nHindustan Steel Ltd. and Ors.\n, (supra)\nwhile considering the constitutionality of Standing Order 32\nof the Hindustan Steel Ltd. which conferred power on the\nGeneral Manager to remove or dismiss a workman without\nfollowing the procedure for holding a disciplinary enquiry\n\nlaid down in\n Standing Order 31 observed that:\n\n\"It is time for such a public sector undertaking as Hindu-\nstan Steel Ltd. to recast S.O. 32 and to bring it in tune\nwith the philosophy of the Constitution failing which it\nbeing other authority and therefore a State under \nArticle 12\n\nin an appropriate proceeding, the views of S.O. 32 will have\nto be examined.\"\n\n It is convenient to refer in this context relevant\npassage in paragraph 4 in Chitty on Contracts, 25th Edition,\nVolume 1:\n\n\"These ideas have to a large extent lost their appeal today.\n'Freedom of contract', it has been said, 'is a reasonable\nsocial ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining\npower between contracting parties can be assumed, and no\ninjury is done to the economic interest of the community at\nlarge.' Freedom of contract is of little value when one\nparty has no alternative between accepting a set of terms\nproposed by the other or doing without the goods or services\noffered. Many contracts entered into by public utility\nundertakings and others take the form of a set of terms\nfixed in advance by one party and not open to discussion by\nthe other. These are called 'contracts d'adhesion' by French\nlawyers. Traders frequently contract, not on individually\nnegotiated terms, but on those contained in a standard form\nof contract settled by a trade association. And the\n\n264\n\nterms of an employee's contract of employment may be deter-\nmined by agreement between his trade union and his employer,\nor by a statutory scheme of employment. Such transactions\nare nevertheless contracts notwithstanding that freedom of\ncontract is to a great extent lacking.\"\n\n This Court has observed in Central Inland Water Trans-\nport Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and\nAnr.. (supra)as under:\n\n .... \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution guarantees to\nall persons equality before the law and the equal protection\nof the laws. The principle deducible from the above discus-\nsions on this part of the case is in consonance with right\nand reason, intended to secure social and economic justice\nand conforms to the mandate of the great equality clause in\n\nArticle 14.\n This principle is that the courts will not\nenforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike down an\nunfair and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreason-\nable clause in a contract. entered into between parties who\narc not equal in bargaining power ..... It will apply to\nsituations in which the weaker party is in a position in\nwhich he can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood\nonly upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go\nwithout them.\"\n\n The Court has. therefore, the jurisdiction and power to\nstrike or set aside the unfavourable terms in a contract of\nemployment which purports to give effect to unconscienable\nbargain violating \nArt. 14\n of the Constitution\n Thus on a conspectus of the catena of cases decided by\nthis Court the only conclusion follows is that \nRegulation\n9(b)\n which confers powers on the authority to terminate the\nservices of a permanent and confirmed employee by issuing a\nnotice terminating the services or by making payment in lieu\nof notice without assigning any reasons in the order and\nwithout giving any opportunity of hearing to the employee\nbefore passing the impugned order is wholly arbitrary,\nuncanalised and unrestricted violating principles of natural\njustice as well as \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. It has\nalso been held consistently by this Court that the Govern-\nment carries on various trades and business activity through\nthe instrumentality of the State such as Government Company\nor Public Corporations. Such Government Company or\n\n265\n\nPublic Corporation being State 'instrumentalities are State\nwithin the meaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution and as\nsuch they are subject to the observance of fundamental\nrights embodied in Part III as well as to conform to the\ndirective principles in Part IV of the Constitution. In\nother words the Service Regulations or Rules framed by them\nare to be tested by the touchstone of \nArticle 14\n of Consti-\ntution. Furthermore, the procedure prescribed by their Rules\nor Regulations must be reasonable, fair and just and not\narbitrary, fanciful and unjust. \nRegulation 9(b)\n, therefore,\nconfers unbridled, uncanalised and arbitrary power on the\nauthority to terminate the services of a permanent employee\nwithout recording any reasons and without conforming to the\nprinciples of natural justice. There is no guideline in the\nRegulations or in the Act, as to when or in which cases and\ncircumstances this power of termination by giving notice or\npay in lieu of notice can be exercised. It is now well\nsettled that the 'audi alteram partem' rule which is es-\nsence, enforces the equality clause in \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution is applicable not only to quasi-judicial orders\nbut to administrative orders affecting prejudicially the\nparty-in-question unless the application of the rule has\nbeen expressly excluded by the Act or Regulation or Rule\nwhich is not the case here. Rules of natural justice do not\nsupplant but supplement the Rules and Regulations. Moreover,\nthe Rule of Law which permeates our Constitution demands\nthat it has to be observed both substantially and procedure-\nly. Considering from all aspects \nRegulation 9(b)\n is illegal\nand void as it is arbitrary, discriminatory and without any\nguidelines for exercise of the power. Rule of law posits\nthat the power to be exercised in a manner which is just,\nfair and reasonable and not in an unreasonable, capricious\nor arbitrary manner leaving room for discrimination. Regula-\ntion 9(b) does not expressly exclude the application of the\n'audi alteram partern' rule and as such the order of termi-\nnation of service of a permanent employee cannot be passed\nby simply issuing a month's notice under \nRegulation 9(b)\n or\npay in lieu thereof without recording any reason in the\norder and without giving any hearing to the employee to\ncontrovert the allegation on the basis of which the purport-\ned order is made.\n\n \nIt will be profitable to refer in this connection the\nobservations of this Court in the case of \nUnion of India and\nAnr. v. Tulsiram Patel and Ors.\n, [1985] Supp. (2) SCR 131\nwhere the constitutionality of provisions of \nArt. 311\n par-\nticularly the 2nd proviso to clause (2) of 'the said Article\ncame up for consideration.\n \nThis Court referred to the find-\nings in \nRoshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India\n, [1968] 1 SCR\n185 wherein it was held that though the origin of a Govern-\n\nment service is contractual\n\n266\n\nyet when once appointed to his post or office, the Govern-\nment servant acquires a status and his rights and obliga-\ntions are no longer determined by the consent of both the\nparties, but by statute or statutory rules which may be\nframed and altered unilaterally by the Government. In other\nwords, the legal position of a Government servant is more\none of status than of contract. The hall-work of status is\nthe attachment to a legal relationship of rights and duties\nimposed by the public law and not by mere agreement of the\nparties. It has been observed that \nArt. 14\n does not govern\nor control \nArt. 311.\n The Constitution must be read as a\nwhole. \nArt. 311(2)\n embodies the principles of natural jus-\ntice including audi alteram partem rule. Once the applica-\ntion of clause (2) is expressly excluded by the Constitution\nitself, there can be no question of making applicable what\nhas been so excluded by seeking recourse to \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution.\n\n In the case of Sukdev Singh & Ors. v. Bhagatrarn Sardar\nSingh Raghuvanshi & Anr. (supra), Mathew, J. pointed out\nthat:\n\n \"The governing power wherever located must be\nsubject to the fundamental constitutional limitations.\"\n\n \nThis has been referred to and relied upon in \nCentral\nInland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Brojo\nNath Ganguly and Anr.\n (supra) and a similar Rule 9(i) was\ntermed as \"Henry VIII clause\" as it confers arbitrary and\nabsolute power upon the Corporation to terminate the service\nof a permanent employee by simply issuing a notice or pay in\nlieu thereof without recording any reason in the order and\nwithout giving any opportunity of hearting to the employee.\nThus, the Rule 9(i) of the Services Discipline and Appeal\nRules, 1979 was held void under \nSection 23\n of the Indian\nContract Act, 1872, as being opposed to public policy and is\nalso ultra vires of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution to the\nextent that it confers upon the Corporation the right to\nterminate the employment of a permanent employee by giving\nhim three months' notice in writing or by paying him the\nequivalent of three months' basic pay and dearness allowance\nin lieu of such notice.\n\n \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the impugned Regulation framed under\nthe Delhi Transport Corporation Act which is in pare materia\nwith the said Rule 9(i) is void under \nSection 23\n of the\nContract Act as being opposed to public policy and is also\nultra vires of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n Another crucial question is to consider how far the\nimpugned provisions of \nRegulation 9(b)\n framed under the\nDelhi Road Transport\n\n267\n\nAct can be read down in order to save it from unconstitu-\ntionality. Several decisions have been cited at the bar in\norder to impress upon the Court that the impugned provisions\nhave been made for public purposes and for public interest\nand as such it should be read down in a manner that will\nsave the said provisions from the on-slaught of constitu-\ntional invalidity.\n\n In the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pra-\ndesh, Indore and Ors. v. Radhakrishnan and Ors., [1979] 2\nSCC 249 it has been held by this Court that for sustaining\nthe presumption of constitutionality, the court may take\ninto consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of\ncommon report, the history of the times and may assume every\nstate of facts which can be conceived and can even read down\nthis section.\n\n It is convenient to mention here the meaning and scope\nof the word 'reading down' and 'Severance' dealt with on\npage 7, para B in Australian Federal Constitutional Law by\nColin Howard which reads as follows:\n\n\"The High Court presumes the validity of legislation to the\nextent that it will not of its own motion raise questions of\nconstitutionality. Legislation is treated as valid unless\nthe parties to litigation challenge it on constitutional\ngrounds. The techniques of construction known as reading\ndown and severance are corollaries of this presumption.\n Reading down puts into operation the principle\nthat so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, legisla-\ntion should be construed as being within power. It has the\npractical effect that where an Act is expressed in language\nof a generality which makes it capable, if read literally,\nof applying to matters beyond the relevant legislative\npower, the court will construe it in a more limited sense so\nas to keep it within power.\n\nXX XX XX\nXX XX XX\n\nIt does not necessarily follow that because a statute cannot\nbe read down it is wholly invalid. The presumption of valid-\nity leads naturally to the view that where a statute cannot\nbe held wholly valid it should be held valid at least to the\n\n268\n\nextent that it is reasonably possible or practicable to do\nso. Where reading down is not available the court next\ndecides where there is a case for severing the invalid parts\nof the statute from the parts which, standing alone, are\nvalid. If this can be done the court declares only the\ninvalid parts to be beyond power and leaves the remainder\noperative.\n\n \nIn Re The Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937\n,\nand \nThe Hindu Women's Rights to Property (Amendment) Act,\n1938\n and in Re a Special Reference under \nSection 2\n \n13\n of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1935, [1941] FCR 12 the question\narose whether the \nHindu Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937\n\n(Central Act XVIII of 1937) and the \nHindu Women's Rights to\nProperty (Amendment) Act, 1938\n (Central Act XI of 1938), are\napplicable to agricultural land and what was the meaning of\nthe word 'property'. It was observed that:\n\n\"When a Legislature with limited and restricted powers makes\nuse in an Act of a word of such wide and general import as\n\"property\", the presumption must be that it is using it with\nreference to that kind of property with respect to which it\nis competent to legislate and to no other. The word \"proper-\nty\" in the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act must accord-\ningly be construed as referring to property other than\nagricultural land.\n\n There is a general presumption that a Legislature\ndoes not intend to exceed its jurisdiction.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nR.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of\nIndia\n, [1957] SCR 930 the petitioners who had been promoting\nand conducting prize competitions in the different States of\nIndia, challenged the constitutionality of\n ss. 4\n and \n5\n of\nthe Prize Competitions Act (42 of 1955) and rr. 11 and 12\nframed under s. 20 of the Act on the grounds that prize\ncompetition as defined in\n s. 2(d)\n of the Act included not\nmerely competitions that were of a gambling nature but also\nthose in which success depended to a substantial degree on\nskill and the sections and the rules violated their funda-\nmental right to carry on business, and were unsupportable\nunder Act. 19(6) of the Constitution, that they constituted\na single inseverable enactment and, consequently. must fail\nentirely. It was held that validity of the restrictions\nimposed by\n ss. 4\n and \n5\n and rr 11 and 12 of the Act as re-\ngards gambling competitions was no longer open to challenge\nunder \nArt. 19(6)\n of the Constitution in view of the decision\nof this Court that gambling did not\n\n269\n\nfall within the purview of \nArt. 19(1)(g)\n of the Constitu-\ntion.\n\nIt has been further observed that:\n\n\"When a question arises as to the interpretation to be put\non an enactment, what the Court has to do is to ascertain\n\"the intent of them that make it\" and that must of course.\nbe gathered from the words actually used in the\nstatute. ............ To arrive at the real meaning, it is\nalways necessary to get an exact conception of the aim,\nscope and object of the whole Act .......... To decide the\ntrue scope of the present Act, therefore, we must have\nregard to all such factors as can legitimately be taken into\naccount in ascertaining the intention of the legislature,\nsuch as the history of the legislation and the purposes\nthereof, the mischief which it intended to suppress and the\nother provisions of the statute, and construe the language\nof s. 2(d) in the light of the indications furnished by\nthem.\"\n\n Having regard to the circumstances, it was held that the\nlaw which the State Legislatures moved Parliament to enact\nunder \nArt. 252(1)\n was one to control and regulate prize\ncompetitions of a gambling character and as such it was held\nthat the Act was valid It has been further observed that\nwhere the legislation falls in part within the area allotted\nto it and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to\nthe latter.\n\n \nIn the case of R. 1. \nArora v. State of Uttar Pradesh and\nOrs.\n, [1964] 6 SCR 784 challenge was thrown to the constitu-\ntionality of the amendments made to Ss. 40, 41 and\n s. 7\n by\nthe \nLand Acquisition Amendment Act\n (Act 31 of 1962) on the\nground that it contravened \nArt. 31(2)\n inasmuch as it makes\nacquisition for a company before July 20, 1962 as being for\na public purpose even though it may not be so in fact.\n\nSection 7\n was also challenged on the ground that it contra-\nvenes \nArt. 14\n inasmuch as it makes an unreasonable discrimi-\nnation in the matter of acquisition for a company before\nJuly 20, 1962 and after that date insolaf as the former\nacquisitions are validated on the basis of their being\ndeemed to be for a public purpose while the latter acquisi-\ntions are not so deemed and have to satisfy the test of\npublic purpose.\n\n \nit has been held that if the language of a provision of\nlaw is capable of only one construction and if according to\nthat construction\n\n270\n\nthe provision contravenes a constitutional provision it must\nbe struck down. A literal interpretation is not always the\nonly interpretation of a provision in a statute and the\ncourt has to look at the setting in which the words are used\nand the circumstances in which the law came to be passed to\ndecide whether there is something implicit behind the words\nactually used which would control the literal meaning of the\nwords used. It has been further held following the observa-\ntions in \nThe Mysore State Electricity Board v. Bangalore\nWoollen, Cotton and Silk Mills Ltd. & Ors.\n, [1963] Supp. 2\nSCR 127 that it is well settled that if certain provisions\nof law construed in one way will be consistent with the\nConstitution and if another interpretation would render them\nunconstitutional the court would bear in favour of the\nformer construction.\n\n In the case of Jagdish Pandey v. The Chancellor Univer-\nsity of Bihar & Anr., [1968] 1 SCR 23 1 the challenge was to\nthe constitutionality of s. 4 of Bihar State Universities\n(University of Bihar, Bhagalpur and Ranchi) (Amendment) Act\n13 of 1962 as discriminatory and violative of \nArt. 14\n of the\nConstitution. It has been urged that\n s. 4\n confers uncana-\nlised powers on the Chancellor without indicating any crite-\nrion on the basis of which the power under\n s. 4\n can be\nexercised. It has been observed that:\n\n\" ...... There is no doubt that if one reads\n s. 4\n literal-\nly it does appear to give uncanalised powers to the Chancel-\nlor to do what he likes on the recommendations of the Com-\nmission with respect to teachers covered by it. We do not\nhowever think that the Legislature intended to give such an\narbitrary power to the Chancellor. We are of opinion that\n s.\n4\n must be read down and if we read it down there is no\nreason to hold that the legislature was conferring a naked\narbitrary power on the Chancellor.\"\n\n Seervai in his book 'Constitutional Law of India', Third\nEdition has stated at p. 119 that:\n\n\" .... the Court are guided by the following rules in\ndischarging their solemn duty to declare laws passed by a\nlegislature unconstitutional:\n\n(1) There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality\nand a law will not be declared unconstitutional unless the\ncase is so clear as to be free from doubt; \"to doubt the\n\n271\n\nconstitutionality of a law is to resolve it in favour of its\nvalidity.\"\n\n .............................................\n .............................................\n(6) A Statute cannot be declared unconstitutional merely\nbecause in the opinion of the Court it violates one or more\nof the principles of liberty, or the spirit of the Constitu-\ntion, unless such principles and that spirit are found in\nthe terms of the Constitution.\"\n\n On a proper consideration of the cases cited hereinbe-\nfore as well as the observations of Seervai in his book\n'Constitutional Law of India' and also the meaning that has\nbeen given in the Australian Federal Constitutional Law by\nCoin Howard, it is clear and apparent that where any term\nhas been used in the Act which per se seems to be without\njurisdiction but can be read down in order to make it con-\nstitutionally valid by separating and excluding the part\nwhich is invalid or by interpretting the word in such a\nfashion in order to make it constitutionally valid and\nwithin jurisdiction of the legislature which passed the said\nenactment by reading down the provisions of the Act. This,\nhowever, does not under any cicumstances mean that where the\nplain and literal meaning that follows from a bare reading\nof the provisions of the Act, Rule or Regulation that it\nconfers arbitrary, uncanlised, unbridled, unrestricted power\nto terminate the services of a permanent employee without\nrecording any reasons for the same and without adhering to\nthe principles of natural justice and equality before the\nlaw as envisaged in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution, cannot\nbe read down to save the said provision from constitutional\ninvalidity by bringing or adding words in the said legisla-\ntion such as saying that it implies that reasons for the\norder of termination have to be recorded. In interpreting\nthe provisions of an Act, it is not permissible where the\nplain language of the provision gives a clear and unambigu-\nous meaning can be interpreted by reading down and presuming\ncertain expressions in order to save it from constitutional\ninvalidity. Therefore, on a consideration of the above\ndecisions, it is impossible to hold by reading down the\nimpugned provisions of \nRegulation 9(b)\n framed under\n s. 53\n of\nthe Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950 read with Delhi Road\nTransport (Amendment) Act, 1971 that the said provision does\nnot confer arbitrary, unguided, unrestricted and uncanalised\npower without any guidelines on the authority to terminate\nthe services of an employee without conforming to the prin-\nciples of natural justice and equality as\n\n272\n\nenvisaged in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. I am,\ntherefore, constrained to uphold the judgment of the Delhi\nHigh Court in C.W.P. No. 1422 of 1985 and dismiss Civil\nAppeal No. 2876 of 1986. I allow Civil Appeal No.1115 of\n1976 and agree with the order proposed to be passed thereon\nby the learned Chief Justice. The other appeals as referred\nto in detail in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice be\nplaced before the Division Bench of this Court to be dis-\nposed of in accordance with the observations made herein. I\nagree with conclusion arrived of by my learned brother K.\nRamaswamy, J.\n\n SHARMA.J. I have gone through the judgments prepared by\nthe learned Chief Justice and by my other learned Brothers.\nIn view 01 the elaborate consideration by them of the ques-\ntions raised by the parties, from both points of view. I\nproceed to indicate my conclusions without further discus-\nsion.\n\n I agree with the learned Chief Justice that the rights\nof the parties in the present cases cannot be governed by\nthe general principle of master and servant, and the manage-\nment cannot have unrestricted and unqualified power of\nterminating the services of the employees. In the interest\nof efficiency of the public bodies, however. they should\nhave the authority to terminate the employment of undesira-\nble, inefficient, corrupt. indolent and disobedient employ-\nees. but it must be exercised fairly, objectively and inde-\npendently: and the occasion for the exercise must be delim-\nited with precision and clarity. Further, there should be\nadequate reason for the use of such a power. and a decision\nin this regard has to be taken in a manner which should show\nfairness. avoid arbitrariness and evoke credibility. And\nthis. in my view, is possible only when the law lays down\ndetailed guidelines in unambiguous and precise terms so as\nto avoid the danger of misinterpretation of the situation.\nAn element of uncertainty is likely to lead to grave and\nundesirable consequences. Clarity and precision are. there-\nfore. essential for the guidelines. Examining in this back-\nground, I am of the view that \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Delhi\nRoad Transport Authority (Condition of Appointment and\nService) Regulation, 1952 cannot be upheld for lack of\nadequate and appropriate guidelines. For these reasons Civil\nAppeal No. 2876 of 1986 is dismissed.\n\n I also agree that the Civil Appeal No. 1115/76 should be\nallowed in the terms indicated in the judgment of the\nlearned Chief Justice. The other cases shall be placed\nbefore a division bench for final disposal.\n\n273\n\n SAWANT..J. I had the advantage of reading the judg-\nments of the learned Chief Justice and B.C. Ray and K.\nRamaswamy, JJ. While with respect I agree with the conclu-\nsion of the learned Chief Justice in Civil Appeal No.\n1115/76, with utmost respect to him, I am unable to share\nhis view of law on the subject in Civil Appeal No. 2876/86.\nI am in respectful agreement with the view on the point\nexpressed by Ray and Ramaswamy, JJ. in the said Civil Ap-\npeal. I give my separate reasons for the same.\n The only question involved in all these matters is\nwhether the absolute power given to the Management of the\npublic undertakings under their respective rules/regulations\nto terminate the services of an employee without assigning\nany reason, is constitutionally valid.\n\n 2. It is not necessary to refer to the facts and service\nrules in each case. It will be sufficient if I reproduce\nhereinbelow the relevant service regulation of one of the\npublic undertakings, viz., Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC'\nfor short) the validity of which is in question in the\npresent case. The said regulation being \nRegulation 9(b)\n of\nthe Delhi Road Transport Authority (Conditions of Appoint-\nment & Service) Regulations, 1952 (hereinafter referred to\nas the \"Regulations\") reads as follows:\n\n Termination of service: (a) Except as otherwise\nspecified in the appointment orders, the services of an\nemployee of the Authority may be terminated without any\nnotice or pay in lieu of notice:\n\n(i) During the period of probation and without assigning any\nreasons thereof,\n\n(ii) For misconduct,\n(;,ii) On the completion of specific period of appointment,\n\n(iv) In the case of employees engaged on contract for a\nspecific period, on the expiration of such period in accord-\nance with the terms of appointment.\n\n (b) Where the termination is made due to reduc-\n\ntion of establishment or in circumstances other than those\nmentioned at (a) above, one month's notice or pay in lieu\n\n274\n\nthereof will be given to all categories of employees.\n\n (c) Where a regular/temporary employee wishes to\nresign from his post under the Authority he shall given\nthree/one month's notice in writing or pay in lieu thereof\nto the Authority provided that in special cases, the General\nManager may relax, at his discretion, the condition regard-\ning the period of notice of resignation or pay in lieu\nthereof.\"\n\n It will be obvious from the provisions of clause (b) the\nabove that it applies not only in the case of retrenchment\nof employees on account of reduction in the establishment\nbut also in circumstances other than those mentioned in\nclause (a). The circumstances mentioned in clause (a) are\n\n(i) probationary period, (ii) misconduct, (iii) completion\nof specific period of appointment and (iv) expiration of\ncontractual period of appointment when the appointment is\ncontractual. In other words, when the management decides to\nterminate the services of an employee but not for his mis-\nconduct 'or during his probation or because his tenure of\nappointment, contractual or otherwise, has come to an end,\nit is free to do so without assigning any reason and by\nmerely giving either a notice of the specific period or pay\nin lieu of such notice. Reduced to simple non-technical\nlanguage, clause (b) contains the much hated and abused rule\nof hire and fire reminiscent of the days of laissez faire\nand unrestrained freedom of contract. There is no dispute\nthat although the language differs, the substance of the\nrelevant rules of the other public undertakings which are\nbefore us, is the same and hence what applies to \nRegulation\n9(b)\n of the Regulations will apply equally to the relevant\nrules of the other undertakings as well.\n\n 3. The contentions advanced before us on behalf of the\nmanagements of the undertakings acknowledge at the very\noutset that such a service rule without anything further was\nnot only ultra vires the Constitution but was indefensible\nin law even otherwise being opposed to the principles of\nnatural justice vesting as it does the naked arbitrary power\nin the management. The contention, however, was that the\nrule had to be read down to imply that the power vested by\nit could be exercised only in certain circumstances and for\nvalid reasons and not otherwise. It was further contended\nthat the rigour of the rule is mitigated because the power\ngranted by it is exercised by a high ranking officer. It was\nalso urged that the exercise of the said power can be con-\ntrolled by holding that it is open to scrutiny by the court,\nin individual cases. In other words, the contention was that\nthe rule by itself\n\n275\n\nis innocent and legal and its movements are properly con-\ntrolled being under elderly care. Its occasional wayward\nbehaviour in unguarded moments can be corrected by chastise-\nment by the courts. But the rule, it was solemnly urged, was\nnecessary since otherwise the management of the undertakings\nwill be well-high impossible. The controversy before us thus\nlies in a narrow compass, viz., whether the rule whatever\nits admitted demerits, should continue to blot the statute\nbook because it is necessary and will be used in certain\ncircumstances only and its use in any other circumstances\ncan be checked by the Court.\n\n 4. It can at once be discerned that at the bottom of all\nthe lengthy ardent arguments lies an anxiety not to specify\nthe circumstances under which the power given by the rule\nwill be exercised on the spacious plea that such circum-\nstances cannot be stated in advance and in the interests of\nthe administration of the undertakings it is best that they\nare not so stated. For once I thought that the framers of\nour Constitution had committed an irretrievable mistake by\nignoring the interests of the Union and the State Govern-\nments and enumerating such circumstances in the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n of the Constitution. But then I\nwas mistaken. The interests of the public undertakings\nappear to be more important than those of the Governments.\nMay be they are super-Governments. By claiming the privilege\nnot to enumerate even the broad guidelines as contained in\n\nArticle 311(2)\n, the managements of the undertakings are\nindeed wearing a supercrown. The posture adopted by them is\nall the more obdurate and untenable in law when they ask the\ncourt to read down the rule, and read in it circumstances\nunder which the power can be used, but maintain that they\nwill under no circumstances mend it nor should they be asked\nto do it, by incorporating in it those very circumstances.\n\n 5. With this prologue to the controversy, I may now\nexamine the contentions advanced before us. It is contended\nthat it is necessary to retain the rule in its present\nambiguous form because it is not possible to envisage in\nadvance all the circumstances which may arise necessitating\nits use. When we asked the learned counsel for the manage-\nments whether there were any circumstances which would not\nbe governed by the broad guidelines given in the second\nproviso to subclause (2) of \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution,\nand why at least such intelligible guidelines should not be\nincorporated in the rule, we received no reply. We could\nappreciate the embarrassment of the counsel, and as stated\nearlier. there lies the nub of the matter. What this Court\nin the various decisions has struck down is a similar rule\nin its present naked form without any guideline whatsoever,\nbroad or\n\n276\n\notherwise. It was never the argument on behalf of the em-\nployees nor indeed is it to-day before us that all the\npossible circumstances in which the rule may be used should\nbe enumerated in it. Their argument has been that at least\nthe broad circumstances under which its exercise may become\nnecessary should be incorporated to avoid an arbitrary use\nor rather the abuse of power, and to guarantee the security\nof employment. That argument has been accepted by this Court\nin the past by holding that such a rule is violative of the\nConstitution and was not necessary to safeguard the inter-\nests of the undertakings or the interests of the public. The\ndecisions which appear to take an inconsistent view show on\nclose analysis that either they were not dealing with the\nvalidity of the rule or were rendered when the dimensions of\nboth \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n were not expanded as they have been\nsubsequently.\n\n 6. In the year 1990, it is not necessary for me to\ndiscuss in detail the authorities which have widened the\nhorizons of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. Some of these\nprecedents are directly on the point in as much as the\nvalidity of similar service rules was considered there. It\nis enough if I summarise the position of law as it obtains\nto-day.\n\n There is need to minimise the scope of the arbitrary use\nof power in all walks of life. It is inadvisable to depend\non the good sense of the individuals, however high-placed\nthey may be. It is all the more improper and undesirable to\nexpose the precious rights like the rights of life, liberty\nand property to the vagaries of the individual whims and\nfancies. It is trite to say that individuals are not and do\nnot become wise because they occupy high seats of power, and\ngood sense, circumspection and fairness does not go with the\nposts, however high they may be. There is only a complaisant\npresumption that those who occupy high posts have a high\nsense of responsibility. The presumption is neither legal\nnor rational. History does not support it and reality does\nnot warrant it. In particular, in a society pledged to\nuphold the rule of law, it would be both unwise and impoli-\ntic to leave any aspect of its life to be governed by dis-\ncretion when it can conveniently and easily be covered by\nthe rule of law.\n\n The employment under the public undertakings is a public\nemployment and a public property. It is not only the under-\ntakings but also the society which has a stake in their\nproper and efficient working. Both discipline and devotion\nare necessary for efficiency. To ensure both, the service\nconditions of those who work for them must be encouraging,\ncertain and secured, and not vague and whimsical. With\ncapricious service conditions, both discipline and devotion\nare endan-\n\n277\n\ngered, and efficiency is impaired. -\n\n The right to life includes right to livelihood. The\nright to livelihood therefore cannot hang on to the fancies\nof individuals in authority. The employment is not a bounty\nfrom them nor can its survival be at their mercy. Income is\nthe foundation of many fundamental rights and when work is\nthe sole source of income, the right to work becomes as much\nfundamental. Fundamental rights can ill-afford to be con-\nsigned to the limbo of undefined premises and uncertain\napplications. That will be a mockery of them.\n Both the society and the individual employees, there-\nfore, have an anxious interest in service conditions being\nwell-defined and explicit to the extent possible. The arbi-\ntrary rules, such as the one under discussion, which are\nalso sometimes described as Henry VIII Rules, can have no\nplace in any service conditions.\n\n \nThese are the conclusions which flow from \nSukhdev Singh\n& Ors. v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi & Anr.\n, [1975]\n3 SCR 619; \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n, [1978] 2 SCR\n621; \nThe Manager, Government Branch Press & Anr. v.

Union of\nIndia & Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 122.\n\n 7. Since, before us the rule in question which admitted-\nly did not lay down explicit guidelines for its use was\nsought to be defended only on two grounds, viz., that the\npower conferred by it is to be exercised only by high au-\nthorities and that it is capable of being read down to imply\ncircumstances under which alone it can be used, I need deal\nonly with the said grounds.\n\n278\n\n \n8. The \"high authority\" theory so-called has already\nbeen adverted to earlier. Beyond the self-deluding and\nself-asserting righteous presumption, there is nothing to\nsupport it. This theory undoubtedly weighed with some au-\nthorities for some time in the past. But its unrealistic\npretensions were soon noticed and it was buried without even\nso much as an ode to it. Even while Shah, J. in his dissent-\ning opinion in Moti Ram Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.P.\nRailways, Maligaon, Pandu, etc., [1964] 5 SCR 683 had given\nvent to it, Das Gupta, J. in his concurring judgment but\ndealing with the same point of unguided provisions of Rule\n148(3) of the Railway Establishment Code, had not supported\nthat view and had struck down the rule as being violative of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. The majority did not deal\nwith this point at all and struck down the Rule as being\nvoid on account of the discrimination it introduced between\nrailway servants and other government servants.\n The reliance placed on the decision in \nShri Ram Krishna\nDalmia v. Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar & Ors.\n, [1959] SCR 279\nto support the above theory is also according to me not\ncorrect. As has been pointed out there, the \nCommission of\nInquiry Act, 1952\n, the validity of which was challenged on\nthe ground of unguided powers to institute inquiries, was\nnot violative of \nArticle 14\n because the long title and\n\nSection 3\n of the Act had contained sufficient guidelines for\nexercise of the power. \nSection 3\n has stated that the appro-\npriate government can appoint a Commission of Inquiry only\nfor the purpose of making inquiry into any definite matter\nof public importance. It is in the context of this guideline\nin the Act, that it is further stated there that even that\npower is to be exercised by the government and not any petty\nofficial. Hence a bare possibility that the power may be\nabused cannot per se invalidate the Act itself. The proposi-\ntion of law stated there is to be read as a whole and not in\nits truncated form. The authority does not lay down the\nproposition that even in the absence of guidelines, the\nconferment of power is valid merely because the power is to\nbe exercised by a high official. It must further be remem-\nbered that in this case, the contention was that although\nthe appropriate government was given power to appoint Com-\nmission of Inquiry into any definite matter of public impor-\ntance, the delegation of power was excessive since it was\nleft to the government to decide for itself in each case\nwhat constituted such matter. The court repelled the argu-\nment by pointing out that \"definite matter of public impor-\ntance\" constituted sufficient guideline to the government.\nIt was not, therefore, a case of no guideline but of the\nabsence of details of the guideline.\n\n279\n\n \nOf similar nature is the reliance placed on the decision\nin \nThe Collector of Customs, Madras v. Nathella Sampathu\nChetty & Anr.\n, [1962] 3 SCR 786 for the proposition that the\npossibility of the abuse of the powers is no ground for\ndeclaring the provision to be unreasonable or void. The\nrelevant observations are made while repelling the conten-\ntion there that the burden thrown under provisions of Sec-\ntion 178A of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 on the possessor of\nthe goods to show that they were not smuggled was violative\nof \nArticle 19(1)(f)\n and (g) of the Constitution. The obser-\nvations are as follows:\n\n\"The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does\nnot impart to it any element of invalidity. The converse\nmust also follow that a statute which is otherwise invalid\nas being unreasonable cannot be saved by its being adminis-\ntered in a reasonable manner. The constitutional validity of\nthe statute would have to be determined on the basis of its\nprovisions and on the ambit of its operation as reasonably\nconstrued. If so judged it passes the test of reasonable-\nness, possibility of the powers conferred being improperly\nused is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid and\nsimilarly if the law properly interpreted and tested in the\nlight of the requirements set out in Part III of the Consti-\ntution does not pass the test it cannot be pronounced valid\nmerely because it is administered in a manner which might\nnot conflict with the constitutional requirements. In saying\nthis we are not to be understood as laying down that a law\nwhich might operate harshly but still be constitutionally\nvalid should be operated always with harshness or that\nreasonableness and justness ought not to guide the actual\nadministration of such laws.\"\n\nThe statute there was saved by the provisions of \nArticle\n19(6)\n of the Constitution and was otherwise valid. It was\nnot a case of a provision which was constitutionally invalid\nbeing saved by recourse to the spacious assumption of its\nreasonable exercise in individual cases.\n\n \nIn \nTata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen & Anr.\n, [1964] 2\nSCR 125, it was a case of an employee of a private company\nwho was given a discharge simpliciter. This Court following\nits earlier decisions on the point observed that in several\ncases, contract of employment or Standing Orders authorise\nan industrial employer to terminate the employee's service\nby giving one month's notice or salary of one month in lieu\nof notice and normally an employer may, in a proper\n\n280\n\ncase be entitled to exercise the power. But where such\norder gives rise to an industrial dispute, the form of the\norder would not be decisive and the industrial adjudicator\nwould be entitled to probe it to find out whether it is mala\nfide or is made in colourable exercise of the power. Being\na private employment, the power so conferred was not as-\nsailed on the ground that it violated \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution.\n I fail to understand the reliance placed on\nthis authority to support the appellants' case before us.\n\n 9. The other authorities relied on behalf of the\nappellants have similarly no relevance to the point. \nIn\n\nJyoti Pershad v. The Administrator\n for the Union Territory\nof Delhi, [1962] 2 SCR 125, the \nSlum Clearance Act\n which was\nchallenged there contained enough guidelines for the exer-\ncise of the power.\n \nIn \nMunicipal Corporation of Greater\nBombay v. P.S. Malvenkar & Ors.\n, [1978] 3 SCR 1000, Order 26\nof the Standing Orders and Service Regulations which was in\nquestion there required reasons to be given for effecting\ntermination simpliciter of an employee.\n \nIn \nOrgano Chemical\nIndustries & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, [1980] 1 SCR 61,\n\nSection 143\n of the Provident Fund Act which was challenged\nwas held to be valid since the Act contained enough guide-\nlines for imposing penal damages.\n \nIn \nChampaklal Chimanlal\nShah v. The Union of India\n, [1964] 5 SCR 190, Rule 5 of the\nCentral Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1949 was\nchallenged on the ground that it discriminated between\ntemporary and permanent employees. There was no challenge\nto the absolute power given by the said rule to terminate\nthe services of temporary employees. In Ram Gopal Chaturve-\ndi v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1970] 1 SCR 472, it was a\ncase of termination of a temporary Government servant's\nservices.\n \nIn \nAir India Corporation, Bombay v. V.A. Rebellow\n& Anr.\n, [1972] 3 SCR 606, the challenge was to the termina-\ntion of services on the ground that it was done in colour-\nable exercise of power under \nRegulation 48\n of the Air India\nEmployees' Service Regulations. The said regulation was not\nchallenged on the ground that it gave unchannelised and\nunguided power of terminating the services of employees.\n \nIn\n\nHira Nath Mishra & Ors. v. The Principal, Rajendra Medical\nCollege, Ranchi and Anr.\n, [1973] 1 SCC 805, it was the case\nof the expulsior of students from college for two academic\nsessions pursuant to the order passed by the Principal of\nthat college. The expulsion was effected following a confi-\ndential complaint received from 36 girl students residing in\nthe girls' hostels alleging that the students in question d\nentered the compound of the girls' hostels at belated night\nand walked without clothes on them. The students were heard\nbut the evidence of the girls was not recorded in their\npresence.\n\n281\n\nThe Court held that under the circumstances the requirements\nof natural justice were fulfilled since the principles of\nnatural justice were not inflexible and differed in differ-\nent circumstances. I have not been able to appreciate the\nrelevance of this decision to the point in issue.\n\n 10. I may now deal with the second contention vehemently\nurged on behalf of the appellants. The contention was that\nif it is possible to save a legislation by reading it down\nto read in it words, expressions or provisions, it should\nnot be struck down. In order to save the present rule, it\nwas urged on behalf of the appellants that the Court should\nread in it circumstances under which alone it can be used.\nWhat precise circumstances should be read in it, however,\nwas not stated by the learned counsel. I am afraid that the\ndoctrine of reading down a statute has been wrongly pressed\ninto service in the present case. The authorities relied\nupon by the learned counsel for the appellants not only do\nnot help the appellants but go against their case. It would\nbe better if I first deal with the authorities cited at the\nBar for they will also bring out the correct meaning and\napplication of the said doctrine as well as its limitations.\n \nIn Re The Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act, 1937\n,\nand the \nHindu Women's Rights to Property (Amendment) Act,\n1938\n etc., [19411 FCR 12 what fell for consideration was\nwhether the said two Act which were the Central pieces of\nlegislation operated to regulate succession to agricultural\nland in the then Governors' Provinces. Admittedly, under the\nscheme of the then \nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n, after\nApril 1, 1937, the Central Legislature was precluded from\ndealing with the subjects numerated in List II of the 7th\nSchedule so far as the Governors' Provinces were concerned.\nLaws with respect to the \"devolution of agricultural land\"\n\ncould be enacted only by the Provincial Legislatures (Entry\nNo. 21 of List II) and wills, intestacy and succession, save\nas regards agricultural land appeared as Entry No. 7 of List\nIII, i.e., the Concurrent List. Hence, it was obvious that\nthe said Acts enacted as they were by the Central Legisla-\nture could not have dealt with succession to agricultural\nland so far as the Governors' Provinces were concerned. It\nis in these circumstances that the Federal Court read the\ntwo Acts of 1937 and 1938 as being not operative to regulate\nsuccession to agricultural land in the Governors' Provinces\nbut operative to regulate devolution by survivorship of\nproperty other than agricultural land. It will thus be\nobvious that the limited purpose for which the doctrine of\nreading down was called into play in that case was to ex-\nclude from the purview of the Act a subject which was not\nwithin the competence of the legislature which had enacted\nit.\n\n282\n\n \nIn \nNalinakhya Bysack v. Shyam Sunder Haldar & Ors.\n,\n[1953] SCR 533 the expression \"decree for recovery of pos-\nsession\" in Section 18(1) of the West Bengal Premises Rent\nControl (Temporary Provisions) Act (XVII of 1950) fell for\nconsideration, and the controversy was whether it included\nalso an order for recovery of possession made under \nSection\n43\n of the Presidency Small Cause Court Act, 1882 and hence a\nperson against whom an order under the latter provision was\nmade was not entitled to claim relief under the former\nprovision. In that connection the Court observed as follows:\n\n\"It must always be borne in mind, as said by Lord Halsbury\nin Commissioner for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pem-\nsel, LR 189 1 AC 53 1 at p. 549, that it is not competent to\nany Court to proceed upon the assumption that the Legisla-\nture has made a mistake. The Court must proceed on the\nfooting that the Legislature intended what it has said. Even\nif there is some defect in the phraseology used by the\nLegislature the Court cannot, as pointed out in Crawford v.\nSpooner, 6 Moo. PC 1; 4 MIA 179; aid the Legislature's\ndefective phrasing of an Act or add and amend or, by con-\nstruction, make up deficiencies which are left in the Act.\n\nEven where there is a casus omissus, it is, as said by Lord\nRussel of Killowen in \nHansraj Gupta v. Official Liquidator\nof Dehra Dun-Mussoorie Electric Tramway Co. Ltd.\n, [1933] LR\n60 IA 13; AIR 1953 PC 63 for others than the Courts to\nremedy the defect. In our view it is not right to give to\nthe word \"decree\" a meaning other than its ordinary accepted\nmeaning and we are bound to say, in spite of our profound\nrespect for the opinions of the learned Judges who decided\nthem, that the several cases relied on by the respondent\nwere not correctly decided.\"\n\n \nIn \nR.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of India\n, [1957]\nSCR 930, more or less a similar situation arose. The Parlia-\nment had enacted the \nPrize Competitions Act\n to provide for\nthe control and regulation of the prize competitions, and\n\nSection 2\n of the Act had defined \"Prize Competitions\" to\nmean \"any competition (whether called a crossword prize\ncompetition, a missing-word competition, a picture prize\ncompetition or by any other name), in which prizes are\noffered for the solution of any puzzle based upon the build-\ning up, arrangement, combination or permutation of letters,\nwords or figures\". The validity of.the restrictions imposed\nby the Act was challenged as going beyond \nArticle 19(6)\n of\nthe Constitution. The Court took a recourse to the\n\n283\n\ndoctrine of reading down and held that the definition of\nprize competition given in \nSection 2(d)\n of the Act had in\nview only such competitions as were of gambling nature and\nno others. The \nCourt further held\n there that in interpreting\nan enactment the Court should ascertain the intention of the\nlegislature not merely from a literal meaning of the words\nused but also from such matters as the history of the legis-\nlation, its purpose and the mischief which it seeks to\nsuppress.\n\n \nIn \nKedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar\n, [1962] Supp. 2\nSCR 769, the challenge was to the constitutional validity of\n\nSection 124A\n of the Indian Penal Code. Two views were before\nthis Court with regard to the ambit of the said section. One\nwhich held that words, deeds or writings constituted the\noffence of sedition under the said section only when they\nhad the intention or tendency to disturb public tranquility,\nto create public disturbance or to promote disorder. The\nother view was that it was not an essential ingredient of\nthe offence of sedition under the said section that the\nwords, deeds or writings should be intended to or be likely\nto incite public disorder. The latter view of the section\nwould have rendered it unconstitutional. It is in these\ncircumstances that this Court held that the former view'\nshould be taken which would render the said section consti-\ntutional. The Court in that connection also further held\nthat keeping in mind the reasons for the introduction of the\nsaid section and the history of sedition the former view was\nthe correct interpretation of the ambit of the said section.\n\nIn \nR.L. Arora v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.\n, [1964] 6\nSCR 784, the validity of \nSections 40\n and \n41\n of the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894, and of \nSection 7\n of the Amending Act,\nwas similarly upheld by placing on them construction which\nwould render them constitutional. The relevant provisions\nwere construed to mean that where land is acquired for the\nconstruction of a building or work which subserves the\npublic purpose of the industry or work in which a company is\nengaged or is about to be engaged, it can be said that the\nland was acquired for a public purpose.\n\n \nIn \nJagdish Pandey v. The Chancellor, University of Bihar\n& Anr.\n [1968] 1 SCR 231, \nSection 4\n of the Bihar State Uni-\nversities (University of Bihar, Bhagalpur and Ranchi)\n(Amendment) Act 13 of 1962 was called in question as being\nviolative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution on the ground\nthat the said section did not make any provision for giving\nthe teacher a hearing before passing the order thereunder.\nBy that section, every appointment, dismissal etc. of any\nteacher of a college affiliated to the University (but not\nbelonging to\n\n284\n\nthe State) made on or after 27th November, 1961 and before\n1st March, 1962 was to be subject to such order as the\nChancellor of the University may on the recommendation of\nthe University Service Commission established under \nSection\n48\n of the said Act pass with respect thereto. The Court held\nthat the said section was not invalid on the ground of\nunchannelised power given to the Chancellor because it never\nauthorised the Chancellor to scrutinise the relevant ap-\npointments for satisfying himself that they were in accord-\nance with University Act and its Statutes etc. The \nCourt\nfurther held\n that although the said section did not make a\nprovision for giving the teacher a hearing before passing\norder thereunder, such hearing must be read in the said\nsection which the Commission had to give according to the\nprinciples of natural justice before making its recommenda-\ntions to the Chancellor.\n\n \nIn \nShri Umed v. Raj Singh & Ors.\n, [1975] 1 SCR 918, one\nof the questions which fell for consideration was whether\nthe expression \"to withdraw or not to withdraw from being a\ncandidate\" referred to the stage of withdrawal of candida-\nture under \nSection 37\n and whether it applied to a situation\nwhere a contesting candidate announced that he does not wish\nto contest the election or declared his intention to sit\ndown after the last date for withdrawal of candidature under\n\nSection 37\n had passed.\n Over-ruling its earlier decision in\nMohd. Yunus Salim's case AIR 1974 SC 12 18, the Court held\nthat the function of the Court is to gather the intention of\nthe legislature from the words used by it, and it would not\nbe right for the Court to attribute an intention to the\nlegislature which though not justified by the language used\nby it, accords with what the Court conceives to be reason\nand good sense and then bend the language of the enactment\nso as to carry out such presumed intention of the legisla-\nture. For the Court to do so would be to overstep its lim-\nits. The Court also held that the words used by the legisla-\nture must be construed according to their plain natural\nmeaning, and in order to ascertain the true intention of the\nlegislature, the Court must not only look at the words used\nby the legislature but should also have regard to the con-\ntext and the setting in which they occur. The word \"context\"\nhas to be construed in a wide sense to mean all the provi-\nsions of the Act which bear upon the same subject matter and\nthese provisions have to be read as a whole and in their\nentirety each throwing light and illumining the meaning of\nthe other.\n\n In Sunil Batra etc. v. Delhi Administration & Ors.,\n[1973] 4 SCC 494 it was held that under \nSection 30(2)\nof the\nPrisons Act which provided that a prisoner under sentence of\ndeath shall be confined in a\n\n285\n\ncell apart from all other prisoners, did not mean that he\nhas to be confined cellularly or separately from the rest of\nthe prisoners so as to put him in a solitary confinement.\nThe said expression had a restricted meaning and it only\nmeant that such a prisoner has to be kept in a separate cell\nbut one which is not away from the other cells. Thus, the\nsaid expression, viz. \"shall be confined in a cell apart\nfrom all other prisoners\" in the said provision was read\ndown to exclude solitary confinement.\n\n In Excel Wear etc. v. Union of India & Ors., [1979] 1\nSCR 1009, one of the questions before this Court was whether\nthe Court could read in \nSection 25-O (2)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act that it was incumbent on the authority to give\nreasons in his order for refusing permission to close down\nthe undertaking. The Court answered it in the negative.\nAlthough in the discussion that follows explicit reasons for\nthe same are not found, it is legitimate to presume that the\nCourt did not accept the said contention because of the\nclear and explicit language of the said section.\n \nIn \nMinerva Mills Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n,\n[1981] 1 SCR 206, the majority judgment has discussed the\nlimitations of the doctrine of reading down which is rele-\nvant for our purpose. In that case, it was contended on\nbehalf of the State that \nArticle 31C\n should be read down so\nas to save it from the challenge of unconstitutionality and\nit was urged that it would be legitimate to read into that\nArticle the intendment that only such laws would be immu-\nnised from the challenge under \nArticle 14\n and \n19\n as did not\ndamage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.\nThe Court opined that \"to do so \nin that case\n would involve a\ngross distortion of the principle of reading down depriving\nthat doctrine of its only or true rationale when words of\nwidth are used inadvertently.\" According to the Court, \"the\ndevice of reading down is not to be resorted to in order to\nsave the susceptibilities of the law makers, nor indeed to\nimagine a law of one's liking to have been passed. One must\nat least take the Parliament at its word when, especially,\nit undertakes a constitutional amendment .......\n .......... If the Parliament has manifested a clear\nintention to exercise an unlimited power, it is impermissi-\nble to read down the amplitude of that power so as to make\nit limited. The principle of reading down cannot be invoked\nor applied in opposition to the clear intention of the\nlegislature. We suppose that in the history of the constitu-\ntional law, no constitutional amendment has ever been read\ndown to mean the exact opposite of what it says and intends.\nIn fact, to accept the argument that we should read down\n\nArticle 31C\n, so as to make it\n\n286\n\nconform to the ratio of the majority decision in Kesavananda\nBharati, is to destroy the avowed purpose of \nArticle 31C\n as\nindicated by the very heading \"Saving of certain laws\" under\nwhich \nArticles 31\n, 3\n lB and 31C are grouped. Since the\namendment to \nArticle 31C\n was unquestionably made with a view\nto empowering the legislatures to pass laws of a particular\ndescription even if those laws violate the discipline of\n\nArticles 14\n and \n19\n, it seems to us impossible to hold that\nwe should still save \nArticle 3\n iC from the challenge of\nunconstitutionality by reading into that Article words which\ndestroy the rationale of that Article and an intendment\nwhich is plainly contrary to its proclaimed purpose.\"\n The Court then dealt with the argument of the learned\nAdditional Solicitor General who contended that it was still\nopen to the Court under \nArticle 3\n IC of the Constitution to\ndecide whether the law enacted pursuant to it secured any of\nthe Directive Principles of the State Policy and whether the\nobject of the Directive Principles could not be secured\nwithout encroaching upon the Fundamental Rights and the\nextent to which encroachment was necessary and whether such\nencroachment violated the basic structure of the Constitu-\ntion. The Court opined that this argument was open to the\nsame criticism to which the argument of Attorney General was\nopen and that \"it would be sheer adventurism of a most\nextraordinary nature to undertake the kind of judicial\nenquiry which according to the learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral, the courts are free to undertake.\" The Court fur-\nther held that in the very nature of things it was difficult\nfor a court to determine whether a particular law gave\neffect to a particular policy and whether a law was adequate\nenough to give effect to that policy. It was pointed out by\nthe Court that it was not possible for the Court to set\naside the law so enacted as invalid merely because in the\nopinion of the Court, the law was not adequate enough to\ngive effect to that policy. The Court further pointed out\nthat \"the only question open to judicial review was whether\nthere was a direct and reasonable nexus between the impugned\nlaw and the provisions of the Directive Principles. The\nreasonableness was to be examined with regard to such nexus\nand not with regard to the impugned law. Hence, it was not\nopen to the Court to undertake the kind of enquiry suggested\nby the Additional Solicitor General. That would involve an\nextensive judicial review which was impermissible in law.\"\nThe Court then pointed out that where the express words of\nthe statute are clear and intended to give power without\nlimitation, the statute cannot be saved by reading into them\nwords and intendment of a diametrically opposite meaning and\ncontent. The Court opined that provisions such as these\nprovide a\n\n287\n\nstriking illustration of the limitations of the doctrine of\nreading down.\n\n In Union of India & Anr. etc. v. Tulsiram Patel etc.,\n[1985] 3 SCC 398 the majority judgment asserts that when the\nstatute expressly excludes the rule of audi alteram partem,\nthere is no scope for reintroducing it by a side-door to\nprovide the enquiry which has been expressly prohibited.\n In Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v. United States, 398 US\n333; 26 L. ed. 2nd 308 while making useful observations on\nthe doctrine of reading down and of recasting the statute,\nin his concurring opinion Harlan, J. stated as follows:\n\n \"When the plain thrust of a legislative enactment\ncan only be circumvented by distortion to avert an inevita-\nble constitutional collision, it is only by exalting form\nover substance that one can justify this veering off the\npath that has been plainly marked by the statute. Such a\ncourse betrays extreme skepticism as to constitutionality,\nand, in this instance, reflects a groping to preserve the\nconscientious objector exemption at all cost.\n I cannot subscribe to a wholly emasculated con-\nstruction of a statute to avoid facing a latent constitu-\ntional question, in purported fidelity to the salutary\ndoctrine of avoiding unnecessary resolution of constitution-\nal issues, a principle to which I fully adhere. It is, of\ncourse, desirable to salvage by construction legislative\nenactments whenever there is good reason to believe that\nCongress did not intend to legislate consequences that are\nunconstitutional, but it is not permissible, in my judgment,\nto take a lateral step that robs legislation of all meaning\nin order to avert the collision between its plainly intended\npurpose and the commands of the Constitution.\n\n It must be remembered that although this Court\nwill often strain to construe legislation so as to save it\nagainst constitutional attack, it must not and will not\ncarry this to the point of perverting the purpose of a\nstatute ... or judicially rewriting it. To put the matter\nanother way, this Court will not consider the abstract\nquestion of whether Congress might have enacted a valid\nstatute but instead must ask whether the statute that Con-\ngress did enact will\n\n288\n\npermissibly bear a construction rendering it free from\nconstitutional defects.\n\n The issue comes sharply into focus in Mr. Justice\nCardozo's statement for the Court in Moore Ice Cream Co. v.\nRose, 289 US 373,379; 77 L ed. 1245, 1270:\n\n 'A statute must be construed, if fairly possi-\nble, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is\nunconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that\nscore.' ... But avoidance of a difficulty will not be\npressed to the point of disingenuous evasion. Here the\nintention of the Congress is revealed too distinctly to\npermit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to\npower. The problem must be faced and answered.\"\n\n If an important congressional policy is to be\nperpetuated by recasting unconstitutional legislation, as\nthe prevailing opinion has done here, the analytically sound\napproach is to accept responsibility for this decision. Its\njustification cannot be by resort to legislative intent, as\nthat term is usually employed, but by a different kind of\nlegislative intent, namely the presumed grant of power to\nthe courts to decide, whether it more nearly accords with\nCongress' wishes to eliminate its policy altogether or\nextend it in order to render what Congress plainly did\nintend, constitutional.\"\n\n 11. It is thus clear that the doctrine of reading down\nor of recasting the statute can be applied in limited situa-\ntions. It is essentially used, firstly, for saving a statute\nfrom being struck down on account of its unconstitutionali-\nty. It is an extention of the principle that when two inter-\npretations are possible--one rendering it constitutional and\nthe other making it unconstitutional, the former should be\npreferred. The unconstitutionality may spring from either\nthe incompetence of the legislature to enact the statute or\nfrom its violation of any of the provisions of the Constitu-\ntion. The second situation which summons its aid is where\nthe provisions of the statute are vague and ambiguous and it\nis possible to gather the intentions of the legislature from\nthe object of the statute, the context in which the provi-\nsion occurs and the purpose for which it is made. However,\nwhen the provision is cast in a definite and unambiguous\nlanguage and its intention is clear, it is not permissible\neither to mend or bend it even if such recasting is in\naccord\n\n289\n\nwith good reason and conscience. In such circumstances, it\nis not possible for the Court to remake the statute. Its\nonly duty is to strike it down and leave it to the legisla-\nture if it so desires, to amend it. What is further, if the\nremaking of the statute by the courts is to lead to its\ndistortion that course is to be scrupulously avoided. One of\nthe situations further where the doctrine can never be\ncalled into play is where the statute requires an extensive\nadditions and deletions. Not only it is no part of the\ncourt's duty to undertake such exercise, but it is beyond\nits jurisdiction to do so.\n\n 12. Judged in the context of the above principles I am\nof the view that the doctrine cannot be availed of for\nsaving the present regulation- In the first instance, the\nregulation is a part of the service regulations of the\nemployees made by the Delhi Road Transport Authority in\nexercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) read\nwith clause (c) of sub-section (2) of \nSection 53\n of the\nDelhi Road Transport Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as\nthe \"Act\"). The object of the Act is to provide for the\nestablishment and the regulation of Road Transport Authority\nfor the promotion of a co-ordinated system of road transport\nin the State of Delhi. There is nothing either in the object\nof the service regulations of which the present regulation\nis a part or in the object of the Act which has a bearing on\nthe said \nRegulation 9(b)\n. If anything, the object of the Act\nwould require framing of such service regulations as would\nensure dedicated and diligent employees to run the undertak-\ning. The dedication of the employees would pre-suppose\nsecurity of employment and not a constant hanging of the\nDemocle's sword over their head, and hence would in any case\nnot bear the existence of such regulation. Secondly, the\nlanguage of the regulation is so crystal clear that no two\ninterpretations are possible to be placed on it and hence it\nis not permissible to read in it any meaning other than what\nis clearly sought to be conveyed by it. Thirdly, the context\nof the said regulation makes it abundantly clear that it is\nmeant to be a naked hire and fire rule and the authority has\nbeen vested with unguided and arbitrary power to dispense\nwith the services of any category of the employees. Sub-\nclause (a) of the said \nRegulation 9\n mentions elaborately the\ncircumstances in which the services of an employee can be\nterminated without any notice or pay in lieu of such notice.\nSub-clause (b) follows closely on its heel and states in\nclear language that when the termination is made due to\nreduction of establishment or in circumstances other than\nthose mentioned in subclause (a), one month's notice or pay\nin lieu thereof is all that is necessary to be given for\nterminating an employee's services. The intention of the\nrule-making authority, therefore, is more than clear. It\n\n290\n\nwas to give an absolute free hand without any limitations\nwhatsoever to terminate the services of any employee. Both\nthe language of the regulation as well as the context in\nwhich it is cast leave no scope for reading into it any\nfurther provision. What is more, the kind of recasting which\nis suggested on behalf of the appellants would not only\ndistort the intention of the rule-making authority but would\nalso require extensive amendment to it of a very vague\nnature. The appellants suggest firstly that we should read\ninto the regulation a provision that the concerned employee\nwould be given a hearing. The suggestion itself begs the\nquestion: Hearing for what? Is he to be heard with regard to\nhis misconduct? If so, it will require that he should first\nbe intimated of the misconduct of which he is guilty. But\nthat kind of a situation is taken care of by sub-clause (a)\nof the said regulation. There is, therefore, no need of a\nseparate provision for the same. If, on the other hand, the\nservices of an employee are to be terminated on grounds\nother than those mentioned in sub-clause (a), then those\ngrounds being unknown to the employee, cannot be met by him\neven if he is given a hearing. The reading in the rule of a\nmere provision of a hearing is, therefore, meaningless. The\nother suggestion made on behalf of the appellants is still\nmore objectionable. The suggestion was that we should read\nin the rule all circumstances where it is not possible or\nnecessary to hold an enquiry. 1 thought that such situations\nare capable of being formulated easily and conveniently at\nleast in general terms as is done by the Constitution-makers\nin the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n In fact, one of the\npublic undertakings viz., Indian Airlines has come out with\nsuch regulation being amended \nRegulation 13\n of its Employ-\nees' Service Regulations, and the same has been placed on\nrecord by them. What is necessary to note in this connection\nis that the reading of such circumstances in the existing\nregulation would require its extensive recasting which is\nimpermissible for the Court to do. 1 know of no authority\nwhich supports such wide reading down of any provision of\nthe statute or rule/regulation. For all these reasons the\ndoctrine of reading down is according to me singularly\ninapplicable to the present case and the arguments in sup-\nport of the same have to be rejected.\n\n 13. I am, therefore, of the view that there is no sub-\nstance in this appeal. I would rather that the long departed\nrule rests in peace at least now. Hence I dismiss Civil\nAppeal No. 2876/86 with costs.\n\n 1 allow Civil Appeal No. 1115 of 1976 and agree with the\norder proposed to be passed therein by the learned Chief\nJustice.\n\n291\n\n The rest of the civil appeals, and Special Leave Peti-\ntion (Civil) No. 7612 of 1987 be referred to the Division\nBench for disposal in accordance with the opinion expressed\nin Civil Appeal No. 2876 of 1986 hereinabove. The applica-\ntion for intervention are allowed.\n\n K. RAMASWAMY, J: 1. These batch cases concern, a refer-\nence. the correctness of the ratio rendered in Central\nInland Water Transport Company Limited v. Brojonath Ganguly,\n[1986] 3 SCC. 156 = AIR 1986 SC 1571 (for short Brojo Nath).\nThe facts in C.A. No. 2886/86 lie in a short compass and\nsufficient for deciding the controversy are stated thus:\n\n 2. The Delhi Transport Corporation, a statutory body\nterminated the services of its three permanent employees,\nthe Conductor (R. 2), Asstt. Traffic Incharge (R. 3), and\nthe Driver (R. 4) for their alleged inefficiency, by exer-\ncising the power of \nRegulation 9(b)\n of Delhi Road Transport\nAuthority (Conditions of appointment and Services) Regula-\ntion, 1952 (for short \"the Regulation\") framed under \nsection\n53\n of the Delhi Road Transport Act, 1950 read with Delhi\nTransport (Amendment) Act, 1971 (for short \"the Act\"). The\nfirst respondent union assailed the validity of the Regula-\ntion which the High Court of Delhi struck it down as offend-\ning \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The High Court\nsolely relied on the ratio in Brojo Nath whose correctness\nis the subject of the reference: My learned brother, My Lord\nthe Chief Justice extensively stated the argument of the\ncounsel on either side. Therefore, to avoid needless burden\non this judgment, I consider it redundant to reiterate them\nonce over.\n\n 3. \nRegulation 9(b)\n of the Regulations read thus: Termi-\nnation of Services:\n\n \n\"Whether the termination is made due to reduction of\nestablishment or in circumstances other than those mentioned\nin (a) above, one. month's notice or pay in lieu thereof\nwill be given to all categories of employees\" as is similar\nto Rule 9 of the Rules in \nBrojo Nath\n's case (supra) which\nthis Court declared to be Henry VIII clause, conferring an\nabsolute, arbitrary and unguided power upon that Corporation\nand was held to be ultra vires of the provisions of the\nConstitution and was void under \nsection 23\n of the Indian\nContract Act. As stated earlier, the correctness thereof is\nthe primary question in these appeals.\n\n \n4. Sri Ashok Desai, the learned Solicitor General vehe-\nmently contended that, under ordinary law of \"master and\nservant\" the\n\n292\n\nCorporation is empowered by the Contract of Service to\nterminate the services of its employees in terms thereof.\nThe declaration in \nBrojo Nath\n's case that such a contract is\nvoid, under \nsection 23\n of the Indian Contract Act or opposed\nto public policy offending the Fundamental Rights and the\nDirective Principles, is not sound in law. He contends that\nas a master the Corporation has unbridled right to terminate\nthe contract in the interests of efficient functioning of\nthe Corporation or to maintain discipline among its employ-\nees.\n \nThe termination, if is found to be wrongful, the only\nremedy available to the employees is to claim damages for\nwrongful termination but not a declaration as was granted in\n\nBrojo Nath\n's case.\n \nIn support thereof, he cited passages\nfrom Chitti on Contract, Halsbury's Laws of England and the\nratio in \nUnion of India v. Tulsiram PateI\n, [1985] Supp. 2\nSCR 131 = AI 1985 SC. 1416. He also placed strong reliance\non Industrial Law and the decisions of this Court cited by\nmy learned brother, the Chief Justice. Alternatively he\ncontended that the relevant regulations would be read down\nso as to be consistent with Arts. 14 and 16(1) read with\n\nArt. 19(1)(g)\n of the Constitution and the authority invested\nwith such power could in an appropriate case, report to\nterminate the services of an employee expeditiously without\nrecourse to an elaborated enquiry and opportunity of hear-\ning. The latter contention of reading down the relevant\nrules received support from the learned Attorney General Sri\nSoli J. Sorabjee and other counsel appearing for the employ-\ners. M/s. M.K. Ramamurthi, R.K. Garg, and P.P. Rao, learned\ncounsel appearing for the employees resisted these conten-\ntions.\n\n 5. The main controversy centres round the question\nwhether the employer, Statutory Corporation or instrumental-\nity or other authority under \nArt. 12\n of the Constitution has\nunbridled power to terminate the services of a permanent\nemployee by issue of notice or pay in lieu thereof without\ninquiry or opportunity, in exercise of the power in terms of\ncontract which include statutory Rules or Regulations or\ninstructions having force of law. It is undoubted that under\nordinary law of master and servant, whether the contract of\nservice is for a fixed period or not, if it contains a\nprovisions for termination of service by notice, in terms\nthereof, it can be so determined and if the contract finds\nno provisions to give notice and the contract of service is\nnot for a fixed period, law implies giving of a reasonable\nnotice. Where no notice or a reasonable notice was issued,\nbefore terminating the contract, the termination of the\ncontract of service is wrongful and the aggrieved employee\nis entitled at law to sue for damages. But this common law\nprinciple could be applied to the employees, appointed by a\nStatutory Corporation or authority or an instrumentality\nwithin\n\n293\n\nthe meaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution is the square\nquestion. It is not disputed that Delhi Road Transport\nCorporation is a Statutory Corporation under the Act and the\nRegulations are statutory and its employees are entitled to\nthe fundamental Rights enshrined in Part III of the Consti-\ntution. It is well settled law by a heed role of decisions\nof this Court that the Corporation or a Statutory Authority\nor an instrumentality or other authority under \nArt. 12\n of\nthe Constitution is not free, like an ordinary master (a\nprivate employer), to terminate the services of its employ-\nees at its whim or caprices or vagary. It is bound by the\nAct and the Regulation and the paramount law of the land,\nthe Constitution.\n\n Nature of the Power Statutory Authority to terminate the\nservices of its employees.\n\n 6. In Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram, [1975] 3 SCR. 619 =\nAIR 1975 SC. 1331, the Constitution Bench of this Court put\na nail in the coffin of the play of the private master's\npower to hire and fire his employees and held that Regula-\ntions or Rules made under a Statute apply uniformly to\neveryone or to all members of the same group or class. They\nimpose obligations on the statutory authorities who cannot\ndeviate from the conditions of service and any deviation\nwill be enforced through legal sanction of declaration by\nCourts to invalidate the actions in violation of the Rules\nor Regulations. The statutory bodies have no free hand in\nframing the terms or conditions of service of their employ-\nees. The Regulations bind both the authorities and also the\npublic. The powers of the statutory bodies are derived,\ncontrolled and restricted by the Statutes which create them\nand the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder. The Stat-\nute, thereby fetters on the freedom of contract. Accordingly\ndeclaration was granted that dismissal or removal of an\nemployee by statutory Corporation in contravention of statu-\ntory provision as void. Mathew, J. in a separate but concur-\nrent judgment held that a Public Corporation being the\ncreation of a Statute is subject to statutory limitations as\na State itself. The preconditions of this Part II viz., that\nthe corporation is created by Statute and the existence of\npower in the corporation is to invade a statutory right of\nthe individual. Therefore, the governing power must be\nsubject to fundamental statutory limitations. The need to\nsubject the power centres to the control of the Constitution\nrequires an expansion of concept of State action. The duty\nof State is affirmative duty seeing that all essentials of\nlife are made available to all persons. The task of State\ntoday is to make the achievement of good life both by remov-\ning obstacles in the path of such achievement and by assist-\ning individual in realis-\n\n294\n\ning his ideal of self-perfection. The employment under\npublic corporation is a public employment and, therefore,\nthe employee should have\nthe protection which appurtains to public employment.\n\n (emphasis supplied).\n\nThe Court must, therefore, adopt the attitude that declara-\ntion is a normal remedy for a wrongful dismissal in case of\npublic employees which can be refused in exceptional circum-\nstances. The remedy of declaration should be a remedy made\nan instrument to provide reinstatement in public sector.\nThis principle was extended to numerous instances where the\ntermination of services of the employees of a statutory\ncorporation was affected in violation of the principles of\nnatural justice or in transgression of the statutory rules\netc. \nIn \nU.P. State Warehousing Corporation v. N.V. Vajpayee\n,\n[1980] 2 SCR 737 at p 780 F to G and 783G to 784A this Court\nheld that statutory body cannot terminate the services of\nits employees without due enquiry held in accordance with\nthe principles of natural justice. The persons in public\nemployment are entitled to the protection of \nArticles 14\n and\n\n16\n of the Constitution, when the service was arbitrarily\nterminated. The question, therefore, is whether the statuto-\nry corporations are entitled to be invested with absolute\nfreedom to terminate the services of its employees in terms\nof the contract of service.\n\n 7. \nIn \nRamana v. International Airport Authority of\nIndia\n, [1979] 3 SCR. 1014 = (1979) SC. p. 1628 this Court\nheld that expression of welfare and social service functions\nnecessitates the State to assume control over natural and\neconomic resources and large scale natural and commercial\nactivities. For the attainment of socio-economic justice,\nthere is vast and notable increase of frequency with which\nordinary citizens come into relationship of direct encoun-\nters with the State. The Government in a welfare state is\nthe regulator and dispenser of social services and provider\nof large number of benefits, including jobs etc. Thousands\nof people are employed in Central/State Government Services\nand also under local authorities. The Government, therefore,\ncannot act arbitrarily. It does not stand in the same posi-\ntion as a private individual. In a democratic Government by\nrule of law, the executive Government or any of its officers\ncannot held to be possessed of arbitrary power over the\ninterests of the individuals. Every action of the Government\nmust be informed with reason and should be free from arbi-\ntrariness. That is the very essence of rule of law. It was\nfurther held:\n\n\"It was, therefore, be taken to be the law that where the\nGovernment is dealing with the public, whether by way of\n\n295\n\ngiving jobs or entering into contracts .......... the\nGovernment cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and,\nlike a private individual, deal with any person it pleases,\nbut its action must be in conformity with standard of norm\nwhich, is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant. The power\nof discretion of the Government in the matter of grant of\nlargess including award of jobs, .........................\nmust be conditioned and structured by rational relevant and\nnon-discriminatory standard or norm and if the Government\ndeparts from such standard or norm in any particular case or\ncases, the action or the Government would be liable to be\nstruck down, unless it can be shown by the Government that\nthe departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid\nprinciple which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable\nor discriminatory.\"\n\n This statement of law, though was made in the context of\ncontractual relations, it is a general law with width and\namplitude which permeates the entire spectrum of actions,\nlegislative as well as executive.\n\n 8. The Constitution is the permanent law of the land and\nits preamble is an integral part thereof. It assures Social\nand Economic Justice and also accords equality of opportuni-\nty and status as well as equality before law assuring digni-\nty of the individual. The Constitution Forty Second Amend-\nment Act introduced \"Socialism\" in the Preamble and made\nexplicit of what is latent in the Constitutional Scheme.\n\nArticle 14\n accords equal protection of law and equality\nbefore law. \nArticle 16(1)\n provides right to an appointment\nor employment to an office or post under the State. \nArticle\n19(1)(g)\n assures right to occupation or avocation. \nArt. 21\n\nassures right to life and any deprivation is as per the\nprocedure established by law. \nIn \nGeneral Manager, Southern\nRailway v. Rangachari\n, [1962] S.C.R. page 586 it was held\nthat matters relating to employment would include salary,\nincrements, leave, gratuity, pension, age of superannuation\netc. Similarly, in respect of appointments, such matters\nwould include all the terms and conditions of service per-\ntaining to the said office. All those matters are included\nin the expression \"matters relating to employment or ap-\npointment\" within the meaning of \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitu-\ntion. This was reiterated in State of M.P.v. Shardul Singh,\n[19701 3 S.C.R. page 302 at 305--306 that conditions of\nservice include holding of posts right from the time of\nappointment till his retirement beyond it like pension etc.\nThe middle class, lower middle class and lower classes'\neducated\n\n296\n\nyouths generally, if not mainly,-depend on employment or\nappointment to an office or posts under the States which\ninclude corporations, statutory body or instrumentality\nunder \nArt. 12\n of the Constitution as source to their liveli-\nhood and means to improve their intellectual excellence and\nliner facets of life individually and collectively as a\nmember of the society so that himself and his dependents are\neconomically sound, educationally advanced and socially\ndignified so that the nation constantly rises to standards\nof higher level in an egalitarian social order under rule of\nlaw as is obligated under \nArt. 51A(J ).\n\nRight to life scope of\n\n 9. The right to life, a basic human right assured by\n\nArt. 21\n of the Constitution comprehends something more than\nmere animal existence i.e. dignity of the individual. Field\nJ. in Munn v. Illinois, [1876] 94 US 113 and 154 held that\nby the term \"life\" as here used, something more is meant\nthan mere animal existence. The inhibition against its\ndeprivation extends to all those limbs and faculties by\nwhich life is enjoyed. The deprivation not only of life but\nof ..... if it a efficacy be not lettered away by Judicial\ndecision. \nIn \nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n, [1964] 1 SCR 332\nthis Court approved the definition of life given by Field J.\nin his dissenting opinion.\n In Olga Tellis v. Bombay Munici-\npal Corporation, [1985] 2 Suppl. SCR page 51 at 79 this\nCourt further laid that an equally important facet of the\nright to life is the right to livelihood because no person\ncan live without the means of livelihood. If the right to\nlivelihood is not treated as a part of the Constitutional\nright to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his\nright to life would be to deprive him of his means of live-\nlihood to the point of abrogation ..... That, which alone\ncan make it possible to live, leave aside which makes life\nliveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of the\nright to life ..... The motive force which propels their\ndesertion of their hearths and homes in the village is the\nstruggle for survival, that is the struggle for life. So\nunimpeachable is the nexus between life and the means of\nlivelihood. Right to life does not only mean physicaI exist-\nence but includes basic human dignity, vide Menaka Gandhi v.\nUnion of India, [1978] 2 SCR 621 John Stuart Mill in his\n'Consideration of Representative Govt.' said years ago that\n\"the power of the State is to promote virtue and intelli-\ngence of the people\". In State of Maharashtra v. Chunder\nBhan, [1983] 3 SCR 387 = AIR 1983 SC 803 Chinnappa Reddy, J.\nheld that public employment opportunity is a national wealth\nin which all citizens are equally entitled to share and\nVaradarajan, J. held that public employment is the property\nof the nation which has to be shared equally. This rule\n\n297\n\nwas laid when rule 15(1)(ii)(b') of B.C.S. Rules to pay\nsubsistence allowance during period of suspension @ Rs. 1\nper month pending departmental enquiry was challenged and\ndeclared the rule as ultra vires by operation of Arts. 14,\n16, 21 and 311(2).\n\n The right to public employment and its concomitant right\nto livelihood, thus, receive their succour and nourishment\nunder the canopy of the protective umbrella of Arts. 14,\n16(1), 19(1)(g) and 21. Could statutory law arbitrarily take\naway or abridged or abrogated it? In Board of Trustees, Port\nof Bombay v. Dilip Kumar, [1983] 1 SCR 828 = AIR 1983 SC 109\nthis Court held that the expression \"life\" does not merely\nconnote animal existence or a continued drudgery through\nlife, the expression life has a much wider meaning. Where,\ntherefore, the, outcome of a departmental enquiry is likely\nto affect reputation or livelihood of a person, some of the\nliner graces of human civilisation which makes life worth\nliving would be jeopardised and the same can be put in\njeopardy only by law which inheres fair procedure.\n\n \nIn \nWorkmen of Hindustan Steels Ltd. v. Hindustan Steel\nLtd. & Ors.\n, [1985] 2 SCR 428 it was held that the standing\norder 31 which confers arbitrary, uncanalised and drastic\npower on the Manager to dismiss an employee without enquiry,\napart from being in violation of basic requirement of natu-\nral justice, is such a drastic nature as to effect the\nlivelihood and put a stigma on the character of the workman.\n\nIn \nFrancis Corallie v. U.T. of Delhi\n, [1981] 2 SCR 516 = AIR\n1981 SC 746 this Court held that \"it is for the Court to\ndecide, in exercise of its constitutional power of judicial\nreview, whether the deprivation of life or personal liberty\nin a given case is by procedure which is reasonable, fair\nand just and fair treatment\". The tests of reason and jus-\ntice cannot be abstract nor can be divorced from the actual-\nities of life and the needs of the Society. The tests ap-\nplied must be pragmatic and purposive lest they cease to be\nreasonable. Reasonableness must be meaningful and effica-\ncious in content as well as in form. The procedure provided\nin Rule 9(b) or allied rules, therefore, must not be just,\nfair and reasonable so as to be in conformity with Arts. 14\nand 21 is the cry of the case.\n\n10. The position of the public employee is whether status:\n\n The distinguishing feature of public employment is\nstatus. In Roshanlal Tandon v. Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR\n185 at 195-196 the Constitution Bench held that the legal\nposition of a Government servant is more one of status than\nof contract. The hall-mark of status\n\n298\n\nis the attachment to a legal relationship of rights and\nduties imposed by, the public law and not by mere agreement\nof the parties. The employment of the Government servant and\nhis terms of service are governed by statute or statutory\nrules. Once he is appointed to the post or office, the\nGovernment servant acquires a status and his rights and\nobligations are no longer determined by consent of both\nparties but by Statute or Statutory Rules. The relationship\nbetween the Government and its servants is not like an\nordinary contract of service between a master and servant.\n\nThe legal relationship is in the nature of status. The\nduties of statute are fixed by the law and in the enforce-\nment of the duties society has an interest. Status is a\ncondition of membership of a group of which powers and\nduties are exclusively determined by law and not by agree-\nment between the parties concerned. \nIn \nCalcutta Dock Labour\nBoard v. Jarfar Imam\n, [1965] 3 SCR 463 it was held that the\nstatutory scheme of employment confers on the worker a\nstatus. An unlawful act is an interference with status.\n \nThis\nview was followed in \nSirsi Municipality v. Cecelia Kom\nFrancis Tellis\n, [1973] 3 SCR 348 Beg, J. (as he then was)\nheld that the principles applicable to the relation of a\nPrivate Master and servant unregulated by statute, could not\napply to the cases of a public statutory body exercising\npowers of punishment lettered or limited by statute and\nrelevant rules of procedure. This Court in a recent decision\nextended all the benefits of pay scales to all the Central\nGovernment Corporate Sector employees. It is, thus, I hold\nthat the employees of the corporations, statutory authority\nor instrumentality under \nArt. 12\n have statutory status as a\nmember of its employees. The rights and obligations are\ngoverned by the relevant statutory provisions and the em-\nployer and employee are equally bound by that statutory\nprovisions.\n\n11. Nature of the right of a permanent employee to a post\n In \nPurushottam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India\n, [1958] SCR\n828 at 84 1-843 it was held that the appointment to a perma-\nnent post may be substantive or on probation or on officiat-\ning basis. A substantive appointment to a permanent post in\na public service confers normally substantive right to the\npost and he becomes entitled to hold a lien on the post. He\nis entitled to continue in office till he attains the age of\nsuperannuation as per rules or is dismissed or removed from\nservice for inefficiency, misconduct or negligence or any\nother disqualification in accordance with the procedure\nprescribed in the rules, and fair and reasonable opportunity\nof being heard or on compulsory retirement or in certain\ncircumstances, subject to the conditions like re-employment\non abolition of post.\n In Motiram Daka v. General Manager,\n[1964] 5\n\n299\n\nSCR 683 at 718-721=AIR 1964 SC 600 at 608 & 609 majority of\nseven Judges' Bench held that a permanent post carries a\ndefinite rate of pay without a limit of time and a servant\nwho substantively holds a permanent post has a title to hold\nthe post to which he is substantively appointed, and that in\nterms, means that a permanent servant has a right to hold\nthe post until, of course, he reaches superannuation or\nuntil he is compulsorily retired under the relevant rule. If\nfor any other reason that right is invaded and he is asked\nto leave the service the termination of his service must\ninevitably mean the defeat of his right to continue in\nservice and as such, it is in the nature of penalty and\namounts to removal. In other words, termination of service\nof a permanent servant, otherwise than on superannuation of\ncompulsory retirement, must per se amount to his removal and\nso, by Rule 148(3) or Rule 149(3) of Rly. Establishment\nRules if such a termination is brought about, the rule\nclearly contravenes \nArt. 311(2)\n and must be held to be\ninvalid. A permanent employment assures security of tenure\nwhich is essential for the efficiency and incorruptibility\nof public administration. In Guruder Singh Sidhu v. State of\nPepsu, [1964] 7 SCR 587 =AIR 1964 SC 1585 another Constitu-\ntion Bench held that for efficient administration of the\nState, it is absolutely essential that permanent public\nservant should enjoy a sense of security of tenure. The\nsafeguard which \nArt. 311(2)\n affords is no more than this\nthat in case it is intended to dismiss or remove or reduce\nthem in rank, a reasonable opportunity should be given to\nthem of showing cause against the action proposed to be\ntaken in regard to them. In Motiram Daka's case (supra) it\nwas further held that in a modern democratic State, the\nefficiency and incorruptibility of public administration is\nof such importance that it is essential to afford to civil\nservants adequate protection against capricious action from\ntheir superior authority. If a permanent civil servant is\nguilty of misconduct, he should no doubt be proceeded\nagainst promptly under the relevant disciplinary rules,\nsubject, of course, to the safeguard prescribed by \nArt.\n311(2);\n but in regard to honest, straight-forward and effi-\ncient permanent civil servants, it is of utmost importance,\neven from the point of view of the State, that they should\nenjoy a sense of security which alone can make them inde-\npendent and truly efficient. The sword of damocles hanging\nover the heads of permanent railway servants in the form of\nRule 148(3) or Rule 149(3) would inevitably create a sense\nof insecurity in the minds of such servants and would invest\nappropriate authorities with very wide powers which may\nconceivably be abused. Thereby this Court laid emphasis that\na permanent employee has a right or lien on the post he\nholds until his tenure of service reaches superannuation so\nas to earn pension at the evening of his life unless it is\ndetermined as\n\n300\n\nper law. An assurance of security of service to a public\nemployee is an essential requisite for efficiency and incor-\nruptibility of public administration. It is also an assur-\nance to take independent drive and initiative in the dis-\ncharge of the public duties to alongate the goals of social\njustice set down in the Constitution.\n\n \nThis Court in \nDaily Rated Casual Labour v. Union of\nIndia\n, [1988] 1 SCR 598--[1988] 1 SCC 122 at 130-131 further\nheld that the right to work, the right to free choice of\nemployment, the right to just and favourable conditions of\nwork, the right to protection against unemployment etc., and\nthe right to security of work are some of the rights which\nhave to be ensured by appropriate legislative and executive\nmeasures. It is true that all these rights cannot be extend-\ned simultaneously. But they do indicate the socialist goal.\nThe degree of achievement in this direction depends upon the\neconomic resources, willingness of the people to produce and\nmore than all the existence of industrial peace throughout\nthe country. Of those rights the question of security of\nwork is of most importance. If a person does not have the\nfeeling that he belongs to an organisation engaged in pro-\nduction he will not put forward his best effort to produce\nmore. (emphasis supplied) That sense of belonging arises\nonly when he feels that he will not be turned out of employ-\nment the next day at the whim of the management. It is for\nthis reason it is being repeatedly observed by those who are\nin charge of economic affairs of the countries in different\nparts of the world that as far as possible security of work\nshould be assured to the employees so that they may contrib-\nute to the maximisation of production.\n\n 12. It must, therefore, be held that a permanent employ-\nee of a statutory authority, corporation or instrumentality\nunder \nArt. 12\n has a lien on the post till he attains super-\nannuation or compulsorily retired or service is duly termi-\nnated in accordance with the procedure established by law.\nSecurity of tenure ensures the benefit of pension on retire-\nment. Dismissal, removal or termination of his/her service\nfor inefficiency, corruption or other misconduct is by way\nof penalty. He/ she has a right to security of tenure which\nis essential to inculcate a sense of belonging to the serv-\nice or organisation and involvement for maximum production\nor efficient service. It is also a valuable right which is\nto be duly put an end to only as per valid law.\n\n13. How to angulate the effect of termination of service\nLaw is a social engineering to remove the existing irabal-\nance and\n\n301\n\nto further the progress, serving the needs of the Socialist\nDemocratic Bharat under rule of law. The prevailing social\nconditions and actualities of life are to be taken into\naccount to adjudging whether the impugned legislation would\nsubserve the purpose of the society. The arbitrary, unbrid-\ndled and naked power of wide discretion to dismiss a perma-\nnent employee without any guidelines or procedure would tend\nto defeat the constitutional purpose of equality and allied\npurposes \nreferred to above\n. Courts would take note of actu-\nalities of life that persons actuated to corrupt practices\nare capable, to maneuver with higher echolons in diverse\nways and also camouflage their activities by becoming syco-\nphants or chronies to the superior officers. Sincere, honest\nand devoted subordinate officer unlikely to lick the boots\nof the corrupt superior officer. They develop a sense of\nself-pride for their honesty, integrity and apathy and\ninertia towards the corrupt and tent to undermine or show\nsigns of disrespect or disregard towards them. Thereby, they\nnot only become inconvenient to the corrupt officer but also\nstand an impediment to the on-going smooth sipbony of cor-\nruption at a grave risk to their prospects in career or even\nto their tenure of office. The term efficiency is an elusive\nand relative one to the adept capable to be applied in\ndiverse circumstances. if a superior officer develops likes\ntowards sycophant, tough corrupt, he would tolerate him and\nfound him to be efficient and pay encomiums and corruption\nin such eases stand no impediment. When he finds a sincere,\ndevoted and honest officer to be inconvenient, it is easy to\ncast him/her off by writing confidential with delightfully\nvague language imputing to be 'not upto the mark', 'wanting\npublic relations' etc. Yet times they may be termed to be\n\"security risk\" (to their activities). Thus they spoil the\ncareer of the honest, sincere and devoted officers. In-\nstances either way are gallore in this regard. Therefore,\none would be circumspect, pragmatic and realistic to these\nactualities of life while angulating constitutional validity\nof wide arbitrary, uncanalised and unbriddled discretionary\npower of dismissal vested in an appropriate authority either\nby a statute or a statutory rule. Vesting arbitrary power\nwould be a feeding ground for nepotism and insolence; in-\nstead of subserving the constitutional purpose, it would\ndefeat the very object, in particular, when the tribe of\nofficers of honesty, integrity and devotion are struggling\nunder despondence to continue to maintain honesty, integrity\nand devotion to the duty, in particular, when moral values\nand ethical standards are fast corroding in all walks of\nlife including public services as well. It is but the need\nand imperative of the society to pat on the back of those\nband of honest, hard-working officers of integrity and\ndevotion to duty. It is the society's interest to accord\nsuch officers security of service and avenues of promotion.\n\n302\n\n That apart, the haunting fear of dismissal from service\nat the vagary of the concerned officer would dry up all\nsprings of idealism of the employee and in the process\ncoarsens the conscience and degrades his spirit. The nobler\nimpulses of minds and the higher values of life would not\nco-exist with fear. When fear haunts a man, happiness van-\nishes. Where fear is, justice cannot be, where fear is,\nfreedom cannot be. There is always a carving in the human\nfor satisfaction of the needs of the spirit, by arming by\ncertain freedom for some basic values without which life is\nnot worth-living. It is only when the satisfaction of the\nphysical needs and the demands of the spirit coexists, there\nwill be true efflorescence of the human personality and the\nfree exercise of individual faculties. Therefore, when the\nConstitution assures dignity of the individual and the right\nto livelihood the exercise of the power by the executive\nshould be cushioned with adequate safeguards for the rights\nof the employees against any arbitrary and capracicous use\nof those powers.\n\nContract of service must be consistent with the Constitu-\ntion.\n\n 14. From the above perspective vis-a-vis constitutional,\nsocial goals and rights of the citizens assured in the\npreamble, Parts III & IV i.e. the trinity, the question\nwhether the statutory corporation or the instrumentality or\nthe authority under \nArt. 12\n of the Constitution is validly\nempowered to terminate the services of a permanent employee\nin terms of the contract of employment or rules without\nconducting an enquiry or an opportunity of show cause of\nproposed order of termination of the service. \nThe Indian\nContract Act, 1872\n operating in British India was extended\nto the merged States in 1949 & 1950 except to the State of\nJammu & Kashmir. Therefore, after Bharat attained independ-\nence on August 15, 1947, the \nIndian Contract Act\n is applica-\nble to all States except Jammu & Kashmir. By operation of\n\nArticle 372\n of the Constitution, the Indian Contract Act\ncontinues to be in operation subject to the provisions of\nthe Constitution. \nThe Indian Contract Act\n is an amending as\nwell as consolidating Act as held in Ramdas Vithaldas Durbar\nv.S. Amerchand & Co., 43 Indian Appeals 164. Thereby common\nlaw principles applicable in England, if they are inconsist-\nent with or derogation to the provisions of the \nIndian\nContract Act\n or the Constitution to that extent they stand\nexcluded. Any law, muchless the provisions of \nContract Act\n,\nare inconsistent with the fundamental rights which guaran-\nteed in Part III of the Constitution, by operation of Arti-\ncles 13 of the Constitution, are void. \nSection 2(h)\n of the\nIndian Contract Act defines \"an agreement\" including an\nagreement of service and becomes a Contract only when it is\nenforceable by\n\n303\n\nlaw. If it is not enforceable it would be void by reason of\n\nsection 2(g)\n thereof. The question, therefore, is whether\nthe contract of service or \nRegulation 9(b)\n in derogation to\nthe Fundamental Rights guaranteed in Part III of the Consti-\ntution is valid in law and would be enforceable.\nContract whether changeable with changing times.\n\n 15. The law of contract, like the legal system itself,\ninvolves a balance between competing sets of values. Freedom\nof contract emphasises the need of stability, certainty and\npredictability. But, important as is values are, they are\nnot absolute, and there comes a point where they \"face a\nserious challenge\" against them must be set the values of\nprotecting the weak, oppressed and the thoughtless from\nimposition and oppressed. Naturally, at a particular time,\none set of value tends to be emphasised at the expense of\nthe other as the time changes the values get changed and the\nold values are under replacement and new values take their\ndue place. Though certainty and predictability in ordinary\ncommercial contract law is emphasised and insisted upon the\nneed for progress of the society and to removing the disa-\nbilities faced by the citizens and their relations when\nencounter with the State or its instrumentalities are in\nconflict with the assured constitutional rights demand new\nvalues and begin to assert themselves, for no civilised\nsystem of law can accept the implications of absolute sanc-\ntity of contractual obligations and of their immutability.\n In paragraph 4 of Chitty on Contracts (25th Edition,\nVolume-I) it is stated that \"freedom of contract is a rea-\nsonable social ideal only to the extent that equality of\nbargaining power between contracting parties can be assumed\nand no injury is done to the economic interest of the commu-\nnity at large.\n\n In Anson's Law of Contract at p. 6 & 7 stated the scope\nof freedom of contract in the changing circumstances thus:\n\n\"Today the position is seen in a very different light.\nFreedom of contract is a reasonable social ideal only to the\nextent that equality of bargaining power between contracting\nparties can be assumed, and no injury is done to the econom-\nic interests of the community at large. In the more compli-\ncated social and industrial conditions of a collectivist\nsociety it has ceased to have much idealistic attraction. It\nis now realised that economic equality often does not exists\nin any real sense, and that individual interests have to be\n\n304\n\nmade to subserve those of the community hence there has been\na fundamental change both in our social outlook and in the\npolicy of the legislature towards contract and the law today\ninterferes at numerous points with the freedom of the par-\nties to make what contract they like. The relation between\nemployers and employed, for example, have been regulated by\nstatutes designed to ensure that the employees condition of\nwork are safe, that he is properly protected against redun-\ndancy and that he knows his terms of service. The public has\nbeen protected against economic pressure by such measures as\nthe Rent Acts, the supply of goods (implied terms) at, the\nconsumer Credit Act and other similar enactments. These\nlegislative provisions will override any contrary terms\nwhich the parties may make for themselves. Further, the\nlegislature has intervened in the Restrictive Trade Practice\nAct 1956 and the Fair Trading Act, 1973 to promote competi-\ntion in industry and to safeguard the interests of consum-\ners. This intervention is specially necessary today when\nmost contracts entered by ordinary people are not the result\nof individual negotiation. It is not possible for a private\nperson to settle the terms of his agreement with a British\nRailways Board or with a local electricity authority.\nThe standard form' contract is the rule. He must either\naccept the terms of this contract in toto, or go without.\nSince, however, it is not feasible to deprive onself of such\nnecessary services, the individual is compelled to accept on\nthose terms. In view of this fact, it is quite clear that\nfreedom of contract is now largely an illusion.\n\n 16. The trinity of the Constitution assure to every\ncitizen Social and Economic Justice, Equality of Status and\nof opportunity with dignity of the person. The State is to\nstrive to minimise the inequality in income and eliminate\ninequality in status between individuals or groups of peo-\nple. The State has intervened with the freedom of contract\nand interposed by making statutory law like Rent Acts, Debt\nRelief Acts, Tenancy Acts, Social Welfare and Industrial\nLaws and Statutory Rules prescribing conditions of service\nand a host of other laws. All these Acts and Rules are made\nto further the social solidarity and as a step towards\nestablishing an egalitaran socialist order. This Court, as a\ncourt of constitutional conscience enjoined and a jealously\nto project and uphold new values in establishing the egali-\ntarian social order. As a court of constitutional function-\nary exercising equity juris-\n\n305\n\ndiction, this Court would relieve the weaker parties from\nunconstitutional contractual obligations, unjust, unfair,\noppressive and unconscienable rules or conditions when the\ncitizen is really unable to meet on equal terms with the\nState. It is to find whether the citizen, when entered into\ncontracts or service, was in distress need or compelling\ncircumstances to enter into contract on dotted lines or\nwhether the citizen was in a position of either to \"take it\nor leave it\" and if it finds to be so, this Court would not\nshirk to avoid the contract by appropriate declaration.\nTherefore, though certainty is an important value in normal\ncommercial contract law, it is not an absolute and immutable\none but is subject to change in the changing social condi-\ntions.\n\n 17. In Brojonath's case, Madan, J., elaborately consid-\nered the development of law relating to unfair or unreasona-\nble terms of the contract or clauses thereof in extenso and\nit is unnecessary for me to traverse the same grounds once\nover. The learned Judge also considered the arbitrary,\nunfair and unbridled power on the envil of distributive\njustice or justness or fairness of the procedure envisaged\ntherein. The relevant case law in that regard was dealt with\nin extenso in the light of the development of law in the\nSupreme Court of United States of America and the House of\nLords in England and in the continental countries. To avoid\nneedless burden on the judgment, I do not repeat the same\nreasoning. I entirely agree with the reasoning and the\nconclusions reached therein on all these aspects.\nWhether State can impose unconstitutional Conditions.\n\n 18. The problem also would be broached from the angle\nwhether the State can impose unconstitutional conditions as\npart of the contract or statute or rule etc. In 1959-60 73\nHarvard Law Review, in the Note under the Caption 'Unconsti-\ntutional Condition' at page 1595-96 it is postulated that\nthe State is devoid of power to impose unconstitutional\nconditions in the contract that the power to withhold lar-\ngess has been asserted by the State in four areas i.e., (1)\nregulating the right to engage in certain activities; (2)\nAdministration of Government welfare programme; (3) Govern-\nment employment; and (4) Procurement of contracts. It was\nfurther adumberated at pages 1602-1603 thus:\n\n\"The sovereign's constitutional authority to choose those\nwith whom it will contract for goods and services is in\neffect a power to withhold the benefits to be deprived from\neconomic dealings with the government. As government\n\n306\n\nactivity in the economic sphere increases, the contracting\npower enables the government to control many hitherto unreg-\nulated activities of contracting parties through the imposi-\ntion of conditions. Thus, regarding the government as a\nprivate entrepreneur threatens to impair constitutional\nrights ..... The Government, unlike a private individual,\nis limited in its ability to contract by the Constitution.\nThe federal contracting power is based upon the Constitu-\ntion's authorisation of these acts 'necessary and proper' to\nthe carrying out of the functions which it allocates to the\nnational government,--Unless the objectives sought by terms\nand conditions in government contracts requiring the surren-\nder of rights are constitutionally authorised, the condi-\ntions must fall as ultra vires exercise of power.\"\n\nAgain at page 1603, it is further emphasised thus:\n\n\"When conditions limit the economic benefits to be derived\nfrom dealings with the government to those who forego the\nexercise of constitutional rights, the exclusion of those\nretaining their rights from participation in the enjoyment\nof these benefits may be a violative of the prohibition,\nimplicit in the due process clause of fifth amendment and\nexplicit in the equal protection clause of the fourteenth\namendment against unreasonable discrimination in the Govern-\nmental bestow of advantages. Finally, disabling those exer-\ncising certain rights from participating in the advantages\nto be derived from contractual relations with the government\nmay be a form of penalty lacking in due process. To avoid\ninvalidation for any of the above reasons, it must be shown\nthat the conditions imposed are necessary to secure the\nlegitimate objectives of the contract ensure its effective\nuse, or protect society from the potential harm which may\nresult from the contractual relationship between the govern-\nment and the individual.\n\n 19. Professor Guido Calabresi of Yale University Law\nSchool in his \"Retroactivity, Paramount power and Contractu-\nal Changes\" ( 196 1-62) 71 Yale Law Journal P. 119 1 at\n1196) stated that the Government can make contracts that are\nnecessary and proper for carrying out any of the specific\nclauses of the Constitution or power to spend for general\nwelfare. The Federal Government has no power, inherent or\nsovereign, other than those specifically or explicitly\ngranted to it by\n\n307\n\nthe Constitution. At page 1197, it is further stated thus:\n\n\"The Government acts according to due process standards for\nthe due process clause is quite up to that task without the\nrule. Alterations of Government contracts are not desirable\nin a free country even when they do not constitute a 'tak-\ning' of property or impinge on questions of fundamental\nfairness of the type comprehended in due process. The gov-\nernment may make changes, but only if war or commerce re-\nquire them and not on the broader and more ephemeral grounds\nthat the general welfare would be served by the change. Any\nother rule would allow the Government to which almost at\nwill.\"\n\n 20. These principles were accepted and followed by the\nAndhra Pradesh High Court in V. Raghunadha Rao v. State of\nAndhra Pradesh, [1988] 2 A.L.T. 461 dealing with A.P. Stand-\nard specification Clauses 11, 29, 59, 62(b) and 73 and\ndeclared some clauses to be ultra vires of \nArticles 14\n,\n19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n of the Constitution and \nSections 23\n and \n27\n\nof the Contract Act.\n\n 21. In Brojonath's case (supra) after elaborate consid-\neration of the doctrine of \"reasonableness or fairness\" of\nthe terms and conditions of the contract vis-a-vis the\nrelative bargaining power of the contracting parties this\nCourt laid down that the principles deductable from the\ndiscussion made therein is in consonance with right or\nreason intended to secure socio-economic justice and con-\nforms to mandate of the equality clause in \nArticle 14.\n The\nprinciple laid was that courts will not enforce and will,\nwhen called upon to do so, strike down an unfair and unrea-\nsonable contact or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a\ncontract, entered into between parties who are not equal in\nbargaining power ..... It will apply to situations in\nwhich the weaker party is in a position in which he can\nobtain goods or services or means of livelihood only upon\nthe terms imposed by the stronger party or go without them.\nIt will also apply where a man has no choice, or rather no\nmeaningful choice, but to give his assent to a contract or\nto sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form\nor to accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however\nunfair, unreasonable and unconscienable a clause in that\ncontract or form or rules may be. This principle, however,\nwill not apply where the bargaining power of the contracting\nparties is equal or almost equal or where both parties are\nbusinessmen and the contract is a commercial transaction.\n\n308\n\n 22. In today's complex world of giant corporations with\ntheir vast infra-structural organisations and with the State\nthrough its instrumentalities and agencies has been entering\ninto almost every branch of industry and commerce and field\nof service, there can be myriad situations which result in\nunfair and unreasonable bargains between parties possess\nwholly disproportionate and unequal bargaining power. These\ncases can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The\ncourt must judge each case on its own facts and circum-\nstances.\n\nPublic policy whether changeable.\n\n 23. This Court also angulated the question from the\nperspective of public policy or contract being opposed to\npublic policy. The phrases \"public policy\", \"opposed to\npublic policy\", or \"contrary to public policy\" are incapable\nof precise definition. It is valued to meet the public good\nor the public interest. What is public good or in the public\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public\ngood or the public interest vary from time to time with the\nchange of the circumstances. New concepts take place of old\none. The transactions which were considered at one time as\nagainst public policy were held by the courts to be in\npublic interest and were found to be enforceable. Therefore,\nthis Court held in Brojonath's case that \"there has been no\nwell-recognised head of public policy, the courts have not\nshirked from extending it to new transactions and changed\ncircumstances and have at times not even flinched from\ninventing a new head of public.\"\n\n Lord Wright in his legal Essays and Addresses Vol. III\np. 76 and 78 stated that public policy like any other branch\nof the common law ought to be and I think is, governed by\nthe judicial use of precedents ..... If it is said that\nrules of public policy have to be moulded to suit new condi-\ntions of a changing world, that is true, but the same is\ntrue with the principles of the cannon law generally; Lord\nLindley held in Janson v. Driefontein Mines Ltd., [1902]\nA.C.p. 484 and 507 that \"a contract or other branch which is\nagainst public policy i.e. against the general interest of\nthe country is illegal.\"\n\n 24. In Anson's Law of Contract, 24th Edition by A.G.\nGuest at p.. 335 stated the scope of variability of public\npolicy attune to the needs of the day and the march of law\nthus:\n\n\"At the present time, however, there is an increasing recog-\nnition of the positive function of the Courts in matters\n\n309\n\nof public policy: 'The law relating to public policy cannot\nremain immutable. It must change with the passage of time.\nThe wind of change blows upon it'. Some aspects of public\npolicy are more susceptible to change than others, during\nthe policy of the law has, on certain subjects, been worked\ninto a set of tolerably definite rules. The principles\napplicable to agreements in restraint of trade, for example,\nhave on a number of occasions been modified or extended to\naccord with prevailing economic conditions, and this process\nstill continues.\n\n In law of Contract by G.H. Treitei, 7th Edition at p,\n366 on the topic 'scope of the public policy' it is stated\nthus:\n\n\"Public policy is a variable notion, depending on changing\nmanners, morals and economic conditions. In theory, this\nflexibility of the doctrine of public policy could provide a\njudge with an excuse for invalidating any contract which he\nviolently disliked. On the other hand, the law does adapt\nitself to change in economic and social conditions, as can\nbe seen particularly from the development of the rules as to\ncontracts in restraint of public policy has often been\nrecognised judicially. Thus Lord Haldane has said; \"What the\nlaw recognises as contrary to public policy turns out to\nvary greatly from time to time.\" And Lord Denning has put a\nsimilar point of view. \"with a good man in the saddle, the\nunruly horse can be kept in control. It can jump over obsta-\ncles.\" The present attitude of the Courts represents a\ncompromise between the flexibility inherent in the notion of\npublic policy and the need for certainty in commercial\naffairs.\"\n\n 25. From this perspective, it must be held that in the\nabsence of specific head of public policy which covers a\ncase, then the court must in consonance with public con-\nscience and in keeping with public good and public interest\ninvent new public policy and declare such practice or rules\nthat are derogatory to the constitution to be opposed to\npublic policy. The rules which stem from the public policy\nmust of necessity be laid to further the progress of the\nsociety in particular when social change is to bring about\nan egalitarian social order through rule of law. In deciding\na case which may not be covered by authority courts have\nbefore them the beacon light of the trinity of the Constitu-\ntion and the play of legal light and shade must lead on the\npath of justice social,\n\n310\n\neconomical and political. Lacking precedent, the court can\nalways be guided by that light and the guidance thus shed by\nthe trinity of our Constitution.\n\nPublic policy can be drawn from the Constitution.\n\n 26. Sutherland, in his Statutes and Statutory Construc-\ntion Third Edition Vol. 3 paragraph 5904 at page 13 1-132\nhas stated that the most reliable source of public policy is\nto be found in the federal and state constitutions. Since\nconstitutions are the superior law of the land, and because\none of their outstanding features is flexibility and capaci-\nty to meet changing conditions, constitutional policy pro-\nvides a valuable aid in determining the legitimate bound-\naries of statutory meaning. Thus public policy having its\ninception in constitutions may accomplish either a restrict-\ned or extended interpretation of the literal expression\n a statute. A statute is always presumed to be constitu-\ntional and where necessary a constitutional meaning will be\ninferred to preserve validity. Likewise, where a statute\ntends to extend or preserve a constitutional principle,\nreference to analogous constitutional provisions may be of\ngreat value in shaping the statute to accord with the statu-\ntory aim or objective.\n\nArticle 14\n sheds the light to public policy to curb arbi-\ntrariness.\n\n 26A. \nIn \nBasheshar Nath v. The Commissioner of Income-Tax\n& Anr.\n, [1959] Suppl. 1 SCR 528 S.R. Das, CJ., held that\n\nArticle 14\n is founded on a sound public policy recognised\nand valued in all States and it admonishes the State when it\ndisregards the obligations imposed upon the State.\n 26B.\n \nIn \nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ant.\n,\n[1974] 2 SCR 348 Bhagwati. J. (as he then was) held that\n\nArticle 14\n is the genus while \nArticle 16\n is a specie. Arti-\ncle 16 gives effect to the doctrine of equality in all\nmatters relating to public employment. The basic principle\nwhich. therefore, informs both \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n is equali-\nty and inhibition against discrimination. \"Equality is a\ndynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it\ncannot be \"cribbed, cabined and confined\" within traditional\nand doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view.\nequality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality\nand arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule\nof law in a republic while the other, to the whim and ca-\nprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it\nis implicit in it that it is unequal both according to\npolitical logic and constitutional law and is therefore\n\n311\n\nviolative of \nArticle 14\n, and if it affects any matter relat-\ning to public employment, it is also violative of Article\n\n16. \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n strike at arbitrariness in State\naction and ensure fairness and equality of treatment. In\nMenaka Gandhi's case it was further held that the principle\nof reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically,\nis an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness\npervades \nArticle 14\n like a brooding omnipresence. In Rama-\nna's case it was held that it is merely a judicial formula\nfor determining whether the legislative or. executive action\nin question is arbitrary and therefore constituting denial\nof equality. If the classification is not reasonable and\ndoes not satisfy the two conditions namely, rational rela-\ntion and nexus the impugned legislative or executive action\nwould plainly be arbitrary and the guarantees of equality\nunder \nArticle 14\n would be breached. Wherever, therefore,\nthere is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of\nlegislature or of the executive or of an \"authority\" under\n\nArticle 12\n, \nArticle 14\n, \"immediately springs into action and\nstrikes down such State action.\" In fact, the concept of\nreasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the entire\nconstitutional scheme and is a golden thread which runs\nthrough the whole of the fabric of the constitution.\n\n 27. In Volga Tellies'Case it was held that the Constitu-\ntion is not only paramount law of the land but also it is a\nsource of sustenance of all laws. Its provisions are con-\nceived in public interest and are intended to serve public\npurpose. Therefore, when the provisions of an Act or Regula-\ntions or Rules are assailed as arbitrary, unjust, unreasona-\nble, unconstitutional, public law element makes it incumbent\nto consider the validity there'of on the envil of inter play\nof Arts. 14', 16(1), 19(1)(g) and 21 and of the inevitable\neffect of the impugned provision on the rights of a citizen\nand to find whether they are constitutionally valid.\nInterplay of Arts. 14, 16(1), 19(1)(g) & 21 as guarantors of\npublic employment as a source of right to livelihood.\n\n 28. It is well settled constitutional law that different\nArticles in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and the Direc-\ntive Principles in Part IV of the Constitution must be read\nas an integral and incorporeal whole with possible overlap-\nping with the subject-matter of what is to be protected by\nits various provisions particularly the Fundamental Rights.\n By the Full Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India,\n[1970] 3 SCR 530 it was held that the law must not impair\nthe guarantee of any\n\n312\n\nof the fundamental rights in Part-III. The law authorising\nto impose reasonable restrictions under \nArticle 19(1)\n must\nbe intended to advance the larger public interest. Under the\nConstitution, protection against impairment of the guarantee\nof the fundamental rights is determined by the nature of the\nright, interest of the aggrieved party and the degree of\nharm resulting from the state action. Impairment of the\nright of the individual and not the object of the State in\ntaking the impugned action is the measure of protection. To\nconcentrate merely on the power of the State and the object\nof the State action in exercising that power is, therefore,\nto ignore the true intent of the constitution. The nature\nand content of the protection of the fundamental rights is\nmeasured not by the operation of the State action upon the\nrights of the individual but by its objects. The validity of\nthe State action must be adjudged in the light of its opera-\ntion upon the rights of the individuals or groups of the\nindividual in all their dimensions. It is not the object of\nthe authority making the law imparing the right of the\ncitizen nor the form of action taken that determines the\nprotection he can claim; it is the effect of the law and of\nthe action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of\nthe court to grant relief. \nIn \nMinerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of\nIndia\n, [1981] 1 SCR 206 the fundamental rights and directive\nprinciples are held to be the conscience of the Constitution\nand disregard of either would upset the equibalance built up\ntherein.\n In Menaka Gandhi's case, it was held that different\narticles in the chapter of Fundamental Rights of the Consti-\ntution must be read as an. integral whole, with possible\noverlapping of the subject matter of what is sought to be\nprotected by its various provisions particularly by articles\nrelating to fundamental rights contained in Part III of the\nConstitution do not represent entirely separate streams of\nrights which do not mingle at many points. They are all\nparts of an integrated scheme in the Constitution. Their\nwaters must mix to constitute that grand flow of unimpeded\nand impartial justice; social, economic and political, and\nof equality of status and opportunity which imply absence of\nunreasonable or unfair discrimination between individuals or\ngroups or classes. The fundamental rights protected by Part\nIII of the constitution, out of which \nArticles 14\n, 19\n and \n21\n\nare the most frequently invoked to test the validity of\nexecutive as well as legislative actions when these actions\nare subjected to judicial scrutiny. Fundamental Rights are\nnecessary means to develop one's own personality and to\ncarve out one's own life in the manner one likes best,\nsubject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the paramount\ninterest of the Society and to a just, fair and reasonable\nprocedure. The effect of restriction or deprivation and not\nof the form adopted to deprive the right is the conclusive\ntest. It is already seen that the right to a public employ-\n\n313\n\nment is a constitutional right under \nArt. 16(1).\n All matters\nrelating to employment include the right to continue in\nservice till the employee reaches superannuation or his\nservice is duly terminated in accordance with just, fair and\nreasonable procedure prescribed under the provisions of the\nConstitution or the Rules made under proviso to \nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution or the statutory provision or the Rules,\nregulations or instructions having statutory flavour made\nthereunder, But the relevant provisions must be conformable\nto the rights guaranteed in Parts III & IV of the Constitu-\ntion, \nArticle 21\n guarantees the_ right to live which in-\ncludes right to livelihood, to a many the assured tenure of\nservice is the source, the deprivation thereof must be in\naccordance with the procedure prescribed by law conformable\nto the mandates of \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n as be fair, just and\nreasonable but not fancyful oppressive or at vagary. The\nneed for the fairness, justness or reason ableness of the\nprocedure was elaborately considered in Menaka Gandhi's case\n(supra) and it hardly needs reiteration.\n\nPrinciples of natural justice in Part of \nArticle 14.\n\n 29. The Menaka Gandhi's case is also an authority for\nthe proposition that the principles of natural justice is an\nintegral part of the guarantee of equality assured by Arti-\ncle 14 of the Constitution. \nIn \nUnion of India & Anr. v.\nTulsiram Patel & Ors.\n, [1985] Suppl. 2 SCR 13 1 at 233, this\nCourt held that the principles of natural justice have thus\ncome to be recognised as being a part of the guarantee\ncontained in \nArticle 14\n because of the new and dynamic\ninterpretation given by this Court to the concept of equali-\nty which is the subject-matter of that Article. Shortly put,\nthe syllogism runs thus:\n\n\"Violation of a rule of natural justice results in arbi-\ntrariness which is the same as discrimination; where dis-\ncrimination is the result of the State action, it is a\nviolation of \nArt. 14\n, therefore, a violation of a principle\nof natural justice by a State action is a violation of Art-\n\n14. \nArticle 14\n, however; is not the sole repository of the\nprinciples of natural justice. What it does is to guarantee\nthat any law or State action violating them will be struck\ndown. The principles of natural justice, however, apply not\nonly to the legislation and State action but also where any\ntribunal, authority or body of men, not coming within the\ndefinition of 'State' in \nArt. 12\n, is charged with the duty\nof deciding a matter. In such a case, the principles of\nnatural justice require that it must decide such a matter\nfairly and impartially.\"\n\n314\n\n In Moti Ram Deka's case this Court already held that \"the\nrule making authority contemplated by \nArticle 309\n cannot be\nvalidly exercised so as to curtail or affect the rights\nguaranteed to public servants under \nArt. 311(2).\n \nArticle\n311(2)\n is intended to afford a sense of scrutiny to public\nservants who are substantively appointed to a permanent post\nand one of the principle benefits which they are entitled to\nexpect is the benefit of pension after rendering public\nservice for the period prescribed by the Rules. It would, we\nthink, not be legitimate to contend that the right to earn a\npension to which a servant substantively appointed to a\npermanent post is entitled can be curtailed by Rules framed\nunder \nArt. 309\n so as to make the said right either ineffec-\ntive or illusory. Once the scope of \nArt. 311(1)\n and \n(2)\n is\nduly determined, it must be held that no rule framed under\n\nArt. 309\n can trespass on the rights guaranteed by \nArt. 311.\n\nThis position is of basic importance and must be borne in\nmind in dealing with the controversy in question.\n\n 30. In A.K. Kraipak & Ors etc. v. Union of India & Ors.,\n[1970] 1 SCR 457 this Court held that Rules of natural\njustice aims at securing justice or to prevent injustice.\nThey operate only in the areas not covered by any law valid-\nly made. \nIn \nUnion of India v. Col\n. J.N. Sinha and Anr., [197\n1] 1 SCR 791 it was held that principles of natural justice\ndo not supplant the law but supplement it. If a statutory\nprovision either specifically or by necessary implication\nexcludes the application of any rules of natural justice\nthen the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature\nor the statutory authority and read into the concerned\nprovision of the principles of natural justice. In that case\nthis Court held that principles of natural justice cannot be\nread into Fundamental Rule and no opportunity need be given\nbefore compulsorily retiring an employee as that implication\ndoes not arise by reason of express statutory language.\n\n 31. The principle of natural justice embodied as an\nintegral part of equality clause. \nArticle 14\n is the general\nprinciple while \nArt. 311(2)\n is a special provision applica-\nble to all civil services under the State. \nArticle 311(2)\n\nembodies the principles of natural justice but proviso to\nClause (2) of \nArt. 311\n excludes the operation of principles\nof natural justice engrafted in \nArt. 311(2)\n as an exception\nin the given circumstances enumerated in three clauses of\nthe proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n of the Constitution. \nArticle 14\n\nread with Arts. 16(1) and 311 are to be harmoniously inter-\npreted that the proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n excludes the applica-\ntion of the principles of natural justice as an exception;\nand the applicability of \nArt. 311(2)\n must, therefore, be\ncircumscribed to the civil services and to be construed\naccordingly. In respect of all other\n\n315\n\nemployees covered by \nArt. 12\n of the Constitution the dynamic\nrole of \nArt. 14\n and other relevant Articles like 21 must be\nallowed to have full play without any inhibition, unless the\nstatutory rules themselves, consistent with the mandate of\nArts. \n14, 16, 19 & 21 provide, expressly such an exception.\n \nArticle 19(1)(g)\n empowers every citizen right to avoca-\ntion or profession etc., which includes right to be contin-\nued in employment under the State unless the tenure is\nvalidly terminated consistent with the scheme enshrined in\nthe fundamental rights of the Constitution. Therefore, if\nany procedure is provided for deprivation of the right to\nemployment or right to the continued employment till the age\nof superannuation as is a source to right to livelihood,\nsuch a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable. This\nCourt in \nFertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri\n& Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, [1981] 2 SCR 52 at 60-61\nheld that \nArt. 19(1)(g)\n confers a broad and general right\nwhich is available to all persons to do works of any partic-\nular kind and of their choice. Therefore, whenever there is\narbitrariness in state action--whether it be of the legisla-\nture or of the Executive or of an authority under \nArt. 12\n,\nArts. 14 and 21 spring into action and strikes down such an\naction. The concept of reasonableness and nonarbitrariness\npervades the entire constitutional spectrum and is a golden\nthread which runs through the whole fabric of the Constitu-\ntion. Therefore, the provision of the statute, the regula-\ntion or the rule which empowers an employer to terminate the\nservices of an employee whose service is of an indefinite\nperiod till he attains the age of superannuation, by serving\na notice of pay in lieu thereof must be conformable to the\nmandates of Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution.\nOtherwise per se it would be void.\n In Motiram Deka's case,\nGajendragadkhar, J-, (as he then was) after invalidating the\nrules 149(3) and 148(3) under \nArt. 311(2)\n which impari\nmateria Rule 9(b) of the Regulation also considered their\nvalidity in the light of \nArt. 14\n and held thus:\n\n\"Therefore, we are satisfied that the challenge to the\nvalidity of the impugned Rules on the ground that they\ncontravene \nArt. 14\n must also succeed.\"\n\nThis was on the test of reasonable classification as the\nprinciple then was applied. Subba Rao, J., (as he then was)\nin a separate but concurrent judgment, apart from. invali-\ndating the rule under \nArticle 311(2)\n also held that the Rule\ninfringed \nArticle 14\n as well, though there is no elaborate\ndiscussion in that regard. But, Das Gupta, J., considered\n\n316\n\nelaborately on this aspect and held:\n\n\"Applying the principle laid down in the above case to the\npresent rule, I find on the scrutiny of the Rule that it\ndoes not lay down any principle or policy for guiding the\nexercise of discretion by the authority who will terminate\nthe service in the matter of selection or classification.\nArbitrary and uncontrolled power is left in the authority to\nselect at its will any person against whom action will be\ntaken. The Rule, thus enables the authority concerned to\ndiscriminate between two railway servants to both of whom R.\n148(3) equally applied by taking action in one case and not\ntaking it in the other. In the exercise of the discretion by\nthe authority the rule has therefore to be struck down as\ncontravening the requirements of \nArt. 14\n of the Constitu-\ntion.\"\n\n \n32. Even in \nTulsiram Patel\n's case (supra) this Court\ndeclared that it must satisfy the test of justness, fairness\nand reasonableness of the procedure prescribed. But the\nproviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n was upheld for the reason that the\nConstitution itself made proviso--an exception to the prin-\nciple of audi alteram partem engrafted in \nArt. 311(2)\n of the\nConstitution. As a fact, it expressed thus:\n\n\"As the making of such laws and the framing of such rules\nare subject to the provisions of the Constitution, if any\nsuch act or rules violates any of the provisions of the\nConstitution, it would be void. Thus, as held in Moti Ram\nDeka's case AIR 1964 SC 600 if any such act or rule tres-\npasses on the rights guaranteed to government servants by\n\nArt. 311\n, it would be void. Similarly, such acts and rules\ncannot abridge or restrict the pleasure of the President or\nthe Governor of a State exercisable under \nArt. 3 10(1)\n\nfurther than what the Constitution has expressly done. In\nthe same way, such Act or rule would be void if it violates\nany fundamental right guaranteed by part III of the Consti-\ntution.\"\n\n \nGurdev Singh\n's case declares the rules that empowered to\norder compulsory retirement of the Government employee after\nputting ten years of service as ultra vires. In S.S. Muley\nv.J.R.D. Tata, [1979] 2 SLR 438 (Bombay) my learned brother\nSawant, J. (as he then was) held that \nRegulation 48\n which\nempowered the employer uncanalised, unrestricted and arbi-\ntrary power to terminate the service of an employee with\nnotice or pay in lieu thereof without any opportunity of\n\n317\n\nhearing as violative of principles of natural justice under\n\nArt. 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n In Superintendent of Post Office v.K. Vasayya, [1984] 3\nAndhra Pradesh Law Journal 9 the respondent Vasayya was\ndenied of the appointment as a Clerk on the ground that the\nConfidential Reports submitted by the Police disclosed\nadverse comments on the conduct of the respondent. When the\nappointment was denied on that basis it was held that though\nthe selection to a public office is a privilege and no\nvested right has been accrued till the candidate is appoint-\ned, in the context of fair play in action subserving the\nmandate of \nArt. 14\n held at p. 45 thus:\n\n\"Often times, convenience and justice are not on speaking\nterms. It is the actual administration of law and not only\nthe manner in which it is done that reflects the action of\nthe State in assuring the equal protection to a citizen. In\nadopting the procedure, as held by Frankfurther, J. in Joint\nAnti Facist Refugee Commission v. Mc. Grath, 34 1 US 123\nthat a conclusion satisfies one's private conscience does\nnot attest its reliability. The validity and moral authority\nof a conclusion largely depends on the mode by which it was\nreached. Secrecy is not congenial to truth. Seeking and\nself-righteousness gives too slander an assurance of right-\nness. No better instrument has been devised for arriving at\nthe truth than to give a person in jeopardy of a serious\nloss, a notice of the case against him and an opportunity to\nmeet it, nor has a better way been found for generating the\nfeeling so important to a popular Government that justice\nhas been done.\"\n\n Bradley, J. in United States v. Samuel D. singleton,\n[1981] 109 US 3 has held that:\n\n\"No State shall make or enforce any law which abrogate the\nprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\"\n\nIn \nRamana\n's case (supra), it has been held that:\n\n is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed\nby the rule of law, the executive Govt. or any of its offi-\ncers should possess arbitrary power over the interests of\nthe individual .....\n\n318\n\nThe procedure adopted should match with what justice de-\nmands. History shows that it is always subtle and insidious\nencroachments made ostensibly for a good cause that imper-\nceptibly but surely erode the foundations of liberty.\"\n Doughlas, J. in Joint Anti Facist Refugee Commission's\ncase (supra) held that:\n\n\"This is a Government of laws not of men. The powers being\nused are the powers of the Government over the reputation\nand fortunes of citizens. In situations far less severe or\nimportant than those a party is told the nature of the\ncharge against him.\"\n\n Harry W. Jones in his \"Rule of law and Welfare State\",\n1958 Columbia Law Review, 143 at 146 stated that:\n\n\"What is needed then is to make the welfare state itself a\nsource of new \"rights\" and to surround the \"rights\" in\npublic benefaction with legal safeguards both procedural and\nsubstantive comparable to those enjoyed by the traditional\nright of property in our law.\"\n\nAccordingly it was held that prior opportunity of hearing\nbefore denying appointment is a mandate of \nArt. 14\n of the\nConstitution.\n\n \nIn \nWest Bengal Electricity Board & Ors. v. D.B. Ghosh &\nOrs.\n, [1985] 2 SCR 1014 in similar circumstances, it was\nheld that the regulation as \"Herry VIII Clause as ultra\nvires of \nArt. 14\n of the Constitution.\n The same principle was\nreiterated in Brojonath's case.\n\n \nIn \nWorkman of Hindustan Steel Ltd. & Anr. v.

Bhandari v. Indian\nTourism Development Corpn. Ltd. & Ors.\n, [1986] 4 SCC 337\nstruck down the similar rule on the same doctrine of 'hire\nand fire' and that it is impermissible under the constitu-\ntion of the scheme to sustain the doctrine of 'hire and\nfire'.\n In Chandrabhan's case, Rule 15(1)(ii)(b) of Bombay\nService Rule was held to be void. In A.P.S.R.T.

SCC.\n643 this Court struck down regulation 10(2)(a) of the Gurg-\naon Gramin Bank (Staff) Services Rules, 1980. In this light\nit is not open to the State to contend that \"look here;\nthough Constitution enjoins and admonishes us saying that it\nis no longer open to the State to make law or rule violating\nthe rights created under Arts. 14 and 21, the citizen, with\na view to secure public employment from us had contracted\nout of the constitutional rights and agreed to abide by\nrules including the termination of his/her services at any\ntime at our will without notice or opportunity even for\nmisconduct, negligence, inefficiency, corruption or rank\nnepotism, so we are free to impose the said punishment.\"\n\nEven in the case of minority institutions, when the employ-\nees are dismissed on the principle of hire and fire, this\nCourt held it to be impermissible vide \nAll Saints High\nSchool v.

State of Bihar\n, [1962] Suppl. 3\nSCR 369. Rule 4A of the Bihar Government Servants' Conduct\nRules, 1956, in so far as it prohibited any form of demon-\nstration was struck down by this Court as being violative of\nsub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (1) of \nArt. 19.\n \nIn \nO.K.\nGhosh v. EZX Joseph\n, [1963] Suppl. 1 SCR 789 this Court\n'struck down Rule 4A of the Central Civil Services (Conduct\nRules), 1955, on the ground that it violated sub-clause (c)\nof clause (1) of \nArt. 19\n of the Constitution and that por-\ntion of Rule 4A which prohibited participation in any demon-\nstration as being violative of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of\nclause (1) of \nArticle 19.\n It must, therefore, be hold that\nany act or provision therein, Rules or Regulations or\n\n320\n\ninstructions having statutory force violating fundamental\nrights under \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n, 19(1)(g)\n and \n21\n are void.\n\n 33. Thus it could be hold that \nArt. 14\n read with 16(1)\naccords right to an equality or an equal treatment consist-\nent with the principles of natural justice. Any law made or\naction taken by the employer, corporate statutory or instru-\nmentality under \nArticle 12\n must act fairly, justly and\nreasonably. Right to fair treatment is an essential inbuilt\nof natural justice. Exercise of unbridled and uncanalised\ndiscretionary power impinges upon the right of the citizen;\nvesting of discretion is no wrong provided it is exercised\npurposively judiciously and without prejudice. Wider the\ndiscretion, the greater the chances of abuse. Absolute\ndiscretion is destructive of freedom. than of man's other\ninventions. Absolute discretion marks the beginning of the\nend of the liberty. The conferment of absolute power to\ndismiss a permanent employee is antithesis to justness or\nfair treatment. The exercise of discretionary power wide of\nmark would bread arbitrary, unreasonable or unfair actions\nand would not be consistent with reason and justice. The\nprovisions of a statute, regulations or rules that empower\nan employer or the 'management to dismiss, remove or reduce\nin rank of an employee, must be consistent with just, rea-\nsonable and fair procedure. It would, further, be held that\nright to public employment which includes right to continued\npublic employment till the employee is superannuated as per\nrules or compulsorily retired or duly terminated in accord-\nance with the procedure established by law is an integral\npart of right to livelihood which in turn is an integral\nfacet of right to life assured by \nArt. 21\n of the Constitu-\ntion. Any procedure prescribed to deprive such a right to\nlivelihood or continued employment must be just, fair and\nreasonable procedure. In other words an employee in a public\nemployment also must not be arbitrarily unjustly and unrea-\nsonably be deprived of his/her livelihood which is ensured\nin continued employment till it is terminated in accordance\nwith just, fair and reasonable procedure. Otherwise any law\nor rule in violation thereof is void.\n\nNeed for harmony between social interest and individual\nright\n\n \n34. Undoubtedly efficiency of the administration and\nthe discipline among the employees is very vital to the\nsuccessful functioning of an institution or maximum produc-\ntion of goods or proper maintenance of the services. Disci-\npline in that regard among the employees is its essential\nfacet and has to be maintained. The society is vitally\ninterested in the due discharge of the duties by the govern-\nment employees or\n\n321\n\nemployees of corporate bodies'or statutory authorities or\ninstrumentalities under \nArt. 12\n of the Constitution. As held\nin \nTulsiram Patel\n's case the public are vitally interested\nin the efficiency and integrity of the public service. The\ngovernment or corporate employees are, after all, paid from\nthe public exchequer to which everyone contributes either by\nway of direct or indirect taxes. The employees are charged\nwith public duty and they should perform their public duties\nwith deep sense of responsibility. The collective responsi-\nbility of all the officers from top most to the lowest\nmaximises the efficient public administration. They must,\ntherefore, be held to have individual as well as collective\nresponsibility in discharge of their duties faithfully,\nhonestly with full dedication and utmost devotion to duty\nfor the progress of the country. Equally the employees must\nalso have a feeling that they have security of tenure. They\nshould also have an involvement on their part in the organi-\nsation or institution, corporation, etc. They need assurance\nof service and they need protection. The public interest and\nthe public good demand, that those who discharge their\nduties honestly, efficiently and with a sense of devotion\nand dedication to duty should receive adequate protection\nand security of tenure. Equally inefficient, dishonest and\ncorrupt or who became security risk should be weeded out so\nthat successful functioning of the industry or manufacture\nof the goods or rendering or services would be available at\nthe maximum level to the society and society thereby re-\nceives optimum benefit from the public money expanded on\nthem as salary and other perks. Therefore, when a situation\nenvisaged under statute or statutory rule or regulation or\ninstructions having statutory force to remove or dismiss an\nemployee the question arises whether they need at least\nminimum protection of fair play in action.\n\n 34A. \nIn \nVasayya\n's case when a similar contention was\nraised I have stated at p. 47 in Para 130 & 13 1 that.\n The Audi alteram partem rule must be flexible; malleable\nand an adaptable concept to adjust and harmonise the need\nfor speed and obligation to act fairly. When the rights of\nthe Government are widely stressed, the rights of the person\nare often threatened, when the latter are ever emphasised\nGovernment becomes weak to keep order. Therefore, the rule\ncan be tailored and the measure of its application cut short\nin reasonable proportion to the exigencies of the situation.\nThe administrative agency can develop a technique of deci-\nsion worthy being called \"ethos of adjudication\". Meaningful\nstatutory standards, realistic procedural requirements and\ndiscriminatory techniques of judicial review are among the\ntools to control the discretionary\n\n322\n\npower. It makes no difference whether the occasion for the\nexercise of power is personal default or act of policy. Good\nadministration demands fair consultation in each case and\nthis the law can and should enforce. The insistence of the\nobservance of fundamental fairness in the procedure becomes\na balancing balm to alleviate apprehension of arbitrary\ndecision by the executive Government while assuring opportu-\nnity to disabuse the prima facie impression formed against\nthe person to usher in a era of largest good to largest\nnumber of people with proper checks and balances between\nneeds of the State and the rights of the individual. The\nbrooding omni benevolence and omnicompetency of the need for\nexpediency and claim for justness interplay ethos of fair\nadjudication in action.\n\n 34B. Therefore, it is no well tuned solace to say that\nin a court of law at the fag end of the currier or after\nsuperannuation in the interregnum which often over takes the\nlitigation, that the employee would be meted out with jus-\ntice (a grave uncertainty and exposing to frustrating pro-\ncrastination of judicial process and expenses and social\nhumiliation). Before depriving an employee of the means of\nlivelihood to himself and his dependents, i.e. job, the\nprocedure prescribed for such deprivation must, therefore,\nbe just, fair and reasonable under Arts. 21 and 14 and when\ninfringes \nArt. 19(1)(g)\n must be subject to imposing reasona-\nble restrictions under \nArt. 19(5).\n Conferment of power on a\nhigh rank officer is not always an assurance, in particular\nwhen the moral standards are generally degenerated that the\npower would be exercised objectively, reasonably, conscien-\ntiously, fairly and justly without inbuilt protection to an\nemployee. Even officers who do their duty honestly and\nconscientiously are subject to great pressures and pulls.\nTherefore, the competing claims of the \"public interest\" as\nagainst \"individual interest\" of the employees are to be\nharmoniously blended so as to serve the societal need con-\nsistent with the constitutional scheme.\n\nStatutory Construction:\n\n 35. Statutory construction raises a presumption that an\nAct or a provision therein a constitutionally valid unless\nit appears to be ultra vires or invalid. The legislature,\nsubject to the provisions of the Constitution, has undoubt-\nedly unlimited powers to make law. In fairness to the\nlearned Attorney General, he agrees that the impugned provi-\nsions are per se invalid. But he attempted to salvage them\nby resorting to the doctrine of reading down.\n\n323\n\nReading a provision down when permissible.\n\n The question emerges whether the doctrine of reading\ndown would be applied to avoid a void law vesting with\narbitrary power with a naked hire and fire draconian rule.\nIt is difficult to give acceptance to extreme contention\nraised by Sri Garg and Sri Rama Murthy that the Courts\ncannot in the process of interpretation of the Statute would\nnot make law but leave it to the legislature for necessary\namendments. In an appropriate case Judges would articulate\nthe inarticulate major premise and would give life and force\nto a Statute by reading harmoniously all the provisions\nironing out the freezes. But the object is to alongate the\npurpose of the Act. In this regard 1 respectfully agree with\nmy learned brother, my Lord the Chief Justice, on the prin-\nciple of statutory construction. The question is whether\nLegislature intended to confer absolute power or would it be\nconstrued in such a way that would supplant the law but not\nsupplement law made by the Legislature.\n\n35A. Natural construction.\n\n The golden rule of statutory construction is that the\nwords and phrases or sentences should be construed according\nto the intent of legislature that passed the Act. All the\nprovisions should be read together. If the words of the\nstatutes are in themselves precise and unambiguous, the\nwords, or phrases or sentences themselves alone do, then no\nmore can be necessary than to expound those words or phrases\nor sentences in their natural and ordinary sense. But if any\ndoubt arises from the terms employed by the legislature, it\nhas always been held a safe means of collecting the inten-\ntion, to call in aid the ground and cause of making the\nstatute, and to have the recourse to the preamble, which is\na key to open the minds of the makers of the statute and the\nmischiefs which the Act intend to redress. In determining\nthe meaning of statute the first question to ask always is\nwhat is the natural or ordinary meaning of that word or\nphrase in its context. It is only when that meaning leads to\nsome result which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been\nthe intent of the legislature then it is proper to look for\nsome other possible meaning then the court cannot go fur-\nther.\n\n 35. Craie's Statute Law, Seventh Edition in Chapter 5,\nat page 64 it is stated that where the words of an Act are\nclear, there is no need for applying any of the principles\nof interpretation which are merely presumptions in cases of\nambiguity in the statute. The safer and more correct course\nof dealing with the question of construction is to take\n\n324\n\nthe words themselves and arrive, if possible, at their\nmeaning without in the first place refer to cases. Where an\nambiguity arises to supposed intention of the legislature,\none of the statutory constructions, the court profounded is\nthe doctrine. of reading down. Lord Reid in Federal Steam\nNavigation Co. v. Department of Trade and Industry, [1974] 2\nAll E.R. 97 at p. 100 (as also extracted by Cross Statutory\nInterpretation, Butterworths' Edition, 1976 at page 43 in\npreposition 3) has stated thus:\n\n\"the judge may read in words which he considers to be neces-\nsarily implied by words which are already in the statute and\nhe has a limited power to add to, alter or ignore statutory\nwords in order to prevent a provision from being unintelli-\ngible, absured or totally unreasonable, unworkable, or\ntotally irre-concileabIe with the rest of the statute.\"\n\n \nAt page 92 of the Cross Statutory Interpretation, the\nauthor has stated that \"The power to add to, alter or ignore\nstatutory words is an extremely limited one. Generally\nspeaking it can only be exercised where there has been a\ndemonstrable mistake on the part of the draftsman or where\nthe consequence of applying the words in their ordinary, 6r\ndiscernible secondary, meaning would be utterly unreasona-\nble. Even then the mistake may be thought to be beyond\ncorrection by the court, or the tenor of the statute may be\nsuch as to preclude the addition of words to avoid an unrea-\nsonable result.\" Therefore, the Doctrine of Reading Down is\nan internal aid to construe the word or phrase in statute to\ngive reasonable meaning, but not to detract distort or\nemasculate the language so as to give the supposed purpose\nto avoid unconstitutionality\n 35C. This Court in \nSaints High School, Hyderabad v.\nGovt. of A.P.\n, [1980] 2 SCR 924 held that:\n\n\"this Court has in several cases adopted the reading down\nthe provisions of the Statute. The reading down of a provi-\nsion of a statute puts into operation the principle that so\nfar as is reasonably possible to do so, the legislation\nshould be construed as being within its power. It is the\nprinciple effect that where an Act is expressed in language\nof a generality which makes it capable, if read literally,\nof applying to matters beyond relevant legislative power,\nthe Court would construe it in a more limited sense so as to\nkeep it within the power.\"\n\n325\n\nSimilarly restricted meaning was ascribed by Maxwell in his\nInterpretation of the Statutes XII Edn. at p. 109 under the\ncaption \"Restriction of operation\" that sometimes to keep\nthe Act within the limits of its scope and not to disturb\nthe existing law beyond what the object requires, it is\nconstrued as operative between certain purposes only even\nthough the language expresses no such circumspection of\nfield of operation.\n\n 36. It is, thus, clear that the object of reading down\nis to keep the operation of the statute within the purpose\nof the Act and consitutionally valid. \nIn this regard it is\nequally of necessity to remind ourselves as held by this\nCourt in \nMinerva Mills\n' case that when the effect of \nArt. 31\n\nwas asked to be read down so as to save it from unconstitu-\ntionality this Court held that it is not permissible to read\ndown the statutory provisions when the avowed purpose is to\nconfer power on an authority without any limitation whatever\nand that at p. 259D and G it was held that the principle of\nreading down cannot be used to distort when words of width\nare used even advertantly.\n In Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v.\nUnited States. 398 U.S. 333 (26 Lawyer's Edition 2nd, 308 at\n\n327) Herfan, J. at 327 held that \"when the plain thrust of a\nlegislative enactment can only be circumvented by distortion\nto avert constitutional collision, it can only by exalting\nform over substance that one can justify veering of the path\nthat has been plainly marked by the Statute. Such a course\nbetrays extreme skepticism as to constitutionality and in\nthis instance reflects a groping to preserve conscientious\nobjecter exemption at all costs I cannot subscribe wholly to\nemasculated construction of a statute to avoid facing con-\nstitutional question in purported fidelity to the statutory\ndoctrine of avoiding unnecessary resolution of constitution-\nal issues.\"\n\n 36A. \nIn \nNalinakhya Bysack v. Shyam Sunder Haldar & Ors.\n,\n[1953] SCR 533 at 544-45 this Court has refused to rewrite\nlegislation to make up omissions of the Legislature.\n\n In Moti Ram Deka's case when Rule 148(3) and Rule 149(3)\nof the Railway Establishment Code were sought to be sus-\ntained on the 'principle of reading down', this court held\nthus:\n\n\"There is one more point which still remains to be consid-\nered and that is the point of construction. The learned\nAddl. Solicitor General argued that in construing the im-\npugned R. 148(3) as well as R. 149(3), we ought to take into\naccount the fact that the Rule as amended has been so\n\n326\n\nframed as to avoid conflict with or non-compliance of, the\nprovisions of \nArt. 311(2)\n, and so, he suggests that we\nshould adopt that interpretation of the Rule which would be\nconsistent with \nArt. 311(2).\n The argument is that the termi-\nnation of services permissible under the impugned rules\nreally proceeds on administrative grounds or considerations\nof exigencies of service. If, for instance, the post held by\na permanent servant is abolished, or the whole of the cadre\nto which the post belonged is brought to an end and the\nrailway servant's services are terminated in consequence,\nthat cannot amount his removal because the termination of\nhis service is not based on any consideration personal to\nthe servant. In support of this argument, the Addl. Solici-\ntor General wants us to test the provision contained in the\nlatter portion of the impugned rules. We are not impressed\nby this argument. What are not impressed by this argument.\nWhat the latter portion of the impugned Rules provide is\nthat in case a railway servant is dealt with under that\nportion, no notice need be served on him. The first part of\nthe Rules can reasonably and legitimately take in all cases\nand may be used even in respect of cases falling under the\nlatter category, provided, of course, notice for the speci-\nfied period or salary in lieu of such notice is given to the\nrailway servant. There is no doubt that on a fair construc-\ntion, the impugned Rules authorise the Railway Administra-\ntion to terminate the services of all the permanent servants\nto whom the Rules apply merely on giving notice for the\nspecified period or on payment of salary in lieu thereof and\nthat clearly amounts to the removal of the servant in ques-\ntion. Therefore, we are satisfied that the impugned rules\nare invalid inasmuch as they are inconsistent with the\nprovisions contained in \nArt. 311(2).\n The termination of the\npermanent servant's tenure which is authorised by the said\nRules is no more and no less than their removal from serv-\nice, and so, \nArt. 311(2)\n must come into play in respect of\nsuch cases. That being so, the Rule which does not require\ncompliance with the procedure prescribed by \nArt. 311(2)\n must\nbe struck down as invalid.\"\n\n 37. I am, therefore, inclined to hold that the Courts\nthough, have no power to amend the law by process of inter-\npretation, but do have power to mend it so as to be in\nconfirmity with the intendment of the legislature. Doctrine\nof reading down is one of the principles of\n\n327\n\ninterpretation of statute in that process. But when the\noffending language used by the legislature is clear, precise\nand unambiguous, violating the relevant provisions in the\nconstitution, resort cannot be had to the doctrine of read-\ning down to blow life into the void law to save from uncon-\nstitutionality or to confer jurisdiction on the legislature.\nSimilarly it cannot be taken aid of to emasculate the pre-\ncise, explicit, clear and unambiguous language to confer\narbitrary, unbridled and uncanalised power on an employer\nwhich is a negation to just, fair and reasonable procedure\nenvisaged under \nArticles 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution and\nto direct the authorities to record reasons, unknown or\nunintended procedure, in the manner argued by the learned\ncounsel for the appellants.\n\n 38. At the cost of repetition it is to reiterate that\nwhen the authority intends to take disciplinary action for\nimposing penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank\nof an employee, an elaborate procedure has been provided in\n\nRegulation 15\n to conduct an enquiry into misconduct after\ngiving reasonable opportunity. Residuary power has been\navowedly conferred in \nRegulation 9(b)\n with wide discretion\non the appropriate authority to take actions on similar set\nof facts but without any guidelines or procedure at the\nabsolute discretion of the same authority. The language of\n\nRegulation 9(b)\n is not capable of two interpretations. This\npower appears to be in addition to the normal power in\n\nRegulation 15\n. Thereby the legislative intention is manifest\nthat it intended to confer such draconian power couched in\nlanguage of width which hangs like Damocles sword on the\nneck of the employee, keeping every employee on tenterhook\nunder constant pressure of uncertainty, precarious tenure at\nall times right from the date of appointment till date of\nsuperannuation. It equally enables the employer to pick and\nchoose an employee at whim or vagary to terminate the serv-\nice arbitrarily and capriciously.\n\n 39. \nRegulation 9(b)\n, thereby deliberately conferred wide\npower of termination of services of the employee without\nfollowing the principle of audi alteram partem or even\nmodicum of procedure of representation before terminating\nthe services of permanent employee. It is well settled rule\nof statutory construction that when two interpretations are\npossible one which would preserve and save constitutionality\nof a particular Statute, would be preferred to the other\nthat would render it unconstitutional and void. When the\nlanguage is clear, unambiguous and specific and it does not\nlead to the constructions, it is not permissible to read\ninto those provisions something which is not intended. It is\nundoubtedly true as rightly contended by\n\n328\n\nMr. Ashok Desai, the learned Solicitor General that the\npower to take appropriate and expeditious action to meet the\nexigencies of weeding out inefficient, corrupt, indolent\nofficers or employees from service should be provided and\npreserved to the competent authority. Any action taken\nwithout any modicum of reasonable procedure and prior oppor-\ntunity always generates an unquenchable feeling that unfair\ntreatment was meted out to the aggrieved employee. To pre-\nvent miscarriage of justice or to arrest a nursing grievance\nthat arbitrary, whimsical or capricious action was taken\nbehind the back of an employee without opportunity, the law\nmust provide a fair, just and reasonable procedure as is\nexigible in a given circumstances as adumbrated in proviso\nto \nArt. 311(2)\n of the Constitution. If an individual action\nis taken as per the procedure on its own facts its legality\nmay be tested. But it would be no justification to confer\npower with wide discretion on any authority without any\nprocedure which would not meet the test of justness, fair-\nness and reasonableness envisaged under Arts. 14 and 21 of\nthe Constitution. In this context it is important to empha-\nsise that the absence of arbitrary power is the first essen-\ntial of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional\nsystem is based. In a system governed by rule of law, dis-\ncretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be\nconfined within defined limits. The rule of law from this\npoint of view means that decisions should be made by the\napplication of known principles and rules and, in general,\nsuch decisions should be predictable and the citizen should\nknow where he is. If a decision is taken without any princi-\nple or without any rule it is unpredictable and such a\ndecision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance\nwith the rule of law. (See Dicey--\"Law of the\nConstitution\"--10th Edn., Introduction cx). \"Law has reached\nits finest moments\", stated Douglas, J. in United States v.\nWunderlick, 342 U.S. 98 \"then it has freed man from the\nunlimited discretion of some rules .......... where discre-\ntion is absolute, man has always suffered\". It is in this\nsense that the rule of law may be said to be the sworn enemy\nof caprice. Discretion, as Lord Mansfield stated it in\nclassic terms in the case of John Wilkes \"means should\ndiscretion guided by law. \nIt must be governed by rule, not\nby humour; it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful,\" as\nfollowed in this Court in \nS.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of\nIndia.\n, [1967] 2 SCR 703.\n\n 40. In an appropriate case where there is no sufficient\nevidence available to inflict by way of disciplinary meas-\nure, penalty of dismissal or removal from service and to\nmeet such a situation, it is not as if that the authority is\nlacking any power to make Rules or regulations to give a\nnotice of opportunity with the grounds or the material on\nrecords on\n\n329\n\nwhich it proposed to take action, consider the objections\nand record reasons on the basis of which it had taken action\nand communicate the same. However scanty the material may\nbe, it must form foundation. This minimal procedure should\nbe made part of the procedure lest the exercise of the power\nis capable of abuse for good as well as for whimsical or\ncapricious purposes for reasons best known to the authority\nand not germane for the purpose for which the power was\nconferred. The action based on recording reasoning without\ncommunication would always be viewed with suspicion. There-\nfore, 1 hold that conferment of power with wide discretion\nwithout any guidelines, without any just, fair or reasonable\nprocedure is constitutionally anathema to Arts. 14, 16(1),\n19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution. Doctrine of reading\ndown cannot be extended to such a situation.\n\n \n41. It is undoubted that in In re Hindu Women's Right to\nProperty Act, [1941] FCR 12 involve the interpretation of\nsingle word \"property\" in the context to legislative compe-\ntency but that cannot be extended to the facts of these\ncases. \nR.M.D. Charnarbaugwalla\n's case is of severability and\nof a single word competition. The interpretation therein\nalso cannot be extended to the facts of these cases.\n Even\nthe case of K.N. Singh v. State of Bihar, [19621 Suppl. 2\nSCR 769 involve interpretation of \nSection 124(A)\n I.P.C. in\nthe context of freedom of speech enshrined under \nArt.\n19(1)(a)\n of the Constitution. The interpretation was put as\nto subserve the freedom under \nArt. 19(1)(a).\n \nR.L. Arora v.\nState of U.P.\n, [1964] 6 SCR 784 does not involve of the\ndoctrine of reading down so as to cut down the scope of\nFundamental Right.\n \nSimilarly \nJagdish Pandey v. Chancellor of\nthe Bihar\n, [1969] 1 SCR 23 1 also does not concern with\napplication of doctrine of reading down so as to sacrifice\nthe principle of natural justice which are considered as\nessential part of rule of law.\n In Amritsar Municipality v.\nState of Punjab, [1969] 3 SCR 447 the court ascertained the\nintention of the Legislature and interpreted the Act con-\nsistent with the said intention. Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn.,\n[1978] 4 SCC 494 is also a decision where it was found that\nthe intention of the Legislature was not to confer arbitrary\npower. \nN.C. Dalwadi v. State of Gujarat\n, [1987] 3 SCC 611 is\nalso a case giving reasonable interpretation of the inten-\ntion of the provisions of the Statute and is not capable of\nthe meaning.\n In Charanlal Sahu v. Union of India, [1989]\nSuppl. Scale (1) at p. 61 on which strong reliance was\nplaced by both the learned Attorney General and Solicitor\nGeneral, is a case capable of two interpretations to \nSec. 4\n.\n\nThe decisions cited by Shri Ashok Desai i.e. \nDelhi Transport\n\n330\n\nUndertaking v. Balbir Saran Goel\n, [1970] 3 SCR 757; \nAir\nIndia Corporation v. Rebellow\n, [1972] 3 SCR 606; \nMunicipal\nCorporation of Greater Bombay v. P.S. Malvankar\n, [1978] 3\nSCR 1000 concern the industrial Iaw wherein the validity of\nrules on the touch-stone of the reasonableness, fairness or\njustness was not considered. The prevailing doctrine of\nreasonable classification and nexus had their play to uphold\nthe validity of the provisions.\n\n \n42. It is undoubtedly true as contended by Sri Bhasin,\nlearned counsel for the intervener, that it is open to the\nauthorities to terminate the services of a temporary employ-\nee without holding an enquiry. But in view of the match of\nlaw made, viz., that it is not the form of the action but\nthe substance of the order is to be looked into, it is open\nto the Court to lift the veil and pierce the impugned action\nto find whether the impugned action is the foundation to\nimpose punishment or is only a motive. A larger Bench of\nseven Judges of this Court in \nShamsher Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n, [1975] 4 SCR 814 elaborately considered the question\nand laid down the rule in this regard. The play of fair play\nis to secure justice procedural as well as substantive. The\nsubstance of the order, the effect thereof is to be looked\ninto. Whether no misconduct spurns the action or whether the\nservices of a probationer is terminated without imputation\nof misconduct is the test. Termination simpliciter, either\ndue to loss of confidence or unsuitability to the post may\nbe a relevant factor to terminate the services of a proba-\ntioner. But it must be hedged with a bonafide over-all\nconsideration of the previous conduct without trained with\neither mala-fide or colourable exercise of power or for\nextraneous considerations. Such actions were upheld by this\nCourt. The action must be done honestly with due care and\nprudence.\n\n 43. \nIn view of the march of law made by \nArt. 14\n, in\nparticular after \nManeka Gandhi\n's case, it is too late in the\nday to contend that the competent authority would be vested\nwith wide discretionary power without any proper guidelines\nor the procedure. The further contention that the preamble,\nthe other rules and the circumstances could be taken aid of\nin reading down the provisions of the impugned rules or the\nregulations is also of no assistance when it is found that\nthe legislative intention is unmistakably clear, unambiguous\nand specific. Thus considered, I have no hesitation to\nconclude that the impugned regulation 9(b) of the Regula-\ntions are arbitrary, unjust, unfair and unreasonable offend-\ning Arts. 14, 16(1), 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution. It\nis also opposite to the public policy and thereby is void\nunder \nSection 23\n of the Indian Contract Act.\n\n331\n\n \n44. It is made clear that, as suggested by this Court in\n\nHindustan Steel\n Case that it is for concerned to make appro-\npriate rules or regulations and to take appropriate action\neven without resorting to elaborate enquiry needed consist-\nent with the constitutional scheme.\n \nThe correctness of the\ndecision in \nTulsiram Patel\n's case though was doubted in Ram\nChunder v. Union of India, [1986] 2 SCR 980 it is unneces-\nsary to go into that question. For the purpose of this case\nit is sufficient to hold that proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n itself\nis a constitutional provision which excluded the applicabil-\nity of \nArt. 311(2)\n as an exception for stated grounds. It\nmust be remembered that the authority taking action under\neither of the clauses (b) or (c) to proviso are enjoined to\nrecord reasons, though the reasons are not subject to judi-\ncial scrutiny, but to find the basis of which or the ground\non which or the circumstances under which they are satisfied\nto resort to the exercise of the power under either of the\ntwo relevant clauses to proviso to \nArt. 311(2)\n of the Con-\nstitution. Recording reasons itself is a safeguard for\npreventing to take arbitrary or unjust action. That ratio\ncannot be made applicable to the statutory rules.\n\n 45. Accordingly I hold that the ratio in Brojonath's-\ncase was correctly laid and requires no reconsideration and\nthe cases are to be decided in the light of the law laid\nabove. From the light shed by the path I tread, I express my\ndeep regrets for my inability to agree with my learned\nbrother, the Hon'ble Chief Justice on the applicability of\nthe doctrine of reading down to sustain the offending provi-\nsions. I agree with my brothren B.C. Ray and P.B. Sawant,\nJJ. with their reasoning and conclusions in addition to what\nI have laid earlier.\n\n 46. The appeal is accordingly dismissed, but without\ncosts. Similarly Civil Appeal No. 1115 of 1976 is allowed\nand the monetary relief granted is reasonable, but parties\nare directed to bear their own costs. Rest of the matters\nwill be disposed of by the Division Bench in the light of\nthe above law.\n\n In view of the majority judgment, Civil Appeal No. 2876\nof 1986 (Delhi Transport Corporation v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Con-\ngress) is dismissed. Civil Appeal No. 11 15 of 1976 (Satnam\nSingh v. Zilla Parishad Ferozepur & Ant., is allowed and the\nother cases snail be placed before a division bench for\nfinal disposal.\n\n C.A. 2876/86 is dismissed\n N.P.V. &C.A. 1115/76 isallowed.\n\n332",

The Divi-\nsion Bench of the High Court struck down the Regulation,\nholding that the Regulation gave absolute, unbridled and\narbitrary powers to the management to terminate the services\nof any permanent or temporary employee, and such power was\nviolative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. Hence, the\nCorporation filed the appeal before this Court, by special\nleave.\n The validity of similar provisions in Para 522 of the\nShastri Award, rule 1(i) of the District Board Rules 1926,\nPart V, \nRegulation 13\n of Indian Airlines Employees' Service\nRegulations, \nRegulation 48\n of Air India Employees' Service\nRegulations and also the clause in the contract of appoint-\nment in respect of employees of Zilla Parishad and the New\nIndia Assurance Company, also came up for consideration in\nthe connected appeals and applications filed before this\nCourt.\n It was contended on behalf of the Delhi Transport Corpo-\nration that there was sufficient guideline in \nRegulation\n9(b)\n and the power of termination, properly read, would not\nbe arbitrary or violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution,\nthat the Court would be entitled to obtain guidance from the\npreamble, the policy and the purpose of the Act and the\npower conferred under it and to see that the power was\nexercised only for that purpose, that even a term like\n'public interest' could be sufficient guidance in the matter\nof retirement of a government employee, and such a provision\ncould be read into a statute even when it was not otherwise\nexpressly there, that it was well-settled that the Court\nwould sustain the presumption of constitutionality by con-\nsidering matters of common knowledge and to assume every\nstate of facts which could be conceived and could even read\ndown the section, if it became necessary to uphold the\nvalidity of the provision, that the underlying\n144\nrationale of this rule of interpretation, or the doctrine of\nreading down of a statute being that when a legislature,\nwhose powers were not unlimited, enacted a statute, it was\naware of its limitations, and in the absence of express\nintention or clear language to the contrary, it must be\npresumed to have implied into the statute the requisite\nlimitations and conditions to immunise it from the virus of\nunconstitutionality, that since every legislature intended\nto act within its powers, in a limited Government, the\nlegislature would attempt to function within its limited\npowers and it would not be expected to have intended to\ntransgress its limits, that the guidelines for the exercise\nof the power of termination simpliciter under \nRegulation\n9(b)\n could be found in the statutory provisions of the 1950\nAct under which the regulations had been framed, the pream-\nble; \nSections 19\n, \n20\n and \n53\n, the context of \nRegulation 9(b)"

Union of India & Ors., [1988] 1 SCC 122, referred to.\n 2.1 The doctrine of reading down or of recasting the\nstatute can be applied in limited situations. It is essen-\ntially used, firstly, for saving a statute from being struck\ndown on account of its unconstitutionality. It is an exten-\nsion of the principle that when two interpretations are\npossible--one rendering it constitutional and the other\nmaking it constitutional the former should be preferred. The\nunconstitutionality may spring from either the incompetence\nof the legislature to enact the statute or from its viola-\ntion of any of the provisions of the Constitution. The\nsecond situation which summons its aid is where the provi-\nsions of the statute are vague and ambiguous and it is\npossible to gather the intention of the legislature from the\nobject of the statute, the context in which the provision\noccurs and the purpose for which it is made. However, when\nthe provision is cast in a definite and unambiguous language\nand its intention is clear, it is not permissible either to\nmend or bend it even if such recasting is in accord with\ngood reason and conscience. In such circumstances, it is not\npossible for the Court to remake the statute. Its only duty\nis to strike it down and leave it to the legislature if it\nso desires, to amend it. If the remaking of the statute by\nthe courts is to lead to its distortion that course is to be\nscrupulously avoided. The doctrine can never be called into\nplay where the statute requires extensive additions and\ndeletions.\n \nNot only it is no part of the court's duty to\nundertake such exercise, but it is beyond its jurisdiction\nto do so.

The freedom therefore,\nto search the spirit of the enactment or what is intended to\nobtain or to find the intention of parliament gives the\nCourt the power to supplant and supplement the expressions\nused to say what was left unsaid. This is an important\nbranch of judicial power, the concession of which if taken\nto the extreme is dangerous, but denial of that power would\nbe ruinous and this is not contrary to the expressed inten-\ntion of the legislature or the implied purpose of the legis-\nlation.

This cannot be agreed to. Our legis-\nlatures are limited by the constitutional inhibitions and it\nis made, that the Court should read their Acts and enact-\nments with the attribute that they know their limits and\ncould not have intended to violate the Constitution. It is\ntrue that the Court should be loath to read down where there\nare clear, unambiguous and positive terms in a legislation\nand should proceed with a straight forward method of strik-\ning down such legislations. But where the statute is silent\nor not expressive or inarticulate, the Court must read down\nin the silence of the statute and in the inarticulation of\nits provisions, the Constitutional inhibitions and transmute\nthe major inarticulate premise into a reality and read down\nthe statute accordingly. [236H, 237A-B]\n 3.5 The plain thrust of legislative enactment has to be\nfound out in the inarticulate expressions and in the silence\nof the legislation. In doing so, to say what the legislature\ndid not specifically say is not distortion to avert any\nconstitutional collision.

There the\nappellant was an Assistant in the respondent's undertaking,\nwho was removed from service on the ground that it was no\nlonger expedient to employ him.

It was further recognised that there might be myriad\nsituations which result in unfair and unreasonable bargains\nbetween parties possessing wholly disproportionate and\nunequal bargaining power. These cases can neither be enumer-\nated nor fully illustrated. The Court must judge each case\non its own facts and circumstances. The above principle\nwould apply, this Court reiterated, where the inequality of\nbargaining power is the result of the disparity in the\neconomic strength of the contracting parties or where the\ninequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the\ncreation of the parties or not or where the weaker party is\nin a position in which he could obtain goods or services or\nmeans of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the\nstronger party or go without them or where a man had no\nchoice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his\nassent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in pre-\nscribed or standard form or to accept a set of rules as part\nof the contract, however, unfair, unreasonable and uncon-\nscionable clause in that contract or form or rules might be.\nThis Court, however, reiterated that this principle would\nnot apply where the bargaining power of the contracting\nparties is equal or almost equal.

While\nthe Rules provided for four different modes in which the\nservices of a permanent employee could be terminated earlier\nthan his attaining the age of superannuation, namely, Rules\n9(i), 9(ii), 36(iv)(b) read with 38 and 37, Rule 9(i) is the\nonly rule which does not state in what circumstances the\npower conferred by that rule is to be exercised. Thus even\nwhere the Corporation could proceed under a regular disci-\nplinary inquiry, it is free to resort instead to Rule 9(i)\nin order to avoid the trouble of an inquiry. No opportunity\nof a hearing was at all intended to be afforded to the\npermanent employee whose service was being terminated in the\nexercise of that power. It violated audi alteram partem rule\nof natural justice also which was implicit in \nArticle 14\n of\nthe Constitution. It is not covered by any of the situations\nwhich would justify the total exclusion of the audi alteram\nparterm rule. The view that the Board of Directors would not\nexercise this power arbitrarily or capriciously as it con-\nsisted of responsible and highly placed persons ignored, it\nwas held, the fact that however highly placed a person might\nbe, he must necessarily possess human frailties and \"power\ntends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\nIt was, however, held that Rule 9(i) was also discriminatory\nfor the Corporation was given power to discriminate between\nemployee and employee. It was stated that it could back up\none employee and apply to him Rule 9(i). It could pick up\nanother employee and apply to him Rule 9(ii). It was further\nreiterated that the Corporation was a large organisation.\nThe said Rules formed part of the contract of employment\nbetween the Corporation and its employees who were not\nworkmen. These employees had no powerful Union to support\nthem. They had no voice in the framing of the said Rules.\nThey had no choice but to accept the said Rules as part of\ntheir contract of employment. There was gross disparity\nbetween the Corporation and its employees, whether they be\nworkmen or officers. The Corporation could afford to dis-\npense with the services of an officer and will find many\nothers to take his place but an officer cannot afford to\nlose his job because if he does so, there are not many jobs\nwaiting for him. It was, therefore, held that clause 9(i) of\nthe said regulation was against right and reasons and it was\nwholly unconscionable. It had been entered into between\nparties between whom there was gross inequality of bargain-\ning power. Rule 9(i) was a term of the contract between the\nCorporation and all its officers, it was noted. It affected\na large number of persons and it squarely fell within\nthe principle stated earlier.

Such a clause,\ntherefore, was opposed to public policy and as such it is\nvoid under \nSection 23\n of the Contract Act, it was held.

It was reiterated on\npage 190 of the report that if in a situation as envisaged\nin one of the three clauses of the second proviso to Clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n arises and the relevant clause is proper-\nly applied and the disciplinary inquiry dispensed with, the\nconcerned government servant cannot be heard to complain\nthat he is deprived of his livelihood. This Court reiterated\nthat the livelihood of an individual is a matter of great\nconcern to him and his family but his livelihood is a matter\nof his private interest where such livelihood is provided by\nthe public exchequer and the taking away of such livelihood\nis in the public interest and for the public good, and the\nformer must yield to the latter public policy, it was reit-\nerated, requires, public interest needs and public good\ndemands that there should be such a doctrine. It was further\nreiterated that the rules of natural justice are not immuta-\nble but flexible. These rules can be adopted and modified by\nstatutes and statutory rules and also by the constitution of\nthe Tribunal which has to decide a particular matter and the\nrules by which such Tribunal is governed. Not only, can the\nprinciples of natural justice be modified but in exceptional\ncases they can even be excluded. See the observations of\nthis Court at page 237 G of the aforesaid report. Reference\nwas also made to the observations of this Court at pages\n214-215 of the aforesaid report. Thus, the Constitution\nBench laid down that even where a government servant enjoys\nconstitutional status there can be exclusion of inquiry in\nthe cases prescribed for termination of employment.\n It must, however, be borne in mind that in some recent\ncases this Court has taken the view that a regulation pro-\nviding for the termination of the service of an employee of\nthe public corporation by notice only or pay in lieu thereof\nis invalid under \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. \nWe have\nreferred to the decisions of the \nWorkmen of Hindustan\nSteel\n's case (supra); West Bengal State Electricity Board's\ncase (supra) and Central Inland Water Transport Corpora-\ntion's case (supra).\n \nMr."

If that word necessarily and inevita-\nbly comprises all forms of property, including agricultural\nland, then clearly the Act went beyond the powers of the\nLegislature; but when a Legislature with limited and re-\nstricted powers makes use of a word of such wide and general\nimport, the presumption must surely be that it is using it\nwith reference to that kind of property with respect to\nwhich it is competent to legislate and to no other. The\nquestion is thus one of construction, and unless the Act is\nto be regarded as wholly meaningless and ineffective, the\nCourt is bound to construe the word 'property' as referring\nonly to those forms of property with respect to which the\nLegislature which enacted the Act was competent to legis-\nlate; that is to say, the property other than agricultural\nland ...... \""

Consequent-\nly, the question of reading down did not arise. Mr. Rao drew\nour attention to the observations of the Supreme Court of\nAmerica in Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v.

Mr. Rao submitted that the\ndecisions referred to by the learned Attorney General were\nnot applicable to the instant case. \nHe submitted that the\ndecision of the Federal Court in \nRe The Hindu Women's Rights\nto Property Act\n's case (supra) involved the interpretation\nof a single word in the context of legislative competence.\nThat was not the context of the present controversy, submit-\nted Mr. Rao. Mr. Rao submitted that R.M.D. Chamarbaughwal-\nla's case (supra) was a case on severability. That was a\ncase where the word 'competition' was interpreted. In the\npresent case, the suggested reading down involves, according\nto Mr. Rao, not interpretation of any single word in regula-\ntion 9(b) but adding a whole clause to it which amounted to\nrewriting the provisions.

It is true that where there are clear, unambiguous and\npositive terms in a legislation, the Court should be loath\nto read down. It should proceed with a straight-forward\nmethod of striking down such legislations. But where the\nstatute is silent or not expressive or inarticulate, the\nCourt must read down in the silence of the statute and in\nthe inarticulation of its provisions, the constitutional\ninhibitions and transmute the major inarticulate premise\ninto a reality and read down the statute accordingly. It is\ntrue perhaps, as has been said, that in the history of\nconstitutional law, statutes are seldom read down to mean\nwhat they say and intend. It is begging the question. If the\nstatutes are seldom read down to mean what they say and\nintend. It is begging the question. If the statute does not\nspecifically say, in such circumstances, as to how do we\nfind the intention to transgress the constitutional limita-\ntions. At least, the relevant provisions of the relevant\nstatutes and the rules, mentioned hereinbefore, are, in my\nopinion, on these points, not expressive enough to betray an\nintention transgress constitutional limitations. I am afraid\nthat reference to Elliott Ashton Welsh, II v. United States,\n398 US 333; 26 L.Ed. 2d 308 is inept in the background of\nthe principles we are confronted with. The plain thrust of\nlegislative enactment has to be found out in the inarticu-\nlate expressions and in the silence of the legislation. In\ndoing so, to say what the legislature did not specifically\nsay, is not distortion to avert any constitutional colli-\nsion, In the language of the relevant provisions with which\nwe are confronted, I do not find that intention of the\nlegislature to flout the constitutional limitations.\n I am also unable to accept the contention of Mr. Garg as\nwell as Mr. Ramamurthi that it is clear as a result of the\nconstitutional position of the security of tenure of the\nemployees as well as the expressed language of the provi-\nsions of several enactments that there is no valid power of\nthe termination of employment of the permanent employees\nwithout holding an enquiry or giving an opportunity to the\nemployees to rebut the charges on the grounds of termination\nin all circumstances. It was contended, as I have noted, by\nShri R.K. Garg that no principle of interpretation permitted\nreading down a provision so as to make it into a different\nprovision altogether different from what was intended by the\nlegislature or its delegate. \nReference was made to the\ndecision of this Court in \nR.M.D.C.\n 's case (supra).

In\nother words the Service Regulations or Rules framed by them\nare to be tested by the touchstone of \nArticle 14\n of Consti-\ntution.

There is no guideline in the\nRegulations or in the Act, as to when or in which cases and\ncircumstances this power of termination by giving notice or\npay in lieu of notice can be exercised.

Regula-\ntion 9(b) does not expressly exclude the application of the\n'audi alteram partern' rule and as such the order of termi-\nnation of service of a permanent employee cannot be passed\nby simply issuing a month's notice under \nRegulation 9(b)\n or\npay in lieu thereof without recording any reason in the\norder and without giving any hearing to the employee to\ncontrovert the allegation on the basis of which the purport-\ned order is made."

Admittedly, under the\nscheme of the then \nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n, after\nApril 1, 1937, the Central Legislature was precluded from\ndealing with the subjects numerated in List II of the 7th\nSchedule so far as the Governors' Provinces were concerned.\nLaws with respect to the \"devolution of agricultural land\""

Judged in the context of the above principles I am\nof the view that the doctrine cannot be availed of for\nsaving the present regulation- In the first instance, the\nregulation is a part of the service regulations of the\nemployees made by the Delhi Road Transport Authority in\nexercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) read\nwith clause (c) of sub-section (2) of \nSection 53\n of the\nDelhi Road Transport Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as\nthe \"Act\"). The object of the Act is to provide for the\nestablishment and the regulation of Road Transport Authority\nfor the promotion of a co-ordinated system of road transport\nin the State of Delhi. There is nothing either in the object\nof the service regulations of which the present regulation\nis a part or in the object of the Act which has a bearing on\nthe said \nRegulation 9(b)\n.

Secondly, the\nlanguage of the regulation is so crystal clear that no two\ninterpretations are possible to be placed on it and hence it\nis not permissible to read in it any meaning other than what\nis clearly sought to be conveyed by it. Thirdly, the context\nof the said regulation makes it abundantly clear that it is\nmeant to be a naked hire and fire rule and the authority has\nbeen vested with unguided and arbitrary power to dispense\nwith the services of any category of the employees. Sub-\nclause (a) of the said \nRegulation 9\n mentions elaborately the\ncircumstances in which the services of an employee can be\nterminated without any notice or pay in lieu of such notice.\nSub-clause (b) follows closely on its heel and states in\nclear language that when the termination is made due to\nreduction of establishment or in circumstances other than\nthose mentioned in subclause (a), one month's notice or pay\nin lieu thereof is all that is necessary to be given for\nterminating an employee's services.

What is more, the kind of recasting which\nis suggested on behalf of the appellants would not only\ndistort the intention of the rule-making authority but would\nalso require extensive amendment to it of a very vague\nnature. The appellants suggest firstly that we should read\ninto the regulation a provision that the concerned employee\nwould be given a hearing. The suggestion itself begs the\nquestion: Hearing for what? Is he to be heard with regard to\nhis misconduct? If so, it will require that he should first\nbe intimated of the misconduct of which he is guilty. But\nthat kind of a situation is taken care of by sub-clause (a)\nof the said regulation. There is, therefore, no need of a\nseparate provision for the same. If, on the other hand, the\nservices of an employee are to be terminated on grounds\nother than those mentioned in sub-clause (a), then those\ngrounds being unknown to the employee, cannot be met by him\neven if he is given a hearing. The reading in the rule of a\nmere provision of a hearing is, therefore, meaningless. The\nother suggestion made on behalf of the appellants is still\nmore objectionable. The suggestion was that we should read\nin the rule all circumstances where it is not possible or\nnecessary to hold an enquiry. 1 thought that such situations\nare capable of being formulated easily and conveniently at\nleast in general terms as is done by the Constitution-makers\nin the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n In fact, one of the\npublic undertakings viz., Indian Airlines has come out with\nsuch regulation being amended \nRegulation 13\n of its Employ-\nees' Service Regulations, and the same has been placed on\nrecord by them.

In Motiram Daka's case (supra) it\nwas further held that in a modern democratic State, the\nefficiency and incorruptibility of public administration is\nof such importance that it is essential to afford to civil\nservants adequate protection against capricious action from\ntheir superior authority. If a permanent civil servant is\nguilty of misconduct, he should no doubt be proceeded\nagainst promptly under the relevant disciplinary rules,\nsubject, of course, to the safeguard prescribed by \nArt.\n311(2);\n but in regard to honest, straight-forward and effi-\ncient permanent civil servants, it is of utmost importance,\neven from the point of view of the State, that they should\nenjoy a sense of security which alone can make them inde-\npendent and truly efficient. The sword of damocles hanging\nover the heads of permanent railway servants in the form of\nRule 148(3) or Rule 149(3) would inevitably create a sense\nof insecurity in the minds of such servants and would invest\nappropriate authorities with very wide powers which may\nconceivably be abused. Thereby this Court laid emphasis that\na permanent employee has a right or lien on the post he\nholds until his tenure of service reaches superannuation so\nas to earn pension at the evening of his life unless it is\ndetermined as"

Since\nconstitutions are the superior law of the land, and because\none of their outstanding features is flexibility and capaci-\nty to meet changing conditions, constitutional policy pro-\nvides a valuable aid in determining the legitimate bound-\naries of statutory meaning.

Any action taken\nwithout any modicum of reasonable procedure and prior oppor-\ntunity always generates an unquenchable feeling that unfair\ntreatment was meted out to the aggrieved employee. To pre-\nvent miscarriage of justice or to arrest a nursing grievance\nthat arbitrary, whimsical or capricious action was taken\nbehind the back of an employee without opportunity, the law\nmust provide a fair, just and reasonable procedure as is\nexigible in a given circumstances as adumbrated in proviso\nto \nArt. 311(2)\n of the Constitution. If an individual action\nis taken as per the procedure on its own facts its legality\nmay be tested. But it would be no justification to confer\npower with wide discretion on any authority without any\nprocedure which would not meet the test of justness, fair-\nness and reasonableness envisaged under Arts. 14 and 21 of\nthe Constitution. In this context it is important to empha-\nsise that the absence of arbitrary power is the first essen-\ntial of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional\nsystem is based. In a system governed by rule of law, dis-\ncretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be\nconfined within defined limits. The rule of law from this\npoint of view means that decisions should be made by the\napplication of known principles and rules and, in general,\nsuch decisions should be predictable and the citizen should\nknow where he is. If a decision is taken without any princi-\nple or without any rule it is unpredictable and such a\ndecision is the antithesis of a decision taken in accordance\nwith the rule of law. (See Dicey--\"Law of the\nConstitution\"--10th Edn., Introduction cx). \"Law has reached\nits finest moments\", stated Douglas, J. in United States v.\nWunderlick, 342 U.S. 98 \"then it has freed man from the\nunlimited discretion of some rules .......... where discre-\ntion is absolute, man has always suffered\". It is in this\nsense that the rule of law may be said to be the sworn enemy\nof caprice. Discretion, as Lord Mansfield stated it in\nclassic terms in the case of John Wilkes \"means should\ndiscretion guided by law. \nIt must be governed by rule, not\nby humour; it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful,\" as\nfollowed in this Court in \nS.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of\nIndia.\n, [1967] 2 SCR 703."
