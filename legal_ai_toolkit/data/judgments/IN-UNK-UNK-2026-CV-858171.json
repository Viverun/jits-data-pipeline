Rule returnable forthwith. Learned Advocates for the\n respective parties waive service of notice of Rule. With the\n consent of the parties matter is taken up for final hearing.\n\n 2. The present Revision Application has been filed to challenge\n the order dated 21.10.2022, passed by the 18th City Civil and\n Sessions Court in Civil Suit No. 220 of 2020, whereby the\n Ld.

For convenience, the parties are referred to by their status\n before the Ld. Trial Court.\n\n 4. The brief facts leading to the present Revision Application\n are as follows. The plaintiffs instituted Civil Suit No. 220 of\n 2020, contending that under a partnership deed dated\n 04.06.2003, the father of the plaintiffs and the father of\n defendants Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 had constituted a partnership firm\n under the name Tirupati Corporation. Upon the demise of\n both the original partners, and in terms of Clause 12 of the\n said partnership deed, the plaintiffs and defendants Nos. 1/1\n to 1/6 became partners of the said firm. The plaintiffs filed\n the suit seeking a declaration that, pursuant to the agreement\n dated 19.12.1983, they hold an undivided share in the suit\n property and further prayed for a direction to be issued to the\n\n 2\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Plaintiffs also sought to challenge the sale deed, dated\n 18.11.2003, executed by defendant No. 4, in favour of\n defendant No. 5, as well as the sale deed, dated 14.11.2008,\n executed by defendants Nos. 1 and 2, in favour of defendant\n No. 6. A prayer for permanent injunction in respect of the suit\n property was also made. Subsequently, defendants Nos. 7 and\n 8 were joined as parties, as defendant No. 7 had purchased a\n portion of the suit property on 26.07.2019, and defendant No.\n 8 had purchased another portion on 20.02.2021.\n\n 6. Defendant No. 7 thereafter filed an application under Order\n VII Rule 11(d) \nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, contending\n that the suit was not maintainable as (i) it was barred by\n \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, (ii) it was\n barred by limitation, and (iii) the plaintiffs had no cause of\n action to file the present suit. Upon consideration of the plaint\n and the documents annexed thereto, the Ld. Trial Court, by\n order dated 21.10.2022, dismissed the said application.\n Aggrieved thereby, the present Revision Application has been\n preferred.\n\n II. SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANT - PETITIONER\n\n 7. Ld. Senior Advocate Mr. Dhaval Dave has submitted that the\n\n 3\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n Application under \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil\n Procedure\n is based on three principal grounds: (i) that the Suit\n is barred under \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n 1932, (ii) that the plaint is barred by the law of limitation, and\n\n (iii) that the Plaintiffs have no legal right or locus to institute\n the Suit.\n\n 8. On the first submission, namely that the Suit is barred by\n \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Ld. Senior\n Advocate for the Defendant has advanced detailed arguments\n by placing reliance on the cause title of the plaint. It is\n pointed out that the Plaintiffs have described themselves as\n the legal heirs of one of the original partners, namely\n Nanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharwad, whereas Defendant Nos.\n 1/1 to 1/6 are described as the legal heirs of the other partner,\n namely Manibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.\n\n 9. It is submitted that a perusal of the Partnership Deed would\n reveal that there were only two partners in the firm, Tirupati\n Corporation. The Plaintiffs in the present Suit, while\n asserting themselves to be the partners of the said firm, have\n sought reliefs arising out of the said partnership deed. The\n Suit, it is urged, proceeds on the footing that the Plaintiffs, as\n partners of Tirupati Corporation, are entitled to specific\n performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983, which was\n executed in favour of the said firm by Defendant No. 4.\n\n 4\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 10. It is contended that, in view of the provisions of \nSection 69(1)\n\n of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs, suing as\n partners of an unregistered firm, cannot maintain the present\n Suit against Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, who are also claimed\n to be partners of Tirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs have\n sought a direction against Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 to execute\n a sale deed exclusively in their favour, although they possess\n no independent or individual right in the Suit property. Their\n claim, it is submitted, is founded solely on the Agreement\n dated 19.12.1983 entered into by the partnership firm.\n\n 11. It is further argued that, though the Plaintiffs have not sought\n any specific relief against the other partners, namely\n Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, the effect of the reliefs claimed is\n that the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the Agreement\n in their own favour as partners of Tirupati Corporation. In\n view of the admitted position that the said firm is\n unregistered, the Suit, according to the Ld. Senior Advocate,\n is squarely hit by \nSection 69(1)\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n 1932, and is therefore not maintainable in law.\n\n 12. It is further contended by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the\n Defendant that the Plaintiffs have sought to enforce rights\n arising from the agreement dated 19.12.1983, against\n Defendant Nos. 2 to 8, who are admittedly not partners of the\n firm Tirupati Corporation and are complete strangers to the\n said transaction. Since the firm is unregistered, any such\n\n 5\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n attempt to enforce contractual rights on behalf of the firm is\n expressly barred under \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership\n Act, 1932, and the Suit is therefore liable to be rejected as\n being barred by law.\n\n 13. Moreover, it has been urged that the Plaintiffs have also\n prayed for reliefs challenging the sale deed dated 14.11.2008.\n The said sale deed, however, was executed by the partnership\n firm itself through its partner, namely the father of Defendant\n Nos. 1/1 to 1/6. The Suit, therefore, is in essence one seeking\n enforcement of contractual rights arising from transactions\n undertaken by an unregistered firm. In view of the statutory\n bar contained in \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n 1932, such a Suit is not maintainable and must fail at the\n threshold.\n\n \n14. Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the\n decision in the case of \nFarooq vs. Shandhya Anthraper\n,\n (2018) 12 SCC 580 more particularly paras: 5 and 6 which\n read as under:\n\n \"5. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel\n appearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,\n read as a whole, relied upon Clause 25(d) of the\n partnership deed which specifically states that no\n partners of the firm shall without the consent in\n writing of the other partners be entitled to transfer\n immovable property belonging to the firm. The\n plaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule\n\n 6\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n property was purchased out of the funds of the firm\n for the purpose of development and sale. In Para 11,\n the plaintiffs discovered that a sale deed has been\n executed by the first defendant. It has been\n specifically stated that the plaintiffs had never\n consented to the same and the first defendant has no\n authority to sell any immovable property belonging\n to the firm.\n\n 6. The plaint, read as a whole, leaves no manner\n of doubt that the basis for the suit is \nSection 69\n of\n the Partnership Act read with Clause 25(d) of the\n partnership deed dated 29-12-1995. Para 18 of the\n plaint does not carry the matter further inasmuch as\n the only sentence which could possibly be relied\n upon, and which was relied upon by the High Court,\n is that the plaintiffs are entitled to file the suit even\n independently of the partnership firm. Having found\n that the basis of the suit is the factume of\n partnership and having relied upon Clause 25(d) of\n the partnership deed, it is clear that the trial court\n correctly found that the bar of \nSection 69\n of the Act\n was attracted in the facts of this case.\"\n\n 15. Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the\n decision reported in in the case of Sri Velji Narayan Patel vs.\n Sri Jayanti Lal Patel, AIR 2009 Cal. 164 more particularly,\n Para 9, which reads thus:\n\n \"9. Sub-section (1) of \nSection 69\n disentitles a\n partner or a person on behalf of a partner to sue as\n a partner against the firm of a person allegedly to be\n a partner unless the firm is registered with the\n\n 7\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n registrar of firms. Sub-section (2) similarly\n disentitles the firm to institute a suit against a third\n party unless the firm is registered. The common\n feature between Sub-section (1) and Sub-section (2)\n is that such suit must relate to enforcement of right\n arising out of a contract of conferred by the Act. If a\n suit by a partner against a partner or firm does not\n relate to enforcement of a right arising out of a\n contract then there is no legal prohibition because\n the spirit of \nSection 69\n either of Sub-section (1) or of\n Sub-section (2) is that such suit must be related to\n enforcement of the right arising from a contract.\n Having gone through the plaint of the suit it clearly\n appears that the plaintiff instituted the suit as a\n partner for enforcement of his right arising out of\n the contract. The entire narrative of the plaint is for\n declaration that the plaintiff is the owner of 50 per\n cent of the share of the partnership business and for\n declaration that he is entitled to enjoy 50 per cent of\n the said business under the name and style of M/s.\n Bhagat & Company, for production of books of\n accounts, statement of accounts, balance-sheet and\n other documents and for declaration that the\n defendant is liable to disburse and pay plaintiffs\n share of profit in the business. Plaintiff does not sue\n in his individual capacity. The prayers in the plaint\n are basically for enforcement of his right as\n embodied in the partnership deed which was\n executed by and between the parties on 15th of\n April, 2000. In such circumstances, the provision of\n Sub-section (1) of \nSection 69\n appears to have hit the\n plaint. Order 7, Rule 11(d) contains \"where the suit\n appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred\n\n 8\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is not the case in the plaint that the\n firm was registered with the Registrar of Firms.\"\n\n \n16. The defendant has relied on the decision in the case of\n \nSunkari Tirumala Rao vs. Penki Aruna Kumari\n, 2025 SCC\n Online 125, more particularly Paras 8 and 9 which read thus:\n\n \"8. It is evident from a reading of sub-sections (1)\n and (2) of \nSection 69\n that it assumes a mandatory\n character. \nSection 69(1)\n prohibits a suit amongst the\n partners of an unregistered partnership firm, for the\n enforcement of a right either arising from a contract\n or conferred by the Act, unless the suit amongst the\n partners is in the nature of dissolution of the\n partnership firm and/or rendition of accounts.\n \nSection 69(2)\n prohibits the institution of a suit by an\n unregistered firm against third persons for the\n enforcement of a right arising from a contract. As a\n consequence, a suit filed by an unregistered\n partnership firm and all proceedings arising\n thereunder, which fall within the ambit of \nSection 69\n\n would be without jurisdiction.\n\n \n9. This Court in \nSeth Loonkaran Sethiya and Others\n v. Mr. Ivan E. John and Others\n reported in (1977) 1\n SCC 379 had categorically held that \nSection 69\n is\n mandatory in character and a suit instituted by a\n plaintiff in respect of a right which was vested in\n him by virtue of a contract and entered into in his\n capacity as a partner of a partnership firm, would\n be void, if such a firm was unregistered. The\n relevant observations are as under:\n\n \"21. A bare glance at the section is enough to\n\n 9\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n show that it is mandatory in character and its\n effect is to render a suit by a plaintiff in respect\n of a right vested in him or acquired by him\n under a contract which he entered into as a\n partner of an unregistered firm, whether\n existing or dissolved, void. In other words, a\n partner of an erstwhile unregistered\n partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce\n a right arising out of a contract falling within\n the ambit of \nSection 69\n of the Partnership Act.\n In the instant case, Seth Sugan Chand had to\n admit in unmistakable terms that the firm\n \"Sethiya & Co.\" was not registered under the\n \nIndian Partnership Act\n. It cannot also be denied\n that the suit out of which the appeals have\n arisen was for enforcement of the agreement\n entered into by the plaintiff as partner of\n Sethiya & Co. which was an unregistered firm.\n That being so, the suit was undoubtedly a suit\n for the benefit and in the interest of the firm and\n consequently a suit on behalf of the firm. It is\n also to be borne in mind that it was never\n pleaded by the plaintiff, not even in the\n replication, that he was suing to recover the\n outstandings of a dissolved firm. Thus, the suit\n was clearly hit by \nSection 69\n of the Partnership\n Act and was not maintainable.\"\n\n \n17. Reliance has also been placed on the decision reported in in\n the case of \nPathik Udayan Bhatt vs. Shakti Infotec and\n Others\n, 2024 SCC Online Guj 4221 more particularly Para\n 21 which reads thus:\n\n 10\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

With the help of learned advocate for the\n petitioner, I have perused the plaint of Regular Civil\n Suit No.600 of 2016 filed by the plaintiffs-\n\n respondents, which is at Annexure-B to this petition,\n and upon bare perusal of the entire plaint, I am\n unable to find out anywhere in the plaint a single\n averment that the respondent No.1- is a registered\n firm, and as such, I find merit in the contention\n canvassed by the learned advocate for the applicant\n that in the absence of any assertion made in the\n plaint by the respondents that their firm is a\n registered firm, and in the absence of any\n documentary evidence being produced by them in\n support thereof, the suit instituted by the\n respondents is hit by the provisions of \nSection 69\n of\n the Indian Partnership Act, and when the suit is\n barred by any law, as per Clause 11(d) of Order VII,\n the same is required to be dismissed at the\n threshold.\"\n\n 18. With regard to the contention that no cause of action has\n arisen for the Plaintiffs to institute the present Suit, it has\n been submitted by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant\n that the Plaintiffs themselves have specifically pleaded in the\n plaint that there were only two partners in the partnership\n firm Tirupati Corporation as on 01.04.1982, each having a\n 50% share in the partnership property.

It is further contended that the record clearly establishes that,\n the father of the Plaintiffs, who was one of the two partners,\n expired on 23.12.2010. Consequently, it is urged that in view\n of there being only two partners, the partnership firm stood\n automatically dissolved upon the death of one of them, by\n operation of \nSection 42(c)\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n 1932. The Ld. Senior Advocate has submitted that even if the\n partnership deed contains a clause permitting legal heirs to be\n admitted as partners, such stipulation cannot override the\n statutory consequence of dissolution upon the death of one of\n the two partners. A partnership consisting of only two\n partners cannot, upon the death of one, continue as a validly\n existing firm, nor can a third party be inducted thereafter,\n since there remains no subsisting contract of partnership to\n support such induction.\n\n 20. On that basis, it is argued that the Plaintiffs, who claim to be\n the legal heirs of the deceased partner, cannot assert any right\n as partners of Tirupati Corporation, as the firm itself ceased\n to exist upon the death of their father. Consequently, the\n Plaintiffs could not have instituted the present Suit on the\n footing that they are partners of the said firm or that the firm\n continues to subsist. It has therefore been strongly urged that\n the plaint discloses no cause of action in favour of the\n Plaintiffs and that the Suit, having been filed by persons who\n\n 12\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has further\n contended that the plaint is hopelessly barred by limitation. It\n is submitted that the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of\n an agreement dated 19.12.1983, along with a declaration to\n cancel the sale deed dated 18.11.2003 executed by Defendant\n No. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5, and to set aside another\n sale deed dated 14.11.2008, executed by Defendant Nos. 1\n and 2 in favour of Defendant No. 6. It is pointed out that a\n bare perusal of the sale deed dated 14.11.2008 makes it\n evident that it was executed by the partners of the firm\n Tirupati Corporation itself. Hence, it is submitted that the\n Plaintiffs were fully aware of the said transaction, and\n therefore, the plea of ignorance or discovery at a later stage\n cannot be sustained.\n\n 22. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has also\n submitted that a plain reading of the plaint would reveal that\n the Plaintiffs are challenging sale deeds executed as far back\n as the year 2003, while the present Suit has been instituted\n only in the year 2020. It is emphasised that the plaint is\n entirely silent as to when the Plaintiffs first acquired\n knowledge of the impugned transactions. The record further\n indicates that the father of the Plaintiffs passed away in the\n\n 13\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is urged that the Plaintiffs have, with a view to circumvent\n the bar of limitation, inserted vague and general averments in\n the plaint without any specific or concrete disclosure of dates\n or events. Such vague assertions, it is contended, are\n insufficient to extend or save limitation under law. In the\n absence of specific pleadings disclosing how and when the\n cause of action arose, or when the Plaintiffs allegedly came to\n know of the impugned transactions, the Suit cannot be treated\n as within limitation. Hence, it is submitted that the plaint is\n liable to be rejected as being barred by the law of limitation.\n\n 24. Tirupati Corporation, the firm, had jointly instituted Civil\n Suit No. 1435 of 2003, in which Defendant No. 5 was also\n impleaded. That Suit sought injunctive relief but did not\n include any prayer for specific performance of the agreement\n dated 19.12.1983. This, according to the Ld. Senior\n Advocate, clearly establishes that even as early as the year\n 2003, the parties were aware of the execution of the sale\n deeds and the transactions concerning the suit property.\n\n 25. It has also been contended that the entire case of the Plaintiffs\n is founded upon the agreement dated 19.12.1983, entered into\n between Defendant No. 3 and the partnership firm. However,\n Defendant No. 3 himself was not the owner of the suit\n\n 14\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Therefore, the\n cause of action, if any, for seeking specific performance arose\n in favour of the partnership firm as far back as 15.12.1983.\n The present Suit having been instituted only in the year 2020,\n after an inordinate lapse of nearly thirty-seven years, is\n clearly barred by limitation, and the plaint deserves to be\n rejected on that ground alone.\n\n 26. In that view of the matter it has been argued that as the main\n relief sought in the plaint being barred under the provision of\n Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and the\n ancillary relief with respect to challenge to sale deed is also\n barred by law of limitation and in view of the death of\n original partners i.e., father of plaintiff and the father of\n defendant no.1/1/ to 1/6, no cause of action has arisen for the\n plaintiff to file the suit, the order that has been passed by trial\n Court is not reasoned order and the trial Court has not dealt\n with arguments as to how the plaint is maintainable in view\n of Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and\n \nLimitation Act\n and in view of facts stated in the application,\n the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit, the trial\n Court could not have rejected the application and the present\n Civil Revision Application is required to be allowed and the\n plaint is required to be rejected.\n\n 15\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF - RESPONDENT\n\n 27. Per Contra, Ld. Senior Advocate Mr. Sanjay Mehta,\n appearing for the Plaintiffs, has submitted that while\n considering an Application under \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the\n Code of Civil Procedure\n, the Court is required to confine its\n examination to the averments made in the Plaint and the\n documents annexed thereto. It is only upon such\n consideration that the Court can determine whether the plaint\n is barred by law.\n\n 28. It is submitted that, in the present case, there is no dispute\n that both the original partners namely, the father of the\n Plaintiffs and the father of Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 have\n passed away, resulting in the dissolution of the partnership\n firm. The Plaintiffs, being the legal heirs of one of the\n partners, have instituted the present Suit seeking reliefs in\n respect of the property belonging to the dissolved firm.\n Therefore, the bar under \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership\n Act, 1932, would not apply to the present case, as the Suit\n does not concern the enforcement of contractual rights arising\n out of a subsisting partnership, but rather relates to the\n division and distribution of assets belonging to the dissolved\n firm. Hence, the present property will have to be divided\n between the Partners.\n\n 29. Mr. Mehta has further drawn my attention to Paragraph 4 of\n\n 16\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is pointed out that\n Defendant No. 4, being the owner of the suit property, had\n earlier entered into an agreement with Defendant No. 3 on\n 12.02.1982. Relying upon the terms and conditions of the\n Agreement dated 15.12.1983, it is submitted that the said\n agreement expressly records that Defendant No. 3, as the\n signatory, was under an obligation to execute a sale deed in\n favour of the Plaintiff and/or his nominee.\n\n 30. Further, placing reliance on the Agreement dated 19.12.1983\n (entered into between the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 3), it is\n submitted that an additional sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- was paid\n by the Plaintiff to Defendant No. 3. Consequently, possession\n of the suit property was handed over to the Plaintiff in\n pursuance thereof. On the basis of these recitals, it is\n contended that possession of the suit property continues to\n remain with the Plaintiff, and hence, the reliefs sought in the\n Suit are also for protection of such lawful possession in\n addition to the other consequential declarations.\n\n 31. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has further invited\n the attention of this Court to Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003,\n which was instituted by the partners of the firm, Tirupati\n Corporation, seeking a decree of permanent injunction.

The Plaintiffs, contended that\n there were neither aware of the filing of the said Suit nor of\n its subsequent withdrawal, and they first came to know of\n these facts only at a later stage. It is therefore submitted that\n the Plaintiffs cannot be non-suited on the basis of\n proceedings of which they had no knowledge or participation.\n\n 32. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has further drawn\n the attention of this Court to Civil Suit No. 2231 of 2003,\n which had been instituted by Defendant No. 3, the executor\n of the agreement dated 15.12.1983. It is submitted that the\n said Suit was one for specific performance of the contract\n executed by the original owner, Defendant No. 4, in favour of\n Defendant No. 3. The said Suit, however, came to be\n dismissed for default, and an Application for its restoration is\n presently pending adjudication.\n\n 33. The Ld. Senior Advocate has also invited attention to the sale\n deed dated 14.11.2008, which was executed by the father of\n Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, in his capacity as a partner of\n Tirupati Corporation, jointly with one Rajnikant Becharbhai\n Patel (HUF), in respect of the partnership property.

Hence, the present Suit has been filed to\n challenge the said sale deed, being an unauthorised and\n invalid act in law.\n\n 34. Placing reliance on the aforesaid judgments and in view of\n the submissions made, it has been urged that no error has\n been committed by the Ld. Trial Court and the present Civil\n Revision Application is required to be rejected.\n\n IV. ANALYSIS\n\n 35. Having heard the Ld. Senior Advocates for the respective\n parties and upon a perusal of the Plaint in the present Suit\n along with its documents, the following position emerges on\n record:\n\n i. The Suit has been instituted by the partners of Tirupati\n Corporation, and a categorical assertion is made in\n Paragraph 2 of the Plaint that the Plaintiffs are\n partners of the said firm. Defendant No. 1 has been\n impleaded in the Suit in the capacity of being a partner\n of Tirupati Corporation.\n\n ii. It is further stated in the Plaint that the partnership\n firm Tirupati Corporation has not been dissolved.\n\n iii. Though the Agreement of 1983 was entered into\n\n 19\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Plaint itself records that Tirupati Corporation\n consisted of only two partners, namely, Nanubhai\n Ranchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the\n Plaintiffs, and Manilal Chhaganlal Patel, the\n predecessor of Defendant No. 1, and that both the said\n partners have since expired.\n\n v. The Plaint also discloses that Defendant Nos. 1/1 to\n 1/6 have been joined in the present proceedings in\n their capacity as partners of the firm, having\n succeeded to the interest of the deceased partner,\n Manibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.\n\n vi. The Plaintiffs have instituted the present Suit as the\n legal heirs of Nanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharvad. The\n reliefs claimed, however, are not for specific\n performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 either\n in favour of the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\n or jointly in favour of the legal heirs of both deceased\n partners, but solely in favour of the Plaintiffs.\n\n vii.

The record further\n indicates that Defendant No. 3 had earlier filed a\n separate Suit for specific performance of the\n agreement executed in his favour by Defendant Nos. 4\n and 5, which came to be dismissed (Restoration\n Application for which, is pending).\n\n viii. It is also an admitted position that a separate Civil\n Suit, being Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003, had been\n instituted by the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\n seeking injunctive relief. However, even at that stage,\n no relief for specific performance of the agreement\n dated 19.12.1983 had been sought for and on behalf of\n the partnership firm and the said Suit was\n subsequently withdrawn on 03.08.2012.\n\n 36. The Plaintiff asserts his right of possession over the suit\n property on the basis of the agreement executed on\n 19.12.1983, claiming that such possession flows from and is\n protected under the terms of the said Agreement.\n\n Cause of Action\n\n \nSection 42(C)\n of the Partnership Act\n\n 37. First and foremost, under the provisions of \nSection 42(c)\n of\n the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership stands\n dissolved by the death of a partner unless there exists a\n specific contract to the contrary. The statute proceeds on the\n\n 21\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

In the absence of a clear agreement permitting\n continuation after the death of a partner, the dissolution\n occurs automatically by operation of law.\n\n 38. In the present case, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\n consisted of only two partners, namely Nanubhai\n Ranchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the Plaintiffs, and\n Manilal Chhaganlal Patel, the predecessor of Defendant No.\n\n 1. Upon the death of either partner, the firm could not legally\n continue to exist because a partnership requires at least two\n living persons to constitute its foundation. The clause in the\n partnership deed permitting induction of legal heirs upon the\n death of a partner cannot revive or reconstitute a partnership\n that has already stood dissolved. Such induction can only\n occur where the partnership continues to exist.\n\n 39. Therefore, upon the death of either partner, the firm stood\n dissolved under \nSection 42(c)\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n 1932. Once dissolved, the partnership firm ceased to have\n any legal existence, and no partner or legal heir could\n maintain or defend any proceedings in the name of that firm.\n The Plaintiffs' claim, therefore, proceeds from a non-existent\n entity and cannot be sustained in law.\n\n 22\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Considering the aforesaid undisputed facts, it is evident that\n the dispute in the present proceedings arises out of claims\n advanced by the partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation,\n who have filed the Suit asserting rights derived from the\n Firm. The Firm has a Contract/Agreement with Defendant\n No. 3.\n\n 41. The Plaintiffs further seek to assert possession and ownership\n by invoking the principle of part performance under the\n supplementary agreement dated 19.12.1983, which too was\n executed by Defendant No. 3. Consequently, the Plaintiffs\n have sought specific performance of the agreement dated\n 19.12.1983 in their favour.\n\n 42. It further appears from the record that the Plaintiffs have\n instituted the present Suit in their capacity as partners of the\n firm Tirupati Corporation, yet the relief sought is for specific\n performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 exclusively\n in their own favour. The agreement, however, was executed\n with the partnership firm and not with the individual partners.\n Therefore, while the Plaintiffs claim to represent the firm, the\n reliefs prayed for are personal in nature and not on behalf of\n the firm, thereby creating an inconsistency between the\n capacity in which the Suit is filed and the nature of the reliefs\n\n 23\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

However, the record makes it abundantly clear that the\n partnership firm Tirupati Corporation is no longer in\n existence, having stood dissolved upon the death of its two\n partners. There is no dispute between the parties on this.\n Since there were only two partners, the demise of one\n resulted in the automatic dissolution of the firm.\n\n 45. That having dissolved, there is no disclosure of any cause of\n action for the Plaintiff to seek specific performance of the\n Contract. That too, only qua the Plaintiffs. Therefore, in\n essence, it is not even a specific performance of the said\n Contract. This is because, there is no Contract with the\n Plaintiff, of which the Plaintiff can seek performance.\n\n 46.

So far as adjudication in the present\n application is concerned, it becomes necessary to\n examine the necessary provisions which stipulate as\n to who would be a proper party in a suit for specific\n performance. \nSection 15\n of the Specific Relief Act,\n 1963 clearly stipulates that only the two persons\n who have entered into the alleged\n\n 25\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

However, the term \"representative in interest\" has been\n interpreted by the Hon'ble Apex Court in several judgments\n and the present Plaintiffs do not fall in the said category [see:\n\n \nKapilaben and Ors. v.

Had that been so, even the Defendant Nos. 1/1 to\n 1/6 would stand on a similar footing.\n\n 48. One other strange relief as sought for in the Plaint is to grant\n specific performance of the Contract qua the Plaintiffs only.\n Therefore also, the prayer in effect, is not of specific\n performance of the Contract. This is because, the Contract as\n entered into between the parties is required to be enforced.\n The Plaintiff cannot seek enforcement of the said Agreement\n in its favour alone.

A further aspect that merits consideration is the conduct of\n the Plaintiffs, which reflects clear approbation and\n reprobation. On one hand, for the purpose of overcoming the\n statutory bar under \nSection 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act,\n the Plaintiffs seek to disown the existence of the firm Tirupati\n Corporation, contending that the firm stood dissolved upon\n the death of its partners and that the present Suit is filed in\n their individual capacity. On the other hand, for the purpose\n of asserting cause of action and claiming rights under the\n agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983, the Plaintiffs\n project themselves as partners of the same firm and seek\n specific performance of contracts executed in favour of that\n firm.\n\n 52.

The principle of\n consistency and fairness demands that a litigant cannot take\n mutually destructive stands in order to derive advantage from\n both. Once the Plaintiffs themselves admit that the\n partnership firm has ceased to exist, they cannot\n simultaneously claim contractual rights in its name or through\n its agreements.\n\n 53. This inconsistent approach clearly demonstrates that the Suit\n is based on contradictory and self-defeating pleadings,\n creating no enforceable right in law. Such litigation, founded\n on shifting stands and mutually irreconcilable contentions,\n falls squarely within the mischief of Order VII Rule 11(d) \nof\n the Code of Civil Procedure\n and deserves rejection at the\n threshold.\n\n 54. The Plaint, on a plain reading, discloses no real or subsisting\n cause of action. The Plaintiffs have sought to assert a right on\n the basis of an agreement allegedly entered into by the\n partnership firm Tirupati Corporation on 15.12.1983 and\n 19.12.1983. However, the firm itself stands dissolved upon\n the death of its partners, and the Suit has been filed many\n decades thereafter.

Even if the averments made in the Plaint are\n taken at their highest value, the cause of action so pleaded is\n illusory, and does not create any enforceable right in law.\n\n 55. In the present case, it is evident from the averments in the\n Plaint that the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation. The\n Plaintiffs and their predecessors were aware of all material\n facts, including the agreements of 1983 and the subsequent\n sale deeds executed in 2003 and 2008. The record also\n reflects that the erstwhile partners themselves filed a Civil\n Suit in 2003, but did not claim specific performance at that\n time. It is, therefore, clear that the present Plaint has been\n drafted merely to create an artificial and non-existent cause of\n action in an attempt to overcome the statutory bar. Such a\n fictitious or illusory cause of action cannot confer jurisdiction\n upon the Court to entertain the Suit.\n\n 56. The legislative intent behind Order VII Rule 11(d) \nof the\n Code of Civil Procedure\n is to prevent the abuse of the judicial\n process and to protect litigants from being subjected to\n needless trials in cases where the plaint, on its face, is barred\n by law. When the plaint itself reveals that the claim is legally\n untenable, it becomes the duty of the Court to reject it at the\n threshold. Courts must not permit litigants to engage in\n speculative or vexatious litigation, which only serves to\n prolong proceedings and harass the opposite party.\n\n 29\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

If\n the cause of action is illusory, vexatious or\n frivolous as being outright sham.\n\n 70. In the present case, the plea of the Plaintiffs that they were\n unaware of the execution of the sale deeds cannot be\n accepted. The sale deed executed by Defendant No. 4 in\n favour of Defendant No. 5 in the year 2003 and the\n subsequent sale deed executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in\n favour of Defendant No. 6 in the year 2008 are both\n registered documents, forming part of the public record.\n Under settled law, registration of a document constitutes\n deemed notice to all persons claiming any interest in the\n property. The Plaintiffs, being successors of the original\n partners of Tirupati Corporation, were bound to be aware of\n transactions affecting the property that formed part of the\n firm's assets. The record further shows that even in the year\n 2003, a Civil Suit was filed by the erstwhile partners\n concerning the same property, thereby affirming their\n knowledge of the transactions. Hence, the Plaintiffs cannot\n now claim ignorance or seek to revive their right after\n decades. The deemed knowledge of the registered\n instruments squarely bars the present Suit under \nArticles 54\n\n and \n59\n of the \nLimitation Act\n.\n\n Plaintiff's basis of right and \nSection 69\n of the Partnership\n\n 36\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Another relevant aspect that requires consideration is that the\n present Suit has been instituted by the Plaintiffs claiming\n rights on behalf of the partnership firm. A reading of the\n averments in the Plaint makes it evident that the Plaintiffs\n assert their entitlement to the suit property by virtue of the\n Partnership Deed, under which they claim to have become\n partners upon the demise of their father.\n\n 72. Reliance has been placed on Clause 12 of the said partnership\n deed to contend that, as the legal heirs of the deceased\n partner, the Plaintiffs have stepped into his shoes and thereby\n acquired the rights and interests of a partner in respect of the\n suit property.\n\n 73. If the partnership deed and the existence of the partnership\n firm are excluded from consideration in the Suit, the\n Plaintiffs would have no independent or individual right in\n the suit property. Their entire claim is founded upon the\n rights allegedly flowing from the partnership firm and the\n partnership deed. In the absence of such partnership or any\n contractual nexus directly conferring ownership or possessory\n rights upon the Plaintiffs, no personal or separate entitlement\n in the suit property can be said to exist in their favour.\n\n 74.

The rights and obligations under such\n an agreement vest in the firm as a collective entity, and once\n the firm stands dissolved, those rights cannot be individually\n enforced by a former partner, especially qua themselves\n alone. Any attempt by a partner to seek specific performance\n in a personal capacity, in relation to a contract entered into\n with the firm, is impermissible.\n\n 75.

However, such a Suit is not maintainable unless the\n partnership firm is duly registered and the persons suing are\n shown as partners in the Register of Firms, as contemplated\n under the \nIndian Partnership Act, 1932\n. In the present case,\n the Plaintiffs are admittedly not recorded as partners in the\n Register of Firms, and since the firm itself is unregistered, the\n Suit could not have been instituted in law.\n\n 77. Moreover, in view of sub-section (2) of \nSection 69\n of the\n Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs are seeking to\n enforce a right arising out of a contract against Defendant\n Nos. 2 to 8.

Having heard the learned Senior counsel\n appearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,\n read as a whole, relied upon clause 25 (d) of the\n Partnership Deed which specifically states that no\n partners of the firm shall without the consent in\n writing of the other partners be entitled to transfer\n immovable property belonging to the firm. The\n plaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule\n property was purchased out of the funds of the firm\n for the purpose of development and sale.

In the present case, the Plaintiffs have not instituted the Suit\n in their individual capacity but have done so in their capacity\n as partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation. This position is\n evident from the averments made in the Plaint, which clearly\n state that the Suit has been filed by the Plaintiffs as partners\n of the said firm. Consequently, in view of the admitted fact\n that the partnership firm stands dissolved upon the death of\n the original partners, the Plaintiffs could not have maintained\n the present Suit in law.\n\n 80.

Once it is held that the primary relief for\n specific performance is barred by limitation, any\n consequential or ancillary relief which is dependent upon the\n success of that principal claim cannot independently survive.\n The law is well settled that where the main relief is barred,\n the ancillary or consequential relief automatically falls.\n\n 85. It further appears from the record that the Plaintiff seeks to\n protect his possession over the suit property by invoking the\n doctrine of part performance under \nSection 53A\n of the\n Transfer of Property Act, 1882.

The Plaintiff,\n therefore, cannot rely on Section 53A to found a cause of\n action for enforcement of any contractual right.\n\n 87. This is for a simple reason. If the Plaintiff is seeking a relief\n of protection of possession on the strength of an Agreement\n to Sell, it is claiming the benefit by operation of \nSection 53A\n\n of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (\"\nTP Act\n\"). However,\n the benefit of \nSection 53A\n of the TP Act is not available to an\n Unregistered Agreement to sell holder.

In light of the above settled position, the Plaintiff's reliance\n on \nSection 53A\n of the Transfer of Property Act to sustain his\n claim or protect his possession is legally untenable. Once the\n primary claim for specific performance is barred by\n limitation, the ancillary plea for protection of possession\n under Section 53A must also fail.\n\n 89.

Therefore, the prayer for\n permanent injunction must fail.

The Suit filed by\n the Plaintiff is for enforcement of rights arising from a\n contract and not based on any allegation of fraud or\n misrepresentation.\n \nIn \nShive Developers\n (supra), the Court was\n dealing with a situation where the Suit was grounded on\n allegations of fraud, concealment and deceit, which is not the\n position in the present matter. The Plaintiff's claim is purely\n contractual and, therefore\n, \nthe said decision\n does not assist\n the Plaintiff.\n\n 97. The judgment relied upon in the case of Daliben Valjibhai\n and Others v. Prajapati Kodarbhai Kacharabhai and\n Another is also not applicable. In that case, the Plaintiff had\n specifically contended that she became aware of the\n impugned sale deed only in the year 2004, and it was her case\n that the document contained forged signatures and thumb\n impressions. The issue there related to the computation of\n limitation in cases involving fraud under \nSection 17\n of the\n Limitation Act. In the present case, however, the erstwhile\n partners of Tirupati Corporation were fully aware of the\n agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983 and had even\n\n 49\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n filed Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003 for injunction, which was\n later withdrawn. Therefore, the Plaintiffs, claiming through\n the same partners, cannot assert lack of knowledge. The right\n to sue arose much earlier, and the Suit filed in 2020 is clearly\n barred by limitation.\n\n \n98. Reliance placed on \nP. Kumarakurubaran v. P. Narayanan\n and Others\n is also misplaced. The said case concerned a\n challenge to a General Power of Attorney alleged to have\n been fraudulently executed. The Court examined limitation in\n that factual background. In the present case, the original\n owner, Defendant No. 4, was not a signatory to the\n agreements entered into between Defendant No. 3 and the\n partnership firm in 1983. The erstwhile partners never sought\n specific performance of those agreements despite being aware\n of the refusal of Defendant No. 4. The record shows that the\n partners had knowledge of such refusal at least since the year\n 2003. Therefore\n, \nthe said judgment\n does not assist the\n Plaintiffs.\n\n 99. As regards reliance on Vinod Infra Developers Ltd. v.\n\n Mahavir Lunia and Others, where the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court held that a plaint can only be rejected if it is manifestly\n vexatious or discloses no cause of action, the principle does\n not help the Plaintiffs. In the present case, there are two\n distinct causes of action: one for specific performance of the\n 1983 agreement, and another challenging sale deeds executed\n\n 50\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n in 2003 and 2008. Both causes of action are barred by\n limitation. The registered sale deeds of 2003 and 2008 are\n public documents, and the Plaintiffs are deemed to have\n knowledge of their execution. The sale deed of 14.11.2008\n was executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in their capacity as\n partners of Tirupati Corporation, which imputes constructive\n notice to the Plaintiffs. Similarly, the sale deed executed by\n Defendant No. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5 in 1983 was a\n registered document, creating deemed knowledge under law.\n Therefore, the Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance or a fresh\n cause of action. The Suit is clearly barred by limitation under\n \nArticle 59\n of the \nLimitation Act\n and discloses no existing\n right to sue.\n\n VI. CONCLUSION\n\n 100. Upon careful consideration of the pleadings, documents, and\n reliefs sought in the Plaint, this Court finds that the Suit\n suffers from fundamental legal infirmities and discloses no\n genuine cause of action. The summary reasoning for the same\n may be set out as follows:\n\n 101. Firstly, the Suit is based on agreements dated 15.12.1983 and\n 19.12.1983, which were entered into not with the Plaintiffs in\n their individual capacity but with the partnership firm\n Tirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs, however, have sought\n specific performance of those agreements in their personal\n\n 51\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n favour. Such a pleading reflects an inherent inconsistency.\n The Plaintiffs cannot claim rights under agreements executed\n with the firm and simultaneously sue in their own names.\n This conduct amounts to clear approbation and reprobation\n seeking to rely on the firm when it suits their purpose and to\n disown its existence to avoid the statutory bar under \nSection\n 69\n of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Such mutually\n destructive pleas cannot stand together and render the cause\n of action wholly illusory.\n\n 102. Secondly, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation stood\n dissolved upon the death of its two partners, in terms of\n \nSection 42(c)\n of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Once the\n firm was dissolved, no legal relationship survived between\n the erstwhile partners, nor could any rights or liabilities be\n enforced in the name of the firm. The Plaintiffs, claiming\n through the deceased partners, cannot maintain a Suit on\n behalf of a non-existent entity or claim personal reliefs\n flowing from contracts executed in its name.\n\n 103. Thirdly, even assuming the agreements to be validly\n executed, the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation under\n \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act\n. The right to seek specific\n performance accrued in 1983 when the agreements were\n executed, and, at the latest, in 2003 when the erstwhile\n partners filed Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003 without seeking\n such relief. The subsequent sale deeds executed in 2003 and\n\n 52\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n C/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 2008 are registered public documents, and the Plaintiffs are\n deemed to have had constructive notice of their execution.\n Hence, the plea of lack of knowledge or recent discovery is\n untenable.\n\n 104. Fourthly, the Suit is expressly barred under \nSection 69(1)\n\n and (2) of the \nIndian Partnership Act, 1932\n, since the\n partnership firm was unregistered and the Plaintiffs are not\n shown in the Register of Firms as partners. The statutory bar\n is absolute and goes to the root of the maintainability of the\n Suit.\n\n 105. Fifthly, the cause of action, as pleaded, is artificial and\n illusory. The Plaintiffs have attempted to resurrect stale and\n extinguished rights (that too of the dissolved firm) through\n vague averments. The Suit, therefore, represents a clear\n instance of an illusory cause of action. Allowing such a Suit\n to proceed would amount to permitting abuse of the judicial\n process.\n\n 106. In view of the above, this Court finds that the Plaint is devoid\n of merit and discloses no legally enforceable right. The Suit\n is barred both by limitation and by the provisions of \nSection\n 69\n of the Partnership Act, 1932. The cause of action being\n illusory and inconsistent, the Plaint deserves to be rejected at\n the threshold under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) \nof the Code\n of Civil Procedure\n.\n\n 53\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Accordingly, the Civil Revision Application is allowed. The\n impugned order passed by the Learned Trial Court below\n Exhibit 80 is quashed and set aside. The application under\n Order VII Rule 11 is allowed, and the Plaint in Civil Suit No.\n 220 of 2020 stands rejected. No order as to costs.\n\n (SANJEEV J.THAKER,J)\n\n Manoj Kumar Rai\n\n 54\n\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025",
