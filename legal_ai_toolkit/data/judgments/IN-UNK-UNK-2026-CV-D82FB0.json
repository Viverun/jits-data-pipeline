JUSTICE P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\n\nTHURSDAY, THE 9TH DAY OF JANUARY 2025 / 19TH POUSHA, 1946\n\n BAIL APPL. NO. 287 OF 2025\n\nCRIME NO.1196/2024 OF PUDUKKAD POLICE STATION, THRISSUR\n\n AGAINST THE ORDER/JUDGMENT IN Bail Appl.\n\n NO.10592 OF 2024 OF HIGH COURT OF KERALA\n\n PETITIONER(S):\n\n MOHANAN\n AGED 70 YEARS, S/O KUMARAN PATTATHUPARAMBIL\n HOUSE, CHITTILASSERY DESOM, NENMANIKKARA\n VILLAGE, PUDUKAD P O, THRISSUR DISTRICT,\n PIN - 680 301\n\n BY ADVS.\n JITHIN BABU A\n ARUN SAMUEL\n ANOOD JALAL K.J.\n RESPONDENT(S):\n STATE OF KERALA\n REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,\n HIGH COURT OF KERALA, PIN - 682031\n BY ADV.:\n ADV.SRI.NOUSHAD K.A. - SR.PP\n THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n 09.01.2025, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE\n FOLLOWING:\n BA No.287 of 2025\n 2\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\n P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN, J.\n -------------------------------------------\n BA No.287 of 2025\n --------------------------------------------\n Dated this the 09th day of January, 2025\n\n ORDER\n\n This Bail Application is filed under Section\n\n483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita\n\n(BNSS), 2023.\n\n 2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime\n\nNo.1196/2024 of Pudukkad Police Station,\n\nThrissur. The above case is registered against the\n\npetitioner alleging offences punishable under\n\nSections 506\n, \n323\n and \n376\n of Indian Penal Code.\n\n 3. The prosecution case is that, on\n\n10.11.2021 at about 09.00 PM, the petitioner\n\ncommitted rape on his own daughter-in-law and\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 3\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\nthereby committed the above said offences.\n\n 4. Heard the learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n 5. The petitioner earlier filed a bail\n\napplication before this Court as BA\n\nNo.10592/2024. After hearing the counsel for the\n\npetitioner and the Public Prosecutor, this Court\n\nwas not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner\n\nbecause of the serious allegation against the\n\npetitioner. At that stage, the counsel for the\n\npetitioner seeks permission to withdraw the bail\n\napplication with liberty to move it again after two\n\nweeks and this Court granted liberty. Accordingly,\n\nthis second bail application is filed. Now, the\n\npetitioner is in custody for 45 days.\n\n 6. It is true that the allegation against the\n\npetitioner is very serious. According to the\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 4\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\npetitioner, it is a false case foisted against the\n\npetitioner at the instance of the daughter-in-law\n\nof the petitioner. It is also submitted that the son\n\nof the petitioner filed a divorce petition against\n\nthe defacto complainant and because of the\n\nsame, the present complaint is filed. The\n\npetitioner also produced a disability certificate\n\nshowing that, he is having 40% disability.\n\nConsidering the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase and also considering the fact that the\n\npetitioner is in custody from 26.11.2024, I think,\n\nthe petitioner can be released on bail after\n\nimposing stringent conditions. There can be a\n\ndirection to the petitioner to appear before the\n\nInvestigating Officer on all Mondays at 10.00 AM,\n\ntill final report is filed.\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 5\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\n \n7. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle\n\nthat the bail is the rule and the jail is the\n\nexception. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nChidambaram. \nP v. Directorate of\n\nEnforcement\n [2019 (16) SCALE 870], after\n\nconsidering all the earlier judgments, observed\n\nthat, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail\n\nremains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is\n\nthe rule and refusal is the exception so as to\n\nensure that the accused has the opportunity of\n\nsecuring fair trial.\n\n \n8. Moreover, in \nJalaluddin Khan v. Union\n\nof India\n [2024 KHC 6431], the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt observed that:\n\n \"21. Before we part with the Judgment,\n we must mention here that the Special\n Court and the High Court did not\n consider the material in the charge\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 6\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\n sheet objectively. Perhaps the focus was\n more on the activities of PFI, and\n therefore, the appellant's case could not\n be properly appreciated. When a case is\n made out for a grant of bail, the Courts\n should not have any hesitation in\n granting bail. The allegations of the\n prosecution may be very serious. But,\n the duty of the Courts is to consider the\n case for grant of bail in accordance with\n the law. \"Bail is the rule and jail is an\n exception\" is a settled law. Even in a\n case like the present case where there\n are stringent conditions for the grant of\n bail in the relevant statutes, the same\n rule holds good with only modification\n that the bail can be granted if the\n conditions in the statute are satisfied.\n The rule also means that once a case is\n made out for the grant of bail, the Court\n cannot decline to grant bail. If the Courts\n start denying bail in deserving cases, it\n will be a violation of the rights\n guaranteed under \nArt.21\n of our\n Constitution.\" (underline supplied)\n\n 9. \nIn \nManish Sisodia v. Directorate\n of\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 7\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\nEnforcement [2024 KHC 6426], also the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observed that:\n\n \"53. The Court further observed that, over\n a period of time, the trial courts and the\n High Courts have forgotten a very well -\n settled principle of law that bail is not to\n be withheld as a punishment. From our\n experience, we can say that it appears\n that the trial courts and the High Courts\n attempt to play safe in matters of grant of\n bail. The principle that bail is a rule and\n refusal is an exception is, at times,\n followed in breach. On account of non -\n grant of bail even in straight forward open\n and shut cases, this Court is flooded with\n huge number of bail petitions thereby\n adding to the huge pendency. It is high\n time that the trial courts and the High\n Courts should recognize the principle that\n \"bail is rule and jail is exception\".\"\n\n \n10. Considering the dictum \nlaid down in\n the\n\nabove decisions and considering the facts and\n\ncircumstances of this case, this Bail Application is\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 8\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\nallowed with the following directions:\n\n 1. Petitioner shall be released on bail\n\n on executing a bond for Rs.50,000/-\n\n (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with\n\n two solvent sureties each for the\n\n like sum to the satisfaction of the\n\n jurisdictional Court.\n\n 2. The petitioner shall appear before\n\n the Investigating Officer for\n\n interrogation as and when required.\n\n The petitioner shall co-operate with\n\n the investigation and shall not,\n\n directly or indirectly make any\n\n inducement, threat or promise to\n\n any person acquainted with the\n\n facts of the case so as to dissuade\n\n him from disclosing such facts to\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 9\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\n the Court or to any police officer.\n\n 3. Petitioner shall not leave India\n\n without permission of the\n\n jurisdictional Court.\n\n 4. Petitioner shall not commit an\n\n offence similar to the offence of\n\n which he is accused, or suspected,\n\n of the commission of which he is\n\n suspected.\n\n 5. The petitioner shall appear before\n\n the Investigating Officer on all\n\n Mondays at 10.00 AM, till final\n\n report is filed.\n\n 6. If any of the above conditions are\n\n violated by the petitioner, the\n\n jurisdictional Court can cancel the\n\n bail in accordance with law, even\n\n BA No.287 of 2025\n\n 10\n\n 2025:KER:1290\n\n though the bail is granted by this\n\n Court. The prosecution and the\n\n victim are at liberty to approach the\n\n jurisdictional court to cancel the\n\n bail, if there is any violation of the\n\n above condition.\n\n Sd/-\n\n P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\nnvj JUDGE",

The Court further observed that, over\n a period of time, the trial courts and the\n High Courts have forgotten a very well -\n settled principle of law that bail is not to\n be withheld as a punishment. From our\n experience, we can say that it appears\n that the trial courts and the High Courts\n attempt to play safe in matters of grant of\n bail. The principle that bail is a rule and\n refusal is an exception is, at times,\n followed in breach. On account of non -\n grant of bail even in straight forward open\n and shut cases, this Court is flooded with\n huge number of bail petitions thereby\n adding to the huge pendency. It is high\n time that the trial courts and the High\n Courts should recognize the principle that\n \"bail is rule and jail is exception\".\""
