Shrivastava\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n(Division Bench)\n\nWA-1184-2017\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh and others\nversus\nSant Kumar Mishra and another\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShri Akhil Singh, learned Govt. Advocate for appellants/State.\nMs. Malti Dadariya, learned counsel for respondents.\n\nCORAM :\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Sanjay Yadav, Judge\nHon'ble Mr. Justice B.K. Shrivastava, Judge\n\nORDER\n\n(Jabalpur, dated : 25.11.2019)\n\nPer : Sanjay Yadav, J :-\n\nThis appeal under Section 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Uchcha\n\nNyayalaya (Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005, is\n\ndirected against the order dated 11.04.2017 passed in Writ Petition\n\nNo.21362/2015.\n\n2. The issue raised in the petition, at the instance of the petitioner\n\nNo.1, was as to counting of the service rendered on daily wages in\n\nthe Work Charged Contingency Paid Establishment for pension on\n\nretirement after regularization in the Work Charged and\n\nContingency Paid Establishment. Whereas the issue raised by the\n\npetitioner No.2 was grant of family pension.\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n3. Evidently, the Rules which governs the pension are Madhya\n\nPradesh (Work Charged and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension\n\nRules, 1979. Petitioner No.1 was initially appointed as Chowkidar\n\non 14.02.1979 on Work Charged and Contingency Paid\n\nEstablishment. He was regularized on 01.05.2013. And, retired on\n\nattaining the age of 62 years with effect from 31.08.2015. As to\n\npetitioner No.2 her husband was appointed as Chowkidar in\n\nContingency establishment on 01.05.1984 and was regularized with\n\neffect from 01.05.2013. He died on 10.10.2013. The petitioner were\n\ndenied pension/family pension on the ground that they did not have\n\nminimum qualifying service under Rule 6 of 1979 Rules.\n\n4. Learned Single Judge relying upon the decision in Writ\n\nPetition No.2698/2003 (\nLallan Bai vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nand others\n) decided on 17.11.2004 held thus :\n\n8. Thus, the services rendered by the petitioner No.1\nand husband of the petitioner No.2 for a period of 2\nyears and 5 months respectively after their regularization\nare inconsequential what is relevant is that the tenure of\ntheir service prior to their regularization which is 34\nyears and 29 years respectively for both the petitioners.\n\n9.\nIn the result, this petition also deserves to be and is\nhereby allowed on the same terms as in the case of\n\nLallan Bai\n(supra). It is further directed that the\nrespondents shall determine the pension in accordance\nwith law in terms of the above direction within 3 months\nfrom today and make the payment of the same along\nwith interest of 6% per annum from the date the pension\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nhas been wrongfully deprived to the petitioners. No\norder as to costs.\n\n5.\nIn\nLallan Bai\n(supra), it is held :\n\n\"10. M.P. Work charged and Contingency Paid Employees\nPension Rules, 1979 defines the contingency paid employees to\nmean an employee who is paid on monthly basis. Work charge\nemployees means a person employed upon the actual\nexecution, as distinct from general supervision of a specified\nwork or upon subordinate supervision of the departmental\nlabour excluding the daily paid labour and muster-role\nemployee employed on the work. It is not in dispute in the\ninstant cases that Bal Kishan Patel was regularized and brought\nunder the purview of the Rules of 1979 w.e.f. 13.2.1997 and\ndeceased Jagmohan Singh Gond was brought under the\npurview of the above rules w.e.f 13.6.1992. Rule 2(c) defines\nthe permanent employees thus:-\n\n\"Permanent employee\" means a contingency\npaid employee or a work-charged employee who\nhas completed fifteen years of service or more on\nor after the 1st January, 1974:\n\nProvided that in respect of a contingency\npaid employee who has attained the age of\nsuperannuation or on after 1-4-1981 Permanent\nemployee means an employee who has completed\nten years of service on or after the 1st January,\n1974.\n\n11. Rule 4(A) which has been amended w.e.f. 29.11.1996\nwith retrospective effect provides that in case any permanent\nemployee has died while in service or after retirement on\npension on or after 1-4-1981 shall be entitled to family pension\nunder Rule 47 of M.P. Civil Services Pension Rules, 1976,\nEarlier the embargo which was created as per original rule 4-A\nwhich was incorporated on 30.1.1996. The Rule has been given\nretrospective effect w.e.f. 24.1.1984 Rule 4-A of M.P. Work\ncharged and Contingency Paid Employees rules, 1979 was\nincorporated on 30.1.1996.\n\n4-A. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule,\nthe family of a permanent employee who dies\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nwhile in service or after retirement of pension on\nor after 1-4-1981 shall be entitled to family\npension at the rate of 30% of death/retirement\nsubject to a minimum of Rs. 40 per month and\nmaximum of Rs. 100 Per month subject to other\nconditions of Rule 47 of the M.P. civil Services\n(Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of the\nsaid rule.\n\nLater, Rule 4-A was amended with effect from\n29.11.1996. Rule 4-A as amended on 29.11.1996 is quoted\nbelow:-\n\n\"fu;e 4 ¼d½& fu;e 4 fdlh ,sls LFkk;h deZpkjh\nftldh lsok esa jgrs ;k lsok fuo``fRr gksus ds i'pkr~~ 1\nvçSy 1981 dks ;k mlds i'pkr~~ e``R;q gks tkrh gS] dk\nifjokj] e/; çns'k flfoy lsok ¼isa'ku½ fu;e 1976 ds\nfu;e 47 dh fofgr njksa ij rFkk vU; 'krksZ ds\nv/;k/kkhu jgrs gq, isa'ku ikus dk gdnkj gksxkA\" \"\n\n12. Rule (6) of the Pension Rules, 1979 relating to the work-\ncharged and contingency paid employees provides for\ncommencement of qualifying service. It is clearly provided\nunder Rule 6(3) that on absorption of temporary employee\nwithout interruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1974 onwards, if\nsuch service is of not less than six years shall be counted for\npension as if such service was rendered in a regular post. Rules\n6 is quoted below:-\n\n6. Commencement of qualifying service.-(1)\nSubject to the provisions of chapter III of the\nMadhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,\n1976 of section IV of Madhya Pradesh New\nPension Rules, 1951, as the case may be for\ncalculating qualifying service of a permanent\nemployee who retired as such, the service\nrendered with effect from the 1st january, 1959 on\nwards shall be counted.\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n(2). On absorption of a permanent employee\nwithout interruption against any regular\npensionable post, the service rendered with effect\nfrom 1st January, 1959 on wards shall be counted\nfor Pension as if such service was rendered in a\nregular post.\n\n(3). On absorption of temporary employee\nwithout interruption against any regular\npensionable post, the service rendered with effect\nfrom 1st January, 1974 onwards, if such service is\nof not less than six years shall be counted for\npension as if such service was rendered in a\nregular post.\n\n13. Rule 47 of the M.P Civil Services Pension Rules, 1976 is\nquoted below:-\n\n47- Contributory family pension. -\n\n(1) to a Government servant entering service in\na pensionable establishment on or after 1st April,\n1966, and\n\n(b) to Government servant who was in service\non 31st march, 1966 and came to be governed by\nthe provisions of the Family Pension Scheme for\nState Government Employees, 1966 contained in\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh Finance\nDepartment Memo No. 1963/C.R. 903-IVR.II\ndated 17th August, 1966 as in force immediately\nbefore the commencement of these rules.\n\n(2) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n(3)(a) Where a Government servant, who is not\ngoverned by the Woekman's Compensation Act,\n1923 (No. 8 of 1923), dies while in service after\nhaving rendered not less than weven years\ncontinuous service, the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof the pay last drawn or twice the family pension\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nadmissible under sub-rule (2), whichever is less,\nand the amount so admissible shall be payable\nfrom the date following the date of death of the\nGovernment servant:-\n\n(I) for a period of seven years; or\n\n(ii) up to the date on which the deceased\nGovernment servant would have attained the age\nof 67 years had he survived, whichever period is\nless.\n\n(b) Where a Government servant who is not\ngoverned by the Workmen's compensation Act,\n1923 (No. 8 of 1923) dies after retirement after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service., the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof the pay last drawn by the pensioner before\nretirement or twice the family pension admissible\nunder sub-rule (2), whichever is less, and the\namount so admissible shall be payable from the\ndate following the date of death of the pensioner:-\n\n(i) for a period of seven years; or\n\n(ii) till the date on which the pensioner would\n\nhave reached the age of 67 years had he remained\nalive, whichever period is shorter:\n\nProvided that the amount of family pension shall\nnot exceed the pension sanctioned to the\nGovernment servant at the time of retirement. In\ncases where the amount of family pension as\nadmissible under clause (b) (i) of sub-rule (2) of\nthis rule exceeds the pension sanctioned at the\ntime of retirement, the amount of family pension\nsanctioned under this sub-rule shall not be less\nthan that amount. The term 'pension sanctioned at\nthe time of retirement' shall mean 'the pension\ninclusive of the part of the pension which the\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nretired Government servant may have commuted\nbefore death.'\n\n(c)(i) Where a Government servant who is\ngoverned by the workmen's\nCompensation Act,\n(No. 8 of 1923) dies while in service after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service, the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof the pay last drawn or one and a half times the\nfamily pension admissible under sub-rule (2)\nwhichever is less.\n\n(ii) where a Government servant who is\ngoverned by the\nWorkmen's Compensation Act,\n(No. 8 of 1923) dies after retirement after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service, the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof pay last drawn by the Government servant or\none and half times the family pension admissible\nunder sub-rule (2), whichever is less.\n\n(iii) The family pension so determined under\nsub-clause(i) or (ii) shall be payable for the period\nmentioned in clause (a) or clause (b) as the case\nmay be :\n\nProvided that where a compensation is not\npayable under the aforesaid Act, the Head of\noffice shall issue a certificate ot the Audit Officer\nto the effect that family of the deceased\nGovernment servant. Is not eligible for any\ncompensation under the aforesaid Act and the\nfamily shall be paid family pension on the scale\nand for the period mentioned in clause (a).\n\n(d) After the expiry of the period referred to in\nclause (a) or (b), the family, in receipt of family\npension under those clauses or clause (c)c, shall\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nbe entitled to family pension at the rate\nadmissible under su-rule(2).\n\n14. It is apparent that for the purpose of family pension Rule\n4-6 of the Pension Rules of 1979 read with Rule 47 of the\nRules of 1976 makes it clear that if an incumbent has rendered\nnot less than 7 years continuous services, family of incumbent\nis entitled for the family pension. It is not in dispute that\ndeceased Jabmohan Singh Gond had rendered the continuous\nservice for more than 7 years. Rule 6(3) of the Pension Rules of\n1979 clearly provides that without interruption for not less than\n6 years such services shall be counted for pension as if such\nservices has rendered on regular post, qualifying service has to\nbe given effect to while considering the length of the service, as\nspecified in Rule 2(c) of the Rules of 1979 otherwise the\npurpose of fiction created of Rule 6(3) stands defeated. Thus\nthe submission raised by the respondents that as per Rule 6(3),\nservices cannot to be computed towards qualifying service,\ncannot be accepted. The services which has been rendered, as\nqualifying service, under Rule 6(3) of the Pension Rules of\n1979 has to be counted, as rendered on a regular post.\nThereafter entitlement has to be determined by the respondents\nin accordance with law.\"\n\n6. In view whereof, the findings arrived at by learned Single\n\nJudge cannot be faulted with.\n\n7. As regard to pension for the personnel who are initially\n\nengaged on daily wagers in Work-Charged and Contingency Paid\n\nEstablishment and later regularised, the services rendered prior to\n\nregularisation is counted for the purpose of pension. For an\n\nauthority, please see decision rendered by a co-ordinate Bench of\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nIndore in the case of\nState of M.P. vs Ramchandra Singh\n: Writ\n\nAppeal No.179/2010 decided on 05.08.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n\"7. Considering the entire controversy, we find that\nthe stand of the appellants/State is severely lopsided\nand misguided. Considering the case of the petitioner\nthat he was a Gangman and for his services rendered\npension to be paid, would be regulated by the M.P.\nPension Rules of 1979. The appellants/State have not\ndenied the fact that the petitioner was working as a\ndaily wager in the respondent/Public Works\nDepartment from 1/6/1957 to 31/12/1995 and after\nmore than 25 years of service he was regularized on\nthe post w.e.f. 1/1/1996. Then undoubtedly the case of\nthe respondent/petitioner would fall under Rule 6(3) of\nthe M.P. (Workcharged and Contingency Paid\nEmployees) Pension Rules 1979.\n\n8. Dealing with the matter in detail we find that the\npetitioner was a Gangman working on a daily wage\nbasis and not working against any permanent post as\nalleged and the dispute that he cannot be extended the\nbenefit of the M.P. Pension Rules 1979 is however,\nfinally set at rest in the matter of Vishnu Mutiya and\nothers vs. State of M.P. And others : 2006(1)MPLJ 23\nwhereby a Full Bench of this Court has held thus:\n\n\"While deciding the Gulabsingh's case the 1977\nRules and Pension Rules of 1979 were not\nbrought to the notice of the Court. Under Rule 6\nof 1976 Rules the employees who were in service\nfor at least fifteen years on 1.1.1974 were eligible\nfor the status of permanent work charged or\ncontingency paid employees. This has been made\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nmore liberal by the 1979 Rules. Rule 2(c) of the\n1979 Rules lays down that a contingency paid\nemployee or a workcharged employee becomes\npermanent employee wherever he completes\nfifteen years of his service though it may be after\n1.1.1974.\"\n\nAnd further\n\"in such circumstances we hold that the services\nof gangmen are governed by the Rules applicable\nto work charged and contingency paid employees\neven though the gangman is not included in the\nschedule of 1976 Rules and the age of\nsuperannuation is 62 years as other Class IV\nemployees of the Statement Government because\nthey are in comparable category.\"\n\n9. Thus, we find that the entire controversy hinges\non the period that the employee has served prior to\nregularization as a work charged employee and\nwhether such services should be counted for pension\nas already stated above. We find that the ratio laid\ndown in the case of Mamta Shukla (supra) would not\nbe applicable in the present case simply for the reason\nthat the case of the respondent/petitioner is fully\ncovered by the sub-rule (3) of Rule 6 as amended vide\nnotification dated 30th January, 1996 in the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules 1979 vide FD No.B25/ 17/95/PWC/IV\nwhich provides for counting of six years service\nrendered in the Work-Charged Establishment without\ninterruption prior to regularization in the regular\ndepartment.\n\n10. We also find that the point of discrimination has\nbeen raised by the learned Counsel for the\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nrespondent/petitioner stating that similar relief was\ngranted to other gangmen in Writ Appeal No.279/2009\n(\nState of M.P. Vs. Dhanna\n), W.A. No.253/2011 (\nState\nof M.P. vs. Nanuram\n) and W.A. No.400/2011 (\nState of\nM.P. vs. Ratanbai\n). We find that the petitioner has\nrendered blemishless service of almost 43 years in the\nPublic Works Department of the State and therefore, in\na welfare State where retiral benefit is the obligation\nof the State, such bureaucracy and mulish behaviour is\nnot to be accepted. This Court had already imposed\ncost of Rs.40,000/on the State.\nMoreover the case of\nthe applicant does not come within the purview of\nMamta Shukla (supra) since his case is completely\ncovered by sub rule (3) of Rule 6 of the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules 1979 is already stated above.\n\n11. In the present case although the respondent was\nappointed as a gangman on muster role on 01/06/1957\nhe was regularized w.e.f. 01/01/1996 and he retired on\n30/06/2000 and six years uninterrupted services prior\nto the regularization shall be taken into consideration\nby the appellant/department while calculating the\npension of the respondent/petitioner. We have no\nhesitation in holding that the State is misguided in its\nappeal and it deserves to be dismissed as such.\n\n12. Consequently, it is hereby declared that the\nservices of the respondent/petitioner would be\ngoverned by sub rule (3) of Rule 6 of the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules, 1979 and the case is squarely covered\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nby several judgments of the earlier Division Bench\nand no error has been committed by the learned Single\nJudge in allowing the writ petition. If the\npetitioner/respondent has not been paid the pension\nand other consequential benefits the appellant/State\nshall do so within two months from the date of this\norder and it is directed in the interest of justice the\namount shall be paid with interest at the rate of 6% per\nannum.\"\n\n8. In view whereof, the petitioner No.1 was entitled for counting\n\nof his past service under Rule 6(3) of 1979 Rules.\n\n9. Now coming to family pension. The issue, in our opinion, has\n\nbeen duly considered and decided in the case of\nSmt. Sampat Bai\n\nvs State of Madhya Pradesh\n: Writ Petition No.17240/2012 on\n\n05.02.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n\"Question is whether the respondents are justified\nin rejecting the claim and whether the proposition of\nlaw\nlaid down in\nMamta Shukla (supra) and the\nprovisions of M.P. (Work Charged and Contingency\nPaid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 and M. P. Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules 1976, supports the rejection\norder.\n\nAnd whether rendering 10 years of service in a\nwork charged establishment will also be condition\nprecedent for granting of family pension, could be\nascertained after examining the relevant provision of\n1979 Rules and that of 76 Rules.\n\nRule 4 A of the Rules of 1979 and Rule 6 thereof\nrespectively provide for:\n\n\"4 A. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 4 the\nfamily of a permanent employee, who dies while in\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nservice or after retirement on pension on or after the\n1st April 1981 shall be entitled to family pension at the\nrate of 30% of his/her pay drawn at the time of\ndeath/retirement subject to minimum, of Rs.40/- per\nmonth and maximum of Rs. 100/- per month subject to\nother conditions of Rule 47 of Madhya Pradesh Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of\nthe said Rules.\n\n6. Commencement of qualifying service - (1) subject\nto the provisions of Chapter III of the Madhya Pradesh\nCivil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 or section IV of\nthe Madhya Pradesh New Pension Rules, 1951 as the\ncase may be, for calculating qualifying service of a\npermanent employee who retires as such, the service\nrendered with effect from the 1st January, 1959\nonwards shall be counted.\n\n(2) On absorption of a permanent employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1959\nonward shall be counted for pension as if such service\nwas rendered in a regular post.\n\n(3) On absorption of temporary employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1974\nonwards, if such service is of less than six years shall\nbe counted for pension as if such service was rendered\nin a regular post.\n\nWhen the aforesaid two Rules are read together, it is\nclear as crystal that the provisions which govern the\nfamily pension has a different field of operation than\nthe provisions regarding pension to an employee who\nretires from the work-charged establishment and are\ngoverned by Rule 6 of Rules of 1979.\n\nBy virtue of Rule 4 A the provisions as contained\nunder Rule 47 of the M.P. Civil Services (Pension)\nRules, 1976 are attracted. The said Rule provides for\n\n47. Contributory Family Pension - (1) The provisions\nof this rule shall apply:- (a) to a Government servant\nentering service in a pensionable establishment or on\nafter 1st April 1966, and (b) to a Government servant\nwho was in service on 31st March, 1966 and came to\nbe governed by the provisions of the Family Pension\nScheme for State Government Employees, 1966\ncontained in Government of Madhya Pradesh Finance\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nDepartment memo No.1963/C.R903-IV-R. II dated\n17th August, 1966 as in force immediately before the\ncommencement of these rules.\n\n(2) Subject to the provision of sub-rule (5) and\nwithout prejudice to the provisions contained in sub\nrule (3), where a government servant dies-\n\n(a) during the period of service he was found\nmedically fit at the time of appointment.\n\n(b) after retirement from service and was on the date\nof death in receipt of a pension or compassionate\nallowance, referred to in Chapter V other than the\npension referred to in Rule 34, on the date of death,\nthe family of the deceased shall be entitled to a\ncontributory family pension (hereinafter in this rule\nreferred to as Family pension) the amount of which\nshall be determined as follows:-\n\nPay of Government Servant Amount of monthly Family Pension\n\n(i) Below Rs.400 30 per cent of pay subject to minimum\nof Rs. 60 and a maximum of Rs. 100.\n\n(ii) Rs.400 and above but not 15 per cent of pay subject to minimum\nexceeding Rs. 1200 of Rs.100 and a maximum of Rs. 160.\n\n(ii) Above Rs. 1200 12 per cent of pay subject to a minimum\nof Rs. 160 and a maximum of Rs. 250.\n\nA harmonious reading of Rule 4 A of Rules, 1979\nand Rule 47(2) (a) of Rules, 1976 would fresco that if\na person employed in a regular work-charged\nestablishment dies while in service, his family cannot\nbe deprived of the pension which it would be entitled\nfor by virtue of Rule 4 A of Rules, 1979.\n\nAs to the law laid down by Full Bench in Mamta\nShukla (supra) the issue before the Full Bench was-\n\n\"(i) Whether the decision of the Division Bench in\nW.A. No. 725/2007,\nSmt. Rahisha Begum vs. State of\nM.P. and others\nis not a good law in view of the\ndecision of the earlier Division Bench of this Court\nvide order dated 18-7-2005, passed in W.P. No.\n1273/2000,\nState of M.P. And others vs. Ram Singh\nand another\n?\n\n(ii) Whether an employee is eligible for the benefit of\nfamily pension in accordance with the provisions of\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nMadhya Pradesh (Work Charged and Contingency\nPaid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 after\ncompleting qualifying service in accordance with the\nprovisions of Recruitment Rules framed by the\nconcerned Department for work charged and\ncontingency paid employees or in accordance with the\ndefinition of Rule 2 of Madhya Pradesh (Work\nCharged and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension\nRules, 1979 in regard to \"contingency paid\nemployee\", \"work-charged employee\" and permanent\nemployee\" ?\n\n(iii) Whether for counting qualifying service of an\nemployee for the purpose of grant of benefit of\npension it is necessary that the employee has to be\nappointed in accordance with the provisions of\ncontingency paid employees recruitment rules framed\nby the concerned department in regard to work\ncharged and contingency paid employees ?\"\n\nThe reference was answered in the following\nterms -\n\n\"24- On the basis of above discussion, we hold in\nregard to the substantial questions of law Nos: 2 and 3\nthat an employee is eligible to count his past service as\nqualifying service in accordance with Rule 6 of the\nPension Rules, 1979, if he was appointed in\naccordance with the provisions of Recruitment Rules\nof 1977. We further hold that an employee, who was\nnot appointed in accordance\nwith the provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by\nthe concerned department, i.e., the Recruitment Rules\nof 1977, would not be eligible to count his past service\nas qualifying service for the purpose of grant of\npension in accordance with the Pension Rules of 1979\nand we answer the substantial questions of law Nos. 2\nand 3 accordingly.\n\n25.\nIn regard to substantial question of law No. 1\nEarlier Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.\n1273/2000,\nState of M.P. vs. Ramsingh and another\n, as\nheld that a daily wager employee would not fall within\nthe definition of work charged and contingency paid\nemployee, hence his case would not be covered by\nMadhya Pradesh Workcharged and Contingency Paid\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nEmployees Pension Rules, 1979, has not been noticed\nby the subsequent Division Bench of this Court in\n\nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. And\nother, 2010(4)\nMPLJ 332. However, in the subsequent case, the\nDivision Bench has held that if an employee comes\nwithin the definition of work charged and contingency\npaid employee as defined the Pension Rules of 1979,\nthen he is eligible to count his past service for the\npurpose of qualifying service in accordance with the\nRules of 1979. In our opinion, there is no conflict\nbetween the Division Bench judgments, because the\nfindings of the Division Benches are based on\ndifferent factual aspects. Accordingly, we answer the\nsubstantial question of law No. 1 that there is no\nconflict of opinion between the two Division Bench\njudgments.\n\nHence, the decision of the Division Bench\nin the case of\nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. and\nothers\n, 2010(4) MPLJ 332, is not per incuriam. We\nanswer substantial question of law No. 1 accordingly.\"\n\nApparent, it is from the above pronouncement\nthat, the issue as to grant of family pension to a widow\nof an employee of work charged who are apparently\ncovered by Rule 4A of Rules of 1979 was not the term\nof reference and nor was the same dwelt upon by the\nFull Bench.\n\nIn view of above, the respondents are not justified\nin denying the family pension to the petitioner only on\nthe ground that the petitioner's husband did not\ncomplete 10 years of service in Regular Work Charged\nEstablishment.\n\nIn view whereof, the impugned order dated\n07.05.2012 is quashed. The respondents are directed to\ngrant family pension to the petitioner from the date of\nentitlement. Petitioner shall also be entitled for the\ninterest @ 7.5% on the difference till its final\npayment.\"\n\n10. In view of the above discussion, since we perceive no\n\nillegality in the impugned order, we decline to cause an indulgence.\nWrit Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n11. The appeal filed by State of M.P. and its functionaries is\n\ndismissed.\n\n(SANJAY YADAV) (B. K.
