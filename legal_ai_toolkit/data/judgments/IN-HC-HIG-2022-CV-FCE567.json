The State's endeavour to deny regularization to Class-IV\n\nemployees of Category-D, who have served them for almost 4\n\ndecades and still continue to serve them, befuddle them thus\n\nburdening this Court with repeated rounds of litigation.\n\n3. Firstly, policies of regularization framed by the State\n\nitself, on which action is taken selectively leading to a clamour for\n\nequality on account of violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of\n\n2 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -3-\n\nIndia has led to the present round of litigation, wherein various\n\nSingle Bench Judges of this Court while noticing the dereliction of\n\nthe duties at the level of State had directed regularization. The State\n\ncontinues to deny to these lowly placed employees their place of\n\nequality with regard to the benefit of regularization and service\n\nbenefits.\n\n4. The factual matrix in sum and substance would\n\nnecessarily have to be noticed, accordingly, regarding the various\n\npolicies the State has issued and repeatedly gone back and introduced\n\nthem at its own convenience and then raised arguments that when the\n\ncase for consideration was put up the said policies were not in force\n\nand therefore, put the employees/writ petitioners at a disadvantage\n\nwhile granting the benefit of regularization to a certain set of persons\n\nwho would be juniors. It is in this matrix the background of the\n\nlitigation in question has arisen, which primarily in the present case\n\npertains to an innocuous order of directions for considering the case\n\nof regularization as per policies dated 18.03.1996 and 01.10.2003\n\n(Annexure P-12) on the strength of the fact that the juniors of the\n\nwrit petitioners had been regularized vide Annexures P-3 to P-9 on\n\n16.10.2006, 09.01.2007 and 19.02.2007. Another reason which\n\nweighed with the learned Single Judge was that in view of the\n\ndirections issued in CWP No.17150 of 2015 titled as\nPawan Kumar\n\nand others Vs. State of Haryana and others\n' the Kaithal Forest\n\nDivision had regularized the services of the petitioners therein vide\n\n3 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -4-\n\norder dated 06.07.2018 and was in the process of regularization of\n\nother employees.\n\n5. It is pertinent to notice that the writ petitioners in\n\nLPA-688-2021 herein were appointed between the year 1982 to 1986\n\nand had at one point of time been retrenched, which they had\n\nsuccessfully challenged before the Labour Court and they had been\n\nordered to be reinstated vide Award dated 27.03.2006. The writ\n\npetitions filed by the State had been disposed off, keeping in view the\n\nfact that the workmen had been taken back in service and on a\n\nconsent to the extent that they are entitled only to the 25% of the\n\nback-wages, which would be clear from the order dated 19.02.2008\n\n(Annexure P-1). The factum of date of joining and the number of\n\nyears of service would be clear from the table reproduced in the writ\n\npetition itself, which reads as under:-\n\nSr. Name of the Date of Date of Decision of No.of\nNo. petitioner appointment termination the Labour years\nCourt service\n\n1.

It is not disputed that on the issue of equality as such\n\nwhich the State cannot deny, as in\nPawan Kumar\n's case (supra) it\n\nhad chosen to implement the order on 06.07.2018 for 16 of the\n\nemployees of the said department.

Conservator of Forests, Kaithal Forest\nDivision, Kaithal.\"\n\n7. We have gone through the judgment and record in\n\nPawan Kumar\n's case (supra) passed by the learned Single Judge\n\nand found that they were appointed as daily wage labourers between\n\n1979 to June, 2000 and the learned Single Judge had found that the\n\nservices of all had been terminated on 11.08.2012, which had been\n\nset aside by the Labour Court vide Award dated 27.08.2014 and they\n\nwere reinstated in service with 50% back-wages, whereas juniors to\n\nthem had been retained and made regular.\n\nThe argument raised that\n\nregularization policies had been withdrawn in the year 2007 was\n\nrejected on the ground that once the benefit had been granted to the\n\njuniors even in the absence of any policy, their claim would still be\n\nalive while placing reliance upon in the case of\n'Raj Kumar Vs.\n\nState of Haryana\n', 2015 (4) SCT 277.\n\n8. As noticed in the case of persons employed 4 to 10 years\n\nlater, the State has chosen to grant them the benefit of regularization,\n\nbut continued to deny the same to the writ petitioners. The said\n\nclaim had been rejected by passing a speaking order dated\n\n06.01.2016 (Annexure P-15), since directions had been issued on an\n\nearlier occasion on 05.11.2015 in CWP No.23724 of 2015\n\n8 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -9-\n\n'Balwinder Singh and others Vs. State of Haryana and others\n' to\n\ndecide the legal notice dated 19.08.2015 (Annexure P-10). The\n\nDivisional Forest Officer, Kaithal rejected the claim by holding out\n\nthat the date of initial engagement was not accepted by the Labour\n\nCourt, which was only to deal with the issue whether the termination\n\nof workman was justified or not, which was the fallacious objection\n\nraised in as much as the Labour Court had to see the initial date of\n\nappointment in order to come to the conclusion whether they had\n\nworked for 240 days or not and whether reinstatement could be\n\ndirected. Similarly objection raised was that the writ petitioners were\n\nnot appointed on duly sanctioned posts and policies stood withdrawn\n\nand the State Government had put on hold all the policy decisions.\n\nReliance was placed upon the judgment of the Apex Court passed in\n\nSecretary, State of Karnataka and others Vs. Uma Devi and\n\nothers, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and that neither the writ petitioners were\n\ncovered under the policy dated 29.07.2011, though the consideration\n\nwas for the benefits of a policy which had been issued at an earlier\n\npoint of time, whereby only 3 years service was required as on\n\n31.01.1996/30.09.2003.\n\n9. The State of Haryana had regularization policies for\n\nadjusting the ad-hoc appointments since 12.10.1970 which have been\n\nreplaced by various instructions and notifications issued by Chief\n\nSecretary and as brought to our notice by the State Counsel. On\n\n01.01.1980 also a notification had been made and thereafter another\n\n9 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -10-\n\none was circulated on 03.11.1983 which was also modified at various\n\nstages. On 19.01.1984, another notification was issued which talked\n\nabout regularizing employees who had completed 2 years of service\n\non 15.09.1982 and were in service on the said date. Same was\n\nfollowed up by similar regularization policy dated 16.02.1987 of\n\nClass-III employees. It is not disputed that a Division Bench of this\n\nCourt in CWP-72-1988 titled Piara Singh Vs. State of Haryana &\n\nothers had issued directions for regularization of persons who had\n\nput in 4 years of service and for those set of employees who fell\n\nwithin the meaning of 'workman' and the same was modified by the\n\nApex Court in State of Haryana Vs. Piara Singh, 1992 (4) SCC\n\n118.\n\n10. The first policy dated 18.03.1996 sought to be enforced\n\nin the present bunch of cases reads as under:\n\n\"No. 6/38/95-2081 Dated 18-3-1996\nTo\n\nThe Chief Secretary to Government Haryana\nTo\n\n1.

A perusal of the above would go on to show that for\n\ndaily wage employees of Group-D Category, 3 years service on\n\n30.09.2003 was the requirement, apart from the fact that requisite\n\nqualifications and vacant posts were the conditions with a rider that\n\nthe employee had to work for 240 days in each year.

State of Haryana and others' the Coordinate Bench observed\n\nthat the introduction of date 31.01.1996 vide impugned amendment\n\ndated 10.02.2004 was unreasonable and arbitrary, as it was applying\n\nretrospectively to take away the vested rights of the petitioners whose\n\nservices had already been regularized, since it was a case where their\n\norder of regularization was passed on 15.12.2003, which was sought\n\nto be reviewed and set aside vide order dated 08.06.2004. Relevant\n\nportion of the order dated 04.02.2015 reads as under:-\n\n\"Vide notification dated 01.10.2003, services of all\ndaily wagers, who had put in three years of service as on\n30.09.2003, were entitled to be regularized.

We find the introduction of date 31.01.1996\nthrough the impugned amendment dated 10.02.2004 to be\nunreasonable and arbitrary because if such an amendment\nis to be allowed, then the result is that a daily wager, who\nputs in three years of service from 30.01.1996, would be\nentitled to regularization of his service, whereas the\nservices of the person like the petitioner, who would have\nput in over five years of service i.e. From August 1998 till\n30.09.2003, would not be regularized.\n\nEven otherwise, the impugned amendment through\nnotification dated 10.02.2004, could not apply\nretrospectively to take away the vested rights of the\npetitioner, whose services had already been regularized\nthrough order dated 15.12.2003 prior to the amendment.

The State then framed policy dated 29.07.2011 for\n\nGroup-D employees in pursuance of the judgment passed in Uma\n\nDevi (supra) wherein Group-D employees had to have 10 years of\n\nservice as on 10.04.2006 for the grant of the said benefit.

The appeals filed against the said order were allowed on\n\n18.03.2019 by the Bench of the learned Chief Justice, lead case of\n\nwhich was\nLPA No.109 of 2019 'State of Haryana and others Vs.\n\nBalwinder Singh and others\n' primarily on the ground that the\n\nmatter would require individual adjudication with regard to facts of\n\neach case, the law and regularization policy and liberty was also\n\ngiven to club the cases which are based on identical facts where the\n\nemployer were common. Relevant portion of the order dated\n\n18.03.2019 reads as under:-\n\n\"3.

Resultantly, the matters are before this Court on account\n\nof the learned Single Judges again having decided the cases in favour\n\nof the employees in various writ petitions decided on various dates.\n\n32. Mr. Ankur Mittal has mainly relied on three principles to\n\nargue that there has to be an active policy in force, on the basis of\n\nwhich directions can be issued for regularization and on account of\n\nthe fact that a new policy dated 29.07.2011 had come into force, the\n\nlearned Single Judge was in error in issuing directions to consider the\n\ncase of the employees under the policy dated 01.10.2003. Reliance\n\nwas placed upon the judgment of the Apex Court in\n'Maharashtra\n\nState Road Transport Corporation and another Vs. Casteribe\n\nRajya Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana\n', (2009) 8 SCC 556 to\n\nargue that\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India could not be used\n\nfor issuing orders of regularization.\n\nResultantly, it was argued that\n\non the ground of parity, the learned Single Judge was not justified in\n\ndirecting consideration for regularization while placing reliance upon\n\nthe judgment of the Apex Court in\n'The Managing Director, Ajmer\n\nVidhyut Vitran Nigam Ltd., Ajmer and another Vs. Chiggan Lal\n\n35 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -36-\n\nand others', 2022 (2) SCT 176.\n\n33. It is further the case of the Mr. Mittal that the learned\n\nSingle Judge was in error while placing reliance on the judgments\n\npassed in\nCasteribe Rajya Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana\n\n(supra) and\n'Hari Nandan Prasad and another Vs. Employer I/R\n\nto Management of Food Corporation of India and another\n',\n\n(2014) 7 SCC 190, since those cases pertained to power of the labour\n\nCourts to direct regularization.\n\nIt is submitted that the matter has\n\nnow been referred to a Larger Bench as per the judgment in\n'Oil and\n\nNatural Gas Corporation Vs. Krishan Gopal and others\n', 2020\n\n(1) CLR 535.\n\n34. He\nplaced reliance upon\nthe judgment rendered by one\n\nof us (G.S. Sandhawalia, J.)\nin 'Gurpreet Kaur Vs.

State of Punjab and others', 2013 (2) SCT\n\n363. He further pointed out from LPA No.560 of 2021 that one of\n\nthe writ petitioners was appointed as per his own pleaded case in the\n\nyear 2001 and, therefore, was never covered under the provisions of\n\nPolicy-2003 and, therefore, directions could not have been issued in\n\nhis case. Whereas Mr. Bhandari has submitted that an affidavit had\n\nbeen filed in the year said case before the learned Single Judge and\n\npersons who had been recruited in the year 2003 were also\n\nregularized.\n\n36 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -37-\n\n35. Mr. R.K. Malik, Senior Advocate appearing in LPA\n\nNo.106 of 2021 also pointed out that for its employees, the Forest\n\nDepartment had recommended regularization under the 2003-Policy\n\nwhile referring to Annexures P-5 to P-10 and, therefore, there is no\n\nsubstance in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed,\n\nkeeping in view the directions issued by the Coordinate Bench while\n\nremanding the matter on 18.03.2019.\n\n36. Counsels for the employees, on the other hand,\n\nsubmitted that once there was a policy in place, the writ petitioners\n\nwere seeking the enforcement of their legal rights which is being\n\nsettled and even the Apex Court recognized the said aspect that a\n\nMandamus could be issued in favour of the employees once there\n\nwas an enforceable legal right as per the policy framed by the\n\nGovernment itself and referred to para No.52 of the judgment of Uma\n\nDevi (supra). Similarly, it is contended that in Malathi Dass (Retd.)\n\n(supra), directions had been issued wherein State had been held to\n\ncomply and regularize the services of the respondents who had been\n\nleft out in view of the fact that certain legal rights had accrued to\n\nthem prior to the judgment in Uma Devi (supra). Apparently, in view\n\nof the interim order passed in CWP-4618-1996 titled Sanjeev Dev\n\nVs. State of Haryana, the process on the said policy of 1996 was kept\n\non hold. The said writ petition was eventually dismissed on\n\n07.12.1996 and accordingly, directions which had been issued on\n\n08.04.1996 were withdrawn on 15.05.1997 and the process of\n\n37 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -38-\n\nregularization of ad hoc and daily wages in accordance with the\n\nGovernment instrcutions dated 17.03.1996 and 18.03.1996 were\n\nbrought in force once again.\nOn 01.02.1999, in view of the\n\ndirections issued in CWP-15602-1996 titled\nMange Ram & others\n\nVs. State of Haryana\n, on 24.02.1998 and the policy was drawn up\n\nregarding regularization of Group-D employees wherein 5 years\n\ncontinuous service on the date of issuance of the instructions was\n\nprescribed with various conditions such as the employee should have\n\nbeen recruited through the Employment Exchange or directly\n\nappointed by the appointing authority after obtaining the non-\n\navailability certificate from the Employment Exchange and with the\n\nprescribed qualifications and the work and conduct being\n\nsatisfactory.\n\nThe issue which arises for consideration is regarding the power\nto issue a writ of mandamus on the question of a legal right\nwhich is enforceable\n\n37. The recognized and accepted principle regarding the\n\nissuance of a writ of mandamus is that a right which could be\n\nenforced on account of the authorities not doing their duty which\n\nthey are required to do as per the statute or an enforceable policy as\n\nsuch. Reliance can be placed upon the judgment of the Apex Court\n\npassed in\nAnandi Mukta Sadguru Shree Mukta Jeevandasswasi\n\nSuvarna Jaya Vs. V.R. Rudani and others\n, AIR 1989 SC 1607. In\n\nthe said case the dispute was regarding the right of teachers to get\n\nsalary which had been allowed by the High Court of Gujarat. The\n\n38 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -39-\n\nmaintainability of the writ petition before the High Court was\n\nchallenged on the ground that institution set up under the Trust Act is\n\nnot amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court being a\n\nprivate institution. The argument was rejected by holding that\n\nservice conditions were binding upon the management and the aided\n\ninstitution was discharging public function by way of imparting\n\neducation to students, subject to rules and regulations of the\n\naffiliating university. It was, accordingly, held that Courts are not\n\nbound hand and foot by the previous law and a writ could be issued\n\nto any person or authority for the enforcement of any of the\n\nfundamental rights and for any other purpose keeping in view the\n\nnature of the duty imposed upon the body. It was also held that\n\nmandamus is a very wide remedy which must be easily available to\n\nreach injustice wherever it is found and technicalities should not\n\ncome in the way of granting the relief. Relevant portion of\nthe said\n\njudgment\nreads as under:-\n\n\"22. Here again we may point out that mandamus\ncannot be denied on the ground that the duty to be enforced\nis not imposed by the statute. Commenting on the\ndevelopment of this law, Professor De Smith states: \"To be\nenforceable by mandamus a public duty does not\nnecessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It may be\nsufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter,\ncommon law, custom or even contract.\" (Judicial Review of\nAdministrative 'Act 4th Ed. p. 540). We share this view.\nThe judicial control over the fast expanding maze of bodies\neffecting the rights of the people should not be put into\n\n39 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -40-\n\nwater-tight compartment. It should remain flexible to meet\nthe requirements of variable circumstances. Mandamus is a\nvery wide remedy which must be easily available 'to reach\ninjustice wherever it is found'. Technicalities should not\ncome in the way of granting that relief under\nArticle 226.\n\nWe, therefore, reject the contention urged for the appellants\non the maintainability of the writ petition.\"\n\n38. The argument, thus, raised by counsel for the State that\n\nthe writ Court would not have such jurisdiction to issue orders for\n\nconsideration for regularization is an argument of despair. It is to be\n\nnoticed that the writ petitioners before the writ Court were asking for\n\ntheir legal rights as per the policies framed by the State prior to the\n\ndecision passed in the case of Uma Devi (supra). It is not disputed\n\nthat thereafter, also the State had framed policy in pursuance of the\n\ndirections of this High Court to grant the benefit to similarly situated\n\nset of persons. Thus, it does not lie in the mouth of the State to hold\n\nout to the contrary. Rather the Apex Court recognized the right to\n\nseek the legal right to be permanently absorbed once there was a\n\npolicy in place in Uma Devi (supra). The Constitution Bench in that\n\ncase was dealing with the cleavage of opinion arising out of the\n\nDivision Bench of Karnataka High Court and had noticed that by\n\nvirtue of the directions issued by it earlier in Dharwad Distt. P.W.D.\n\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Association and others Vs. State\n\nof Karnataka and others, (1999) 2 SCC 396, the High Court of\n\nKarnataka had issued directions while granting the relief of\n\nregularization. It was in such circumstances, held that in the absence\n\n40 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -41-\n\nof any scheme, consideration for regularization by virtue of\n\nprovisions under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India was not\n\npermissible since in that case the employees could not show that they\n\nhad any enforceable right to be permanently absorbed. Relevant para\n\nof the judgment reads as under:\n\n\"52. Normally, what is sought for by such temporary\nemployees when they approach the court, is the issue of\na writ of mandamus directing the employer, the State or\nits instrumentalities, to absorb them in permanent\nservice or to allow them to continue. In this context, the\nquestion arises whether a mandamus could be issued in\nfavour of such persons. At this juncture, it will be proper\nto refer to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this\nCourt in\nDr. Rai Shivendra Bahadur Vs. The Governing\nBody of the Nalanda College\n[(1962) Supp. 2 SCR 144].\nThat case arose out of a refusal to promote the writ\npetitioner therein as the Principal of a college. This\nCourt held that in order that a mandamus may issue to\ncompel the authorities to do something, it must be\nshown that the statute imposes a legal duty on the\nauthority and the aggrieved party had a legal right under\nthe statute or rule to enforce it. This classical position\ncontinues and a mandamus could not be issued in favour\nof the employees directing the government to make them\npermanent since the employees cannot show that they\nhave an enforceable legal right to be permanently\nabsorbed or that the State has a legal duty to make them\npermanent.\"\n\n39. In the case of Godavari Sugar Mills Ltd. Vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra, (2011) 2 SCC 439, the issue before the Apex Court\n\n41 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -42-\n\nwas regarding the claim for recovery of interest on the compensation\n\npayable as per the Award granted under the\nMaharashtra Agricultural\n\nLands (Ceiling and Holdings) Act, 1961\n. The High Court had denied\n\nthe said benefit on the ground that it was for enforcement of a money\n\nclaim. Resultantly, it was held that the said finding was not justified,\n\nsince the High Court while enforcing fundamental or statutory right\n\nhad the power to give consequential relief by ordering payment of\n\nmoney realized by the Government without the authority of law and\n\nit involves a question arising out of public law functions on the part\n\nof the State or its authorities. Access to justice was provided by way\n\nof a public law remedy under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia, which could not be denied.\nAccordingly, reliance was placed\n\nupon the judgment passed in\nSanjana M. Wig Vs. Hindustan\n\nPetroleum Corporation Ltd.\n, (2005) 8 SCC 242 while allowing the\n\nspecial leave petition.\n\n40. Recently the Apex Court in the case of\nAnil Kumar Vs.\n\nUnion of India and others\n, (2019) 5 SCC 91 set aside the orders of\n\nthe Patna High Court which had denied that the claim for\n\nappointment on Group-D posts which was to be considered by\n\ngranting an age relaxation, if required by noticing that there was a\n\nbinding policy circular formulated by the Union of India in the\n\nMinistry of Railways. It was held that the grant of appointment to\n\npersons displaced as a result of acquisition is a matter which is\n\nwithin the purview of the policy discretion. Relevant portion of the\n\n42 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -43-\n\nsaid judgment reads as under:-\n\n\"20. For the above reasons, we have come to the\nconclusion that the rejection of the claim of the appellant\nwas contrary to the terms of the binding policy circular\nformulated by the Union of India in the Ministry of\nRailways. Undoubtedly, the grant of appointment to\npersons displaced as a result of acquisition is a matter\nwhich is within the purview of the policy discretion. No\nmandamus can lie in the absence of a policy. However,\nwhere a policy has been\nlaid down by\nthe Union\ngovernment as in the present case, the terms of the policy\ncan be enforced. The rejection of the claim of the\nAppellant was for extraneous reasons and based on\nirrelevant considerations. Government in the Ministry of\nRailways formulated a policy. The failure of\nimplementation results in a failure of social justice. The\npolicy circulars were substantive attempts to enhance\nsocial welfare. Denial of benefits to the appellant has led to\na long and tortuous road to justice.\"\n\n41. Thus, keeping in view the settled principles of law the\n\nargument raised by Mr. Mittal that the writ petition is not\n\nmaintainable for the enforcement of the policies of the State is\n\nwithout any basis. More so when the claim is based upon the\n\nprinciple of violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution and similarly\n\nsituated persons have been granted the benefit under the same\n\npolicies, whereas the writ petitioners were wrongly denied the said\n\nconcession. Though it was the duty of the State officials to act upon\n\nthe policies of the State itself.\n\nContinuity of Service\n\n43 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -44-\n\n42. The common thread in most of these cases from the facts\n\nnarrated above is that the writ petitioners were in service at the same\n\npoint of time and had served for a considerable period and were\n\nreinstated by order of the Labour Court. The award of reinstatement\n\ncarried benefit of continuity of service, though backwages have been\n\ndenied in certain circumstances to the extent of 50%, either on\n\nconcession or on the settled principles that the employees would\n\nhave worked elsewhere. Underlined principles, thus, would be that\n\nthe writ petitioners would be deemed to be in service from the date of\n\ntheir initial appointment on the reinstatement. It was, thus, the case of\n\nthe writ petitioners that the eligible persons were to be considered for\n\nregularization in view of the regularization policies in force and\n\nwhich had to be implemented by the officials of the State\n\nGovernment. Facts are going to be noticed in detail in all cases that\n\nthe termination orders were passed after 15 years of service at the\n\nbehest of the State Government officials and some of the employees\n\nafter the Award were at the fag end of service, who had worked for\n\nover 30 years. Therefore, to deny them regularization on the\n\ntechnical ground that there was no availability of sanctioned posts\n\nwould be in contradiction to the fact that their services were being\n\nused for over 30 years and now it is not for the State to turn around to\n\nsay that the work is not available which would be wholly unjustified.\n\n43.\nIn\nNihal Singh & others Vs. State of Punjab & others\n,\n\n(2013) 14 SCC 65, the Apex Court while issuing directions for\n\n44 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -45-\n\nregularization of the Special Police Officers, keeping in mind the\n\nlimitations as imposed by the Constitution Bench in Uma Devi\n\n(supra) had held that the State could not take the defence that there\n\nwere no sanctioned posts for the appellants and it is for the State to\n\ncreate them by a conscious choice on the basis of some rational\n\nassessment. The judgment passed by this Court was set aside and\n\nnecessary directions were issued by holding that the persons had\n\nbeen appointed by the competent authority. Relevant portion of the\n\njudgment reads as under:\n\n19. Coming to the judgment of the division bench of\nthe High Court of Punjab & Haryana in LPA No.209 of\n1992 where the claims for regularization of the similarly\nsituated persons were rejected on the ground that no regular\ncadre or sanctioned posts are available for regularization of\ntheir services, the High Court may be factually right in\nrecording that there is no regularly constituted cadre and\nsanctioned posts against which recruitments of persons like\nthe appellants herein were made. However, that does not\nconclusively decide the issue on hand. The creation of a\ncadre or sanctioning of posts for a cadre is a matter\nexclusively within the authority of the State. That the State\ndid not choose to create a cadre but chose to make\nappointments of persons creating contractual relationship\nonly demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the exercise of the\npower available under\nsection 17\nof the Act. The\nappointments made have never been terminated thereby\nenabling various banks to utilize the services of employees\nof the State for a long period on nominal wages and without\nmaking available any other service benefits which are\navailable to the other employees of the State, who are\n\n45 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -46-\n\ndischarging functions similar to the functions that are being\ndischarged by the appellants.\n\n20. No doubt that the powers under\nsection 17\nare\nmeant for meeting the exigencies contemplated under it,\nsuch as, riot or disturbance which are normally expected to\nbe of a short duration. Therefore, the State might not have\ninitially thought of creating either a cadre or permanent\nposts.\n\n21. But we do not see any justification for the State\nto take a defence that after permitting the utilisation of the\nservices of large number of people like the appellants for\ndecades to say that there are no sanctioned posts to absorb\nthe appellants. Sanctioned posts do not fall from heaven.\nState has to create them by a conscious choice on the basis\nof some rational assessment of the need.\n\n22. The question is whether this court can compel the\nState of Punjab to create posts and absorb the appellants\ninto the services of the State on a permanent basis\nconsistent with the Constitution Bench decision of this\ncourt in\nUmadevi\n's case.\n\nTo answer this question, the ratio\ndecidendi of the\nUmadevi\n's case is required to be\nexamined. In that case, this Court was considering the\nlegality of the action of the State in resorting to irregular\nappointments without reference to the duty to comply with\nthe proper appointment procedure contemplated by the\nConstitution.\n\n\"4. ... The Union, the States, their departments and\ninstrumentalities have resorted to irregular\nappointments, especially in the lower rungs of the\nservice, without reference to the duty to ensure a\nproper appointment procedure through the Public\nService Commissions or otherwise as per the rules\nadopted and to permit these irregular appointees or\nthose appointed on contract or on daily wages, to\n\n46 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -47-\n\ncontinue year after year, thus, keeping out those who\nare qualified to apply for the post concerned and\ndepriving them of an opportunity to compete for the\npost. It has also led to persons who get employed,\nwithout the following of a regular procedure or even\nthrough the backdoor or on daily wages,\napproaching the courts, seeking directions to make\nthem permanent in their posts and to prevent regular\nrecruitment to the posts concerned. The courts have\nnot always kept the legal aspects in mind and have\noccasionally even stayed the regular process of\nemployment being set in motion and in some cases,\neven directed that these illegal, irregular or improper\nentrants be absorbed into service. A class of\nemployment which can only be called \"litigious\nemployment\", has risen like a phoenix seriously\nimpairing the constitutional scheme. Such orders are\npassed apparently in exercise of the wide powers\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. Whether the\nwide powers under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\nare intended to be used for a purpose certain to\ndefeat the concept of social justice and equal\nopportunity for all, subject to affirmative action in\nthe matter of public employment as recognised by\nour Constitution, has to be seriously pondered over.\"\n\n44. Merely because the policies were withdrawn at the time\n\nwhen the claim was made for reinstatement would not take away the\n\nright which had fructified to them on account of having continuity of\n\nservice and, therefore, the argument which has been raised by the\n\ncounsel for the State that earlier rules, regulations and instructions\n\n2003 onwards were not in force is without any basis. Similar\n\n47 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -48-\n\nargument raised by the counsel for the State pertaining to the\n\nDepartment of Irrigation in\nLPA-836-2013 'The State of Haryana\n\nVs. Mohammad Farookh & another\n' was rejected, wherein the\n\nemployees had been engaged as daily wagers in July 1990 and on\n\n01.11.1992 and whose services had been terminated in the year 1998.\n\nThe learned Single Judge had directed regularization from the date\n\nthe juniors were regularised by noticing that though the policy\n\ncircular dated 01.10.2003 had been withdrawn, but similarly situated\n\npersons had been made regular and, therefore, deemed fixation was\n\nto be there on account of the continuity of service given by the\n\nLabour Court and the workmen were treated to be in service from\n\n30.09.2003. Relevant portion of the judgment dated 30.04.2013\n\npassed in LPA-836-2013 reads as under:-\n\n\"It is true that the policy circular dated 1.10.2003\nwas later on withdrawn by the State Government on\n9.5.2007 after the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin State of Karnataka versus Uma Devi and others, 2006\n(4) SCC 1. The fact remains that before withdrawal of the\npolicy, hundreds of daily wagers/contractual employees\nwere made regular under the said policy. The respondents\nwere also in service before withdrawal of the abovestated\npolicy and in view of the Labour Court's Awards which\nhave attained finality, they shall be deemed to be in service\non 30.9.2003. As regard to the qualifications, the learned\nSingle Judge has found and rightly so that there are no\nrules/instructions prescribing any qualification for the post\nof Beldars. Similarly, the fact that the respondents were\nappointed in the years 1990 & 1992 and had rendered more\n\n48 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -49-\n\nthan 8 and 6 years service, respectively, as daily wagers\nbefore their retrenchment, is sufficient enough to infer that\nthey were appointed against regular work. That apart, it is\nnot the case of the appellants that no daily\nwager/contractual employee engaged after the years 1990-\n92 was made regular.\n\nNo interference with the impugned order is thus,\ncalled for.\n\nDismissed.\"\n\n45. It is also to be noticed from the above sequence of\n\nevents as reproduced above in paragraph Nos. 8 to 26 that the State\n\nitself had issued notification on 13.04.2007 withdrawing the four\n\npolicies starting from 18.03.1996 including the one dated\n\n01.10.2003. Thereafter, it had issued necessary notification dated\n\n18.06.2014 wherein it was specific provided that the left over Group\n\nC and D employees working on ad hoc/ contract/daily wages/work-\n\ncharged who could not be regularized under the regularization policy\n\nas per the earlier four notifications due to administrative reasons, but\n\nwere otherwise eligible were to be regularised with effect from their\n\ndate of regularization. Thus, the State was well aware that on\n\naccount of various contingencies certain set of persons had not been\n\ngranted the benefit, whereas similarly situated persons had been\n\ngranted the benefit. Therefore, an exception was made after the\n\ndecision rendered in Uma Devi (supra) to ensure that persons who\n\nhad been left out be also granted the benefit as granted to their\n\njuniors. The Apex Court also had left a window open to the State for\n\nproviding an exception which would be clear from the underlying\n\n49 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -50-\n\npara in Uma Devi's case (supra), same reads as under:\n\n\"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases\nwhere irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as\nexplained in\nS.V. NARAYANAPPA\n(supra),\nR.N.\nNANJUNDAPPA\n(supra), and\nB.N. NAGARAJAN\n(supra),\nand referred to in paragraph 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been\nmade and the employees have continued to work for ten years\nor more but without the intervention of orders of courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularization of the services of\nsuch employees may have to be considered on merits in the\nlight of the principles settled by this Court in the cases above\nreferred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context,\nthe Union of India, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to regularize as a one time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not\nunder cover of orders of courts or of tribunals and should\nfurther ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill\nthose vacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in\ncases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being\nnow employed. The process must be set in motion within six\nmonths from this date. We also clarify that regularization, if\nany already made, but not subjudice, need not be reopened\nbased on this judgment, but there should be no further by-\npassing of the constitutional requirement and regularizing or\nmaking permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\nconstitutional scheme.\"\n\n46. A three Judge Bench of the Apex Court in Official\n\nLiquidator Vs. Dayanand and others, (2008) 10 SCC 1 while\n\nnoticing the observations in Uma Devi (supra) also held that where\n\nemployees have legitimate expectations which have been deprived by\n\n50 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -51-\n\nthe administrative authority, which in the past had been permitted\n\nand that there are some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which\n\nhe had been given an opportunity to comment. Relevant\n\nobservations made in Uma Devi (supra) read as under:-\n\n\"The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\nadministrative authority affect the person by depriving him\nof some benefit or advantage which either\n\n(i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker\nto enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be\npermitted to continue to do until there have been\ncommunicated to him some rational grounds for\nwithdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity\nto comment; or\n\n(ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker that\nthey will not be withdrawn without giving him first an\nopportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they\nshould not be withdrawn.\"\n\n47. Merely on account of a subsequent policy framed by the\n\nState, which was subject matter of challenge and was eventually\n\nstruck down in\nYogesh Tyagi\n(supra), it would not lie in the mouth\n\nof the State that it had to comply with the issue of the interim orders\n\npassed by this Court which had nothing to do with the policies,\n\nwhich were in force earlier and were not subject matter of challenge\n\nwhich was only qua policies dated 16.06.2014, 18.06.2014 and\n\n07.07.2014, which would be further clear from the communication\n\ndated 03.06.2016. Though initially the State had issued a letter dated\n\n15.09.2016 directing that no further regularization of service of\n\nemployees be made, but it was clarified on 18.10.2017 that policy\n\n51 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -52-\n\nissued on 29.07.2011 is still in force.\n\n48. In the earlier round of litigation also where the benefits\n\nhad been granted of regularization by the learned Single Judge, the\n\nChief Secretary vide communication dated 21.12.2018 had rather\n\ndirected that creation of posts of diminishing cadre be made. The\n\nFinance Department was asked to give its advise for the same and\n\nthat payment of arrears of regular pay scales were restricted to 38\n\nmonths prior to the date of actual regularization. Merely because an\n\nappeal was filed in one case wherein stay was granted, there was a\n\nchange of heart regarding the earlier instructions. Thereafter,\n\ndirections were issued by the learned Chief Secretary on 31.01.2019\n\nthat appeals be filed in all cases.\n\n49. Thus, reliance can also be placed upon Malathi Dass\n\n(supra) wherein the contempt appeals had been disposed of while\n\nbinding the appellants to regularize the services of the 74 employees\n\nforthwith within a period of 2 months keeping in view the fact that\n\nsimilarly situated persons had been regularized and therefore, the\n\naction of the State in not granting regularization could not be held to\n\nbe sound and justified which is apparent in the present case also once\n\nin principle a decision has been taken to create the posts as a dying\n\ncadre, keeping in view the instructions issued by the State\n\nthemselves.\n\n50. It is to be noticed that the litigation which was initiated\n\nby the employees was in the nature of reference of industrial dispute\n\n52 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -53-\n\nunder the provisions of\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nand was not in\n\nthe nature of an interim order to take continuity in service which\n\nwould bar them from claiming the said relief as has been held by the\n\nApex Court. Thus, their termination per se was found to be illegal\n\nand not sustainable by the Labour Court or by the Writ Court in\n\nappeal and they were directed to be reinstated with continuity in\n\nservice. Therefore, for that reason at various points of time the State\n\ncould not give effect to its own instructions and relief was sought for\n\nregularization. Thus, the employees were justified in claiming the\n\nrelief of regularization on account of the fact that they got\n\nreinstatement by the directions of the Labour Court and thus,\n\ncontinuity of service had been given.\n\n51. Thus, it is apparent that the present round of litigation is\n\nbased on the shifting stands of the Government, which in principle at\n\none stage had decided to create posts and considered the writ\n\npetitioners for regularization. Thus, the judgment passed in\nSheo\n\nNarain Nagar and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n,\n\n(2018) 13 SCC 432 can be directly applied upon in the present facts\n\nand circumstances to show that how the State Government has\n\nmisunderstood the judgment passed in Uma Devi (supra). The Apex\n\nCourt in the said case was dealing with the appeals of the employees,\n\nwho had been appointed in 1993 and had continued in service till\n\n2014 when their services were terminated. In the interim period they\n\nhad got issued directions in their favour for regularization, which had\n\n53 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -54-\n\nnot been acted upon. The termination had been challenged, which\n\nwas declined by the learned Single Judge and upheld in appeal. The\n\nsame was set aside by the Apex Court by noticing that they had\n\nrendered service for 24 years. It was held that there were only\n\nirregular appointments and not illegal appointments and that posts\n\nwere available. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"8. When we consider the prevailing scenario, it is\npainful to note that the decision in Uma Devi (Supra) has\nnot been properly understood and rather wrongly applied\nby various State Governments. We have called for the data\nin the instant case to ensure as to how many employees\nwere working on contract basis or ad-hoc basis or daily-\nwage basis in different State departments. We can take\njudicial notice that widely aforesaid practice is being\ncontinued. Though this Court has emphasised that\nincumbents should be appointed on regular basis as per\nrules but new devise of making appointment on contract\nbasis has been adopted, employment is offered on daily\nwage basis etc. in exploitative forms. This situation was\nnot envisaged by Uma Devi (supra). The prime intendment\nof the decision was that the employment process should be\nby fair means and not by back door entry and in the\navailable pay scale. That spirit of the Uma Devi (supra)\nhas been ignored and conveniently over looked by various\nState Governments/ authorities. We regretfully make the\nobservation that Uma Devi (supra) has not be implemented\nin its true spirit and has not been followed in its pith and\nsubstance. It is being used only as a tool for not\nregularizing the services of incumbents. They are being\ncontinued in service without payment of due salary for\n\n54 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -55-\n\nwhich they are entitled on the basis of\nArticle 14\n, 16\nread\nwith\nArticle 34 (1)(d)\nof the Constitution of India as if\nthey have no constitutional protection as envisaged in\nD.S.\nNakara v. Union of India\n, AIR 1983 SC 130 from cradle to\ngrave. In heydays of life they are serving on exploitative\nterms with no guarantee of livelihood to be continued and\nin old age they are going to be destituted, there being no\nprovision for pension, retiral benefits etc. There is clear\ncontravention of constitutional provisions and aspiration\nof down trodden class. They do have equal rights and to\nmake them equals they require protection and cannot be\ndealt with arbitrarily. The kind of treatment meted out is\nnot only bad but equally unconstitutional and is denial of\nrights.\nWe have to strike a balance to really implement the\nideology of Uma Devi (supra). Thus, the time has come to\nstop the situation where Uma Devi (supra) can be\npermitted to be flouted, whereas, this Court has interdicted\nsuch employment way back in the year 2006. The\nemployment cannot be on exploitative terms, whereas\nUma Devi (supra) laid down that there should not be back\ndoor entry and every post should be filled by regular\nemployment, but a new device has been adopted for\nmaking appointment on payment of paltry system on\ncontract/adhoc basis or otherwise. This kind of action is\nnot permissible, when we consider the pith and substance\nof true spirit in Uma Devi (supra).\n\n9. Coming to the facts of the instant case, there was a\ndirection issued way back in the year 1999, to consider the\nregularization of the appellants. However, regularization\nwas not done. The respondents chose to give minimum of\nthe pay scale, which was available to the regular\nemployees, way back in the year 2000 and by passing an\norder, the appellants were also conferred temporary status\nin the year 2006, with retrospective effect on 2.10.2002.\n\n55 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -56-\n\nAs the respondents have themselves chosen to confer a\ntemporary status to the employees, as such there was\nrequirement at work and posts were also available at the\nparticular point of time when order was passed. Thus, the\nsubmission raised by learned counsel for the respondent\nthat posts were not available, is belied by their own action.\nObviously, the order was passed considering the long\nperiod of services rendered by the appellants, which were\ntaken on exploitative terms.\"\n\n52. Similarly, a three Judges Bench of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of\nRajnish Kumar Mishra and others Vs. State of Uttar\n\nPradesh and others\n, (2019) 17 SCC 648 had allowed the appeals,\n\nwherein appointments were over 12 years and the regularization\n\norders had been withdrawn by the District Judge, who thereafter also\n\nwithdrew the increments and directed recovery of emoluments paid\n\nto the employees. The writ petition was dismissed by the learned\n\nSingle Judge and, thereafter, services were terminated. The said\n\ntermination were also upheld by imposing costs which were modified\n\nby the Division Bench regarding the deletion of costs.\n\nUltimately,\n\nthe Apex Court while placing reliance upon the judgment passed in\n\nSheo Narain Nagar\n(supra) has held that appellants had been\n\nappointed prior to 2001 when the rules of regularization were\n\namended and when the appellants cases were to be considered for\n\nregularization they had put in service for almost 12 years and,\n\ntherefore, the benefit of regularization could not have been\n\nwithdrawn which had been granted earlier.\n\n56 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -57-\n\nForest Department Cases\n\n53. We are thus of the view that the cases can be clubbed\n\ntogether department-wise and, therefore, in the present lot we shall\n\ndecide the cases of the Forest Department and Department of Animal\n\nHusbandry. LPA Nos.688, 540 & 573 of 2021, LPA Nos. 740, 739,\n\n751, 802, 479, 918, 916, 818, 302, 541, 532 & 585 of 2020, LPA\n\nNos.8, 9, 18, 45, 55, 152, 818, 560, 567 and 106 of 2021 and LPA\n\nNos.171 & 148 of 2022, LPA No.536 of 2016 pertain to the Forest\n\nDepartment and LPA Nos.444 & 508 of 2020 are pertaining to\n\nDepartment of Animal Husbandry.\n\nFacts of LPA-540-2021\n\n54.

The defence of the State in the written statement was\n\nthat the policies had been withdrawn and there is a delay in\n\napproaching the Court to seek regularization as per the policy dated\n\n01.10.2003 and that the policy of 2014 had been quashed.\n\n57 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -58-\n\n56. A perusal of the order dated 10.02.2020 passed by the\n\nlearned Single Judge would go on to show that counsel for the State\n\nhad submitted that the State was in process of regularization of the\n\nemployees and thus, directions were issued for regularization with all\n\nconsequential benefits with 6% interest and benefit be given from the\n\ndate the juniors to the petitioner had been regularised. Thus, in view\n\nof the principles discussed above, once his juniors of 2 years later\n\nhave been regularized, no case is made out to interfere.\n\nFacts of LPA-573-2021\n\n57. In the present case, the writ petitioner No.1 Krishan\n\nKumar was appointed in the year 2000, whereas writ petitioner No.2-\n\nMohinder was appointed in the year 1998 as daily wager. Service of\n\nwrit petitioner No.1 were terminated on 16.11.2013 and that of writ\n\npetitioner No.2 on 20.09.2013.

Rather the learned Single Judge was\n\nforced to comment upon the conduct of the Forest Department, since\n\nthe record was not produced before the Labour Court in spite of\n\ngiving an undertaking to do so. It was noticed by the learned Single\n\nJudge that as such was throwing out daily wage workers without\n\nfollowing due process of law and leave them to battle it out in Court\n\nfor year and thus told to accept reinstatement without backwages was\n\nunjustified. Thus, regularization was sought as per the policy dated\n\n01.10.2003.\n\n59 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -60-\n\n62. The stand of the State was that she had slept over the\n\nmatter and not entitled for regularization, since she had not worked\n\nafter March, 1996.\n\n63. The learned Single Judge had decided the writ petition\n\non 31.01.2020 while relying upon the judgments passed in\nMalathi\n\nDas\n(supra) and\nHari Nandan Prasad\n(supra) and had come to the\n\nconclusion that similarly situated persons had already been\n\nregularized vide Annexure P-5, which fact had not been admitted or\n\ndenied in the written statement. The only defence was that the earlier\n\npolicies were withdrawn. It was noticed that the official of the\n\ndepartment did not produce the record before the Labour Court.\n\nAccordingly, continuity of service had been given and directions\n\nwere issued to regularize the petitioner w.e.f. 01.10.2003.

The\n\nwrit petitioners were not appointed on sanctioned vacant posts. It\n\nwas also stated all the policies stood withdrawn after the judgment\n\npassed in the case of Uma Devi (supra).\n\n66.

The stand of the State was that the writ petitioner did not\n\nfulfill the conditions of policy dated 29.07.2011 and he was not\n\nworking against duly sanctioned vacant post. The name of the writ\n\npetitioner was not sponsored through employment exchange and\n\nthere is a stay on the regularization policy of the year 2014 and\n\nafterwards.\n\n72.

The stand of the State was that petitioners were never\n\nappointed and as such never terminated by the respondent-\n\n63 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -64-\n\ndepartment.

Counsel for the State had submitted that the writ\n\npetitioners were not entitled for regularization as per policy dated\n\n07/18.03.1996 as they had not worked for 3 years continuously prior\n\nto the date of issuance of notification and they can be regularized in\n\nview of the notification dated 18.06.2014, but the same has been\n\nquashed.\n\n76.

Petitioner No.1-Chander Wati\n\nwas reinstated vide Award dated 12.04.2001 (Annexure P-3) with\n\ncontinuity of service and full backwages. Similar orders were passed\n\nin the case of other writ petitioners.

Since the requests of the writ petitioners for\n\nregularization were not considered, they filed writ petitions, which\n\nwere disposed of with the directions to consider the case of the writ\n\npetitions by passing a speaking order. In compliance of the orders\n\npassed by the learned Single Judge, orders (Annexures P-4 to P-6)\n\nwere passed by the respondent-department while rejecting the case of\n\nthe writ petitioners.

They were not entitled for regularization of services\n\nunder any policy/instructions.\n\n79.

The stand of the State in all three cases was similar to\n\nthe extent that policies issued by the respondent-State stood\n\nwithdrawn. The writ petitioners were not appointed on sanctioned\n\nvacant posts and they could not be regularized, in view of the\n\njudgment rendered in the case of Uma Devi (supra). Counsel for the\n\nState had submitted that the writ petitioners had not completed 240\n\ndays in a calendar year from the date of their termination.\nHowever,\n\nit had been admitted that services of the juniors to the writ petitioners\n\nwere regularized in view of the judgment passed in CWP No.9873 of\n\n2013 titled as\nRaj Kumar Vs.

In the reply filed by the respondent-State it was stated\n\nthat policies issued from time to time did not cover the case of the\n\nwrit petitioner as the same were applicable on the employees\n\nappointed against sanctioned vacant posts.

Accordingly,\n\nrespondents were directed to regularize services of the petitioners\n\nw.e.f 01.10.2003 alongwith all consequential benefits from the date\n\nwhen the juniors were regularized as the principle of equality would\n\nbe applicable.\n\nFacts of LPA Nos.567, 560 of 2021 and LPA No.55 of 2021\n\n101. In the present appeals, the writ petitioners were\n\nappointed between the years 1983 to 2003. The services of the writ\n\npetitioners were terminated on 20.12.2011 and 01.11.2013 (in CWP\n\nNo.25072 of 2016), on 19.09.2008 and 01.03.2013 (in CWP\n\nNo.26393 of 2016) and on 07.04.2009 and 29.11.2011 (in CWP\n\nNo.26748 of 2016). Vide separate Awards passed by the Labour\n\n73 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -74-\n\nCourt, Ambala they were ordered to be reinstated with continuity of\n\nservice and 50% backwages. Thus, they sought regularization by\n\nfiling abovestated writ petitions.\n\n102. The stand of the State in all three cases was similar to\n\nthe extent that policies issued by the respondent-State stood\n\nwithdrawn. The writ petitioners were not appointed on sanctioned\n\nvacant posts and they could not be regularized, in view of the\n\njudgment rendered in the case of Uma Devi (supra). Counsel for the\n\nState had submitted that the writ petitioners had not actually worked\n\nfor 3 years continuously prior to the issuance of regularization\n\npolicies and their services could not be regularized in view of the\n\nnotification dated 18.06.2014, which had also been quashed by this\n\nCourt.\n\n103. Learned Single Judge allowed the writ petitions vide a\n\ncommon judgment dated 10.02.2020 in view of the earlier judgment\n\npassed in CWP No.16044 of 2015 'Veermati Vs. State of Haryana\n\nand another' and the writ petitioners were ordered to be regularized\n\nwith all consequential benefits at par with their juniors, in view of the\n\npolicy dated 18.03.1996 and 01.10.2003.\n\nFacts of LPA-8-2021\n\n104. In the present case, the writ petitioner Sahib Kaur was\n\nappointed as Beldar-cum-Mali in the year 1985. Her services were\n\nterminated on 01.04.2000. She was ordered to be reinstated with\n\ncontinuity of service and 50% backwages w.e.f. 13.11.2000 vide\n\n74 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -75-\n\nAward dated 21.01.2008 passed by the Labour Court. Thus, she\n\nsought regularization by filing CWP-3229-2017 on the ground that\n\nsimilarly situated persons as well as juniors to her had been\n\nregularized as per Annexures P-7 and P-13.\n\n105. In the reply filed by the respondent-State they did not\n\ndispute RTI information given (Annexure P-7). It was also\n\nmentioned that the Government had withdrawn the regularization\n\npolicies. Counsel for the State had argued that the petitioner did not\n\nfulfill the qualification and there was no sanctioned post available.\n\n106. Learned Single Judge rightly allowed the writ petition\n\non 11.02.2020 and regularization was ordered, in view of the policy\n\ndated 01.10.2003 with all consequential benefits at par with juniors\n\nwho had been regularized as per Annexure P-7 as the petitioner had\n\n35 years of service by then.\n\nFacts of LPA No.106 of 2021\n\n107. In the present appeal, the writ petitioners were appointed\n\nbetween the years 1988 to 1992 on daily wage basis. The writ\n\npetitioners are stated to have worked for more than 10 to 20 year and\n\ntheir appointments were made according to Haryana Forest Manual\n\nagainst sanctioned posts. The writ petitioners had approached this\n\ncourt by way of CWP No.17508 of 2014 claiming regularization and\n\nthe same was withdrawn and their case was not considered again in\n\nview of the judgment passed in\nYogesh Tyagi\n(supra). Thus, they\n\nsought regularization by filing CWP No.13294 of 2015.\n\n75 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -76-\n\n108. The stand of the State in the written statement was that\n\nclaim of the writ petitioners was denied on the ground that\n\nnotification dated 18.06.2014 was challenged before this Court and\n\noperation of the same had been stayed and there were no sanctioned\n\nposts available.\n\n109. Learned Single Judge allowed the writ petitions vide\n\njudgment dated 31.01.2020. It was held that respondents were\n\ncorrect in not regularizing their services as per notification dated\n\n18.06.2014 keeping in view the judgment passed in\nYogesh Tyagi\n\n(supra), however the petitioner was entitled for regularization as per\n\npolicy dated 01.10.2003 alongwith all consequential benefits.\n\nFacts of LPA No.536 of 2016\n\n110. In the present case the employee Sita Ram had been\n\nappointed as Beldar-cum-Mali on 01.01.1988 and continued to work\n\ntill 08.04.1998. He had raised the industrial dispute on account of the\n\nfact that in vide demand notice dated 28.04.1998 his service had been\n\nwrongly terminated and his juniors were still working.\n\n111. The Labour Court, Rohtak vide Award dated 04.01.2006\n\nhad accepted the plea on account of the fact that the entire record had\n\nnot been produced and even the management had failed to file the\n\nwritten statement and, therefore, directed reinstatement on the\n\nprevious post with continuity of service.\n\n112. His request for regularization was rejected on 14.01.2013\n\non the ground that he alongwith other was not originally appointed\n\n76 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -77-\n\non the vacant post and that the policies of 01.10.2003 and 10.02.2004\n\nhad been withdrawn. It was, however, admitted that out of the 15\n\ncases which were being dealt with, 7 labourers had been regularized on\n\n14.10.2006 in light of the Policy of 2003. Resultantly, the claim was\n\nrejected on the ground that the legal notice was served on 18.02.2012\n\nbut not received and the notice received on 14.12.2012 was being\n\nreplied and on account of delay the claim was rejected. Subsequently\n\nthe writ petition was filed by the wife since the employee had expired\n\non 18.01.2013.\n\n113. The learned Single Judge vide order dated 14.05.2015\n\nnoticed that similarly situated employees who were stated to be\n\njunior had been regularized, in pursuance of order passed in\n\nLPA No.582 of 2013, on 18.07.2014 (Annexure P-7). A perusal of\n\nwhich would go on to show that the regularization was done from\n\n01.10.2003 and the said employees had also been given the benefit of\n\nreinstatement by various awards of the Labour Court. Thus, it has\n\nbeen rightly held that the claim of the writ petitioner could not be\n\ndenied on the ground that he was not physically present on the role of\n\nestablishment and, therefore, the benefits were directed to be granted\n\nof regularization form the date when his juniors were regularized.\n\n114. The above facts would go on to show that similarly\n\nsituated persons who had also been retrenched and put back in\n\nservice were given the benefit of 2003 Policy and, therefore, we are\n\nof the considered opinion that the order of the learned Single Judge\n\n77 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -78-\n\ndoes not suffer from any infirmity.\n\nCases pertaining to Department of Animal Husbandry\n\nFacts of LPA No.444 of 2020\n\n115. The learned Single Judge vide order dated 27.02.2020\n\ndirected regularization in terms of policy dated 01.10.2003 keeping\n\nin view the fact that the employee had joined on daily wage as\n\nChowkidar w.e.f. 01.05.1998. He had worked till 30.06.1999 and\n\nretrenched and the juniors had been retained and he was thus\n\nreinstated vide award dated 28.05.2004 with continuity of service but\n\nwithout any back wages by the Labour Court. It had been pleaded\n\nthat on 29.04.2005, respondents had regularized the services of 9\n\nsimilarly situated persons w.e.f. 01.10.2003 vide Annexure P-3. The\n\ndefence in the written statement was that the said persons were\n\nappointed at an earlier point of time and they were senior and they\n\nfulfilled the terms of the policy. There was no seniority of daily\n\nwage labourers in the Department. Thus, on the principle of\n\nsimilarity the benefit was granted keeping in view the fact that there\n\nwas a policy in force and parity was to be maintained with respect of\n\nall employees once the benefit of continuity had been given by the\n\nLabour Court. Thus, it was directed that the employee who had\n\ncompleted 22 years of service and only on account of the fact that his\n\nservices had been retrenched, benefit had been denied to him and\n\ntherefore, he was entitled for consideration on account of continuity\n\nof service granted to him and learned Single Judge was correct in\n\n78 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -79-\n\ngranting the said benefit.\n\nFacts of LPA No.508 of 2020\n\n116. The learned Single Judge had, thus, granted the benefit\n\nof regularization vide order dated 05.03.2020 as per the policy dated\n\n01.10.2003 by noticing that the writ petitioner was appointed on\n\ndaily wages on 01.01.1994 and worked till 31.10.1994 and an award\n\ndated 02.04.1996 had come in his favour and he was duly regularized\n\nwith full back wages. His services were again terminated on\n\n01.08.2002 and he was successful on 04.08.2003 before the Labour\n\nCourt and he was taken back in service again with the benefit of\n\ncontinuity of previous service and joined on 03.11.2003. Similarly\n\nsituated persons had already been regularized as per policy of 2003\n\nand therefore, the benefit was granted. It is thus apparent that on\n\naccount of wrongful termination and other persons having been given\n\ndue regularization vide Annexure P-4 and one Satbir was appointed\n\nin 1994 which would be clear from the averments made in para No.8\n\nof LPA-444-2020.\n\n117. In LPA-508-2020, the benefit was granted vide\n\njudgment dated 05.03.2020 since the employee was initially\n\nappointed on 01.01.1994 and worked till 31.10.1994. He had been\n\nreinstated vide award dated 02.04.1996 and second reinstatement\n\ntook place on 01.08.2002 and a compromise had taken place on\n\n24.10.2003 under\nSection 12(3)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\n\nHe was given continuity of service but no back wages which would\n\n79 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -80-\n\nbe clear from Annexure P-2. In such circumstances, regularization\n\nwas sought again on the ground that juniors had been regularized and\n\nhis case had been rejected on the ground that the terms of policy\n\ndated 01.10.2003 were not fulfilled without noticing the fact that\n\nthere was unfair labour practice time and again dispensing with the\n\nservice. Therefore, keeping in view these factors the learned Single\n\nJudge had directed consideration for regularization vide impugned\n\njudgment dated 05.03.2020 keeping in view the fact that 9 others had\n\nbeen duly regularized vide letter dated 29.04.2005. Thus, no fault\n\ncan be found in the order of the learned Single Judge.\n\n118. Thus keeping in view the judgment in\nState of\n\nKarnataka Vs. M.L.Kesari & others\n, (2010) 9 SCC 247, we are of\n\nthe considered opinion that the learned Single Judges were well\n\njustified in directing consideration for regularization as the claim was\n\non the basis of the policies which were in effect and were\n\nsupplemented by others. The persons had worked for the requisite\n\nperiod of time and were seeking regularization as per the policies\n\nwhich were invogue at that point of time and they were not\n\ncontinuing in service on account of any litigation and did not have\n\nany interim orders in their favour.\nThe Apex Court had noticed that\n\nthe true effect of the directions passed in Uma Devi (supra) was that\n\npersons who had been continuing for the period of 10 years without\n\ninterim orders of the Tribunals and the employer had not undertaken\n\nthe exercise of regularization within 6 months of the decision in Uma\n\n80 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -81-\n\nDevi (supra) then the exercise was to be taken for the limited view\n\nand it would not disentitle the employees for their right for\n\nregularization as a one-time measure. Appointment of persons which\n\nwas illegal and irregular was clarified to the extent that the illegality\n\nwould be only if the appointee did not possess the required minimum\n\nqualfications and the irregularity would be if the person had been\n\nselected without undergoing the process of open competitive\n\nselection but had the prescribed qualifications. In the present cases\n\nwe are dealing with cases of Class-IV employees employed as\n\nBeldar/Mali/Labourer and, therefore, the said legal impediment\n\nwould not come in the way. Relevant observations reads as under:\n\n5. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against `regularization'\nenunciated in Umadevi, if the following conditions are\nfulfilled :\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for\n10 years or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have\nemployed the employee and continued him in\nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than\nten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not\nbe illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments\nare not made or continued against sanctioned posts\nor where the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the\nappointments will be considered to be illegal. But\n\n81 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -82-\n\nwhere the person employed possessed the\nprescribed qualifications and was working against\nsanctioned posts, but had been selected without\nundergoing the process of open competitive\nselection, such appointments are considered to be\nirregular.\n\nUmadevi casts a duty upon the concerned\nGovernment or instrumentality, to take steps to regularize\nthe services of those irregularly appointed employees who\nhad served for more than ten years without the benefit or\nprotection of any interim orders of courts or tribunals, as a\none-time measure. Umadevi, directed that such one-time\nmeasure must be set in motion within six months from the\ndate of its decision (rendered on 10.4.2006).\n\n6. The term `one-time measure' has to be understood\nin its proper perspective. This would normally mean that\nafter the decision in Umadevi, each department or each\ninstrumentality should undertake a one-time exercise and\nprepare a list of all casual, daily-wage or ad hoc employees\nwho have been working for more than ten years without\nthe intervention of courts and tribunals and subject them to\na process verification as to whether they are working\nagainst vacant posts and possess the requisite qualification\nfor the post and if so, regularize their services.\n\n7. At the end of six months from the date of\ndecision in Umadevi, cases of several daily-wage/ad-\nhoc/casual employees were still pending before Courts.\nConsequently, several departments and instrumentalities\ndid not commence the one-time regularization process. On\nthe other hand, some Government departments or\ninstrumentalities undertook the one-time exercise\nexcluding several employees from consideration either on\nthe ground that their cases were pending in courts or due to\nsheer oversight. In such circumstances, the employees who\n\n82 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -83-\n\nwere entitled to be considered in terms of Para 53 of the\ndecision in Umadevi, will not lose their right to be\nconsidered for regularization, merely because the one-time\nexercise was completed without considering their cases, or\nbecause the six month period mentioned in para 53 of\nUmadevi has expired. The one-time exercise should\nconsider all daily-wage/adhoc/those employees who had\nput in 10 years of continuous service as on 10.4.2006\nwithout availing the protection of any interim orders of\ncourts or tribunals. If any employer had held the one-time\nexercise in terms of para 53 of Umadevi, but did not\nconsider the cases of some employees who were entitled to\nthe benefit of para 53 of Umadevi, the employer concerned\nshould consider their cases also, as a continuation of the\none-time exercise. The one time exercise will be concluded\nonly when all the employees who are entitled to be\nconsidered in terms of Para 53 of Umadevi, are so\nconsidered.\n\n8. The object behind the said direction in para 53 of\nUmadevi is two- fold. First is to ensure that those who\nhave put in more than ten years of continuous service\nwithout the protection of any interim orders of courts or\ntribunals, before the date of decision in Umadevi was\nrendered, are considered for regularization in view of their\nlong service. Second is to ensure that the\ndepartments/instrumentalities do not perpetuate the\npractice of employing persons on daily-wage/ad-hoc/casual\nfor long periods and then periodically regularize them on\nthe ground that they have served for more than ten years,\nthereby defeating the constitutional or statutory provisions\nrelating to recruitment and appointment. The true effect of\nthe direction is that all persons who have worked for more\nthan ten years as on 10.4.2006 (the date of decision in\nUmadevi) without the protection of any interim order of\n\n83 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -84-\n\nany court or tribunal, in vacant posts, possessing the\nrequisite qualification, are entitled to be considered for\nregularization. The fact that the employer has not\nundertaken such exercise of regularization within six\nmonths of the decision in Umadevi or that such exercise\nwas undertaken only in regard to a limited few, will not\ndisentitle such employees, the right to be considered for\nregularization in terms of the above directions in Umadevi\nas a one-time measure.\n\n9. These appeals have been pending for more than\nfour years after the decision in Umadevi. The Appellant\n(Zila Panchayat, Gadag) has not considered the cases of\nrespondents of regularization within six months of the\ndecision in Umadevi or thereafter.\"\n\n119. The Apex Court in\nState of Jharkhand and others Vs.\n\nKamal Prasad and others\n, (2014) 7 SCC 223 while dismissing the\n\nappeals of the State and upholding the judgment of the High Court,\n\nregarding the regularization orders in favour of the Junior Engineers\n\nwho had been working for 29 years was held to be legal and by\n\nholding that they were covered under the exceptions made in Uma\n\nDevi (supra).\n\nResultantly, while placing reliance upon the judgment\n\npassed in\nOlga Tellis & others Vs. Bombay Municipal\n\nCorporation & others\n, (1985) 3 SCC 545, it was held that the High\n\nCourt had rightly come to the conclusion that the action of the State\n\nwas arbitrary and it shocked the conscious of the Court that the\n\npersons had worked for 29 years and had been discharging\n\npermanent nature of duties. Therefore, it was held that the judgment\n\ncould not be vitiated on account of any erroneous finding or suffering\n\n84 of 85\n\n::: Downloaded on - 07-12-2022 23:07:05 :::\n\nLPA No.688 of 2021 and other connected cases (O&M) -85-\n\nfrom any error in law.\n\n120. Thus, we are of the considered opinion that a window\n\nhad been kept open by the State that the policies dated 17.06.1997,\n\n05.11.1999, 01.10.2003, 10.02.2004 were to be applied to persons\n\nwho had not been regularized and, therefore, it does not lie in the\n\nmouth of the counsel for the State to argue that the policies stood\n\nwithdrawn. The learned Single Judges were justified in issuing\n\ndirections for consideration. As noticed above the claim is based on\n\na legal right for seeking issuance of a writ of mandamus and in such\n\ncircumstances it cannot be said that the learned Single Judges were in\n\nerror in allowing the writ petitions. Accordingly, the appeals filed by\n\nthe State are dismissed. All pending civil miscellaneous\n\napplications, if any, are also disposed of.\n\n(G.S.
