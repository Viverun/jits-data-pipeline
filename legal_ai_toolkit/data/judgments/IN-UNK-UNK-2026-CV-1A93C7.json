The controversy pertaining to reservation in promotion for the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with consequential seniority as\nengrafted under \nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n and the facet of relaxation\ngrafted by way of a proviso to \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution of India\nbeing incorporated by the \nConstitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act,\n1995\n, the \nConstitution (Eight-first Amendment) Act, 2000\n, the \nConstitution\n(Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000\n and the \nConstitution (Eighty-fifth\nAmendment) Act, 2001\n at various stages having withstood judicial scrutiny\nby the dictum in \nM. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n[1], the issue of\nimplementation of the same through existing statutory enactment by the\nState Legislature and the subsequent rules framed by the authorities of the\nState or concerned corporation of the State of Uttar Pradesh, has, as the\nlearned counsel appearing for both sides in their astute and penetrating\nmanner have pyramided the concept in its essentiality, either appeared too\nsimple that simplification may envy or so complex that it could manifest as\nthe reservoir of imbalances or a sanctuary of uncertainties. Thus, the net\nresult commands for an endeavour for a detailed survey of the past and\ncasts an obligation to dwell upon the controversy within the requisite\nparameters that are absolutely essential for adjudication of the lis\nemanated in praesenti.\n\nTHE FACTUAL EXPOSE’\n\n3. Extraordinary and, in a way, perplexing though it may seem, yet as\nthe factual scenario pronouncedly reveals, the assail in some of the\nappeals of this batch of appeals is to the judgment and order passed by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ\nPetition No. 63217 of 2010 (\nMukund Kumar Srivastava vs. State of U.P. and\nAnother\n) upholding the validity of the provisions contained in Rule 8-A of\nthe U.P. Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991 (for brevity ‘the 1991\nRules’) that were inserted by the U.P. Government Servants Seniority (3rd\nAmendment) Rules, 2007 by the employees-appellants and in some of the\nappeals, the challenge by the State Government and the U.P. Power\nCorporation Ltd. (for short ‘the Corporation’) is to the judgment and order\npassed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad,\nLucknow Bench, Lucknow, in Writ Petition No. 1389 (S/B) of 2007 (\nPrem Kumar\nSingh and others v. State of U.P. and others\n) and other connected writ\npetitions holding, inter alia, that the decision rendered by the Division\nBench in the case of \nMukund Kumar Srivastava\n (supra) at Allahabad is per\nincuriam and not a binding precedent and further Section 3(7) of the Uttar\nPradesh Public Servants (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes\nand other Backward Classes) Act, 1994 (for short ‘the 1994 Act’) and Rule\n8A of the 1991 Rules, as brought into force in 2007, are invalid, ultra\nvires and unconstitutional and, as a necessary corollary, the consequential\norders relating to seniority passed by the State Government deserved to be\nquashed and, accordingly, quashed the same and further clarified that in\ncase the State Government decides to provide reservation in promotion to\nany class or classes of posts in the services under the State, it is free\nto do so after undertaking the exercise as required under the\nconstitutional provisions keeping in mind the law \nlaid down by\n this Court\nin \nM. Nagraj\n (supra). It has been directed that till it is done, no\nreservation in promotion on any post or classes of posts under the services\nof the State including the Corporation shall be made hence forth. However,\nthe Division Bench observed that the promotions already made as per the\nprovisions/Rules where the benefit of Rule 8A has not been given while\nmaking the promotion shall not be disturbed.\n\n4. The cleavage has invited immense criticism by the learned senior\ncounsel appearing for both sides on principles of judicial discipline,\ndecorum, propriety and tradition. Initially the debate centred around the\nconcept of precedent and the duties of the Benches but gradually it was\nacceded to, absolutely totally being seemly, to decide the controversy on\nmerits instead of a remit and, accordingly, the learned counsel for the\nparties addressed the Court at length. As advised, we shall dwell upon the\nmerits of the controversy but we shall not abdicate our responsibility to\ndelve into the first issue, i.e., judicial discipline as we are inclined to\nthink that it is the duty, nay, obligation in the present case to do so\nbecause despite repeated concern shown by this Court, the malady subsists,\nmaking an abode of almost permanency. Ergo, we proceed to state the facts\non the first issue and our opinion thereon and, thereafter, shall deal with\nthe assail and attack on both the judgments on merits.\n\n5. One Rajesh Kumar and two others, the private respondents in the\nappeal preferred by the Corporation, filed Writ Petition No. 146 (S/B) of\n2009 at the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad\nseeking declaration to the effect that Rule 8A of the 1991 Rules and the\nresolution passed by the Corporation are ultra vires. That apart, the\nassail was to the constitutional validity of Section 3(7) of the 1994 Act\non the foundation that the State Government in gross violation of the\nconstitutional provisions enshrined under \nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n and\nthe interpretation placed thereon by the Constitution Bench in \nM. Nagraj\n\n(supra) has framed the Rules and the Corporation has adopted the same by\namending its Rules and introduced the concept of reservation in promotion\nwith accelerated seniority.\n\n6. It was contended before the Lucknow Bench that neither the State\nGovernment nor the Corporation had carried out the exercise as per the\ndecision in \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) and in the absence of the same, the\nprovisions of the Act and the Rules caused discomfort to the constitutional\nprovisions. The stand and stance put forth by the writ petitioners was\ncombated by the Corporation contending, inter alia, that the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes were inadequately represented in the service\nand the chart wise percentage of representation to direct recruitment of\nreserved categories incumbents would clearly reflect the inadequacy. We\nare not referring to the pleadings in detail as that will be adverted to at\na later stage. Suffice to say at present, in view of the assertions made\nby the parties and the records produced the Division Bench framed the\nquestion for determination whether Rule 8-A of the Rules is ultra vires and\nunconstitutional.\n \nDuring the course of hearing of the writ petition, the\nCorporation brought to the notice of the Division Bench at Lucknow the\njudgment dated 21.10.2010 passed by the Division Bench at Allahabad in Writ\nPetition No. 63127 of 2010 (\nMukund Kumar Srivastava v. State of U.P. and\nanother\n). It was urged that the same was a binding precedent and,\ntherefore, the Division Bench was bound to follow the same.\n \nBut, the Bench\nhearing the writ petition declared \nthe said decision\n as not binding and per\nincuriam as it had not correctly interpreted, appreciated and applied the\n\nratio \nlaid down in\n \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) and, on that base, declared Section\n3(7) of the 1994 Act and Rule 8A of the 1991 Rules as unconstitutional and\nissued the directions as have been stated hereinbefore.\n\n7. It is the admitted position at the Bar that certain writ petitions\nwere filed at Lucknow Bench and they were being heard. They were filed on\nearlier point of time and were being dealt with on merits by the concerned\nDivision Bench. At that juncture, the Division Bench at Allahabad\nentertained Writ Petition No. 63127 of 2010. The Bench was of the view\nthat without calling for a counter affidavit from any of the respondents\nthe writ petition could be decided. Be it noted, the petitioner therein\nwas an Executive Engineer in Rural Engineering Service at Sonebhadra\nDivision and had challenged the seniority list of Executive Engineers of\nRural Engineering Service published vide Office Memorandum No. 2950/62-3-\n2010-45-RES/2010 dated 8.9.2010 and further sought declaration of Rule 8A\nof the 2007 Rules as unconstitutional. \nA prayer for issue of a writ of\nmandamus was sought not to proceed with and promote any person on the next\nhigher post on the basis of the impugned seniority list of Executive\nEngineers of Rural Engineering Service. The Bench, as is manifest from the\norder, adverted to the facts and then dwelled upon the validity of the\nRules. It scanned Rules 6, 7, 8 and 8A and referred to the decision of\nthis Court in Indra Sawhney etc. v. Union of India and others[2], Section 3\nof the 1994 Act, \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution and quoted in extenso from\n\nM. Nagraj\n (supra) and came to hold as follows: -\n\n \n“The Constitutional validity of \nAmending Act\n 77th Amendment Act\n 1995 and 85th Amendment Act 2001 whereby clause (4A) has been\n inserted after clause (4) under the \nArticle 16\n of the\n Constitution has already been upheld by the Constitution Bench\n of Hon’ble Apex Court in \nM. Nagraj\n case (supra) holding that\n neither the catch up rule nor the Constitutional seniority is\n implicit in Clause (1) and Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n rather the\n concept of catch up rule and consequential seniority are\n judicially evolved concepts to control the extent of\n reservation. The source of these concepts is in service\n jurisprudence. These concepts cannot be elevated to the status\n of an axiom, like secularism, constitutional sovereignty,\n equality code etc. forming basic structure of the Constitution.\n It cannot be said that by insertion of concept of consequential\n seniority the structure of \nArticle 16\n stands destroyed or\n abrogated. It cannot be said that equality code contained under\n \nArticles 14\n, 15\n, 16\n is violated by deletion of catch-up rule.\n\n \nWe are bound by the aforesaid decision of Hon’ble Apex\n Court in \nM. Nagraj\n case (supra). Therefore, there can be no\n scope for doubt to hold that deletion of catch-up rule and\n conferring the benefits of consequential seniority upon the\n members of SC and ST on account of reservation in promotion in a\n particular service or grade or post has any way obliterated the\n equality code contained under \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16\n of the\n Constitution as concept of catch-up rule of seniority does not\n directly flow from \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(4)\n of the Constitution of\n India. We are of the considered opinion that Rule 8A of 1991\n Rules has merely effectuated the provisions contained under\n \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution of India whereby benefit of\n consequential seniority has been given to the members of\n scheduled castes and scheduled tribes due to reservation/roster\n in promotion by obliterating the concept of catch-up Rule of\n seniority. Rule 8A of 1991 Rules specifically stipulates that\n if any member of scheduled castes or scheduled tribes is\n promoted on any post or grade in service earlier to other\n categories of persons, the member of SC/ST shall be treated to\n be senior to such other categories of persons who are promoted\n subsequently after promotion of members of SC/ST, despite\n anything contained in Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules. In our\n view Rule 8A of 1991 Rules has constitutional sanctity of\n \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution and cannot be found faulty\n merely on account of violation of judicially evolved concept of\n catch-up rule of seniority which has been specifically\n obliterated by \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution. Likewise the\n said rule can also not be held to be unconstitutional or invalid\n on account of obliteration of any other judicially evolved\n principle of seniority or any other contrary rules of seniority\n existing under Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules, as Rule 8A of\n 1991 Rules opens with non-obstante clause with overriding effect\n upon Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules, therefore, we do not find\n any justification to strike down the provisions contained under\n Rule 8-A of 1991 Rules on the said ground and on any of the\n grounds mentioned in the writ petition.”\n\nAfter so stating, the Division Bench proceeded to observe as follows: -\n\n \n“27. In this connection, we make it clear that deletion of the\n said concept of catch-up Rule of seniority and addition of\n consequential seniority due to reservation in promotion on any\n post or grade in service are applicable to the member of\n scheduled castes and scheduled tribes only, whereas inter-se\n seniority of other categories employees shall continue to be\n determined according to their existing seniority rules as\n contemplated by the provisions of Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991\n Rules, subject to aforesaid limitations. Thus the concept of\n catch-up Rule of Seniority stands obliterated only to the extent\n of giving benefit of consequential seniority to the members of\n scheduled castes and scheduled tribes on account of their\n promotion on any post or grade in service due to reservation,\n therefore, the scope of obliteration of concept of catch-up rule\n is limited to that extent. In this view of the matter the\n petitioner is not entitled to get the relief sought for in the\n writ petition questioning the validity of said Rule 8A of 1991\n Rules. Thus we uphold the validity of said Rules and the\n question formulated by us is answered accordingly.”\n\n It is interesting to note that in paragraph 29 of \nthe said judgment\n\nthe Division Bench expressed thus: -\n\n “29. However, since the petitioner did not challenge the\n Constitutional Validity of Law regarding reservation in\n promotion in favour of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes\n existing in State of Uttar Pradesh which is applicable to the\n services and posts in connection of affairs of State of Uttar\n Pradesh inasmuch as other services and posts covered by said\n Reservation Act 1994, in our opinion, the petitioner shall not\n be permitted to raise this question by filing any other writ\n petition again. In given facts and circumstances of the case,\n we are not inclined to issue any mandamus, commanding the\n respondents, not to proceed with impugned seniority list for the\n purpose of promotion on the next higher post without expressing\n any opinion on the merit of said seniority list. We are also\n not inclined to issue any such restraint order, staying any\n promotion on the next higher post, if the respondents are\n intending to make such promotion on the basis of impugned\n seniority list.”\n\n8. We have been apprised at the Bar that it was brought to the notice of\nthe Division Bench at Allahabad that certain writ petitions, where there\nwas comprehensive challenge, were part-heard and the hearing was in\ncontinuance at Lucknow Bench, but, as is vivid from the first paragraph of\n\nthe said judgment\n, the Bench heard the learned counsel for the petitioner\nand the standing counsel for the State and caveator and proceeded to decide\nthe matter without a counter affidavit.\n\n9. Presently, we shall advert to how the Lucknow Bench dealt with this\ndecision.\n\n10. After stating the basic pleas, the Division Bench at Lucknow\nproceeded to state as follows:-\n\n \n“.......but before we proceed to decide the validity of the\n challenge made and the defence put, we find it expedient to\n respond to the foremost plea of the respondents that the\n aforesaid Rule 8-A of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority\n Rules, 1991, (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Rules, 1991), was\n challenged before a Division Bench (Hon’ble Sheo Kumar Singh\n and Hon’ble Sabhajeet Yadav, JJ) at Allahabad in Writ Petition\n No. 63127 of 2010 in re: \nMukund Kumar Srivastava versus State\n of U.P. and another\n, which writ petition has been dismissed\n upholding the validity of the aforesaid Rule 8-A, therefore,\n this Court is bound by \nthe said judgment\n passed by a Bench of\n equal strength and hence all these petitions need be dismissed\n only on this ground.”\n\n Before the said Bench, it was contended that the judgment rendered by\nthe Division Bench at Allahabad is per incuriam and is not a binding\nprecedent.\n\n11. Various grounds were urged to substantiate the aforesaid stand. The\nDivision Bench, after analysing the reasoning of the Allahabad Bench in\ngreat detail and after referring to certain decisions and the principles\npertaining to binding precedent, opined as follows:-\n\n “The Division Bench at Allahabad, did not enter into the\n question of exercise of power by the State Government under the\n enabling provisions of the Constitution and upheld the validity\n of Rule 8-A only for the reason, that there did exist such a\n power to enact the Rule, whereas the Apex Court, very clearly\n has pronounced, that if the given exercise has not been\n undertaken by the State Government while making a rule for\n reservation with or without accelerated seniority, such a rule\n may not stand the test of judicial review.\n\n In fact, M. Nagraj obliges the High Court that when a\n challenge is made to the reservation in promotion, it shall\n scrutinize the same on the given parameters and it also casts a\n corresponding duty upon the State Government to satisfy the\n Court about the exercise undertaken in making such a provision\n for reservation. The Division Bench did not advert upon this\n issue, nor the State Government fulfilled its duty as enumerated\n in M. Nagraj.\n\n The effect of the judgment delivered at Allahabad is also\n to be seen in the light of the fact that though the Division\n Bench at Allahabad did not adjudicate on the dispute with regard\n to the seniority for which the petitioner Mukund Kumar\n Srivastava has been relegated to the remedy of State Public\n Services Tribunal, but upheld the validity of Rule 8-A, which\n could not be said to be the main relief, claimed by the\n petitioner.\n\n \nFor the aforesaid reasons and also for the reason, that\n the present writ petitions do challenge the very rule of\n reservation in promotion, which challenge we have upheld for the\n reasons hereinafter stated, because of which the rule of\n accelerated seniority itself falls to the ground, we, with deep\n respect, are unable to subscribe to the view taken by the\n Division Bench at Allahabad and hold that \nthe said judgment\n\n cannot be considered as binding precedent having been rendered\n per incuriam.”\n\n12. We have reproduced the paragraphs from both the decisions in extenso\nto highlight that the Allahabad Bench was apprised about the number of\nmatters at Lucknow filed earlier in point of time which were being part\nheard and the hearing was in continuum. It would have been advisable to\nwait for the verdict at Lucknow Bench or to bring it to the notice of the\nlearned Chief Justice about the similar matters being instituted at both\nthe places. The judicial courtesy and decorum warranted such discipline\nwhich was expected from the learned Judges but for the unfathomable\nreasons, neither of the courses were taken recourse to. Similarly, the\nDivision Bench at Lucknow erroneously treated the verdict of Allahabad\nBench not to be a binding precedent on the foundation that the principles\n\nlaid down by\n the Constitution Bench in \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) are not being\nappositely appreciated and correctly applied by the Bench when there was\nreference to \nthe said decision\n and number of passages were quoted and\nappreciated albeit incorrectly, the same could not have been a ground to\ntreat the decision as per incuriam or not a binding precedent. Judicial\ndiscipline commands in such a situation when there is disagreement to refer\nthe matter to a larger Bench. Instead of doing that, the Division Bench at\nLucknow took the burden on themselves to decide the case.\n\n13. \nIn this context, we may profitably quote a passage from \nLala Shri\nBhagwan and another v. Ram Chand and another\n[3]:-\n\n “18. .. It is hardly necessary to emphasise that considerations\n of judicial propriety and decorum require that if a learned\n single Judge hearing a matter is inclined to take the view that\n the earlier decisions of the High Court, whether of a Division\n Bench or of a single Judge, need to be reconsidered, he should\n not embark upon that enquiry sitting as a single Judge, but\n should refer the matter to a Division Bench or, in a proper\n case, place the relevant papers before the Chief Justice to\n enable him to constitute a larger Bench to examine the question.\n That is the proper and traditional way to deal with such\n matters and it is founded on healthy principles of judicial\n decorum and propriety. It is to be regretted that the learned\n single Judge departed from this traditional way in the present\n case and chose to examine the question himself.”\n\n14. \nIn \nSundarjas Kanyalal Bhathija and others v. The Collector, Thane,\nMaharashtra and others\n[4] while dealing with judicial discipline, the two-\nJudge Bench has expressed thus:-\n\n \n“One must remember that pursuit of the law, however, glamorous\n it is, has its own limitation on the Bench. In a multi-Judge\n Court, the Judges are bound by precedents and procedure. They\n could use their discretion only when there is no declared\n principle to be found, no rule and no authority. The judicial\n decorum and legal propriety demand that where a learned single\n Judge or a Division Bench does not agree with the decision of a\n Bench of co-ordinate jurisdiction, the matter shall be referred\n to a larger Bench. It is a subversion of judicial process not\n to follow this procedure.”\n\n The aforesaid pronouncements clearly lay down what is expected from\nthe Judges when they are confronted with the decision of a Co-ordinate\nBench on the same issue. Any contrary attitude, however adventurous and\nglorious may be, would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency. It has\nprecisely so happened in the case at hand. There are two decisions by two\nDivision Benches from the same High Court. We express our concern about\nthe deviation from the judicial decorum and discipline by both the Benches\nand expect that in future, they shall be appositely guided by the\nconceptual eventuality of such discipline as \nlaid down by\n this Court from\ntime to time. We have said so with the fond hope that judicial enthusiasm\nshould not obliterate the profound responsibility that is expected from the\nJudges.\n\n15. Having dealt with the judicial dictum and the propriety part, we\nshall now proceed to deal with the case on merit as a common consensus was\narrived at the Bar for the said purpose. The affected employees have filed\ncertain civil appeals against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court and\nthe employees who are affected by the verdict of the Lucknow Bench have\nalso preferred appeals. That apart, the State of U.P. and the Corporation\nhave also challenged the decision as the rules framed have been declared\nultra vires. The main controversy relates to the validity of Section 3(7)\nof the 1994 Act and Rule 8A of the 1991 Rules. Thus, we really have to\nadvert to the constitutional validity of the said provisions.\n\n16. Prior to the advertence in aforesaid regard, it is necessary to have\na certain survey pertaining to reservation in promotional matters. The\nquestion of reservation and the associated promotion with it has been a\nmatter of debate in various decisions of this Court. After independence,\nthere were various areas in respect of which decisions were pronounced.\nEventually, in the case of \nIndra Sawhney and another v. Union of India and\nothers\n (supra) the nine-Judge Bench, while dealing with the question\nwhether clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution provides for\nreservation only in the matter of initial appointment, direct recruitment\nor does it contemplate and provide for reservations being made in the\nmatter of promotion as well, recorded the submissions of the petitioners in\nparagraph 819 which reads as follows: -\n\n “The petitioners’ submission is that the reservation of\n appointments or posts contemplated by clause (4) is only at the\n stage of entry into State service, i.e., direct recruitment. It\n is submitted that providing for reservation thereafter in the\n matter of promotion amounts to a double reservation and if such\n a provision is made at each successive stage of promotion it\n would be a case of reservation being provided that many times.\n It is also submitted that by providing reservation in the matter\n of promotion, the member of a reserved category is enabled to\n leap-frog over his compatriots, which is bound to generate acute\n heartburning and may well lead to inefficiency in\n administration. The members of the open competition category\n would come to think that whatever be their record and\n performance, the members of reserved categories would steal a\n march over them, irrespective of their performance and\n competence. Examples are give how two persons (A) and (B), one\n belonging to O.C. category and the other belonging to reserved\n category, having been appointed at the same time, the member of\n the reserved category gets promoted earlier and how even in the\n promoted category he jumps over the members of the O.C. category\n already there and gains a further promotion and so on. This\n would generate, it is submitted, a feeling of disheartening\n which kills the spirit of competition and develops a sense of\n disinterestedness among the members of O.C. category. It is\n pointed out that once persons coming from different sources join\n a category or class, they must be treated alike thereafter in\n all matters including promotions and that no distinction is\n permissible on the basis of their “birth-mark”. It is also\n pointed out that even the Constituent Assembly debates on draft\n \nArticle 10(3)\n do not indicate in any manner that it was\n supported to extend to promotions as well. It is further\n submitted that if \nArticle 16(4)\n is construed as warranting\n reservation even in the matter of promotion it would be contrary\n to the mandate of \nArticle 335\n viz., maintenance of efficiency in\n administration. \nIt is submitted that such a provision would\n amount to putting a premium upon inefficiency. The members of\n the reserved category would not work hard since they do not have\n to compete with all their colleagues but only within the\n reserved category and further because they are assured of\n promotion whether they work hard and efficiently or not. Such a\n course would also militate against the goal of excellence\n referred to in clause (j) of \nArticle 51-A (Fundamental Duties)\n.”\n\n Thereafter, the Bench referred to the decisions in General Manager,\nS. Rly. v. \nRangachari[5], State of Punjab v. Hira Lal\n[6], \nAkhil Bharatiya\nSoshit Karamchari Sangh v. Union of India\n[7] and \nComptroller and Auditor\nGeneral v. K.S. Jagannathan\n[8] and did not agree with the view stated in\n\nRangachari\n (supra), despite noting the fact that Rangachari has been a law\nfor more than thirty years and that attempt to reopen the issue was\nrepelled in \nAkhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh\n (supra). Thereafter,\ntheir Lordships addressed to the concept of promotion and, eventuall,y\nafter adverting to certain legal principles, stated thus: -\n\n \n“831. We must also make it clear that it would not be\n impermissible for the State to extend concessions and\n relaxations to members of reserved categories in the matter of\n promotion without compromising the efficiency of the\n administration. The relaxation concerned in \nState of Kerala v.\n N.M. Thomas\n [(1976) 2 SCC 310] and the concessions namely\n carrying forward of vacancies and provisions for in-service\n coaching/training in Karamchari Sangh are instances of such\n concessions and relaxations. However, it would not be\n permissible to prescribe lower qualifying marks or a lesser\n level of evaluation for the members of reserved categories since\n that would compromise the efficiency of administration. We\n reiterate that while it may be permissible to prescribe a\n reasonably lesser qualifying marks or evaluation for the OBCs,\n SCs and STs – consistent with the efficiency of administration\n and the nature of duties attaching to the office concerned – in\n the matter of direct recruitment, such a course would not be\n permissible in the matter of promotions for the reasons recorded\n hereinabove.”\n\n In paragraph 859, while summarising the said aspect, it has been\nruled thus: -\n\n “859. We may summarise our answers to the various questions\n dealt with and answered hereinabove:\n\n .......... .............. ...........\n\n (7) \nArticle 16(4)\n does not permit provision for reservations\n in the matter of promotion. This rule shall, however, have\n only prospective operation and shall not affect the\n promotions already made, whether made on regular basis or\n on any other basis. We direct that our decision on this\n question shall operate only prospectively and shall not\n affect promotions already made, whether on temporary,\n officiating or regular/permanent basis. It is further\n directed that wherever reservations are already provided in\n the matter of promotion – be it Central Services or State\n Services, or for that matter services under any\n Corporation, authority or body falling under the definition\n of ‘State’ in \nArticle 12\n – such reservations may continue\n in operation for a period of five years from this day.\n\n Within this period, it would be open to the appropriate\n authorities to revise, modify or re-issue the relevant\n rules to ensure the achievement of the objective of \nArticle\n 16(4).\n If any authority thinks that for ensuring adequate\n representation of ‘backward class of citizens’ in any\n service, class or category, it is necessary to provide for\n direct recruitment therein, it shall be open to it to do so\n (Ahmadi, J expresses no opinion on this question upholding\n the preliminary objection of Union of India). It would not\n be impermissible for the State to extend concessions and\n relaxations to members of reserved categories in the matter\n of promotion without compromising the efficiency of the\n administration.”\n\n17. After \nthe said decision\n, another decision, namely, \nUnion of India and\nothers v. Virpal Singh Chauhan and others\n[9] came to the field. In the\nsaid case, the two-Judge Bench was concerned with the nature of rule and\nreservation in promotions obtaining in the railway service and the rule\nconcerning the determination of seniority between general candidates and\ncandidates belonging to reserved classes in the promotional category.\n \nThe\nBench referred to the decision in \nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n[10],\nvarious paragraphs of the Indian Railways Establishment Manual and\nparagraphs 692 and 693 of the \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) and opined that the\nroster would only ensure the prescribed percentage of reservation but would\nnot affect the seniority. It has been stated that while the reserved\ncandidates are entitled to accelerated promotion, they would not be\nentitled to consequential seniority.\n\n18. Thereafter, in \nAjit Singh Januja and others v. State of Punjab and\nothers\n[11], the three-Judge Bench posed the question in the following\nterms: -\n\n \n“The controversy which has been raised in the present appeals\n is: whether, after the members of Scheduled Castes/Tribes or\n Backward Classes for whom specific percentage of posts have been\n reserved and roster has been provided having been promoted\n against those posts on the basis of “accelerated promotion”\n because of reservation of posts and applicability of the roster\n system, can claim promotion against general category posts in\n still higher grade on the basis of their seniority which itself\n is the result of accelerated promotion on the basis of\n reservation and roster?”\n\n The Bench referred to the decisions in \nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n (supra),\n\nR.K. Sabharwal\n (supra) and \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) and ultimately concurred\nwith the view expressed in Virpal Singh Chauhan by stating as follows: -\n\n \n“16. We respectfully concur with the view in \nUnion of\n India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n, that seniority between the\n reserved category candidates and general candidates in the\n promoted category shall continue to be governed by their panel\n position i.e. with reference to their inter se seniority in the\n lower grade. The rule of reservation gives accelerated\n promotion, but it does not give the accelerated “consequential\n seniority”. If a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\n promoted earlier because of the rule of reservation/roster and\n his senior belonging to the general category is promoted later\n to that higher grade the general category candidate shall regain\n his seniority over such earlier promoted Scheduled Caste/Tribe\n candidate. As already pointed out above that when a Scheduled\n Caste/ Tribe candidate is promoted earlier by applying the rule\n of reservation/roster against a post reserved for such Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe candidate, in this process he does not supersede his\n seniors belonging to the general category. In this process\n there was no occasion to examine the merit of such Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe candidate vis-a-vis his seniors belonging to the\n general category. As such it will be only rational, just and\n proper to hold that when the general category candidate is\n promoted later from the lower grade to the higher grade, he will\n be considered senior to a candidate belonging to the Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe who had been given accelerated promotion against the\n post reserved for him. Whenever a question arises for filling\n up a post reserved for Scheduled Caste/Tribe candidate in a\n still higher grade then such candidate belonging to Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe shall be promoted first but when the consideration\n is in respect of promotion against the general category post in\n a still higher grade then the general category candidate who has\n been promoted later shall be considered senior and his case\n shall be considered first for promotion applying either\n principle of seniority-cum-merit or merit-cum-seniority. If\n this rule and procedure is not applied then result will be that\n majority of the posts in the higher grade shall be held at one\n stage by persons who have not only entered service on the basis\n of reservation and roster but have excluded the general category\n candidates from being promoted to the posts reserved for general\n category candidates merely on the ground of their initial\n accelerated promotions. This will not be consistent with the\n requirement or the spirit of \nArticle 16(4)\n or \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution.”\n\n19. \nIn \nJagdish Lal and others v. State of Haryana and others\n[12], a three-\nJudge Bench opined that seniority granted to the Scheduled Caste and\nScheduled Tribe candidates over a general candidate due to his accelerated\npromotion does not in all events get wiped out on promotion of general\ncandidate.\n \nThe Bench explained the decisions in \nVir Pal Singh Chauhan\n\n(supra) and \nAjit Singh Januja\n (supra).\n\n20. \nIn Ajit Singh and others (II) v. State of Punjab and others[13], the\nConstitution Bench was concerned with the issue whether the decisions in\n\nVir Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra) and \nAjit Singh Januja\n (supra) which were\nearlier decided to the effect that the seniority of general candidates is\nto be confirmed or whether the later deviation made in \nJagdish Lal\n (supra)\nagainst the general candidates is to be accepted. The Constitution Bench\nreferred to \nArticles 16(1)\n, 16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n of the Constitution and\ndiscussed at length the concept of promotion based on equal opportunity and\nseniority and treated them to be facets of Fundamental Right under \nArticle\n16(1)\n of the Constitution. The Bench posed a question whether \nArticles\n16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n guarantee any Fundamental Right to reservation. Regard\nbeing had to the nature of language employed in both the Articles, they\nwere to be treated in the nature of enabling provisions. The Constitution\nBench opined that \nArticle 16(1)\n deals with the Fundamental Right and\n\nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n are the enabling provisions.\n \nAfter so stating,\nthey proceeded to analyse the ratio in \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra), \nAkhil\nBharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh\n (supra) and certain other authorities in\nthe field and, eventually, opined that it is axiomatic in service\njurisprudence that any promotions made wrongly in excess of any quota are\nto be treated as ad hoc. This applies to reservation quota as much as it\napplies to direct recruits and promotee cases. If a court decides that in\norder only to remove hardship such roster-point promotees are not to face\nreversions, - then it would, in our opinion be, necessary to hold –\nconsistent with our interpretation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n – that such\npromotees cannot plead for grant of any additional benefit of seniority\nflowing from a wrong application of the roster. While courts can relieve\nimmediate hardship arising out of a past illegality, courts cannot grant\nadditional benefits like seniority which have no element of immediate\nhardship. Ultimately while dealing with the promotions already given\nbefore 10.2.1995 the Bench directed as follows: -\n\n “Thus, while promotions in excess of roster made before 10-2-\n 1995 are protected, such promotees cannot claim seniority.\n Seniority in the promotional cadre of such excess roster-point\n promotees shall have to be reviewed after 10-2-1995 and will\n count only from the date on which they would have otherwise got\n normal promotion in any future vacancy arising in a post\n previously occupied by a reserved candidate. That disposes of\n the “prospectivity” point in relation to Sabharwal.”\n\n21. At this juncture, it is condign to note that \nArticle 16(4A)\n and\n\nArticle 16 (4B)\n were inserted in the Constitution to confer promotion with\nconsequential seniority and introduced the concept of carrying forward\nvacancies treating the vacancies meant for reserved category candidates as\na separate class of vacancies. The said Articles as amended from time to\ntime read as follows: -\n\n “16(4A) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State\n from making any provision for reservation in matters of\n promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes\n of posts in the services under the State in favour of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion\n of the State, are not adequately represented in the services\n under the State.\n\n 16(4B) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from\n considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved\n for being filled up in that year in accordance with any\n provision for reservation made under clause (4) or (4A) as a\n separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding\n year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be\n considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they\n are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per\n cent reservation on total number of that year.”\n\n22. The validity of the said Articles were challenged under \nArticle 32\n of\nthe Constitution of India before this Court and the Constitution Bench in\n\nM. Nagraj\n (supra) upheld the validity of the said Articles with certain\nqualifiers/riders by taking recourse to the process of interpretation. As\nthe controversy rests mainly on \nthe said decision\n, we will advert to it in\ndetail at a later stage.\n\n23. Presently, we shall dwell upon the provisions that were under\nchallenge before the High Court. The Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh\nbrought in a legislation, namely, the Uttar Pradesh Public Services\n(Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward\nClasses) Act, 1994 \n(UP Act\n No. 4 of 1994) to provide for reservation in\npublic services and posts in favour of the persons belonging to Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes of citizens and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 3(7), which is\nrelevant for our present purpose, reads as follows: -\n\n “Reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\n Tribes and other Backward Classes. –\n\n ...... .......... ..........\n\n (7) If, on the date of commencement of this Act, reservation\n was in force under Government Orders for appointment to posts to\n be filled by promotion, such Government Orders shall continue to\n be applicable till they are modified or revoked.”\n\n Sub-section (7) of Section 3 was the subject-matter of assail before\nthe High Court.\n\n24. As the factual matrix would reveal, the State of Uttar Pradesh\nbrought into existence the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants Seniority\n(First Amendment) Rules, 2002 on the 18th of October, 2002 in exercise of\nthe power conferred under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution whereby after\nRule 8, new Rule 8-A was inserted. The said Rule reads as follows: -\n\n “8-A. Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule s6,7 or 8 of\n these rules, a person belonging to the Scheduled Castes or\n Scheduled Tribes shall on his promotion by virtue of rule of\n reservation/ roster, be entitled to consequential seniority\n also.”\n\n25. It is worth noting that on May 13, 2005, by the Uttar Pradesh\nGovernment Servants Seniority (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005, Rule 8-A was\nomitted. However, it was provided in the said Rules that the promotions\nmade in accordance with the revised seniority as determined under Rule 8-A\nprior to the commencement of the 2005 Rules could not be affected.\nThereafter, on September 14, 2007, by the Uttar Pradesh Government Servants\nSeniority (Third Amendment) Rules, 2007, Rule 8-A was inserted in the same\nlanguage which we have already reproduced hereinabove. It has been\nmentioned in the said Rule that it shall be deemed to have come into force\non June 17, 1995. It is germane to note here that the U.P. Power\nCorporation Limited adopted the said Rules as there is no dispute about the\nfact that after the Rules came into existence and have been given effect to\nat some places and that is why the challenge to the constitutional validity\nof the Act and the Rules was made before the High Court. We have already\nindicated how both the Benches have dealt with the said situation.\n\n26. At this stage, we may usefully state that though number of appeals\nhave been preferred, yet some relate to the assail of the interim orders\nand some to the final orders. We may only state for the sake of clarity\nand convenience that if Section 3(7) and Rule 8-A as amended in 2007 are\nheld to be constitutionally valid, all the appeals are bound to be\ndismissed and if they are held to be ultra vires, then the judgment passed\nby the Lucknow Bench shall stand affirmed subject to any\nclarification/modification in our order.\n\n27. As has been noticed hereinbefore, the Allahabad Bench had understood\nthe dictum in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) in a different manner and the Division\nBench at Lucknow in a different manner. The learned counsel appearing for\nvarious parties have advanced their contentions in support of the\nprovisions in the enactment and the Rules.\n \nWe would like to condense their\nbasic arguments and endeavour to pigeon-hole keeping in view the facts\nwhich are requisite to be referred to at the time of analysis of \nthe said\ndecision\n in the backdrop of the verdict in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra).\n\n28. Mr. Andhyarujina and Mr. Raju Ram Chandran, learned senior counsel\ncriticising the decision passed by the Lucknow Bench, have submitted that\nthe High Court has fallen into grave error by not scrutinising the\nmaterials produced before it, as a consequence of which a sanctuary of\nerrors have crept into it. If the counter affidavit and other documents\nare studiedly scanned, it would be luminescent that opinion has been formed\nas regards inadequate representation in promotional posts and, therefore,\nit had become an imperative to provide for reservation. The opinion formed\nby the Government need not be with mathematical precision to broad spectrum\nand such exercise has already been done by the State of U.P., since\nreservation in promotional matters was already in vogue by virtue of\nadministrative circulars and statutory provisions for few decades. It\nis urged that the concept of inadequate representation and backwardness\nhave been accepted by the amending power of the Constitution and,\ntherefore, the High Court has totally flawed by laying unwarranted emphasis\non the said concepts. The High Court could not have sat in appeal on the\nrule of reservation solely on the factual bedrock. The chart brought on\nrecord would reflect department wise how the persons from backward classes\nhave not been extended the benefit of promotion and the same forms the\nfoundation for making the enactment and framing the rule and hence, no\nfault could have been found with the same. Once an incumbent belongs to\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes category, it is conclusive that he\nsuffers from backwardness and no further enquiry is necessary. It has been\nclearly held in the case of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) that the test or\nrequirement of social and educational backwardness cannot be applied to\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes who indubitably fall within the\nexpression ‘Backward Classes of Citizen’. It is beyond any shadow of\ndoubt that Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes are a separate class by\nthemselves and the creamy layer principle is not applicable to them.\n \nIt\nhas been so held in \nAvinash Singh Bagri and Ors. v. Registrar IIT Delhi and\nAnother\n[14]. \nArticle 16 (4A)\n uses the phrase ‘in the opinion of’ and the\nsaid word carries a different meaning to convey that it is subjective in\nnature rather than objective. The Report of the “Social Justice\nCommittee” dated 28.06.2001 clearly ascertains the need for implementation\nof reservation in promotional matters in public service in U. P. and the\nsaid Report deserves acceptance. The State Government was possessed of\nsufficient materials to implement the promotional provisions which are\nenabling in nature and the same is justified by the “Social Justice\nCommittee Report” which has examined the current status of implementation\nof Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes in other\npublic services with respect to their quota, their participation and\nprogress in various services, the substantial backlog in promotional posts\nin category A, B and C posts and the inadequacy of representation in\npromotional posts and various departments and State owned corporations.\nThe High Court has completely erred specially when there was sufficient\ndata available with the State Government. Regard being had to the factum\nthat the said promotions were being given for few decades, a fresh exercise\nregarding adequacy was not necessary. The concept of efficiency as\nstipulated under \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution is in no way affected if\nthe reservation does not exceed 50%. The consequential seniority being\nvested by the Constitution, it follows as natural corollary and hence, no\nfurther exercise was required to be undertaken. The learned counsel for\nthe State has drawn the attention of this Court with respect to the\npercentage of representation to justify that requisite data was available\nand no further exercise was needed and, therefore, the decision of the High\nCourt is fundamentally fallacious.\n\n29. Mr. P. S Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing in some appeals\nfor the corporation, has submitted that the requirement of having\nquantifiable data is not a new concept propounded in the case of \nM. Nagraj\n\n(supra) but is a reiteration of the earlier view enunciated in \nIndra\nSawhney\n case (supra) and, therefore, the provision could not have been\ndeclared as ultra vires. The emphasis on backwardness is absolutely\nmisconceived, for Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes are duly notified as\nsuch in the Presidential list by virtue of \nArticles 341\n and \n342\n of the\nConstitution. Their exclusion from the list can alone be done by the\namendment of the Presidential Order and hence, any kind of collection of\ndata as regards the backwardness is an exercise in futility.\n \nThe concept\nof creamy layer principle cannot be applied to Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled\nTribes as has been held in the case of \nAshok Kumar Thakur v. Union of\nIndia\n[15].\n \nLearned senior counsel has placed reliance on the decision\nin \nE. V. Chinniah v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n[16] to highlight that there\nmay be only one list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and this list\nconstitutes one group for the purpose of reservation and the same cannot be\ninterfered with, disturbed, re-grouped or re-classified by the State. In\nessence, the submission is that there may not be exclusion by engrafting\nthe principle of backwardness for the purpose of reservation in promotion.\n\nCommenting on the adequacy of representation, it is urged by Mr. Patwalia\nthat the data was immediately collected after the 1994 Act and thereafter,\nno fresh data was necessary to be collected after the decision rendered by\nthe Constitution Bench in \nM. Nagraj\n (supra).\n It is further submitted by\nthe learned counsel that even if quantifiable data is not collected, the\nState can be asked to do so in view of the order passed by this Court in S.\nB Joshi v. State of Karnatka and Others in W.P. 259 of 1994 decided on\n13.07.2010. The efficiency of service as encapsuled in \nArticle 335\n of the\nConstitution has been duly respected by providing a uniform minimum\nstandard of the matters of promotion as far as the Corporation is concerned\nand, therefore, no fault can be found in that regard.\n\n30. Mr. P. P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for some of the\nprivate respondents assailing the decision of the Lucknow Bench, has urged\nthat when there was no challenge to the orders issued prior the amendment\nfor reservation in promotion, no quantifiable data is necessary. Section\n3 (7) of the 1994 Act does not make any change except recognising the\nearlier orders which lay down that they shall continue to be applicable\ntill it is modified or revoked and, therefore, it has only been conferred\nstatutory recognition. The High Court has misunderstood the decision in\n\nM. Nagraj\n (supra) while stating that the collection of quantifiable data\nwas not undertaken though \nthe said decision\n clearly lays down that a\ncollection of quantifiable data showing backwardness for the class would be\nrequired while demonstrating the same in Court to the extent of promotion\nwhen it is under challenge. In the case at hand, the issue is not the\nextent of reservation or excessive reservation but reservation in\npromotion.\n \nThat apart, the principles \nlaid down in\n \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) do\nnot get attracted if reservation in promotion is sought to be made for the\nfirst time but not for continuing the reservation on the basis of\nassessment made by the Parliament in exercise of its constituent powers.\n\nThe Constitutional Amendment removed the base of the decision in \nIndra\nSawhney\n (supra) that reservation in promotion is not permissible and the\nGovernment in its wisdom has carried out the assessment earlier and decided\nto continue the policy and, therefore, to lay down the principle that in\nview of the decision in \nM Nagraj\n (supra), a fresh exercise is necessary\nwould tantamount to putting the concept in the realm of inherent fallacy.\n\nThe decision in \nSuraj Bhan Meena and Another v. State of Rajasthan &\nOrs.\n[17] is not a binding precedent inasmuch as it takes note of the\ncontention (at paragraph 24 at page no. 474-475 of the Report) but does\nnot deal with it. The 85th Amendment which provides for consequential\nseniority wipes out the ‘catch up’ rule ‘from its inception and the\ngeneral principle of seniority from the date of promotion operates without\nany break and for the same reason the said amendment had been given\nretrospective effect’. The intention of the Parliament at the time of\nexercise of its constitutional power clearly states that the representation\nof Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes in the services in the States had not\nreached the required level and it is necessary to continue the existing\nposition of providing reservation in promotion in the case of Scheduled\nCastes/ Scheduled Tribes. The learned senior counsel has laid immense\nemphasis on the intention of the Parliament and the Legislature to continue\nthe policy and, pyramiding the said submission, he has contended that no\nfresh exercise is required. It is propounded by Mr. Rao that \nArticle 16\n\nbasically relates to classes and not backward individuals and therefore, no\nstress should be given on the backwardness. Alternatively, the learned\nsenior counsel has submitted that the matter should be referred to a larger\nBench, regard being had to the important issue involved in the case.\n\n31. Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel who represents some of\nthe petitioners aggrieved by the Lucknow Bench decision, has urged that\nbackwardness is presumed in view of the nine-Judge Bench decision in \nIndra\nSawhney\n (supra) and the same has to be regarded beyond any cavil.\n \nThe\ndictum in \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) cannot be understood to mandate collection\nof quantifiable data for judging the backwardness of the Scheduled Castes/\nScheduled Tribes while making reservation in promotion. But,\nunfortunately, the High Court has understood the Judgment in the aforesaid\nmanner. There is no material produced on record to establish that\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes candidates having been conferred the\nbenefit of promotion under reservation have ceased to be backward.\n\nThough the decision in \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) held that the promotion in\nreservation is impermissible, yet it continued the reservation in promotion\nfor a period of five years and, therefore, the Constitution Amendment came\ninto force in this backdrop Section 3 (7) of the 1994 Act could not have\nbeen treated to be invalid. But the stand that the refixation of seniority\nafter coming into existence of Rule 8-A of the Rules or the rule by the\ncorporation is basically fallacious, for persons who were promoted earlier\nto the higher post are entitled to seniority from the date of promotion.\n\nThe learned senior counsel has contended that after coming into force of\nthe amendment of the Constitution by inserting \nArticle 16 (4A)\n, the\ndecisions in Rangachary (supra) and \nAkhil Bhartiya Karmachari Sangh\n (supra)\nhave been restored and the concept of ‘catch up’ rule as propounded in Ajit\nSingh II (supra) has also been nullified.\n \nArticle 16 (4A)\n only makes it\nexplicit what is implicit under service jurisprudence in matters of\npromotion and the said benefit was always enjoyed by the Scheduled Castes/\nScheduled Tribes people and \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) does not intend to affect the\nsaid aspect.\n \nThe learned counsel has referred to paragraph 798 of \nIndra\nSawhney\n (supra) to highlight the scope of judicial scrutiny in matters\nwhich are within the subjective satisfaction of the executive and are to be\ntested as per the law \nlaid down in\n \nBarium Chemicals v. Company Law Board\n\n[18]. In essence, the submission is that in adequacy of representation is\nin the domain of subjective satisfaction of the State Government and is to\nbe regarded as a policy decision of the State.\n \nThe learned senior counsel\nhas distinguished the principle enunciated in \nSuraj Bhan Meena\n (supra). In\nthat case, the court was not dealing with an issue where the reservation\nhad already been made and was in continuance. It is highlighted by Mr\nDwivedi that in the present case the issue is not one where there is no\nmaterial on record to justify the subjective satisfaction, but, on the\ncontrary, there is adequate material to show that the State Government was\njustified in introducing the provision in the Act and the Rule.\n \nAs regards\nthe efficiency in administration has mandate under \nArticle 335\n of the\nConstitution, the submission of Mr. Dwivedi is that the constitutional\namendment has been made keeping in mind the decision in \nIndra Sawhney\n\n(supra) and the amendment of \nArticle 335\n facilitates the reservations in\npromotion. The learned senior counsel would contend that maintenance of\nefficiency basically would convey laying a prescription by maintaining the\nminimum standard and in the case of the Corporation it has been so done.\n\nIt has been propounded by him that if backwardness becomes the criterion,\nit would bring out the internal conflict in the dictum of \nM. Nagraj\n (supra)\nand then \nin that case\n it has to be reconciled keeping in view the common\nthread of judgment or the matter should be referred to a larger Bench.\n\nIn any case, \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) does not lay down that the quantifiable data\nof backwardness should be collected with respect to eligible Scheduled\nCastes/ Scheduled Tribes employees seeking promotion.\n \nMr. Dwivedi has\ncommended to the decision in \nUnion of India v. Rakesh Kumar\n [19] to\nhighlight that the proportion of population is the thumb rule as far as the\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes are concerned and that should be the\nlaser beam to adjudge the concept of inadequacy of reservation.\nReservation in promotion involves a balancing act between the national need\nto equalise by affirmative action and to do social justice on one hand and\nto ensure that equality of opportunity as envisaged under \nArticle 14\n is not\nunduly affected by the benefit of promotion which has been conferred by the\nAct and Rules on the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes as a balancing act\nand same has always been upheld by this Court.\n\n32. Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned senior counsel, has submitted that the\nConstitution Bench in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) has clearly laid down certain\nconditions, namely, that there must be compelling reasons for making\nreservation in promotion; that the State is not bound to make reservation\nfor Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes in matters of promotion; that if the\nState thinks that there are compelling reasons to make such reservation in\npromotion, it is obligatory on the part of the State to collect\nquantifiable data showing the backwardness of the class and inadequacy of\nrepresentation of that class in public employment and also by making such\nreservation in promotion, the efficiency in administration is not affected;\nthat the exercise is required to be made before making any reservation for\npromotion; that the State has not applied its mind to the question as to\nwhat could be regarded as an adequate representation for Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes in respect of promotion; that the provision for\nreservation in matters of promotion has to be considered in any class or\nclasses of posts not adequately represented in the services under the State\nbut unfortunately, the exercise in that regard has not at all been taken up\nbut amendments have been incorporated; that the concept of backwardness and\ninadequacy of representation as understood in the case of \nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra) has been absolutely misunderstood and misconstrued by the State\nGovernment as a consequence of which the Rules of the present nature have\ncome into existence; that the overall efficiency as enshrined under \nArticle\n335\n of the Constitution has been given a total go-bye which makes Section\n3(7) of the 1994 Act and Rule 8-A absolutely vulnerable and thereby invites\nthe frown of the enabling provision and the dictum in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra);\nthat Rule 8-A which confers accelerated seniority would leave no room for\nthe efficient general category officers which is not the intention of the\nframers of the Constitution and also as it is understood by various\ndecisions of this Court.\n\n33. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior counsel, supporting the decision of\nthe Division Bench which has declared the Rule as ultra vires, has\nsubmitted that if \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) is properly read, it does clearly\nconvey that social justice is an over reaching principle of the\nConstitution like secularism, democracy, reasonableness, social justice,\netc.\n \nand it emphasises on the equality code and the parameters fixed by the\nConstitution Bench as the basic purpose is to bring in a state of balance\nbut the said balance is destroyed by Section 3(7) of the 1994 Act and Rule\n8-A inasmuch as no exercise has been undertaken during the post \nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra) period.\n \nIn \nM. Nagraj\n (supra), there has been emphasis on\ninterpretation and implementation, width and identity, essence of a right,\nthe equality code and avoidance of reverse discrimination, the nuanced\ndistinction between the adequacy and proportionality, backward class and\nbackwardness, the concept of contest specificity as regards equal justice\nand efficiency, permissive nature of the provisions and conceptual essence\nof guided power, the implementation in concrete terms which would not cause\nviolence to the constitutional mandate; and the effect of accelerated\nseniority and the conditions prevalent for satisfaction of the conditions\nprecedent to invoke the settled principles.\n \nThe learned senior counsel\nfurther submitted that \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) deals with cadre and the posts\nbut the State has applied it across the board without any kind of real\nquantifiable data after pronouncement of the \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra). It is\nhis further submission that after Section 3(7) of the 1994 Act and Rule 8-\nA are allowed to stand, the balancing factor which has so far been\nsustained by this Court especially pertaining to reservation would stand\ncrucified.\n \nIt is urged by him that the chart supplied by the State only\nrefers to the number and, seniority of officers but it does not throw any\nlight on the core issue and further, a mere submission of a chart would not\nmeet the requisite criteria as specified in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra).\n\n34. Mr. Vinod Bobde, learned senior counsel, has submitted that if\naccelerated seniority is confirmed on the roster by the promotees, the\nconsequences would be disastrous inasmuch as the said employee can reach\nthe fourth level by the time he attains the age of 45 years and at the age\nof 49, he would reach the highest level and stay there for nine years\nwhereas a general merit promotee would reach the third level out of the six\nlevels at the age of 56 and by the time he gets eligibility to get into the\nfourth level, he would reach the age of superannuation. It is urged by him\nthat if reservation in promotion is to be made, there has to be collection\nof quantifiable data, regard being had to the backwardness and inadequacy\nof representation in respect of the posts in a particular cadre and while\ndoing so, the other condition as engrafted under \nArticle 335\n of the\nConstitution relating to the efficiency of administration has to be\nmaintained. It is his further submission that in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra),\n\nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n have been treated to be enabling provisions and\nan enabling provision does not create a fundamental right.\n \nIf the State\nthinks to exercise the power, it has to exercise the power strictly in\naccordance with the conditions postulated in the case of \nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra). The State of U.P. has totally misguided itself by harbouring the\nnotion that merely because there has to be representation of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in the services, the State is obliged to\nprovide for reservation in promotion under \nArticle 16(4A).\n \nThe learned\nsenior counsel would vehemently contend that nothing has been brought on\nrecord to show that after pronouncement of \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra), the State\nhad carried out an exercise but has built a castle in Spain by stating that\nthe provision being always there, the data was available.\n \nIt is canvassed\nthat the stand of the State runs counter to the principles \nlaid down in\n \nM.\nNagaraj\n (supra) which makes Section 3(7) and Rule 8-A sensitively\nsusceptible. The consequential seniority was introduced on 18.10.2002 but\nwas obliterated on 13.5.2005 and thereafter, it was revived on 14.9.2007\nwith retrospective effect and the reason is demonstrable from the\norder/circular dated 17.10.2007 which is based on total erroneous\nunderstanding and appreciation of the law \nlaid down by\n this Court. It is\nargued by him that the Act and the Rules were amended solely keeping in\nview the constitutional provision totally ignoring how the said Articles\nwere interpreted by this Court. It is propounded by Mr. Bobde that the\nState has referred to certain data and the “Social Justice Committee\nReport” of 2001 but the same cannot save the edifice of the impugned\nstatutory provision and the Rules as the State could not have anticipated\nwhat this Court was going to say while upholding the constitutional\nvalidity.\n\n35. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, has laid immense emphasis\non paragraphs 121 to 123 of \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) to buttress the stand that\nreservation in promotional matters is subject to the conditions enumerated\nin the said paragraphs.\n \nThe learned senior counsel has drawn inspiration\nfrom an order dated 11.3.2010 passed by a two-Judge Bench in Writ Petition\n(civil) 81 of 2002 wherein the direction was given that the validity may be\nchallenged and on such challenge, the same shall be decided in view of the\nfinal decision in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra).\n \nThe learned senior counsel has\nplaced reliance on \nAshok Kumar Thakur v. Union of India and others\n[20] to\nhighlight that any privilege given to a class should not lead to\ninefficiency. Emphasis has also been laid on the term backwardness having\nnexus with the reservation in promotion and collection of quantifiable data\nin a proper perspective.\n \nHe has drawn inspiration from various paragraphs\nin \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) to show that when an enabling provision is held\nvalid, its exercise can be arbitrary and in the case at hand, the\nprovisions are absolutely arbitrary, unreasonable and irrational.\n\n36. To appreciate the rival submissions raised at the bar and the\ncore controversy, it is absolutely seemly to understand what has been held\nin \nM. Nagraj\n (supra) by the Constitution Bench. While assailing the\nvalidity of \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution which provides for\nreservation in promotion with a consequential seniority, it was contended\nthat equity in the context of \nArticle 16(1)\n connotes accelerated promotion\nso as not to include consequential seniority and as consequential seniority\nhas been attached to the accelerated promotion, the constitutional\namendment is violative of \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticle 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution. Various examples were cited about the disastrous affects\nthat would be ushered in, in view of the amendment. After noting all the\ncontentions, the Constitution Bench addressed to the concept of reservation\nin the context of \nArticle 16(4)\n and further proceeded to deal with equity,\njustice and merit. In that context, the Bench stated thus: -\n\n “This problem has to be examined, therefore, on the facts of\n each case. Therefore, \nArticle 16(4)\n has to be construed in the\n light of \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution. Inadequacy in\n representation and backwardness of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled\n Tribes are circumstances which enable the State Government to\n act under \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution. However, as held by\n this Court the limitations on the discretion of the Government\n in the matter of reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n as well as\n \nArticle 16(4A)\n come in the form of \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution.”\n\n While dealing with reservation and affirmative action, the\nConstitution Bench opined thus: -\n\n “48. It is the equality \"in fact\" which has to be decided\n looking at the ground reality. Balancing comes in where the\n question concerns the extent of reservation. If the extent of\n reservation goes beyond cut-off point then it results in reverse\n discrimination. Anti-discrimination legislation has a tendency\n of pushing towards de facto reservation. Therefore, a numerical\n benchmark is the surest immunity against charges of\n discrimination.\n\n 49. Reservation is necessary for transcending caste and not for\n perpetuating it. Reservation has to be used in a limited sense\n otherwise it will perpetuate casteism in the country.\n\n Reservation is under-written by a special justification.\n Equality in \nArticle 16(1)\n is individual- specific whereas\n reservation in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16 (4-A)\n is enabling.\n The discretion of the State is, however, subject to the\n existence of \"backwardness\" and \"inadequacy of representation\"\n\n in public employment. Backwardness has to be based on objective\n factors whereas inadequacy has to factually exist. This is where\n judicial review comes in. However, whether reservation in a\n given case is desirable or not, as a policy, is not for us to\n decide as long as the parameters mentioned in \nArticles 16(4)\n and\n \n16(4-A)\n are maintained. As stated above, equity, justice and\n merit (\nArticle 335\n)/efficiency are variables which can only be\n identified and measured by the State. Therefore, in each case, a\n contextual case has to be made out depending upon different\n circumstances which may exist Statewise.”\n\n37. The Bench referred to the cases of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra), \nR.K.\nSabharwal\n (supra), \nVir Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra), \nAjit Singh (I\n) (supra)\nand Ajit Singh (II) (supra) and opined that the concept of catch-up rule\nand consequential seniority are judicially evolved concepts to control the\nextent in reservation and the creation of this concept is relatable to\nservice jurisprudence. Thereafter, the Constitution Bench referred to the\nscope of the impugned amendment and the Objects and Reasons and, in\nparagraph 86, observed thus: -\n\n “Clause (4-A) follows the pattern specified in Clauses (3) and\n (4) of \nArticle 16.\n Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n emphasizes the\n opinion of the States in the matter of adequacy of\n representation. It gives freedom to the State in an appropriate\n case depending upon the ground reality to provide for\n reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of\n posts in the services. The State has to form its opinion on the\n quantifiable data regarding adequacy of representation. Clause\n (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n is an enabling provision. It gives freedom\n to the State to provide for reservation in matters of promotion.\n\n Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n applies only to SCs and STs. The said\n clause is carved out of \nArticle 16(4).\n Therefore, Clause (4-A)\n will be governed by the two compelling reasons - \"backwardness\"\n and \"inadequacy of representation\", as mentioned in\n \nArticle 16(4).\n If the said two reasons do not exist then the\n enabling provision cannot come into force. The State can make\n provision for reservation only if the above two circumstances\n exist. Further in Ajit Singh (II) , this Court has held that\n apart from “backwardness” and “inadequacy of representation” the\n State shall also keep in mind “overall efficiency” (Article\n\n 335). Therefore, all the three factors have to be kept in mind\n by the appropriate Government in providing for reservation in\n promotion for SCs and STs.”\n\n Thereafter, the Bench referred to the 2000 Amendment Act, the Objects\nand Reasons and the proviso inserted to \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution and\nheld thus: -\n\n “98. \nBy the Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act, 2000\n, a\n proviso was inserted at the end of \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution which reads as under:\n\n “Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent\n in making of any provision in favour of the members of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in\n qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the\n standards of evaluation, for reservation in matters of\n promotion to any class or classes of services or posts in\n connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.”\n\n 99. This proviso was added following the benefit of\n reservation in promotion conferred upon SCs and STs alone. This\n proviso was inserted keeping in mind the judgment of this Court\n in Vinod Kumar which took the view that relaxation in matters of\n reservation in promotion was not permissible under\n \nArticle 16(4)\n in view of the command contained in \nArticle 335.\n\n Once a separate category is carved out of Clause (4) of\n \nArticle 16\n then that category is being given relaxation in\n matters of reservation in promotion. The proviso is confined to\n SCs and STs alone. The said proviso is compatible with the\n scheme of \nArticle 16(4-A)\n.”\n\n In paragraph 102, their Lordships have ruled thus: -\n\n “Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n, however, states that the appropriate\n Government is free to provide for reservation in cases where it\n is satisfied on the basis of quantifiable data that backward\n class is inadequately represented in the services. Therefore, in\n every case where the State decides to provide for reservation\n there must exist two circumstances, namely, “backwardness” and\n “inadequacy of representation’. As stated above, equity, justice\n and efficiency are variable factors. These factors are context-\n specific. There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure\n these three factors, it will depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case. These are the limitations on the\n mode of the exercise of power by the State. None of these\n limitations have been removed by the impugned amendments. If the\n concerned State fails to identify and measure backwardness,\n inadequacy and overall administrative efficiency then in that\n event the provision for reservation would be invalid. These\n amendments do not alter the structure of\n \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16 (equity code).\n The parameters mentioned\n in \nArticle 16(4)\n are retained. Clause (4-A) is derived from\n Clause (4) of \nArticle 16.\n Clause (4-A) is confined to SCs and\n STs alone. Therefore, the present case does not change the\n identity of the Constitution.”\n\nAfter so stating, it was observed that there is no violation of the basic\nstructure of the Constitution and the provisions are enabling provisions.\nAt that juncture, it has been observed as follows: -\n\n “Article 16(4) is enacted as a remedy for the past historical\n discriminations against a social class. The object in enacting\n the enabling provisions like \nArticles 16(4)\n, 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-\n B)\n is that the State is empowered to identify and recognize the\n compelling interests. If the State has quantifiable data to show\n backwardness and inadequacy then the State can make reservations\n in promotions keeping in mind maintenance of efficiency which is\n held to be a constitutional limitation on the discretion of the\n State in making reservation as indicated by \nArticle 335.\n As\n stated above, the concepts of efficiency, backwardness,\n inadequacy of representation are required to be identified and\n measured. That exercise depends on availability of data. That\n exercise depends on numerous factors. It is for this reason that\n enabling provisions are required to be made because each\n competing claim seeks to achieve certain goals. How best one\n should optimize these conflicting claims can only be done by the\n administration in the context of local prevailing conditions in\n public employment. This is amply demonstrated by the various\n decisions of this Court discussed hereinabove. Therefore, there\n is a basic difference between “equality in law” and “equality in\n fact” (See Affirmative Action by William Darity). If\n \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n flow from \nArticle 16(4)\n and if\n \nArticle 16(4)\n is an enabling provision then \nArticles 16(4-\n A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are also enabling provisions. As long as the\n boundaries mentioned in \nArticle 16(4)\n, namely, backwardness,\n inadequacy and efficiency of administration are retained in\n \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n as controlling factors, we cannot\n attribute constitutional invalidity to these enabling\n provisions. However, when the State fails to identify and\n implement the controlling factors then excessiveness comes in,\n which is to be decided on the facts of each case. In a given\n case, where excessiveness results in reverse discrimination,\n this Court has to examine individual cases and decide the matter\n in accordance with law. This is the theory of “guided power”.\n\n We may once again repeat that equality is not violated by mere\n conferment of power but it is breached by arbitrary exercise of\n the power conferred.”\n\nIn paragraph 108, the Bench analyzed the concept of application of the\ndoctrine of guided power under \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution and, in that\ncontext, opined thus: -\n\n “Therefore, the question before us is - whether the State could\n be empowered to relax qualifying marks or standards for\n reservation in matters of promotion. In our view, even after\n insertion of this proviso, the limitation of overall efficiency\n in \nArticle 335\n is not obliterated. Reason is that \"efficiency\"\n is a variable factor. It is for State concerned to decide in a\n given case, whether the overall efficiency of the system is\n affected by such relaxation. If the relaxation is so excessive\n that it ceases to be qualifying marks then certainly in a given\n case, as in the past, the State is free not to relax such\n standards. In other cases, the State may evolve a mechanism\n under which efficiency, equity and justice, all three variables,\n could be accommodated. Moreover, \nArticle 335\n is to be read with\n \nArticle 46\n which provides that the State shall promote with\n special care the educational and economic interests of the\n weaker sections of the people and, in particular, of the\n scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and shall protect them\n from social injustice. Therefore, where the State finds\n compelling interests of backwardness and inadequacy, it may\n relax the qualifying marks for SCs/STs. These compelling\n interests however have to be identified by weighty and\n comparable data.”\n\n Thereafter, the Constitution Bench proceeded to deal with the test to\njudge the validity of the impugned State Acts and opined as follows: -\n\n “110. As stated above, the boundaries of the width of the power,\n namely, the ceiling-limit of 50% (the numerical benchmark), the\n principle of creamy layer, the compelling reasons, namely,\n backwardness, inadequacy of representation and the overall\n administrative efficiency are not obliterated by the impugned\n amendments. At the appropriate time, we have to consider the law\n as enacted by various States providing for reservation if\n challenged. At that time we have to see whether limitations on\n the exercise of power are violated. The State is free to\n exercise its discretion of providing for reservation subject to\n limitation, namely, that there must exist compelling reasons of\n backwardness, inadequacy of representation in a class of post(s)\n keeping in mind the overall administrative efficiency. It is\n made clear that even if the State has reasons to make\n reservation, as stated above, if the impugned law violates any\n of the above substantive limits on the width of the power the\n same would be liable to be set aside.”\n\nIn paragraph 117, the Bench laid down as follows: -\n\n “The extent of reservation has to be decided on facts of each\n case. The judgment in Indra Sawhney does not deal with\n constitutional amendments. In our present judgment, we are\n upholding the validity of the constitutional amendments subject\n to the limitations. Therefore, in each case the Court has got to\n be satisfied that the State has exercised its opinion in making\n reservations in promotions for SCs and STs and for which the\n State concerned will have to place before the Court the\n requisite quantifiable data in each case and satisfy the Court\n that such reservations became necessary on account of inadequacy\n of representation of SCs/ STs in a particular class or classes\n of posts without affecting general efficiency of service as\n mandated under \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution.”\n\nIn the conclusion portions, in paragraphs 123 and 124, it has been ruled\nthus: -\n\n “123. However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue\n concerns the \"extent of reservation\". In this regard the State\n concerned will have to show in each case the existence of the\n compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\n representation and overall administrative efficiency before\n making provision for reservation. As stated above, the impugned\n provision is an enabling provision. The State is not bound to\n make reservation for SCs/STs in matter of promotions. However,\n if they wish to exercise their discretion and make such\n provision, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing\n backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of\n that class in public employment in addition to compliance with\n \nArticle 335.\n It is made clear that even if the State has\n compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will have to see\n that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so\n as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy\n layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.\n\n 124. Subject to the above, we uphold the constitutional\n validity of the \nConstitution (Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act,\n 1995\n; the \nConstitution (Eighty-First Amendment) Act, 2000\n; the\n \nConstitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act, 2000\n and the\n \nConstitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n.”\n\n38. From the aforesaid decision and the paragraphs we have quoted\nhereinabove, the following principles can be carved out: -\n\n i) Vesting of the power by an enabling provision may be constitutionally\n valid and yet ‘exercise of power’ by the State in a given case may be\n arbitrary, particularly, if the State fails to identify and measure\n backwardness and inadequacy keeping in mind the efficiency of service\n as required under \nArticle 335.\n\n ii) \nArticle 16(4)\n which protects the interests of certain sections of the\n society has to be balanced against \nArticle 16(1)\n which protects the\n interests of every citizen of the entire society. They should be\n harmonized because they are restatements of the principle of equality\n under \nArticle 14.\n\n iii) Each post gets marked for the particular category of candidates to be\n appointed against it and any subsequent vacancy has to be filled by\n that category candidate.\n\n iv) The appropriate Government has to apply the cadre strength as a unit\n in the operation of the roster in order to ascertain whether a given\n class/group is adequately represented in the service. The cadre\n strength as a unit also ensures that the upper ceiling-limit of 50% is\n not violated. Further roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy\n based.\n\n v) The State has to form its opinion on the quantifiable data regarding\n adequacy of representation. Clause (4A) of \nArticle 16\n is an enabling\n provision. It gives freedom to the State to provide for reservation\n in matters of promotion. Clause (4A) of \nArticle 16\n applies only to\n SCs and STs. The said clause is carved out of \nArticle 16(4A).\n\n Therefore, Clause (4A) will be governed by the two compelling reasons\n – “backwardness” and “inadequacy of representation”, as mentioned in\n \nArticle 16(4).\n If the said two reasons do not exist, then the\n enabling provision cannot be enforced.\n\n vi) If the ceiling-limit on the carry-over of unfilled vacancies is\n removed, the other alternative time-factor comes in and in that event,\n the time-scale has to be imposed in the interest of efficiency in\n administration as mandated by \nArticle 335.\n If the time-scale is not\n kept, then posts will continue to remain vacant for years which would\n be detrimental to the administration. Therefore, in each case, the\n appropriate Government will now have to introduce the duration\n depending upon the fact-situation.\n\n vii) If the appropriate Government enacts a law providing for reservation\n without keeping in mind the parameters in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle\n 335\n, then this Court will certainly set aside and strike down such\n legislation.\n\nviii) The constitutional limitation under \nArticle 335\n is relaxed and not\n obliterated. As stated above, be it reservation or evaluation,\n excessiveness in either would result in violation of the\n constitutional mandate. This exercise, however, will depend on the\n facts of each case.\n\n ix) The concepts of efficiency, backwardness and inadequacy of\n representation are required to be identified and measured. That\n exercise depends on the availability of data. That exercise depends\n on numerous factors. It is for this reason that the enabling\n provisions are required to be made because each competing claim seeks\n to achieve certain goals. How best one should optimize these\n conflicting claims can only be done by the administration in the\n context of local prevailing conditions in public employment.\n\n x) \nArticle 16(4)\n, therefore, creates a field which enables a State to\n provide for reservation provided there exists backwardness of a class\n and inadequacy of representation in employment. These are compelling\n reasons. They do not exist in \nArticle 16(1).\n It is only when these\n reasons are satisfied that a State gets the power to provide for\n reservation in the matter of employment.\n\n \n39. At this stage, we think it appropriate to refer to the case of \nSuraj\nBhan Meena and another\n (supra).\n \nIn the said case, while interpreting the\ncase in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra), the two-Judge Bench has observed: -\n\n “10. \nIn \nM. Nagaraj\n case, this Court while upholding the\n constitutional validity of the Constitution (77thAmendment) Act,\n 1995 and the Constitution (85th \nAmendment) Act, 2001\n, clarified\n the position that it would not be necessary for the State\n Government to frame rules in respect of reservation in promotion\n with consequential seniority, but in case the State Government\n wanted to frame such rules in this regard, then it would have to\n satisfy itself by quantifiable data, that there was\n backwardness, inadequacy of representation in public employment\n and overall administrative inefficiency and unless such an\n exercise was undertaken by the State Government, the rule\n relating to reservation in promotion with consequential\n seniority could not be introduced.”\n\n40. \nIn the said case, the State Government had not undertaken any\nexercise as indicated in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra). The two-Judge Bench has noted\nthree conditions in \nthe said judgment\n.\n \nIt was canvassed before the Bench\nthat exercise to be undertaken as per the direction in \nM.Nagaraj\n (supra)\nwas mandatory and the State cannot, either directly or indirectly,\ncircumvent or ignore or refuse to undertake the exercise by taking recourse\nto the \nConstitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act\n providing for reservation\nfor promotion with consequential seniority. While dealing with the\ncontentions, the two-Judge Bench opined that the State is required to place\nbefore the Court the requisite quantifiable data in each case and to\nsatisfy the court that the said reservation became necessary on account of\ninadequacy of representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\ncandidates in a particular class or classes of posts, without affecting the\ngeneral efficiency of service. Eventually, the Bench opined as follows: -\n\n \n“66. The position after the decision in \nM. Nagaraj\n case is that\n reservation of posts in promotion is dependent on the inadequacy\n of representation of members of the Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes and subject to the\n condition of ascertaining as to whether such reservation was at\n all required.\n\n \n67. The view of the High Court is based on the decision in \nM.\n Nagaraj\n case as no exercise was undertaken in terms of\n \nArticle 16(4-A)\n to acquire quantifiable data regarding the\n inadequacy of representation of the Schedule Caste and Scheduled\n Tribe communities in public services. The Rajasthan High Court\n has rightly quashed the notifications dated 28.12.2002 and\n 25.4.2008 issued by the State of Rajasthan providing for\n consequential seniority and promotion to the members of the\n Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities and the same\n does not call for any interference.”\n\nAfter so stating, the two-Judge Bench affirmed the view taken by the High\nCourt of Rajasthan.\n\n41. As has been indicated hereinbefore, it has been vehemently argued by\nthe learned senior counsel for the State and the learned senior counsel for\nthe Corporation that once the principle of reservation was made applicable\nto the spectrum of promotion, no fresh exercise is necessary. It is also\nurged that the efficiency in service is not jeopardized. Reference has\nbeen made to the Social Justice Committee Report and the chart. We need\nnot produce the same as the said exercise was done regard being had to the\npopulation and vacancies and not to the concepts that have been evolved in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n (supra).\n \nIt is one thing to think that there are statutory\nrules or executive instructions to grant promotion but it cannot be\nforgotten that they were all subject to the pronouncement by this Court in\n\nVir Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra) and Ajit Singh (II) (supra).\n \nWe are of the\nfirm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) is a categorical imperative. The\nstand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated the reservation\nin promotion with consequential seniority and have given the stamp of\napproval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close scrutiny inasmuch\nas the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that \nArticles 16(4A)\n and\n\n16(4B)\n are enabling provisions and the State can make provisions for the\nsame on certain basis or foundation. The conditions precedent have not\nbeen satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What has been argued\nwith vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept of reservation in\npromotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept the said\nsubmission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are treated valid\nwith certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on the part of the\nState to appreciate and apply the test so that its amendments can be tested\nand withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid down therein.\n\n42. \nIn the ultimate analysis, we conclude and hold that Section 3(7) of\nthe 1994 Act and Rule 8A of the 2007 Rules are ultra vires as they run\ncounter to the dictum in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra).\n \nAny promotion that has been\ngiven on the dictum of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) and without the aid or\nassistance of Section 3(7) and Rule 8A shall remain undisturbed.\n\n43. The appeals arising out of the final judgment of Division Bench at\nAllahabad are allowed and the impugned order is set aside. The appeals\narising out of the judgment from the Division Bench at Lucknow is affirmed\nsubject to the modification as stated hereinabove. In view of the\naforesaid, all other appeals are disposed of. The parties shall bear their\nrespective costs.\n\n ......................................................J.\n [Dalveer Bhandari]\n\n ......................................................J.\n [Dipak Misra]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nApril 27, 2012\n\n-----------------------\n\n[1] (2006) 8 SCC 212 : AIR 2007 SC 71\n[2] 1992 Supp. (3) SCC 217 : AIR 1993 SC 477\n[3] AIR 1965 SC 1767\n[4] AIR 1991 SC 1893\n[5] AIR 1962 SC 36\n[6] (1970) 3 SCC 567\n[7] (1981) 1 SCC 246\n[8] (1986) 2 SCC 679\n[9] (1995) 6 SCC 684\n[10] (1995) 2 SCC 745\n[11] (1996) 2 SCC 715\n[12] AIR 1997 SC 2366\n[13] (1999) 7 SCC 209\n[14] (2009) 8 SCC 220\n[15] (2008) 6 SCC 1\n[16] (2005) 1 SCC 394\n[17] (2011) 1 SCC 467\n[18] (1970) 3 SCC 567\n[19] 2010 4 SCC 50\n[20] (2008) 6 SCC 1",

Rule 8A of 1991 Rules specifically stipulates that\n if any member of scheduled castes or scheduled tribes is\n promoted on any post or grade in service earlier to other\n categories of persons, the member of SC/ST shall be treated to\n be senior to such other categories of persons who are promoted\n subsequently after promotion of members of SC/ST, despite\n anything contained in Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules. In our\n view Rule 8A of 1991 Rules has constitutional sanctity of\n \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution and cannot be found faulty\n merely on account of violation of judicially evolved concept of\n catch-up rule of seniority which has been specifically\n obliterated by \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution. Likewise the\n said rule can also not be held to be unconstitutional or invalid\n on account of obliteration of any other judicially evolved\n principle of seniority or any other contrary rules of seniority\n existing under Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules, as Rule 8A of\n 1991 Rules opens with non-obstante clause with overriding effect\n upon Rules 6, 7 and 8 of 1991 Rules, therefore, we do not find\n any justification to strike down the provisions contained under\n Rule 8-A of 1991 Rules on the said ground and on any of the\n grounds mentioned in the writ petition.”"

The\nquestion of reservation and the associated promotion with it has been a\nmatter of debate in various decisions of this Court. After independence,\nthere were various areas in respect of which decisions were pronounced.\nEventually, in the case of \nIndra Sawhney and another v. Union of India and\nothers\n (supra) the nine-Judge Bench, while dealing with the question\nwhether clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution provides for\nreservation only in the matter of initial appointment, direct recruitment\nor does it contemplate and provide for reservations being made in the\nmatter of promotion as well, recorded the submissions of the petitioners in\nparagraph 819 which reads as follows: -"

It\n is submitted that providing for reservation thereafter in the\n matter of promotion amounts to a double reservation and if such\n a provision is made at each successive stage of promotion it\n would be a case of reservation being provided that many times.\n It is also submitted that by providing reservation in the matter\n of promotion, the member of a reserved category is enabled to\n leap-frog over his compatriots, which is bound to generate acute\n heartburning and may well lead to inefficiency in\n administration. The members of the open competition category\n would come to think that whatever be their record and\n performance, the members of reserved categories would steal a\n march over them, irrespective of their performance and\n competence. Examples are give how two persons (A) and (B), one\n belonging to O.C. category and the other belonging to reserved\n category, having been appointed at the same time, the member of\n the reserved category gets promoted earlier and how even in the\n promoted category he jumps over the members of the O.C. category\n already there and gains a further promotion and so on. This\n would generate, it is submitted, a feeling of disheartening\n which kills the spirit of competition and develops a sense of\n disinterestedness among the members of O.C. category. It is\n pointed out that once persons coming from different sources join\n a category or class, they must be treated alike thereafter in\n all matters including promotions and that no distinction is\n permissible on the basis of their “birth-mark”. It is also\n pointed out that even the Constituent Assembly debates on draft\n \nArticle 10(3)\n do not indicate in any manner that it was\n supported to extend to promotions as well. It is further\n submitted that if \nArticle 16(4)\n is construed as warranting\n reservation even in the matter of promotion it would be contrary\n to the mandate of \nArticle 335\n viz., maintenance of efficiency in\n administration. \nIt is submitted that such a provision would\n amount to putting a premium upon inefficiency. The members of\n the reserved category would not work hard since they do not have\n to compete with all their colleagues but only within the\n reserved category and further because they are assured of\n promotion whether they work hard and efficiently or not.

The rule of reservation gives accelerated\n promotion, but it does not give the accelerated “consequential\n seniority”. If a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\n promoted earlier because of the rule of reservation/roster and\n his senior belonging to the general category is promoted later\n to that higher grade the general category candidate shall regain\n his seniority over such earlier promoted Scheduled Caste/Tribe\n candidate. As already pointed out above that when a Scheduled\n Caste/ Tribe candidate is promoted earlier by applying the rule\n of reservation/roster against a post reserved for such Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe candidate, in this process he does not supersede his\n seniors belonging to the general category. In this process\n there was no occasion to examine the merit of such Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe candidate vis-a-vis his seniors belonging to the\n general category. As such it will be only rational, just and\n proper to hold that when the general category candidate is\n promoted later from the lower grade to the higher grade, he will\n be considered senior to a candidate belonging to the Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe who had been given accelerated promotion against the\n post reserved for him. Whenever a question arises for filling\n up a post reserved for Scheduled Caste/Tribe candidate in a\n still higher grade then such candidate belonging to Scheduled\n Caste/Tribe shall be promoted first but when the consideration\n is in respect of promotion against the general category post in\n a still higher grade then the general category candidate who has\n been promoted later shall be considered senior and his case\n shall be considered first for promotion applying either\n principle of seniority-cum-merit or merit-cum-seniority. If\n this rule and procedure is not applied then result will be that\n majority of the posts in the higher grade shall be held at one\n stage by persons who have not only entered service on the basis\n of reservation and roster but have excluded the general category\n candidates from being promoted to the posts reserved for general\n category candidates merely on the ground of their initial\n accelerated promotions.

If the counter affidavit and other documents\nare studiedly scanned, it would be luminescent that opinion has been formed\nas regards inadequate representation in promotional posts and, therefore,\nit had become an imperative to provide for reservation. The opinion formed\nby the Government need not be with mathematical precision to broad spectrum\nand such exercise has already been done by the State of U.P., since\nreservation in promotional matters was already in vogue by virtue of\nadministrative circulars and statutory provisions for few decades. It\nis urged that the concept of inadequate representation and backwardness\nhave been accepted by the amending power of the Constitution and,\ntherefore, the High Court has totally flawed by laying unwarranted emphasis\non the said concepts. The High Court could not have sat in appeal on the\nrule of reservation solely on the factual bedrock. The chart brought on\nrecord would reflect department wise how the persons from backward classes\nhave not been extended the benefit of promotion and the same forms the\nfoundation for making the enactment and framing the rule and hence, no\nfault could have been found with the same. Once an incumbent belongs to\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes category, it is conclusive that he\nsuffers from backwardness and no further enquiry is necessary. It has been\nclearly held in the case of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) that the test or\nrequirement of social and educational backwardness cannot be applied to\nScheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes who indubitably fall within the\nexpression ‘Backward Classes of Citizen’. It is beyond any shadow of\ndoubt that Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes are a separate class by\nthemselves and the creamy layer principle is not applicable to them.\n \nIt\nhas been so held in \nAvinash Singh Bagri and Ors. v. Registrar IIT Delhi and\nAnother\n[14]. \nArticle 16 (4A)\n uses the phrase ‘in the opinion of’ and the\nsaid word carries a different meaning to convey that it is subjective in\nnature rather than objective. The Report of the “Social Justice\nCommittee” dated 28.06.2001 clearly ascertains the need for implementation\nof reservation in promotional matters in public service in U. P. and the\nsaid Report deserves acceptance. The State Government was possessed of\nsufficient materials to implement the promotional provisions which are\nenabling in nature and the same is justified by the “Social Justice\nCommittee Report” which has examined the current status of implementation\nof Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes in other\npublic services with respect to their quota, their participation and\nprogress in various services, the substantial backlog in promotional posts\nin category A, B and C posts and the inadequacy of representation in\npromotional posts and various departments and State owned corporations.\nThe High Court has completely erred specially when there was sufficient\ndata available with the State Government. Regard being had to the factum\nthat the said promotions were being given for few decades, a fresh exercise\nregarding adequacy was not necessary. The concept of efficiency as\nstipulated under \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution is in no way affected if\nthe reservation does not exceed 50%. The consequential seniority being\nvested by the Constitution, it follows as natural corollary and hence, no\nfurther exercise was required to be undertaken. The learned counsel for\nthe State has drawn the attention of this Court with respect to the\npercentage of representation to justify that requisite data was available\nand no further exercise was needed and, therefore, the decision of the High\nCourt is fundamentally fallacious."

If the State has quantifiable data to show\n backwardness and inadequacy then the State can make reservations\n in promotions keeping in mind maintenance of efficiency which is\n held to be a constitutional limitation on the discretion of the\n State in making reservation as indicated by \nArticle 335.\n As\n stated above, the concepts of efficiency, backwardness,\n inadequacy of representation are required to be identified and\n measured.
