Precisely, the facts of the case, as emerge from the\n\nrecord, are that the FIR sought to be quashed in the instant\n\nproceedings, came to be lodged at the behest of respondent\nWhether the reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nNo.2/complainant (hereinafter, 'complainant') who alleged that\n\non 8.2.2016 at 6.00 pm, petitioner unauthorizedly entered in\n\nher land and uprooted the boundary polls. The complainant\n\n.\n\nalso alleged that she tried to stop the petitioners from doing this\n\nunlawful act but the petitioners not only extended threats to her\n\nbut also caused damage to her property. Though, after\n\ncompletion of investigation, police has presented the Challan in\n\nthe competent court of law but before the same could be taken\n\nto its logical end, parties have entered into compromise, whereby\n\nthey have resolved to settle the dispute inter se them amicably.\n\nIn the aforesaid background, petitioners have approached this\n\ncourt in the instant proceedings for quashing of FIR alongwith\n\nconsequential proceedings pending in the competent court of\n\nlaw.\n\n3. Vide order dated 17.11.2022, this court while\n\ndirecting respondent-State to verify the factum with regard to\n\ncompromise, if any, arrived inter se parties, also deemed it\n\nnecessary to cause presence of respondent No.2, at whose\n\ninstance, FIR sought to be quashed in the instant proceedings,\n\ncame to be lodged so that the correctness and genuineness of\n\nthe compromise could be ascertained.\n\n4.

Respondent No.2 states on oath that\n\nshe of her own volition and without there being any external\n\npressure has entered into compromise with the petitioners,\n\nwhereby they have resolved to settle the dispute inter se them\n\namicably. She states that the FIR sought to be quashed is result\n\nof misunderstanding and otherwise also the petitioners have\n\napologized for\nr the damage caused to her property and\n\ncompensated her for the same, as such, she shall have no\n\nobjection in case, prayer made on behalf of the petitioners for\n\nquashing of FIR alongwith consequential proceedings is allowed\n\nand petitioners are acquitted of the charges framed against\n\nthem. While admitting contents of the compromise to be correct,\n\nshe also admits her signatures thereupon.\n\n5. Mr. Narender Guleria, learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral, after having heard the statement made by respondent\n\nNo.2, states that no fruitful purpose will be served in case FIR as\n\nwell consequent proceedings against the petitioner are allowed to\n\nsustain.

The question which now needs consideration is\n\n.\n\nwhether FIR in question can be ordered to be quashed when\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in\nNarinder Singh and others versus State\n\nof Punjab and another\n(2014)6 SCC 466 has specifically held\n\nthat power under\nS. 482\nCrPC is not to be exercised in the cases\n\nwhich involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n\nor offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on society.\n\n7. At this stage, it would be relevant to take note of the\n\njudgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in\nNarinder Singh\n\n(supra), whereby the Hon'ble Apex Court has formulated\n\nguidelines for accepting the settlement and quashing the\n\nproceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with direction to\n\ncontinue with the criminal proceedings. Perusal of judgment\n\nreferred to above\nclearly depicts that in para 29.1, Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has returned the findings that power conferred under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code is to be distinguished from the power\n\nwhich lies in the Court to compound the offences under\nSection\nof the Code. No doubt, under\nSection 482\nof the Code, the\n\nHigh Court has inherent power to quash criminal proceedings\n\neven in those cases which are not compoundable and where the\n\nparties have settled the matter between themselves, however,\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nthis power is to be exercised sparingly and with great caution.\n\nPara Nos. 29 to 29.7 of the judgment are reproduced as under:-\n\n\"29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum\n\n.\n\nup and lay down the following principles by which\n\nthe High Court would be guided in giving adequate\ntreatment to the settlement between the parties\nand exercising its power under\nSection 482\nof the\nCode while accepting the settlement and quashing\n\nthe proceedings or refusing to accept the\nsettlement with direction to continue with the\ncriminal proceedings:\n\n29.1 Power conferred under\nSection 482\nof the\nCode is to be distinguished from the power which\n\nlies in the Court to compound the offences under\n\nSection 320\nof the Code. No doubt, under\nSection\nof the Code, the High Court has inherent\npower to quash the criminal proceedings even in\nthose cases which are not compoundable, where\n\nthe parties have settled the matter between\nthemselves. However, this power is to be exercised\n\nsparingly and with caution.\n\n29.2. When the parties have reached the\nsettlement and on that basis petition for quashing\nthe criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor\nin such cases would be to secure:\n\n(i) ends of justice, or\n\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\nWhile exercising the power under\nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C the High Court is to form an opinion on\n\neither of the aforesaid two objectives.\n29.3. Such a power is not be exercised in those\n\nprosecutions which involve heinous and serious\noffences of mental depravity or offences like\nmurder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on\n\nsociety. Similarly, for offences alleged to have been\ncommitted under special statute like the\nPrevention\nof Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by\nPublic Servants while working in that capacity are\nnot to be quashed merely on the basis of\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n29.4. On the other, those criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominantly civil\ncharacter, particularly those arising out of\ncommercial transactions or arising out of\nmatrimonial relationship or family disputes should\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nbe quashed when the parties have resolved their\nentire disputes among themselves.\n\n29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is\nto examine as to whether the possibility of\nconviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\n\n.\n\ncriminal cases would put the accused to great\n\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice\nwould be caused to him by not quashing the\ncriminal cases.\n\n29.6. Offences under\nSection 307\nIPC would fall in\n\nthe category of heinous and serious offences and\ntherefore is to be generally treated as crime\nagainst the society and not against the individual\nalone. However, the High Court would not rest its\ndecision merely because there is a mention of\n\nSection 307\nIPC in the FIR or the charge is framed\nunder this provision. It would be open to the High\nCourt to examine as to whether incorporation of\n\nSection 307\nIPC is there for the sake of it or the\nprosecution has collected sufficient evidence,\n\nwhich if proved, would lead to proving the charge\nunder\nSection 307\nIPC. For this purpose, it would\n\nbe open to the High Court to go by the nature of\ninjury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted\non the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of\nweapons used etc. Medical report in respect of\ninjuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\n\nguiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie\nanalysis, the High Court can examine as to\nwhether there is a strong possibility of conviction\nor the chances of conviction are remote and bleak.\n\nIn the former case it can refuse to accept the\nsettlement and quash the criminal proceedings\n\nwhereas in the later case it would be permissible\nfor the High Court to accept the plea compounding\nthe offence based on complete settlement between\nthe parties. At this stage, the Court can also be\n\nswayed by the fact that the settlement between\nthe parties is going to result in harmony between\nthem which may improve their future relationship.\n29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power\nunder Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of\nsettlement play a crucial role. Those cases where\nthe settlement is arrived at immediately after the\nalleged commission of offence and the matter is\nstill under investigation, the High Court may be\nliberal in accepting the settlement to quash the\ncriminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of\nthe reason that at this stage the investigation is\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nstill on and even the charge sheet has not been\nfiled. Likewise, those cases where the charge is\nframed but the evidence is yet to start or the\nevidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court\ncan show benevolence in exercising its powers\n\n.\n\nfavourably, but after prima facie assessment of the\n\ncircumstances/material mentioned above. On the\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is\nalmost complete or after the conclusion of the\nevidence the matter is at the stage of argument,\n\nnormally the High Court should refrain from\nexercising its power under Section 482 of the Code,\nas in such cases the trial court would be in a\nposition to decide the case finally on merits and to\ncome a conclusion as to whether the offence under\n\nSection 307\nIPC is committed or not. Similarly, in\nthose cases where the conviction is already\nrecorded by the trial court and the matter is at the\nappellate stage before the High Court, mere\ncompromise between the parties would not be a\n\nground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of\nthe offender who has already been convicted by\n\nthe trial court. Here charge is proved under\nSection\nIPC and conviction is already recorded of a\nheinous crime and, therefore, there is no question\nof sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime\".\n\n8. Careful perusal of para 29.3 of the judgment\n\nsuggests that such a power is not to be exercised in the cases\n\nwhich involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n\nor offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\nprivate in nature and have a serious impact on society. Apart\n\nfrom this, offences committed under special statute like the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by Public\n\nServants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed\n\nmerely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the\n\noffender. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\n\noverwhelmingly and predominantly civil character, particularly\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\narising out of commercial transactions or arising out of\n\nmatrimonial relationship or family disputes may be quashed\n\nwhen the parties have resolved their entire disputes among\n\n.\n\nthemselves.\n\n9. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case\nGian Singh v. State\n\nof Punjab\nand anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303 has held that power of\n\nthe High Court in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or\n\ncomplaint in exercise of its inherent power is distinct and\n\ndifferent from the power of a Criminal Court for compounding\n\noffences under\nSection 320\nCr.PC. Even in the judgment passed\n\nin\nNarinder Singh\n's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that\n\nwhile exercising inherent power of quashment under\nSection 482\n\nCr.PC the Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity\n\nof the crime and its social impact and it cautioned the Courts\n\nnot to exercise the power for quashing proceedings in heinous\n\nand serious offences of mental depravity, murder, rape, dacoity\n\netc.\nHowever subsequently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Dimpey\n\nGujral and Ors. vs. Union Territory through Administrator,\n\nUT, Chandigarh and Ors. (2013( 11 SCC 497 has also held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"7. In certain decisions of this Court in view of the\nsettlement arrived at by the parties, this Court\nquashed the FIRs though some of the offences were\nnon-compoundable. A two Judges' Bench of this\ncourt doubted the correctness of those decisions.\nLearned Judges felt that in those decisions, this\ncourt had permitted compounding of non-\ncompoundable offences. The said issue was,\ntherefore, referred to a larger bench.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nThe larger Bench in\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n\n(2012) 10 SCC 303 considered the relevant\nprovisions of the Code and the judgments of this\ncourt and concluded as under: (SCC pp. 342-43,\npara 61)\n\n.\n\n61. The position that emerges from the above\n\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power of\nthe High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or\nFIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent\njurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\n\ngiven to a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in accord with\nthe guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to\n\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of\nthe process of any Court. In what cases power to\nquash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R\nmay be exercised where the offender and victim\nhave settled their dispute would depend on the facts\n\nand circumstances of each case and no category can\nbe prescribed. However, before exercise of such\n\npower, the High Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious\noffences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\nrape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even\nthough the victim or victim's family and the offender\n\nhave settled the dispute. Such offences are not\nprivate in nature and have serious impact on society.\nSimilarly, any compromise between the victim and\noffender in relation to the offences under special\n\nstatutes like\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the\noffences committed by public servants while working\n\nin that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for\nquashing criminal proceedings involving such\noffences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour\n\nstand on different footing for the purposes of\nquashing, particularly the offences arising from\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\nor such like transactions or the offences arising out\nof matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family\ndisputes where the wrong is basically private or\npersonal in nature and the parties have resolved\ntheir entire dispute. In this category of cases, High\nCourt may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and\nvictim, the possibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak and continuation of criminal case would put\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\naccused to great oppression and prejudice and\nextreme injustice would be caused to him by not\nquashing the criminal case despite full and complete\nsettlement and compromise with the victim. In other\nwords, the High Court must consider whether it\n\n.\n\nwould be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice\n\nto continue with the criminal proceeding or\ncontinuation of the criminal proceeding would\ntantamount to abuse of process of law despite\nsettlement and compromise between the victim and\n\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,\nit is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end\nand if the answer to the above question(s) is in\naffirmative, the High Court shall be well within its\njurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n8. In the light of the above observations of this court\nin Gian Singh, we feel that this is a case where the\ncontinuation of criminal proceedings would\ntantamount to abuse of process of law because the\nr alleged offences are not heinous offences showing\nextreme depravity nor are they against the society.\n\nThey are offences of a personal nature and burying\nthem would bring about peace and amity between\nthe two sides. In the circumstances of the case, FIR\nNo. 163 dated 26.10.2006 registered under\nSection\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC at\n\nPolice Station Sector 3, Chandigarh and all\nconsequential proceedings arising there from\nincluding the final report presented under Section\n173 of the Code and charges framed by the trial\n\nCourt are hereby quashed.\"\n\n10. Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment dated 4th\n\nOctober, 2017, titled as\nParbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai\n\nBhimsinhbhai Karmur and others versus State of Gujarat and\n\nAnother\n, passed in Criminal Appeal No.1723 of 2017 arising out\n\nof SLP(Crl) No.9549 of 2016, reiterated the principles/\n\nparameters\nlaid down in\n\nNarinder Singh\n's case supra for\n\naccepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings. It would\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nbe profitable to reproduce para No. 13 to 15 of the judgment\n\nherein:\n\n\"13. The same principle was followed in Central\n\n.\n\nBureau of Investigation v. Maninder Singh\n(2016)1\n\nSCC 389 by a bench of two learned Judges of this\nCourt. In that case, the High Court had, in the\nexercise of its inherent power under Section 482\nquashed proceedings under Sections 420, 467, 468\n\nand 471 read with Section 120-B of the Penal Code.\nWhile allowing the appeal filed by the Central\nBureau of Investigation Mr Justice Dipak Misra (as\nthe learned Chief Justice then was) observed that\nthe case involved allegations of forgery of documents\n\nto embezzle the funds of the bank. In such a\nsituation, the fact that the dispute had been settled\nwith the bank would not justify a recourse to\nthepower under Section 482:\n\n\"...In economic offences Court must not only keep in\n\nview that money has been paid to the bank which\nhas been defrauded but also the society at large. It is\n\nnot a case of simple assault or a theft of a trivial\namount; but the offence with which we are\nconcerned is well planned and was committed with a\ndeliberate design with an eye of personal profit\nregardless of consequence to the society at large. To\n\nquash the proceeding merely on the ground that the\naccused has settled the amount with the bank would\nbe a misplaced sympathy. If the prosecution against\nthe economic offenders are not allowed to continue,\n\nthe entire community is aggrieved.\"\n\n14. In a subsequent decision in State of Tamil Nadu\n\nv R Vasanthi Stanley (2016) 1 SCC 376, the court\nrejected the submission that the first respondent was\na woman \"who was following the command of her\nhusband\" and had signed certain documents without\n\nbeing aware of the nature of the fraud which was\nbeing perpetrated on the bank. Rejecting the\nsubmission, this Court held that:\n\n\"... Lack of awareness, knowledge or intent is neither\nto be considered nor accepted in economic offences.\nThe submission assiduously presented on gender\nleaves us unimpressed. An offence under the\ncriminal law is an offence and it does not depend\nupon the gender of an accused. True it is, there are\ncertain provisions in\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n\nrelating to exercise of jurisdiction Under Section 437,\netc. therein but that altogether pertains to a different\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nsphere. A person committing a murder or getting\ninvolved in a financial scam or forgery of documents,\ncannot claim discharge or acquittal on the ground of\nher gender as that is neither constitutionally nor\nstatutorily a valid argument. The offence is gender\n\n.\n\nneutral in this case. We say no more on this score...\"\n\n\"...A grave criminal offence or serious economic\noffence or for that matter the offence that has the\npotentiality to create a dent in the financial health of\n\nthe institutions, is not to be quashed on the ground\nthat there is delay in trial or the principle that when\nthe matter has been settled it should be quashed to\navoid the load on the system...\"\n\n15. The broad principles which emerge from the\nprecedents on the subject may be summarized in the\nfollowing propositions:\n\n(i) Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the\nHigh Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any\n\ncourt or to secure the ends of justice. The provision\ndoes not confer new powers. It only recognizes and\n\npreserves powers which inhere in the High Court;\n\n(ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court\nto quash a First Information Report or a criminal\nproceeding on the ground that a settlement has been\narrived at between the offender and the victim is not\n\nthe same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the\npurpose of compounding an offence. While\ncompounding an offence, the power of the court is\ngoverned by the provisions of\nSection 320\nof the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to\nquash under Section 482 is attracted even if the\n\noffence is non-compoundable.\n\n(iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal\nproceeding or complaint should be quashed in\nexercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the\n\nHigh Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice\nwould justify the exercise of the inherent power;\n\n(iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a\nwide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse\nof the process of any court;\n\n(v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First\nInformation Report should be quashed on the ground\nthat the offender and victim have settled the dispute,\nrevolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no exhaustive elaboration of\nprinciples can be formulated;\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\nvi) In the exercise of the power under Section 482\nand while dealing with a plea that the dispute has\nbeen settled, the High Court must have due regard to\nthe nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and\n\n.\n\nserious offences involving mental depravity or\n\noffences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot\nappropriately be quashed though the victim or the\nfamily of the victim have settled the dispute. Such\noffences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but\n\nhave a serious impact upon society. The decision to\ncontinue with the trial in such cases is founded on\nthe overriding element of public interest in punishing\npersons for serious offences;\n\n(vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there\n\nmay be criminal cases which have an overwhelming\nor predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand\non a distinct footing in so far as the exercise of the\ninherent power to quash is concerned;\n\n(viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise\n\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or\nsimilar transactions with an essentially civil flavour\n\nmay in appropriate situations fall for quashing where\nparties have settled the dispute;\n\n(ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the\ncriminal proceeding if in view of the compromise\nbetween the disputants, the possibility of a\n\nconviction is remote and the continuation of a\ncriminal proceeding would cause oppression and\nprejudice; and\n\n(x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\n\npropositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences\ninvolving the financial and economic well-being of the\n\nstate have implications which lie beyond the domain\nof a mere dispute between private disputants. The\nHigh Court would be justified in declining to quash\nwhere the offender is involved in an activity akin to a\n\nfinancial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The\nconsequences of the act complained of upon the\nfinancial or economic system will weigh in the\nbalance.\"\n\n11. In the case at hand, the offences alleged to have\n\nbeen committed by the accused do not pertain to offence of\n\nmoral turpitude or heinous offences rather the offence alleged to\n\nhave been committed is a petty offence and more over\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\ncompromise has been arrived at inter se parties, as such, no\n\nfruitful purpose would be served in continuing with criminal\n\nprosecution of the petitioners, more so when the complainant\n\n.\n\nhas compromised the matter with the accused and she is also\n\nno more interested in pursuing the case further. Otherwise also,\n\nthere are bleak and remote chances of conviction of accused and\n\nas such, this court sees no impediment in accepting the prayer\n\nmade by petitioners for quashing of FIR.\n\n12.
