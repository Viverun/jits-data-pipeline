DYNA TECHNOLOGIES PVT. LTD. …APPELLANT(S)\n\nVERSUS\nM/S. CROMPTON GREAVES LTD. …RESPONDENT(S)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nN. V. RAMANA, J.\n\n1. The question involved herein revolves around the requirement of\n\nreasoned award and the cautionary tale for the parties and\n\narbitrators to have a clear award, rather than to have an award\n\nwhich is muddled in form and implied in its content, which\n\ninevitably leads to wastage of time and resources of the parties to\n\nget clarity, and in some cases, frustrate the very reason for going for\n\nan arbitration.\n\n2. This appeal is filed against the final order and judgment dated\n\n27.04.2007, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nwhereby the High Court partly allowed the appeal filed by the\n\nSATISH KUMAR YADAV\n\nDate: 2019.12.18\n\n13:34:36 IST\n\nReason:\n\nrespondent and set aside the award of Arbitral Tribunal relating to\nclaim no. 2 for payment of compensation for the losses suffered due\n\nto unproductive use of machineries.\n\n3. Brief facts of the case are that a contract was entered into between\n\nDCM Shriram Aqua Foods Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘DCM’\n\nin short) and M/s. Crompton Greaves Limited (hereinafter referred\n\nto as “CGL” in short) for an aquaculture unit to be set up by such\n\nPrincipal, namely, DCM. CGL invited tenders for carrying out\n\ncertain works for construction of ponds, channels, drains and\n\nassociated works. The appellant M/s Dyna Technologies Pvt. Ltd.\n\ngave its proposal, estimate and quotation for carrying out the work.\n\nThereafter, the respondent CGL placed a letter of intent dated 25 th\n\nJuly, 1994, relevant portions of which are as under:\n\n“10. In the event that you are forced to keep your\nequipment and manpower idle due to non\navailability of work fronts due to reasons\nattributable to DCM or due to legal disturbances not\nconnected with you, you shall be compensated as\nfollows:\n\n(i) Maximum seven days of stoppage of work\nwithout any compensation.\n\n(ii) CGL reserves the right to advice you to\ndemobilize partially or fully in lieu of paying\ncompensation for such delays. Under such\ncircumstances, you shall be paid such\ncompensation towards transportation of\nequipment to Site at mutually agreed rates.\n\n(iii) Suitable time extension shall be given to\ncomplete the work to compensate the delay\ncaused due to the stoppage of work.\n\n11. Storage & Security: you will be responsible to\nprovide necessary stores, office and labour camps\nfor your staff at site. Only open area for\nconstruction of above will be given to you.\n\nElectricity will be provided at one point on\nchargeable basis at actuals. You will be responsible\nto tap the same to your required place.\n\nA format work order will be charged subsequently\nwhich will cover other General Terms and\nConditions. Labour rules, Workmen Compensation\netc. which may not be covered by this LOI and the\nsame shall also be part of this LOI.”\n\n4. The appellant made certain queries and clarifications, and by letter\n\ndated 10th October, 1994, CGL amended the contract as suggested\n\nby the appellant company. Thereafter, CGL issued work order on\n\n15th November, 1994 setting out the terms and conditions of the\n\nwork, material portions of which are stated as under:\n\n“2. Termination of contract:\n\nThe Company reserves the right to terminate this\nwork at any stage without payment of compensation\ndue to any of the following reasons:\n\na. If the original contract between the client and\nthe company is terminated/suspended.\nb. The company is unable to proceed with the\nwork due to reasons like non­availability of\nwork fronts, delay in availability of materials or\ndelay in receipt of payments from clients etc.\nc. If the contractor is not able to carry out work\nto the satisfaction of the company’s clients\nrepresentatives.\n\nd. If the contractor is unable to ensure adequate\nprogress as required by the company and their\npurchaser.\n\ne. Upon termination of this contract/work order,\nall rights and obligation of the parties, shall\ncease provided that the termination shall not\nrelieve the contractor of any of his obligations\nwhich may have accrued upto the date of\ntermination.\n\nUpon termination of this contract/work order due to\ndefault on the part of the contractor, he /it shall\nindemnify the company against all losses incurred\nby the company as a result of such termination.”\n\n5. After commencement of the work, the respondent CGL on 5 th\n\nJanuary, 1995 instructed the employees of the appellant company\n\nto stop the work.\n\n6. The appellant company claimed compensation for such premature\n\ntermination of the contract and ultimately the dispute was referred\n\nto Arbitral Tribunal consisting of three Arbitrators.\n\n7. The appellant­claimant made the following claims:­\n\n(1)Losses due to idle charges.\n(2)Losses due to unproductivity of the men and\nmachineries which could not work due to hindrances.\n(3)Loss of profit as the contract got dissolved and\n(4)Interest on the above claims and\n(5)Costs.\n\n8. The aforementioned claims are listed in the statement of claims\n\ntotalling to Rs. 54,21,170.45 initially on 21 st June, 1997 and\n\nrevised to Rs. 53,83,980.45 on 5 th July, 1997.\n\n9. The following is a summary of the final claims:­\n\n(1) Idle Charges for machineries and\ndemobilisation as approved by …Rs. 4,18,551.50\nRespondent\n(2)Losses due to unproductive use\nof machineries …Rs. 45,85,286.00\n(3)Loss of profit …Rs. 20,89,925.00\n(4)And (5) Interest and Costs … to be assessed\n\nRs. 70,93,763.33\nDeduct Payment already received Rs. 17,09,782.88\n_____________________\nBalance due Rs. 53,83,980.45\n+\nInterest and costs\n\n10. It may be relevant to note at this stage that so far as claim no.\n\n1 in reference to the losses due to idle charges is concerned, it was\nfinally settled amicably by the parties and the balance towards the\n\ninterest component also stands paid.\n\n11. So far as claim no. 3 in reference to loss of profit is concerned,\n\nthe same was disallowed by the Arbitral Tribunal and it was later\n\nnot questioned by the appellant­claimant and that attained finality.\n\n12. The only objection is in reference to claim no. 2, i.e., losses\n\ndue to unproductive use of machineries which was accepted by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal for a sum of Rs. 27,78,125/­ with interest @ 18%\n\np.a. vide its award dated 30th April, 1998 and Correction to award\n\ndated 5th May, 1998.\n\n13. Aggrieved by the award passed by the Tribunal, an original\n\npetition was filed before the learned Single Judge of the High Court\n\nof Judicature at Madras, questioning the award under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter “\nArbitration\n\nAct\n”), by the respondent. The learned Single Judge, while upholding\n\nthe award of the Tribunal, observed as under:\n\n“7. Thus the Arbitrators have given a specific\nfinding that the amount paid as compensation is\nactually the amount expended by the fourth\nrespondent and therefore the petitioner is liable\nto reimburse the loss sustained by the fourth\nrespondent. Therefore, this contention is also\nnot acceptable.\n\n…\n\n9. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner\ntook this court to various portions of the Award and\ntried to convince this Court that the Arbitrators\nhave not decided the issue fully appreciating the\nevidence on record.\nIn the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt reported in M/s\nSundarsan Trading Company\nv. Government of Kerala\n(AIR 1989 Supreme Court\n\n890) it has been clearly held that the power of the\nArbitrator in respect of the interpretation of the\ncontract in a matter for arbitration, the Arbitrator\ncan pass the Award by taking a particular view of\nthe contract and hence, the Court cannot substitute\nits own decision. Therefore, this Court cannot\nreappraise the evidence and substitutes its views\nand set aside the Award. Also in the case of\nTamil\nNadu Civil Supplies Corporation Limited v. Albert\nand Company\n(2000 (III) CTC 83), this Court has\nheld that as per\nSection 34\nof the Act, the Award of\nthe Arbitrator can be set aside only on the limited\ngrounds and the Award cannot be interfered with\nsimply because another view is possible on the\navailable materials. The arbitrator is a Judge of\nchoice of parties and this Court cannot set aside\nunless it suffers from error apparent on the face of\nthe record. It cannot be set aside even if the Court\ncan come to different conclusion on the same facts.\n\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has not\npointed out any such ground. It cannot also be said\nthat the Award is perverse or has error apparent on\nthe face of the record. Therefore, the Award passed\nby the Arbitrator is not illegal or invalid and cannot\nbe set aside. Therefore, the petition is dismissed.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n14. Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision of the learned Single\n\nJudge, the respondent appealed before the Division Bench in O.S.A\n\nNo. 234 of 2001. As aforementioned, the High Court vide impugned\n\norder partly allowed the appeal and set aside the award of the\n\nTribunal relating to claim no. 2. The High Court was of the opinion\n\nthat the award does not contain sufficient reasons and the\n\nstatements contained in paragraph 3.1 (a) to 3.1 (g) of the award\n\ndoes not provide any reasons, discussions or conclusion. The High\n\nCourt has observed in the following manner:\n\n“18. It is of course true that an Arbitrator cannot be\nexpected to write a detailed judgment as in a law\nCourt. However, the present Act contemplates that\nthe award of the Arbitrator should be supported by\nreason. The decision relied upon by the counsel for\nthe respondent, rendered on the basis of the\n\nArbitration Act, 1940\n, cannot be pressed into\nservice keeping in view the specific provision\ncontained in the Act. Moreover, even assuming that\nthe ratio of\nthe said decision\nis applicable, we\ncannot cull out any underlying reason in the award\nfor directing payment of compensation. The basis\nfor the right of the claimant and the basis of the\nliability of the present appellant have not been\nindicated anywhere within four corners of the award\nand in spite of the best efforts it is not possible to\ndiscover even any latent reason in the award.\n\n19. It was also contended that the discussion in\npara 3.1(g) of the award contains the basis and\nreason given by the Tribunal.\n\nWe have carefully gone through such\nparagraph as well as the preceding and subsequent\nparagraphs. In our considered opinion, the\nstatements recited in para 3.1 including para 3.1(g)\nare only substance of the submissions/claim made\nby the claimant and para 3.1(g) cannot be\nconstrued as a conclusion or even the reasoning\ngiven by the Tribunal.”\n\n15. Having come to a conclusion that the arbitral award was\n\ndeficient due to the lack of reasoning, the High Court proceeded\n\nfurther to note that the option of\nSection 34 (4)\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct was not necessary as the compensation could not have been\n\nclaimed considering the fact that the work order has provision\n\nbarring claim no. 2, in the following manner:\n\n“20. Learned counsel for the respondent has relied\nupon\nSection 34(4)\nof the Arbitration Act and has\nsubmitted that in case if this Court finds that the\nArbitral Tribunal has not given reason, even though\nit is so required under\nSection 31(3)\nby invoking\njurisdiction under\nSection 31(4)\n, this Court can give\nopportunity to the Arbitral Tribunal to resume the\narbitral proceedings or to take action as in the\nopinion of the Arbitral Tribunal would eliminate the\ngrounds for setting aside the arbitral award.\n\n21. We do not think that the present case is a fit\ncase where the Arbitral Tribunal can be called upon\nto give reasons in support of its conclusion. This is\nbecause, in our considered opinion, the terms of the\ncontract clearly exclude the possibility of payment\nof any compensation on account of premature\ntermination of the contract as envisaged in para C.\n2(a).”\n\n16. Thereafter, the High Court proceeded further to note that the\n\narbitral proceeding was beyond the competence of the Tribunal by\n\nconsidering the conditions under the work order.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal comprising of three Arbitrators has looked into the entire\n\nmaterial available on record and recorded a finding in reference to\n\nclaim no. 2 (losses suffered due to unproductive use of machineries)\n\nbased on the case set up by the parties taking note of\nSection 73\nof\n\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872 (hereinafter “\nContract Act\n”) and\n\nrelying on the evidence including appraisal of the log books\n\napproved by the respondent and held that actual losses/expenses\n\nwere incurred by the appellant. In the given circumstances it was\n\nnot open for the High Court in appeal to reappraise and substitute\nits own view in contravention of the clause of the agreement\n\npursuant to which the arbitral dispute was raised and a finding\n\ncame to be recorded in acceptance of the claim with regard to the\n\nlosses suffered by the appellant due to unproductive use of\n\nmachineries and the interference made by the High Court is beyond\n\nthe scope of\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n18. Learned counsel further submits that the Division Bench of\n\nthe High Court did not hold that the evidence relied upon by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal, i.e., the log books were not proper or were lacking\n\nquality. As a matter of fact, there was no challenge to the same in\n\nthe appeal filed by the respondent under\nSection 37\nof the\n\nArbitration Act and only the liability was questioned. The learned\n\ncounsel further submitted that the only submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent before the Arbitral Tribunal and also\n\nbefore the learned Single Judge of the High Court was that there\n\nwas no provision under the contract granting compensation for loss\n\nincurred for unproductive use of machinery and that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction. This issue was examined by\n\nthe Tribunal and confirmed by the Single Judge of the High Court,\nafter examining the objections raised by the respondent under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act. The learned counsel for the\n\nappellant contented that interference at the appellate stage is\n\nbeyond the scope of\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act and in the\n\ngiven circumstances, claim no. 2 which has been set aside by the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court under the impugned judgment\n\ndeserves to be interfered by this Court.\n\n19. Learned counsel also submits that\nSection 73\nof the Contract\n\nAct confers a right which is for public interest/benefit and\n\ncontractual clause, if any, which takes away such a right\n\nunilaterally of a party is violative of\nSection 23\nof the Contract Act.\n\nThe law which is made for an individual’s benefit can be waived by\n\nonly by such individual, however, where law is for public interest or\n\nhas policy element, then such rights cannot be waived by an\n\nindividual person inasmuch as such rights are a matter of public\n\npolicy/public interest.\n\n20. Learned counsel further submits that a contractual provision\n\nwhich is in contravention of a specific statutory provision, if\n\nallowed to be implemented, the same will result in frustration of a\nright conferred by law or if the contractual clause is immoral or\n\nopposed to public policy, in such cases the contractual clause is\n\ninvalid and void ab initio and cannot be enforced to disentitle\n\nappellant in claiming the actual loss which has been suffered by it\n\nand established before the Arbitral Tribunal and which the\n\nrespondent is under an obligation to reimburse. In the given\n\ncircumstances, claim no. 2 which has been set aside by the High\n\nCourt needs interference by this Court. The learned counsel in\n\nsupport has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in K.N.\n\nSathyapalan (Dead) by Lrs. v. State of Kerala, (2007) 13 SCC\n\n43.\n\n21. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent, while\n\nsupporting the findings recorded by the High Court in the\n\nimpugned judgment, submits that the claim which has been\n\ndisallowed by the High Court in the impugned judgment is basically\n\na claim for payment of compensation or damages on account of\n\npremature termination of contract and neither the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nnor the learned Single Judge of the High Court has\n\nconsidered/examined the terms of the contract in appreciating the\nright of the claimant to claim compensation of damages and the\n\ncorresponding liability of the respondent to pay/settle the claim.\n\nAccording to him, as per the terms of contract, no such\n\ncompensation was payable.\n\n22. Learned counsel further submits that it is well settled that the\n\nArbitral Tribunal cannot travel beyond the terms of contract to\n\naward compensation. As a matter of fact, in the present case, the\n\nterms of contract expressly prohibit that no compensation is\n\npayable if the contract is terminated on account of termination of\n\nthe project. In the face of such express prohibition, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction and committed a manifest\n\nerror in directing the payment of compensation even without\n\ndisclosing the basis of arriving at such a conclusion.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that\nSection 34(2)\n\n(a)(iv) of the\nArbitration Act\nclearly envisages that such an award\n\ncan be set aside if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated\n\nby or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration.\n\nWhen there is a specific exclusion/prohibition in the contract, it\n\nwas not open for the Tribunal to travel beyond the terms of contract\nin passing an award which has been taken note of by the Division\n\nBench of the High Court in the impugned judgment and has been\n\nrightly set aside, supported by cogent reasons. The learned counsel\n\nfurther submitted that what has been observed by the Division\n\nBench of the High Court in the impugned judgment is based on\n\nsettled principles of law and needs no interference.\n\n24. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their\n\nassistance perused the material available on record.\n\n25. Before we devolve into the contractual issues, we need to\n\nobserve certain pointers on the jurisdiction of the court under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\nSection 34\nas it stood before the\n\nAmendment Act of 2015, was as follows­\n\n“34 Application for setting aside arbitral award. —\n(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award\nmay be made only by an application for setting aside\nsuch award in accordance with sub­section (2) and\nsub­section (3).\n\n(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court\nonly if—\n\n(a) the party making the application furnishes proof\nthat—\n\n(i) a party was under some incapacity, or\n(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the\nlaw to which the parties have subjected it or, failing\nany indication thereon, under the law for the time\nbeing in force; or\n\n(iii) the party making the application was not given\nproper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or\nof the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to\npresent his case; or\n\n(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not\ncontemplated by or not falling within the terms of the\nsubmission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on\nmatters beyond the scope of the submission to\narbitration:\n\nProvided that, if the decisions on matters submitted\nto arbitration can be separated from those not so\nsubmitted, only that part of the arbitral award which\ncontains decisions on matters not submitted to\narbitration may be set aside; or\n\n(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the\narbitral procedure was not in accordance with the\nagreement of the parties, unless such agreement was\nin conflict with a provision of this Part from which\nthe parties cannot derogate, or, failing such\nagreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or\n\n(b) the Court finds that—\n\n(i) the subject­matter of the dispute is not capable\nof settlement by arbitration under the law for the\ntime being in force, or\n\n(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public\npolicy of India.\n\nExplanation. —Without prejudice to the generality of\nsub­clause (ii) it is hereby declared, for the avoidance\nof any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the\npublic policy of India if the making of the award was\ninduced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in\nviolation of section 75 or section 81.\n\n(3) An application for setting aside may not be\nmade after three months have elapsed from the date\non which the party making that application had\nreceived the arbitral award or, if a request had been\nmade under\nsection 33\n, from the date on which that\nrequest had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:\n\nProvided that if the Court is satisfied that the\napplicant was prevented by sufficient cause from\nmaking the application within the said period of three\nmonths it may entertain the application within a\nfurther period of thirty days, but not thereafter.\n\n(4) On receipt of an application under sub­section (1),\nthe Court may, where it is appropriate and it is so\nrequested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a\nperiod of time determined by it in order to give the\narbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the\narbitral proceedings or to take such other action as\nin the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the\ngrounds for setting aside the arbitral award.\n\n26. There is no dispute that\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nlimits a challenge to an award only on the grounds provided therein\n\nor as interpreted by various Courts. We need to be cognizant of the\n\nfact that arbitral awards should not be interfered with in a casual\n\nand cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a conclusion that\n\nthe perversity of the award goes to the root of the matter without\nthere being a possibility of alternative interpretation which may\n\nsustain the arbitral award.\nSection 34\nis different in its approach\n\nand cannot be equated with a normal appellate jurisdiction. The\n\nmandate under\nSection 34\nis to respect the finality of the arbitral\n\naward and the party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by\n\nan alternative forum as provided under the law. If the Courts were\n\nto interfere with the arbitral award in the usual course on factual\n\naspects, then the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate\n\ndispute resolution would stand frustrated.\n\n27. Moreover, umpteen number of judgments of this Court have\n\ncategorically held that the Courts should not interfere with an\n\naward merely because an alternative view on facts and\n\ninterpretation of contract exists. The Courts need to be cautious\n\nand should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if\n\nthe reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such award\n\nportrays perversity unpardonable under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration Act.\n\n28. Having established the basic jurisprudence behind\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration Act, we must focus on the analysis of the case.\nThe primary contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the appellant is that the award by the learned Tribunal was\n\nperverse for want of reasons. The necessity of providing reasons has\n\nbeen provided under\nSection 31\nof the Arbitration Act, which reads\n\nas under:\n\n“31. Form and contents of arbitral award.­\n…\n(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons\nupon which it is based, unless—\n\n(a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be\ngiven, or\n\n(b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms\nunder\nsection 30\n.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nUnder the UNCITRAL Model Law the aforesaid provision is provided\n\nas under:\n\n“(2) The award shall state the reasons upon which it\nis based, unless the parties have agreed that no\nreasons are to be given or the award is an award on\nagreed terms under article 30.”\n\n29. Similar to the position under the Model Law, India also adopts\n\na default rule to provide for reasons unless the parties agree\notherwise. As with most countries like England, America and Model\n\nLaw, Indian law recognizes enforcement of the reasonless award if it\n\nhas been so agreed between the parties.\n\n30. There is no gainsaying that arbitration proceedings are not per\n\nse comparable to judicial proceedings before the Court. A party\n\nunder Indian Arbitration Law can opt for an arbitration before any\n\nperson, even those who do not have prior legal experience as well.\n\nIn this regard, we need to understand that the intention of the\n\nlegislature to provide for a default rule, should be given rational\n\nmeaning in light of commercial wisdom inherent in the choice of\n\narbitration.\n\n31. A five­Judge Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of\n\nRaipur Development Authority v. Chokhamal Contractors\n, AIR\n\n1990 SC 1426, considered the scope of\nSection 30\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct, 1940 and held as under:\n“It is now well settled that an award can neither be\nremitted nor set aside merely on the ground that it\ndoes not contain reasons in support of the\nconclusion or decisions reached in it except where\nthe arbitration agreement or the deed of submission\nrequires him to give reasons. The arbitrator or\numpire is under no obligation to give reasons in\nsupport of the decision reached by him unless\nunder the arbitration agreement or in the deed of\nsubmission he is required to give such reasons and\nif the arbitrator or umpire chooses to give reasons in\nsupport of his decision it is open to the Court to set\naside the award if it finds that an error of law has\nbeen committed by the arbitrator or umpire on the\nface of the record on going through such reasons.\nThe arbitrator or umpire shall have to give reasons\nalso where the court has directed in any order such\nas the one made Under\nSection 20\nor\nSection 21\nor\n\nSection 34\nof the Act that reasons should be given\nor where the statute which governs an arbitration\nrequires him to do so.”\n\n32. A three­Judge Bench of this Court in another case of\nS.\n\nHarcharan Singh v. Union of India\n, (1990) 4 SCC 647, reiterated\n\nits earlier view that the arbitrator's adjudication is generally\n\nconsidered binding between the parties for he is a Tribunal selected\n\nby the parties and the power of the Court to set aside the award is\n\nrestricted to cases set out in\nSection 30\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940.\n33. However, the ratio of\nChokhamal\ncase (supra) has not found\n\nfavour of the Legislature, and accordingly\nSection 31(3)\nhas been\n\nenacted in the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\nThis Court in\nSom Datt Builders\n\nLtd. v. State of Kerala\n, (2009) 4 ARB LR 13 SC, a Division Bench\n\nof this Court has indicated that passing of a reasoned award is not\n\nan empty formulation under the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\n34. It may be relevant to note Russell on Arbitration, 23rd edn.\n\n(2007), wherein he notes that:\n\n“If the Court can deduce from the award and the\nmaterials before it, which may include extracts from\nevidence and the transcript of hearing, the thrust of\nthe tribunal’s reasoning then no irregularity will be\nfound….Equally, the court should bear in mind\nthat when considering awards produced by non­\nlawyer arbitrators, the court should look at the\nsubstance of such findings, rather than their\nform, and that one should approch a reading of\nthe award in a fair, and not in an unduly literal\nway.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n35. The mandate under\nSection 31(3)\nof the Arbitration Act is to\n\nhave reasoning which is intelligible and adequate and, which can in\nappropriate cases be even implied by the Courts from a fair reading\n\nof the award and documents referred to thereunder, if the need be.\n\nThe aforesaid provision does not require an elaborate judgment to\n\nbe passed by the arbitrators having regards to the speedy resolution\n\nof dispute.\n\n36. When we consider the requirement of a reasoned order three\n\ncharacteristics of a reasoned order can be fathomed. They are:\n\nproper, intelligible and adequate. If the reasoning in the order are\n\nimproper, they reveal a flaw in the decision­making process. If the\n\nchallenge to an award is based on impropriety or perversity in the\n\nreasoning, then it can be challenged strictly on the grounds\n\nprovided under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act. If the challenge to\n\nan award is based on the ground that the same is unintelligible, the\n\nsame would be equivalent of providing no reasons at all. Coming to\n\nthe last aspect concerning the challenge on adequacy of reasons,\n\nthe Court while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 34\nhas to\n\nadjudicate the validity of such an award based on the degree of\n\nparticularity of reasoning required having regard to the nature of\nissues falling for consideration. The degree of particularity cannot\n\nbe stated in a precise manner as the same would depend on the\n\ncomplexity of the issue. Even if the Court comes to a conclusion\n\nthat there were gaps in the reasoning for the conclusions reached\n\nby the Tribunal, the Court needs to have regard to the documents\n\nsubmitted by the parties and the contentions raised before the\n\nTribunal so that awards with inadequate reasons are not set aside\n\nin casual and cavalier manner. On the other hand, ordinarily\n\nunintelligible awards are to be set aside, subject to party autonomy\n\nto do away with the reasoned award. Therefore, the courts are\n\nrequired to be careful while distinguishing between inadequacy of\n\nreasons in an award and unintelligible awards.\n\n37. At this juncture it must be noted that the legislative intention\n\nof providing\nSection 34 (4)\nin the\nArbitration Act\nwas to make the\n\naward enforceable, after giving an opportunity to the Tribunal to\n\nundo the curable defects. This provision cannot be brushed aside\n\nand the High Court could not have proceeded further to determine\n\nthe issue on merits.\n38. In case of absence of reasoning the utility has been provided\n\nunder of\nSection 34(4)\nof the Arbitration Act to cure such defects.\n\nWhen there is complete perversity in the reasoning then only it can\n\nbe challenged under the provisions of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\n\nAct. The power vested under\nSection 34 (4)\nof the Arbitration Act to\n\ncure defects can be utilized in cases where the arbitral award does\n\nnot provide any reasoning or if the award has some gap in the\n\nreasoning or otherwise and that can be cured so as to avoid a\n\nchallenge based on the aforesaid curable defects under\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration Act. However, in this case such remand to the\n\nTribunal would not be beneficial as this case has taken more than\n\n25 years for its adjudication. It is in this state of affairs that we\n\nlament that the purpose of arbitration as an effective and\n\nexpeditious forum itself stands effaced.\n\n39. It may be noted that when the High Court concluded that\n\nthere was no reasoned award, then the award ceased to exist and\n\nthe Court was functus officio under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nfor hearing the challenge to the award under the provisions of\n\nSection 34\nand come to a conclusion that the arbitration award was\nnot in terms of the agreement. In such case, the High Court ought\n\nto have considered remanding the matter to the Tribunal in the\n\nusual course. However, the High Court analyzed the case on merits,\n\nbut, for different reasons and we need not go into the validity of\n\nHigh Court’s interference.\n\n40. Coming back to the award, we need to see whether the award\n\nof the Arbitral Tribunal can be sustained in the instant case.\n\nAlthough the Arbitral Tribunal has dealt with the claims separately\n\nunder different sub­headings, the award is confusing and has\n\njumbled the contentions, facts and reasoning, without appropriate\n\ndistinction. The Tribunal rendered the award with narration of facts\n\nwith references to the annexures wherever it relied upon by it. The\n\nTribunal abruptly concluded at the end of the factual narration,\n\nwithout providing any reasons, in the following manner:\n\n“(3) Claim for unproductive usage of machineries\n….\n\n(g) All the above facts clearly establish that the\nmachineries deployed by the Claimant had to do\nunproductive work by shifting from one place to\nanother to suit the availability of work.The\ncontract contemplates only payment for actual\nturnover of earthwork and for this they had\nreceived amount totaling to Rs. 1709782.88. The\nClaimant claims that the hire charges paid to the\nmachineries, men and engineers should be\nreimbursed to him. He has given the actual\nexpenses in his claim statement.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n41. Interestingly, the factual narration is coupled with the\n\nclaimant’s argument, which is bundled together. A close reading of\n\nthe same is required to separate the same wherein the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has mixed the arguments with the premise it intended to\n\nrely upon for the claimant’s claim. Further, it has reduced the\n\nreasons for respondent’s defense. In spite of our independent\n\napplication of mind based on the documents relied upon, but\n\ncannot sustain the award in its existing form as there is a\n\nrequirement of legal reasoning to supplement such conclusion. In\n\nthis context, the complexity of the subject matter stops us from\n\nsupplementing such legal reasoning and we cannot sustain the\n\naforesaid award as being reasoned.\n\n42. It may be beneficial to reduce the concluding paragraph of the\n\naward, which reads as under:\n\n“3.4. The above arguments and various authorities\nquoted by them have been studied by the Tribunal\nand we are convinced that the compensation is\npayable on the hire charges and expenses incurred\nby the claimant based on the claims made by him in\nJune 95 and now submitted by the claimant in his\nrevised claim petition on 05.07.1997. We are\nconvinced that the machineries have been\nactually mobilized from the letter R­3, R­8 and\nR­10 issued by DCM reporting on the number of\nmachineries deployed by Claimant. The\nClaimants have produced the log books and bills for\nthe various machineries and modified their claims.\nThe tribunal had perused the log books and idle\nwages approved in C­7 by Respondent and the\nclaims made in R­17.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n43. From the facts, we can only state that from a perusal of the\n\naward, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it has been\n\nrendered without reasons. However, the muddled and confused\n\nform of the award has invited the High Court to state that the\n\narbitrator has merely restated the contentions of both parties. From\n\na perusal of the award, the inadequate reasoning and basing the\n\naward on the approval of the respondent herein cannot be stated to\n\nbe appropriate considering the complexity of the issue involved\n\nherein, and accordingly the award is unintelligible and cannot be\n\nsustained.\n44. In any case, the litigation has been protracted for more than\n\n25 years, without any end for the parties. In totality of the matter,\n\nwe consider it appropriate to direct the respondents to pay a sum of\n\nRs. 30,00,000/­ (Rupees Thirty Lakhs only) to the appellant in full\n\nand final settlement against claim No. 2 within a period of 8 weeks,\n\nfailing which the appellant will be entitled to interest at 12% per\n\nannum until payment, for providing quietus to the litigation.\n\n45. In view of the conclusions reached, the appeal is disposed of to\n\nthe extent indicated herein. There shall be no orders as to the costs.\n\n..............................................J.\n(N.V.
