Arora, Advocate.\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -2-\n\nMr. Puneet Gupta, Addl. A.G., Punjab.\n\n***\n\nPERMOD KOHLI.J (ORAL)\n\nIn view of the identical facts and common questions of law,\n\nthese petitions are being disposed of by this common order.\n\nAll the petitioners are working in the Education Department of\n\nthe State of Punjab. Petitioners in CWP Nos. 17450 of 2010 and 16723 of\n\n2010 are working as Head Masters, whereas all other petitioners are\n\nworking as Lecturers in different disciplines. All the petitioners are\n\naggrieved of their non-promotion to the post of Principal. In some of the\n\ncases the claims of the petitioners have been rejected/ignored solely on the\n\nground that they did not achieve the minimum required bench marks for\n\npromotion to the post of Principal. It is admitted case of the parties that\n\npersons junior to the petitioners from the cadre of Head Masters as also\n\nLecturer have been promoted to the post of Principal, hence, the grievance\n\nof the petitioners in these petitions.\n\nSince the legal issues predominantly decide the controversy in\n\nthese petitions, hence the facts of each case are not being dealt with in\n\ndetails.\n\nIndisputed facts are that there are more than 1500 sanctioned\n\nposts of Principals in Govt. Schools in the State of Punjab and hundred of\n\nposts are lying vacant, some even for a decade. The State-respondent had\n\nearlier expressed its inability to make promotions in view of some directions\n\nfrom this Court for a considerable period. Later the State was permitted to\n\nmake promotions.\n\nPromotion to the post of Principal is governed and regulated by\n\nthe statutory rules framed under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -3-\n\nof India namely Punjab Education Service (School & Inspection) Group-A\n\nService Rules, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the 2004 Rules). These rules\n\nwere notified vide notification dated 22.12.2004. Rule 5 deals with the\n\nmethod of appointment etc. and reads as under:-\n\n\"5. Method of appointment, qualifications and experience-\n\n(1) Appointment to a post in the service shall be made in the manner as\n\nspecified against that post in Appendix 'B'.\n\nProvided that if, no suitable candidate is available for\n\nappointment by promotion and by direct appointment, then appointment to\n\nthe Service shall be made by transfer of a person holding a similar or an\n\nidentical post under a State Govt. of Govt. of India.\n\n(2) No person shall be appointed to a post in the service unless\n\nhe possesses the qualifications and experience as specified against that post\n\nin Appendix 'B'.\n\n(3) Appointment to the service by promotion shall be made on\n\nseniority-cum-merit basis, but no person shall have any right to claim\n\npromotion on the basis of seniority alone:\n\nProvided that promotion to the post of Director shall be made\n\non merit-cum-seniority basis.\"\n\nThe post of Principal is one of the posts borne on the cadre of\n\nthe 2004 Rules. By virtue of sub rule (2) of Rule 5, appointment to a post in\n\nthe service is to be made in accordance with the qualifications and\n\nexperience as specified against that post in Appendix 'B'. Post of Principal\n\nfinds mention at Sr. No.3 of Appendix 'B' and is equivalent to some other\n\nposts of the service. These posts are to be filled up 100% by promotion\n\nfrom three feeding channels. Relevant extract from Appendix 'B' is\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -4-\n\nreproduced hereunder:-\n\nSr. Designation of the post Percentage for Qualification\nNo. appointment and\nby experience for\nappointment\nby\nDirect Promotion Direct Promotion\nappointment appoint\nment.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n3 District Education Officer - Hundred percent - (a) Fifty-five\n(Secondary Education), percent from\nDistrict Education Officer amongst the\n(Elementary Education), Lecturers,\nPrincipal, District Institute of working under\nEducation and Training, the control of\nPrincipal, Secondary Schools, the Director\nAssistant Director, Evaluation who have an\nOfficer, Subject Matter Expert experience of\n(State Council of Education working as\nResearch & Training), Survey such for a\nOfficer, Deputy Circle minimum\nEducation Officer, Deputy period of\nDistrict Education Officer, seven years;\nDistrict Science Supervisor,\n(b) Thirty\nSenior Lecturer, Senior\npercent from\nGuidance Counsellor,\namongst the\nAgricultural Advisor, Co-\nHead\nordinator (Population\nMasters/Mistr\nEducation), Officer on Special\nesses, working\nDuty (Works and Planning),\nunder the\nOfficer on Special Duty\ncontrol of the\n(Scholarship) and Co-\nDirector, who\nordinator.\nhave an\nexperience of\nworking as\nsuch for a\nminimum\nperiod of\nseven years;\nand\n(c) Fifteeen\npercent from\namongst the\nVocational\nLecturers/\nMasters/\nMistresses,\nworking under\nthe control of\nthe Director,\nwho have an\nexperience of\nworking as\nsuch for a\nminimum\nperiod of\nseven years.\n\nFor purposes of the present petitions only two channels of\n\npromotion are relevant i.e. Lecturer and Head Master/Mistress. 55% of\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -5-\n\npromotional posts of Principal are to be filled up from amongst the\n\nLecturers working under the control of the Director, who have an\n\nexperience of working as such for a minimum period of 7 years, whereas\n\n35% of such posts are required to be filled up from amongst the Head\n\nMasters/Mistresses with experience for a minimum period of 7 years.\n\nAll the petitioners are eligible for such promotion being\n\npossessed of requisite experience. They are also under the zone of\n\nconsideration on the basis of their seniority as admittedly persons junior to\n\nthem have been promoted to the post of Principal. The petitioners have\n\nbeen denied promotion only on the ground of not achieving the minimum\n\nbench marks as prescribed under the Govt. Instructions dated 6.9.2001\n\n(Annexure P-14) in CWP No.17450 of 2010. The relevant Govt.\n\nInstructions are relied upon by the respondents in the reply filed in CWP\n\nNos. 12225, 12903 and 13027 of 2010. These instructions relate to setting\n\nup of departmental promotion committees for considering cases of\n\npromotion to Class-I and Class-II posts (now Group A and Group B posts).\n\nThe extract relevant for purposes of the present petitions is reproduced\n\nhereunder:-\n\n\" (c) It has been decided to retain the numbering systems of\nevaluation of A.C.Rs as contained in the instructions dated 29.12.2000\nwhich is as under:-\n\nOutstanding : 4 marks\n'Very Good' : 3 marks\n'Good' : 2 marks\n'Average' : 1 mark\n\nA.C.Rs for the last 5 years are to be taken into consideration for\npromotion. The criteria for promotions will be as under:-\n\n1. The case pertaining to the promotion of Head of Departments\nwould be decided strictly on the basis of merit-cum-seniority.\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -6-\n\nThe minimum marks for promotion for such posts would be\n'very good'. The marking system adopted earlier in instructions\ndated the 29th 2000 would be followed and a minimum of 15\nmarks, would be required to be considered as Very Good. The\nOfficer who is graded as outstanding would supersede the\nofficer graded as Very Good.\n\n2. For promotion to posts falling in Group 'A' other than Head of\nDepartments the minimum bench mark will be very good with\nat least 12 marks. Amongst those meetings this criteria, there\nwould be no supersession.\n\n3. In the case of promotion to posts falling in Group 'B' the\nminimum bench mark will be 'Good' and there would be no\nsupersession i.e. Promotions would be made strictly on\nseniority-cum-merit.\n\n4. For making promotion in all the categories there should not be\nany adverse remarks in the A.C.Rs under consideration.\n\n2. As a consequence of this decision of the Govt. the appropriate\nchanges in the Punjab Civil Services (General and Common Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1994 would be made separately.\n\n3. These instructions would be applicable prospectively.\"\n\nApart from the above instructions, respondents have heavily\n\nrelied upon the Punjab Civil Services (General & Common Conditions of\n\nService) Rules 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the 1994 Rules) in particular\n\nreference to Rules 18 and 20 thereof. Rules 18 and 20 relied upon by the\n\nrespondents are reproduced hereunder:-\n\n\" 18. Promotion to Group A and Group B services-(1) (a) For\npromotion to the post as Head of Department would be decided\nstrictly on the basis of merit-cum-seniority as per the\ninstructions issued by the Govt. from time to time. The\nminimum bench mark for promotion for such post would be\n'Very Good'. The officer who is graded as 'Outstanding' would\nsupersede the officer graded as 'Very Good'.\n\n(b) For promotion to post falling in Group 'A' other than\nHead of Department the minimum bench mark will be 'Very\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -7-\n\nGood' as per the instructions issued by the Govt. from time to\ntime. There shall be no supersession on the basis of merit.\n\n(c) For promotion to post falling in Group 'B' the minimum\nbench mark will be 'Good' and there shall be no supersession on\nthe basis of merit.\n\nRule 20 reads as under:-\n\n\"20. Over riding effect- The provisions of these rules shall\nhave effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any rules\nfor the time being in force for regulating the recruitment and conditions of\nservice for appointment to public service and posts in connection with the\naffairs of the state.\"\n\nThe short grievance of the petitioners in these petitions is that\n\nthe service conditions of the petitioners are regulated by the 2004 Rules.\n\nSub Rule (3) of Rule 5 provides for appointment to the service by\n\npromotion by adopting the rule of seniority-cum-merit, though, seniority\n\nalone cannot be basis for promotion. Based upon aforesaid provision, it is\n\ncontended that the petitioners are entitled to promotion on the basis of their\n\nseniority except disqualification on account of any adverse entries or\n\ndisciplinary proceedings etc. It is further submitted that introduction of the\n\nminimum bench marks for promotion by virtue of Govt. Instructions dated\n\n6.9.2001 is totally illegal and amounts to supplanting the statutory rules. By\n\napplying the instructions the rule of seniority-cum-merit has been changed\n\nto merit-cum-seniority, which is impermissible in law. In support of their\n\ncontention, the petitioners have relied upon a judgement of this Court\n\nreported as 2010(2) RSJ 19 titled as Ravi Dutt Mehra (Dr.) Vs. State of\n\nPunjab & others, wherein the implication of same very Govt. Instructions\n\ndated 6.9.2001 was considered. Relevant observations are as under:-\n\n\"6. The statutory rules i.e. Ayurvedic (Group 'A') Service\nRules, 2008 clearly provides for promotion to be made on the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit. Petitioner's seniority over and above respondent no.5\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -8-\n\nis not in dispute. The expression \"Seniority-cum-merit\" has been\nconsidered and interpreted by various judicial pronouncements.\nIn the\ncase of\nHaryana State Electricity Development Corpn. Ltd. Vs. Rameshwar\nDass\n, 2001 (4) SCT 328, it has been held that the junior person cannot be\npromoted unless something is shown adverse to senior or disciplinary\nproceedings are pending against him. The seniority cannot be ignored\napplying the aforesaid principle. It is equally settled proposition of law\nthat once the recruitment is regulated by statutory rules and procedure, the\ncriteria of qualification is prescribed therein and administrative\ninstructions to the extent the statutory rules are altered/modified or made\nredundant cannot be taken into consideration. Admittedly, there was\nnothing adverse against the petitioner nor any disciplinary or criminal or\nother kind of proceedings were pending against him at the time of\nconsideration for his promotion to the post in question. The Govt.\ninstructions dated 6.9.2110 does not in any manner take away the right of\nthe petitioner for consideration for promotion on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit. If the contention of the respondents regarding the so-called\nbenchmark is accepted then it amounts to changing the principle/rule from\n\"Seniority-cum-merit to Merit-cum-seniority\". Such a recourse is\nimpermissible in law.\"\n\nThe petitioners have also referred to the latest judgement of\n\nHon'ble Apex Court reported as 2011(3) SCC 422 titled as\nHaryana State\n\nWarehousing Corporation and others Vs. Jagat Ram and another\n. In\n\nthe aforesaid judgement the Hon'ble Supreme Court examined the similar\n\nissue of promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, where an identical\n\nprovision i.e. Regulation 8(2) framed by the Haryana State Warehousing\n\nCorporation (Officers & Staff) Regulations, 1994 which is similar to Rule 5\n\n(3) of the above service rules came up for consideration. Regulation 8(2)\n\nreads as under:-\n\n\" 8(2). All promotions unless otherwise provided, shall be\nmade on seniority-cum-merit basis and seniority alone shall not confer any\nright to such promotions.\"\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -9-\n\nInterpreting the aforesaid regulation the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nwhile following earlier judgements titled as\nState of Mysore Vs. Syed\n\nMahmood\n, reported as\nAIR 1968 SC 1113, B.V. Sivaiah and others Vs.\n\nK. Addanki Babu and others\nreported as 1998 (\n6) SCC 720,\n\nK.Samantaray Vs. National Insurance Company Ltd.\nreported as 2004\n\n(9) SCC 286, Sant Ram Sharma Vs. State of Rajasthan reported as\nAIR\n\n1967 SC 1910, Hargovind Yadav Vs. Reva Sidhi Gramin Bank\nreported\n\nas 2006 (6) SCC 145 held as under:-\n\n\" There is nothing on record to indicate that Jagat Ram was\nnot capable of discharging his functions in the promoted post of Assistant\nManager (Administration). He was denied promotion only on the ground of\nthe superior assessment that had been made in favour of Ram Kumar,\nwhich, in our view, runs contrary to the concept of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nControverting the contentions raised on behalf of the\n\npetitioners, the State has relied upon amended Rule 18 of the 1994 Rules.\n\nReliance is placed upon Clause B of Rule 18 introduced vide amendment\n\nnotification dated 18.12.2001, however, this amended rule was made\n\napplicable w.e.f. 6.9.2001. Clause B of Rule 18 deals with the promotion to\n\nthe posts falling in Group-A other than Head of the Department. By virtue\n\nof the amended Rule 18 the concept of minimum bench marks was\n\nintroduced for promotion to Group-A posts other than the Head of\n\nDepartment and the minimum bench mark provided was 'Very Good' as per\n\nthe Govt. Instructions issued by the Govt. from time to time. The Rule\n\nfurther provides that there will be no supersession on the basis of merit.\n\nThe purpose for introduction of amendment in Rule 18 retrospectively from\n\n6.9.2001 is to adopt the Govt. Instructions dated 6.9.2001, earlier issued by\n\nthe Govt., whereby the concept of minimum bench mark was\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -10-\n\nintroduced without any statutory backing. Rule 6 of 1994 Rules which is\n\nalso relevant, is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n\"6. Qualifications etc.- Subject to the provisions of these rules,\nthe number and character of posts, method of recruitment and educational\nqualifications and experience for appointment to a post or posts in a Service\nand the departmental examination, if any, shall be such as may be specified\nin the Service Rules made for that service.\n\nOriginal rules were amended vide Notifications No. G.S.R.\n115/Const./Art.309/Amd.(6) 2001 and No.G.S.R.117/Const./Art.309/Amd.\n(7)/2001. Vide these notifications, following amendments have been\nintroduced:-\n\n\"The 18th December, 2001\nNO.G.S.R.115/Const./Art.309/Amd. (6)2001.\n\n2. In the preamble of the Punjab Civil Services (General\nand Common Conditions of Service ) Rules, 1994 for the figures, sign and\nwords \"Class I, Class II and Class III, the sign and words \"Group 'A', Group\n'B' and Group 'C' shall be substituted.\n\nThe 18th December, 2001\nNo.G.S.R.117/Const./Art.309/Amd. (7)/2001)\n\n(ii) They shall be deemed to have come into force on and\n\nwith effect from the 6th day of September, 2001.\"\n\nThis rule clearly provides that character of post, method of\n\nrecruitment and educational qualifications and experience for appointment\n\nto a post in a service etc. shall be as may be specified in the service rules.\n\nThe service rules further defined in 1994 Rules means a Class-I, Class-II\n\nand Class-III service constituted in connection with the affairs of the State\n\nunder Rule 2(g) of 1994 Rules. However, the application of service rules is\n\nagain made subject to the provisions of 1994 Rules as Rule 6 starts with the\n\nexpression \"subject to the provisions of these rules\". This means that even\n\nin the matter of qualification, experience and method of recruitment as may\n\nbe provided in the service rules will again be subject to the 1994 Rules.\nIn\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -11-\n\naddition to Rules 6 and 18\n,\nreferred to above\n, Rule 20 further gives\n\noverriding effect to 1994 Rules in respect to the recruitment and conditions\n\nof service for appointment to public service.\n\nIt is also noticed that Rule 8 of the 2004 Rules further makes\n\n1994 Rules applicable to the extent not specifically provided for in the\n\nservice rules. Rule 8 reads as under:-\n\n\"8. Application of the Punjab Civil Services (General and\nCommon Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994-(1) In respect of the matters,\nwhich are not specifically provided in these rules, the members of the\nservice shall be governed by the provisions of the Punjab Civil Services\n(General & Common Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 as amended from\ntime to time.\"\n\nThus, from the conjoint reading of Rules 6, 18 and 20 of the\n\n1994 Rules and Rule 8 of 2004 Rules, it appears that in all those matters,\n\nwhere there is no provision in the service rules of 2004 and there is any\n\nspecific/additional provision under 1994 Rules, predominantly 1994 Rules\n\nwill operate and service rules will remain subservient to the 1994 Rules,\n\nthough, these rules generally deal with the conditions of service. It is in the\n\nlight of the aforesaid statutory provision the applicability of Govt.\n\nInstructions dated 6.9.2001 is to be construed. By virtue of amended Rule\n\n18 the concept of minimum bench marks has been introduced and Rule 18\n\nfurther refers to the Govt. Instructions issued from time to time. Thus, the\n\nGovt. Instructions issued, form part of the Rule 18 of the 1994 Rules.\n\nIn the given scenario of the statutory provisions particularly by\n\nvirtue of Rule 18 (b) minimum bench mark could be provided particularly in\n\nabsence of any challenge to Rule 18 (b). It is not a case, where by issuing\n\nthe executive instructions simplicitor the statutory rules are being over ruled\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -12-\n\nor altered. When the judgement in Ravi Dutt Mehra's case (supra) was\n\ndelivered by this Court, it was not brought to the notice of the Court that\n\nRule 18 was made applicable w.e.f. 6.9.2001 when the Govt. Instructions\n\nwere issued and thus the validity of the Govt. Instructions was examined\n\nconsidering the same to be in the realm of simply executive instructions.\n\nThis was particularly in view of condition no.2 of instructions dated\n\n6.9.2001 which required amendment of statutory rules. However, in view of\n\nthe fact that amended Rule 18 itself adopts the Govt. Instructions dated\n\n6.9.2001 the notification dated 6.9.2001 ceases to be a simplicitor executive\n\ninstruction but attain the status of statutory provision by virtue of amended\n\nRule 18 (b). Thus, the judgement in Ravi Dutt Mehra's case (supra) does\n\nnot help the petitioners in the present case.\n\nEven if, it is presumed that the Govt. Instructions dated\n\n6.9.2001 cannot be pressed into service to introduce minimum bench marks,\n\nRule 18 (b) is self sufficient to introduce the concept of minimum bench\n\nmarks as the Rule 18 itself speaks of minimum bench mark i.e. 'Very Good'.\n\nGovt. Instructions dated 6.9.2001 has only introduced grading of the A.C.Rs\n\nand nothing more. The minimum bench marks are introduced by virtue of\n\nRule 18(b) itself. Even in absence of the Govt. Instructions the concept of\n\nbench marks does exist under Rule 18 (b) i.e. 'Very Good'. Grading of\n\nA.C.Rs is prerogative of employer and is well within its right to adopt any\n\ngrading method for introduction of the bench marks contemplated by Rule\n\n18(b).\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that all the relevant aspects and\n\nstatutory provisions were not thoughtfully considered while deciding the\n\ncase of Ravi Dutt Mehra (supra).\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -13-\n\nThe concept of rule of seniority-cum-merit has also been\n\nconsidered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in some recent judgements in case\n\nof\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava and others Vs. Samyut Kshetriya\n\nGramin Bank and others\n, reported as 2010 (1) SCC 335. In this case,\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court considered the principle of seniority-cum-merit as\n\ndistinct from seniority alone and merit-cum-seniority. While considering the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit, following observations have been made:-\n\n\"11. It is also well settled that the principle of seniority-cum-\nmerit, for promotion, is different from the principle of `seniority' and\nprinciple of merit-cum-seniority'. Where promotion is on the basis of\nseniority alone, merit will not play any part at all. But where promotion is\non the principle of seniority-cum-merit, promotion is not automatic with\nreference to seniority alone. Merit will also play a significant role. The\nstandard method of seniority-cum-merit is to subject all the eligible\ncandidates in the feeder grade (possessing the prescribed educational\nqualification and period of service) to a process of assessment of a\nspecified minimum necessary merit and then promote the candidates who\nare found to possess the minimum necessary merit strictly in the order of\nseniority. The minimum merit necessary for the post may be assessed either\nby subjecting the candidates to a written examination or an interview or by\nassessment of their work performance during the previous, or by a\ncombination of either two or all the three of the aforesaid methods. There is\nno hard and fast rule as to how the minimum merit is to be ascertained. So\nlong as the ultimate promotions are based on seniority, any process for\nascertaining the minimum necessary merit, as a basic requirement, will not\nmilitate against the principle of seniority-cum- merit.\n\n13. Thus it is clear that a process whereby eligible candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit in the feeder posts is first\nascertained and thereafter, promotions are made strictly in accordance\nwith seniority, from among those who possess the minimum necessary merit\nis recognised and accepted as complying with the principle of `seniority-\ncum-merit'. What would offend the rule of seniority-cum-merit is a process\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -14-\n\nwhere after assessing the minimum necessary merit, promotions are made\non the basis of merit (instead of seniority) from among the candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit. If the criteria adopted for\nassessment of minimum necessary merit is bona fide and not unreasonable,\nit is not open to challenge, as being opposed to the principle of seniority-\ncum-merit. We accordingly hold that prescribing minimum qualifying\nmarks to ascertain the minimum merit necessary for discharging the\nfunctions of the higher post, is not violative of the concept of promotion by\nseniority-cum-merit.\"\n\nIn case of\nHaryana State Warehousing Corporation\n(supra)\n\nreported as 2011 (9) SCC 422 the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Cyriac Joseph while\n\nconcurring with the conclusion of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Altamas Kabir\n\nseparately considered the principle of seniority-cum-merit and observed as\n\nunder:-\n\n\" 22. Thus it is the settled position that the criterion of\nseniority-cum-merit is different from the criterion of merit and also\nthe criterion of merit-cum-seniority. Where the promotion is based on\nseniority-cum-merit, the officer cannot claim promotion as a matter\nof right by virtue of his seniority alone. If he is found unfit to\ndischarge the duties of the higher post, he may be passed over\nand an officer junior to him may be promoted. Seniority-cum-merit means\nthat, given the minimum necessary merit required for efficiency of\nadministration, the senior, though less meritorious, shall have priority\nin the matter of promotion and there is no question of a further\ncomparative assessment of the merit of those who were found to have the\nminimum necessary merit required for efficiency of administration.\nFor assessing the minimum necessary merit, the competent authority\ncan lay down the minimum standard that is required and also\nprescribe the mode of assessment of merit of the employees. Such\nassessment can be made by assigning marks on the basis of appraisal of\nperformance on the basis of service record and interview and\nprescribing the minimum marks which would entitle a person to\nbe considered for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -15-\n\nThe concept of \"seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the requirement of\ncertain minimum merit or satisfying a benchmark previously fixed\nand, subject to fulfilling the said requirement, promotion is based\non seniority. There is no further assessment of the comparative merits of\nthose who fulfil such requirement of minimum merit or satisfy the\nbenchmark previously fixed. On the other hand, the principle of\n\"merit-cum-seniority\" puts greater emphasis on merit and ability and\nseniority plays a less significant role. Seniority is given\nweightage only when merit and ability are more or less equal\namong the candidates considered for promotion.\"\n\nThe above principle\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\neven emanate from Rule 5 (3) of 2004 Rules which inter alia mentions that\n\nseniority alone will not be basis for promotion. Thus, even when the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit applies, there is some element of merit\n\nwhich the officer may be required to possess for bringing efficiency in the\n\nservice. It is in this view of the matter that seniority alone has not been\n\nconsidered as the sole basis for promotion even under Rule 5 (3). A\n\ndistinction is to be drawn between principle of seniority alone and seniority-\n\ncum-merit as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above\n\nmentioned judgement. There is another relevant aspect, even Rule 18 of\n\n1994 Rules whereby the minimum bench marks have been introduced\n\nclearly provides that there shall be no supersession on the basis of merit.\n\nThe concept of this expression is that where the employees are required to\n\nachieve minimum bench marks, there cannot be any further comparison of\n\nmerit between such employees who acquire minimum bench marks. After\n\nthe employee achieved the minimum bench marks then rule of seniority has\n\nto prevail which is the objective and logical principle underlining the rule of\n\nseniority-cum-merit and perhaps could be the only realistic purpose of this\n\nprinciple.\n\nThis view has been adopted by this court in CWP No. 14309 of\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -16-\n\n2010 titled as\nDr. Darshan Singh vs. State of Punjab & others\ndecided on\n\n11.5.2011.\n\nIt is lastly contended on behalf of the petitioners that they have\n\nbeen deprived of their right of consideration by not communicating their\n\nadverse reports and thus all such adverse reports cannot be relied upon to\n\ndeny them the promotion.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are no adverse reports against the\n\npetitioners. They have not been graded below 'Good'. Though, some of\n\nthem have been graded as 'Very Good' also for some years. To support their\n\ncontentions, petitioners have relied upon a judgement of Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt reported as J.T 2008 (7) SC 463 titled as\nDev Dutt Vs. Union of\n\nIndia & others\n. In this case the Hon'ble Supreme Court issued directions\n\nfor making available all the entries in the A.C.Rs of a public servant. The\n\nrelevant directions read as under:-\n\n\"14. In our opinion, every entry (and not merely a poor or\nadverse entry) relating to an employee under the State or an instrumentality\nof the State, whether in civil, judicial, police or other service (except the\nmilitary) must be communicated to him, within a reasonable period, and it\nmakes no difference whether there is a bench mark or not. Even if there is\nno bench mark, non-communication of an entry may adversely affect the\nemployee's chances of promotion (or getting some other benefit), because\nwhen comparative merit is being considered for promotion (or some other\nbenefit) a person having a `good' or `average' or `fair' entry certainly has\nless chances of being selected than a person having a `very good' or\n`outstanding' entry.\n\n15. In most services there is a gradation of entries, which is\nusually as follows:\n\n(i) Outstanding\n(ii) Very Good\n(iii) Good\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -17-\n\n(iv) Average\n(v) Fair\n(vi) Poor\n\nA person getting any of the entries at items (ii) to (vi) should be\ncommunicated the entry so that he has an opportunity of making a\nrepresentation praying for its upgradation, and such a representation must\nbe decided fairly and within a reasonable period by the concerned\nauthority.\n\n16. If we hold that only `poor' entry is to be communicated,\nthe consequences may be that persons getting `fair', `average', `good' or\n`very good' entries will not be able to represent for its upgradation, and\nthis may subsequently adversely affect their chances of promotion (or get\nsome other benefit).\"\n\nRelying upon the aforesaid observations, it is contended that\n\nthe petitioners have been deprived of making a representation against their\n\nA.C.Rs and on account of no communication, they have not been able to\n\nimprove, thus, there has not been fair consideration of their claims for\n\npromotion. This judgement was delivered on 12.5.2008. Prior to the\n\naforesaid judgement, the only concept known to service jurisprudence was\n\ncommunication of adverse A.C.Rs. However, by virtue of the directions\n\ncontained in the aforesaid judgement, it has become obligatory upon the\n\nauthorities/public employer to communicate all A.C.Rs. This judgement is,\n\nhowever, prospective in nature and cannot be applied retrospectively for the\n\nperiod prior to the judgement. However, where the A.C.Rs of petitioners\n\nafter delivery of the judgement have been taken into consideration for\n\ndetermining the bench marks without communicating the same to them,\n\nperhaps they may have a grievance of non-communication of their A.C.Rs.\n\nThis aspect shall be examined by the respondents and where the A.C.Rs\n\nhave not been communicated for the period under consideration for\n\npromotion, such of the petitioners will be communicated their all A.C.Rs\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -18-\n\nirrespective whether there is anything adverse or not and after seeking their\n\nexplanation, after providing them an opportunity to represent and on\n\nconsideration of such representations, their cases may be re-considered.\n\nIn so far the introduction of minimum bench marks while\n\napplying the principle of seniority-cum-merit is concerned is not contrary of\n\nany rule, thus, cannot be faulted with. This is in particular reference to the\n\nEducation Department, where the teachers are to produce the students, who\n\nare the future of the nation. The education in any country is necessary for\n\nthe development of the country as a whole as the education has great role to\n\nplay in personality development of an individual, irrespective of the field to\n\nwhich he belongs or may ultimately join. The relevance and importance of\n\nthe education has been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent\n\njudgement reported as 2011 (3) SCC 436 titled as State of Orissa and\n\nanother Vs. Mamata Mohunty. While dealing with the significance and\n\nimportance of education the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:-\n\n\"33. In view of the above, it is evident that education is\nnecessary to develop the personality of a person as a whole and in totality\nas it provides the process of training and acquiring the knowledge, skills,\ndeveloping mind and character by formal schooling. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to maintain a high academic standard and academic discipline\nalong with academic rigour for the progress of a nation. Democracy\ndepends for its own survival on a high standard of vocational and\nprofessional education. Paucity of funds cannot be a ground for the State\nnot to provide quality education to its future citizens. It is for this reason\nthat in order to maintain the standard of education the State Govt. provides\ngrant-in-aid to private schools to ensure the smooth running of the\ninstitution so that the standard of teaching may not suffer for want of\nfunds.\"\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -19-\n\nSimilarly dealing with the experience of teaching staff the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:-\n\n\"34.\nArticle 21-A\nhas been added by amending our\nConstitution with a view to facilitate the children to get proper and good\nquality education. However, the quality of education would depend on\nvarious factors but the most relevant of them is excellence of teaching staff.\nIn view thereof, quality of teaching staff cannot be compromised. The\nselection of the most suitable persons is essential in order to maintain\nexcellence and the standard of teaching in the institution. It is not\npermissible for the State that while controlling the education it may\nimpinge the standard of education. It is, in fact, for this reason that norms\nof admission in institutions have to be adhered to strictly.\"\n\nThe post of Principal is a significant post for variety of reasons.\n\nThe Principal is not only an administrative head of an institution but also is\n\nconcerned with the academic excellence in the institution. It is with this\n\nobjective that the post of Principal has been brought under Group-A post\n\nnot merely for purpose of salary but for bringing efficiency and excellence\n\nin the institution itself. Thus, higher standards of excellence is demanded\n\nfrom an incumbent who occupies the post of Principal, who heads the\n\ninstitution for its overall monitoring, supervision and academic excellence.\n\nIntroduction of minimum bench marks in Group-A post is not only needed\n\nbut in fact is imperative.\n\nIn the above factual and legal background, action of the\n\nrespondents to introduce minimum bench marks cannot be interfered with.\n\nIn any case Rule 18 of 1994 Rules is not under challenge. These writ\n\npetitions are, accordingly, disposed of with a direction to the State-\n\nrespondents to re-consider the cases of such of the petitioners who have not\n\nbeen communicated their A.C.Rs for the period in question, if, such period\n\nfalls after 12.5.2008 i.e the date of delivery of judgement in\nDev Dutt\n's case\n\n(supra). However, wherever the petitioners have been communicated their\n\nCWP No. 17450 of 2010 -20-\n\nA.C.Rs for the period under consideration for purposes of their promotion,\n\nthe writ petitions shall stand dismissed.\n\nCopy of this judgement be placed on each connected file.\n\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nJUDGE\n31.5.2011.\n\nlucky\n\nWhether to be reported?
