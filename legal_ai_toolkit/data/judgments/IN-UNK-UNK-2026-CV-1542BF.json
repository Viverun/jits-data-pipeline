They pleaded their innocence by stating that\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.26/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n they had never demanded anything from the deceased or her family\nmembers nor they ever harassed the deceased physically or mentally.\nThey further pleaded that deceased, on the instigation of her family\nmembers, wanted to settle a nuclear family for which accused Rahul\nrefused which was the prime reason of dispute between her\n(deceased) and accused Rahul. Accused Rahul also examined himself\nas DW1 in defence.\n\nDefence Evidence\n\n29. DW1/Rahul Verma is the husband of deceased who\ndeposed that his marriage was solemnized with the deceased on\ndated 23.02.2011. The marriage was love cum arrange marriage. His\nwife was engaged to one Anil Kohli by her parents prior to his\nmarriage with DW1, but that engagement was cancelled by her\nparents as Pinki was not happy and not ready for said marriage with\nAnil Kohli. DW1 further deposed that thereafter, their parents met\nwith each other through mediator Shri Om Prakash Koli, who was\nknown to both the families. His parents proposed for a simple\nmarriage at a temple but that proposal was declined by deceased's\nparents. After their marriage, he and Pinki went for honeymoon at\nMassourie and they were happy. DW1 further deposed that he and his\nfamily had also attended the retirement party of the uncle (Tauji) of\nhis wife Pinki. They also attended the marriage of Vandana, cousin\nsister of his wife Pinki. Further that, after 2-3 months, Pinki raised a\ndemand for nuclear family but he (DW1) took the matter on a lighter\nnote. After that, Pinki requested him that she wanted to pursue higher\neducation and purusant to her request, DW1 got her admitted in MBA\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.27/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma etc.\n course. Fees receipts of the said MBA course have been placed on\nrecord as Ex.DW1/1 (running into two pages). Copy of the I card of the\ndeceased of MBA course issued from Sikkim Manipal University is\nEx.DW1/2. As per DW1, deceased had also prepared for the entrance\nexamination for various government services and he used to take her\nto the centres for the said examinations. Copy of the Admit cards of\nthe deceased is Mark DW1/3 (running into three pages). DW1 further\ndeposed that he and Pinki had also attended the birthday function of\nher brother i.e. Inder Koli at her parental house. In August 2011, he\nand his family members also celebrated deceased's birthday at their\nhome and same was attended by deceased's brother Inder Koli and\nher cousin sister. DW1 further deposed that Pinki had been constantly\nasking him (DW1) for a nuclear family and even her mother also\nasked him for separate accommodation for deceased saying that her\ndaughter needs privacy. DW1 however, tried to convince deceased\nby saying that his mother was suffering from arthritis, therefore, he\ncould not leave his mother in such condition but Pinki was adamant\non her demand. DW1 further testified that he alongwith Pinki and her\nfamily members had also gone for a religious trip to Haridwar. Even\nat Haridwar deceased's parents pressurized him for a nuclear family.\nAfter returning from Haridwar, Pinki told him that her mother was\nsearching a rented accommodation for them (DW1 and deceased)\nnear her house but he opposed her move. Before that Pinki also\nexpressed her desire that she wanted to join back her job for which he\nand his family members had given their assent.\n\n29.1 DW1 further deposed that in November 2011, parents of\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.28/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n Pinki had a katha (religious ceremony) at their home which was duly\nattended by him as well as his family members and they also used to\nvisit at the parental house of Pinki on festivals. Further that on\n28.12.2011, Pinki entered into an argument with him for living\nseparately as a nuclear family and after that she went for her office.\nAfter returning from her office, in the evening Pinki told him that her\nmother had already searched a rented accommodation for them near\nher parental house and from January 2012, he and Pinki had to shift to\nsaid rented accommodation but he refused for the same upon which\ndeceased continued to argue with him the whole night. Even on the\nnext morning, Pinki repeated her demand for nuclear family. Pinki also\ntold him that she would not attend her office for that day. After that,\non 29.12.2011, at about 11-11.30 am, DW1 left his home to purchase\nsome plumbing material at Kotla Mubarakpur. He returned back to his\nhome at about 1-1.30 pm. After reaching his home, he knocked the\ndoor of his bedroom for about 15 minutes but, Pinki did not respond.\nWhen DW1 inquired the reason from his family members, they told\nhim that Pinki had not opened the door of her bedroom ever since he\nleft the house. After that, he went to the backyard of his house and\npeeped inside his room from the window, he saw the deceased\nhanging from the ceiling fan of the room. After hearing hue and cry\nraised by DW1, his neighbour namely Sandeep also came there.\nHowever, before Sandeep reached there, he (DW1) had broken the\nwindow with the help of some iron object. Thereafter, DW1 took down\nthe dead body of his wife from the ceiling fan and unlocked the door\nwhich was bolted from inside. With the help of one Deshraj, who was\nhis acquaintance, DW1 took his wife to hospital.\n \nDuring investigation,\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.29/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n while he and his father were in police station, IO had taken his\nsignatures on certain blank papers.\n\n30. Prosecution witnesses as well defence witness were duly\ncross-examined by Ld. defence counsel and Ld. Prosecutor\nrespectively and relevant part of their cross-examination shall be\ndiscussed in later part of this judgment.\n\n31. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival\ncontentions raised from both the sides and also carefully perused the\nentire record.\n\nDefence arguments\n\n32. Ld. Defence Counsel Sh. Pradeep Nawani has vehemently\nargued that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charges\nagainst any of the accused as the testimony of prosecution witnesses\nis not reliable on account of various discrepancies and contradictions.\nHe further argued that even if the prosecution evidence is believed to\nbe true and reliable\n, \nin that case\n also the same is far from\nestablishing any of the essential ingredients of the alleged offences so\nas to base conviction on the same. It is further argued that\nprosecution witnesses though have alleged that the deceased was\nsubjected to harassment on account of dowry demand but none of\nthem cited any specific instance when the deceased was subjected to\nalleged harassment nor they even specified in what manner she was\nsubjected to such harassment or cruelty. \nIt is further argued that even\nthe date or occasion when the alleged demand of Rs.3 lacs was made,\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.30/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n has not been disclosed by the family members of deceased. It is\nfurther argued that prosecution has hopelessly failed to prove it on\nrecord that the deceased was subjected to any cruelty or harassment\nin connection with any demand for dowry soon before her death so as\nto raise the presumption of \nSection 113B\n of Indian Evidence Act. He\nfurther argued that the material on record is totally lacking to prove\nany of said material facts to seek conviction for the offence\n u/s 304-B\n\nIPC.\n \nIn this regard, he has relied upon the judgment in \nHira Lal vs.\nState (Govt. of NCT), Delhi\n, (2003) 8 SCC 80.\n\n32.1 Counsel further argued that even the charges for the\noffence\n u/s 306\n IPC which were framed alternatively, have not been\nproved on record as the testimony of prosecution witnesses nowhere\nreflects any instigation or aiding within the meaning of \nSection 107\n\nIPC on the part of accused persons.\n\nArguments of Ld. Addl. Public Prosecutor\n\n33. Per contra, Ld. Addl. PP Mr. Rakesh Mehta rebutted the\narguments by submitting that admittedly, the deceased had died\notherwise than normal circumstances within 7 years of her marriage\nwith accused Rahul and by clinching evidence of parents, brother and\none colleague of the deceased, prosecution has sufficiently proved on\nrecord that soon before her death, deceased was subjected to cruelty\non account of non fulfillment of demands for money raised by the\naccused persons therefore, the presumption of \nSection 113B\n of Indian\nEvidence Act for the offence of \nSection 304-B\n IPC and that of \nSection\n113A\n of Indian Evidence Act for the offence of \nSection 306\n IPC, charge\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.31/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n for which was framed in alternate are clearly drawn in favour of the\nprosecution and the defence has miserably failed to rebut said\npresumption. It is further urged that in such like cases of dowry death,\nit is rare to find any direct evidence because such crimes are\ncommitted within the four corners of matrimonial house of deceased,\nbut in the instant case there is ample material in the form of\ndeceased's conversation with her parents and colleague soon before\nher death and in view of the fact that said conversation is concering\nthe cause of her death and the circumstances of transaction which\nresulted into her death, same is admissible as dying declaration\n u/s\n32 (1)\n of Indian Evidence Act, which is an exception to hearsay\nevidence. He further argued that the SMS which the deceased sent to\nher colleague i.e. PW7 Jaspreet Kaur, for informing her that she had a\nquarrel with her husband who also assaulted her is clear proof of the\nfact that soon before death deceased was subjected to cruelty, and\nsaid SMS has been duly proved on record by leading cogent evidence.\n\nCourt's discussion\n\n34. Before embarking upon the evidence adduced on record, I\ndeem it appropriate to reproduce the relevant provisions of law for\nthe sake of ready reference.

We may now examine the evidence adduced on record to\nfirst determine whether an offence\n u/s 498A\n IPC has been made out\nagainst the accused persons. In this regard, prosecution has\nexamined witnesses namely Sohan Lal (father of deceased),\nChanderkala ( mother of deceased), Chiranji Lal (under of deceased),\nInder Kohli (brother of deceased) who have been examined as PW1 to\nPW4 respectively.\n\n36. Before separately discussing the testimony of said\nmaterial witnesses, I may mention here that it is an admitted position\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.35/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n of prosecution case that neither the alleged demand of money was\never raised by the accused persons directly from any of the family\nmembers of deceased nor deceased was ever subjected to any\nharassment, cruelty or ill treatment in their presence. As per\nprosecution case, about alleged demand of money and harassment,\ndeceased had informed her parents. In view of \nSection 32 (1)\n of\nIndian Evidence Act, such statement made by the deceased\nconcerning to any circumstances of transaction resulting in his/her\ndeath is admissible under law as dying declaration but, due caution is\nrequired to be taken before relying upon said testimony as the court\nhas to first satisfy that such testimony qualifies the essential\nrequirements of said provision for making it admissible for the\npurpose of evidence.\n\n37. PW1 Sohan Lal, father of deceased in his examination in\nchief says that deceased was constantly harassed for Rs. 3 lacs as her\nin laws used to demand Rs. 3 lacs for buying a house at Noida. As per\nPW1, in October, 2011, deceased became pregnant. However,\naccused started demanding Rs. 3 lacs and used to ask deceased to\napproach her parents to arrange money. PW1 made only a general\nstatement that accused used to harass deceased for Rs. 3 lacs\nwithout disclosing as to how and in what matter deceased was\nallegedly subjected to harassment by her husband or in laws. Though,\nPW1 alleged that pregnancy of deceased was terminated by accused\nwithout their information but he nowhere alleged that said medical\ntermination of pregnancy was without deceased's consent or that it\nwas against her wishes. As per PW1, deceased Pinki was though\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.36/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n residing with her parents at her parental home since 2nd or 3rd of\nmonth but on 28th, her husband took her daughter directly from her\noffice on the assurance that he pad pacified his parents and they\nwould not raise any demand for money but thereafter, they\n(deceased's parents) had received a phone call from deceased who\ntold them that she had been still harassed for Rs.3 lacs. But again,\nnothing has been disclosed by PW1 as to how the accused used to\nallegedly harass his daughter and on what date, time or occasion they\nreceived said alleged call from deceased.\n\n38. From the perusal of cross examination of PW1, it is clear\nthat after Roka ceremony with accused Rahul in May, 2009, parents of\ndeceased got the arrangement of deceased fixed with some other\nperson but again, in October, 2010, they initiated the talks of\nmarriage of deceased with accused Rahul because after Roka\nceremony, accused Rahul and deceased came closer and started\nloving each other. However, PW1 categorically denied the suggestion\nthat it was under deceased's pressure, they had to get the deceased\nmarried with accused Rahul. Here, I may mention that PW2, who is\nthe mother of deceased, in her cross examination however, gave a\ncontrary version as she admitted that second Roka ceremony of\ndeceased with accused Rahul was performed under the pressure of\ndeceased.\n\n39. PW1 however, admitted that accused Rahul had got\ndeceased admitted for MBA. He also admitted to have invited accused\npersons for katha ceremony at their residence i.e. at the parental\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.37/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n home of deceased. PW1 also admitted to have not disclosed in his\nstatement recorded before SDM (Ex. PW1/A) or in his statement\nrecorded\n u/s 161\n Cr.P.C., regarding any demand of Rs.3 lacs or\nregarding medical termination of pregnancy of deceased or regarding\nalleged use of ATM card of deceased by accused Rahul but, he denied\nthat he had introduced said facts in his examination in chief as an\nafter though under legal advise.\n\n40. Though, as per prosecution case, just after 2-3 months of\ndeceased's marriage, accused started harassing her, but the version\nof PW1 however, shows that accused family was having cordial\nrelations with deceased's family, as they used to frequently visit each\nother on different occasions like Holi on 19.03.2011, at birthday of\ndeceased's brother Inder on 02.06.2011 and on the retirement party\nof deceased's uncle i.e. PW3 on 31.03.2011. Deceased with her\nhusband i.e. accused Rahul had accompanied the entire family of PW1\nfor a religious tour in Haridwar from 28.10.2011 to 31.10.2011.\nVarious photographs of said occasions were placed on record as Ex.\nPW1/D1/D2 & PW2/D3 which were duly admitted by PW1 as well as\nhis wife PW2 when they were confronted with the same in their cross-\nexamination.\n\n41. From the cross-examination of PW1, it is also clear that\nancestral house of accused persons was at 2-3 minutes walking\ndistance from the house of sister of PW1 namely Maya, but still\ndeceased had never complained to her Bua regarding her alleged\nharassment at the hands of her in laws despite the fact that\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.38/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n deceased's Bua Maya used to occasionally visit the matrimonial house\nof deceased.\n\n42. In his cross-examination, PW1 also admitted the fact that\nmediator Om Prakash, PW1 and his (PW1's) brother Chiranjee Lal\n(PW3) were members of Kohli Cooperative Society for last 15-20 years\nand even the distance between deceased's parental house and that of\nher matrimonial house was also just 2 km. In said circumstances, it is\nhighly improbable that deceased's parents were kept in dark about\naccused Rahul's vocation or income as alleged.\n\n43. Before proceeding to consider testimony of PW2, I may\nmention here that PW1 in his statement Ex. PW1/A recorded before\nSDM on the very same date of incident which forms the basis of\npresent FIR, has though alleged that her daughter was harassed and\nassaulted on account of dowry but, there is no mention of any alleged\ndemand of money in the entire statement. In Ex. PW1/A, he has\nsimply stated that the accused were not happy with the dowry given\nin the marriage and just after a month, they started harassing her and\non account of said behaviour of accused persons, the deceased had\ncome to her parental house where she stayed for a month and she\nwas taken back to her matrimonial home by her husband directly from\nher office on 28.11.2011. Thereafter, her daughter informed them on\ntelephone that her husband had assured her that neither he himself\nnor his parents would quarrel with her. As is apparently clear, there is\nno mention in the entire statement regarding any demand of money\nor any harassment in furtherance thereof or even with regard to\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.39/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n alleged medical termination of pregnancy of the deceased. To said\nextent, PW1 appears to have improved his version and upon being\nconfronted with said improvements during the course of cross-\nexamination, PW1 was unable to give any sufficient reason for not\ndisclosing said material facts to the SDM in his first statement. There\nis no whisper in his entire statement Ex. PW1/A about any alleged\ndemand of money raised by the accused persons for buying any\nhouse in Noida or forcing the deceased to seek a job after marriage. It\nis nowhere alleged in said statement Ex. PW1/A or even in his\ntestimony before the court that deceased was ever taunted, abused\nor assaulted on account of her having not brought Rs. 3 lacs or in\norder to pressurize her to bring said money from her parents. None of\nthe family members of deceased, examined in this case as PWs has\ncome out with any specific instance of cruelty or harassment\nallegedly meted out to the deceased either in their own presence or\ntheir having been informed about it by the deceased.\n\n44. Even mother of deceased, who has been examined as\nPW2, also came up with a general allegation saying that after\nmarriage, the accused persons started harassing her daughter PInki\non account of demand of money. Further that, deceased was\npressurized to join back her employment which she had left at the\ntime of her marriage. As per her version, accused Rahul used to retain\nthe whole salary of deceased with him and used to give her meager\namount and did not allow her to retain sufficient balance in her mobile\nphone.\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.40/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 45. PW2 further deposed in her examination in chief that her\ndaughter used to tell her that whenever she (deceased) would ask her\nhusband i.e. accused Rahul to live separately, he used to ask the\ndeceased to bring Rs. 3 lacs for taking a separate home or to ask her\nparents to give them (couple) a room in their two room house at Wazir\nNagar, which was already on rent. PW2 further stated that accused\nGian and Madhu asked accused Rahul to leave deceased at their\nhouse (parental house of deceased) as they (deceased's parents)\nwere not able to pay Rs. 3 lacs to accused. She further deposed that\nwhen deceased became pregnant and was unwell, she was dropped\nby her husband at her parental home, though even from there,\ndeceased used to go for her job and it was her husband who used to\npick and drop her for her job. On 20 th November, deceased was taken\nby her husband for conducting some test but instead, accused got her\nchild aborted in some clinic at Lajpat Nagar without her knowledge as\nshe (deceased) was unconscious because of the injection given to her.\n\n46. Here, I may mention that IO had not made any\ninvestigation in this regard as no such fact regarding abortion of\ndeceased was disclosed by her parents at the time of their\nstatements recorded before SDM and said fact came to be disclosed\nby parents of deceased only at the time of their examination in the\ncourt.\n\n47. As per PW2, Pinki was left at her parental home on the\nsame very day after abortion i.e. on 20.11.2011 and she stayed there\ntill 28th and on 28th November, Rahul took the deceased back to her\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.41/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n matrimonial home by assuring that his parents would not raise any\ndemand for money but, deceased informed them that her mother in\nlaw had however, again commented that why Rahul had brought Pinki\nback to her matrimonial home. Thereafter, Pinki never visited her\nparental home.\n\n48. The above deposition of PW2 nowhere indicates that the\ndeceased was ever subjected to any kind of harassment or cruelty in\nfurtherance of alleged demand of money by any of the accused\npersons. If the testimony of PW2 is read as a whole, it rather suggests\nthat Pinki i.e. the deceased came to live at her parental home in the\nmonth of November because at that time, she was pregnant and was\nunable to do the household work singly because her mother in law\nwas suffering from arthritis and therefore, her husband in order to\navoid any inconvenience to deceased sent her to her parental home\nand even from there, he used to help the deceased in commuting to\nthe office as he used to pick and drop her from her parental home for\nher job.\n\n49. Careful perusal of deposition of PW2 also reflects that on\n10.11.2011, accused Rahul and Gian Chand had attended a Katha\nceremony at parental house of deceased and at that time Pinki was\nalready at her parental house and prior to that, deceased and her\nhusband had gone for a religious tour at Haridwar between\n28.10.2011 to 31.10.2011 with parental family of deceased.\n\n50. PW2 also admitted that accused Rahul had got deceased\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.42/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n admitted for MBA and she (deceased) had also appeared in SCC\nexamination from her matrimonial home and her husband used to\narrange for filling of forms for said examination. PW2 also admitted\nthat all the accused with deceased had visited them for attending\nretirement party of Chiranjee Lal (brother in law of PW2) and marriage\nparty of Vandana (niece of PW2) and her son Inder Kohli had also\ngone to deceased's matrimonial house for celebration of deceased's\nfirst birthday after her marriage on 02.08.2011.\n\n51. The above circumstances nowhere suggests that deceased\nwas feeling harassed on account of the conduct of her husband or in\nlaws rather it appears that the two families were enjoying cordial\nrelationship. Small discords in the joint families relating to the sharing\nof responsibilities of the household work etc. are not uncommon and\neven in the instant case, it appears that since the deceased had\nstarted working after her marriage with accused Rahul, she was\nunable to bear all the responsibilities of the household chores\nespecially when she was not having any helping hand as even her\nmother in law was ill as she was suffering from arthritis and for said\nreason deceased had insisted her husband to live separately.\n\n52. Though in her cross-examination, PW2 denied the\nsuggestion that her daughter wanted to live separately with accused\nRahul as a nuclear family but, in her examination in chief, she has\nmade candid admission to the effect that when her daughter had\nasked her husband Rahul to live separately, then her husband asked\nher to bring Rs. 3 lacs to take a separate home. The said deposition of\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.43/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n PW2 makes it apparently clear that deceased did not want to live in a\njoint family and wanted to shift to a separate accommodation with her\nhusband alone. The deposition of PW2 also reflects that mother in law\nof deceased i.e. accused Madhu was suffering from arthritis and was\nunable to do the household work and therefore, the whole burden of\nhousehold work was upon the deceased. Even a cousin sister of\ndeceased's husband namely Ginny who used to live with them, also\ndid not use to help the deceased.\n\n53. From the above circumstances, it appears that deceased\nwas not willing to stay in the joint family and used to ask her husband\nto live separately. Even as per the defence taken by the accused\npersons, on the preceding night of alleged incident, deceased had\ninsisted her husband to shift to a rented accommodation near her\nparental house and when her husband did not agree for the same ,\nthey entered into a fight.\n\n54. It is pertinent to note here that as per PW2, deceased and\nher husband Rahul had visited to Haridwar with deceased's parental\nfamily and after coming back from there, deceased fell sick as she\nwas pregnant and she was left at their home by Rahul as her mother\nin law used to comment that if deceased had fallen ill, who would do\nthe household work. From said statement, it appears that since the\ndeceased was working even at that time, her husband showed\nconcern about her health because his own mother was suffering from\narthritis and therefore, in order to avoid any kind of hassles to the\ndeceased in the matrimonial home on account of her ill health, he left\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.44/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n the deceased to her parental home for few days and even from there\nhe used to pick and drop her for her job. From the deposition of the\nparents of deceased, there is nothing to suggest that in the month of\nNovember, deceased was left at her parental home on account of any\nillegal demand or any harassment in furtherance thereof.\n\n55. At one point, PW2 in her examination in chief deposed\nthat it was deceased's husband who asked her to bring Rs. 3 lacs to\ntake a separate home that too when deceased asked him to live\nseparately, showing that demand of Rs.3 lacs was raised only by\nhusband. But, in her subsequent examination, PW2 deposed that in\nNovember, after staying at her parental home for 8 days deceased\nreturned to her matrimonial home with her husband on the assurance\nof her husband that his parents would not raise any demand of money\nindicating that the demand for money was raised by the in laws. On\nthe other hand, in the statement Ex. PW1/A of the father of deceased\nmade to SDM on 29.12.2011, there is no whisper of any such demand\nof money as he deposed that the deceased joined back her\nmatrimonial home on 28.11.2011, on the assurance of her husband\nthat neither he nor his parents would quarrel with her. In said\nstatement Ex. PW1/A, PW1 nowhere mentioned that reason of alleged\nquarrel was any demand of money or a house.\n\n56. From the above discrepant version of PW2, it is not clear\nwho actually raised the alleged demand of Rs.3 lacs. Even otherwise,\nthe alleged demand even if believed to have been raised by accused\nRahul, the same was raised only when deceased asked him to live\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.45/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n separately. For the purpose of buying a separate accommodation, if\nthe husband asked deceased to arrange Rs. 3 lacs from her parents,\nthat will not amount to a demand of dowry within the meaning of\n\nSection 2\n of Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\n57. Admittedly, husband of deceased was staying with his\nparents in a government accommodation and admittedly deceased\nhad been asking him to live separately, then in such a situation, if the\nhusband told her to ask her parents to allow them to live in their\nhouse which deceased's parents were owning at Wazir Nagar, the\nsame will not amount to a dowry demand. Though a wife has all the\nright to be maintained by her husband but, it is never beyond the\nmeans, status and resources of her husband. If the husband was not\ncapable of arranging a separate accommodation and in such a\nsituation if his wife was still insisting him for a separate home, the act\nof the husband to ask his wife to bring Rs. 3 lacs for arranging a\nseparate home for her, shall not amount to dowry demand within the\nmeaning of \nSection 304B\n IPC.\n\n58. Furthermore, for attracting the provisions of \nSection 498A\n\nIPC or for that matter, \nSection 304B\n IPC, there has to be cruelty and\nharassment in furtherance of unlawful demand of dowry.\n\n59. For establishing the cruelty or harassment within the\nmeaning of \nSection 498A\n IPC, the harassment or cruelty must be\nunabated, incessant, persistent and grave in nature and same must\nbe with intention to force woman to commit suicide or to fulfill illegal\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.46/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n demand of dowry. Every act of cruelty or harassment is not made a\ncrime\n u/s 498A\n IPC. A solitary incident cannot be interpreted to be\nsufficient evidence of cruelty or harassment attracting Section 498A\nbecause \nin that case\n, incessant, persistent and sufficiently grave\ncruelty as is likely to drive a woman to a point of desperation leaving\nher with no option except to think about suicide will be absent. The\ncruelty and harassment envisaged\n u/s 498A\n IPC must be unabated,\ncontinuous or recurring and one or two incidents casually taking\nplace, will not be sufficient to attract said provision of law.\n In\nIndrasing M. Raol vs. State of Gujarat, II (2002) DMC 239, it\nwas held by the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court that:-\n\n \"17. A woman would prefer to end her life, if continuous or\n recurring unabated harassment or cruelty grave in nature, is\n intolerable or unendurable. Highly sensitive, impulsive,\n reckless, or touchy woman may on one incident end her life,\n but that exception to the rule is not envisaged by the\n section. It should also be stated that after marriage\n sometimes emotional disorder is created, and that results\n into frustration and pessimism. A woman sometime\n becomes psychotic and develops tendency to end her life. A\n woman being highly sensitive and sentimental, or reckless,\n or if tired of her life either because her dreamt expectations\n are not satisfied or found to be the mirage, or for any other\n reason may become dejected and desperate and may\n develop suicidal tendency, and end her life. The duty of the\n Court is also to make necessary endeavour to ascertain why\n the husband or his relatives had as alleged turned up their\n nose at the victim and resorted to coarse cruelty, divorcing\n civility, delicacy and refinement. Having regard to the facts\n and circumstances on record, if Court finds that the misdeed\n or wrong on the part of the accused is the compelling\n reaction of the real or unjust or fancied provocative act of\n the victim, i.e., abetted counter-action or wrong, the same\n even if uncivil or Barbaric will not fall within the ambit of\n cruelty envisaged by Section 498-A, for required intention\n would be lacking although the same may attract any other\n penal provision. \nIn short, therefore, intention to drive the\n woman to commit suicide being the essential ingredient, the\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.47/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n endeavour of the Court must be to find out having regard to\n the facts and circumstances on record, what the intention of\n the accused was? I will, therefore, proceed to ascertain what\n could be the intention of the appellant when he, on mid-\n night as alleged, behaved stormily or roughly, though it is\n clear that the alleged solitary incident will not attract\n Section 498A.\"\n\n60. In the instant case, except the general allegation of\nharassment, there is absolutely nothing in the testimony of\nprosecution witnesses as to how and in what manner the deceased\nwas subjected to harassment by the accused persons. There is no\nallegation in the testimony of any of the family members of deceased\nthat deceased was subjected to any such cruelty physical or mental in\nfurtherance of demand of dowry or with an intention to drive her to\ncommit suicide.\n\n61. Even the SMS allegedly sent by deceased to her colleague\nPW7 Jaspreet Kaur at her mobile, on which prosecution has heavily\nrelied upon to show \"cruelty soon before death\" nowhere mentions\nthat the alleged assault/beatings which deceased was given by her\nhusband, was in furtherance of demand of dowry. There is nothing to\nsuggest why the couple had a quarrel on the fateful day. The SMS\nreads \"Mere husband ke saath mera Jhagra ho gaya or mujhe marra\nbhi\". Though the message mentions that she was hit by her husband\nbut, it does not disclose the manner of alleged assault on her nor that\nwhat was the reason of their quarrel. Postmortem report Ex. PW5/A is\nnot indicative of any external marks of injury on the dead body of\ndeceased.\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.48/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 62. Except in said SMS, there is absolutely no other\ncircumstance brought on record by the prosecution to show that\ndeceased was ever beaten up in any manner by any of the accused\npersons either on account of demand of dowry or on any other\naccount during her stay in the matrimonial house. Except bald\nallegations of harassment or cruelty, there is no specific allegation in\nthis regard in the testimony of any of the family members of\ndeceased. Even PW3 Chiranji Lal has raised bald, unspecific and\ngeneral allegation of harassment that too is nothing but a hearsay\nevidence because as per his statement Ex. PW3/A, Pinki used to\ncomplain about her harassment at the hands of her husband and in\nlaws to her father Sohan Lal. Whereas, PW3 though in his examination\nbefore the court alleged that the accused had raised demand of a\nhouse and cash of Rs.3 lacs for the purpose of purchasing a house\nbut, there is no whisper of any such allegation in his statement Ex.\nPW3/A recorded before SDM.\n\n63. I have also perused the testimony of deceased's brother\nInder Kohli who has been examined as PW4. As per his deposition, her\nsister used to call him after marriage and informed that her father in\nlaw, mother in law and brother in law had been harassing her on\naccount of dowry. It is interesting to note that none of the other family\nmembers had uttered a word against the brother in law of the\ndeceased and it was PW4 who first time came up with the allegation\neven against the brother in law. He further deposed in his\nexamination in chief that deceased used to tell him that whenever\ndeceased told her husband about said conduct of her in laws, even\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.49/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n her husband, her husband scolded her and used to suspect her.\nFurther, on the occasion of Rakshabandan when the deceased visited\ntheir house, she complained about displeasure of accused persons on\naccount of insufficiency of dowry given in her marriage.\n\n64. It is interesting to note that neither in his statement Ex.\nPW4/A made to the SDM on 29.12.2011 nor in his deposition recorded\nbefore the court, PW4 disclosed anything about any demand of Rs.3\nlacs or a house at Noida by the accused persons nor there is any\nspecific allegation relating to cruelty or harassment. Though in the\nstatement Ex. PW4/A it was alleged that the husband used to\nphysically assault her whenever deceased complained about the\nconduct of her in laws in taunting her for not bringing sufficient dowry\nbut, his deposition in the court is totally silent about any such\nallegation. The allegation of harassment are bald and general as\nneither the manner of harassment has been disclosed nor any specific\ninstance has been mentioned by PW4 in his deposition. Rather in his\ncross-examination, he admitted to have celebrated his birthday on\n02.06.2011 with accused Rahul at the parental home of the deceased,\nhis having joined the deceased and her husband in birthday\ncelebration of deceased on 02.08.2011 at her matrimonial home at\nSadiq Nagar and further the deceased and the accused Rahul fhaving\njoined them in the religious trip to Haridwar in the month of October,\n2011. He also admitted various photographs of said occasions which\nwere shown to him by the defence counsel during his cross\nexamination, as Ex. PW4/D2, D3 & D4.\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.50/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 65. The above deposition of PW4 rather shows that the two\nfamilies were at good terms and even the couple had been enjoying\nwarm relationship as the husband had been taking due care of his\nwife i.e. the deceased even at the time when she was staying at her\nparental home, as it was he, who used to pick and drop her for her\njob. It was husband only who got the deceased admitted for MBA and\nused to take her to examination centre for appearing in different\nexams.\n\n66. It is vehemently argued on behalf of\ncomplainant/prosecution that on fateful day, deceased was subjected\nto beatings by her husband in furtherance of demand of money,\nwhich compelled the deceased to take extreme step of suicide. In this\nregard, prosecution has relied upon the testimony of PW7 & PW8\n(friend of deceased Jaspreet and employer Anil Kumar Goyal) who\nhave deposed regarding deceased having sent a message on the\nmobile phone of PW7 informing her that she had a quarrel with her\nhusband and her husband had also hit her. It is further argued that\nthe said text message sent by deceased from her mobile phone to\nmobile phone of her friend has been duly proved in view of the\nversion of PW7, PW8, PW20 and IO/PW22 and the FSL report Ex.\nPW20/A & B.\n\n67. However, as already noted above, said text message\nEx.PW7/A nowhere mentions that a quarrel had occurred in\nfurtherance of any unlawful demand of dowry. \nIn said message,\ndeceased wrote \" Mere husband ke sath mera Jhagra ho gaya hai aur\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.51/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n mujhe maara bhi\". It nowhere shows that how she was hit or beaten\nup by her husband or whether it was just a slap and fist blow or with\nsome object, nothing is clear from the text message. Considering the\nfact that neither the postmortem report is indicative of any external\ninjury showing any physical assault on the deceased nor the\nprosecution has brought on record any cogent evidence to prove any\nprevious history of physical assaults, the said SMS is not sufficient to\nshow that the deceased was subjected to any physical cruelty of the\nextent envisaged\n u/s 498A\n IPC, for raising any presumption of \nSection\n113A\n of Indian Evidence Act for attracting the provisions of \nSection\n306\n IPC.\n\n68. The general allegation of harassment without describing\nthe exact conduct of accused will not be sufficient to attract the\nprovisions of Section 498A or 304-B \nIPC\n. \nIn this regard, I also refer the\njudgment in \nAmar Singh vs. State of Rajasthan\n 2010 (4)\nCriminal Court Cases 234 (SC) wherein it was held that \" a\nprosecution witness who merely uses the word \"harassed\" or\n\"tortured\" and does not describe the exact conduct of accused which,\naccording to him, amounted to harassment or torture may not be\nbelieved by the court in cases\n u/s 498A\n and \n304-B\n IPC.\"\n\n69. One cannot lose sight of the fact that it is one of the\nfundamental principles of criminal jurispuradance that an accused is\npresumed to be innocent till he is proved guilty. It is equally well\nsettled that suspicion however, strong can never take the place of\nproof. There is indeed a long distance between the accused \"may\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.52/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n have committed the offence\" and \"must have committed the offence\"\n\nwhich must be transversed by the prosecution by adducing reliable\nand cogent evidence. Presumption of innocence has been recognized\nas a human right which cannot be washed away. Reliance placed on\nKailash Guar & Ors. State of Aasam (2012) 2 SCC 34.\n\n70. As per postmortem report Ex.PW5/A, except a ligature\nmark pointing upward and one old scar over mid forhead, no other\nexternal antemortem injury was found present over the body of\ndeceased and cause of death was asphyxia due to ante mortem\nhanging and time since death was about a day prior to postmortem.\nAs autopsy, as per PM report started at 11:55 am on 30.12.2011, it\nsuggests that death had occurred at about 12:00 am on 29.12.2011.\nThere is nothing on record to show that viscera of deceased was\npreserved by the Autopsy surgeon for chemical analysis so as to rule\nout the possibility of concomitant intoxication or poisoning.\n\n71. As regard the allegations of mental cruelty meted out to\ndeceased by her husband in leaving his job just after few months of\nmarriage, asking deceased to seek job after marriage, aborting the\ndeceased's pregnancy without her consent and knowledge, not\nproviding her with the sufficient money for meeting her day to day\nexpenses and also raising doubt that she was having extra marital\naffairs, I may mention that on careful reading of testimony of PW1 to\nPW4 as well as their statements recorded before the SDM, their\ndepositions in this regard are found materially discrepant and do not\ncorroborate with each other and as such not found sufficient for\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.53/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n attracting the above provisions.\n\n72. In the context of \nSection 306\n IPC, charges for which were\nframed against the accused in alternate, it would be useful to refer\nthe judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Randhir Singh vs. State\nof Punjab MANU/SC/0881/2004 : (2004) 13 SCC 129wherein it\nwas held that\n \"abetment involves a mental process of instigating a\n person or intentionally aiding that person in doing of a\n thing. In cases of conspiracy also, it would involve that\n mental process of entering into conspiracy for the doing\n of that thing. More active role which can be described as\n instigating or aiding the doing of a thing is required\n before a person can be said to be abetting the\n commission of offence\n u/s 306\n IPC.\n\n73. The marital discord or differences between husband or\nwife or any quarrel with the husband or in laws would not by itself,\nwithout anything more be sufficient to attract the provisions of\nSection 306 r/w \nSection 107\n IPC. The burden of proof is not altered by\n\nSection 113 A \nof Indian Evidence Act, as held by Hon'ble Apex Court\nin AIR 1998 SC titled as \nState of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal\n& Ors.\n wherein, it was held that in a criminal trial however, intriguing\nmay be the facts and circumstances of the case, the charges made\nagainst the accused must be proved beyond all reasonable doubts\nand the requirement of proof cannot lie in the realms of surmises and\nconjectures. The requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt does\nnot stand altered even after introduction of \nSection 498A\n IPC and\n\nSection 113A\n of Indian Evidence Act.\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.54/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 74. Here, it is also pertinent to note that even in Ex. PW1/A,\nthe statement of Sohan Lal, recorded by SDM on 29.12.2011, which\nformed basis of present FIR, he simply stated that accused persons\nwere not happy with the dowry given in the marriage and just after\none month of marriage, they started harassing their daughter and on\naccount of said behaviour, his daughter came to her parental home in\nthe month of November, 2011 and after staying there for about one\nmonth, she was taken to her matrimonial house by her husband on\nthe assurance that neither he himself nor his parents would quarrel\nwith her. There is not a single utterance of any demand for money or\nany harassment in furtherance thereof.\n\n75. Cruelty is defined under two clauses of Explanation to\nSection 498A. Clause (a) talks about willful conduct of such nature as\nis likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury\nor danger to life, limb or health. As per clause (b), it also includes\nharassment of woman in furtherance of any unlawful demand for any\nproperty or valuable security or on account of failure of such woman\nor any person related to her to meet such demand.\n\n76. In the instant case, testimony of prosecution witnesses is\ntotally lacking to reflect any such willful conduct of accused in the\nnature to drive the deceased to commit suicide. Mere allegation that\ndeceased was pressurized to bring money for fulfillment of her desire\nof a separate home is not sufficient unless it is proved that deceased\nwas put to some harassment mental or physical on account of said\nreason.\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.55/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 77. As regard the deposition of Ms. Jaspreet Kaur (PW7)\nalthough there is no legal bar in relying upon her testimony relating to\nher having received a written communication from the deceased vide\nSMS Ex. PW7/A on her mobile phone from deceased's mobile phone,\nimmediately soon before deceased death, especially when the same\nwas concerning the circumstances of transactions which resulted into\ndeceased's death, but, as noted above, even said SMS nowhere\nsuggests what was the cause of quarrel between the couple and how\nand in what manner she was allegedly assaulted because the\npostmortem report is not indicting any external injury on the body of\nthe deceased nor there is any history disclosed even by the family\nmembers of deceased to suggest that deceased was ever subjected\nto physical assaults on any occasion after her marriage, either by the\nhusband or his parents. The SMS also does not mention anything\nabout any illegal/unlawful demand of dowry or that the alleged\nquarrel or assault by the husband of deceased was in furtherance of\nany such demand.\n\n78. \nSection 304-B\n IPC embodies a deemed fiction in\ncontradiction with the cardinal principle of presumption of innocence\nin favour of an accused. The legislature has applied the concept of\ndeemed fiction in \nSection 304-B\n IPC where the husband or his\nrelatives shall be deemed to have caused death of a woman once the\nprosecution proves its case with regard to basic ingredients of \nSection\n304-B\n IPC. \nIn other words, the offence shall be deemed to have been\ncommitted by fiction of law once the prosecution proves the other\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.56/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n ingredients of \nSection 304-B\n IPC and in that event, the court will\npresume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives\ncomplained of, has caused her death. But of course, the deemed\nfiction would introduce a rebutable presumption which can be\nrebutted by the husband and his relatives by leading their defence\nand proving that the ingredients of Section 304-B were not satisfied.\n\nWhile referencing to raising of presumption u/s 304-B of the Code,\nHon'ble Apex Court in \nKaliyaperumal vs. State of T.N.\n (2004) 9\nSCC 157, stated the following ingredients which should be satisfied:\n\n (1) The question before the court must be whether the\n accused has committed the dowry death of a\n woman, (This means that the presumption can be\n raised only if the accused is being tried for the\n offence under \nSection 304-B\n IPC).\n\n (2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or harassment\n by her husband or his relatives.\n\n (3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or in connection\n with any demand for dowry.\n\n (4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon before her\n death.\n\n \n79. In the light of the above essential ingredients, for\n constituting an offence under Section 304-B of the Code, the Court\n has to attach specific significance to the time of alleged cruelty and\n harassment to which the victim was subjected to and the time of\n her death, as well as whether the alleged demand of dowry was in\n connection with the marriage. Once these ingredients are satisfied,\n it would be called the \"dowry death\" and then, by deemed fiction of\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.57/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n law, the husband or the relatives would be deemed to have\n committed that offence.\n \nReliance placed on the judgment of Hon'ble\n Apex Court in \nAshok Kumar vs. State of Haryana\n, 2010 (12)\n SCC 350.\n\n 80. As is evident from record, the accused have been tried\n before this court for the offence of dowry death\n u/s 304-B\n/\n34\n IPC\n alongwith other offences\n u/s 498A\n/\n34\n IPC. Hence, the first ingredient\n of the offence i.e. the trial of the accused before the court should be\n for the offence of \nsection 304-B\n IPC is satisfied. Now, comes to the\n second question as to whether deceased was subjected to\n harassment or cruelty by the accused persons. However, said\n question has already been decided herein above while dealing with\n the charges of offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC wherein, it has been\n held that prosecution has miserably failed to prove that the\n deceased was subjected to any cruelty or harassment at the hands\n of accused persons.\n\n 81. Secondly, as already noted above, there is no cogent or\n reliable evidence even with regard to alleged demand of Rs.3 lacs,\n but even otherwise, it was not in connection with the marriage of\n deceased. As per prosecution own case, the same was raised by\n deceased's husband only when deceased insisted him for a\n separate house as she was not willing to live in the joint family with\n her in laws. As per PW1's own version, deceased's husband was a\n man of insufficient means as he was unemployed at the time of\n death of deceased. \nIn said circumstances, even if it is believed that\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.58/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\ndeceased was asked to bring money for a separete home, same\n cannot be treated as demand of 'dowry' within the meaning of\n \nSection 304B\n IPC especially in the light of judgment in \nAppasaheb\n & Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra\n (supra) wherein it was held\n that a demand for money on account of some financial stringency or\n for meeting some urgent domestic expenses cannot be termed as a\n demand for dowry within a meaning of \nSection 304-B\n IPC. Here the\n husband was not willing to leave his parents and it was the\n deceased who had been insisting him for a separate\n accommodation and it is only for fulfillment of deceased's desire for\n a separate accommodation, if the husband asked her to arrange\n money from her parents or to ask them to arrange for them (couple)\n for some alternative accommodation, the same cannot be treated\n as a demand for dowry within the meaning of Section 304B or\n \nSection 498A\n IPC.\n\n 82. Since the first two essential ingredients of \nSection 304-B\n\n IPC i.e. the cruelty and harassment in connection with demand of\n dowry, have not been established on record, the third question\n whether such cruelty was soon before death, need not to be\n considered.\n\n 83. In the backdrop of said circumstances, prosecution failed\n to establish even the charges of \nSection 304 B \nIPC against any of\n the accused persons.\n\n \n84. Now, comes to the question of consideration of charges of\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.59/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n \nSection 306\n IPC.\n \nIn the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case\n titled as \nHans Raj v. State of Haryana\n (2004) 12 SCC 257,\n wherein Hon'ble Apex Court has examined the scope of \nSection\n 113A\n of the Evidence Act vis a vis \nsections 306\n, \n107\n, \n498A\n IPC and\n held that:-\n\n \"Unlike \nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act, a statutory\n presumption does not arise by operation of law merely on\n the proof of circumstances enumerated in \nSection 113A\n of\n the Evidence Act. This Court held that, under \nSection 113A\n\n of the Evidence Act, the prosecution has to first establish\n that the woman concerned committed suicide within a\n period of seven years from the date of her marriage and\n that her husband has subject her to cruelty. Even though\n those facts are established, the court is not bound to\n presume that suicide has been abetted by her husband.\n Section 113A, therefore, gives discretion to the court to\n raise such presumption having regard to all other\n circumstances of the case, which means that where the\n allegation is of cruelty, it can consider the nature of cruelty\n to which the woman was subjected, having regard to the\n meaning of the word 'cruelty' in \nSection 498-A\n IPC.\"\n\n85. \nIn \nPinakin Mahipatray Rawal vs. State of Gujarat\n\n(2013) 10 SCC 48, the Hon'ble Apex Court has again examined the\nscope of \nSection 113A\n of the Evidence Act and reiterated the legal\nposition that the legislative mandate of \nSection 113A\n of the Evidence\nAct is that if a woman commits suicide within seven years of her\nmarriage and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her\nhusband had subjected her to cruelty defined in \nSection 498A\n IPC, the\nCourt may presume, having regard to all other circumstances of the\ncase, that such suicide had been abetted by the husband or such\nperson.\n \nThe Court held that, though a presumption could be drawn,\nthe burden of proof of showing that such an offence has been\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.60/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n committed by the accused under Seciton 498-A \nIPC\n is on the\nprosecution. The Court held that the burden is on the prosecution to\nestablish the fact that the deceased committed suicide and the\naccused abetted the suicide.\n\n86. Whereas, in the instant case neither the cruelty within the\nmeaning of \nSection 498A\n IPC has been established on record by the\nprosecution so as to seek presumption of \nSection 113A\n of Indian\nEvidence Act, nor there is any other circumstances on record to\nindicate that accused had abetted the suicide. The alleged conduct of\naccused in harassing the deceased by raising demand of money for a\nseparate house, even otherwise is not sufficient to bring the case\nwithin ambit of \nSection 107\n IPC, as the material on record is\ncompletely lacking to prove in what manner the deceased was put to\nalleged harassment by the accused persons.\n\n87. \nIn \nRamesh Kumar vs. State of Chhatisgarh\n (2001)\n9SCC 618 , Hon'ble Apex Court examined different shades of the\nmeaning of \"instigation\" defined in \nsec. 107\n IPC as under:-\n\n \"20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or\n encourage to do 'an act'. To satisfy the requirement of\n instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must\n be used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must\n necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the\n consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the\n consequence must be capable of being spelt out. The\n present one is not a case where the accused had by his acts\n or omission or by a continued course of conduct created\n such circumstances that the deceased was left with no\n other option except to commit suicide in which case an\n instigation may have been inferred. A word uttered in the fit\n of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to\n actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.\"\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.61/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n\n 88. \nIn \nState of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal\n, (1994) 1 SCC 73,\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court has cautioned that the court should be\nextremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each\ncase and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding\nwhether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to\nend the life by committing suicide. If it appears to the court that a\nvictim committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance,\ndiscord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society\nto which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and\ndifferences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced\nindividual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the\ncourt should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused\ncharged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.\n\n89. In the instant case, accused Rahul examined himself as\nDW1 wherein he has stated that after 2-3 months, Pinki raised a\ndemand for nuclear family but he (DW1) took the matter on a lighter\nnote. After that, Pinki requested him that she wanted to pursue higher\neducation and pursuant to her request, DW1 got her admitted in MBA\ncourse. DW1 further deposed that Pinki had been constantly asking\nhim (DW1) for a nuclear family and even her mother also asked him\nfor a separate accommodation for deceased saying that her daughter\nneeds privacy. DW1 however, tried to convince deceased by saying\nthat his mother was suffering from arthritis, therefore, he could not\nleave his mother in such condition but Pinki was adamant on her\ndemand. DW1 further testified that he alongwith Pinki and her family\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.62/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n members had also gone for a religious trip to Haridwar. Even at\nHaridwar deceased's parents pressurized him for a nuclear family.\nAfter returning from Haridwar, Pinki told him that her mother was\nsearching a rented accommodation for them (DW1 and deceased)\nnear her house but he opposed her move. Before that Pinki also\nexpressed her desire that she wanted to join back her job for which he\nand his family members had given their assent.\n\n90. DW1 further deposed that on 28.12.2011, Pinki entered\ninto an argument with him for living separately as a nuclear family\nand after that she went for her office. After returning from her office,\nin the evening Pinki told him that her mother had already searched a\nrented accommodation for them near her parental house and from\nJanuary 2012, he and Pinki had to shift to said rented accommodation\nbut he refused for the same upon which deceased continued to argue\nwith him the whole night. Even on the next morning, Pinki repeated\nher demand for nuclear family. Pinki also told him that she would not\nattend her office for that day. After that, on 29.12.2011, at about 11-\n11.30 am, DW1 left his home to purchase some plumbing material at\nKotla Mubarakpur. \nHe returned back to his home at about 1-1.30 pm.\nAfter reaching his home, he knocked the door of his bedroom for\nabout 15 minutes but, Pinki did not respond. When DW1 inquired the\nreason from his family members, they told him that Pinki had not\nopened the door of her bedroom ever since he left the house. After\nthat, he went to the backyard of his house and peeped inside his\nroom from the window, he saw the deceased hanging from the ceiling\nfan of the room. After hearing hue and cry raised by DW1, his\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.63/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n neighbour namely Sandeep also came there. However, before\nSandeep reached there, he (DW1) had broken the window with the\nhelp of some iron object. Thereafter, DW1 took down the dead body\nof his wife from the ceiling fan and unlocked the door which was\nbolted from inside. With the help of one Deshraj, who was his\nacquaintance, DW1e took his wife to hospital. During investigation,\nwhile he and his father were in police station, IO had taken his\nsignatures on certain blank papers.\n\n91. The defence plea also find supports from the testimony of\nPW10 Sandeep who has also deposed that he had never seen any\nfight between the couple and even on the fateful day, when he heard\nnoise coming from the accused's house he reached to the house of\naccused Rahul where he found Pinki was on the bed and all family\nmembers were crying.\n\n92. From the above material on record, I am of the considered\nview that there was no abetment on the part of accused persons in\ncommission of suicide by the deceased as alleged by the prosecution.\nThe defence plea that fight occurred on account of deceased's\nconsistent demand for separate accommodation also seems probable\nin view of deposition of deceased's mother wherein she also admitted\nthat her daughter had been asking her husband for separate\naccommodation. As such, neither the prosecution has been able to\nprove the 'cruelty' within the meaning of \nSection 498A\n IPC on the part\nof accused persons so as to attract the presumption of \nSection 113A\n\nof Indian Evidence Act nor the material on record is sufficient to even\n\nFIR No.167/11 Page No.64/65\n\nSt. Vs. Rahul Verma\n etc.\n make out a case of abetment within the meaning of \nSection 107\n IPC.\n\n93. Having regard to above discussion, prosecution has\nmiserably failed to bring home the guilt against any of the accused for\nany of the alleged offences. Accordingly, all accused persons are\nacquitted of all the offences punishable\n u/s 498A\n/\n304B\n/\n306\n/\n34\n IPC.\nBail bond in terms of \nSection 437-A\n Cr.P.C. are taken on record.
