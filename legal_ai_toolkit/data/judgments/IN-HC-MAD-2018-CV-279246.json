In W.P.(MD) Nos.16455, 16456 and 16458 of 2018 the\n\npetitioners are still working as Vocational Instructors. In W.P.(MD) Nos.\n\n16457, 16459 to 16461 and 16433 of 2018, the respective petitioners have\n\nretired from service.\n\n3. Since their services have been brought to time scale of pay\n\nafter some years only from that date, their services have been calculated\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nfor the purpose of pensionary benefits. Their grievance appears to be in\n\nspite of the amendment having been brought under Rule 11(4) of the Tamil\n\nNadu Pension Rules, the past services rendered by them, as either single\n\ntime or part time Vocational Instructors had not been taken into account for\n\nthe purpose of pensionary benefits.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the\n\nissue raised in these batch of cases have already been decided by a number\n\nof decisions of this Court and in this regard, the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners have also relied upon a recent judgment of Mine dated\n\n09.07.2018 in W.P.(MD) No.14365/2014 etc batch, in the matter of\n\nA.Ramalingam v. State of Tamil Nadu\nand three others.\n\n5. I have heard the learned counsel for the respective petitioners\n\nand also the learned Special Government Pleader, Government Advocate for\n\nthe official respondents and learned standing counsel for the Accountant\n\nGeneral and I have also gone through the materials placed before this\n\nCourt.\n\n6. As has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the\n\nparties, the issue raised in these batch of cases is no more res integra, as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthese issues have already been considered and decided by this Court. After\n\nhaving considered all those aspects, I have passed the order in the\n\naforementioned judgment in\nA.Ramalingam\n's case on 09.07.2018.\n\n7. For the sake of better understanding and clarity, the relevant\n\nportion of my order is extracted hereunder:\n\n“11.I have heard the said submissions\nmade by the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n12.As has been rightly submitted by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, the issue raised\nin this batch of writ petitions has already been\ndecided in number of cases by this Court.\nIn this\nregard, one of the earliest decision of the learned\nJudge of this Court was made in W.P.(MD)No.16771\nof 2013 in the matter of\nV.Ragavan Vs. State of\nTamil Nadu\nrepresented by its Secretary,\nSchool Education Department and others. In\n\nthe said decision\n, the learned Judge has dealt with\nthe similar issue and has given his verdict after\nexhaustively discussed the various grounds raised\nby both sides. In this regard, the following\nparagraph of\nthe said decision\ncan be usefully\nreferred to:-\n\n“3.The petitioner was appointed\nas a single part time Vocational teacher on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n08.10.1980 and he was regularised on\n01.04.1990 in such capacity. Thereafter,\nhe was promoted as P.G.Assistant\n(Commerce) and retired from service on\n30.03.2013 on attaining the age of\nsuperannuation. The Government as well\nas the private schools were engaging\nnumber of qualified persons as Teachers\nfor the Vocational subjects either as Double\npart time or Single part time Teachers\naccording to their needs. All of them were\nemployed indefinitely for years together.\nAfter repeated representations and\nagitations, the Government, in order to\nbring them under time scale of pay in a\nphased manner, directed to fill up 800\nposts for the Vocational Instructors in\nG.O.Ms.No.712 Education Department\ndated 28.05.1990 by appointing them as\nDouble part time Teachers. Further,\nG.O.No.68 dated 20.03.2007 was passed\nstating that the Vocational Teachers can\nbeen appointed on par with B.T.Assistants.\nAfter the retirement of the petitioner, the\nservice rendered by him as part time\nVocational Teacher from 08.10.1980 to\n31.03.1990 was not taken into account\nwhile calculating the pension. Under\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsimilar circumstances, this Court in\nW.P.No.39177 of 2002 dated 16.04.2009\ndirected the respondents to count 50% of\nthe part time service rendered by the\npetitioner therein for the purpose of\ncalculating the pension. A writ appeal filed\nchallenging the said order, in W.A.No.1702\nof 2010 was dismissed on 20.09.2010.\nFurther appeal preferred before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court also came to be\ndismissed. Therefore, the petitioner is\nalso entitled to similar relief.”\n\n13.The learned Judge, after having taken\ninto account the earlier decision rendered in this\nregard, which had been taken on appeal by way of\nintra Court appeal, wherein also, the view of the\nlearned Single Judge was confirmed and the same\nwas also taken to the Hon'ble Apex Court by filing\nSLP, the Hon'ble Apex Court also dismissed the said\nSLP, confirming the view taken by the High Court,\nhas allowed the said writ petition.\n\n14.When I had an occasion to consider the\nsimilar issue in W.P.(MD)Nos.256 and 257of 2015 in\nthe case of\nP.Natarajan and another Vs. the State of\nTamil Nadu\nrepresented by its Secretary, School\nEducation Department and others, I have\nconsidered\nthe said decision\nof the learned Judge\n\nreferred to above\n, in the teeth of the amended Rule\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n11(4) of the Rules, 1978, which reads thus:-\n\n“In the said Rules in Rule 11,\nafter sub-rule (3), the following sub-rule\nshall be added namely:-\n\n“(4)Half of the service rendered\nunder the State Government in non-\nprovincialised service, consolidated pay,\nhonorarium or daily wages basis on or after\n1st January 1961 in respect of Government\nemployees absorbed in regular service\nbefore 1st April 2003 shall be counted for\nretirement benefits, along with regular\nservice, subject to the following conditions,\nnamely:-\n\n(i)Service rendered in non-\n\nprovincialised service, consolidated pay,\nhonorarium or daily wages basis shall be in\na job involving whole time employment;\n\n(ii)Service rendered shall be on\nconsolidated pay, honorarium or daily\nwages paid on monthly basis and\n\nsubsequently absorbed in regular service\nunder the State Government.\n\n(iii)Service rendered in non-\n\nprovincialised service, consolidated pay,\nhonorarium or daily wages basis shall be\nfollowed by absorption in regular service\nbefore 1st April 2003 without a break:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nProvided that this sub-rule is\napplicable to all employees who rendered\nservice under the State Government in\nnon-provincilised service, consolidated pay,\nhonorarium or daily wages basis on or after\n1st January 1961 and absorbed in regular\nservice before 1st April 2003:\n\nProvided further that wherever\nthere was break in service before their\nabsorption in regular service before 1st\nApril 2003, the same shall be specifically\ncondoned by the orders of the Head of\nDepartments, in which the employees were\nregularly absorbed and such period of\nbreak shall not count for the purpose of\npensionary benefits.”\n\n15.In\nthe said judgment\nin W.P.(MD)Nos.\n256 and 257 of 2015 cited supra, after having\nconsidered the submissions made on behalf of the\nGovernment that, the cases decided in favour of the\nemployees and also the order complied with by the\nrespondents cannot be taken as precedent, I passed\nthe following order:-\n\n“12.The learned Judge in\nthe said\ndecision\ndated 09.04.2014, made in W.P.\n(MD) Nos.16771 to 16775 of 2013 etc.,\nbatch has in fact discussed this issue\nexhaustively and has given a detailed\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ninterpretation as to how the very word\n'whole time employment' as employed in\nRule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules\nhas to be interpreted. The learned Judge\nhas given a complete answer to the\nobjections raised by the respondents\nherein in paragraphs 26 to 29 of\nthe said\njudgment\n, which have already been\nextracted herein above. The learned Judge\nhas also made a reference that Rule 11(4)\nof the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules itself was\nimpliedly overruled by the Division Bench\nof this Court in W.A.No.1702 of 2010 dated\n20.09.2010.\n\n14.Yet another factor in the said\nbatch of cases cited supra is that, all those\npetitioners were worked as part-time\nVocational Instructors. For the said part-\ntime Vocational Instructors, though the\ntiming was restricted either to have 2.00\np.m. to 5.00 p.m. or 10.00 a.m. to 1.00\np.m. or like that cannot be construed that\nthose people had worked only in that time\nand for the remaining time, they left the\ninstitution. This issue has been\nexhaustively discussed by the learned\nJudge in\nthe said decision\n(cited supra).\nThe word 'whole time employment' was\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nalso to be considered in a particular\nmanner, has also been discussed and\ndecided by the learned Judge in\nthe said\ndecision\n. In this regard it was specifically\nheld that even though the job is only for a\nfew hours the teacher had to wait in the\nschool and present for the whole day\nsigning attendance for both sessions. This\nfactor has been specifically discussed and\ndecided by the learned Judge.\n\n15.Across the Bar, it was also\ninformed that\nthe said judgment\nwas also\nimplemented. It is also informed across the\nbar that as against some similar decisions\nmade by this Court, the State had gone\nupto Supreme Court and the S.L.P. filed by\nthe State Government has been dismissed.\nThough specific reference was not given by\nthe petitioners side, the said submissions\nmade by them are not disputed from the\nrespondents side.\n\n16.Moreover, in one such case,\nthis Court in W.P.No.4556 of 2007 by order\ndated 29.07.2011, a direction was given to\nthe respondents that 50% of the past\nservice should be taken into account for\nthe pensionary benefits. The said order of\nthis Court dated 29.07.2011 has been\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nimplemented by the Government through\nG.O.(4D) No.19 School Education\nDepartment dated 04.11.2014.\n\n17.The defence now taken by the\nlearned Government Advocate that this\nkind of isolated cases cannot be accepted.\nWhen similarly placed persons are not\ntreated equally, that also would amount\ndiscrimination. Therefore, the provisions\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India\ncan very well be invoked in this case.\nTherefore, such kind of discrimination that\ntoo from the State Government cannot be\naccepted and permitted.\n\n18.It is an admitted fact that\nthese two petitioners were working as\npart-time Vocational Instructors for longer\nyears. Only after several years they were\nbrought under full-time Vocational\nInstructors by regularising their services.\nThough both the petitioners are getting\npensions, since their past 50% service has\nnot been taken into account they are\ngetting a very meagre pension.\n\nConsidering these aspects, legislators\nthemselves though it fit to make\namendment in the Rule. That is why\n\namendment in Rule 11(4) came into the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nstatutory book. The normal rule of\ninterpretation of statutory Rule is to be\ngiven effect when specific Rule was\nbrought in by way of beneficial rule. Rule\n11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules has\nbeen brought in by way of beneficial rule\nfor the benefit of those who have rendered\nunblemished service for several years and\ngoing without getting any pensionary\nbenefits. Therefore, the said Rule cannot\nbe subjected to a different interpretation\nas has been sought for by the respondents\nside. Therefore, this Court is of the view\nthat Rule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension\nRules certainly would give leverage to the\npetitioners i.e., 50% of their past service,\nwhen they were working as part-time\nVocational Instructors, shall be taken into\naccount for the purpose of pensionary\nbenefits.\n\n19.For all the reasons and\ndiscussions made above, this Court is of\nthe firm view that the petitioners succeed\nin these Writ Petitions and they are entitled\nto the mandamus as sought for in these\nWrit Petitions.\n\n20.In the result, these Writ\nPetitions are allowed and the respondents\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nare directed to take into consideration 50%\nof the past services of the petitioners when\nthey were working as part-time Vocational\nInstructors. Based on such service, the\npensionary benefits of the petitioner shall\nbe recalculated and the recalculated\npension shall be continued to be paid to\nthe petitioners. It is needless to state that\nwhen the pension is recalculated from their\ndate of retirement till payment, arrears\nshall also be paid to them. The aforesaid\nexercise shall be completed within a period\nof three months from the date of receipt of\na copy of this order.\n\n21.With these directions, these\ntwo Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs.”\n\n16.In the recent judgment of the Hon'ble\nDivision Bench of this Court in W.A.No.882 of 2017\netc., batch, in the case of The Government of\nTamil Nadu, represented by its Secretary to\nGovernment,- School Education Department\nand others Vs. K.Pachaiyappan and others, the\nDivision Bench, after having gone through the issue\nonce again, has passed the following order:-\n\n“15.In terms of the above discussions,\nwe dispose of the writ appeals as under:-\n\n(i)50% of the services rendered\nby the respondents herein, as Part Time\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nVocational Instructorss (either as Single\nPart Time or Double Part Time Vocational\nInstructors), shall be counted for the\npurpose of computing pension and other\nretiral benefits.\n\n(ii)The above said benefit shall be\nextended only to the respondents in these\nwrit appeals and for the persons similarly\nsituated like that of the respondents\nherein, whose cases are pending before\nthis Court. Thus it is made clear that the\nabove said benefit shall not be extended to\nany other future cases that may be filed on\nthis account, on the ground of delay and\nlaches, since all along they have not come\nup before this Court and remained as\nfence-sitters. It is also needless to point\nout that allowing such cases would amount\nto opening the pandora's box, touching\nupon the financial implications of the\nState.”\n\n17.The learned Special Government\nPleader heavily relied upon the aforesaid\nobservation made by the Division Bench of this\nCourt that, the benefit extended in the said batch of\ncases shall be applicable only to those parties and\nthe similar benefit shall not be extended to any other\nfuture case that may be filed before this Court, on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe ground of delay and latches. Since the said\nobservation of the Division Bench has been heavily\nrelied upon by the learned Special Government\nPleader, this Court wants to deal with this issue also.\n\n18.First of all, number of cases in this\nbatch, have already been filed, prior to the said\ndecision rendered by the Division Bench on\n06.04.2018 and were pending before this Court.\n\n19.Further, it is a settled proposition of law\nthat, in service matters, if the similarly placed\npersons, who are entitled to get the benefit under\nlaw, having been denied the benefit, even though in\nthis regard already a decision has been rendered by\nthe Court of law and the same is implemented, the\nvery same relief shall also be extended to all\nsimilarly placed persons irrespective of the fact,\nwhether they approached the Court or not, if the law\ndeclared by the Court is judgement in rem.\n\n20.Insofar as the declaration made by this\nCourt in number of decisions, as has been referred\nto above, which were confirmed by the Division\nBench of this Court and subsequently, by the Hon'ble\nApex Court and also with regard to the entitlement\nof pensionary benefits of the Teachers / employees,\nwho had rendered continuous / unblemished\nservices for several years, either as part time or full\ntime or temporary or adhoc basis, by taking note of\nthe 50% of the said services they rendered, prior to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthey brought in under regular time scale of pay or\nabsorption, such entitlement was declared by the\nCourt of law, which shall be the judgment in rem. If\nthe law is declared by the Courts and similar\npensionary benefits, having been declared by the\nCourt of law and having been conferred to several\nsuch similarly placed persons by employer /\nGovernment, then, certainly this Court can extend\nthose benefits for similarly placed, who seek such\nremedy by approaching this Court.\n\n21.Moreover, the cause of action arose in\nthese kind of cases are continuous cause of action as\neach of the petitioners, who are the erstwhile\nemployees of the respective employer / State, would\nbe entitled to get the pensionary benefits till their\nlife time. Thereafter, the legal heirs would be\nentitled to get the family pension benefits.\n\n22.Therefore, the benefits accrued on\nthem, which have been claimed before this Court, by\nway of this litigations, are continuous in nature.\nTherefore, once the continuous cause of action is\navailable for litigant, he / she can approach the\nCourt of law at any point of time.\n\n23. If the judgment is in rem, the benefit of\nthe judgment to other similarly placed or situated\npersons can be extended and in this regard, the plea\nof delay/laches or expiry of limitation can be\ncondoned.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n24. Emphasizing the said principle, the\nHon'ble Apex Court in 1997 (6) SCC 721 in the\nmatter of\nK.C.Sharma and others v. Union of\nIndia and others\nheld as follows:\n\n“3. This appeal is directed against\nthe judgment of the Principal Bench of the\nCentral Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter\nreferred to as 'the Tribunal') dated July 25,\n1994 in O.A. No. 774 of 1994. The appellants\nwere employed as guards in the Northern\nRailway and they retired as guards during the\nperiod between 1980 and 1988. They felt\naggrieved by the notifications dated December\n5, 1988 whereby Rule 2544 of the Indian\nRailways Establishment Code was amended\nand for the purpose of calculation of average\nemoluments the maximum limit in respect of\nRunning Allowances was reduced from 75% to\n45% in respect of period from January 1, 1973\nto March 31, 1979 and to 55% for the period\nfrom April 1, 1979 onwards.\n\n4. The validity of the retrospective\namendments introduced by the impugned\nnotifications dated December 5, 1988 had been\nconsidered by the Full Bench of the Tribunal in\nits judgment dated December 16, 1993 in O.A.\nNo. 395-403 of 1993 and connected matters\nand the said notifications in so far as they gave\nretrospective effect to the amendments were\nheld to be invalid as being violative a Articles\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n14 and 16 of the Constitution. Since the\nappellants were adversely affected by the\nimpugned amendments, they sought the\nbenefit of the Full Bench of the Tribunal by\nfiling representations before the Railway\nAdministration. Since they failed to obtain\nredress, they filed the application (O.A. NO.\n774 of 1994) seeking relief before the Tribunal\nin April 1994. The said application of the\nappellants was dismissed by the Tribunal by\nthe impugned judgment on the view that the\napplication was barred by limitation. The\nTribunal refused to condone the delay in the\nfiling of the said applications.\n\n5. The correctness of the decision of\nthe Full Bench of the Tribunal has been\naffirmed by this Court in\nChairman, Railway\nBoard & Ors. V. C.R. Rangadhamaiah & Ors.,\nCivil Appeals Nos\n. 4174-4182 of 1995 and\nconnected matters decided today.\n\n6. Having regarding to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, we are of the view\nthat this was a fit case in which the Tribunal\nshould have condoned the delay in the filing of\nthe application and the appellants should have\nbeen given relief in the same terms as was\ngranted by the Full Bench of the Tribunal. The\nappeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned\njudgment of the Tribunal is set aside, the delay\nin filing of O.A. No. 774 of 199 is condoned and\nthe said application is allowed. The appellants\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwould be entitled to the same relief in matter\nof pension as has been granted by the Full\nBench of the Tribunal in its judgment dated\nDecember 16, 1993 in O.A. Nos. 395-403 of\n1993 and connected matters. No order as to\ncosts.”\n\n25. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2006)\n2 SCC 747 in the matter of\nState of Karnataka\nand others v. C.Lalitha\n, has made the following\nobservations:\n\n“29.Service jurisprudence evolved by\nthis Court from time to time postulates that all\npersons similarly situated should be treated\nsimilarly. Only because one person has\napproached the court that would not mean that\npersons similarly situated should be treated\ndifferently.\n\n26. Insofar as the principle that, seeking\nredressal against the denial of service benefits, for\nwhich, the employee is entitled to, and if it is the\ncontinuing cause of action, the question of\nlimitation/delay does not arise in those cases, where\nthe employee seek for such benefit, which has\nalready been given to similarly placed persons,\nCourts have taken the view in favour of the\nemployees.\n\n27. To emphasize the said principle, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in (2010) 12 SCC 538 in\nthe matter of State of Madhya Pradesh and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nothers v. Yogendra Srivatsava\nhas held as follows:\n\n“16. The Tribunal directed payment\nof the difference in NPA to respondents from\ntheir respective dates of appointment. The\nrespondents were appointed from 1982\nonwards. The respondents had approached the\nTribunal long after their appointment, that is,\nin 1998 or thereafter.\n\n17. The appellants contended that\nthe claims were therefore barred by limitation.\n\nIt was pointed out that the respondents were\npaid NPA at a fixed rate as stipulated in the\nappointment orders and NPA was increased\nonly when it was revised by Government orders\nfrom time to time; that respondents accepted\nsuch NPA without protest; and that therefore,\nthey cannot, after periods varying from 5 to 15\nyears, challenge the fixation of NPA or contend\nthat they are entitled to NPA at a higher rate,\nthat is 25% of their pay.\n\n18.We cannot agree. Where the issue\nrelates to payment or fixation of salary or any\nallowance, the challenge is not barred by\nlimitation or the doctrine of laches, as the\ndenial of benefit occurs every month when the\nsalary is paid, thereby giving rise to a fresh\ncause of action, based on continuing wrong.\n\nThough the lesser payment may be a\nconsequence of the error that was committed\nat the time of appointment, the claim for a\nhigher allowance in accordance with the Rules\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(prospectively from the date of application)\ncannot be rejected merely because it arises\nfrom a wrong fixation made several years prior\nto the claim for correct payment. But in\nrespect of grant of consequential relief of\nrecovery of arrears for the past period, the\nprinciple relating to recurring and successive\nwrongs would apply. Therefore the\nconsequential relief of payment of arrears will\nhave to be restricted to a period of three years\nprior to the date of the original application.\n[See:\nM.R. Gupta vs. Union of India\n-\n1995 (5)\nSCC 628, and Union of India vs. Tarsem\nSingh\n2008.”\n\n28. More than one Division Bench of this\nCourt considered the issue raised in these batch of\ncases, as to whether the single or double part time\nVocational Instructors were entitled to seek the\nbenefit of reckoning the 50% of the past services\nrendered by them till they brought under time scale\nof pay and absorption, in view of Rule 11, especially,\nRule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978.\nHaving considered and decided in favour of the\nemployees and against those decisions, though State\npreferred Special Leave Petitions, the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt by dismissing the said S.L.Ps. affirmed the\ndecisions of this Court and following which\n,\nthe said\ndecision\nrendered by the Writ Court as affirmed by\nthe Division Bench of this Court as well as the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nHon'ble Apex Court has been implemented. When\nthat being so, whether diagonally opposite view can\nbe taken by a subsequent decision to deny such\nbenefits to those, who had not immediately come\nand approached this Court subsequently and in this\nregard, whether a cut off date can be fixed to\nprevent the aggrieved persons/employees/litigant to\napproach the Court, can no longer be an issue\nwithout any resolvement.\n\n29.\nIn this regard, the Hon'ble Apex Court\nhas given a strong observation in 2015 (8) SCC\n129 in\nP.Suseela and others v. University Grants\nCommission and others\n, where the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt has made the following observations:\n\n“25.In SLPs (C) Nos.3054-55 of 2014,\na judgment of the same High Court dated\n06.01.2014 again by a Division Bench arrived\nat the opposite conclusion. This is also a\nmatter which causes us some distress. A\nDivision Bench judgment of the same High\ncourt is binding on a subsequent Division\nBench. The subsequent Division bench can\neither follow it or refer such judgment to the\nChief Justice to constitute a Full Bench if it\ndiffers with it. We do not appreciate the\nmanner in which this subsequent judgment\n(even though it has reached the right result),\nhas dealt with an earlier binding Division\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBench judgment of the same High Court.”\n\n30. That apart, it has been brought to the\nnotice of this Court by the learned members of the\nBar, who supported the case of the petitioners\nherein that, at least in two Division Benches of this\nCourt, in recent decisions, the view taken by this\nCourt in a number of decisions on the issue, raised\nin this batch of cases, have been reaffirmed and\namplified.\n\n31. The first decision is by a Division Bench\nof this Court made in W.A.No.51 of 2018 etc\nbatch dated 27.03.2018 in the matter of\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu represented by its\nPrincipal Secretary to Government, Forest and\nEnvironment Department and others v.\nK.Sakthivel and others.\n\n32. In the said Division Bench judgment,\nthe issue of calculating the 50% of past services\nrendered by temporary employees (in that case, it\nwas Plot Watcher), was considered in detail, where\nthe earlier judgments of this Court had been taken\nnote of and ultimately, the Division Bench concluded\nthat the said benefits conferred to the private\nrespondents, who were the petitioners before the\nWrit Court were affirmed/confirmed.\n\n33. The Division Bench in the said\njudgment has made the following decision:\n\n“24.The validity of fixing such a cut-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\noff date was the subject matter of\nconsideration in the case of\nP.Chinniyan v. State\nof Tamil Nadu\nrep. by its Secretary to\nGovernment, Forest and Environment (FR-2)\nDepartment, Chennai ? 600 009 and Others\nreported in (2014)6 MLJ 316 and the Court\nheld that the prescription of cut-off date as\n01.04.2003 for absorption into regular service\nunder Rule 11(4) to count half of the service\nrendered prior to absorption has no rational\nbasis and the same is arbitrary and violative\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n25.It was further held that Rule 11(4)\nis totally redundant in view of Rule 11(2),\nwhich does not prescribe any cut-off date as to\nabsorption into regular service. Therefore, it\nwas held that the benefits given under Rule\n11(2) cannot be deprived and taken away by\nRule 11(4) and thus the cut-off date of\nabsorption as 01.04.2003 prescribed in Rule\n11(4) should be ignored, otherwise it will lead\nto grave injustice. The Court took note of the\nfacts of the said case, where the petitioner\ntherein was working on daily wages from 1967\ntill 2003 and when he was absorbed as a Mali,\nhe has served for more than 36 years before\nhis absorption in regular service. The said\ndecision in the case of B.Chinnaiyan was\nfollowed in the cases of W.P.Nos.21355 and\n21356 of 2017, dated 08.09.2017. In\nthe said\ndecision\n, reference was made to the decision of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Union\nof India v. K.Punniyakottai reported in 2014 (2)\nCTC 777, where more or less an identical case\nwas considered arising under the CCS\n(Pension) Rules, 1972 in respect of the\nemployees of the Central Government.\n\nTherefore, the Court concluded that 50% of the\nservices rendered by the employee on daily\nwages should be considered for computing\ntotal length of service.\n\n26.The two Division Benches in the\ncases of the State of Tamil Nadu rep. by its\nSecretary to Government, (FR-2) Forest and\nEnvironment Department, Fort St. George,\nChennai ? 600 009 v. S.Jayaraman [W.A.No.\n1482 of 2016, dated 22.01.2018] and\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu rep. by its\nSecretary, Environment and Forest\nDepartment, Fort St. George, Chennai ? 600\n009 v. S.Thillai Govindan [W.A.No.1733 of\n2017, dated 13.02.2018] took note of the\ndecision in the case of B.Chinnaiyan, wherein\nthe cut-off date was quashed, dismissing the\nappeals filed by the Government. Thus, the\ndecision in the case of B.Chinnaiyan has\nreceived the seal of approval of the Hon'ble\nDivision Benches. Thus, in the present factual\nposition, whether the appellants are justified in\ncontending that the earlier Judgments are not\nbinding upon them, despite most of them\nhaving been implemented by the appellants.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n27.In our considered view, the stand\ntaken by the appellants is wholly unsustainable\nas the Special Leave Petitions filed against\nsome of the decisions of the Hon'ble Division\nBench was not dismissed in limini, but were\ndismissed on the ground that there were no\nmerits in the appeal. Therefore, the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nassigned reasons and it is not a dismissal of a\nSpecial Leave Petition simpliciter. Therefore,\nthe decisions bind the Government and\nconsequently, the decisions relied on by the\nlearned Special Government Pleader in the\ncases of Harpal Kaur Chahal (Smt) v. Director,\nPunjab Instructions, Punjab and Another\nreported in 1995 Supp (4) SCC 706 and\nCol.B.J.Akkara (Retd.) v. Government of India\nand Others reported in (2006)11 SCC 709 are\ndistinguishable on facts.\n\n28.The Judgment of the Division\nBench in the case of Principal Secretary, Social\nWelfare and Nutritious Meal Programme\nDepartment, Fort. St. George, Chennai and\nOthers v. M.Palanikani [W.A(MD)No.587 of\n2014, etc. batch, dated 03.12.2014] does not\nrender any support to the case of the\nappellants, as the said case arose out of an\nappointment to the posts of\nTeachers/Supervisor Grade II and Rural\nWelfare Officers from those who were\nfunctioning as Noon Meal Organisers in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSchools as well as Child Welfare Organizers in\nIntegrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).\nThus, the appointment in those cases, were\nfresh appointment to a different department,\nunlike the case on hand. Further, the cases on\nhand are not cases seeking retrospective\nregularisation, as sought for in the case of the\nState of Tamil Nadu, rep. by the Secretary,\nDepartment of Health and Family Welfare, Fort\nSt. George, Chennai and Others v. T.Gopal and\nOthers reported in 2016 Writ L.R. 1160.\n\n29.As noticed above, the decision to\nbring the writ petitioners into regular time\nscale of pay, was taken in the year 1999 and\nthe writ petitioners were extended the benefits\nin the year 2009. By then, several of them, had\ncompleted more than 30 years of service, as\ndaily wagers. The past service was reckoned\nfor the purpose of justifying their absorption\ninto regular time scale of pay. Therefore, it will\nbe a misnomer to state that the appointments\nmade to the post of Forest Watchers is a fresh\nappointment. The stand taken by the appellants\nin this regard is to be rejected by merely\nreferring to the preamble portion of G.O.\n(Ms)No.64, dated 08.03.1999 and G.O.(Ms)No.\n95, dated 07.08.2009. Therefore, the said\ncontention raised by the appellants required to\nbe outrightly rejected.\n\n30.There can be no denying the fact\nthat the appellants themselves have\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nimplemented various decisions of the Division\nBenches, in some of which, no appeals were\npreferred to the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\nTherefore, now to take a different stand in the\npresent appeals as well as writ petitions would\nimpermissible and a situation cannot be\nallowed to prevail causing discrimination\nbetween similarly placed persons. Thus, in the\nfacts and circumstances of the case and in the\nlight of the above discussion, we find that the\nState has not made any grounds to interfere\nwith the orders passed in the writ petitions and\ntherefore, the writ appeals are liable to be\ndismissed and the similar writ petitions are\nliable to be allowed.\n\n31.In the result,\n\n(i)W.A(MD)Nos.51 of 2018, 1431 and\n1432 of 2017 are dismissed, confirming the\norders passed in W.P(MD)Nos.22833 of 2016,\n15903 of 2012 and 22832 of 2016. No costs.\nConsequently, connected C.M.P(MD)No.262 of\n2018, 10923 and 10927 of 2017 are dismissed.\n\n(ii)All other writ petitions filed by the\nPlot Watchers are allowed, as prayed for. No\ncosts. Consequently, connected W.M.P(MD)Nos.\n4753 and 4754 of 2018 are closed.\n\n(iii)The appellants/respondents are\ndirected to verify the service particulars of all\nthe writ petitioners and count 50% of the\nservices rendered by them on temporary basis\nand consequently refix their pension within a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nperiod of four months from the date of receipt\nof a copy of this Judgment/ order.\n\n(iv)In case, where the\npetitioners/employees had died, the benefit\nshall accrue to their legal heirs and the\npayment shall be effected in the name of one of\nthe legal heirs after obtaining proper\nauthorisation from the other legal heirs.\n\n(v)So far as W.P(MD)No.6878 of 2017\nis concerned, though the petitioner seeks for\npromotion to the post of Plot Watcher, the same\nis a misnomer as it is not a promotion, but\nabsorption in the post of Forest Watcher.\nTherefore, whatever the relief granted to the\nother petitioners, shall enure in favour of this\npetitioner also and the writ petition stands\ndisposed of accordingly. No costs.\n\n(vi)In W.P(MD)No.22510 of 2015,\napart from seeking for regularisation of the\nservices by counting 50% of the services\nrendered as Plot Watcher, the petitioner seeks\nfor pensionary benefits also. This Court has\ndirected that the benefit of 50% of the services\nshould be reckoned, while calculating the\nlength of service. Thus, if the petitioner has\nattained the age of superannuation, it goes\nwithout saying that consequential revision in\npensionary benefits are required to be settled\nand the writ petition stands disposed of\naccordingly. No costs.”\n\n34. Yet another decision of another Division\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBench of this Court, which is latest in this regard is\nthe decision made in WA(MD) No.844 of 2018\ndated 03.07.2018 in the matter of State of Tamil\nNadu represented by Secretary, School\nEducation Department and others v. C.Jeya\nRani Gnana Devi.\n\n35. In the said judgment, dated 03.07.2018,\nthe Division Bench of this Court has passed the\nfollowing order:\n\n“4. When the matter is taken up for\nhearing, the learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondent submitted that the issue involved in\nthe present writ appeal is covered by the\ndecision of a Division Bench of this Court dated\n21.04.2017 made in W.A(MD)Nos.392, 393 and\n389 of 2017 etc., batch, wherein the Division\nBench held as follows:\n\n“10. The Writ Court further observed\nthat in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble\nFirst Bench, the Rule itself stands impliedly\noverruled. That apart, it was held that if the\nbenefit is not granted, it would amount to\ndiscriminating the similarly placed persons.\nFurther, the Writ Court noted that the\nGovernment has chosen to extend certain\nbenefits in respect of part time workers as\nfound in G.O.Ms.No.39, 13.06.2011 and\ntherefore, the benefit cannot be denied to part\ntime vocational instructors by stating that the\nsaid Government Order is applicable to\npanchayat clerks and not to vocational\ninstructors.\n\n11. Learned Additional Government\nPleader after elaborately referring to the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nfactual matrix placed reliance on the decision\nof the Division Bench in the case of the\nPrincipal Secretary Social Welfare and\nNutritious Meal Programme Department and\nothers vs. M.Palanikani made in W.A.Nos.587\netc., batch dated 03.12.2014 and submitted\nthat the Division Bench has allowed the\nappeals and set aside the order passed by the\nlearned single Judge wherein relief was\ngranted to count 50% of the services in the\nnoon meal scheme.\n\n12.Firstly, we may point out that the\nterms of employment of staff in the noon meal\nscheme are not in pari materia with that of the\nterms of appointment of vocational instructors.\n\nThis fact cannot be denied by the appellants.\nFurthermore, in paragraph 21 of the said\njudgment, the Court framed the question which\nhas to be decided with a specific reference and\na cutt off date which had been fixed namely, on\n01.04.2003. Admittedly, all the writ petitioners\nwere appointed much prior to the said date and\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench is\nfactually distinguishable. Thus, we are of the\nconsidered view that the impugned order\nhaving been rendered by referring to and\nrelying upon the decisions of the Hon'ble First\nBench, we find no grounds to take a different\nview in the matter. Accordingly, the writ\nappeals are dismissed. No Costs. Consequently,\nconnected miscellaneous petitions are closed.”\n\n5. Mr.Baskarapandian, learned\nSpecial Government Pleader appearing for the\nappellants also fairly submitted that the issue\ninvolved in the present writ appeal is covered\nby the decision relied on by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent.\n\n6. In view of the submissions made\nby the learned counsel on either side, following\n\nthe judgment made in W.A(MD)Nos.392, 393\n\nand 389 of 2017 etc., batch dated 21.04.2017,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe writ appeal is liable to be dismissed and\naccordingly, the same is dismissed. No Costs.\nConsequently, connected Miscellaneous\nPetition is closed.”\n\n36. From the reading of the aforesaid\njudgments, especially, the later decisions rendered\nby two Division Benches of this Court, it become\nclear that, the view taken by this Court insofar as\nthe confirmation of benefit of calculating 50% of the\npast services rendered by the employees, who\nworked as Vocational Instructors or otherwise on\ntemporary basis before they brought in regular time\nscale of pay and regular absorption, had been\nconsistently followed by various Division Benches of\nthis Court.\n\n37. There had been earlier judgments of\nthe Division Benches and there had been later\njudgments of the Division Benches including the\nrecent one passed, just before a week or two. While\nso, the only Division Bench decision dated\n06.04.2018 made in W.A.No.882/2017, as has been\nrelied upon by the learned Special Government\nPleader takes a slightly different view, where also,\nthe principle in extending the said benefit had been\naccepted, but the only prohibition was that the same\nshall not be extended hereafter to any such\nemployee, who comes to the Court, after\n06.04.2018. In this regard, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners have relied upon a Full Bench\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njudgment of the Patna High Court reported in AIR\n1987 Patna 191, in Amarsingh Yadav and\nanother v. Shanti Devi and others.\n\n38. One of the question posed before the\nFull Bench for resolvement is as follows:\n\n“(1) Where there is a direct conflict\nbetween two decisions of the Supreme Court,\nrendered by co-equal Benches, which of them\nshould be followed by the High Court and the\nCourt below ?”\n\n39. After elaborate consideration, the Full\nBench has given its answer, which reads thus:\n\n“24. To conclude on this aspect, it is\nheld that where there is a direct conflict\nbetween two decisions of the Supreme Court\nrendered by co-equal Benches, the High Court\nmust follow that judgment which appears to it\nto state the law more elaborately and\naccurately. The answer to question (1) posed at\nthe outset is rendered in these terms.”\n\n40. Therefore, the principle was, as\nenunciated in the said Full Bench judgment of the\nPatna High Court that, if two conflicting decisions\nare available, rendered by co-equal benches, the\nHigh Court must follow the judgment, which appears\nto it to state the law more elaborately and\naccurately.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n41. If the said principle is applied to the\nfacts of the present case, except the decision dated\n06.04.2018 of a Division Bench of this Court, no\nother Division Bench either prior to or after to that,\nhas taken any different view, as the one taken in the\nsaid judgment and in all other Division Bench\njudgments, a uniform and consistent stand taken by\nthis Court was that, the benefit of taking into\naccount 50% of the services rendered by the\nemployees before they brought into regular service\nshall be the basis for calculating for the purpose of\npension and retiral benefits. Even in the said\njudgment dated 06.04.2018 in W.A.No.882/2017,\nthat view was accepted and endorsed by the said\nDivision Bench also, but the only embargo the\nDivision Bench has put in that, the said benefit\ncannot be extended to those who come to the Court\nhereafter. In order to meet out the said embargo,\nthe aforesaid judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court,\nas referred to above, with regard to the continuous\ncause of action and the benefit, which has been\ndeclared by the Court through a judgment in rem\nhas to be extended to similarly placed persons, had\nbeen quoted.\n\n42. In view of the settled legal position, as\nhas been declared in all these decisions, all these\npetitioners, even though filed writ petitions recently\nand some of them might have filed after 06.04.2018\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ni.e., the date, on which the aforesaid Division Bench\nJudgment had been rendered by this Court, in the\nopinion of this Court, are entitled to get the similar\nbenefits, as that of the benefits which have already\nbeen given to the number of similarly placed\nemployees / Teachers.\n\n43. Therefore, the observations made in the\naforesaid judgment made in W.A.No.882 of 2017 and\netc., batch, as has been heavily relied upon by the\nlearned Special Government Pleader in this regard,\nwould no way advance the case of the respondents\nand that no way be helpful to the respondents to\ndeny the lawful right of the petitioners, which have\nalready been accrued and has been continuously\naccruing every month because the pensionary\nbenefits are to be disbursed till the death of the\nemployee / death of the legal heirs. Therefore, the\nsaid objection raised by the respondents are liable to\nbe rejected, accordingly, they are rejected.\n\n44. In view of the aforesaid judgments,\nwherein the issue as has been put forth by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, having been\ndealt with and decided more than once by the Writ\nCourt and the same has been confirmed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court more than once and in\ncases, where SLP preferred before the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, wherein also the view taken by this\nCourt has been confirmed, all these petitioners are\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nentitled to, for calculating 50% of the past services,\nrendered by each of the petitioners in the respective\nemployment before they got absorbed by bringing\nthem under the time scale of pay irrespective of the\nyears of service, for the purpose of pensionary\nbenefits. Hence, these petitioners also shall be\nentitled to get the same benefits and accordingly, all\nthese writ petitions are fit to succeed.\n\n45. In the result, these writ petitions are\nallowed and the respective respondents in each of\nthe writ petitions are hereby directed to take into\naccount the 50% of the past services rendered by\neach of the petitioners either as Vocational\nInstructors or any other employment either as a Part\nTime / Full time / adhoc / temporary / daily wages\nemployees before they brought in under the regular\ntime scale of pay on permanent basis or absorption\nand by calculating the said 50% of their past service,\npension eligibility and pension enhancement or\ndifference of pay and pension shall be calculated\nand disbursed in favour of the respective petitioners.\nAfter fixing the revised pension by taking into\naccount the past 50% services, the revised pension\narrears shall be calculated and to be disbursed to\nthe petitioners within a period of 12 weeks from the\ndate of receipt of a copy of this order. It is needless\nto mention that the petitioners shall continue to\nreceive the revised pension.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n46. Insofar as W.P.(MD)Nos.6065 of 2016\nand 6789 of 2017 are concerned, the petitioners\nsince having not been paid any pension so far, the\naforesaid exercise shall be undertaken by the\nrespective respondents in that writ petitions also\nand the entire arrears of pension shall be disbursed\nto the said petitioners within the said time frame\nindicated above.\n\n47. Insofar as W.P.(MD)No.11896 of 2018 is\nconcerned, since the petitioner is the widow of the\nemployee, the pensionary benefits shall be\ncalculated, accordingly, as indicated, and arrears till\nthe death of the petitioner's husband shall be\ncalculated and thereafter, the family pension arrears\nshall be calculated and all the arrears shall be\ndisbursed to the petitioner i.e., the widow of the\nemployee, within the period of twelve weeks, from\nthe date of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\n48. With these directions all these writ\npetitions are allowed as indicated above. No costs.”\n\n8. Since the said issue has been considered and decided already\n\nin number of cases and in some of the cases, even though appeal filed\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Apex Court, the decision rendered by this Court has\n\nbeen confirmed and accordingly, in those cases, the orders passed by this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt have been complied with. When that being the position, since some\n\nof the petitioners herein are still working as Teachers and some of them\n\nhave already retired, and in both, the benefits now sought by these\n\npetitioners given raise to them as a continuous cause of action and\n\ntherefore, the accrued right on the part of the petitioners and it is still\n\naccruing every month, cannot be taken away merely by placing a\n\npredicament or impediment that those, who approaches this Court\n\nbelatedly, cannot be granted the relief or extended the similar relief\n\nextended to similar persons.\n\n9. In this regard, in the aforesaid decision of Mine, I have given a\n\ndetailed and thorough consideration on the case laws and in view of the\n\nsettled legal propositions, the said embargo, as has been taken by the\n\nlearned Special Government Pleader in this batch of cases, by citing the\n\nsaid Division Bench judgment dated 06.04.2018, cannot be applicable to\n\nthese cases also. Hence, this Court has no hesitation to grant the similar\n\nrelief, which have already been granted to similarly placed persons, to\n\nthese writ petitioners also.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n10. Accordingly, all these writ petitions are ordered in the terms\n\nof the said order dated 09.07.2018 by giving the following directions:\n\n“the respective respondents in each of the writ\npetitions are hereby directed to take into account the 50%\nof the past services rendered by each of the petitioners\neither as Vocational Instructors or any other employment\neither as a Part Time / Full time / adhoc / temporary /\ndaily wages employees before they brought in under the\nregular time scale of pay on permanent basis or absorption\nand by calculating the said 50% of their past service,\npension eligibility and pension enhancement or difference\nof pay and pension shall be calculated and disbursed in\nfavour of the respective petitioners. After fixing the\nrevised pension by taking into account the past 50%\nservices, the revised pension arrears shall be calculated\nand to be disbursed to the petitioners within a period of 12\nweeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It is\nneedless to mention that the petitioners shall continue to\nreceive the revised pension.”\n\nNo costs.\n\n26.07.2018\nIndex : Yes\nInternet : Yes\nta\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nR.SURESH KUMAR,J.\n\nta\n\nTo\n\n1.The Principal Secretary to Government,\nSchool Education Department,\nFort St.George, Chennai-600 009.\n\n2.The Director of School Education,\nDPI Complex, College Road,\nChennai-600 006.\n\n3.The Joint Director of School Education (Vocational),\nO/o. the Director of School Education,\nDPI Complex, College Road,\nChennai-600 006.\n\n4.The Chief Educational Officer,\nO/o.
