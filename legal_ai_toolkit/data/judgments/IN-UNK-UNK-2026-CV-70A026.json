Mr.A.Ramar\n Additional Public Prosecutor\n- - - - -\n\n:JUDGMENT\n\n*************\n[Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.NAGAMUTHU, J.]\n The appellant is the sole accused in S.C.No.369 of 2001, on the file\nof the learned Additional Sessions Judge, [Fast Track Court No.I], Tuticorin. He\nstood charged for offences under \nSections 341\n, \n302\n, \n326\n and \n506(ii)\n of the\nIndian Penal Code. By Judgment dated 07.10.2003, the Trial Court has convicted\nhim under all the charges. For the offence under \nSection 341\n of the Indian Penal\nCode, the Trial Court has sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\none month and to pay a fine of Rs.100/-, in default to undergo imprisonment for\none week, for the offence under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code, to undergo\nimprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default to undergo\nimprisonment for six months, for the offence under \nSection 326\n of the Indian\nPenal Code, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine\nof Rs.500/- in default to undergo imprisonment for six months and for the\noffence under \nSection 506(ii)\n of the Indian Penal Code, to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- in default to undergo\nimprisonment for one month. Challenging the said conviction and sentence, the\nappellant has come up with this Criminal Appeal.\n\n 2. The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:-\n\n The deceased, in this case, was one Mr.S.Shanmugavel. PW-1 is his\nwife and PW-2 is the son of the deceased. PW-3 is the father-in-law of PW-2. Two\nyears prior to the occurrence, there arose a dispute between the deceased and\nthe accused in respect of cutting of acacia trees. This resulted in a criminal\ncase against the deceased, PW-2, one Marimuthu and few others. This is projected\nas the motive for the occurrence.\n\n 2.1. On 29.03.2000, at about 10.00 AM, PW-1 and the deceased were\nproceeding through the land of one Annamalai Thevar. At that time, the accused\ncame there with a sickle in his hand. He shouted at the deceased saying that he\nwould not leave the deceased without wrecking vengeance. So saying, the accused\ncut the deceased with sickle. The deceased warded off the said attack by his\nhands. The blow fell on the right forehand. Then, the accused cut him on the\nright side of the abdomen of the deceased. The injury was so deep and the\nintestine protruded out. PW-1 attempted to rescue the deceased. Immediately, the\naccused cut PW-1 on her right hand, left hand, right shoulder and right upper\nhand, repeatedly with sickle. PW-2 and PW-3 were then working in a nearby field.\n\nOn hearing the alarm raised, they rushed towards the place of occurrence and\nwitnessed the entire occurrence. On seeing them, the accused criminally\nintimidated them by brandishing sickle against them. Then, the accused fled away\nfrom the scene of occurrence with the weapon.\n\n 2.2. PW-2 and PW-3, forthwith, took PW-1 and the deceased to the\nGovernment Medical College Hospital at Palayamkottai, Tirunelveli District. PW-\n12, Dr.S.Rajan, examined the deceased at 11.05 AM, on 29.03.2000. The deceased\ntold him that on 29.03.2000, at 10.00 AM, in a field at Agaram, he was attacked\nby a known person with sickle. The deceased was, at that time, fully conscious.\nHe noticed two injuries on his body as follows:-\n\n \"(i) A cut injury measuring 15 x 3 cm-traverse- on the right side of the\nabdomen.\n\n (ii) A cut injury on the right upper arm measuring 15 x 4 x 3 cm exposing\nthe bone.\"\n\nAccording to P.W.12, from out of the X-ray taken and on his own assessment, both\nthe injuries were grievous in nature.\n\n 2.3. On the same day, at 11.10 AM, he examined PW-1, who told that\nat 10.00 AM, on 29.03.2000, in a field at Agaram, she was attacked by a known\nperson with sickle. PW-12 noticed the following injuries:-\n\n \"1. A cut injury on the right arm above elbow measuring 2 X + cm.\n\n 2. A cut injury measuring 5 cm X + X + cm at the right shoulder.\n\n 3. A cut injury measuring 2 X 1 cm on the left arm.\n\n 4. A swelling on the middle of left arm.\"\n\n 2.4. X-ray was taken on PW-1, which revealed that the injuries 1 and\n2 were grievous in nature. PW-1 and the deceased were admitted in the hospital\nas inpatients. P.W.12 opined that the injuries on the deceased as well as on PW-\n1 would have been caused by a weapon, like sickle. He gave an intimation to the\npolice as well as to the learned Judicial Magistrate in respect of the same.\n\n 2.5. PW-17 was the then Judicial Magistrate No.6 at Tirunelveli. On\nreceipt of the intimation from the Hospital Authorities, he proceeded to the\nhospital at 12.05 PM. One Dr.Ramakrishnan was attending on the deceased.\nDr.Ramakrishnan opined that the deceased was conscious and was in a fit state of\nmind to make dying declaration. On his own assessment and also based on the\nopinion of Dr.Ramakrishnan, PW-17 was satisfied that the deceased was in a fit\nstate of mind to make dying declaration. Accordingly, he recorded the dying\ndeclaration given by the deceased, [vide EX-P26]. In the said dying declaration,\nthe deceased told that due to previous enmity, the accused cut him with sickle.\n[Dr.Ramakrishnan was not examined before the Trial Court, as he had gone\nabroad]. PW-15 was a Head Constable, attached to the Murappanadu Police Station.\nPW-16 was the then Sub - Inspector of Police, attached to the said Police\nStation. On receipt of intimation from the Hospital Authorities, PW-15 and PW-16\nproceeded to the hospital at 12.25 PM, on 29.03.2000. The deceased gave oral\ncomplaint to PW-16. Since PW-16 could not write, as he had met with an accident,\nPW-15 reduced the same into writing. EX-P1 is the statement. On returning to the\nPolice Station, PW-16 registered a case in Crime No.65 of 2000 under \nSections\n341\n, \n302\n, \n326\n and \n506(ii)\n of the Indian Penal Code. PW-16 forwarded the\nstatement, EX-P1 and the First Information Report, EX-P24 to the jurisdictional\nMagistrate. Then, he handed over the case diary to the Inspector of Police for\ninvestigation.\n\n 2.6. PW-18, the then Inspector of Police, attached to the\nMurappanadu Police Station, took up the case for investigation at 03.00 PM, on\n29.03.2000. He proceeded to the place of occurrence and prepared an Observation\nMahazer, EX-P3 and a Rough Sketch, EX-P27, showing the place of occurrence in\nthe presence of PW-4 and another witness. Then, he recovered bloodstained earth\nand sample earth from the place of occurrence under a mahazer in the presence of\nthe same witnesses. Then, he examined PW-2 to PW-4 and recorded their\nstatements. At 07.30 PM, he examined the deceased at the hospital and recorded\nhis statement. [The said statement, though a dying declaration, falling within\nthe sweep of \nSection 32\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has not been proved in\nevidence by the prosecution]. Then, he examined PW-1. He recovered the dress\nmaterials of PW-1 and the deceased.\n\n 2.7. On 31.03.2000, the accused surrendered before the learned\nJudicial Magistrate No.V, Tirunelveli. On the orders of the learned Judicial\nMagistrate, on 10.04.2000, PW-18 took the accused into his custody. On the same\nday, at 06.30 PM, while in the Police Station, the accused gave a voluntary\nconfession in the presence of PW-6 and another witness. In the said confession,\nhe had disclosed that he had hidden the sickle in his house. In pursuance of the\nsaid statement, he took PW-18 and the witnesses to his house and produced the\nsickle, [MO-1]. Then, he forwarded the accused to the Court for judicial remand\nand also produced the Material Objects before the Court.\n\n 2.8. While so, at 06.00 AM, on 22.04.2000, the deceased died in the\nhospital. PW-19 was the then Inspector of Police, attached to the Murappanadu\nPolice Station. On receipt of the death intimation from the Hospital\nAuthorities, he altered the case into one under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal\nCode. Then, he proceeded to the hospital and conducted inquest on the body of\nthe deceased between 10.00 AM and 12.30 PM. EX-P28 is the Inquest Report. During\ninquest, he again examined PW-1, PW-2 and few more witnesses and recorded their\nstatements. Then, he forwarded the dead body for postmortem. PW-13,\nDr.K.Selvaraj, was an Assistant Professor, Forensic Medicine, Tirunelveli\nMedical College Hospital, Tirunelveli. He conducted autopsy on the body of the\ndeceased between 12.50 PM and 1.50 PM, on 24.04.2000. He found the following\ninjuries:-\n\n \"1.Partly healed vertically oblique cut injury with evidence of suturing\non the right lateral abdomen, 16 X 5 CM entering into the abdominal cavity.\n\n 2. Sutured vertically oblique cut injury on the back, outer aspect of and\nfront of right forearm, 15 cm below the right elbow, measuring 15 cm X 5 cm X\nbone deep.\n\n On dissection: fracture of right radius with surrounding infection.\n\n 3. Sutured incised wound in the front of abdomen in the middle with\nproline sutures. 18 cm X 1 cm entering peritoneal cavity, through the lower part\nof the wound a loop of intestine seen protruding out. [end to end anastomosis of\nthe intestine has been done] [surgical procedure].\n\n 4. Durainage wounds on the right and left flanks of abdomen with\ncorrugated rubber drainage tubes in situ [surgical procedure].\"\n\n 2.9. He opined that the deceased would appear to have died of cut\ninjuries - abdomen and its complications. PW-19 collected the Postmortem\nCertificate and examined the doctor. Then, he made a request to the Court to\nforward the Material Objects for chemical examination. EX-P16 is the Chemical\nAnalyst Report and EX-P17 is the Serology Report. As per EX-P16, there was\nbloodstain found on the sickle [MO-1].\n\n 2.10. Finally, on completing the investigation, PW-19 laid charge\nsheet against the accused. The Trial Court framed charges under \nSections 341\n,\n\n302\n, \n326\n and \n506(ii)\n of the Indian Penal Code. The accused pleaded innocence,\nand therefore, he was put on trial. During trial, on the side of the\nprosecution, as many as nineteen witnesses were examined and twenty eight\ndocuments were exhibited, besides, five Material Objects.\n\n 3. Out of the said witnesses, PW-1 is the injured eye witness and\nPW-2 and PW-3 are the eye witnesses to the occurrence. They have vividly spoken\nto about the entire occurrence. PW-6 has spoken to about the recovery of MO-1,\nsickle on the disclosure statement made by the accused. PW-12 has spoken to the\nfact that he admitted PW-1 and the deceased as inpatients in the hospital. PW-13\nhas spoken to about the postmortem conducted by him and the cause of death. PW-\n15 and PW-16 have spoken to about the complaint made by the deceased and the\nregistration of the case. PW-17 has spoken to the fact that he recorded the\ndying declaration of the deceased. The others are the official witnesses.\n\n 4. When the above incriminating materials were put to the accused\nunder \nSection 313\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he denied the same as\nfalse. However, he did not choose to examine any witness on his side nor to\nexhibit any document in his defence. Having considered all the above materials,\nthe Trial Court found him guilty under all the charges, and accordingly,\npunished him. That is how, the appellant is now before this Court with this\nCriminal Appeal.\n\n 5. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the\nlearned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State and also perused the records\ncarefully.\n\n 6. As we have already pointed out, PW-1 is an injured eye witness.\nDue to the attack made by the accused with sickle, she had suffered two\nfractures. According to the medical evidence, the said injuries were grievous in\nnature. There is no controversy before this Court that PW-1 and the deceased\nsustained injuries in the very same transaction. Therefore, the presence of PW-\n1, at the time of occurrence, cannot be doubted at all.\n\n 7. PW-2 is the son of the deceased and PW-3 is the father-in-law of\nPW-2. Of course, they are inimical towards the accused. It is on this ground,\nthe learned counsel for the appellant would contend that these two witnesses\ncannot be believed at all, and their presence, at the time of occurrence, cannot\nbe true. But, we do not find any force in the said argument advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the appellant. PW-2 and PW-3 have stated that they were\nworking in a nearby field at Aharam and on hearing the alarm raised, they rushed\nto the place of occurrence and witnessed the entire occurrence. Simply because\nPW-2 and PW-3 are closely related to the deceased and enimical towards the\naccused, their evidence cannot be rejected. In our considered view, the\nevidences of PW-2 and PW-3 deserve to be accepted.\n\n 8. Immediately, after the occurrence, PW-2 and PW-3 took PW-1 and\nthe deceased to the hospital. On 29.03.2000, at 11.05 AM, when PW-12 examined\nPW-1, she told that she was attacked by a known person at 10.00 AM, on\n29.03.2000 with sickle. The said statement duly corroborates the evidence of PW-\n\n2. The deceased also told PW-12 that he was attacked by a known person with\nsickle at 10.00 AM, on 29.03.2000. This statement falls within the sweep of\n\nSection 32(1)\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, as a dying declaration.\n\n 9. Nextly, PW-17, the learned Judicial Magistrate, recorded the\ndying declaration of the deceased at 12.15 PM. One Dr.Ramakrishnan, who was\nattending on the deceased, certified that the deceased was in a fit state of\nmind to make dying declaration. It is the contention of the learned counsel for\nthe appellant that in the absence of the examination of Dr.Ramakrishnan, it\ncannot be held that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make dying\ndeclaration. The said argument of the learned counsel, in our considered\nopinion, deserves only to be rejected, for the reason that PW-17 has stated that\nnot only on the basis of the opinion offered by Dr.Ramakrishnan, but on his own\nassessment, from the answers given by the deceased to the questions put by him,\nhe was satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make dying\ndeclaration. At this juncture, we may point out that the opinion of the doctor\nis only a guiding factor to a Magistrate to arrive at a satisfaction regarding\nthe mental fitness of an injured person. Ultimately it is only the subjective\nsatisfaction of the Magistrate about the mental fitness of the declarant that\nmatters.\n\n 10. In this case, PW-17 has categorically stated that from the\nopinion of the doctor and out of his own assessment, he was satisfied that the\ndeceased was in a fit state of mind to make dying declaration. In respect of the\nnon - examination of Dr.Ramakrishnan, there is explanation offered by the\nprosecution that the said Dr.Ramakrishnan had gone abroad, and therefore, his\npresence could not be secured. Thus, we hold that EX-P26, dying declaration,\nrecorded by PW-17 does not carry any infirmity with it. In the said dying\ndeclaration, the deceased had stated that he was cut by the accused with sickle,\nat 10.00 AM, on 29.03.2000. There is no reason to reject the said judicial dying\ndeclaration recorded by PW-17.\n\n 11. Next comes the complaint given by the deceased to PW-15 and PW-\n16, at 12.25 PM. The deceased gave a statement orally to PW-16 and the same was\nreduced into writing by PW-15, [vide EX-P1]. This statement is yet another dying\ndeclaration. In the said dying declaration also, the deceased had stated that he\nwas cut by the accused with sickle. There is no reason to doubt this dying\ndeclaration as well.\n\n 12. During the course of investigation, PW-18 recorded the statement\nof the deceased under \nSection 161\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the\nsaid statement also, we find that the deceased said about the circumstances\nleading to his cause of death. The said statement, therefore, is a dying\ndeclaration falling within the ambit of \nSection 32\n of the Indian Evidence Act,\n1872. But, unfortunately, the prosecution has not proved the same in evidence.\nWe apprehend that the prosecution was under the mistaken impression that the\nsaid statement recorded under \nSection 161\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure is\nnot admissible in evidence, in view of the bar contained in \nSection 162\n of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. For a moment, the prosecution had failed to notice\nthe proviso to \nSection 162\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which makes it\nclear that a statement, falling within the ambit of \nSection 32\n of the Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872, as a dying declaration, is admissible in evidence and the\nbar contained in \nSection 162\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not applicable\nto such a dying declaration. In the instant case, unfortunately, the prosecution\nhas failed to make use of the said dying declaration.\n\n 13. In respect of the recovery of the Material Object, [MO-1], on\nthe disclosure statement made by the accused, we are not prepared to attach much\nimportance on the same, as there was no bloodstain found on the said weapon, as\nopined by the analyst.\n\n 14. From the above said eye - witness account of PW-1 to PW-3 and\nthe two dying declarations, referred to above, we hold that the prosecution has\nsucceeded in proving that it was this accused, who had caused injuries on the\ndeceased as well as on PW-1. We further hold that the accused had criminally\nintimidated PW-2 and PW-3, when they rushed to the place of occurrence.\n\n 15. Yet another contention of the learned counsel for the appellant\nis that the cause of death, in this case, was not directly attributable to the\nact of the accused, and therefore, according to the learned counsel, it is\ndoubtful as to whether the death of the deceased is a homicide. In order to\nappreciate the said contention, let us have a cursory look into the Postmortem\nCertificate and the evidence of PW-12 as well as the evidence of PW-13. At the\ntime when the deceased was admitted by PW-12, he noticed a cut injury on the\nabdomen, measuring 15 X 3 cms. From 29.03.2000 onwards, the deceased was\nundergoing treatment in the hospital and he died at 06.00 AM, on 22.04.2000.\nThus, he was in the hospital for 24 days as an inpatient, undergoing treatment.\nPW-13, who conducted autopsy on the body of the deceased, noticed as many as\nfour external injuries.\n\n 16. Two of those injuries were surgical wounds. The injury found on\nthe abdomen was partly healed and the other injury found on the forearm was also\npartly healed. But, almost all the internal organs were infected and there was\npuss found profusely in the internal organs. According to the doctor, the death\nwas due to the cut injury to the abdomen and its complications. In other words,\naccording to him, the death was due to infection and the injury to the abdomen.\n\n 17. From the said opinion of the doctor, PW-13, it is crystal clear\nthat the death would not have occurred but for the injuries caused on the\ndeceased. The injuries developed certain complications, like infection and\neventually, it resulted in death. Therefore, it cannot be said that the death of\nthe deceased is not attributable to the act of the accused. In our considered\nopinion, the death was caused only by the act of the accused, and therefore, it\nis a homicide.\n\n 18. The next question, which needs to be resolved, is as to whether\nthe said homicide is a culpable homicide in terms of \nSection 299\n of the Indian\nPenal Code. It is needless to point out that in order to take the shape of a\nculpable homicide, the act of the accused should fall under any one of the limbs\nof \nSection 299\n of the Indian Penal Code. The first limb of \nSection 299\n of the\nIndian Penal Code speaks of the intention of causing death. Here, in the instant\ncase, from the materials available on record, we are satisfied that the deceased\nhad intention to cause the death. Intention is always a matter of inference.\nSuch inference should be reasoned and well founded. Motive, words uttered at\nthe time of occurrence, weapon used, number of injuries, location of injuries,\nopportunity to complete the task of killing are some of the factors which would\nweigh in the judicial mind of the Court while deciding whether the accused had\nintention to kill. In this case, having considered all the above relevant\nfacts, we hold that the accused had definite intention to kill and therefore,\nthe act of the accused would fall under the first limb of Section 299 I.P.C. and\nso under the first limb of Section 300 I.P.C. It does not fall under any of the\nspecial exceptions appended to Section 300 I.P.C.\n\n 19. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the death\nof the deceased was only due to septicaemia. In other words, according to him,\nbut for the infection, he would not have died. Thus, his contention is that it\nis not a murder. \nIn this regard, the learned counsel relies on a Judgment of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nB.N.Kavatakar Vs. State of Karnataka\n reported in\n1994 SCC (Crl) 579. In the said case, the deceased was attacked by the accused\nwith lethal weapons causing several injuries. The deceased died in the hospital\nafter five days. According to the Medical Officer, who conducted autopsy on the\nbody of the deceased therein, the death was as a result of septicemia secondary\nto injuries and peritonitis. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court took\nthe view that the offence committed by the accused therein would fall under\nSection 326 r/w \nSection 34\n of the Indian Penal Code and not under \nSection 302\n of\nthe Indian Penal Code. In Paragraph No.9 of the said Judgment, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has held as follows:-\n\n \"9. The next question that comes up for our consideration is what is the\nnature of the offence that the appellants have committed. The Medical Officer\nwho conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased has opined that the death\nwas as a result of septicaemia secondary to injuries and peritonitis. As we have\nindicated above, the deceased died after five days of the occurrence in the\nhospital. On an overall scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of the case\ncoupled with the opinion of the Medical Officer, we are of the view that the\noffence would be one punishable under Section 326 read with \nSection 34\n IPC.\"\n\n 20. Placing reliance heavily on the said Judgment, the learned\ncounsel would contend that in the instant case also, since the death was due to\ninfection, the offence committed by the accused would fall under \nSection 326\n of\nthe Indian Penal Code. In this regard, we would like to examine the issue in a\ndetailed manner by making reference to various Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt and this Court.\n\n \n21. During the pre-constitutional era, a Division Bench of this\nCourt, while considering a referred trial matter, in \nDoraisamy Servai Vs.\nEmperor\n, reported in 1943 M.W.N. Cr. 185, held that in a case of this nature,\nthe real test is \"whether the cause of death is directly associated with the\nact of the accused ?\" That was a case where there were two accused. Out of\nwhom the first accused cut the deceased on the back of the neck with a\nvettaruval and the second accused was standing by his side holding a stick.\nWhen a witness in the case intervened, the second accused cried out \"Will you go\naway or shall I cut you also?\" then the first accused cut the witness with\naruval on his neck. The deceased was removed to the hospital. He underwent\ntreatment as in-patient. The deceased died after 16 days. According to the\nDoctors who conducted postmortem, the death was due to septicaemia and pyaemia\nresulting from the multiple injuries; none of the injuries could each by itself\nhave caused the death, but cumulatively the injuries should prove necessarily\nfatal in the case of a normal man. The deceased appeared to have had a physique\nabove the normal; he was well built; so in his case, the injuries need not have\nbeen necessarily fatal; but they were sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death. Relying on the above medical opinion, it was argued\nbefore the Division Bench that since the death was due to septicaemia, the\noffence would fall either under \nSection 326\n of I.P.C. or \nSection 304\n of I.P.C.\nWhile deciding the said question, the Division Bench formulated that the test is\nwhether the cause of death is to be directly associated with the act of the\naccused. After having referred to various English cases as well as Indian\ncases, Justice Mockett (O.C.J), speaking for the Bench, held as follows:\n\n \"It would be a strange position if a man who inflicts a wound causing\nalmost immediate death should be guilty of murder, whilst a man who inflicts a\nvery similar wound from which pneumonia supervenes should not. On the facts of\nthis case it is clear to me that the deceased man, in spite of his physique\nwhich is said to have been exceptionally robust, died as a direct result of the\ninjuries inflicted upon him by the appellant; and that the appellant intended\nhis death is evident from the facts. The result was not as immediate as he\nintended and not perhaps quite in the manner that he intended. But in the\nprocesses of nature, in spite of medical attention one of the well-known perils\nfrom a wound supervened, namely, blood poisoning, and the deceased died. The\nchain of causation is in my view direct.\" (Emphasis added)\nOn such view, the Division Bench held the accused guilty under \nSection 302\n\nI.P.C. The Division Bench observed that a person who inflicts such injuries,\nespecially upon a feeble old man, must be presumed to know that he is likely to\ncause death and thus he intended his death. So holding, the Division Bench held\nthe accused guilty under \nSection 302\n of I.P.C. and accordingly punished him.\n\n 22. \nIn \nState of Haryana Vs. Pala and others\n reported in (1996) 8 SCC\n51, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion to find a fine difference between\nthe primary effect of the injuries and the secondary effect of the injuries.\nThat was a case where the deceased was hit on his head three times and when the\ndeceased had fallen, the other accused had beaten him thrice on his chest and\nabdomen. The deceased was taken to the hospital. The deceased died several\ndays later, while in the hospital. The doctor's opinion in respect of the cause\nof death was as follows:\n\n \"Cause of the death was due to septicaemia, which resulted as a result of\nthe head injury and was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature.\"\n\nThe contention before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was that the offence committed\nby the accused would not fall under any of the limbs of \nSection 300\n I.P.C. This\nquestion was considered in the light of further information given by the doctors\nwhich is as follows:\n\n \"Septicasemie is the direct result of the head- injury. This is not a\ndisease. In other words, head injury is the cause of death.\"\n\nThe Trial Court convicted the accused, applying clause 3 of \nSection 300\n I.P.C.,\nunder \nSection 302\n I.P.C. On appeal, the High Court applied Exception 4 to\n\nSection 300\n I.P.C. and converted the offence of murder into culpable homicide\nnot amounting to murder and convicted the accused under Section 304 Part II of\n\nI.P.C\n. In the further appeal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in paragraph 3 of\nthe judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n \"3......On the other hand he contended that when death was due to\nsepticasemie, it cannot be referable to the cause of the death in the ordinary\ncourse of nature due to anti mortom injuries and that, therefore, the offence of\nmurder has not been made out. In support thereof, he sought to place reliance on\nLyon's Medical Jurisprudence for India (Tenth Edition) at page 222. It is stated\ntherein that \"Danger to life depends, primarily, on the amount of hemorrhage, on\nthe organ wounded, and on the extent of shock; secondarily, on secondary\nhemorrhage, on the occurrence of septicaemia, erysipelas, tetanus, or other\ncomplications. In answering the question whether a wound is dangerous to life,\nthe danger must be assessed on the probable primary effects of the injury : Such\npossibilities as the occurrence of tetanus or septicaemia, later on, are not to\nbe taken into consideration.\" Though the learned counsel had not read the later\npart of the opinion, the medical evidence on record do clearly establish that\nSepticaemia is not the primary cause and the death was due to injuries caused to\nthe deceased and they are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of\nnature. Septicaemia would, therefore, not be taken into account.\" (Emphasis\nadded)\nFrom the above judgement, it is crystal clear that it is not as though in every\ncase where the death is due to Septicaemia resulting on account of the\ninjuries, the offence would fall outside the scope of \nSection 300\n I.P.C. On the\ncontrary, the distinction lies as to whether the death was due to the primary\neffects of the injury or due to the secondary effects of the injury. If the\ninjury caused on the deceased itself is either sufficient to cause death or\nlikely to cause death, then depending upon the other circumstances, the offence\nwould fall directly either under the third limb or the fourth limb of Section\n300 I.P.C.\n\n \n23. Similarly, in \nJagtar Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n reported in\n(1999) 2 SCC 174, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had to decide as to whether the\noffence would fall within the scope of \nSection 302\n I.P.C. when the death was due\nto Septicaemia. One of the pleas taken \nin that case\n was that Septicaemia had\noccurred because of improper treatment given. It was further contended that had\nthere been proper treatment, the deceased would not have died. This contention\nwas negatived by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by referring to Explanation-2 to\n\nSection 299\n of I.P.C. which reads as follows:\n\n \"Explanation 2 to Section 299:- Where death is caused by bodily injury,\nthe person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the\ndeath, although by resorting to proper remedies and skillful treatment the death\nmight have been prevented.\"\n\nIn paragraph 7 of the Judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n \"7.Having given our anxious consideration to the first contention of Mr.\nGujral we do not find any substance in it. It is true that Naib Singh died 17\ndays after the incident due to septecemia, but Dr. M.P.Singh (P.W.1), who held\nthe post-mortem examination, categorically stated that the septicemia was\ndue to the head injury sustained by Naib Singh and that the injury was\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. From the impugned\njudgment we find that the above contention was raised on behalf of the\nappellants and in rejecting the same the High Court observed :-\n\n\"It is well settled that culpable homicide is not murder when the\ncase is brought within the five exceptions to \nsection 300\n Indian Penal Code.\nBut even though none of the said five exceptions is pleaded or prima facie\nestablished on the evidence on record, the prosecution must still be\nrequired under the law to bring the case under any of the four clauses,\nfirstly to fourthly, of \nSection 300\n, Indian Penal Code, to sustain the charge\nof murder. Injury No. 1 was the fatal injury. When this injury is judged\nobjectively from the nature of it and other evidence including the medical\nopinion of Dr. M.P.Singh (P.W.1), we are of the considered view that injury was\nintended to be caused with the intention of causing such a bodily injury by\nHarbans Singh appellant on the person of Naib Singh which was sufficient in\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause death................\"\n\nOn perusal of the evidence of P.W.1 in the light of explanation 2 to\n\nSection 299\n I.P.C . We are in complete agreement with the above quoted\nobservations of the High Court.\" (Emphasis supplied)\nHere it needs to be noted that the death occurred after 16 days of the\noccurrence due to septicaemia. The injury was on the head. The medical opinion\nwas that the injury itself is sufficient to cause the death of the deceased.\nTherefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court did not take into account the secondary\neffect viz., septicaemia.\n\n \n24. Then we have yet another judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin \nAntram Vs. State of Maharashtra\n reported in (2007) 13 SCC 356.\n \nThe Hon'ble\nSupreme Court while approving the view taken in \nPala\n case, cited supra, has held\nin paragraphs 14 to 17 as follows:\n\n \"14. \nIn \nState of Haryana v. Pala and Ors.\n (AIR 1996 SC 2962) it was noted\nas follows :\n\n \"In answering the question whether a wound is dangerous to life, the\ndanger must be assessed on the probable primary effects of the injury. Such\npossibilities as the occurrence of tetanus or septicaemia, later on, are not to\nbe taken into consideration.\"\n\n 15. \nIn \nSudershan Kumar v. State of Delhi\n (AIR 1974 SC 2328) it was noted\nas follows:\n\n \"The fact that the deceased lingered for about 12 days would not show that\nthe death was not the direct result of the act of the accused in throwing acid\non her. So also the fact that the deceased developed symptoms of malaena and\nrespiratory failure and they also contributed to her death could not in any way\naffect the conclusion that the injuries caused by the acid burns were the direct\ncause of her death.\"\n\n 16. As noted above it was emphasized by learned counsel for the appellant\nthat with proper medical care the deceased could have survived and therefore\n\nSection 302\n IPC has no application. The plea clearly overlooks Exception 2 to\n\nSection 299\n IPC, which reads as follows:\n\n \"Explanation 2.--Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who\ncauses such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by\nresorting to proper remedies and skillful treatment the death might have been\nprevented.\"\n\n 17. When the background facts are examined on the touchstone of the\nprinciples of law highlighted, the inevitable result is that the appeal is\nwithout merit, deserves dismissal, which we direct.\"\n\n 25. \nIn \nVeerla Satyanarayana Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh\n reported in\n(2009) 16 SCC 316, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was invited to decide a similar\nquestion where death was due to septicaemia on account of 60% burn injuries\ncaused by acid. In paragraphs 4 and 5 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as\nfollows:\n\n \n\"4. In our view, this submission is not tenable because of the burn\ninjuries. By throwing of the acid on the deceased who was sleeping, septicemia\nwas caused and he died. PW15 (doctor) has made it clear that even in the cases\nof proper treatment also there is possibility of septicemia. For this purpose,\nthe High Court has rightly referred to and relied upon the decision of this\nCourt in \nSudershan Kumar v. State of Delhi\n . In the said case, the court\nconfirmed the conviction under \nSection 302\n IPC by considering the fact that\nthere was 35% burn injuries by pouring of acid which according to doctor's\nevidence was due to toxaemia and septicemia from absorption of toxins. The Court\nalso considered the relevant explanation (2) to Section 299, which provides that\n\n-where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily\ninjury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper\nremedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.\n\n 5. In the present case, the prosecution has established beyond reasonable\ndoubt the motive of the accused of causing this injury. It is also established\nthat the act of the appellant in pouring acid on the body of the deceased was\npre-planned one; he selected night time when the deceased as well as PW1 were\nsleeping; he poured the acid which caused 60% burn injuries and as the injuries\ncaused by the appellant were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause\ndeath, the appellant is rightly held to be guilty of offence punishable under\n\nSection 302\n of IPC.\"\n\n \n26. Likewise in \nMunnawar and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and\nothers\n reported in (2010) 5 SCC 451, there were as many as seven injuries caused\non the deceased. The deceased died in the hospital after five days. The\nmedical opinion was that the death was due to septicaemia on account of the\ninfection caused by the injuries. The doctors had further opined that had the\ndeceased been given proper treatment, he might have survived. It is on the\nbasis of this medical opinion, it was contended before the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nthat the offence would not fall within the ambit of \nSection 302\n I.P.C. While\nnegativing the plea, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in paragraph 24, held as\nfollows:\n\n \"24. We see from the injuries that they had been caused from a very close\nrange as tattooing was present. Dr. Anil Kapoor also pointed that injury Nos.1,\n3, 6 and 7 were grievous and were fatal to life and all the injuries were\nsufficient to cause death as they were on sensitive parts of the body and that\nthe injured was under severe shock, and had been given three units of blood at\nthe time of his admission to hospital. In the light of this evidence, we are\nunable to comprehend as to how the trial court could have concluded that it was\nthe negligence on the part of Dr.Anil Kapoor which had led to septicemia and\nfinally to the death of the patient.\"\n\n \n27. Very recently in \nState of Rajasthan Vs. Arjun Singh and others\n\nreported in (2011) 9 SCC 115, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had to deal with a\nsimilar situation where the death occurred after 35 days due to septicaemia on\naccount of gun shot injuries. Speaking for the Bench Hon'ble Mr. Justice\nP.Sathasivam in paragraph 31 has held as follows:\n\n \"31. Finally, learned senior counsel for the accused pointed out that\ninasmuch as Himmat Raj Singh died after 35 days due to septicemia, the Courts\nbelow are not justified in convicting the accused persons for an offence under\n\nSection 302\n IPC for his death. Considering the medical evidence that Himmat Raj\nSingh sustained 7 gun shot injuries which were sufficient to cause death in the\nordinary course, we are satisfied that the death of Himmat Raj Singh undoubtedly\nfalls within the ambit of 302 \nIPC\n. \" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 28. The judgments, thus far, we have referred to are all cases where\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court found the accused guilty under \nSection 302\n I.P.C.,\nthough the death was due to septicaemia on account of the injuries.\n\n 29. Now let us have a look into some of the decisions of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has convicted the accused under\n\nSection 304\n I.P.C. where also death was due to septicaemia on account of the\ninjuries. \nIn \nJharmal and others Vs. State of Haryana\n reported in 1994 SCC\n(Crl.) 593 the deceased sustained injuries on the head due to single blow with\nan iron pipe. He died after 17 days due to septicaemia. The Court below\nconvicted the accused under \nSection 302\n I.P.C. but the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nreversed the same and convicted the accused under Section 304 part II of \nI.P.C\n.\nIn paragraph 6 of the judgement the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n \"6.We find considerable force in this submission. As stated above the\noccurrence took place on November 18, 1988 and the deceased died 18 days later\non December 5, 1988 due to septicaemia and other complications. The Doctor found\nonly one injury on the head and that was due to single blow inflicted with an\niron pipe not with any sharp-edged weapon. Having regard to the circumstances of\nthe case, it is difficult to hold that the appellant intended to cause death nor\nit can be said that he intended to cause that particular injury. In any event\nthe medical evidence shows that the injured deceased was operated but\nunfortunately some complications set in and ultimately he died because of\ncardiac failure etc. Under these circumstances, we set aside the conviction of\nthe appellant under \nSection 302\n IPC and the sentence of imprisonment for life\nawarded thereunder. Instead we convict him under Section 304 Part II \nIPC\n and\nsentence him to undergo six years' RI. The sentence of fine of Rs 2000 along\nwith default clause is confirmed. Accordingly the appeal is partly allowed.\"\n\n 30. \nIn \nManiben Vs. State of Gujarat\n reported in (2009) 8 SCC 796 the\ndeceased died after 8 days of the incident in which the deceased had sustained\nburn injuries. The accused had thrown a burning wick made of rags on the\ndeceased and thereby set fire to the terylene clothes put on by the deceased.\nIn paragraph 20 of the judgment it was held as follows:-\n\n \"20. There is also evidence on record to prove and establish that the\naction of the appellant to throw the burning tonsil was preceded by a quarrel\nbetween the deceased and the appellant. From the aforesaid evidence on record it\ncannot be said that the appellant had the intention that such action on her part\nwould cause the death or such bodily injury to the deceased, which was\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.\nTherefore, in our considered opinion, the case cannot be said to be covered\nunder clause (4) of \nSection 300\n of IPC. We are, however, of the considered\nopinion that the case of the appellant is covered under Section 304 Part II of\n\nIPC\n.\"\n\n 31. \nIn \nShanmugam @ Kulandaivelu Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n reported in\n(2002) 10 SCC 4, the doctor who attended the deceased in the hospital stated\nthat the immediate cause of death was infection and also on account of oozing of\nexcreta from the colon and wounds that got infected and became septic. But his\nevidence did not lead to a definite conclusion that the death could be caused in\nthe ordinary course of nature. The evidence of the doctor who conducted the\npost mortem also was not categorical so as to form a definite opinion that the\ninjuries inflicted on the deceased were sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death. According to the doctor, the death occurred as a result\nof onset of septicemia because of puss and infection. He further opined that\nthe wounds on the gall bladder were capable of causing death. But during the\ncross examination, the doctor stated that it cannot be stated with certainty\nthat the wounds on the gall bladder would result in death. In those\ncircumstances, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n \"At the same time, the nature of injuries and the medical opinion\nunmistakably point to the fact that the bodily injuries inflicted on the\ndeceased were of such nature that they were likely to cause death. There can be\nno doubt that the accused intended to cause and did cause the injuries. We are,\ntherefore, of the view that the appellant is liable to be punished under the\nfirst Part of \nSection 304\n IPC.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 32. From these judgments one can easily perceive the difference. In\nthese cases, the Court held there was no intention to cause death. The medical\nopinion was not certain as to whether the injuries, caused with intention, would\nhave been sufficient to cause the death in the ordinary course of nature or not.\nBut, the medical opinion was to the effect that the injury is likely to cause\ndeath. It was because of these reasons, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the\noffence would fall only under Section 304 I.P.C.\n\n 33. There are few more cases which need to be looked into, wherein,\nthe Courts have held that the offence would fall under \nSection 326\n I.P.C. where\ndeath was due to septicaemia on account of the injuries.\n\n 34. \nIn \nB.N.Kavatakar\n case (cited supra), upon which much reliance\nhas been placed by the learned counsel for the appellant, the death occurred in\nthe hospital after five days due to septicaemia . But a reading of the judgment\nwould go to show that it does not reflect the nature of the injury and whether\nthe cause of death was primarily due to the injury or due to the secondary\ncause, like infection. Therefore\n, \nthe said judgment\n cannot be taken to have\nlaid down any guidance on this aspect.\n\n \n35. A Division Bench of this Court in \nBalu @ Balusamy Vs. State\n\nreported in 1996 (1) MWN (Cr.)\n \n238 considered the scope of \nB.N.Kavatakar\n case\n(cited supra). In the case before the Division Bench, there were as many as\nfour injuries on the body of the deceased, all were caused by knife. There were\nalso blood stains on the body of the deceased. The doctor who conducted the\nautopsy opined as follows:\n\n \"The deceased would appear to have died of septicaemia and shock due to\nmultiple injuries sustained.\"\n\nIn that case, except injury No.5, the other injuries were all surgical wounds.\nThe doctor further opined that the cumulative effect of all the injuries and\npost-operation shock and septicaemia, resulted in the death of the deceased. In\nparagraph No. 15 and 16 the Division Bench has held as follows:\n\n \"15. Medical evidence afforded by P.W.5 and P.W.6 corroborates the ocular\ntestimony of P.Ws. 1 to 3 about infliction of stabs by the appellant on the\ndeceased, P.W.1 and P.W.2. If P.W.1 was not in the nearness of the deceased he\nwould not have been in a position to prevent the appellant, when he was\nattacking his wife and that is one more reason, which highlights that the\ndeceased and P.W.1 were together or in the vicinity of the other, when the\nappellant had arrived at his residence. As rightly pointed out by\nMr.T.Sudanthiram, the deceased had died five days later and the cause of death,\nin the words of P.W.6, is the cumulative effect of all the injuries and post-\noperation shock and septicaemia. When he has stated \"all the injuries\", we have\nto take it, to include, the surgical injuries as well. If those injuries had\nalso caused shock and septicaemia, ultimately leading to the death of the\ndeceased, it will be unfair and odd to hold that the accused had the mens rea to\nmurder.\n\n 16. On auditing of the totality of facts available, we are satisfied that\nthe appellant could be held to have had knowledge that by his act, he was likely\nto cause the death of the deceased. We have said enough and more about the\ncircumstances under which the appellant had inflicted, for all practical\npurpose, a single stab. The appellant, therefore cannot be held to be guilty of\nmurder. IN 1994 SCC (Crl.) 579, on the fact perspective before it, the Supreme\nCourt held that when the Medical Officer who conducted autopsy had opined that\nthe death was the result of septicaemia secondary to injuries to peritonitis,\nthe offence committed by the accused therein would be punishable under Section\n326 read with \nSection 34\n, I.P.C. In the present prosecution, we have from Exs.P-\n12 and P-15, the statement of the deceased herself, which, we are prepared to\naccept, that the appellant had exclaimed that she was cheating him for a long\ntime and he would not leave her. This fact will make all the difference and we\nsatisfied, that properly, in the instant case, the appellant can be convicted\nunder Section 304 Part II, \nI.P.C\n. and not under \nSection 326\n, I.P.C. peculiar\nfacts available in each case would have to dictate the nature of offence that\ncould be held to have been committed by the accused.\"\n\n 36. In yet another judgment in Chinnathambi @ Kakkayan Vs. State\nreported in 1990 (1) MWN (Cr.) 204, the accused had caused stab injuries on the\ndeceased with a knife. The deceased died after four days in the hospital. The\ndoctor opined that the death was caused by septicaemia due to peritonitis. But\nthe Doctor would not come forward to say that the single injury found on the\nbody of the deceased was by itself sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause death. While considering the said medical opinion, the Division Bench\nin paragraph 6 of the judgment has held as follows:\n\n \"6..... Therefore, there is no sufficient evidence on record to show that\nthe accused has caused the death of Ramu. However, there is overwhelming\nevidence to show that the stab injury was inflicted by the accused on the\ndeceased Ramu on 22.03.1983. In fact, the learned counsel for the accused would\nno longer dispute that fact. Therefore, the accused would be only guilty of the\noffence under \nSection 326\n I.P.C....\" (Emphasis supplied)\nIn this case, the Division Bench did not accept the opinion of the doctors that\nthe death was due to the injuries. Thus holding that the death was not caused\nby the accused, the Division Bench convicted the accused under Section 326 of\nI.P.C.\n\n 37. From the three sets of judgments which we have dealt with herein\nabove, the point of difference is easily decipherable, which is thin but fine.\nIn all these cases referred to above, one common feature is that the death was\ndue to septicaemia on account of the injuries. In this context we would like to\nmention that there is a general tendency to contend in such cases, that if once\nit is found that the death is due to septicaemia, the offence would fall either\nunder \nSection 304\n of I.P.C. or under \nSection 326\n I.P.C. and not under \nSection\n302\n of I.P.C. We have seen in our experience, in many judgments of the Trial\nCourts, there is a slight lack of clarity on this subject. That is the reason\nwhy, we have undertaken the exercise to refer to all the three sets of\njudgments. From the above judgments and the discussions we have made supra, we\nmay state that the point of difference is this: \"whether the death was primarily\ndue to the injuries or due to the secondary cause namely supervening cause like\nsepticaemia, tetanus etc.,?\"\n\n 38. If it is proved that the injury is fatal and the intention was\nto cause the death, though the death occurred after several days after\nsepticaemia had supervened, it is undoubtedly a murder as it falls within the\nfirst limb of Section 300 I.P.C.\n\n 39. If it is proved that the injuries by themselves are sufficient\nto cause death in the ordinary course of nature and if it is established that\nthose injuries were the intended injuries, though the death occurred after\nsepticaemia had supervened, the act of the accused would squarely fall under the\nthird limb of Section 300 I.P.C. and the accused is therefore liable to be\npunished under Section 302 of I.P.C.\n\n 40. If it is proved that the injuries are imminently dangerous to\nlife, though the death had occurred after septicaemia had supervened, then the\nact of the accused would squarely fall under the fourth limb of \nSection 300\n\nI.P.C., provided the other requirements like knowledge on the part of the\naccused etc., are satisfied and so the accused will be liable to be punished\nunder \nSection 302\n of I.P.C. Here also, the primary cause of the death is the\ninjuries and septicaemia, tetanus etc., are only the secondary cause.\n\n 41. On the contrary, if it is clear that the injury is neither fatal\nnor likely to cause death nor sufficient to cause death or that the injury has\nnothing to do with the death, then, the offence would fall neither under \nSection\n302\n I.P.C. nor under \nSection 304\n I.P.C. Let us illustrate the point of\ndifference as follows:\n\nIllustration - A:-\n\n With a small iron pipe, the accused causes an injury on the tip of\nthe right hand little finger of the deceased. There is an open wound on the tip\nof the finger and the bone is exposed. The deceased does not take treatment at\nall and the injury results in infection and septicaemia. The deceased dies of\nthe same after thirty days of the occurrence.\n\nIllustration - B:-\n\n The accused causes an injury with formidable weapon like sickle on\nthe neck. There is huge loss of blood. The deceased is taken to the hospital,\nwhere skilled doctors give treatment in a higher medical institute having all\nlatest equipments. Life saving drugs are given. The injured survives for\nthirty days and dies due to septicaemia due to injury.\n\nIllustration - C:-\n\n The accused cut the deceased on his hand with a sickle and severs\nthe hand, resulting in huge loss of blood. The deceased is taken to the\nhospital and treated by skilled doctors. Notwithstanding the same, he develops\nsepticaemia due to the injuries and dies after thirty days due to septicaemia.\n\n 42. In these three illustrations, though death occurred due to\nsepticaemia after thirty days, these cases cannot be equated to each\nother. There is a world of difference which we may explain thus:-\n\n (a) So far as illustration 'A' is concerned, it cannot be said at\nany stretch of imagination that a small injury caused on the little finger\nfracturing a bone is either likely to cause or sufficient to cause death in the\nordinary course of nature. Similarly it cannot be stated that the said injury\nis so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death. The\nprimary cause of death is not the injury. Thus, the act of the accused would\nnot fall either under Section 299 I.P.C. or under Section 300 of I.P.C.\n\nTherefore, in Illustration - A, the accused will be convicted only for an\noffence punishable under Section 326 of I.P.C.\n\n (b) In the Illustration - B, the injury is on a vital organ viz.,\nneck. There is huge loss of blood. Here, the medical opinion is that the said\ninjury is primarily sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\nHere, though there is septicaemia, the primary cause is the injury and\nsepticaemia is only a secondary cause and so the offence would squarely fall\nunder the third limb of Section 300 I.P.C. unless the same falls under any of\nthe special exceptions appended to Section 300 of I.P.C. Here, the accused is\nliable to be punished under Section 302 of I.P.C.\n\n (c) In illustration - C, the medical opinion is that severance of\nhand by cutting is likely to cause death. Here also the primary cause is the\ninjury though there was secondary cause viz., septicaemia. But, the said injury\nis not sufficient to cause the death in the ordinary course of nature. Here,\nthe offence would not fall under any of the limbs of Section 300 I.P.C. But it\nwould fall under the third limb of Section 299 I.P.C. So the accused is liable\nto be punished under Section 304 of I.P.C.\n\n 43. Now turning to the facts of the case, the injury was caused on\nthe abdomen and such injury was undoubtedly the intended injury. If no\ntreatment was given, the death would have been imminent. The death was\npostponed by 24 days because of the medical intervention. In illustration-A,\nthe death occurred after 30 days because there was no treatment given. But here\nin this case, the death did not occur immediately and it was postponed by 24\ndays because of the treatment. Thus, in our considered view, the act of the\naccused would squarely fall under the first limb of Section 300 I.P.C. and\ntherefore he is liable to be punished under Section 302 of I.P.C.\n\n 44. Now turning to the quantum of sentence, the Trial Court has\nimposed only the minimum punishment which does not call for any interference at\nthe hands of this Court. So far as the conviction and sentence for the offences\nunder \nSections 326\n and \n506(ii)\n of I.P.C. are concerned, we do not find any\nreason to interfere.\n\n 45. In the result, the conviction and sentence dated 07.10.2003 made\nin S.C.No.369 of 2001, imposed on the appellant by the learned Additional\nSessions Judge, [Fast Track Court No.I], Tuticorin, is hereby confirmed and the\nCriminal Appeal is dismissed.\n\nNB\n\nTo\n\n1.The Additional Sessions Judge, [Fast Track Court No.I],\n Tuticorin.\n\n2.The Additional Public Prosecutor,\n Madurai Bench of Madras High Court,\n Madurai.\n\n3.The Inspector of Police,\n Murappanadu Police Station,\n Tirunelveli District.\u001a",

Cr. 185, held that in a case of this nature,\nthe real test is \"whether the cause of death is directly associated with the\nact of the accused ?\" That was a case where there were two accused. Out of\nwhom the first accused cut the deceased on the back of the neck with a\nvettaruval and the second accused was standing by his side holding a stick.\nWhen a witness in the case intervened, the second accused cried out \"Will you go\naway or shall I cut you also?\" then the first accused cut the witness with\naruval on his neck. The deceased was removed to the hospital. He underwent\ntreatment as in-patient. The deceased died after 16 days. According to the\nDoctors who conducted postmortem, the death was due to septicaemia and pyaemia\nresulting from the multiple injuries; none of the injuries could each by itself\nhave caused the death, but cumulatively the injuries should prove necessarily\nfatal in the case of a normal man. The deceased appeared to have had a physique\nabove the normal; he was well built; so in his case, the injuries need not have\nbeen necessarily fatal; but they were sufficient in the ordinary course of\nnature to cause death. Relying on the above medical opinion, it was argued\nbefore the Division Bench that since the death was due to septicaemia, the\noffence would fall either under \nSection 326\n of I.P.C. or \nSection 304\n of I.P.C.\nWhile deciding the said question, the Division Bench formulated that the test is\nwhether the cause of death is to be directly associated with the act of the\naccused.

In the case before the Division Bench, there were as many as\nfour injuries on the body of the deceased, all were caused by knife. There were\nalso blood stains on the body of the deceased.

If P.W.1 was not in the nearness of the deceased he\nwould not have been in a position to prevent the appellant, when he was\nattacking his wife and that is one more reason, which highlights that the\ndeceased and P.W.1 were together or in the vicinity of the other, when the\nappellant had arrived at his residence. As rightly pointed out by\nMr.T.Sudanthiram, the deceased had died five days later and the cause of death,\nin the words of P.W.6, is the cumulative effect of all the injuries and post-\noperation shock and septicaemia. When he has stated \"all the injuries\", we have\nto take it, to include, the surgical injuries as well. If those injuries had\nalso caused shock and septicaemia, ultimately leading to the death of the\ndeceased, it will be unfair and odd to hold that the accused had the mens rea to\nmurder."

On auditing of the totality of facts available, we are satisfied that\nthe appellant could be held to have had knowledge that by his act, he was likely\nto cause the death of the deceased. We have said enough and more about the\ncircumstances under which the appellant had inflicted, for all practical\npurpose, a single stab. The appellant, therefore cannot be held to be guilty of\nmurder. IN 1994 SCC (Crl.) 579, on the fact perspective before it, the Supreme\nCourt held that when the Medical Officer who conducted autopsy had opined that\nthe death was the result of septicaemia secondary to injuries to peritonitis,\nthe offence committed by the accused therein would be punishable under Section\n326 read with \nSection 34\n, I.P.C. In the present prosecution, we have from Exs.P-\n12 and P-15, the statement of the deceased herself, which, we are prepared to\naccept, that the appellant had exclaimed that she was cheating him for a long\ntime and he would not leave her. This fact will make all the difference and we\nsatisfied, that properly, in the instant case, the appellant can be convicted\nunder Section 304 Part II, \nI.P.C\n. and not under \nSection 326\n, I.P.C. peculiar\nfacts available in each case would have to dictate the nature of offence that\ncould be held to have been committed by the accused.\""

The deceased died after four days in the hospital. The\ndoctor opined that the death was caused by septicaemia due to peritonitis. But\nthe Doctor would not come forward to say that the single injury found on the\nbody of the deceased was by itself sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause death. While considering the said medical opinion, the Division Bench\nin paragraph 6 of the judgment has held as follows:"

In fact, the learned counsel for the accused would\nno longer dispute that fact. Therefore, the accused would be only guilty of the\noffence under \nSection 326\n I.P.C....\" (Emphasis supplied)\nIn this case, the Division Bench did not accept the opinion of the doctors that\nthe death was due to the injuries.

From the three sets of judgments which we have dealt with herein\nabove, the point of difference is easily decipherable, which is thin but fine.\nIn all these cases referred to above, one common feature is that the death was\ndue to septicaemia on account of the injuries. In this context we would like to\nmention that there is a general tendency to contend in such cases, that if once\nit is found that the death is due to septicaemia, the offence would fall either\nunder \nSection 304\n of I.P.C. or under \nSection 326\n I.P.C. and not under \nSection\n302\n of I.P.C. We have seen in our experience, in many judgments of the Trial\nCourts, there is a slight lack of clarity on this subject. That is the reason\nwhy, we have undertaken the exercise to refer to all the three sets of\njudgments. From the above judgments and the discussions we have made supra, we\nmay state that the point of difference is this: \"whether the death was primarily\ndue to the injuries or due to the secondary cause namely supervening cause like\nsepticaemia, tetanus etc.,?\""
