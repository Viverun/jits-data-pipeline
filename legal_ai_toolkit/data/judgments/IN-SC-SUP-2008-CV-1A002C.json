Civil Appeal No.6447 of 2001 has been\ntaken up for hearing along with five other\nmatters, namely, Special Leave Petition (C)\nNo.15469 of 2005, Special Leave Petition (C)\nNo.16573 of 2006, Special Leave Petition (C)\nNo. 20260 of 2004, Special Leave Petition (C)\nNo.8661 of 2004 and Civil Appeal No.2629 of\n2006. All the said matters are directed\nagainst orders passed by the National Consumer\nDisputes Redressal Commission on Revision\nPetitions filed from orders passed by the State\nCommission, Kerala, in appeal from orders\npassed by the District Forum. All of them\ninvolve a common question of law and fact and\nhave thus been taken up together for hearing\nand final disposal.\n\n2. Of the five matters, Special Leave\nPetition (C) Nos. 20260 of 2004 and Special\nLeave Petition (C) No. 8661 of 2004 have\nbeen filed against order dated 30.7.2002 passed\nby the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission (hereinafter referred to as 'the\nNational Commission') dismissing the Revision\nPetitions filed by the Regional Provident Fund\nCommissioner for condonation of delay in filing\nthe Review Petition. Both the Revision\nPetitions were dismissed on the ground that the\ndelay had not been sufficiently explained.\nThough in these two Special Leave Petitions it\nis the order rejecting the Revision Petitions\non ground of delay that is involved,\nultimately, it is the order of the State\nCommission allowing the claim of the\nrespondents concerned which is the subject\nmatter of all these five matters. Furthermore,\nthe effect of the orders passed by the National\nCommission in all these five matters is the\nsame in respect of the different petitioners\nbefore the District Forum and it is their claim\nwhich has been upheld right through up to the\nNational Commission.\n\n3. Leave is accordingly granted in the\nSpecial Leave Petitions and all the appeals are\ntaken up for hearing together.\n\n4. For the sake of convenience the facts\nrelating to Civil Appeal No.6447/2001 are taken\ninto for consideration in order to decide the\ncommon issues in these matters.\n\n5. The respondent Bhavani was a worker in\nCashew Factory No.III (Naduvathoor) owned and\nmanaged by the Kerala State Cashew Development\nCorporation Limited, Kollam and according to\nher she retired from service on 31.12.1995 on\nattaining 60 years of age. Bhavani was a\nmember of the Employees' Provident Fund and\nFamily Pension Scheme, 1971, and was making\ncontribution to the Scheme. In her service\nrecords maintained by the company her date of\nbirth was shown as 31.12.1935 and though she\nwas eligible for pension, the same was not\nordered by the Regional Provident Fund\nCommissioner, the appellant herein in all these\nappeals. Aggrieved by the failure and/or the\nrefusal of the Regional Provident Fund\nAuthorities to release pension to her, Bhavani\nfiled an application before the Consumer\nDisputes Redressal Forum (hereinafter referred\nto as 'the District Forum') Kollom, praying for\na direction upon the appellant herein to\nrelease her pensionary benefits from the date\nof her retirement from service i.e. 31.12.1995.\nBhavani's claim was contested by the appellant\nherein before the District Forum by filing a\ncounter affidavit wherein it was contended that\nthe\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986\n, would have\nno application to a claim made under the\nEmployees' Provident Funds and Misc. Provisions\nAct, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1952\nAct'), inasmuch as, Bhavani, the respondent\nherein, was not a \"consumer\" within the meaning\nof\nSection 2(d)\nof the Act.\n\n6. It was also contended on behalf of the\nappellant herein that Bhavani was a member of\nthe Employees' Provident Fund and Family\nPension Scheme 1971 and according to the\nrecords of the appellant she had attained the\nage of 60 years in 1992 before the\nEmployees'\nPension Scheme Act, 1995\n, came into operation.\nBefore the District Forum it was the case of\nthe appellant herein that the said Employees'\nPension Scheme, 1995, contained a cut-off date,\nnamely, 1st April, 1993 and those members of\nthe Scheme who had attained the age of 60 years\nprior to the cut-off date were not entitled to\nthe benefits thereof. It was the further case\nof the appellant before the District Forum that\naccording to the records maintained by the\noffice of the appellant, the date of birth of\nBhavani had been shown as 24.9.1932. It was\nsubmitted that Form 2 which was required to be\nfilled up and filed by the concerned employee\nwhile applying for membership of the Family\nPension Fund Scheme, 1971, showed her date of\nbirth as 24.9.1932. It was contended that\naccording to the information provided by\nBhavani herself she had attained the age of 60\nyears on 24.9.1992 and was not, therefore,\nentitled to the benefits of the 1995 Employees'\nPension Scheme.\n\n7. The District Forum rejected the case made\nout on behalf of the appellant herein on a\nscrutiny of the various documents submitted on\nbehalf of Bhavani to establish that her date of\nbirth in the records of the company was\n31.12.1935. The District Forum came to a\nfinding that since Bhavani was eligible for the\nbenefits of the 1995 Scheme, denial of the same\namounted to deficiency of service which would\nattract the provisions of the\nConsumer\nProtection Act, 1986\n. The District Forum on\nconsidering the provisions of Section 2(1)(d)\n\n(ii) of the\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986\n,\nobserved that the definition of \"consumer\"\ntherein was not exhaustive and\nSection 2(1)(o)\n\nexempts only such services as are rendered free\nof charge or under a contract of personal\nservice.\n\n8. The District Forum also rejected the said\ncontention of the appellant herein upon holding\nthat the service rendered by the appellant\nherein did not fall within the exempted\ncategories. The District Forum categorically\nfound that the services rendered by the\nappellant herein to Bhavani came within the\nambit of\nSection 2(1)(d)(ii)\nof the Consumer\nProtection Act.\n\n9. On the question of the recording of the\nrespondent's date of birth in the records of\nthe appellant herein, the District Forum came\nto a definite finding that the respondent\nretired from service only on 31.12.1995 and\nwas, therefore, entitled to the benefits of the\n1995 Employees' Pension Scheme which became\noperative from 1st April, 1993.\n\n10. As indicated hereinbefore, the said order\nof the District Forum was challenged by the\nappellant herein unsuccessfully both before the\nState Commission as also the National\nCommission.\n\n11. The question involved in the other\nmatters taken up along with this appeal is\nidentical and have been allowed by the District\nForum and thereafter by the State and National\nCommissions.\n\n12. Dr. R.G. Padia, learned senior advocate\nappearing in support of the appeal, repeated\nthe same submissions that had been advanced\nbefore the District Forum and the State\ncommission. He contended that, inasmuch as, the\nrespondent was not a 'consumer' within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(1)(o)\nof the Consumer\nProtection Act, 1986, the said Act would have\nno application particularly when from the\ndefinition itself it would be evident that no\nservice was being rendered to the respondent\nfree of charge. Dr. Padia also urged that when\na master and servant relationship existed, the\n\nConsumer Protection Act\nwould not apply to\neither of them.\n\n13. Dr. Padia also urged that the 1995 Scheme\nhad no relation to the question of payment of\nthe respondent's provident fund dues.\n\n14. Dr. Padia then went on to submit that the\norder of the National Commission under\nchallenge was very cryptic and did not indicate\nreasons for negating the claim of the\nrespondents in the appeals and deserved to be\nremanded to enable the National Commission to\npass a properly reasoned order. It was then\nurged that, in any event, this Court had\ndeprecated the practice of employees\napproaching the management at the fag end of\ntheir careers asking that their dates of birth\nbe altered to their advantage. Dr. Padia\nsubmitted that this was not permissible and\nthis Court had said so in different judgments.\nIt was submitted that such a claim after the\nattainment of superannuation was all the more\ninadmissible and the order passed by the\nDistrict Forum, which was upheld up to the\nNational Commission to direct the appellant\nherein to correct its records relating to the\ndate of birth of the respondent, was erroneous\nand could not be sustained.\n\n15. In this regard, various decisions of this\nCourt were referred to by Dr. Padia in support\nof his contention that contract of personal\nservice or a service rendered free of charge\nwould not attract the provisions of the\n\nConsumer Protection Act, 1986\n. Dr. Padia urged\nthat the services rendered by the appellant to\nthe respondent amounted to personal service\nwhich was of a free nature and would not,\ntherefore, attract the provisions of the\n\nConsumer Protection Act\non both counts.\nAccording to Dr. Padia, the respondent could at\nbest have asked for pensionary benefits under\nthe 1971 Employees' Family Pension Scheme which\nhad been replaced by the Employees' Pension\nScheme, 1995.\n\n16. Dr. Padia lastly urged that the District\nForum had no jurisdiction under the\nConsumer\nProtection Act\nto direct alteration of the date\nof birth of a member which was recorded in the\nrecords of the appellant, and, that too,\nwithout holding any inquiry in that regard.\n\n17. On behalf of the respondents, Mr. Noor\nMohammed, learned advocate for the respondent\nin Special Leave Petition ) No.8661 of 2004,\nsubmitted that in a similar case involving the\nsame set of facts, being Special Leave Petition\n) No.9667 of 2005, this Court by order dated\n26.3.2007 had dismissed the special leave\npetition. He, therefore, submitted that the\narguments advanced by Dr. Padia were of no\nconsequence in view of the order passed in\nSpecial Leave Petition ) No.9667 of 2005\nwherein one K. Sarojini was the complainant\nbefore the District Forum.\n\n18. Mr. V. Prabhakar disputed Dr. Padia's\ncontentions and submitted that the entries\nrelating to the date of birth of the respondent\nin the records of the company and not that\nrecorded in the records of the appellant were\nrelevant for the purpose of determining the\ndate of superannuation of the employee\nconcerned. It was submitted that stress had\nbeen erroneously laid on the alleged entry in\nthe records of the appellant to wrongfully deny\nthe benefits of the 1995 Employees' Pension\nScheme to the respondent. It was also\nsubmitted that various records had been\nproduced on behalf of the respondent, including\ndocumentary evidence from the company, in order\nto establish her claim that her date of birth\nhad been entered in her service records with\nthe company as 31.12.1935.\n\n19. We have carefully considered the\nsubmissions made on behalf of the respective\nparties and the relevant documents which had\nbeen produced before the District Forum and we\nare satisfied that the dates of birth of the\nrespondents as recorded in their service\nrecords with the company are the correct dates\nof birth of the employees and not the dates of\nbirth as entered in the records of the\nappellant. The reasoning given by the District\nForum in accepting the entries in the company's\nrecord while rejecting those in the records of\nthe appellant/Regional P.F. Commissioner are\nbased on sound logic and the materials on\nrecord. For instance, there are certificates\nissued by the company to indicate that the\nrespondent in C.A. No.6447/2001 had continued\nto work in the company till her date of\nsuperannuation i.e. 31.12.1995 and there was no\ndenial on the part of the appellant that the\nrespondent continued to contribute to the fund\ntill the year 1995. No explanation is\nforthcoming as to why and how such\ncontributions were received, even though\naccording to the records of the appellant the\nrespondent had retired on 31.12.1992, so as to\nmake her ineligible for the 1995 Employees'\nPension Scheme which came into operation on and\nfrom 1st April, 1993.\n\n20. Dr. Padia's submissions regarding the\nnon-applicability of the\nConsumer Protection\nAct\nto the case of the respondent must also be\nrejected on account of the fact that the\nRegional Provident Fund Commissioner, who is\nthe person responsible for the working of the\n1995 Pension Scheme, must be held to be a\n'service giver' within the meaning of\nSection\n2(1)(o)\nof the Consumer Protection Act. Nor is\nthis a case of rendering of free service or\nrendering of service under a contract of\npersonal service so as to bring the\nrelationship between the appellant and\nrespondent within the concept of 'master and\nservant'. In our view, the respondent comes\nsquarely within the definition of 'consumer'\nwithin the meaning of\nSection 2(1)(d)(ii)\n,\ninasmuch as, by becoming a member of the\nEmployees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971, and\ncontributing to the same, she was availing of\nthe services rendered by the appellant for\nimplementation of the Scheme. The same is the\ncase in the other appeals as well.\n\n21.\nIn fact, the same proposition has been\nexplained in\nRegional Provident Fund\nCommissioner vs. Shiv Kumar Joshi\n[2000 (1)\nSCC 98], wherein in relation to the operation\nof the\nConsumer Protection Act\nto the\nEmployees' Provident Fund Schemes it was held\nas follows:\n\n\"A perusal of the Scheme clearly and\nunambiguously indicates that it is a\n'service' within the meaning of\n\nSection 2(1)(o)\nand the member a\n'consumer' within the meaning of\n\nSection 2(1)(d)\nof the Act. It is,\ntherefore, without any substance to\nurge that the services under the\nScheme are rendered free of charge\nand, therefore, the Scheme is not a\n'service' under the Act. Both the\nState as well as the National\nCommission have dealt with this\naspect in detail and rightly come to\nthe conclusion that the Act was\napplicable in the case of the Scheme\non the ground that its member was a\n'consumer' under\nSection 2(1)(d)\nand\nthe Scheme was a 'service' under\n\nSection 2(1)(o)\n.\"\n\n22. Several other earlier decisions were also\nreferred to, where a similar view has been\nexpressed.\n\n23. We are not also able to appreciate Dr.\nPadia's submission that the cases of the\nrespondents should not be considered as they\nhad applied at the fag end of their careers for\ncorrection of their dates of birth in the\nappellant's records, which practice had been\nstrongly discouraged by this Court. The\naforesaid principle cannot apply to the case of\nthe respondents as their dates of birth had\nbeen correctly recorded in the records of the\ncompany, including the respondents' service\nrecords, on the basis whereof they had retired\nfrom the company's services.\n\n24. We, therefore, have no hesitation in\nupholding the orders passed by the National\nCommission. All the six appeals filed by the\nRegional Provident Fund Commissioner are\naccordingly dismissed.\n\n25. There will, however, be no order as to\ncosts.",
