The writ petitioners, by the medium of\n\nthese writ petitions, have invoked the jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt for the grant of a writ of mandamus commanding\n\n.\n\nthe respondents to regularize their services, on the\n\ngrounds taken in the memo of the writ petitions.\n\n3. Precisely, the case, as projected by the writ\n\npetitioners, is that the respondent-University came to\n\nof\nbe established in the year 2010 in the State of H.P. On\n\nthe establishment of the University, it was in the dire\nrt\nneed of the staff for running its affairs. It is stated that\n\nthe respondent-University invited applications for filling-\n\nup the various posts, such as Data Entry Operator,\n\ndriver and office attendant/peon. The petitioners were\n\ninterviewed along with other persons and as such were\n\noffered appointment on the terms and conditions as\n\ncontained in their appointment orders on short term\n\narrangement basis. It is contended that the Executive\n\nCouncil of the respondent-University in 2013 revised\n\nthe salaries of such type of employees and thereafter\n\npetitioners are being given some higher salary. It is\n\nfurther averred in the writ petitions that respondent-\n\nUniversity has now appointed some persons on\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-3-\n\noutsourcing and they are getting higher pay than the\n\npetitioners but the services of the petitioners have not\n\nbeen regularized till date despite the fact that they have\n\n.\n\nput their efforts and lost their prime youth while serving the\n\nrespondent-University. They are stated to have made\n\nseveral requests to the respondent-University for their\n\nregularization, but in vain. Hence the writ petitions in hand.\n\nof\n\n4. The respondent has filed the replies in both\n\nthe petitions and has contested the writ petitions on the\n\nground that the writ petitioners came to be appointed\nrt\nwithout following due process of law and their services\n\ncame to be extended from time to time on their\n\nrequests. Some of the persons, who came to be\n\nappointed after them, have been appointed on regular\n\nposts because they have participated in the selection\n\nprocess and they made the grade. It is stated that the\n\npetitioners have also participated in the selection\n\nprocess but they have failed to make a grade. It is apt\n\nto reproduce para 7 of the reply filed in CWP No. 575\n\nof 2015 herein.\n\n\"7.That the University vide advertisement No.002/2011\ndated 17.4.2011 (Annexure R-9) advertised various\nNon-Teaching positions on regular basis wherein the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-4-\n\nlast date of receipt of applications was 15th May, 2011.\nThe petitioner while working with the above mentioned\nproject applied for the post of Lower Division Clerk\nagainst the same advertisement. The petitioner was not\nshort listed for the post of Lower Division Clerk due to\n\n.\n\n'overage'. Copy of screening Committee proceedings\n\nare placed at Annexure R-10. This very fact has\ndeliberately not been brought to the notice of the\nHon'ble Court by the petitioner due to the reasons best\n\nknown to her.\"\n\n5. It is also profitable to reproduce paras 9\n\nof\nand 10 of the reply filed in CWP No. 580 of 2015\n\nherein.\n\nrt\"9.That University vide advertisement\n002/2011 dated 17.4.2011 advertised various Non-\n\nNo.\n\nTeaching positions on regular basis and the\npetitioner No. 1 applied for the post of Lower\nDivision Clerk against the same advertisement.\nThe petitioner was not short listed for the post of\n\nLower Division Clerk due to 'less scores' in 10+2.\nCop of Screening Committee proceedings are\n\nplaced at Annexure R-13.

The petitioners have filed common\n\nrejoinder to both the writ petitions and have tried to\n\n.\n\ncarve out a case that other similarly situated persons\n\nhave been appointed on regular basis.\n\n7. The point germane for consideration in\n\nthese writ petitions is whether a person/employee who\n\nof\ncame to be appointed for a fixed period and thereafter\n\nextension in service was granted from time to time can\nrt\nclaim regularization, without following due process of\n\nlaw? The answer is in negative for the following\n\nreasons.\n\n8. While issuing the appointment letters, it\n\nwas made clear that they shall not be entitled for any\n\nother allowances or service benefits admissible to\n\nregular employees and this short term arrangement\n\nshall not entitle them for appointment on regular basis.\n\nThe appointment was initially for a period of three\n\nmonths and thereafter the respondents kept on\n\nextending such appointment from time to time. Writ\n\npetitioners have participated in the selection process\n\nbut failed to make grade and other similarly situated\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-6-\n\npersons made the grade thus they cannot claim\n\nregularization.\n\n9. In case, Director, Institute of Management\n\n.\n\nDevelopment, U.P. versus Smt. Pushpa Srivastava\n\nreported in AIR 1992 SC 2070, the apex Court has\n\nheld as under.\n\n\"22. In dealing with this, at page 577 (of 1990 (1) Supp SCR\n\n562) : (at p. 2238 of AIR 1990 SC 2228), the Court observed\n\nof\n\"If any person who does not possess the requisite\nqualifications is appointed under the said clause, he will\nbe liable to be replaced by a qualified person. Clause\nrt (iii) of Rule 9 states that a person appointed under\nclause (i) shall, as soon as possible, be replaced by a\n\nmember of the service or an approved candidate\nqualified to hold the post. Clause (e) of Rule 9,\nhowever, provided for regularisation of service of any\nperson appointed under clause (1) of sub-rule (a) if he\n\nhad completed continuous service of two years on\nDecember 22, 1973, notwithstanding anything\ncontained in the rules. This is a clear indication that in\n\nthe past the Government also considered it Just and\nfair to regularise the services of those who had been in\n\ncontinuous service for two years' period to the cut-off\ndate. The spirit underlying this treatment clearly shows\n\nthat the Government did not consider it just, fair or\nreasonable to terminate the services of those who were\nin employment for a period of two or more years'period\nto the cut-off date. 'This approach is quite consistent\nwith the spirit of the rule which was intended to be\ninvoked to serve emergent situations which could not\nbrook delay. Such appointments were intended to be\nstop-gap temporary appointments to serve the stated\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-7-\n\npurpose and not long term ones. The rule was not\nintended to fill a large number of posts in the service\nbut only those which could not be kept vacant till\nregular appointments were made in accordance with\nthe rules. But once the appointments continuted for\n\n.\n\nlong, the services had to be regularised if the\n\nincumbent possessed the requisite qualifications as\nwas done by subrule (e). Such an approach alone\nwould be consistent with the constitutional philosophy\n\nadverted to earlier. Even otherwise, the rule must be so\ninterpreted, if the language of the rule permits, as will\nadvance this philosophy of the Constitution. If the rule\n\nof\nis so interpreted it seems clear to us that employees\nwho have been working on the establishment since\nlong, and who possess the requisite qualifications for\nrt the job as obtaining on the date of their employment,\nmust be allowed to continue on their jobs and their\nservices should be regularised.\"\n\n10. It is apt to reproduce paras 50 to 69 of the\n\njudgment delivered by the apex Court in case\nState of\n\nU.P. versus Neeraj Awasthi & Ors.\nreported in 2006\n\nAIR SCW 123.\n\n\"50. An attempt to induct an employee without following\nthe procedure would be a backdoor appointment. Such\nbackdoor appointments have been deprecated by this\n\ncourt times without number. [see for example delhi\nDevelopment Horticulture Employees' union v. Delhi\nAdmn. (1992) 4 SCC 99, para 23].\n\n51. Even in\nState of Haryana v. Piara\nsingh [ (1992) 4\nSCC 118], whereupon the learned counsel for the\nparties relied upon, it is stated:\"ordinarily speaking, the\ncreation and abolition of a post is the prerogative of the\nExecutive. It is the Executive again that lays down the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-8-\n\nconditions of service subject, of course, to a law made\nby the appropriate legislature. This power to prescribe\nthe conditions of service can be exercised either by\nmaking rules under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nconstitution or (in the absence of such rules) by issuing\n\n.\n\nrules/instructions in exercise of its executive power.\n\nThe court comes into the picture only to ensure\nobservance of fundamental rights, statutory provisions,\nrules and other instructions, if any, governing the\n\nconditions of service. The main concern of the court in\nsuch matters is to ensure the rule of law and to see that\nthe Executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\n\nof\nemployees consistent with the requirements of\narticles\nand 16. . \"\n\n52. A 3 Judge Bench of this Court upon taking into\nrt\nconsideration a large number of decision in\nA. Umarani\nv. Registrar, Cooperative Societies and Others\n[ (2004)\n7 SCC 112] held that illegal appointments cannot be\n\nregularised. It was further held: \"no regularisation is,\nthus, permissible in exercise of the statutory power\nconferred under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution if the\n\nappointments have been made in contravention of the\nstatutory rules. \"\n\n53. The power to frame regulations is expressly\n\nconferred on the Board in terms of section 26 of the\nAct. Such regulations are to be made with the previous\n\napproval of the State government. Indisputably, the\nState Government by its letter dated 17.3.1999 refused\nto accord permission in relation thereto.\n\n54. If no appointment could be made by the State in\nexercise of its power under\nArticle 162\nof the\nConstitution of India as the same would be in\ncontravention of the statutory rules, there cannot be\nany doubt whatsoever that the board or for that matter\nthe Market Committees cannot make an appointment in\nviolation of the Act and the Regulations framed\nthereunder.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n-9-\n\n55. In Executives Engineer, ZP Engg. Divn.\nAnd\nAnother v. Digambara Rao and others\n[ (2004) 8 SCC\n262], it was held:\"it may not be out of place to mention\nthat completion of 240 days of continuous service in a\nyear may not by itself be a ground for directing an order\n\n.\n\nof regularisation. It is also not the case of the\n\nrespondents that they were appointed in accordance\nwith the extant rules. No direction for regularisation of\ntheir services, therefore, could be issued. (See\nA.\n\nUmarani v. Registrar\n, Coop. Societies and Pankaj\nGupta v. State of Jandk) submission of Mr. Maruthi Rao\nto the effect that keeping in view the fact that the\n\nof\nrespondents are diploma-holders and they have\ncrossed the age of 40 by now, this Court should not\ninterfere with the impugned judgment is stated to be\nrt\nrejected.\n\"[see also Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad, u. P.\nv. Anil Kumar Mishra and Others, (2005) 5 SCC 122]\n\n56.\nIn\nMahendra L. Jain and Others v. Indore\n\nDevelopment Authority and Others\n[ (2005) 1 SCC 639,\nit was categorically held:\"the question, therefore, which\narises for consideration is as to whether they could lay\n\na valid claim for regularisation of their services. The\nanswer thereto must be rendered in the negative.\nRegularisation cannot be claimed as a matter of right.\n\nAn illegal appointment cannot be legalised by taking\nrecourse to regularisation. What can be regularised is\n\nan irregularity and not an illegality. The constitutional\nscheme which the country has adopted does not\ncontemplate any back-door appointment. A state before\n\noffering public service to a person must comply with the\nconstitutional requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. All actions of the State must conform to\nthe constitutional requirements. A daily-wager in the\nabsence of a statutory provision in this behalf would not\nbe entitled to regularisation. (See\nState of U. P. v. Ajay\n\nkumar and Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi vishwa Vidya/aya v.\nBal Kishan Soni. ) \"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 10 -\n\n57.\nIn Manager, Reserve Bank of India, bangalore v. S.\nMani and Others [ (2005) 5 scc 100],\nUmarani\n(supra)\nwas followed holding that in law 240 days of continuous\nservice by itself give rise to permanence which reason\nhas weight with the opinion of learned single Judge of\n\n.\n\nthe High Court.\n\n58. It is, therefore, not correct to contend that only\nbecause in the correspondences between the State\nand the Board the appointments of such persons have\n\nbeen described to be irregular, the same would not\nmean that they are not illegal.\n\n59. In any event, no temporary or permanent status can\n\nof\nbe granted to an employee by way of regularisation.\n[see\nUnion of India v. Gagan Kumar\n(\n2005) 5 SCC 70\nand State of Maharashtra and Another v. R. S. Bhonde\n\nrt\nand Others (2005) 5 SCC 751].\n\n60. Mr. Chaudhary has relied upon a large number of\ndecisions to contend that this Court has directed\n\nframing of such schemes.\n\n61.\nIn\nSurya Narain Yadau and Others v. Bihar State\nElectricity Board and Others\n[ (1985) 3 SCC 38], the\n\nwrit petitioners were appointed as trainee engineers\npursuant to an advertisement issued therein.\nRepresentations have been made to them that after\n\ntheir training was completed, they would be absorbed\nin regular employment of the Board. Some employees\n\nwho were getting age-barred for government\nemployment and had left the Board were told to come\nback under the temptation of getting permanently\n\nemployed under the board. When the Board was\nreeling under a strike of its employees, these trainee\nengineers stood by the Board to keep up the\ngeneration and distribution of electricity and had been\nassured of absorption. The Board had decided to\nabsorb them on permanent basis but initially on a\nprobation of two years without conducting any further\nexamination. It was in aforementioned situation, this\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 11 -\n\nCourt applied the principles of promissory estoppel and\nobserved that the Board should have regularized the\nservices of the trainee engineers. The Court did not lay\ndown any law that regularization would be directed\ndespite the fact appointments had been made in\n\n.\n\nviolation of the rules,\n\n62.\nIn\nPiara Singh\n(supra) , this Court was beset with\nthe scheme framed by the State to regularize the\nservices of its employees. The bench did not go into\n\nthe question of validity or otherwise of such a scheme.\nWe have, however, noticed hereinbefore that even\nsuch a scheme would be impermissible in law.\n\nof\n\n63. In Madan Singh and Others etc. v. State of Haryana\nand Others [air 1988 SC 2133], this Court was dealing\nwith a matter where the State Government had come\nrt\nforward with orders from time to time for absorption of\nwork charged employees. The Court was of the opinion\nthat the benefits conferred thereunder were available to\n\nthem.\n\n64.\nIn\nRaj Narain Prasad and Others v. State of U. P.\nand Others\n[ (1998) 8 SCC 473] yet again no law has\n\nbeen laid down.\n\nNo decision other than\nPiara Singh\n\n(supra) has been referred to. Before this Court, a\nscheme was submitted in terms whereof the scheme\n\nhad undertaken to regularize work-charged employees\nemployed prior to 19.9.1985. This Court besides the\n\nproposals made therein issued certain other directions.\n\n65. Strong reliance has been placed by mr. Chaudhary\non\nR. N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah and Anr.\n[ (1972)\n\n2 SCR 799] for the proposition that irregular employees\ncan be regularized. Therein it was held :\"the contention\non behalf of the State that a rule under\nArticle 309\nfor\nregularisation of the appointment of a person would be\na form of recruitment read with reference to power\nunder\nArticle 162\nis unsound and unacceptable. The\nexecutive has the power to appoint. That power may\nhave its source in\nArticle 162.\nIn the present case the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 12 -\n\nrule which regularised the appointment of the\nrespondent with effect from February 15, 1958,\nnotwithstanding any rules cannot be said to be in\nexercise of power under\narticle 162.\nFirst,\nArticle 162\n\ndoes not speak of rules whereas\nArticle 309\nspeaks of\n\n.\n\nrules. Therefore, the present case touches the power of\n\nthe State to make rules under\nArticle 309\nof the nature\nimpeached here. Secondly when the government acted\nunder\nArticle 309\nthe government cannot be said to\n\nhave acted also under\nArticle 162\nin the same breath.\nThe two articles operate in different areas.\nRegularisation cannot be said to be a form of\n\nof\nappointment. Counsel on behalf of the respondent\ncontended that regularisation would mean conferring\nthe quality of permanence on the appointment whereas\nrt\ncounsel on behalf of the State contended that\nregularisation did dot mean permanence but that it was\na case of regularisation of the rules under\nArticle 309.\n\nBoth the contentions are fallacious. If the appointment\nitself is in infraction of the rules or if it is in violation of\nthe provisions of the Constitution illegality cannot be\n\nregularised. Ratification or regularisation is possible of\nan act which is within the power and province of the\nauthority but there has been some non-compliance with\n\nprocedure or manner which does not go to the root of\nthe appointment. Regularisation cannot be said to be a\n\nmode of recruitment. To accede to such a proposition\nwould be to introduce a new head of appointment in\ndefiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at\n\nnaught the rules. \"\n\n66. The said decision has been noticed in various\njudgments referred to hereinbefore. It instead of helping\nthe Respondents goes directly against them.\n\n67. In AH Manipur Regular Posts Vacancies Substitute\nTeachers' Association v. State of Manipur [1991 Supp\n(2) SCC 643], this Court was confronted with various\ninterim orders passed by the High Court from time to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 13 -\n\ntime in several writ petitions. It was observed that if the\ndirect recruitment takes place on one hand and\nsubstituted teachers are also directed to be regularized\nsubsequently, it would create an enormous problem for\nthe department to accommodate both the categories of\n\n.\n\npersons and in the aforementioned situation, in\n\nexercise of its power under\nArticle 142\nof the\nConstitution of India, this Court with a view to avoid\nfurther litigation and also to avoid seemingly conflicting\n\ninterim orders issued by the High Court gave certain\ndirections. Such directions having evidently been\nissued by this court in exercise of its power under\n\nof\n\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution of India do not constitute\na binding precedent. Even therein, the scope and ambit\nof this Court's jurisdiction under\nArticle 142\nvis-a-vis\nrt\nexistence of the statute and statutory rules and the\nconstitutional mandate contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India had not been taken into\n\nconsideration.\n\n68. On the other hand, in a series of decisions, which\nwe have noticed hereinbefore, this Court has now firmly\n\nlaid down the law that regularization cannot be a mode\nof appointment.\n\n69. Mr. Chaudhari has placed strong reliance upon the\n\nprovisions of the U. P. Regularisation of Adhoc\nAppointments (on Posts outside the Purview of the\n\nPublic Service commission) Rules, 1979 purported to\nhave been framed by the State in pursuance of the\nprovisions of clause (3) of\nArticle 348\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Rule 4 of the said Rules reads,\nthus :\"4. Regularisation of ad hoc appointments- (1)\nAny person who (i) was directly appointed on ad hoc\nbasis on or before June 30, 1998 and is continuing in\nservice as such on the date of commencement of the\nUttar Pradesh Regularisation of Ad hoc Appointments\n(On Posts outside the Purview of the Public service\nCommission) (Third amendment) Rules, 2001. (ii)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 14 -\n\npossessed requisite qualifications prescribed for\nregular appointment as the time of such ad hoc\nappointment; and (iii) has completed or, as the case\nmay be, after he has completed three years service\nshall be considered for regular appointments in\n\n.\n\npermanent or temporary vacancy, as may be available,\n\non the basis of his record and suitability before any\nregular appointment is made in such vacancy in\naccordance with the relevant rules or orders. (2) In\n\nmaking regular appointments under these rules\nreservations for the candidates belonging to the\nScheduled castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward\n\nof\nclasses and other categories shall be made in\naccordance with the orders of the Government in force\nat the time of recruitment. (3) For the purpose of sub-\nrtrule (1) the appointing authority shall constitute a\nselection Committee.

(5) The Selection Committee shall\n\nconsider the cases of the candidates on the basis of\ntheir records referred to in sub-rule (4). (6) The\nSelection Committee shall prepare a list of the selected\n\ncandidates, the names in the list being arranged in\norder of seniority and forward it to the appointing\nauthority. \"\n\n11. The apex court in Nagendra Chandra etc.\n\netc vs. State of Jharkhand and Ors., reported in\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 15 -\n\n2007 AIR SCW 7666 has laid down the same\n\nprinciples of law. It is apt to reproduce para 9 of\nthe\n\nsaid judgment\nherein.\n\n.\n\n\"9. In view of the foregoing discussion, we have no\n\noption but to hold that if an appointment is made in\ninfraction of the recruitment rules, the same would\n\nbe violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution and being nullity would be liable to be\ncancelled. In the present case, as the vacancies\n\nof\nwere not advertised in the newspapers, the\nappointments made were not only in infraction of\nRule 663(d) of the Bihar Police Manual but also\nrt violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution,\nwhich rendered the appointments of the appellants\n\nas illegal; as such the competent authority was\nquite justified in terminating their services and the\nHigh Court, by the impugned order, was quite\njustified in upholding the same.\"\n\n12. It is also apposite to reproduce para 9 of\n\nthe judgment delivered by the apex Court in\nState of\n\nJharkhand & others versus Manshu Kumbhkar\n,\n\nreported in 2008 AIR SCW 488.\n\n\"9 In\nAshwani Kumar and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors.\n\n(1997 (2) SCC 1), it was noted in paras 13 and 14 as\nfollows:\n\n\"13. So far as the question of confirmation of these\nemployees whose entry itself was illegal and void,\nis concerned, it is to be noted that question of\nconfirmation or regularisation of an irregularly\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 16 -\n\nappointed candidate would arise if the candidate\nconcerned is appointed in an irregular manner or\non ad hoc basis against an available vacancy\nwhich is already sanctioned. But if the initial entry\nitself is unauthorised and is not against any\n\n.\n\nsanctioned vacancy, question of regularising the\n\nincumbent on such a non-existing vacancy would\nnever survive for consideration and even if such\n\npurported regularisation or confirmation is given it\nwould be an exercise in futility. It would amount to\ndecorating a still-born baby. Under these\n\nof\ncircumstances there was no occasion to regularise\nthem or to give them valid confirmation. The so-\n\nrtcalled exercise of confirming these employees,\ntherefore, remained a nullity.\"\n\n13. The apex Court has laid down the similar\n\nprinciples of law in case Mg. Dir., Bangalore\n\nMetroloplitan Tpt. Corpn. Versus Sarojamma & Anr.\n\nreported in 2008 AIR SCW 5480.\n\n\"5. It may be mentioned that there is no principle of\nlaw that a person appointed in a temporary\n\ncapacity has a right to continue till a regular\nselection Rather, the legal position is just the\n\nreverse, that is, that a temporary employee has no\nright to the post vide\nState of U.P. v. Kaushal\nKishore\n, (1991) 1 SCC 691. Hence, he has no\nright to continue even for a day as of right, far from\nhaving a right to continue till a regular\nappointment.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 17 -\n\n6.

It is apt to reproduce para 24 of the\n\njudgment delivered by the apex Court in\nSate of\n\nHaryana & Ors. vs. Shakuntla Devi\nreported in 2008\n\nAIR SCW 8180.\n\nof\n\"24. The very fact that a regularization scheme was\nframed by the State is a clear pointer to show that the\nrtconcerned employees were not regularly employed.\nThey had sought for regularization of their service and\nat least in one case, as noticed hereinbefore, for one\n\nreason or the other, the said request was turned down.\nThe validity thereof was not questioned. It attained\nfinality.\n\nIn the case of Rama Devi, a contention was raised in\n\nthe writ petition that the offer of appointment in law was\nnot for a period of six months but for an indefinite\nperiod. Such a contention cannot be upheld. If the initial\n\nappointment was for a fixed period and the\nappointment could be terminated without any notice\n\nand without assigning any reason, such appointment\ncannot be said to be an appointment on a permanent\n\npost or a temporary sanctioned post. Unless and until\nthe post itself is a permanent or a temporary one, the\nsame would not answer the description of a substantive\nand permanent employment. In this case, it had been\nshown that the services of Karan Singh was being\nrenewed for a period of six months on the expiry of the\noriginal or extended tenure.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 18 -\n\n15. Similar principles of law have been\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe apex Court in\nState of Orissa & Anr. V.\n\nMamata Mohanti\nreported in 2011 AIR SCW 1332. It\n\n.\n\nis apposite to reproduce paras 19 and 20 of\nthe said\n\njudgment\nherein.\n\n\"19. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition that no person\ncan be appointed even on a temporary or ad hoc basis\nwithout inviting applications from all eligible candidates. If\nany appointment is made by merely inviting names from the\n\nof\nEmployment Exchange or putting a note on the Notice Board\netc. that will not meet the requirement of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. Such a course violates the mandates of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India as it deprives\nrt the candidates who are eligible for the post, from being\nconsidered. A person employed in violation of these\n\nprovisions is not entitled to any relief including salary. For a\nvalid and legal appointment mandatory compliance of the\nsaid Constitutional requirement is to be fulfilled. The equality\nclause enshrined in\nArticle 16\nrequires that every such\n\nappointment be made by an open advertisement as to\nenable all eligible persons to compete on merit.\nORDER BAD IN INCEPTION:\n\n20. It is a settled legal proposition that if an order is bad in its\ninception, it does not get sanctified at a later stage. A\n\nsubsequent action/development cannot validate an action\nwhich was not lawful at its inception, for the reason that the\nillegality strikes at the root of the order. It would be beyond\n\nthe competence of any authority to validate such an order. It\nwould be ironic to permit a person to rely upon a law, in\nviolation of which he has obtained the benefits. If an order at\nthe initial stage is bad in law, then all further proceedings\nconsequent thereto will be non est and have to be\nnecessarily set aside. A right in law exists only and only\nwhen it has a lawful origin. (vide: Upen Chandra Gogoi v.\n\nState of Assam & Ors., 1998 AIR(SC) 1289; Mangal Prasad\nTamoli (Dead) by L.Rs. v. Narvadeshwar Mishra (Dead) by\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 19 -\n\nL.Rs. & Ors., 2005 AIR(SC) 1964; and\nRitesh Tiwari & Anr. v.\nState of U.P. & Ors.\n, 2010 AIR(SC) 3823).\nThe concept of adverse possession of lien on post or holding\nover are not applicable in service jurisprudence. Therefore,\ncontinuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not\ncreate any right in his favour.\n\n(\nVide Dr. M.S. Patil v. Gulbarga\n\n.\n\nUniversity & Ors., 2010 AIR(SC) 3783).\"\n\n16.\nIn another judgment, the apex Court in\n\ncase\nBhupendra Nath Hazarika and Anr. v. State of\n\nAssam and Ors.\n, reported in 2013 AIR SCW 401, has\n\nof\nlaid down the similar principles.\n\n17. rt In a latest judgment delivered by the apex\n\nCourt in\nState of Bihar and others v. Chandreshwar\n\nPathak\nreported in 2014 AIR SCW 5182, following\n\nprinciples of law have been laid down. It is apt to\n\nreproduce paras 13 to 16 of\nthe said judgment\nherein.\n\n\"13. It is clear from the above order that the\n\nappointment has been given only on the asking of the\nInspector General of Police. There is nothing to show\n\nthat any advertisement was issued giving opportunity to\nall eligible candidates to compete or any selection\nprocess was undertaken before appointment of the\n\nrespondent.\n\n14.\nIn\nState of Orissa & Anr. vs. Mamata Mohanty\n,\n2011 3 SCC 436, it was observed as under:\n\n\"APPOINTMENT / EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT\nADVERTISEMENT:\n\n35. At one time this Court had been of the view\nthat calling the names from employment\nexchange would curb to certain extent the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 20 -\n\nmenace of nepotism and corruption in public\nemployment. But, later on, came to the\nconclusion that some appropriate method\nconsistent with the requirements of\nArticle 16\n\nshould be followed. In other words there must\n\n.\n\nbe a notice published in the appropriate manner\n\ncalling for applications and all those who apply\nin response thereto should be considered fairly.\n\nEven if the names of candidates are\n\nrequisitioned from employment exchange, in\naddition thereto it is mandatory on the part of\nthe employer to invite applications from all\n\nof\neligible candidates from the open market by\nadvertising the vacancies in newspapers having\nwide circulation or by announcement in radio\nrt and television as merely calling the names from\nthe employment exchange does not meet the\nrequirement of the said article of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n(Vide: Delhi Development Horticulture Employees\nUnion v. Delhi Admn.,\nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh\n,\n\nExcise Supdt. v. K.B.N. Visweshwara Rao, Arun\nTewari.\nv. Zila Mansavi Shikshak Sangh, Binod Kumar\nGupta v. Ram Ashray Mahoto, National Fertilizers Ltd.\n\nv.\nSomvir Singh, Telecom District Manager v. Keshab\nDeb\n,\nState of Bihar v. Upendra Narayan Singh\nand\n\nState of M.P. v. Mohd. Ibrahim\n).\n\n36. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition\nthat no person can be appointed even on a\n\ntemporary or ad hoc basis without inviting\napplications from all eligible candidates. If any\nappointment is made by merely inviting names\nfrom the employment exchange or putting a\nnote on the notice board etc. that will not meet\nthe requirement of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. Such a course violates the\nmandates of Articles 14 and 16 of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 21 -\n\nConstitution of India as it deprives the\ncandidates who are eligible for the post, from\nbeing considered. A person employed in\nviolation of these provisions is not entitled to\nany relief including salary. For a valid and legal\n\n.\n\nappointment mandatory compliance with the\n\nsaid constitutional requirement is to be fulfilled.\nThe equality clause enshrined in\nArticle 16\n\nrequires that every such appointment be made\n\nby an open advertisement as to enable all\neligible persons to compete on merit.\"\n\n15. No contrary view of this Court has been cited on\n\nof\nbehalf of the respondent. Moreover, another Division\nBench of the same High Court has upheld termination\nin similar matter as noted earlier against which S.L.P.\nrt has been dismissed by this Court as mentioned earlier.\n\n16. Accordingly, it has to be held that in the absence of\nany advertisement or selection process, the\n\nappointment of the respondent is not protected and\ncould be validly terminated. Learned single Judge was\njustified in dismissing the writ petition while the Division\n\nBench erred in interfering with the same.\"\n\n18. Applying the test in these cases, the\n\npetitioners have failed to make out a case. The apex\n\nCourt has gone further while laying down the ratio that\n\neven if a person has spent 14 or 20 years of service in\n\nan institution, came to be appointed without due\n\nprocess of law, is a back-door entry and cannot claim\n\nregularization. The termination of such employee has\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 22 -\n\nbeen held valid even without issuing a notice, as\n\ndiscussed hereinabove.\n\n19. This question arose before the Division\n\n.\n\nBench of this Court in a batch of LPAs and CWPs, lead\n\ncase of which is LPA No. 107 of 2014 titled Amit Attri\n\nand others versus Anil Verma and others, and this\n\nCourt, after discussing the entire facts and law\n\nof\napplicable, laid down the same proposition of law. It is\n\napt to reproduce para 16 to 21 and 24 of the said\nrt\njudgment herein.\n\n\"16.It is worthwhile to record herein that the\n\npetitioners have accepted the terms and conditions,\nas contained in their appointment orders, one of\nwhich stands reproduced supra. They have been\n\nappointed purely on lecturer/hourly basis for one\nhour lecturer basis, cannot claim regularization.\n\n17.The apex Court in\nIndu Shekhar Singh & Ors. vs.\nState of U.P. & Ors\nreported in 2006 AIR SCW 2582\n\nin para 24 held as under:\n\n\"24. The State was making an offer to the Respondents\n\nnot in terms of any specific power under Rules, but in\nexercise of its residuary power (assuming that the same\nwas available). The State, therefore, was within its right\nto impose conditions. The Respondents exercised their\nright of election. They could have accepted the said\noffer or rejected the same. While making the said offer,\nthe State categorically stated that for the purpose of\nfixation of seniority, they would not be obtaining the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 23 -\n\nbenefits of services rendered in U.P. Jal Nigam and\nwould be placed below in the cadre till the date of\nabsorption. The submission of Mr. Verma that for the\nperiod they were with the Authority by way of\ndeputation, should have been considered towards\n\n.\n\nseniority cannot be accepted simply for the reason that\n\ntill they were absorbed, they continued to be in the\nemployment of the Jal Nigam. Furthermore, the said\ncondition imposed is backed by another condition that\n\nthe deputed employee who is seeking for absorption\nshall be placed below the officers appointed in the\ncadre till the date of absorption. The Respondent Nos.2\n\nof\nto 4 accepted the said offer without any demur on\n3.9.87, 28.11.91 and 6.4.87 respectively.\n\n25. They, therefore, exercised their right of option. Once\nrt they obtained entry on the basis of election, they\ncannot be allowed to turn round and contend that the\nconditions are illegal. [See\nR.N. Gosain vs. Yashpal Dhir\n\n(\n1992) 4 SCC 683, Ramankutty Guptan vs. Avara\n(\n1994)\n2 SCC 642 and Bank of India & Ors. vs. O.P. Swarnakar &\nOrs.\n(2003) 2 SCC 721.] Further more, there is no\nfundamental right in regard to the counting of the\n\nservices rendered in an autonomous body. The past\nservices can be taken into consideration only when the\nRules permit the same or where a special situation\n\nexists, which would entitle the employee to obtain such\nbenefit of past service.\"\n\n18.In University of Rajasthan and Anr. v. Prem\nLata Agarwal\nalongwith other connected\n\nmatters reported in 2013 AIR SCW 989, the apex\nCourt in para 34 held as under:\n\n\"34. In view of the aforesaid, the irresistible conclusion is\nthat the continuance after the fixed duration goes to\nthe root of the matter. That apart, the teachers were\nallowed to continue under certain compelling\ncircumstances and by interdiction by courts. Quite\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 24 -\n\napart from the above, this Court had categorically\ndeclined to accede to the prayer for regularization. In\nsuch a situation, we are afraid that the reliance placed\nby the High Court on paragraph 53 of the\npronouncement in Uma Devi, (AIR 2003 SC 1806) can\n\n.\n\nbe said to be justified. In this regard, another aspect,\n\nthough an ancillary one, may be worth noting. Prem\nLata Agarwal and B.K. Joshi had retired on 31.3.2001\nand 31.1.2002, and by no stretch of imagination,\nUma\n\nDevi\n(supra) lays down that the cases of any category\nof appointees who had retired could be regularized.\n\nWe may repeat at the cost of repetition that the\n\nof\nprotection carved out in paragraph 53 in\nUma Devi\n\n(supra) could not be extended to the respondents\nbasically for three reasons, namely, (i) that the\nrt continuance of appointment after the fixed duration\nwas null and void by operation of law; (ii) that the\nrespondent continued in the post by intervention of the\n\ncourt; and (iii) that this Court had declined to regularize\ntheir services in 1998.\"\n\n19. In Chief Executive Officer, Pondichery\n\nKhadi and Village Industries Board and Anr v. K.\nAroquia Radja and Ors reported in 2013 AIR SCW\n\n1759, it was held as under:\n\n\"17. The learned Single Judge who heard the Writ\nPetition No.3181 of 2008 and also the Division Bench\nwhich heard the writ appeal could not have ignored\n\nthat the respondents were clearly told that their services\nwere co- terminus, and they will have no right to be\nemployed thereafter. Condition No.4 and 6 of the\nearlier referred terms and condition are very clear in this\nbehalf. The respondents had taken the co-terminus\nappointment with full understanding. It was not\npermissible for them to challenge their dis- engagement\nwhen the tenure of the Chairman was over........\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 25 -\n\n18. As stated by this Court in Umadevi (supra),\nabsorption, regularization or permanent continuance of\ntemporary, contractual, casual, daily-wage or adhoc\nemployees appointed/recruited and continued for long\nin public employment dehors the constitutional scheme\n\n.\n\nof public employment is impermissible and violative of\n\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. As\nrecorded in paragraph 53 of the report in SCC, (para 44\nof AIR 2006 SC 1806) this Court has allowed as a one\n\ntime measure, regularization of services of irregularly\nappointed persons, provided they have worked for ten\nyears or more in duly sanctioned posts. That is also not\n\nof\nthe case in the present matter.\"\n\n20.In Hari Nandan Prasad and Anr. v.\nrt\nEmployer I/R to Management of FCI and Anr.\nreported in 2014 AIR SCW 1383 the apex Court in\n\npara 34 held as under:\n\n\"34. On harmonious reading of the two judgments\ndiscussed in detail above, we are of the opinion that\n\nwhen there are posts available, in the absence of any\nunfair labour practice the Labour Court would not give\ndirection for regularization only because a worker has\n\ncontinued as daily wage worker/adhoc/temporary\nworker for number of years. Further, if there are no posts\n\navailable, such a direction for regularization would be\nimpermissible. In the aforesaid circumstances giving of\ndirection to regularize such a person, only on the basis\n\nof number of years put in by such a worker as daily\nwager etc. may amount to backdoor entry into the\nservice which is an anathema to\nArt.14\nof the\nConstitution. Further, such a direction would not be\ngiven when the concerned worker does not meet the\neligibility requirement of the post in question as per the\nRecruitment Rules. However, wherever it is found that\nsimilarly situated workmen are regularized by the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 26 -\n\nemployer itself under some scheme or otherwise and\nthe workmen in question who have approached\nIndustrial/Labour Court are at par with them, direction\nof regularization in such cases may be legally justified,\notherwise, non-regularization of the left over workers\n\n.\n\nitself would amount to invidious discrimination qua them\n\nin such cases and would be violative of\nArt.14\nof the\nConstitution. Thus, the Industrial adjudicator would be\nachieving the equality by upholding\nArt. 14\n, rather than\n\nviolating this constitutional provision.\"\n\n21. Applying the ratio of the aforesaid apex\n\nof\nCourt's judgments to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case, one comes\nto rt an inescapable conclusion that the\ncandidates, who have got appointment/\n\nengagement on hourly basis or seasonal basis,\ncannot claim regularization, not to speak of\ndeclaring him/them to have been appointed on\n\ncontract basis.\n\n22-23..... ....... ...... .......\n\n24. As discussed hereinabove, the petitioners\n\nhave no right for seeking a writ of mandamus to\n\ndeclare them to be appointed on contract\nbasis. It is also well established that a person,\n\nwho is appointed without following due process\nof law, cannot claim that he should be declared\nto have been appointed in due course, in terms\nof the judgment titled Secretary, State of\nKarnataka and others vs. Uma Devi (3) and\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 27 -\n\nothers (2006) 4 SCC1. It is apt to reproduce\npara 45 of the said judgment herein:\n\n\"45. While directing that appointments, temporary or\ncasual, be regularized or made permanent, the courts\nare swayed by the fact that the person concerned has\n\n.\n\nworked for some time and in some cases for a\nconsiderable length of time. It is not as if the person\nwho accepts an engagement either temporary or\n\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\nemployment. He accepts the employment with open\neyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\n\nof\nbargain -- not at arms length -- since he might have\nbeen searching for some employment so as to eke out\nhis livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on\nthat ground alone, it would not be appropriate to\nrt jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and\nto take the view that a person who has temporarily or\n\ncasually got employed should be directed to be\ncontinued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not\npermissible. If the court were to void a contractual\n\nemployment of this nature on the ground that the\nparties were not having equal bargaining power, that\ntoo would not enable the court to grant any relief to\n\nthat employee. A total embargo on such casual or\ntemporary employment is not possible, given the\n\nexigencies of administration and if imposed, would only\nmean that some people who at least get employment\ntemporarily, contractually or casually, would not be\n\ngetting even that employment when securing of such\nemployment brings at least some succor to them. After\nall, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in\nsearch of employment and one is not compelled to\naccept a casual or temporary employment if one is not\ninclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that\ncontext that one has to proceed on the basis that the\nemployment was accepted fully knowing the nature of\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 28 -\n\nit and the consequences flowing from it. In other words,\neven while accepting the employment, the person\nconcerned knows the nature of his employment. It is not\nan appointment to a post in the real sense of the term.\nThe claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\n\n.\n\ntemporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot\n\nbe considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable\nthe giving up of the procedure established, for making\nregular appointments to available posts in the services\n\nof the State. The argument that since one has been\nworking for some time in the post, it will not be just to\ndiscontinue him, even though he was aware of the\n\nof\nnature of the employment when he first took it up, is not\none that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure\nestablished by law for public employment and would\nrt have to fail when tested on the touchstone of\nconstitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined\nin\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\"\n\n20. This judgment was questioned before the\n\napex Court by the medium of SLP but the same was\n\ndismissed vide order dated 30.3.2015 in SLP No\n\n9089-9090 of 2015 titled\nAnil Verma & others versus\n\nAmit Attri and others\netc.\n\n21. Again, this question arose before the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in a batch of LPAs and writ\n\npetitions, lead case of which is CWP No. 6916 of 2011\n\nand the same principles of law were laid down, though\n\nthe facts were slightly different.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 19:34:51 :::HCHP\n\n- 29 -\n\n22.
