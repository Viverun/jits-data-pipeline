It will be recalled that the matter was heard at length\n\nin the context of prayer for interim relief and this Bench of\n\nthe Tribunal had passed the following order dated\n\n24.02.2023 in OA No.556/2023:\n\n \"After notice, matter is listed today for consideration\n on applicants' prayer for grant of interim relief. The\n applicants have sought interim relief in the form of\n restraining the respondents from terminating the\n contractual services of the applicants and further to\n direct the respondents to allow the applicants to\n continue in their present contractual status under\n them till disposal of the OA.\n\n Though, no reply/short reply has been filed, however,\n as the matter is listed today for consideration of the\n applicant's prayer for grant of interim relied, with the\n consent of learned counsels for the parties, the matter\n is taken up.\n\n (19)\n\nIt is the case of the applicants that pursuant to an\nadvertisement issued by the respondents, the\napplicants participated in the selection process for\ncontractual engagement under the respondents and on\nbeing found suitable and eligible for the respective\nposts, the applicants were engaged by the Competent\nAuthority amongst the respondents and since, then\nthey have been working and performing under the\nrespondents to the entire satisfaction of the\nCompetent Authority. However, during their such\nemployment, the respondents have started a fresh\nselection process to fill up the posts against which the\napplicants had already been working on contract and\nthey were confident of their fresh selection process,\nthey have also applied. However, the applicants have\nbeen declared unsuccessful in the said selection\nprocess.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicants has argued that\nonce the applicants have been selected and engaged\non contract basis and their contract still exists, there\nwas no requirement to conduct a fresh selection\nprocess for filling up the posts against which the\napplicants have been working and performing to the\nentire satisfaction of the respondents. However, they\nhave been declared fail in the second selection process\nonly to ensure that the respondents can be able to\nreplace the applicants by another set of contractual\nemployees.\n\nIn this background, the applicants have challenged the\ncircular dated 09.02.2023 (Annexure A/1) and also the\nadvertisement dated 14.02.2023 to the extend the\nsame pertains to the applicants.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicants submits that the\naction of the respondents in attempting to replace one\nset of contractual employees by another set of\ncontractual employees is contrary to the law laid down\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court, which have been followed\nby the Hon'ble High Court and also this Tribunal in a\ncatena of cases and recently, by this Tribunal in order\ndated 05.03.2021 in OA No. 2112/2020, titled Ashok\nKumar and Ors. V/s Govt. of NCT of Delhi (Annexure\nA-9). He has also placed reliance upon certain interim\norders passed by this Tribunal to contain that in such\nfacts and circumstances, the applicants are entitled for\n\n (20)\n\ngrant of interim relief. He has submitted that the\napplicants are engaged by the Competent Authority\nafter following the due process of selection process\nand the performance of the applicants have been\ncertified by the Competent Authority amongst the\nrespondents to be satisfactory and even the\nCompetent Authority has recommended the extension\nof the contract and also amount of increment to be\naccorded to the applicants. As such the action of the\nrespondents in disengaging the applicants is illegal and\narbitrary.\n\nOn the other hand, learned counsel for the\nrespondents have vehemently opposed the prayer of\nthe applicants for grant of any interim relief. Learned\ncounsel for the respondents has not disputed that the\napplicants were engaged on contract basis by the\nCompetent Authority through a due selection process\nand they have been working as such under the\nrespondents till date. However, the learned counsel for\nthe respondents have invited our attention to the offer\nof contractual engagement dated 26.02.2021 (page\n\n190) to contend that though the initial contract was for\nthree years i.e. likely to end by 25.02.2024 and the\nsaid contract was also extendable, however as per\npara 4 (ii) of the said order dated 26.02.2021,\nperformance of the applicants were to be reviewed\nperiodically and if the performance is not found up to\nmark, the tenure is liable to be terminated without\nassigning any reason after serving one month of\nadvance notice or one month's remuneration in lieu\nthereof.\n\nLearned counsels for the respondents has argued that\nin the present case, the applicants performance have\nnot been found satisfactory/up to the mark and they\nhave rightly been put under notice before the\norder/orders has/have been passed for their\ndisengagement.\n\nThey have further added that pursuant to the fresh\nadvertisement issued vide their selection process\nnotified vide orders dated 05.08.2022 and 14.02.2023\netc., various persons, including the applicants have\nvoluntarily participated in the selection process.\nHowever, they have failed therein and thus, they are\nnot entitled to challenge the selection process\n\n (21)\n\ncompeted by the respondents pursuant to such\nnotifications.\n\nLearned counsel for the respondents further placed\nreliance on the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in Union of India V/s C Girija, judgment dated\n13.02.2019. Paras 13 to 17 of the same thereof:\n\n\"13. The law on the subject has been crystallised in\nseveral decisions of this Court. \nIn\n\nChandra Prakash Tiwari v. Shakuntala Shukla\n, (2002)\n6 SCC 127, this Court laid down the principle that\nwhen a candidate appears at an examination without\nobjection and is subsequently found to be not\nsuccessful, a challenge to the process is precluded.\nThe question of entertaining a petition challenging an\nexamination would not arise where a candidate has\nappeared and participated. He or she cannot\nsubsequently turn around and contend that the\nprocess was unfair or that there was a lacuna therein,\nmerely because the result is not palatable.\n \nIn \nUnion of\nIndia v. S. Vinodh Kumar\n, (2007) 8 SCC 100, this\nCourt held that: (SCC p. 107, para 18) \"18. It is also\nwell settled that those candidates who had taken part\nin the selection process knowing fully well the\nprocedure laid down therein were not entitled to\nquestion the same.\n \n(See \nMunindra Kumar v. Rajiv\nGovil\n, (\n1991) 3 SCC 368 and Rashmi Mishra v. M.P.\nPublic Service Commission\n, (2006) 12 SCC 724.)\"\n\n14. The same view was reiterated in Amlan Jyoti\nBorooah, (2009) 3 SCC 227, wherein it was held to be\nwell settled that the candidates who have taken part in\na selection process knowing fully well the procedure\nlaid down therein are not entitled to question it upon\nbeing declared to be unsuccessful.\n\n15. \nIn \nManish Kumar Shahi v. State of Bihar\n, (2010)\n12 SCC 576, the same principle was reiterated in the\nfollowing observations: (SCC p. 584, para 16) \"16. We\nalso agree with the High Court that after having taken\npart in the process of selection knowing fully well that\nmore than 19% marks have been earmarked for viva\nvoce test, the petitioner is not entitled to challenge the\ncriteria or process of selection. Surely, if the\npetitioner's name had appeared in the merit list, he\nwould not have even dreamed of challenging the\n\n (22)\n\nselection. The petitioner invoked jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of\nIndia only after he found that his name does not figure\nin the merit list prepared by the Commission. This\nconduct of the petitioner clearly disentitles him from\nquestioning the selection and the High Court did not\ncommit any error by refusing to entertain the writ\npetition.\n \nReference in this connection may be made to\nthe judgments in Madan Lal v. State of J&K, (\n1995) 3\nSCC 486, Marripati Nagaraja v. State of A.P.\n, (\n2007)\n11 SCC 522, Dhananjay Malik v. State of Uttaranchal\n,\n(\n2008) 4 SCC 171, Amlan Jyoti Borooah v. State of\nAssam\n, (\n2009) 3 SCC 327 and K.A. Nagamani v.\nIndian Airlines\n, (2009) 5 SCC 515.\"\n\n16. \nIn \nVijendra Kumar Verma v. Public Service\nCommission\n, (2011) 1 SCC 150, candidates who had\nparticipated in the selection process were aware that\nthey were required to possess certain specific\nqualifications in computer operations. The appellants\nhad appeared in the selection process and after\nparticipating in the interview sought to challenge the\nselection process as being without jurisdiction. This\nwas held to be impermissible.\n\n17. \nIn \nRamesh Chandra Shah v. Anil Joshi\n, (2013) 11\nSCC 309, candidates who were competing for the post\nof Physiotherapist in the State of Uttarakhand\nparticipated in a written examination held in\npursuance of an advertisement. This Court held that if\nthey had cleared the test, the respondents would not\nhave raised any objection to the selection process or\nto the methodology adopted. Having taken a chance of\nselection, it was held that the respondents were\ndisentitled to seek relief under \nArticle 226\n and would\nbe deemed to have waived their right to challenge the\nadvertisement or the procedure of selection. This\nCourt held that: (SCC p. 318, para 18) \"18. It is\nsettled law that a person who consciously takes part in\nthe process of selection cannot, thereafter, turn\naround and question the method of selection and its\noutcome.\"\n\nWe have pursued the pleadings available on records\nand we have also considered the submission made by\nthe learned counsels for the parties.\n\n (23)\n\nIt is not in dispute that the applicants have been\nengaged on contract basis on the basis of their\nperformance by the Competent Authority and they are\nstill continuing under the respondents in such capacity.\nWe have also gone through the performance and\nappraisal given by the Competent Authority amongst\nthe respondents and one such being available at\n(Annexure A-11 Colly). In the last paragraph of such\nappraisal reports the Competent Authority has also\nrecommended that the amount of increment to be at\n7%. Once it is on record that the period of contract\nhas not ended and even recently, the Competent\nAuthority amongst the respondents have not only\nrecommended for extension of contract, but has also\nrecommended that the increment to be accorded to\nthe applicants, no prima facie reasons behind the\naction/orders of the respondents in requiring the\napplicants to participate in another selection process is\nfound. Further, it is also not the case of the\nrespondents that subsequent to such recommendation\nin the appraisal report, the performance of the\napplicants has dropped below the benchmarks and/or\nexpectation.\n\nNo such documents have also been referred to and\nbrought to our notice.\n\nSo far, the law referred to by the learned counsel for\nthe respondents is concerned once somebody has\ntaken a chance to participate in a selection process is\nprecluded from attacking the same selection process,\nthere is no doubt in our mind about such law.\nHowever, in the facts and circumstances, and that too\nat this preliminary stage, we do not find judgment\nreferred and to relied upon by the learned counsel for\nthe parties to be of any help to them. It is not\ndisputed by the learned counsel for the parties that it\nis a settled law that one set of contractual employees\nis ordinarily not required to be replaced by another set\nof contractual employees. We also do not find any\nreason that if the applicant selected and engaged by\nthe Competent Authority through a valid selection\nprocess initiated by them and their contractual period\nstill exists, the respondents should take any action\nand/or pass any order to re-place their service by\nanother set of contractual employees.\n\n (24)\n\n Prima facie, we find that the claim of the applicants\n gets support from the judgment of this Tribunal dated\n 05.03.2021, wherein the Tribunal has referred to and\n relied on the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court India in the State of Haryana and Ors. V/s Piara\n Singh and followed by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi.\n In view of the aforesaid, as an interim measure, the\n respondents are directed not to terminate the services\n of the applicants and to maintain status quo qua their\n services till the next date of hearing.\n\n List the matter for further consideration on\n 05.04.2023.\"\n\n3. Accordingly, the OAs have been taken up for final\n\nhearing. However, OA No.556/2023 & OA No.597/2023 have\n\nbeen taken as lead case with the consent of learned\n\ncounsels for both the sides for ease of adjudication. The\n\nrespondents have filed counter reply refuting the claims\n\nmade in the OAs. The applicant has also filed rejoinder and\n\nadditional affidavit to buttress their claim. Further, both the\n\nparties have filed their written submissions.\n\n4. We have perused the pleadings on record and also\n\nheard the learned counsels for both the sides. In support of\n\nhis argument that the applicant cannot be allowed to\n\ncontinue against the contractual post they are holding, the\n\nlearned counsel for the respondents draws our attention to\n\nClause 4 of the newly notified Recruitment Rules of\n\n03.08.2022 which states that all the employees in SAI\n\nworking on any of the post mentioned in the Annexure-I on\n\n (25)\n\nthe date these rules come into force shall be deemed to\n\nhave been appointed under these rules. He submits that\n\nAnnexure A-1 indicates the sanctioned posts created in the\n\nnew RRs and as no such posts existed earlier applicants\n\nhave no claim to continue against the post which no longer\n\nexist. The learned counsels for the applicants on the other\n\nhand argue that since the applicants were appointed to the\n\nvarious posts, including the post mentioned in Annexure A-\n\n1, they are covered under the aforesaid Clause-4 of the new\n\nRecruitment Rules. In support of such assertion, the\n\napplicants have contended that in fact the same posts have\n\nbeen advertised such as Physiotherapist, Physiologists and\n\nNutritionists etc. against which the applicants were working\n\nbut in the guise of cadre restructuring/RRs, the respondents\n\nhave attempted to replace the services of the applicants with\n\nanother set of contractual employees.\n\n5. It has also been contended by the applicants that\n\nwhile the respondents are well within their right in carrying\n\nout the exercise of cadre restructuring but while doing so,\n\nthey cannot replace the services of the applicants with\n\nanother set of contractual employees in contravention of law\n\nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nState of\n\nHaryana vs. Piara Singh\n (1992) 4 SCC 118.\n\n (26)\n\n6. Alluding to the advertisement, learned counsels for the\n\napplicants submit that the respondents have initiated\n\nprocess to make appointment in place of applicants as per\n\nthe cited Recruitment Rules which entail that the vacancies\n\nare required to be filled up through an open competition on\n\nregular basis, whereas the respondents have issued\n\nimpugned advertisements dated 05.08.2022 and 12.09.2022\n\nto make appointment on contract basis in place of\n\napplicants, which cannot be said to be on regular basis.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other\n\nhand, submits that the essence of the judgment in the case\n\nof \nState of Haryana vs. Piara Singh\n (supra), which the\n\napplicants relied upon, is that an adhoc or temporary\n\nemployee should not be replaced by another adhoc or\n\ntemporary employee and he must be replaced only by a\n\nregularly selected employee. He further argues that this is\n\nnot the case of replacement of one set of adhoc or\n\ncontractual employees by another set of adhoc or\n\ncontractual or temporary employees. This is a case of\n\nappointment of employees in cadre with different\n\nqualifications by a regular process of selection, replacing\n\nthose employees who were appointed against non-cadre\n\nposts on adhoc basis without following any Recruitment\n\n (27)\n\nRules as no Recruitment Rules for appointment were then in\n\nvogue.\n\n8. He draws our attention to the submissions made in the\n\ncounter reply in this regard, reiterating that there were no\n\nexisting Recruitment Rules and no defined cadre when the\n\npetitioners were appointed by Sports Authority of India for\n\nMinistry of Youth Affairs and Sports against Khelo India\n\nproject. Recruitment Rules were framed by Respondent\n\nNo.1, subsequently providing a cadre of National Centre for\n\nSports Sciences & Research (NCSSR) with structured\n\nqualifications, following which a regular process of selection\n\nwas started for appointment to cadre posts. All the existing\n\nposts were surrendered to MoYS and all the existing\n\nemployees were given opportunity to compete in open\n\nselection process along with other qualified for appointment.\n\nThis exercise was done as a result of cadre restructuring in\n\nSAI notified by MoYS for all cadres on 22.09.2021. As a\n\nconsequence of cadre restructuring, new Recruitment Rules\n\nfor different cadres were approved. As per the new\n\nRecruitment Rules notified on 03.08.2022, the total\n\nsanctioned strength for scientific cadre is 384 which also\n\nprovides for minimum qualification for each posts. The posts\n\n (28)\n\nwere included under two broad categories: High\n\nPerformance Analyst and Performance Analyst.\n\n9. The advertisements were accordingly issued against\n\nrestructured sanctioned posts for recruitment on contract\n\nbasis for a maximum period of 8 years, renewed on annual\n\nbasis based on performance. The people who are already\n\nworking on contract including the petitioners were given\n\nequal opportunity to apply against newly sanctioned posts\n\nand many of them actually participated in the selection\n\nprocess. 26 of them were finally selected as per the new\n\nRecruitment Rules. It is further argued that the petitioners\n\nare estopped to challenge the selection process once they\n\nhave participated in the selection process. He relies upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court \nUnion of India vs.\n\nC. Girija\n (2019) 15 SCC 633 in support of his contention\n\nand also cites a catena of judgments to contend that no\n\nfurther stay should be granted in cases of termination of\n\nservice. He also submits that the learned counsels for the\n\napplicants have misread that Rule 4 of the new Recruitment\n\nRules 2022 which clearly mentions that all the employees\n\nwho were already working against the sanctioned posts were\n\ndeemed to have been appointed under these rules, whereas\n\nthere were no sanctioned posts against which the applicants\n\n (29)\n\nwere actually appointed. Thus, he makes a distinction within\n\nthe class of contractual employees engaged by SAI as non-\n\ncadre and cadre, submitting that the contractual employees\n\nworking against the cadre/sanctioned posts under 2022\n\nrules are on a different footing from the applicants.\n\n11. It is not in dispute that the SAI had notified its\n\nservices By-Laws and Condition of Service Regulations, 1992\n\nwhich became effective from 5th September, 1992 wherein\n\nit was stipulated that all actions pertaining to conditions of\n\nservices and relating to service matters till the date of\n\ncommencement of these rules shall be deemed to have been\n\ntaken under the authority of these bye-laws and rules. In\n\nPara 8 of the said regulation under caption \"Method of\n\nRecruitment\" mentions the following methods:\n\n a) Promotion\n b) Direct Recruitment\n c) Deputation\n\n d) Re-employment of a retired employee of the\n Society or Central/State Government or any other\n Organisation\n\n e) On contract for a specified period on technical\n personnel on specified terms as approved by\n Vice-Chairperson, SAI.\n\n12. The present petitioners who were engaged following\n\ndifferent advertisements circulated/published for\n\n (30)\n\nengagement on contract basis on different dates between\n\n26.10.2020 to 29.01.2021 were engaged following due\n\nprocess under the category (e) i.e. on contract as\n\nstipulated in the notified rules in 1992. Therefore, even if\n\ntheir engagement was contractual, this was done as per\n\nthe relevant regulation following a selection method.\n\nThus, the submissions made by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents that prior to 2022, there were no rules for\n\nselection in place is contrary to above facts.\n\n13. This is also not in dispute that various posts under\n\nthe two categories (i) High Performance Analyst (ii)\n\nPerformance Analyst, subsequent to restructuring were\n\nadvertised. We have perused the advertisement dated\n\n05.08.2022 (Annexure A-2) issued by the SAI which reads\n\nas under:\n\n \"ENGAGEMENT OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYST\n (Physiotherapists, Strength & Conditioning Experts\n Physiologists, Psychologists, Biomechanics,\n Nutritionists & Biochemists) On CONTRACT BASIS IN\n SAI NCOEs.\n\n Sports Authority of India (SAI) is an autonomous\n organization under the administrative control of the\n Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports with its Head\n Quarters at Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, Lodhi\n Road, New Delhi-110003\n\n SAI has established 23 National Centres of\n Excellence across the country for training of young\n and elite athletes in various disciplines. These\n NCOEs are funded for several items inter-alia sports\n\n (31)\n\n science staff through Khelo India Scheme of Ministry\n of Youth Affairs & Sports. To strengthen the NCOEs,\n SAI invites applications from eligible candidates for\n engagement as High Performance Anh\n (Physiotherapists Strength & Conditioning Experts,\n Physiologists, Psychologists, Biomechanics\n Nutritionists, & Biochemists) on contract basis at\n various SAI NCOEs. The employment is initially for 1\n year, further extendable in cycle of 1 year up to a\n maximum of 8 years the basis of performance.\"\n\n14. It is apparent that the engagement of various\n\ncategories of posts which were advertised was to be done\n\non contract basis alone. The advertisement also goes on\n\nto specify their terms of engagement stating that the\n\nengagement is initially for one year, further extendable in\n\ncycle of 1 year upto a maximum of 8 years on the basis of\n\nperformance. The advertisement also specifies the posts,\n\npay, nature of duties, eligibility criteria including the\n\nessential qualification and experience etc. Further, it says\n\nthat the contract can be terminated by giving a 30 days'\n\nnotice period by either party i.e. SAI and the employee.\n\n15. The plea taken by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents is that vide this advertisement it was\n\nintended to fill up the various vacancies against the posts\n\nsanctioned whereas in earlier advertisement the posts\n\nwere to be filled up against non-sanctioned posts.\n\n (32)\n\n16. We have perused the advertisements against which\n\nthe present petitioners were engaged. The advisements\n\nstate that the posts are to be filled up on contract basis,\n\nspecifying the essential qualification, selection process and\n\nterms of engagement etc. as has been done in the\n\nadvertisements of 2022 issued after notification of\n\nRecruitment Rules but neither in the advertisements\n\nagainst which the applicants were appointed nor the\n\nimpugned advertisements mention if the posts are to be\n\nfilled in or are sanctioned or non-sanctioned, Or cadre or\n\nnon cadre. In their offer of contractual engagement also,\n\nthere is no such indication. It has been further stipulated\n\nin the advertisements that they will abide by CCS\n\n(Conduct) Rules, 1964 to the extent of applicability as in\n\nthe case of impugned advertisements (Annexure A-6A).\n\nTherefore, we find similarity in the two advertisements\n\nissued and in both the cases the engagement was to be\n\nmade on contractual basis.\n\n17. Further, vide Recruitment Rules of 2022, though the\n\nrespondents have created two broad categories, High\n\nPerformance Analyst and Performance Analyst but the\n\nnomenclature of the posts within their categories and\n\n (33)\n\nresponsibilities assigned, has remained the same more or\n\nless, as was the case earlier.\n\n18. This is also not in dispute that the applicants were\n\nappointed through open advertisement on the\n\nrecommendations of the select committee constituted by\n\nthe competent authority and they also possessed the\n\nrequisite qualification as prescribed in the RRs of 2022\n\nafter meeting the eligibility criteria and on being found\n\neligible by duly constituted selection board. It is also seen\n\nthat within two groups i.e. High Performance Analyst and\n\nPerformance Analyst, the respondents have appointed\n\npersons as Physiotherapists, Nutritionists, Strength &\n\nConditioning Experts, Anthropometries and Masseurs as in\n\nthe case of applicants. There is no significant variation in\n\nthe educational qualification either. For example in case of\n\nPhysiotherapist, eligibility criteria in the first advertisement\n\nwherein the applicants were appointed was MPT+ 3 years\n\nexperience whereas in the new RRs it is BPT + 5 years\n\nexperience/MPT + 3 years experience. Similarly in case of\n\nAnthropometries, eligibility criteria in case of applicants\n\nwas Masters' Degree in Physical Anthropology or Human\n\nBiology/PHD, whereas in case of newly notified RRs, its\n\nBachelors' degree in Physical Anthropology or Human\n\n (34)\n\nBiology/Master or higher. A bare reading of the eligibility\n\ncriteria with regard to other posts also indicates that by\n\nand large the eligibility criteria has remained the same in\n\nboth the cases, albeit it has been reduced/diluted in some\n\ncases in the new RRs, in fact.\n\n19. A perusal of the performance appraisal of the\n\napplicants indicates that it has been adjudged above board\n\nand even recommendations were made for giving\n\nperformance based increments, keeping in view their\n\nabove par performance.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the respondents has argued that\n\nlaw of estoppel applies in the case of petitioners as they\n\nthemselves appeared in the selection process with regard\n\nto the posts advertised in the context of the notified RRs\n\nand after participating in the process they cannot claim the\n\nrelief sought for. However, given higher remuneration and\n\nbetter prospects if some of the applicants have appeared\n\nfor the newly advertised posts, we do not see anything\n\namiss, more particularly, when they have not questioned\n\nthe exercise of cadre restructuring but only objected to\n\ntheir replacement. The Hon'ble Supreme Court vide Civil\n\nAppeal No.4578-4580/2022 decided on 16.06.2022 in the\n\ncase of Krishna Rai (Dead) through LRs, vs BHU\n\n (35)\n\nthrough Registrar & Ors. held that there cannot be any\n\nestoppels in law and no aggrieved person can be deprived\n\nfrom his legal right as per the law of the land.\n\n21. To our mind, since the basic principle in vogue is\n\nthat the applicants cannot be replaced by another set of\n\ncontractual employee, which tantamounts to the\n\ninfringement of legal rights of the applicants, the law of\n\nestoppel is not applicable.\n\n22. Learned counsel for the respondents has also placed\n\nreliance on the following judgments:\n\n \n\"a. State of Haryana v. Suman Dutta (2000) 10 SCC\n 311-Para\n\n b. \nState of U.P. v. Sandeep Kumar Balmiki\n (2009) 17\n 755 - Para 5\n\n c. \nBhankara Byas Managing Board v. Suresh-\n(2009) 7\n SCC 515 - Para2\n\n d. \nU.P. Juniors Doctors Action Committee v. B. Sheetal\n Nandwani\n 1992 Supp (1) SCC 680 - Para 8\n\n e. \nAir India Limited v. Aditya Beri\n 2012 SCC Online Del\n 3014 Para 7\n\n f. \nCo-operative Store Ltd., Super Bazaar v. Super\n Bazaar Karamchari Hitesh Sangathan\n 2012 SCC Online\n Del 5431 -Para 9\n\n g. \nRohit Sharma v. Union of India & Ors.\n 2021 SCC\n Online Del 2444 Para-10.\"\n\n23. We have perused the same. The import of such\n\n (36)\n\njudgments is that interim relief especially pertaining to\n\ntermination should not be granted in certain circumstances,\n\nsuch as, when no opinion is expressed about the propriety of\n\nthe ground of termination or where if such relief is granted,\n\nthe ultimate relief sought is automatically allowed without\n\npermitting the parties to place their respective cases at the\n\ntime of final hearing. The judgments also deal with the\n\nissues like grant of interim relief at admission stage, which is\n\navailable at disposal of the proceedings or grant of interim\n\nrelief against termination while in probation. However, we\n\nfind that the ratio of these judgments are not applicable in\n\nthe present case. Because at the time of granting interim\n\nrelief, prima facie, it was found that the claim of the\n\napplicants was getting sustenance from the judgments of this\n\nTribunal dated 05.03.2021, wherein the Tribunal had referred\n\nto and relied upon the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the \nState of Haryana & Others vs. Piara Singh\n as\n\nmentioned. Therefore, as an interim relief, the respondents\n\nwere directed not to terminate the services of the applicants\n\nto maintain status quo qua their services till the next date of\n\nhearing.\n\n23. In view of the above discussions, we do not see any\n\ndifference between the petitioners and those appointed as\n\n (37)\n\nafter notification as per the new RRs on contractual terms.\n\nWe also do not find force in the argument that the employees\n\nengaged against advertisement issued in the context or new\n\nRRs were regular contractual employee and thus they were\n\ndifferent from the petitioners. We find that in the instant case\n\nboth the petitioners and the persons engaged as per the new\n\nRRs were duly qualified persons and were appointed following\n\nthe due process of selection. It is not the case that the new\n\nRRs notified/incorporated some new posts with essential\n\nqualification which the petitioners did not possess. Therefore,\n\nwe find that the distinction drawn between the petitioners\n\nand the new appointees is artificial as in both cases,\n\nappointments have been made following the due selection\n\nprocess with prescribed minimum qualification.\n\n24. \nIn the case of \nPiara Singh\n (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt held as follows:\n\n \"45. The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment\n through the prescribed agency but exigencies of\n administration may sometimes call for an adhoc or\n temporary appointment to be made. In such a\n situation, effort should always be to replace such an\n adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected\n employee as early as possible. Such a temporary\n employee may also compete along with others for such\n regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well\n and good, but if he does not, he must give way to the\n regularly selected candidate. The appointment of the\n regularly selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept\n in abeyance for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary\n employee.\n\n (38)\n\n 46. Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should\n not be replaced by another adhoc or temporary\n employee; he must be replaced only by a regularly\n selected employee. This is necessary to avoid arbitrary\n action on the part of the appointing authority.\"\n\n25. Our considered view is that the instant case is covered\n\nby above notwithstanding the distinction made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents within the two sets of employees\n\nwho were both contractual.\n\n26. We also find that while the respondents notified the\n\nnew RRs in 2022 in doing so the rules notified in 1992\n\nwere not superseded. The Sports Authority of India\n\n(Sports Sciences & Sports Medicine) Staff Recruitment\n\nRules, 1992 in caption \"Initial Constitution 4 (a)\" provides\n\nthe following:\n\n \"(a) All the employees in SAI working on adhoc\n basis on any of the post mentioned in the schedule\n on the date these rules come into force shall, after\n the approval by a duly constituted Committee, shall\n be deemed to have been appointed under these\n rules with effect from a date as may be decided by\n the said Screening Committee in each individual\n case.\"\n\n27. Vide new Recruitment Rules 2022 under caption\n\n\"Initial Constitution\" the following provision was made:\n\n \"4. Initial Constitution:- All the employees in SAI\n working on any of the post mentioned in the\n Annexure-I on the date these rules come into force\n shall be deemed to have been appointed under these\n rules.\"\n\n (39)\n\nBut there is nothing to indicate that it superseded the\n\n\"Initial Constitution\" of 1992 rules and ironically both the\n\nrules have continued.\n\n28. Notwithstanding the above, the case remains that\n\nthe applicants possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n\nthey have been selected through a process of open\n\ncompetition, therefore, their appointment was not 'illegal'\n\nbut irregular and therefore they should be considered as\n\npart of the initial constitution as \nlaid down in\n 2022 rules.\n\nTherefore, the right invested in the employees working on\n\nadhoc basis remained intact. \nIn this regard, we also placed\n\nreliance on \nS.S. Moghe and Others vs. Union of India\n\nand Others\n (1981) 3 SCC 271, wherein it was held that\n\nwhen a new service is proposed to be constituted by the\n\nGovernment, it is fully within the competence of the\n\nGovernment to decide as a matter of policy the sources\n\nfrom which the personnel required for manning the Service\n\nare to be drawn.\n\n29. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the OA is\n\nallowed with direction to the competent authority amongst\n\nthe respondents to consider the applicants as 'Initial\n\nConstituent' as per 2022 (4) Rules notified on 03.08.2022\n\nand pass an appropriate reasoned order in this regard as\n\n (40)\n\nexpeditiously as possible and in any case within 8 weeks of\n\nthe receipt of a copy of this order and till service of such\n\norder(s), the applicants will not be terminated. Consequently\n\nthe termination orders dated 09.02.2023 and 10.02.2023 are\n\nquashed. No costs.\n\n(Sanjeeva Kumar) (R.N. Singh)\n Member (A) Member (J)\n\n/kdr/",
