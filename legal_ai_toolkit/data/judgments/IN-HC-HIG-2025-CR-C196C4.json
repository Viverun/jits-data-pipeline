The brief facts leading to the filing of this petition are that M/s\n\nCanara Bank lodged an information in writing before the first respondent,\n\nbased on which a First Information Report was registered in\n\nRC0322021A0009 dated 17.05.2021, for the alleged offences under Section\n\n120B read with 420\nIPC\nand\nsection 13 (2)\nread with 13 (1) (d) of the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988\n.\n\n2.1. The gist of the information is that M/s Air Carnival Private Limited,\n\nrepresented by its Directors S. Irud a y a n a t h a n (A1), the petitioner herein, and\n\nhis wife, Mrs. Lima Rose (A2), applied for a loan by offering to create an\n\nequitable mortgage of its immovable property measuring 3.75 acres along with\n\na building on S.F.Nos. 298/1 and 298/3 in Myleripalayam Village,\n\n2/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nMadukkarai Taluk, Coimbatore District. The Directors also acted as personal\n\nguarantors. Based on the application dated 04.06.2016, a term loan of Rs. 4.90\n\nCrores was granted along with a bank guarantee, a sum of Rs. 3.05 Crores on\n\n01.06.2016; an overdraft facility of Rs. 4.70 Crores on 27.10.2016; and a\n\ntemporary overdraft of Rs. 1.00 Crore on 31.03.2017, totaling Rs. 13.65\n\nCrores. The loan account was classified as 'Non-Performing Asset' (NPA) on\n\n29.06.2017 and was reported as a fraudulent account on 27.11.2019. The\n\ncompany and its Directors wilfully and dishonestly defrauded the Bank by\n\nconspiring to divert and siphon the loan amount, causing wrongful loss of Rs.\n\n13.65 Crores to the Bank and wrongful gain to themselves.\n\n2.2. After an investigation, the final report was submitted. The report\n\nstates that the 2 Director, M r s . Li m a Ros e, had no criminal intent or\nnd\n\nknowledge regarding the mentioned transaction, and therefore her name is\n\nomitted. It also states that there was no criminal intent or knowledge on the\n\npart of the public servants/bank officials concerning the transactions, and the\n\nprovisions of the offences under the\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988\n, were\n\ndropped. Furthermore, it explains that initially, while the petitioner,\n\nIrud a y a n a t h a n , operated his business as a proprietorship, he showed higher\n\ncontributions when he transitioned to a partnership, whereas the contributions\n\n3/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nof the other partners were minimal. Later, when the partnership was converted\n\ninto a company registered under the\nCompanies Act, 2013\n, the property\n\noffered as security remained in his personal name and was not transferred to\n\nthe company's name.\n\n2.3. Further, by availing the loans on the specified dates, the company\n\ndid not adhere to its original plan, and the primary sureties in the form of\n\ngoods that should have been created were not created. On the other hand, the\n\nloan proceeds were siphoned off to other accounts to create four Fixed\n\nDeposits, which were subsequently used as margin money for bank\n\nguarantees. Subsequently, several bank guarantees were obtained in favor of\n\nM/s Anjali Hotels Private Limited, M/s Airports Authority of India,\n\nCoimbatore, Air India Air Transport Services Limited, New Delhi, ATR\n\nEastern Support Private Limited, Singapore. Additionally, the loan amount\n\nwas diverted to other institutions such as M/s Coimbatore Marine College,\n\nMangalore Marine College, and Technology. However, the accused failed to\n\nrepay the principal and interest, leading to the accounts being classified as\n\nNPA. In the meantime, the company went into liquidation and is now\n\nrepresented by the Official Liquidator. The matter is currently pending before\n\nthe National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai. Therefore, finding that the\n\n4/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\noffence under\nSection 420\nof IPC is made out, the final report has been filed.\n\n2.4. It is stated that, in the meantime, by a communication dated\n\n12.01.2022, Canara Bank offered to accept a sum of Rupees 12 Crores as full\n\nand final settlement, on the condition that the amount be paid in installments\n\nwithin the specified timeline, with the final installment of Rupees 3 Crores to\n\nbe paid on or before 31.03.2022. In addition, the legal expenses and\n\nCIRP/liquidation expenses were also to be paid. It is explicitly mentioned in\n\nthe offer that the account will be considered closed only after all direct and\n\nindirect liabilities in the name of the firm/borrower/guarantors are settled. It is\n\nfurther stated that the One Time Settlement will not affect ongoing criminal\n\nproceedings initiated by the CBI/Police authorities. The One-Time Settlement\n\n(OTS) will be without prejudice to the rights of the CBI/Police to investigate\n\nor prosecute and shall not hinder the continuation or resolution of any pending\n\ncriminal proceedings, if any.\n\n2.5. The petitioner is said to have completely paid the loan amount of\n\nRs.12 Crores on 02.03.2022, and there are no dues whatsoever to the Bank,\n\nwith the civil liability amicably settled. However, due to the clause originally\n\n5/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\ncontained in the memorandum of understanding, the Bank is not coming\n\nforward to join in the filing of application for compounding under\nSection 320\n\nof Cr.P.C. Therefore, contending that the entire action does not constitute any\n\ncriminal offence and that the settlement of dues amicably should be\n\nconsidered, and the proceedings be quashed.\n\nC.Submissions of the learned counsel:\n\n3. Heard, M s . K a d a m b r i Sure s h , the learned counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the petitioner. Firstly she would submit that the amount was borrowed after\n\nfurnishing due security. There was never an intention to cheat the bank. It was\n\na failed venture and thus the account slipped into NPA. The petitioner had\n\nmade all earnest efforts and has settled the loan amount. Except for the brief\n\nperiod of default, there was no dishonest intention for the petitioner. The\n\nlearned counsel would rely upon various Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India, more specifically\nK.Bharthi Devi V. State of Telangana1\nand\n\nN.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police & Anr.2\nand would submit that\n\nthe proceedings are liable to be quashed.\n\n1 (2024) INSC 750\n2 (2025) SCCOnLine SC 1257\n\n6/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n3.1. Per contr a, Mr. K. Sriniv a s a n , the learned Special Public\n\nProsecutor, would submit that the legal position in this regard has not been\n\naltered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, and he would rely upon a set of\n\njudgments to argue that, in cases involving bank fraud, the Court should not\n\ninvoke jurisdiction under\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. based on a subsequent\n\nsettlement. In fact, when the money originally borrowed is sanctioned for\n\nspecific purposes such as purchasing tools, kits, and equipment, which serve\n\nas primary security for the loan, diverting funds for a different purpose and\n\nthen defaulting completes the offence of cheating.\n\n3.2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 2 nd\n\nrespondent/Canara Bank submitted that the entire dues of the Bank have been\n\nsettled, and the Bank has no serious objections in considering the petition for\n\nquashing. However, in view of the clause in the memorandum of One Time\n\nSettlement, there was no mandate for the Bank to file a compounding\n\napplication before the Trial Court.\n\nD.Consideration and Findings:\n\n4.

Thus, from the detailed analysis of numerous\ndecisions, it is evident that the law regarding the quashing of\ncriminal cases involving non-compoundable offences, where\nparties allege settlement, has been clearly laid down by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nGian Singh Vs. State of\nPunjab\n(cited supra). It is essential to refer to paragraph Nos. 58\nand 61 of that judgment:\n\n“58. Where the High Court quashes a\ncriminal proceeding having regard to the fact that the\ndispute between the offender and the victim has been\nsettled although the offences are not compoundable,\n\n19/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nit does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal\nproceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice\nin the case demands that the dispute between the\nparties is put to an end and peace is restored;\n\nsecuring the ends of justice being the ultimate\nguiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\nharmful effect on the public and consist in\nwrongdoing that seriously endangers and threatens\nthe well-being of the society and it is not safe to\nleave the crime-doer only because he and the victim\nhave settled the dispute amicably or that the victim\nhas been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have\nbeen made compoundable in law, with or without the\npermission of the court. In respect of serious offences\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or other offences of\nmental depravity under\nIPC\nor offences of moral\nturpitude under special statutes, like the\nPrevention\nof Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by\npublic servants while working in that capacity, the\nsettlement between the offender and the victim can\nhave no legal sanction at all. However, certain\noffences which overwhelmingly and predominantly\nbear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,\nmercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or\nsuch like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the\nfamily dispute, where the wrong is basically to the\nvictim and the offender and the victim have settled\nall disputes between them amicably, irrespective of\nthe fact that such offences have not been made\ncompoundable, the High Court may within the\nframework of its inherent power, quash the criminal\nproceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is\nsatisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is\nhardly any likelihood of the offender being convicted\nand by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice\nshall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.\nThe above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each\ncase will depend on its own facts and no hard-and-\nfast category can be prescribed.\n\n......\n\n......\n\n61. The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus : the power of the\n\n20/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR\nor complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given to a\ncriminal court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide\nplenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\nexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in\nsuch power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice, or\n\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In\nwhat cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\ncomplaint or FIR may be exercised where the\noffender and the victim have settled their dispute\nwould depend on the facts and circumstances of each\ncase and no category can be prescribed. However,\nbefore exercise of such power, the High Court must\nhave due regard to the nature and gravity of the\ncrime. Heinous and serious offences of mental\ndepravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\nvictim's family and the offender have settled the\ndispute. Such offences are not private in nature and\nhave a serious impact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and the offender in\nrelation to the offences under special statutes like the\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences\ncommitted by public servants while working in that\ncapacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for\nquashing criminal proceedings involving such\noffences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour\nstand on a different footing for the purposes of\nquashing, particularly the offences arising from\ncommercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\nor such like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family\ndisputes where the wrong is basically private or\npersonal in nature and the parties have resolved their\nentire dispute. In this category of cases, the High\nCourt may quash the criminal proceedings if in its\nview, because of the compromise between the\noffender and the victim, the possibility of conviction\nis remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal\ncase would put the accused to great oppression and\nprejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\nhim by not quashing the criminal case despite full\n\n21/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nand complete settlement and compromise with the\nvictim. In other words, the High Court must consider\nwhether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest\nof justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or\ncontinuation of the criminal proceeding would\ntantamount to abuse of process of law despite\nsettlement and compromise between the victim and\nthe wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of\njustice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put\nto an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is\nin the affirmative, the High Court shall be well\nwithin its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\nproceeding.”\n\n31. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the\nHigh Court will be well within its jurisdiction to quash the\nproceedings on compromise, if the offence is predominantly\ncivil in nature, private in nature, completely settled between\nthe parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the\nproceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would\nbe oppressive on the accused to be continued, even after\nsettlement. The power is to be exercised with a great amount\nof prudence and responsibility, to secure the ends of justice.\n\n32. However, the question regarding the instances of\nvarious frauds committed by parties concerning banking\ntransactions, obtaining loans, and defaulting on and\nsubsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with\nthe bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the cases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were\nquashed, while in others, they were not. But a proper and\ncombined reading of all the judgments cited above related to\nthis subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion\nreached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the\nparticular offence, such as 468, 471 of\nIPC\n, or offences under\nSection 120 B read with 420 of\nIPC\nwhich is paramount.\nInstead, it is the nature of the allegations that the Court must\nexamine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each\ncase, one has to determine whether the case involves a purely\ncommercial or private transaction between the bank and the\nborrower, or if it has broader implications affecting society or\nthe financial system as a whole.\n\n33. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances\n\n22/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nmust be examined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the\ncase is primarily commercial or civil in nature and that the\ncriminal aspects are not of utmost depravity and seriousness,\nwhich could have a likely impact on society as a whole or the\ncountry's financial system. The second step involves assessing\nwhether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank\nhas any remaining claims. If the case has reached a complete\nand final settlement and the bank has no pending claims, then\nthe Court moves to the third step to evaluate whether\ncontinuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed in\nprosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider\nwhether continuing the proceedings would be unfair,\noppressive, or constitute an abuse of the legal process,\nconsidering the nature of the settlement or compromise, the\ncircumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the\naccused, the time elapsed, and the stage at which quashing is\nrequested. In the interest of justice, the Court may, in fit cases,\ndecide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate cases, costs\ncan also be imposed.”\n\n4.1. Based on the above, examining the facts of the present case, it is\n\nclear that the only offense alleged is under\nSection 420\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode. Although the Bank has no serious objection, it has not explicitly agreed\n\nto join the petitioner in filing an application for compounding before the\n\nappropriate forum.\n\n4.2. The main allegation against the petitioner is that, immediately after\n\nreceiving the loan, the funds were diverted from the original purposes stated in\n\nthe loan application, such as purchasing tools and equipment. The entire loan\n\namount was initially used to create Fixed Deposits and was later reallocated\n\n23/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nfor other purposes, including providing margin money for bank guarantees and\n\ntransferring funds to other institutions related to the petitioner, including those\n\nassociated with the marine college business. Therefore, the core allegation is\n\nthat the petitioner acted dishonestly by misrepresenting the purpose for which\n\nthe loan was obtained. Although the funds were meant for his other business\n\nventures, a different purpose was declared in the loan application.\n\n4.3. When the loan amount was disbursed in April 2016, July 2016,\n\nOctober 2016, and the final transfer of Rs. 1 Crore was sanctioned in March\n\n2017, it is evident that in the very next quarter, on 29.06.2017, the account\n\nwas classified as NPA. The original loan was obtained from the erstwhile\n\nSyndicate Bank, which later merged with Canara Bank. The statement of\n\nL.W.7 – Shri Ar u n Ras a p p a n , regarding the pending disbursement and\n\nutilization of the bank accounts, reads as follows:-\n\n“On being asked how many Bank Loan accounts have opened in\nthe name of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited, I state that after\nsanction of various credit facilities to M/s Air Carnival Private\nLimited, I have conveyed the sanction details to company and\nafter execution of loan documents, loan accounts have opened\nin the name of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited viz.

I further state\nthat the said TOD of Rs 1.00 crores also slipped to NPA along\nwith other Credit facilities.\n\nOn being asked how the Term Loan of Rs 4.90 crores was\ndisbursed to M/s Air Carnival Private Limited, I state that Shri\nS. Irudayanathan CMD of M/s Air Carnival Private limited\nrequested to release the loan amount. I state that our Ganapathy\nBranch had released the amount of Rs 4.90 crores to Current\naccount of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited. I state that Shri S.\nIrudyanathan submitted the request letter dated 07.06.2016\nsigned by him, addressed to The Branch Manager, Syndicate\nBank, Ganapathy Branch, along with details of bills and\ninvoices. I have identified his signatures on the request letter of\nthe company. I further state that Shri S.Irudayanthan requested\nin the said letter that he had already made payments to various\nvendors of Rs 6.80 crores including margin money of the\ncompany. I further state that Shri S.Irudayanathan further\nrequested in the latter that Rs 22,99,371/- was pending for\nmaking payment to other vendors and requested the Branch to\nmake payments through RTGS/NEFT, for the purpose of\nmaking payments, Shri S.Irudayanathan enclosed details of\nsuppliers/ vendors along with the request letter.

I further\nstate that Shri S.Irudayanathan Chairman and Managing\nDirector of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited informed during\nthe relevant period that he made payments to various vendors\n/suppliers for supply of goods and services.

One Par i p o o r a n a m , Senior Manager, who in his statement as\n\nL.W.15 states as follows with reference to obtaining of lease of Aircrafts:\n\n“On being asked how many Air Crafts were taken on lease by\nM/s Air Carnival Private Limited during sanction of credit\nfacilities, I state that these credit facilities were sanctioned for\none Air Craft only, however, the company promised to take\nanother Air Craft on lease basis by end of December 2016,\nhowever, it did not happen, the reason of the same was not\nknown to me. On being asked I state that during sanction of\ncredit facilities to M/s Air Canival Private limited, it was\n\n26/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\ndiscussed in the committee of RLCAC-I that the project is\nviable only if two Air Crafts would be taken on lease and\ncommercial operations should b done with two Air Crafts.”\n\n4.5. There is also an additional allegation that when the balance sheet of\n\nthe original concern, viz., M/s Jet Carnival, showed a net worth of Rs.5.37\n\nCrores, there was a sudden increase of Rs.11.85 Crores in just one month and\n\nseven days, to reflect a higher valuation of Rs.11.85 Crores for the purpose of\n\nportraying increased capital as if infused by the firm. A further reading of the\n\nFIR shows that the company attempted to artificially boost its net worth to\n\nbecome eligible for a larger loan amount, and later failed to follow the original\n\nbusiness plan by using the loan proceeds for purposes other than those\n\nspecified. However, from the testimonies of the various listed witnesses, it\n\nappears that these actions were not done without the knowledge of the relevant\n\nofficials. One of the witnesses, viz., Anb u m a n i , was even penalized with a\n\nminor penalty of a one-stage reduction in the pay scale for six months, without\n\ncumulative effect, which did not adversely affect his pension.\n\n4.6. A review of the loan sanction letters shows that the first sanction\n\nletter, issued for a term loan of Rs.4.7 Crores, states the purpose is to cover\n\nworking capital needs. The second sanction letter, dated 04.06.2016, mentions\n\n27/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nthat the loan was approved for purchasing tools and equipment, setting up a\n\ncorporate office, acquiring computers, printers, furniture, and carrying out\n\ninterior work on leased premises. Furthermore, 30% of the approved amount\n\nhad to be deposited as margin money.\n\n4.7. Firstly, it can be seen that the allegation is the diversion of funds\n\nfor a different purpose, which would be a fraud within the meaning of the\n\ncircular of the Reserve Bank of India. However, per se, it would not amount to\n\nan offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC. The transactions become an offence\n\nonce there is a default. Therefore, only if the petitioner does not pay the\n\namount due with respect to the specific installments, can it be said that the\n\ningredients of the offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC, i.e., causing loss to the\n\nbank, are established.\n\n4.8. Although the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\nentire loan amount was secured, once the purpose of the loan is dishonestly\n\nmisrepresented and the amount remains unpaid on the stipulated dates, a prima\n\nfacie offence under\nSection 420\nof the IPC is established. Furthermore, the\n\nfactors pleaded by the petitioner would need consideration if a determination\n\nis to be made regarding the absence of any intent to cheat the bank. Therefore,\n\n28/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nat this stage, it cannot be said that no offence under\nSection 420\nof the IPC is\n\nmade out.\n\n4.9. On the other hand, as late as March 2017, the last transaction of\n\nRs.1 Crore of overdraft facility was sanctioned, and immediately thereafter, in\n\nJune 2017, the account was classified as NPA and taken into account.\n\nAlthough the OTS proposal by the bank states that the settlement is not for the\n\nongoing criminal case, it is important to note that the standard clause is\n\nincluded in all cases, as the bank cannot withdraw or compound because non-\n\ncompoundable offences are typically involved. Even in this case, offences\n\nunder Section 120(B) and also the offence under\nSection 13(2)\nread with\n\n13(1)(d) were initially alleged against the bank officials, but these charges\n\nwere later dropped, leaving only the offence under\nSection 420\nIPC against the\n\npetitioner.\n\n4.10. Therefore, after careful consideration and review of the facts, the\n\nposition tilts in favor of the petitioner, indicating that the entire episode is\n\nprimarily commercial or civil in nature and does not impact society at large.\n\nThe civil dispute between the petitioner and the Bank has been amicably\n\n29/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\nresolved, with the bank explicitly stating that no amount is due. Based on the\n\nfinal report and collected materials, although there is evidence of siphoning\n\nfunds, the question of whether the intent to cheat the bank was present from\n\nthe outset would be difficult for the prosecution to prove to secure a\n\nconviction, especially if proper security was provided. More importantly, the\n\ndiversion of funds initially was not to any external element but to the fixed\n\ndeposit accounts with the bank itself. The period during which the loan was\n\nsanctioned, the fact that the petitioner’s venture quickly failed resulting in the\n\nentire loan being classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), and the\n\nsettlement reached on 02.03.2022 all suggest there was no deliberate delay or\n\nmala fide intent by the petitioner to prolong the matter. Rather, the petitioner\n\nsincerely attempted to settle the dispute amicably and swiftly with the bank.\n\nTherefore, considering the full efforts toward settlement and compromise,\n\ncontinuing the prosecution may be deemed oppressive and unjust to the\n\npetitioner. Moreover, as per the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,\n\nthe entire basis of the complaint leading to the prosecution is solely due to the\n\npetitioner’s default in amounts and causing the account to become an NPA.\n\nThus, the costs for prosecution and court fees should be imposed as per the\n\nruling in\nKothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI3\n.\n\n3 (2022) SCC Online SC 2078\n\n30/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\nCrl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n4.11. The total loan amount in this case is Rs.13.65 Crores, and I am of\n\nthe view that a cost of Rs.8 Lakhs should be imposed on the petitioner. Of this\n\na sum of Rs.4 Lakhs should be paid to the 1st respondent / Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation towards prosecution expenses, and another Rs.4 Lakhs should be\n\ndeposited to the credit of the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre,\n\nHigh Court of Madras, Chennai – 104.
