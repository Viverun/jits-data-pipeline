Record shows that in respect of an incident dated 21.12.2021, a delayed FIR dated 22.12.2021 was lodged by first informant/opposite party-2 Neha Pandey and was registered as Case Crime No. 0269 of 2021, under\nSections 354-B\n,\n,\n,\nand\nIPC, Police Station-Sindhaura, District-Varanasi (Rural).

During the pendency of aforementioned criminal case, parties amicably settled their dispute outside the Court. On the basis of settlement so arrived at by the parties, a compromise was entered into by the parties. The terms of the compromise were subsequently, reduced to writing by way of a compromise deed dated 21.02.2024. The original copy of the same is on record at page 54 of the paper book.\n\n17. On the basis of above, applicants, who are charge sheeted accused, have approached this Court seeking quashing of the entire proceedings of aforementioned criminal case in view of the compromise entered into by the parties.\n\n18. Present application came up for admission on 20.03.2024 and this Court passed the following order:-\n\n\"Learned counsel for the applicants and learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 are present.\n\nLearned counsel for the opposite party no.2 has filed his Vakalatnama today, let it be kept on record.\n\nThe parties are said to have arrived at a compromise. The compromise deed is appended at page 53 of the paper book. As sections involved are found to be compoundable/compoundable with the permission of the Court, hence the parties are directed to appear before the trial court within 15 days from today along with their compromise deed. If the parties appear before the trial court within the time stipulated along with the compromise deed, the trial court shall passed an appropriate order thereon and transmit a certified copy of the verified compromise deed along with the certified copy of the order passed thereon to this Court within 15 days thereafter.\n\nList on 23.04.2024.\n\nTill the next date of listing, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants.\"\n\n19. Subsequent to above order dated 20.03.2024, parties appeared before Court below for verification of the compromise so entered into by them.\n\n20. Court below, vide order dated 15.07.2024, has verified the compromise entered into by the parties.\n\n21. Furthermore, Court below, vide letter dated 16.07.2024, has sent the photo copy of the application dated 29.05.2024 jointly submitted by the parties praying therein that that the proceedings of aforementioned criminal case be terminated in view of the compromise entered into by the parties and the order dated 15.07.2024, whereby the compromise entered into by the parties was verified.\n\n22. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicants in both the applications submit that the dispute between the parties is a purely private dispute and not against state. During pendency of criminal proceedings\n,\nreferred to above\n, parties have amicably settled their dispute outside the Court. On the basis of settlement, arrived at between the parties, compromise deed was filed before Court below, which has been verified by Court below. As such, the compromise entered into by the parties has been acted upon. It is then contended by the respective learned counsel for applicants that since the parties have entered into a compromise, the chances of conviction of applicants, who are charge sheeted accused, are not only remote but also bleak. On the above conspectus, the respective learned counsel for applicants thus submit that no useful purpose shall be served in prolonging the criminal prosecution of applicants. They, therefore, contend that present applications are liable to be allowed.\n\n23. Per contra, the learned Learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 and the respective counsels for the first informant in both the applications submit that they have no objection to the prayer made by the learned counsel for applicants. They submit that once the first informant-opposite party-2 in both the applications has herself entered into a compromise with accused-applicants, which compromise has also been acted upon and verified by Court below, therefore, they cannot have any grievance, in case, present applications are allowed by this Court in terms of the compromise so entered into by the parties.\n\n24.

Hafsal Rahman N.R., Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Diary Nos. 24362 of 2021.\n\nwherein the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. However, Apex Court in\nState of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra\n) held that no compromise can be made in respect of offences against society as they are not private in nature.\nSimilarly in Ram Pal Vs. State of Haryana (Supra) it has been held that no compromise can be made in cases relating to rape and sexual assault.\nRecently, the Apex Court in\nDaxaben\n(supra) has held that no compromise can be made in matter under\nSection 306\nIPC.\n\nIn state of\nKerala Vs. Hafsal Rahman (Supra\n), Court has held that no compromise can be entertained in matters under the POCSO Acts.\n\nReference may also be made to the decision given by this Court in\nShaifullah and others Vs. State of U.P. And another\n[2013 (83) ACC 278] in which the law expounded by the Apex court in some of the aforesaid cases has been explained in detail.\n\nRecently Apex court in\nParbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur\n(Supra) has laid down the following guidelines with regard to quashing of criminal proceedings as well compromise in criminal proceedings in paragraphs 16 to 16.10 of the report, which read as under:\n\n\"16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be summarized in the following propositions\n\n16.1.\nSection 482\npreserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;\n\n16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of\nSection 320\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under\nSection 482\nis attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable.\n\n16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under\nSection 482\n, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;\n\n16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court;\n\n16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated;\n\n16.6. In the exercise of the power under\nSection 482\nand while dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences;\n\n16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;\n\n16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;\n\n16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and\n\n16.10. There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions 16.8 and 16.9 above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the balance.\"\n\nRecently in\nRamgopal and another\n(supra), Court has again reiterated the guidelines regarding quashing of criminal proceedings in view of compromise. Following has been observed in paragraph 18-19:-\n\n\"18. It is now a well crystalized axiom that plenary jurisdiction of this Court to impart complete justice under\nArticle 142\ncannot ipso facto be limited or restricted by ordinary statutory provisions. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of an express provision akin to\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. conferring powers on the Supreme Court to abrogate and set aside criminal proceedings, the jurisdiction exercisable under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers to quash criminal proceedings also, so as to secure complete justice. In doing so, due regard must be given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the criminal justice system, which is grounded on the sub-lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the collective and that the rationale of placing an individual behind bars is aimed at his reformation.\n\n19. We thus sum-up and hold that as opposed to\nSection 320\nCr.P.C. where the Court is squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences 'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra-ordinary power enjoined upon a High Court under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C. or vested in this Court under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of\nSection 320\nCr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be exercise carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between accused and the victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant considerations.\"\n\n25.\nIn\nState of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra\n), the Apex Court held that mere mention of\nSection 307\nIPC cannot be sole basis for not quashing the proceedings. Court has to examine whether the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence for framing of charge under\nSection 307\nIPC. The Court has further required to examine the weapons used and nature of injury and whether injury has been inflicted on vital/delicate parts of the body, the previous antecedents of accused and whether they are absconding and how the compromise was got entered into by the parties are relevant factors, which must be considered. The above observations can be clearly delineated from the recital occurring in paragraphs 11 to 18 of the aforementioned report.\n\n26. Having heard the counsel for the parties in both the applications, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1, upon perusal of record and in view of the facts and circumstances of the case as noted herein above and the observations made by the Apex Court as aforemenitoned, this Court finds that there does not exist any legal impediment in accepting the compromise entered into by the parties. In view of the compromise entered into by the parties, the chances of conviction of accused-applicants is remote and bleak. As such, continuation of proceedings would itself cause injustice to the parties. The trial would only entail loss of judicial time in a futile pursuit particularly when torrents of litigation drown the Courts with an unimaginable flood of dockets.\n\n27. In view of the discussion made above, the present applications succeed and are liable to be allowed.\n\n28. They are, accordingly, allowed.\n\n29. The entire proceedings of aforementioned criminal cases i.e. Consequential Case No. .... of 2022 (\nState Vs. Rajendra Pandey and Others\n) arising out of Case Crime No. 08 of 2022, under\nSections 323\n,\nand\nIPC, Police Station-Sindhaura, District-Varanasi now pending in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-VII/F.T.C.\nJ.D.-II, Varanasi and Consequential\nCase No. 218186 of 2022 (\nState Vs.
