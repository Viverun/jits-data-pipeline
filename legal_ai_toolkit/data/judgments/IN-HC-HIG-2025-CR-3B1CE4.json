The State filed these petitions seeking to quash the impugned orders\n\ndated 06.09.2025 passed by the learned Special Judge for SPE and ACB Cases\n\n- cum - III Additional District Judge, Vijayawada1 in Crl.M.P.Nos.,1446, 1447\n\nand 1467 of 2025 emanating out of Crime No.21 of 2024 of CID Police Station,\n\nMangalagiri, whereby the Respondents/ Accused Nos.,31 to 33 were enlarged\n\non default bail under Section 187(3)(ii) of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita,\n\n20232 and to quash and set aside the Official Memorandums dated 23.08.2025\n\ntherein.\n\n2. As the issues raised in these Petitions are common and challenge is to\n\nanalogous impugned orders, they were heard together and are now disposed of,\n\nby this common order. The challenge in these petitions, unfold a series of legal\n\nquestions concerning the scope and interpretation of BNSS provisions, in\n\nrelation to default bail and completeness of a police report.\n\nFactual Background of the Crime:\n\n3. The instant crime arises out of allegations concerning large-scale\n\nirregularities in the implementation of the excise policy and functioning of the\n\nAndhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited3 during 2019 to 2024.\n\nThe matter came to light upon a representation made to the Principal Secretary\n\nto the Government of Andhra Pradesh, on 26.08.2024 by one Venkateswara\n\n1 For short, the learned Special Judge\n2 For short, BNSS\n3 For short, APSBCL\nRao Srinivas, alleging irregularities in the excise policy from 2019 to 2024. The\n\nreport highlighted issues such as unfair discrimination in the allocation of\n\nOrders for Supply (OFS) of liquor, leading to the suppression of established\n\nbrands and preferential treatment for new brands, in violation of existing\n\nnorms. It also raised concerns about the shift from an automated to a manual\n\nOFS system, which could allow for manipulations. After an enquiry, Principal\n\nSecretary referred the complaint to CID Police, Mangalagiri, which registered a\n\ncase in Crime No.21 of 2024 against unknown persons on 23.09.2024, alleging\n\noffences under\nSections 409\n,\n, and\n120-B\nof the Indian Penal Code, 18604.\n\nOn 05.02.2025, the Government constituted a Special Investigation Team5,\n\nvide G.O.Rt.No.262 to investigate the alleged irregularities in the excise policy\n\nand related crimes. Following this, on 05.05.2025, Accused Nos. 31 to 33 were\n\nformally arraigned as accused in the ongoing investigation into the case.\n\n4. Accused No. 31, the former Secretary to the Chief Minister, is alleged to\n\nhave played a key role in suppressing popular liquor brands as part of a\n\nsyndicate involving high-ranking officers, political authorities, and close\n\nassociates of Accused No. 1. Accused No. 32, a retired Special Deputy Collector,\n\nworked as Office on Special Duty in the Chief Minister's Office during the\n\nrelevant period. Accused No. 33 is alleged of being involved in a kickback\n\nscheme, collecting ill-gotten money as part of the conspiracy.\n\n4 For short '\nIPC\n'\n5 For short, 'SIT'\nBackground for filing these Petitions:\n\n5. Succinctly put, the Respondents/Accused Nos., 31,32 and 33 were\n\narrested and remanded to judicial custody, which was periodically extended\n\nfrom time to time. The Investigating Agency filed charge sheets dated\n\n19.07.2025 and 11.08.2025 within the statutory period of 90 days. The learned\n\nSpecial Judge treated the charge sheets as incomplete, and enlarged the\n\nAccused Nos., 31, 32 and 33 on default bail, vide impugned orders dated\n\n06.09.2025. Aggrieved thereby, the State preferred these Petitions.\n\nSubstance of the Pleadings before this Court:\n\nFor a proper appreciation of the matter, the brief contents of the pleadings are\n\nsegregated as under;\n\n6. Version of the Petitioner/State:\n\na. Preliminary report dated 19.07.2025 and supplementary report dated\n\n11.08.2025 along with material documents and statements recorded during\n\ninvestigation are filed by the Investigating Agency within the statutory period.\n\nAccused Nos.,31 to 33 were remanded to judicial custody, the same was\n\nextended from time to time till 09.09.2025. In such a case, the Court cannot\n\nreview its order of remand and grant default bail, even after filing of preliminary\n\nand final reports holding them to be incomplete. When a valid report under\n\nSection 193(3)\nof BNSS is filed before the Court, the right of the Accused for\n\ndefault bail automatically extinguishes irrespective of taking cognizance.\n\nb. Non filing of sanction order and FSL reports can never be a ground for\n\ngranting default bail as they are not falling under the category of the compliance\n\nunder\nSection 193 (6)\nof BNSS [corresponding to\nSection 173 (5)\nof Cr.P.C.].\nc. The finding of the learned trial Judge that the charge sheet was\n\n'piecemeal' or 'incomplete' to beat the statutory time frame is erroneous;\n\nlabeling a report as 'supplementary' does not change its legal validity, if it fulfills\n\nSection 193(3)\nof BNSS and is supported by voluminous material that was\n\nplaced on record.\n\nd. Non-filing of additional copies of the charge sheet for supply to the\n\nAccused does not render it incomplete.\n\ne. The material placed on record had reflected completeness under\nSections\n\n193(3)\nand\n193(6)\nof BNSS and default bail under\nSection 187(3)\nof BNSS is an\n\nexception triggered, only where no report is filed on time. When the main report\n\nunder\nSection 193(3)\nof BNSS contains the prescribed particulars, annexural\n\ngaps, which are curable, do not revive default bail. Statutory compliance is\n\nachieved when the report includes all required details and accompanies\n\ndocuments and witness statements under\nSection 172\nCr.P.C.\n\nf. Police remand period under\nSection 167\nCr.P.C. (15 days) has been\n\nextended to 40/60 days under\nSection 187\nBNSS.\n\ng. Under\nSection 193(9)\nBNSS, no Court permission is required for further\n\ninvestigation.\n\nh. The objections taken by the learned trial Judge in the Official\n\nMemorandum dated 23.08.2025, are untenable, contrary to law and the same\n\ncannot be a ground to grant default bail to the Accused.\n\n7. Version of the Respondent / Accused No.31\n\na. Accused No.31 is entitled to statutory bail under\nSection 187 (3) (ii)\nof\n\nBNSS (corresponding to\nSection 167 (2)\nCr.P.C.) as the Prosecution did not\nchoose to file a valid final report, within the statutory period. The claim made\n\nby the Investigating Agency in the supplementary report would itself indicate\n\nthat the investigation is incomplete, triggering the right of the Accused to seek\n\ndefault bail.\n\nb. The objections raised by the learned trial Judge with regard to the non-\n\ncompliance of the statutory requirements confirm that the final report is\n\nincomplete and is filed without completing the investigation within the\n\nstatutory period only to defeat the indefeasible right of Accused No.31 to seek\n\nstatutory bail conferred under\nSection 187(3)\nof BNSS.\n\nc. Non-compliance of the requirement of the valid charge sheet in terms of\n\nSection 193\nof BNS would renders the charge sheet incomplete as the\n\ninvestigation is incomplete.\n\nd. The trial Judge's decision to grant statutory bail to the Accused No.31\n\naligns with legal principles. The report filed by the Investigating Agency lacks\n\nthe essentials of\nSection 193\nof BNSS and it does not fit into the sphere of valid\n\nreport and cannot substantiate the claim of a completed investigation.\n\ne. The deficiencies pointed out by the learned trial Judge in the form of\n\noffice objections cannot be construed as minor technical lapses and annexural\n\ngaps, since the issue concerns the status of the investigation and its\n\ncompleteness in culminating into filing of valid charge sheet.\n\nf. The extraordinary jurisdiction of the Court under Section 528 of BNSS is\n\navailable only in cases of gross miscarriage or perversity, which are absent here.\n\nThis petition, which is a disguised version of appeal for overturning the\n\nstatutory bail is not maintainable.\ng. Mere filing of a charge sheet, even if voluminous, does not equate\n\ncompletion of investigation. Incomplete or piecemeal charge sheets submitted\n\nto delay default bail are impermissible.\n\nh. The absence of a detailed tabular form for the siphoned amount, as\n\nmentioned in the Official Memorandum, demonstrates that the Police had not\n\nfully traced the proceeds of the crime. The fact that substantial amounts\n\nsiphoned remain untraced and unrecovered supports the conclusion that the\n\ninvestigation is pending and the statutory bail has not been granted on this\n\nground alone.\n\ni. The learned trial Judge has rightly observed the difference between the\n\nlegal requirements under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 20026 and\n\nprosecution under\nIPC\n/\nThe Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988\n.7\n\nj. The power to conduct \"further investigation\" under Section 193(9) of\n\nBNSS (173(8)\nCr.P.C\n) is meant for collecting additional evidence after\n\ncompletion of the investigation and filing of a charge sheet. It cannot justify an\n\ninitially incomplete investigation. The Court's remand powers under\nSection\n\n309(2)\nCr.P.C. apply only after cognizance; if the charge sheet is incomplete, the\n\ncase remains pre-cognizance.\n\n8. Version of Respondent / Accused No.32:\n\na. On 19.07.2025, the very date on which Accused Nos. 41 to 48 were added\n\nto the present case, the preliminary charge sheet was filed against sixteen\n\nAccused. Subsequently, a supplementary charge sheet was filed against Accused\n\n6 For short 'PMLA'\n7 For short '\nPC Act\n'\nNos.,31 to 33, which also listed the same sixteen Accused. The learned trial Judge\n\nrightly concluded that even this supplementary charge sheet was defective and\n\ncould not be treated as final.\n\nb. The charge sheets have been filed solely to defeat the constitutional rights\n\nof Accused No. 32. Even after the supplementary charge sheet, remand of\n\nAccused No. 32 was repeatedly obtained, solely on the pretext that the\n\ninvestigation remained incomplete.\n\nc. The State sought and obtained custody extensions strictly under\nSection\nCr.P.C., applicable only during investigation prior to its completion. Had the\n\ninvestigation been truly complete, recourse would have been under\nSection 309\n\nCr.P.C., governing custody after cognizance or commencement of trial. The\n\nState's failure to invoke\nSection 309\nCr.P.C. confirms that the investigation was\n\nfar from complete.\n\nd. The present petition seeking quashment of the order dated 23.08.2025 is\n\nnot maintainable, as the order relates only to the administrative side of the\n\nlearned trial Judge. Section 528 of BNSS applies solely to judicial orders, not to\n\nadministrative actions such as marking defects in a charge sheet.\n\ne. In the absence of proper investigation on material aspects, neither charge\n\nsheet complies with Section 193(5) of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 173(3)\nof\n\nCr.P.C.). Both are also defective because, out of 48 nominated Accused, the first\n\ncharge sheet was filed against only 16, and the second against only three. Critical\n\ndocuments, including the FSL report and sanction to prosecute under\nSections\n\n17-A\nor 19 of the\nPC Act\n, remain unproduced.\nf. The Investigating Agency cannot, under the pretext of further\n\ninvestigation, file charge sheets in a staggered manner. This undermines the right\n\nto default bail under\nSection 167(2)\nCr.P.C., which hinges on the completion of\n\ninvestigation within the prescribed period, unlike\nSection 190\nCr.P.C.\n\ng. Filing preliminary and supplementary charge sheets in this manner\n\nconstitutes a fraud on power, designed to defeat the statutory right under\nSection\nCr.P.C. for extraneous reasons.\n\nh. Formal permission of the Court is required to be obtained by the Police\n\nbefore conducting further investigation. Once the police report is filed, it should\n\nbe capable of examination for the purpose of judicial determination to take\n\ncognizance of the offence and to proceed further into Chapter XVI\nCr.P.C\n. and\n\nany act short of that, cannot be construed as 'taking cognizance'.\n\ni. Accused No. 32, aged approximately 67, suffers from serious respiratory\n\nailments, including bronchiectasis, fibro-atelectatic changes, emphysematous\n\nchanges with large subpleural bullae, and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nHe has been medically advised to avoid environmental triggers to prevent\n\naggravation of his condition. Any delay in providing such safeguards could result\n\nin pneumonia, severe hypoxia, or respiratory failure, causing irreversible\n\ndamage.\n\nj. As many as five preliminary reports were filed, nominating new Accused\n\nand adding fresh offences. There was no justification to arraign Accused No. 32\n\nin the supplementary final report, as the same material was already available in\n\nthe first charge sheet. A charge sheet returned for defects cannot be considered\n\nvalid in law.\n9. Version of Respondent /Accused No.33:\n\na. This petition itself is not maintainable since it seeks to challenge an\n\nadministrative order.\n\nb. It is the case of the Prosecuting Agency that the investigation was\n\nincomplete on the date of filing of the first charge sheet. As many as five\n\npreliminary reports were filed nominating new Accused persons and\n\nincorporating fresh offences. The supplementary final report dated 11.08.2025\n\nwas filed only after acknowledging that the investigation was incomplete.\n\nc. The main charge sheet does not satisfy the conditions of\nSection 173 (2)\n\nCr.P.C. as it consists of only 16 Accused persons and the investigation on the\n\nmaterial offences had not been undertaken.\n\nd. The learned trial Judge did not find the investigation to be incomplete\n\nmerely because documents were not annexed to the charge sheet; rather, it was\n\nheld that the investigation itself was wholly defective in material particulars.\n\ne. The formal filing of a charge sheet under Section 193(3) of BNSS is not\n\ndeterminative. It is settled law that repeated filing of preliminary reports to\n\ncircumvent statutory bail rights cannot be countenanced.\n\nf. The need for further investigation arises only upon the discovery of fresh\n\nmaterial. There was no justification for arraigning Accused No. 33 in the\n\nsupplementary final report, as the same material was already available in the\n\nfirst charge sheet.\n\ng. The Petitioner cannot challenge an administrative act using standards\n\napplicable to judicial functions. A charge sheet returned for defects cannot be\n\nregarded as valid in law.\nh.\nSection 309\nof Cr.P.C. is applicable to a stage after cognizance is taken.\n\nThe learned trial Judge has only declared that it is not open to the Prosecuting\n\nAgency to extend the custody of an Accused on the basis of an incomplete charge\n\nsheet.\n\ni. Filing of piecemeal and incomplete charge sheets cannot be considered\n\nas final report. Where the investigation is admittedly incomplete and\n\ncognizance has not been taken due to substantial defects, any so-called filing of\n\ncharge sheets cannot be relied upon to defeat the accrued right to default bail.\n\nj. Accused No. 33 was not included in the initial charge sheet, and no leave\n\nof the Special Court for further investigation was obtained. The subsequent\n\nfiling without such permission cannot justify curtailing the liberty of default\n\nbail.\n\nk. An investigation cannot be artificially splintered to allow filing of\n\nstaggered reports before a Court of competent jurisdiction. Both BNSS and\n\nCr.P.C\n. mandate completion of investigation, not the mere filing of a charge\n\nsheet.\n\nl. Investigation cannot be split to file piecemeal reports before the Court.\n\nSection 173\nCr.P.C. does not contemplate partial investigations or filing\n\nincomplete charge sheets. It requires that a charge or final report be filed only\n\nafter completion of the entire investigation, formation of an opinion regarding\n\nall alleged offences, and in cases involving multiple offences, after the\n\ninvestigation into all offences is complete.\nArguments advanced at the Bar:\n\n10.

Mithileswara Reddy and Sri K.Mokshitha\n\nRamakrishna, learned counsel for Respondent/Accused No.31 in Crl.P.No.\n\n9365 of 2025.\n\nOn behalf of Petitioner/State:\n\n11. Sri Sidharth Luthra, learned Senior Counsel representing the State\n\nin elaboration to the contentions raised in the Petitions would submit that the\n\nimpugned orders of the learned Special Judge enlarging the Respondents\n\n(Accused Nos.,31, 32 and 33) on default bail under Section 187 (3) (ii) of BNSS\n\non the ground that the Investigating Agency allegedly filed incomplete charge\n\nsheets in connection with Crime No.21 of 2024 are perverse, unjustified and\n\ncontrary to the settled principles of criminal law.\n\n12. Learned Senior Counsel urged that the investigating agency filed\n\ncharge sheets against the Accused named therein, which are complete and in\ncompliance of Section 193 (3) of BNSS and the Andhra Pradesh Police Manual.\n\nHe further pointed out that the titles of the charge sheets dated 19.07.2025 and\n\n11.08.2025 clearly state \"Final Report,\" thereby dispelling any doubt regarding\n\nthe nature of the police report. According to the learned Senior Counsel, upon\n\nverification of the charge sheets, the learned Special Judge issued two official\n\nmemoranda dated 23.08.2025 to the Investigating Officer, pointing out twenty-\n\none omissions or defects, which were identical in nature. The Investigating\n\nOfficer duly complied with these observations through a memo dated\n\n26.08.2025 and also filed Memos of Evidence 1 and 2, containing a revised,\n\ndetailed, and descriptive list of witness statements recorded under Section 180\n\nof BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 161\nof Cr.P.C.) up to L.W.292, as well as\n\nstatements under Section 183 of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 164\nof\n\nCr.P.C.), along with a list of documents extending up to Volume 57, before the\n\nSpecial Court. It was further argued that the BNSS does not prescribe any\n\nnomenclature such as \"preliminary\" or \"final\" charge sheet. The learned Special\n\nJudge erroneously referred to the charge sheet dated 19.07.2025 as a\n\npreliminary charge sheet. When the Investigating Agency files a charge sheet in\n\ncompliance with the statutory requirements under Section 193(3) of BNSS\n\n(corresponding to\nSection 173(2)\nof Cr.P.C.), it constitutes a complete charge\n\nsheet. In fact, the report was accompanied by all requisite documents and\n\nwitness statements as mandated under\nSection 173(5)\nof the Cr.P.C.\n\n13. It was further contended by learned Senior Counsel that the\n\nlearned Special Judge erred in holding that the non-filing of certain FSL reports\n\nand the absence of a sanction order to prosecute Accused No. 1, a public servant,\namounted to the filing of an incomplete charge sheet. The absence of some FSL\n\nreports, which may be attributable to systemic delays, does not render the\n\ncharge sheet incomplete. Even if such deficiencies exist, they constitute curable\n\nirregularities rather than illegalities that vitiate the charge sheet. Furthermore,\n\nonce a charge sheet is filed within the prescribed period of ninety days, its return\n\nfor compliance with certain procedural objections, such as obtaining a scientific\n\nexpert's opinion amounts to due compliance under\nSection 173(2)\nof the Cr.P.C.\n\nHowever, such procedural compliance does not confer upon the accused any\n\nright to claim statutory (default) bail.\n\n14. Another line of argument advanced by the learned Senior Counsel\n\nis that the learned Special Judge erred in holding that the charge sheet was\n\nincomplete, merely because the Investigating Agency sought permission to\n\nplace additional documents and technical evidence on record. He submitted\n\nthat even after filing the final report, the Investigating Agency is empowered to\n\nproduce further documents and evidence before the Court in accordance with\n\nSection 193(9) of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 173(8)\nof Cr.P.C.).\n\n15. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that all particulars\n\nrequired under Section 193(3) of the BNSS were duly incorporated in the charge\n\nsheet, and therefore, it cannot be termed as 'incomplete'. The objections raised\n\nin the Official Memorandum dated 23.08.2025 reflect non-application of mind,\n\nas they are untenable, contrary to law, and based on fallacious reasoning. The\n\ncorrections made in compliance with the said Official Memorandum relate back\n\nto the date of filing of the original charge sheet.\n16. Furthermore, learned Senior Counsel submitted that while\n\nexamining the charge sheet for the purpose of taking cognizance under Section\n\n210 of the BNSS, three courses of action are available to the learned Special\n\nJudge and the learned Special Judge failed to exercise these options viz., accept\n\nthe report, reject the report or direct further investigation, available while\n\nissuing the Official Memoranda dated 23.08.2025 and acted de hors the law.\n\nAlthough the said memoranda purported to be administrative in nature, they\n\nwere issued under the signature of the learned Special Judge, clearly indicating\n\nthat the learned Judge overlooked the existence of Form 69 and Rule 480-1 of\n\nthe Andhra Pradesh Police Manual, as well as the relevant provisions of BNSS.\n\nThe learned Special Judge, therefore, could not have granted default bail to the\n\naccused on the basis of the objections raised through the Official Memoranda\n\ndated 23.08.2025.\n\n17. Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that pendency of further\n\ninvestigation qua other Accused is not a ground for grant of default bail. Merely\n\nbecause the remand extension memos filed after filing of the charge sheet\n\ncontained the grounds pertaining to further investigation on certain aspects\n\nrelated to the larger conspiracy, does not indicate that the investigation qua the\n\nRespondents (Accused Nos.,31, 32 and 33) is still pending or that the charge\n\nsheet is incomplete. In addition, he also submitted that further investigation\n\ncan be continued even after filing of the charge sheet and taking of cognizance\n\nis not material, since filing of the charge sheet is sufficient to extinguish Section\n\n187 (3) of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 167 (2)\nCr.P.C). He would thus point\n\nout that the learned Special Judge in the impugned order erred in observing\nthat, without taking cognizance of the case, remand of the Accused cannot be\n\nextended under\nSection 309 (2)\nof Cr.P.C., beyond 90 days.\n\n18. Learned Senior Counsel further brought to the notice of the Court\n\nthat even after filing of the charge sheets dated 19.07.2025 and 11.08.2025, the\n\nlearned Special Judge extended the remand of the Accused, observing that since\n\ntwo charge sheets had already been filed by the SIT, the remand was being\n\ncontinued. The said charge sheets were under scrutiny and pending compliance\n\nof certain office objections, and in the meantime, the Accused were remanded\n\nto judicial custody till 09.09.2025. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the\n\nextension of remand after filing of the charge sheets clearly establishes that the\n\nreports were filed within the statutory period of 90 days. Once the charge sheet\n\nis filed, the remand of the Accused can only be under Section 346 of BNSS\n\n(corresponding to\nSection 309\nof Cr.P.C.). Therefore, when the Accused were\n\nremanded under Section 346 of BNSS, the question of claiming default bail\n\nunder Section 187(3) of the BNSS does not arise. The moment a charge sheet is\n\nfiled within the prescribed 90 days, the right of the Accused to seek default bail\n\nstands extinguished.\n\n19. Learned Senior Counsel further also submitted that the learned\n\nSpecial Judge erroneously addressed only the liberty of the accused by\n\ncompletely overlooking the rights of the prosecution and the victim. He would\n\nstate that right to free and fair investigation and trial includes maintenance of a\n\nbalance between accused and prosecution rights. He also submitted that the\n\ninvestigating agency has every authority to produce additional documents and\n\nevidence as it may gather during further investigation. He urged that the word\n'shall' used in\nSection 173 (5)\nCr.P.C. is not mandatory but only directory and\n\nthe Prosecution can file relevant documents even after filing the final report.\n\n20. Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out the new proviso\n\nintroduced under Section 193(9) of BNSS, which mandates the Police Officer to\n\ntake permission of the Magistrate to carry out further investigation during trial.\n\nIt is the argument of the learned Senior Counsel that the Investigating Agency\n\nis not required to take permission of the Court for carrying out further\n\ninvestigation as long as the trial has not commenced. He would submit that in\n\nthe present case, the Investigating Agency, as a matter of transparency, apprised\n\nthe Special Judge of the ongoing further investigation, even though the trial had\n\nnot yet commenced.\n\n21. Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that the learned Special\n\nJudge took 34 days to issue the Official Memorandum in response to the final\n\nreport dated 19.07.2025 and 11 days for the supplementary charge sheet dated\n\n11.08.2025, yet permitted only three days to comply with the raised objections.\n\nHe stated that although the Investigating Officer duly filed the necessary\n\ncompliances on 26.08.2025, which were reflected before the Special Court on\n\n01.09.2025, the Special Court, without properly scrutinizing these submissions,\n\nhastily proceeded to hear the Respondents' applications and granted default\n\nbail. Furthermore, he submitted that the impugned order dated 06.09.2025\n\nfails to refer to or consider the compliances filed by the Investigating Agency on\n\n26.08.2025. The learned Special Judge could have exercised any of the three\n\nlegally available options after the filing of the charge sheet but chose not to do\n\nso and instead granted default bail. It is well settled that the Court's inability to\ntake cognizance is not a valid ground to grant default bail, as the filing of the\n\ncharge sheet and continued judicial remand extinguish the accused's right to\n\nclaim such bail, irrespective of cognizance status.\n\n22. Learned Senior Counsel would finally submit that the impugned\n\norder stating that the Investigating Agency has not complied with the defects,\n\nby placing heavy reliance on the decision in\nRitu Chhabaria v. Union of\n\nIndia\nand others8, is incorrect.\n\nLearned Senior Counsel brought it to the\n\nnotice of the Court that, a three Judge Bench in\nDirectorate of Enforcement\n\nv. Manpreet Singh Talwar9\nclarified that a trial Court or High Court, as the\n\ncase may be shall not precluded from considering an application for the grant\n\nof default bail under\nSection 167\nof Cr.P.C., independent of and without relying\n\non the judgment dated 26.04.2023 in Writ Petition (Crl.)\n\nNo.60 of 2023 i.e.\n\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra). Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that\n\nthe order passed by the Three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nreferred to supra, is in force, though the review petition preferred by CBI was\n\ndismissed in Ritu Chhabaria.\n\n23.\nIn support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel Sri Sidharth\n\nLuthra placed reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nVenkatesan Balasubramaniyan v. Intelligence Officer\n, Directorate\n\nof Revenue Intelligence,10 Bhupinder Singh v. Jarnail Singh11,\nSharif\n\nAhmad and another v. State of U.P.12\n,\nK.Veeraswami v.

State\n\nof Andhra Pradesh.30\n\nOn behalf of Accused No.31:\n\n24. Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel for Respondent /\n\nAccused No.31, submitted that, as evident from the evolution of law from the\n\n13 (1991) 3 SCC 655\n14 (2014) 16 SCC 543\n15 (2023) 17 SCC 48\n16 (2024) 3 SCC 734\n17 (2024) 6 SCC 758\n18 (2023) 15 SCC 311\n19 (2002) 5 SCC 582\n20 (2001) 7 SCC 536\n21 (2023) 16 SCC 779\n22 (1985) 2 SCC 537\n23 (2007) 8 SCC 770\n24 (1994) 5 SCC 410\n25 (2013) 3 SCC 77\n26 2000 SCC OnLine Del 1336\n27 2000 SCC OnLine Del 911\n28 1993 SCC OnLine AP 260\n29 2009 SCC OnLine AP 264\n30 2020 SCC OnLine AP 1464\nCr.P.C\n., 1898, through the recommendations of the Law Commission, to the\n\nenactment of the\nCr.P.C\n., 1973, and now the BNSS, 2023, the legislature has\n\nconsistently accorded paramount importance to the personal liberty of an\n\nindividual. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that there is no prohibition to\n\ncontinue the investigation after the statutory period of 60 / 90 days and the\n\nright under Section 187 of BNSS is triggered upon failure to complete the\n\ninvestigation. He argued that the question as to whether the Investigating\n\nOfficer filed charge sheet to defeat the right of an Accused to default bail would\n\nbe a question of fact.\n\n25. Learned Senior Counsel contended that the judgment relied upon\n\nby the State in Kapil Wadhwan (supra) cannot be construed to mean that the\n\nCourt is bound to mechanically accept the filing of a charge sheet as conclusive\n\nproof of completion of investigation, without exercising its judicial discretion.\n\nIn the present case, the Investigating Agency is alleged to have misled the Court\n\nby filing the charge sheet on 19.07.2025, despite the fact that Accused Nos. 31\n\nto 33 had been in custody and available for investigation for nearly two months\n\nprior to that date, yet no charge sheet was filed against them during that period.\n\nIt is evident that the Investigating Officer was fully aware that further\n\ninvestigation was being undertaken and that, in such circumstances, permission\n\nof the Court was required to proceed, thereby indicating procedural impropriety\n\non the part of the Investigating Agency.\n\n26. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the test for default\n\nbail is not whether charge sheet has been filed, rather, it is whether the\n\ninvestigation is completed within the prescribed time. He would submit that the\nlearned Special Judge applied this test and on facts held that, investigation is\n\nnot completed. Learned Senior Counsel elaborated further that the charge sheet\n\nmust be valid in the eye of law to continue the custody of the Respondent beyond\n\nthe statutory period. It is further represented that supplementary report based\n\non a material which is already available fails to satisfy Section 193 (9) of BNSS\n\nas it has to be in relation to fresh information after filing the final report. He\n\nalso submitted that if any doubt arises regarding the nature of the charge sheet,\n\nCourt has to lean towards the Accused.\n\n27. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that, when charge sheet\n\nis filed only for certain offences, the charge sheet is considered to be incomplete\n\nand piece-meal. He would submit that an in-depth review of charge sheets\n\ncannot be conducted by the High Court. He would point out that the remand\n\nextension memos filed subsequent to the submission of the supplementary\n\ncharge sheet clearly indicate that the investigation is still at a nascent stage, as\n\nthey emphasize need for continued custodial interrogation and confrontation of\n\nthe Accused with the recovered material. This according to learned Senior\n\nCounsel demonstrates that the investigation remains incomplete, even with\n\nrespect to Accused No. 31, thereby undermining the contention of Investigating\n\nAgency that the investigation had reached its conclusion at the time of filing the\n\ncharge sheet.\n\n28. Learned Senior Counsel contended that the manner in which the\n\ninvestigation has been conducted clearly reflects that it is politically motivated\n\nand tainted with mala fides. He submitted that the State must justify the filing\n\nof multiple charge sheets against different accused persons, as such splitting\nand piecemeal filing appear to be deliberate attempts to frustrate the accused's\n\nstatutory right to default bail. The supplementary charge sheet filed against\n\nRespondent / Accused No. 31 is based on material allegedly gathered after the\n\nfirst charge sheet, yet the pattern indicates an intention to prolong custody\n\nrather than a genuine progression of investigation. Learned Senior Counsel\n\nsubmitted that, once cognizance is taken, Court cannot undo it and as per the\n\nmemo filed by the Prosecution dated 13.08.2025 investigation qua Accused\n\nNo.31 is continuing, when it is a case of conspiracy, the case cannot be\n\nseparated.\n\n29. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the Investigating\n\nOfficer failed to comply with Form 69 of the A.P. Police Rules, as there is no\n\nclarity regarding persons not charge-sheeted. According to the A.P. Police\n\nManual, an incomplete charge sheet cannot be filed merely to keep the accused\n\nin custody. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that Section 193(9) BNSS\n\ncannot substitute for an original, complete charge sheet; only genuinely new\n\nmaterial discovered later justifies further investigation. He would also contend\n\nthat even for further investigation, permission of the Court is essential. He\n\nfurther stated that under Section 346 BNSS, the Court cannot remand an\n\naccused until cognizance of the offence is taken. It is also argued that if the\n\nofficial memorandum dated 23.08.2025 is treated as a judicial order, the failure\n\nto challenge it before the grant of default bail would imply that no valid charge\n\nsheet existed in law. Since the Magistrate had returned the charge sheet before\n\nthe expiry of the statutory period, at the time of the default bail application,\nthere was effectively no charge sheet or material under Section 173 BNSS before\n\nthe Court for consideration.\n\n30. Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the order passed by a\n\nthree Judge Bench in\nManpreet Singh Talwar\n(supra), directing the trial\n\nCourts and High Courts to take independent decision on the point of default bail\n\nwithout reference to the decision in\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra) is purely a\n\ntemporary arrangement.\n\n31.\nIn support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel Sri S.\n\nNiranjan Reddy has placed reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nMariam Fasihuddin and another v. State of Karnataka31\n,\n\nHitendra Vishnu Thakur and others v. State of Maharashtra\nand\n\nothers32, Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam33, Dinesh Dalmia\n\n(supra), Kapil Wadhwan (supra),\nVinay Tyagi v. Irshad Ali\nand\n\nothers34, High Court of Delhi in\nChitra Rama Krishna vs. CBI35\n.\n\nOn behalf of Accused No.32:\n\n32. Sri Siddhartha Dave, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Accused No.\n\n32, submitted that this Court possesses inherent powers under Section 528 of\n\nthe BNSS to act ex debito justitiae and to secure the ends of justice and the\n\njudgments relied upon by the State cannot restrict or predetermine the Court's\n\nindependent assessment of the matter. He stated that the Respondent / Accused\n\nNo. 32, a retired Special Deputy Collector who served as Officer on Special Duty\n\n31 (2024) 11 SCC 733\n32 (1994) 4 SCC 602\n33 (2017) 15 SCC 67\n34 (2013) 5 SCC 762\n35 2022 SCC OnLine Del 3124\n(OSD) in the Chief Minister's Office, was arrested on 16.05.2025 and remanded\n\nto judicial custody on 17.05.2025.\n\n33. Learned Senior Counsel stated that the investigating agency filed a\n\npreliminary charge sheet on 19.07.2025 against sixteen persons and\n\nsupplementary charge sheet on 11.08.2025 against three persons including\n\nAccused No.32 and the period of 90 days in case of Accused No.32 expired on\n\n17.08.2025. He contended that the supplementary charge sheet was filed\n\nwithout completing the investigation, only to defeat an indefeasible right of\n\ndefault bail of the Accused.\n\n34. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that the right to default bail\n\nexhausts only when the investigation is completed i.e., when it is brought to an\n\nend. In the present case, the investigation remains incomplete, and therefore\n\nthe embargo under Section 187 of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 167\nCr.P.C.)\n\ncontinues to apply. While\nSection 167\nCr.P.C. prescribes limits on police and\n\njudicial custody i.e., 15 days for police and 60/90 days for judicial custody, it\n\ndoes not fix a maximum period for completion of investigation; if the\n\ninvestigation is not completed within the prescribed period, the Magistrate has\n\nno option but to release the accused on bail if they are willing.\n\n35. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that filing a report under\n\nSection 193 of BNSS is not a mere formality; it is meant to enable the Magistrate\n\nto take cognizance under Section 210 of BNSS. Filing an incomplete charge\n\nsheet to defeat the accused's statutory right to default bail is contrary to law. He\n\ncontended that in the present case, the learned Special Judge identified serious\n\ndefects in the charge sheet filed by the State and, after providing opportunity\nfor compliance, rightly granted default bail to Respondent/Accused No. 32.\n\nAuthority to conduct further investigation cannot be used as a tool to deny\n\ndefault bail. Further investigation refers to the discovery of fresh material after\n\nfiling the initial report; a preliminary charge sheet cannot be treated as evidence\n\nof a completed investigation under Sections 190 and 193 BNSS. The judgments\n\nrelating to UAPA, NDPS and TADA Acts are not applicable to the facts of the\n\npresent case. Learned counsel finally submitted that the learned Special Judge\n\nclearly observed in the order that the charge sheet is incomplete and it is filed\n\nonly to defeat the rights of the Accused for default bail.\n\n36.\nIn support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel Sri Siddhartha\n\nDave, placed reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nJudgebir Singh\n(supra),\nCBI v. Rathin Dandapat36\n, Achpal v. State of\n\nRajasthan37 Kapil Wadhwan (supra),\nK.Veeraswami\n(supra),\nRitu\n\nChhabaria\n(supra),\nState of Maharashtra v.

Furtado v. CBI &\n\nOrs.47, High\nCourt of Punjab & Haryana in\nState of Haryana v. Mehal\n\nSingh and Anr.48\n\nOn\nbehalf of Accused No.33\n\n37. Sri T. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel for Respondent/\n\nAccused No.33 would submit that, Accused No.33 is not a public servant. The\n\npurpose of filing a charge sheet after completion of investigation is to enable the\n\nCourt to inquire into the matter. Respondent/Accused No.33 was remanded to\n\njudicial custody on 14.05.2025. The learned Special Judge cannot extend the\n\njudicial custody beyond the 90th day unless, he can inquire into the matter on\n\nthe basis of a charge sheet which is filed. It is further submitted that, the 90th\n\nday of such judicial custody of Accused No.33 expired on 11.08.2025. The said\n\nreport filed by the Investigating Agency was not in accordance with Section 193\n\n(3) of BNSS, and thereby, the learned Special Judge could not inquire into the\n\nmatter. The investigating agency filed its report in complete form only on\n\n01.09.2025. However, on 26.08.2025 the Respondent / Accused No.33 filed an\n\napplication for default bail. The learned Special Judge has rightly not\n\nconsidered such compliance in the impugned order. The judgment in the case\n\n43 2024 SCC OnLine Del 1631\n44 2007 SCC OnLine Del 450\n45 1974 SCC OnLine Del 98\n46 2003 SCC OnLine Mad 1165\n47 1996 SCC OnLine Ker 112\n48 1978 SCC OnLine P&H 117\nof Kapil Wadhwan (supra) is not helpful to the case of the Prosecution. In\n\nthe said case, the Court took cognizance of the offence and investigation was\n\npending for some other Accused and the default bail was granted on the ground\n\nthat the investigation was pending against the remaining Accused. Hence, the\n\njudgment is not applicable to the facts of the present case, as the learned Special\n\nJudge could not take cognizance in this matter.\n\n38. Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that an indefeasible\n\nright to be enlarged on default bail had accrued in favour of Accused No.33,\n\nwhich cannot be defeated by a subsequent filing of final report by the\n\nInvestigating Agency. The right to be released on default bail on the failure of\n\nthe Investigating Agency to complete the investigation within 90 days is a\n\nfundamental right enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. The 90th\n\nday is expired on 12.08.2025. The right which had accrued to the Accused by\n\nfiling a petition on 26.08.2025 sought to be defeated by relying upon the\n\ncompliance on 01.09.2025 which is impermissible in law. The Constitutional\n\nCourts have consistently taken a view that, when two views are possible, one in\n\nfavour of the liberty of the Accused and the other which ensures continued\n\nincarceration of the Accused, the Courts are required to take the view that\n\nfavours the liberty of the Accused. The Investigating Agency has filed a charge\n\nsheet only to defeat a valuable right of Accused No.33. The investigation has\n\nbeen person-centric but not offence-centric as it failed to disclose full\n\nparticulars of the offence.\n\n39. Learned Senior Counsel further stated that Accused Nos.1 to 29\n\nwere brought on record by a memo dated 22.04.2025 and Accused Nos.31 to 33\non 05.05.2025. Yet, the initial charge sheet is filed against sixteen Accused and\n\nthe second charge sheet is filed on 11.08.2025 named against Accused Nos.31 to\n\n33. Neither charge sheet satisfies the requirement of completion of investigation\n\nunder Section 190 and 193(2) of BNSS. The tenor of filing piece-meal charge\n\nsheets against particular Accused is only to deprive them of their statutory right.\n\nHe further stated that the Investigating Agency filed remand extension memos\n\nbefore the Court from time to time, which would establish that continued\n\ndetention of the Accused was sought to facilitate investigation. The remand\n\nextension memos filed either prior or subsequent to the filing of the incomplete\n\ncharge sheets, explicitly show that the investigation into the offences is still in\n\nprogress. Further investigation presupposes that the primary investigation has\n\nconcluded with a final report and that the Court can take cognizance.\n\n40. Learned Senior Counsel further argued that the Investigating\n\nAgency never stated that the investigation qua the offences alleged against\n\nAccused No.33 had concluded to enable the Special Court to take cognizance.\n\nAs the investigation remains on going, it cannot be said as further investigation\n\nbut it is a continuing investigation. The remand of an Accused under Section\n\n346 of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 309\nCr.P.C.) arises only after taking\n\ncognizance. Learned Special Judge has noted in the proceedings dated\n\n26.08.2025 that the learned Special Public Prosecutor sought extension of\n\nremand stating that, some more witnesses have to be examined and material\n\nwitness evidence i.e., documentary and technical was yet to be collected from\n\nvarious sources.\n41. Learned Senior Counsel sternly argued that the contention of the\n\nState that the Accused were remanded to judicial custody under Section 346 of\n\nBNSS (corresponding to\nSection 309\nCr.P.C) is misconceived and is liable to be\n\nrejected. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Investigating Officer\n\nhimself mentioned in the remand extension memos that the investigation is still\n\nin progress. As such, the charge sheets dated 19.07.2025 and 11.08.2025 cannot\n\nbe considered as final reports within the meaning of Section 190 of BNSS and\n\nthey are incomplete or piece-meal reports. It is submitted that the judgments\n\nare precedents for what they actually decided and not for what logically follows\n\nfrom them and a judgment has to be understood in the context of its facts.\n\n42. Learned Senior counsel also stated that filing of FSL report along\n\nwith charge sheet is mandatory for compliance of Section 193 (3) BNSS and the\n\nmatter is now referred to a larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Learned\n\ncounsel finally submitted that, they are not relying on\nRitu Chhabaria\n\n(supra), since a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed order\n\nnot to rely on\nthe said judgment\n. He finally submitted that it is a settled law that\n\nthe indefeasible right under Section 187 of BNSS accrues to an accused, when\n\nincomplete charge sheet filed only to scuttle the right of an Accused for default\n\nbail.\n\n43.\nIn support of his contentions, learned Senior Counsel Sri T.\n\nNiranjan Reddy placed reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nBabubhai v. State of Gujarat\nand others49,\nAslam Babalal\n\n49 (2010) 12 SCC 254\nDesai v.

State.59\n\nISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION :\n\n44. This Court has given anxious consideration to the submissions\n\nmade and perused the material on record. On such exercise, the issues falling\n\nfor consideration before this Court, are as follows;\n\na. Whether an Accused is entitled to default bail under proviso to Section\n\n187 (3)(ii) of BNSS when the chargesheet, though filed within the\n\nstatutory period, is returned on certain defects, which are subsequently\n\ncomplied?\n\n50 (1992) 4 SCC 272\n51 (2004) 8 SCC 579\n52 (2008) 1 SCC 494\n53 (2013) 5SCC 762\n54 2023 SCC OnLine SC 553\n55 2024 SCC OnLine SC 726\n56 (2021) 2 SCC 485\n57 1975 SCC OnLine AP 71\n58 AIR 1966 AP 377\n59 2022 SCC OnLine TS 1075\nb. Whether mere permission seeking further investigation would make\n\nthe investigation incomplete and consequently the chargesheet\n\nincomplete for the purposes of default bail under proviso to Section\n\n187(3)(ii) of the BNSS?\n\nc. Whether taking cognizance of the case is precondition for extending\n\nremand of an Accused after the filing of the charge sheet within the\n\nstatutory period, and whether the Court's inability to take cognizance\n\ncan be a ground for default bail?\n\nd. Whether the impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 and the official\n\nmemorandum dated 23.08.2025 are liable to be quashed?\n\nDETERMINATION BY THE COURT:\n\n45. A perusal of Sec. 528 BNSS (corresponding to Sec. 482 Cr. P.C.)\n\nmakes it clear that BNSS envisages that inherent powers of the High Court are\n\nnot limited or affected so as to make orders as may be necessary; (i) to give effect\n\nto any order under the Sanhita or, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\n\nCourt or, otherwise (iii) to secure ends of justice. A court while sitting in\n\ninherent jurisdiction must exercise its powers to do real and substantial justice,\n\ndepending on the facts and circumstances of the case for compelling reasons of\n\nabuse of process of law or glaring injustice, which are against sound principles\n\nof criminal jurisprudence.\n\nLegislative History of the relevant Provisions\n\n46. The concept of 'default bail', enabled in the criminal procedural\n\njurisprudence, reflects an equilibrium between investigative efficiency and\nindividual liberty. Before going forward with the analysis on the present cases,\n\nit is essential to refer to the historical background of the legal provisions.\n\n47. Section 58 of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 57\nof Cr.P.C.)\n\nclarifies that no Police Officer shall detain any arrested person in custody more\n\nthan 24 hours exclusive of the time necessary for journey from the place of\n\narrest to the Magistrate Court, irrespective of jurisdiction. If the Investigating\n\nOfficer failed to complete the investigation within 24 hours of the said arrest,\n\nhe shall produce the person before the Court seeking some time to complete the\n\ninvestigation, Section 187 of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 167\nof Cr.P.C.)\n\ntakes care of such a situation. The Sections are tabulated hereinunder;\n\nCr.P.C\n. BNSS\n\n57. Person arrested not to be 58.

Magistrate's Court, whether having\njurisdiction or not.\n\n48. The historical background of Section 187 BNSS as it stands now starts\n\nfrom the 1898\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\nSection 167\nof Cr.P.C, 1898 provided\n\nfor conclusion of investigations within twenty-four hours or within 15 days at\nthe maximum, regardless of the nature of the offence or the punishment. The\n\nprovision reads as follows;\n\n\"Section 167 -Procedure when investigation cannot\nbe completed in twenty-four hours\n*****\n(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is\nforwarded under this section may, whether he has\nor has not jurisdiction to try the case, from time to\ntime authorise the detention of the accused in such\ncustody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not\nexceeding fifteen days in the whole. If he has not\njurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, and\nconsiders further detention unnecessary, he may order the\naccused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having such\njurisdiction....\"\n\n49. In relation to the above provision in\nCr.P.C\n, 1898, the Law\n\nCommission of India, in its 41st Report, noted that complex investigations are\n\noften not completed within 15 days. In such cases, the police seek custody by\n\nfiling a preliminary or incomplete report, and the Magistrate then uses Section\n\n344 to extend custody, even though the Law Commission, in its 14th Report,\n\nhad stated that Section 344 should apply only after a final report under Section\n\n173 is filed. It was observed that using Section 344 to bypass the limits of Section\n\n167 would lead to misuse allowing prolonged detention while investigation goes\n\nslow. Therefore, as in the earlier Law Commission (14th Report), the maximum\n\nperiod under Section 167 at 60 days was proposed in the 41st Report also.\n\n50. The recommendations of the Law Commission of India were\n\ncarefully examined and accepted, as reflected in the Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons dated 07.11.1970 for introducing the new\nCr.P.C\n, 1973. The\n\nGovernment considered, among other factors, that an accused person should\nreceive a fair trial based on the principles of natural justice, that delays in\n\ninvestigation and trial should be avoided as they harm both individuals and\n\nsociety, and that the procedure should remain simple and ensure fairness,\n\nparticularly for the poorer sections of the community. Consequently,\nSection\nof the Cr.P.C., 1973, was enacted with the recommended time limit,\n\napplicable irrespective of the nature of the offence or the punishment, which\n\nreads thus;\n\n\"Section 167 -Procedure when investigation cannot\nbe completed in twenty-four hours\n*****\n(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded\nunder this section may, whether he has or has not\njurisdiction to try the case, from time to time authorise the\ndetention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate\nthinks fit, for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole:\n\nand if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for\ntrial, and considers further detention unnecessary, he may\norder the accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having\nsuch jurisdiction:\n\nProvided that\n\n(a) the Magistrate may authorise detention of the\naccused person, otherwise than in custody of the\npolice, beyond the period of fifteen days if he is\nsatisfied that adequate grounds exists for doing so,\nbut no Magistrate shall authorise the\ndetention of the accused person in custody\nunder this section for a total period\nexceeding sixty days, and on the expiry of\nthe said period of sixty days, the accused\nperson shall be released on bail if he is prepared to\nand does furnish bail; and every person released on\nbail under this section shall be deemed to be so\nreleased under the provisions of Chapter XXXIII\nfor the purposes of that Chapter;\"\n51. Thereafter in 1978, it was felt that\nSection 167\nof the Cr.P.C., required\n\namendment, not only to extend the period for completing investigations but\n\nalso to link the same to the seriousness of the alleged offence. As a result, it was\n\nproposed that an aggregate period of 90 days be allowed for investigations in\n\ncases involving offences punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or\n\nimprisonment for not less than ten years, and up to 60 days in all other cases.\n\n52. Section 187 of BNSS corresponds to\nSection 167\nof Cr.P.C. and is on\n\nsimilar footing so far as the instant issue of statutory bail stands. Section 187 (3)\n\ncorresponds to\nSection 167(2)\nof the CrPC, and forms the crux of the present\n\ncase.\n\n53. It is pertinent to mention that, a two Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in\nV. Senthil Balaji v. State,60\ndirected the Registry to place the matter\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India to decide whether the police can seek\n\npolice custody only during the first 15 days after the accused is remanded, or\n\nwhether that 15-day period can be used at any time during the entire\n\ninvestigation period of 60 or 90 days. The BNSS resolves this ambiguity by\n\nSection 187(2). It clearly states that the Magistrate may authorize police custody\n\n\"for a term not exceeding fifteen days in the whole, or in parts, at any time\n\nduring the initial forty days or sixty days\" (depending on whether the total\n\nremand period is 60 or 90 days).\n\n60 (2024) 3 SCC 51\n54. Relevant extracts of the provision from\nCr.P.C\n. and BNSS for the present\n\nissue are tabulated hereinunder;\n\nCr. P. C. BNSS\nSection 167: Section 187:\nProcedure when investigation Procedure when investigation\ncannot be completed in twenty- cannot be completed in twenty-\nfour hours. four hours\n(2) The Magistrate to whom (3) The Magistrate may\nan accused person is forwarded authorise the detention of the\nunder this section may, whether he accused person, beyond the period\nhas or has not jurisdiction to try of fifteen days, if he is satisfied that\nthe case, from time to time, adequate grounds exist for doing\nauthorise the detention of the so, but no Magistrate shall\naccused in such custody as such authorise the detention of the\nMagistrate thinks fit, for a term not accused person in custody under\nexceeding fifteen days in the this sub-section for a total period\nwhole; and if he has no jurisdiction exceeding--\nto try the case or commit it for trial, (i) ninety days, where the\nand considers further detention investigation relates to an\nunnecessary, he may order the offence punishable with death,\naccused to be forwarded to a imprisonment for life or\nMagistrate having such imprisonment for a term of ten\njurisdiction: years or more;\nProvided that-- (ii) sixty days, where the\n(a) the Magistrate may investigation relates to any\nauthorise the detention of the other offence,\naccused person, otherwise than in and, on the expiry of the said period\ncustody of the police, beyond the of ninety days, or sixty days, as the\nperiod of fifteen days, if he is case may be, the accused person\nsatisfied that adequate grounds shall be released on bail if he is\nexist for doing so, but no prepared to and does furnish bail,\nMagistrate shall authorise the and every person released on bail\ndetention of the accused person in under this sub-section shall be\ncustody under this paragraph for a deemed to be so released under the\ntotal period exceeding provisions of Chapter XXXV for the\n(i) ninety days, where the purposes of that Chapter.\ninvestigation relates to an\noffence punishable with death,\nimprisonment for life or\nimprisonment for a term of not\nless than ten years;\n(ii) sixty days, where the\ninvestigation relates to any\nother offence,\nand, on the expiry of the said\nperiod of ninety days, or sixty days,\nas the case may be, the accused\nperson shall be released on bail if\nhe is prepared to and does furnish\nbail, and every person released on\nbail under this sub-section shall be\ndeemed to be so released under the\nprovisions of Chapter XXXIII for\nthe purposes of that Chapter;\n.....\n\n55. Therefore, on a whole, the legislative intent has consistently been\n\nto ensure that investigations are completed within 24 hours, and if not, then\n\nwithin 15 days under the 1898\nCr.P.C\n. This limit was later extended to 60 days\n\nunder\nCr.P.C\n., 1973 and eventually to 90 days for offences punishable with\n\ndeath, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of at least 10 years, while the 60-day\n\nlimit continued for all other offences, as is brought in by the 1978 Amendment\n\nand followed in the BNSS. The importance of these 60- and 90-day periods is\n\nthat if the investigation is not completed and no charge sheet is filed within the\n\napplicable time, the accused in custody becomes entitled to 'default' bail,\n\nprovided he is prepared to and does furnish bail.\n\n56. It must be emphasized that the paramount consideration of the\n\nlegislature while enacting\nSection 167(2)\nof Cr.P.C. and the proviso thereto/\n\nSection 187 BNSS was that the investigation must be completed expeditiously,\nand that the accused should not be detained for an unreasonably long period as\n\nwas the situation prevailing under the 1898 Code. This would be in consonance\n\nwith the obligation cast upon the State under\nArticle 21\nto follow a fair, just and\n\nreasonable procedure prior to depriving any person of his personal liberty.\n\n57. \"Investigation\" as defined in\nSection 2(l)\nof the BNSS includes all\n\nthe proceedings under BNSS for the collection of evidence conducted by a police\n\nofficer or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorised by a\n\nMagistrate in this behalf. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nH. N. Rishbud and\n\nAnr. v. State of Delhi61\ncategorized the steps involved in an investigation as\n\nfollows;\n\n\"....investigation consists generally of the following steps:(1)\nProceeding to the spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the\nsuspected offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the\ncommission of the offence which may consist of (a) the\nexamination of various persons (including the accused) and\nthe reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer\nthinks fit, (b) the search of places of seizure of things\nconsidered necessary for the investigation and to be\nproduced at the trial, and (5) Formation of the opinion\nas to whether on the material collected there is a\ncase to place the accused before a Magistrate for\ntrial and if so taking the necessary steps for the\nsame by the filing of a charge-sheet under section\n\n173.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n58. Sec.193 (1) BNSS (corresponding to\nSec.173 (1)\nCr.P.C.) enjoins\n\nthat the investigation must be completed without 'unreasonable delay'.\n\n61 1955 SCR (1)1150\nRelevant extracts of these two provisions for the instant case are tabulated\n\nhereunder; (Emphasized portion indicates change)\n\nCr.

Section 193(3) of BNSS (corresponding to\nSection 173(2)\nCr.P.C.)\n\nmandates that once investigation is completed, the Officer in charge of the\n\nPolice Station shall forward, a report to the Magistrate empowered to take\n\ncognizance of the offence, including electronically (inserted by BNSS). The\n\nreport must be in the format prescribed by the State Government and must state\n\nthe required details as contained in the sub-clauses (a) to (i) of Section 193\n\n(3)(i). In addition to the requirements as provided in Section 173 (2), the BNSS\n\nintroduced the sequence of custody in case of electronic device, vide sub-clause\n\n(i). Further, vide the newly inserted Section 193 (3)(ii), the police officer must\n\ninform the informant or the victim about the progress of the investigation\n\nwithin 90 days, using any means, including electronic communication.\n60. Section 193 (6) of BNSS mandates when such report is in respect\n\nof a case to which Section 190 of BNSS applies, the Police Officer shall forward\n\nto the Magistrate along with the report, all documents or relevant extracts\n\nthereof on which the Prosecution proposes to rely other than those already sent\n\nto the Magistrate during investigation and the statements recorded under\n\nSection 180 of BNSS of all the persons whom the prosecution proposes to\n\nexamine as its witnesses. Subsection (8) of 193\nCr.P.C\n. is newly inserted, which\n\nmandates the police officer investigating the case to submit such number of\n\ncopies of police report for supply to the accused, including by electronic\n\ncommunication.\n\n61. Section 193(9) of BNSS, like\nSection 173(8)\nof Cr.P.C., allows the\n\npolice to conduct further investigation even after submitting the initial report\n\nto the Magistrate and requires that any new oral or documentary evidence be\n\nforwarded through a supplementary report to which the same procedural rules\n\napply. However, the BNSS adds a new proviso stating that further investigation\n\nduring trial may be carried out only with the Court's permission and must be\n\ncompleted within ninety days, thereafter extendable with the Court's approval.\n\n62. So far as to identify the trend of application of legal provisions\n\nsupra, it is essential to primarily deal with few judicial pronouncements.\n\nKey Precedents on Statutory Bail\n\n63. The Hon'ble Supreme Court and various High Courts, in a line of\n\nprecedents categorically held that an indefeasible right accrues to an accused\n\nwhen the prosecution fails to file a charge-sheet within the period prescribed\n\nunder the proviso to\nSection 167(2)\nof the CrPC, provided that the accused is\nready to and does, in fact, furnishes bail. Right to default bail is not merely a\n\nstatutory entitlement under the proviso to\nSection 167(2)\nof CrPC, but forms an\n\nintegral part of the \"procedure established by law\" as under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, thereby elevating it to the status of a fundamental right of\n\nan accused, provided that the conditions stipulated are fulfilled. Explaining this\n\nprinciple of law, a three-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nBikramjit Singh v. State of Punjab62\nheld as follows:\n\n\"36. ...A conspectus of the aforesaid decisions would show\nthat so long as an application for grant of default bail is made\non expiry of the period of 90 days (which application need not\neven be in writing) before a charge sheet is filed, the right to\ndefault bail becomes complete. It is of no moment that the\nCriminal Court in question either does not dispose of such\napplication before the charge sheet is filed or disposes of such\napplication wrongly before such charge sheet is filed. So long\nas an application has been made for default bail on\nexpiry of the stated period before time is further\nextended to the maximum period of 180 days, default\nbail, being an indefeasible right of the accused under\nthe first proviso to Section 167(2), kicks in and must be\ngranted.\n\n37. ..... The right to default bail, as has been correctly\nheld by the judgments of this Court, are not mere\nstatutory rights under the first proviso to Section\n167(2) of the Code, but is part of the procedure\nestablished by law under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution\nof India, which is, therefore, a fundamental right\ngranted to an accused person to be released on bail\nonce the conditions of the first proviso to Section 167(2)\nare fulfilled. ...\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n64. A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nSanjay\n\nDutt\n(supra) answered questions concerning the proper construction of Section\n\n62 2020 SCC OnLine SC 824\n20 (4) (bb) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 198763\n\nindicating the nature of right of an accused to be released on bail thereunder.\n\nUnder TADA, the normal 90-day or 60-day limit as in\nSection 167\nCrPC is\n\nmodified to the extent that the investigation must be finished within 180 days\n\nfor the offences under the said Act. If the police cannot finish in 180 days, the\n\nDesignated Court may extend the time up to 1 year, but only if the Public\n\nProsecutor submits a report explaining the progress of the investigation and\n\ngiving specific reasons why the accused must remain in custody longer. This\n\ngives rise to the right of the accused to be released on default bail on expiry of\n\n180 days or the extended period on default to complete the investigation within\n\nthe time allowed. At para 48, the Hon'ble Supreme Court answered the\n\nreference as follows;\n\n\"53...\n\n(2)(b) The \"indefeasible right\" of the accused to be\nreleased on bail in accordance with\nSection\n20(4)(bb)\nof the TADA Act read with\nSection 167(2)\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure in default of\ncompletion of the investigation and filing of the\nchallan within the time allowed, as held\nin Hitendra Vishnu Thakur is a right which enures\nto, and is enforceable by the accused only from the\ntime of default till the filing of the challan and it\ndoes not survive or remain enforceable on the\nchallan being filed. If the accused applies for bail under\nthis provision on expiry of the period of 180 days or the\nextended period, as the case may be, then he has to be\nreleased on bail forthwith. The accused, so released on bail\nmay be arrested and committed to custody according to the\nprovisions of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. The right of\nthe accused to be released on bail after filing of the challan,\n\n63 For short, TADA\nnotwithstanding the default in filing it within the time\nallowed, is governed from the time of filing of the challan\nonly by the provisions relating to the grant of bail applicable\nat that stage.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n65.\nIn\nUday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra\n64, the\n\naccused, booked under Sections 406 and 420 IPC and the Maharashtra\n\nProtection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishment) Act, 1999,65\n\nsurrendered on 17.6.2000 and the 60 day period for filing chargesheet expired\n\non 16.8.2000. He applied for default bail on 17.8.2000, but the Magistrate\n\nrejected it on the ground that Section 167(2) did not apply to\nMPID Act\noffences.\n\nThe High Court later held that Section 167(2) does apply, but refused bail\n\nbecause the chargesheet had been filed on 30.8.2000, a day before the matter\n\nwas heard on 31.8.2000.\n\nRelying on\nSanjay Dutt\n(supra), the High Court held\n\nthat the right to default bail does not survive once a charge-sheet is filed before\n\nthe bail claim is decided. In this context, a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observed that Sections 57 and proviso to\nSection 167 (2)\nof the\n\nCr.P.C. are in consonance with the constitutional mandate of\nArticle 22 (2)\nand\n\nthat the statutory bail under Section 167 (2) proviso is a beneficial provision for\n\ncuring the mischief of indefinitely prolonging the investigation which affects the\n\nliberty of a citizen. The following conclusions were culled out;\n\n\"1. Under sub-section (2) of Section 167, a Magistrate\nbefore whom an accused is produced while the police is\ninvestigating into the offence can authorise detention of the\naccused in such custody as the Magistrate thinks fit for a\nterm not exceeding 15 days on the whole.\n\n64 (2001) 5 SCC 453\n65 For short, MPID Act\n2. Under the proviso to the aforesaid sub-\n\nsection (2) of Section 167, the Magistrate may authorise\ndetention of the accused otherwise than in the custody of\npolice for a total period not exceeding 90 days where the\ninvestigation relates to offence punishable with death,\nimprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less\nthan 10 years, and 60 days where the investigation relates to\nany other offence.\n\n3. On the expiry of the said period of 90 days\nor 60 days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right\naccrues in favour of the accused for being released\non bail on account of default by the investigating\nagency in the completion of the investigation within\nthe period prescribed and the accused is entitled to\nbe released on bail, if he is prepared to and\nfurnishes the bail as directed by the Magistrate.\n\n4. When an application for bail is filed by an accused\nfor enforcement of his indefeasible right alleged to have\nbeen accrued in his favour on account of default on the part\nof the investigating agency in completion of the\ninvestigation within the specified period, the Magistrate/\ncourt must dispose of it forthwith, on being satisfied that in\nfact the accused has been in custody for the period of 90\ndays or 60 days, as specified and no charge-sheet has been\nfiled by the investigating agency. Such prompt action on the\npart of the Magistrate/court will not enable the prosecution\nto frustrate the object of the Act and the legislative mandate\nof an accused being released on bail on account of the\ndefault on the part of the investigating agency in completing\nthe investigation within the period stipulated.\n\n5. If the accused is unable to furnish the bail as\ndirected by the Magistrate, then on a conjoint reading of\nExplanation I and the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section\n167, the continued custody of the accused even beyond the\nspecified period in para (a) will not be unauthorised, and\ntherefore, if during that period the investigation is complete\nand the charge-sheet is filed then the so-called indefeasible\nright of the accused would stand extinguished.\n\n6. The expression \"if not already availed of\" used by\nthis Court in\nSanjay Dutt\ncase [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC\n(Cri) 1433] must be understood to mean when the accused\nfiles an application and is prepared to offer bail on being\ndirected. In other words, on expiry of the period specified in\npara (a) of the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167 if the\naccused files an application for bail and offers also to furnish\nthe bail on being directed, then it has to be held that the\naccused has availed of his indefeasible right even though the\ncourt has not considered the said application and has not\nindicated the terms and conditions of bail, and the accused\nhas not furnished the same\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n66. The appeal preferred was allowed as according to the majority in\nUday\n\nMohanlal Acharya\n(supra), the accused's right to default bail had already\n\nbeen availed of on 17.8.2000, when he filed an application offering to furnish\n\nbail after the statutory period expired and the Magistrate wrongly rejected the\n\nplea. It was ruled that although the charge-sheet was later filed during\n\nproceedings in the High Court, it did not extinguish the right.\n\nHowever, by way\n\nof minority judgment in\nUday Mohanlal Acharya\n(supra), view was taken\n\nthat the right is availed only after the accused actually furnishes the bail bond,\n\nnot merely on filing the application.\n\n67.\nIn\nM.Ravindran\n(supra), the issue that arose was whether the\n\nindefeasible right accruing to the appellant under\nSection 167(2)\n, CrPC gets\n\nextinguished by subsequent filing of an additional complaint by the\n\ninvestigating agency. It was decided that the filing of an additional complaint\n\nafter the accused has availed his right to be released on default bail, should not\n\ndeter the courts from enforcing this indefeasible right, if the charge-sheet was\n\nnot filed before the expiry of the statutory period. The following guidelines were\n\nculled out;\n\"18.1 Once the accused files an application for bail under\nthe Proviso to Section 167(2) he is deemed to have 'availed\nof' or enforced his right to be released on default bail,\naccruing after expiry of the stipulated time limit for\ninvestigation. Thus, if the accused applies for bail under\n\nSection 167(2)\n, CrPC read with\nSection 36A (4)\n, NDPS Act\nupon expiry of 180 days or the extended period, as the case\nmay be, the Court must release him on bail forthwith\nwithout any unnecessary delay after getting necessary\ninformation from the public prosecutor, as mentioned\nsupra. Such prompt action will restrict the prosecution from\nfrustrating the legislative mandate to release the accused on\nbail in case of default by the investigative agency.\n18.2 The right to be released on default bail continues to\nremain enforceable if the accused has applied for such bail,\nnotwithstanding pendency of the bail application; or\nsubsequent filing of the chargesheet or a report seeking\nextension of time by the prosecution before the Court; or\nfiling of the chargesheet during the interregnum when\nchallenge to the rejection of the bail application is pending\nbefore a higher Court.\n\n18.3 However, where the accused fails to apply for default\nbail when the right accrues to him, and subsequently a\nchargesheet, additional complaint or a report seeking\nextension of time is preferred before the Magistrate, the\nright to default bail would be extinguished. The Magistrate\nwould be at liberty to take cognizance of the case or grant\nfurther time for completion of the investigation, as the case\nmay be, though the accused may still be released on bail\nunder other provisions of the\nCrPC\n.\n\n18.4 Notwithstanding the order of default bail passed by the\nCourt, by virtue of Explanation I to Section 167(2), the\nactual release of the accused from custody is contingent on\nthe directions passed by the competent Court granting bail.\nIf the accused fails to furnish bail and/or comply with the\nterms and conditions of the bail order within the time\nstipulated by the Court, his continued detention in custody\nis valid.\"\n68. In Achpal (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the settled\n\nprincipal concerning statutory bail as follows;\n\n\"12. The principles laid down in Uday Mohanlal\nAcharya have been consistently followed by this Court,\nnamely, in\nState of W.B. v. Dinesh Dalmia\n;\nSanjay\nKumar Kedia v. Narcotics Control Bureau\n;\nUnion of\nIndia v. Nirala Yadav\nand in\nRambeer Shokeen v. State\n(NCT of Delhi) [Rambeer Shokeen\nv. State (NCT of Delhi),\n(2018) 4 SCC 405 : (2018) 2 SCC (Cri) 498] . It must\ntherefore be taken to be well settled that in terms\nof 3rd conclusion as recorded in Uday Mohanlal\nAcharya, on the expiry of the period stipulated, an\nindefeasible right accrues in favour of the accused\nfor being released on bail on account of default by\nthe investigating agency in the completion of the\ninvestigation within the period stipulated and the\naccused is entitled to be released on bail, if he is\nprepared to and furnishes the bail as directed by\nthe Magistrate.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n69.\nIn\nMohd. Iqbal Madar Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra,66\n\na three-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court right held that the right to\n\nstatutory bail under proviso to Section 167 (2) cannot be defeated by any court,\n\nif the accused concerned is prepared and does furnish bail bonds to the\n\nsatisfaction of the court concerned. The relevant extract reads;\n\n\"If an accused charged with any kind of offence becomes\nentitled to be released on bail under proviso (a) to Section\n167(2), that statutory right should not be defeated by\nkeeping the applications pending till the charge-sheets are\nsubmitted so that the right which had accrued is\nextinguished and defeated.\"\n\n66 (1996) 1 SCC 722\n70. In Rakesh Kumar Paul (supra), a three Judge Bench of Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, dealt with the interpretation of the phrase \"punishable with\n\nimprisonment for not less than 10 years\" which occurs in Section 167(2) for\n\ndetermining whether the permissible period of custody is 60 days or 90 days in\n\nrelation to the offence punishable under\nSection 13 (1)\nof the PC Act. While\n\nemphasizing on the duty of the courts in matters concerning personal liberty\n\nand penal statutes, observed thus;\n\n\"44.....Strong words indeed. That being so we are of the\nclear opinion that adapting this principle, it would\nequally be the duty and responsibility of a court on\ncoming to know that the accused person before it is\nentitled to \"default bail\", to at least apprise him or\nher of the indefeasible right. A contrary view would\ndiminish the respect for personal liberty, on which so much\nemphasis has been laid by this Court as is evidenced by the\ndecisions mentioned above, and also adverted to in Nirala\nYadav.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n71.\nIn\nSatender Kumar Antil v. CBI\n, terming the indefeasible right to\nstatutory bail under Section 167 (2) as an integral part of the right to personal\n\nliberty under Art 21, it was observed thus;\n\n\"41. As a consequence of the right flowing from the said\nprovision, courts will have to give due effect to it, and thus\nany detention beyond this period would certainly be illegal,\nbeing an affront to the liberty of the person concerned.\nTherefore, it is not only the duty of the investigating\nagency but also the courts to see to it that an\naccused gets the benefit of Section 167(2).\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n67 (2022) 10 SCC 51\n72.\nIn\nDinesh Dalmia\n(supra), interpretation of\nSection 167 (2)\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nvis-à-vis\nSection 309 (2)\nof Cr.P.C. fell for consideration. With regard to the\n\nscope of statutory bail, it was observed as follows;\n\n\"25. Such a right of bail although is a valuable right\nbut the same is a conditional one; the condition\nprecedent being pendency of the investigation.\nWhether an investigation in fact has remained pending\nand the investigating officer has submitted the charge-\nsheet only with a view to curtail the right of the accused\nwould essentially be a question of fact..... \"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n73. In light of the provisions of the BNSS, along with the precedents\n\ndiscussed above, it is clear that when an accused is arrested, during the course\n\nof an investigation, the accused must be produced before the Magistrate if the\n\ninvestigation cannot be completed within 24 hours of the arrest, so that the\n\nMagistrate may authorise custody. At this stage, under Section 187 of the BNSS,\n\nthe Magistrate is empowered to remand the accused to police or judicial custody\n\nfor up to 15 days, subject to a maximum of 60 or 90 days, depending on the\n\nnature of the case. If the investigating agency fails to file the charge sheet within\n\nthe prescribed period, the accused becomes entitled to statutory bail. In other\n\nwords, if the investigation is not completed and the police report is not filed\n\nwithin the statutory period, the consequence is that the accused must be\n\nreleased on default bail, provided he is willing to furnish bail to the satisfaction\n\nof the Magistrate.\n\n74. The underlying object of Section 187(3)(i) BNSS thus appears to be to\n\ncaution investigating officers to complete investigations promptly, failing which\nthe accused must be released on default bail. At the same time, this provision\n\nprotects the fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution by\n\npreventing indefinite incarceration, whether at the pre-cognizance or post-\n\ncognizance stage, before the accused's guilt is established.\n\nKey Precedents on Constituents of a Chargesheet\n\n75. A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nK.\n\nVeeraswami\n(supra), dealt with a question whether a Judge of the Supreme\n\nCourt or a Judge of a High Court is a public servant within the meaning of\n\nSection 2\nof the PC Act, 1947 and can be bought within the purview of\nSection\n\n6(1) (c)\nof the Act or not. As the legality of the chargesheet was also challenged,\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court held thus;\n\n\"76. The charge-sheet is nothing but a final report of police\nofficer under\nSection 173(2)\nof the CrPC. The Section 173(2)\nprovides that on completion of the investigation the police\nofficer investigating into a cognizable offence shall submit a\nreport. The report must be in the form prescribed by\nthe State Government and stating therein (a) the\nnames of the parties; (b) the nature of the\ninformation; (c) the names of the persons who\nappear to be acquainted with the circumstances of\nthe case; (d) whether any offence appears to have\nbeen committed and, if so, by whom (e) whether the\naccused has been arrested; (f) whether he had been\nreleased on his bond and, if so, whether with or\nwithout sureties; and (g) whether he has been\nforwarded in custody under Section 170. As observed\nby this Court in\nSatya Narain Musadi v. State of\nBihar\n, that the statutory requirement of the report under\nSection 173(2) would be complied with if the various details\nprescribed therein are included in the report. This report is\nan intimation to the magistrate that upon investigation into\na cognizable offence the Investigating Officer has been able\nto procure sufficient evidence for the court to inquire into\nthe offence and the necessary information is being sent to\nthe court. In fact, the report under Section 173(2)\npurports to be an opinion of the Investigating\nOfficer that as far as he is concerned he has been\nable to procure sufficient material for the trial of\nthe accused by the court. The report is complete if\nit is accompanied with all the documents and\nstatements of witnesses as required by Section\n175(5). Nothing more need be stated in the report of\nthe Investigating Officer. It is also not necessary\nthat all the details of the offence must be stated. The\ndetails of the offence are required to be proved to\nbring home the guilt to the accused at a later stage\ni.e. in the course of the trial of the case by adducing\nacceptable evidence.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n76.\nIn the context of the facts in\nK. Veeraswami\n(supra), it was observed\n\nby the Constitution Bench that the charge sheet met all the requirements of\n\nSection 173(2)\nCrPC as it clearly stated that, during the relevant period, the\n\nappellant possessed assets both in his own name and in the names of his family\n\nmembers disproportionate to his known income by ₹6,41,416.36 and could not\n\naccount for them. The details of these assets were fully set out, and nothing\n\nmore was required under the law.\n\n77.\nIn\nDablu Kujur\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court having examined\n\nthe importance of a complete police report under\nSection 173(2)\nof the CrPC,\n\nemphasized that the investigating officer must strictly comply with the statutory\n\nrequirements while submitting a chargesheet, noting the variant practices and\n\ndefaults in states.\n\n\"6. The police report submitted by the police under\nSection\n173(2)\nCrPC being very important piece of document from the\nviewpoint of the prosecution, the defence and the court, we\ndeem it necessary to elaborately deal with the various aspects\ninvolved in the said provision. For the reasons stated\nhereinafter, we are of the opinion that it is incumbent on the\npart of the investigating officer to strictly comply with the\nrequirements of the said provisions, as non-compliance\nthereof gives rise to many legal issues in the court of law.\n\n*****\n\n13. We are more concerned with Section 173(2) as we have\nfound that the investigating officers while submitting the\ncharge-sheet/police report do not comply with the\nrequirements of the said provision. Though it is true that\nthe form of the report to be submitted under Section\n173(2) has to be prescribed by the State Government\nand each State Government has its own Police Manual\nto be followed by the police officers while discharging\ntheir duty, the mandatory requirements required to\nbe complied with by such officers in the police\nreport/charge-sheet are\nlaid down in\nSection 173,\nmore particularly sub-section (2) thereof.\n\n14. It may be noted that though there are various reports\nrequired to be submitted by the police in charge of the police\nstation before, during and after the investigation as\ncontemplated in Chapter XII\nCrPC\n, it is only the report\nforwarded by the police officer to the Magistrate under sub-\nsection (2) of Section 173CrPC that can form the basis for the\ncompetent court for taking cognizance thereupon. A charge-\nsheet is nothing but a final report of the police officer\nunder\nSection 173(2)\nCrPC. It is an opinion or intimation\nof the investigating officer to the court concerned that on the\nmaterial collected during the course of investigation, an\noffence appears to have been committed by the particular\nperson or persons, or that no offence appears to have been\ncommitted.\n\n15. When such a police report concludes that an\noffence appears to have been committed by a\nparticular person or persons, the Magistrate has\nthree options:\n\n(i) he may accept the report and take cognizance of\nthe offence and issue process,\n(ii) he may direct further investigation under sub-\n\nsection (3) of Section 156 and require the police to\nmake a further report, or\n\n(iii) he may disagree with the report and discharge\nthe accused or drop the proceedings.\n\nIf such police report concludes that no offence appears to have\nbeen committed, the Magistrate again has three options:\n\n(i) he may accept the report and drop the proceedings, or\n\n(ii) he may disagree with the report and taking the view that\nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding further, take\ncognizance of the offence and issue process, or\n\n(iii) he may direct further investigation to be made by the\npolice under sub-section (3) of Section 156 [Bhagwant\nSingh v. CBI, (1985) 2 SCC 537 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 267] .\n\n****\n\n20. Ergo, having regard to the provisions contained\nin Section 173 it is hereby directed that the report of\npolice officer on the completion of investigation shall\ncontain the following:\n\n20.1. A report in the form prescribed by the State\nGovernment stating--\n\n(a) The names of the parties;\n\n(b) The nature of the information;\n\n(c) The names of the persons who appear to be acquainted\nwith the circumstances of the case;\n\n(d) Whether any offence appears to have been committed\nand, if so, by whom;\n\n(e) Whether the accused has been arrested;\n\n(f) Whether he has been released on his bond and, if so,\nwhether with or without sureties;\n\n(g) Whether he has been forwarded in custody under\nSection 170.\n\n(h) Whether the report of medical examination of the\nwoman has been attached where investigation relates to an\noffence under [Sections 376, 376-A, 376-AB, 376-B, 376-C,\n376-D, 376-DA, 376-DB or Section 376-E of the Penal Code (45\nof 1860)]\n20.2. If upon the completion of investigation, there is no\nsufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion to justify\nthe forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, the police officer\nin charge shall clearly state in the report about the compliance\nof Section 169CrPC.\n\n20.3. When the report in respect of a case to which Section\n170 applies, the police officer shall forward to the Magistrate\nalong with the report, all the documents or relevant extracts\nthereof on which the prosecution proposes to rely other than\nthose already sent to the Magistrate during investigation; and\nthe statements recorded under Section 161 of all the persons\nwhom the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses.\n20.4. In case of further investigation, the police officer in\ncharge shall forward to the Magistrate a further report or\nreports regarding such evidence in the form prescribed and\nshall also comply with the details mentioned in the above sub-\nparas 20.1 to 20.3.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n78.\nIn\nSharif Ahmed\n(supra), a two Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt, while dealing with an appeal arising out of quashment of chargesheet had\n\nobserved as follows by placing reliance on the decision of the Constitution bench\n\nin\nK. Veeraswami\n(supra);\n\n\"13. The question of the required details being complete\nmust be understood in a way which gives effect to the true\nintent of the charge-sheet under Section 173(2) of the Code.\nThe requirement of \"further evidence\" or a \"supplementary\ncharge-sheet\" as referred to under Section 173(8) of the\nCode, is to make additions to a complete charge-sheet,\n[\nState v. Hemendhra Reddy\n, (2023) 16 SCC 779] and not to\nmake up or reparate for a charge-sheet which does not fulfil\nrequirements of Section 173(2) of the Code. The charge-\nsheet is complete when it refers to material and evidence\nsufficient to take cognizance and for the trial. The nature\nand standard of evidence to be elucidated in a charge-sheet\nshould prima facie show that an offence is established if the\nmaterial and evidence is proven. The charge-sheet is\ncomplete where a case is not exclusively dependent on\nfurther evidence. The trial can proceed on the basis of\nevidence and material placed on record with the charge-\nsheet. This standard is not overly technical or foolproof, but\na pragmatic balance to protect the innocent from\nharassment due to delay as well as prolonged incarceration,\nand yet not curtail the right of the prosecution to forward\nfurther evidence in support of the charges [See also, para 22\nbelow on the power of the police to investigate under Section\n173(8) of the Code.] .\n\n****\n\n25. It is the police report which would enable the\nMagistrate to decide a course of action from the options\navailable to him. The details of the offence and\ninvestigation are not supposed to be a\ncomprehensive thesis of the prosecution case, but\nat the same time, must reflect a thorough\ninvestigation into the alleged offence. It is on the\nbasis of this record that the court can take effective\ncognizance of the offence and proceed to issue\nprocess in terms of Section 190(1)(b) and Section\n204 of the Code. In case of doubt or debate, or if no\noffence is made out, it is open to the Magistrate to\nexercise other options which are available to him.\n\n****\n\n29. The final report has to be prepared with these aspects\nin mind and should show with sufficient particularity and\nclarity, the contravention of the law which is alleged. When\nthe report complies with the said requirements, the court\nconcerned should apply its mind whether or not to take\ncognizance and also proceed by issuing summons to the\naccused. While doing so, the court will take into account\nthe statement of witnesses recorded under Section 161 of\nthe Code and the documents placed on record by the\ninvestigating officer.\n\n30. In case of any doubts or ambiguity arising in\nascertaining the facts and evidence, the Magistrate can,\nbefore taking cognizance, call upon the investigating\nofficer to clarify and give better particulars, order further\ninvestigation, or even record statements in terms of\nSection 202 of the Code.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n79.\nIn\nCentral Bureau of Investigation v. R.S. Pai,68\nthe\n\nquestion that arose before a Bench of three Hon'ble Judges was whether the\n\nprosecution can produce additional documents which are gathered during\n\ninvestigation, after submitting the charge-sheet under\nSection 173\nof the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973. At para 7, it was answered as follows;\n\n\"7. From the aforesaid sub-sections, it is apparent that\nnormally, the investigating officer is required to produce all\nthe relevant documents at the time of submitting the\nchargesheet. At the same time, as there is no specific\nprohibition, it cannot be held that the additional documents\ncannot be produced subsequently. If some mistake is\ncommitted in not producing the relevant documents at the\ntime of submitting the report or the charge-sheet, it is\nalways open to the investigating officer to produce the same\nwith the permission of the court. In our view,\nconsidering the preliminary stage of prosecution\nand the context in which the police officer is\nrequired to forward to the Magistrate all the\ndocuments or the relevant extracts thereof on\nwhich the prosecution proposes to rely, the word\n\"shall\" used in sub-section (5) cannot be\ninterpreted as mandatory, but as directory.\nNormally, the documents gathered during the investigation\nupon which the prosecution wants to rely are required to be\nforwarded to the Magistrate, but if there is some omission,\nit would not mean that the remaining documents cannot be\nproduced subsequently. Analogous provision under\nSection\n173(4)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 was\nconsidered by this Court in\nNarayan Rao v. State of A.P.\n\nand it was held that the word \"shall\" occurring in sub-\nsection (4) of Section 173 and sub-section (3) of Section 207-\nA is not mandatory but only directory. Further, the\nscheme of sub-section (8) of Section 173 also makes\nit abundantly clear that even after the charge-sheet\nis submitted, further investigation, if called for, is\n\n68 (2002) 5 SCC 82\nnot precluded. If further investigation is not\nprecluded then there is no question of not\npermitting the prosecution to produce additional\ndocuments which were gathered prior to or\nsubsequent to the investigation. In such cases, there\ncannot be any prejudice to the accused. Hence, the\nimpugned order passed by the Special Court cannot be\nsustained.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n80. A two-Judge Bench in\nSameer Sandhir v. CBI\n69 reiterated the\n\nposition of law\nlaid down in\n\nR.S. Pai\n(supra).\n\n81. In Velinedipurnam (supra), a Division Bench of the then\n\nHon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh, dealt with a reference in context of\n\nSection 173(2) and (5) as to whether filing of incomplete charge-sheet within\n\n60/90 days would enable the accused to seek for his release from custody. It\n\nwas observed as follows;\n\n\"5. If all the necessary details as contemplated under\nS.\n173(2)\n, Cr.P.C. are not disclosed in the police report in the\nfirst instance, but they are furnished at a later date, perhaps\nit is for the Court to consider the probative value of those\ndetails furnished later during the trial of the case, but to say\nthat the police report filed with certain omissions or gaps is\nnot a valid report contemplated under S. 173(2) is reading\nsomething more into the section. Consequently we hold\nthat non-filing of all the enclosures under S. 173(5)\nalong with the report filed under S. 173(2) is not a\nground to release the accused on the premise that\nfull charge-sheet is not filed within the stipulated\ntime.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n82. It is thus clear that, the purpose of the submission of the Police\n\nreport in terms of the precedents referred above i.e., in compliance with Section\n\n69 2025 INSC 776\n193(3) BNSS/\nSection 173(2)\nCr.P.C., is to enable the Magistrate to satisfy\n\nhimself, whether on the basis of the report and the material filed along with the\n\nPolice report, a case for taking cognizance has been made out or not. After\n\napplying his mind to the Police report and the material submitted therewith, if\n\nthe Magistrate is satisfied that cognizance of the offence is required to be taken,\n\nhe shall proceed further in accordance with the\nCr.P.C\n.\n\n83. With regard to the options left to a Magistrate, in case of filing of a\n\nreport by the Investigating Officer, for consideration, a Three Judge Bench of\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Bhagwant Singh (supra) observed that, on filing\n\nsuch report, the Magistrate may do one of the three things i.e.,\n\n(1) he may accept the report, take cognizance of the offence and\n\nissue process or,\n\n(2) he may disagree with the report and drop the proceeding or,\n\n(3) he may direct further investigation under Section 156(3) and\n\nrequire the police to make a further report.\n\nBrief Overview on the Contents of Police Reports\n\n84. As the law laid down by various precedents has been discussed, it\n\nis desirable to look into the Police report filed on 19.07.2025 and the\n\nsupplementary report on 11.08.2025, strictly for the purpose of assessing\n\nwhether the reports filed are in compliance of Section 193(3) BNSS or not.

An Official Memorandum was issued by the office of the Special\n\nJudge dated 23.08.2025, informing the Investigating Officer about the\n\nomissions and 21 defects pointed out by the Office in the police report filed by\n\nhim on 19.07.2025, requiring the Investigating Officer to comply with the same\n\nwithin three days to take up further action in the matter. This Official\n\nMemorandum was shown in the dispatch register as Dis.No.658 dated\n\n23.08.2025. The Investigating Officer received the said Official Memorandum\n\non 25.08.2025. The Investigating Officer filed compliance regarding omissions,\n\nshowing the date as 26.08.2025 with his signature. But as per the endorsement\n\nof the Special Judge directing the Office to 'check and put up' with his initials\n\ndated 01.09.2025, it contains the stamp of the Court dated 01.09.2025. The\n\nsame was recorded with reference to CF-3516 dated 01.09.2025. Along with the\n\nCharge sheet, on 19.07.2025, list of witnesses as L.W.1 to L.W.270 and list of\n\ndocuments Volume No.1 to Volume No.43 and other documentary evidences\nare also filed separately. It contains the initial of the learned Special Judge dated\n\n19.07.2025 along with the Court Stamp with the same date.\n\n89. For the purpose of the present determination, it is apt to extract\n\nparagraphs - 341, 342, 343, 344 of the Police Report dated 19.07.2025\n\n\"341. It is also prayed to permit the submission of\nadditional statements and documents as and when required.\n\n342. It is necessary to state that considering huge\nmagnitude and complexity of the offence having involved\nlarge amounts of money coupled with the non-availability of\nthe absconding accused and deliberate action of transferring\nthe ill-gotten money to several other countries and illegally\nconcealing it in covert financial operations, further\ninvestigation is necessary. Due to the deliberate design\nadopted by the accused to conceal the evidence and abscond\nfrom investigation, the investigation into it the present crime\nneeds to be carried on in the interests of justice. As such,\nfurther investigation in order to elicit the remaining accused\nwho are at large, unearth and attach ill-gotten crime\nproceeds, examine several key witnesses, seize and analyze\ndocuments, discover the role played by the identified as well\nas unidentified accused individuals that have aided in\nmanipulation of the excise policy and were the ultimate\nbeneficiary of crime is necessary and required.\n\n343. It is further prayed that permission may be granted\nfor continuing further investigation in this case against other\naccused arrayed and the role of several other individuals to\ncomplete the investigation. It is further prayed that further\nreports u/s.193(9) BNSS [173(8)\nCrPC\n] will also be filed in\nthis Hon'ble Court.\n\n344. It is therefore, prayed that the Charge sheet be taken on\nfile and issue process against the absconding accused and the\naccused persons be tried and punished in accordance with\nlaw.\"\nSupplementary Police Report dated 11.08.2025\n\n90. Coming to the supplementary charge sheet dated 11.08.2025, the\n\noverleaf contains the final report under Section 193 BNSS in Crime No.21 of\n\n2024 of CID Police Station, Mangalagiri, Guntur District. It is filed against 19\n\npersons including the present respondents/A.31 toA.33. Particulars of Accused\n\npersons are mentioned in a separate sheet for each Accused. The very first\n\nsentence in the Charge Sheet would show that it is filed in addition to the Charge\n\nSheet submitted on 19.07.2025 and in accordance with Section 193(9) BNSS.\n\nThe details of each accused regarding the offences alleged, date of arrest, their\n\ncurrent status, passport number, house address are mentioned.\n\n91. The contents of the supplementary charge sheet dated 11.08.2025\n\nbroadly would show the following:\n\ni. Conspiracy and Crime.\n\nii. Details of financial investigation\n\niii. Details of the technical analysis and forensic analysis\niv. Details of further investigation\n\n92. It is pertinent to extract Paras-197, 198, 199 and 200 of the\n\nsupplementary chargesheet dated 11.08.2025 for the present case;\n\n\"197. It is also prayed to permit the submission of\nadditional statements and documents as and when\nrequired.\n\n198. It is necessary to state that considering huge\nmagnitude and complexity of the offence having involved\nlarge amounts of money coupled with the non-availability of\nthe absconding accused and deliberate action of\ntransferring the ill-gotten money to several other countries\nand illegally concealing it in covert financial operations,\nfurther investigation is necessary. Due to the deliberate\ndesign adopted by the accused to conceal the evidence and\nabscond from investigation, the investigation into it the\npresent crime needs to be carried on in the interests of\njustice. As such, further investigation in order to elicit the\nremaining accused who are at large, unearth and attach ill-\ngotten crime proceeds, examine several key witnesses, seize\nand analyze documents, discover the role played by the\nidentified as well as unidentified accused individuals that\nhave aided in manipulation of the excise policy and were the\nultimate beneficiary of crime is necessary and required.\n\n199. It is further prayed that permission may be granted\nfor continuing further investigation in this case against\nother accused arrayed and the role of several other\nindividuals to complete the investigation. It is further\nprayed that further reports u/s.193(9) BNSS [173(8)\nCrPC\n]\nwill also be filed in this Hon'ble Court.\n\n200. It is therefore, prayed that the Charge sheet be\ntaken on file and issue process against the absconding\naccused and the accused persons be tried and punished in\naccordance with law.\"\n\n93. Along with the Supplementary Charge sheet, Investigating Officer\n\nfiled Memo of evidence received in the Office of the Special Judge on the same\n\ndated i.e. 11.08.2025. It shows L.Ws.20,34,35,76, 243, 246 and 261 were further\n\nexamined.L.W.272 to 292 were the witnesses examined. List of witnesses\n\nexamined under Section 183 BNSS, which is corresponding to\nSection 164\n\nCr.P.C. mentioned as L.Ws.277, 282, 283. List of documents Volume 44 to 57\n\nare placed before the Court along with mediators' report. It is apt to mention\n\nthat the 21 defects pointed out by the Office of the Learned Special Judge in the\n\nsupplementary report are the very same defects pointed out in the Police report\n\nfiled on 19.07.2025.\nBasis for the Impugned Orders\n\n94. The impugned orders were passed placing reliance mainly on the\n\ndecisions rendered in by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nRitu Chhabbaria\n\n(supra),\nDinesh Dalmia\n(supra), Fakhrey Alam (supra), Satender\n\nKumar Antil, this Court in Akula Raviteja (supra), Bombay High Court in\n\nSarath Chandra Vinayak Dongre and others v. State of\n\nMaharashtra, Delhi High Court in\nAvinash Jain\n(supra) and\nChitra\n\nRamkrishna\n(supra) and High Court for the State of Telangana in C.\n\nParthasarathy (supra). Further, the reasons taken into consideration by the\n\nlearned Special Judge in passing impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 can be\n\nclassified as follows;\n\nA. Some Defects not cured: To this, learned Special Judge gave examples\n\nof FSL reports missing, sanctions under the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nnot\n\nfiled, tabular format of proceeds, siphoned amount only small portion traced.\n\nB. Incomplete Investigation as Further Investigation Sought: The\n\nreal legal test for grant of statutory bail is not whether a chargesheet is filed, it\n\nis whether the investigation is complete. Both the preliminary and\n\nsupplementary charge sheets were incomplete because investigation was\n\nadmittedly still pending. The Charge sheet itself says further investigation and\n\nmore accused/evidence to be found. As the investigation is incomplete, the right\n\nto default bail under Section 187(3) BNSS is triggered.\n\nC. Investigation pending qua other Accused: Police were splitting the\n\ncharge sheets for different accused and filing them before completing the full\ninvestigation, which is termed as clever contrivance. Applying the ratio of\nRitu\n\nChhabbaria\n(supra), a charge sheet filed without completing investigation\n\ncannot defeat default bail, a fundamental right under\nArticle 21.\n\nThe decision in\n\nKapil Wadhwan (supra), is not binding precedent since it has not taken note\n\nof\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra).\n\nD. Inability to show custody as cognizance not taken: Since the\n\nchargesheet was incomplete, the court could not take cognizance and therefore\n\ncustody could not be extended using\nSection 309\nCr.P.C. which applies post-\n\ncognizance. No statutory power exists as in other Special Acts to extend remand\n\nbeyond 90 days in this case and therefore, there is no option except to grant\n\nstatutory bail.\n\n95. This Court would now deal with each of these considerations on the\n\ntouchstone of settled criminal jurisprudence as has been discussed in the\n\nprevious portion.\n\nA. Some defects not cured\n\n96. Undisputably, police report, i.e., charge sheet and supplementary\n\ncharge sheet in the present case, were filed within the statutory period of ninety\n\ndays from the date of judicial remand of Respondents/ Accused Nos. 31 to 33.\n\nThe Respondents admittedly filed their default bail petitions only two weeks\n\nafter the submission of these reports. The core issue is that, although the charge\n\nsheets were filed, the Respondents contended that they were \"incomplete\" due\n\nto defects pointed out by the Special Court, and therefore, for the purposes of\n\nSection 187(3)(ii), should be treated as if no charge sheet was filed. The State,\n\non the other hand, argued that once a charge sheet is filed within the statutory\nperiod, the accused's right to default bail automatically ceases. The Learned\n\nSpecial Judge, however, accepted the reasoning advanced by the Accused.\n\n97. Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents/Accused Nos., 31 to\n\n33 in one voice submitted that the very prayer regarding quashment of Official\n\nMemoranda dated 23.08.2025 on the Charge Sheets filed by the Investigating\n\nAgency dated 19.07.2025 and 11.08.2025 is not maintainable since the Official\n\nMemoranda issued to the Investigating Officer is only an administrative act and\n\nnot a judicial order. Learned Senior Counsel for the State would submit that\n\nOfficial Memoranda issued by the Court dated 23.08.2025 are contrary to law\n\nand reflect non-application of mind. The State seeks the quashment of such\n\nMemoranda since they were issued by the Learned Special Judge, which contain\n\nhis signature. Refuting the same, Sri T. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel\n\nsubmits that if such an argument is to be accepted, the State should have\n\nchallenged the Official Memoranda dated 23.08.2025 immediately, but not\n\nafter sufferance of an adverse order from the Court.\n\n98. This Court concurs with the submissions of the Respondents that\n\nthe issuance of Official Memoranda by the Learned Special Judge to\n\nInvestigating Officer for rectifying defects is essentially an administrative act.\n\nThe issuance of such memoranda does not involve hearing the parties or\n\nadjudicating any matter. Although the memoranda bear the signature of the\n\nlearned Special Judge, in practice, it is the Clerk on the Criminal Side, along\n\nwith the Property Clerk, who compiles the original FIR, documents, and any\n\nproperty received, and presents them to Superintendent of the Court. The\n\nSuperintendent verifies the charge sheet and prepares an office note for the\nJudge to take cognizance. If the Superintendent identifies defects, they are\n\npointed out in the office note, which the Judge merely reviews and signs. This\n\nsignature does not convert the memoranda into a judicial order, it only remains\n\nan administrative action signed after verification of office objections, not a\n\ndecision on the judicial side.\n\n99. The defects pointed out by the Court in the Official Memoranda\n\ndated 23.08.2025 formed one of the primary grounds relied upon by the\n\nLearned Special Judge while granting default bail to the Respondents.\n\nConsequently, State has also challenged these very Official Memorandums. This\n\nCourt is of the considered opinion that for a proper and comprehensive\n\nappreciation of the legal issues arising in the present case, it is appropriate to\n\nexamine the contents of the Official Memorandums dated 23.08.2025. As\n\nrightly contended by Sri T. Niranjan Reddy, the Official Memoranda per se,\n\nbeing administrative in nature, are not liable to be quashed and may be referred\n\nto only for contextual understanding of the matter.\n\n100. It is apt to refer the observations made by a two-Judge Bench of\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nSharif Ahmed\n(supra), while dealing with the issue\n\nof the complete charge sheet to the effect that in case of any doubts or ambiguity\n\narising in ascertaining the facts and evidence, the Learned Magistrate can, call\n\nupon the Investigating Officer to clarify and give better particulars, order\n\nfurther investigation, or even record statements in terms of Section 202 of the\n\nCode before taking cognizance. Therefore, it is the bounden duty of the\n\nInvestigating Officer to make clear and complete entries of all columns in the\n\nChargesheet so that the Court can clearly understand which crime has been\ncommitted by which accused and what is the material evidence available on the\n\nfile. Now let us examine, the defects pointed by the Learned Special Judge and\n\nrectification of such defects by the Investigating Officer. For this Purpose,\n\nAnnexure-II enclosed to the Written Arguments submitted by the Petitioner/\n\nState, is extracted as under:\n\nDefect Response\nAccused copies of charge The proviso to S.193(8) BNSS permits the\n1 sheet along with investigating agency to submit copies of the\ndocuments for all the police report along with other documents\naccused who are arrayed duly indexed to the Magistrate for supply to\nas accused in the charge the accused as required/S.230 through\nsheet to be filed. electronic communication.

A careful perusal of the impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 reveal\n\nthat the Learned Special Judge noted that, although copies of the charge sheet\n\nand the list of documents were filed through electronic means, several\n\nsignificant objections remained unrectified. These included the non-filing of the\n\nFSL report, the absence of sanction orders required to prosecute public\n\nservants, lack of detailed particulars showing the extent of misappropriation or\n\nsiphoning of crime proceeds by each accused in a tabular form, and the omission\n\nof details concerning the recovery of such crime proceeds. It is beneficial to\n\nidentify the legality of each of these objections.\n\nI. Non filing of Sanction orders to prosecute the Accused, who\n\nare Public Servants\n\n102. In the case of hand, specifically, with respect to obtaining sanction\n\nunder\nSection 19\nof the PC Act for Accused No. 1, compliance report reflects that\n\na requisition was sent on 18.07.2025, and the sanction order was awaited. It is\n\nimportant to emphasize that it is the statutory duty of the Investigating Officer\n\nto submit all material collected during the course of investigation against a\n\npublic servant to the competent appointing authority while seeking such\nsanction. In the present case, since the police report was filed before the Special\n\nCourt on 19.07.2025, Investigating Officer had appropriately initiated the\n\nprocess by submitting the requisition for sanction a day earlier, on 18.07.2025.\n\nOne of the objections raised by the learned trial Judge for return of the charge\n\nsheet is that the same was filed without obtaining previous sanction under\n\nSection 19\nof the P.C Act for Accused No.1.\n\n103. With regard to the necessity to obtain sanction for filing of charge\n\nsheet, it is essential to refer to the decision of a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nSuresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain\n(supra), wherein it\n\nwas categorically held that the sanction and investigation are on separate\n\nfootings as sanction is an enabling provision to prosecute, which is totally\n\nseparate from the concept of investigation which is concluded by the filing of\n\nthe charge-sheet. Failure of the prosecution in obtaining and filing of the\n\nsanction along with the charge sheet, does not automatically give right to the\n\nAccused to seek statutory bail, when the charge-sheet is filed well within the\n\nperiod contemplated under\nSection 167(2)(a)(ii)\nCrPC.\n\n104. Later, a Two-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in\n\nJudgebir Singh\n(supra) while reaffirming the principles\nlaid down in\n\nSuresh\n\nKumar Bhikamchand Jain\n(supra), categorically held that the issuance of\n\na sanction order to prosecute an accused who is a Government employee is the\n\nexclusive responsibility of competent sanctioning authority, which functions\n\nindependently and is not connected with the investigation process.\n\n105. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nJudgebir Singh\n(supra) further\n\nclarified that any delay in according such sanction does not invalidate or vitiate\nthe final report filed by the Investigating Agency before the Court. It was further\n\nheld that\nSection 173\nCr.P.C. does not make any reference to the filing of a\n\nsanction order, and\nSection 167\nCr.P.C. pertains solely to the investigation\n\nprocess, not to the stage of cognizance by the Magistrate. Therefore, once a final\n\nreport is filed within the prescribed period, signifying completion of\n\ninvestigation, the accused cannot claim a right to default bail merely because\n\nthe sanction order has not yet been filed.\n\n106. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nJudgebir Singh\n(supra) further\n\nclarified that a sanction order issued by the competent authority can be\n\nproduced and placed on record even after the filing of the charge sheet.\n\nHowever, if there is undue delay in producing the sanction order, the accused\n\nmay seek regular bail on the ground of delay in trial but it was categorically held\n\nthat such delay cannot form the basis for claiming default bail under\nSection\n\n167(2)\nCr.P.C.\n\n107. In the instant case, admittedly, the objection raised by the learned\n\nSpecial Judge is with regard to non-filing of sanction for Accused No.1. As was\n\ndiscussed in the precedents referred supra, non-filing of sanction order along\n\nwith the charge sheet, is a curable defect, which can be rectified at the\n\nsubsequent time and the same cannot entitle the Accused to seek default bail\n\nunder\nSection 167(2)\nCr.P.C. Therefore, the argument advanced by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel for Accused No.32 and the objection raised by the learned\n\nSpecial Judge on this aspect, is not tenable.\nII. Charge Sheet filed without FSL Reports\n\n108. Sri Sidharth Luthra, learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on\n\nTara Singh v. State,70\nto buttress his contention that a chargesheet merely\n\nsans FSL report is not incomplete.\n\n109.\nIn\nTara Singh\n(supra), the issue for consideration was whether\n\nthe challan submitted by police could be regarded as complete so as to enable\n\nthe Court to take cognizance under\nSection 190(1)(b)\nof the Cr.P.C. 1898. A four\n\nJudge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the challan\nin that case\n\nwas indeed complete, notwithstanding the absence of the Imperial Serologist's\n\nreport and the sketch map of the scene of occurrence. Referring to\nSection 173(1)\n\nof the Cr.P.C.1898, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that a police report or\n\nchallan is complete, if it sets forth the essential particulars, i.e., the names of the\n\nparties, the nature of the information, and the names of persons acquainted\n\nwith the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, it was held that the cognizance\n\ntaken by the Court on such a report was proper and valid in law.\n\n110. Sri S. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel, contended that the\n\ndecision in\nTara Singh\n(supra) must be distinguished from the present case,\n\nas the FSL reports here pertain to data extracted from mobile phones, whereas\n\nthe report in\nTara Singh\n(supra) was that of a Serologist. He argued that the\n\ninformation emerging from such data could potentially reveal crucial\n\ncircumstances requiring further investigation. This contention, however, is far-\n\n70 1951 Supreme Court Cases 903\nfetched and contingent on uncertain possibilities, and therefore does not\n\nsupport his version at this stage for consideration under Section 187 BNSS.\n\n111. It is necessary to refer to the decision rendered by a Division Bench\n\nof the Composite High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Venkatarayanakota\n\nKrishnappa (supra), which dealt with a reference on the point whether the\n\ncharge sheet which was filed within ninety days, but was returned for\n\ncompliance of certain technical objections of not filing the scientific experts\n\nreport is a proper compliance under\nsection 173\nCr.P.C. and whether the same\n\nconfer any right on the accused to seek bail as a matter of right as required under\n\nSection 167\nCr.P.C. It was observed by the Division Bench that reports which\n\nare pending with the Science Laboratory are not within the control of the\n\nInvestigating Agency and the chargesheet filed therein having satisfied the\n\nrequirements under Section 173(2) is sufficient compliance to extinguish the\n\nindefeasible right of statutory bail. It was also observed that a chargesheet filed\n\ncontaining the particulars mentioned in Section 173 (2) is valid, irrespective of\n\nthe fact that it did not contain some of the documents as required under Section\n\n173 (5) as they can be produced at a later stage by supplying copies to the\n\nAccused, with the permission of the Court.\n\n112. A Coordinate Bench of this Court in\nAnantha Satya Udaya\n\nBhaskara Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh71\n, dealt with a case wherein\n\nthe petitioner sought default bail in a case under\nSections 302\n,\n, and\nof\n\nthe IPC, along with\nSections 3(1)(r)\n,\n3(1)(s)\n, and\n3(2)(v)\nof the Scheduled Castes\n\n71 2022 SCC OnLine AP 2166\nand\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989\n. His plea for default\n\nbail was rejected by trial Court on the ground that the police had filed\n\nchargesheet within the statutory period in compliance with\nSection 173(2)\n\nCr.P.C., and the mere non-filing of the scientific expert's report did not entitle\n\nthe petitioner to default bail under\nSection 167(2)\nCr.P.C. This Court upheld this\n\nview, holding that the charge sheet filed was complete in substance, being\n\nsufficient for the concerned Court to take cognizance of the offences.\n\n113. A learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in\nKamalaksha\n\nv. Sub Inspector of Police and Another,72\nobserved that when a Police\n\nReport or Charge Sheet contains necessary details so as to enable the Magistrate\n\nto take cognizance of the offence and proceed further, it cannot be said that\n\nthere is failure of compliance of\nSection 173(5)\nCr.P.C. just because the scientific\n\nreports have not been produced along with the Charge Sheet filed by the Police\n\nOfficer. It was also observed that the question as to whether the prosecution has\n\nadduced sufficient evidence to establish its case will be a matter to be decided\n\nat the close of the trial and not when cognizance is taken of the offence alleged.\n\n114. It is also essential to refer to the decision of the High Court of Delhi\n\nin Ram Kishore Arora (supra), wherein it was observed that the preparation\n\nof the FSL report lies beyond the control of the investigating agency, even\n\nthough it may take steps to expedite the process. The Court noted that the\n\ninvestigating agency had already submitted the necessary documents to the FSL\n\nfor expert analysis and had categorically stated that the investigation against\n\n72 2006 SCC OnLine Ker 482\nthe petitioner was complete. It was further held that the mere issuance of\n\nsummons to another individual or a request to place additional evidence on\n\nrecord does not, by itself, render the investigation incomplete or entitle the\n\naccused to claim default bail in the absence of any substantial grounds\n\nchallenging the completeness of the investigation.\n\n115. It is also relevant to note that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nHanif\n\nAnsari v. State (NCT of Delhi\n)73, was posed with an issue as to whether a\n\nchargesheet filed without the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report is\n\n\"incomplete,\" thereby entitling an accused to default bail under\nSection 167(2)\n\nCrPC read with\nSection 36A\nof the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n\nAct, 1985.74 In\nHanif Ansari\n(supra), the petitioner was accused of possessing\n\n2 kg of heroin, contended that since the FSL report confirming the substance as\n\nheroin was filed months after the chargesheet, he is entitled to statutory right\n\nto bail. The State opposed this, arguing that a spot test had already identified\n\nthe contraband and that validity of the chargesheet was unaffected by absence\n\nof the FSL report. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 19.03.2024\n\nnoted the divergent judicial opinions on this issue, wherein some benches\n\nholding that the FSL report is essential to complete a chargesheet, others ruling\n\nit is not.\nReferring to Kapil Wadhawan (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nemphasized that the non-filing of all documents does not automatically vitiate\n\na chargesheet or create a right to default bail, but since the question remains\n\nlegally unsettled.\nIn that light, the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed that the case\n\n73 2024 SCC OnLine SC 537\n74 For short,\nNDPS Act\nbe placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for tagging with the lead\n\nmatter i.e.,\nDirectorate of Enforcement v. Manpreet Singh Talwar\n\n(SLP (Crl\n.) No. 5724/2023), which is pending before a larger Bench, for an\n\nauthoritative decision on whether omission of the FSL report pertaining to the\n\nseized contraband article(s) along with the chargesheet, within the time\n\nspecified in Section 167(2) of the Code read with\nSection 36A\nof the NDPS Act,\n\nwould entitle the accused to default bail or not.\n\n116. In the instant case, while complying with the defect regarding the\n\nFSL reports, total forty-seven(47) FSL reports which were annexed with the\n\nfinal report dated 19.07.2025 were already filed and seizures which were also\n\ncarried out after 19.07.2025 were also mentioned in the supplementary charge\n\nsheet dated 11.08.2025.\nIn such circumstances, contention of the learned Senior\n\nCounsel for Accused No.33 that filing of FSL report along with charge sheet is\n\nmandatory for compliance of Section 193 (3) BNSS (corresponding to\nSection\n\n173(2)\nCr.P.C), is not sustainable since the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nTara Singh\n(supra) (Four-Judges Bench) holds the field as on today.\n\nTherefore, on the strength of the authorities presently subsisting in\nTara\n\nSingh\n(supra), Venkatarayanakota Krishnappa (supra),\nKamalaksha\n\n(supra),\nAnantha Satya Udaya Bhaskara Rao\n(supra) and Ram\n\nKishore Arora (supra), this Court is unable to reach a finding that the\n\nchargesheet sans FSL Report makes it incomplete. Therefore, such a ground\n\ncannot be one of the reasons for grant of default bail terming the police report\n\nas \"incomplete\".\nIII. Details of Misappropriated funds\n\n117. Further, the learned Special Judge's reliance on the \"details of\n\nmisappropriation of siphoning of crime proceeds by each accused in a tabular\n\nform\", \"recovery of the proceeds of the crime\" or \"untraced siphoned money\" to\n\nconclude that investigation was incomplete is unsustainable in the view of this\n\nCourt, because recovery is an evidentiary matter that belongs exclusively to the\n\ndomain of trial and has no bearing on default bail under Section 187(3) BNSS.\n\nNon-recovery may perhaps impact proof at trial as it is an aspect concerning the\n\nmerit of the allegations, but it cannot revive or create a right to default bail.\n\nB. Incomplete Investigation as Further Investigation Sought\n\n118. The Learned Judge observed that in the Memo filed before the\n\nCourt, the Investigating Officer sought extension of remand on the ground that\n\ninvestigation is pending and in the Charge sheet also it is mentioned that further\n\ninvestigation is pending against other Accused and also the present Accused.\n\n119. On this point, it is the contention of Sri S.Niranjan Reddy, learned\n\nSenior Counsel for Accused No.31 that the Investigating Officer has to obtain\n\nprior permission of the Court for conducting further investigation. Sri\n\nSiddhartha Dave, learned Senior Counsel for Accused No.32 also contended\n\nthat a formal permission of the Court is required to be obtained by the Police\n\nbefore conducting further investigation. However, it is the contention of Sri\n\nSiddharth Luthra, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner / State, there is no\n\nmention in\nSection 173(8)\nCr.P.C about the permission to be taken from the\n\nCourt for conducting further investigation and so far as Section 193 (9) is\nconcerned, the Investigating Agency is not required to take permission of the\n\nCourt for carrying out further investigation as long as the trial has not\n\ncommenced and that as a courtesy, it was informed to Special Judge about the\n\npendency of further investigation.\n\n120. Under the Code of 1898, there was no express provision enabling\n\nthe Police to make further investigation after a final report under Sec.173(1) had\n\nbeen submitted. Though a report under Sec.173 (2) can be submitted only after\n\ncompletion of the investigation, new sub-Section (8) to Sec.173 enabled the\n\nPolice to carry on further investigation, as recommended by the Law\n\nCommission, on the ground that it would be unfair both to the prosecution or\n\nto the accused if the investigating officer, after submitting his report under\n\nSec.173 (2), comes upon evidence bearing on the guilt or innocence of the\n\naccused and that is shut out from the Court.\n\n121.\nIn\nVinay Tyagi\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncontext of Section 173 (8) observed as follows;\n\n\"49. Now, we may examine another significant aspect which\nis how the provisions of Section 173(8) have been\nunderstood and applied by the courts and investigating\nagencies. It is true that though there is no specific\nrequirement in the provisions of Section 173(8) of\nthe Code to conduct \"further investigation\" or file\nsupplementary report with the leave of the court,\nthe investigating agencies have not only understood\nbut also adopted it as a legal practice to seek\npermission of the courts to conduct \"further\ninvestigation\" and file \"supplementary report\"\nwith the leave of the court. The courts, in some of the\ndecisions, have also taken a similar view. The requirement\nof seeking prior leave of the court to conduct \"further\ninvestigation\" and/or to file a \"supplementary report\" will\nhave to be read into, and is a necessary implication of the\nprovisions of Section 173(8) of the Code. The doctrine of\ncontemporanea expositio will fully come to the aid of such\ninterpretation as the matters which are understood and\nimplemented for a long time, and such practice that is\nsupported by law should be accepted as part of the\ninterpretative process.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n122.\nIn\nDharam Pal v. State of Haryana,75\nthe Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt provided that the permission of the Magistrate under Section 173 (8) is\n\nthough not specifically provided, but is in practice followed. Relevant extract\n\nreads thus;\n\n\"21. In this context, we may notice the statutory scheme\npertaining to investigation.\nSection 173\nCrPC empowers the\npolice officer conducting investigation to file a report on\ncompletion of the investigation with the Magistrate\nempowered to take cognizance of the offence.\nSection 173(8)\n\nCrPC empowers the officer-in-charge to conduct further\ninvestigation even after filing of a report under\nSection\n173(2)\nCrPC if he obtains further evidence, oral or\ndocumentary. Thus, the power of the police officer under\n\nSection 173(8)\nCrPC is unrestricted. Needless to say, the\nMagistrate has no power to interfere but it would be\nappropriate on the part of the investigating officer\n\n75 (2016) 4 SCC 160\nto inform the Court. It has been so stated in\nRama\nChaudhary v. State of Bihar\n.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n123. The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nHasanbhai\n\nValibhai Qureshi v. State of Gujarat,76\nwhich is relied on by the High\n\nCourt of Delhi in\nJava Singh\n(supra), categorically held that further\n\ninvestigation is permissible, however, reinvestigation is prohibited. The law\n\ndoes not mandate taking of prior permission from the Magistrate for further\n\ninvestigation. Carrying out a further investigation even after filing of the charge-\n\nsheet is a statutory right of the police. It was further held that even after\n\nsubmission of police report under Section 173 (2) on completion of\n\ninvestigation, the police has a right to \"further\" investigation under Section\n\n173(8) but not \"fresh investigation\" or \"reinvestigation\". The meaning of\n\n\"Further\" is additional; more; or supplemental. \"Further\" investigation,\n\ntherefore, is the continuation of the earlier investigation and not a fresh\n\ninvestigation or reinvestigation to be started ab initio wiping out the earlier\n\ninvestigation altogether.\n\n124. At this juncture, it is useful to refer to the decision rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nDinesh Dalmia\n(supra), wherein the chargesheet\n\nhas mentioned that further investigation would be necessary on certain vital\n\npoints including \"end use of funds\".\n\nRelying on the decision of the Constitution\n\nBench in\nK. Veeraswami\n(supra), it was observed thus;\n\n76 (2004) 5 SCC 347\n\"20. Indisputably, the power of the investigating\nofficer to make a prayer for making further\ninvestigation in terms of sub-section (8) of Section\n173 is not taken away only because a charge-sheet\nunder sub-section (2) thereof has been filed. A\nfurther investigation is permissible even if order of\ncognizance of offence has been taken by the\nMagistrate.\n\n***\n\n24. Concededly, the investigating agency is required to\ncomplete investigation within a reasonable time. The ideal\nperiod therefor would be 24 hours, but, in some cases, it\nmay not be practically possible to do so. Parliament,\ntherefore, thought it fit that remand of the accused can be\nsought for in the event investigation is not completed within\n60 or 90 days, as the case may be. But, if the same is not\ndone within the stipulated period, the same would not be\ndetrimental to the accused and, thus, he, on the expiry\nthereof would be entitled to apply for bail, subject to\nfulfilling the conditions prescribed therefor.\n\n25. Such a right of bail although is a valuable right but the\nsame is a conditional one; the condition precedent being\npendency of the investigation. Whether an investigation\nin fact has remained pending and the investigating\nofficer has submitted the charge-sheet only with a\nview to curtail the right of the accused would\nessentially be a question of fact. Such a question\nstrictly does not arise in this case inasmuch as, according to\nCBI, sufficient materials are already available for\nprosecution of the appellant. According to it, further\ninvestigation would be inter alia necessary on certain vital\npoints including end use of the funds.\n\n***\n\n39. The statutory scheme does not lead to a conclusion in\nregard to an investigation leading to filing of final form\nunder sub-section (2) of Section 173 and further\ninvestigation contemplated under sub-section (8) thereof.\nWhereas only when a charge-sheet is not filed and\ninvestigation is kept pending, benefit of proviso\nappended to sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the\nCode would be available to an offender; once,\nhowever, a charge-sheet is filed, the said right\nceases. Such a right does not revive only because a\nfurther investigation remains pending within the\nmeaning of sub-section (8) of Section 173 of the\nCode.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n125. As already discussed, Sec.193 BNSS corresponds to\nSec.173\n\nCr.P.C.1973 with some additions. Under Sec.173 (8), the Investigating officer\n\nwould be competent to examine such further evidence and send a\n\nsupplementary report to the Magistrate, complying with the requirements of\n\nSec.173 (2) to (6). \"Fresh\" investigation or \"re-investigation\" is not\n\ncontemplated by Sec.173 (8), as rightly pointed by the learned Counsel for the\n\nAccused. What Sec.173 (8) provides for is further investigation by the same\n\nagency. For holding fresh investigation or reinvestigation, fresh permission of\n\nthe Magistrate is required. Moreover, it is also settled that further investigation\n\nis to be undertaken from the same offence, not into further investigation in the\n\nseparate offence.\n\n126. Section 193(9) of BNSS is a corresponding version of\nSection 173\n\n(8)\nof Cr.P.C., but with a newly added proviso that stipulates that the further\n\ninvestigation during the trial may be conducted with the permission of the Court\n\ntrying the case and it shall be completed within a period of 90 days, extendable\n\nwith the permission of the Court. However, there is no mention about seeking\n\nof such permission at the pre-trial stage. Recently, in\nYash Mishra v. State\n\nof NCT of Delhi and Others,77\na Division Bench of the Delhi High Court\n\n77 2025 SCC OnLine Del 5684\ndeclined to rule Section 193 (9) read with Section 187 (3) as arbitrary and ultra\n\nvires. In this light, the following observation was made;\n\n\"14. So far as the submission that provision of 'further\ninvestigation' as contained in Section 193(9) is camouflage\nto defeat the right of the accused person to seek 'default bail'\nunder Section 187(3) of BNSS 2023, we may only\nobserve that the provision contained in Section\n193(9) and those of Section 187(3), operate in\ndifferent fields and further that Section 193(9) does\nnot in any manner acts as a camouflage to such\nright.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n127. So far as the instant case concerns, admittedly trial has not been\n\ncommenced. In the charge sheet itself at para 343 of the police report dated\n\n19.07.2025 and para 199 of the supplementary report dated 11.08.2025 are clear\n\nto that effect, that permission is sought to conduct further investigation and file\n\nadditional material, if any, found during investigation. Thus, in view of the\n\njudgments referred to supra, terming the chargesheet as incomplete on the\n\nground that further investigation was sought cannot be countenanced.\n\nC. Investigation pending qua other Accused:\n\n128. At cost of repetition, in this case, final report and supplementary\n\ncharge sheet have been originally filed within a period of 90 days. After two\n\nweeks of filing such charge sheets, Accused Nos.31 to 33 filed petitions before\n\nSpecial Court seeking default bail. The learned counsel for respondents argued\n\nin one voice that the charge sheet is incomplete since investigation is pending\nagainst the other Accused. It is the contention of learned Senior Counsel\n\nrepresenting Accused Nos.,31 to 33 that splitting up of charge sheets and filing\n\nof piece-meal charge sheets is only for the purpose of scuttling the right of the\n\nAccused to be released on default bail. It is a settled principle of law that filing\n\nof piecemeal and incomplete charge sheets cannot be considered as final report\n\nas they are impermissible. Per contra, it is the contention of the learned Senior\n\nCounsel for State that merely because the remand extension memos filed after\n\nfiling of the charge sheet contained the grounds pertaining to further\n\ninvestigation on certain aspects related to the larger conspiracy, it does not\n\nindicate that the investigation against Accused Nos.,31 to 33 is still pending or\n\nthat the charge sheet is incomplete.\n\n129. On this point, it is essential to refer to the decision rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Kapil Wadhawan (supra), wherein the question\n\nfor consideration was whether the respondents were entitled to the benefit of\n\nthe statutory bail under the proviso to\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC, on the ground that\n\nthe investigation qua some of the accused named in the FIR was pending,\n\nthough the charge-sheet against the respondents along with the other accused\n\nwas filed within the prescribed time-limit and though the cognizance of the\n\noffence was taken by the special court before the consideration default bail.\n\n130. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kapil Wadhawan (supra), while\n\nreiterating the settled legal position that the right of default bail under Section\n\n167 (2) is not only a statutory right but a right flowing from\nArticle 21\n, had\n\nreferred to the decision of the Constitution Bench in\nSanjay Dutt\n(supra), to\n\nemphasise that the custody of the accused after the challan has been filed is not\ngoverned by Section 167 but different provisions of the\nCr.P.C\n. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court further noted that there remains no doubt that if the statutory\n\nrequirements under Section 173 (2) stand complied, when the particulars\n\nindicated therein are included in the reported. At para 23, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt answered the question of law as follows;\n\n\"23. The benefit of proviso appended to sub-section (2) of\nSection 167 of the Code would be available to the offender only\nwhen a charge-sheet is not filed and the investigation is kept\npending against him. Once however, a charge-sheet is filed, the\nsaid right ceases. It may be noted that the right of the\ninvestigating officer to pray for further investigation in terms of\nsub-section (8) of Section 173 is not taken away only because a\ncharge-sheet is filed under sub-section (2) thereof against the\naccused. Though ordinarily all documents relied upon by the\nprosecution should accompany the charge-sheet, nonetheless for\nsome reasons, if all the documents are not filed along with the\ncharge-sheet, that reason by itself would not invalidate or vitiate\nthe charge-sheet. It is also well settled that the court takes\ncognizance of the offence and not the offender. Once from the\nmaterial produced along with the charge-sheet, the\ncourt is satisfied about the commission of an offence\nand takes cognizance of the offence allegedly committed\nby the accused, it is immaterial whether the further\ninvestigation in terms of Section 173(8) is pending or\nnot. The pendency of the further investigation qua the\nother accused or for production of some documents not\navailable at the time of filing of charge-sheet would\nneither vitiate the charge-sheet, nor would it entitle the\naccused to claim right to get default bail on the ground\nthat the charge-sheet was an incomplete charge-sheet\nor that the charge-sheet was not filed in terms of\nSection\n173(2)\nCrPC.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n131.\nIn\nDablu Kujur\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court having\n\nexamined the importance of a complete police report under\nSection 173(2)\nof\n\nthe CrPC, emphasized that the investigating officer must strictly comply with\n\nthe statutory requirements while submitting a chargesheet.\nThe decision in\n\nKapil Wadhawan (supra) was reiterated in the following manner;\n\n\"18. Such issues often arise when the accused would\nmake his claim for default bail under\nSection\n167(2)\nCrPC and contend that all the documents\nhaving not been submitted as required under Section\n173(5), or the investigation qua some of the persons\nhaving been kept open while submitting police report\nunder Section 173(2), the requirements under\nSection 173(2) could not be said to have been\ncomplied with.\nIn this regard, this Court recently held\nin\nCBI v. Kapil Wadhawan [CBI\nv. Kapil Wadhawan, (2024) 3\nSCC 734 : (2024) 2 SCC (Cri) 300] that : (SCC p. 748, para 23)\n\"23. ... Once from the material produced along\nwith the charge-sheet, the court is satisfied about the\ncommission of an offence and takes cognizance of the\noffence allegedly committed by the accused, it is\nimmaterial whether the further investigation in terms\nof Section 173(8) is pending or not. The pendency\nof the further investigation qua the other\naccused or for production of some documents\nnot available at the time of filing of charge-\nsheet would neither vitiate the charge-sheet,\nnor would it entitle the accused to claim right\nto get default bail on the ground that the\ncharge-sheet was an incomplete charge-sheet\nor that the charge-sheet was not filed in terms\nof\nSection 173(2)\nCrPC.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n132. Sri S.Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nrespondents would submit that the purported charge sheets filed by the\nInvestigating Officer are not in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Police\n\nManual. Learned Senior Counsel brought to the notice of this Court that Form-\n\n69 of A.P. Police Rules, Column-12, which stipulates mentioning \"particulars of\n\naccused persons not charge sheeted\". Moreover, Section 193(3) BNSS stipulates\n\n\"a report in the form as the State Government may, by rules provide\". Learned\n\nSenior Counsel also made special emphasis on Paragraphs 478(9), 478(10),\n\n479(5), 479(6) of Andhra Pradesh Police Manual. Sri Sidharth Luthra,\n\nvehemently opposed this argument and submitted that the Investigating Officer\n\nfollowed the Manual and Charge sheets were filed as per Rule 480-1, in Form-\n\n69 by mentioning all the details required to the Court to proceed for inquiry.\n\n133. A bare perusal of the impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 would\n\nreveal that the learned Special Judge had placed heavy reliance on the decision\n\nrendered in\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra) and considered\nKapil Wadhawan\n\n(supra) as not binding as the latter did not take note of the former.\n\nFactual\n\nposition in\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra) was that FIR was initially registered for\n\noffences under IPC and the PC Act, without naming the petitioner's husband.\n\nSubsequent supplementary charge-sheets were filed, one of which showed him\n\nas a prosecution witness, and later ones did not name him at all. After the\n\ninvestigation was transferred, he was arrested by the CBI on 28.4.2022, and\n\nfurther supplementary charge-sheets described him as a suspect, leading to\n\nrepeated extensions of his remand under\nSection 309(2)\nCrPC without granting\n\ndefault bail. The writ petition ultimately challenged the continued custody and\n\nalleged that the repeated filing of supplementary charge-sheets was a deliberate\n\nattempt to deny the accused his statutory right to default bail. In this context,\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court held that first investigation is to be completed, and\n\nonly then can a chargesheet be filed within the stipulated period, and failure to\n\ndo so would trigger the statutory right of default bail under\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC.\n\nRelevant portion is as follows;\n\n\"25. This right of statutory bail, however, is extinguished, if\nthe charge-sheet is filed within the stipulated period. The\nquestion of resorting to a supplementary charge-sheet under\n\nSection 173(8)\nCrPC only arises after the main charge-sheet has\nbeen filed, and as such, a supplementary charge-sheet,\nwherein it is explicitly stated that the investigation is still\npending, cannot under any circumstance, be used to scuttle the\nright of default bail, for then, the entire purpose of default bail\nis defeated, and the filing of a charge-sheet or a supplementary\ncharge-sheet becomes a mere formality, and a tool, to ensue\nthat the right of default bail is scuttled.\"\n\n134. It is indeed true that the review preferred by the CBI on the\n\ndecision in\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra) was dismissed, vide order dated\n\n31.07.2025 in R.P. (Crl.) No.124/2025.\n\nIt is brought to the notice of this Court\n\nby learned Senior Counsel Sri Sidharth Luthra that a three-Judge Bench of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nManpreet Singh Talwar\n(supra), had expressly\n\nclarified that trial courts and High Courts must consider applications for default\n\nbail independent of and without relying on\nRitu Chhabbaria\n(supra) in\n\nfollowing terms;\n\n\"\"In continuation of the interim order of this Court dated 1\nMay 2023, we clarify that the order shall not preclude any\ntrial court or, as the case may be, High Court from\nconsidering an application for the grant of default bail under\n\nSection 167\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973\nindependent of and without relying on the judgment dated\n26 April 2023 in Writ Petition (Criminal) No 60 of 2023.\"\n135. Learned Senior Counsel for Accused No.33, during the course of\n\narguments, fairly conceded that, in the light of the interim order passed by the\n\nthree Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is in force, they are not\n\nrelying on\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra).\n\nLearned Senior Counsel for Accused\n\nNo.31 would submit that, even in absence of\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra),\n\nAccused No.31 got a good case to succeed in the light of settled principles of law\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\nLearned Special Judge went on discussing the\n\njudgment in\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra), and held that\nthe said judgment\nholds\n\nthe field and is binding.\n\nIn the light of the submissions referred to supra, this\n\nCourt is of the humble view that, as on the date of passing the impugned order,\n\nthe interim order passed by the three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nManpreet Singh Talwar\n(supra) was in force.\n\nIt is also pertinent\n\nto mention that Hon'ble Supreme Court directed the Registry to list the batch\n\nof matters on the same issue regarding the\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra), before\n\nthe Three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n136.\nIn addition to relying on\nRitu Chhabaria\n(supra), the impugned\n\norder is also based on the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nFakhrey Alam (supra), this Court in Akula Ravi Teja (supra) and the Delhi\n\nHigh Court in\nAvinash Jain\n(supra) and\nChitra Ramkrishna\n(supra).\n\nThese decisions along with Tunde Gbaja (supra), were relied on by the\n\nlearned counsel for the Accused also, to submit that statutory bail was granted\n\nfinding the chargesheets to be incomplete.\n137. The reliance on Fakhrey Alam(supra) is misplaced as it pertains\n\nto filing of chargesheet is filed after the filing of default bail application, after\n\nexpiry of statutory period.\n\n138. Coming to Akula Ravi Teja (supra), against the petitioner/\n\nAccused No.3 therein a case was registered under Sections 143, 148, 188, 269,\n\n324, 307 and 302 read with\nSection 149\nIPC, and he was remanded to judicial\n\ncustody on 05.06.2020. The police filed a preliminary charge sheet in Crime\n\nNo.453 of 2020 on 28.08.2020. The Learned Magistrate returned the same with\n\ncertain objections. Meanwhile, the petitioner filed a petition seeking default bail\n\non the ground that the police failed to complete the investigation within the\n\nstatutory period of ninety days. The Learned Magistrate dismissed the petition\n\non the ground that the charge sheet had been filed within time and that it had\n\nonly been returned for compliance with some objections. Aggrieved thereby, the\n\npetitioner approached the High Court. It was contended on behalf of the State\n\nthat the Investigating Officer could not examine some witnesses because they\n\nwere in judicial custody, and some crucial witnesses in the counter case were\n\nabsconding; hence, there was no lapse on the part of the Investigating Officer.\n\nWhile dealing with the plea for default bail, Learned Single Judge categorically\n\nheld that there was no legal flaw in the Magistrate's finding and held that if a\n\ncharge sheet is filed within the statutory period, the fact that it is returned for\n\ncompliance with technical objections does not confer a right on the accused to\n\nclaim default bail.\n\n139. Thereafter, Learned Single Judge in Akula Ravi Teja (supra), at\n\npara 15, referred to the judgment of the Division Bench of the composite High\nCourt of Andhra Pradesh in Venkatarayanakota Krishnappa (supra), and\n\nheld that the Magistrate's finding could not be considered erroneous. With\n\nrespect to the second ground, the Learned Single Judge noted that in that case,\n\nthe charge sheet filed was admittedly only a preliminary charge sheet, which\n\nitself indicated that it was not possible for the Investigating Officer to specify\n\nthe overt acts of each accused until recording the statements of twenty two (22)\n\ncrucial witnesses who were lodged as remand prisoners in the Central Prison,\n\nRajahmundry, in a counter case, as well as eight other crucial witnesses who\n\nwere absconding. Thus, the contents of the charge sheet clearly indicated that\n\nthe investigation had not been completed and that the charge sheet was only\n\npreliminary. In that context, the Court held that mere filing of a preliminary\n\ncharge sheet without completing the investigation would not defeat the\n\nindefeasible statutory right of an accused to claim default bail.\n\n140.\nIn\nChitra Ramkrishna\n(supra), it was held that a chargesheet\n\ncan be filed only after the entire investigation covering \"all\" offences in the FIR\n\nis completed. Filing an incomplete or \"piece-meal\" chargesheet for only some\n\noffences while leaving the others under investigation violates Section 167(2),\n\nsince it allows the investigating agency to improperly extend the accused's\n\ncustody.\n\n141. Similarly, in\nAvinash Jain\n(supra), a learned Single Judge,\n\ngranted default bail to the applicant after finding that the CBI had filed an\n\nincomplete and piecemeal chargesheet that did not cover all offences mentioned\n\nin the FIR, particularly the offences under the\nPC Act\nfor which investigation\n\nwas still pending and sanction under\nSection 17A\nwas yet to be obtained. The\nHigh Court held that a chargesheet under\nSection 173(2)\nCrPC must reflect\n\ncompletion of the entire investigation for all offences, and filing a partial report\n\nsolely to defeat the accused's statutory right under Section 167(2) is\n\nimpermissible and violates\nArticle 21.\nSince the investigation into\nPC Act\n\noffences remained open on the expiry of 60 days from arrest, the chargesheet\n\nwas not held to be a valid final report.\n\n142. In Tunde Gbaja (supra), the Delhi High Court dealt with a\n\nsituation where the FIR contained several\nIPC\noffences requiring a 90-day\n\ninvestigation period, but the police filed a chargesheet only under\nSection 14\nof\n\nthe Foreigners Act, which carried a 60-day limit. Although the agency could\n\nlater file a supplementary chargesheet under\nSection 173(8)\nCrPC, the learned\n\nSingle Judge held that an incomplete or part chargesheet cannot defeat an\n\naccused's right to default bail. Since the chargesheet did not cover the\nIPC\n\noffences listed in the FIR, the filing could not be treated as a valid chargesheet\n\nfor purposes of Section 167(2), the accused was held entitled to default bail.\n\n143. Turning to the present case, the State contends that the charge\n\nsheet filed on 19.07.2025 is a complete charge sheet covering all offences. The\n\nState further asserts that the charge sheet filed on 11.08.2025 against A.31 to\n\nA.33 is also complete in all respects and in accordance with Section 193(3) of\n\nthe BNSS. It is also submitted that there is no bar to filing further reports as per\n\nSection 193(9) BNSS by following the procedure prescribed under sub-sections\n\n(3) to (8) of Section 193. A cursory examination of the charge sheets filed in the\n\npresent case in the previous portion, prima facie supports this version. Viewed\n\nthus, the above referred decisions are distinguishable on facts to the present\ncase. In the case on hand, admittedly, chargesheet has not been filed against the\n\nremaining Accused. However, pendency of the further investigation against the\n\nother accused or for production of some more documents which were not\n\navailable at the time of filing of chargesheet would neither vitiate the\n\nchargesheet filed against the present Accused, nor would it entitle them to be\n\nreleased on default bail on the ground that the chargesheet was an incomplete\n\nchargesheet for the purposes of Section 187 (3).\n\n144. Sri T.Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel had placed reliance\n\non\nT.V. Sharma\n(supra) and Bandi Kotaiah (supra), both of which are also\n\ndistinguishable from the facts of the present case.\n\n145.\nIn\nT.V. Sharma\n(supra), Accused Nos.1 to 4 faced charges under\n\nSections 302 and 201 read with 34\nIPC\n. They remained in judicial custody from\n\n05.03.1975 to 03.05.1975, which is 60 days in total. As under the proviso to\n\nSection 167(2)\nCr.P.C., the accused were entitled to be released after sixty days\n\nif they were prepared to furnish bail, the Learned Magistrate released them on\n\nbail on 03.05.1975. Aggrieved, the State and the deceased's father approached\n\nthe High Court seeking cancellation of the said bail order. The Magistrate had\n\nopined that the preliminary charge sheet filed by the police was merely a\n\nremand report aimed at securing further remand under\nSection 309\nCr.P.C. and\n\nthat\nSection 309\nCr.P.C. applies only after cognizance is taken, and not at the\n\ninvestigation stage. The Learned Single Judge upheld this reasoning, holding\n\nthat a preliminary charge sheet is not a 'police report' under\nSection 173(2)\n\nCr.P.C. and that cognizance could not be taken on such a report.\nThe Court\n\nrelied on the Division Bench judgment in Bandi Kotaiah (supra), which\nconcerned Section 207(A) of the old\nCr.P.C\n. 1898. The Learned Single Judge\n\nfurther noted the significant distinction between\nSection 344\nCr.P.C. 1898 and\n\nSection 309\nCr.P.C. 1973. Ultimately, the petitions were dismissed, and the\n\nMagistrate's grant of statutory bail was confirmed. As to the present case, the\n\nState contends that all objections raised by the office of the Learned Special\n\nJudge on 26.08.2025 (recorded on CFR on 01.09.2025) have been duly\n\ncomplied with. In light of Velidipuram (supra), delivered by the Division\n\nBench of the then composite High Court, such compliance relates back to the\n\ndate of filing of the charge sheet. In the present case, the charge sheet was filed\n\nwithin the statutory period.\nMoreover, the case is distinguishable from\nT.V.\n\nSharma\n, (supra) where the so-called charge sheet which was merely a \"remand\n\nreport\".\n\n146. In Bandi Kotaiah (supra), the Hon'ble Division Bench of the\n\nthen Composite High Court considered the procedure under\nSection 207(A)\n\nCr.P.C. 1898 governing enquiries in cases triable by a Sessions Court on a police\n\nreport. Under that regime, the Magistrate recorded the testimony of witnesses\n\nduring the enquiry, allowed cross-examination by the accused, and, depending\n\non the evidence, either discharged the accused or committed the case to the\n\nSessions Court. In that case, the Police had filed a preliminary charge sheet\n\nstating that the final charge sheet with complete witness lists would be filed\n\nlater. The Magistrate numbered the case (PRC No.1/1964), remanded the\n\naccused, and adjourned the matter periodically for completion of the\n\ninvestigation. The final charge sheet was later filed only against A.1 to A.15. The\n\nchallenge by a prosecution witness (Bandi Kotaiah) was that the Magistrate had\nacted illegally by not proceeding against A.16 to A.18.\nThe Division Bench,\n\nrelying on\nR.R. Chari v. State of U.P.78\n, held that mere numbering of a\n\npreliminary charge sheet and remanding the accused for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating investigation does not amount to taking cognizance. Cognizance is\n\ntaken only upon filing of the final report under\nSection 173\nCr.P.C. Accordingly,\n\nthe reference was answered holding that cognizance had been taken only after\n\nthe filing of the final report.\nNeedless to say, Bandi Kotaiah (supra) renders\n\nno assistance to the respondents herein. The reason is that the procedure under\n\nthe\nCr.P.C\n. 1898 was entirely different. Under that regime, Police commonly\n\nfiled a preliminary report within 15 days, and Magistrates frequently extended\n\nremand to facilitate completion of investigation. There was no clear provision\n\nregarding release of the accused if the charge sheet was not filed within fifteen\n\ndays. The issue in Bandi Kotaiah (supra) concerned the stage of cognizance,\n\nnot the grant of default bail. In contrast,\nSection 167\nof Cr.P.C. 1973 explicitly\n\nconfers an indefeasible right to default bail if the police fail to file the report\n\nwithin the statutory period. This distinction is fundamental.\n\n147. Further, an interesting argument has been taken by Sri Siddharth\n\nDave, learned Senior Counsel for Accused No.32 relying on Achpal (supra)\n\nthat, as on the date of filing of default bail petition, the State had not complied\n\nwith the objections pointed out by the learned trial Judge, as such, Accused\n\nNo.32 got indefeasible right of default bail as it should be considered as if there\n\nis no chargesheet. In Achpal (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing\n\n78 AIR 1951 SC 207\nwith a situation wherein, FIR was lodged for serious offences, and the\n\nappellants (Accused 1 and 2) were arrested on 8.4.2018. While they remained\n\nin custody, the High Court on 3.7.2018 ordered that a higher-ranked officer (not\n\nbelow ASP) must complete the investigation within two months. The statutory\n\n90-day period for filing a charge-sheet was set to end on 7.7.2018. Although a\n\ncharge-sheet was filed on 5.7.2018, it was filed by an officer below the required\n\nrank and was therefore returned by the Magistrate. Thus, on 7.7.2018 no valid\n\ncharge-sheet was on record, and the accused applied for default bail. The\n\nMagistrate rejected the application, calling the defect \"technical\" and treating\n\nthe High Court's order as extending time. The High Court upheld this view,\n\nholding that a charge-sheet had been presented before 90 days, even though it\n\nwas returned for not complying with its earlier order.\n\n148. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Achpal (supra) noted that even\n\nthough a charge-sheet was filed on 5.7.2018, it had been submitted by an officer\n\nbelow the rank promised before the High Court, which had directed that the\n\ninvestigation be done by a Gazetted Officer. As this requirement was not\n\nfollowed, the Magistrate returned the papers even before the 90-day period\n\nexpired. The Hon'ble Supreme Court framed two key questions: (1) whether\n\nsuch an improper and non-compliant filing could be treated as \"completion of\n\ninvestigation\" under\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC to deny default bail, and (2) whether\n\nthe High Court's earlier order could be interpreted as extending the statutory\n\ntime for investigation. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that when the 90-day\n\nperiod expired, no valid Section 173 report was before the Magistrate because\n\nthe charge-sheet filed on 5.7.2018 had been returned for non-compliance with\nthe High Court's direction that a Gazetted Officer conducts the investigation. As\n\na result, the Magistrate had no material to assess whether further custody was\n\njustified, thereby depriving the accused of the statutory protection under\n\nSection 167(2).\n\n149. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the accused could not be\n\nremanded without such judicial consideration and accepted the argument that\n\ndefault bail had accrued. With respect to the second issue in Achpal (supra),\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the High Court had no power to extend\n\nthe statutory 60/90-day period for completing investigation under\nSection\n\n167(2)\nCrPC, because the Code provides no mechanism for extension, except in\n\nspecial laws like TADA or MCOCA which expressly modify Section 167. In this\n\ncase, the High Court's order dated 3.7.2018 merely recorded the Public\n\nProsecutor's submission that a Gazetted Officer would complete the\n\ninvestigation within two months; it was held to not be an order of extension,\n\nespecially since the High Court was not informed that the 90-day period was\n\nabout to expire.\n\n150. In the opinion of this Court, the reliance on Achpal (supra) is\n\nmisplaced because the ratio in Achpal (supra) operates on an entirely different\n\nfactual foundation. Achpal (supra) was a case where no charge sheet was\n\nbefore the Magistrate on the 90th day, because the report filed earlier was\n\nreturned by the Magistrate for not being in conformity with the High Court's\n\nspecific order directing investigation by a higher-ranked officer. Thus, on the\n\ncrucial 90th day, zero papers were on the Magistrate's record, triggering the\n\nstatutory right to default bail. To address this opinion better, it is relevant to\ntake note of the argument of Sri T. Niranjan Reddy, learned Senior Counsel for\n\nAccused No.33 who submitted that, had the State has complied with such\n\nobjections by the date of filing of their petition, the things would have been in a\n\ndifferent way and in written arguments it was stated that the chargesheet was\n\ncomplete in all aspects only on 01.09.2025.\n\n151. On the other hand, Sri Siddhartha Luthra would submit that the\n\nState have complied with the objections on 26.08.2025 itself and the same is\n\nmentioned in CFR on 01.09.2025, and therefore, though they have complied\n\nwith the objections, the learned trial Judge has not referred the compliance in\n\nthe order.\n\n152. In Velinedipurnam (supra) before a Division Bench of the then\n\nHon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh, the factual position was that the\n\nAccused was arrested on 15.06.1993, and the chargesheet was filed on\n\n28.08.1993, within 90days. As it contained defects, the Magistrate returned it,\n\nand the corrected chargesheet was finally re-submitted only on 17.09.1993, the\n\n95th day. The petitioner argued that since a complete and proper charge-sheet\n\nwas not filed within 90 days, he was entitled to default bail under\nSection 167(2)\n\nCrPC. The Magistrate rejected his plea. Aggrieved thereby, petitioner\n\napproached High Court. In this context, it was observed as follows;\n\n\"8. It is indisputable that the amendments or corrections\nrelate back to the date of filing of the original document. In\nthis view the rectification of defects or compliance\nwith the objections will relate back to the date of\nfiling as if the corrections are made at the time of\nfiling the charge-sheet in the first instance and it\ncannot be said that presentation was made on the\ndate when the defects are rectified and\nrepresented.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n153. The same view was also expressed by a Coordinate Bench of this\n\nCourt in Akula Ravi Teja (supra). More so, a cursory look at the impugned\n\norders dated 06.09.2025 would go to show that the learned Special Judge is\n\naware of the compliance of the objections and also the law on the point that such\n\ncompliance dates back to the filing of the charge sheet. If a mistake is\n\ncommitted in not producing the relevant documents at the time of submitting\n\nthe report or the charge sheet, it is always open to the investigating officer to\n\nproduce the same with the permission of the Court. Return of charge sheet for\n\ncompliance of certain defects, implies permission to cure the defects. In the\n\npresent case, the charge sheet was returned on 23.08.2025 raising certain\n\nobjections. By compliance with the said objections, the defects are rectified.\n\nAdmittedly, the charge sheet was filed within the prescribed period of 90 days.\n\nTherefore, though the charge sheet is represented after curing the defects\n\npointed out, beyond the period mentioned in the proviso to\nS.167(2)\nCrPC, it\n\ndoes not entitle the Accused to get default bail, when the charge sheet was\n\noriginally filed within time. Even in the impugned order, as referred to supra,\n\nthe learned trial Judge has clearly mentioned that some of the objections have\n\nbeen complied with. In that view, the argument of the learned Senior Counsel\n\nfor Accused Nos.32 and 33 falls to ground.\n\n154. It is not out of place to mention that a judgment can operate as a\n\nprecedent only when the facts and circumstances of that case are in pari\nmateria i.e., identical in material respects to those of the case at hand. It is\n\ntherefore not correct to rely mechanically on decisions without examining\n\nwhether the factual matrix therein. Each case must be decided on its own facts,\n\nand the facts of cited cases cannot be blindly treated as applicable. In simple\n\nwords, a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. Moreover, it is\n\nalso settled principle of law as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nB.\n\nShama Rao v. Union Territory of Pondicherry,79\nthat a decision is\n\nbinding not on its conclusion but in regard to its ratio and the principle laid\n\ndown therein.\n\nD. Inability to show custody as cognizance not taken:\n\n155. The Learned Special Judge opined that because of the defects\n\npointed out viz., filing of chargesheet against a few, waiting for FSL reports,\n\nnon-receipt of sanction and raids still being conducted, cognizance is not\n\npossible. At the same time, he cannot extend the remand of the accused beyond\n\nthe statutory period of ninety days as in the case of the other special Acts and\n\nwithout taking cognizance custody under\nSection 309 (2)\nCr.P.C. cannot be\n\npermitted.\n\n156.\nIn\nSuresh Bhikamchand Jain\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt had categorically held that the cognizance is immaterial so far as Section\n\n167 (2) is concerned and the accused continues to remain in the custody of the\n\nMagistrate till such time as cognizance is taken by the court trying the offence.\n\nRelevant extracts from the decision are;\n\n79 AIR 1967 SC 1480\n\"16. At this juncture, we may refer to certain dates which\nare relevant to the facts of this case, namely:\n\n(a) 11-3-2012 -- The petitioner arrested and remanded to\npolice custody;\n\n(b) 25-4-2012 -- First charge-sheet filed against the four\naccused;\n\n(c) 1-6-2012 -- Supplementary charge-sheet filed in which\nthe petitioner is named;\n\n(d) 30-7-2012 -- The trial court rejected the petitioner's\nprayer for grant of bail;\n\n(e) 13-9-2012 [\nSuresh v. State of Maharashtra, Criminal\nApplication No.\n3568 of 2012, order dated 13-9-2012\n(Bom)] -- The High Court confirmed the order of the trial\ncourt;\n\n(f) 2-10-2012 -- Application filed under\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC\nbefore the trial court;\n\n(g) 5-10-2012 -- The trial court rejected the application\nunder\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC.\n\nFrom the above dates, it would be evident that both the\ncharge-sheet as also the supplementary charge-sheet were\nfiled within 90 days from the date of the petitioner's arrest\nand remand to police custody. It is true that cognizance was\nnot taken by the Special Court on account of failure of the\nprosecution to obtain sanction to prosecute the accused\nunder the provisions of the\nPC Act\n, but does such failure\namount to non-compliance with the provisions of\nSection\n167(2)\nCrPC is the question with which we are confronted.\n\n17. In our view, grant of sanction is nowhere contemplated\nunder\nSection 167\nCrPC. What the said section contemplates\nis the completion of investigation in respect of different\ntypes of cases within a stipulated period and the right of an\naccused to be released on bail on the failure of the\ninvestigating authorities to do so. The scheme of the\nprovisions relating to remand of an accused, first during the\nstage of investigation and, thereafter, after cognizance is\ntaken, indicates that the legislature intended investigation\nof certain crimes to be completed within 60 days and\noffences punishable with death, imprisonment for life or\nimprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years, within 90\ndays. In the event, the investigation is not completed by the\ninvestigating authorities, the accused acquires an\nindefeasible right to be granted bail, if he offers to furnish\nbail. Accordingly, if on either the 61st day or the 91st day, an\naccused makes an application for being released on bail in\ndefault of charge-sheet having been filed, the court has no\noption but to release the accused on bail. The said provision\nhas been considered and interpreted in various cases, such\nas the ones referred to hereinbefore. Both the decisions\nin Natabar Parida case [(1975) 2 SCC 220 : 1975 SCC (Cri)\n484] and in\nSanjay Dutt\ncase [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC\n(Cri) 1433] were instances where the charge-sheet was not\nfiled within the period stipulated in\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC and\nan application having been made for grant of bail prior to\nthe filing of the charge-sheet, this Court held that the\naccused enjoyed an indefeasible right to grant of bail, if such\nan application was made before the filing of the charge-\nsheet, but once the charge-sheet was filed, such right came\nto an end and the accused would be entitled to pray for\nregular bail on merits.\n\n18. None of the said cases detract from the position\nthat once a charge-sheet is filed within the\nstipulated time, the question of grant of default bail\nor statutory bail does not arise. As indicated\nhereinabove, in our view, the filing of charge-sheet is\nsufficient compliance with the provisions of Section\n167(2)(a)(ii) in this case. Whether cognizance is taken\nor not is not material as far as\nSection 167\nCrPC is\nconcerned. The right which may have accrued to the\npetitioner, had charge-sheet not been filed, is not attracted\nto the facts of this case. Merely because sanction had not\nbeen obtained to prosecute the accused and to proceed to\nthe stage of\nSection 309\nCrPC, it cannot be said that the\naccused is entitled to grant of statutory bail, as envisaged in\n\nSection 167\nCrPC. The scheme of\nCrPC\nis such that\nonce the investigation stage is completed, the court\nproceeds to the next stage, which is the taking of\ncognizance and trial. An accused has to remain in\ncustody of some court. During the period of\ninvestigation, the accused is under the custody of\nthe Magistrate before whom he or she is first\nproduced. During that stage, under\nSection 167(2)\n\nCrPC, the Magistrate is vested with authority to\nremand the accused to custody, both police custody\nand/or judicial custody, for 15 days at a time, up to\na maximum period of 60 days in cases of offences\npunishable for less than 10 years and 90 days where\nthe offences are punishable for over 10 years or\neven death sentence. In the event, an investigating\nauthority fails to file the charge-sheet within the\nstipulated period, the accused is entitled to be\nreleased on statutory bail. In such a situation, the\naccused continues to remain in the custody of the\nMagistrate till such time as cognizance is taken by\nthe court trying the offence, when the said court\nassumes custody of the accused for purposes of\nremand during the trial in terms of\nSection 309\n\nCrPC. The two stages are different, but one follows\nthe other so as to maintain a continuity of the\ncustody of the accused with a court.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n157.\nIn\nRahul Modi\n(supra), before a two-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, the issue whether an accused is entitled for statutory bail under\n\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC on the ground that cognizance has not been taken before\n\nthe expiry of 60 days or 90 days, as the case may be, from the date of remand,\n\narose for consideration.\n\n\"15. A close scrutiny of the judgments in\nSanjay Dutt\n\n(supra),\nMadar Sheikh\n(supra) and\nM. Ravindran\n\n(supra) would show that there is nothing contrary to what\nhas been decided in\nBhikamchand Jain\n(supra). In all\nthe above judgments which are relied upon by either side,\nthis Court had categorically laid down that the indefeasible\nright of an accused to seek statutory bail under\nSection\n167(2)\n, CrPC arises only if the charge-sheet has not been\nfiled before the expiry of the statutory period.\n\nReference to\ncognizance in\nMadar Sheikh\n(supra) is in view of the fact\nsituation where the application was filed after the charge-\n\nsheet was submitted and cognizance had been taken by the\ntrial court. Such reference cannot be construed as\nthis Court introducing an additional requirement\nof cognizance having to be taken within the period\nprescribed under proviso (a) to\nSection 167(2)\n,\nCrPC, failing which the accused would be entitled to\ndefault bail, even after filing of the charge-sheet\nwithin the statutory period. It is not necessary to repeat\nthat in both\nMadar Sheikh\n(supra) and\nM. Ravindran\n\n(supra), this Court expressed its view that non-filing of the\ncharge-sheet within the statutory period is the ground for\navailing the indefeasible right to claim bail under\nSection\n167(2)\n, CrPC.\n\nThe conundrum relating to the custody\nof the accused after the expiry of 60 days has also\nbeen dealt with by this Court in\nBhikamchand Jain\n\n(supra). It was made clear that the accused remains\nin custody of the Magistrate till cognizance is taken\nby the relevant court.\n\nAs the issue that arises for\nconsideration in this case is squarely covered by the\njudgment in\nBhikamchand Jain\n(supra), the order\npassed by the High Court on 31.05.2019 is hereby set aside.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n158. The above position of law is again reiterated by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the decision of\nJudgebir\n(supra), as follows;\n\n\"58. ....The scheme of\nCrPC\nis such that once the stage of\ninvestigation is completed, the court proceeds to the next\nstage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial. During the\nperiod of investigation, the accused is under the custody of\nthe Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced, with\nsuch Magistrate being vested with the power to remand the\naccused to police custody and/or judicial custody, up to a\nmaximum period as prescribed under\nSection 167(2)\nCrPC.\nAcknowledging the fact that an accused has to\nremain in custody of some court, this Court\nconcluded that on filing of the charge-sheet within\nthe stipulated period, the accused continues to\nremain in the custody of the Magistrate till such time\nas cognizance is taken by the court trying the\noffence, when the said court assumes custody of the\naccused for purposes of remand during the trial in\nterms of Section 309CrPC. This Court clarified that\nthe two stages are different, with one following the\nother so as to maintain continuity of the custody of\nthe accused with a court.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n159. The learned Special Judge appears to have relied on the decision\n\nrendered by the Bombay High Court in Sarath Chandra Vinayak Dongre\n\nand others v. State of Maharashtra,80 which held that incomplete\n\ncharge-sheets of the Code would not entitle the Magistrate to take cognizance\n\nof the offences. In that matter, the prosecution filed five chargesheets along with\n\napplications seeking condonation of delay and permission to conduct further\n\ninvestigation and file an additional chargesheet within 6 months. Magistrate\n\ntook cognizance and issued process and had also allowed the condonation of\n\ndelay application without recording reasons and without hearing the accused.\n\nThe High Court held that cognizance on an incomplete police report which\n\ncannot be treated as a \"police report\" at all as contemplated under Section\n\n173(2), was without jurisdiction and therefore quashed the entire proceedings,\n\nincluding the issuance of process.\n\n80 1991CRILJ 3329\n160. Thereafter, in appeal before a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court titled as\nState of Maharashtra v. Sarath Chandra\n\nVinayak Dongre\nand others,81 the decision of the Bombay High Cour to\n\nthe extent of quashing the condonation of delay without notice was upheld,\n\nwhereas the quashing of cognizance and issuing of process was overturned\n\ncalling it patently erroneous. The Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated that the\n\npolice report with the details as required under\nSection 173 (2)\nCr.P.C. is to\n\nenable the Magistrate to satisfy himself whether a case for taking cognizance is\n\nmade out or not by applying his mind. It was categorically held that the prayer\n\nof the investigating agency seeking permission to further investigate and submit\n\na \"supplementary chargesheet\" could not vitiate the cognizance taken by the\n\nMagistrate nor denude him of his jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence.\n\nRelevant portion from the decision is as follows;\n\n\"7. The purpose of the submission of the police report with\nthe details as mentioned above, is to enable the Magistrate\nto satisfy himself, whether on the basis of the report and the\nmaterial filed along with the police report, a case for taking\ncognizance has been made out or not. After applying his\nmind to the police report and the material submitted\ntherewith, if the Magistrate is satisfied that cognizance of\nthe offence is required to be taken, he shall proceed further\nin accordance with the provisions of the\nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n.\nSection 190(1)(b)\nCrPC provides that a\nMagistrate has the power to take cognizance upon a police\nreport of such facts as are provided therein on being\nsatisfied that the case is a fit one for taking cognizance of the\n\n81 (1995) 1 SCC 42\noffence. Therefore, if the police report and the\nmaterial filed therewith is sufficient to satisfy the\nMagistrate that he should take cognizance, his\npower is not fettered by the label which the\ninvestigating agency chooses to give to the report\nsubmitted by it under\nSection 173(2)\nCrPC. Merely,\nbecause the prosecution had filed an application, after\nsubmission of the charge-sheet, seeking permission to file\n\"supplementary charge-sheet\", it could not affect the\njurisdiction of the Magistrate to take cognizance, if he was\notherwise satisfied from the material placed before him\nalong with the charge-sheet that cognizance of the offence\nwas required to be taken. It is the jurisdiction of the\nMagistrate and Magistrate alone to decide whether the\nmaterial placed by the prosecution with the report (charge-\nsheet) was sufficient to take cognizance or not. The power\nof the Magistrate to take cognizance cannot be\ncontrolled by the investigating agency, whose duty\nis only to investigate and place the facts and the\nevidence before the Magistrate.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n161. Therefore, the reliance of the learned Special Judge on the decision\n\nof the Bombay High Court which is overturned on that point by a three Judge\n\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is legally flawed. Instead of taking recourse\n\nto the steps provided in Bhagwant Singh (supra), the learned Special Judge's\n\ninsistence that there is no other option than to grant default bail because\n\ncognizance was not taken and he cannot show custody under\nSection 309(2)\nof\n\nCr.P.C. At this juncture, it is also pertinent to state that the argument advanced\n\nby Sri Sidharth Luthra that automatically after the expiry of 90 days, Section\n309 comes into play holds no water. It is not uncommon to see that though the\n\nprosecution files Charge sheet within time, it may take some time for the Court\n\nto take cognizance. This exercise sometimes may take time. It does not\n\nautomatically entitle any accused to sought for default bail.\n\n162. The view of the learned Special Judge is also directly contrary to\n\nthe clear and categorical holding of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nRahul\n\nModi\n,(supra) after examining\nSanjay Dutt\n(supra),\nMadar Sheikh\n\n(supra),\nM. Ravindran\n(supra) and\nSuresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain\n,\n\n(supra), it was held that \"filing of a charge-sheet is sufficient compliance with\n\nSection 167(2)\n, CrPC and an accused cannot demand default bail on the\n\nground that cognizance has not been taken\"\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n163. In view of the discussion made supra, the conclusions to each\n\nquestion are tabulated below;\n\na. Whether an Accused is i. The indefeasible right of an accused\nentitled to default bail under to seek statutory bail under proviso\nproviso to Section 187 (3)(ii) of to Section Section 187 (3)(ii) of\nBNSS when the chargesheet, BNSS, exhausts the moment a\nthough filed within the statutory chargesheet in compliance to\nperiod, is returned on certain Section 193 (3) is filed within the\ndefects, which are subsequently statutory period.\n\ncomplied? ii. The word \"shall\" used in Section\n193(6) of BNSS is directory and not\nmandatory.\n\niii. Nature and gravity of these defects\nare to be seen case to case basis.\nRectification of defects/compliance\nwith objections will relate back to\nthe date of filing as if the corrections\nare made at the time of filing the\ncharge-sheet in the first instance.\n\nb. Whether mere seeking of i. Even after submission of police report\npermission for further under Section 193(3) on completion of\ninvestigation would make the investigation, the police has right for\ninvestigation incomplete and \"further\" investigation under Section\nconsequently the chargesheet 193(9) but not \"fresh investigation\" or\nincomplete for the purposes of \"reinvestigation\".\ndefault bail under proviso to ii. Mere seeking of permission for further\nSection 187(3)(ii) of the BNSS? investigation would not lead to the\nright to statutory bail under proviso to\nSection 187(3)(ii) of the BNSS.\n\nc. Whether taking cognizance When a chargesheet is filed within the\nof the case is precondition for statutory period and in compliance to\nextending remand of an Accused Section 193 (3) of the BNSS, merely\nafter the filing of the charge sheet because cognizance of the offence is not\nwithin the statutory period, and taken would not be a ground to grant\nwhether the Court's inability to statutory bail. Accused remains in\ntake cognizance can be a ground custody of the Magistrate till cognizance\nfor default bail? is taken.\n\n164. A Three Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nAslam\n\nBabalal Desai\n(supra), observed that when two views or interpretations are\n\npossible, in the field of criminal justice involving the liberty of an individual, the\n\none in favour of the Accused should be adopted.\n165. A close scrutiny of the decisions in\nSanjay Dutt\n(supra),\nMadar\n\nSheikh\n(supra),\nSuresh Kumar Bikamchand Jain\n(supra),\nRahul Modi\n\n(supra),\nBhagavanth Singh\n(supra),\nDinesh Dalmia\n(supra),\nKapil\n\nWadhawan\n(supra),\nJudgebir Singh\n(supra),\nDablu Kujur\n(supra), and\n\nSharif Ahmed\n(supra) which were relied on by either side, show that the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court had categorically laid down that the indefeasible right\n\nof an accused to seek statutory bail under\nSection 167(2)\nCr.P.C.,(corresponding\n\nto Section 187 (3) BNSS) which is a fundamental right under\nArticle 21\n, exists\n\nonly when the Police fails to file the chargesheet within the statutory period of\n\n60/90 days, as the case maybe. In the present case, the police report filed on\n\n19.07.2025 and the supplementary report filed on 11.08.2025 were both\n\nsubmitted before the expiry of the statutory period in respect of all the Accused\n\nherein.\n\nThe Constitution Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nK.\n\nVeeraswami\n(supra), clearly held that the statutory requirement of the report\n\nunder Section 173(2) would be complied with if the various details prescribed\n\ntherein are included in the report. The reports herein also contain all necessary\n\nparticulars as required under Section 193(3) BNSS (corresponding to\nSection\n\n173 (2)\nCr.P.C.) to enable the learned Special Judge to proceed with the matter.\n\nFurthermore, if any further investigation is required in respect of Respondents/\n\nAccused Nos. 31 to 33, it would only be in addition to what had already been\n\ngathered by the Investigating Officer as of the date of filing the supplementary\n\nreport, as contemplated under\nSection 193(9)\nCr.P.C. In that view, this Court\n\nhas no hesitation to say that the questions of law falling for consideration before\n\nthis Court do not give any scope to entertain two views.\n166. In the light of the above legal analysis, this Court is of the view that\n\nthe impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 warrant interference of this Court as\n\nthey are unsustainable on the touchstone of settled principles of law. However,\n\nas already enunciated, this Court is not inclined to go into the question of\n\nquashing the official Memoranda, as they are essentially an administrative act.\n\nRESULT:\n\n167. In that view of the matter, the Criminal Petitions are allowed in\n\npart, quashing the impugned orders dated 06.09.2025 passed by the learned\n\nSpecial Judge for SPE and ACB Cases-cum- III Additional District Judge,\n\nVijayawada in Crl.M.P. Nos., 1446, 1447 and 1467 of 2025 pertaining to Crime\n\nNo.21/2024 (CID Police Station,Mangalagiri). Consequently, the Respondents/\n\nAccused Nos., 31, 32 and 33 are directed to surrender before the Learned Special\n\nJudge for SPE and ACB Cases-cum-III Additional District Judge, Vijayawada\n\non or before 26.11.2025.\n\n168. Needless to state, Accused Nos., 31 32 and 33 may seek regular bail\n\nand the learned Special Judge may deal with the same on their own merits.\n\n169. It is clarified that observations made in this judgment are on the\n\nquestion of law arising on default bail and cannot be construed as an opinion\n\non merits relating to Crime No.21/2024 of CID Police Station, Mangalagiri.\n\nPending Interlocutory Applications, if any, shall also stand closed.\n\nDR.
