Petitioner.\n\nMr. Fazlur Rahman,\nMr. Md. Babul Hossain\n... For the Petitioner.\n\nMr. Saryati Dutta,\nMr. Dattatreya Dutta\n... For the State.\n\nDictated by Arijit Banerjee, J.\n\n1. The petitioner renews his prayer for bail which was\nlast rejected on August 30, 2024. The last rejection was\nprimarily on the basis of an order dated March 30, 2023\npassed on a bail application of a co-accused person being\nCRM (NDPS) 594 of 2023, whereby two years' time was\ngranted for conclusion of the trial. That time period is to\nexpire on May 17, 2025. On instruction, learned State\ncounsel tells us that the trial will definitely be concluded by\nthat date.\n\n2. The petitioner renews his prayer saying that after\nAugust 30, 2024, only two witnesses have been examined.\nThere are 25 charge sheet named witnesses. Therefore, early\n\nSigned By :\n\nDEBAJYOTI DAS\nHigh Court of\nCalcutta\n14 th of February\n2025 06:23:48\nPM\nconclusion of the trial or conclusion within May 17, 2025, is\nimpossible.\n\n3. Opposing the prayer for bail, learned State advocate\ntells us that the prosecution has examined four witnesses till\ndate. It proposes to examine eight more witnesses. The trial\nwould definitely conclude within May 17, 2025.\n\n4. We have considered the rival contentions of the\nparties. The petitioner is in custody for more than four years.\nGiven the pace at which the trial has been proceeding, it is\nhighly improbable that the trial would conclude by May 17,\n2025. The petitioner is in custody for over four years.\n\n5. Therefore, without touching the merits of the case\nand solely on the touchstone of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution\nof India, we feel constrained to enlarge the petitioner on bail.\n\n6. Accordingly, we direct that the petitioner, namely,\nPartha Saha, shall be released on bail upon furnishing a\nbond of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand), with\ntwo sureties of Rs.12,500/- each, one of whom must be local,\nto the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th\nCourt, Barasat, Special Court under\nNDPS Act\n. The\npetitioner shall appear before the learned trial Court on every\ndate of hearing and shall not intimidate the witnesses and/or\ntamper with evidence in any manner whatsoever and/or\ncommit any cognizable offence in any manner whatsoever.\nThe petitioner shall remain within the jurisdiction of\nNabadweep Police Station except for the purpose of attending\nthe court proceedings and shall report to the Officer-in-\nCharge/Inspector-in-Charge of Nabadweep Police Station\nonce in a fortnight, until further orders.\n\n7. In the event the petitioner fails to comply with any\nof the conditions stipulated above, the trial Court shall be at\n\nSigned By :\n\nDEBAJYOTI DAS\nHigh Court of\nCalcutta\n14 th of February\n2025 06:23:48\nPM\nliberty to cancel the bail in accordance with law without\nfurther reference to this Court.\n\n8. The application for bail is, thus, allowed.\n\n9. All parties shall act on the server copies of this\norder duly downloaded from the official website of this Court.\n\n10. Criminal Section is directed to supply certified copies\nof this order to the parties, if applied for, upon compliance of\nall necessary formalities.\n\n(Arijit Banerjee, J.)\n\n(Apurba Sinha Ray, J.)\n\nSigned By :\n\nDEBAJYOTI DAS\nHigh Court of\nCalcutta\n14 th of February\n2025 06:23:48\nPM",
