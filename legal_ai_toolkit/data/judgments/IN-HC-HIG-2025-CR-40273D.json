Satapathy\n\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA AT CUTTACK\nBLAPL No.8470 of 2025\n\n(In the matter of application under\nSection 439\nCrPC r/w.\n\nSection 167(2)\nof CrPC/\nSec.483\nr/w\nSec.187(3)\nof\nBNSS.)\n\nRajeev Lugun @ Topno ...

SATAPATHY\n\nDATE OF HEARING & JUDGMENT:16.09.2025 (ORAL)\n\nG. Satapathy, J.\n\n1. This is bail application U/\nS.483\nof BNSS by\n\nthe petitioner for grant of bail in connection with\n\nBirmitrapur P.S. Case No.177 of 2024 corresponding\n\nto S.T. Case No.151/11 of 2024 pending in the file of\n\nlearned Ad-hoc ADJ (FTSC) POCSO, Rourkela, for\n\ncommission of offences punishable U/Ss. 376(D)/\n\n376(2)(1)/114 of\nIPC\n, on the main allegation of\n\ncommitting Gang Rape upon the victim.\n\nPage 1 of 12\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025\n\n2. In the course of hearing, Mr. Ramesh Kumar\n\nSahoo, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\nsince chemical examination report has not yet been\n\nfiled by the prosecution, the charge sheet which has\n\nbeen filed in this case is incomplete one, but the\n\npetitioner having detained in custody beyond the\n\nstatutory period as prescribed for default bail, he may\n\nkindly be granted default bail. In support of his\n\ncontention, the learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nrelies upon the decision in Ritu Chhabaria Vrs.\n\nUnion of India; Writ Petition (Criminal) No.60 of\n\n2023. On the sole plea of default bail, Mr. Ramesh\n\nKumar Sahoo, prays to grant bail to the petitioner.\n\n2.1. On the other hand, Mr. P. Satpathy, however,\n\nopposes such plea of the petitioner by stating that\n\nmerely because chemical examination report has not\n\nyet been filed, it cannot be construed that the charge\n\nsheet is incomplete and the petitioner is entitled to\n\ndefault bail. Mr. Satpathy, accordingly, prays to reject\n\nthe bail application of the petitioner.\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 2 of 12\n\n3. After having considered the rival submissions\n\nupon perusal of record, there appears allegation\n\nagainst the petitioner for committing gang rape upon\n\nthe victim, but the plea of the petitioner is for default\n\nbail on the ground of non-submission of chemical\n\nexamination report. Undoubtedly, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner has relied upon the decision in Ritu\n\nChhabaria (supra), but in Directorate of\n\nEnforcement Vrs. Manpreet Singh Talwar;\n\nSpecial leave to criminal No.5724 of 2023(with IA\n\nNo.90183 of 2023), a three judge bench of the Apex\n\nCourt has been pleased to held as under:-\n\n\"1. we clarify that the order shall not\npreclude any trial Court or, as the case may\nbe, High Court for considering an application\nfor grant of default bail U/\nS.167\nof the Code\nof Criminal Procedure 1973 independent of\nand without relying on the judgment dated\n26th April 2023 in Writ Petition (Criminal)\nNo.60 of 2023.\"\n\n4. In regard to plea for default bail to the\n\npetitioner, who is mainly accused of committing Gang\n\nRape upon the victim for want of CE report, this Court\n\nconsiders it useful to refer to the following decisions\n\nof the Apex Court:-\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 3 of 12\n\n4.1.\nIn\nK. Veeraswami vs. Union of India\n;\n\n(1991) 3 SCC 655, while explaining the scope of\n\nSection 173(2)\nof the CrPC, a Constitutional Bench of\n\nApex Court in paragraph 76 has held as under:-\n\n\"76. The charge-sheet is nothing but a final\nreport of police officer under\nSection 173(2)\nof\nthe Code. The\nSection 173(2)\nprovides that on\ncompletion of the investigation the police\nofficer investigating into a cognizable offence\nshall submit a report. The report must be in the\nform prescribed by the State Government and\nstating therein (a) the names of the parties;\n\n(b) the nature of the information; (c) the\nnames of the persons who appear to be\nacquainted with the circumstances of the\ncase; (d) whether any offence appears to\nhave been committed and, if so, by whom\n\n(e) whether the accused has been\narrested; (f) whether he had been\nreleased on his bond and, if so, whether\nwith or without sureties; and (g) whether\nhe has been forwarded in custody under\n\nSection 170\n. As observed by this Court in\n\nSatya Narain Musadi v. State of\nBihar\n;1980 3 SCC 152 that the statutory\nrequirement of the report under\nSection\n173(2)\nwould be complied with if the\nvarious details prescribed therein are\nincluded in the report. This report is an\nintimation to the magistrate that upon\ninvestigation into a cognizable offence the\nInvestigating Officer has been able to procure\nsufficient evidence for the court to inquire into\nthe offence and the necessary information is\nbeing sent to the court. In fact, the report\nunder\nSection 173(2)\npurports to be an opinion\nof the Investigating Officer that as far as he is\nconcerned he has been able to procure\nsufficient material for the trial of the accused\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 4 of 12\n\nby the court. The report is complete if it is\naccompanied with all the documents and\nstatements of witnesses as required by\nSection\n175(5)\n. Nothing more need be stated in the\nreport of the Investigating Officer. It is also not\nnecessary that all the details of the offence\nmust be stated. The details of the offence are\nrequired to be proved to bring home the guilt\nto the accused at a later stage i.e. in the\ncourse of the trial of the case by adducing\nacceptable evidence.\"\n\n4.2.\nIn the context of this matter, this Court\n\nconsiders it profitable to refer to the decision in\n\nCentral Bureau of Investigation v. Kapil\n\nWadhawan and another\n; (2024) 3 SCC 734\n\nwherein in a similar situation, the Apex Court has\n\nheld as under:-\n\n\"23. The benefit of proviso appended to sub-\nsection (2) of\nSection 167\nof the Code would be\navailable to the offender only when a charge-\nsheet is not filed and the investigation is kept\npending against him. Once however, a charge-\nsheet is filed, the said right ceases. It may be\nnoted that the right of the investigating officer\nto pray for further investigation in terms of\nsub-section (8) of\nSection 173\nis not taken\naway only because a charge-sheet is filed\nunder sub-section (2) thereof against the\naccused. Though ordinarily all documents relied\nupon by the prosecution should accompany the\ncharge-sheet, nonetheless for some reasons, if\nall the documents are not filed along with the\ncharge- sheet, that reason by itself would not\ninvalidate or vitiate the charge-sheet. It is also\nwell settled that the court takes cognizance of\nthe offence and not the offender. Once from\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 5 of 12\n\nthe material produced along with the\ncharge-sheet, the court is satisfied about\nthe commission of an offence and takes\ncognizance of the offence allegedly\ncommitted by the accused, it is immaterial\nwhether the further investigation in terms\nof\nSection 173(8)\nis pending or not. The\npendency of the further investigation qua the\nother accused or for production of some\ndocuments not available at the time of filing of\ncharge-sheet would neither vitiate the charge-\nsheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim\nright to get default bail on the ground that the\ncharge-sheet was an incomplete charge- sheet\nor that the charge-sheet was not filed in terms\nof\nSection 173(2)\nCode.\"\n\n4.3.\nIn\nDinesh Dalmia vs. CBI\n.; (2007) 8 SCC\n\n770, while discussing the scope of\nSection 167(2)\n\nvis-à-vis\nSection 173(8)\nof the CrPC, the Apex Court\n\nhas held the followings in paragraphs-19, 20 and 22:-\n\n\"19. A charge-sheet is a final report within the\nmeaning of sub-section (2) of\nSection 173\nof\nthe Code. It is filed so as to enable the court\nconcerned to apply its mind as to whether\ncognizance of the offence thereupon should be\ntaken or not. The report is ordinarily filed in the\nform prescribed therefor. One of the\nrequirements for submission of a police\nreport is whether any offence appears to\nhave been committed and, if so, by whom.\nIn some cases, the accused having not been\narrested, the investigation against him may not\nbe complete. There may not be sufficient\nmaterial for arriving at a decision that the\nabsconding accused is also a person by whom\nthe offence appears to have been committed. If\nthe investigating officer finds sufficient\nevidence even against such an accused who\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 6 of 12\n\nhad been absconding, in our opinion, law does\nnot require that filing of the charge-sheet must\nawait the arrest of the accused.\n\n20. Indisputably, the power of the\ninvestigating officer to make a prayer for\nmaking further investigation in terms of sub-\nsection (8) of\nSection 173\nis not taken away\nonly because a charge-sheet under sub-section\n(2) thereof has been filed. A further\ninvestigation is permissible even if order of\ncognizance of offence has been taken by the\nMagistrate.\n\n22. It is true that ordinarily all documents\naccompany the charge- sheet. But, in this case,\nsome documents could not be filed which were\nnot in the possession of CBI and the same were\nwith GEQD. As indicated hereinbefore, the said\ndocuments are said to have been filed on 20-1-\n2006 whereas the appellant was arrested on\n12-2-2006. The appellant does not contend\nthat he has been prejudiced by not filing of\nsuch documents with the charge-sheet. No\nsuch plea in fact had been taken. Even if all the\ndocuments had not been filed, by reason\nthereof submission of charge- sheet itself does\nnot become vitiated in law. The charge-sheet\nhas been acted upon as an order of\ncognizance had been passed on the basis\nthereof. The appellant has not questioned\nthe said order taking cognizance of the\noffence. Validity of the said charge-sheet\nis also not in question.\"\n\n5. In the aforesaid situation and on a careful\n\nconsideration of the provision governing the default\n\nbail and investigation, it appears to the Court that\n\nthere is a difference between filing a charge sheet\n\nand forwarding of the documents together with the\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 7 of 12\n\ncharge sheet, since the charge sheet is filed upon\n\ncompletion of investigation after the Investigating\n\nOfficer finding sufficient evidence to prosecute the\n\naccused for offences and the documents collected by\n\nthe Investigating Officer is only corroborative in\n\nnature to the accusations. Further,\nSection\n\n173(2)(i)(d)\nof the CrPC/193(3)(i)(d) of the BNSS\n\ndiscloses that while submitting a Police report, it is\n\nthe duty of the Investigating Officer to state whether\n\nany offence appears to have been committed and if\n\nso, by whom and the forwarding of documents\n\nreferred to in\nSection 173(5)\nof the CrPC[193(6) of\n\nthe BNSS] along with police report U/\nS. 173(2)\nof the\n\nCrPC[193(3) of the BNSS] is only directory in nature,\n\nbut not mandatory as held by the Apex Court in\n\nNarendra Kumar Amin v. Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation and others\n; (2015) 3 SCC 417.\n\nMoreover, when the further investigation as\n\ncontemplated U/\nS. 173(8)\nof the CrPC/193(9) of the\n\nBNSS is permissible, the Investigating Officer, if\n\nsituation so calls for can conduct further investigation\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 8 of 12\n\nand thereby, no statutory Bar having been imposed\n\nfor collection of further evidence in the form of\n\nadditional documents which are gathered prior to or\n\nsubsequent to the investigation can be produced\n\nbefore the Court. In this situation, there being no\n\nstatutory Bar for production of additional documents\n\nbefore the Court, mere non-filing of full set of\n\ndocuments with police report/charge sheet within\n\nstatutory period does not entitle the accused to\n\ndefault bail, unless the police report is not a complete\n\nreport in terms of\nSec. 173(2)\nof the CrPC/193(3) of\n\nthe BNSS.\n\n6. In the present case, the undisputed facts\n\ndisclose that soon after receipt of the report styled as\n\ncharge sheet on 20.07.2024, cognizance of the\n\noffences U/ss. 376(D)/376(2)(1)/114 of the\nIPC\nwas\n\ntaken on the same day, but the petitioner by then\n\nhaving not completed the statutory period of 120\n\ndays for default bail, the right to default bail had not\n\naccrued to the petitioner on the date of taking\n\ncognizance of offences on presentation of report U/S.\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 9 of 12\n\n173(2) of the\nCrPC\n/193(3) of BNSS and thereafter,\n\nhis right to default bail would not revive.\nIn this\n\nregard, this Court considers it appropriate to refer to\n\nthe decision in\nMohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh and\n\nothers v. State of Maharashtra\n; (1996) 1 SCC\n\n722, wherein the appellants were taken into custody\n\non 16.01.1993 and charge sheet was submitted on\n\n30.08.1993; which was obviously beyond the\n\nstatutory period U/\nS. 20(4)(b)\nof the Terrorists and\n\nDisruptive Activities (Prevention Act) (in short \"the\n\nTADA Act\n\") and, though the appellants therein were\n\nentitled to be released on default bail in view of the\n\ncharge sheet not being filed within the statutory\n\nperiod prescribed U/\nS. 20(4)(b)\nof the TADA Act r/w.\n\nproviso (a) to Section 167(2) of the Code, but they\n\ndid not make an application for release on bail on the\n\nground of default in completion of investigation within\n\nthe statutory period. In such situation, the Apex\n\nCourt in paragraph-11 therein has held as under:-\n\n\"11. xx xx xx It is now settled that this right\n[U/S. 167(2) of the Code(\nCrPC\n)] cannot be\nexercised after the charge sheet has been\nsubmitted and cognizance has been taken,\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 10 of 12\n\nbecause in that event the remand of the\naccused concerned including one who is alleged\nto have committed an offence under TADA, is\nnot U/S. 167(2), but under other provisions of\nthe Code (\nCrPC\n).\"\n\n7. Thus, on a careful conspectus of facts of the\n\npresent case and the law\nlaid down by\nApex Court in\n\nMadar Sheikh\n(supra), it can be well considered\n\nthat the right to statutory bail becomes unenforceable\n\nafter cognizance having been taken on the Police\n\nreport U/\nS. 173(2)\nof the CrPC/193(3) of BNSS. In\n\nview of the precedents\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court\n\nin the decisions\nreferred to above\ntogether with\n\nconsideration of facts involved in this case, it is\n\ncrystal clear that the non-submission of CE report in a\n\ncase of this nature where allegation against the\n\npetitioner is for committing Gang Rape would not\n\nautomatically render the charge sheet to be\n\nincomplete charge sheet and make the petitioner\n\nentitled to default bail inasmuch as the CE report is a\n\ncorroborative piece of evidence and the report U/\nS.\n\n173(2)\nof the CrPC/193(3) of BNSS does not\n\ncontemplate production of CE report to make the\n\nBLAPL No. 8470 of 2025 Page 11 of 12\n\nreport as a complete report. Consequently, the plea\n\nadvanced for the petitioner to treat the charge sheet\n\nas incomplete charge sheet for want of CE report so\n\nas to enable him to default/compulsive bail is\n\nunmerited and liable to be rejected.\n\nIn the result, the bail application of the\n\npetitioner stands rejected. Accordingly, the BLAPL\n\nstands disposed of.\n\n(G.
