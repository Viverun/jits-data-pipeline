CRIMINAL CASE No. 15107 of 2024\n\nBETWEEN:-\nSHITESH GUPTA S/O SHRI SHIVKUMAR GUPTA, AGED\nABOUT 40 YEARS, OCCUPATION: BUSINESS RESIDENT\nOF NEAR HANUMAN MANDIR BEOHARI POLICE\nSTATION BEOHARI DISTRICT SHAHDOL (MADHYA\nPRADESH)\n\n.....APPLICANT\n(BY SHRI MANISH DATT - SENIOR ADVOCATE WITH SHRI MAYANK\nSHARMA - ADVOCATE)\n\nAND\nTHE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH THROUGH POLICE\nS TATION BEOHARI DISTRICT SHAHDOL (MADHYA\nPRADESH)\n\n.....RESPONDENTS\n(BY SHRI AMIT DUBEY - PANEL LAWYER)\n\nThis application coming on for admission this day, the court passed the\nfollowing:\nORDER\n\nThis is third bail application filed by the applicant under\nSection 439\nof\nthe Cr.P.C. for grant of regular bail relating to FIR No.172/2023, dated\n26.02.2023 registered at Police Station-Beohari, District - Shahdol (M.P.) for\ncommission of offence punishable under\nSection 8\n,\nand\nof the NDPS Act\nand under Section 5/13 of M.P. Drug Control Act. Applicant is in detention\nsince 26.02.2023.\n\n2. Applicant's first bail application was dismissed as withdrawn and not\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: JASLEEN SINGH\n\nSALUJA\n\nSigning time: 4/25/2024\n\n5:45:38 PM\npressed vide order dated 05.09.2023 passed in M.Cr.C.No.24925/2023. His\nsecond bail application was also dismissed as withdrawn and not pressed vide\norder dated 01.02.2024, passed in M.Cr.C.No.56793/2023.\n\n3. As per the prosecution story, on 26.02.2023, 25 Onrex Cough Syrup\nhaving codeine phosphate was seized from the possession of the present\napplicant. FIR was registered.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that applicant has not\ncommitted any offence. He is innocent. He has been falsely implicated. He is in\njail for last more than one year. Therefore, it is prayed that applicant may be\nreleased on bail, pending the trial.\n\n5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer\nfor grant of bail to the applicant and has submitted that seized quantity is a\ncommercial quantity. Applicant has a criminal background of nine cases and\nout of these nine cases two cases of same nature under\nNDPS Act\nwere\nregistered against him in the year 2022 and this case has been registered in the\nyear 2023. He is a habitual offender and is continuously involved in possessing\nand selling contraband. Therefore, he has prayed for rejection of this bail\napplication.\n\n6. In this case a commercial quantity of contraband has been seized from\nthe possession of the applicant. Undoubtedly, he is in jail for the last one year,\nbut it cannot be overlooked that he is a habitual offender and except this case\ntwo cases under\nNDPS Act\nwere registered against him and in the previous year\ni.e. 2022.\nSection 37\nof the NDPS Act put a bar on the grant of bail where a\ncommercial quantity of contraband has been seized and its provision lays two\nlimitations: (i) that Court is prima-facie of view that accused is not guilty of the\noffence and; (ii) he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. As\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: JASLEEN SINGH\n\nSALUJA\n\nSigning time: 4/25/2024\n\n5:45:38 PM\naccused is already having criminal background of two cases under\nNDPS Act\n\nand after release on bail in those cases, he has been again found involved in\nsame nature of offence and commercial quantity has been seized. Therefore, no\nopinion can be formed that he will not commit same type of offence while on\nbail. Hence, I am of the view that no case for grant of bail is made out.\n\n7. Consequently, this third bail application too under\nSection 439\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail filed on behalf of applicant -\nShitesh Gupta is dismissed.\n\n(DINESH KUMAR PALIWAL)\nJUDGE\nJasleen\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: JASLEEN SINGH\n\nSALUJA\n\nSigning time: 4/25/2024\n\n5:45:38 PM",
