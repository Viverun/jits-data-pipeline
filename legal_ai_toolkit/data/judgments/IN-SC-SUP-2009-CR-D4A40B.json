(Criminal) No. 4689 of 2007)\n\nSubodh Kumar Yadav ... Appellant\n\nVersus\n\nState of Bihar and Anr. ... Respondents\nJUDGMENT\n\nJ.M. PANCHAL, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2. This appeal is directed against judgment dated\n\nMay 2, 2007, rendered by learned Single Judge of\n\nHigh Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal\n\nMiscellaneous No. 2790 of 2004 by which order\n\ndated January 8, 2004, passed by learned Sessions\n\nJudge, Purnia in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 13 of\n\n2003 cancelling the bail granted to the appellant by\n\nthe learned S.D.J.M., Purnia vide order dated\n\nOctober 19, 2002, passed in C.A. No. 1098 of 2001\n\nwith reference to the complaint filed by the\n\nrespondent No. 2 for alleged commission of offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 498A\nIPC, is confirmed.\n\n3. The marriage of the appellant was solemnized\n\nwith the respondent No. 2 on June 22, 1989. After\nthe marriage, the respondent No. 2 started living\n\nwith the appellant at her matrimonial home.\n\nDuring the subsistence of the marriage, the\n\nrespondent No. 2 gave birth to two daughters. It is\n\nthe case of the respondent No. 2 that the appellant\n\nand his family members started subjecting her to\n\nmental and physical cruelty for bringing insufficient\n\ndowry and also because she objected to illicit\n\nrelations of the appellant with his sister-in-law Asha\n\nDevi. The case of the respondent No. 2 is that not\n\nonly she was subjected to physical and mental\n\ncruelty, but money was extorted from her in order\n\nto get more dowry and an attempt to kill her was\n\nmade as well as her streedhan was not returned to\n\nher in spite of several demands. Under the\n\ncircumstances, she filed complaint case No. 1098 of\n\n2001 in the Court of learned Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate, Purnia and prayed to convict the\n\nappellant and others for commission of offences\npunishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n,\nand\nIPC.\n\n4. The learned Magistrate examined the respondent\n\nNo. 2 on oath. The learned Magistrate thereafter\n\ncalled upon the respondent No. 2 to offer other\n\nwitnesses for examination. Therefore, Bhageshwar\n\nPrasad Yadav, who is father of the respondent No.\n\n2, was examined as witness No. 1, Birendra Kumar,\n\nan independent person, was examined as witness\n\nNo.2 and Ramanuj Kumar, who is cousin of the\n\nrespondent No. 2, was examined as witness No. 3.\n\nThe learned Magistrate perused the statements\n\nmade by the witnesses and was of the opinion that\n\nprima facie commission of offence punishable under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC was made out against the\n\naccused. He, therefore, took cognizance of the said\n\noffence and issued summons against the accused\n\nincluding the appellant. On receipt of summons,\nthe appellant and others filed Criminal Revision No.\n\n233 of 2002 in the Court of learned Sessions Judge,\n\nPurnia for quashing the same. Therefore, the\n\nrecord of the case was called for by the Sessions\n\nCourt from the Court of learned Magistrate.\n\n5. On October 19, 2002, the appellant surrendered\n\nbefore the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First\n\nClass, Purnia and moved an application for bail.\n\nSince the original record was not available as the\n\nsame was summoned by the Sessions Court, the\n\nlearned Judicial Magistrate passed an order calling\n\nfor the original record from the Court of learned\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Purnia. Though the\n\ncopy of the application for bail was served on the\n\nlearned Advocate for the original complainant, the\n\nlearned Magistrate had not indicated in the order\n\nsummoning record of the case from the Sessions\n\nCourt that the bail application moved by the\nappellant would be heard on the same day. The\n\noriginal case record of Complaint Case No. 1098 of\n\n2001 was received in the Court of learned Judicial\n\nMagistrate First Class on the same day, i.e., on\n\nOctober 19, 2002. The learned Magistrate took up\n\nthe bail application for hearing on the same day.\n\nThe learned Magistrate took into consideration the\n\npetition for divorce filed by the appellant against the\n\nrespondent No. 2 in the year 2002 as well as other\n\ndocuments and without hearing either the\n\nrespondent No. 2 or her learned counsel, enlarged\n\nthe appellant on bail.\n\n6. Thereupon, the respondent No. 2 moved Criminal\n\nMiscellaneous No. 13 of 2003 in the Court of\n\nlearned District and Sessions Judge, Purnia for\n\ncancellation of bail. The learned Session Judge\n\nheard both the parties. It was noticed by him that\n\nthe bail application was submitted by the appellant\non the same day on which he had surrendered\n\nbefore the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First\n\nClass. It was further observed that after learning\n\nthat the original record was lying in Sessions Court,\n\nPurnia in connection with Criminal Revision No.\n\n233 of 2002, filed by the appellant and others for\n\nquashing issuance of summons, the learned\n\nMagistrate had passed an order calling for the\n\nrecord of the case from the Sessions Court. It was\n\nalso noticed that the learned Magistrate did not\n\nhear the learned counsel of the complainant and no\n\norder was passed by him fixing hearing of the bail\n\napplication, but bail was granted on the same day.\n\nIt was noted by the learned Sessions Judge that\n\nthough the complaint was filed by the respondent\n\nNo. 2 on October 9, 2002, the learned Magistrate\n\nhad taken into consideration divorce proceedings\n\ninitiated by the appellant in the year 2000, i.e., after\n\ntaking cognizance of the offence and had also relied\nupon other documents. Having taken into\n\nconsideration relevant circumstances emerging\n\nfrom the record of the case, the learned Sessions\n\nJudge concluded that the learned Magistrate had\n\nenlarged the appellant on bail on considerations\n\nother than judicial. Therefore, the learned Sessions\n\nJudge, by order dated January 8, 2004, allowed the\n\napplication filed by the respondent No. 2 and\n\ncancelled the bail granted to the appellant.\n\n7. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant moved High\n\nCourt of Judicature at Patna by way of filing\n\nCriminal Miscellaneous Application No. 2790 of\n\n2004. The learned Single Judge of the High Court\n\nhas rejected the application filed by the appellant\n\nvide judgment dated May 2, 2007, giving rise to the\n\ninstant appeal.\n8. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the\n\nparties and taken into consideration the documents\n\nforming part of the appeal.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that\n\ncancellation of bail can be only with reference to conduct\n\nsubsequent to release on bail and the supervening\n\ncircumstances. According to him an application for\n\ncancellation will not be maintainable with reference to\n\nwhat transpired prior to the grant of bail. He relied upon\n\nthe following observations in State of U.P. vs. Amarmani\n\nTripathi [(2005) 8 SCC 21], in support of the said\n\ncontention: -\n\n\"The decisions in\nDolat Ram v. State of\nHaryana\n[1995 (1) SCC 349] and\nSamarendranath Bhattacharjee v. State of West\nBengal [2004 (11) SCC 165] relate to\napplications for cancellation of bail and not\nappeals against orders granting bail. In an\napplication for cancellation, conduct\nsubsequent to release on bail and the\nsupervening circumstances alone are\nrelevant. But in an appeal against grant of\nbail, all aspects that were relevant under\n\nSection 439\nread with\nSection 437\n, continue to\nbe relevant. We, however, agree that while\nconsidering and deciding the appeals against\ngrant of bail, where the accused has been at\nlarge for a considerable time, the post-bail\nconduct and supervening circumstances will\nalso have to be taken note of. But they are not\nthe only factors to be considered as in the case\nof applications for cancellation of bail.\"\n\n[emphasis supplied]\n\nA careful reading of the said observations shows that\n\nwhile considering the factors relevant for consideration of\n\nbail already granted vis-`-vis the factors relevant for\n\nrejection of bail, this Court pointed out that for\n\ncancellation of bail, conduct subsequent to release on\n\nbail and supervening circumstances will be relevant. The\n\nsaid observations were not intended to restrict the power\n\nof a superior court to cancel bail in appropriate cases on\n\nother grounds. In fact it is now well settled that if a\n\nsuperior court finds that the court granting bail had\n\nacted on irrelevant material or if there was non-\n\napplication of mind or failure to take note of any\n\nstatutory bar to grant bail, or if there was manifest\nimpropriety as for example failure to hear the public\n\nprosecutor/complainant where required, an order for\n\ncancellation of bail can in fact be made. (See\nGajanand\n\nAgarwal v. State of Orissa\n[2006 (\n9) SCALE 378] and\n\nRizwan Akbar Hussain Syyed v. Mehmood Hussain\n[2007\n\n(10) SCC 368).\n\n2. Further, while cancelling bail, the superior Court\n\nwould be justified in considering the question\n\nwhether irrelevant material were taken into\n\nconsideration by the court granting bail.\n\n3. The facts of the present case indicate that the\n\nappellant himself and others had moved the Sessions\n\nCourt by way of filing revision for quashing summons\n\nissued by the learned Magistrate and, therefore, the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge had called for the record from\n\nthe court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class. On\n\nOctober 19, 2002, the appellant had, all of a sudden\n\ndecided to surrender before the learned Judicial\nMagistrate First Class, Purnia and presented a bail\n\napplication. The learned Magistrate found that the\n\nrecord of the case was lying in Sessions Court with\n\nreference to the revision, which was filed by the appellant\n\nand others. The learned Magistrate did not think it\n\nproper to wait at all and by passing a judicial order\n\ncalled for the record pending in a superior court. In view\n\nof the judicial order passed by the learned Magistrate,\n\nthe Registry of the Sessions Court forthwith sent the\n\nrecord of the case to the court of learned Judicial\n\nMagistrate First Class. Thereafter, the learned\n\nMagistrate proceeded to hear the bail application\n\nsubmitted by the appellant. In the order summoning the\n\nrecord, it was nowhere indicated by the learned\n\nMagistrate that the application submitted by the\n\nappellant would be heard on the same day, i.e., on\n\nOctober 19, 2002. The learned advocate for the\n\ncomplainant was not put on notice at all and, therefore,\n\ncould not remain present at the time when the bail\napplication was taken up for hearing. The learned\n\nMagistrate considered the documents produced by the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant. Admittedly those\n\ndocuments were subsequent in point of time to taking of\n\ncognizance. After considering those documents, the\n\nlearned Magistrate enlarged the appellant on bail. The\n\nundue haste exhibited by the learned Magistrate as well\n\nas his decision to hear the bail application on the same\n\nday without hearing the learned counsel for the\n\ncomplainant, compelled the learned Sessions Judge to\n\ndraw adverse inferences against the learned Magistrate.\n\nOn the facts and in the circumstances of the case, this\n\nCourt is of the opinion that the learned Sessions Judge\n\nwas justified in drawing adverse inferences against the\n\nlearned Magistrate and holding that the order granting\n\nbail was passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate for\n\nconsiderations other than judicial. This finding of fact\n\nhas been confirmed by the High Court in the following\n\nterms: -\n\"Heard the learned counsel for both the\nparties. Perused the complaint petition as well\nas the order of both the courts. There is no\ndoubt that the bail of the petitioner was\ngranted in a very mysterious circumstances.\nThe entire office as well as the Presiding\nOfficer was so in haste that all formalities\nincluding calling of the record from the\nSessions Court were done on the same day\nand the order of granting bail was also passed\non the same day behind the back of\ncomplainant's lawyer. The order of the learned\nlower court which runs in so many pages is\nsufficient to show how much the Presiding\nOfficer was interested to grant bail to the\npetitioner who is husband of the opposite part\nno. 2.\"\n\n2. The findings recorded by the learned Sessions\n\nJudge and the High Court make it clear that the\n\nlearned Magistrate had exercised discretion vested\n\nin him under\nSection 437\nwith oblique motive. The\n\nlearned Magistrate was apparently bent upon\n\ngranting bail to the appellant and, therefore, not\n\nonly decided to hear the bail application presented\n\nby the appellant on the same day, but had also\n\ncalled for record from the superior court and\ngranted bail to the appellant without hearing the\n\nlearned counsel for the complainant. As the\n\njudicial discretion was exercised by the learned\n\nJudicial Magistrate First Class in an arbitrary\n\nmanner and with oblique motives, the learned\n\nSessions Court was justified in setting aside the\n\norder granting bail to the appellant. To say the\n\nleast, the order passed by the learned Magistrate\n\nwas the result of arbitrary exercise of discretion\n\nvested in him. Further the learned Magistrate had\n\ntaken into consideration totally irrelevant\n\ndocuments which were never referred to in the\n\ncomplaint at all. By taking into consideration those\n\ndocuments the learned Magistrate exhibited his\n\nanxiety to release the appellant anyhow on bail. On\n\nthe facts and in the circumstances of the case, this\n\nCourt is of the opinion that the High Court did not\n\ncommit any error in confirming the order of the\n\nSessions Judge cancelling the bail which was\narbitrarily granted to the appellant by the learned\n\nJudicial Magistrate First Class and, therefore, the\n\ninstant appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n\n3. For the foregoing reasons the appeal fails and is\n\ndismissed.\n\n..............................J.\n[R.V. Raveendran]\n\n..............................J.\n[J.M.
