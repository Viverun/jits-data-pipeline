In this batch of writ petitions, broadly, the challenge has\n\nbeen made by the petitioners with regard to equation of posts and\n\ntheir seniority of the employees appointed under Swarna Jayanthi\n\nShahari Rojgar Yojana by the Department of Municipal\n\nAdministration with that of the employees of respondent-Bruhat\n\nBangalore Mahanagara Palike (for short, hereinafter referred to as\n\nBBMP) issued by the respondent-BBMP.\n\n2. For the sake of convenience, the employees of the erstwhile\n\nSJSRY scheme are referred to as petitioners and employees of the\n\nBBMP are referred as respondents.\n\n 45\n\n3. Facts in nutshell in these writ petitions are that, the State\n\nGovernment introduced a scheme called \"Swarna Jayathi Shahari\n\nRojgar Yogana (SJSRY) (hereinafter after referred as 'Scheme')\n\npursuant to the direction issued by Government of India, Ministry\n\nof Urban Affairs and Employment, New Delhi in the Urban Local\n\nBodies. In order to effectuate the SJSRY Scheme, applications\n\nhave been called for appointment to various posts. Petitioners in\n\nW.P.No.45646 of 2015, W.P.No.3830 of 2014, W.P.No.30020 of\n\n2014 and W.P.No.31115 of 2015 were appointed as Community\n\nOrganizers, Community Affairs Officers etc., after following the\n\nregular recruitment process. Thereafter, these petitioners entered\n\nservice of the Department of Municipal Administration under the\n\naforesaid Scheme. The State Government by notification dated\n\n28.10.2005, absorbed these petitioners into service as per\n\nKarnataka Municipalities (Absorption of Employees appointed\n\nunder the Scheme of Swarna Jayathi Shahari Rojgar Yojana\n\n(SJSRY) in Urban Local Bodies) Rules, 2005. These petitioners\n\nwere working in the Municipalities surrounding the City of\n\nBangalore. In the meanwhile, the State Government has issued\n\nnotification dated 16.01.2007, forming BBMP and included 07 City\n\n 46\n\nMunicipal Councils, 01 Town Municipal Council and 111 Urbanized\n\nVillages. These petitioners who were functioning as Community\n\nAffair Officers etc., in the merged 07 City Municipal Councils,\n\nwhich came under the Department of Municipal Administration,\n\nmerged with the services of BBMP, coming under the Department\n\nof Urban Development. In the meanwhile, State Government, by\n\nproceedings dated 13.07.2007, accepted the recommendation of\n\n5th Pay Commission and same was made applicable to the\n\npetitioners. It is also averred in these writ petitions that, the issue\n\nrelating to merger and conditions of service of erstwhile\n\nemployees of SJSRY Scheme along with the employees of BBMP\n\nwas considered by the State Government and Government Order\n\ndated 10.01.2011 was issued, taking into consideration the\n\nnomenclature and designation of the employees. In the\n\nmeanwhile, the Circular dated 12.01.2007 was issued by the State\n\nGovernment providing merger of employees of City Municipal\n\nCouncil into BBMP and same was challenged before this Court in\n\nW.P.No.8523 of 2007 and connected matters. This Court, by order\n\ndated 17.08.2010 allowed the writ petitions in part and the State\n\nGovernment was directed to commence the process of absorption\n\n 47\n\nand integration of employees of City Municipal Council and other\n\nlocal bodies into BBMP in the light of the judgment rendered by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharastra\n\nand another vs. Chandrakanth Ananth Kulkarni reported in\n\n(1981) 4 SCC 130. Pursuant to the same, State Government\n\nissued Government Order dated 10.01.2011, wherein, these\n\npetitioners were placed above the contesting respondents\n\n(employees of BBMP) by taking into consideration their entry into\n\nservice, during 2005 and as the contesting respondents entered\n\nthe service during 2007 onwards. Thereafter, the respondent-\n\nBBMP, by its letter proceedings dated 19.03.2011, discussed the\n\nmatter pertaining to seniority of its employees as well as the\n\nemployees who have been absorbed pursuant to the notification\n\ndated 16.01.2007 pursuant to the enlarging jurisdiction of\n\nBangalore Corporation as BBMP. In the said proceedings, decision\n\nwas taken to follow the Karnataka Civil Service (Seniority) Rules,\n\n1957 and accommodate these petitioners in their equivalent posts\n\nin the BBMP. Pursuant to the same, the respondent-BBMP has\n\nissued provisional Seniority list dated 12.05.2011 placing these\n\npetitioners above the contesting respondents herein. It is the\n\n 48\n\ncase of the petitioners that, the private respondents were persons\n\nlower in rank than that of the petitioners, as the petitioners\n\nentered service on 28.10.2005 and these private respondents\n\nentered service with effect from 17.12.2005, almost two months\n\nlater to that of these petitioners. The objections to the provisional\n\nlist was called for and as the petitioners were placed above the\n\ncontesting respondents, the petitioners have not filed objections.\n\nThereafter, the respondent-BBMP has issued Final Seniority list\n\ndated 30.09.2011 placing the petitioners above the contesting\n\nrespondents. When the things stood thus, the respondent-BBMP\n\nhas issued provisional Seniority List dated 16.08.2013, whereby\n\nthe petitioners were placed above the contesting respondents.\n\nSubsequently, the objections were called from the aggrieved\n\nparties. The petitioners have not filed objections as the Provisional\n\nSeniority list dated 16.08.2013 has been prepared as per law. It is\n\nthe case of these petitioners that, to the surprise, the respondent-\n\nBBMP has issued Final Seniority List dated 28.12.2013, based on\n\nthe legal opinion from the concerned section of BBMP, which\n\ndistorted the entire Seniority list and the petitioners were pushed\n\nback and placed below the contesting respondents. Feeling\n\n 49\n\naggrieved by the same, the petitioners have presented these writ\n\npetitions.\n\n4. In W.P.No.13970 of 2014 and W.P.No.13978 of 2014, the\n\npetitioners claim to be working at respondent-BBMP. It is the\n\ngrievance of these petitioners that, pursuant to the absorption of\n\nthe employees of Swarna Jayathi Shahari Rojgar Yojana in urban\n\nlocal bodies, subsequent to the Notification dated 16.01.2007 into\n\nthe service of the respondent-BBMP, the equation of posts which\n\nhas to be made on the basis of four criteria referred to in the\n\njudgment of G.Gopalaiah's case, has not been considered, in the\n\nright perspective. It is the case of the petitioners that, while\n\ndoing the equation of posts, the basis of salary would have given\n\neffect to as the salaries of petitioners is higher and no way\n\nequivalent to salary of the employees of SJSRY and accordingly,\n\nsought for interference of this Court, challenging the order dated\n\n18.06.2012 issued by the respondent-BBMP. It is the categorical\n\ncontention of the petitioners that, the equating of the post of\n\nCommunity Affairs Officers with that of the post of Manager in the\n\nrespondent-BBMP is contrary to law and therefore, the petitioners\n\n 50\n\nsought for setting-aside the order passed by the respondent-BBMP\n\nwith regard to equation of the posts.\n\n5. I have heard Sri Jayakumar S.Patil, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of Sri Pruthvi Wodeyar for the petitioners in\n\nW.P.45646-50 of 2015; Sri P.S. Rajgopal, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of Smt M.L.Suvarna Lakshmi,\n\nSri.K.Puttegowda and Sri Jayanth Dev Kumar for the petitioners in\n\nW.P No.3830 of 2014. Further, heard W.P.No.31115 of 2015; Sri\n\nVedamurthy, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in\n\nW.P.No.30020 of 2014 and Sri T.P.Vivekananda, learned counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioners in W.P.No.13970 of 2014 and\n\nW.P.No.13978 of 2014 and Sri N. Kumar, learned Additional\n\nGovernment Advocate for respondent-State. Sri M.A.Subramani,\n\nSri K.N.Puttegowda and Sri S.H.Prashantha, learned counsel\n\nappearing for the respondent-BBMP.\n\n6. Sri Jayakumar S.Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe petitioners in W.P.No.45646 of 2015 argued that, the\n\npetitioners have been absorbed as per notification dated\n\n28.10.2005 and thereafter, pursuant to the notification dated\n\n 51\n\n16.01.2007, the petitioners were inducted into respondent-BBMP.\n\nHe further contended that, the petitioners were senior most\n\nemployees in respondent-BBMP and the ranking has been\n\ndisturbed by issuing the impugned Final Seniority list and\n\naccordingly, he sought for interference of this Court. He further\n\ncontended that, the petitioners were placed in the pay scale of\n\nRs.7275-13350 on acceptance of 5th Pay Commission and the\n\npetitioners were absorbed into service much earlier, to that of the\n\ncontesting respondents herein (employees of BBMP) and\n\ntherefore, as per Rule 6 of the of the Seniority Rules, the\n\ndeterminative factor would be the length of service in the case of\n\nabsorption in public interest and said aspect has not been\n\nconsidered by the respondent-BBMP while altering the ranking\n\nassigned to the petitioners. He further contended that, the\n\nobjections filed by the petitioners has not been considered by the\n\nrespondent-BBMP in the right perspective, before issuing the order\n\nof Final Seniority List. Accordingly, he sought for interference of\n\nthis court.\n\n 52\n\n7. Sri P.S Rajgopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners in W.P.No.3830 of 2014 and W.P.No.31115 of 2015\n\nargued that, the impugned Final Seniority List has been passed by\n\nthe respondent-BBMP which unsettled the entire seniority list as\n\nwell as the respondent-BBMP has not obeyed order passed in\n\nW.P.No.8523 of 2007 dated 17.08.2010 whereby, the four\n\nguidelines laid down by this Court relating to determine the\n\nseniority between the employees of the respondent-BBMP and the\n\nemployees of erstwhile SJSRY Scheme - petitioners herein and\n\nhave not been given effect to the said order. It is the categorical\n\nsubmission of Sri P.S. Rajagopal, learned Senior Counsel that, the\n\nimpugned Seniority List issued by the respondent-BBMP is\n\ncontrary to Government order dated 10.01.2011. Referring to the\n\nfour reasons said to have been made in the aforesaid Government\n\norder, he argued that, the petitioners herein have been absorbed\n\ninto service on 16.01.2007, and much before appointment of the\n\ncontesting respondents. The petitioners have been absorbed as\n\nper Government Order dated 28.10.2005 and therefore, he\n\ncontended that, the Rule 6 of the Karnataka Civil Services\n\n(Seniority) Rules, 1957 has not been considered while issuing the\n\n 53\n\nimpugned Seniority List and therefore, he sought for interference\n\nof this Court.\n\n8. Nextly, referring to the report of the legal section, Sri\n\nP.S.Rajgopal, learned Senior Counsel emphasized on reference\n\nNo.9 in the impugned Final Seniority List and contended that, the\n\ndecision taken by the respondent-BBMP distorts the entire settled\n\nprinciple in law and accordingly, he sought for interference of this\n\nCourt. \nIn this regard, he refers to the judgment of the Division\n\nBench of this Court in the case of \nRAMASWAMY G.T. VS. STATE\n\nOF KARNATAKA\n reported in (1986) 1 KLJ 1. Referring to\n\nparagraphs 22, 23 and 40, Sri P.S. Rajagopal, learned Senior\n\nCounsel argued that, the impugned Final Seniority List would lead\n\nto disastrous results as observed by this Court in identical\n\nmatters. He also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt, in the case of STATE OF GUJARAT AND ANOTHER VS.\n\nRAMAN LAL KESHAV LAL SONI AND OTHERS reported in\n\n(1983) 2 SCC 33 and argued that, placing the contesting\n\nrespondents, who are the employees of respondent-BBMP above\n\nthe petitioners is contrary to the declaration of law made by the\n\n 54\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court. He also refers to the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nUNION OF INDIA AND\n\nOTHERS VS. ATHUL SHUKLA AND OTHERS\n reported in (2014)\n\n10 SCC 432 and argued that, birth mark of public servants are\n\nobliterated on entry into common pool and therefore, the\n\ndeterminative factor in the common pool will be their entry into\n\nservice and therefore, sought for interference of this Court. He\n\nfurther contended that pursuant to, publication of provisional list,\n\nreceiving objections from the contesting respondents and based\n\non their objections the impugned Final Seniority List is announced.\n\nIn this regard, he submitted that, the respondent-BBMP, before\n\naltering the ranking of the petitioners by keeping the petitioners\n\nbelow the contesting respondent herein, ought to have heard the\n\npetitioners herein, and therefore, the impugned Final Seniority\n\nList is liable to be quashed in all respects as the same is suffers\n\nfrom legal infirmity. Sri. P.S. Rajgopal, learned Senoir Counsel\n\nsubmitted that, the impugned gradation list is contrary to the\n\norder dated 10.01.2011, which has reached finality and the\n\nprinciple of equation of posts determined by this court in G.\n\n 55\n\nGOPALIAH'S case has not been appreciated by the respondent-\n\nBBMP and accordingly, he sought for interference of this Court.\n\n9. Sri P.S. Rajagopal, learned Senior Counsel invited the\n\nattention to the order dated 09.09.2015 passed by the\n\nrespondent-BBMP produced at Annexure-Q in W.P.No.45646-50 of\n\n2015 and contended that, while regularizing the provisional list of\n\nSeniority, the respondent-BBMP, has not considered the letter\n\ndated 27.03.2015, (Annexure-M) and argued that, the State\n\nGovernment has categorically stated that while determining the\n\nseniority, the observations made in the Government order dated\n\n10.01.2011 alone is the basis for formal absorption and placement\n\nof the petitioners in the respective cadre to be taken into\n\nconsideration. In this regard, he refers to the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SUB- INSPECTOR\n\nROOPLAL AND ANOTHER VS. LT. GOVERNOR THROUGH\n\nCHIEF SECRETARY, DELHI AND OTHERS, reported in (2000)\n\n1 SCC 644 and contended that, the equivalent cadre has to be\n\nconsidered in tune with the length of service in the parent\n\nDepartment. He also refers to judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n 56\n\nCourt in the case of STATE OF ASSAM AND ANOTHER VS.\n\nRAGHAVA RAJGOPALACHARI, reported in (1972) SLR 915\n\nand RAMESH RANGASHAMAIAH VS. THE STATE OF\n\nKARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in 2013 (4) AKR 787.\n\nPlacing reliance on the aforesaid judgments, he argued that, while\n\nconsidering the equivalency of two posts, the pay is least criterion\n\nto be considered and the nature of duties, responsibilities and\n\nminimum qualification etc., are the vital factors to be accepted.\n\nHence, Sri P.S. Rajgopal, learned Senior Counsel sought for\n\nsetting-aside the impugned Final Seniority List.\n\n10. Sri M.V. Veda Murthy, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioner in W.P.No.30020 of 2014 contended that, the Seniority\n\nList dated 26.12.2013 issued by the respondent-BBMP is contrary\n\nto law as the persons already in service are transferred from one\n\nDepartment to another Department to a equivalent post and the\n\nsaid exercise has been made in the public interest. Accordingly, he\n\nsought for direction to the respondent-BBMP to re-determine the\n\nSeniority List in accordance with the provisions contained under\n\nthe Karnataka Civil Servants (Seniority) Rules, 1957.\n\n 57\n\n11. Sri T.P. Vivekananda, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners in W.P.Nos.13970 of 2014 and 13978 of 2014,\n\n(Employees of BBMP) argued that, equation of posts of\n\nCommunity Affairs Officers with that of the Manager post in the\n\nrespondent-BBMP is contrary to law as the respondent-BBMP has\n\nnot considered the nature and responsibility of posts, powers to\n\nbe exercised by such officers vis-a-vis the minimum qualification\n\nrequired for those posts are different and as such, he submitted\n\nthat, the equation of posts categorized by the respondent-BBMP is\n\nincorrect. He also referred to the pay scale of the employees of\n\nthe respondent-BBMP and the employees of erstwhile SJSRY\n\nScheme and argued that, the salary of Community Affairs Officers\n\ncould not have been equated even to the post of First Division\n\nAssistant of respondent-BBMP and therefore, sought for\n\ninterference of this Court.\n\n12. Sri M.A. Subramani and Sri K.N. Puttegowda, learned\n\ncounsels appearing for the respondent-BBMP sought to justify the\n\nimpugned orders passed by the respondent-BBMP with regard to\n\nequation of posts as well as the impugned Final Seniority List. It is\n\n 58\n\ntheir categorical submission that, the respondent-BBMP, after\n\nconsidering the factual aspects on record, has arrived at a\n\nconclusion which cannot be disturbed in these petitions.\n\n13. Sri M.S. Nagaraja, learned Additional Government Advocate\n\nappearing for the respondent-Government argued in similar lines\n\nwith learned counsel appearing for respondent-BBMP and\n\nsubmitted that, the absorption of the employees from SJSRY\n\nScheme is much earlier to the employees of respondent-BBMP and\n\naccordingly, he submitted that, the Seniority List has to be\n\nprepared in terms of the provisions of Section 6 of Karnataka Civil\n\nServants (Seniority) Rules, 1957.\n\n14. In reply to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the respondents, Sri Jayakumar S. Patil, learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing for the petitioners (Employees of\n\nerstwhile SJSRY scheme) contended that, the writ petition filed by\n\nthe employees of the BBMP is not maintainable as the petitioners\n\nin W.P.No.45646 of 2015 were appointed on 16.01.2007 and the\n\npetitioners in W.P.No.13970 of 2014 and in W.P.No.13978 of 2014\n\nwere appointed on 25.06.2007 and the said aspect of the matter\n\n 59\n\nrelating to appointment of the petitioners in W.P.No.45646 of\n\n2015 was challenged before this Court in W.P.No.20055-64 of\n\n2010 and this Court by order dated 26.08.2011, dismissed the\n\nwrit petition. Sri Jayakumar S. Patil, learned Senior Counsel also\n\nsubmitted that, the argument advanced by Sri T.P. Vivekananda,\n\njustifying the impugned Seniority List cannot be accepted on the\n\nsimple ground that, the respondent-BBMP has considered the\n\nlength of service of respective employees as well as equivalence of\n\npost based on pay scale of the employees of SJSRY scheme and\n\nthe employees of respondent-BBMP. In this regard, Sri Jayakumar\n\nS. Patil, learned Senior Counsel contended that, the criterion for\n\npromotion is the date of appointment by the employees of the\n\nSGSRY scheme and not as contended by Sri T.P. Vivekananada as\n\nthe Government order dated 03.06.2010 wherein 5th Pay\n\nCommission was recommended to the employees of erstwhile\n\nSJSRY Scheme.\n\n15. In the light of the submission made by the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the parties, the facts are not disputed. The\n\npetitioners in W.P.No.45646 of 2015, W.P.No.3830 of 2014,\n\n 60\n\nW.P.No.30020 of 2014 and W.P.No.31115 of 2015 were appointed\n\ninitially as per the scheme evolved by State Government called as\n\n\"Swarna Jayanthi Shahari Rojgar Yogana (SJSRY), pursuant to the\n\ndirection issued by Government of India, Ministry of Urban Affairs\n\nand Employment, New Delhi in the Urban Local Bodies. In order to\n\neffectuate the said scheme, applications have been called for\n\nappointing various post under the scheme. The petitioners were\n\nappointed and later absorbed as Community Organizers,\n\nCommunity Affairs Officers etc., after following the regular\n\nrecruitment process, as per notification dated 28.10.2005. In\n\nW.P.No.13970 of 2014 and W.P.No.13978 of 2014, the petitioners\n\nare the employees of respondent-BBMP.\n\n16. It is the grievance of the petitioners, who were employed\n\nunder the scheme that, they have been merged with the service\n\nconditions of the employees of respondent-BBMP as per\n\nGovernment order dated 10.01.2011, however, such employees of\n\nthe scheme, though placed above the employees of the\n\nrespondent-BBMP till the passing of provisional list dated\n\n16.08.2013 however, they have been placed below the employees\n\n 61\n\nof the respondent-BBMP pursuant to the impugned Seniority List\n\nissued on 28.12.2013.\n\n17. The core question to be answered in these writ petitions is,\n\nwhether the Final Seniority List dated 28.01.2013 is sustainable\n\nunder law or not?. Petitioners are appointed by the State\n\nGovernment for the purpose of effectuating the SJSRY scheme in\n\nurban local bodies on contract basis, fixing the consolidated pay\n\nand these petitioners entered service in the Department of\n\nMunicipal Administration as Community Organizers/ Community\n\nAffairs Officers, etc. These petitioners have been appointed by the\n\nGovernment through regular process of selection in the said\n\nDepartment. These petitioners were absorbed into service of the\n\nState Government as per Notification dated 28.10.2005 as per the\n\nSwarna Jayanthi Sahari Rojgar Yojana (SJSRY) in Urban Local\n\nBodies Rules, 2005. In the meanwhile, the Government has\n\nissued Notification dated 16.01.2007, declaring the local area\n\naround the Bengaluru, restructuring of merger of 110 villages, 7\n\nCity Municipal Councils and one Town Municipal Council into\n\nBruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. The petitioners herein were\n\n 62\n\nfunctioning in the 7 merged City Municipal Councils, and their\n\nservices were taken into the newly formed Bruhat Bengaluru\n\nMahanagara Palike as per Notification dated 10.01.2011. The said\n\nNotification was issued pursuant to the judgment of this Court in\n\nWrit Petition No.8523 of 2007 decided on 17.08.2010. Paragraphs\n\n9 to 15 reads as under:\n\n 9. The grievance of the petitioners is that in to give effect\n to the merger, a decision was taken to reckon the\n payscales as criteria and work out the formula for fitment\n of officers and officials. In the meeting held on 2.9.2008, it\n was decided to fix the seniority of the employees absorbed\n as per Rule 6 of the K.C.S (Seniorities) Rules, 1957. In the\n meeting held on 30.01.2009 the Committee constituted for\n integrating the employees, post merger, from the CMC's\n and other Local Bodies notices difference between the posts\n and pay scales in the Karnataka Municipalities (Recruitment\n of officers and employees) Rules 2004 and the City of\n Bangalore Municipality Corporation Services (General Cadre\n and Recruitment Regulation), 1971 by reasons of which\n difficulty having arises in absorption, decided to effect\n absorption on the basis of the original pay scale of the\n post. Hence, the petition for the relief fo the a writ of\n prohibition prohibiting the second respondent BBMP from\n publishing the list of officers of the servants CMCs, TMCs\n and Grama Panchayat to be absorbed it the service of\n BBMP in the absence of provisions made in that behalf\n\n 63\n\nunder the Act and for a writ of certiorari to quash the\nproceeding dated 08.09.2008 Annexure C and 30.01.2009\nAnnexure D.\n\n10. Petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 1352-53/10, claim to\nbe appointees under the second respondent BBMP. This\npetition is preferred, aggrieved by the decision taken in the\nproceedings dated 31.01.2009 in the matter of merger of\nemployees of City Municipality Council into BBMP, in so far\nas it relates to the publication of the gradation list within 30\ndays and to withdraw all the promotions made on and after\n16.01.2007 by the second respondent and not to effect any\npromotion until merger process is competed; the decision\ntaken by the first respondent and directions issued as per\nAnnexure F and for a mandamus to respondent 2 and 3, to\nconsider the case of promotion to Revenue Inspector Grade\nII. The BBMP is said to have issued and order dated\n\n10.05.2010 effecting promotions to petitioners and others\nsubject to the result of the writ petition.\n\n11. Having heard Sri V. Lakshminarayana, learned Counsel\nfor the first batch of petitioners, Sri P.S. Manjunath,\nlearned Counsel for the second batch of petitioners and Sri\nS.B. Mukannappa, learned Counsel for the third batch of\npetitioners, indisputedly on the merger of the various Local\nBodies referred to supra into the larger Urban Local Body to\nconstitute the BBMP under the 'Act', involves integration of\nthe said Local Bodies into the BBMP.\n\n 64\n\n12. Learned Counsel for the petitioners are correct in their\nsubmission that consequence of merger and the effect of\nabsorption requires to be regulated in terms of Section 501\nand 501(1) of the Act. The statue admittedly does not\nprovide for the principles governing absorption of the\nemployees on integration and merger. It is needless to\nstate that the BBMP is required to adhere to the well\nestablished principles laid down by the Apex Court in the\nState of Maharashtra VS Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni\nreported in 1981 (4) SCC 130 and as extracted in \nS.P.\nShivaprasad Pipal Vs. Union of India & others\n at para 5,\nwhich is reads thus:\n\n \n\"However, when different cadres are merged\n certain principles have to be borne in mind. These\n principles were enunciated in the case of \nState of\n Maharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni (SCR\n at\n P. 678) while considering the question of integration\n of government servants allotted to the services of\n the new States when the different States of India\n were reorganized. This court oted with approval the\n principles which had been formulated for effecting\n integration of services of different States. These\n principles are; In the matter equation of posts, (1)\n where there were regularly constituted similar cadres\n in the different integrating units the cadres will\n ordinarily be integrated on the basis but (2) where\n there no such similar cadres, the following factors\n will be taken into consideration in determining the\n equation of posts:\n\n 65\n\n (a) Nature and duties of a post;\n\n (b) Powers exercised by the officers holding a\n post, the extent of territorial or other\n charge held or responsibilities discharged;\n\n (c) The minimum qualification, if any prescribed\n for recruitment to the post and;\n\n (d) The salary of the post.\n\n This Court further observed that it is not open to\n the court to consider whether the equation of posts\n made by the Central Government is right or wrong.\n This was a matter exclusively within the province of\n the Central Government. perhaps the only question\n the court can enquire into is whether the four\n principles cited above had been properly taken into\n account. This is the narrow and limited field within\n which the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court can\n operate.\"\n\n13. Learned Counsel are further correct in their submission\nthat the committee constituted to carry out the absorption\nconsidered only one principle i.e., the salary of the post\nand did not consider three other principles referred to\nsupra, as is animated in the proceedings of the meeting\ndated 08.09.2008; and 30.01.2009, and 31.01.2009. Thus\nthe said decisions cannot but be said to be inconsistent\nwith the principles \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court. Sri B. V.\nMuralidhar, and Sri K.N.Puttegowda, learned Counsel for\nthe respondent- BBMP would not seriously contest the\n\n 66\n\nsubmission of the learned counsel for the petitioners. That\nthe decision making authority did not take into\nconsideration all the four principles \nlaid down in\n the case of\nState of Maharashtra, in the matter of integration and\nabsorption of employees, cannot be disputed.\n\n14. Thus, the promotions effected in respect of employees\nrequires reconsideration after completion of the process of\nabsorption and integration, and during the interregnum the\norder dated 10.05.2010 promoting petitioners in W.P.Nos.\n1352-53 of 2010 and others are directed not to be\ndisturbed.\n\n15. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed in part. The\nproceedings of the meeting dated 08.09.2008 and\n30.01.2009 Annexures C and D in Writ petition Nos. 12244-\n46 of 2010 and the proceeding dated 31.10.2009 Annexure\nF in writ petition Nos.1352-53/2010 are quashed. The first\nrespondent- State is directed to commence the process of\nabsorption and integration of the employees of the CMC,\nand other local bodies referred to in the notification supra,\ninto BBMP by following all the four principles enunciated by\nthe Apex Court in \nState of Maharashtra\n case extracted\nsupra. In the light of the fact that the absorption is of the\nyear 2007 and three years have gone by there is no reason\nto prolong the matter any further and hence the State is\ndirected to should conclude the proceedings within six\nmonths.\"\n\n 67\n\n18. Perusal of the aforementioned order would indicate that, this\n\nCourt has directed the State Government to complete the process\n\nof absorption and integration of the employees of erstwhile City\n\nMunicipal Council, now inducted into Bruhat Bengaluru\n\nMahanagara Palike in terms of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of STATE OF MAHARASTRA vs.\n\nCHANDRAKANT ANANT KULKARNI reported in (1981) 4 SCC\n\n130 and complete the entire process within six months.\n\nReference No.20 in the Notification dated 10.01.2011 refers to the\n\naforementioned judgment. At this juncture, it is relevant to\n\nextract, Rule 6 of the Karnataka Government Servants (Seniority)\n\nRules, 1957 provides as follows:\n\n 6. The transfer of a person in public interest from one class\n or grade of a service to another class or grade carrying the\n same pay or scale of pay shall not be treated as first\n appointment to the later for purposes of seniority; and the\n seniority of a person so transferred shall be determined\n with reference to his first appointment to the class or grade\n from which he was transferred;\n\n Provided that, where the transfer is made at the request of\n the officer, he shall be placed in the seniority list of the\n class or grade of service to which he is transferred below all\n\n 68\n\n the officers borne on that class or grade of service on or\n before the date of the transfer.\n\n [Provided further, that the seniority of a person transferred\n in public interest vis a vis the persons actually holding the\n post in the Class or Grade to which he is transferred shall\n be determined on the date of such transfer with reference\n to his first appointment to the class or grade from which\n he was transferred.]\n\n Explanation.- For the purpose of the above proviso, the\n persons actually holding the post do not include the\n persons who have before the date of such transfer been\n promoted, whether in an officiating or substantive capacity\n to a higher class or grade.\n\n19. Applying the Rule 6 of aforementioned Rules, 1957 to the\n\ncase on hand would make pave for absorption in the public\n\ninterest and the date of seniority of such employees would be\n\ncount from the date of absorption as per Notification dated\n\n28.10.2005.

The aforementioned proceedings dated 19.03.2011 was\n\nconcluded with the decision, taken by the elite personnel of the\n\nrespondent-BBMP, namely, Special Commissioner, Deputy\n\nCommissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Head of the Legal Cell,\n\nChief Accounts Officer and Assistant Commissioner (Admin-1). It\n\nis also not disputed that the respondent-BBMP, by office order\n\ndated 26.04.2012, notified a Provisional Seniority List in the cadre\n\nof First Division Assistant/Second Division Assistant, integrating\n\nthe cadre of petitioners as well as the private respondents herein.\n\nIn the said office order dated 26.04.2012, the date of entry into\n\nservice of the petitioners was shown as 28.10.2005 and that of\n\nthe private respondents as 13.01.2006 and subsequent dates. The\n\n 70\n\nsaid Notification is issued at the hands of the Commissioner,\n\nBruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Thereafter, the respondent-\n\nBBMP has issued one more office order dated 18.06.2012,\n\nwherein, in unequivocal terms, it is stated that the seniority of the\n\nemployees under SJSRY scheme, absorbed as per Notification\n\ndated 28.10.2005 shall be merged into respective equivalent\n\ncadre of BBMP and their seniority shall be countered from the date\n\nof their entry as per absorption made, by Notification dated\n\n28.10.2005. Thereafter, the respondent-BBMP has issued Final\n\nSeniority List in the cadre of First Division Assistant, after\n\nconsidering the objections filed to the Provisional Seniority List,\n\nwhich was notified on 24.06.2012 and in the said Seniority List,\n\nthe rank of the private respondents was placed below the\n\npetitioners herein. The said aspect has been approved and\n\ndecision was taken by the respondent-BBMP as per office order\n\ndated 18.06.2012. It is also not disputed by the parties that, the\n\nSeniority List dated, 28.12.2013 issued by the respondent-BBMP,\n\nsettling the Seniority of the integrated list of petitioners and\n\nprivate respondents. However, having done so, the respondent-\n\nBBMP sought for clarification with the Director of Municipal\n\n 71\n\nAdministration as per letter dated 08.08.2014 with regard to\n\nconsideration of merger of the posts on pay scale and protection\n\nof seniority of the petitioners in terms of statutory rules. In this\n\nregard, the respondent-Government in this categorical way\n\nconveyed to the respondent-BBMP that, the pay scale is not a\n\ncriterion to fix the seniority and therefore, directed the\n\nrespondent-BBMP to conform to Rule 6 of the Karnataka Civil\n\nServices (Seniority Rules) 1957. It is suffice to say that, the\n\nGovernment in its letter dated 27.03.2015, addressed to the\n\nCommissioner, BBMP, to follow the Government order dated\n\n10.01.2011, insofar as equivalent of posts and preparation of the\n\nSeniority List. the relevant portion of the letter dated 27.03.2015,\n\nreads as under:\n\n \"(5) ¥Á°PÉAiÀÄÄ ¸ÀPÁðgÀPÉÌ ¸À°è¹gÀÄªÀ PÀgÀqÀÄ ªÀÈAzÀ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw\n ¤AiÀÄªÀÄUÀ¼ÀÄ E£ÀÆß ¥Àj²Ã®£ÉAiÀÄ°èzÀÄÝ, PÀgÀqÀÄ ªÀÈAzÀ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw\n ¤AiÀÄªÀÄUÀ¼ÀÄ CAwªÀÄUÉÆ¼Àî®Ä ¸ÁPÀµÀÄÖ ¸ÀªÀÄAiÀiÁªÀPÁ±À ¨ÉÃPÁVgÀÄvÀÛzÉ.\n\n DzÀÄzÀjAzÀ, PÀgÀqÀÄ ªÀÈAzÀ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ¤AiÀÄªÀÄUÀ¼À°è ¥Àæ¸ÁÛ¦¹gÀÄªÀ\n ºÀÄzÉÝUÀ¼À JzÀÄj£À°è FUÀ ¥Àæ¸ÁÛ¦¸À¯ÁVgÀÄªÀ ¸ÀªÀÄÄzÁAiÀÄ ¸ÀAWÀl£Á¢üPÁjUÀ¼ÀÄ\n ªÀÄvÀÄÛ ¸ÀªÀÄÄzÁAiÀÄ ¸ÀAWÀlPÀgÀÄUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ¥ÀjUÀtÂ¸À®Ä CªÀPÁ±À E®èzÉÃ\n EgÀÄªÀÅzÀjAzÀ, ¢£ÁAPÀ: 10.01.2011 gÀ ¸ÀPÁðj DzÉÃ±ÀzÀ°è «¢ü¹gÀÄªÀ\n µÀgÀwÛ£ÀAvÉAiÉÄÃ PÀæªÀÄªÀ»¸À¨ÉÃPÉAzÀÄ vÀªÀÄUÉ w½¸À®Ä £Á£ÀÄ ¤zÉÃð²¸À®ànÖzÉÝÃ£É.\"\n\n 72\n\n21. Despite these directions have been issued by the State\n\nGovernment, the respondent-BBMP has issued the Provisional List,\n\ndated 16.07.2015, without considering the said direction and\n\nopinion of the Government vide letter dated 27.03.2015. Be that\n\nas it may be, the respondent-BBMP without following the direction\n\nissued by the State Government, behaved like a extraordinary\n\nentity, in not conforming to the Rule 6 of Karnataka State Civil\n\nService (Seniority) Rules, 1957, issued office order dated\n\n09.09.2015, which is contrary to Government order dated\n\n10.01.2011, and further, such act is in contravention of their own\n\nproceedings dated 19.03.2011, 18.06.2012 and 26.12.2013 as\n\nwell as the noting of the respondent-Government dated\n\n20.02.2015, and letter dated 27.03.2015, wherein, as mentioned\n\nabove, the Government has directed the respondent-BBMP to\n\nconform to the conditions stipulated in the Government order\n\ndated 10.01.2011. This act of the respondent-BBMP, is a clear\n\nviolation of, not only its own orders but also the Government\n\norders mentioned above. It is also made clear that, the said order\n\ndated 09.09.2015, fixing the seniority, placing the private\n\n 73\n\nrespondents herein above the petitioners herein, is contrary to the\n\njudgment of this Court in \nG.Gopalaiah\n's case supra.\n\n22. At this juncture, it is relevant to cite the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench in the case of Ramesh Rangashamaiah (supra)\n\nand paragraphs 49 and 51 of the said judgment reads as under:\n\n \"49. What emerges from the aforesaid judgments is, it is\n well settled that equation of posts and determination of pay\n scales is the primary function of the executive and not the\n judiciary. Equivalency of two posts is not judged by the\n sole fact of equal pay. While determining the equation of\n two posts many factors other than pay will have to be\n taken into consideration, like the nature of duties,\n responsibilities, minimum qualification etc. Treating certain\n posts as equated posts or equal status posts, it is not\n necessary that the holders of these posts must perform\n completely the same functions or that the sources of\n recruitment to the posts must be the same nor is it\n essential that qualifications for appointments to the posts\n must be identical. All that is reasonably required is that\n there must not be such difference in the pay-scales or\n qualifications of the incumbents of the posts concerned or\n in their duties or responsibilities or regarding any other\n relevant factor that it would be unjust to treat the posts\n alike. In other words, that posts having substantially higher\n pay-scales or status in service or carrying substantially\n\n 74\n\nhigher responsibilities and duties or otherwise distinctly\nsuperior are not equated with posts carrying much lower\npay-scales or substantially lower responsibilities and duties\nor enjoying much lower status in service. Broadly stated,\nfour factors have to be taken into consideration while\ndetermining the equation of two posts. They are:\n\n(i) the nature and duties of a post,\n\n(ii) the responsibilities and powers exercised by the officer\nholding a post; the extent of territorial or other charge\nheld or responsibilities discharged;\n\n(iii) the minimum qualifications, if any, prescribed for\nrecruitment to the post; and\n\n(iv) the salary of the post.\n\n51. Once the declaration of equivalence is made on a\nproper application of mind to the nature and responsibilities\nof the functions and duties attached to the post, then scope\nof interference in such a declaration is very much limited.\nThe Court would be slow to interfere with the declaration of\nequivalence made by the Government. The Government\nwould ordinarily be the best judge to evaluate and compare\nthe nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties\nattached to different posts with a view to determining\nwhether or not they are equivalent in status and\nresponsibility. Therefore, ordinarily Courts do not enter\nupon the task of job evaluation which is generally left to\n\n 75\n\nexpert bodies as several factors have to be kept in view\nwhile evolving a pay structure. Being a complex matter, the\nCourt will interfere only if there is cogent material on\nrecord to come to a firm conclusion that a grave error has\ncrept in such an exercise and Court's interference is\nabsolutely necessary to undo the injustice being caused. It\nis not for this Court to sit over their decision like a Court of\nappeal. The administrative authorities have experience in\nadministration, and the Court must respect this, and should\nnot interfere readily with administrative decisions. When\nthe Government has declared equivalence after proper\napplication of mind to the relevant factors, then Court\nwould be most reluctant to venture into the uncharted and\nunfamiliar field of administration and examine the\ncorrectness of the declaration of equivalence made by the\nGovernment where it appears to the Court that the\ndeclaration of equivalence is made without application of\nmind to the nature and responsibilities of the functions and\nduties attached to the non-cadre post or extraneous or\nirrelevant factors are taken into account in determining the\nequivalence or the nature and responsibilities of the\nfunctions and duties of the two posts are so dissimilar that\nno reasonable man can possibly say that they are\nequivalent in status and responsibility or the declaration of\nequivalence is mala fide or is colourable exercise of power,\nthe Court can and certainly would set at naught the\ndeclaration of equivalence and afford protection to the civil\nservant.\"\n\n 76\n\n23. I am also fortified by the declaration of law made by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case \nDHOLE GOVIND SAHEBRAO\n\nAND OTHERS VS. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n reported in\n\n(2015) 6 SCC 727. Paragraphs 31 to 40 of \nthe said judgment\n\nreads as under:\n\n \"31. We shall now venture to deal with another aspect of\n the matter, emerging out of the impugned order passed by\n the High Court. The conclusions drawn by the High Court,\n as have been recorded in para 46 of the impugned\n judgment and order dated 13-4-2007 emerged out of a\n consideration which was noticed in paras 38 to 45. Paras\n 38 and 43 to 46 of the impugned judgment and order, have\n already been extracted hereinabove. A perusal of the above\n consideration reveals, that the High Court was swayed by\n the co-incidental prejudice suffered by the erstwhile\n members of the Ministerial Cadre, resulting in lost chances\n of promotion. The aforesaid consideration could have been\n justified only if chances of promotion are treated as\n conditions of service. Insofar as the instant aspect of the\n matter is concerned, this Court has repeatedly examined\n the issue whether chances of promotion constitute\n conditions of service. In this behalf, reference may be\n made to a few judgments rendered by this Court.\n\n \n32. First of all, we may advert to the decision rendered by\n this Court in \nState of Maharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant\n\n 77\n\nKulkarni\n, wherein a three-Judge Bench of this Court held as\nunder : (SCC pp. 141-42, para 16)\n\n \"16.Mere chances of promotion are not conditions of\n service and the fact that there was reduction in the\n chances of promotion did not tantamount to a change in\n the conditions of service. A right to be considered for\n promotion is a term of service, but mere chances of\n promotion are not. Under the Departmental Examination\n Rules for STOs, 1954, framed by the former State\n Government of Madhya Pradesh, as amended on 20-1-\n 1960, mere passing of the departmental examination\n conferred no right on the STIs of Bombay, to promotion.\n By passing the examination, they merely became\n eligible for promotion. They had to be brought on to a\n select list not merely on the length of service, but on\n the basis of merit-cum-seniority principle. It was,\n therefore, nothing but a mere chance of promotion. In\n consequence of the impugned orders of reversion, all\n that happened is that some of the STIs, who had\n wrongly been promoted as STOs Grade III had to be\n reverted and thereby lost a few places. In contrast, the\n conditions of service of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh\n and Hyderabad, at least so far as one stage of\n promotion above the one held by them before the\n reorganisation of States, could not be altered without\n the previous sanction of the Central Government as \nlaid\n down in\n the proviso to sub-section (7) of Section 115 of\n the Act.\"\n\n 78\n\n33. Reference may also be made to the decision of this\nCourt in \nPaluru Ramkrishnaiah v. Union of India\n wherein a\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court held as under : (\nSCC pp.\n552 & 554, paras 12 & 15)\n\n \"12.In Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar [Ramchandra\n Shankar Deodhar v. State of Maharashtra\n, the\n petitioners and other allocated Tahsildars from ex-\n Hyderabad State had under the notification of the Raj\n Pramukh dated 15-9-1955 all the vacancies in the posts\n of Deputy Collector in the ex-Hyderabad State available\n to them for promotion but under subsequent rules of\n 30-7-1959, 50 per cent of the vacancies were to be\n filled by direct recruitment and only the remaining 50\n per cent were available for promotion and that too on\n divisional basis. The effect of this change obviously was\n that now only 50 per cent vacancies in the post of\n Deputy Collector being available in place of all the\n vacancies it was to take almost double the time for\n many other allocated Tehsildars to get promoted as\n Deputy Collectors. In other words it resulted in delayed\n chance of promotion. It was, inter alia, urged on behalf\n of the petitioners that the situation brought about by\n the rules of 30-7-1959 constituted variation to their\n prejudice in the conditions of service applicable to them\n immediately prior to the reorganisation of the State and\n the rules were consequently invalid. While repelling this\n submission the Constitution Bench held : (SCC p. 329,\n para 15)\n\n 79\n\n '15. ... All that happened as a result of making\npromotions to the posts of Deputy Collectors\ndivisionwise and limiting such promotions to 50 per cent\nof the total number of vacancies in the posts of Deputy\nCollector was to reduce the chances of promotion\navailable to the petitioners.\n \nIt is now well settled by the\ndecision of this Court in \nState of Mysore v. G.B. Purohit\n\nthat though a right to be considered for promotion is a\ncondition of service, mere chances of promotion are not.\nA rule which merely affects chances of promotion cannot\nbe regarded as varying a condition of service.\n \nIn \nPurohit\n\ncase, the districtwise seniority of sanitary inspectors\nwas changed to Statewise seniority, and as a result of\nthis change the respondents went down in seniority and\nbecame very junior. This, it was urged, affected their\nchances of promotion which were protected under the\nproviso to Section 115, sub-section (7). This contention\nwas negatived and Wanchoo, J., (as he then was),\nspeaking on behalf of this Court observed:\"It is said on\nbehalf of the respondents that as their chances of\npromotion have been affected their conditions of service\nhave been changed to their disadvantage. We see no\nforce in this argument because chances of promotion\nare not conditions of service.\" It is, therefore, clear that\nneither the Rules of 30-7-1959, nor the procedure for\nmaking promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector\ndivisionwise varies the conditions of service of the\npetitioners to their disadvantage.'\n\n 80\n\n ***\n\n15. It cannot be disputed that the Director General of\nOrdnance Factories who had issued the Circular dated 6-\n11-1962 had the power to issue the subsequent Circular\ndated 20-1-1966 also. In view of the legal position\npointed out above the aforesaid circular could not be\ntreated to be one affecting adversely any condition of\nservice of the Supervisors 'A'. Its only effect was that\nthe chance of promotion which had been accelerated by\nthe Circular dated 6-11-1962 was deferred and made\ndependent on selection according to the Rules.\nApparently, after the coming into force of the order\ndated 28-12-1965 and the Circular dated 20-1-1966\npromotions could not be made just on completion of two\nyears' satisfactory service under the earlier Circular\ndated 6-11-1962 the same having been superseded by\nthe later circular. It is further obvious that in this view\nof the matter Supervisors 'A' who had been promoted\nbefore the coming into force of the order dated 28-12-\n1965 and the Circular dated 20-1-1966 stood in a class\nseparate from those whose promotions were to be made\nthereafter. The fact that some Supervisors 'A' had been\npromoted before the coming into force of the order\ndated 28-12-1965 and the Circular dated 20-1-1966\ncould not, therefore, constitute the basis for an\nargument that those Supervisors 'A' whose cases came\nup for consideration for promotion thereafter and who\nwere promoted in due course in accordance with the\n\n 81\n\n rules were discriminated against. They apparently did\n not fall in the same category.\"\n\n34. This Court had also declared the position of law, on the\nabove aspect of the matter, in \nSyed Khalid Rizvi v. Union of\nIndia\n , wherein a three-Judge Bench observed as under :\n\n(SCC pp. 601-03, paras 30-31)\n\n 30. \"The next question is whether the seniority is a\n condition of service or a part of rules of recruitment? \nIn\n \nState of M.P. v. Shardul Singh\n, this Court held that the\n term 'conditions of service' means all those conditions\n which regulate the holding of a post by a person right\n from the time of his appointment to his retirement and\n even beyond, in matters like pensions, etc.\n \nIn \nI.N.\n Subba Reddy v. Andhra University\n, the same view was\n reiterated.\n \nIn \nMohd. Shujat Ali v. Union of India\n a\n Constitution Bench held that the rule which confers a\n right to actual promotion or a right to be considered for\n promotion is a rule prescribing a condition of the\n service.\n In Mohd. Bhakar v. Y. Krishna Reddy another\n Constitution Bench held that any rule which affects the\n promotion of a person relates to his condition of service.\n\n \nIn \nState of Mysore v. G.B. Purohit\n, this Court held that a\n rule which merely affects chances of promotion cannot\n be regarded as varying a condition of service. Chances\n of promotion are not conditions of service.\n The same\n view was reiterated in another Constitution Bench\n judgment in Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State of\n\n 82\n\nMaharashtra [Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State of\nMaharashtra. No doubt conditions of service may be\nclassified as salary, confirmation, promotion, seniority,\ntenure or termination of service, etc. \nas held in \nState of\nPunjab v. Kailash Nath\n by a Bench of two Judges but the\ncontext in which the law therein was laid must be noted.\nThe question therein was whether non-prosecution for a\ngrave offence after expiry of four years is a condition of\nservice? While negativing the contention that non-\nprosecution after expiry of 4 years is not a condition of\nservice, this Court elaborated the subject and the above\nview was taken. The ratio therein does not have any\nbearing on the point in issue. Perhaps the question may\nbear relevance, if an employee was initially recruited\ninto the service according to the rules and promotion\nwas regulated in the same rules to higher echelons of\nservice. In that arena promotion may be considered to\nbe a condition of service.\n \nIn \nA.K. Bhatnagar v. Union of\nIndia\n , this Court held that seniority is an incidence of\nservice and where the service rules prescribe the\nmethod of its computation it is squarely governed by\nsuch rules. In their absence ordinarily the length of\nservice is taken into account. In that case the direct\nrecruits were made senior to the recruits by\nregularisation although the appellants were appointed\nearlier in point of time and uninterruptedly remained in\nservice as temporary appointees along with the\nappellants but later on when recruited by direct\nrecruitment, they were held senior to the promotees.\n\n 83\n\n 31. No employee has a right to promotion but he has\nonly the right to be considered for promotion according\nto the rules. Chances of promotion are not conditions of\nservice and are defeasible. Take an illustration that the\nPromotion Regulations envisage maintaining integrity\nand good record by Dy. S.P. of State Police Service as\neligibility condition for inclusion in the select list for\nrecruitment by promotion to Indian Police Service.\nInclusion and approval of the name in the select list by\nthe UPSC, after considering the objections if any by the\nCentral Government is also a condition precedent.\nSuppose if 'B' is far junior to 'A' in State Services and 'B'\nwas found more meritorious and suitable and was put in\na select list of 1980 and accordingly 'B' was appointed\nto the Indian Police Service after following the\nprocedure. 'A' was thereby superseded by 'B'. Two years\nlater 'A' was found fit and suitable in 1984 and was\naccordingly appointed according to the Rules. Can 'A'\nthereafter say that 'B' being far junior to him in State\nservice, 'A' should become senior to 'B' in the Indian\nPolice Service. The answer is obviously no because 'B'\nhad stolen a march over 'A' and became senior to 'A'.\nHere maintaining integrity and good record are\nconditions of recruitment and seniority is an incidence of\nservice. Take another illustration that the State service\nprovides--rule of reservation to the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes. 'A' is a general candidate holding\nNo. 1 rank according to the roster as he was most\nmeritorious in the State service among general\n\n 84\n\ncandidates. 'B' Scheduled Caste candidate holds No. 3\npoint in the roster and 'C', Scheduled Tribe holds No. 5\nin the roster. Suppose the Indian Police Service\nRecruitment Rules also provide reservation to the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as well. By\noperation of the equality of opportunity by \nArticles 14\n,\n16(1)\n, 16(4)\n and \n335\n, 'B' and 'C' were recruited by\npromotion from State Services to Central Services and\nwere appointed earlier to 'A' in 1980. 'A' thereafter in\nthe next year was found suitable as a general candidate\nand was appointed to the Indian Police Service. Can 'A'\nthereafter contend that since 'B' and 'C' were appointed\nby virtue of reservation, though were less meritorious\nand junior to him in the State service and gradation list\nwould not become senior to him in the cadre as IPS\nofficer. Undoubtedly 'B' and 'C', by rule of reservation,\nhad stolen a march over 'A' from the State Service. By\noperation of rule of reservation 'B' and 'C' became\nsenior and 'A' became junior in the Central Services.\nReservation and roster were conditions of recruitment\nand seniority was only an incidence of service. The\neligibility for recruitment to the Indian Police Service,\nthus, is a condition of recruitment and not a condition of\nservice. Accordingly we hold that seniority, though,\nnormally an incidence of service, Seniority Rules,\nRecruitment Rules and Promotion Regulations form part\nof the conditions of recruitment to the Indian Police\nService by promotion, which should be strictly complied\n\n 85\n\n with before becoming eligible for consideration for\n promotion and are not relaxable.\"\n\n35. More recent in time, is the judgment rendered by\nanother three-Judge Division Bench in \nS.S. Bola v. B.D.\nSardana\n. The majority opinion in the above judgment was\nrendered by K. Ramaswamy, J. In the process of\nconsideration, he observed as under : (SCC p. 622, para\n\n145)\n\n \"145.It is true that the Rules made under the proviso to\n \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution can be issued by\n amending or altering the Rules with retrospectivity as\n consistently held by this Court in a catena of decisions,\n viz. \nB.S. Vadera v. Union of India\n, \nRaj Kumar v. Union\n of India\n, \nK. Nagaraj v. State of A.P.\n, \nT.R. Kapur v. State\n of Haryana\n and a host of other decisions. But the\n question is whether the Rules can be amended taking\n away the vested right.\n \nAs regards the right to seniority,\n this Court elaborately considered the incidence of the\n right to seniority and amendment of the Act in the latest\n decision in \nAshok Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P.\n relieving\n the need to reiterate all of them once over. Suffice it to\n state that it is settled law that a distinction between\n right and interest has always been maintained. Seniority\n is a facet of interest. The Rules prescribe the method of\n selection/recruitment. Seniority is governed by the\n existing rules and is required to be worked out\n accordingly. No one has a vested right to promotion or\n\n 86\n\n seniority but an officer has an interest to seniority\n acquired by working out the Rules. It would be taken\n away only by operation of valid law. Right to be\n considered for promotion is a rule prescribed by\n conditions of service. A rule which affects the promotion\n of a person relates to conditions of service. The rule\n merely affecting the chances of promotion cannot be\n regarded as varying the conditions of service. Chances\n of promotion are not conditions of service. A rule which\n merely affects the chances of promotion does not\n amount to change in the conditions of service.\"\n\n36. Consequent upon the above detailed consideration, K.\nRamaswamy, J. recorded his conclusion in para 153. On the\nissue in hand, sub-para AB of para 153 is relevant and is\nbeing extracted hereunder : (\nS.S. Bola\n case, SCC p. 634)\n\n \"AB. A distinction between right to be considered for\n promotion and an interest to be considered for\n promotion has always been maintained. Seniority is a\n facet of interest. The rules prescribe the method of\n recruitment/selection. Seniority is governed by the rules\n existing as on the date of consideration for promotion.\n Seniority is required to be worked out according to the\n existing rules. No one has a vested right to promotion or\n seniority. But an officer has an interest to seniority\n acquired by working out the rules. The seniority should\n be taken away only by operation of valid law. Right to\n be considered for promotion is a rule prescribed by\n\n 87\n\n conditions of service. A rule which affects chances of\n promotion of a person relates to conditions of service.\n The rule/provision in an Act merely affecting the\n chances of promotion would not be regarded as varying\n the conditions of service. The chances of promotion are\n not conditions of service. A rule which merely affects\n the chances of promotion does not amount to change in\n the conditions of service. However, once a declaration of\n law, on the basis of existing rules, is made by a\n constitutional court and a mandamus is issued or\n direction given for its enforcement by preparing the\n seniority list, operation of the declaration of law and the\n mandamus and directions issued by the Court is the\n result of the declaration of law but not the operation of\n the rules per se.\"\n\n37. S. Saghir Ahmad, J. concurred with the view expressed\nby K. Ramaswamy, J. A dissenting view was recorded by\nG.B. Pattanaik, J. On the subject in hand, however, there\nwas no dissent. The conclusions recorded by G.B.\nPattanaik, J. were to the following effect : (\nS.S. Bola\n case,\nSCC pp. 665-66 & 675-77, paras 199-202 & 212)\n\n \"199.To the said effect the judgment of this Court in\n \nState of Punjab v. Kishan Das\n wherein this Court\n observed an order forfeiting the past service which has\n earned a government servant increments in the post or\n rank he holds, howsoever adverse it is to him, affecting\n his seniority within the rank to which he belongs or his\n\n 88\n\nfuture chances of promotion, does not attract \nArticle\n311(2)\n of the Constitution since it is not covered by the\nexpression reduction in rank.\n\n 200. Thus to have a particular position in the\nseniority list within a cadre can neither be said to be\naccrued or vested right of a government servant and\nlosing some places in the seniority list within the cadre\ndoes not amount to reduction in rank even though the\nfuture chances of promotion get delayed thereby. It was\nurged by Mr Sachar and Mr Mahabir Singh appearing for\nthe direct recruits that the effect of redetermination of\nthe seniority in accordance with the provisions of the\nAct is not only that the direct recruits lose a few places\nof seniority in the rank of Executive Engineer but their\nfuture chances of promotion are greatly jeopardised and\nthat right having been taken away the Act must be held\nto be invalid. It is difficult to accept this contention since\nchances of promotion of a government servant are not a\ncondition of service. \nIn \nState of Maharashtra v.\nChandrakant Anant Kulkarni\n, this Court held : (SCC p.\n141, para 16)\n\n '16. Mere chances of promotion are not conditions of\nservice and the fact that there was reduction in the\nchances of promotion did not tantamount to a change in\nthe conditions of service. A right to be considered for\npromotion is a term of service, but mere chances of\npromotion are not.'\n\n 89\n\n \n201. To the said effect is a judgment of this Court in\n\nK. Jagadeesan v. Union of India\n wherein this Court held\n: (SCC pp. 230-31, para 7)\n\n '7. ... The only effect is that his chances of promotion\nor his right to be considered for promotion to the higher\npost is adversely affected. This cannot be regarded as\nretrospective effect being given to the amendment of\nthe rules carried out by the impugned notification and\nthe challenge to the said notification on that ground\nmust fail.'\n\n202. Again in \nUnion of India v. S.L. Dutta\n this Court\nheld : (SCC p. 512, para 17)\n\n '17. ... In our opinion, what was affected by the\nchange of policy were merely the chances of promotion\nof the Air Vice-Marshals in the Navigation Stream. As far\nas the posts of Air Marshals open to the Air Vice-\nMarshals in the said stream were concerned, their right\nor eligibility to be considered for promotion still\nremained and hence, there was no change in their\nconditions of service.'\n\n ***\n\n 212. So far as the rules dealing with Irrigation\nBranch are concerned, the said rules, namely, the\nPunjab Service of Engineers (Irrigation Branch) Class I\nService Rules, 1964 have not been considered earlier by\n\n 90\n\nthis Court at any point of time. One Shri M.L. Gupta was\nappointed to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer as\na direct recruit on 27-8-1971, pursuant to the result of\na competitive examination held by the Haryana Public\nService Commission in December 1970. The said Shri\nGupta was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer\non 17-9-1976. He made a representation to the State\nGovernment to fix up his seniority in accordance with\nthe service rules but as the said representation was not\ndisposed of for more than three years he approached\nthe High Court of Punjab and Haryana by filing CWP No.\n4335 of 1984. That petition was disposed of by the High\nCourt on the undertaking given by the State that the\nseniority will be fixed up soon. The said undertaking not\nhaving been complied with, the said Shri Gupta\napproached the High Court in January 1986 by filing a\ncontempt petition. In September 1986 the State\nGovernment fixed the inter se seniority of the said Shri\nGupta and other members of the Service and Gupta was\nshown at Serial No. 72. Two promotees had been shown\nat Serial Nos. 74 and 75. Those two promotees filed a\nwrit petition challenging the fixation of inter se seniority\nbetween the direct recruits and promotees and the High\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana by its judgment passed in\nMay 1987 quashed the order dated 29-9-1986\nwhereunder the seniority of the direct recruits and\npromotees has been fixed and called upon the State\nGovernment to pass a speaking order assigning position\nin the gradation list. The State Government issued a\n\n 91\n\nfresh Notification on 24-7-1987 giving detailed reasons\nreaffirming the earlier seniority which had been notified\non 29-9-1986. Prior to the aforesaid notification of the\nState Government Shri Gupta had filed a writ petition in\nthe Punjab and Haryana High Court which had been\nregistered as CWP No. 6012 of 1986 claiming his\nseniority at No. 22 instead of 72 which had been given\nto him under the Notification dated 29-9-1986. The\npromotees also filed a writ petition challenging the\nGovernment Order dated 24-7-1987 which was\nregistered as CWP No. 5780 of 1987. Both the writ\npetitions, one filed by the direct recruit, Shri Gupta\n(CWP No. 6012 of 1986), and the other filed by the\npromotees (CWP No. 5780 of 1987) were disposed of by\nthe learned Single Judge by judgments dated 24-1-1992\nand 4-3-1992, respectively, whereunder the learned\nSingle Judge accepted the stand of the promotees and\nShri Gupta was placed below one Shri O.P. Gagneja.\nThe said Shri Gupta filed two appeals to the Division\nBench against the judgment of the learned Single\nJudge, which was registered as Letters Patent Appeals\nNos. 367 and 411 of 1992. The aforesaid letters patent\nappeals were allowed by judgment dated 27-8-1992.\n\nThis judgment of the Division Bench of the Punjab and\nHaryana High Court was challenged by the State of\nHaryana in the Supreme Court which has been\nregistered as CAs Nos. 1448-49 of 1993. This Court\ngranted leave and stayed the operation of the judgment\nin the matter of fixation of seniority. The promotees also\n\n 92\n\nchallenged \nthe said judgment\n of the Division Bench in\nthis Court which has been registered as CAs Nos. 1452-\n53 of 1993. During the pendency of these appeals in\nthis Court, an Ordinance was promulgated on 13-5-\n1985 as Ordinance 6 of 1995 and the said Ordinance\nwas replaced by the impugned Act 20 of 1995 by the\nHaryana Legislature. The validity of the Act was\nchallenged by the said Shri Gupta and pursuant to the\norder of this Court the said writ petition having been\ntransferred to this Court has been registered as TC No.\n40 of 1996. So far as the validity of the Act is\nconcerned, the question of any usurpation of judicial\npower by the legislature does not arise in relation to the\nIrrigation Branch inasmuch as the Recruitment Rules of\n1964 framed by the Governor of Punjab in exercise of\npower under proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution\nwhich has been adapted by the State of Haryana on and\nfrom the date Haryana was made a separate State had\nnot been considered by this Court nor has any direction\nbeen issued by this Court. The legislative competence of\nthe State Legislature to enact the Act had also not been\nassailed and in our view rightly since the State\nLegislature has the powers under Schedule VII List II\nEntry 41 to frame law governing the conditions of\nservice of the employees of the State Government. That\napart \nArticle 309\n itself stipulates that the appropriate\nlegislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions\nof service of persons appointed to public services and\nposts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of\n\n 93\n\nany State subject to the provisions of the Constitution.\nProviso to \nArticle 309\n confers power on the President in\nconnection with the affairs of the Union and on the\nGovernor in connection with the affairs of the State to\nmake rules regulating the recruitment and the\nconditions of service until provision in that behalf is\nmade by or under an Act of the appropriate legislature\nunder \nArticle 309\n main part. In this view of the matter,\nthe legislative competence of the State Legislature to\nenact the legislation in question is beyond doubt. The\nonly question which, therefore, arises for consideration\nand which is contended in assailing the validity of the\nAct is that under the Act the direct recruits would lose\nseveral positions in the gradation list and thereby their\naccrued and vested rights would get jeopardised and\ntheir future chances of promotion also would be\nseriously hampered and such violation tantamounts to\nviolation of rights under Part III of the Constitution. For\nthe reasons already given while dealing with the\naforesaid contention in connection with the Public Health\nBranch and the Buildings and Roads Branch the\ncontention raised in the transfer case cannot be\nsustained and, therefore, the transfer case would stand\ndismissed. The Act in question dealing with the service\nconditions of the engineers belonging to the Irrigation\nBranch must be held to be a valid piece of legislation\npassed by the competent legislature and by giving it\nretrospective effect no constitutional provision has been\nviolated nor has any right of the employee under Part\n\n 94\n\n III of the Constitution been infringed requiring\n interference by this Court.\"\n\n38. Finally, reference may be made to a decision rendered\nby this Court in \nUnion of India v. Col\n. G.S. Grewal wherein\nthis Court observed as under : (SCC p. 315, para 28)\n\n \"28.As pointed out above, the Tribunal has partly\n allowed the OA of the respondent primarily on the\n ground that the decision contained in the Government\n Order dated 23-4-2010 amends the promotion policy\n retrospectively thereby taking away the rights already\n accrued to the respondent in terms of the earlier policy.\n\n It is also mentioned that the revised policy\n fundamentally changes the applicant's prospects of\n promotion. What is ignored is that the promotions\n already granted to the respondent have not been taken\n away. Insofar as future chances of promotions are\n concerned, no vested right accrues as chance of\n promotion is not a condition of service. Therefore, in the\n first instance, the Tribunal will have to spell out as to\n what was the vested right which had already accrued to\n the respondent and that is taken away by the Policy\n decision dated 23-4-2010. In this process, other thing\n which becomes relevant is to consider that once the\n respondent is permanently seconded in DGQA and he is\n allowed to remain there, can there be a change in his\n service conditions vis-à-vis others who are his\n counterparts in DGQA, but whose permanent\n\n 95\n\n secondment is not in cloud? To put it otherwise, the sole\n reason for issuing Government Policy dated 23-4-2010\n was to take care of those cases where permanent\n secondment to DGQA was wrongly given. As per the\n appellants, since the respondent had suffered final\n supersession, he was not entitled to be seconded\n permanently to DGQA. This is disputed by the\n respondent. That aspect will have to be decided first.\n That apart, even if it be so, as contended by the\n appellants, the appellants have not recalled the\n permanent secondment order. They have allowed the\n respondent to stay in DGQA maintaining his promotion\n as Colonel as well, which was given pursuant to this\n secondment. The question, in such circumstances, that\n would arise is whether the respondent can be treated\n differently even if he is allowed to remain in DGQA viz.\n whether not allowing him to take further promotions,\n which benefit is still available to others whose\n permanent secondment is not in dispute, would amount\n to discrimination or arbitrariness thereby offending\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India. In our\n opinion, these, and other related issues, will have to be\n argued and thrashed out for coming to a proper\n conclusion.\"\n\n39. It is apparent from a collective perusal of the\nconclusions recorded in the judgments extracted in the\nforegoing paragraphs, that chances of promotion do not\nconstitute a condition of service. In that view of the matter,\n\n 96\n\n it is inevitable to hold that the High Court erred in\n recording its eventual determination on the basis of the\n fact that the promulgation of the 2003 TA Rules and the\n 2003 STA Rules was discriminatory and arbitrary with\n regard to the fixation of the inter se seniority, since the\n same seriously prejudiced the chances of promotion of the\n erstwhile members of the Ministerial Cadre, namely, those\n members of the original Ministerial Cadre, who had not\n opted for appointment/absorption into the cadre of Data\n Entry Operators, with reference to and in comparison with,\n those members of the original Ministerial Cadre who had\n opted for appointment/absorption into the cadre of Data\n Entry Operators.\n\n 40. As a proposition of law it is imperative for us to record\n that chances of promotion do not constitute conditions of\n service, and as such, mere alteration of chances of\n promotion, would not per se call for judicial interference.\n The above general proposition would not be applicable in\n case the chances of promotion are altered arbitrarily, or on\n the basis of considerations which are shown to be perverse\n or mala fide.\"\n\n24. Nextly, in the case of P.U. JOSHI AND OTHERS VS.\n\nACCOUNTANT GENERAL AHAMADABAD AND OTHERS\n\nreported in (2003) 2 SCC 632, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at\n\nparagraph 10 held as under:\n\n 97\n\n\"10. We have carefully considered the submissions made\non behalf of both parties. Questions relating to the\nconstitution, pattern, nomenclature of posts, cadres,\ncategories, their creation/abolition, prescription of\nqualifications and other conditions of service including\navenues of promotions and criteria to be fulfilled for such\npromotions pertain to the field of policy is within the\nexclusive discretion and jurisdiction of the State, subject, of\ncourse, to the limitations or restrictions envisaged in the\nConstitution of India and it is not for the statutory\ntribunals, at any rate, to direct the Government to have a\nparticular method of recruitment or eligibility criteria or\navenues of promotion or impose itself by substituting its\nviews for that of the State. Similarly, it is well open and\nwithin the competency of the State to change the rules\nrelating to a service and alter or amend and vary by\naddition/substraction the qualifications, eligibility criteria\nand other conditions of service including avenues of\npromotion, from time to time, as the administrative\nexigencies may need or necessitate. Likewise, the State by\nappropriate rules is entitled to amalgamate departments or\nbifurcate departments into more and constitute different\ncategories of posts or cadres by undertaking further\nclassification, bifurcation or amalgamation as well as\nreconstitute and restructure the pattern and\ncadres/categories of service, as may be required from time\nto time by abolishing the existing cadres/posts and creating\nnew cadres/posts. There is no right in any employee of the\nState to claim that rules governing conditions of his service\n\n 98\n\n should be forever the same as the one when he entered\n service for all purposes and except for ensuring or\n safeguarding rights or benefits already earned, acquired or\n accrued at a particular point of time, a government servant\n has no right to challenge the authority of the State to\n amend, alter and bring into force new rules relating to even\n an existing service.\"\n\n25. \nIn the case of \nRAMUAL VS. STATE OF HIMACHAL\n\nPRADESH AND OTHERS\n, reported in (1989) 1 SCC 285\n\nparagraph 17 reads as under:\n\n \"17. Mr Shankar Ghosh, learned counsel appearing on\n behalf of Respondents 4 and 5 (Respondent 5 has since\n died), submits that after the final seniority list was\n approved by the Central Government, it had become final\n and it cannot be challenged in 1982 after 11 years. Further,\n it is submitted by him that the final seniority list has never\n been challenged by the appellant and, accordingly, he\n cannot be allowed to challenge the same by filing a writ\n petition. It is true that the final seniority list was sent to\n the Central Government and presumably it was approved,\n but because a seniority list has been approved by the\n Central Government, it cannot be laid down as a rule of law\n that even though it has been illegally prepared in violation\n of the directions of the Central Government itself to the\n prejudice of the officer or officers concerned, it cannot be\n challenged. Normally, when a seniority list has been made\n\n 99\n\n final, it should not be allowed to be challenged. But when a\n seniority list is prepared ignoring all just principles and also\n the rules framed or directions given by appropriate\n authority, seriously affecting any officer, it is always liable\n to be examined and set aside by the court. We are,\n therefore, unable to accept the contention of the learned\n counsel for Respondent 4 that the seniority list having been\n made final after the approval of the Central Government\n cannot be challenged by the appellant.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n26. It is well established principle in law that, while making\n\nmodification in the Seniority List, the authorities are required to\n\nconsider the Rule 6 of the Karnataka Civil Services (Seniority)\n\nRules, 1957. Had the respondent-BBMP followed the above Rule,\n\nthere would be no anomaly in the impugned list and such action\n\non the part of the respondent-BBMP is deprecated. Further, if the\n\npersons, who were placed above, in the Seniority List and their\n\nseniority is affected on account of objections filed by aggrieved\n\nthird parties to the Seniority List. It is the duty of the authority to\n\ninform/issue notice or made known to such persons whose rank\n\nwill be affected by placing the persons who have filed objection to\n\nthe provisional list above the affected parties. \nIn this regard,\n\n 100\n\nPunjab and Haryna High Court in the case of \nSRI NIRANJAN\n\nDASS SEHGAL VS. THE STATE OF PUNJAB AND OTHERS\n\nreported in 1968 SLR 183 held that, issuing of notice to officials\n\naffected by Seniority and such parties were reverted in the final\n\nSeniority List and as such, it is held that, issuing the show-cause\n\nnotice is mandatory before chaining the Seniority List.\n \nThis aspect\n\nof the matter was also considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nin the case of \nS.K.GHOSH AND ANOTHER VS. UNION OF\n\nINDIA AND OTHERS\n reported in AIR 1968 SC 1385. Applying\n\naforementioned principle to the case on hand, the petitioners\n\nherein were placed above the private respondents herein in the\n\nearlier Seniority List and that Seniority List should not have been\n\naltered or modified on the basis of any representation/objection\n\nfiled by the private respondents herein unless the petitioners\n\nherein have been aware of the same, and had been afforded an\n\nopportunity to show the cause against it. Determination of\n\npetitioners' seniority at the instance of the private respondents,\n\nwithout affording opportunity of hearing to the petitioners herein,\n\namounts to arbitrary act and violative of principles of natural\n\njustice.\n\n 101\n\n27. I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by Sri\n\nT.P.Vivekananda, learned counsel appearing for the employees of\n\nrespondent-BBMP relating to equivalence of posts. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of CHANDRAKANTH ANANATH\n\nKULKARNI, (supra), held that, it is for the Government to take\n\ndecision insofar as equivalence of posts and it is not open to the\n\nCourt to consider whether the equation of posts made by the\n\nGovernment is right or wrong and same is the within exclusive\n\ndomain of the Government. In the said case, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court at paragraphs 10 and 11 held as follows:\n\n \"10. The following principles had been formulated for\n being observed as far as may be, in the integration of\n government servants allotted to the services of the new\n States:\n\n \"In the matter of equation of posts:\n\n (i) Where there were regularly constituted similar\n cadres in the different integrating units the cadres\n will ordinarily be integrated on that basis; but\n\n (ii) Where, however, there were no such\n similar cadres the following factors will be\n\n 102\n\n taken into consideration in determining the\n equation of posts--\n\n (a) nature and duties of a post;\n\n (b) powers exercised by the officers holding a post,\n the extent of territorial or other charge held or\n responsibilities discharged;\n\n (c) the minimum qualifications, if any, prescribed\nfor recruitment to the post, and\n\n (d) the salary of the post.\"\n\n It is well settled that these principles have a\n statutory force.\n\n \n11. There is a long line of decisions of this Court\nstarting from the \nUnion of India v. P.K. Roy\n laying down\nthat the Central Government has been constituted to be\nthe final authority in the matter of integration of services\nunder sub-section (5) of Section 115 of the Act. The matter\nof equation of posts is purely an administrative function. It\nhas been left entirely to the Central Government as to how\nit has to deal with these questions. The Central\nGovernment had established an Advisory Committee for the\npurpose of assisting in the proper consideration of the\nrepresentations made to it. There is nothing in Sections\n115 to 117 of the Act prohibiting the Central Government in\nany way from taking the aid and assistance of the State\nGovernment in the matter of effecting the integration of\n\n 103\n\n services.\n \nAs observed by this Court in \nRoy\n case the usual\n procedure followed by the Central Government in the\n matter of integration of services generally, is in order. It is\n not open to the court to consider whether the equation of\n posts made by the Central Government is right or wrong.\n This was a matter exclusively within the province of the\n Central Government. Perhaps, the only question the court\n can enquire into is whether the four principles agreed upon\n at the Chief Secretaries Conference had been properly\n taken into account. This is the narrow and limited field\n within which the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court can\n operate. But where, as here, in the matter of equation of\n posts, the Central Government had properly taken into\n account all the four principles decided upon at the Chief\n Secretaries Conference, the decision cannot be assailed at\n all. In the present case, notonly the Central Government\n had laid down the principles for integration, but also\n considered the representations and passed the final orders\n and the provisional gradation lists were prepared and\n published by the State Government under the direction and\n with the sanction of the Central Government.\"\n\n28. The said principle \nlaid down in\n the case of\n\nCHANDRAKANTH ANANT KULKARNI, (supra), was reiterated\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nS.P.SHIVAPRASAD\n\nPIPAL VS. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n reported in (1998)\n\n4 SCC 598 and paragraph 19 of the same, reads as under:\n\n 104\n\n \n\"19. However, it is possible that by reason of such a\n merger, the chance of promotion of some of the employees\n may be adversely affected, or some others may benefit in\n consequence. But this cannot be a ground for setting aside\n the merger which is essentially a policy decision. This Court\n in \nUnion of India v. S.L. Dutta\n examined this contention.\n \nIn\n \nS.L. Dutta\n case a change in the promotional policy was\n challenged on the ground that as a result, service\n conditions of the respondent were adversely affected since\n his chances of promotion were reduced.\n \nRelying upon the\n decision in the \nState of Maharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant\n Kulkarni\n this Court held that a mere chance of promotion\n was not a condition of service and the fact that there was a\n reduction in the chance of promotion would not amount to\n a change in the conditions of service.\"\n\n29. It is also well established principle in law that, classification\n\non the basis of birth mark, of an employee is impermissible under\n\nlaw. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nUNION OF INDIA\n\nAND OTHERS VS. ATHUL SHUKLA AND OTHERS\n reported in\n\n(2014) 10 SCC 432 held that, the classification of group captains\n\n(Select) and group captains (Time Scale) in two groups for the\n\npurposes of prescribing different retirement ages in the facts of\n\nthe said case, held to be contrary to \nArticle 14\n and \n16\n of\n\nConstitution of India.\n In the case of RAMAN LAL KESHAV LAL\n\n 105\n\nSONI (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that, the\n\nlength of service determines the seniority. Paragraph 51 of the\n\nsaid judgment reads as under:\n\n \"51. Now, in 1978 before the \nAmending Act\n was passed,\n thanks to the provisions of the principal Act of 1961, the\n ex-municipal employees who had been allocated to the\n panchayat service as Secretaries, Officers and servants of\n Gram and Nagar Panchayats, had achieved the status of\n government servants. Their status as government servants\n could not be extinguished, so long as the posts were not\n abolished and their services were not terminated in\n accordance with the provisions of \nArticle 311\n of the\n Constitution. Nor was it permissible to single them out for\n differential treatment. That would offend \nArticle 14\n of the\n Constitution. An attempt was made to justify the purported\n differentiation on the basis of history and ancestry, as it\n were. It was said that Talatis and Kotwals who became\n Secretaries, Officers and servants of Gram and Nagar\n Panchayats were government servants, even to start with,\n while municipal employees who became such Secretaries,\n Officers and servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats were\n not. Each carried the mark or the \"brand\" of his origin and\n a classification on the basis of the source from which they\n came into the service, it was claimed, was permissible. We\n are clear that it is not. Once they had joined the common\n stream of service to perform the same duties, it is clearly\n\n 106\n\n not permissible to make any classification on the basis of\n their origin. Such a classification would be unreasonable\n and entirely irrelevant to the object sought to be achieved.\n It is to navigate around these two obstacles of \nArticle 311\n\n and \nArticle 14\n that the \nAmending Act\n is sought to be made\n retrospective, to bring about an artificial situation as if the\n erstwhile municipal employees never became members of a\n service under the State. Can a law be made to destroy\n today's accrued constitutional rights by artificially reverting\n to a situation which existed 17 years ago? No.\"\n\n30. \nIn the case of \nRAMASWAMY G.T\n (supra), this Court at\n\nparagraphs 22 to 26 and 40 held as follows:\n\n \"22. Sri Narasimhamurthy has urged that on the very\n terms of Rule 10 of the Karnataka Government Seniority\n Rules, 1957 (Seniority Rules) in the preparation of a fresh\n seniority list for every year, presupposes that all seniority\n lists prepared earlier stand superseded and Government\n was bound to prepare the same only in conformity with the\n law declared by Courts as on that day only.\n\n 23. Rule 10 of the Seniority Rules on which strong reliance\n has been placed by Sri Narasimhamurthy to sustain his\n wide proposition reads thus:\n\n \"10(1) There shall be prepared every year for each\n cadre of service or class of posts a seniority list\n consisting of the names of all officers borne on the said\n\n 107\n\n cadre or class of posts arranged in order of seniority in\n accordance with the provisions of these rules.\n\n (2) The seniority list under sub-rule (1) shall be\nprepared by:--\n\n (a) The Government for Gazetted cadres of service\nor classes of posts;\n\n (b) The Head of the department concerned for non-\n\ngazetted cadres of service or classes of posts;\n\n \"Provided that the Government may also prepare the\nseniority list for non-Gazetted cadres of any service or class\nof posts\".\n\n This rule directs the preparation of seniority lists in\nevery cadre of every department of Government by the\ndesignated authority every year. In case of gazetted\ncadre/cadres, Government is the authority to prepare\nseniority lists and in other cadres it is the head of\nDepartments. The object and intendment of this Rule is\nonly to have updated seniority lists in every cadre and\nnothing more than that. The rule no where authorises and\nempowers a review of all earlier promotions and re-\ndetermination of all earlier rankings made in the earlier\nseniority lists. In the process of updating seniority lists, it is\neven inconceivable to hold that earlier seniority lists which\nhave become final should also be reviewed and a fresh\ndetermination made. The rule on its terms does not support\nthe very wide construction and proposition suggested on it.\nWe are of the view that the acceptance of any such view\n\n 108\n\nwould only lead to disastrous results. We find no merit in\nthis contention of Sri Narasimhamurthy and reject the\nsame.\n\n23(a). As we have rejected the two preliminary objections\nurged by the promotees, it is now necessary to examine\nthe merits which we now proceed to do.\n\n24. Sriyuths Datar and Narayana Rao have urged that the\nvery last sentence or direction of Clause 4 of the Official\nMemorandum dated 10-2-1984 providing for a review of\npromotions in all cadres from the promulgation of the C & R\nRules or ignoring all earlier determinations and seniority\nlists prepared from time to time was opposed to all well\nsettled principles of law which is also the very principle\nenunciated in Kadali's case itself.\n\n25. Sriyuths Chandrasekharaiah, learned Government\nAdvocate, appearing for State Government, Krishnamurthy\nand Narasimhamurthy have urged that the sentence or the\ndirection in the Official Memorandum to which exception\nwas taken had been issued by Government as expounded\nby this Court in Kadali's case.\n\n26. The very last sentence or direction of Clause-4 of the\nOfficial Memorandum to which exception is taken reads\nthus:\n\n\"Except in the case of Karnataka Administrative service,\nlimiting the carry forward to three years should be enforced\n\n 109\n\n with effect from the date on which the Cadre and\n Recruitment Rules came into force\".\n\n \n40. What emerges from our above discussion is that the\n 1976 seniority list, whatever be its legality had become\n final and can only be modified in terms of an order that\n may be made by the Supreme Court or this Court in any\n other case whether pending or filed hereafter. When once\n we reach the conclusion that the 1976 list had reached\n finality for whatever reason that may be, it necessarily\n follows from the same that the rankings assigned in that\n list cannot be tinkered with and all further preparations\n must be on the basis of that list only. We are also of the\n view that this conclusion flows from the ruling of the\n Supreme Court in \nS.K. Ghosh v. Union of India\n (AIR 1968\n Supreme Court 1385) and also from Kadali's case.\n\n31. In RAGHAVA RAJAGOPALCHARI (supra), the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court at paragraph 17 held as follows:\n\n \n\"17. The learned counsel for the State sought to argue\n before us that the date \"16th March, 1954\" occurring in the\n order dated January 28, 1954, was mentioned due to a\n mistake, and the proper date which should have been\n mentioned was the date of superannuation, namely, June\n 30, 1953. He says that the order dated July 23, 1953,\n continuing the services of the petitioner after the date of\n superannuation was bad in view of the ruling of this Court\n in \nState of Assam v. Padma Ram Borah\n. But we are unable\n to appreciate how he is entitled to raise this point. The writ\n\n 110\n\n was brought to challenge this order. No such petition, even\n if it be competent, was filed by the State itself. The\n respondent to a writ petition cannot be allowed to attack its\n own order as a respondent.\"\n\n32. In the case of SUB-INSPECTOR ROOPLAL (supra),\n\nparagraphs 15, 16 and 23 held as follows:\n\n \"15. We will now take up the question whether the\n appellants are entitled to count their service rendered by\n them as Sub-Inspectors in BSF for the purpose of their\n seniority after absorption as Sub-Inspectors (Executive) in\n the Delhi Police or not. We have already noticed the fact\n that it is pursuant to the needs of the Delhi Police that\n these officials were deputed to the Delhi Police from BSF\n following the procedure laid down in Rule 5(h) of the rules\n and subsequently absorbed as contemplated under the said\n rules. It is also not in dispute that at some point of time in\n BSF, the appellants' services were regularised in the post of\n Sub-Inspector and they were transferred as regularly\n appointed Sub-Inspectors to the Delhi Police Force.\n Therefore, on being absorbed in an equivalent cadre in the\n transferred post, we find no reason why these transferred\n officials should not be permitted to count their service in\n the parent department. At any rate, this question is not res\n integra and is squarely covered by the ratio of judgments\n of this Court in more than one case. Since the earlier Bench\n of the Tribunal relied upon Madhavan case to give relief to\n\n 111\n\nthe deputationists, we will first consider the law laid down\nby this Court in Madhavan case. This Court in that case\nwhile considering a similar question, came to the following\nconclusion: (SCC p. 580, para 21)\n\n \"21. We may examine the question from a different\n point of view. There is not much difference between\n deputation and transfer. Indeed, when a deputationist is\n permanently absorbed in the CBI, he is under the rules\n appointed on transfer. In other words, deputation may\n be regarded as a transfer from one government\n department to another. It will be against all rules of\n service jurisprudence, if a government servant holding a\n particular post is transferred to the same or an\n equivalent post in another government department, the\n period of his service in the post before his transfer is not\n taken into consideration in computing his seniority in\n the transferred post. The transfer cannot wipe out his\n length of service in the post from which he has been\n transferred. It has been observed by this Court that it is\n a just and wholesome principle commonly applied where\n persons from different sources are drafted to serve in a\n new service that their pre-existing total length of\n service in the parent department should be respected\n and presented by taking the same into account in\n determining their ranking in the new service cadre. \nSee\n \nR.S. Makashi v. I.M. Menon\n; \nWing Commander J. Kumar\n v. Union of India\n.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 112\n\n16. Similar is the view taken by this Court in the cases of\nR.S. Makashi and Wing Commander J. Kumar which\njudgments have been followed by this Court in Madhavan\ncase. Hence, we do not think it is necessary for us to deal\nin detail with the view taken by this Court in those\njudgments. Applying the principles laid down in the above-\nreferred cases, we hold the appellants are entitled to count\nthe substantive service rendered by them in the post of\nSub-Inspector in BSF while counting their service in the\npost of Sub-Inspector (Executive) in the Delhi Police Force.\n\n23. It is clear from the ratio laid down in the above case\nthat any rule, regulation or executive instruction which has\nthe effect of taking away the service rendered by a\ndeputationist in an equivalent cadre in the parent\ndepartment while counting his seniority in the deputed post\nwould be violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nHence, liable to be struck down. Since the impugned\nmemorandum in its entirety does not take away the above\nright of the deputationists and by striking down the\noffending part of the memorandum, as has been prayed in\nthe writ petition, the rights of the appellants could be\npreserved, we agree with the prayer of the appellant-\npetitioners and the offending words in the memorandum\n\"whichever is later\" are held to be violative of \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n of the Constitution, hence, those words are quashed\nfrom the text of the impugned memorandum.\n\nConsequently, the right of the appellant-petitioners to\ncount their service from the date of their regular\n\n 113\n\n appointment in the post of Sub-Inspector in BSF, while\n computing their seniority in the cadre of Sub-Inspector\n (Executive) in the Delhi Police, is restored.\"\n\n33. Having taken note of the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt and the discussion made above, it is for the Government to\n\ndetermine the equation of posts. The power vested with the\n\nGovernment for merging of posts and said aspect has been\n\naccepted by the respondent-BBMP in its order dated 10.01.2011\n\nand Seniority List dated 28.01.2013 has been issued by the\n\nrespondent-BBMP placing the petitioners herein above the private\n\nrespondents and thereafter, issuing the Final Seniority List dated\n\n09.09.2015, re-determining the entire list, without giving effect to\n\nor discussing about the spirit underlining Rule 6 of the Karnataka\n\nCivil Services (Seniority) Rules, 1957 by the respondent-BBMP, is\n\nclear case of abdication of power by the respondent-BBMP without\n\nobeying the orders of Government as well as the judgment of this\n\ncourt in G.GOPALAIAH'S case and the principles laid down by the\n\nthis court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforementioned\n\njudgments and therefore, I am of the view that, the petitioners\n\n(Employees of SJSRY Scheme) have made out a case for\n\n 114\n\ninterference in these writ petitions. In the result, I pass the\n\nfollowing:\n\n ORDER\n\n i) W.P.No.45646 of 2015, W.P.No. 3830 of 2014,\n W.P.No.30020 of 2014 and W.P.No.31115 of 2015\n are allowed and impugned Seniority List dated\n 09.09.2015 and amended office order dated\n 26.12.2013 issued by the respondent-BBMP is\n quashed; and the respondent-BBMP is directed to re-\n\n consider the issue afresh after taking into\n consideration the various Government orders\n\n referred to above and the provisions under Rule 6 of\n Karnataka Civil Service (Seniority) Rules, 1957, by\n extending opportunity to the petitioners\n herein/aggrieved parties and take decision in the\n matter in accordance with law in the light of the\n observations made above, within three (3) months\n from the date of receipt of this order.\n\n ii) W.P.No.13970 of 2014 and W.P.No.13798 of 2014\n are dismissed.\n\n SD/-\n\n JUDGE",

      "text": "\"21. We may examine the question from a different\n point of view. There is not much difference between\n deputation and transfer. Indeed, when a deputationist is\n permanently absorbed in the CBI, he is under the rules\n appointed on transfer. In other words, deputation may\n be regarded as a transfer from one government\n department to another. It will be against all rules of\n service jurisprudence, if a government servant holding a\n particular post is transferred to the same or an\n equivalent post in another government department, the\n period of his service in the post before his transfer is not\n taken into consideration in computing his seniority in\n the transferred post. The transfer cannot wipe out his\n length of service in the post from which he has been\n transferred. It has been observed by this Court that it is\n a just and wholesome principle commonly applied where\n persons from different sources are drafted to serve in a\n new service that their pre-existing total length of\n service in the parent department should be respected\n and presented by taking the same into account in\n determining their ranking in the new service cadre. \nSee\n \nR.S. Makashi v. I.M. Menon\n; \nWing Commander J. Kumar\n v. Union of India\n.\""
