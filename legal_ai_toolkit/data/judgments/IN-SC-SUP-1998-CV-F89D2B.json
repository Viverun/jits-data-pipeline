AGRAWAL, J.\n\nLeave granted in all Special Petitions.\n\nWhat is meant by \"seniority - cum-merit\", the criterion\nprescribed for promotion the post of Area Manager/Senior\nManager in the Regional Rural Banks under the Regional Rural\nBanks (Appointment & Promotions of Officers and Other\nEmployees) Rules, 1988 [hereinafter referred to as 'the\nRules'] ? This is the common question which falls for\nconsideration in these appeals.\n\nThe regional Rural Banks have been established under\nthe provisions of the Regional Rural banks Act, 1976\n[hereinafter referred to as 'the Act']. Section 17 of the\nAct empowers a Regional Rural Bank to appoint such number of\nofficers and other officers as it may consider necessary or\ndesirable, in such manner as may be prescribe, for the\nefficient performance of is functions and to determine the\nterms and conditions of their appointment and service\nSection 24 of the Act lays down that in the discharge of its\nfunctions a Regional Rural Bank shall be guided by such\ndirections, in regard to matters of policy involving public\ninterest, as the Central Government may, after consultation\nwith the national Bank for Agricultural and Rural\nDevelopment [hereinafter referred to as 'the National\nBank'], give. Under Section 29 of the Act the Central\nGovernment has been empowered to make rules, after\nconsultation with the National Bank and sponsor Bank, for\ncarrying out the provisions of the Act, By clause (ba) of\nsub-section (2) of section 29, which was inserted by the\n\nRegional Rural Banks (Amendment) Act, 1987\n, the Central\nGovernment was empowered to make Rules relating to manner in\nwhich the officers and other employees of the Regional Rural\nBank shall be appointed. In exercise of the powers conferred\nunder\nSection 29\nread with\nSection 17\nof the Act the Central\nGovernment framed the Rules which were published vide\nNotification dated September 28, 1988.\n\nRule 3 of the Rules provides that the Board of\nDirectors of each Regional Rural Bank may, in consultation\nwith its sponsor Bank, create such number of posts as\nspecified in second schedule to the Rules from time to time.\nRule 4 prescribes that the Board of Directors may, in\nconsultation with the sponsor Bank, determine the number of\nvacancies in each post keeping in view the guidelines issued\nby the Central Government from time to time. Rule 5 makes\nprovision for filling of vacancies and provides that all\nvacancies determined under Rule 4 by the Board of Directors\nshall be filled by deputation, promotion or direct\nrecruitment in accordance with the provisions contained in\nthe Second Schedule to the Rules. With regard the post of\nArea/Senior Manager the following provision is made in the\nSecond Schedule to the Rules:-\n\n\"7. Area Managers or Senior Managers\n\n(a) source of Recruitment:\n\nHundred per cent by promotion\nfrom amongst confirmed officers\nworking in the bank. Promotions\nwill be on the basis of\nserniority-cum-merit. If\nsuitable officers are not\navailable internally, these\nposts could be filled by taking\ntemporarily officers of the\nsponsor banks and other banks or\norganisations on deputation'\n\n(b) Qualification & Eligibility :\n\n( i) A Graduate of\nrecognized University or any\nequivalent qualifications\nrecognized as such by Government\nof India, preference being given\nto Agriculture or Commerce or\nEconomics graduates.\n\n(ii) Eight years service as an\nofficer in the regional rural\nbank concerned. provided that\nthe Board may, with the prior\napproval of National Bank, relax\nthe period of service by a\nperiod not exceeding two years,\nif suitable candidates of\nrequisite experience are not\navailable.\n\nNote: The post of Area Managers\nand Senior Managers will be\nequivalent in rank and will be\ninterchangeable.\n\n(c) Mode of Selection :\n\nInterview and assessment of\nperformance reports for the\npreceding three years period as\nofficer for promotion.\"\n\nPrior to the making of the Rule appointment on the post\nof Area/Senior Manager in Regional Rural Banks was governed\nby circulars issued by the Central Government and the\nNational Bank. By circular dated October 10, 1987 addressed\nto the Deputy General manager of the National Bank, the\nCentral Government indicated the criterian that was required\nto be followed in the matter of promotion of Branch Managers\nto the post of Area Managers/Senior Managers in Regional\nRural Banks in the following terms:-\n\n\"....... it is, therefore,\nrequested that the Chairman of all\nthe RRBs may be apprised that since\nthe posts of Area Managers/Senior\nManagers are promotional posts to\nbe filled up 100% by promotion from\nonly one source, the non-selection\nrule of seniority cum merit has to\nbe applied. This rural envisages\npromotion by seniority with due\nconsideration to minimum\nmerit/fitness prescribed. Fitness\nimplies that there is nothing\nagainst the officer. No\ndisciplinary action is pending\nagainst him and none is\ncontemplated. The officer has\nneither been reprimanded nor any\nadverse remarks have been conveyed\nto him in the reasonably recent\npast. The promotions are meant to\nbe made on the above mentioned\nconsideration.\"\n\n[emphasis supplied ]\nIn accordance with the said circular the National Bank\nissued a circular dated December 1, 1987 whereby all the\nRegional Rural Banks were apprised that the matter relating\nto the promotion of Branch Mangers to the posts of\nArea/Senior Managers had been examined by it consultation\nwith the Government of India and the Regional Rural Banks\nwere advised as under: -\n\n\" The posts of Area Managers/Senior\nManagers are promotional posts to\nbe filled up by 100% promotion from\nonly one source and non-selection\nrule of seniority-cum-merit has to\nbe applied. This rule envisages\npromotion by seniority with due\nconsideration to minimum\nmerit/fitness prescribed. Fitness\nimplies that there is nothing\nagainst the officer; no\ndisciplinary action is pending\nagainst him and none is\ncontemplated. The officer has\nneither been reprimanded nor any\nadverse remarks have been conveyed\nto him in the reasonably recent\npast. The promotions are meant to\nbe made on the above mentioned\nconsideration only. In other words,\nif a manager satisfies the\nqualifications and eligibility\ncriteria and there is nothing\nadverse against him, his due\npromotion should not be denied to\nhim.\"\n\nThese appeals can be categorised in two groups, viz.,\nthe Andhra Pradesh group and the Madhya Pradesh group. The\nAndhra Pradesh group of appeals are directed against the\njudgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High\nCourt dated September 23, 1994 in various writ appeals. The\nMadhya Pradesh group of appeals have been filed against the\njudgments of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The main\njudgment, which has been followed by the said High Court in\nother cases, is in L.P.A. No. 151 of 1993 and connected\nmatters decided on October 9, 1996. In the impugned\njudgments, the High Courts of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya\nPradesh have taken the view that if \"seniority -cum-merit\ncriterion is adopted for the purpose or promotion then first\nthe senior most eligible employee has to be tested to find\nout whether he possesses the minimum required merit for\nholding the higher post and only if he is not found suitable\nor fit, his immediate junior may be tested for the purpose\nof promotion. The said view has been assailed by the various\nRegional Rural Banks as well as the promoted officers whose\npromotions have been set aside by the impugned judgments.\n\nIn the matter of formulation of a policy for promotion\nto a higher post, the two competing principles which are\ntaken into account are inter se seniority and comparative\nmerit of employees who are eligible for promotion.\nIn\nSant\nRam Sharma v. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n, 1968 (1) SCR 111,\nthis court has pointed out that the principle of seniority\nensures absolute objectivity by requiring all promotion to\nbe made entirely on grounds of seniority and that if a post\nfalls vacant it is filled by the person who had served\nlongest in the post immediately below. But the seniority\nsystem is so objective that it fails to take any account of\npersonal merit. It is fair to every official except the best\nones, an official has nothing to win or lose provided he\ndoes not actually become so inefficient that disciplinary\naction has to be taken against him. The criterion of merit,\non the other hand, lays stress on meritorious performance\nirrespective of seniority and even a person, though junior\nbut much more meritorious performance irrespective of\nseniority and even a person, though junior but much more\nmeritorious than his seniors, is selected for promotion. The\nCourt has expressed the view that there should be a correct\nbalance between seniority and merit in a proper promotion\npolicy. the criteria of seniority cum-merit' and 'merit-cum-\nseniority' which take into account seniority as well as\nmerit seek to achieve such a balance.\n\nThe principle of 'merit-cum-seniority' lays greater\nemphasis on merit and ability and seniority plays a less\nsignificant role. Seniority is to be given weight only when\nmerit and ability are approximately equal. In the context of\nRule 5(2) of the Indian Administrative Service/Indian Police\nService (Appointment by promotion) Regulations, 1955 which\nprescribed that \"selection for inclusion in such list shall\nbe based on merit and suitability in all respects with due\nregard to seniority\" Mathew. J. in\nUnion of India v. Mohan\nLal Capoor & Ors.\n, 1974 (1) SCR 797, has said :-\n\n\" .... for inclusion in the list,\nmerit and suitability in all\nrespects should be the governing\nconsideration and that seniority\nshould play a secondary role. It is\nonly when merit and suitability are\nroughly equal that seniority will\nbe a determining factor, or if it\nis not fairly possible to make an\nassessment inter se of the merit\nand suitability of two eligible\ncandidates ad come to a firm\nconclusion, seniority would tilt\nthe scale.\" [p.801]\nSimilarly, Beg J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was)\nhas said :-\n\n\" Thus, we thin that the correct\nview, in conformity with the plain\nmeaning of words used in the\nrelevant rules, is that the\n\"entrance\" or \"inclusion\" test for\na place on the select list, is\ncompetitive ad comparative applied\nto all eligible candidates and not\nminimal like pass marks at an\nexamination. The Selection\nCommittee has an unrestricted\nchoice of the best available\ntalent, from amongst eligible\ncandidates, determined by reference\nto reasonable criteria applied in\nassessing the facts revealed by\nservice records of all eligible\ncandidates so that merit and not\nmere seniority is the governing\nfactor.\" [p.817]\nOn the other hand, as between the two principles of\nseniority and merit, the criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit'\nlays greater emphasis on seniority.\nIn state of\nMysore &\nAnr. v. Syed Mahmood & Ors.\n, 1968 (3) SCR 363, while\nconsidering Rule 493)(b) f the Mysore State Civil Services\nGeneral Recruitment Rules, 1957 which required promotion to\nbe made by selection on the basis of seniority-cum-merit,\nthis Court has observed that the rule required promotion to\nbe made by selection on the basis of \"seniority subject to\nthe fitness of the candidate to discharge the duties of the\npost from among persons eligible for promotion\". It was\npointed out that where the promotion is based on seniority-\ncum-merit the officer cannot claim promotion as a matter of\nright by virtue of his seniority alone and if he is found\nunfit to discharge the duties of the higher post, he may be\npassed over and an officer junior to him maybe promoted.\n\nIn\nState of Kerala & Anr. v. N.M. Thomas & Ors.\n, 1976\n(1) SCR 906, A.N. Ray CJ. has thus explained the criterion\nof 'seniority-cum-merit':-\n\n\" With regard to promotion the\nnormal principles are either merit-\ncum-seniority or seniority-cum-\nmerit. seniority-cum-merit means\nthat given the minimum necessary\nmerit requisite for efficiency of\nadministration, the senior though\nthe less meritorious shall have\npriority.\" [p.930]\nThe learned counsel for the Regional Rural Banks and\nthe promoted officers have, however, placed reliance on Para\n7(c) of the Second Schedule to the Rules which prescribes\nthat the mode of selection for promotion would be interview\nand assessment of performance reports for the preceding\nthree years periods and have submitted that under the\ncriterion of 'seniority-cum-merit', as prescribed under the\nRules, comparative merit has to be assessed for the purpose\nof promotion. Reliance has been placed on the following\nobservations in\nState of Mysore v. C.R. Seshadri & Ors.\n,\n1974 (3) SCR 87 : -\n\n\"However, if the criterion for\npromotion is one of the seniority-\ncum-merit, comparative merit has to\nbe assessed if length of service is\nequal or an outstanding junior is\navailable for promotion.\" [p.89]\nThe learned counsel for the Regional Rural Banks and\nthe promoted officers have also placed reliance on the\ndecision of this Court in\nJagathigowda, C.N. & Ors. v.\nChairman, Cauvery Gramina Bank & Ors.\n, 1996 (9) SCC 677.\n\nPara 7(c) of the Second Schedule to the Rules does not,\nin our opinion, lend support to the contention that the\ncriterion of seniority-cum-merit envisaged by the Rule\nmaking authority involves assessment of comparative merit\nfor the purpose of promotion. The word \"selection\" has been\nused in the sense of selecting an officer for promotion on\nthe basis of the criterion of seniority-cum-merit. The\nrequirement that such selection shall be made on the basis\nof interview and assessment of performance reports for the\npreceding three years is consistent with the criterion of\nseniority-cum-merit as explained in the state of\nKerala &\nAnr. v. N. M. Thomas\n& ors. (supra) that \"given the\nnecessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration\"\n\nthe senior though the less meritorious shall have priority.\nThe said mode enables an assessment to be made about the\nminimum necessary merit requisite fr efficiency of\nadministration and it cannot be construed as importing\nassessment of comparative merit of the officers eligible for\npromotion.\n\nIn\nC.R. Seshadri\n(supra) the Court was considering the\nquestion whether High Court could have given a direction to\nthe State to give to the respondent therein notional\npromotion to the post of Deputy Secretary with effect from\nthe date on which his junior secured such promotion. This\nCourt said that such a direction could not be given by the\nHigh Court because promotion of a government servant was\nbasically in government's discretionary power and that in\nthe absence of positive proof of the relevant service rules\nit was hazardous to assume that by efflux of time the\nrespondent would have spiralled upto Deputy Secretaryship\nand that the proper direction could only be that government\nwould reconsider the case of the respondent afresh for\npurpose of notional promotion. in that context, this Court\npointed out that if the rule of promotion is one of 'sheer\nseniority' it may well be that promotion is a matter of\ncourse and that if seniority-cum-merit is the rule,\npromotion is problematical. Since the relevant rule\ngoverning promotion to the post of Deputy Secretary had not\nbeen placed before it, the Court was not required to define\nthe criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' and to delineate the\nfine distinction between the criterion of 'seniority-cum-\nmerit' and the criterion of 'merit-cum-seniority' in the\nmatter of promotion. In the observations on which reliance\nhas been placed by the learned counsel for the Rural Banks\nand the promoted officers the distinction between\n'seniority-cum-merit' and 'merit-cum-seniority' has been\nobliterated and both the criterion have been equated. Since\ncomparative assessment of merit is required to be made while\napplying the criterion of 'merit-cum-seniority' has been\nobliterated and both the criterion have been equated.\n\nSince\ncomparative assessment of merit is required to be made while\napplying the criterion of 'merit-cum-seniority' ad for\n'seniority-cum-merit' no such comparative assessment is\nrequired, the aforementioned observations in the case of\n\nC.R. Seshadri\n(supra) on which reliance has been placed\ncannot be regarded as correctly reflecting as to what is\nmeant by the criterion of 'seniority-cum-merit'.\n\nIn\nJagathigowda , C.N.\n(supra) this Court was dealing\nwith promotion made to the post of senior Manager in a rural\nbank which promotion was made prior to the Rules and was\ngoverned by circulars of the National Bank dated December\n31, 1984 and April 7, 1986. Circular dated December 31,1984\nprovided that promotion to the post of Area Manager/Senior\nManager should be on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. By\ncircular dated April 7, 1986 it was prescribed that\nselection of the eligible candidates should be based on\nperformance of respective candidates in the bank to be\nassessed by a Staff Selection Committee after interviewing\nthe candidates. The selection was made by the selection\nCommittee after calling the eligible officers for interview\nin accordance with their seniority and in the interview the\nmarks were awarded according to the performance appraisal\nforms. The officers who obtained 85 marks out of 150 were\nshortlisted for promotion. The performance appraisal\ncomprised of matters such as dimension of work, general\nintelligence, job knowledge, initiative and resourcefulness\netc. The service record of the officers who assailed the\npromotion before the High Court was adverse. In the judgment\nunder appeal the High Court had set aside the promotion on\nthe ground that service record of the recent past should\nhave been taken into consideration and in case there was\nnothing adverse against an officer he could not be denied\npromotion on the ground that some other junior to him was\nmore meritorious and that promotions were made on the basis\nof selection inasmuch as marks were assigned on the basis of\nperformance appraisal and interview. The said judgment of\nthe High Court was reversed by this Court. It was observed\nthat the circular dated April 7, 1986 issued by the National\nBank specifically provided that 'the selection of the\neligible candidates should be based on performance of\nrespective candidates in the bank'. It was held that the\nHigh Court was not justified in holding that the performance\nappraisal could not be taken into consideration while\nconsidering the officers for promotion to the higher rank.\nIt was also observed that \"while making promotion on the\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit the totality of the service\nrecord of the officer concerned has to be taken into\nconsideration\". This judgment, in our opinion, does not make\na departure from the law\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the\nearlier judgments explaining the criterion of 'seniority-\ncum-merit' because in this case the selection had been made\nby taking into account the seniority as well as performance\nand performance was appraised by assigning marks on the\nbasis of performance appraisal and interview. Those who\nsecured 85 marks out of 150 marks were shortlisted for\npromotion which shows that securing 85 marks out of 150\nmarks was treated as the minimum standard of merit for\npurposes of promotion and those who satisfied the said\nminimum standard were selected for promotion on the basis of\nseniority.\n\nOn behalf of the promoted officers it was urged that\nfor the purpose of promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit, seniority means the length of service and that among\nofficers who were appointed on the same date and have the\nsame length of service seniority can have no bearing and\npromotion has to be made on a comparative assessment of\nmerit of such officers. We are unable to agree. while\napplying the principle of seniority-cum-merit for the\npurpose of promotion what is required to be considered is\ninter se seniority of the employees who are eligible for\nconsideration. Such seniority is normally determined on the\nbasis of length of service, but as between employees\nappointed on the same date and having the same length of\nservice, but as between employees appointed on the same date\nand having the same length of service, it is generally\ndetermined on the basis of placement in the selected list\nfor appointment. Such determination of seniority confers\ncertain rights and the principle of seniority-cum-merit\ngives effect to the such rights flowing from seniority. It\ncannot, therefore, be said that in the matter of promotion\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit seniority has no role where\nthe employees eligible for promotion were appointed on the\nsame date and have the same length of service.\n\nWe thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n'seniority-cum-merit' in the matter of promotion postulates\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\nefficiency of administration the senior, even though less\nmeritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made. For\nassessing the minimum necessary merit the competent\nauthority can lay down the minimum standard that is required\nand also prescribe the mode of assessment can be made by\nassigning marks on the basis of appraisal of performance on\nthe basis of service record and interview and prescribing\nthe minimum marks which would entitle a person to be\npromoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nWe may now examine whether the aforesaid criterion has\nbeen correctly followed by the concerned banks in making the\nimpugned promotion. We will first take up the Andhra Pradesh\ngroup of appeals which have been field against the judgment\nof the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated September 23, 1994.\nThese appeals relate to two banks, namely, the Rayalaseema\nGrameena Bank and the Pinakini Grameena Bank. It Would be\nconvenient to deal with the appeals relating to each bank\nseparately.\n\nRayalaseema Grameena Bank :- In March 1988 the\nRayalaseema Grameena Bank decided to create four posts of\nsenior Managers and four posts of Area managers. The Senior\nManagers work in the office whereas the Area Managers work\nin the field. By circular dated March 3, 1988 the Board of\nDirectors of the Rayalaseema Grameena Bank laid down the\nfollowing promotion process:-\n\n\" A) ELIGIBILITY :- The Officers\nwho have put in 8 (Eight) years of\nservice in the Bank in the cadre of\nbranch Manager as on 31-12-1987 are\neligible to be considered for the\npromotion process.\n\nB) MODALITIES :-\n\n------------\n\na) Seniority - 45 marks (0.5 marks\nfor each completed\nmonth of service\nover and above the\nminimum qualifying\nservice)\n\nb)Qualif-\n\nication - 5 marks (Minimum\nqualification\napplicable to the\ncadre shall not be\nreckoned)\nPost Graduation - 1 Mark\nDiploma/s - 1 Mark\nCAIIB - Part I - 1 mark\nCAIIB - Part II - 2 Marks\n(c) Leave - record - 5 marks\n(d) Interview - 30 marks\n(e) Performance - 65 marks\n0.2, These promotions will be\neffective from 1st May, 1988.\n0.3. The eligible candidates will\nbe called for the interview\ndirectly ( Candidates need not\nsubmit any application in this\nregard) \"\n\nFollowing the said promotion process eight Branch managers\nwere promoted with effect from May 1, 1988 in proceedings\ndated May 3, 1988. The Branch Managers who wee promoted as\nArea/Senior Managers on May 3, 1988 assumed office and their\npromotions were not questioned by any employee at that time.\n\nAfter the Rules framed by the Central Government vide\nNotification dated September 28, 1988 came into force the\nRayalaseema Grameena Bank, in September 1989, decided to\ncreate five posts of Area/senior Managers and, by circular\ndated September 27, 1989, formulated the following promotion\nprocess for filling up of these five posts: -\n\n\"1. ELIGIBILITY :-\n\n-----------\n\nAll the Officer (Branch Managers)\nwho have joined the service of the\nBank on or before 1-4-1981 are\neligible to be considered for the\npromotion process.\n\n2. MODALITIES :-\n\n-----------\n\na) Seniority - 34 marks ( 0.75\nmark for each\ncompleted month of\nservice over and\nabove the minimum\nqualifying service)\n\nb)Qualif-\n\nications - 10 marks (Minimum\nqualification\napplicable to the\ncadre shall not be\nreckoned)\nPost Graduation - 3 marks\nDouble Graduation - 1 mark\n(like BL, LLB, B.ED.)\nAny Diploma/s. - 2 marks\nCAIIB - Part I - 2 marks\nCAIIB - Part II - 2 marks\n\n(c) Interview - 20 marks\n\n(d) Performance - 56 marks\nAll the eligible candidates\nwill be called for the interview\ndirectly. (Candidates need not\nsubmit any applications in this\nregard).\"\n\nFollowing that process, five Branch managers were promoted -\ntwo as Area Managers and three as Senior managers - in the\nproceedings dated December 1, 1989.\n\nPromotions made in the proceedings dated December 1,\n1989 were challenged before the Andhra pradesh high court by\none K.V.T. Prasanna Kumar (by filing Writ Petition No. 17263\nof 1989 on December 11, 1989), G. Anantha Raju, P. Sainath\nReddy and C. Vijayakumar Reddy (by filing Writ Petition No.\n3546 of 1990 on February 16, 1990). During the pendency of\nthe said writ petitions P.V. Krishna Murthy filed another\nWrit Petition (writ Petition No. 9692 of 1993) on July 13,\n1993 in the High Court where he assailed the promotions made\non May 3, 1988 but none of the candidates promoted during\nthe year 1988 to the posts of Area/Senior Manager was\nimpleaded as party respondent. All the four Writ Petitions\nwere heard together by a learned single judge of the High\nCourt who, by his judgment dated September 7, 1993, allowed\nWrit Petitions Nos. 17263 and 17279 of 1989 and 3546 of 1990\nand declared that the promotions made on December 1, 1989 to\nthe post of Area/Senior managers form the post of Branch\nManager in the Rayalaseema Grameena Bank were illegal and\nimproper. Writ petition No. 9692 of 1993 filed by P.V.\nKrishna Murthy, in which the promotions made on May 3, 1988\nthe 1988 were assailed, was, however, dismissed on the\nground of laches. Against the said judgement of the learned\nsingle judge Writ Appeals Nos. 1242 of 1993, 1232 of 1993\nand 1238 of 1993 were filed by the Chairman, Rayalaseema\nGrameena Bank, and Writ Appeals Nos. 1233 of 1993 and 1234\nof 1993 were filed by the five Branch Managers whose\npromotions as Area/Senior managers made on December 1, 1989\nhad been quashed by the learned single Judge. Writ Appeals\nNos. 1142 of 1993 and 1224 of 1993 were filed by P.V.\nKrishnamurthy, the petitioner in Writ Petition No. 3546 of\n1990 and Writ Petition No. 9692 of 1993 and Writ Appeal No.\n1210 of 1993 was filed by two of the petitioners in Writ\nPetition No. 17279 of 1989. These appeals related to the\npromotions made on May 3, 1988.\n\nIn Writ Appeal No. 1142 of 1993 a contention was raised\nthat the promotions made on May 3, 1988 had been questioned\nin Writ Petition No. 17263 of 1989. The said contention was\nrejected by the Division Bench of the High Court and it was\nobserved that the prayer in the said writ petition was clear\nand categorical and no relief was sought for in respect of\nthe promotions made on May 3, 1988. In Writ Appeal No. 1210\nof 1993 an application was made seeking amendment of the\nprayer in Writ Petition No. 17279 of 1989 to challenge the\npromotions made on May 3, 1988 but the said application was\nrejected by the learned judges on the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court. As regards challenge to the validity of\npromotions made on May 3, 1988 the learned judges held that\nWrit petition No. 9692 of 1993 had been filed after a lapse\nof about four years after the promotions were effected in\nthe year 1988 and the conduct of the writ petitioners in\nkeeping quiet and submitting themselves to the promotions\nprocess undertaken by the Bank for filling up the posts in\nthe 1989 disentitled them to seek relief in respect of\npromotions made in the year 1988 inasmuch as some rights and\naccrued in favour of the employees promoted on May 3, 1988\nand if their promotions were to be set aside subsequent to\nthe promotions made on December 1, 1989 it would cause them\nirreparable loss. The learned judges on the Division bench\nof the High Court, therefore, dismissed Writ Appeal Nos.\n1142 of 1993, 1224 of 1993 and 1210 of 1993. Civil Appeals\nNos. 3804-3808 of 1996 have been filed against that part of\nthe judgment of the High Court relating to the promotions\nmade on May 3, 1988.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellants in these appeals\nhas submitted that now the appellants do not challenge the\npromotions that were made on May 3, 1988 since they have\nalso been promoted as Area/Senior managers and they are only\nraising the question regrading restoration of the inter se\nseniority of the appellants and the promoted officers on the\npost of Area/Senior Manager. We do not find any merit in\nthis contention. since there was no challenge to the\npromotions made on May 3, 1988 till 1993, the promoted\nofficers had been working for nearly five years by then and\nhad acquired right to seniority on the basis of such\npromotion and they cannot be deprived of the said right. The\nHigh court, in our opinion, has rightly held that the\nbelated challenge to the promotions made on May 3, 1988\nraised by the appellants in these appeals cannot be\nentertained. Civil Appeals Nos. 3804-3808 of 1996 are,\ntherefore, liable to be dismissed.\n\nWrit Appeals Nos. 1242 of 1993, 1232 of 1993 and 1238\nof 1993 filed filed by the Rayalaseema Grameena Bank and\nWrit appeals Nos. 1233 of 1993 and 1234 of 1993 filed by the\nfive Branch managers who were promoted as Area/Senior\nManagers on the basis of proceedings dated December 1, 1989\nwere dismissed by the Division bench of the High Court on\nthe view that the Bank had considered the cases of all the\neligible officers for promotion to the posts of Area/Senior\nManagers and only those who secured highest number of marks\namongst them were ultimately promoted and that this method\nof selection is contrary to the principle of 'seniority-cum-\nmerit'. Civil Appeals No. 3799-3803 of 1996 have been filed\nby the Rayalaseema Grameena Bank, while Civil appeals Nos.\n3811-3812 of 1996 have been filed by five Branch managers\nwho have been promoted as Area/Senior managers in the\nproceeding on December 1, 1989 against this part of the\njudgment of the High Court.\n\nHaving heard the learned counsel for the Rayalaseema\nGrameena bank as well as five branch Managers who had been\npromoted as Area/Senior Managers in the proceedings on\nDecember 1, 1989, we find that no case is made out for\ninterference with the said view of the High Court. The\npromotion process\nlaid down by\nthe Rayalaseema Grameena Bank\nin its circular dated September 27, 1989, on the basis of\nwhich the selection for promotion had been made on December\n1, 1989, sets apart 34 marks for seniority, 10 marks for\nqualifications, 20 marks for interview and 56 marks for\nperformance which shows that out of a total number of 120\nmarks the maximum number of marks that could be awarded for\nseniority is 34 and that 0.75 mark was to be given for each\ncompleted moth of service over and above the minimum\nqualifying service. In other words, if two person are\nappointed on the same day, the same number of marks had to\nbe awarded for seniority. Moreover out of a total number of\n120 marks more than 50% marks were set apart for interview\nand performance. The High Court has found that only those\nofficers who had secured the highest number of marks were\nultimately promoted. It is not a case where minimum\nqualifying marks are prescribed for assessment of\nperformance and merit and those who secure the prescribed\nminimum qualifying marks are selected for promotion on the\nbasis of seniority. In the circumstances, it must be held\nthat the High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that\nthe mode of selection that was in fact employed was contrary\nto the principle of 'seniority-cum-merit\n'\nlaid down in\nthe\nRules. Civil Appeals No. 3799-3803 of 1996 filed by the\nRayalaseema Grameena Bank as well as Civil Appeals Nos.\n3799-3803 of 1996 filed by the Rayalaseema Grameena Bank as\nwell as Civil Appeals Nos 3811-2812 of 1996 filed by the\npromoted officers are, therefore , liable to be dismissed.\n\nPINAKINI GRAMEENA BANK :- On February 19, 1992 the\nBoard of Directors of the Pinakini Grameena Bank decided to\ncreate two posts of Area Managers and four posts of senior\nManagers. The Board formulated the promotion policy and\ncommunicated it to all the branches through its circular No.\n37/PSD/13/92 dated March 16, 1992 which laid down the\nfollowing promotion process :-\n\n\" ELIGIBILITY : The officers\n(managers) who have completed 8\nyears of service as on 31.03.1992\nare eligible for considering the\npromotion to Area/Senior Manager\nposts.\n\nWEIGHTAGE OF MARKS :\n\n-------------------\n\n(a) Seniority : 55 marks\nOfficers (Mana-\n\ngers) who have\ncompleted 8 ye-\n\nars of service\nas per SSR of\nthe Bank.\n\n(b) For passing\nCAIIB Part- I : 2 marks\nCAIIB Part -II 3 marks\n\n(c) performance : 25 marks\n\n(d) Interview : 15 marks\nTotal 100 marks\nFurther, we observe that many of\nthe Officers (Managers) have not\nsubmitted the performance\nappraisals for the years 1989, 1990\nand 1991 to assess their\nperformance. Such officers are\nadvised to submit the performance\nappraisals so as to reach HO : PSD\non or before 31.03.1992. Otherwise,\nwe will be constrained to assess\ntheir performance based on he\ninformation available with us.\n\nA Committee is constituted for the\npurpose of conduction interview as\nper Government of India guidelines.\n\nThe dates of interview will be\nintimated to the candidates\nindividually, in due course.\"\n\nIn the proceeding held on April 20, 1992 five Branch\nManagers were promoted as Area/Senior Managers. Three Branch\nManagers, namely, K. Addanki Babu, P. Raghava Rao and V.C.\nKrishna Prasad filed writ Petition No. 5204 of 1992 in\nAndhra Pradesh High Court wherein they challenged the order\ndated April 20, 1992 regarding the promotion of the said\nfive branch Managers as Area/Senior Managers. The said writ\nPetition was allowed by the learned single judge by his\njudgment dated December 17, 1993 wherein he followed the\nearlier judgement of the learned single judge dated\nSeptember 7, 1993 given in the Writ Petitions relating to\nthe Rayala Seema Grameena Bank . Writ Appeal No. 417 of 1994\nwas filed by the Pinakini Grameena Bank, while Writ Appeal\nNo. 422 of 1994 was filed by the promoted officers whose\npromotion were set aside by the judgment of the learned\nsingle judge. Both these appeals have been dismissed by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court. The learned Judges have\npointed out that the cases of all officers eligible for\npromotions to the posts of Area/Senior Managers were\nconsidered and only those who secured highest number of\nmarks amongst them were ultimately promoted and that this\nmethod of selection is contrary to the principle of\n'seniority-cum-merit'. Civil Appeal Nos. 3809-3810 of 1996\nhave been filed by the Chairman, the Pinakini Grameena Bank,\nwhile Civil Appeal No. 3798 of 1996 has been filed by he\npromoted officers against that part of the judgment of the\nHigh Court.\n\nForm the circular dated March 16,1992 laying down the\npromotion process it is evident that selection was to be\nmade on the basis of marks to be awarded by selection\ncommittee and that out of total number of 100 marks, 55\nmarks were to be awarded for seniority while 25 marks were\nassigned for performance and 15 marks for interview. There\nwas no indication in the said circular as to how 55 marks\nfor seniority were to be given to the Branch Managers who\nwere eligible for consideration for promotion on March 31,\n1992. The said circular did not prescribe minimum qualifying\nmarks for assessment of performance and merit on the basis\nof which an officer would be considered for being selected\nand, as pointed out by the High Court, the selection was\nmade of only those officers who secured highest number of\nmarks amongst the eligible officers. In the circumstances,\nthe High Court, in our view, has rightly held that this\nmethod of selection was contrary to the principle of\n'seniority-cum-merit' and it virtually amounts to the\napplication of the principle of 'seniority-cum-merit' and it\nvirtually amounts to the application of the principle of\n'merit-cum-seniority'. We, therefore, do not find any merit\nin Civil Appeal Nos. 3809-3810 of 1996 and 3798 of 1996 and\nthe same are also liable to be dismissed.\n\nWe would now take up the Madhya Pradesh group of\nappeals of appeals which relate to three banks, namely,\nBaster Kshetriya Gramin Bank, Rewa Sidhi Gramin Bank and\nchhindwara-Seoni Kshetriya Gramin Bank. The appeals relating\nto these banks are also being dealt with separately.\n\nBaster Kshetriya Gramin Bank: - Selection process for\nthe purpose of promotion to the post of Area Manager/Senior\nManager in the Baster Kshetriya Gramin Bank was contained in\nthe circular dated February 16, 1993 . The said selection\nwas made on the basis of interview of all the eligible\nofficers by the Staff Selection Committee as per the Rules\nand a select list of five persons was prepared and on the\nbasis of the said select list promotions were made. The said\npromotions were challenged by three officers who, though\nsenior, were no promoted, by filing Writ Petition Nos. 43\nand 45 of 1993 in the Madhya Pradesh High court. The said\nWrit Petitions were allowed by the learned single judge by\njudgment dated July 24, 1996 on the view that where Rules\nprescribed promotion on the basis of 'seniority-cum-merit'\nthe seniority has to be give due place and merely because a\nperson has a better merit, he cannot be promoted over and\nabove the person senior to him unless he lacks in\nqualification or is other wise found to be unfit, i.e.,\nthere is nothing against him, and that this was not the\nposition in the instant case and that the concept of\nseniority had been given no weightage in this case Letters\npatent Appeals (L.P.A. Nos. 150 and 152 of 1996) filed\nagainst\nthe said judgment\nof the learned single judge were\ndismissed by the Division bench of the High Court by the\nimpugned judgment dated October 9, 1996. The learned judges\non the Divisions Bench have found that the Bank has given\nweightage to merit first and second place has been given to\nseniority and that this shows that the Selection committee\nhas acted contrary to the principles prescribed under the\nRules and that the selections be made by way of merit-cum-\nseniority and not by way of seniority-cum-merit as required\nby the Rules. Civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave\nPetition (C) No. 17780-81 of 1997 have been filed against\n\nthe said judgment\nof the High Court by the promoted officers\nwhose promotion has been quashed by the High Court.\n\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the appellants.\nIt is not disputed that the selection was mad eon the basis\nof marks assigned on the basis of interview by the Selection\nCommittee and those who secured the highest marks were\nselected. The selection process adopted for the purpose of\npromotion to the post of Area Manager/Senior managers was\nthus not in consonance with the principle of 'Seniority-cum\n\n-merit' and the promotions were not made in accordance with\nthe Rules. Civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave\nPetition (C) No. 17780-81 of 1997 are, therefore liable to\nbe dismissed.\n\nRewa Sidhi Gramin Bank : - On February 2, 1989 the\nChairman of the Rewa Sidhi Gramin Bank issued the promotion\npolicy for promotion of Field Supervisors and Officers of\nthe bank to the higher posts. In paragraph 2.3 of the said\npolicy it was prescribed that promotion from 'officer to\nArea/Senior Manager, subject to satisfaction of minimum\nperiod of service, shall be, at present, on the basis of\nassessment of his overall performance based on appraisal\nreports on hm and his potentiality to shoulder higher\nresponsibilities assessed in the interview, duly\nsupplemented by weightages for seniority, job\nresponsibility, placement/posting/mobility\". With regard to\npromotion from Officer to Area/Senior Manager the following\npromotion criteria were laid down:\n\n\"-----------------------------------------------------------\nPromotion percentage Wightage\n\n---------------------------------------------\nSeniority Job resp Placement/ Perfor- Inter\nonsibility posting/ mance view\nmobility\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOfficer\nArea/Senior 15 12 8 40 25\nManager\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAs regards weightage for seniority it was provided in\nParagraph 2.4 that one mark for each completed year of\nservice in the respective cadre/post, subject to a maximum\nof 15 marks in respect of promotion from Officer to\nArea/Senior Manager would be give. It was further:-\n\n\" 2.9. Candidates who have secured\nless than 40% marks in interview\nwill not be considered for\npromotion and their names will not\nbe included in the final merit\nlist.\n\n2.10 . This list of successful\ncandidates in the order of total\nmarks obtained will be placed by\nthe Staff selection committee\nbefore the Board, duly recommended\nfor consideration for appointment\nor promotion.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nOn bench of the High Court has followed its earlier\njudgment dated July 4, 1994 in L.P.A. No. 120 of 1997 which\njudgment was based on the earlier judgment dated October 9,\n1996 passed in L.P.A. No. 151 of 1996 and other connected\nmatters. Civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition\n(C) Nos. 17780-81 of 1997 filed against the judgment dated\nOctober 9, 1996 have been dismissed. For the same reasons,\nCivil Appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) Nos.\n19965-19966 of 1997 are also liable to be dismissed inasmuch\nas according to the promotion policy dated February 2, 1989\nselection was made on the basis of total number of marks\nobtained by the eligible candidates. The Criterion of the\npromotion policy cannot be regarded as being in consonance\nwith the principle of 'seniority-cum-merit' as prescribed\nunder the Rules. Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave\nPetition (C) Nos. 19965-19966 of 1997 are, therefore,\ndismissed.\n\nChhindwara - Seoni Kshetriy Gramin Bank : By order\ndated April 8, 1993 promotions were made to the post of\nArea/Senior Manager in the Chhindwara - Seoni Kshetriya\nGramin Bank on the basis of the recommendations made by a\nselection Committee. The said recommendations were made on\nthe basis of marks awarded after interview and assessment of\nthe performance of the candidates eligible for promotion.\nThe said promotions were challenged before the Madhya\nPradesh High court by filing a Writ Petition (M.P. No. 1931\nof 1993) which has been allowed by the learned single judge\nby his judgment dated February 7, 1997 in view of the\nearlier judgment dated July 24, 1996 passed in M.P. No. 943\nof 1993. The said judgment was based on the judgment of the\nDivision Bench of the High Court in L.P.A. No. 151 of 1996.\nCivil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No.\n7321 of 1997 has been filed by one of the promoted officers\nagainst\nthe said judgment\nof the learned single judge of the\nHigh Court.\n\nDuring the course of hearing of the appeal the learned\ncounsel for the respondent - Bank has placed before us the\nrelevant documents relating to the impugned selection and\npromotion. On a perusal of the said documents we find that\n50 marks out of the total of 100 marks were prescribed as\nthe minimum qualifying marks for interview and only those\nwho had obtained the qualifying marks in interview were\nselected for promotion on the basis of seniority. it was,\ntherefore, a case where a minimum standard was prescribed\nfor assessing the merit of the candidates and those who\nfulfilled the said minimum standard were selected for\npromotion on the basis of seniority. In the circumstances,\nit cannot be said that the selection has not been made in\naccordance with the principle of 'seniority-cum-merit'. We\nare, therefore, unable to uphold the impugned judgment of\nthe High Court. The appeal has to be allowed and the\nimpugned judgment of the High Court dated February 7, 1997\npassed by the learned single Judge of the High Court has to\nbe set aside and the promotion of the appellant on the post\nof Area/Senior Manager under order dated April 8, 1993 has\nto be affirmed.\n\nIn the result, Civil Appeal Nos. 3798 of 1996, 3809-\n3810 of 1996, 3799-3803 of 1996, 3811-3812 of 1996, 3804-\n3808 of 1996 and Civil Appeals arising out of Special Leave\nPetition (C) Nos. 177/0-17781 of 1997 and 19965-19966 of\n1997 are dismissed.\n\nCivil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No.\n7321 of 1997 is allowed and the judgment of the Madhya\nPradesh High Court dated February 7, 1997 in M.P. No. 1931\nof 1993 is set aside and the said writ petition is\ndismissed. No order as to costs.",
