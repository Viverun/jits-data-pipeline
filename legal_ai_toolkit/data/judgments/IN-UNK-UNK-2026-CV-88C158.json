OF 2008\n [arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 18307 of 2007]\n\nP.S. Gopinathan .... Appellant\n\n vs.\n\nState of Kerala & Ors. ...Respondents\n\n JUDGMENT\n\nP.P. NAOLEKAR, J.:\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. The appellant was directly recruited to the post of Munsiff and\n\nwas later promoted to the post of Subordinate Judge. Thereafter, the\n\nappellant was promoted to the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service,\n\nwhereas the respondents 3 to 5 were directly recruited to the Higher\n\nJudicial Service.\n\n3. The subordinate judiciary in the State of Kerala consisting of\n\nDistrict Judges, Chief Judicial Magistrates, Subordinate Judges,\n\nMunsiffs, Judicial Magistrates of the First Class, Judicial Magistrates\n\n\f 2\n\nof the Second Class, was functioning in the matter of appointment\n\nand promotions as two separate wings, (1) consisting of the Kerala\n\nState Higher Judicial Service and the Kerala Civil Judicial Service\n\nand (2) the Kerala Criminal Judicial Service. The Higher Judicial\n\nService consisted of District Judges. The Kerala Civil Judicial\n\nService consisted of Subordinate Judges and Munsiffs, whereas the\n\nKerala Criminal Judicial Service consisted of Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrates, Judicial Magistrates of the First Class and Judicial\n\nMagistrates of the Second Class. The Civil Judicial Service and the\n\nCriminal Judicial Service came into being as a result of the orders\n\nissued under G.O.(Ms) 24/73/Home dated 12.2.1973 and with that the\n\nsubordinate judiciary was also bifurcated for the first time into Civil\n\nWing and Criminal Wing. The Higher Judicial Service all along\n\nconstituted one separate Service to which after the implementation of\n\nthe G.O. dated 12.2.1973, only the Civil Judicial Service Officers are\n\neligible to be considered. Thus, there was subordinate Civil Judicial\n\nService and the Criminal Judicial Service. Promotion to the Higher\n\nJudicial Service was available from the Kerala Civil Judicial Service\n\nonly.\n\n4. The Higher Judicial Service was constituted under the Kerala\n\nState Higher Judicial Service Rules published on 18.7.1961. It\n\n\f 3\n\nconsisted of two categories : Category 1 - Selection Grade District &\n\nSessions Judge and Category 2 : District & Sessions Judge (including\n\nAdditional District & Sessions Judge). Appointment to Category 2\n\nwas to be made by transfer (promotion) from the category of Civil\n\nJudicial Service or by direct recruitment from the Bar. The number of\n\nposts to be filled up by direct recruitment is 1/3rd of the permanent\n\nposts in Categories (1) and (2) taken together. While under the said\n\nRules, a select list of subordinate Judges (Civil category) was\n\nprepared on 8.1.1991 and approved by the Administrative Committee\n\nof the High Court, was also approved by the Full Court on 11.1.1991.\n\nThe Government also approved the select list of Subordinate Judges\n\nby its order dated 19.11.1991 for appointment as District & Sessions\n\nJudges. The appellant was ranked No. 2 in the said list. A letter\n\ndated 10.12.1991 was addressed by the Registrar, High Court, to the\n\nCommissioner and Secretary to the Government in Home\n\nDepartment, wherein it was stated that the sanction had been\n\naccorded for the establishment of three Special Courts at\n\nThiruvananthapuram for the trial of mark list cases in the light of the\n\nSupreme Court direction dated 20.8.1991; the Government had also\n\nsanctioned three posts of District Judges; as per the Government\n\n\f 4\n\nOrder, the Government had approved 11 Sub-Judges for appointment\n\nas District Judges in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service and in\n\norder to provide three District Judges in the new Special Courts to be\n\nestablished at Thiruvananthapuram, the actual appointment as District\n\nJudges of the following three officers was considered necessary to be\n\nmade:(i) P.S. Gopinathan; (ii) K.S. Gopinathan Pillai; and (iii) M.V.\n\nViswanathan; and, therefore, the Government orders and notifications\n\nappointing the above three officers as a panel of District Judges in the\n\nKerala State Higher Judicial Service may be issued immediately.\n\n5. In place of the Kerala Civil Judicial Service and the Kerala\n\nCriminal Judicial Service, a common Service was brought into force\n\nby the Kerala Judicial Service Rules, 1991 published in the Gazettee\n\non 31.12.1991 and amendment to the Kerala Higher Judicial Service\n\nRules, 1961 vide G.O.(P) No. 47/92/Home dated 28.2.1992 was given\n\nretrospective effect from 1.1.1992, the date of coming into force of\n\nthe Kerala Judicial Service Rules. The common Service constituted\n\nunder the said Rules consisted of the following categories of officers:\n\n Category 1 : Subordinate Judges/Chief Judicial Magistrates\n Category 2: Munsiffs/Magistrates.\n\n\f 5\n\n6. After the enactment of the Kerala Judicial Service Rules, 1991,\n\nthe Governor in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of\n\nArticle 233(1)\n appointed three Sub-Judges, including the appellant, as\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service\n\non 14.1.1992, without prejudice to the claims of candidates to be\n\nrecruited from the Bar to satisfy the provisions in Rule 2(b) of the\n\nKerala State Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1961.\n\n7. Before the appointment order of the appellant was issued on\n\n14.1.1992, the new Rules integrating two lower subordinate Services\n\nhad come into force and the question arose whether the vacancies in\n\nthe three courts created as per the direction of the Supreme Court\n\nwould be filled up by temporary appointments and the order of the\n\nGovernor issued could be treated as appointing the officers\n\ntemporarily without there being any claim of seniority by the officers\n\nwho had been appointed to fill up those vacancies. The\n\nAdministrative Committee of the High Court approved and made the\n\nfollowing recommendations among other matters:\n\n \"(1) The panel of Sub Judges prepared by the High Court and\n approved by the Government be annulled except in the case of\n those already appointed from the panel;\n\n (2) Even in the case of those appointed from the panel after\n 1.1.1992, their appointment may be treated as temporary\n\n\f 6\n\n without probationary rights. Their seniority in the category be\n decided later after a fresh panel is prepared;\n\n (3) Steps be taken to prepare a fresh panel for appointment\n as District Judges from among Sub Judges/Chief Judicial\n Magistrates in service on 1.1.1992;\n\n (4) While taking such steps, the case of Shri K.N.\n Balakrishna Panicker, the senior most Sub Judge who had been\n superseded last time, be considered after assessing his\n judgments.\"\n\nThe Committee recommended that the case of K.N. Balakrishna\n\nPanicker (respondent No. 6), the senior-most Sub-Judge who had\n\nbeen superseded last time be also considered after assessing his\n\njudgments. The Full Court approved the recommendations made by\n\nthe Administrative Committee.\n\n8. From the Official Memorandum issued by the High Court dated\n\n9.9.2005, the reason for taking the decision for posting the appellant\n\non a temporary basis appears to be that the select list was prepared on\n\nthe basis of the seniority list which had been prepared before the\n\nintegration of the two Services, i.e. Civil Judicial Service and\n\nCriminal Judicial Service. After the integration of the two Services,\n\nthe select list was prepared and the appointment order was issued on\n\nthe said basis, whereas before the appointment order was issued on\n\n14.1.1992, the rules were amended and the two Services were\n\n\f 7\n\nintegrated. Therefore, there was a necessity to prepare the fresh\n\nseniority list in the light of the integration of the Civil and Criminal\n\nWings of the State Subordinate Judiciary w.e.f. 1.1.1992. Pending\n\npreparation of the combined seniority list, a posting order was issued\n\nwithout any probationary rights.\n\n9. On 29.2.1992, the High Court passed the order with regard to\n\nthe posting of the appellant who had been appointed as a District\n\nJudge in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service and he was posted\n\nas an Additional District Judge, Kozhikode and was directed to hand\n\nover his charge to the Additional Sub-Judge, Vadakara. The posting\n\nof the appellant along with other officers was made temporary\n\nwithout probationary rights and their seniority in the category of the\n\nDistrict Judges was to be determined later. By this order, the High\n\nCourt posted the appellant as Additional District Judge on temporary\n\nbasis without probationary rights and seniority was left open to be\n\nconsidered on a later date.\n\n10. The appellant joined service on 7.3.1992 as per the posting\n\norder. Respondents 3 to 5 were the direct recruits from the Bar to the\n\nHigher Judicial Service.\n\n11. On 29.2.1992, Rule 2(b) of the Rules was substituted by\n\nproviding for the category of Chief Judicial Magistrates also to be a\n\n\f 8\n\nfeeder category for appointment to Category (2) of the Kerala State\n\nHigher Judicial Service under the Service Rules, which came into\n\neffect on 1.1.1992. While so, respondents 3 to 5 were directly\n\nappointed as District Judges by the Governor. Respondents 3 and 4\n\nwere appointed on 31.3.1992 and they took charge on 2.4.1992,\n\nwhereas respondent 5 was appointed by order dated 30.5.1992 and he\n\ntook charge on 1.6.1992.\n\n12. After the introduction of Service Rules, 1991, which came into\n\neffect on 1.1.1992, the High Court drew a fresh panel of Sub-Judges\n\nand Chief Judicial Magistrates for promotion as District & Sessions\n\nJudges from the integrated seniority list of Sub-Judges and Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrates. The fresh panel was approved by the Full Court\n\non 21.2.1992.\n\n13. On 15.7.1992, the Governor of Kerala approved the panel of\n\nSub-Judges and Chief Judicial Magistrates for appointment as District\n\n& Sessions Judges in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service,\n\nwithout prejudice to the claim of the candidates to be recruited from\n\nthe Bar as provided in Rule 2(b) of the Kerala State Higher Judicial\n\nService Rules, 1961. In the said panel, respondent 6 (K.N\n\nBalakrishna Panicker) was shown at Sl.No.1, whereas the appellant\n\nwas at Sl.No.2. On the same day, the Governor of Kerala was\n\n\f 9\n\npleased to appoint the Sub-Judges and Chief Judicial Magistrates at\n\nSl.Nos. 1 to 8 in the panel approved in the Government Order as\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judges in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service\n\nwithout prejudice to the claims of the candidates to be recruited from\n\nthe Bar. This appointment order indicates respondent 6 at Sl. No.1\n\nand the appellant at Sl.No.2.\n\n14. On 31.7.1992, the High Court passed an order whereunder the\n\nappellant who was posted in the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,\n\nKozhikode (now temporary District Judge) who had been appointed\n\nas District & Sessions Judge in the Kerala State Higher Judicial\n\nService as per the Government Order, was allowed to continue in the\n\npresent post as regular District Judge. This order indicates that the\n\nappellant was appointed temporarily as District Judge and by a later\n\nappointment order issued by the Governor he was treated as a regular\n\nDistrict Judge and was allowed to continue on the same post.\n\n15. On the basis of the office memorandum of High Court dated\n\n29.9.1992, it was proposed to show the seniority of the appellant\n\nbelow the 6th respondent. The appellant made a representation on\n\n28.10.1992 to the High Court claiming that his appointment as\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge should not be treated as a temporary one\n\nand to treat him senior to respondents 3 to 6 in the category of\n\n\f 10\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judges. On 16.8.1994, a draft seniority list of\n\nSelection Grade District & Sessions Judges was published. The\n\nappellant was shown below respondents 3 to 6. While the appellant\n\nwas shown at Sl.No. 60, respondents 3 to 6 were shown at Sl.Nos. 56,\n\n57, 58 and 59. The appellant again submitted a representation on\n\n25.10.1994 challenging the assignment of seniority to the respondents\n\nabove the appellant. On 18.1.1995, the High Court issued an order\n\ndeclaring completion of the probation period by the appellant. In the\n\nsaid order, the commencement of the appellant's probation was\n\nshown as on 31.7.1992 (the date when the second posting order was\n\nissued). As per the representation, the commencement of the\n\nprobation of the appellant as on 31.7.1992 could not have been\n\nshown. The appellant was appointed as District & Sessions Judge as\n\nper the order and notification dated 14.1.1992 and joined duty on\n\n7.3.1992 and continued to be in service without any break and, thus,\n\nthe commencement of the period of probation should have been from\n\nthat date. The appellant submitted representation to that effect on\n\n17.4.1995. Thereafter, a reminder representation on 7.2.1998 and\n\nanother representation on 20.5.2000 were made by the appellant. On\n\n18.12.2003, the High Court issued order permitting respondents 3 to\n\n\f 11\n\n5 as Selection Grade District & Sessions Judges in preference to the\n\nappellant. On 8.3.2004, the appellant filed representation\n\nchallenging the seniority list in the category of District & Sessions\n\nJudges in Selection Grade given to the respondents in preference to\n\nthe appellant. On 12.3.2004, the High Court sent a communication to\n\nthe appellant stating that his representations for re-fixation of his\n\nseniority in the cadre of District & Sessions Judge were under\n\nconsideration. The appellant's representation for advancing the date\n\nof his promotion as Selection Grade District Judge would also be\n\nconsidered. Thereafter on 1.9.2004, the High Court gave permission\n\nto respondents 3 to 5 and the appellant to the category of Selection\n\nGrade District Judges with retrospective effect from 3.7.2000,\n\n12.7.2000, 12.7.2000 and 12.7.2000 respectively. In the said order,\n\nthe appellant was shown at Sl.No. 14, whereas respondents 3 to 5\n\nwere shown as Sl.Nos. 11,12 and 13 respectively. The appellant was\n\nshown junior to respondents 3 to 5 in the category of Selection Grade\n\nDistrict Judges. Therefore, the appellant again submitted a\n\nrepresentation on 15.9.2004. On 2.11.2004, the High Court again\n\npermitted respondents 3 to 5 as Super Time Scale District & Sessions\n\nJudges w.e.f. 13.10.2004, 14.10.2004 and 28.10.2004 respectively,\n\n\f 12\n\nwhereas the appellant was retained as Selection Grade District &\n\nSessions Judge. Respondent 6 had already left the Judicial\n\nDepartment while holding the post of District & Sessions Judge and\n\nhe was appointed as Railway Claims Tribunal.\n\n16. On 22.5.2005, the appellant filed a writ petition before the\n\nHigh Court of Kerala challenging the draft seniority list dated\n\n16.8.1994, order dated 18.1.1995 (declaration of the probation of the\n\nappellant), order dated 18.12.2003 (promotion of respondents 3 to 5\n\nto the post of Selection Grade District & Sessions Judges) and order\n\ndated 1.9.2004 [proceedings of the High Court (2nd respondent)\n\npermitting respondents 3 to 5 as Super Time Scale District &\n\nSessions Judges]. On 9.9.2005, during pendency of the writ petition,\n\nthe High Court rejected the appellant's representation for re-fixation\n\nof his seniority in the category of District & Sessions Judges. On\n\n13.10.2005, the appellant's representation challenging the draft\n\nseniority list was also rejected. The appellant challenged the Office\n\nMemorandum dated 13.10.2005 by amendment of the writ petition.\n\nOn 19.2.2007, the learned Single Judge of the High Court referred the\n\ncase to be heard by a Bench of two Judges. It would be pertinent to\n\nnote that in the writ petition the appellant had not challenged the\n\nMemorandum dated 15.7.1992 whereby the Governor of Kerala had\n\n\f 13\n\napproved the fresh panel of Sub-Judges and Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrates for appointment as District & Sessions Judges, the order\n\nof appointment of the appellant from the panel as District & Sessions\n\nJudge in the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service by order dated\n\n15.7.1992 or the posting order dated 31.7.1992 whereby the appellant\n\nwas shown to be a temporary District Judge and was posted as regular\n\nDistrict Judge after the issuance of the order of appointment on the\n\npost of District Judge by order dated 15.7.1992.\n\n17. The Division Bench of the High Court has taken into\n\nconsideration various aspects which had arisen for determination of\n\nthe court, namely, as to which order, i.e. order dated 14.1.1992 or\n\norder dated 15.7.1992 shall be taken to be the first appointment order\n\nwhich is relevant for Rule 2(b) of the Kerala Higher Judicial Service\n\nRules; whether it is open to 2nd respondent- High Court to treat the\n\norder dated 14.1.1992 passed by the Governor under \nArticle 233\n to\n\nhave given the appellant status of a temporary employee appointed in\n\nthe Higher Judicial Service and not to treat that period of service as\n\non probation. The High Court further considered the effect of not\n\nchallenging the orders passed by the Governor on 15.7.1992 and\n\n31.7.1992, by the appellant. Whether the appointment order issued\n\nby the Governor under \nArticle 233\n can be pronounced as having no\n\n\f 14\n\nlegal effect or illegal on account of violation of the rules which\n\nprovide for the integration of Civil and Criminal Wings and the order\n\nof appointment being issued without taking into consideration the\n\nintegrated service on the feeder post.\n\n18. The High Court held that the Governor is the appointing\n\nauthority of the District Judges in the State which shall be done by the\n\nGovernor in consultation with the High Court. The High Court while\n\nissuing the order of posting treated the appellant as temporary and\n\nacted entirely bonafide since the amendment including Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrates in the feeder category for promotion as District Judges,\n\nwas not only on the anvil but, in fact, it was published on the same\n\nday with retrospective effect from 1.1.1992. Since Rule 6 of the\n\nKerala Higher Judicial Service Rules declares that the seniority will\n\nbe determined on the first order of appointment, the High Court has\n\ncommitted an error in treating the appellant's appointment as\n\ntemporary appointment, particularly when there is no indication in the\n\norder of the appointing authority, namely, the Governor, that the\n\nappointment of the appellant was temporary. However, since the\n\nappellant has accepted the posting order treating him to be a\n\ntemporary employee while joining duty, the subsequent orders issued\n\napproving the fresh panel consisting both of Sub-Judges and Chief\n\n\f 15\n\nJudicial Magistrates in purported compliance of the mandate of the\n\nRules as amended, the appointment order of the Governor and\n\nthereafter the posting order indicating him to be a temporary District\n\nJudge and appointing him as regular employed District Judge have\n\nnot been challenged. Thus, the High Court was of the view that\n\nsince the appointment order dated 15.7.1992 issued by the competent\n\nauthority, namely, the Governor, had not been challenged by the\n\nappellant, he cannot challenge the previous order since there can only\n\nbe one appointment order with reference to which seniority can be\n\nascertained under Rule 6 and the High Court took the appointment\n\norder dated 15.7.1992 as the order of appointment of the appellant to\n\nthe post of District Judge in the Higher Judicial Service and\n\nconsequently dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant herein.\n\n19. It is submitted by Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant that the appellant's seniority has to be\n\ncounted from the date of his appointment on 14.1.1992 made by the\n\nGovernor in exercise of the powers under \nArticle 233\n in consultation\n\nwith the High Court. Merely because the rule has been amended with\n\nretrospective effect from 1.1.1992 whereby the feeder post to the\n\ntransfer (appointment) to the category of District & Sessions Judges\n\n(including Additional District & Sessions Judges) was made from the\n\n\f 16\n\ncategory of Subordinate Judges/Chief Judicial Magistrates of the\n\nKerala Judicial Service instead of the category of Subordinate Judges\n\nonly, it is urged by the learned senior counsel that the post being\n\navailable prior to the rule being amended, the appellant's transfer\n\n(appointment) to the post of District & Sessions Judge could not\n\nhave been treated as temporary appointment without probationary\n\nrights. 20. It is urged by Shri Jawahar Lal Gupta, learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing for respondent No. 3 that the appellant was\n\nalthough appointed on 14.1.1992 his appointment for all purposes and\n\nintent as expressly mentioned in the posting order dated 29.2.1992\n\nhad been treated as temporary appointment without probationary\n\nrights which was accepted by the appellant by accepting the fresh\n\nappointment order dated 15.7.1992 as permanent appointment on the\n\npost of Category (2) District & Sessions Judge and, thus, the\n\nappellant cannot now contend that the order dated 14.1.1992 was his\n\nappointment on the permanent basis on the cadre post of Category (2)\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge. That apart, it is submitted by the learned\n\nsenior counsel that the appellant having not challenged the order\n\ndated 15.7.1992 or order dated 31.7.1992 issued by the High Court\n\n\f 17\n\nposting him, is not entitled to get the seniority on the basis of the\n\norder passed on 14.1.1992.\n\n21. Shri L.N. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for\n\nrespondents 4 and 5 has submitted that although the post had accrued\n\nwhen the old rules were in operation, the appointment has to be\n\ntreated under the old rules but authority can certainly say that the\n\nappointment shall not be made under the old rules and can defer the\n\nappointment until the new rules came into force.\n\n22. Shri T.L.V. Iyer, learned senior counsel appearing for\n\nrespondent No. 2 - Kerala High Court has supported the decision\n\ntaken by the High Court in treating the appointment of the appellant\n\ndated 14.1.1992 as temporary appointment.\n\n23. The relevant rules of the Kerala State Higher Judicial Service\n\nRules, 1961, which shall govern the appointment and seniority of\n\nCategory (2):District & Sessions Judges, read as under:\n\n \"1. Constitution.- The service shall consist of the following\n categories, namely:-\n\n Category (1) Selection Grade District and Sessions\n Judge.\n\n Category (2) District and Sessions Judge (including\n Additional District and Sessions Judge).\n\n\f 18\n\n2. Method of appointment.- (a) Appointment to category (1)\nshall be made by the High Court by promotion from\ncategory (2).\n\n (b) Appointment to category (2) shall be made by\ntransfer from category 1, Subordinate Judges/Chief Judicial\nMagistrates of the Kerala Judicial Service or by direct\nrecruitment from the Bar, provided that the number of posts in\ncategory (2) to be filled up or reserved to be filled up by direct\nrecruitment shall be one-third of the permanent posts in\ncategories (1) and (2) taken together.\n\n (c) Appointment by promotion to category (1) and\nappointment by transfer to category (2) shall be made on the\nbasis of merit and ability, seniority being considered only\nwhere merit and ability are approximately equal.\n\n3. Qualification.- (1)(a) No person appointed to category (2)\neither by transfer or by direct recruitment shall be eligible for\npromotion to category (1) unless he is an approved probationer\nin category (2) on the date of occurrence of the vacancy.\n\n(b) Omitted\n\n (2) A candidate for appointment to category (2) from the\nBar shall satisfy, the following general conditions namely:-\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n4. Probation.- (a) Every person appointed to category (2)\nshall, from the date on which he joins duty, be on probation for\na period of two years on duty within a continuous period of\nthree years.\n\n (b) There shall be no probation for category (1).\n\n5. Appointing Authority.- (1) All appointments to category\n(1) shall be made by the High Court.\n\n\f 19\n\n (2) All first appointments to category (2) whether by\n direct recruitment or by transfer, shall be made by Governor in\n consultation with the High Court.\n\n 5A. Postings and Transfers.- All postings and transfers of\n persons appointed to categories (1) and (2) shall be made by\n the High Court.\n\n 6. Seniority.- (1) The seniority of a person appointed either to\n category (1) or category (2) shall, unless he has been reduced to\n a lower rank as punishment, be determined with reference to\n the date of the order of his first appointment to the said\n category:\n\n xxx xxx xxx\"\n\nUnder Rule 1, the cadre of District & Sessions Judges is in two\n\ncategories: Category (1) relates to Selection Grade District &\n\nSessions Judges, whereas Category (2) relates to District & Sessions\n\nJudges (including Additional District & Sessions Judges). Rule 2(b)\n\nprovides for appointment by transfer (promotion) to Category (2) i.e.\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judges (including Additional District &\n\nSessions Judges). Feeder post from 1.1.1992 shall be Subordinate\n\nJudges/Chief Judicial Magistrates of the Kerala Judicial Service or by\n\ndirect recruitment from the Bar. Under clause (c) of Rule 2, the\n\neligibility criteria for transfer/promotion to the post of District &\n\nSessions Judge shall be on the basis of merit and ability and seniority\n\n\f 20\n\nshall be taken into consideration only where the merit and ability of\n\nthe promotee officer are approximately equal. Thus, the promotion to\n\nthe post of District & Sessions Judge in Category (2) from the post of\n\nSubordinate Judge/Chief Judicial Magistrate would be on the basis of\n\nmerit-cum-seniority. Under Rule 4, every person appointed to\n\nCategory (2) shall be on probation for a period of two years within\n\nthe continuous period of his service for three years from the date of\n\nhis joining duty on the promoted post. By virtue of sub-rule (2) of\n\nRule 5, the first appointment to Category (2), whether by direct\n\nrecruitment or by transfer, shall be made by the Governor in\n\nconsultation with the High Court. Rule 6 on which the emphasis is\n\nlaid by the appellant is in regard to the seniority of a person appointed\n\neither to Category (1) or Category (2), i.e. District & Sessions\n\nJudges, says that unless the person appointed is reduced to a lower\n\nrank as punishment, his seniority shall be determined with reference\n\nto the date of the order of his first appointment to the said category.\n\nTherefore, for the purposes of ascertaining the seniority of an officer,\n\nthe date of the order of his first appointment will have a relevant\n\nconsideration under the rules.\n\n\f 21\n\n24. It is an admitted fact that on 14.1.1992 the appellant was\n\nappointed on the post of District & Sessions Judge by the Governor\n\nin exercise of the power conferred by clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n,\n\nwithout prejudice to the claim of candidates to be recruited from the\n\nBar to satisfy the provisions of Rule 2(b) of the Kerala State Higher\n\nJudicial Service Rules, 1961. However, as there was an integration of\n\nthe Civil Judicial Service and Criminal Judicial Service, the matter\n\nwas referred to the Administrative Committee and the Committee\n\nrecommended that the entire panel prepared of Sub-Judges (which\n\ndoes not include the Chief Judicial Magistrates) and approved by the\n\nGovernment be annulled except in the case of those already appointed\n\nfrom the panel. The Administrative Committee further recommended\n\nthat the appointment from the panel after 1.1.1992 shall be treated as\n\ntemporary without probationary rights and their seniority in the\n\ncategory be decided later after a fresh panel is prepared and the\n\ndirections were issued for preparation of the fresh panel. This\n\nrecommendation of the Administration Committee was accepted by\n\nthe Full Court. The reason for taking this decision was that the select\n\nlist was prepared on the basis of the seniority list which had been\n\nprepared before integration of two Services. After the integration of\n\n\f 22\n\ntwo Services w.e.f. 1.1.1992, the appointment order was issued by the\n\nGovernor on 14.1.1992 without taking into consideration the\n\nintegrated service of the Sub-Judges and the Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrates. The appointment order of the appellant was issued on\n\n14.1.1992. In pursuance thereof and the decision taken by the High\n\nCourt, a posting order was issued on 29.2.1992. The posting order\n\nclearly specified that the appellant was being posted as Additional\n\nDistrict Judge on temporary basis without probationary rights in the\n\ncategory of District Judges and his seniority in the category of\n\nDistrict Judges will be determined on a later date. The appellant\n\ntook charge of the post on 7.3.1992 without any demur or objection.\n\nWhen the appellant was continuing on the post, respondents 3 to 5\n\nwere appointed as District & Sessions Judges in the quota of direct\n\nrecruits. Later on, a fresh panel for the transfer/promotion was\n\nprepared by the High Court which was approved by the Governor and\n\na fresh appointment order issued on 15.7.1992 without prejudice to\n\nthe claim of the candidates recruited from the Bar. In pursuance of\n\nthe appointment order issued by the Governor on 15.7.1992, on\n\n31.7.1992 the appellant was posted on the same post where he was\n\nserving on the post of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The posting\n\n\f 23\n\norder categorized him as `now temporary District Judge' and he was\n\nallowed to continue on the post as a regular District Judge. The\n\nposting order treated the appellant as a temporary District Judge till\n\nthat date and he was treated as a regular District Judge from the date\n\nof posting, i.e. 31.7.1992, in pursuance of the order issued on\n\n15.7.1992. All along by posting order dated 29.2.1992 as well as by\n\nposting order dated 31.7.1992, the appellant's appointment on the\n\npost of District & Sessions Judge has been treated on temporary\n\nbasis. Yet, the appellant kept silence, accepted the orders and\n\nworked on the post as temporarily appointed and posted District &\n\nSessions Judge. It is after lapse of considerable period he made a\n\nrepresentation on 28.10.1992 complaining that he was appointed by\n\nappointment order dated 14.1.1992 and in pursuance of his posting\n\norders he had joined the duty on 7.3.1992; thereafter he had been\n\ncontinuously working on the post; later on, direct recruitment was\n\nmade whereby three District & Sessions Judges were appointed but\n\nhe was being proposed to be ranked below K.N. Balakrishna\n\nPanicker; he cannot be treated as junior to Panicker in the light of the\n\ndefinition of the term `appointed to service' as occurring under the\n\nrules and other provisions governing service and seniority he is\n\n\f 24\n\nentitled to be ranked above Panicker; in view of the vested rights\n\nwhich accrued to him on the basis of his legal entitlement in the light\n\nof the inclusion of his name in the select list, the admitted vacancy\n\navailable and the order of appointment passed by the Governor, his\n\nappointment as District & Sessions Judge cannot at all be treated as\n\ntemporary.\n\n25. The law of equitable estoppel by acquiescence has been clearly\n\nstated by Fry, J. in Wilmott v. Barber, 1880, 15 Ch D 96, 105: 43 LT\n\n95. It has been said therein that the acquiescence which will deprive\n\na man of his legal rights should amount to fraud. A man is not to be\n\ndeprived of his legal right unless he has acted in such a way as would\n\nmake it fraudulent for him to set up those rights. What, then, are the\n\nelements or requisites necessary to constitute fraud of that\n\ndescription, are stated thus:\n\n (i) The plaintiff (i.e. the party pleading acquiescence) must\n\n have made a mistake as to his legal rights;\n\n (ii) The plaintiff must have expended some money or must\n\n have done some act (not necessarily upon the defendant's land)\n\n on the faith of the mistaken belief;\n\n (iii) The defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know\n\n of the existence of his own right which is inconsistent with the\n\n\f 25\n\n right claimed with the right claimed by the plaintiff. If he does\n\n not know of it, he is in the same position, as the plaintiff, and\n\n the doctrine of acquiescence is founded upon conduct with a\n\n knowledge of your legal rights;\n\n (iv) The defendant, the possessor of the legal right, must know\n\n of the plaintiff's mistaken belief of his rights. If he does not,\n\n there is nothing which calls upon him to assert his own rights;\n\n and\n\n (v) The defendant, the possessor of the legal right must have\n\n encouraged the plaintiff in his expenditure of money, or in the\n\n other acts which he has done, either directly or by abstaining\n\n from asserting his legal right. Where all these elements exist,\n\n there is fraud of such a nature as will entitle the court to\n\n restrain the possessor of the legal right from exercising it, but\n\n nothing short of this will do.\n\nThese principles were followed and applied in many cases in India.\n\n26. The appellant was appointed by the Governor by transfer/\n\nappointment order issued on 14.1.1992 and his seniority was to be\n\nconsidered as provided under Rule 6 of the Rules which says that the\n\nseniority of a person appointed shall be determined with reference to\n\n\f 26\n\nthe date of the order of his first appointment to the category. Thus,\n\napparently when the order dated 14.1.1992 was issued by the\n\nGovernor, it would be the first appointment for the determination of\n\nthe seniority of the appellant. There is nothing in the order dated\n\n14.1.1992 on the basis of which it can be treated to be an appointment\n\non temporary basis made by the Governor. It is apparent from the\n\nposting order dated 29.2.1992 that the High Court, because of the\n\nintegration of two Services w.e.f. 1.1.1992 prior to the issuance of the\n\norder of appointment on 14.1.1992, has treated the order of\n\nappointment as a temporary one and, therefore, the posting order\n\nspecifically mentioned that the appellant's appointment would be\n\ntemporary without there being any probationary rights. Thereafter on\n\n21.2.1992, a fresh panel was prepared by the High Court for the\n\npurposes of transfer/promotion to Category (2):District & Sessions\n\nJudge and the proposal for promotion of the officers in that list has\n\nbeen accepted by the Governor by issuance of the order of\n\nappointment including that of the appellant on 15.7.1992. On\n\n31.7.1992, the appellant's posting order was issued. Posting order\n\nclearly indicated that the appellant was working as a temporary\n\nDistrict Judge and by virtue of the order issued on 15.7.1992 he shall\n\n\f 27\n\nbe treated as permanent District Judge. While issuing the posting\n\norder of the appellant in pursuance of the order dated 14.1.1992, the\n\nHigh Court has committed a mistake in treating it to be an order of\n\ntemporary appointment of the appellant when there was nothing to\n\nthis effect in the appointment order. When the posting order was\n\nissued on 29.2.1992, the appellant was well aware of the order of his\n\nappointment dated 14.1.1992 whereby he was appointed on\n\npermanent basis on the post of District & Sessions Judge, yet when\n\nthe posting order was issued treating him to be a temporary appointee\n\nwhich was inconsistent with the order dated 14.1.1992, the appellant\n\ndid not raise any objection and readily accepting the posting order\n\njoined the service on 7.3.1992 as temporary Additional District\n\nJudge. The posting order dated 29.2.1992 specifically mentioned that\n\nhe has been posted as a temporary Additional District Judge without\n\nany probationary rights and thus the appellant was well aware of the\n\nmistaken belief of the High Court in appointing and posting him as a\n\ntemporary employee. As there was no objection and protest by the\n\nappellant, a fresh panel prepared, recommended and fresh order of\n\nappointment of appellant was issued by the Governor. Again when\n\nthe fresh appointment order was issued on 15.7.1992 by the Governor\n\n\f 28\n\nand the appellant was posted on 31.7.1992 treating his first\n\nappointment order as a temporary appointment, no protest was made\n\nby him. In view of the fact that the Governor issued an order dated\n\n15.7.1992 even when order of 14.1.1992 was in existence, it is\n\napparent that the appointing authority has also treated the first order\n\ndated 14.1.1992 as an order of appointment on temporary basis. It is,\n\ntherefore, apparent from the second appointment order that the\n\nappointing authority as well as the posting authority have all along\n\ntreated the appellant as a temporary District Judge, but the appellant\n\ndid not object on both occasions when he joined on 7.3.1992 and on\n\n31.7.1992 of he being treated as temporary District Judge. The act\n\nand action of the appellant in accepting his appointment as temporary\n\none amounts to his assent to the temporary appointment and the\n\nappellant throughout till he raised an objection on 29.10.1992 has\n\nslept on his right of being appointed permanently on the post of\n\nDistrict & Sessions Judge. By his conduct at the time of the issuance\n\nof the order by the High Court on 29.2.1992 and thereafter issuance\n\nof the second appointment order on 15.7.1992 with full knowledge of\n\nhis own right and the act of the High Court which infringes it, led the\n\nHigh Court to believe that he has waived or abandoned his right.\n\n\f 29\n\nLord Campbel in Cairncross v. Lorrimer, 3 LT 130 held that\n\n\"generally speaking if a party having an interest to prevent an act\n\nbeing done had full notice of its being done, and acquiesce it, so as to\n\ninduce a reasonable belief that he consents to it and the position of\n\nthe others is altered by their giving credit to his sincerity, he has no\n\nmore right to challenge the act to their prejudice than he would have\n\nhad if it had been done by his previous license.\"\n\n27. The aforesaid facts clearly make out an acquiescence of the\n\nappellant of accepting order dated 14.1.1992 being treated as\n\ntemporary appointment order on the post of District & Sessions\n\nJudge and he cannot now be permitted to change his position and\n\nclaim the permanent appointment from 14.1.1992 to claim seniority\n\non the post. Besides this, the High Court has rightly held that in the\n\nabsence of the challenge to the second appointment order dated\n\n15.7.1992 from the fresh panel dated 21.2.1992, that order will stand,\n\nthough later in time, and has to be given effect to as an order of\n\nappointing the appellant on permanent basis under Rule 6 of the\n\nRules.\n\n28. For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is dismissed. However,\n\nthere shall be no order as to costs.\n\n\f 30\n\n ...............................J.\n (P.P. NAOLEKAR)\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nMay 9, 2008.",
