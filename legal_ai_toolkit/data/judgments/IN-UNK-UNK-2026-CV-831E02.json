Precisely, the facts of the case, as emerge from the\n\n record, are that the FIR sought to be quashed in the instant\n\n proceedings, came to be lodged at the behest of respondent\n\n 1\n\n Whether the reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 2\n\n No.2/complainant (hereinafter, 'complainant') who alleged that\n\n on 8.2.2016 at 6.00 pm, petitioner unauthorizedly entered in\n\n her land and uprooted the boundary polls. The complainant\n\n .\n\n also alleged that she tried to stop the petitioners from doing this\n\n unlawful act but the petitioners not only extended threats to her\n\n but also caused damage to her property. Though, after\n\n completion of investigation, police has presented the Challan in\n\n the competent court of law but before the same could be taken\n\n to its logical end, parties have entered into compromise, whereby\n\n they have resolved to settle the dispute inter se them amicably.\n\n In the aforesaid background, petitioners have approached this\n\n court in the instant proceedings for quashing of FIR alongwith\n\n consequential proceedings pending in the competent court of\n\n law.\n\n 3.

Respondent No.2 states on oath that\n\n she of her own volition and without there being any external\n\n pressure has entered into compromise with the petitioners,\n\n whereby they have resolved to settle the dispute inter se them\n\n amicably. She states that the FIR sought to be quashed is result\n\n of misunderstanding and otherwise also the petitioners have\n\n apologized for\n r the damage caused to her property and\n\n compensated her for the same, as such, she shall have no\n\n objection in case, prayer made on behalf of the petitioners for\n\n quashing of FIR alongwith consequential proceedings is allowed\n\n and petitioners are acquitted of the charges framed against\n\n them.

The question which now needs consideration is\n\n .\n\n \nwhether FIR in question can be ordered to be quashed when\n\n Hon'ble Apex Court in \nNarinder Singh and others versus State\n\n of Punjab and another\n (2014)6 SCC 466 has specifically held\n\n that power under\n S. 482\n CrPC is not to be exercised in the cases\n\n which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n\n or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\n private in nature and have a serious impact on society.\n\n \n7. At this stage, it would be relevant to take note of the\n\n judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in \nNarinder Singh\n\n (supra), whereby the Hon'ble Apex Court has formulated\n\n guidelines for accepting the settlement and quashing the\n\n proceedings or refusing to accept the settlement with direction to\n\n continue with the criminal proceedings. Perusal of judgment\n\n \nreferred to above\n clearly depicts that in para 29.1, Hon'ble Apex\n\n Court has returned the findings that power conferred under\n\n \nSection 482\n of the Code is to be distinguished from the power\n\n which lies in the Court to compound the offences under \nSection\n\n 320\n of the Code. No doubt, under \nSection 482\n of the Code, the\n\n High Court has inherent power to quash criminal proceedings\n\n even in those cases which are not compoundable and where the\n\n parties have settled the matter between themselves, however,\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 5\n\n this power is to be exercised sparingly and with great caution.\n\n Para Nos. 29 to 29.7 of the judgment are reproduced as under:-\n\n \"29. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum\n\n .\n\n up and lay down the following principles by which\n\n the High Court would be guided in giving adequate\n treatment to the settlement between the parties\n and exercising its power under \nSection 482\n of the\n Code while accepting the settlement and quashing\n\n the proceedings or refusing to accept the\n settlement with direction to continue with the\n criminal proceedings:\n\n 29.1 Power conferred under \nSection 482\n of the\n Code is to be distinguished from the power which\n\n lies in the Court to compound the offences under\n \nSection 320\n of the Code. No doubt, under \nSection\n 482\n of the Code, the High Court has inherent\n power to quash the criminal proceedings even in\n those cases which are not compoundable, where\n\n the parties have settled the matter between\n themselves. However, this power is to be exercised\n\n sparingly and with caution.\n\n 29.2. When the parties have reached the\n settlement and on that basis petition for quashing\n the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor\n in such cases would be to secure:\n\n (i) ends of justice, or\n\n (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\n While exercising the power under \nSection 482\n\n Cr.P.C the High Court is to form an opinion on\n\n either of the aforesaid two objectives.\n 29.3. Such a power is not be exercised in those\n\n prosecutions which involve heinous and serious\n offences of mental depravity or offences like\n murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n private in nature and have a serious impact on\n\n society. Similarly, for offences alleged to have been\n committed under special statute like the \nPrevention\n of Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by\n Public Servants while working in that capacity are\n not to be quashed merely on the basis of\n compromise between the victim and the offender.\n 29.4. On the other, those criminal cases having\n overwhelmingly and pre-dominantly civil\n character, particularly those arising out of\n commercial transactions or arising out of\n matrimonial relationship or family disputes should\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 6\n\n be quashed when the parties have resolved their\n entire disputes among themselves.\n\n 29.5. While exercising its powers, the High Court is\n to examine as to whether the possibility of\n conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\n\n .\n\n criminal cases would put the accused to great\n\n oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice\n would be caused to him by not quashing the\n criminal cases.\n\n 29.6. Offences under \nSection 307\n IPC would fall in\n\n the category of heinous and serious offences and\n therefore is to be generally treated as crime\n against the society and not against the individual\n alone. However, the High Court would not rest its\n decision merely because there is a mention of\n\n \nSection 307\n IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed\n under this provision. It would be open to the High\n Court to examine as to whether incorporation of\n \nSection 307\n IPC is there for the sake of it or the\n prosecution has collected sufficient evidence,\n\n which if proved, would lead to proving the charge\n under \nSection 307\n IPC. For this purpose, it would\n\n be open to the High Court to go by the nature of\n injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted\n on the vital/delegate parts of the body, nature of\n weapons used etc. Medical report in respect of\n injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\n\n guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie\n analysis, the High Court can examine as to\n whether there is a strong possibility of conviction\n or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak.\n\n In the former case it can refuse to accept the\n settlement and quash the criminal proceedings\n\n whereas in the later case it would be permissible\n for the High Court to accept the plea compounding\n the offence based on complete settlement between\n the parties. At this stage, the Court can also be\n\n swayed by the fact that the settlement between\n the parties is going to result in harmony between\n them which may improve their future relationship.\n 29.7. While deciding whether to exercise its power\n under Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of\n settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where\n the settlement is arrived at immediately after the\n alleged commission of offence and the matter is\n still under investigation, the High Court may be\n liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the\n criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of\n the reason that at this stage the investigation is\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 7\n\n still on and even the charge sheet has not been\n filed. Likewise, those cases where the charge is\n framed but the evidence is yet to start or the\n evidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court\n can show benevolence in exercising its powers\n\n .\n\n favourably, but after prima facie assessment of the\n\n circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\n other hand, where the prosecution evidence is\n almost complete or after the conclusion of the\n evidence the matter is at the stage of argument,\n\n normally the High Court should refrain from\n exercising its power under Section 482 of the Code,\n as in such cases the trial court would be in a\n position to decide the case finally on merits and to\n come a conclusion as to whether the offence under\n\n \nSection 307\n IPC is committed or not. Similarly, in\n those cases where the conviction is already\n recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the\n appellate stage before the High Court, mere\n compromise between the parties would not be a\n\n ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of\n the offender who has already been convicted by\n\n the trial court. Here charge is proved under \nSection\n 307\n IPC and conviction is already recorded of a\n heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question\n of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime\".\n\n 8. Careful perusal of para 29.3 of the judgment\n\n suggests that such a power is not to be exercised in the cases\n\n which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity\n\n or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not\n\n private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Apart\n\n from this, offences committed under special statute like the\n\n \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by Public\n\n Servants while working in that capacity are not to be quashed\n\n merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the\n\n offender. On the other hand, those criminal cases having\n\n overwhelmingly and predominantly civil character, particularly\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 8\n\n arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of\n\n matrimonial relationship or family disputes may be quashed\n\n when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among\n\n .\n\n themselves.\n\n \n9. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case \nGian Singh v. State\n\n of Punjab\n and anr. (2012) 10 SCC 303 has held that power of\n\n the High Court in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or\n\n complaint in exercise of its inherent power is distinct and\n\n different from the power of a Criminal Court for compounding\n\n offences under \nSection 320\n Cr.PC. Even in the judgment passed\n\n in \nNarinder Singh\n's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that\n\n while exercising inherent power of quashment under \nSection 482\n\n Cr.PC the Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity\n\n of the crime and its social impact and it cautioned the Courts\n\n not to exercise the power for quashing proceedings in heinous\n\n and serious offences of mental depravity, murder, rape, dacoity\n\n etc.\n However subsequently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Dimpey\n\n Gujral and Ors. vs. Union Territory through Administrator,\n\n UT, Chandigarh and Ors. (2013( 11 SCC 497 has also held as\n\n under:-\n\n \"7. In certain decisions of this Court in view of the\n settlement arrived at by the parties, this Court\n quashed the FIRs though some of the offences were\n non-compoundable. A two Judges' Bench of this\n court doubted the correctness of those decisions.\n Learned Judges felt that in those decisions, this\n court had permitted compounding of non-\n compoundable offences. The said issue was,\n therefore, referred to a larger bench.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 9\n\n \nThe larger Bench in \nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n\n (2012) 10 SCC 303 considered the relevant\n provisions of the Code and the judgments of this\n court and concluded as under: (SCC pp. 342-43,\n para 61)\n\n .\n\n 61. The position that emerges from the above\n\n discussion can be summarised thus: the power of\n the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or\n FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent\n jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\n\n given to a criminal court for compounding the\n offences under Section 320 of the Code. Inherent\n power is of wide plenitude with no statutory\n limitation but it has to be exercised in accord with\n the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to\n\n secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of\n the process of any Court. In what cases power to\n quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R\n may be exercised where the offender and victim\n have settled their dispute would depend on the facts\n\n and circumstances of each case and no category can\n be prescribed. However, before exercise of such\n\n power, the High Court must have due regard to the\n nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious\n offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\n rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even\n though the victim or victim's family and the offender\n\n have settled the dispute. Such offences are not\n private in nature and have serious impact on society.\n Similarly, any compromise between the victim and\n offender in relation to the offences under special\n\n statutes like \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the\n offences committed by public servants while working\n\n in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for\n quashing criminal proceedings involving such\n offences. But the criminal cases having\n overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour\n\n stand on different footing for the purposes of\n quashing, particularly the offences arising from\n commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\n or such like transactions or the offences arising out\n of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family\n disputes where the wrong is basically private or\n personal in nature and the parties have resolved\n their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High\n Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view,\n because of the compromise between the offender and\n victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and\n bleak and continuation of criminal case would put\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 10\n\n accused to great oppression and prejudice and\n extreme injustice would be caused to him by not\n quashing the criminal case despite full and complete\n settlement and compromise with the victim. In other\n words, the High Court must consider whether it\n\n .\n\n would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice\n\n to continue with the criminal proceeding or\n continuation of the criminal proceeding would\n tantamount to abuse of process of law despite\n settlement and compromise between the victim and\n\n wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice,\n it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end\n and if the answer to the above question(s) is in\n affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its\n jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 8. In the light of the above observations of this court\n in Gian Singh, we feel that this is a case where the\n continuation of criminal proceedings would\n tantamount to abuse of process of law because the\n r alleged offences are not heinous offences showing\n extreme depravity nor are they against the society.\n\n They are offences of a personal nature and burying\n them would bring about peace and amity between\n the two sides. In the circumstances of the case, FIR\n No. 163 dated 26.10.2006 registered under \nSection\n 147\n, \n148\n, \n149\n, \n323\n, \n307\n, \n452\n and \n506\n of the IPC at\n\n Police Station Sector 3, Chandigarh and all\n consequential proceedings arising there from\n including the final report presented under Section\n 173 of the Code and charges framed by the trial\n\n Court are hereby quashed.\"\n\n \n10. Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment dated 4th\n\n October, 2017, titled as \nParbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai\n\n Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others versus State of Gujarat and\n\n Another\n, passed in Criminal Appeal No.1723 of 2017 arising out\n\n of SLP(Crl) No.9549 of 2016, reiterated the principles/\n\n parameters \nlaid down in\n \nNarinder Singh\n's case supra for\n\n accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings. It would\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 11\n\n be profitable to reproduce para No. 13 to 15 of the judgment\n\n herein:\n\n \"13. The same principle was followed in Central\n\n .\n\n \nBureau of Investigation v. Maninder Singh\n (2016)1\n\n SCC 389 by a bench of two learned Judges of this\n Court. In that case, the High Court had, in the\n exercise of its inherent power under Section 482\n quashed proceedings under Sections 420, 467, 468\n\n and 471 read with Section 120-B of the Penal Code.\n While allowing the appeal filed by the Central\n Bureau of Investigation Mr Justice Dipak Misra (as\n the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that\n the case involved allegations of forgery of documents\n\n to embezzle the funds of the bank. In such a\n situation, the fact that the dispute had been settled\n with the bank would not justify a recourse to\n thepower under Section 482:\n\n \"...In economic offences Court must not only keep in\n\n view that money has been paid to the bank which\n has been defrauded but also the society at large. It is\n\n not a case of simple assault or a theft of a trivial\n amount; but the offence with which we are\n concerned is well planned and was committed with a\n deliberate design with an eye of personal profit\n regardless of consequence to the society at large. To\n\n quash the proceeding merely on the ground that the\n accused has settled the amount with the bank would\n be a misplaced sympathy. If the prosecution against\n the economic offenders are not allowed to continue,\n\n the entire community is aggrieved.\"\n\n 14. In a subsequent decision in State of Tamil Nadu\n\n v R Vasanthi Stanley (2016) 1 SCC 376, the court\n rejected the submission that the first respondent was\n a woman \"who was following the command of her\n husband\" and had signed certain documents without\n\n being aware of the nature of the fraud which was\n being perpetrated on the bank. Rejecting the\n submission, this Court held that:\n\n \"... Lack of awareness, knowledge or intent is neither\n to be considered nor accepted in economic offences.\n The submission assiduously presented on gender\n leaves us unimpressed. An offence under the\n criminal law is an offence and it does not depend\n upon the gender of an accused. True it is, there are\n certain provisions in \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n\n relating to exercise of jurisdiction Under Section 437,\n etc. therein but that altogether pertains to a different\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 12\n\n sphere. A person committing a murder or getting\n involved in a financial scam or forgery of documents,\n cannot claim discharge or acquittal on the ground of\n her gender as that is neither constitutionally nor\n statutorily a valid argument. The offence is gender\n\n .\n\n neutral in this case. We say no more on this score...\"\n\n \"...A grave criminal offence or serious economic\n offence or for that matter the offence that has the\n potentiality to create a dent in the financial health of\n\n the institutions, is not to be quashed on the ground\n that there is delay in trial or the principle that when\n the matter has been settled it should be quashed to\n avoid the load on the system...\"\n\n 15. The broad principles which emerge from the\n precedents on the subject may be summarized in the\n following propositions:\n\n (i) Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the\n High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any\n\n court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision\n does not confer new powers. It only recognizes and\n\n preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;\n\n (ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court\n to quash a First Information Report or a criminal\n proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been\n arrived at between the offender and the victim is not\n\n the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the\n purpose of compounding an offence. While\n compounding an offence, the power of the court is\n governed by the provisions of \nSection 320\n of the\n\n Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to\n quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the\n\n offence is non-compoundable.\n\n (iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal\n proceeding or complaint should be quashed in\n exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the\n\n High Court must evaluate whether the ends of justice\n would justify the exercise of the inherent power;\n\n (iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a\n wide ambit and plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to\n secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse\n of the process of any court;\n\n (v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First\n Information Report should be quashed on the ground\n that the offender and victim have settled the dispute,\n revolves ultimately on the facts and circumstances of\n each case and no exhaustive elaboration of\n principles can be formulated;\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 13\n\n vi) In the exercise of the power under Section 482\n and while dealing with a plea that the dispute has\n been settled, the High Court must have due regard to\n the nature and gravity of the offence. Heinous and\n\n .\n\n serious offences involving mental depravity or\n\n offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot\n appropriately be quashed though the victim or the\n family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such\n offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but\n\n have a serious impact upon society. The decision to\n continue with the trial in such cases is founded on\n the overriding element of public interest in punishing\n persons for serious offences;\n\n (vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there\n\n may be criminal cases which have an overwhelming\n or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand\n on a distinct footing in so far as the exercise of the\n inherent power to quash is concerned;\n\n (viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise\n\n from commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or\n similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour\n\n may in appropriate situations fall for quashing where\n parties have settled the dispute;\n\n (ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the\n criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise\n between the disputants, the possibility of a\n\n conviction is remote and the continuation of a\n criminal proceeding would cause oppression and\n prejudice; and\n\n (x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in\n\n propositions (viii) and (ix) above. Economic offences\n involving the financial and economic well-being of the\n\n state have implications which lie beyond the domain\n of a mere dispute between private disputants. The\n High Court would be justified in declining to quash\n where the offender is involved in an activity akin to a\n\n financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The\n consequences of the act complained of upon the\n financial or economic system will weigh in the\n balance.\"\n\n 11. In the case at hand, the offences alleged to have\n\n been committed by the accused do not pertain to offence of\n\n moral turpitude or heinous offences rather the offence alleged to\n\n have been committed is a petty offence and more over\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03/12/2022 20:32:09 :::CIS\n\n 14\n\n compromise has been arrived at inter se parties, as such, no\n\n fruitful purpose would be served in continuing with criminal\n\n prosecution of the petitioners, more so when the complainant\n\n .\n\n has compromised the matter with the accused and she is also\n\n no more interested in pursuing the case further. Otherwise also,\n\n there are bleak and remote chances of conviction of accused and\n\n as such, this court sees no impediment in accepting the prayer\n\n made by petitioners for quashing of FIR.\n\n 12. Consequently, in view of the aforesaid discussion as\n\n well as law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court (supra), FIR No.\n\n 57 of 2016 dated 24.2.2016, registered at Police Station Balh\n\n District Mandi, Himachal Pradesh under Sections 447, 379, 506\n\n and \nSection 34\n of IPC alongwith consequential proceedings,\n\n pending in the court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class,\n\n Court No. 3, Mandi, District Mandi, H.P. is quashed and set\n\n aside.
