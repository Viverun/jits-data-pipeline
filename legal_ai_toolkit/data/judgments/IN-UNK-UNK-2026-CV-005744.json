Under the\nscheme of reorganisation of the services set out in a letter\ndated September 29, 1944 of the Government of India Finance\nDepartment, the central service Class I was to consist of\n(i) Commissioners of Income-Tax (ii) Assistant Commissioners\nof Income-Tax; (iii) Income-Tax Officers Grade I and (iv)\nIncome-Tax Officers Grade-II. Thus Income-Tax Officers Class\nI were to be of two grades, Grade I and II; while Income-Tax\nOfficers Class II were to consist of one grade, namely,\nGrade III. Clauses (a) to (e) of paragraph 2 of the letter\nprescribed the mode of recruitment to the various posts in\nClass I and Class II. Under Clause (d) recruitment to Class\nI Grade II was 20% by promotion from Class II, Grade III and\n80% by direct recruitment via Indian Audit and Accounts\nService etc. examination. Rules regulating recruitment to\nthe Income-Tax Officers (Class I, Grade II) service \"liable\nto alteration from year to year\" were published on May 26,\n1945, by a resolution of the Finance (Central Revenues)\nDepartment. Rule 3 provided that recruitment to Class I,\nGrade II's service shall be made (1) by competitive\nexamination held in India in accordance with Part-II of the\nRules and (ii) by promotion on the basis of selection of\nGrade III (Class II service, in accordance with Part III of\nthe Rules. By Rule 4 of the Government was to determine,\nsubject to the provisions of Rule 3, the method or methods\nto be employed for the purpose of filling any particular\nvacancies, or such vacancies as may be required to be filled\nduring any particular period, and the number of candidates\nto be recruited by such method. Part III of the Rules called\n(Recruitment by Promotion) provided by paragraph 21 that\n\"recruitment by promotion shall be made by selection from\nGrade-III Income-Tax Officers (Class II service) after\nconsultation with the Federal Public Service and that no\nofficer shall have any claim to such promotion as of right\".\n By a letter dated January 24, 1950 the Government of\nIndia laid down certain rules of seniority : (a) as between\ndirect recruits; (b) as between promotees selected from\nClass II and (c) as between direct recruits who completed\ntheir probation in a given year and the promotees appointed\nin the same year to Class I.\n812\n On October 18, 1951 the Government of India addressed a\nletter to all the Commissioners of Income-Tax titled\n\"Income-Tax Officers, Grade-II (Class- I service)-quota of\nvacancies filled by promotions\" wherein it was outlined that\nfor a period of 5 years in the first instance 66 and 2/3 per\ncent of the vacancies in Class-I, Grade-II would be filled\nby direct recruitment by a combined competitive examination\nand the remaining 33 and 1/3 per cent on the basis of\nselection by promotion from Grade-III (Class-II service).\nAny surplus vacancies which could not be filled by promotion\nfor want of suitable candidates would be added to the quota\nof vacancies to be filled by direct recruitment. By a letter\ndated September 5, 1952 the Government of India revised with\na retrospective effect the Rules of Seniority which were\nlaid down on January 24, 1950. Rule 1 (f)(iii) as framed on\nJanuary 24, 1950 which was to the effect that \"the promotees\nwho have been certified by the commission in any calendar\nyear shall be senior to all direct recruits who complete\ntheir probation during that year or after and are confirmed\nwith effect from a date in that year or after\" was revised\non September 5, 1952 as \"officers promoted in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee before the next sitting of the Departmental\nPromotion Committee shall be senior to all direct recruits\nappointed on the results of the examinations held by the\nUnion Public Service Commission during the calendar year in\nwhich the Departmental Promotion Committee met during the\nthree previous years\". Rule 1(f)(iv) of the 1952 Rules dealt\nwith a special situation in which an officer initially\nappointed to Class II service was given seniority in the\nsame manner as a departmental promotee, if subsequent to his\npassing the departmental examination he was appointed to\nClass I on the results of the competitive examination. Rule\n4 of Chapter IX of the Rules of Promotion of the Central\nBoard of Revenue Office Procedure Manual states that the\nprescribed minimum service for an officer of Class-I, Grade-\nII for promotion to Grade-I is 5 years gazetted service\nincluding one year in Class-I, Grade-II. For a promotee from\nClass-II the minimum period of service for promotion to\nClass-I, Grade-I would be actually 4 years service in Class-\nII and one year service in Class-I, Grade-II.\n In an appeal arising out of Writ Petition No. 189-D of\n1962 filed by one S. G. Jai Singhani (who is respondent No.\n358 in Writ Petition No. 66 of 1974 and respondent No. 5 in\nWrit Petition No. 4146 of 1978), a constitutional Bench of\nthis Court held : (i) Rules 1(f)(iii) and (iv) of the\nSeniority Rules framed in 1952 did not violate \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n since they were based on a reasonable classification;\n(ii) Rule 4 of Chapter IX of the Central Board of Revenue\nOffice Procedure Manual did not lead to any discrimination\nas between direct recruits and promotees, since the object\nof the rule was really to carry out the policy of Rule\n1(f)(iii) of the Rules of Seniority and not allow it to be\ndefeated by the recruitment of 5 years' service in Class-I,\nGrade-II itself, before a person could be considered for\npromotion to Class-I, Grade-I; (iii) Rule 4 of the Income-\nTax Officers (Class-I, Grade-II) Service Recruitment Rules\nwas a statutory rule to which a statutory duty was cast on\nthe Government to determine the method or methods to be\nemployed for the purpose of filling of the vacancies and the\nnumber of candidates to be recruited by each method; and\nthat though in the letter of the Government of India dated\nOctober 18, 1951 there was no specific reference to Rule 4,\nthe quota fixed by that letter must be deemed to have been\nfixed in exercise of the statutory power given by Rule 4.\nThere was, therefore, no discretion left to the Government\nof\n813\nIndia to alter that quota according to the exigencies of the\nsituation or to deviate from the quota in any particular\nyear at its own will and pleasure. The quota rule, according\nto the Court, was linked up with the Seniority Rule and\nunless it was strictly observed in practice it would be\ndifficult to hold that the seniority rule contained in rule\nl(f)(iii) was not unreasonable and did not offend \nArticle 16\n\nof the Constitution. The Court suggested that for future\nyears the roster system should be adopted by framing an\nappropriate rule for working out the quota between the\ndirect recruits and the promotees and that a roster n should\nbe maintained indicating the order in which appointments\nwere made by direct recruitment and by promotion in\naccordance with the percentages fixed under the statutory\nrule for each method of recruitment. Thus the direct\nrecruits succeeded substantially in their contentions, the\nquota rule acquired statutory force, appointments of\npromotees in excess of the quota became bad and it became\nobligatory for the Government to prepare a fresh seniority\nlist. Promotees found to have been appointed in excess of\nthe quota admissible to promoteeS had naturally to go down\nin the final gradation of seniority.\n On July 15, 1968 the Government prepared a fresh\nseniority list and filed it in the Supreme Court. That list\nfailed to satisfy promotees as well as direct recruits.\nWhether this seniority list was collect and in accordance\nwith the mandamus which was issued by this Court in S. G.\nJai Singhani`s case, [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703 came up for\nconsideration in four appeals which were disposed of by a\ncommon judgment dated August 16, 1972 reported as Bishan\nSarup Gupta v. Union of India (first Gupta's case) in [1975]\nSuppl. S.C.R. 491. The Court was also called upon to examine\nthe correctness of seven principles enumerated in the\nGovernment letter dated July 15, 1968 governing seniority.\nThe first principle was accepted as good. The second and the\nthird principles were held to be partially incorrect in so\nfor as they excluded reference to all the promotees of 1952.\nThe Court held that the promotees of 1952 should be referred\nto in the seniority list whether they are affected or not,\nthe object being the ascertainment of excess promotions.\nThis Court further held that the rule dated October 18, 1951\nwas not concerned with the Constitution of the cadre but\n\"was concerned with how permanent vacancies were to be\nfilled\" and, therefore, the promotees would be entitled to\n1/3 of the vacancies in any particular year whether or not\nthere was direct recruitment by competitive examination in\nthat year. This ratio of 2 :1 between the direct recruits\nand the promotees could not be made to depend on whether any\ndirect recruits were appointed in any particular year. It,\ntherefore, became essential to determine the actual\nvacancies in the cadre but the Government put forward the\nplea even in this case as in Jai Singhani's that it was\nimpossible for them to give the exact figure of vacancies in\nany particular year. According to the Court, when the quota\nrule referred to vacancies it was implicit that the\nvacancies are those which the Government wanted to fill up\nwhatever may be the actual number of vacancies available for\nbeing filled up. Any number of posts among the promotees\nmore than 1/3 of the total number of appointments in the\nparticular year was considered to be in excess of the quota\navailable for promotees. The Court rejected the argument\nthat the quota rule which is co-related to vacancies of\npermanent posts only and not to those in temporary posts.\nWhile upholding the weightage allowed under Rule I (f) (iii)\nto Class-II officers promoted to Class-l, Grade-II, the\nCourt also held that even after 1956, the Government was\nentitled by reason of Rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules of\n1945 to follow the quota rule of 1951 as a rough guideline,\n\"without going through the trouble of putting the same on\nrecord in so many words\" and\n814\nthat in the normal course the Government was entitled to\nprepare the seniority list till the end of 1958 in\naccordance with the quota rule of 1951. In regard to the\nposition after year 1958 the Court came to the conclusion\nthat the quota rule ceased to apply and came to an end on\nJanuary 16, 1959, when the sanction to upgrade 100 temporary\nposts in Class-II, Grade-III to Class-I, Grade-II was given\nby the President. The seniority rule then fell with quota\nrule. On these considerations the Court held that the\nseniority list. was valid in regard to promotions made up to\nJanuary 15, 1959 to the. extent that it was prepared on the\nbasis of the quota rule dated October 18,1951 read with\nSeniority Rule l(f)(iii). As a corollary, the Court set\naside the seniority list of July 15, 1968 and directed the\nGovernment to prepare a fresh seniority list. The List for\nthe years 1955 to January 15, 1959 was directed to be\nprepared in accordance with the quota rule of 1951 read with\nSeniority Rule l(f) (iii). The List to be effective from\nJanuary ]6, 1959 was directed to be prepared in accordance\nwith the rules to be made afresh by the Government.\n On February 9, 1973 the President made rules called the\nIncome-Tax (CIass-I) Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules\n1973 under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution giving\nretrospective effect from January 16, 1969. In pursuance of\nthe liberty reserved to the parties under the Judgment in\nthe first Gupta's case the validity of the new seniority\nrules was challenged by the promotees once again. The\nchallenge was considered and repelled by the Court in Bishan\nSwarup Gupta etc. v. Union of India and Ors.[1975] 1 S.C.R.\n104, second Gupta's case., When the new list of seniority\nwas prepared by the Government, in accordance with these\nrules, the Government had on its hand 73 promotees who\nthough appointed earlier between 1956 and 1958 had no quota\npost, for their absorption. The 73 promotees described as\n\"spill-overs on January 15, 1959\", as also those who were\npromoted subsequently had to be absorbed in the Service,\nwhich could only be done by a special rule framed in that\nbehalf. The new seniority rule contained a formula for the\nabsorption OF all promotees with effect from January 16,\n1959 in posts allocated to them, it determined their\nseniority inter se and last but not the least it determined\ntheir seniority qua the direct recruits appointed from 1959.\nThe Court overruled the objection of the '73' spill-over\npromotees that since in the first Gupta's case the Court had\ndirected that they should be absorbed on a \"priority basis\".\nall of them should have been shown in the seniority list as\nhaving been pointed on January 16, 1959 en bloc and the\ndirect recruits for that year should have been shown\nthereafter. It was explained that by use of the expression\n\"priority basis\" what was meant by the Court was that the\nposition or the spill-over promotees as seniors should not\nbe prejudiced by claims made by later promotees on the\nground that since the spill-over promotees were recruited in\nexcess of the quota, the later promotees whose promotion did\nnot violate the quota rule had higher rights than those 73.\nThe Court further held that, v he the 73 spill-over\nappointments were made, there were no allocated or earmarked\nposts to which those promotees could have been validly\nappointed. the ordinary consequence of which would have been\ntheir revision to Class II posts which they originally held.\nSo long as the quota rule was in existence appointments in\nexcess of the quota, though invalid when made, were atleast\nliable to be regularised in subsequent years when vacancies\nwere available. to the promotees as a consequence of the\nquota rule But. Once the quota rule ceased to exist on\nJanuary 16, 1959, any possibility of the excess appointments\nof the promotees being regularised vanished. It was in order\n815\nto overcome this injustice to the promotees, that the new\nrule was framed by the Government. The new rule was thus not\nonly the direct outcome of the judgment or the Court in the\nIst Gupta case, but it was followed on the very principles\non which the Income-tax Service had been constituted. The\nCourt finally said that it had also to be remembered that\npromoteeS appointed from January 16, 1959 onwards were\nappointed on an officiating or ad hoc basis with notice that\nthe question of their seniority was still undecided. This\ncircumstance coupled with the absence of clear allocation of\nposts, made it impossible for the promotees to lay claim to\nseniority and contend that they were deprived of their\nnatural seniority in violation of \nArticle 16.\n\n The petitioners who were promotee Income-Tax officers\nClass-I, Grade-II prayed for reconsideration of these three\ndecisions S. G. Jai Singhani v. Union of India and Anr.\n[1967] 2 S.C.R. 703; Bishan Swarup Gupta v. Union of India\nand Ors.(First Gupta's case),[1975] Suppl. S.C.R. 495;\nBishan Swarup Gupta etc. v. Union of India and ors. (Second\nGuptas case) [1975] S.C.R. 104 and to the extent S. G. Jai\nSinghani's case is relied upon in Union of India v. Malji\nJangamayya etc.,[1977] 2 S.C.R. 28. On the following\ngrounds:\n 1. The Conclusion that Rule 4 of the Income-Tax\nofficers (Class-l. Grade-II) Service Recruitment Rules is\nstatutory and, therefore, the quota prescribed by the\nGovernment of India for recruitment to Income-Tax officers\nClass-I, Grade-II in exercise of the power conferred by Rule\n4 would be statutory, proceeds on an assumption not\nwarranted by the provisions of law bearing on the point and\nif both Rule 4 and the quota presumably prescribed in\nexercise of the power conferred by Rule 4 are not shown to\nbe statutory; the foundation of which the edifice in S. G.\nJai Singhani's case rests is knocked down because it can be\ndemonstrably established that neither rule 4 nor the quota,\nprescribed thereunder was statuary in character but was at\nbest an administrative instruction.\n 2. After the Court on an interpretation of the quota\nrule held that the quota was related to vacancies arising in\nthe grade every year, the conclusion reached did not conform\nto this finding but accommodated the so-called inability\n(now shown to be factually incorrect) of the Government of\nIndia to give information to the Court about the vacancies\nin the grade every year with the result that the whole\ncalculation of spill-over is vitiated.\n 3. The mandamus issued in Jai Singhani's case was\nmisinterpreted by the Government because even if the quota\nwas statutory it was operative only between 1951 and 1956\nbut the Government interpreted the mandamus to be operative\nbeyond 1956 and upto 1967 which misinterpretation has been\npointed out in the first Gupta's case.\n 4. In the first Gupta's case while holding that the\nmandamus directing, to treat the quota statutory beyond.\n1956 was not justified yet till January 16. 1959, the Court\nitself indirectly accepted the quota rule as a guideline and\ntreated that there was a spill-over of 73 promotees. If Rule\n4 was not statutory and consequently the quota prescribed in\nexercise of the power which had outlived its prescribed span\nof life in 1956 could not be brought in to treat any\nappointment as invalid on the ground that there was no\nallocated post for those appointees treated as spill-over\nbecause under Rule 4 itself the Government had power to\ndetermine the method or methods to be employed for the\npurpose of\n816\nfilling in particular vacancies or such vacancies as may be\nrequired to be filled in during any particular period and\nthe number of candidates to he recruited by each method.\n 5. The action of the Government of upgrading 214 posts\nbetween 1959 and 1962 from Class-II, Grade-II to Class I,\nGrade II was not open to question as at that stage there was\nno quota rule and Rule 4 enabled the Government to make\nrecruitment from either of the two sources in exercise of\nits executive power. In regard to the second Gupta's case\nthe Court introduced quota rule retrospectively by the back\ndoor which is impermissible and its operation manifestly\nestablishes its utter unfairness inasmuch as a direct\nrecruit nor any where in the department or may be a student\nmay secure a march-over a promotee which has been working in\nClass-I, Grade-II.\n Dismissing the petitions the Court,\n^\n HELD: Per Chandrachud, C.J. (On behalf of N. L .\nUntawalia, P. S Kailasam, E. S. Venkataramaiah, JJ. and\nhimself). (Majority view)\n i. A consideration of certain historic facts in this\ncase makes it clear that there is no substance in the\nrequest made for a review of the decisions in Jai Singhani\nv. Union of India and Ors., [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703; Bishan\nSwarup Gupta v. Union of India and ors. (Ist Gupta's case)\n[1975] supplementary S.C.R. 491; Bishan Swarup Gupta v.\nUnion of India & Ors.; Second Gupta's case [1975] 1 S.C.R.\n104 and Union of India v. Malji Jangamayya[1977] 2 S.C.R.\n28. [840 E-F]\n For nearly a. decade after 1950, appointments of\npromotees were made far in excess of the quota available to\nthem. So long as the quota rule operated. it was possible to\nregularise their appointments when posts within their quota\nbecame available in later years. But a somewhat\nunprecedented situation arose by the upgrading of Class II\nposts to Class I grade II-100 of them on January 16, 1959\nand 114 on December 9, 1960. This massive upgrading of posts\nbrought about a collapse of the quota rule. Subsequent\nabsorption in posts which became available for being filled\nup later really means regularisation of appointments, which\nis possible provided there is no excessive deviation from\nthe quota rule. [840 G-H, 841 A]\n It is true that no blame can be laid at the doors of\nthe promotees on the score that they were appointed in\nexcess of tho quota available to them. Perhaps, their\nappointments must even have enabled the administration to\ntide over administrative stale-mate. But the tough problem\nwhich the administration has to face is that whereas it is\nnecessary to recognise and protect the claims of promotees\nwho were appointed in excess of their quota, is equally\nnecessary to ensure that the direct recruits do not suffer\nan nude set-back in service on account of the appointments\nof promotees. The conflicting claims of the two components\nof Service, both having an importance of their own, have\ntherefore to be reconciled. It was with that object that the\nrules have been modified from time to time. The judgments\nrendered by this Court in the aforesaid four cases show,\nwithout a shadow doubt, how every effort was made to ensure\nthat no hardship or injustice is caused to the promotees\nmerely because their appointments exceeded their quota. [841\nA-C]\n 2. It is not correct to say that the judgment in Jai\nSinghani was based on a concession or that the Court felt\ncompelled to draw the particular conclusions\n817\ntherein because of the inability or refusal of the Finance\nMinistry to produce A the relevant files. The Court adopted\nwhat it considered in the circumstances to be a satisfactory\nand scientific method of ascertaining the number of\nvacancies available for being file up. It came to the\nconclusion that the number of actual appointments should\ndetermine the number of vacancies available which was a\nperfectly legitimate conclusion to draw. In the grey area\nwhere service rules operate, more than one view is always\npossible to take without sacrificing either reason or\ncommonsense but the ultimate choice has to be necessarily\nconditioned by several considerations ensuring justice to as\nmany as possible and injustice to as few. There was no error\nin the conclusion in Jai Singhanni that Rule 4 of the\nRecruitment Rules was a statutory rule Subsequent decisions\nwould show that there was hardly any dispute between the\nparties, at later stages at any rate, that Rule 4 was a\nstatutory rule. [841 D-G]\n 3. No doubt, the promotees should not be penalised for\nthe mere reason that those of them who were appointed after\nJanuary 16, 1959 were appointed on an officiating or ad hoc\nbasis and had clear notice that the question of their\nseniority was still undecided. The circumstances attendant\nupon their appointments cannot, however, be wholly\noverlooked in determining whether the constitutional\nconstraints have been over-stepped. [841 H, 842 A]\n 4. It is not safe to test the constitutionality of a\nservice rule on the touch stone of fortunes of individuals.\nNo matter with what care, objectivity and foresight a rule\nis framed, some hardship, inconvenience or injustice is\nbound to result to some members of the service. The\nparamount consideration is the reconciliation of conflicting\nclaims of two important constituents of Service, one of\nwhich brings fresh blood and the other mature experience.\n[842 A-C]\n 5. Though the promotees submitted in the Second Gupta\ncase that the new seniority rule was unfair to them, they\nwere unable to put forward any rational alternative. On the\ncontrary the counter-affidavit dated August 31, 1973 file in\nthe Second Gupta case by Shri Mehra., the Deputy Secretary\nFinance, shows the fullness with which the Government had\nconsulted all possible interests while framing the impugned\nrules of seniority. The gamut of reasonable possibilities is\nfairly covered by the four alternatives referred to in Shri\nMehra's affidavit. The inconveniences and disadvantages\nflowing from the first three alternatives would be far\ngreater than those flowing from the fourth. That is why the\nchoice ultimately fell on the fourth alternative under which\nthe seniority between promotees and direct recruits was\nfiled alternately on a roster system, vacancies being\nequally divided between promotees and direct recruits, for\nthe entire period from 1959 up-to-date. The observation of\nthe Court in the Second Gupta's case at page 119 shows how\ndifficult it is to solve the jig-saw puzzle of service\ndisputes. [842 C-Hl G\n 6. The report of the 'Committee on petitions' of the\nRajya Sabha, howsoever, sincerely motivated and fully drawn\ncannot be given the importance which the promotees seem to\nattach to it. In paragraph 16 of its Report the Committee\ndoes refer to certain files but those files appear to\ncontain some notions in regard to the direct recruitment\nonly. The Committee has given a table of comparative\nappointments in paragraph 19 of its Report but it had to\nspeculate on an important aspect of the matter, as is shown\nby its own language, that the table shows the member of\ndirect recruits which the Government wanted to take and \"on\nthe basis of which the promotees must have been given promo-\n818\ntions\". If indeed the relevant files were produced before\nthe Committee, it would not have expressed its sense of deep\nshock and resentment at the disappearance of the files.\nFurther para 32 of the Report shows that the Committee had\nto grope in the dark and indulge in a certain amount of\nspeculation on matters under its consideration. In the\ncircumstances it has done as good a job as a Committee can\nand no fault need to found with it. But nevertheless the\nsaid Committee's report cannot displace the Courts\njudgments. [842 H, &43 A-C]\n Even on merits there is no justification for\nconsidering the judgments already rendered by this Court\ninasmuch as no fresh facts were brought to notice by way of\ndiscovery of new and important evidence which would justify\nreconsideration of the decisions already rendered by this\nCourt after the most careful examination of the competing\ncontentions. The report of the Rajya Sabha Committee on\npetitions shows that the relevant files are still not\ntraceable. [843 E-F, G-H, 844 A]\n Per Desai, J. (contra )\n 1. While, no doubt, the Supreme Court has\nconstitutional rower lo review its decision, it is a power\nto be sparingly exercised because any such review has the\ntendency to unsettle questions which may have been finally\ndetermined. The Supreme Court does not lightly undertake\nreview of its decisions more especially where conflicting\nclaims have been settled by the decision of this Court and\nthe whole gamut may have to be gone through over again on a\nreconsideration of the decision. While exercising inherent\npower to reconsideration and review its earlier decision,\nthe Supreme Court would naturally like to, impose certain\nreasonable limitations and would be reluctant to entertain\nplea for reconsideration and review all its earlier\ndecisions unless it is satisfied that there are compelling\nand substantial reasons to do so. It is general judicial\nexperience that in manners of law involving questions of\nconstruing statutory or constitutional provisions, two views\nare often reasonably possible and when judicial approach has\nto make a choice between the two reasonable possible views,\nthe process of decision making is often very difficult and\ndelicate. [846 A-B, 847 C, G-H. 848 A-B]\n In deciding whether a review is necessary when two\nviews are possible it would not necessarily be an adequate\nreason for such review and revision to hold that though the\nearlier view is reasonably possible view the alternative\nview which is pressed on the subsequent occasion is more\nreasonable. The Court's discretion should be guided by such\nconsideration whether in the interest of public good or for\nany other valid or compulsive reason it is necessary that\nthe: earlier decision should be revised.

The scheme was set out in the Government of\nIndia Finance Department (Central Revenues) letter dated\nSeptember 29, 1944. The quota prescribed therein has\nundergone a revision at a later date. The rules being Pre-\nconstitution Rules, their source must be traced to the\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n. \nSection 241\n of the 1935 Act\nmade provision for recruitment and conditions of service.\n\nSection 241\n makes it clear that the power to make\nappointments in the case of service of Federation and posts\nin connection with the affairs of the Federation was\nconferred on the Governor-General or such person as he may\ndirect. The power to make rules in this behalf was conferred\nby sub-section '' on the Governor-General or by some person\nor persons authorised by the Governor-General to make the\nrules fol the purpose. But, the rules were not made either\nby the Governor-General or such person authorised by him.\n'The rules were made by the Finance Department and no\nmaterial was placed to show that the persons or the persons\nwho made the rules were authorised by the Governor-General,\nunder \nSection 241(2)\n of the 1935 Act in this behalf. The\nassumption made therefore, that Rule 4 of the Rules are\nstatutory and that the quota prescribed in exercise of the\npower conferred by Rule 4 must be statutory is ill-founded\nThis knocks out the entire foundation of the judgment of\nthis Court in Jai Singhani's case because this Court\nproceeded to hold that as the quota was statutory, any\nrecruitment made in excess of the quota in any given year\nwould be invalid and at best can be regularised by\nrelegating such excess appointment to the quota next year.\nIf Rule 4 and the quota referable to the power conferred by\nRule 4 were not statutory but were merely execute\ninstructions, its violation would not render any appointment\nin excess of it invalid but at best would be irregular and\nin this case on a plain reading of Rule 4 it would not even\nbe irregular. [848 G-H, 849 A-E]\n 3. In P. C. Sethi & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. this\nCourt held that in the absence of any statutory rules it was\nopen to the, Government in exercise of its executive power\nto issue administrative instructions with regard to\nconstitution and recognition of service as long as there is\nno violation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the constitution. If\nthe present Rule 4 enables the Government to prescribe\nmethod to be employed for the purpose of filling, in any\nparticular vacancy or such vacancies as may be required to\nbe filled in during any particular period and the number of\ncandidates to be recruited by each method arid if the so\ncalled quota is not statutory but merely a guideline, the\nGovernment whenever making appointments would be acting in\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 which leaves it to the\ndiscretion, of the Government to decide from what Source\nrecruitment should be made and what must be the quantum of\nvacancies that must be filled in at a given point of time\nand such appointment could not be said to be invalid. [849\nE-H]\n Alternatively. even if the assumption made in Jai\nSinghani's case that Rule 4 and the quota referable to the\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 is unquestionable yet\nwhen this Could held that the quota is related to the\nvacancies, the decision proceeding on an incorrect plea that\nthe information about the number of vacancies in a year is\nnot available, is unsustainable for two reasons, namely,(1)\nthat the files are now produced; (2) in the absence of\ninformation about the vacancies available the Court could\nnot have invalidated any appointment on the assumption that\nappointment from the source of promotees was in excess of\nthe quota. [850 A-B]\n820\n on a plain levelling of Rules 3,, 4 and 5, it is clear\nthat the, quota was related to vacancies and at one stage\nthat was accepted. On this finding unless the fact situation\nis clearly established showing vacancies year to year it\nwould be impossible to hold that in any year there was\nexcess in either source. Suppose there were 90 vacancies in\na year and the quota was 66-2/3 for direct recruits all 33\n1/3 for promotees it would be open to the Government to\npromote 30 persons irrespective of the fact whether 60\ndirect recruits have become available or not. The assumption\nmade that the recruitment made in a given year from both the\nsources would furnish information about the vacancies in a\nyear would lead to a rather unfair conclusion inasmuch as\nthe action of the Government in acting in a certain manner\nwithout due regard to the quota rule would work hardship on\nappointees even though on a correct calculation of vacancies\nthe appointments may be valid and legal. [850 C-E]\n 4 The Government understood the mandamus issued in Jai\nSinghani's case as covering, the whole period from 1951 to\n1967. When this was questioned in the First Gupta's case\nthis Court held that the quota rule proprio vigme operated\nbetween 1951 to 1956 and if there were promotions in any\nyear in excess of the quota. those promotions were merely\ninvalid for that year but they were not invalid for all time\nand they could be regularised by being absorbed in the quota\nfor the later years. So adjusting the quota at any rate np\nto 1956, the quota rule on its own strength evaporated\nbecause it was to be in operation for a period of five years\nand no fresh quota rule was issued by the Government.\nTherefore, after 1956 Rule 4 remained in force in' all its r\nignore and was not hedged in by any quota. Rule 4 permitted\nthe Government to make recruitment from either source\nwithout fettering its discretion by any quota rule which it\nwas not bound to prescribe. On January 16, 1959 Government\nhl the Ministry of Finance informed the Commissioner of\nIncome tax that the resident had sanctioned the upgrading to\nClass I of one hundred temporary posts of Income-Tax\nofficers Class II. On December 19, 1960 there was further\nupgrading of 114 posts from Class II to Class I. Between\n1959 and 1962 these 214 posts were filled in by promotees.\nNow in the First Gupta's case, this Court held even though\nthe quota expired in 1956 yet the Government of India\nadopted it as a guideline. May be it may be so. But, it\ncannot be said that. any appointment in breach of the\nguideline neither statutory nor even having the fragrance of\nany executive instruction becomes invalid more so, when the\nGovernment had power to make appointment from either source\nuninhibited by any quota rule under Rule 4. Yet the Court\nfound that between 1956 and 1959 when one hundred posts came\nto be upgraded there was a spill-over of 73 persons and\nbecause of the huge departure from guidelines the weightage\nrule giving seniority to the promotees by 2 to 3 years was\ncrushed under its own debris. Again, Rule 4 is overlooked or\nby-passed when saying that. there was a spill-over of 73\npromotees between 1956 and 1959, nor could it be said that\nthe upgrading of 214 posts and filling them up by promotees\nwould be in any way even irregular much less invalid because\nRule t enables the Government to draw from either source.\n[851 A-G]\n 5. In the Second Gupta's case in view of the decision\nin the First Gupta's case, a fresh seniority rule was\nprepared and it was made retroactive from January 16, 1959.\nlt, inter alia, provides that the relative seniority amongst\nthe promotees and the direct recruits shall be in the ratio\nof 1: 1 and the same shall be so determined and regulated in\naccordance with a roster main-\n821\ntained for this purpose which shall follow the following\nsequence, namely, promotee; direct recruit, promotee; direct\nrecruit etc. This method of roster undoubtedly introduces a\nquota by the back door. Once a roster is introduced promotee\ndirect recruit, promotee direct recruit etc. even if some\npromotees have come in a bulk and if at a later date some\ndirect recruits are appointed in bulk while preparing roster\nan earlier date-promotee will have to yield his place to a\nlater date direct recruit. Bluntly translated it means that\nthe direct recruit who was never in service when promotee\nwas promoted probably he may be a student, he may not have\neven passed the competitive examination, yet he may come\ninto the picture challenge one who has already been serving\nin the department for a number of years. To illustrate in\nthe new seniority list prepared by the Government pursuant\nto the order made by this Court in the First Gupta's case\nand upheld by this Court in the Second Gupta's case a\npromotee of 1962 will have to yield his place to a direct\nrecruit of 1966. [851 G-H, 852 A-D] C\n 6. Service jurisprudence hardly permits a situation\nwhere a man not in service comes and challenges something\nwhich has been done much before he came into service and\ngets such an advantage which on the face of it appear to be\nunfair. But apart from this, even in 1959 there was no quota\nrule and assuming that the old service rule giving weightage\nto the promotees crushed under weight of large number of\npromotees being promoted it would not be open to the\nGovernment to so prepare a fresh seniority list which cannot\nbe given effect to unless a roster is introduced which\nintroduces quota by the back door and which is so unfair in\nits operation that promotees of 1962 will have to yield\nplace to direct recruits of 1966. Under the old weightage\nrule promotees were given weightage for service of 2 to 3\nyears over direct recruits because direct recruits were\nunable to undertake regular assessment work for a period of\n2 to 3 years when they were more or less under training\nwhile promotees have been doing this work for a number of\nyears and whose experience is reflected in the weightage.\nThe whole thing now appears to be in the reverse gear in\nthat an uninitiated direct recruit takes precedence over an\nexperienced promotee. The unfairness of the new rule is writ\nlarge on the face of the record. [852 E-H]\n 7. The fresh seniority rule violates another important\nrule well-recognised principle in the service jurisprudence\nthat in the absence of any valid rule of seniority date of\ncontinuous officiation provides a valid rule of seniority.\nThis rule is completely crucified upon two unsustainable\nassumptions that a quota rule having guideline sanction is\nmade imperative in character and assumed to be in force\nbetween 1956 and 1959, and that even though Government in\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 for its own necessity\npromoted 214 promotees to the upgraded post, yet they must\nyield to some future direct recruits who may come to the\ndepartment at a later date. This Court sustained the\ndecision holding that these were ad hoc appointments and\nthere are no regular posts for these promotees. This\napproach wholly overlooks the fact and the force of Rule 4.\n[853 A-C]\n 8. Certainty and continuity demand that this Court\nshould not reopen settled decisions or reopen closed\nquestions unless under compelling necessity. It may he that\nthe fact of Income-Tax officers promotees and direct\nrecruits may rest with the three decisions of this Court.\nUnfairness to some of them H may itself not provide a good\nand compelling reason for reopening and reconsidering the\ndecisions. [853 C-D]\n822\n Jai Singhani and the Two Gupta cases are being quoted,\ntimes without number before this Court for the principles\nenunciated therein. These decisions, therefore, affected\nsubsequent decisions of this Court as well as the High\ncourts and\n some of the principles\nenunciated in these three cases stand in sharp contrast to\nother decisions of this Court and in fact this Court itself\nfelt it necessary to warn that it may become necessary to\nreconcile these conflicting decisions. The three decisions\nare incorrect in the light of the materials now placed,\nespecially the files which were withheld from the Court and\nthe Committee. A strong case has been made out for\nreconsideration of these decisions [853 E-F, 854 C-D]\n N. D. Chauhan & Ors. v.

Venkataramiah, JJ. was\ndelivered by Chandrachud, C.J. D. A. Desai, J. gave a\ndissenting opinion.\n\n CHANDRACHUD, C. J.-The disputes between promotees and\ndirect recruits in various departments of the Government\nseem to have no end. No sooner does one round of litigation\ncome to a decision than is another round started by one\nparty or the other, sometimes alleging, as in these Writ-\nPetitions, that important facts and circumstances were not\ntaken into consideration in the earlier proceedings either\nbecause they were suppressed or because, though cited, they\nwere overlooked or misunderstood. A virtual review is thus\nasked for, opening flood\n\n823\n\ngates to fresh litigation. There are few other litigative\nareas than disputes between members of various services\ninter se, where the principle that public policy requires\nthat all litigation must have an end can apply with greater\nforce. Public servants ought not to be driven or required to\ndissipate their time and energy in court-room battles.\nThereby their attention is diverted from public to private\naffairs and their inter se disputes affect their sense of\noneness without which no n institution can function\neffectively. The constitution of Service Tribunals by State\nGovernments with an apex Tribunal at the Centre, which, in\nthe generality of cases, should be the final arbiter of\ncontroversies relating to conditions of service, including\nthe vexed question of seniority, may save the courts from\nthe avalanche of writ petitions and appeals in service\nmatter-. The proceedings of such Tribunals can have the\nmerit of informality and if they will not be tied down to\nstrict rules of evidence, they might be able to produce\nsolutions which will satisfy many and displease only a few.\nThere are always a few whom nothing can please.\n\n The three petitioners in Writ Petition No. 66 of 1974\nare all promotees. Petitioner No. 1, Kamal Kanti Dutta, was\nappointed as an Inspector of Income-tax on December, 7, 1950\nand after passing the departmental examination he was\npromoted an Income-tax officer, Class II on June 21, 1954.\nOn January 1, 1966 he was promoted as Income-tax officer,\nClass I, which post he was holding on the date of the\npetition, February 8, 1974. Petitioners 2 and 3, Bikash\nMohan Das Gupta and Sushil Ranjan Das, were promoted as\nInspectors of Income-tax in April, 1955. The former was\npromoted as I.T.O., Class II in December, 1957 and as\nI.T.o., Class I, in May, 1971 while the latter was promoted\nas I.T.o., Class II, in August, 1973.\n\n Respondents 1 to 5 to the petition are the Union of\nIndia, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, the Central\nBoard of Direct Taxes, Secretary to the Ministry of Home\nAffairs and the Union Public Service Commission\nrespectively. Respondents 6 to 357 who were recruited\ndirectly as I.T.Os., Class I, were appointed on probation as\nClass I officers after Petitioner No. 1 was promoted to that\ncadre on January, 1, 1966. Respondents 280 to 357 were\nappointed on probation as I.T.os., Class I, after Petitioner\nNo. 2 was promoted to that cadre in May 1971.\n\n Respondent No. 358, S. G. Jaisinghani, who was\nrecruited directly as I.T.O., Class I, in 1951 was holding\nthe rank of Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax on the date\nof the petition. He was posted at the relevant time as the\nDeputy Director of Investigation, New Delhi. Respondent 359,\nMohan Chandra Joshi, who was recruited directly as I.T.O.,\nClass L in 1953 was also holding a similar rank and was\n\n824\n\nworking as Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Government\nof India.\n\n In Writ Petition No. 4146 of 1978 the Petitioner,\nHundraj Kanyalal Sajnani, was appointed directly on the\nrecommendation of the Union Public Service Commission as\nI.T.o., Class II (Trainee) on July 1, 1947. After\nsuccessfully completing the period of probation, he passed\nthe departmental examination for I.T.Os. in July 1950. In\n1959-60 he was promoted as I.T.O., Class I, and was\nconfirmed in that cadre with effect from December 9, 1960.\nHe was promoted as an Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax\nwith effect from December 17, 1969.\n\n Respondents 1 to 3 to that petition are the Union of\nIndia, the Chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes and\nthe Union Public Service Commission respectively.\nRespondents 4 to 8 are B. D. Roy, S. G. Jaisinghani, M. C.\nJoshi, B. S. Gupta and M. Jangamayya respectively. These\nofficers have figured in certain well-known decisions of\nthis Court, as a result of which their names have become\nhouse hold words in service jurisprudence. In fact, Shri B.\nS. Gupta figures in two cause-titles known as 'the first\nGupta case' and the 'Second Gupta case'. Respondents 4, 7\nand 8 are Assistant Commissioners of Income-tax while\nrespondents 5 and 6 are workings Deputy Directors of\nInvestigation.\n\n It will be difficult to appreciate the nature of the\nrelief sought in these Writ Petitions without a proper\nunderstanding of the history of the litigation leading to\nthese petitions. That history is quite checkered. one of the\nprincipal grievances of the petitioners is that some of the\nprevious decisions rendered by this Court are erroneous and\nthat some have not been properly understood and interpreted\nwhile framing rules of seniority. That makes it necessary to\nrefer to the previous proceedings leading to the present\ncontroversy.\n\n With a view to improving the income-tax administration,\nthe Government of India, in consultation with the Federal\nPublic Service Commission, decided to reconstitute and\nclassify the then existing Income-tax Services, Classes I\nand II. The scheme of reorganisation of the Services was set\nout in a letter dated September 29, 1944 of the Government\nof India, Finance Department (Central Revenues), which was\nsent to all the Commissioners of Income-tax. The Central\nService, Class I was to consist of (1) Commissioners of\nIncome-tax, (2) Assistant Commissioners of Income-tax, (3)\nIncome-tax officers, Grade I and (4) Income-tax officers,\nGrade II. The Central Service, Class II comprised Income-tax\nofficers, Grade III. Thus Income-tax officers, Class I were\nto be of two grades, Grades I and II, while Income-tax\n\n825\n\nOfficers, Class II, were to consist of one grade, namely,\nGrade Ill. A Clauses (a) to (e) of paragraph 2 of the\naforesaid letter prescribed modes of recruitment to the\nvarious posts in Class I and Class II. Clause (d) which\nprescribed the mode of recruitment to the post of Income-tax\nofficer, Class I, Grade II, said:\n\n Recruitment to Grade-II will be made partly by\n promotion and partly by direct recruitment. 80 per cent\n of the vacancies arising in this Grade will be filled\n by direct recruitment via the Indian Audit & Accounts\n and Allied Service Examination. The remaining 20 per\n cent of vacancies will be filled by pro motion on the\n basis of selection from Grade III (Class II Ser vice),\n provided that suitable men upto the number required are\n available for appointment. Any surplus vacancies which\n cannot be filled by promotion for want of suitable\n candidates will be added to the quota of vacancies to\n be filled by direct recruitment via the Indian Audit\n and Accounts etc. Services examination.\n Rules regulating recruitment to the Income-tax officers\n(Class I, Grade II) Service, \"liable to alteration from year\nto year\", were published on May 26, 1945 by a resolution of\nthe Finance Department (Central Revenues). Rule 3 provided\nthat recruitment to Class I, Grade II Service shall be made\n\n(i) by competitive examination held in India in accordance\nwith Part II of the Rules and (ii) by promotion on the basis\nof selection from Grade III (Class II Service) in accordance\nwith Part III of the Rules. By rule 4, the Government was to\ndetermine, subject to the provisions of rule 3, the method\nor methods to be employed for the purpose of filling any\nparticular vacancies, or such vacancies as may require to be\nfilled during any particular period, and the number of\ncandidates to be recruited by each method. Part III of the\nRules called 'Recruitment by Promotion' provided by\nparagraph 21 that recruitment by promotion shall be made by\nselection from among Grade I II Income-tax officers (Class\nII Service) after consultation with the Federal Public\nService Commission and that no officer shall have any claim\nto such promotion as of right.\n\n By a letter dated January 24, 1950 the Government of\nIndia laid down certain rules of seniority (a) as between\ndirect recruits, (b) as between promotees selected from\nClass II, and (c) as between direct recruits who completed\ntheir probation in a given year and the promotees appointed\nin the same year to Class I.\n On October 18, 1951, the Government of India addressed\na letter to all the Commissioners of Income-tax on the\nsubject Income-tax officers, 14-463 SCI/80\n\n826\n\nGrade II (Class I Service) quota of vacancies filled by\npromotion . The letter says:\n\n The Government of India have had under\n consideration the question of increasing the proportion\n of vacancies reserved for promotion from Class II\n Income-tax officers in Class I. It has been decided in\n consultation with the Union Public Service Commission\n and in modification of para 2(d) of the Finance Dept.\n (Central Revenues) letter No. 195-Admn. (IT/39 dated\n the 29th September, 1944 that for a period of five\n years in the first instance 66/2-3 % of the vacancies\n in Class I, Grade II, will be filled by direct\n recruitment via combined competitive examination and\n the remaining 33% by promotion on the basis of\n selection from Grade III (Class II Service). Any\n surplus vacancies which cannot be filled by promotion\n for want of suitable candidates will be added to the\n quota of vacancies to be tilled by direct recruitment.\n By a letter dated September S, 1952, the Government of\nIndia revised with retrospective effect the rules of\nseniority which were laid down on January 24, 1950.\n\n Rule l(f)(iii) as framed on January 24, 1950 read thus:\n\n The promotees who have been certified by the\n Commission in any calendar year shall be senior to all\n direct recruits who complete their probation during\n that year or after and are confirmed with effect from a\n date in that year or after.\n\nThe rule as revised on September 5, 1952 read thus:\n Officers promoted in accordance with the\n recommendation of the Departmental Promotion Committee\n before the next meeting of the Departmental Promotion\n Committee shall be senior to all direct recruits\n appointed on the results of the examinations held by\n the Union Public Service Commission during the calendar\n year in which the Departmental Promotion. Committee met\n and the three previous years.\n\n Rule l(f)(iv) of the 1952 Rules dealt with a special\nsituation in which an officer initially appointed to Class\nII service is given seniority in the same manner as a\ndepartmental promotee, if subsequent to his passing the\ndepartmental examination he is appointed in Class I on the\nresults of the competitive examination.\n\n Rule 4 of Chapter IX of the \"Rules of Promotion of the\nCentral Board of Revenue office Procedure Manual states,\nthat the prescribed\n\n827\n\nminimum service for an officer of Class I, Grade II for\npromotion to A Grade I is 5 years gazetted service including\n1 year in Class l, Grade II. For a promotee from Class II,\nthe minimum period of service for promotion to Class I,\nGrade I, would be actually 4 years service in Class II and 1\nyear service in Class I, Grade II.\n\n In 1962, S. G. Jaisinghani (who is respondent No. 358\nin Writ Petition No. 66 of 1974 and respondent No. S in Writ\nPetition No. 4146 of 1978) filed Civil Writ No. 189-D of\n1962 in the High Court of Punjab under \nArticle 226\n of the\nConstitution, challenging the validity of the seniority\nrules in regard to Income-tax Service, Class I, Grade II as\nalso the actual implementation of the 'quota' rule, as\ninfringing \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the Constitution.\nPromotees who were likely to be affected by the decision of\nthe Writ Petition were added as respondents 4 to 126 to that\nPetition. Jaisinghani who was recruited directly as an\nIncome-tax officer, Class I (Grade II), raised four\nprincipal contentions:\n\n (i) Rule l(f)(iii) of the seniority rules as framed in\n 1952 was based upon an unjustifiable\n classification between direct recruits and\n promotees after they had entered Class I, Grade II\n Service. On the basis of that classification,\n promotees were given seniority over direct\n recruits of the same year and with weightage of\n three previous years. All officers appointed to\n Class I, Grade II Service formed one class and\n after being recruited to that class, no\n distinction could be made between direct recruits\n and promotees.\n\n (ii) Rule 1(f)(iv) was discriminatory because though\n the petitioner, Jaisinghani, qualified in the same\n competitive examination of 1950 for appointment to\n Class I, Grade II Service as respondents 4, 5 and\n 6 to that petition, they were treated as senior to\n him by the operation of the artificial rule by\n which they were regarded as \"deemed promotees\",\n since they were appointed to Class II, Grade III\n Service in 1947. All the four of them were\n appointed to Class I, Grade II Service in 1951 and\n therefore the period of service put in by\n respondents 4, 5 and 6 in Class II, Grade III\n Service cannot be counted for fixing their\n seniority vis-a-vis the petitioner.\n\n (iii) Rule 4 of Chapter IX of the 'Central Board of\n Revenue office Procedure Manual' leads to\n discrimination as between direct recruits and\n promotees; and that\n\n828\n\n (iv) during the years 1951 to 1956, there was excessive\n recruitment of 71 promotees, in violation of the\n quota rule of 2: 1 contained in Government of\n India's letter dated October 18, 1951. The quota\n fixed by that letter must be deemed to have been\n fixed in exercise of the statutory power given by\n rule 4 of the Income-tax officers (Class I, Grade\n II) Service Recruitment Rules published on May 26,\n 1945.\n\n A full Bench of the Punjab High Court, Circuit Bench,\nDelhi, rejected the writ petition, holding that the\nprinciples for determining seniority between direct recruits\nand promotees laid down in rules 1(f) (iii) and (iv), 1952\nwere not discriminatory, that the quota rule announced by\nthe Government of India were merely a policy statement and\nhad no statutory force, that departure from the quota rule\ndid not give rise to any justiciable issue and that the\npromotion rule governing promotions from Class I, Grade II\nto Class I, Grade I was not discriminatory and ultra vires\nof \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n In appeal, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that\nrules l(f)(iii) and (iv) of the seniority rules framed in\n1952 did not violate \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n since they were\nbased on a reasonable classification and that rule 4 of\nChapter IX of the 'Central Board of Revenue office Procedure\nManual' cannot be held to lead to any discrimination as\nbetween direct recruits and promotees, since the object of\nthe rule was really to carry out the policy of rule\nl(f)(iii) of the Rules of Seniority and not allow it to be\ndefeated by the requirement of five years service in Class\nI, Grade II itself, before a person could be considered for\npromotion to Class I, Grade I. On the question of excessive\nrecruitment of promotees from 1951 to 1956 in violation of\nquota rule, the Court had directed the Secretary of the\nFinance Ministry, during the hearing of the appeal, to\nfurnish information regarding the number of vacancies which\nhad arisen from year to year from 1945 onwards, the nature\nof the vacancies-permanent or temporary-the chain of\nvacancies and such other details which were relevant to the\nmatters pending before the Court. In his affidavit dated\nJanuary 31, 1967 Shri R. C. Dutt, Finance Secretary, said\nthat he was not able to work out, in spite of his best\nendeavours, the number of vacancies arising in a particular\nyear. However, a statement, Ex. E. was furnished to the\nCourt showing the number of officers recruited by the two\nmethods of recruitment to Class I Service during the\nrelevant years. The Court found that it was not clear from\nShri Dutt's affidavit whether the quota rule was followed\nstrictly for the years in question and noted that in the\nabsence of figures of permanent vacancies in Class 1, Grade\nII, for the relevant years, the Solicitor General was unable\nto say to what extent\n\n829\n\nthere had been deviation from that rule. Rejecting the\nsubmission of the Solicitor General that the quota rule was\nmerely an administrative direction, the Court held that rule\n4 of the Income-tax officers Class I, Grade II) Service\nRecruitment Rules was a statutory rule under which a\nstatutory duty was cast on the Government to determine the\nmethod or methods to be employed for the purpose of filling\nthe vacancies and the number of candidates to be recruited\nby each method; and that, though in the letter of the\nGovernment of India dated October 18, 1951 there was no\nspecific reference to rule 4, the quota fixed by that letter\nmust be deemed to have been fixed in exercise of the\nstatutory power given by rule 4. There was therefore no\ndiscretion left with the Government of India to alter that\nquota according to the exigencies of the situation or to\ndeviate from the quota, in any particular year, at its own\nwill and pleasure. The quota rule, according to the Court,\nwas linked up with the seniority rules and unless it was\nstrictly observed in practice it would be difficult to hold\nthat the seniority rule contained in rule l(f)(iii) was not\nunreasonable and did not offend \nArticle 16\n of the\nConstitution. The Court expressed its conclusion thus: D\n We are accordingly of the opinion that promotees\n from Class II, Grade III to Class I, Grade II Service\n in excess of the prescribed quotas for each of the\n years 1951 to 1956 and onwards have been illegally\n promoted and the appellant is entitled to a writ in the\n nature of mandamus commanding respondents ' I to 3 to\n adjust the seniority of the appellant and other\n officers similarly placed like him and to prepare a\n fresh seniority list in accordance with law after\n adjusting the recruitment for the period 1951 to 1956\n and onwards in accordance with the quota rule\n prescribed in the letter of the Government of India No.\n F. 24(2)-Admn. I.T./51 dated October 18, 1951. We,\n however, wish to make it clear that this order will not\n affect such Class II officers who have been appointed\n permanently as Assistant Commissioners of Income Tax.\n (emphasis supplied).\n\nThe Court suggested that for future years the roster system\nshould be adopted by framing an appropriate rule for working\nout the quota between the direct recruits and the promotees\nand that a roster should be maintained indicating the order\nin which appointments are made by direct recruitment and by\npromotion in accordance with the percentages fixed under the\nstatutory rule for each method of recruitment.\n\n In Writ Petition No. S of 1966 filed by Mohan Chandra\nJoshi under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution, a similar\nmandamus was issued by the Court. Mohan Chandra Joshi, like\nJaisinghani, was recruited directly\n\n830\n\nas Income-tax officer, Class I, Grade II, with the only\ndifference that he was appointed in 1953 while Jaisinghani\nwas appointed in 1951.\n\n Thus the direct recruits succeeded substantially in\ntheir contentions. the quota rule acquired statutory force,\nappointments of promotees in excess of the quota became bad\nand it became obligatory for the Government to prepare a\nfresh seniority list. Promotees found to have been appointed\nin excess of the quota admissible to promotees had naturally\nto go down lin the final gradation of seniority.\n\n The aforesaid decision was given by this Court on\nFebruary 2, 1967. But, in spite of the mandamus issued by\nit, Government did not prepare a fresh seniority list for\nover a year, which led to the filing of a contempt petition\nby Jaisinghani and Joshi. Those proceedings were dismissed\nby this Court on November 6, 1968. In the meanwhile on July\n15, 1968, the Government prepared a fresh seniority list and\nfiled it in this Court. That list failed to satisfy\npromotees as well as direct recruits.\n\n Two writ petitions were filed in the Delhi High Court\nto challenge the fresh seniority list: one by B. S. Gupta, a\npromotee of 1962 and the other by M. C. Joshi, a direct\nrecruit who had succeeded in the earlier round of litigation\nin this Court. These writ petitions were heard by two\nseparate Benches of the Delhi High Court. Writ Petition No.\n196 of 1970 filed by B. S. Gupta was dismissed whereas Writ\nPetition No. 550 of 1970 filed by M. C. Joshi was\nsubstantially allowed. Setting aside the seniority list, the\nHigh Court gave a direction that another seniority list be\nprepared in the light of its judgment.\n\n The decision of the Delhi High Court in the aforesaid\ntwo writ petitions was challenged in this Court in four\nappeals: one by B. S. Gupta against the dismissal of his\nwrit petition and the other three by (i) the Government,\n\n(ii) M. C. Joshi and (iii) S promotees. \nIn all these\nappeals, the only question or consideration was whether the\nseniority list prepared on July 15, 1968 was correct and in\naccordance with the mandamus issued by this Court in\n\nJaisinghani v. Union of India and Ors.\n(1).\n \nThese appeals\nwere heard together and were disposed of by a judgment dated\nAugust 16, 1972 which is reported in \nBishan Sarup Gupta v.\nUnion of India and Ors.\n(2).\n\n \nWhile preparing the seniority list the Government\nunderstood the mandamus issued in Jaisinghani(l) as covering\nthe entire period from 1951 to 1967. For doing that it could\nnot be blamed, since the mandamus issued in Jaisinghani(1)\ndirected the Government to adjust the\n\n831\n\nseniority of various officers for the period 1951 to 1956\n\"and onwards\", A though the argument regarding excessive\nrecruitment of the promotees was confined to the years 1951\nto 1956. Palekar, J. speaking for the Court in \nBishan Sarup\nGupta\n (Supra) observed in the first instance that this Court\ncould not possibly have in mind a seniority list which took\nin promotees after 1956 and that therefore under the\nmandamus issued by this Court, appointments of promotees in\nexcess of the quota could only be taken into consideration\nin relation to the period 1951 to 1956. The reason for the\nuse of the words \"and onwards\" was explained to be that\nGovernment should be able to push down excess promotions to\nlater years in order that such promotions could be absorbed\nin the lawful quota available for later years. C\n In Bishan Sarup Gupta-the Court was called upon to\nexamine the correctness of seven principles enumerated in\nthe Government letter dated July 15, 1968 governing\nseniority. The first principle was accepted as good. The\nsecond and the third principles were held to be partially\nincorrect in so far as they excluded reference to all the\npromotees of 1952. The Court held that the promotees of 1952\nshould be referred to in the seniority list whether they are\naffected or not, the object being the ascertainment of\nexcess promotions.\n\n The fourth principle set out in the letter of July 15,\n1968 which is important for our purpose reads thus: E\n In view of the difficulty in working out the\n vacancies arising in each year the total number of\n direct recruits and promotees in each year have been\n taken into account for the purpose of implementing the\n quota rule.\n\nThis Court held that the rule dated October 18, 1951 was not\nconcerned with the constitution of the cadre but \"was\nconcerned with how permanent vacancies were to be filled\"\n\nand therefore the promotees would be entitled to 1/3 of the\nvacancies in any particular year whether or not there was\ndirect recruitment by competitive examination in that year.\nThis ratio of 2: 1 between the direct recruits and the\npromotees could not be made to depend on whether any direct\nrecruits were appointed in any particular year. It therefore\nbecame essential to determine the actual vacancies in the\ncadre but even in B. S. Gupta the Government put forward the\nplea that it was impossible for them to give the exact\nfigure of vacancies in any particular year. Counsel 11 who\nappeared for the promotees \nin that case\n filed a chart marked\nAnnexure 1 which, according to him, showed the correct\nnumber of\n\n832\n\nvacancies in the particular years. The Court, however, found\nit impossible to determine the actual vacancies on the basis\nof the figures given in that chart. In the circumstances,\nthe Court considered it reasonable to accept the number of\nappointments made in the particular years as substantially\nrepresenting the actual vacancies available for being filled\nup. One of the reasons which the Court gave in support of\nthis conclusion was that when the quota rule referred to\nvacancies, it was implicit that the vacancies are those\nwhich the Government wanted to fill up, whatever may be the\nactual number of vacancies available for being filled up.\nThus, if in the year 1953, 53 posts were filled by direct\nrecruits and 38 by promotees, the total number of vacancies\nwhich were intended by the Government to be filled in would\nbe 91. Promotees would be entitled to hold 1/3 of these\nnamely, 30. 8 promotees therefore could be said to have been\nappointed in excess of the quota available for promotees.\nThis was in fact what the Government had done while\npreparing the fresh seniority list, though it had wrongly\ncalculated the vacancies with effect from the year 1953\ninstead of doing so w.e.f. the beginning of the year 1952.\nThere were no promotions in 1951 and therefore, the question\nof appointment of promotees in excess of their quota did not\narise for that year.\n\n The argument advanced on behalf of the direct recruits\nthat the quota rule should be co-related to vacancies in\npermanent posts only and not to those in temporary posts was\nrejected by the Court.\n\n The Court upheld the 5th principle under which Class II\nofficers promoted to Class I, Grade II, were allowed\nweightage under rule 1(f)(iii).\n\n The Court then considered the question whether the\nquota rule could be applied after the year 1956. It held\nthat even after 1956, the Government was entitled by reason\nof rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules of 1945 to follow the\nquota rule of 1951 as a rough guideline, \"without going to\nthe trouble of putting the same on record in so many words\".\n\nThe Court observed that if the rule is followed as a\nguideline, a slight deviation from the quota would be\npermissible but if there was an \"enormous deviation\", other\nconsiderations may arise. Taking into consideration the\nrelevant circumstances, the Court came to the conclusion\nthat in the normal course the Government was entitled to\nprepare the seniority list till the end of 1958 in\naccordance with the quota rule of 1951.\n\n In regard to the position after the year 1958, the\nCourt came to the conclusion that the quota rule ceased to\napply and came to an end on January 16, 1959 when the\nsanction to upgrade 100 temporary posts in\n\n833\n\nclass II, grade III to class I, grade II was given by the\nPresident. The seniority rule then fell with the quota rule.\nOn these considerations it was held that the seniority list\nwas valid in regard to promotions made upto January 15, 1959\nto the extent that it was prepared on the basis of the quota\nrule dated October 18, 1951 read with the seniority rule\n1(f) (iii).\n\n This position made it necessary for the Court to\nconsider as to how the inter seniority between the direct\nrecruits and the promotes was to be fixed after January 16,\n1959, if the seniority rule l(f)(iii) ceased to be operative\nfrom that date. Several suggestions were made to the Court\nwith a view to evolving a fair and just seniority rule. The\nCourt declined to be drawn into any such exercise and\npreferred to leave it to the Government to devise a fair and\njust seniority rule, if necessary, in consultation with the\nU.P.S.C. As a corollary, the Court set aside the seniority\nlist of July 15, 1968 and directed the Government to prepare\na fresh seniority list. The list for the years 1955 to\nJanuary 15, 1959 was directed to be prepared in accordance\nwith the quota rule of 1951 read with seniority rule\nl(f)(iii). The list to be effective from January 16. 1959\nwas directed to be prepared in accordance with rules to be\nmade afresh by the Government.\n\n Principles (6) and (7) did not survive for\nconsideration separately in view of the position mentioned\nabove. E\n The Court kept the proceedings pending on its file to\nenable the Government to prepare a fresh seniority list in\nthe light of the directions given by it within six months\nfrom the date of the order. Liberty was given to the parties\nto apply to the Court after the list was filed.\n\n \nThe judgment in \nB.S. Gupta\n (supra) was given on August\n16, 1972. On February 9, 1973, the President made rules\ncalled the Income-tax (Class 1) Service (Regulation of\nSeniority) Rules, 1973. These Rules were made under \nArticle\n309\n of the Constitution and were given retrospective effect\nfrom January 16, 1959. In pursuance of the liberty reserved\nto the parties under the judgment in B.S. Gupta, the\nvalidity of the new Seniority Rules was challenged by the\npromotes. That challenge was considered and repelled by this\nCourt in Bishan Sarup Gupta etc. v. Union of India & ors.\netc.\n \netc.,(l) the 2nd \nGupta\n case.\n\n Rule 3 of the new Seniority Rules of 1973 reads thus:\n\n \"3. Seniority of officers- The seniority of the Income-\n tax officers in the Class I service shall be regulated\n as from the\n\n834\n\n date of commencement of these rules in accordance with\n the provisions hereinafter contained namely:-\n\n (i) the seniority among the promotes inter se shall be\n deter mined in the order of selection for such\n promotion and the officers promoted as a result of\n any earlier selection shall rank senior to those\n selected as a result of any subsequent selection;\n\n (ii) the seniority among the direct recruits inter se\n shall be deter- mined by the order of merit in\n which they are selected for such appointment by\n the Union Public Service Commission and any person\n appointed as a result of an earlier select ion\n shall rank senior to all other persons appointed\n as a result of any subsequent selection; and\n\n (iii) the relative seniority among the promotes and the\n direct recruits shall be in the ratio of 1: 1 and\n the same shall be so determined and regulated in\n accordance with a roster maintained for the\n purpose, which shall follow the following\n sequence, namely:-\n\n (a) promote;\n\n (b) direct recruit;\n\n (c) promote;\n\n (d) direct recruit; and so on\nWhen the new list of seniority was prepared by the\nGovernment in accordance with these rules, the Government\nhad on its hands 73 promotes who, though appointed earlier\nbetween 1956 and 1958, had no quota posts for their\nabsorption. The 73 promotes, described as \"spillovers on\nJanuary 16, 1959\" as also those who were promoted\nsubsequently had to be absorbed in the Service, which could\nonly be done by a special rule framed in that behalf.\n\n \nThe method adopted in the preparation of this list was,\naccording to Palekar, J., who spoke again for the\nConstitution Bench in the 2nd \nGupta\n case, \"simple enough\",\nthough the wording of the rule \"19 not happy\". The simple\nmethod adopted by the Government was like this: The\nseniority list from serial No. 1 to serial No. 485 relating\nto the period from 1951 to January 16, 1959 was prepared in\naccordance with the quota rule read with the seniority rule\nwhich prevailed until January 16, 1959. At serial numbers\n486 to 1717 are officers who had to be accommodated from\nJanuary 16, 1959 in accordance with the new seniority rules.\nSince under rule 3 (iii), the first post in the roster has\nto go to a promote and the next to a direct recruit\n\n835\n\nserial No. 486 goes to a promote, serial No. 487 to a direct\nrecruit A. and so on. Promotes whose ranking is below serial\nNo. 485 are either out of the 73 spillovers as on January\n1959, or are those who were appointed later. Thus, the new\nseniority rule contains a formula for the absorption of all\nPromotes with effect from January 16, 1959 in posts\nallocated to them, it determines their seniority inter se\nand last but not the least, it determines their seniority\nqua the direct recruits appointed from 1959.\n\n \nThe Court over-ruled the objection of the 73 spillover\nPromotes that since, in the \nIst Gupta\n case, the Court had\ndirected that they should be absorbed on a \"priority basis\",\nall of them should have been shown in the seniority list as\nhaving been appointed on January 16, 1959 embolic and the\ndirect recruits for that year should have been shown\nthereafter. It was explained that by the use of the\nexpression \"priority basis\", what was meant by the Court was\nthat the position of the spillover promotes as seniors\nshould not be prejudiced by claims made by later promotes on\nthe ground that since the spillover promotes were recruited\nin excess of the quota, the later promotes whose promotion\ndid not violate the quota rule had higher rights than those\n\n73.\n The principal contention of the promotes in the 2nd GPA\ncase was this: As the quota rule collapsed on January 16,\n1959 the spillover promotes as also those who were promoted\nthereafter must be deemed to have been validly appointed in\naccordance with rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules of 1945.\nSince there was no seniority or quota rule in existence for\ndetermining the seniority of promotes Que the direct\nrecruits, the natural seniority linked with the earlier date\nof appointment must be respected. lt could not be altered to\nthe detriment of the promotes since to do so would violate\n\nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. This contention was rejected\nby the Court on the ground That when the 73 spillover\nappointments were made, there were no allocated or earmarked\nposts to which those promotes could have been validly\nappointed, the ordinary consequence of which would have been\ntheir reversion to Class II posts which they originally\nheld. So long as the quota rule was in existence,\nappointments in excess of the quota, though invalid when\nmade, were at least liable to be regularized in subsequent\nyears when vacancies were available to the promotes as a\nconsequence of the quota rule. But once the quota rule\nceased to exist on January 16, 1959, any possibility of the\nexcess appointments of the promotes being regularized\nvanished. It was in order to overcome this injustice to the\npromotes, that the new rule was framed by the Government.\n\nThe new rule was thus not only the direct outcome of the\njudgment of the Court in the 1st \nGupta\n case,\n\n836\n\nbut it was founded on the very principles on which the\nIncome tax Service had been constituted. The Court finally\nsaid that it had also to be remembered that promotes\nappointed from January 16, 1959 onwards were appointed on an\nofficiating or ad-hoc basis with notice that the question of\ntheir seniority was still undecided. This circumstance,\ncoupled with the absence of clear allocations of posts, made\nit impossible for the promotes to lay claim to seniority and\ncontend that they were deprived of their natural seniority\nin violation of \nArticle 16.\n\n \nShri V.M. Tarkunde who appears on behalf of the\npetitioners in Writ Petition No. 66 of 1974 has made a fresh\nchallenge to the new seniority list prepared in pursuance of\nthe rules dated February 9, 1973 the validity of which was\nupheld by this Court in the 2nd \nGupta\n case (Supra).\nAccording to the learned counsel, the decision in\nJaisinghani. (Supra) suffers from the following three\ninfirmities:\n\n \n(i) It was assumed \nin that case\n that the appointments\n of promotes were in excess of the quota available\n to them because the relevant files were not made\n available to the Court, nor indeed was the\n necessary data placed before the Court, even\n though during the hearing of the appeal the Court\n had asked the Secretary of the Finance Ministry to\n furnish information in that behalf. In the absence\n of such information, the Court made an assumption\n which was unjustified, that the total number of\n vacancies available for promotes was equal to the\n total number of appointments actually made. If,\n for example, 10 direct recruits and 20 promotes\n are appointed in a particular year it cannot be\n assumed either that only 30 vacancies are\n available for being filled up in that year or that\n only 30 appointments are intended to be made by\n the Government during that year. The proper\n inference for the Court to draw, in the absence of\n material which ought to have been produced by the\n Government, was that if appointments were to be\n made of direct recruits and promotes in the\n proportion of 2: 1, and if 20 promotes were in\n fact appointed, the Government desired to appoint\n 40 direct recruits but could only appoint 10,\n probably because of the non- availability of\n suitable candidates for direct recruitment.\n\n (ii) It was wrongly assumed or held that rule 4 of the\n Income tax officers (Class I. Grade ll) Service\n Recruitment Rules was a statutory rule.\n\n837\n\n (iii) lt was wrongly assumed that 100 posts in Class\n 11, Grade III, and 114 posts in the same cadre\n which were upgraded as Class I, Grade II posts on\n January 16, 1959 and December 9, 1960 respectively\n were exclusively allotted to promotes and were in\n fact filled in by the appointment of promotes.\n \nIn regard to the decision in the 2nd \nGupta\n case (Supra)\nit is contended that the decision suffers from the following\ninfirmities:\n\n \n(i) It was wrongly held therein that the 73 spillover\n promotes as on January 16, 1959 could not be given\n priority en bloc, even though it was directed in\n the judgment in the 1st \nGupta\n Case (supra) that\n they should be dealt with on a \"priority basis\".\n\n (ii) It was wrongly held that 214 promotes were\n appointed in excess of the quota available to the\n promotes.\n\n (iii) The conclusion that no distinction can be made\n between promotes and direct recruits once they\n belong to a com- mon cadre was erroneous, as a\n result of which the promotes were unjustly\n deprived of their right to weightage.\n\n (iv) The provision in rule 3 (iii) of the new Rules of\n seniority of 1973 that direct recruits and\n promotes will be appointed in the ratio of SO: SO\n cannot work to the advantage of the promotes\n because the measure of SO percent is fixed by the\n new rules in relation to the actual appointments\n made, whereas the old proportion of 2: 1 was in\n relation to the actual number of vacancies\n available for being filled in.\n\n Learned counsel has demonstrated with the help of some\nof the instances in the new seniority list, as to how\npromotes have been treated unfairly and unjustly in\ncomparison with direct recruits. One such instance is that a\ndirect recruit, Hrushikesh Mishra, who was appointed on July\n3, 1966 is placed at serial No. 1001 while one of the\npetitioners, Kamal Kanti Dutta, who was appointed six months\nearlier on January 1, 1966 is placed at serial No. 1318.\nAnother instance cited is that of a promote, V. R. Hiremath,\nwho was appointed on March 1, 1956 but is placed at serial\nNo. 486, the first 485 officers having been ranked according\nto the quota rule read with the seniority rule which\nprevailed till January 16, 1959. Hiremath, it is contended,\nnot having been appointed in excess of the quota should have\nbeen given his seniority, on account of the three years'\nweightage, with effect from March 1, 1953. In the process,\nhe has lost a benefit spread\n\n838\n\nOver not only three but six years, because his ranking has\nbeen made according to the new rule in relation to the date\nJanuary 16, 1959.\n\n \nThese contentions were adopted by Dr. Y.S. Chitale who\nappears on behalf of the petitioner H.K. Sajnani in Writ\nPetition No. 4146 of 1978. It may be mentioned that in Writ\nPetition No. 66 of 1974 of K.K. Dutta and others which was\nfiled on February 8, 1974 no demand was made for the review\nof the decisions earlier given by this Court on the points\nunder consideration. The request for review of those\ndecisions was made for the first time by the petitioners by\nparagraph 3 of their supplementary affidavit in rejoinder\nwhich was filed in this Court in April 1978. By paragraph 45\nof his Writ Petition, which was filed on June 27, 1978\nSajnani did contend that the aforesaid judgments be reviewed\nsince they were wrongly decided. Sajnani asked by paragraph\nSl of his petition, and so did the petitioners in, the\ncompanion petitions asked by, their supplementary rejoinder,\nthat the decision of this Court in \nUnion of India v. M.\nJangamayya\n(1) should also be reviewed.\n\n In his writ petition, Sajnani has cited several\nspecific instances in support of his contention that under\nthe new seniority rules, the promotes have been treated with\nan evil eye and an uneven hand. His complaint is that direct\nrecruits who are \"15 years junior in age and 15 years junior\nin experience had been placed above him\"; and that the\nseniority list dated April 15, 1978 of Assistant\nCommissioners of Income- tax, which is the basis of further\npromotion to the post of Commissioner of Income- tax, does\nnot include his name at all, though he has been working as\nan Assistant Commissioner ever since 1969 when he was\nselected by the competent authority with the concurrence of\nthe U.P.S.C., after putting in 22 years of service as an\nI.T.O., out of which 10 years' service was rendered in Class\nI itself. Sajnani also prays that the seniority list dated\nApril 15, 1978 for the cadre of Assistant Commissioners be\nset aside as violating \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the\nConstitution.\n\n \nIn addition to these grounds which are pressed upon us\nfor reviewing our decisions in \nJaisinghani, Ist Gupta\n case,\n2nd \nGupta\n case and \nJangamayya\n, (supra) the petitioners have\nplaced strong reliance on the findings of the 49th Report of\nthe Committee on Petitions of the Rajya Sabha, which was\npresented on January 9, 1976. A full text of that Report is\nextracted at pages 242 to 363 of the compilation filed by\nthe writ petitioners in this Court.\n\n It appears from that report that at the sitting of the\nRajya Sabha held on the 23rd August, 1974, Shri Kali\nMukherjee, M.P., presented\n\n839\n\na petition signed by Shri R.C. Pandey, General Secretary,\nAll India A Federation of Income-tax Gazetted Services\nAssociations, New Delhi, praying for the repeal of the\nIncome-tax officers (Class I Service) 4 Regulation of\nSeniority Rules, 1973) and for the framing of fresh\nseniority rules in lieu thereof. The Committee heard the\nrepresentatives of (i) promotes on whose behalf the petition\nwas presented to The Rajya Sabha; (ii) the Ministry of\nFinance and (iii) the direct recruits who were represented\nby the Indian Revenue Service Association. After going\nthrough the evidence, the memoranda and the files- supplied\nby the Ministry of Finance the Committee observed:\n\n \".... the Department from 1944 till today has been\n working in a very haphazard, irregular and unscientific\n way. They made policies, rules, etc. and then went on\n deviating from them to suit certain exigencies. Instead\n of meeting the new situation or the demands of the\n Department in a scientific or rational way, ad-hocism\n prevailed. This led to litigation for nearly two\n decades. Since the year 1944, the Department has made\n so many commissions and omissions in its long working.\n thereby it has provided arguments to both the direct\n recruits and promotes which have been advocated by them\n force fully. 'This has created bitterness and a picture\n of civil war in the Department. It would facilitate our\n understanding if we look at the various points, like\n vacancies, quota, seniority, weightage, confirmations,\n recruitments or promotions to temporary and permanent\n vacancies, etc. in a proper perspective.\"\n\nThe Committee examined the files produced before it by the\nMinistry, expressed its sense of \"shock\" at the plea of the\nMinistry that files of vital matters were not traceable and\nconcluded that the new seniority rules of 1973 should be\nscrapped. The Committee recommended, inter alia,:\n\n \"The entire concept of a common seniority list should\n be given up. The existing common seniority list of 1973\n be replaced by two sets of seniority lists consisting\n of direct recruits and promotes respectively, on the\n basis of the dates of their appointment. The\n integration of the two channels which may be turned\n into two cadres should not be done at the level of\n I.T.Os. but after the level of Assistant\n Commissioners.\"\n\nThe Committee hoped that with the separation of the two\nseniority lists, the controversy of inter se, seniority will\nbe resolved and the hardship caused to the 434 officers\npromoted between 1956 to 1966 will be relieved. The\nCommittee made certain calculations according to which, the\ncorrect number of spill-over promotes as on Jan-\n\n840\n\nuary 16, 1959 was 15 and not 73. Observing in paragraph 7(i)\nthat the Parliament owes responsibility in service matters\ntoo and that the executive is answerable to the Parliament\nfor its actions, the Committee concluded its Report with the\nobservation:\n\n \".... if necessary, a special law could be enacted and\n in corporated in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution\n so that no further scope is left for disputes and\n litigation and the Department would start functioning\n as an efficient and well- knit unit and fulfil its\n intended role in combating the evils of black money and\n tax evasion and ensuring the stability and progress of\n our country.\"\n\nIt is not necessary to go into complications arising out of\nthe random placement of statutes, rules and notifications in\nthe 9th Schedule, but we do hope that, some day, the\npromised millennium will come.\n\n The Solicitor General and the other learned counsel who\nappear for the respondents resisted with great stoutness the\nattempt of the petitioners to reopen decisions rendered by\nthis Court in disputes between promotes and direct recruits\nof the Income-tax Service. The respondents contend that\neveryone of the arguments now presented before us has been\nalready considered carefully in the earlier decisions and\nthe petitioners' demand for review is only yet another\nattempt to retrieve a lost cause. The learned Solicitor\nGeneral also pressed upon us the need for treating the\nmatter as closed. Reviews, he contends, should not be\ngranted save in exceptional circumstances and at any rate,\nhe says, no solution in service matters can ever satisfy\nboth the promotes and direct recruits in an equal measure.\n\n \nHaving considered these rival submissions carefully we\nare of the opinion that there is no substance in the request\nmade on behalf of the petitioners for a review of the\ndecisions in Jaisinghani, the 1st \nGupta\n case, the 2nd \nGupta\n\ncase and \nJangamayya\n (supra).\n\n Certain historic facts have to be borne in mind while\nconsidering the points raised before us. It is necessary to\nrecall that for nearly a decade after 1950, appointments of\npromotes were made far in excess of the quota available to\nthem. So long as the quota rule operated, it was possible to\nregularize their appointments when posts within their quota\nbecame available in later years. But a somewhat\nunprecedented ed situation arose by the upgrading of Class\nII posts to Class I, Grade II,- 100 of the month January 16,\n1959 and 114 on December 9, 1960. This massive upgrading of\nposts brought about a collapse of the quota rule. Subsequent\nabsorption in posts which become available for being filled\nup later really means regularization of appointments, which\nis\n\n841\n\npossible provided there is no excessive deviation from the\nquota rule. A We quite appreciate that no blame can be laid\nat the doors of the promotes on the score that they were\nappointed in excess of the quota available to them. Perhaps,\ntheir appointments must even have enabled the administration\nto tide over administrative stalemate. But the tough problem\nwhich the administration has to face is that whereas it is\nnecessary to recognize and protect the claims of promotes\nwho are appointed in excess of their quota, it is equally\nnecessary to ensure that the direct recruits do not suffer\nan undue set back in service on account of the excessive\nappointments of promotes. The conflicting claims of the two\ncomponents of Service, both having an importance of their\nown, have therefore to be reconciled. It was with that\nobject that the rules have been modified from time to time.\nThe judgments rendered by this Court in matters which the\npetitioners want to be reopened show, without a shadow of\ndoubt, how every effort was made to ensure that no hardship\nor injustice is caused to the promotes merely because their\nappointments exceeded their quota.\n\n \nIt is not correct to say that the judgment in\n\nJaisinghani\n (supra) was based on a concession or that the\nCourt felt compelled to draw the particular conclusions\ntherein because of the inability or refusal of the Finance\nMinistry to produce the relevant files. The Court adopted\nwhat it considered in the circumstances to be a satisfactory\nand scientific method of ascertaining the number of\nvacancies available for being filled up. It came to the\nconclusions that the number; of actual appointments should\ndetermine the number of vacancies available which, with\ngreat respect, was a perfectly legitimate conclusion to\ndraw. In the grey area where service rules operate, more\nthan one view is always possible to take without sacrificing\neither reason or commonsense but the ultimate choice has to\nbe necessarily conditioned by several considerations\nensuring justice to as many as possible and injustice to as\nfew.\n \nWe also find it impossible to hold that there was any\nerror in the conclusions in \nJaisinghani\n (supra) that rule 4\nof the Recruitment Rules was a statutory rule. Subsequent\ndecisions would show that there was hardly any dispute\nbetween the parties, at later stages at any rate, that rule\n4 was a statutory rule.\n\n The other objections raised against the judgments in\nthe various cases partake more or less of the same character\nand must be overruled for similar reasons.\n\n We appreciate that the promotes should not be penalized\nfor the mere reasons that those of them who were appointed\nafter January 16, 1959 were appointed on an officiating or\nad-hoc basis and had clear notice that the question of their\nseniority was still undecided. The\n\n842\n\ncircumstances attendant upon their appointments cannot,\nhowever, be wholly over-looked in determining whether the,\nconstitutional constraints have been over- stepped.\n\n In regard to the individual instances cited before us\nas exemplifying the injustice caused to the Promotes, it is\nnot scare to test the constitutionality of a service rule on\nthe touchstone of fortunes of individuals. No matter with\nwhat care, objectivity and foresight a rule is framed, some\nhardship, inconvenience or injustice is bound to result to\nsome members of the service. The paramount consideration is\nthe reconciliation of conflicting claims of two important\nconstituents of Service, one of which brings fresh blood and\nthe other mature experience.\n\n \nThe counter-affidavit dated August 31, 1973, filed in\nthe 2nd \nGupta\n case (supra) by Shri Mehra, Deputy Secretary,\nMinistry of Finance, shows the fullness with which the\nGovernment had consulted all possible interests while\nframing the impugned rules of seniority. The gamut of\nreasonable possibilities is fairly covered by the four\nalternatives referred to in Shri Mehra's affidavit. The\ninconveniences and disadvantages flowing from the first\nthree alternatives would be far greater than those flowing\nfrom the 4th. That is why the choice ultimately fell on the\n4th alternative, under which the seniority between Promotes\nand direct recruits was fixed alternately on a roster\nsystem, vacancies being equally divided between Promotes and\ndirect recruits, for the entire period from 1959 up-to-date.\n\nThough the promotes submitted in the 2nd \nGupta\n case (supra)\nthat the new seniority rule was unfair to them, they were\nunable to put forward any rational alternative, a fact which\nis noted at page 119 of the Report. That led the Court to\nremark:\n\n \"They are indeed pleased with the increase in the\n promotional chances. But they are sore that the\n artificial rule of seniority which gave them weightage,\n has been removed. They do not dispute that by the\n increase in their ratio in Class I service, a larger\n number of Class II officers will, in course of time get\n a chance to be appointed by promotion as Assistant\n Commissioners. But they are sorry that their chances to\n be promoted to posts higher than that of the Assistant\n Commissioner are now retarded by the removal of the\n weightage.\"\n\n This shows how difficult it is to solve the jig-saw\npuzzle of service disputes.\n\n The Report of the 'Committee on Petitions' of the Rajya\nSabha, howsoever sincerely motivated and fully drawn, cannot\nbe given the\n\n843\n\nimportance which the promotes seem to attach to it. It is\nurged that the findings of the Committee are authentic\nbecause the Finance Ministry had made the relevant files\navailable to it. We do not think that this argument is well-\nfounded. In paragraph 16 of its Report, the Committee does\nrefer to certain files but those files appear to contain\nsome noting in regard to the direct recruitment only. The\nCommittee has given a table of comparative appointments in\nparagraph 19 of its Report, but it had to speculate on an\nimportant aspect of the matter, as is shown by its own\nlanguage, that the table shows the number of direct recruits\nwhich the Government wanted to take and \" on the basis of\nwhich the promotes must have been given promotions\".\n(emphasis supplied). If indeed the relevant files were\nproduced before the Committee, it would not have expressed\nits sense of deep shock and resentment at the -\ndisappearance of the files. We share the concern of the\nCommittee which is expressed in paragraph 32 of its Report\nthus .\n\n \"It is strange that many of the files which could\n probably have thrown light on the question of excess\n promotion, are reported `missing' or `not available'.\n The conclusion is inescapable that these losses of\n files are far from being accidental. We can only\n conclude that important information was deliberately\n withheld from the Supreme Court as well as from the\n Committee. Had the Committee been allowed access to the\n file relating to the Seniority Rules framed in 1973, we\n could have known some more facts\".\n\nThis shows that the Committee, too? had to grope in the dark\nand indulge in a certain amount of speculation on matters\nunder its consideration. In the circumstances, it has done\nas good a job as a Committee can and we desire to find no\nfault with its Report. But we can- not accept the submission\npressed upon us by the petitioners that the Committee's\nReport must displace our judgments.\n\n It shall have been noticed that we have refused to\nreconsider our decisions not so much because of the view\ntaken in the various cases cited by the learned Solicitor\nGeneral, like Sajja Singh v. State of Rajasthan,(l) that\nthis Court should not review its decisions too readily, as\nbecause, on merits, we see no justification for\nreconsidering the judgments already rendered by this Court.\nNo fresh facts are brought to our notice, by way of\ndiscovery of new and important evidence, which would justify\nreconsideration of the decisions already rendered by this\nCourt after the most careful examination of the competing\n\n844\n\ncontentions. The report of the Rajya Sabha Committee on\nPetitions shows, as already indicated, that the relevant\nfiles are still not traceable.\n\n The petitions are accordingly dismissed but there will\nbe no order as to costs.\n\n DESAI, J.-I have carefully gone through the Judgment\nprepared by My Lord the Chief Justice but I regret my\ninability to agree with the same.\n\n The history, chronology of events, contentions\ncanvassed and the three decisions of this Court disposing of\nthe contentions have been so succinctly drawn up in the main\njudgment that its repetition would merely be an idle\nformality. I would, therefore, straightaway deal with the\npoints raised in these petitions.\n\n \nThe petitioners who are promote Income Tax officers\nClass I, Grade II, pray for reconsideration of the three\ndecisions specifically S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India &\nO.r.s.. Bishan Satup Gupta v. Union of India & o.r.s..(2)\n('1st \nGupta\n case' for short) and, Bishan Sarup Gupta etc.\netc. v. Union of India & ors. etc. etc.\n \n(13) ('2nd \nGupta\n\ncase' for short), and to the extent the first mentioned case\nis relied upon in Union of India etc. v. Malji Jangamayya\netc.,(4) on the following grounds;\n\n 1. The conclusion that rule 4 of the Income Tax\n officers (Class l, Grade II) Service Recruitment\n Rules is statutory and, therefore, the quota\n prescribed by the Government of India for\n recruitment to Income Tax officers Class I, Grade\n II in exercise of the power conferred by rule 4\n would be statutory, proceeds on an assumption not\n warranted by the provisions of law bearing on the\n point and if both rule 4 and the quota presumably\n prescribed in exercise of the power conferred by\n rule 4 are not shown to be statutory, the\n foundation on which the edifice in Jaisinghani's\n case rests is knocked out because it can be\n demonstrably established that neither rule 4 nor\n the quota prescribed there under was statutory in\n character but was at best an administrative\n instruction.\n\n845\n\n 2. After the Court on an interpretation of the quota\n rule A held that the quota was related to\n vacancies arising in the grade every year, the\n conclusion reached did not conform to this finding\n but accommodated the so called inability (now\n shown to be factually incorrect) of the Government\n of India to give information to the Court about\n the vacancies in the grade every year with the\n result that the whole calculation of spill over is\n vitiated.\n\n \n3. The mandamus issued in \nJaisinghani\n's case was\n minister pretend by the Government because even if\n the quota was statutory it was operative only\n between 1951 and 1956 but the Government\n interpreted the mandamus to be operative beyond\n 1956 and upto 1967 which misinterpretation has\n been pointed out in the first \nGupta\n case.\n\n 4. \nIn the 1st \nGupta\n case while holding that the\n mandamus directing to treat the quota as statutory\n beyond 1956 was not justified yet till January 16,\n 1959, the Court itself in- , directly accepted the\n quota rule as a guideline and treated that there\n was a spill over of 73 promotes. If rule 4 was not\n statutory and consequently the quota prescribed in\n exercise of the power which had outlived its\n prescribed span of life in 1956 could not be\n brought in to treat any appointment as invalid on\n the ground that there was no allocated post for\n those appointees treated as spill over because\n under rule 4 itself the Government had power to\n determine the method or methods to be employed for\n the purpose of filling in particular vacancies or\n such vacancies as may be required to be filled in\n during any particular period and the number of\n candidates to be recruited by each method.\n\n 5. The action of the Government in upgrading 214\n posts between 1959 and 1962 from Class II, Grade\n III to Class I. Grade II was not open to question\n as at that stage there was no quota rule and rule\n 4 enabled the Government to make recruitment from\n either of the two sources in exercise of its\n executive power. In upholding the seniority rules\n in 2nd Gupta case the Court introduced quota rule\n retrospectively by the back door which is\n impermissible and its operation manifestly\n establishes its utter unfairness inasmuch as a\n direct recruit not any where in the Department or\n may be a student may secure a march over a promote\n who has been working in Class 1, Grade II.\n\n846\n\n While no doubt this Court has constitutional power to\nreview its decision, it is a power to be sparingly exercised\nbecause any such review has the tendency to unsettle\nquestions which may have been finally determined. In fact,\nlearned Solicitor-General appearing for the Union of India\nwarned us that the credibility of this Court is at stake if\nit goes on re-opening and reviewing propositions which have\nbeen finally determined by this Court. Whose credibility is\nat stake would be presently pointed out because the\nexamination of this ugly aspect could have been spared if\nsuch a contention was not canvassed. Repeatedly the\nGovernment of India kept back material from this Court\nfiling affidavit after affidavit showing its inability to\nprovide such important information on which the decision of\nthe Court would turn even though it can now be demonstrably\nestablished that such mate rial and information was with the\nGovernment. If the Government of India Had not withheld such\nmaterial information' which has been rather adversely\ncommented upon not by the Court but by the Legislature, the\ncredibility of the department would be exposed. Reference\nmay be made in this connection to the 49th Report of\nCommittee on Petitions presented on January 9, 1976, to\nRajya Sabha Secretariat, set up to dispose of a petition\nfiled by one R.C. Pandey, General Secretary, All India\nFederation of Income Tax Gazetted Services Associations,\npraying for repeal of the Income Tax officers (Class I\nService) (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1973, and for the\nframing of fresh seniority rules in lieu thereof. While\ndisposing of this petition, the observation pertinent to the\npoint under discussion may be extracted:\n\n \"The Committee is shocked at the pleas of loss of\n vital records taken by the administration. In response\n to the committee's requests relating to important files\n the administration has taken a similar plea. The\n Committee asked for a file which could possibly show\n the correct position on the question whether the 80: 20\n quota during the period 1945-50 was really operative.\n The file is reported missing. Another file reported mis\n sing is that relating to the framing of the recruitment\n rules, 1945. The file relating to Shri R.C. Dutt's\n affidavit (filed in Jaisinghani's case) is also not\n available. Even the very recent file relating to the\n framing of Seniority Rules, 1970, is reported as 'not\n available'. On our insistence they have produced a\n thick sheaf of papers said to be 'reconstructed file'.\n It is strange that many of the files which could\n probably have that own light on the question of excess\n promotion, are reported 'missing' or 'not available'.\n The conclusion is Inescapable that these losses of\n files are far from being accident. We can only\n\n847\n\n conclude that important information was deliberately\n withheld from the Supreme Court as well as from the\n Committee\".\n\n (emphasis supplied)\nOn these observations the credibility submission would not\nonly stand squarely answered, but need not deter us from\ngoing into the points made in these petitions.\n\n \nHowever, this Court does not lightly undertake review\nof its decisions, more especially where conflicting claims\nhave been settled by a decision of the Court and the whole\ngamut may have to be gone through over again on a\nreconsideration of the decision. The approach of the Court\non a plea of reconsideration has been spelt out in \nSajan\nSingh v. State of Rajasthan\n,(l) where a plea for\nreconsideration of the decision of this Court in \nSri Sankari\nPrasad Singh Deo v. Union of India & State of Bihar\n,(2) was\nrepelled observing as under:\n\n \n\"It was, however, urged before us during the\n course of the hearing of these writ petitions that we\n should reconsider the matter and review our earlier\n decision in \nSankari Prasad\n's case. It is true that the\n Constitution does not place any restriction on our\n powers to review our earlier decisions or even to\n depart from them and there can be no doubt that in\n matters relating to the decision of constitutional\n points which have a significant impact on the\n fundamental rights of citizens, we would be prepared to\n review our earlier decisions in the interest of public\n good. The doctrine of stare decisions may not strictly\n apply in this context and no one can dispute the\n position that the said doctrine should not be permitted\n to perpetuate erroneous decisions pronounced by this\n Court to the detriment of general welfare. Even so, the\n normal principle that judgments pronounced by this\n Court would be final, cannot be ignored and unless\n considerations of a substantial and compelling\n character make it necessary to do so, we should be slow\n to doubt the correctness of previous decisions or to\n depart from them\".\n \nG\nSimilarly, in the \nKeshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of\nIncome Tax Bombay North\n,(3) it was held that while\nexercising inherent power to reconsider and review its\nearlier decisions this Court would naturally like to impose\ncertain reasonable limitations and would be reluctant\n\n848\n\nto entertain plea for reconsideration and review of its\nearlier decisions, unless it is satisfied that there are\ncompelling and substantial reasons to do so. It is general\njudicial experience that in matters of law involving\nquestions of construing statutory or constitutional\nprovisions, two views are often reasonably possible and when\njudicial approach has to make a choice between the two\nreasonably possible views, the process of decision-making is\noften very difficult and delicate. In deciding whether a\nreview is necessary when two views are possible it would not\nnecessarily be an adequate reason for such review and\nrevision to hold that though the earlier view is a\nreasonably possible view, the alternative view which is\npressed on the subsequent occasion is more reasonable. The\nCourt's discretion should be guided by such consideration\nwhether in the interest of public good or for any other\nvalid or compulsive reasons it is necessary that the earlier\ndecision should be revised.\n \nThis view was re-affirmed in\n\nManganese Ore (India) Ltd. v. The Regional Assistant\nCommissioner of Sales Tax, Jabalpur\n.(l)\n Bearing these principles in mind, it is necessary to\nexamine whether a case for reconsideration of the three\nearlier decisions is made out by the petitioners or not.\n\n \nJaisinghani\n's case proceeds on a concession that rule 4\nand the quota prescribed by the Government referable to the\npower conferred by rule 4 were statutory in character. This\nis borne out by the observation of the Court which may be\nextracted:\n\n \"It is not disputed that rule 4 of the Income Tax\n officers, Class I, Grade II Service Recruitment Rules\n is a statutory rule and there is a statutory duty cast\n on the Government under ' this Rule to determine the\n method or methods to be employed for the purpose of\n filling the vacancies or number of candidates to be\n recruited by each method\".\n\n Income Tax Service was reconstituted on September 29,\n1944 The Government of India classified the existing Income\nTax Service as Class I and Class II. The scheme provided for\nrecruitment of Income Tax officers Class I, Grade II partly\nby promotion and partly by direct recruitment. The scheme\nwas set out in the Government of India, Finance Department\n(Central Revenues) letter dated September 29, 1944. The\nquota prescribed therein has undergone a revision at a later\ndate. It thus appears that the rules were pre-constitution\nRules and, therefore, their source must be traced to the\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n ('1935 Act' for short).\n\nSection 241\n of the.\n\n849\n\n1935 Act made provision for recruitment and conditions of\nservice. A bare perusal of the section would show that the\npower to make appointments in the case of service of\nFederation and posts in connection with the affairs of the\nFederation was conferred on the Governor-General or such\nperson as he may direct. The power to make rules in this\nbehalf was conferred by sub-s. (2) on the Governor-General\nor by some person or persons authorized by the Governor-\nGeneral to Make the rules for the purpose. On an examination\nof the rules under discussion no material was placed on\nrecord to show that the rules were made either by the\nGovernor-General or such person as authorized by him. As\npointed out a little while ago, the rules were made by the\nFinance Department and no material was placed to show that\nthe person or the persons who made the rules were authorized\nby the Governor-General under\n s. 241(2)\n of the 1935 Act in\nthis behalf. The assumption made, therefore, that rule 4 of\nthe Rules was statutory and that the quota prescribed in\nexercise of the power conferred by rule 4 must be statutory,\nis ill- founded. This knocks out the entire foundation of\nthe judgment of this Court in \nJaisinghani\n's case because\nthis Court proceeded to hold that as the quota was statutory\nany recruitment made in excess of the quota in any given\nyear would be invalid and at best can be regularized by\nrelegating such excess appointments to the quota next year.\nIf rule 4 and the quota referable to the power conferred by\nrule 4 were not statutory but were merely executive\ninstructions, its violation would not render any appointment\nin excess of it invalid, but at best would be irregular and\nin this case on a plain reading of rule 4 it would not even\nbe irregular.\n\n \nIn \nP.C. Sethi & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, this\nCourt held that in the absence of any statutory rules it was\nopen to the Government in exercise of its executive power to\nissue administrative instructions with regard to\nconstitution and reorganization of service as long as there\nis no violation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nIf the parent rule 4 enables the Government to prescribe\nmethod to be employed for the purpose of filling in any\nparticular vacancy {. Or such vacancies as may be required\nto be filled in during any particular period and the number\nof candidates to be recruited by each method and if the so\ncalled quota is not statutory but merely a guideline, the\nGovernment whenever making appointment would be acting in\nexercise of power conferred by rule 4 which leaves it to the\ndiscretion of the Government to decide from what source\nrecruitment should be made and what must be the quantum of\nvacancies that must be filled in at a given point of time\nand such appointment could not be said Hi to be invalid.\n\n850\n\n \nAlternatively, even if the assumption made in\n\nJaisinghi\n's case that rule 4 and the quota referable to the\nexercise of power conferred by rule 4 is unquestionable yet\nwhen this Court held that the quota is related to the\nvacancies, the decision proceeding on an incorrect plea that\nthe information about the number of vacancies in a year is\nnot available, is unsustainable for two reasons, namely, (I)\nthat the files are now produced; and (2) in the absence of\ninformation about the vacancies available the Court could\nnot have invalidated any appointment on the assumption that\nappointment from the source of promotes was in excess of the\nquota. On a plain reading of rules 3, 4 and S it appears\ncrystal clear that the quota was related to vacancies and at\none stage that was accepted. On this finding unless the fact\nsituation is clearly established showing vacancies year to\nyear it would be impossible to hold that in any year there\nwas in excess in either source. Suppose there were 90\nvacancies in a year and the quota was 66-2/3 for direct\nrecruits and 33-1/3 for promotes, it would be open to the\nGovernment to promote 30 persons irrespective of the fact\nwhether 60 direct recruits have become available or not. The\nassumption made that the recruitment made in a given year\nfrom both the sources would furnish information about the\nvacancies in a year would lead to a rather unfair conclusion\ninasmuch as the action of the Government in acting in a\ncertain manner without due regard to the quota rule would\nwork hardship on appointees even though on a correct\ncalculation of vacancies the appointments may be valid and\nlegal.\n\n \nThe mandamus issued in \nJaisinghani\n's case was as under:\n\n \"We are accordingly of the opinion that promotes\n from class II, grade III to class I, grade II service\n in excess of the prescribed quotas for each of the\n years 1951 to 1956 and on wards have been illegally\n promoted and the appellant is entitled to a writ in the\n nature of mandamus commanding respondents 1 to 3 to\n adjust the seniority of the appellant and other\n officers similarly placed like him and to prepare a\n fresh seniority list in accordance with law after\n adjusting the recruitment for the period 1951 to 1956\n and onwards in accordance with the quota rule\n prescribed in the letter of the Government of India No.\n F. 24(2)-Admn. I.T./51 dated October 18, 1951. We,\n however, wish to make it clear that this order will not\n affect such class II officers who have been appointed\n permanently as Assistant Commissioners of Income-Tax.\n But this order will apply to all other officers\n including those who have been ap-\n\n851\n\n pointed Assistant Commissioners of Income Tax\n provisionally pursuant to the orders of the High\n Court\".\n\n \nThe Government understood the mandamus as covering the\nwhole period from 1951 to 1967. When this was questioned in\nthe 1st \nGupta\n case, this Court held that the quota rule\nProprio vigor operated between 1951 to 1956 and if there\nwere promotions in any year in excess of the quota those\npromotions were merely invalid for that year but they were\nnot invalid for all time and they could be regularized by\nbeing absorbed in the quota for the later years. So\nadjusting the quota at any rate upto 1956, the quota rule on\nits own strength evaporated because it was to be in\noperation for a period of five years and no fresh quota rule\nwas issued by the Government. Therefore, after 1956 rule 4\nremained in force in all its rigour and was not hedged in by\nany quota. Rule 4 permitted the Government to make\nrecruitment from either source without lettering its\ndiscretion by any quota rule which it was not bound to\nprescribe. On January 16, 1959, Government in the ministry\nof Finance informed the commissioners of Income tax that the\nPresident had sanctioned the upgrading to class I of 100\ntemporary Posts of Income Tax officers, Class II. On\nDecember 19, 1960, there was further upgrading of 114 posts\nfrom class II to class I. Between 1959 and 1962 these 214\nposts were filled in by promotes.\n \nNow, in the \nIst Gupta\n case\nthis court held that even though the quota rule expired in\n1956, yet the Government of India adopted it as a guideline.\nMay be, it may be so. Does any appointment in breach of the\nguideline neither statutory nor even having the fragrance of\nany executive instruction become invalid more so when the\nGovernment had power to make appointment from either source\nuninhibited by any quota rule under rule 4 ? Yet the Court\nfound that between 1956 and 1959 when 100 pasts came to be\nupgraded there was a spillover of 73 persons and because of\nthe huge departure from guidelines the weightage rule giving\nseniority to the promotes by 2- 3- years was crushed under\nits own debris. Again, with respect it must be confessed\nthat rule 4 is overlooked or bypassed when saying that there\nwas a spillover of 73 promotes between 1956 and 1959. Nor\ncould it be said that the upgrading of 214 posts and filling\nthem up by promotes would be in any way even irregular much\nless invalid because rule 4 enables Government to draw from\neither source.\n\n \nIn the 2nd \nGupta\n case in view of the decision in 1st\n\nGupta\n case a fresh seniority rule was prepared and it was\nmade retroactive from 11 January 16, 1959. If, the inter\nalia provides that the relative seniority amongst the\npromotes and the direct recruits shall be in the ratio of\n\n852\n\n1: 1 and the same shall be so determined and regulated in\naccordance with a roster maintained for the purpose, which\nshall follow the following sequence, namely:\n\n (a) Promote;\n\n (b) direct recruit,\n\n (c) Promote,\n\n (d) direct recruits, and so on.\n\n \nThis method of roster undoubtedly introduces a quota by\nthe back door. Once a roster is introduced Promote direct\nrecruit, Promote direct recruit etc. even if some promotes\nhave come in a bulk and if at a later date some direct\nrecruits are appointed in bulk, while preparing roster an\nearlier date promote will have to yield his place to a later\ndate direct recruit. Bluntly translated it means that the\ndirect recruit who was never in service when promote was\npromoted, probably he may be a student. May be he may not\nhave even passed the competitive examination, yet he may\ncome into the picture and challenge one who has already been\nserving in the Department for a number of years. To\nillustrate, in the new seniority list prepared by the\nGovernment pursuant to the order made by this Court in the\n1st \nGupta\n case and upheld by this Court in 2nd \nGupta\n case a\npromote of 1962 will have to yield his place to a direct\nrecruit of 1966. With utmost hesitation I must say that\nservice jurisprudence hardly permits a situation where a man\nnot in service comes and challenges some thing which has\nbeen done much before he came in to service and gets such an\nadvantage which on the face of it appears to be unfair. But\napart from this, even in 1959 there was no quota rule and\nassuming that the old service rule giving weightage to the\npromotes crushed under that weight of large number of\npromotes being promoted, it would not be open to the\nGovernment to so prepare a fresh seniority list which cannot\nbe given effect to unless a roster is introduced which\nintroduces quota by the back door and which is so unfair in\nits operation that promotes of 1962 will have to yield place\nto direct recruits of 1966. Now under the old weightage rule\npromotes were given a weightage for service of 2-3 years\nover direct recruits because direct recruits were unable to\nundertake regular assessment work for a period of 2-3 years\nwhen they were more or less under training while promotes\nhave been doing this work for a number of years and their\nexperience is rejected in the weightage. The whole thing now\nappears in the reverse gear in that an uninitiated direct\nrecruit takes precedence over an experienced promote.\n The\nunfairness of the new rule is writ large on the face of it.\n\n853\n\n This rule violates another important rule well\nrecognised in the service jurisprudence that in the absence\nof any valid rule of seniority date of continuous\nofficiation provides a valid rule of seniority. This rule is\ncompletely crucified under two unsustainable assumption that\na quota rule having guideline sanction is made imperative in\ncharacter and assumed to be in force between 1956 and 1959,\nand that even though Government in exercise of power\nconferred by rule 4 for its own necessity promoted 214\npromotees to the upgraded posts yet they must yield place to\nsome future direct recruits who may come to the department\nat a later date. This Court sustained the position holding\nthat these were ad hoc appointments, and there were no\nregular posts for those promotees. This approach wholly\noverlooks the effect and the force of rule 4.\n\n Certainty and continuity demand that this Court should\nnot reopen settled decisions or reopen closed questions\nunless under a compelling necessity. It may be that the fate\nof Income Tax officers, promotees and direct recruits, may\nrest with the three decisions of this Court. Unfairness to\nsome of them may itself not provide a good and compelling\nreason for reopening and reconsidering the decisions.\nTherefore, if that were the only point for our consideration\nI would have unhesitatingly agreed with the decision\nrendered by My Lord the Chief Justice. But there is a\nfurther compelling necessity which impels me to pen these\nfew lines.\n\n Jaisinghani and the two Gupta cases are being quoted\ntimes without number before this Court for the principles\nenunciated therein. These decisions, therefore, affect\nsubsequent decisions of this Court as well as the High\nCourts. And some of the principles enunciated in these three\ncases stand in sharp contrast to other decisions of this\nCourt and in fact this Court itself felt it necessary to\nwarn that it may become necessary to reconcile these\nconflicting decisions. In this connection reference may be\nmade to N.K. Chauhan and ors. v. State of Gujarat and ors.\nwhere this Court after referring to two sets of decisions\ncharting two different courses, observed as under:\n\n \n\"After all, we live in a judicial system where\n earlier curial wisdom, unless competently over-ruled,\n binds the Court. The decisions cited before us start\n with the leading case in Mervyn Coutindo & ors. v.\n Collector of Customs, Bombay and close with the last\n pronouncement in \nBadami v. State of Mysore\n and ors.\n This time-span has seen dicta go zigzag but we see no\n difficulty\n\n854\n\n in tracing a common thread of reasoning.\n \nHowever, there\n are divergencies in the ratiocination between Mervyn\n Coutindo (supra) and Govind Dattatray Kelkar and ors.\n v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and ors.,\n on the one hand and \nS. G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India\n\n (\nsupra) Bishan Sarup Gupta v. Union of India\n (supra)\n Union of India and ors. v. Bishan Sarup Gupta , and A.\n K. Subraman and ors. v. Union of India on the other,\n especially on the rota system and the year being\n regarded as a unit, that this Court may one day have to\n harmonize the discordance unless Government wakes up to\n the need for properly drafting its service rules so as\n to eliminate litigative waste of its servants'\n energies\".\n\n It is not for a moment suggested and I say so with\nutmost respect that the aforementioned three decisions are\nincorrect. In the light of the materials now placed\nespecially the files which were withheld from the Court and\nthe Committee the only view that I express is that enough\ncompelling and necessary material has been placed on record\nmaking out a strong case for reconsideration of these\ndecisions. Accordingly, in my view the present two petitions\ndeserve to be placed before a larger Bench to be constituted\nby the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India.\n\n ORDER\n In view of the majority opinion the Writ Petitions are\ndismissed with no order as to costs.\n\nS.R.

      "text": "HEADNOTE:\n With a view to improving the Income-tax administration,\nthe Government of India in consultation with the Federal\nPublic Service Commission decided to reconstitute then\nexisting income-tax services, Class I and II. Under the\nscheme of reorganisation of the services set out in a letter\ndated September 29, 1944 of the Government of India Finance\nDepartment, the central service Class I was to consist of\n(i) Commissioners of Income-Tax (ii) Assistant Commissioners\nof Income-Tax; (iii) Income-Tax Officers Grade I and (iv)\nIncome-Tax Officers Grade-II. Thus Income-Tax Officers Class\nI were to be of two grades, Grade I and II; while Income-Tax\nOfficers Class II were to consist of one grade, namely,\nGrade III. Clauses (a) to (e) of paragraph 2 of the letter\nprescribed the mode of recruitment to the various posts in\nClass I and Class II. Under Clause (d) recruitment to Class\nI Grade II was 20% by promotion from Class II, Grade III and\n80% by direct recruitment via Indian Audit and Accounts\nService etc. examination. Rules regulating recruitment to\nthe Income-Tax Officers (Class I, Grade II) service \"liable\nto alteration from year to year\" were published on May 26,\n1945, by a resolution of the Finance (Central Revenues)\nDepartment. Rule 3 provided that recruitment to Class I,\nGrade II's service shall be made (1) by competitive\nexamination held in India in accordance with Part-II of the\nRules and (ii) by promotion on the basis of selection of\nGrade III (Class II service, in accordance with Part III of\nthe Rules. By Rule 4 of the Government was to determine,\nsubject to the provisions of Rule 3, the method or methods\nto be employed for the purpose of filling any particular\nvacancies, or such vacancies as may be required to be filled\nduring any particular period, and the number of candidates\nto be recruited by such method. Part III of the Rules called\n(Recruitment by Promotion) provided by paragraph 21 that\n\"recruitment by promotion shall be made by selection from\nGrade-III Income-Tax Officers (Class II service) after\nconsultation with the Federal Public Service and that no\nofficer shall have any claim to such promotion as of right\".\n By a letter dated January 24, 1950 the Government of\nIndia laid down certain rules of seniority : (a) as between\ndirect recruits; (b) as between promotees selected from\nClass II and (c) as between direct recruits who completed\ntheir probation in a given year and the promotees appointed\nin the same year to Class I.\n812\n On October 18, 1951 the Government of India addressed a\nletter to all the Commissioners of Income-Tax titled\n\"Income-Tax Officers, Grade-II (Class- I service)-quota of\nvacancies filled by promotions\" wherein it was outlined that\nfor a period of 5 years in the first instance 66 and 2/3 per\ncent of the vacancies in Class-I, Grade-II would be filled\nby direct recruitment by a combined competitive examination\nand the remaining 33 and 1/3 per cent on the basis of\nselection by promotion from Grade-III (Class-II service).\nAny surplus vacancies which could not be filled by promotion\nfor want of suitable candidates would be added to the quota\nof vacancies to be filled by direct recruitment. By a letter\ndated September 5, 1952 the Government of India revised with\na retrospective effect the Rules of Seniority which were\nlaid down on January 24, 1950. Rule 1 (f)(iii) as framed on\nJanuary 24, 1950 which was to the effect that \"the promotees\nwho have been certified by the commission in any calendar\nyear shall be senior to all direct recruits who complete\ntheir probation during that year or after and are confirmed\nwith effect from a date in that year or after\" was revised\non September 5, 1952 as \"officers promoted in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee before the next sitting of the Departmental\nPromotion Committee shall be senior to all direct recruits\nappointed on the results of the examinations held by the\nUnion Public Service Commission during the calendar year in\nwhich the Departmental Promotion Committee met during the\nthree previous years\". Rule 1(f)(iv) of the 1952 Rules dealt\nwith a special situation in which an officer initially\nappointed to Class II service was given seniority in the\nsame manner as a departmental promotee, if subsequent to his\npassing the departmental examination he was appointed to\nClass I on the results of the competitive examination. Rule\n4 of Chapter IX of the Rules of Promotion of the Central\nBoard of Revenue Office Procedure Manual states that the\nprescribed minimum service for an officer of Class-I, Grade-\nII for promotion to Grade-I is 5 years gazetted service\nincluding one year in Class-I, Grade-II. For a promotee from\nClass-II the minimum period of service for promotion to\nClass-I, Grade-I would be actually 4 years service in Class-\nII and one year service in Class-I, Grade-II.\n In an appeal arising out of Writ Petition No. 189-D of\n1962 filed by one S. G. Jai Singhani (who is respondent No.\n358 in Writ Petition No. 66 of 1974 and respondent No. 5 in\nWrit Petition No. 4146 of 1978), a constitutional Bench of\nthis Court held : (i) Rules 1(f)(iii) and (iv) of the\nSeniority Rules framed in 1952 did not violate \nArticles 14"

      "text": "of the Constitution. The Court suggested that for future\nyears the roster system should be adopted by framing an\nappropriate rule for working out the quota between the\ndirect recruits and the promotees and that a roster n should\nbe maintained indicating the order in which appointments\nwere made by direct recruitment and by promotion in\naccordance with the percentages fixed under the statutory\nrule for each method of recruitment. Thus the direct\nrecruits succeeded substantially in their contentions, the\nquota rule acquired statutory force, appointments of\npromotees in excess of the quota became bad and it became\nobligatory for the Government to prepare a fresh seniority\nlist. Promotees found to have been appointed in excess of\nthe quota admissible to promoteeS had naturally to go down\nin the final gradation of seniority.\n On July 15, 1968 the Government prepared a fresh\nseniority list and filed it in the Supreme Court. That list\nfailed to satisfy promotees as well as direct recruits.\nWhether this seniority list was collect and in accordance\nwith the mandamus which was issued by this Court in S. G.\nJai Singhani`s case, [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703 came up for\nconsideration in four appeals which were disposed of by a\ncommon judgment dated August 16, 1972 reported as Bishan\nSarup Gupta v. Union of India (first Gupta's case) in [1975]\nSuppl. S.C.R. 491. The Court was also called upon to examine\nthe correctness of seven principles enumerated in the\nGovernment letter dated July 15, 1968 governing seniority.\nThe first principle was accepted as good. The second and the\nthird principles were held to be partially incorrect in so\nfor as they excluded reference to all the promotees of 1952.\nThe Court held that the promotees of 1952 should be referred\nto in the seniority list whether they are affected or not,\nthe object being the ascertainment of excess promotions.\nThis Court further held that the rule dated October 18, 1951\nwas not concerned with the Constitution of the cadre but\n\"was concerned with how permanent vacancies were to be\nfilled\" and, therefore, the promotees would be entitled to\n1/3 of the vacancies in any particular year whether or not\nthere was direct recruitment by competitive examination in\nthat year. This ratio of 2 :1 between the direct recruits\nand the promotees could not be made to depend on whether any\ndirect recruits were appointed in any particular year. It,\ntherefore, became essential to determine the actual\nvacancies in the cadre but the Government put forward the\nplea even in this case as in Jai Singhani's that it was\nimpossible for them to give the exact figure of vacancies in\nany particular year. According to the Court, when the quota\nrule referred to vacancies it was implicit that the\nvacancies are those which the Government wanted to fill up\nwhatever may be the actual number of vacancies available for\nbeing filled up. Any number of posts among the promotees\nmore than 1/3 of the total number of appointments in the\nparticular year was considered to be in excess of the quota\navailable for promotees. The Court rejected the argument\nthat the quota rule which is co-related to vacancies of\npermanent posts only and not to those in temporary posts.\nWhile upholding the weightage allowed under Rule I (f) (iii)\nto Class-II officers promoted to Class-l, Grade-II, the\nCourt also held that even after 1956, the Government was\nentitled by reason of Rule 4 of the Recruitment Rules of\n1945 to follow the quota rule of 1951 as a rough guideline,\n\"without going through the trouble of putting the same on\nrecord in so many words\" and\n814\nthat in the normal course the Government was entitled to\nprepare the seniority list till the end of 1958 in\naccordance with the quota rule of 1951. In regard to the\nposition after year 1958 the Court came to the conclusion\nthat the quota rule ceased to apply and came to an end on\nJanuary 16, 1959, when the sanction to upgrade 100 temporary\nposts in Class-II, Grade-III to Class-I, Grade-II was given\nby the President. The seniority rule then fell with quota\nrule. On these considerations the Court held that the\nseniority list. was valid in regard to promotions made up to\nJanuary 15, 1959 to the. extent that it was prepared on the\nbasis of the quota rule dated October 18,1951 read with\nSeniority Rule l(f)(iii). As a corollary, the Court set\naside the seniority list of July 15, 1968 and directed the\nGovernment to prepare a fresh seniority list. The List for\nthe years 1955 to January 15, 1959 was directed to be\nprepared in accordance with the quota rule of 1951 read with\nSeniority Rule l(f) (iii). The List to be effective from\nJanuary ]6, 1959 was directed to be prepared in accordance\nwith the rules to be made afresh by the Government.\n On February 9, 1973 the President made rules called the\nIncome-Tax (CIass-I) Service (Regulation of Seniority) Rules\n1973 under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution giving\nretrospective effect from January 16, 1969. In pursuance of\nthe liberty reserved to the parties under the Judgment in\nthe first Gupta's case the validity of the new seniority\nrules was challenged by the promotees once again. The\nchallenge was considered and repelled by the Court in Bishan\nSwarup Gupta etc. v. Union of India and Ors.[1975] 1 S.C.R.\n104, second Gupta's case., When the new list of seniority\nwas prepared by the Government, in accordance with these\nrules, the Government had on its hand 73 promotees who\nthough appointed earlier between 1956 and 1958 had no quota\npost, for their absorption. The 73 promotees described as\n\"spill-overs on January 15, 1959\", as also those who were\npromoted subsequently had to be absorbed in the Service,\nwhich could only be done by a special rule framed in that\nbehalf. The new seniority rule contained a formula for the\nabsorption OF all promotees with effect from January 16,\n1959 in posts allocated to them, it determined their\nseniority inter se and last but not the least it determined\ntheir seniority qua the direct recruits appointed from 1959.\nThe Court overruled the objection of the '73' spill-over\npromotees that since in the first Gupta's case the Court had\ndirected that they should be absorbed on a \"priority basis\".\nall of them should have been shown in the seniority list as\nhaving been pointed on January 16, 1959 en bloc and the\ndirect recruits for that year should have been shown\nthereafter. It was explained that by use of the expression\n\"priority basis\" what was meant by the Court was that the\nposition or the spill-over promotees as seniors should not\nbe prejudiced by claims made by later promotees on the\nground that since the spill-over promotees were recruited in\nexcess of the quota, the later promotees whose promotion did\nnot violate the quota rule had higher rights than those 73.\nThe Court further held that, v he the 73 spill-over\nappointments were made, there were no allocated or earmarked\nposts to which those promotees could have been validly\nappointed. the ordinary consequence of which would have been\ntheir revision to Class II posts which they originally held.\nSo long as the quota rule was in existence appointments in\nexcess of the quota, though invalid when made, were atleast\nliable to be regularised in subsequent years when vacancies\nwere available. to the promotees as a consequence of the\nquota rule But. Once the quota rule ceased to exist on\nJanuary 16, 1959, any possibility of the excess appointments\nof the promotees being regularised vanished. It was in order\n815\nto overcome this injustice to the promotees, that the new\nrule was framed by the Government. The new rule was thus not\nonly the direct outcome of the judgment or the Court in the\nIst Gupta case, but it was followed on the very principles\non which the Income-tax Service had been constituted. The\nCourt finally said that it had also to be remembered that\npromoteeS appointed from January 16, 1959 onwards were\nappointed on an officiating or ad hoc basis with notice that\nthe question of their seniority was still undecided. This\ncircumstance coupled with the absence of clear allocation of\nposts, made it impossible for the promotees to lay claim to\nseniority and contend that they were deprived of their\nnatural seniority in violation of \nArticle 16."

Union of India and Anr.\n[1967] 2 S.C.R. 703; Bishan Swarup Gupta v. Union of India\nand Ors.(First Gupta's case),[1975] Suppl. S.C.R. 495;\nBishan Swarup Gupta etc. v. Union of India and ors. (Second\nGuptas case) [1975] S.C.R. 104 and to the extent S. G. Jai\nSinghani's case is relied upon in Union of India v. Malji\nJangamayya etc.,[1977] 2 S.C.R. 28. On the following\ngrounds:\n 1. The Conclusion that Rule 4 of the Income-Tax\nofficers (Class-l. Grade-II) Service Recruitment Rules is\nstatutory and, therefore, the quota prescribed by the\nGovernment of India for recruitment to Income-Tax officers\nClass-I, Grade-II in exercise of the power conferred by Rule\n4 would be statutory, proceeds on an assumption not\nwarranted by the provisions of law bearing on the point and\nif both Rule 4 and the quota presumably prescribed in\nexercise of the power conferred by Rule 4 are not shown to\nbe statutory; the foundation of which the edifice in S. G.\nJai Singhani's case rests is knocked down because it can be\ndemonstrably established that neither rule 4 nor the quota,\nprescribed thereunder was statuary in character but was at\nbest an administrative instruction.\n 2. After the Court on an interpretation of the quota\nrule held that the quota was related to vacancies arising in\nthe grade every year, the conclusion reached did not conform\nto this finding but accommodated the so-called inability\n(now shown to be factually incorrect) of the Government of\nIndia to give information to the Court about the vacancies\nin the grade every year with the result that the whole\ncalculation of spill-over is vitiated.\n 3. The mandamus issued in Jai Singhani's case was\nmisinterpreted by the Government because even if the quota\nwas statutory it was operative only between 1951 and 1956\nbut the Government interpreted the mandamus to be operative\nbeyond 1956 and upto 1967 which misinterpretation has been\npointed out in the first Gupta's case.\n 4. In the first Gupta's case while holding that the\nmandamus directing, to treat the quota statutory beyond.\n1956 was not justified yet till January 16. 1959, the Court\nitself indirectly accepted the quota rule as a guideline and\ntreated that there was a spill-over of 73 promotees. If Rule\n4 was not statutory and consequently the quota prescribed in\nexercise of the power which had outlived its prescribed span\nof life in 1956 could not be brought in to treat any\nappointment as invalid on the ground that there was no\nallocated post for those appointees treated as spill-over\nbecause under Rule 4 itself the Government had power to\ndetermine the method or methods to be employed for the\npurpose of\n816\nfilling in particular vacancies or such vacancies as may be\nrequired to be filled in during any particular period and\nthe number of candidates to he recruited by each method.\n 5. The action of the Government of upgrading 214 posts\nbetween 1959 and 1962 from Class-II, Grade-II to Class I,\nGrade II was not open to question as at that stage there was\nno quota rule and Rule 4 enabled the Government to make\nrecruitment from either of the two sources in exercise of\nits executive power. In regard to the second Gupta's case\nthe Court introduced quota rule retrospectively by the back\ndoor which is impermissible and its operation manifestly\nestablishes its utter unfairness inasmuch as a direct\nrecruit nor any where in the department or may be a student\nmay secure a march-over a promotee which has been working in\nClass-I, Grade-II.\n Dismissing the petitions the Court,\n^\n HELD: Per Chandrachud, C.J. (On behalf of N. L .\nUntawalia, P. S Kailasam, E. S. Venkataramaiah, JJ. and\nhimself). (Majority view)\n i. A consideration of certain historic facts in this\ncase makes it clear that there is no substance in the\nrequest made for a review of the decisions in Jai Singhani\nv. Union of India and Ors., [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703; Bishan\nSwarup Gupta v. Union of India and ors. (Ist Gupta's case)\n[1975] supplementary S.C.R. 491; Bishan Swarup Gupta v.\nUnion of India & Ors.; Second Gupta's case [1975] 1 S.C.R.\n104 and Union of India v. Malji Jangamayya[1977] 2 S.C.R.\n28. [840 E-F]\n For nearly a. decade after 1950, appointments of\npromotees were made far in excess of the quota available to\nthem. So long as the quota rule operated. it was possible to\nregularise their appointments when posts within their quota\nbecame available in later years. But a somewhat\nunprecedented situation arose by the upgrading of Class II\nposts to Class I grade II-100 of them on January 16, 1959\nand 114 on December 9, 1960. This massive upgrading of posts\nbrought about a collapse of the quota rule. Subsequent\nabsorption in posts which became available for being filled\nup later really means regularisation of appointments, which\nis possible provided there is no excessive deviation from\nthe quota rule. [840 G-H, 841 A]\n It is true that no blame can be laid at the doors of\nthe promotees on the score that they were appointed in\nexcess of tho quota available to them. Perhaps, their\nappointments must even have enabled the administration to\ntide over administrative stale-mate. But the tough problem\nwhich the administration has to face is that whereas it is\nnecessary to recognise and protect the claims of promotees\nwho were appointed in excess of their quota, is equally\nnecessary to ensure that the direct recruits do not suffer\nan nude set-back in service on account of the appointments\nof promotees. The conflicting claims of the two components\nof Service, both having an importance of their own, have\ntherefore to be reconciled. It was with that object that the\nrules have been modified from time to time. The judgments\nrendered by this Court in the aforesaid four cases show,\nwithout a shadow doubt, how every effort was made to ensure\nthat no hardship or injustice is caused to the promotees\nmerely because their appointments exceeded their quota. [841\nA-C]\n 2. It is not correct to say that the judgment in Jai\nSinghani was based on a concession or that the Court felt\ncompelled to draw the particular conclusions\n817\ntherein because of the inability or refusal of the Finance\nMinistry to produce A the relevant files. The Court adopted\nwhat it considered in the circumstances to be a satisfactory\nand scientific method of ascertaining the number of\nvacancies available for being file up. It came to the\nconclusion that the number of actual appointments should\ndetermine the number of vacancies available which was a\nperfectly legitimate conclusion to draw. In the grey area\nwhere service rules operate, more than one view is always\npossible to take without sacrificing either reason or\ncommonsense but the ultimate choice has to be necessarily\nconditioned by several considerations ensuring justice to as\nmany as possible and injustice to as few. There was no error\nin the conclusion in Jai Singhanni that Rule 4 of the\nRecruitment Rules was a statutory rule Subsequent decisions\nwould show that there was hardly any dispute between the\nparties, at later stages at any rate, that Rule 4 was a\nstatutory rule. [841 D-G]\n 3. No doubt, the promotees should not be penalised for\nthe mere reason that those of them who were appointed after\nJanuary 16, 1959 were appointed on an officiating or ad hoc\nbasis and had clear notice that the question of their\nseniority was still undecided. The circumstances attendant\nupon their appointments cannot, however, be wholly\noverlooked in determining whether the constitutional\nconstraints have been over-stepped. [841 H, 842 A]\n 4. It is not safe to test the constitutionality of a\nservice rule on the touch stone of fortunes of individuals.\nNo matter with what care, objectivity and foresight a rule\nis framed, some hardship, inconvenience or injustice is\nbound to result to some members of the service. The\nparamount consideration is the reconciliation of conflicting\nclaims of two important constituents of Service, one of\nwhich brings fresh blood and the other mature experience.\n[842 A-C]\n 5. Though the promotees submitted in the Second Gupta\ncase that the new seniority rule was unfair to them, they\nwere unable to put forward any rational alternative. On the\ncontrary the counter-affidavit dated August 31, 1973 file in\nthe Second Gupta case by Shri Mehra., the Deputy Secretary\nFinance, shows the fullness with which the Government had\nconsulted all possible interests while framing the impugned\nrules of seniority. The gamut of reasonable possibilities is\nfairly covered by the four alternatives referred to in Shri\nMehra's affidavit. The inconveniences and disadvantages\nflowing from the first three alternatives would be far\ngreater than those flowing from the fourth. That is why the\nchoice ultimately fell on the fourth alternative under which\nthe seniority between promotees and direct recruits was\nfiled alternately on a roster system, vacancies being\nequally divided between promotees and direct recruits, for\nthe entire period from 1959 up-to-date. The observation of\nthe Court in the Second Gupta's case at page 119 shows how\ndifficult it is to solve the jig-saw puzzle of service\ndisputes. [842 C-Hl G\n 6. The report of the 'Committee on petitions' of the\nRajya Sabha, howsoever, sincerely motivated and fully drawn\ncannot be given the importance which the promotees seem to\nattach to it. In paragraph 16 of its Report the Committee\ndoes refer to certain files but those files appear to\ncontain some notions in regard to the direct recruitment\nonly. The Committee has given a table of comparative\nappointments in paragraph 19 of its Report but it had to\nspeculate on an important aspect of the matter, as is shown\nby its own language, that the table shows the member of\ndirect recruits which the Government wanted to take and \"on\nthe basis of which the promotees must have been given promo-\n818\ntions\". If indeed the relevant files were produced before\nthe Committee, it would not have expressed its sense of deep\nshock and resentment at the disappearance of the files.\nFurther para 32 of the Report shows that the Committee had\nto grope in the dark and indulge in a certain amount of\nspeculation on matters under its consideration. In the\ncircumstances it has done as good a job as a Committee can\nand no fault need to found with it. But nevertheless the\nsaid Committee's report cannot displace the Courts\njudgments. [842 H, &43 A-C]\n Even on merits there is no justification for\nconsidering the judgments already rendered by this Court\ninasmuch as no fresh facts were brought to notice by way of\ndiscovery of new and important evidence which would justify\nreconsideration of the decisions already rendered by this\nCourt after the most careful examination of the competing\ncontentions. The report of the Rajya Sabha Committee on\npetitions shows that the relevant files are still not\ntraceable. [843 E-F, G-H, 844 A]\n Per Desai, J. (contra )\n 1. While, no doubt, the Supreme Court has\nconstitutional rower lo review its decision, it is a power\nto be sparingly exercised because any such review has the\ntendency to unsettle questions which may have been finally\ndetermined. The Supreme Court does not lightly undertake\nreview of its decisions more especially where conflicting\nclaims have been settled by the decision of this Court and\nthe whole gamut may have to be gone through over again on a\nreconsideration of the decision. While exercising inherent\npower to reconsideration and review its earlier decision,\nthe Supreme Court would naturally like to, impose certain\nreasonable limitations and would be reluctant to entertain\nplea for reconsideration and review all its earlier\ndecisions unless it is satisfied that there are compelling\nand substantial reasons to do so. It is general judicial\nexperience that in manners of law involving questions of\nconstruing statutory or constitutional provisions, two views\nare often reasonably possible and when judicial approach has\nto make a choice between the two reasonable possible views,\nthe process of decision making is often very difficult and\ndelicate. [846 A-B, 847 C, G-H. 848 A-B]\n In deciding whether a review is necessary when two\nviews are possible it would not necessarily be an adequate\nreason for such review and revision to hold that though the\nearlier view is reasonably possible view the alternative\nview which is pressed on the subsequent occasion is more\nreasonable. The Court's discretion should be guided by such\nconsideration whether in the interest of public good or for\nany other valid or compulsive reason it is necessary that\nthe: earlier decision should be revised.

The power to make rules in this behalf was conferred\nby sub-section '' on the Governor-General or by some person\nor persons authorised by the Governor-General to make the\nrules fol the purpose. But, the rules were not made either\nby the Governor-General or such person authorised by him.\n'The rules were made by the Finance Department and no\nmaterial was placed to show that the persons or the persons\nwho made the rules were authorised by the Governor-General,\nunder \nSection 241(2)\n of the 1935 Act in this behalf. The\nassumption made therefore, that Rule 4 of the Rules are\nstatutory and that the quota prescribed in exercise of the\npower conferred by Rule 4 must be statutory is ill-founded\nThis knocks out the entire foundation of the judgment of\nthis Court in Jai Singhani's case because this Court\nproceeded to hold that as the quota was statutory, any\nrecruitment made in excess of the quota in any given year\nwould be invalid and at best can be regularised by\nrelegating such excess appointment to the quota next year.\nIf Rule 4 and the quota referable to the power conferred by\nRule 4 were not statutory but were merely execute\ninstructions, its violation would not render any appointment\nin excess of it invalid but at best would be irregular and\nin this case on a plain reading of Rule 4 it would not even\nbe irregular. [848 G-H, 849 A-E]\n 3. In P. C. Sethi & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. this\nCourt held that in the absence of any statutory rules it was\nopen to the, Government in exercise of its executive power\nto issue administrative instructions with regard to\nconstitution and recognition of service as long as there is\nno violation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the constitution. If\nthe present Rule 4 enables the Government to prescribe\nmethod to be employed for the purpose of filling, in any\nparticular vacancy or such vacancies as may be required to\nbe filled in during any particular period and the number of\ncandidates to be recruited by each method arid if the so\ncalled quota is not statutory but merely a guideline, the\nGovernment whenever making appointments would be acting in\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 which leaves it to the\ndiscretion, of the Government to decide from what Source\nrecruitment should be made and what must be the quantum of\nvacancies that must be filled in at a given point of time\nand such appointment could not be said to be invalid. [849\nE-H]\n Alternatively. even if the assumption made in Jai\nSinghani's case that Rule 4 and the quota referable to the\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 is unquestionable yet\nwhen this Could held that the quota is related to the\nvacancies, the decision proceeding on an incorrect plea that\nthe information about the number of vacancies in a year is\nnot available, is unsustainable for two reasons, namely,(1)\nthat the files are now produced; (2) in the absence of\ninformation about the vacancies available the Court could\nnot have invalidated any appointment on the assumption that\nappointment from the source of promotees was in excess of\nthe quota. [850 A-B]\n820\n on a plain levelling of Rules 3,, 4 and 5, it is clear\nthat the, quota was related to vacancies and at one stage\nthat was accepted. On this finding unless the fact situation\nis clearly established showing vacancies year to year it\nwould be impossible to hold that in any year there was\nexcess in either source. Suppose there were 90 vacancies in\na year and the quota was 66-2/3 for direct recruits all 33\n1/3 for promotees it would be open to the Government to\npromote 30 persons irrespective of the fact whether 60\ndirect recruits have become available or not. The assumption\nmade that the recruitment made in a given year from both the\nsources would furnish information about the vacancies in a\nyear would lead to a rather unfair conclusion inasmuch as\nthe action of the Government in acting in a certain manner\nwithout due regard to the quota rule would work hardship on\nappointees even though on a correct calculation of vacancies\nthe appointments may be valid and legal. [850 C-E]\n 4 The Government understood the mandamus issued in Jai\nSinghani's case as covering, the whole period from 1951 to\n1967. When this was questioned in the First Gupta's case\nthis Court held that the quota rule proprio vigme operated\nbetween 1951 to 1956 and if there were promotions in any\nyear in excess of the quota. those promotions were merely\ninvalid for that year but they were not invalid for all time\nand they could be regularised by being absorbed in the quota\nfor the later years. So adjusting the quota at any rate np\nto 1956, the quota rule on its own strength evaporated\nbecause it was to be in operation for a period of five years\nand no fresh quota rule was issued by the Government.\nTherefore, after 1956 Rule 4 remained in force in' all its r\nignore and was not hedged in by any quota. Rule 4 permitted\nthe Government to make recruitment from either source\nwithout fettering its discretion by any quota rule which it\nwas not bound to prescribe. On January 16, 1959 Government\nhl the Ministry of Finance informed the Commissioner of\nIncome tax that the resident had sanctioned the upgrading to\nClass I of one hundred temporary posts of Income-Tax\nofficers Class II. On December 19, 1960 there was further\nupgrading of 114 posts from Class II to Class I. Between\n1959 and 1962 these 214 posts were filled in by promotees.\nNow in the First Gupta's case, this Court held even though\nthe quota expired in 1956 yet the Government of India\nadopted it as a guideline. May be it may be so. But, it\ncannot be said that. any appointment in breach of the\nguideline neither statutory nor even having the fragrance of\nany executive instruction becomes invalid more so, when the\nGovernment had power to make appointment from either source\nuninhibited by any quota rule under Rule 4. Yet the Court\nfound that between 1956 and 1959 when one hundred posts came\nto be upgraded there was a spill-over of 73 persons and\nbecause of the huge departure from guidelines the weightage\nrule giving seniority to the promotees by 2 to 3 years was\ncrushed under its own debris. Again, Rule 4 is overlooked or\nby-passed when saying that. there was a spill-over of 73\npromotees between 1956 and 1959, nor could it be said that\nthe upgrading of 214 posts and filling them up by promotees\nwould be in any way even irregular much less invalid because\nRule t enables the Government to draw from either source.\n[851 A-G]\n 5. In the Second Gupta's case in view of the decision\nin the First Gupta's case, a fresh seniority rule was\nprepared and it was made retroactive from January 16, 1959.\nlt, inter alia, provides that the relative seniority amongst\nthe promotees and the direct recruits shall be in the ratio\nof 1: 1 and the same shall be so determined and regulated in\naccordance with a roster main-\n821\ntained for this purpose which shall follow the following\nsequence, namely, promotee; direct recruit, promotee; direct\nrecruit etc. This method of roster undoubtedly introduces a\nquota by the back door. Once a roster is introduced promotee\ndirect recruit, promotee direct recruit etc. even if some\npromotees have come in a bulk and if at a later date some\ndirect recruits are appointed in bulk while preparing roster\nan earlier date-promotee will have to yield his place to a\nlater date direct recruit. Bluntly translated it means that\nthe direct recruit who was never in service when promotee\nwas promoted probably he may be a student, he may not have\neven passed the competitive examination, yet he may come\ninto the picture challenge one who has already been serving\nin the department for a number of years. To illustrate in\nthe new seniority list prepared by the Government pursuant\nto the order made by this Court in the First Gupta's case\nand upheld by this Court in the Second Gupta's case a\npromotee of 1962 will have to yield his place to a direct\nrecruit of 1966. [851 G-H, 852 A-D] C\n 6. Service jurisprudence hardly permits a situation\nwhere a man not in service comes and challenges something\nwhich has been done much before he came into service and\ngets such an advantage which on the face of it appear to be\nunfair. But apart from this, even in 1959 there was no quota\nrule and assuming that the old service rule giving weightage\nto the promotees crushed under weight of large number of\npromotees being promoted it would not be open to the\nGovernment to so prepare a fresh seniority list which cannot\nbe given effect to unless a roster is introduced which\nintroduces quota by the back door and which is so unfair in\nits operation that promotees of 1962 will have to yield\nplace to direct recruits of 1966. Under the old weightage\nrule promotees were given weightage for service of 2 to 3\nyears over direct recruits because direct recruits were\nunable to undertake regular assessment work for a period of\n2 to 3 years when they were more or less under training\nwhile promotees have been doing this work for a number of\nyears and whose experience is reflected in the weightage.\nThe whole thing now appears to be in the reverse gear in\nthat an uninitiated direct recruit takes precedence over an\nexperienced promotee. The unfairness of the new rule is writ\nlarge on the face of the record. [852 E-H]\n 7. The fresh seniority rule violates another important\nrule well-recognised principle in the service jurisprudence\nthat in the absence of any valid rule of seniority date of\ncontinuous officiation provides a valid rule of seniority.\nThis rule is completely crucified upon two unsustainable\nassumptions that a quota rule having guideline sanction is\nmade imperative in character and assumed to be in force\nbetween 1956 and 1959, and that even though Government in\nexercise of power conferred by Rule 4 for its own necessity\npromoted 214 promotees to the upgraded post, yet they must\nyield to some future direct recruits who may come to the\ndepartment at a later date. This Court sustained the\ndecision holding that these were ad hoc appointments and\nthere are no regular posts for these promotees. This\napproach wholly overlooks the fact and the force of Rule 4.\n[853 A-C]\n 8. Certainty and continuity demand that this Court\nshould not reopen settled decisions or reopen closed\nquestions unless under compelling necessity. It may he that\nthe fact of Income-Tax officers promotees and direct\nrecruits may rest with the three decisions of this Court.\nUnfairness to some of them H may itself not provide a good\nand compelling reason for reopening and reconsidering the\ndecisions. [853 C-D]\n822\n Jai Singhani and the Two Gupta cases are being quoted,\ntimes without number before this Court for the principles\nenunciated therein. These decisions, therefore, affected\nsubsequent decisions of this Court as well as the High\ncourts and\n some of the principles\nenunciated in these three cases stand in sharp contrast to\nother decisions of this Court and in fact this Court itself\nfelt it necessary to warn that it may become necessary to\nreconcile these conflicting decisions. The three decisions\nare incorrect in the light of the materials now placed,\nespecially the files which were withheld from the Court and\nthe Committee. A strong case has been made out for\nreconsideration of these decisions [853 E-F, 854 C-D]\n N. D. Chauhan & Ors. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n[1977] 1 S.C.R. 1037 and 1053 referred to."

One of the reasons which the Court gave in support of\nthis conclusion was that when the quota rule referred to\nvacancies, it was implicit that the vacancies are those\nwhich the Government wanted to fill up, whatever may be the\nactual number of vacancies available for being filled up.\nThus, if in the year 1953, 53 posts were filled by direct\nrecruits and 38 by promotees, the total number of vacancies\nwhich were intended by the Government to be filled in would\nbe 91.

So\nadjusting the quota at any rate upto 1956, the quota rule on\nits own strength evaporated because it was to be in\noperation for a period of five years and no fresh quota rule\nwas issued by the Government. Therefore, after 1956 rule 4\nremained in force in all its rigour and was not hedged in by\nany quota. Rule 4 permitted the Government to make\nrecruitment from either source without lettering its\ndiscretion by any quota rule which it was not bound to\nprescribe. On January 16, 1959, Government in the ministry\nof Finance informed the commissioners of Income tax that the\nPresident had sanctioned the upgrading to class I of 100\ntemporary Posts of Income Tax officers, Class II. On\nDecember 19, 1960, there was further upgrading of 114 posts\nfrom class II to class I. Between 1959 and 1962 these 214\nposts were filled in by promotes.\n \nNow, in the \nIst Gupta\n case\nthis court held that even though the quota rule expired in\n1956, yet the Government of India adopted it as a guideline.\nMay be, it may be so. Does any appointment in breach of the\nguideline neither statutory nor even having the fragrance of\nany executive instruction become invalid more so when the\nGovernment had power to make appointment from either source\nuninhibited by any quota rule under rule 4 ? Yet the Court\nfound that between 1956 and 1959 when 100 pasts came to be\nupgraded there was a spillover of 73 persons and because of\nthe huge departure from guidelines the weightage rule giving\nseniority to the promotes by 2- 3- years was crushed under\nits own debris. Again, with respect it must be confessed\nthat rule 4 is overlooked or bypassed when saying that there\nwas a spillover of 73 promotes between 1956 and 1959. Nor\ncould it be said that the upgrading of 214 posts and filling\nthem up by promotes would be in any way even irregular much\nless invalid because rule 4 enables Government to draw from\neither source."

      "text": "This method of roster undoubtedly introduces a quota by\nthe back door. Once a roster is introduced Promote direct\nrecruit, Promote direct recruit etc. even if some promotes\nhave come in a bulk and if at a later date some direct\nrecruits are appointed in bulk, while preparing roster an\nearlier date promote will have to yield his place to a later\ndate direct recruit. Bluntly translated it means that the\ndirect recruit who was never in service when promote was\npromoted, probably he may be a student. May be he may not\nhave even passed the competitive examination, yet he may\ncome into the picture and challenge one who has already been\nserving in the Department for a number of years. To\nillustrate, in the new seniority list prepared by the\nGovernment pursuant to the order made by this Court in the\n1st \nGupta\n case and upheld by this Court in 2nd \nGupta\n case a\npromote of 1962 will have to yield his place to a direct\nrecruit of 1966. With utmost hesitation I must say that\nservice jurisprudence hardly permits a situation where a man\nnot in service comes and challenges some thing which has\nbeen done much before he came in to service and gets such an\nadvantage which on the face of it appears to be unfair. But\napart from this, even in 1959 there was no quota rule and\nassuming that the old service rule giving weightage to the\npromotes crushed under that weight of large number of\npromotes being promoted, it would not be open to the\nGovernment to so prepare a fresh seniority list which cannot\nbe given effect to unless a roster is introduced which\nintroduces quota by the back door and which is so unfair in\nits operation that promotes of 1962 will have to yield place\nto direct recruits of 1966. Now under the old weightage rule\npromotes were given a weightage for service of 2-3 years\nover direct recruits because direct recruits were unable to\nundertake regular assessment work for a period of 2-3 years\nwhen they were more or less under training while promotes\nhave been doing this work for a number of years and their\nexperience is rejected in the weightage. The whole thing now\nappears in the reverse gear in that an uninitiated direct\nrecruit takes precedence over an experienced promote.\n The\nunfairness of the new rule is writ large on the face of it."

This Court sustained the position holding\nthat these were ad hoc appointments, and there were no\nregular posts for those promotees.
