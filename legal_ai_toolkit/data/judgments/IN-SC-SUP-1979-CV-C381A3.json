It started its business in 1960, went\ninto production since 1964 and waggled from infancy to\nadulthood with smiling profits and growling workers,\npunctuated by smouldering demands, strikes and settlement\nuntil there brewed a confrontation culminating in a head-on\ncollision following upon certain unhappy happenings. A total\nstrike ensued whose chain reaction was a whole-sale\ntermination of all employees followed by fresh recruitment\nof workmen defacto breakdown of the strike and dispute over\nrestoration of the removed workmen.\nAs per the last settlement between the management and\nthe workmen of 4th August, 1972, it was not open to the\nworkmen to resort to a strike till the expiry of a period of\nfive years; nor could the management declare a lock out till\nthen. Any dispute arising between the parties, according to\nthe terms arrived at were to be sorted out through\nnegotiation or, failing that by recourse to arbitration. The\nmatter was therefore, referred to an arbitrator and the\narbitrator by his award held the action cf the management\nwarranted. The respondent challenged the decision of the\narbitrator under Article 226/227 of the Constitution and the\nHigh Court of Gujarat reversed the award and substantially\ndirected reinstatement. Hence the appeals both by the\nManagement and the workmen.\nDismissing the appeals and modifying the awards\nsubstantially, the Court\n^\nHELD: (By Majority)\nPer Iyer J. On behalf of D. A. Desai J. and himself.\n(i) The basic assumption is that the strike was not\nonly illegal but also unjustified. [210 H]\n(ii) The management did punish its 853 workmen when it\ndischarged them for reasons of misconduct set out in\nseparate but integrated proceedings; even though with legal\nfinesse, the formal order was phrased in harmless verbalism.\n[211 A]\n(iii) The action taken under the general law or the\nstanding orders, was illegal in the absence of\nindividualised charge sheets, proper hearing and personalise\npunishment if found guilty. None of these steps having been\ntaken, the discharge orders were still born. But, the\nmanagement could, as in this case it did, offer to make out\nthe delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had, in\nsuch cases, the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both\nguilt and punishment. [211 B-C]\n(iv)\nSection 11A\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947\ndoes take in an arbitrator too, and in this case, the\narbitral reference, apart from\nsection 11A\nis plenary in\nscope. [211 C-D]\n(v)\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, however\nrestrictive in practice Is a power wide enough in all\nconscience, to be a friend in need when the summons comes in\na crisis from a victim of injustice; and more importantly\nthis extra-ordinary reserve power is unsheathed to grant\nfinal relief without necessary recourse to a remand. What\nthe Tribunal may in its discretion do the High Court too\nunder\nArticle 226\n, can, if facts compel so. [211 D-E]\n(vi) The Award, in the instant case, suffers from a\nfundamental flaw that it equates an illegal and unjustified\nstrike with brozen misconduct by every workman without so\nmuch as identification of the charge against each, after\nadverting to the gravamen of his misconduct meriting\ndismissal. Passive participation in a strike which is both\nillegal and unjustified does not ipso facto invite dismissal\nor punitive discharge. There must be active individual\nexcess such as master-minding the unjustified aspects of the\nstrike, e.g., violence, sabotage or other reprehensible\nrole. Absent such gravamen in the accusation, the extreme\neconomic penalty of discharge is wrong. An indicator of the\nabsence of such grievous guilt is that the management, after\nstating in strong terms all the sins of workmen, took back\nover 400 of them as they trickled back slowly and beyond the\ntime set, with continuity of service, suggestive of the\ndubiety of the inflated accusations and awareness of the\nminor role of the mass of workmen in the lingering strike.\nFurthermore, even though all sanctions short of punitive\ndischarge may be employed by a Management, low wages and\nhigh cost of living, dismissal of several hundreds with\ndisastrous impact on numerous families is of such sensitive\nsocial concern that, save in exceptional situations, the law\nwill inhibit such a lethal step for the peace of the\nindustry, the welfare of the workmen and the broader justice\nthat transcends transcient disputes. The human dimensions\nhave decisional relevance. The discharge orders though\napproved by the Arbitrator are invalid. [211 E-H, 212 A-B]\nHELD FURTHER: 1. In a society, capital shall be the\nbrother and keeper of labour and cannot disown this\nobligation of a partner in management, especially because\nsocial justice and\nArticles 43\nand\n43A\nare constitutional\nmandates. The policy directions in\nArticles 39\n, 41\n, 42\n, 43\n\nand\n43A\nspeak af the right to an adequate means of\nlivelihood, the right to work, humane conditions of work,\nliving wages ensuring a decent standard of life and\nenjoyment of leisure and participation of workers in\nmanagement of industries. De hors these\nmandates, law will fail functionally. Suck is the value\nvision of Indian Industrial Jurisprudence. [155 B, G-H, 156\nA]\n2. Jural resolution of labour disputes must be sought\nin the law life complex beyond the factual blinkers of\ndecided cases, beneath the lexical littleness of statutory\ntests, in the economic basics of industrial justice which\nmust enliven the consciousness of the Court and the corpus\njuris. [154 F-G]\nThe golden rule for the judicial resolution of an\nindustrial dispute is first to persuade fighting parties, by\njudicious suggestions, into the peace-making zone,\ndisentangle the differences, narrow the mistrust gap and\nconvert them through consensual steps, into negotiated\njustice. Law is not the last word in justice, especially\nsocial justice. Moreover in an hierarchical system, the\nlittle man lives in the short run but most litigation lives\nin the long run. So it is that negotiation first and\nadjudication next, is a welcome formula for the Bench and\nthe Bar, the Management and Union. [157 C-E]\nThe anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery, once\nit is agreed that substance, not semblance, governs the\ndecision. Legal criteria are not so slippery that verbal\nmanipulations may outwit the Court. The fact is the index of\nthe mind and an order fair on its face may be taken at its\nface value. But there is more to it than that, because\nsometimes words are designed to conceal deeds by linguistic\nengineering. The form of the order of the language in which\nit is couched is not conclusive. The Court will lift the\nveil to see the the nature of the order. [171 G-H. 172 A]\nIf two factors-motive and foundation of the order-co-\nexist, an interference of punishment is reasonable though\nnot inevitable. If the severance of service is effected the\nfirst condition is fulfilled and if the foundation or causa\ncausans of such severance is the servant's misconduct, the\nsecond is fulfilled. If the basis or foundation for the\norder of termination is clearly not turpitudes or stigmatic\nor rooted in misconduct or visited with evil pecuniary\neffects, then the inference of dismissal stands negated and\nvice versa. These canons run right through the disciplinary\nbranch of master and servant jurisprudence, both under\n\nArticle 311\nand in other cases including workmen under\nmanagements. The law cannot be stultified by verbal\nhaberdashery because the Court will lift the mask and\ndiscover the true face. [172 C-E]\nMasters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide\nand seek with the law of dismissals and the plain and proper\ncriteria are not to be misdirected by terminological cover-\nups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be grounded\non the substantive reason for the order, whether disclosed\nor undisclosed. The Court will find out from other\nproceedings or documents connected with the formal order of\ntermination what the true ground for the termination is. If\nthus scrutinised the; order has a punitive flavour in cause\nor consequence, it is dismissal. If it falls short of this\ntest, it cannot be called a punishment. A termination\neffected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct\nand of the consequent desirability of terminating the\nservice of the delinquent servant, it is a dismissal even if\nhe had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order\nunder the standing order or otherwise. Whether, in such a\ncase the grounds are recorded in a different proceeding from\nthe formal order does not detract from its nature. Nor the\nfact that, after being satisfied of the guilt, the master\nabandons the enquiry and proceeds to terminate. Given\nan alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the\ntermination of service the conclusion is dismissal, even if\nfull benefits as on simple termination are given and non-\ninjurious terminology is used. [173 E-H, 174 A]\nOn the contrary, even if there is suspicion of\nmisconduct, the master may say that he does not wish to\nbother about it and may not go into his guilt but may feel\nlike not keeping a man he is not happy with. He may not like\nto investigate nor take the risk of continuing a dubious\nservant. There it is not n dismissal, but termination\nsimpliciter, if no injurious record of reasons or punitive\npecuniary cut back on his full terminal benefits is found.\nFor, in fact, misconduct is not then the moving factor in\nthe discharge, What is decisive is the plain reason for the\ndischarge, not the strategy of a non-enquiry or clever\navoidance of stigmatising epithets. If the basis is not\nmisconduct, the order is saved.\n[174 B-D]\nManagement of Murugan Mills v. Industrial Tribunal\n[1965] 2 SCR 148; Chartered Bank v.

P.S.\nMalvankar, [1978] 3 SCR 1000; referred to.\nEvery wrong order cannot be righted merely because it\nwas wrong. It can be quashed only if it is vitiated by the\nfundamental flaws of gross miscarriage of justice, absence\nof legal evidence, perverse misreading of facts, serious\nerrors of law on the face of the order, jurisdictional\nfailure and the like. [182 P-G]\nWhile the remedy under\nArt. 226\nis extraordinary and is\nof Anglosaxon vintage, it is not a carbon copy of English\nprocesses.\nArticle 226\nis a sparing surgery but the lancet\noperates where injustice suppurates. While traditional\nrestraints like availability of alternative remedy hold back\nthe Court, and judicial power should not ordinarily rush in\nwhere the other two branches fear to tread. judicial daring\nis not daunted where glaring injustice demands even\naffirmative action. The wide words of\nArticle 226\nare\ndesigned for service of the lowly numbers in their\ngrievances if the subject belongs to the Court's province\nand the remedy is appropriate to the judicial process. There\nis a native hue about\narticle 226\n, without being anglophilic\nor anglophobic in attitude. Viewed from this jurisprudential\nperspective the Court should be cautious both in not over\nstepping as if\nArticle 226\nwere as large as an appeal and\nnot failing to intervene where a grave error has crept in.\nAnd an appellate power interferes not when the order\nappealed is not right but only when it is dearly wrong. The\ndifference is real, though fine. [182 G-H, 183 A-B]\nThe principle of law is that the jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is limited\nto holding the judicial or quasi judicial powers within the\nleading sings of legality and to see that they do not exceed\ntheir statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer the\nlaw laid down by the statute under the Act. So long as the\nhierarchy of officers and appellate authorities created by\nthe statute function within their ambit the manner in which\nthey do so can be no ground for interference. The power of\njudicial supervision of the High Court under\nArticle 227\nof\ntho Constitution (as it then stood) is not\ngreater than those under\nArticle 226\nand it must be limited\nto seeing that a tribunal functions within the limits of its\nauthority. The writ power is large, given illegality and\ninjustice even if its use is severely disciplinary. The\namended\nArticle 226\nwould enable the High Court to interfere\nwith an Award of the industrial adjudicator if that is based\non a complete misconception of law or it is based on no\nevidence, or that no reasonable man would come to the\nconclusion to which the Arbitrator has arrived.

A tribunal literally means a\nseat of justice, may be, a commission, a Court or other\nadjudicatory organ created by the State. All these are\ntribunal and naturally the import of the word, in\nSection\n2(r)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, embraces an arbitration\ntribunal. [188 E-F-H 189 A]\nDawking v. Rokely, L.R. 8 Q.B. 255; quoted with\napproval.\nAn Arbitrator has all the powers under the terms of\nreference, to which both sides are party, confer. In the\ninstant case, the Arbitrator had the authority to\ninvestigate into the propriety of the discharge and the\nveracity of the mis conduct. Even if\nsection 11A\nof the\nIndustrial Disputes Act is not applicable, an Arbitrator\nunder\nSection 10A\nis bound to act in the spirit of the\nlegislation under which he is to function. A commercial\nArbitrator who derives his jurisdiction from the terms of\nreference will by necessary implication be bound to decide\naccording to law and when one says \"according to law\", it\nonly means existing law and the law laid down by the Supreme\nCourt being the law of land, an Arbitrator under\nsection 10A\n\nwill have to decide keeping in view the spirit of\nsection\n11A\n. [196 B-D]\nUnion of India v. Bungo Steel Furniture (P) Ltd. [1967]\n1 SCR 324; referred to.\nPer Koshal J. (Contra)\n1. The orders of discharge could not be regarded as\norders of their dismissal and were on the other hand, orders\nof discharge simpliciter properly passed under Model\nStanding order 23. [235 C-D]\n(a) Clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.O. 25 speak of an\ninquiry only in the case of an order falling under sub-\nclause (g) of clause (1) of that M.S.O. The only sub clause\nof clause (1) of M.S.O. 25 to which the provisions of\nclauses (3) and (4) of that M.S.O. would be attracted is sub\nclause (g) and if an order of discharge falls under M.S.O.\n23, an inquiry under clauses (3) and\n(4) of M.S.O. 25 would not be a pre-requisite thereto even\nthough such an a older is mentioned in sub-clause (f) clause\n(1) of that M.S.O. [222 H, 223 A]\n(b) Under M.S.O.s. 23 and 25, the Management has the\npowers to effect termination of the services of an employee\nby having recourse to either or them. In action taken under\nM.S.O. 23, no element of punishment is involved and the\ndischarge is a discharge simpliciter; and that is why no\nopportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against\nthe termination is provided for. Dismissal, however, which\nan employer may order is in its very nature, a punishment,\nthe infliction of which therefore has been made subject to\nthe result of an inquiry (having the semblance of a trial in\na criminal proceeding). Exercise of each of the two powers\nhas the effect of the termination of the services of the\nconcerned employee but must be regarded, because of the\nmanner in which each has been dealt with by the M.S.O. as\nseparate and distinct from the other. [223 C-E]\n(c) To contend that once it was proved that the order\nof discharge of a workman was passed by reason of a\nmisconduct attributed to him by the management, the order\ncannot but amount to an order of dismissal is wrong for two\nreasons. For one thing, clause (1) of M.S.O. 25 specifically\nstates in sub-clauses (f) that a workman guilty of\nmisconduct may be discharged under M.S.O. 23. This clearly\nmeans that when the employer is satisfied that a workman has\nbeen guilty of misconduct he may [apart from visiting the\nworkman with any of the punishments specified in sub-clauses\n(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25]\neither pass against him an order of discharge for which no\ninquiry precedent as, provided for in clauses (3) and (4) of\nM.S.O. 25 would be necessary, or may dismiss him after\nholding such an inquiry which of the two kinds of order, the\nemployer shall pass is left entirely to his discretion. [223\nE-H]\nIt is true that the employer cannot pass a real order\nof dismissal in the garb of one of discharge. But that only\nmeans that if the order of termination of services of an\nemployee is in reality intended to push an employee and not\nmerely to get rid of him because he is considered useless,\ninconvenient or troublesome, the order even though specified\nto be an order of dismissal covered by sub clause (g) of\nclause (1) of M.S.O. 25. On the other hand if no such\nintention is made out the order would remain one of\ndischarge simpliciter even though it has been passed for the\nsole reason that a misconduct is imputed to the employee.\nThat is how M.S.Os. 23 and 25 have to be interpreted. M.S.O.\n25 specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid\nof \"a workman guilty of misconduct' by passing an order of\nhis discharge under M.S.O. 23. [224 A-D]\nSecondly, the reasons for the termination of service of\na permanent workman under M.S.O. 23 have to be recorded in\nwriting and communicated to him if he so desires, under\nclause (4-A) thereof. Such reasons must obviously consist of\nan opinion derogatory to the workman in relation to the\nperformance of his duties, and whether such reasons consist\nof negligence, work shirking or of serious overt acts like\ntheft or embezzlement, they would in and case amount to\nmisconduct for which he may be punished under M.S.O. 25.\nThere being no case in which such reasons would not amount\nto misconduct, the result is that M.S.O. 23 would be render\notiose if termination of service thereunder for misconduct\ncould be regarded as a dismissal and such a result strikes\nat the very root of accepted canons of interpretation. If it\nwas open to the Court to. \"lift\nthe veil\" and to hold an order of discharge to amount to\ndismissal merely because the motive behind it was a\nmisconduct attributed to the employee, the services of an\nemployee could be terminated without holding against him an\ninquiry such as is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) of\nM.S.O. 25. [224 D-G]\nBombay Corporation v. Malvankar [1978] 3 SCR 1000;\napplied.\nMerely because it is the reason which weighed with the\nemployer in effective the termination of services would not\nmale the order of such termination as one founded on\nmisconduct, for such a proposition would run counter to the\nplain meaning of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25. For an order to be\n\"founded\" an misconduct, it must be intended to have been\npassed by way of punishment, that is, it must be intended to\nchastise, or cause pain in body or mind or harm or loss in\nreputation or money to the concerned worker. If such an\nintention cannot be spelled out of the prevailing\ncircumstances, the order of discharge or the reasons for\nwhich it was ostensibly passed, it cannot be regarded as an\norder of dismissal. Such would be the case when the employer\norders discharge or the interests of the factory or of the\ngeneral body of workers. [226 A-C]\nChartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank Employees\nUnion, [1960] 3 SCR 441; The Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. [1964]\n2 SCR p. 123; The Tara Engineering and Locomotives Co. Ltd.\nv. S.C. Prasad, [1969] 3 S.C.C. 372; Workmen of Sudder\nOffice, Cinnamore v. Management, [1970] 2 L.L.J. 620\nfollowed.\nThe real criterion which formed the touchstone of a\ntest to determine whether an order of termination of\nservices is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to\ndismissal is the real nature of the order, that is, the\nintention with which it was passed. If the intention was to\npunish, that is to chastise, the order may be regarded as an\norder of dismissal; and for judging the intention, the\nquestion of mala fides (which is the same thing as\ncolourable exercise of power) becomes all important. If no\nmala fides can be attributed to the management, the order of\ndischarge must be regarded as one having been passed under\nM.S.O. 23 even though the reason for its passage is serious\nmisconduct.\n(2) The arbitrator could not exercise tho power\nconferred on a Tribunal under\nsection 11A\nof the 1947 Act\nand could not therefore interfere with the punishment\nawarded by the Management to the workmen (even if the\ndischarge could be regarded a punishment). [235 D-E]\nThroughout the I.D. Act, while 'arbitrator' would\ninclude an umpire, a Tribunal would not include an\narbitrator but would mean only an Industrial Tribunal\nconstituted under the Act unless the context makes it\nnecessary to give the word a different connotation. In sub\nsection (1) of\nsection 11\n, the word 'Tribunal' has been used\nin accordance with the definition appearing in clause (r)\n\nsection 2\nbecause an arbitrator is separately mentioned in\nthat sub-section. In sub-sections (2) and (3) of that\nsection a Board, a Labour Court, a Tribunal and a National\nTribunal have been invested with certain powers. A Tribunal\nas contemplated by sub-sections (2) and (3) then, would not\ninclude an arbitrator. [233 A-B]\nIt is a well settled canon of interpretation of\nstatutes that the language used by the Legislature must be\nregarded as the only source of its intention unless such\nlanguage is ambiguous, in which situation the Preamble to\nthe Act, the statement of objects of and Reasons for\nbringing it on the statute book and\nthe purpose underlying the legislation may be taken into\nconsideration for ascertaining such intention. That the\npurpose of the legislation is to fulfil a socio-economic\nneed, or the express object underlying it does not come into\nthe picture till an ambiguity is detected in the language\nand the Court must steer clear of the temptation to mould\nthe written word according to its own concept of what should\nhave been enacted. It is thus not permissible for the\nSupreme Court to take the statements of objects and Reasons\nor the purpose underlying the enactment into consideration,\nwhile interpreting\nsection 11A\nof the I.D. Act. [231 F-G,\n234 Cl\n3. The High Court exceeded the limits of its\njurisdiction in interfering with the said punishment, in the\ninstant case, purporting to act in the exercise of its\npowers under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India. [235\nE-F]\nThe High Court, while discharging its functions as\nenvisaged by that Article, does not sit as a Court of Appeal\nover the Award of the Arbitrator but exercises limited\njurisdiction which extends only to seeing that the\narbitrator has functioned within the scope of his legal\nauthority. In this view of the matter it was not open to the\nHigh Court to revise the punishment (if the discharge is\nregarded as such) meted out by the Management to the\ndelinquent workmen and left intact by the arbitrator whose\nauthority in doing so has not been shown to have been\nexercised beyond the limits of his jurisdiction.

This industry, started in 1960, went into\nproduction since 1964 and waggled from infancy to adulthood\nwith smiling profits and growing workers, punctuated by\nsmouldering demand, strikes and settlements, until there\nbrewed a confrontation culminating in a head-on collision\nfollowing upon certain unhappy happenings.

This cataclysmic episode\nand its sequel formed the basis of a\nSection 10A\narbitration\nand award, a writ petition and judgment, inevitably\nspiralling up to this Court in two appeals one by the\nManagement and the other by the Union-which have been heard\ntogether and are being disposed of by this common judgment.\nThe arbitrator held the action of the Management warranted\nwhile the High Court reversed the Award and substantially\ndirected reinstatement.\n\nThe Judge Perspective\nA few fundamental issues, factual and legal, on which\nbitter controversy raged at the bar, settle the decisional\nfate of this case. A plethora of precedents has been cited\nand volumes of evidence read for our consideration by both\nsides. But the jural resolution of labour disputes must be\nsought in the law-life complex, beyond the factual blinkers\nof decided cases, beneath the lexical littleness of\nstatutory texts, in the economic basics of industrial\njustice which must enliven the consciousness of the court\nand the corpus juris. This Court has developed Labour Law on\nthis road basis and what this Court has declared holds good\nfor the country. We must first fix the founding faith in\nthis juristic branch before unravelling the details of the\nparticular case.\n\nViewing from this vantage point, it is relevant to note\nthat the ethical roots of jurisprudence, with economic\novertones, are the clan vital of any country's legal system.\nSo it is that we begin with two quotations-one from the old\nTestament and the other from Gandhiji, the Indian New\nTestament-as perspective-setters. After all,\nindustrial law must set the moral-legal norms for the modus\nvivendi between the partners in management, namely, Capital\nand Labour. Cain reported, when asked by God about his\nbrother Abel, in the Old Testament: 'Am I my brother's\nkeeper ?', 'Yes' was the implicit answer in God's curse of\nCain. In the fraternal economics of national production,\nworker is partner in this biblical spirit. In our society,\nCapital shall be the brother and keeper of Labour and cannot\ndisown this obligation, especially because Social Justice\nand\nArticles 43\nand\n43A\nare constitutional mandates.\n\nGandhiji, to whom the Arbitrator has adverted in\npassing in his award, way back in March 1946, wrote on\nCapitalism and Strikes h the Harijan:\n\n\"How should capital behave when labour strikes ? This\nquestion is in the air and has great importance at the\npresent moment. One way is that of suppression named or\nnicknamed 'American'. It consists in suppression of labour\nthrough organised goondaism. Everybody would consider this\nas wrong and destructive. The other way, right and\nhonorable, consists in considering every strike on its\nmerits and giving labour its due-not what capital considers\nas due, but what labour itself would so consider and\nenlightened public opinion acclaims as just.\n\nIn my opinion, employers and employed are equal\npartners, even if employees are not considered superior. But\nwhat we see today is the reverse. The reason is that the\nemployers harness intelligence on their side. They have the\nsuperior advantage which concentration of capital brings\nwith it, and they know how to make use of it...... Whilst\ncapital in India is fairly organised, labour is strike in a\nmore or less disorganised condition in spite of Unions and\nFederation. Therefore, it lacks the power that true\ncombination gives.\n\nHence, my advice to the employers would be that should\nwillingly regard workers as the real owners of the concerns\nwhich they fancy they have created.\n\nTuned to these values are the policy directives in\n\nArticles 39\n, 41\n, 42\n, 43\nand\n43A.\nThey speak of the right to\nan adequate means of livelihood, the right to work, humane\nconditions of work, living wage ensuring a decent standard\nof life and enjoyment of leisure and participation of\nworkers in management of industries. De hors these man-\ndates, law will fail functionally. Such is the value-vision\nof Indian Industrial Jurisprudence.\n\nThe Matrix of facts-A Pre-view\nThe nidus of facts which enwomb the issues of law may\nbe elaborated a little more at this stage. In the vicinity\nof Ahmedabad City, the appellant is a prosperous engineering\nenterprise which enjoys entrepreneureal excellence and\nemploys over 800 workmen knit together into the respondent\nUnion called the Gujarat Steel Tubes Mazdoor Sabha (the\nSabha, for short). Fortunately, the industry has had an\ninnings of escalating profits but the workmen have had a\nrunning complaint a raw deal. Frequent demands for better\nconditions, followed by negotiated settlements, have been a\nlovely feature of this establishment, although the poignant\nfact remains that till the dawn of the seventies, the gross\nwages of the workmen have hovered round a harrowing hundred\nrupees or more in this thriving Ahmedabad industry.\n\nThe course of this precarious co-existence was often\nruffled, and there was, now and then, some flare-up leading\nto strike, conciliation and even reference under\nSection 10\n.\nWhen one such reference was pending another unconnected\ndispute arose which, alter some twists and turns, led to an\nindustrial break-down and a total strike. The episodic\nstages of this bitter battle will have to be narrated at\nlength a little later. Suffice it to say that the Management\njettisoned all the 853 workman and recruited some fresher to\ntake their place and to keep the wheels of production\nmoving. In the war of attrition that ensued, labour lost and\ncapitulated to Capital. At long last, between the two, a\nreference to arbitration of the disputes was agreed upon\nunder\nSection 10A\nof the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 (the\nAct, for short). The highlight of the dispute referred for\narbitration was whether the termination orders issued by the\nManagement against the workmen whose names were set out in\nthe annexure to the reference were \"legal, proper and\njustified\"; if not, whether the workmen were 'entitled to\nany reliefs including the relief of reinstatement with\ncontinuity of service and full back wages'. The arbitrator's\ndecision went against the Sabha while, on a challenge under\n\nArticle 226\n, the High Court's judgment virtually vindicated\nits stand. This is the hang of the case. The substantial\nappeal is by the Management while the Sabha has a marginal\nquarrel over a portion of the judgment as disclosed in its\nappeal. The 'jetsam' workmen, a few hundred in number, have\nbeen directed to be reinstated with full or partial back pay\nand this is the bitter bone of contention.\nA stage-by-stage recapitulation of the developments is\nimportant to get to grips with the core controversy.\n\nSri Ashok Sen, for the appellant-Management, and Sri\nTarkunde for the respondent-Sabha, have extensively\npresented their rival versions with forceful erudition. Sri\nR.K. Garg, of course, for some workmen has invoked with\npassion the socialist thrust of the Constitution as a\nsubstantive submission and, as justificatory of the\nworkmen's demands, relied on the glaring contrast between\nthe soaring profits and the sagging wages, while Sri\nBhandare has pressed the lachrymose case of the several\nhundreds of 'interregnal' employees whose removal from\nservice, on reinstatement of the old, might spell iniquity.\n\nOlive Branch Approach: At this stage we must disclose\nan effort at settlement we made with the hearty\nparticipation of Sri Ashok Sen and Sri Tarkunde at the early\nstages of the hearing.\n\nThe golden rule for the judicial resolution of an\nindustrial dispute is first to persuade fighting parties, by\njudicious suggestions, into the peace-making zone,\ndisentangle the differences, narrow the mistrust gap and\nconvert them, through consensual steps, into negotiated\njustice. Law is not the last word in justice, especially\nsocial justice. Moreover, in our hierarchical court system\nthe little man lives in the short run but most litigation\nlives in the long run. So it is that negotiation first and\nadjudication next, is a welcome formula for the Bench and\nthe Bar, Management and Union. This 'olive Branch' approach\nbrought the parties closer in our court and gave use a\nbetter understanding of the problem, although we could not\nclinch a settlement. So we heard the case in depth and felt\nthat some of the legal issues did merit this court's\ndeclaratory pronouncement, settlement or no settlement.\nMercifully, counsel abbreviated their oral arguments into an\neight-day exercise, sparing us the sparring marathon of 28\nlaborious days through which the case stretched out in the\nHigh Court.\n\nOrality ad libitem may be the genius of Victorian era\nadvocacy but in our 'needy' Republic with crowded dockets,\nforensic brevity is a necessity. The Bench and the Bar. must\nfabricate a new shorthand form of court methodology which\nwill do justice to the pockets of the poor who seek right\nand justice and to the limited judicial hours humanly\navailable to the court if the delivery system of justice is\nnot to suffer obsolescence.\n\nThe facts: Back to the central facts. Proof of the\n'efficient' management of the Gujarat Steel Tubes Ltd. is\nafforded by the testimony of larger turnover and profits,\nyear after year, from the beginning down\nto date. The mill was commissioned in January 1964 but by\nthe accounting year 1971-72 the turnover had leapt to Rs.\n560 lakhs. It scaled to Rs. 680 lakhs the next year, to Rs.\n1136 lakhs the year after and to Rs. 20 crores in 1974-75.\nThis enterprise entered the export trade and otherwise\nestablished itself as a premier manufactory in the line.\nSteel shortage is the only shackle which hampers its higher\nproductivity. But its increasing shower of prosperity was a\nsharp contrast, according to Sri Garg, to the share of the\nwage bill. The worker star ted on a magnificent sum per\nmensem of Rs. 100/- in toto even as late as 1970, although\nsome workmen, with more service, were paid some what higher.\nThe extenuatory plea of the Management, justificatory of\nthis parsimony, was that other mill-hands were receiving\nmore niggardly wages in comparable enterprises. Probably,\nunionisation, under these luridly low-paid circumstances,\ncaught on and a workers' union was born somewhere around\n1966. A sensible stroke of enlightened capitalism persuaded\nthe Management to enter into agreements with the Union,\nsomewhat improving emoluments and ameliorating conditions.\nBy 1968, the Sabha, a later union, came into being and\ncommanded the backing of all or most of the mill-hands. By\nMarch 1969, the Sabha presented a charter of demands,\nfollowed by resistance from the Management and strike by the\nworkers. By July 1969, a settlement with the Sabha was\nreached. Agreements relating to the various demands brought\nquiet and respite to the industry although it proved\ntemporary.\n\nA vivid close-up of the sequence and consequence of the\ndramatic and traumatic events culminating in the reference\nto arbitration and the impugned award is essential as\nfactual foundation for the decision of the issues. Even so,\nwe must condense, since labyrinthine details are not needed\nin a third tier judgment. Broad lines with the brush bring\nout the effect, not minute etches which encumber the\npicture.\n\nAn agreement of futuristic import with which we may\nbegin the confrontational chronicle is that of April 1970.\nClause 6 thereof runs thus:\n\n\"Management of the Company agrees to implement\nrecommendations of the Central Wage Board for\nEngineering Industries as and when finally declared and\nall the increments granted to workmen from time to time\nunder this agreement shall be adjusted with those\nrecommendations provided that such adjustment shall not\nadversely affect the wages of workman.\"\n\nThe engineering industry, where India is forging ahead,\nwas apparently exploitative towards labour, and to make\namends for this un-\nhealthy position, the Central Wage Board was appointed in\n1964 although it took six long years to recommend revision\nof wages to be implemented with effect from 1-1-1969.\nMeanwhile, the masses of workers were living 'below the\nbroad line' Saintly patience in such a milieu was too much\nto expect from hungry demands and pressing for the\nrecommendations of the Wage Board to be converted into\nimmediate cash. But, as we will presently unravel, Wage\nBoard expectations' were proving teasing illusions and\npremises of unreality because of non-implementation, viewed\nfrom the Sabha's angle. The Management, on the other hand,\nhad a contrary version which we will briefly consider.\nLuckily, agreed mini-increases in wages were taking place\nduring the years 1970, 1971 and 1972. Likewise, bonus was\nalso the subject of bargain and agreement. But in September\n1971, an allegedly violent episode broke up the truce\nbetween the two, spawned criminal cases against workers, led\nto charges of go-slow tactics and lock-outs and burst into\nsuspension, discharge and dismissal of workmen.\n\nThe crisis was tided over by continued conciliations\nand two settlements. We are not directly concerned with the\ncluster of clauses therein save one. 64 workmen had been\ndischarged or dismissed, of whom half the number were agreed\nto be reinstated. The fate of the other half (32 workers)\nwas left for arbitration by the Industrial Tribunal. The\ndark clouds cleared for a while but the sky turned murky\nover again, although the previous agreement had promised a\nlong spell of normalcy. The Sabha, in October 1972, met and\nresolved to raise demands of which the principal ones were\nnon-implementation of the Wage Board recommendations, bonus\nfor 1971 and wages during the lockout period. The primary\npathology of industrial friction is attitudinal. The\nManagement could have (and, indeed, did, with a new Union)\nsolved these problems had they regarded the Sabha as\npartner, not saboteur. Had the bitter combativeness of the\nSabha been moderated, may be the showdown could have been\naverted.\n\nApportioning blame does not help now, but we refer to\nit here because Sri Ashok Sen, with feeling fury, fell foul\nof the criticism by the High Court that the Management had\nacted improperly in insisting on arbitration, and argued\nthat when parties disagreed, arbitral reference was the only\nanswer and the workers' fanatical rejection of arbitration\nmade no sense We need not delve into the details of the\ncorrespondence relied on by either side to reach the truth.\nFor, the Unions case is that in the prior settlement between\nthe two parties arbitral reference came only after\nnegotiations failed. That was why they\npressed the Management to reason together, avoiding\nwrestling with each other before a slow-moving umpire.\n\nSri Tarkunde, for the Sabha, urged that the workmen\nwere not intransigent but impatient and pleaded for a\nnegotiated settlement since the main point in dispute,\nnamely the implementation of the Central Engineering Wage\nBoard's recommendations, was too plain to admit of\ndifference, given good faith on both sides. We will examine\nthe substance of this submission later but it needs to be\nemphasised that workmen, surviving on starving wages and\nwith notoriously fragile staying power, are in no mood for\nadjudicatory procedures, arbitral or other, if the doors of\nnegotiation are still ajar. The obvious reason for this\nattitude is that the litigative length of the adjudicatory\napparatus, be it the tribunal, the court or the arbitrator,\nis too lethargic and long-winded for workmen without the\nwherewithal to survive and is beset with protracted\nchallenges either by way of appeal upon appeal or in the\nshape of writ petitions and, thereafter, appeals upon\nappeals. The present case illustrates the point. Where\nworkmen on hundred rupees a month demand immediate\nnegotiation the reason is that privations have no patience\nbeyond a point. Now and here, by negotiation, is the shop-\nfloor glamour. In this very matter, although the controversy\nbefore the arbitrator fell within a small compass, he took a\nyear and ninety printed pages to decide, inevitably followed\nby a few Years and hundred and thirty printed pages of\njudgment in the High Court and a longer spell in this Court\nwith slightly lesser length of judgment. Which workman under\nThird World Conditions can withstand this wasting disease\nwhile hunger leaves no option save to do or die ? Raw life,\nnot rigid logic, is the mother of law.\n\nAfter the demands were raised by the Union, the main\nissue being implementation of the Wage Board\nrecommendations, a stream of correspondence, meetings and\ninchoate settlements ensued, but the crucial question, which\nwould have meant 'cash and carry' for the workmen, baffled\nsolution. Do negotiate since the application of the Wage\nBoard recommendations are beyond ambiguity, was the Sabha's\nperemptory plea. We differ; therefore, go to arbitration,\nwas the Management's firm response. A stalemate descended on\nthe scene.\n\nNo breakthrough being visible, the Sabha charged the\nManagement by its letter of January 25, 1973 with breach of\nclause 6 of the Agreement of August 4, 1972 which ran thus:\n\n\"That the parties agree that for a period of 5\nyears from the date of this settlement all disputes\nwill be solved by mutual negotiations or, failing that,\nby joint arbitration under\nSection 10A\nof the I.D. Act, 1947. Neither party shall\ntake any direct action including go-slow, strike and\nlock-out for a period of 5 years from the date of this\nsettlement.\"\n\nVarious aspersions of anti-labour tactics were included in\nthe Sabha's letter but the most money-loaded item was the\ngrievance about the Wage Board recommendations. The temper,\nby now, was tense.\n\nThe Management, on the same day, (January 25, 1973) set\nout its version on the notice board and the High Court's\nsummary of it runs thus .\n\n\"The notice stated that during the course of the\nmeeting with the representatives of the Sabha held on\nJanuary 20, 1973 the Company had expressed its\nwillingness to implement the Wage Board recommendations\naccording to its interpretation on and with effect from\nJanuary 1, 1969 without prejudice to the rights and\ncontentions of the workmen and leaving it open to the\nparties to take the matter to arbitration for\nresolution of the points of dispute. The Sabha,\nhowever, had turned down this suggestion and it came to\nthe notice of the Company that workmen were being\ninstigated by making false representations. The Company\nclarified that on and with effect from January 1, 1972\nevery workman would be entitled to the benefits of Wage\nBoard recommendations, irrespective of whether the\nconcerned workman had put in 240 days attendance.\"\n\nThe Sabha's answer was a strike two days later. This\nevent of January 27 was countered quickly by the Management\nrestating its attitude on the Wage Board recommendations,\nasserting that the strike was illegal and in breach of the\nsettlement of August 4, 1972 and wholly unjustified because\nthe offer of reference to arbitration, negotiations failing,\nhad been spurned by the Sabha. The notice wound up with a\ncommand and a caveat:\n\n\"If the workmen do not immediately resume duty,\nthe Company would not be under any obligation to\ncontinue in service those 32 workmen who have been\ntaken back in service pursuant to the settlement dated\nAugust 4, 1972. Besides, if (the workmen) continue\ncausing loss to the Company from time to time in this\nmanner, the Company will not also be bound to implement\nthe Wage Board, recommendations on and with effect from\nJanuary 1, 1969, which may also be noted. The Company\nhereby withdraws all its proposals unless the Workmen\nwithdraw the strike and resume work within two days.\"\nThis threat was dismissed by the workmen as a brutum\nfulmen and the strike continued. The Management, therefore,\ncame up on the notice board castigating the Sabha with\nirresponsible obduracy in waging an illegal and unjustified\nstrike. A warning of the shape of things to come was given\nin this notice. The High Court has summed it up thus:\n\n\"The Company gave an intimation that in view of\nsuch obstinate attitude on the part of the Sabha and\nthe workmen, it had decided to withdraw its earlier\noffer to implement the Wage Board recommendations on\nand with effect from January 1, 1969 as already\ncautioned in the notice dated January 27, 1973. The\nsaid decision must be taken to have been thereby\ncommunicated to the workmen and Sabha. The notice\nfurther stated that having regard to the obdurate,\nunreasonable and illegal attitude adopted by the\nworkmen and Sabha, the Company had decided to take\ndisciplinary proceedings against the defaulting\nworkmen. In this connection, the attention of the\nworkmen was drawn to the fact that the strike was\nillegal not only because of the terms of the settlement\ndated August 4, 1972 but also because of the pendency\nof the reference relating to reinstatement of 32\nworkmen before the Industrial Court and, that,\ntherefore, the Company was entitled to take\ndisciplinary action against them. Finally, the Company\nappealed to the workmen to withdraw their illegal and\nunjustified strike forthwith and to resume work.\"\n\nThese exercises notwithstanding, the strike raged\nundaunted, the production was paralysed and the Management\nretaliated by an elaborate notice which dilated on its\npreparedness to negotiate or arbitrate and the Sabha's\nunreason in rejecting the gesture and persisting on the war\npath. The stern economic sanction was brought home in a\ncritical paragraph:\n\n\"By this final notice the workmen are informed\nthat they should withdraw the strike and resume work\nbefore Thursday, February 15, 1973. If the workmen\nresume duty accordingly, the management would be still\nwilling to pay salary according to the recommendations\nof the Wage Board on and with effect from January 1,\n1969. Furthermore, the management is ready and willing\nto refer to the arbitration of the Industrial Tribunal\nthe question as to whether the management has\nimplemented the settlement dated August 4, 1972 and all\nother labour problems. In spite of this, if the workmen\ndo not resume duty before Thursday, February 15, 1973.\nthen the Company will terminate the services of all\nworkmen who are on strike and thereafter it will run\nthe\nfactory by employing new workmen. All workmen may take\nnote of this fact.\"\n\nThe count-down thus began. February 15, 1973 arrived,\nand the Management struck the fatal blow of discharging the\nstrikers-all the labour force, 853 strong-and recruiting\nfresh hands and thus work was resumed by February 19, 1973.\n\nThis public notice was allegedly sent to the Sabha and\ncirculated to such workmen as hovered around the factory. It\nis common case that the notice of February 15,1973, was not\nsent to individual workmen but was a signal for action. The\ndrastic consequence of disobedience was spelt out in no\nuncertain terms:\n\n\"The workmen are hereby informed that they should\nresume duty on or before Monday, February 19, 1973\nfailing which the Management will presume that the\nworkmen want to continue their strike and do not wish\nto resume work until their demands as aforesaid are\naccepted by the management.\n\nParallel negotiations were going on even while mailed\nfist manoeuvres were being played up-thanks to the basic\ngoodwill and tradition of dispute settlements that existed\nin this company. Even amidst the clash of arms, bilateral\ndiplomacy has a place in successful industrial relations.\nThe Management and the Sabha allowed the talks to continue\nwhich, at any rate, clarified the area of discord. One thing\nthat stood out of these palavers was that both sides\naffirmed the pre-condition of negotiations before\narbitration over differences although the content, accent\nand connotation of 'negotiations' varied with each side. No\ntangible results flowed from these exercises and the\ninevitable happened on February 21, 1973 when the Management\nblotted out the entire lot of 853 workmen from the roster,\nby separate orders of discharge from service, couched in\nidentical terms. The essential terms read thus :\n\n\"Your services are hereby terminated by giving you\none month's salary in lieu of one month's notice and\naccordingly you are discharged from service.\nYou should collect immediately from the cashier of\nthe factory your one month's notice-pay and due pay,\nleave entitlements and gratuity, if you are entitled to\nthe same. The payment will be made between 12 noon and\n5 p.m.\nIf and when you desire to be employed, you may\napply ill writing to the Company in that behalf and on\nreceipt of the application, a reply will be sent to you\nin the matter.\"\nCasual workmen were issued separate but similar orders.\nThe Management did record its reasons for the action taken,\non February 20, 1973 and forwarded them to the Sabha and to\nthe individual workmen on request. The anatomy of this\nproceeding is of critical importance in deciding the\ncharacter of the action. Was it a harm less farewell to the\nworkmen who were unwilling to rejoin or a condign punishment\nof delinquent workmen ?\n\nThe separate memorandum of Reasons refers to the strike\nas illegal and unjustified and narrates the hostile history\nof assault by workmen of the officers, their go-slow tactics\nand sabotage activities, their contumacious and a host of\nother perversities vindicating the drastic action of\ndetermining the services of all the employees. The\nconcluding portion reads partly stern and partly non-\ncommittal:\n\n\"In the interest of the Company it is decided to\nterminate the services of all the workmen who are on\nillegal and unjustified strike since 27th January,\n1973.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is decided that the\nservices of all the workmen who are on illegal and\nunjustified strike should be terminated by way of\ndischarge simpliciter. These workmen, however, may be\ngiven opportunity to apply for employment in the\nCompany and in case applications are received for\nemployment from such employees, such applications may\nbe considered on their merits later on.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that while arriving at\nthe aforesaid decision to terminate the services of the\nworkmen, various documents, notices, correspondence\nwith the Union and others, records of production, etc.\nhave been considered and therefore the same are treated\nas part of the relevant evidence to come to the\nconclusion as aforesaid.\n\nFINAL CONCLUSION\nThe services of all the workmen who are on illegal\nand unjustified strike since 27-1-1973 should be\nterminated by way of discharge simpliciter and they\nshould be offered all their legal dues immediately.\nThe Administrative Manager is hereby directed to\npass orders on individual workers as per draft\nattached.\n\nWe thus reach the tragic crescendo when the Management\nand the workmen fell apart and all the workmen's services\nwere severed. Whether each of these orders using, in the\ncontemporaneous reasons,\nthe vocabulary of misconduct but, in the formal part, the\nexpression 'discharge simpliciter', should be read softly as\ninnocent termination or sternly as penal action, is one of\nthe principal disputes demanding decision.\n\nWe may as well complete the procession of events before\ntaking up the major controversies decisive of the case. The\ntotal termination of the entire work force of 853 employees\nwas undoubtedly a calamity of the first magnitude in a\ncountry of chronic unemployment and starving wages.\nNevertheless, under certain circumstances, discharge of\nemployees may well be within the powers of the Management\nsubject to the provisions of the Act. With all the strikers\nstruck off the rolls there was for a time the silence of the\ngrave. The conditional invitation to the employees to seek\nde novo employment by fresh applications which would be\nconsidered on their merits, left the workers cold. So the\nfactory remained closed until April 28, 1973 when, with new\nworkers recruited from the open market, production\nrecommenced. Among the militants, the morale which kept the\nstrike going, remained intact but among the others the\npressure to report for employment became strong. Re-\nemployment of discharged workmen began and slowly\nsnowballed, so that by July 31, 1973 a substantial number of\n419 returned to the factory.\n\nThe crack of workman's morale was accelerated by\nescalating reemployment and the Management's restoration of\ncontinuity of service and other benefits for re-employed\nhands. The Employer relied on this gesture as proof of his\nbond fides. Meanwhile, there were exchanges of letters\nbetween and 'trading' of charges against each other. The\nManagement alleged that the strikers were violent and\nprevented loyalists' return while the Sabha was bitter that\ngoondas were hired to break the strike and promote\nblacklegs. These imputations have a familiar ring and their\nimpact on the legality of the discharge of workmen falls for\nconsideration a little later. The stream of events flowed\non. The Sabha protested that the Management was terrorising\nworkmen, exploiting their sagging spirit and illegally\ninsisting on fresh applications for employment while they\nwere in law continuing in services. With more 'old workers'\ntrickling back for work and their discharge orders being\ncancelled, the strike became counter-productive. Many\novertures on both sides were made through letters but this\nepistolary futility failed to end the imbroglio and brought\nno bread. The worker wanted bread, job, and no phyrric\nvictory.\n\nA crescent of hope appeared on the industrial sky. The\nManagement but out a 'final offer' on May 31, 1973, calling\non all workmen\nto rejoin last the remaining vacancies also should be filled\nby fresh recruits. The Sabha responded with readiness to\nsettle and sought some clarifications and assurances. The\nemployer informed :\n\n\"Our offer is open till 10-6-1973. From 11-6-1973\nwe shall recruit new hands to the extent necessary.\nThereafter workers who will not have reported for work\nshall have no chance left for re-employment with us.\nWe repeat that those workers who will report for\nwork will be taken back in employment with continuity\nof their services, that the orders of discharge passed\nagainst them on 21-2-1973 shall be treated as cancelled\nand they will also be paid the difference in wages from\n1969 as per the recommendations of the Wage Board.\"\n\nThe Sabha was willing and wrote back on June 8, 1973\nbut sought details about the attitude of the Management to\nthe many pending demands. Meanwhile, the sands of time were\nrunning out and so the Sabha telegraphed on 9th June that\nthe workers were willing to report for work but were being\nrefused work. They demanded the presence of an impartial\nobserver. The reply by the Management repelled these\ncharges, but there was some thaw in the estrangement, since\nthe time for return to work of the strikers was extended\nupto 16-6-73. An apparent end to a long strike was seemingly\nin sight with the Sabha sore but driven to surrender. On\n13- 6-73 the Sabha Secretary wrote back:\n\n\"This is a further opportunity to you even now to\nshow your bona fides. If you confirm to take all the\nworkmen discharged on 21-2-1973 as stated in your\nvarious letters and to give them intimation and\nreasonable time to join, l will see that your offer is\naccepted by the workmen.\"\n\nHere, at long last, was the Management willing to\n'welcome' back all the former employees and the Sabha\nlimping back to the old wheels of work. Was the curtain\nbeing finally drawn on the feud ? Not so soon, in a world of\nbad blood and bad faith; or may be, new developments make\nold offers obsolete and the expected end proves an illusion.\nAnyway, the victor was the Management and II the vanquished\nthe Sabha and the re-employment offered was watered down. In\nour materialist cosmos, often Might is Right and victory\ndictates morality !\nHot upon the receipt of the Sabha's letter accepting\nthe offer the Management back-tracked or had second thoughts\non full re-employment. For, they replied with a long\ncatalogue of the Sabha's sins, set out the story of\ncompulsion to keep the production going and explained that\nsince new hands had come on the scene full re-employment was\nbeyond them. In its new mood of victorious righteousness,\nthe Management modified the terms of intake of strikers and\nsaddled choosy conditions on such absorption suggestive of\nbreaking the Sabha's solidarity:\n\n\"As on the present working of the Company, the\nCompany, may still need about 250 more workers\nincluding those to be on the casual list as per the\nemployment position prior to the start of the strike.\nYou may, therefore, send to us immediately per\nreturn of post the list of the workers who can and are\nwilling to join duty immediately so as to enable us to\nselect and employ the workmen as per the requirement of\nthe Company. Further, it would also be necessary for\nyou to state in your reply that you have called off the\nstrike and have advised the workers to resume the work\nas otherwise it is not clear from your letter as to\nwhether you are still advocating the continuance of the\nstrike or that you have called off the strike.\nTherefore, unless we have a very definite stand known\nfrom you on this issue, it may not be even now possible\nfor us to enter into any correspondence with you.\nWe may again stress that if your tactics of\nprolonging the issue by correspondence are continued\nthe management would be constrained to fake new\nrecruits and in that case, at a later date it may not\nbe even possible to employ as many workmen as may be\npossible to employ now.\"\n\nNothing is more galling, says Sri Tarkunde, than for a\nUnion which has lost the battle and offered to go back to\nwork to be told that it should further humiliate itself by\nformally declaring the calling off of the strike. Sentiment\napart, the Sabha had agreed to go back, but then the\nManagement cut down the number to be re employed to 250 and,\neven this, on a selective basis. This selection could well\nbe to weed out Union activists or to drive a wedge among the\nUnion members. These sensitive thoughts and hard bargains\nkept the two apart. The Sabha, wounded but not wiped\nout, did not eat the humble pie. The Management, on account\nof the intervening recruitments and injuries inflicted-by\nthe strike, did not budge either.\n\nAt this point we find that out of 853 employees who had\nbeen sacked 419 had wandered back by July 31, leaving 434\nworkmen at flotsam. Their reinstatement became the focus of\nan industrial dispute raised by the Sabha. A few more were\nleft out of this jobless mass, and through the intercession\nof the Commissioner of Labour both sides agreed to resolve\ntheir disagreement by arbitral reference under\nSec. 10A\nof\nthe Act, confining the dispute to reinstatement of 400\nworkmen discharged on February 21 1973. A reference under\n\nSec. 10A\nmaterialised. The 'Labour litigation' began in May\n1975 and becoming 'at each remove a lengthening chain'\nlaboured from deck to deck and is coming to a close,\nhopefully, by this decision. Is legal justice at such\nexpensive length worth the candle or counter-productive of\nsocial justice? Is a streamlined alternative beyond the\ncreative genius of Law India?\n\nAn aside\nAs urgent as an industrial revolution is an industrial\nlaw revolution, if the rule of law were at all to serve as\nsocial engineering. The current forensic process needs\nthorough overhaul because it is over-judicialised and under-\nprofessionalised, lacking in social orientation and shop-\nfloor know-how and, by its sheer slow motion and high price,\ndefects effective and equitable solution leaving both\nManagements and Unions unhappy. If Parliament would heed, we\nstress this need. Industrial Justice desiderates specialised\nprocessual expertise and agencies.\n\nThis factual panorama, omitting a welter of debatable\ndetails and wealth of exciting embellishments, being not\ngermane to the essential issues, leads us to a formulation\nof the decisive questions which alone need engage our\ndiscussion. The Management might have been right in its\nversion or the Sabha might have been wronged as it wails,\nbut an objective assessment of the proven facts and unbiased\napplication of the declared law will yield the broad basis\nfor working out a just and legal solution. Here, it must be\nnoticed that a new Union now exists even though its\nnumerical following is perhaps slender. We are not concerned\nwhether it is the favoured child of the Management, although\nit has received soft treatment in several settlements which\nhave somewhat benefited the whole work force and suggests a\nsyndrome not unfamiliar among some industrial bosses\nallergic to strong unions.\nThe central problem on the answer to which either the\naward of the arbitrator or the judgment of the High Court\ncan be sustained as sound is whether the discharge of the\nworkmen en masse was all innocuous termination or a\ndisciplinary action. If the latter. the High Court's\nreasoning may broadly be invulnerable. Secondly, what has\nbeen mooted before us is a question as to whether the\nevidence before the Arbitrator, even if accepted at its face\nvalue, establishes any misconduct of any discharged workman\nand further whether the misconduct, if any, made out is of\nsuch degree as to warrant punitive discharge. Of course, the\nscope of\nSection 11A\nas including arbitrators, the power of\narbitrators, given sufficiently wide terms of reference, to\nexamine the correctness and propriety of the punishment,\ninter alia, deserve examination. Likewise the rules\nregarding reinstatement, retrenchment, back wages and the\nlike, fall for subsidiary consideration.\n\nPrefatory to this discussion is the appreciation of the\nconstitutional consciousness with regard to Labour Law. The\nConstitution of India is not a non-aligned parchment but a\npartisan of social justice with a direction and destination\nwhich it sets in the Preamble and\nArt. 38\n, and so, when we\nread the evidence, the rulings, the statute and the rival\npleas we must be guided by the value set of the\nConstitution. We not only appraise Industrial Law from this\nperspective in the disputes before us but also realise that\nours is a mixed economy with capitalist mores, only slowly\nwobbling towards a socialist order, notwithstanding Sri\nGarg's thoughts. And, after all ideals apart. 'law can never\nbe higher than the economic order and the cultural\ndevelopment of society brought to pass by that economic\norder'. The new jurisprudence in industrial relations must\nprudently be tuned to the wave-length of our constitutional\nvalues whose emphatic expression is found in a passage\nquoted by Chief Justice Rajamannar of the Madras High Court.\nThe learned judge observed :\n\n\"The doctrine of 'laissez faire' which held sway\nin the world since the time of Adam Smith has\npractically given place to a doctrine which emphasises\nthe duty of the state to interfere in the affairs of\nindividuals in the interests of the social well-being\nof the entire community. As Julian Huxley remarks in\nhis essay on \"Economic Man and Social Man\": \"Many of\nour old ideas must be retranslated, so to speak, into a\nnew language. The democratic idea of freedom, for\ninstance, must lose its nineteenth century meaning of\nindividual liberty in the economic sphere, and become\nadjusted to new conception of social duties and\nresponsibilities.\nWhen a big employer talks about his democratic rights\nto individual freedom, meaning thereby a claim to\nsocially irresponsible control over a huge industrial\nconcern and over the lives of tens of thousands of\nhuman beings whom it happens to employ, he is talking\nin a dying language.\"\n\nHomo economicus can no longer warp the social order.\nEven so the Constitution is ambitiously called socialist but\nrealists will agree that a socialist transformation of the\nlaw of labour relations is a slow though steady judicial\ndesideratum. Until specific legislative mandates emerge from\nParliament the court may mould the old but not make the new\nlaw. 'Interstitially, from the molar to the molecular' is\nthe limited legislative role of the court, as Justice Holmes\nsaid and Mr. Justice Mathew quoted (see [1976] 2 S.C.C. at\np. 343).\n\nThe Core Question\nRight at the forefront falls the issue whether the\norders of discharge are, as contended by Sri Tarkunde, de\nfacto dismissals, punitive in impact and, therefore, liable\nto be voided if the procedural imperatives for such\ndisciplinary action are not complied with, even though\ndraped in silken phrases like 'termination simpliciter'. It\nis common case that none of the processes implicit in\nnatural justice and mandated by the relevant standing orders\nhave been complied with, were we to construe the orders\nimpugned as punishment by way of discharge or dismissal. But\nSri Ashok Sen impressively insists that the orders here are\nsimple terminations with no punitive component, as, on their\nface, the orders read. To interpret otherwise is to deny to\nthe employer the right, not to dismiss but to discharge,\nwhen the law gives him option.\n\nAn analysis of the standing orders in the background of\ndisciplinary jurisprudence is necessitous at this point of\nthe case.\n\nThe Model Standing orders prescribed under\nSection 15\n\nof the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946,\napply to this factory. Order 23, clauses (1) and (4), relate\nto termination of employment of permanent workmen.\nTermination of their services on giving the prescribed\nnotice or wages in lieu of such notice is provided for. But\nclause (4A) requires reasons for such termination of service\nof permanent workmen to be recorded and, if asked for,\ncommunicated. This is obviously intended to discover the\nreal reason for the discharge so that remedies available may\nnot be defeated by clever phraseology of orders of\ntermination. Clause (7) permits the services or non-\npermanent workmen to be terminated without notice\nexcept when such temporary workmen are discharged by way of\npunishment. Punitive discharge is prohibited unless\nopportunity to show-cause against charges of misconduct is\nafforded (Standing order 15). Orders of termination of\nservice have to be by the Manager and in writing and copies\nof orders shall be furnished to the workmen concerned.\nStanding order 24 itemizes the acts and omissions which\namount to misconduct\n\"According to clause (b) of the said Standing\norder, going on an illegal strike or abetting, inciting\ninstigating or acting in furtherance thereof amounts to\nmisconduct. Standing order 25 provides for penalty\nimpossible on a workman guilty of misconduct.\nAccordingly amongst other punishments, a workman could\nbe visited with the penalty of discharge under order 23\nof dismissal without notice for a misconduct [see sub-\nclauses (f) and (g) of clause ( 1 ) j. Clause (3)\nprovides that no order of dismissal under sub clause\n\n(g) of clause (1) shall be made except after holding an\nenquiry against the workman concerned in respect of the\nalleged misconduct in the manner set forth in clause\n(4). Clause (4) provides for giving to the concerned\nworkman a charge-sheet and an opportunity to answer\nthe charge and the right to be defended by a workman\nworking in the same department as himself and\nproduction of witnesses and cross-examination of\nwitnesses on whom the charge rests. Under clause (6),\nin awarding punishment the Manager has to take into\naccount the gravity of the misconduct, the previous\nrecord, if any, of the workman, and any other\nextenuating or aggravating circumstances.\"\nThe finding of the Arbitrator that the workmen went on\na strike which was illegal and in which they had\nparticipated is not disputed. In this background, the\napplication of the procedural imperatives before termination\nof services of the workmen, in the circumstances of the\npresent case, has to be judged. This, in turn, depends on\nthe key finding as to whether the discharge orders issued by\nthe management were punitive or non-penal.\n\nThe anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery, once\nwe agree that substance, not semblance, governs the\ndecision. Legal criteria are not so slippery that verbal\nmanipulations may outwit the court. Broadly stated, the face\nis the index to the mind and an order fair on its face may\nbe taken at its face value. But there is more to it than\nthat, because sometimes words are designed to conceal deeds\nby linguistic engineering. So it is beyond dispute that the\nform of the order or the language in which it is couched is\nnot conclusive. The court will lift the veil to see the true\nnature of the order.\n\nMany situations arise where courts have been puzzled\nbecause the manifest language of the termination order is\nequivocal or misleading and dismissals have been dressed up\nas simple termination. And so, judges have dyed into\ndistinctions between the motive and the foundation of the\norder and a variety of other variations to discover the.\ntrue effect of an order of termination. Rulings are a maze\non this question but, in sum, the conclusion is clear. If\ntwo factors coexist, an inference of punishment is\nreasonable though not inevitable. What arc they ?\n\nIf the severance of service is effected, the first\ncondition is fulfilled and if the foundation or causa\ncausans of such severance is the servant's misconduct the\nsecond is fulfilled. If the basis or foundation for the\norder of termination is clearly not turpitudinous or\nstigmatic or rooted in misconduct or visited with evil\npecuniary effects, then the inference of dismissal stands\nnegated and vice versa. These canons run right through the\ndisciplinary branch of master and servant jurisprudence,\nboth under\nArticle 311\nand in other cases including workmen\nunder managements The law cannot be stultified by verbal\nhaberdashery because the court will lift the mask and\ndiscover the true face. It is true that decisions of this\nCourt and of the, High Courts since Dhingra's case (1958 SCR\n\n828) have been at times obscure. if cited de hors the full\nfacts. In Samsher Singh's case the unsatisfactory state of\nthe law was commented upon by one of us, per Krishna Iyer,\nJ., quoting Dr. Tripathi for support:\n\n\"In some cases, the rule of guidance has been\nstated to be 'the substance of the matter' and the\n'foundation' of the order. When does 'motive' trespass\ninto 'foundation' ? When do we lift the veil of form to\ntouch the 'substance' ? When the Court says so. These\n'Freudian' frontiers obviously fail in the work-a-day\nworld and Dr. Tripathi's observations in this context\nare not without force. He says:\n\n'As already explained, in a situation where the\norder of termination purports to be a mere order of\ndischarge without.\nstating the stigmatizing results of the departmental\nenquiry a Search for the 'substance of the matter'\nwill be indistinguishable from a search for the motive\n(real, unrevealed object) of the order. Failure to\nappreciate this relationship between motive (the real,\nbut unrevealed object) and from (the apparent, or\nofficially revealed object) in the present con text has\nlead to an unreal inter-play of words and phrases\nwherein symbols like 'motive', 'substance' 'form' or\n'direct' parade in different combinations without\ncommunicating precise situations or entities in the\nworld of facts.'\nThe need, in this branch of jurisprudence, is not\nso much to reach perfect justice but to lay down a\nplain test which the administrator and civil servant\ncan understand without subtlety and apply without\ndifficulty. After all, between 'unsuitability' and\n'misconduct' thin partitions do their bounds divide'.\nAnd over the years, in the rulings of this Court the\naccent has shifted, the canons have varied and\npredictability has proved difficult because the play of\nlegal light and shade has been baffling. The learned\nChief Justice has in his judgement, tackled this\nproblem and explained the rule which must govern the\ndetermination of the question as to when termination of\nservice of a probationer can be said to amount to\ndischarge simpliciter and when it can be said to amount\nto punishment so as to attract the inhibition of Art\n\n311.\"\n\nMasters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide\nand seek with. the law of dismissals and the plain and\nproper criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological\ncover-ups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be\ngrounded on the substantive reason for the order, whether\ndisclosed or undisclosed. The Court will find out from other\nproceedings or documents connected with the formal order of\ntermination what the true ground for the termination is. If,\nthus scrutinized, the order has a punitive flavour in cause\nor consequence, it is dismissal. If it falls short of this\ntest, it cannot be called a G punishment. To put it slightly\ndifferently, a termination effected because the master is\nsatisfied of the misconduct and of the consequent\ndesirability of terminating the service of the delinquent\nservant, it is a dismissal, even if he had the right in law\nto terminate with an innocent order under the standing order\nor otherwise. Whether, in such a case the grounds are\nrecorded in a different proceeding from the formal order\ndoes not detract from its nature. Nor the fact that, after\nbeing satisfied of the guilt, the master abandons the\nenquiry and proceeds to\nterminate. Given an alleged misconduct and a live nexus\nbetween it and the termination of service the conclusion is\ndismissal. even if full benefits as on simple termination,\nare given and non-injurious terminology is used.\n\nOn the contrary, even if there is suspicion of\nmisconduct the master may say that he does not wish to\nbother about it and may not go into his guilt but may feel\nlike not keeping a man he is not happy with. He may not like\nto investigate nor take the risk of continuing a dubious\nservant. Then it is not dismissal but termination\nsimpliciter, if no injurious record of reasons or punitive\npecuniary cut-back on his full terminal benefits is found.\nFor, in fact, misconduct is not then the moving factor in\nthe discharge. We need not chase other hypothetical\nsituations here.\n\nWhat is decisive is the plain reason for the discharge.\nnot the strategy of a non-enquiry or clever avoidance of\nstigmatizing epithets. If the basis is not misconduct, the\norder is saved. In Murugan Mills, this Court observed:\n\n\"The right of the employer to terminate the\nservices of his workman under a standing order, like\ncl. 17(a) in the present case, which accounts to a\nclaim \"to hire and fire' an employee as the employer\npleases and thus completely negatives security of\nservice which has been secured to industrial employees\nthrough industrial adjudication. came up for\nconsideration before the Labour Appellate Tribunal in\n\nBuckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. v. Workers of the\nCompany\n.\n\nThe matter then came up before this before\nthis Court also in\nChartered Bank v. Chartered Bank\nEmployees Union\n(\n3) and the Management of U.B. Dutt &\nCo. v. Workmen of U. B. Dutt & Co.\n(4) Wherein the\nview taken by Labour Appellate Tribunal was approved\nand it was held that even in a case like the present\nthe requirements of bona fides was essential and if\nthe termination of service was a colourable exercise of\nthe power or as a result of victimization or unfair\nlabour practice the industrial tribunal would have the\njurisdiction to intervene and set aside such\ntermination. The form of the order in such a case is\nnot conclusive and the Tribunal can go behind the order\nto find the reasons which led to the\norder and then consider for itself whether the\ntermination was a colourable exercise of the power or\nwas a result of victimisation or unfair labour\npractice. If it came to the conclusion that the\ntermination was a colourable exercise of the power or\nwas a result of victimisation or unfair labour\npractice. it would have the jurisdiction to intervene\nand set aside such termination.\"\n\nAgain, in\nChartered Bank v. Employees Union\nhis Court\nemphasised:\n\n\" .... The form of the order of termination is not\nconclusive of the true nature of the order, for it is\npossible that the form may be merely a camouflage for\nan order of misconduct. It is, therefore, always open\nto the Tribunal to go behind the form and look at the\nsubstance and if it comes to the conclusion, for\nexample, that though in form the order amounts to\ntermination simpliciter, it in reality cloaks a\ndismissal for misconduct, it will be open to it to set\nit aside as a colourable exercise of the Power.\"\n\nA rain of rulings merely adds to the volume, not to the\nweight of the proposition, and so we desist from citing all\nof them. A bench of seven judges of this Court considered\nthis precise point in Shamsher Singh's case and Chief\nJustice Ray ruled:\n\n\"The form of the order is not decisive as to\nwhether the order is by way of punishment. Even an\ninnocuously worded order terminating the service may in\nthe facts and circumstances of the case establish that\nan enquiry into allegations of serious and grave\ncharacter of misconduct involving stigma has been made\nin infraction of the provision of\nArticle 311.\nIn such\na case the simplicity of the form of the order will not\ngive any sanctity. That is exactly what has happened in\nthe case of Ishwar Chand Agarwal. The order of\ntermination IS illegal and must he set aside.\"\n\nSimple termination or Punitive Discharge ?\n\nWe must scan the present order of discharge of 853\nworkmen and ask the right questions to decide whether they\nare punishments or innocent terminations. Neither judicial\nnaivete nor managerial ingenuity will put the court off the\ntrack of truth. What. then, are the diagnostic factors in\nthe orders under study ?\n\nAn isolated reading of the formal notices terminating\ntheir services reveals no stigma, no penalty, no\nmisconduct. They have just been told\noff. But the Management admits that as required by the\nStanding orders it has recorded reasons for the discharge.\nThere, several pages of damnatory conduct have been heaped\non the workers collectively accounting for the resort of the\nManagement to the extreme step of discharging the whole lot,\nthere being no alternative. Sri A. K. Sen took us through\nthe various appeals made by the Management, the losses\nsustained. the many offers to negotiate and arbitrate, the\nSabha's deaf obduracy and resort to sudden strike and\nviolent tactics and, worst of all, its attempts to persuade\nthe Central Government to take over the factory as a `sick'\nmill. These ordeals were, described by Sri Ashok Sen\ngraphically to justify the submission that the Management\nhad no choice, caught between Scylla of strike and Charybdis\nof take-over, but to get rid of the strikers and recruit new\nworkers. If the employer did not discharge the strikers they\nwere adamant and would not return to world, and the very\nclosure compelled by the Sabha was being abused by it to\ntell the Central Government that for three months there had\nbeen no production and so the mill qualified to be taken\nover as `sick' under the\nIndustries (Development and\nRegulation) Act\n. If the Management discharged the workers to\nfacilitate fresh recruitment and save the factory from\nstatutory takeover the cry was raised that the action was\ndismissal because an elaborate enquiry was not held. The\nManagement had avoided injury to the workmen, argued Sri\nSen, by merely terminating their services without resort to\ndisciplinary action and recording the uncomplimentary\ngrounds in a separate invisible order. He also underscored\nthe fact that the strike was illegal and unjustified as\nconcurrently held by the Arbitrator and the High Court.\n\nWe agree that industrial law promotes industrial life,\nnot industrial death, Any realism is the soul of legal\ndynamics. Any doctrine that destroys industrial progress\ninterlaced with social justice is lethal juristic and cannot\nbe accepted. Each side has its own version of the role of\nthe other which we must consider before holding either\nguilty. Sri Tarkunde told us the tale of woe of the workmen.\nIn 3 country where the despair of Government is appalling\nunemployment it is a terrible tragedy to put to economic\ndeath 853 workmen. And for what? For insisting that the\npittance of Rs. 100 per month be raised in terms of the\nCentral Wage Board recommendations, as long ago agreed to by\nthe Management but put off by the tantalizing but\ntreacherous offer of arbitration. When the point admitted of\neasy negotiated solution. Arbitration looks nice, but. since\n1969, the hungry families have been yearning for a morsel\nmore, he urged. Blood, toil, sweat and tears for the workers\nand all the profits' and production for the Management, was\nthe industrial irony! Knowing that every arbitral or other\nadjudicatory agency in\nIndia, especially when weak Labour is pitted against strong\nCapital in the sophisticated processual system, consumes\nconsiderable time, the lowly working class is allergic to\nthis dilatory offer of arbitration. They just don't survive\nto eat the fruits. Such was his case.\n\nThe story of violence was also refuted by Sri Tarkunde,\nsince the boot was on the other leg. Goondas were hired by\nthe Management to sabotage the fundamental right to strike\nand with broken hearts several of them surrendered. When, at\nlast, the Sabha agreed to see that all workmen reported for\nwork within the extended time, the Management took to the\ntypical tactics of victimisation of refusing work for all,\nas first offered, and of picking and choosing even for the\n250 vacancies. Moreover, other conditions were put upon the\nSabha calculated to break unionism which those familiar with\ntrade union movements would painfully appreciate. This\ninsult and injury apart, the orders of termination were\npainly dismissals for a series of alleged misconducts which\nwere chronicled in separate proceedings. The formal order\nwas like a decree, the grounds recorded contemporaneously\nwere like the judgment, to use court vocabulary. It was\nobvious that the foundation for the termination was the\ncatena of charges set out by the Management. The true\ncharacter of the order could not be hidden by the unfair\ndevice of keeping a separate record and omitting it from the\nnormal communication. Law is not such an ass as yet and if\nthe intent and effect is damnatory the action is\ndisciplinary.\n\nBetween these two competing cases, presented by\ncounsel, we have to gravitate towards the correct factual-\nlegal conclusion. A number of peripheral controversies have\nbeen omitted from this statement, for brevity's sake. When\ntwo high tribunals have spread out the pros and cons it is\nsupererogation for this Court to essay likewise, and\nminiaturization is a wise husbandry of judicial resources.\nFirst, we must decide whether the order of termination was a\npunitive discharge or a simple discharge.\n\nHere we reach the dilemma of the law for discovering\nunfailing guidelines to distinguish between discharge\nsimpliciter and dismissal sinister. The search for\ninfallible formulae is vain and only pragmatic humanism can\nhelp navigate towards just solutions. We have earlier\nexplained that from Dhingra's case to Shamsher Singh's case,\nthe law has been dithering but some rough and ready rules\ncan be decocted to serve in most situations. Law, in this\narea, is a pragmatist, not a philologist, and we have set\nout the dual diagnostic tests applicable in such cases.\nIt was not retrenchment, according to the Management.\nThen what was it ? If there was work to be done, why\nterminate services of workmen except as punishment ?\nBecause, argued Sri Sen, the workers did not work, being on\nstrike and the Management, bent on keeping the factory\ngoing, needed workmen who work. To recruit fresh hands into\nthe lists and to keep the old hands on the roster was double\nburden, and, therefore, the strikers had to be eased out to\nyield place to new recruits. The object was not to punish\nthe workmen but to keep the factory working Accepting this\nplea, as it were, the award of the arbitrator has exonerated\nthe Management of the charge of dismissal while the High\nCourt has held the action to be dismissal for misconduct and\ntherefore bad in law.\n\nIn our opinion, the facts of the case before us speak\nfor themselves Here are workmen on strike. The strike is\nillegal. The Management is hurt because production is\nparalyzed. The strikers allegedly indulge ill objectionable.\nactivities. The exasperated Management hits back by ordering\ntheir discharge for reasons set out in several pages in the\nappropriate contemporaneous proceeding. Misconduct after\nmisconduct is flung on the workers to justify the drastic\naction In all conscience and common sense, the discharge is\nthe punishment for the misconduct. The Management minces no\nwords. What is explicity stated is not a colourless farewell\nto make way for fresh hands to work the factory until the\nstrike is settled but a hard hitting order with grounds of\nguilt and penalty of removal.\n\nThe inference is inevitable, however, ingenious the\ncontrary argument, that precisely because the Management\nfound the workmen refractory in their misconduct they were\nsacked. Maybe, the management had no other way of working\nthe factory but that did not change the character of the\naction taken. Once we hold the discharge punitive the\nnecessary consequence is that enquiry before punishment was\nadmittedly obligatory and confessedly not undertaken. The\norders were bad on this score alone.\n\nSri A. K. Sen urged that in a dismissal the employee is\ndenied some of the retiral and other benefits which he gets\nin a simple discharge, and here all the employees were\noffered their full monetary benefits, so that it was wrong\nto classify the orders of discharge as punitive. Maybe, a\ndismissed servant may well be disentitled to some, at least,\nof the financial benefits which his counterpart who-is\nsimply discharged may draw. But that is not a conclusive\ntest. Otherwise, the master may 'cashier' his servant and\ncamouflage it by offering full retiral benefits. Dismissal\nis not discharge plus a price. The substance of\nthe action is the litmus test. In the present case, the\npenal core, 'tied ,4. in tooth and claw, shows up once we\nprobe; and the non-committal frame of the formal order is a\ndisguise. For a poor workman loss of his job is a heavy\npenalty when inflicted for alleged misconduct, for he is so\nhungry that, in Gandhiji's expressive words, he sees God\nHimself in a loaf of bread.\n\nBefore we leave this part of the case, a reference to\nsome industrial law aspects and cases may be apposite though\na little repetitive Standing orders certified for an\nindustrial undertaking or the model Standing orders framed\nunder the Industrial Employment Standing orders Act provide\nfor discharge simpliciter, a term understood in\ncontradistinction to punitive discharge or discharge by way\nof penalty. It is not unknown that an employer resorts to\ncamouflage by garbing or cloaking, a punitive discharge in\nthe innocuous words of discharge simpliciter. Courts have to\ninterpose in order to ascertain whether the discharge is one\nsimpliciter or a punitive discharge, and in doing so the\nveil of language is lifted and the realities perceived. In\nthe initial stages the controversy raised was whether the\ncourt/tribunal had any jurisdiction to lift such a veil.\nProve and penetrate so as to reveal the reality, but this\ncontroversy has been set at rest by the decision in\nWestern\nIndia Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal Bombay\n.\nThe wide scope of the jurisdiction of industrial tribunal,'\ncourt in this behalf is now well established. If standing\norders or the terms of contract permit the employer to\nterminate the services of his employee by discharge\nsimpliciter without assigning reasons, it would be open to\nhim to take recourse to the said term or condition and\nterminate the services of his employee but when the validity\nof such termination is challenged in industrial adjudication\nit would be competent to the industrial Tribunal to ensure\nwhether the impugned discharge has been effected in the bona\nfide exercise of the power conferred by the terms of\nemployment. If the discharge has been ordered by the\nemployer in bona fide exercise of his power, then the\nindustrial tribunal may not interfere with it; but the words\nused in the order of discharge and the form which it may\nhave taken are not conclusive in the matter an(l the\nindustrial tribunal would be entitled to go behind the words\nand form and decide whether the discharge is a discharge\nsimpliciter or not If it appears that the purported exercise\nof power to terminate the Services of the employee was in\nfact the result of the misconduct alleged against him. then\nthe tribunal would be justified in dealing with the dispute\non the basis; that, despite its appearance to the contrary.\nthe order of discharge is in effect an order of dismissal.\n\nIn the exercise of this power, the\ncourt/tribunal would be entitled to interfere with the order\nin question [see\nAssam Co. v. Its Workmen\n]. In the matter of\nan order of discharge of an employee as understood within\nthe meaning of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nthe iron of the\norder and the language in which it is couched are not\ndecisive.\n\nIf the industrial court is satisfied that the\norder of discharge is punitive or that it amount; to\nvictimisation or unfair labour practice it is competent to\nthe Court/tribunal to set aside the order in a proper case\nand direct reinstatement of the employee [see Tata oil\nMills\nCo. Ltd. v. Workmen\n]. The form used for terminating the\nservice is not conclusive and the tribunal has jurisdiction\nto enquire into the reasons which led to such termination In\nthe facts of the case it was found that Standing orders\nprovided that an employee could ask for reasons for\ndischarge in the case of discharge simpliciter. Those\nreasons were given before the tribunal by the appellant,\nviz., that the respondents services were terminated because\nhe deliberately resorted to go-slow and was negligent in the\ndischarge of his duty. It was accordingly held that the\nservices of the employee were terminated for dereliction of\nduty and go-slow in his work which clearly amounted to\npunishment for misconduct and. therefore. to pass an order\nunder cl. 17(a) of the Standing orders permitting discharge\nsimpliciter in such circumstances was clearly a colorable\nexercise of power to terminate services of a workman under\nthe provision of the Standing orders.\n\nIn these circumstances\nthe tribunal would be justified in going behind the order\nand deciding for itself whether the termination of the\nrespondent's services could be sustained (vide\nManagement of\nMurugan Mills Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, Madras & Anr.\nThis\nview was affirmed in\nTata Engineering & Locomotive Co.\nLtd. v. S. C. Prasad & Anr.\n(4).\n\nAfter approving the ratio in\n\nMurugan Mills\ncase, this Court in L. Michael & Anr. v. M/s.\nJohnson Pumps India Ltd observed that the manner of\ndressing up an order did not matter.\n\nThe slightly different\nobservation in Workmen of Sudder office,\nCinnamare v.\nManagement\nwas explained by the Court and it was further\naffirmed that since the decision of this Court in the\n\nChartered Bank v. The Chartered Bank Employee\n's Union it\nhas taken the consistent view that if the termination of\nservice is a colourable exercise of power vested in the\nmanagement or is a result of victimization\nor unfair labour practice, the court/tribunal would have\njurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\n\nIt\nwas urged that a different view was taken by this Court in\n\nMunicipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. P. S. Malvenkar\n&\nors. The employee in that was discharged from service by\npaying one month's wages in lieu of notice This action was\nchallenged by the employee before the Labour Court and it\nwas contended that it was a punitive discharged. The\nCorporation contended that wider Standing order No. 26 the\nCorporation had the power to discharge but there was an\nobligation to give reasons if so demanded by the employee.\nThe Corporation had also the power to discharge by way of\npunishment. The Court in this connection observed as under:\n\n\"Now one thing must be borne in mind that these\nare two distinct and independent powers and as far as\npossible either should be construed so as to emasculate\nthe other cr to render it ineffective. One is the power\nto punish an employee for misconduct while the other is\nthe power to terminate simpliciter the service of an\nemployee without any, other adverse consequence. Now.\nproviso (i) to clause (1) of Standing order 26 requires\nthat the reason for termination of the employment\nshould be given in writing to the employee when\nexercising the power of termination of service of the\nemployee under Standing order 26. Therefore, when the\nservice of an employee is terminated simpliciter under\nStanding order 26, the reason for such termination has\nto be given to the employee and this provision has been\nmade in the Standing order with a view to ensuring that\nthe management does not act in an arbitrary manner. The\nmanagement is required to articulate the reason which\noperated on its mind in terminating the service cf the\nemployee. But merely because the reason for terminating\nthe service of the employee is required to be given and\nthe reason must obviously not be arbitrary, capricious\nor irrelevant-it would not necessarily in every case\nmake the order or termination punitive in character so\nas require compliance with the requirement of clause\n(2) of Standing order 21 read with Standing order 23.\n\nOtherwise. the power of termination of service of an\nemployee under Standing order 26 would be rendered\nmeaningless and futile for in no case it would be\npossible to exercise it. Of course, if misconduct of\nthe employee constitutes the\nfoundation for terminating his service, then even if\nthe order of termination is purported to be made under\nStanding order 26, it may be liable to be regarded as\npunitive in character attracting the procedure of\nclause (2) of Standing order 21 read with Standing\norder 23, though even in such a case it may be argued\nthat the management n has not punished the employee but\nhas merely terminated his service under Standing order\n\n26.\"\n\nIt does not purport to run counter to the established\nratio that the form of the order is not decisive and the\nCourt can lift the veil. How ever, it may be noted that\nthere was an alternative contention before the Court that\neven if the order of discharge was considered punitive in\ncharacter, the employer corporation had led evidence before\nthe labour court to substantiate the charge of misconduct\nand that finding was also affirmed.\n\nWe are satisfied that the Management, whatever its\nmotives vis-a-vis keeping the stream of production flowing,\ndid remove from service, on punitive grounds, all the 853\nworkmen.\n\nThe law is trite that the Management may still ask for\nan opportunity to make out a case for dismissal before the\nTribunal. The refinements of industrial law in this branch\nneed not detain u.s because the arbitrator did investigate\nand hold that the workmen were guilty of misconduct and the\n'sentence' of dismissal was merited, even as the High Court\ndid reappraise and reach, on both counts, the reverse\nconclusion.\n\nThe sweep of\nArticle 226\n\nOnce we assume that the jurisdiction of the arbitrator\nto enquire into the alleged misconduct was exercised, was\nthere any ground under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution to\ndemolish that holding ? Every wrong order cannot be righted\nmerely because it is wrong. It can be quashed only if it is\nvitiated by the fundamental flaws of gross miscarriage of\njustice, absence of legal evidence, perverse misreading of\nfacts, serious errors of law on the face of the order,\njurisdictional failure and the like.\n\nWhile the remedy under\nArticle 226\nis extraordinary and\nis of Anglo-Saxon vintage, it is not a carbon copy of\nEnglish processes.\nArticle 226\nis a sparing surgery but the\nlancet operates where injustice suppurates. While\ntraditional restraints like availability of alternative\nremedy hold back the court, and judicial power should not\nordinarily rush in where the other two branches fear to\ntread, judicial daring is not daunted where glaring\ninjustice demands even affirmative action.\nThe wide words of\nArticle 226\nare designed for service of\nthe lowly numbers in their grievances if the subject\nbelongs to the court's province and the remedy is\nappropriate to the judicial process. There is native hue\nabout\nArticle 226\n, without being anglophile or anglophobic\nin attitude. Viewed from this jurisprudential perspective,\nwe have to be cautious both in not overstepping as if\nArticle. 226 were as large as an appeal and not failing to\nintervene where a grave error has crept in. Moreover, we sit\nhere in appeal over the High Court s Judgement. And an\nappellate power interferes not when the order appealed is\nnot right but only when it is clearly wrong. The difference\nis real, though fine.\n\nWhat are the primary facts which have entered the\nTribunal's verdict in holding the strikers guilty of\nmisconduct meriting dismissal ? We must pause to remove a\nconfusion and emphasise that the dismissal, order is not\nagainst the Union but the individual workers. What did each\none do ? Did his conduct, when sifted and scrutinised, have\nany exculpation or extenuation ? Not strikers in the mass,\nbut each worker separately, must be regarded as the unit of\ndisciplinary action. Each one's role and the degree of\nturpitude, his defence on guilt and punishment, must be\nadjudged before economic death sentence is inflicted. A\ntypical trial process instance will illumine the point.\nSuppose there is case of arson and murder in a village\nbecause of communal faction and a hundred men from the\naggressive community are charged in court with serious\noffences. Suppose further that convincing testimony of the\nprovocation and aggression by that community is produced.\nCan any single member of the violent community be convicted\non 'mass' evidence, without specific charges of\nparticipation or clear proof of constructive involvement ?\nJudicial perspicacity clears this common fallacy. It is\ndangerous to mass-convict on the theory of community built.\nAnger sometimes brings in this error.\n\nIn our assessment, the arbitrator has been swayed by\ngeneralities where particularities alone would have\nsufficed. A long story may be made short by skipping the\ndetails and focussing on essentials. We must, in fairness,\nstate that the Arbitrator, an experienced and accepted\ntribunal in labour disputes, has exhaustively brought into\nthe Award all available details pro and con with over-\nemphasis here and there. There are only a few confusions in\nhis long award but, regrettably, they happen to be on a few\nfundamentals. The foremost, of course, is a mix-up between\nmob-misconduct and individual guilt. The next is getting\nlost in the oceanic evidence while navigating towards a 1\nspecified port. The High Court too has excelled in\nmarshalling the details and handling the legal issues,\nalthough, even there, shortcomings\non basic issues have been pointed out by Sri A. K. Sen. We\ntoo are apt to err and reverse ourselves although we try our\nbest to avoid error. The Supreme Court is final not because\nit is infallible; it is infallible; because it is final.\npropose to examine the essential issues from the perspective\nWe have set out and in their proper jurisprudential\nbearings.\n\nIf misconduct was basic to the discharge and no enquiry\nprecedent to the dismissal was made the story did not end\nthere in favour of the workmen. The law is well-settled that\nthe Management may still satisfy the tribunal about the\nmisconduct.\n\nAs a fact the arbitrator held misconduct proved. He\nfurther found that the circumstances justified dismissal\nthough he decided the order to mean discharge simpliciter\nWas misconduct proved against each discharged worker at\nleast before the arbitrator ? If it was, did every worker\ndeserve punitive discharge ?\n\nDual jurisdictional issues arise here which have been\nargued at some length before us. The position taken up by\nSri Sen was that the High Court could not, under\nArticle\n, direct reinstatement, and even it felt that the\narbitrator had gone wrong in refusing reinstatement, the\ncourt could only demolish the order and direct the\narbitrator to reconsider the issue. What belonged, as a\ndiscretionary power, to a tribunal or other adjudicatory\nbody could not be wrested by the writ court. To put it\npithily, regarding the relief of reinstatement, the\narbitrator could but would not and the High Court would but\ncould not. (We will deal later with the point that the\narbitrator had himself no power under\nSection 11 A\nof the\nAct but did have it in view of the wide terms of reference.)\nThe basis of this submission as we conceive it. is the\ntraditional limitations woven around high prerogative writs.\nWithout examining the correctness of this limitation, we\ndisregard it because while\nArticle 226\nhas been inspired by\nthe royal writs its sweep and scope exceed hide-bound\nBritish processes of yore. We are what we are because our\nConstitution-framers have felt the need for a pervasive\nreserve power in the higher judiciary to right wrongs under\nour conditions. Heritage cannot hamstring; nor custom\nconstrict where the language used is wisely wide. The\nBritish paradigms are not necessarily models in the Indian\nRepublic. So broad are the expressive expressions designedly\nused in\nArticle 226\nthat any order which should have been\nmade by the lower authority could be made by the High Court.\nThe very width of the power and the disinclination to\nmeddle, except where gross injustice or fatal illegality and\nthe like are present inhibit the exercise but do not abolish\nthe power.\nWe may dilate a little more on\nArticle 226\nvis-a-vis\nawards of arbitrators. The first limb of the argument is\nthat when there is a voluntary joint submission of an\nindustrial dispute to an Arbitrator named by them under\ns.\n10A\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, he does not function as\na Tribunal and is not amenable to the jurisdiction of that\nCourt under\nArticle 227\nor under\nArticle 226.\nWithout\nfurther elaboration this contention can be negatived on a\ndecision of this Court in\nRohtas Industries Ltd. & Anr. v.\nRohtas Industries State Union\nors. (1) This Court observed\nthat as the Arbitrator under\ns. 10A\nhas the power to bind\neven those who are not parties to the reference or agreement\nand the whole exercise under\ns. 10A\nas well as the source of\nthe force of the Award on publication derived from the\nstatute, it is legitimate to regard such an arbitrator now\nas part of the infrastructure of the sovereigns dispensation\nof justice, thus falling within the rainbow of statutory\ntribunals amenable to judicial review.\n\nThe second limb of the argument was that a writ of\ncertiorari could not be issued to correct errors of facts.\n\nIn this connection after affirming the ratio in\nEngineering\nMazdoor Sabha v. Hind Cycle Ltd.\n, this Court observes that\nwhat is important is a question of law arising on the face\nof the facts found and its resolution ex facie or sub\nsilentio. The Arbitrator may not state the law as such; even\nthen such acute silence confers no greater or subtler\nimmunity on the award than plain speech. We do not dilate on\nthis part of the argument as we are satisfied that be the\ntest the deeply embedded rules to issue certiorari or the\ntraditional grounds to set aside an arbitration award 'thin\npartition do their bounds divide' on the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case. Broadly stated, the\nprinciple of law is that the jurisdiction of the High Court\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is limited to holding\nthe judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals or administrative\nbodies exercising the quasi-judicial powers within the\nleading strings of legality and to see that they do not\nexceed their statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer\nthe law\nlaid down by\nthe statute under which they act. So\nlong as the hierarchy of officers and appellate authorities\ncreated by the statute function within their ambit the\nmanner in which they do so can he no ground for\ninterference.\n\nThe power of judicial supervision of the High\nCourt under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution (as it then\nstood) is not greater than those under\nArticle 226\nand it\nmust be limited to seeing that a tribunal functions within\nthe limits of its authority [see\nNagendra Nath Bora & Anr.\nv. The Commissioner of Hills Division & Appeals, Assam\n&\nors.(a) ]. This led to a proposition that in\nexercising jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nthe High Court is\nnot constituted a Court of appeal over the decision of\nauthorities, administrative or quasi-judicial. Adequacy or\nsufficiency of evidence is not its meat. It is not the\nfunction of a High Court in a petition for a writ under Art\n226 to review the evidence and to arrive at an independent\nfinding on the evidence.\n\n[See\nState of Andhra Pradesh v. S.\nShree Rama Rao ] A\nconstitution Bench of this Court in P.\nH. Kalyani v. M/s-. Air France, Calcutta ) succinctly set\nout the limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court in\ndealing with a writ petition. It was said that in order to\njustify a writ of certiorari it must be shown that an order\nsuffers from an error apparent on the face of the record.\n\nIt\nwas further pointed out that in the finding of fact is made\nby the impugned order and it is shown that it success from\nan error of law and not of fact, a writ under\nArticle 226\n\nwould issue, and, while so saying, the decision in\nNagendra\nNath Bora\n's case was affirmed.\n\nFollowing the aforementioned\ndecision, the Gujarat High Court in\nNavinchandra Shakerchand\nShah v. Manager, Ahmedabad Coop. Department Stores Ltd.\n\nobserved that the amended\nArticle 226\nwould enable the High\nCourt to interfere with an Award of the industrial\nadjudicator if that is based on a complete misconception of\nlaw or it is based on no evidence or that no reasonable man\nwould come to the conclusion to which the Arbitrator has\narrived.\n\nEven apart from, but while approving, the Gujarat\nruling in 19 G.L.R. p. 108 cited before us, we are satisfied\nthat the writ power is larger given illegality and\ninjustice, even if its use is severely discretionary as\ndecided cases have repeatedly laid down. We over-rule the\nobjection of invalidity of the High Courts order for want of\npower.\n\nThe more serious question is whether the arbitrator had\nthe plenitude of power to re-examine the punishment imposed\nby the Management, even if he disagreed with its severity.\nIn this ease the arbitrator expressed himself as concurring\nwith the punishment. But if he had disagreed, as the High\nCourt, in his place, did, could he have interfered? Armed\nwith the language of\nSec. 11A\n, which confers wide original\npower to the tribunal to re-fix the 'sentence', Sri Sen\nargued that an arbitrator was uncovered by this new Section.\nSo, even if he would, he could not. And, in this case if he\ncould, he would not. There the matter ended, was the\nargument. We disagree. Even if he could. he would not, true;\nbut that did not preclude the High Court from reviewing the\norder in exercise of its extraordinary constitutional power.\nMoreover,\nSec. 11A\ndid clothe the arbitrator with similar\npower as tribunals, despite the doubt created by the\nabstruse absence A of specific mention of 'arbitrator' in\n\nSec. 11A\n. This position needs closer examination and turns\non interpretational limitations. At this stage, to\nfacilitate the discussion, we may read the provision:\n\n\"11A. Where an industrial dispute relating to the\ndischarge or dismissal of a workmen has been referred\nto a 1 Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal for\nadjudication and, in the course of the adjudication\nproceedings, the Labour Court, Tribunal or National\nTribunal, as the case may be, is satisfied that the\norder of discharge or dismissal was not justified, it\nmay, as it thinks fit, or give such other relief to the\nWorkman on such terms and conditions, if any, as it\nthinks fit, or give such other relief to the workman,\nincluding the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of\ndischarge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case\nmay require:\n\nProvided that in any proceeding under this section\nthe Labour Court Tribunal or National Tribunal as the\ncase may be, shall rely on the materials on record and\nshall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the\nmatter\".\n\nSec. 11A\nwas introduced in purported implementation cf\nthe I.L.O. recommendation which expressly referred, inter\nalia to arbitrators. The Statement of objects and Reasons\nwhich illumines the words of the legislative text when it is\nhalf-lit, even if it cannot directly supplement the section,\ndoes speak of the I.L.o. recommendations and, in terms of\ntribunals and arbitrators. When it came to drafting\nSection\n11A\nthe. word 'arbitrator' was missing. Was this of\ndeliberate legislative design to deprive arbitrators, who\ndischarge identical functions as tribunals under the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, of some vital powers which vested\nin their tribunal brethren ? For what mystic purpose could\nsuch distinction be ? Functionally, tribunals and\narbitrators being to the same brood. The entire scheme, from\nits I.L.O. genesis, through the objects and Reasons, fits in\nonly with arbitrators being covered by\nSection 11A\n, unless\nParliament cheated itself and the nation by proclaiming a\ngreat purpose essential to industrial justice and, for no\nrhyme or reason and wittingly or unwittingly, withdrawing\none vital word. Every reason for clothing tribunals with\n\nSec. 11A\npowers applies a fortiori to arbitrators. Then why\nomit ? Could it be a synopic omission which did not affect\nthe semantics because a tribunal, in its wider connotation,\nembraced every adjudicatory organ, including an arbitrator ?\nAn economy of words is a legislative risk before a judiciary\naccustomed to the Anglo-Saxon meticulousness in\ndrafting. We may easily see meaning by one construction. A\n'tribunal' is merely a seat of justice or a judicial body\nwith jurisdiction to render justice. If an arbitrator\nfulfils this functional role and he does -how can he be\nexcluded from these scope of the expression ? A caste\ndistinction between courts, tribunals, arbitrators and\nothers, is functionally fallacious and, in our context,\nstems from confusion. The Section makes only a\nhierarchical, not functional, difference by speaking of\ntribunals and national tribunals. So we see no ground to\ntruncate the natural meaning of 'Tribunal' on the supposed\nintent of Parliament to omit irrationally the category of\nadjudicatory organs known as arbitrators. To cut down is to\ncripple and the art of interpretation makes whole, not\nmutilates, furthers the expressed purpose, not hampers, by\nnarrow literality.\n\nSection 2(r)\ndefines Tribunal thus:\n\n'Tribunal' means an Industrial Tribunal\nconstituted under\nSection 7A\nand includes an Industrial\nTribunal constituted before the 10th day of March,\n1957, under this Act,\nPrima-facie it is a different category from arbitrators but\nall statutory definitions are subject to contextual changes.\nIt is perfectly open. to the court to give the natural\nmeaning to a word defined in the Act if the context in which\nit appears suggests a departure from the definition because\nthen there is something repugnant in the subject or context.\n\nThen what is the natural meaning of the expression\n\"Tribunal\"? A 'tribunal' literally means a seat of justice.\nMay be, justice is dispensed by a quasi-judicial body, an\narbitrator, a commission, a court or other adjudicatory\norgan created by the State. All these are tribunals and\nnaturally the import of the word embraces an arbitration\ntribunal. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Vol. 4 p. 3093)\nspeaks of 'Tribunal in this, wider sense and quoted Fry,\nL.J. in Dawkins v. Rokeby [L.R. 8 Q.B. 255, affirmed, L.R. 7\nH.L. 744]:\n\n\"I accept that, with this qualification that I do\nnot like the word 'tribunal'. The word is, ambiguous,\nbecause it has not like 'court' any ascertainable\nmeaning in English law\" (Royal Acsuarium v. Parkinson.\n[1892] Q.B. 431, cited COURT) .\n\nThere is a reference to the bishop's commission of\nenquiry as judicial tribunal and, significantly, specific\nmention has been made in these terms.\n\"Disputes between employers and employees are A\nreferred to such tribunals as the Civil Service\nArbitration Tribunal, National Arbitration Tribunal and\nthe Industrial Disputes Tribunal\". (Stroud's Judicial\nDictionary p. 3094)\nWe have hardly any doubt that 'tribunal' simpliciter\nhas a sweeping signification and does not exclude\n'arbitrator'.\n\nHere we come upon a fundamental dilemma of\ninterpretative technology vis-a-vis the judicative faculty.\nWhat are the limits of statutory construction ? Does\ncreativity in this jurisprudential area permit travel into\nsemantic engineering as substitute for verbalism ? It is\nincreasingly important for developing countries, where\nlegislative transformation of the economic order is an\nurgent item on the national agenda, to have the judiciary\nplay a meaningful role in the constitutional revolution\nwithout ferreting out laws in the draftsman, once the object\nand effect are plain. Judges may not be too 'anglo-phonic'\nlest the system fail.\n\nIt is edifying to recall from Robert Stevens' Law and\nPolitics of the House of Lords as a judicial body:\n\n\"Moreover, Macmillan, who began to specialize in\nthe increasingly frequent tax appeals, continued to\ndevelop this highly artificial approach in Inland\nRevenue Commissioner v. Ayrshire Employers Mutual\nInsurance Association, when Parliament had clearly\nintended to make the annual surpluses of mutual\ninsurance companies subject to tax, Macmillan found a\nparticularly formalistic argument to show that this had\nnot been the effect of\nsection 31\nof the Finance Act of\n1933. He was then happily able to announce, \"The\nLegislature has plainly missed. fire.\"(a). Of this\ndecision Lord Diplock was later to say that \"if, as in\nthis case, the Courts can identify the target of\nParliamentary legislation their proper function is to\nsee that it is hit: not merely to record that it has\nbeen missed. Here is judicial legislation at its\nworst.\"(3) '\nWe would rather adopt Lord Diplock's thought and have the\ncourt help hit the legislative target, within limits, than\nsigh relief that the legislative fire has missed the bull's\neye. Of course, the social philosophy of the Constitution\nhas, as ruled by this court in several cases, a role in\ninterpretative enlightenment and judicial value vision.\nWe may reinforce this liberal rule of statutory\nconstruction, being a matter of importance in the daily work\nof the Court, by reference even to Roman Law from\nJustinian's days down to the American Supreme Court. \"Not\nall special cases can be contained in the laws and\nresolutions of the Senate\", said the Roman jurist Jullianus,\n\"but where their meaning is manifest in some case, the one\nwho exercises jurisdiction must apply the provision\nanalogously and in this way administer justice.\" Prof.\nBodenheimer has explained that Civil Law does not regard\nwords as the sole basis of law but allows it to be modified\nby purpose. \"Celsus added the following admonition to these\ngeneral principles of interpretation: \"The laws should be\nliberally interpreted, in order that their intent be\npreserved\".\n\n\"Samuel Thorne has shown that, during certain periods\nof English medieval history, the position of the Common Law\ntowards the construction of statutes was similar to the\ngeneral attitude of the Roman and Civil Law. Statutes were\nfrequently extended to situations not expressly covered by\nthem.\"(3)\nPlowden pointed out that \"when the words of a statute\nenact one thing, they enact all other things which are in\nthe like degree,\" Plowden demonstrated that a statutory\nremedy at that time was deemed to be merely illustrative of\nother analogous cases that deserved to be governed by the\nsame principle.\n\n\"our law (like all others) consists of two parts, viz.\nOF body and soul, the letter of the law is the body of the\nlaw, and the sense and reason of the law is the soul of the\nlaw.. And it often happens that when you know the letter,\nyou know not the sense, for sometimes the sense is more\nconfined and contracted than the letter, and sometimes it is\nmore large and extensive\"(5)\nProf. Bodehheimer states that the American trend is\ntowards a purpose-oriented rather than a plain-meaning rule\nin its rigid orthodoxy. In United States v. American\nTrucking Association. The U.S. Supreme Court wrote:\n\n\"When the plain meaning has led to absurd or\nfutile results .. this Court has looked beyond the\nwords to the Purpose of the Act. Frequently, however,\neven when the\nplain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely\nan unreasonable one \"plainly at variance with the\npolicy of the legislation as a whole\" this Court has\nfollowed that purpose rather than the literal words.\nWhen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as\nused in the statute, is available, there can certainly\nbe no \"rule of law\" which forbids its use, how ever,\nclear the words may be on \"superficial examination.\" B\nIn the present case, as the narration of the facts\nunfolded, the reference of the dispute was to an arbitrator.\nHe reinvestigated and reassessed the evidence bearing on the\nguilt of-the discharged workmen after giving an opportunity\nto both sides to adduce evidence thereon Admittedly, he had\nthis power. But had he the follow-up power, if he held the\nmen guilty of punitive misconduct, to reweigh the quantum of\npunishment having regard to the degree of culpability ? This\njurisdiction he enjoys if\nSec. 11A\nincludes 'arbitrators'.\nThis, in turn, flows from our interference as to whether the\nword 'tribunal' takes in an adjudicatory organ like the\narbitrator. It is plain that the expression 'arbitrator' is\nnot expressly mentioned in\nSection 11A\n. Nevertheless, if the\nmeaning of the word 'tribunal' is wider rather than\nnarrower, it will embrace arbitrator as well. That is how\nthe dynamics of interpretation are, in one sense, decisive\nof the fate of the present appeal.\n\nCompeting interpretative angles have contended for\njudicial acceptance English preferences apart, Indian socio-\nlegal conditions must decide the choice in each situation.\nSometimes Judges are prone to castigate creative\ninterpretation in preference to petrified literality by\nstating that Judges declare the law and cannot make law. The\nreply to this frozen faith is best borne out by Lord\nRadcliffe's blunt words:\n\n\" There was never a more sterile controversy than\nthat upon the question whether a judge makes law. Of\ncourse he does. How can he help it ?.... Judicial law\nis always a reinterpretation of principles in the light\nof new combinations of facts.. Judges do not reverse\nprinciples once well established, but they do modify\nthem, extend them, restrict them and even deny their\napplication to the combination in hand.\nLord Devlin in his \"Samples of Lawmaking\", agreed that\nJudges are fashioners of law, if not creators out of\nmaterial supplied to them and went on to observe:\n\"If the House of Lords did not treat itself as\nbound by its own decisions, it might do its own lopping\nand pruning\n.... and perhaps even a little grafting, instead of\nleaving all that for the legislature. But it could not\ngreatly alter the shape of the tree.\"\n\nEven so eminent a Judge as Lord Reid leaned to the view\nthat the law should be developed since it was not static\nand, in this limited sense, Judges are law-makers although\nthis view prevented \"technical minded Judges (from pressing)\nprecedents to their logical conclusions\". On the whole, a\njust and humanist interpretative technique, meaning\npermitting, is the best. We do not mean to conclude that\nJudges can take liberties with language ad libitem and it is\nwholesome to be cautious as Lord Reid in\nShaw v. D.P.P.\n\nwarned: \"Where Parliament fears to tread it is not for the\ncourts to rush in.\"\n\nWe are persuaded that there is much to learn from Lord\nDenning's consistent refrain about the inevitable creative\nelement in the judicial process in the interpretative area.\nWe permit ourselves a quote from Lord Denning because Shri\nA.

Sen did draw our attention to straightening the\ncreases as permissible but not stitching the cloth, making a\ncritical reference to the controversial activism of which\nLord Denning was a leading light:\n\n\"The truth is that the law is uncertain. rt does\nnot cover all the situations that may arise. Time and\nagain practitioners and judges are faced with new\nsituations where the decision may go either way. No one\ncan tell what the law is until the courts decides it.\nThe judges do every day make law, though it is almost\nheresy to say so. If the truth is recognized then we\nmay hope to escape from the dead hand of the past and\nconsciously mould new principles to meet the needs of\nthe present.\"\n\nMr. Justice Mathew in Kesavananda Bharti's case\nreferred with approval-and so do we-to the observations of\nJustice Holmes.\n\n\"I recognize without hesitation that Judges do and\nmust legislate. but they can do so only interstitially;\nthey are confined from molar to molecular motions.\"\nArthur Selwyn Miller writes, \"Some have called it (the\nSupreme A Court) the highest legislative chamber in the\nnation. Although there is no question that the Court can and\ndoes make law, and does so routinely, .. \".\n\nAssuming the above approach to be too creatively novel\nfor traditionalism, let us approach the same problem from a\nconventional angle authenticated by case-law. The question\nof construction of\ns. 11A\nwas argued at length, as to\nwhether an omission of any reference to Arbitrator appointed\nunder\ns. 10A\nin s. 11A would suggest that the Arbitrator\nunder\ns. 10A\n, notwithstanding the terms of reference, would\nnot enjoy the power conferred on all conceivable industrial\nadjudicators under s. 11A. It was said, after referring to\nthe objects and reasons in respect of the bill which was\nmoved to enact\ns. 11A\nin the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, that\nwhile the I.L.O. had indicated that an arbitrator selected\nby the parties for adjudication of industrial dispute must\nbe invested with power by appropriate legislation as found\nin\ns. 11A\n, the Parliament, while enacting the section in its\nwisdom, did not include the Arbitrator even though other\nadjudicators of industrial disputes have been conferred such\npower and, therefore, it is a case of Sasus omissions.\nReliance was placed on Gladstone v. Bower where the question\narose whether a reference to a tenancy from year to year in\ns. 2(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1948 would also\ncover a tenancy for 18 months which could be terminated at\nthe end of the first year. The submission was that even\nthough no notice was necessary at common law because the\ntenancy would automatically terminate at the expiry of the\nspecified period of tenancy, the tenancy took effect as\ntenancy from year to year by virtue of\nS. 2(1)\nof the Act so\nthat it continued until terminated by notice to quit and,\ntherefore the landlord was not entitled to possession\nwithout notice. It was further contended that if a tenancy\nfrom year to year was to get the protection of the Act it is\ninconceivable that tenancy for a longer duration would not\nqualify for that protection. Court of Appeal negatived this\ncontention holding that this is a case simply of casus\nomissus and the Act is defective. The court further held\nthat if it were ever permissible for the Court to repair a\ndefective Act of Parliament, the Court would be very glad to\ndo so in this case so far as the Court could. The Court will\nalways allow the intention of a statute to override the\ndefects of wording buts the Court's ability to do so is\nlimited by the recognised canons of interpretation. The\nCourt may, for example, prefer an alternative construc-\ntion which is less well-fitted to the words but better\nfitted to the intention of the Act. But here, for the\nreasons given by the learned Judge, there is not alternative\nconstruction; it is simply a case of something being\noverlooked. The Court cannot legislate for a casus\nomissions. To do so would be to usurp the function of the\nlegislature [see Magor & St. Mellons Rural District Council\nv. Newport Corporation. Where the Statute's meaning is clear\nand explicit, words cannot be interpolated. Even where the\nmeaning of the statute is clear and sensible, either with or\nwithout the omitted word, interpolation is improper, since\nthe primary source of the legislative intent is in the\nlanguage of the statute [see Crawford's \"Construction of\nStatutes\".\n1940 Edn., p. 269 extracted in\nS. Narayanaswami\nv. G. Panneerselvam\n.] Undoubtedly, the Court cannot put into\nthe Act words which 'are not expressed, and which cannot\nreasonably he implied on any recognised principles of\nconstruction.\nThat would be a work of legislation, not of\nconstruction, and outside the province of the Court [see\nKamalaranjan v. Secretary of State(3).] Similarly, where the\nwords of the statute are clear it would not be open to the\nCourt in order to obtain a desired result either to omit or\nadd to the words of the statute. This is not the function of\nthe Court charged with a duty of construction. This approach\nhas, however, undergone a sea change as expressed by\nDenning, I.. J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher\nwherein he observed as under:\n\n\"When a defect appears a Judge cannot simply fold\nhis hands and blame the draftman. He must set to work\non the constructive task of finding the intention of\nParliament.... and then he must supplement the written\nwords so as to give 'force and life' to the intention\nof legislature ...., A judge should ask himself the\nquestion how, if the makers of the Act had themselves\ncome across this ruck in the texture of it, they would\nhave straightened it out ? He must then do as they\nwould have done. A judge must not alter the material of\nwhich the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out\nthe creases.\"\n\n(Approved in\nState of Bihar & Anr. v. Dr. Asis Kumar\nMukherjee\n& ors. where in he observed as under:\nThis long excursion has become important because, once\nin a while, social legislation which requires sharing of\nsocial philosophy between the Parliament and the Judiciary;\nmeets with its Waterloo in the . higher courts because the\ntrue role of interpretation shifts from Judge to Judge. We\nare clearly of the view that statutory construction which\nfulfills the mandate of the statute must find favour with\nthe Judges, except where the words and the context rebel\nagainst such , flexibility. We would prefer to be liberal\nrather than lexical when reading the meaning of industrial\nlegislation which develops from day to day in the growing\neconomy of India. The necessary conclusion from this\ndiscussion is that the expression 'tribunal' includes, in\nthe statutory setting, an arbitrator also. Contemporaneous\npar-legislative material may legitimately be consulted when\na word of wider import and of marginal obscurity needs to be\ninterpreted. So viewed, we are not in a 'sound-proof system'\nand the I.L.O. recommendation accepted by India. and the\nobjects and Reasons of the amending Act leave no doubt about\nthe sense, policy and purpose. Therefore\nSection 11A\napplies\nto the arbitrator in the present case and he has the power\nto examine whether the punishment imposed in the instant\ncase is excessive. So has the High Court, if the Award\nsuffers from a fundamental flaw.\n\nA study of the lengthy award discloses no mention of\n\nSection 11A\n, and presumably, the authority was unmindful of\nthat provision while rendering the verdict. In a limited\nsense, even prior to\nSection 11A\n, there was jurisdiction for\na labour tribunal, including an arbitrator, to go into the\npunitive aspect of the Management's order. This Court has,\nin a catena of cases, held that a mala fide punishment is\nbad in law and when the punishment is grotesquely condign or\nperversely harsh or glaringly discriminatory, an easy\ninference of bad faith, unfair labour practice or\nvictimisation arises. The wider power tn examine or\nprescribe the correct punishment belongs to\ntribunal/arbitrator even under\nSec. 11\nin no enquiry (or a\ndefective enquiry which is bad, and, therefore, can be\nequated with a 'no enquiry' situation) has been held by the\nManagement. For, then, there is no extant order of guilt or\npunishment and the tribunal determines it fresh. In such a\nvirgin situation both culpability and quantification of\npunishment arc within the jurisdiction of the\ntribunal/arbitrator. The present is such a case.\n\nVolleys of rulings from both sides were fired during\narguments, the target being the limited area of the\ntribunal's power to overturn the quantum of punishment\nawarded by the Management. We do not think it necessary to\nre-gurgitate all that has been said by this Court\nupto now, since it is sufficient to bring out the correct\nlaw in the light of the leading citations. It is\nincontrovertible that where, as here, no enquiry has been\nheld by the Management, the entire subject is at large and\nboth guilt and punishment, in equal measure, may be\ndetermined, without inhibition of jurisdiction, by the\ntribunal.\n\nLastly, as rightly urged by counsel for the Sabha, an\narbitrator has all the powers the terms of reference, to\nwhich both sides are party, confer. Here, admittedly, the\nreference is very widely worded and includes the nature of\nthe punishment. The law and the facts do not call for\nfurther elaboration and we hold that, in any view, the\narbitrator had the authority to investigate into the\npropriety of the discharge and the veracity of the\nmisconduct. Even if\nS. 11A\nis not applicable, an Arbitrator\nunder s. 10A is bound to act in the spirit of the\nlegislation under which he is to function. A commercial\narbitrator who derives his jurisdiction from the terms of\nreference will by necessary implication, be bound to decide\naccording to law and, when one says 'according to law', it\nonly means existing law and the law\nlaid down by\nthe\nSupreme Court being the law of the land, an Arbitrator under\n\ns. 10A\nwill have to decide keeping in view the spirit of\nS.\n11A\n[See\nUnion of India v. Bungo Steel Furniture Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(1967)] 1 S.C.R. 324]. The Jurisdictional hurdles being thus\ncleared, we may handle the basic facts and the divergences\nbetween the Arbitrator and the High Court before moulding\nthe final relief.\n\nPrefatory to the discussion about the factum of\nmisconduct and its sequel, we must remind ourselves that the\nstrike was illegal, having been launched when another\nindustrial dispute was pending adjudication.\nSec. 23 (a)\n\nappears, at a verbal level, to convey such a meaning\nalthough the ambit of sub-clause (a) may have to be\ninvestigated fully in some appropriate case in the light of\nits scheme and rationale. It looks strange that the pendency\nof a reference on a tiny or obscure industrial dispute-and\nthey often pend too long-should block strikes on totally\nunconnected yet substantial and righteous demands. The\nconstitutional implications and practical complications of\nsuch a veto of a valuable right to strike often leads not to\nindustrial peace but to seething unrest and lawless strikes.\nBut in the present case, both before the arbitrator and the\nHigh Court, the parties have proceeded, on the agreed\nfooting that the strike was illegal under\nSection 23(a)\n. We\ndo not reopen the issue at this late stage and assume the\nillegality of the strike.\n\nThe Fatal Flaw in the Award:\n\nThe Achilles heel of the arbitrator's award is where he\nmakes, as a substitute for specific and individuated\nfindings of guilt and\nappropriate penalty vis-a-vis each workmen, a wholesale\nsurvey of A the march of events, from tension to breakdown,\nfrom fair settlement to illegal and unjustified strike, from\nfutility of negotiation to readiness for arbitration, from\noffer of full re-employment to partial taking back on\napplication by workmen in sack cloth and ashes, by picking\nand choosing after a humble declaration that the strike has\nbeen formally buried, from episodes of violence and\nparalysis of production to backstage manoeuvres to get the\nfactory taken over as a 'sick mill', and after a full\nglimpse of this scenario, holds that the Sabha was always in\nthe wrong, and inevitably, the Management was surely\nreasonable AND, ergo, every employee must individually bear\nthe cross of misconduct and suffer dismissal for the sins of\nthe Sabha leadership-its secretary was not an employee of\nthe mill-by some sub-conscious doctrine of guilt by\nassociation! Non Sequitur.\n\nEach link in the chain of facts has been challenged by\nthe respondents but let us assume them to be true, to test\nthe strength of the legal fibre of the verdict. (We may\nmention by way of aside, D. that the Company seems to be a\nwell managed one.)\nThe cardinal distinction in our punitive jurisprudence\nbetween a commission of enquiry and a Court of Adjudication,\nbetween the cumulative causes of a calamity and the specific\nguilt of a particular person, is that speaking generally, we\nhave rejected, as a nation, the theory of community guilt\nand collective punishment and instead that no man shall be\npunished except for his own guilt. Its reflection in the\ndisciplinary jurisdiction is that no worker shall be\ndismissed save on proof of his individual delinquency.\nBlanket attainder of a bulk of citizens on any vicarious\ntheory for the gross sins of some only, is easy to apply but\nobnoxious in principle. Here, the arbitrator has found the\nSabha Leadership perverse, held that the strikers should\nhave reasonably reported for work and concluded that the\nManagement had, for survival, to make-do with new recruits.\nTherefore what ?\n\nWhat, at long last, is the answer to the only pertinent\nquestion in 6. a disciplinary proceeding viz. what is the\nspecific misconduct against the particular workmen who is to\nlose his job and what is his punitive desert? Here you can't\ngeneralise any more than a sessions judge can, by holding a\nfaction responsible for a massacre, sentence every denizen\nof that factions village to death penalty. The legal error\nis fundamental, although lay instinct may not be outraged.\nWhat did worker A do ? Did he join the strike or remain at\nhome for fear of vengeance against blacklegs in a para-\nviolent situation ? Life\nand limb are dearer than loyalty, to the common run of men,\nand discretion is the 'better part of valour. Surely, the\nSabha complained of Management's goondas and the latter\nsought police aid against the unruly core of strikers. In\nbetween, the ordinary rustic workmen might not have desired\nto be branded blacklegs or become martyrs and would not have\nreported for work. If not being heroic in daring to break\nthrough the strike cordon-illegal though the strike be-were\nmisconduct, the conclusion would have been different. Not\nreporting for work does not lead to an irrebuttable\npresumption of active participation in the strike. More is\nneeded to bring home the mens rea and that burden is on the\nprosecutor, to wit the Management. Huddling together the\neventful history of deteriorating industrial relations and\nperverse leadership of the Sabha is no charge against a\nsingle worker whose job is at stake on dismissal. What did\nhe do ? Even when lawyers did go on strike in the higher\nCourts or organize a boycott, legally or illegally, even top\nlaw officers of the Central Govt. did not attend court,\nargued Shri Tarkunde, and if they did not boycott but\nmerely did not attend, could workers beneath the bread line\nbe made of sterner stuff. There is force in this pragmatic\napproach. The strike being illegal is a non-issue at this\nlevel. The focus is on active participation. Mere absence,\nwithout more, may not compel the conclusion of involvement.\n\nLikewise, the further blot on the strike, of being\nunjustified, even if true, cuts no ice. Unjustified, let us\nassume; so what? The real question is, did the individual\nworker, who was to pay the penalty, actively involve himself\nin this unjustified misadventure ? or did he merely remain a\nquiescent non-worker during that explosive period ? Even if\nhe was a passive striker, that did not visit him with the\nvice of activism in running an unjustified strike. In the\nabsence of proof of being militant participant the\npunishment may differ. To dismiss a worker, in an economy\ncursed by massive unemployment, is a draconian measure as a\nlast resort. Rulings of this Court have held that the degree\nof culpability and the quantum of punishment turn on the\nlevel of participation in the unjustified strike.\nRegrettably, no individualised enquiry has been made by the\nArbitrator into this significant component of delinquency.\nDid any dismissed worker instigate, sabotage or indulge in\nvandalism or violence ?\n\nThe Management's necessity to move the mill into\nproduction for fear of being branded a 'sick unit' is\nunderstandable. Of course, collective strike is economic\npressure by cessation of work and not exchange of\npleasantries. It means embarrassing business. Such a\nquandary cannot alter the law. Here the legal confusion is\nobvious.\nNo inquest into the Management's recruitment of fresh hands\nis being made at this stage. The inquiry is into the\npersonal turpitudes of particular workmen in propelling an\nillegal and unjustified strike and the proof of their\nseparate part therein meriting dismissal. The despair of the\nManagement cannot, by specious transformation of logic, be\nconverted into the despair of each of the 853 workmen.\nSympathies shall not push one into fallacies.\n\nWe may now concretize this generalised criticism of the\notherwise well-covered award. The crowd of documents and\ncamping attitudes must have added to the strain on the\nArbitrator.\n\n\"A voluminous record of documents and\ncorrespondence has been produced before me by both\nsides. There have been allegations and counter\nallegations made by both sides not only against each\nother but even against the Police, the Department of\nLabour and persons in Authority. The history has been\nsought to be traced right from the inception of the\nCompany in 1966 or 1967, by the Company to show that\ntheir conduct has been always proper and above reproach\nand by Sabha to establish that not only the Gujarat\nSteel Tubes Ltd. were not fair to the employees but\nthat every action of theirs good or bad was ill-\nmotivated, was executed with some sinister ulterior\nmotives.\"\n\nThe Award set out the history of the Company, its\nvicissitudes, the hills and valleys, the lights and shadows,\nof industrial relations with mob fury and lock-outs and\nallied episodes often ending in settlements and pious\npledges. Then the Arbitrator stressed Clause 6 of the\nAgreement of December, 1971 which bespoke a no-strike zone\nfor five years. There was reference to the Management's\npromise to implement the Wage Board recommendations. The\nArbitrator was upset that despite Clause a strike was\nlaunched but was not disturbed that despite the Wage Board\nproposals, negotiations were being baulked and an\ninterminable arbitral alternative was being offered by the\nManagement. He exclaimed: \"If such a settlement arrived at\nwas not respected and implemented the, machinery provided by\nlaw would lose all meaning and so also the sanctity of the\nword of the Management or the word of the union. It is,\ntherefore, essential tn ascertain who was responsible for\nthe breach of the agreement so solemnly entered into. -\n\nSerious breach by management is alleged and this is\ngiven as a reason or is made as an cause for getting rid of\nthe obligations\narising out of the agreement which specifically could not be\nterminated for five years.\"\n\nThe narration continues and the following conclusion is\nreached:\n\n\"It is thus very clear that the company had fully\ndischarged its obligation under the agreement in\nrespect of 64 discharged or dismissed workmen and the\nother workmen and the allegation made by the Sabha of\nthe company having made a breach thereof is not\ncorrect.\"\n\nWe thus see, that at this stage, the arbitrator has\nmerely made r) a generalised approach as if a commission of\ninquiry were going into the conduct of the Management and\nthe Sabha to discover who was blameworthy in the imbroglio.\nThe award then swiveled round to a study of the case of the\nSabha vis-a-vis the triple grievances, the Sabha had:\n\n\"I shall first deal with the grievance regarding\ndemands for implementation of the recommendations of\nthe Wage Board\".\n\nThe long and sterile correspondence was set out and the\narbitrator arrived at the conclusion that the insistence on\nreference to arbitration as against negotiation was\njustified on the part of the Management:\n\n\"I, therefore, have accepted the version of: the\nManagement and disbelieved the motivated denial of the\nSabha in this respect.\"\n\nThe culmination of the protracted discussion on the\natmosphere and environment, rather than on the actual charge\nagainst each worker, was recorded in the Award:\n\n\"I have exhaustively, perhaps more exhaustively\nthan even necessary, dealt with the allegations made by\nthe Sabha that the Management had committed breach of\nagreement by refusing to accede to the demand of the\nSabha for implementation of recommendations of the Wage\nBoard. There appears to be no doubt that the Management\nhad agreed to implement the recommendation of the Wage\nBoard. There is also not the least doubt the Management\nwas ready and willing to implement the recommendations\nof the Wage Board it was because it was prevented by .\nthe Sabha from doing so.\"\nAn analysis of the Management's conduct in the matter\nof non-implementation of the Wage Board recommendation was\nthereafter made by the Arbitrator and he wound up thus :\n\n\"I am satisfied that the Company had not committed\nany breach of the settlement dated 4-8-1972 at least so\nfar as implementation of the recommendations of the\nWage Board is concerned.\"\n\nThe question of bonus for the year 1971 was also\nconsidered and dismissed and the\nSabha\n's case to that extent\nwas negatived. Again, the plea for wages for the period of\nthe lock-out was also negatived with the observations :\n\n\"I fail to see how the Sabha can allege breach of\nthe agreement dated 4-8-1972 in view of the clear\nunequivocal terms contained in clause 4 of that\nAgreement.\"\n\nIn this strain the Award continued and the refrain was\nthe same that the Sabha was in the wrong. The Award even\nwent to the exaggerated extent of morbidly holding that the\nworkers were wearing printed badges which, along with other\ncircumstances, amounted to a breach of the agreement !\nThe Award then moved on to the strike of January 27,\n1973 because it led to the dismissal of all the workmen.\nUntil this stage, the arbitrator was merely painting the\nbackground and, at any rate, did not engage himself in\nisolating or identifying any worker or any misconduct. He\nmerely denounced the Sabha, which is neither here nor there,\nin the matter of disciplinary proceedings against each\nindividual workman. He missed the meat of the matter. The\nrelevant portion of the Award based on generalisation proved\nthis error :\n\n\"I am concerned herein with the question whether\nthe discharge or dismissal of the 400 workmen was legal\nand proper or not and what relief to grant to them.\nApproached from any point of view the action of\nthe Company appears to me to be legal, proper and\njustified and the demands on behalf of these workmen\nmust be rejected.\"\n\nA condemnation of the Sabha and an approval of the\nManagement's handling of the strike are miles away from the\nissue on hand.\nWe observe here also an unfortunate failure to separate\nand scan the evidence with specific reference to charges\nagainst individual workman. On the contrary, all that we\nfind in the award is an autopsy of the strike by the Sabha\nand a study of its allegedly perverse postures. A\ndisciplinary inquiry resulting in punishment of particular\ndelinquents cannot but be illegal if the evidence is of mass\nmisconduct by unspecified strikers led by leaders who are\nperhaps not even workmen. We are constrained to state that\npointed consideration of facts which make any of the 400\nworkmen guilty, is a search in vain. The award being ex\nfacie blank from this vital angle, the verdict must prima\nfacie rank as void since vicarious guilt must be brought\nhome against the actively participating members of a\ncollectivity by positive testimony, not by hunch, suspicion\nor occult intuition. The short position is this. Is there a\npunishment of any workman ? If yes, has it been preceded by\nan enquiry ? If not, does not the Management desire to prove\nthe charge before the tribunal ? If yes, what is the\nevidence, against whom, of what misconduct ? If individuated\nproof be forthcoming and relates to an illegal strike, the\nfurther probe is this : was the strike unjustified ? If yes,\nwas the accused worker an active participant therein ? If\nyes, what role did he play and of what acts was he author ?\nThen alone the stage is set for a just punishment. These\nexercises, as an assembly line process are fundamental.\nGeneralisation of a violent strike of a vicious Union\nleadership, of strikers fanatically or foolishly or out of\nfear, failing to report for work, are good background\nmaterial. Beyond that, these must be identified by a\nrational process, the workmen, their individual delinquency\nand the sentence according to their sin. Sans that, the\ndismissal is bad. Viewed from this perspective, the Award\nfails.\n\nThe Arbitrator comes to grips with the core question of\ndischarge simpliciter versus dismissal as punishment but not\nwith the identification of delinquents and delinquency.\nAfter referring to Order 23 of the Model Standing Orders he\ngoes on to state the law correctly by extracting\nobservations from the\nAssam Oil Company\ncase.\n\nAnother vital facet of industrial law is that when no\nenquiry has been held by the Management before imposing a\npunishment (or the enquiry held is defective and bad), the\nwhole field of delinquency and consequent penalty is at\nlarge for the tribunal. Several rulings support this logic.\nWe are constrained to hold that a certain observation made\nper incuriam by Mr. Justice Vaidyalingam, strongly relied on\nby Sri A. K. Sen, does not accurately represent the law,\nalthough the learned\nJudge had earlier stated the law and case-law correctly, if\nwe may say so with respect.\n\nA selective study of the case-law is proper at this\nplace. Before we do this, a few words on the basis of the\nright to strike and progressive legal thinking led by\nconstitutional guidelines is necessitous. The right to\nunionise, the right to strike as part of collective\nbargaining and, subject to the legality and humanity of the\nsituation, the right of the weaker group, viz., labour, to\npressure the stronger party, viz., capital, to negotiate and\nrender justice, are processes recognised by industrial\njurisprudence and supported by Social Justice. While society\nitself, in its basic needs of existence, may not be held to\nransom in the name of the right to bargain and strikers must\nobey civilised norms in the battle and not be vulgar or\nviolent hoodlums, Industry, represented by intransigent\nManagements, may well be made to reel into reason by the\nstrike weapon and cannot then squeal or wail and complain of\nloss of profits or other ill-effects but must negotiate or\ngot a reference made. The broad basis is that workers are\nweaker although they are the producers and their struggle to\nbetter their lot has the sanction of the rule of law. Unions\nand strikes are no more conspiracies than professions and\npolitical parties are, and, being far weaker, need succour.\nPart IV of the Constitution, read with\nArt. 19\n, sows the\nseeds of this burgeoning jurisprudence. The Gandhian quote\nat the beginning of this judgement sets the tone of economic\nequity in Industry. Of course, adventurist, extremist,\nextraneously inspired and puerile strikes, absurdly insane\npersistence and violent or scorched earth policies boomerang\nand are anathema for the law. Within these parameters the\nright to strike is integral to collective bargaining.\n\nResponsible trade unionism is an instrument of\nconcerted action and the laissez faire law that all strikes\nare ipso facto conspiracies, is no longer current coin even\nin Adam Smith's English country. Lord Chorley, in Modern Law\nReview, Vol. 28, 1965, p. 451, is quoted as saying that law\nmust be altered as a consequence of Rookes v. Barnard, so as\nto remove the effects of decisions of conspiracy and\nintimidation. He goes on to state that Allen v. Flood and\nQuinn v. Leathem taking the conspiratorial view must never\nbe permitted to be quoted in courts. In contrast, reference\nwas made to Willis on Constitutional Law, pp. 878-879,\nwherein the Supreme Court of America reflects the impact of\ncapitalistic development and the economic views of the\njudges and the fact that the judges are members of a social\norder and a social product and the decisions are due more to\nthe capitalistic system and the world of ideas in which the\njudges live. Our Constitution is clear\nin its mandate, what with\nArt. 39A\nsuperadded and we have to\nact in tune with the values enshrined therein.\n\nThe benign attitude towards strike being what we have\noutlined, the further question arises whether in the light\nof the accepted finding that the strike as such was illegal\nand, further, was unjustified, all the strikers should face\nthe penalty of dismissal or whether individual cases with\nspecial reference to active participation in the strike,\nshould be considered. A rapid but relevant glance at the\ndecided cases may yield dividends.\nIn\nIndia General\nNavigation and Railway Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen\n, (supra)\nthis court did observe that if a strike is illegal, it\ncannot be called 'perfectly justified'. But, between\n'perfectly justified' and 'unjustified' the neighbourhood is\ndistant. More illegality of the strike does not per se spell\nunjustifiability.\n\nFor, in\nCrompton Greaves Ltd. v. Workmen\n\n(supra) this Court held that even if a strike be illegal, it\ncannot be castigated as unjustified, unless the reasons for\nit are entirely perverse or unreasonable-an aspect which has\nto be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case.\nIn that decision, this Court awarded wages during the strike\nperiod because the Management failed to prove that the\nworkmen resorted to force and violence.\n\nEven in\nIndia\nGeneral Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd.\n(supra) where the\nstrike was illegal and affected a public utility service,\nthis Court observed that \"the only question of practical\nimportance which may arise in the case of an illegal strike,\nwould be the kind or quantum of punishment, and that, of\ncourse, has to be modulated in accordance with the facts and\ncircumstances of each case.... There may be reasons for\ndistinguishing the case of those who may have acted as mere\ndumb-driven cattle from those who have taken an active part\nin fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join\nsuch a strike or have taken recourse to violence.\" The court\nafter holding that the strike was illegal \"and that it was\nnot even justified\" made a pregnant observation :\n\n\"To determine the question of punishment, a clear\ndistinction has to be made between those workmen who\nare only joined in such a strike, but also took part in\nobstructing the loyal workmen from carrying on their\nwork, or took part in violent demonstrations, or acted\nin defiance of law and order, on the one hand, and\nthose workmen who were more or less silent\nparticipators in such a strike, on the other hand. It\nis not in the interest of the industry that there\nshould be a wholesale dismissal of all the workmen who\nmerely participated in such a strike. It is certainly\nnot in the\ninterest of the workmen themselves. An Industrial\nTribunal, therefore, has to consider the question of\npunishment, keeping in view the overriding\nconsideration of the full and efficient working of the\nIndustry as a whole. The punishment of dismissal or\ntermination of services, has, therefore, to be imposed\non such workmen as had not only participated in the\nillegal strike, but had fomented it, and had been\nguilty of violence or doing acts detrimental to the\nmaintenance of law and order in the locality where work\nhad to be carried on.\"\n\nAfter noticing the distinction between peaceful strikers and\nviolent strikers, Sinha, J.\n,\nin that case\n, observed \"it must\nbe clearly understood by those who take part in an illegal\nstrike that thereby they make themselves liable to be dealt\nwith by their employers. There may be reasons for\ndistinguishing the case of those who may have acted as mere\ndumb driven cattle from those who have taken an active part\nin fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join\nsuch a strike, or have taken recourse to violence.\" The same\nline of dichotomy is kept up :\n\n\"Both the types of workmen may have been equally\nguilty of participation in the illegal strike, but it\nis manifest that both are not liable to the same kind\nof punishment.\"\n\nSignificantly, the Court stressed the need for individual\nchargesheet being delivered to individual workmen so that\nthe degree of misconduct of each and the punitive deserts of\neach may be separately considered. We may as well refer to a\nfew more rulings since considerable argument was expended on\nthis point.\n\nThis Court in M/s.\nBurn & Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen &\nOrs.\n(1) clearly laid down that mere participation in the\nstrike would not justify the suspension or dismissal of\nworkmen particularly where no clear distinction can be made\nbetween those persons and the very large number of workmen\nwho had been taken back into service although they had\nparticipated in the strike.\n\nAfter referring to the ratio in\nM/s.\nBurn & Co. Ltd.\ncase, this Court in\nBata Shoe Co. (P)\nLtd. v. D. N. Ganguly & Ors.\n(2) observed that there is no\ndoubt that if an employer makes an unreasonable\ndiscrimination in the matter of taking back employees there\nmay in certain circumstances be reason for the industrial\ntribunal to interfere; but the circumstances\nof each case have to be examined before the tribunal can\ninterfere with the order of the employer in a properly held\nmanagerial inquiry on the ground of discrimination.\n\nThe\nCourt then proceeded to determine the facts placed before\nit. Sri Sen specifically pointed out that in the\nBata Shoe\nCo.\n's case this Court distinguished the decision in India\nGeneral Navigation & Railway Co. Ltd.'s and observed that\nthe decision\nin that case\nwas on the facts placed before the\nCourt.\n\nIn fact,\nBata Shoe Co.\n's case does not lay down any\ndistinct proposition about the treatment to be meted out to\nparticipants in strike and actually it is a decision on its\nown facts.\n\nIn\nThe Swadeshi Industries Ltd. v. Its Workmen\n(1), the\nManagement after holding that the strike was illegal,\nterminated the services of 230 workmen without framing any\nchargesheet or holding any enquiry. It was contended that\nthe strike was not legal. The Court observed that collective\nbargaining for securing improvement on matters like basic\npay, dearness allowance, bonus, provident fund and gratuity\nleave and holidays was the primary object of a trade union\nand when demands like these were put forward and thereafter\na strike was resorted to in an attempt to induce the company\nto agree to the demands or at least to open negotiations the\nstrike must prima facie be considered justified. As the\norder of termination was found to be illegal it was held\nthat reinstatement with back wages must follow as a matter\nof course, not necessarily because new hands had not been\ninducted.\n\nIn I. M. H. Press, Delhi v. Additional Industrial\nTribunal Delhi & Ors.,(2) this Court was called upon to\nexamine the ratio in Model Mills(3) case and\nIndia General\nNavigation & Railway Co. Ltd.\ncase and this Court in terms\naffirmed the ratio in\nIndia General Navigation & Railway Co.\nLtd.\ncase observing that mere taking part in an illegal\nstrike without anything further would not justify the\ndismissal of all the workmen taking part in the strike.\n\nIn\nIndian Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. & Anr. v. Their\nWorkmen\n(4), this Court observed that the management of a\nconcern has power to direct its own internal administration\nand discipline but the power is not unlimited and when a\ndispute arises, Industrial Tribunals have been given the\npower to see whether the termination of service\nof a workman is justified and to give appropriate relief. It\nmay be noticed that the decision is prior to introduction of\n\ns. 11A\n. It would thus appear that the important effect of\nomission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the\ntribunal would have to consider not only whether there was a\nprima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence\nadduced whether the charges have been made out. A defective\nenquiry in this connection stood on the same footing as no\nenquiry and in either case the tribunal would have\njurisdiction to go into the entire matter and the employer\nwould have to satisfy the tribunal that on the facts the\norder of dismissal or discharge was proper.\n\n(see\nWorkmen of\nMotipur Sugar Factory (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Motipur Sugar\nFactory\n(\n1), and Provincial Transport Service v. State\nIndustrial\nCourt) (2).\n\nOnce, therefore, it was held that the\nenquiry was not proper, it was irrelevant whether the\nworkman withdrew from the enquiry or participated in it, the\ndecision had to be on appraisal of evidence, and if it was\nfound that the enquiry was not proper the whole case was\nopen before the labour court to decide for itself whether\nthe charge of misconduct was proved and what punishment\nshould be awarded (see\nImperial Tabacco Company of India\nLtd. v. Its Workmen\n) (3).\n\nAs against the above propositions, Sri Sen relied upon\nthe observations of this Court in\nOriental Textile Finishing\nMills, Amritsar v. Labour\nCourt, Jullundur & Ors.(4). We\nfail to see how it runs counter to the established\nprinciple. The Court, in fact, held that even where the\nstrike is illegal, before any action was taken with a view\nto punishing the strikers a domestic enquiry must be held.\nEven though the Standing Orders prescribing enquiry before\npunishment did not provide for any such enquiry the Court\nheld that nonetheless a domestic enquiry should have been\nheld in order to entitle the management to dispense with the\nservice of the workmen on the ground of misconduct, viz.,\nparticipation in the illegal strike.\n\nAfter so saying, the\nCourt agreed with the view of the Court in\nIndian General\nNavigation & Railway Co. Ltd.\ncase and reaffirmed the\nprinciple that mere taking part in an illegal strike without\nanything further would not necessarily justify the dismissal\nof all the workers taking part in the strike and that if the\nemployer, before dismissing a workman, gave him sufficient\nopportunity of explaining his conduct and no question of\nmala fides or victimisation arose,\nit was not for the tribunal in adjudicating the propriety of\nsuch dismissal to look into the sufficiency or otherwise of\nthe evidence led before the enquiry officer or insist on the\nsame degree of proof as was required in a court of law, as\nif it were sitting in appeal over the decision of the\nemployer.\n\nAnother aspect of this case emphasised that it could\nnot be dogmatised as a matter of law that an overt act such\nas intimidation or instigation or violence was necessary in\norder to justify termination of service for participating in\nan illegal strike. On the facts of that case, even though it\nwas found that no domestic enquiry was held, reinstatement\nwas refused on the ground that misconduct was made out.\n\nSri Sen, of course, relied on this judgment to show\nthat where a strike was resorted to and the workers were\ncalled upon to join service within the stipulated time, on\ntheir failure it was open to the company to employ new\nhands. This is reading more into the ruling than is\nwarranted.\n\nWe cannot agree that mere failure to report for duty,\nwhen a strike is on, necessarily means misconduct. Many a\nworkman, as a matter of prudence, may not take the risk of\nfacing the militant workmen or the Management's hirelings\nfor fear, especially when there is evidence in the case from\nthe Sabha that the Management had hired goondas and from the\nManagement that the striking vanguard was violent. It is\nalso possible, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,\nthat several workmen might not be posted with the\nManagement's notice of recall or the terms on which they\nwere being recalled. In this view, we are not able to uphold\nthe conclusion of the arbitrator that the punishment of\ndismissal was appropriate for the entire mass of workmen\nwhose only guilt, as proved was nothing more than passive\nparticipation in the illegal and unjustified strike by not\nreporting for duty. The verdict is inevitable that the\ndischarge is wrongful.\n\nThe only comment we reluctantly make about the\notherwise thorough award of the Arbitrator is that omnibus\nrhetoric about the obnoxious behaviour of a class may not\nmake-do for hard proof of specific acts of particular\npersons where a punitive jurisdiction is exercised.\n\nWhat, then, is the normal rule in the case of wrongful\ndismissal when the workmen claim reinstatement with full\nback wages ? The High Court has held the discharge wrongful\nand directed restoration\nwith an equitable amount of back wages. The following\nrulings of this Court, et al, deal with this subject :\n\nThe recent case of\nHindustan Tin Works v. Its Employees\n\n(1) sets out the rule on reinstatement and back wages when\nthe order of this Court, et al, deal with this subject :\n\n\"It is no more open to debate that in the field of\nindustrial jurisprudence a declaration can be given\nthat the termination of service is bad and the workman\ncontinues to be in service. The spectre of common law\ndoctrine that contract of personal service cannot be\nspecifically enforced or the doctrine of mitigation of\ndamages does not haunt this branch of law. The relief\nof reinstatement with continuity of service can be\ngranted where termination of service is found to be\ninvalid. It would mean that the employer has taken away\nillegally the right to work of the workman contrary to\nthe relevant law or in breach of contract and\nsimultaneously deprived the workman of his earnings. If\nthus the employer is found to be in the wrong as a\nresult of which the workman is directed to be\nreinstated, the employer could not shirk his\nresponsibility of paying the wages which the workmen\nhas been deprived of by the illegal or invalid action\nof the employer. Speaking realistically, where\ntermination of service is questioned as invalid or\nillegal and the workman has to go through the gamut of\nlitigation, his capacity to sustain himself throughout\nthe protracted litigation is itself such an awesome\nfactor that he may not survive to see the day when\nlaw's proverbial delay has become stupefying. If after\nsuch a protracted time and energy consuming litigation\nduring which period the workman just sustains himself,\nultimately he is to be told that though he will be\nreinstated, he will be denied the back wages which\nwould be due to him, the workman would be subjected to\na sort of penalty for no fault of his and it is wholly\nundeserved. Ordinarily therefore, a workman whose\nservice has been illegally terminated would be entitled\nto full back wages except to the extent he was\ngainfully employed during the enforced idleness. That\nis the normal rule. Any other view would be a premium\non the unwarranted litigative activity of the employer.\nIf the employer terminates the service illegally and\nthe termination is motivated as in this\ncase, viz., to resist the workmen's demand for revision\nof wages, the termination may well amount to unfair\nlabour practice. In such circumstances reinstatement\nbeing the normal rule it should be followed with full\nback wages.\nArticles 41\nand\nof the Constitution\nwould assist us in reaching a just conclusion in this\nrespect.............. In the very nature of things\nthere cannot be a strait-jacket formula for awarding\nrelief of back wages. All relevant considerations will\nenter the verdict. More or less, it would be a motion\naddressed to the discretion of the Tribunal. Full back\nwages would be the normal rule and the party objecting\nto it must establish the circumstances necessitating\ndeparture. At that stage the Tribunal will exercise its\ndiscretion keeping in view all the relevant\ncircumstances.\"\n\nDealing with the complex of considerations bearing on\npayment of back wages the new perspective emerging from\nArt.\n43A\ncannot be missed, as explained in Hindustan Tin Works,\nLabour is no more a mere factor in production but a partner\nin Industry, conceptually speaking, and less than full back\nwages is a sacrifice by those who can best afford and cannot\nbe demanded by those, who least sacrifice their large\n'wages' though can best afford, if financial constraint is\nthe ground urged by the latter (Management) as inability to\npay full back pay to the former. The morality of law and the\nconstitutional mutation implied in\nArt. 43A\nbring about a\nnew equation in industrial relations. Anyway, in the\n\nHindustan Tin Works\n' case 75 per cent of the past wages was\ndirected to be paid. Travelling over the same ground by\ngoing through every precedent is supererogatory and we hold\nthe rule is simple that the discretion to deny reinstatement\nor pare down the quantum of back wages is absent save for\nexceptional reasons.\n\nIt must be added however that particular circumstances\nof each case may induce the court to modify the direction in\nregard to the quantum of back wages payable as happened in\nthe India General Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. vs. Their\nWorkmen (Supra). We may, therefore, have to consider, when\nfinally moulding the relief, what, in this case, we should\ndo regarding reinstatement and back wages.\nA Sum-up\nWe may now crystallise our conclusions in the light of\nthe long discussion. The basic assumption we make is that\nthe strike was not only illegal but also unjustified. On the\nlatter part, a contrary\nview cannot be ruled out in the circumstances present but we\ndo not reinvestigate the issue since the High Court has\nproceeded on what both sides have taken for granted. The\nManagement, in our view, did punish its 853 workmen when it\ndischarged them for reasons of misconduct set out in\nseparate but integrated proceedings, even though, with legal\nfinesse, the formal order was phrased in harmless verbalism.\nBut fine words butter no parsnips, and law, in its\nintelligent honesty, must be blunt and when it sees a spade,\nmust call it a spade. The action taken under the general law\nor the standing orders, was illegal in the absence of\nindividualised chargesheets, proper hearing and personalised\npunishment, if found guilty. None of these steps having been\ntaken, the discharge orders were still born. But the\nManagement could, as in this case it did, offer to make out\nthe delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had, in\nsuch cases, the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both\nguilt and punishment. We hold that\nsec. 11A\ndoes take in an\narbitrator too, and, in this case, the arbitral reference,\napart from\nsec. 11A\n, is plenary in scope.\n\nIn the second chapter of our sum-up, the first thing we\ndecide is that\nArt. 226\n, however restrictive in practice, is\na power wide enough, in all conscience, to be a friend in\nneed when the summons comes in a crisis from a victim of\ninjustice; and, more importantly, this extraordinary reserve\npower is unsheathed to grant final relief without necessary\nrecourse to a remand. What the tribunal may, in its\ndiscretion, do, the High Court too, under\nArt. 226\n, can, if\nfacts compel, do. Secondly, we hold that the Award suffers\nfrom a fundamental flaw that it equates an illegal and\nunjustified strike with brazen misconduct by every workman\nwithout so much as identification of the charge against\neach, the part of each, the punishment for each, after\nadverting to the gravamen of his misconduct meriting\ndismissal. Passive participation in a strike which is both\nillegal and unjustified does not ipso facto invite dismissal\nor punitive discharge. There must be active individual\nexcess such as master-minding the unjustified aspects of the\nstrike, e.g., violence, sabotage or other reprehensible\nrole. Absent such gravamen in the accusation, the extreme\neconomic penalty of discharge is wrong. An indicator of the\nabsence of such grievous guilt is that the Management, after\nstating in strong terms all the sins of the workmen, took\nback over 400 of them as they trickled back slowly and\nbeyond the time set, with continuity of service, suggestive\nof the dubiety of the inflated accusations and awareness of\nthe minor role of the mass of workmen in the Engineers\nstrike. Furthermore, even though all sanctions short of\npunitive discharge may be employed by a Management, in our\ncurrent conditions of massive unemployment, low wages and\nhigh cost of living, dismissal of several hundreds, with\ndisastrous impact on numerous families, is of such sensitive\nsocial concern that, save in exceptional situations, the law\nwill inhibit such a lethal step for the peace of the\nIndustry, the welfare of the workmen and the broader justice\nthat transcends transient disputes. The human dimensions\nhave decisional relevance. We hold the discharge orders,\nthough approved by the Arbitrator, invalid.\n\nThe last part of our conclusions relates to the relief\nwhich must be fashioned with an eye on mutual equities. We\ncannot ignore a few raw realities since law is not dogmatics\nbut pragmatics, without temporising on principle. The\nManagement's limitations in absorbing all the large number\nof discharged employees all at once when, steel, the raw\nmaterial, is scarce, is a problem. Likewise, their inability\nto pay huge sums by way of back wages or otherwise, without\ncrippling the progress of the industry, cannot be overlooked\nbut cannot be overplayed after Hindustan Tin Works. Another\nfactor which cannot be wished away is the presence of over a\ncouple of hundred workmen, with varying lengths of service,\nwho may have to be sacked if the old workmen are to be\nbrought back. It is a problem of humanist justice. Lastly,\nthe rugged fact of life must not be missed that some of the\nworkmen during the long years of desperate litigation, might\nhave sought jobs elsewhere and most of them perhaps have,\nfor sheer survival, made at least a starving wage during the\nprolonged idle interval. This factor too is a weak\nconsideration, tested by the reasoning in Hindustan Tin\nWorks. Moreover, rationalisation of re-absorption of the\nremoved workmen requires attention to the classification of\npermanent workmen and their casual counterparts. Every\nproposal must be bottomed on the basic economic fact that\nthe beneficiaries are from the many below the destitution\nline. This Court has, in a very different context though,\nhas drawn attention to the Gandhian guideline:\n\n\"Whenever you are in doubt .. apply the following test.\nRecall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom\nyou may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you\ncontemplate is going to be of any use of him.\"\n\nIt is apt here.\n\nThis perspective informs our decision. What did the\nHigh Court do regarding reinstatement and should we modify\nand why? If the discharge is bad, reinstatement is the rule.\nIn India General Navi-\ngation, Punjab National Bank and Swadeshi Industries, et al,\nrestoration, despite large numbers, was directed. But most\nrules have exceptions wrought by the pressure of life and\nOriental, was relied on to contend that reinstatement must\nbe denied. There is force in the High Court's reasoning to\ndistinguish Oriental, as we hinted earlier and we quote:\n\n\"There were only 22 workmen involved in that case. The\nmanagement had made genuine and persistent efforts to\npersuade the concerned workmen to call of the strike\nand join work. Those efforts were made at three\ndifferent stages, namely, (1) immediately after the\nworkers went on the lightening strike and before\nchargesheets were issued, (2) after the charges were\ndropped and individual notices were sent to the workmen\nasking them to resume work by specified dates and (3)\nafter the orders of termination were served and\nconciliation proceedings were commenced pursuant to the\ndemand notice. But this is not all. Even the Labour\nOfficer and Labour Inspector had tried to persuade the\nconcerned workmen to joint duty before the charge-sheet\ncame to be issued. As against these repeated bona fide\nattempts on the part of the management and an outside\nagency to persuade the erring workmen, they not only\ndid not resume work but also failed to acknowledge or\nsend a reply to the individual notices served upon them\nrequesting them to resume work and they appear to have\nmade it a condition precedent to their joining duty\nthat the suspended workmen should also be taken back.\nEven under such circumstances, the management did not\nstraightaway terminate their services but gave\nindividual notices requiring the concerned workmen to\nshow cause why their names should not be struck off and\nasked them to submit their reply by a certain date.\nEven those notices were not replied. It is only\nthereafter that the services of the concerned workmen\ncame to be terminated. It is against this background\nthat the Supreme Court held that there was \"a\npersistent and obdurate refusal by the workmen to joint\nduty\" notwithstanding the fact that \"the management has\ndone everything possible to persuade them and give them\nopportunities to come back to work\" and that they had\nwithout any sufficient cause refused to do so which\nconstituted \"misconduct\" so as to 'justify the\ntermination of their services\".\n\"....If the workmen had been approached individually,\nnot only those amongst them who were unwilling to join\nstrike but were prevented from joining work would have\ntaken courage to resume duty but even those amongst\nthem who were undecided could also have been won over.\nThat apart, those notices, as their contents disclose,\nwere hardly persuasive efforts. They were a mixture of\nultimatums, threats, complaints and indictment of the\nworkmen and the Sabha. Was it, therefore, a genuine\neffort on the part of a keenly desirous employer to\noffer an olive branch? In Oriental, orders of\ntermination were passed only after giving individual\nnotices to the concerned workmen to showcause why their\nnames should not be struck off. Besides, those notices\nwere given after charges formally served upon each\nworkmen earlier were dropped and persuasive efforts\nmade in the meantime had failed. None of those steps\nwas taken herein. All that happened was that in one of\nthe notices meant for mass consumption and circulation,\nsuch intimation was given.\"\n\nEven so, during the several years of the pendency of\nthe dispute, surely some workmen would have secured\nemployment elsewhere as was conceded by counsel at a certain\nstage, and it is not equitable to recall them merely to\nvindicate the law especially when new workmen already in\nprecarious service may have to be evicted to accommodate\nthem. In the course of the debate at the Bar we gained the\nimpression that somewhere around a hundred workmen are\nlikely to be alternatively employed. Hopefully, there is no\nhazard in this guess.\n\nAnother, facet of the relief turns on the demand for\nfull back wages. Certainly, the normal rule, on\nreinstatement, is full back wages since the order of\ntermination is non est. [see Lad's case(1) and Panitole Tea\nEstate's case(2)]. Even so, the industrial court may well\nslice off a part if the workmen are not wholly blameless or\nthe strike is illegal and unjustified. To what extent wages\nfor the long interregnum should be paid is, therefore, a\nvariable dependent on a complex of circumstances. [See for\ne.g. 1967 (15) F.L.R. 395 paras 3 and 4].\n\nWe are mindful of the submission of Sri Tarkunde, urged\nin the connected appeal by the Sabha, that where no enquiry\nhas preceded\na punitive discharge and the tribunal, for the first time,\nupholds the punishment this Court has in D. C. Roy v. The\npresiding Officer, Madhya Pradesh Industrial Court, Indore &\nOrs.(1) taken the view that full wages must be paid until\nthe date of the award. There cannot be any relation back of\nthe date of dismissal to when the Management passed the void\norder.\n\nKalyani(2) was cited to support the view of relation\nback of the Award to the date of the employer's termination\norders. We do not agree that the ratio of Kalyani\ncorroborates the proposition propounded. Jurisprudentially,\napproval is not creative but confirmatory and therefore\nrelates back. A void dismissal is just void and does not\nexist. If the Tribunal, for the first time, passes an order\nrecording a finding of misconduct and thus breathes life\ninto the dead shall of the Management's order, predating of\nthe nativity does not arise. The reference to Sasa Musa in\nKalyani enlightens this position. The latter case of\nD. C.\nRoy v. The Presiding Officer, Madhya Pradesh Industrial\n\nCourt,\nIndore & Ors.\n(supra) specifically refers to\nKalyani's case and Sasa Musa's case and holds that where the\nManagement discharges a workmen by an order which is void\nfor want of an enquiry or for blatant violation of rules of\nnatural justice, the relation-back doctrine cannot be\ninvoked. The jurisprudential difference between a void\norder, which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes\ninto being de novo, and an order, which may suffer from some\ndefects but is not still born or void and all that is needed\nin the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a\ntribunal which is granted, cannot be obfuscated.\n\nWe agree that the law stated in D. C. Roy (supra) is\ncorrect but now that the termination orders are being set\naside, the problem does not present itself directly. Even\nthe other alternative submission of Sri Tarkunde that if the\nplea of the Management that the order is a discharge\nsimpliciter were to be accepted, the result is a\nretrenchment within the meaning of\ns. 2(00)\nwhich, in this\ncase, is in violation of\ns. 25F\nand therefore bad, is not a\npoint urged earlier. We are disposed to stand by the view\nthat discharge, even where it is not occasioned by a surplus\nof hands, will be retrenchment, having regard to the breadth\nof the definition and its annotation in 1977 1 SCR 586. But\nthe milieu in which the order was passed in February 1973 is\nnot fully available, viewed from this new angle. So we\ndecline to go into that contention.\nFinal Relief\nWe are concerned with 400 workmen, some of whom have\nbeen claimed by death or other irreversible causes-\ncasualties of litigative longevity ! are 370 workmen are\nleft behind, of whom 239 are admittedly permanent. We have\nalready stated that 100, out of them, are probably fixed up\nelsewhere. So, we exclude them and direct that the remaining\n139 alone will be reinstated. A list of the aforesaid 100\nworkmen will be furnished to the Management by the Sabha\nwithin two weeks from today. That shall be accepted as\ncorrect and final.\n\nWhile reinstatement is refused for these 100 workmen,\nwhen shall they be deemed to have ceased to be in service\nfor drawal of terminal benefits ? Their discharge orders\nhaving been quashed, they remain in service until today. We\nconcluded the arguments on August 3, 1979 and on the eve of\nthe closure of counsel's submissions certain inconclusive\nsettlement proposals were discussed. We, therefore, consider\nAugust 3, 1979 as a pivotal point in the calender with\nreference to which the final relief may be moulded. We\ndirect that the 100 workmen for whom reinstatement is being\nrefused will be treated as in service until August 3, 1979\non which date they will be deemed to have been retrenched.\nWe direct this step with a view to pragmatise the situation\nin working out the equities. These 100 will draw all\nterminal benefits plus 75 per cent of the back wages. This\nscaling down of back pay is consistent with the assumption\nthat somewhere in the past they had secured alternative\nemployment. The long years and the large sum payable also\npersuade us to make this minor cut. Of course, in addition,\nthey will be entitled to retrenchment benefits under\ns. 25F\n\nof the Act, and one month's notice pay.\n\nThe remaining 139 will be awarded 50 per cent of the\nback wages since we are restoring them. The High Court has\nadopted this measure and so we do not depart from it. The\ncase of the hundred stands on a slightly different footing,\nbecause some compensation in lieu of refusal of\nreinstatement is due to them and that also has entered our\nreckoning while fixing 75 per cent for them. The computation\nof the wages will be such as they would have drawn had they\ncontinued in service and on that the cut directed will be\napplied.\n\nWe have disposed of the case of the permanent workmen\nexcept to clarify that in their case continuity of service\nwill be maintained and accrual of benefits on that footing\nreckoned. The next category relates to casual employees, 131\nin number of whom 57 have less\nthan nine months' service. The policy of the Act draws a\ndistinction between those with service of 240 days and more\nand others with less. The casuals with less than nine months\nservice are 57 in number and we do not think that this\nfugitive service should qualify for reinstatement especially\nwhen we find a number of intermediate recruits, with longer\nthough untenable service, have to be baled out. We decline\nreinstatement of these 57 hands. The other 74 must be\nreinstated although nationally but wrongly they are shown as\ncasual. In the 'life' sense, all mortals are casuals but in\nthe legal sense, those with a record of 240 days on the\nrolls, are a class who have rights under industrial law. We\ndirect the 74 long-term casuals aforesaid to be reinstated\nbut not the 57 short-term ones. To this extent, we vary the\nHigh Court's order.\n\nWe adopt the directive of the High Court regarding the\nback wages to both categories of casuals except that for the\nlesser class of 57 casuals, a flat sum of 1000/- more will\nbe paid as a token compensation in lieu of reinstatement.\nThe reinstated casuals (74 of them) will be put back as\ncasuals but will be confirmed within six months from the\ndate of rejoining since it is meaningless to keep them as\ncasual labourers when they are, by sheer length of service,\non the regular rolls.\n\nTwo issues remain When are the workmen to be retaken\nand what is to happen in the meanwhile ? How is the amount\npayable by the Management to be discharged and on what terms\n? Many years have flowed by, thanks to the long-drawn-out\nlitigation. Further delay in putting back the workers will\nbe unfair. But the Management pleads that steel shortage\ncuts into the flesh of the factory's expansion, without\nwhich additional intake of workers is beyond their budget\nunless considerable time for reabsorption were given. But\nthe lot of the workmen is unspeakable while the overall\nassets and outlook of the Company are commendable enough to\nbear an increased wage bill. Divas cannot complain when\nLazarus asks for more crumbs. Even if a slight slant be made\nin favour of the Management, the direction to them to take\nback, in order of seniority, the first 70 out of the 139\npermanent workmen on or before December 31, 1979 and the\nrest on or before March 31, 1980 is the least that is just.\nUntil those dates the workmen will be paid 2/3rd of their\nwages as now due. Of course, if any workmen fails to report\nfor work within 15 days of service of written notice to him,\nwith simultaneous copy to the Sabha, he will not be eligible\nfor any more reinstatement or wages.\nThe back wages run into a large sum but a good part has\nbeen paid under the stay order of this Court. We make it\nclear that the payments made will be given credit and the\nbalance if paid as directed below and within the time\nspecified will not carry interest. If default is made, the\nsums in default will carry 10 per cent interest.\n\nThe figures of amounts due will be worked out by both\nsides and put into Court in 10 days from now. Half the\namount determined by the Court, after perusing both\nstatements, will be paid directly to the workmen or\ndeposited with the Industrial Tribunal who will give notice\nand make disbursements, on or before 31-3-1980 and the other\nhalf on or before 30-9-1980.\n\nThe conclusions may be capsulated for easier\nconsumption.\n\n1. Out of 370 workmen directed to be reinstated by the\nHigh Court, 239 are permanent. It is assumed that 100 have\nfound alternative employment and are not interested any more\nin reinstatement and they are to be excluded from the\ndirection of reinstatement. The Company must, therefore,\nreinstate 139 permanent workmen and the list of 100 workmen\nwho are not to be reinstated would be supplied by the Sabha\nwithin two weeks from the date of this judgment. The\ndischarge order in respect of 100 workmen herein-before\nmentioned would be set aside and they are deemed to be in\nservice till August 3, 1979, when they will be retrenched\nand they will be paid retrenchment compensation as provided\nin\ns. 25F\nplus one month's pay in lieu of notice, the\ncompensation to be worked out on the basis of the wages that\nwill be admissible under the recommendations of the\nEngineering Wage Board as applicable to the Company. This\namount will be paid in lieu of reinstatement and they will\nalso be paid 75 per cent of the back wages.\n\n2. The remaining 139 permanent employees would be paid\n50 per cent of the back wages as directed by the High Court.\n\n3. 70 out of 139 permanent workmen directed to be\nreinstated should be provided actual employment on or before\nDecember 31, 1979, and the rest on or before March 31, 1980.\nDuring this period and till the actual reinstatement each\none of these 139 workmen should be paid 2/3 of the monthly\nwages from August 9, 1979, when the hearing in this case\nconcluded. 50 per cent of the amount that becomes payable to\neach workmen under the directions herein above given will be\npaid on or before March 31, 1980, and the balance on or\nbefore September 30, 1980, and till then the amount will\ncarry interest at the rate of 10 per cent.\n4. In respect of casual workmen whose service was less\nthan 9 months on the date of dismissal it would not be\nproper to grant reinstatement. They are 57 in number. The\nremaining casual workmen 74 in number shall be reinstated.\nIn case of 57 casual workmen to whom reinstatement is\nrefused, the direction of the High Court is confirmed with\nthe further addition that each one will be paid Rs. 1,000/-\nover and above the amount payable under the direction of the\nHigh Court and this would be in lieu of reinstatement.\nCasual workmen 74 in number and having service of more than\n9 months on the date of dismissal will be treated as\nconfirmed within six months of the date of their rejoining\nand they will be offered reinstatement by March 31, 1980,\nand the High Court's direction for back wages in their\nrespect in confirmed.\n\nWith these modifications, we dismiss both the appeals.\nThe Management-appellant will pay the costs of the Sabha-\nrespondent, advocates fee being fixed at Rs. 5,000/-.\nAn Afterword\nThis litigation, involving many workmen living\nprecariously on post-wages amidst agonising inflation and a\nManagement whose young budget, what with steel scarcity, may\nwell be shaken by the burden of arrears, points to the\nchronic pathology of our Justice System-the intractable and\nescalating backlog in the Forensic Assembly Line that slowly\nspins Injustice out of Justice and effectually wears down or\nkeeps out the weaker sector of Indian life. This truma is\nfelt more poignantly in Labour litigation and the\nlegislature fails functionally if it dawdles to radicalise,\nstreamline and simplify the conflict resolution procedures\nso as to be credibly available to the common people who make\nup the lower bracket of the nation. The stakes are large,\nthe peril is grave, the evils are worse than the prognostics\nof Prof. Lawrence Tribe (of the Harvard Law School) :\n\n\"If court backlogs grow at their present\nrate, Our children may not be able to bring a lawsuit\nto a conclusion within their lifetime.

The parties are admittedly governed by the\n\nIndustrial Employment (Standing Orders Act, 1946\n(hereafter\nreferred to as the \"S.O. Act\"\nsection 15(2)\nof which\nempowers the appropriate Government to make rules, inter\nalia setting out model standing orders for the purposes of\nthat Act. The expression 'standing orders' is defined in\nsection 2(g) of the S.O. Act to mean rules relating to the\nmatters set out in the schedule thereto, items 8 and 9 of\nwhich run thus :\n\n\"8. Termination of employment, and the notice\ntherefor to be given by the employer and workmen.\n\"9. Suspension or dismissal for misconduct and\nacts or omissions which constitute misconduct.\"\n\nThe appropriate Government (in this case the Government\nof Gujarat) has prescribed Model Standing Orders (M.S.Os.\nfor short) under section 15(2) of the S.O. Act. The relevant\npart of M.S.O. 23 is extracted below :\n\n\"23. (1) Subject to the provisions of the\nIndustrial disputes Act, 1947, the employment of a\npermanent workman employed on rates other than the\nmonthly rates of wages may be terminated by giving him\nfourteen days' notice or by payment of thirteen days'\nwages (including all admissible allowances) in lieu of\nnotice.\n\n\"(2)................................\n\"(3)................................\n\"(4) The employment of a permanent workman\nemployed on the monthly rates of wages may be\nterminated by giving him one month's notice or on\npayment of one month's wages (including all admissible\nallowances) in lieu of notice.\n\n\"(4-A) The reasons for the termination of service\nof a permanent workman shall be recorded in writing and\ncommunicated to him, if he so desires, at the time of\ndischarge, unless such communication, in the opinion of\nthe Manager, is likely directly or indirectly to lay\nany person open to civil or criminal proceedings at the\ninstance of the workman.\n\n\"(5)....................................\n\"(6)....................................\n\"(7) All classes of workmen other than those\nappointed on a permanent basis may leave their service\nor their service may be terminated without or pay in\nlieu of notice : Provided that services of a temporary\nworkman shall not be terminated as a punishment unless\nhe has been given an opportunity of explaining the\ncharges of misconduct alleged against him in the manner\nprescribed in Standing Order 25.\n\n\"(8).....................................\n\"(9)....................................\"\nM.S.O. 24 enumerates 25 kinds of acts or omissions on\nthe part of a workman which amount to misconduct. Clauses\n\n(a) and (b) of the M.S.O. describe two of such acts thus :\n\n\"(a) willful insubordination or disobedience,\nwhether or not in combination with another,\nof any lawful and reasonable order of a\nsuperior;\n\n(b) going on illegal strike or abetting,\ninciting, instigating or acting in\nfurtherance thereof;\"\n\nM.S.O. 25 lays down the manner in which a workman\nguilty of misconduct may be dealt with. It states :\n\n\"25. (1) A workman guilty of misconduct may be -\n\n(a)............................................\n\n(b)............................................\n\n(c)............................................\n\n(d)............................................\n\n(e).............................................\n\n(f) discharged under Order 23;\n\n(g) dismissed without notice.\n\n\"(2)............................................\n\"(3) No order of dismissal under sub-clause (g) of\nclause (1) shall be made except after holding an\ninquiry against the workman concerned in respect of the\nalleged misconduct in the manner set forth in clause\n(4).\n\n\"(4) A workman against whom an inquiry has been\nheld shall be given a charge-sheet clearly setting\nforth the circumstances appearing against him and\nrequiring explanation. He shall be given an opportunity\nto answer the charge and permitted to be defended by a\nworkman working in the same department as himself.\n\nExcept for reasons to be recorded in writing by the\nofficer holding the inquiry, the workman shall be\npermitted to produce witnesses, in his defence and\ncross-examine any witnesses on whose evidence the\ncharge rests. A concise summary of the evidence led on\neither side and the workman's plea shall be recorded.\n\n\"(5) .............................................. .\"\n\nClauses (3) and (4) of M.S.O. 25 speak of an inquiry\nonly in the case of an order falling under sub-clause (g) of\nclause (1) of\nthat M.S. It is thus quite clear (and this is not disputed)\nthat the only sub-clause of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25 to which\nthe provisions of clauses (3) and (4) of that M.S.O. would\nbe attracted is sub-clause (g) and that if an order of\ndischarge falls under M.S.O. 23 an inquiry under clauses (3)\nand (4) of M.S.O. 25 would not be a prerequisite thereto\neven though such an order is mentioned in subclause (f) of\nclause (1) of that M.S.O. And that is why it has been\nvehemently urged on behalf of the workmen who were\ndischarged en masse and who were not taken back by the\nManagement that the orders of discharge made in relation to\nthem amount really to orders of dismissal and are bad in law\nby reason of the fact that no inquiry of the type above\nmentioned was held before they were passed.\n\n3. Under M.S.Os. 23 and 25 the Management has the power\nto effect termination of the services of an employee by\nhaving recourse to either of them. In action taken under\nM.S.O. 23 no element of punishment is involved and the\ndischarge is a discharge simpliciter; and that is why no\nopportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against\nthe termination is provided for. Dismissal, however, which\nan employer may order, is, in its very nature, a punishment,\nthe infiction of which therefore has been made subject to\nthe result of an inquiry (having the semblance of a trial in\na criminal proceeding). Exercise of each of the two powers\nhas the effect of the termination of the services of the\nconcerned employee but must be regarded, because of the\nmanner in which each has been dealt with by the M.S.Os., as\nseparate and distinct from the other.\n\n4. It was vehemently argued on behalf of the workmen\nthat once it was proved that the order of discharge of a\nworkman was passed by reason of a misconduct attributed to\nhim by the management, the order cannot but amount to an\norder of dismissal. But this argument, to my mind, is wholly\nwithout substance, and that for two reasons. For one thing,\nclause (1) of M.S.O. 25 specifically states in sub-clause\n\n(f) that a workman guilty of misconduct may be discharged\nunder M.S.O. 23. This clearly means that when the employer\nis satisfied that a workman has been guilty of misconduct,\nhe may (apart from visiting the workman with any of the\npunishments specified in sub-clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and\n\n(e) of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25) either pass against him an\norder of discharge for which no inquiry precedent as\nprovided for in clauses (3) and (4) of M.S.O. 25 would be\nnecessary, or, may dismiss him after holding such an\ninquiry. Which of the two kinds of order the employer shall\npass is left entirely to his own discretion.\nIt is true that the employer cannot pass a real order\nof dismissal in the garb of one of discharge. But that only\nmeans that if the order of termination of services of an\nemployee is in reality intended to punish an employee and\nnot merely to get rid of him because he is considered\nuseless, inconvenient or troublesome, the order, even though\nspecified to be an order of discharge, would be deemed to be\nan order of dismissal covered by sub-clause (g) of clause\n(1) of M.S.O. 25. On the other hand if no such intention is\nmade out, the order would remain one of discharge\nsimpliciter even though it has been passed for the sole\nreason that a misconduct is imputed to the employee. That is\nhow, in my opinion, M.S.Os. 23 and 25 have to be\ninterpreted. The argument that once an alleged misconduct is\nshown to have been the motive for the passage of an order of\ndischarge, the same would immediately and without more,\namount to an order of dismissal, is not warranted by the\nlanguage used in M.S.O. 25 which specifically gives to the\nemployer the power to get rid of \"a workman guilty of\nmisconduct\" by passing an order of his discharge under\nM.S.O. 23.\n\n5. Secondly, the reasons for the termination of service\nof a permanent workman under M.S.O. 23 have to be recorded\nin writing and communicated to him, if he so desires, under\nclause 4-A) thereof. Such reasons must obviously consist of\nan opinion derogatory to the workman in relation to the\nperformance of his duties; and whether such reasons consist\nof negligence, work-shirking or of serious overt acts like\ntheft or embezzlement, they would in any case amount to\nmisconduct for which he may be punished under M.S.O. 25. It\nis difficult to conceive of a case in which such reasons\nwould not amount to misconduct. The result is that M.S.O. 23\nwould be rendered otiose if termination of service\nthereunder for misconduct could be regarded as a dismissal\nand such a result strikes at the very root of accepted\ncanons of interpretation. If it was open to the Court to\n\"lift the veil\" and to hold an order of discharge to amount\nto a dismissal merely because the motive behind it was a\nmisconduct attributed to the employee, the services of no\nemployee could be terminated without holding against him an\ninquiry such as is contemplated by clauses (3) and (4) of\nM.S.O. 25.\n\n6. The interpretation placed by me on M.S.Os. 23 and 25\nfinds ample support in Bombay Corporation v. Malvankar(1) of\nwhich the\nfacts are on all fours with those in the present case. Miss\nP. S. Malvankar, respondent No. 1 in that case, was a clerk\nin the employment or the Bombay Electric Supply and\nTransport Undertaking which was being run by the Bombay\nCorporation. Her services were terminated on the ground that\nher record of service was unsatisfactory. It was however\nstated in the order of termination of her services that she\nwould be paid one month's wages in lieu of notice and would\nalso be eligible for all the benefits as might be admissible\nunder the Standing Orders and Service Regulations of the\nUndertaking. Those Standing Orders correspond to the\nstanding orders with which we are here concerned.\nThereunder, two powers were conferred on the employer, one\nbeing a power to impose punishment for misconduct following\na disciplinary inquiry under clause (2) of Standing Order 21\nread with Standing Order 23 and the other one to terminate\nthe service of the employee by one calendar month's written\nnotice or pay in lieu thereof under Standing Order 26. The\nquestion arose as to which power had been exercised by the\nemployer in the case of Miss Malvankar and Jaswant Singh,\nJ., delivering the judgment of the Court on behalf of\nhimself and Bhagwati, J., was answering that question when\nhe made the observations reproduced from his decision by my\nlearned brother Iyer, J. This Court was then clearly of the\nopinion that-\n\n(a) the power to terminate the services by an order of\ndischarge simpliciter is distinct from and\nindependent of the power to punish for misconduct\nand the Standing Orders cannot be construed so as\nto render either of these powers ineffective; and\n\n(b) reasons for termination have to be communicated to\nthe employee and those reasons cannot be\narbitrary, capricious or irrelevant but that would\nnot mean that the order of termination becomes\npunitive in character just because good reasons\nare its basis.\n\nThe Court further remarked that if the misconduct of the\nemployee constituted the foundation for terminating his\nservice then it might be liable to be regarded as punitive\nbut this proposition was doubted inasmuch as \"even in such\ncase it may be argued that the management has not punished\nthe employee but has merely terminated his service under\nStanding Order 26\".\n\n7. So all that remains to be determined in this\nconnection is as to when would misconduct be the\n`foundation' of an order of dis-\ncharge. Merely because it is the reason which weighed with\nthe employer in effecting the termination of services would\nnot make the order of such termination as one founded on\nmisconduct, for, such a proposition would run counter to the\nplain meaning of clause (1) of M.S.O. 25. For an order to be\n`founded' on misconduct, it must, in my opinion, be intended\nto have been passed by way of punishment, that is, it must\nbe intended to chastise or cause pain in body or mind or\nharm or loss in reputation or money to the concerned worker.\nIf such an intention cannot be spelled out of the prevailing\ncircumstances, the order of discharge or the reasons for\nwhich it was ostensibly passed, it cannot be regarded as an\norder of dismissal. Such would be the case when the employer\norders discharge in the interests of the factory or of the\ngeneral body of workers themselves. That this is what was\nreally meant by the judicial precedents which use the word\n`foundation' in connection with the present controversy\nfinds support from a number of decisions of this Court.\nIn\n\nThe Chartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank, Employees'\nUnion\n(1) this Court held that if the termination of service\nis a colourable exercise of the power vested in the\nmanagement or is a result of victimization or unfair labour\npractice, the Industrial Tribunal will have jurisdiction to\nintervene and set aside such termination. Applying this\nprinciple to the facts of the case before it, this Court\nruled :\n\n\"We are satisfied that the management has passed\nthe order of termination simpliciter and the order does\nnot amount to one of dismissal as and by way of\npunishment\" (emphasis supplied).\n\nThis case was followed in\nThe Tata Oil Mills Co., Ltd.,\nv. Workmen\n(2) where Gajendragadkar, C.J., who delivered the\njudgment of the Court, stated the law thus :\n\n\"The true legal position about the Industrial\nCourts' jurisdiction and authority in dealing with\ncases of this kind is no longer in doubt. It is true\nthat in several cases, contract of employment or\nprovisions in Standing Orders authorise an industrial\nemployer to terminate the service of his employees\nafter giving notice for one month on paying salary for\none month in lieu of notice, and normally, an employer\nmay, in a proper case, be entitled to exercise the said\npower. But where an order of discharge passed by an\nemployer gives rise to an industrial dispute, the form\nof the order by which the employees' services are\nterminated, would not be decisive; industrial\nadjudication would be entitled to examine the substance\nof the matter and decide whether the termination is in\nfact discharge simpliciter or it amounts to dismissal\nwhich has put on the cloak of a discharge simpliciter.\nIf the Industrial Court is satisfied that the order of\ndischarge is punitive, that it is mala fide, or that it\namounts to victimization or unfair labour practice, it\nis competent to the Industrial Court to set aside the\norder and in a proper case, direct the reinstatement of\nthe employee. In some cases, the termination of the\nemployee's services may appear to the Industrial Court\nto be capricious or so unreasonably severe that an\ninference may legitimately and reasonably be drawn that\nin terminating the services, the employer was not\nacting bona fide. The test always has to be whether the\nact of the employer is bonafide or not. If the act is\nmala fide, or appears to be a colourable exercise of\nthe powers conferred on the employer either by the\nterms of the contract or by the standing orders, then\nnotwithstanding the form of the order, industrial\nadjudication would examine the substance and would\ndirect reinstatement in a fit case..\".\n\nThe same test was laid down for determining whether an order\nof discharge could be construed as one ordering dismissal in\n\nThe Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co., Ltd., v. S. C.\nPrasad\n(1) by Shelat and Bhargava, JJ. :\n\n\"No doubt, the fact that the order was couched in\nthe language of discharge simpliciter is not\nconclusive. Where such an order gives rise to an\nindustrial dispute its form is not decisive and the\ntribunal which adjudicates that dispute can, of course,\nexamine the substance of the matter and decide whether\nthe termination is in fact discharge simpliciter or\ndismissal though the language of the order is one of\nsimple termination of service. If it is satisfied that\nthe order is punitive or mala fide or is made to\nvictimise the workmen or amounts to unfair labour\npractice, it is competent to set it aside. The test is\nwhether the act of the employer is bona fide. If it is\nnot, and is a colourable\nexercise of the power under the contract of service or\nstanding orders, the Tribunal can discard it and in a\nproper case direct reinstatement.\"\n\nThe Chartered Bank, Bombay v. The Chartered Bank\nEmployees' Union\n(supra) was followed by this Court in\n\nWorkmen of Sudder Office, Cinnamore v. Management\n(1) and\ntherein stress was laid on the employer's right to terminate\nthe services of a workman by an order of discharge\nsimpliciter under the terms of the contract where there was\nno lack of bona fides, unfair labour practice or\nvictimization.\n\nSo the real criterion which formed the touchstone of a\ntest to determine whether an order of termination of\nservices is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to\ndismissal is the real nature of the order, that is, the\nintention with which it was passed. If the intention was to\npunish, that is, to chastise, the order may be regarded as\nan order of dismissal; and for judging the intention, the\nquestion of mala fides (which is the same thing as a\ncolourable exercise of power) becomes all-important. If no\nmala fides can be attributed to the management, the order of\ndischarge must be regarded as one having been caused under\nM.S.O. 23 even though the reason for its passage is serious\nmisconduct.\n\n8. It is in light of the conclusion just above arrived\nat that the discharge of the workmen in the instant case has\nto be judged. The question of intention or mala fides is\nreally one of fact (of which the arbitrator was, in my\nopinion, the sole judge, unless his finding on the point was\nvitiated by perversity in which case alone it was liable to\nbe reviewed by the High Court). The discussion of the\nevidence by the arbitrator in his award is not only full and\nlogical but, in my opinion, also eminently just. At all\nmaterial times the Management was out to placate the Sabha\n(and therefore, the workmen) and gave to it a long rope\nthroughout. The attitude of the Sabha on the other hand was\none of intransigence and obduracy. According to the\nsettlement of the 4th of August, 1972, it was not open to\nthe workmen to resort to a strike till the expiry of a\nperiod of five years; nor could the Management declare a\nlock out till then. Any disputes arising between the\nparties, according to the terms arrived at, were to be\nsorted out through negotiations or, failing that, by\nrecourse to arbitration. A dispute was raised by the Sabha\nsoon thereafter over the implementation of the\nrecommendations of the Central Engineering Wage Board\n(hereinafter called the Board), the payment of bonus\nfor the year 1971 and wages for an earlier lock out. In\nparagraph 7.47 of its award the Board had made the following\nrecommendations :\n\n\"7.47. After considering the problem in its\nentirety, we agreed to divide the industry into five\nregions or areas as under and in doing so, we have also\nconsidered the prevailing wage levels at different\nplaces and the cost of living at important centres in\nthese places.\n\n\"1. Bombay City and Greater Bombay including Thana\nAmbarnath & Kalyan Industrial Areas.\n\n\"2. Calcutta, Greater Calcutta, Howrah Industrial\narea, Jamshedpur Industrial area, Durgapur,\nAsansol and Ranchi industrial areas.\n\n\"3. Madras industrial area, Bangalore industrial area,\nHyderabad industrial area, Poona-Chinchwad\nindustrial area, Delhi industrial area and\nAhmedabad.\n\n\"4. Coimbatore, Nagpur, Bhopal, Kanpur, Baroda and\nFaridabad industrial areas.\n\n\"5. The rest of the country.\"\n\nThis classification was made for the purpose of granting\n`area allowance' which varied with the category in which the\narea of the situation of a factory fell. No allowance was to\nbe paid to the factories falling in category 5 and on the\nbasis of the phraseology used by the Board the Management\ncontended that Ahmedabad industrial area (in which its\nfactory was situated) fell within that category. This\ninterpretation of the categorisation made by the Board was\nnot acceptable to the Sabha who claimed that the factory was\ncovered by category 3; and this was an issue on which the\nSabha was not prepared to climb down. Similarly, the Sabha\nwas adamant on the question of bonus for the year 1971 which\nit claimed at 16 per cent over and above 8.33 per cent\nallowed by statute with the plea that bonus at that rate had\nbeen paid in the earlier year. This being the position and\nnegotiations between the parties held at two meetings\nconvened on 14-12-1972 and 20-1-1973 having ended in a\nfiasco, the Management offered to have the disputes resolved\nby arbitration but that again was a course not acceptable to\nthe Sabha which, however, accused the Management of flouting\nthe settlement dated the 4th of August , 1972, by not coming\nto the negotiating table. The attitude adopted by the Sabha\nwas, to say the least, most unreason\nable. It could not have its own way in taking certain\nmatters as final and non-negotiable. Nor can it be said that\nstand taken by the management was unreasonable. Paragraph\n7.47 of the award of the Board categorized various factories\nwith reference to the areas which were either described by\nthe names of the cities in which they were situated or by\nthe names of certain industrial areas. Ahmedabad was\nmentioned as such and so was Calcutta while the other areas\nwere mentioned as such and such industrial areas. It was\nthus a very reasonable plea put forward on behalf of the\nManagement that only Ahmedabad city and not Ahmedabad\nindustrial area was included in category 3 and that that\nindustrial area fell within category 5. On the other hand,\nthe Sabha interpreted the word `Ahmedabad' occurring in\ncategory 3 to include Ahmedabad industrial area (in which\nlay the factory in question) and demanded area allowance for\nits workers on that score. The reasonableness of the plea of\nthe Management is obvious and it was the attitude of the\nSabha which lacked reason in that on the failure of the\nnegotiations they spurned the offer of the Management for\narbitration on the question of interpretation of the\ncategorisation. It can also not be said that the objection\nregarding payment of bonus raised by the Management was not\na reasonable one. The argument that the stand of the\nManagement that the negotiations between them and the Sabha\non the questions of interpretation of the Board's award and\nbonus having failed as there was no meeting ground on either\nof them, they could be referred to arbitration, lacked\nreason, is wholly unacceptable. The attitude of the Sabha in\ninsisting on negotiations being held only on the basis of\ncertain propositions formulated by it amounted really to a\nrefusal to negotiate the points in dispute and the\nManagement was therefore not left with any alternative\nexcept to suggest an arbitration as envisaged in the\nsettlement dated the 4th of August, 1972.\n\n9. Later developments reveal a similar state of affairs\nin so far as the attitude of the Sabha is concerned. Over\nand over again it was asked not to precipitate a strike and\nto act within the terms of the settlement but the advice\nfell on deaf ears. Even after the strike which, it is\nadmitted on all hands, was illegal and certainly not\nenvisaged by the settlement of the 4th of August, 1972, the\nManagement continued to make requests to the Sabha to send\nback the workers, but again no heed was paid to those\nrequests. On the other hand, the Sabha began making\nsuggestions to the Government to take over the factory.\nUltimately, when the Management was faced, to adopt means to\nrehabilitate the factory by reports to fresh\nrecruitment, they had no option except to terminate the\nservices of its workmen. Each one of the orders of\ntermination of services which were actually passed, was on\nthe face of it wholly innocuous inasmuch as it did not\nstigmatise in any manner whatsoever the concerned workman.\nThe Management had however to record reasons for the\ndischarge in pursuance of the provisions of clause (4A) of\nM.S.O. 25 and those reasons did charge each worker with\nmisconduct inasmuch as he had taken part in the illegal\nstrike and had refused to resume duty inspite of repeated\ndemands made by the Management in that behalf. All the same,\nthe Management made it clear that inspite of such misconduct\nit had no intention of punishing the workers who were given\nnot only the benefit of an order of discharge simpliciter\nbut also the option to come back to work within a specified\nperiod in which case they would be reinstated with full\nbenefits. An intention not to punish could not be expressed\nin clearer terms and is further made out from the fact that\nmore than 400 workers who resumed duty were reinstated\nwithout break in service. In passing the orders of\ndischarge, therefore, the Management did nothing more than\nact under M.S.O. 23 and its action cannot be regarded as\namounting to dismissal in the case of any of the workers.\nThey had the right to choose between a discharge simpliciter\nand a dismissal and, in the interests of the factory and the\nmembers of the Sabha and perhaps on compassionate grounds\nalso, they chose the former in unequivocal terms. The\nintention to punish being absent, the finding of the High\nCourt that the order of discharge amounted to one of\ndismissal cannot be sustained.\n\n10. I now turn to the interpretation of sub-section (2)\nof\nsection 11A\nof the 1947 Act. It is a well settled canon\nof interpretation of statutes that the language used by the\nlegislature must be regarded as the only source of its\nintention unless such language is ambiguous, in which\nsituation the preamble to the Act the Statement of Objects\nof and Reasons for bringing it on the Statute book and the\npurpose underlying the legislation may be taken into\nconsideration for ascertaining such intention. That the\npurpose of the legislation is to fulfil a socio-economic\nneed, or the express object underlying it, does not come\ninto the picture till an ambiguity is detected in the\nlanguage and the court must steer clear of the temptation to\nmould the written word according to its own concept of what\nshould have been enacted. That is how I propose to approach\nthe exercise in hand.\n\n11. For the sake of convenience of reference I may set\nout the provisions of clauses (aa) and (r) of\nsection 2\n, of\nsub-sections (1)\nand (2) and the opening clause of sub-section (3) of\nsection\n, and of the whole of\nsection 11A\nof the 1947 Act:\n\n\"2. (aa) `arbitrator' includes an umpire;\"\n\n\"2. (r) `Tribunal' means an Industrial Tribunal\nconstituted under\nsection 7A\nand\nincludes an Industrial Tribunal\nconstituted before the 10th of March,\n1957, under this Act;\"\n\n\"11. (1) Subject to any rules that may be\nmade in this behalf, an arbitrator, a Board,\nCourt, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal\nshall follow such procedure as the arbitrator or\nother authority concerned may think fit.\n\n\"(2) A conciliation officer or a member of a\nBoard, or Court or the presiding officer of a\nLabour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal may\nfor the purpose of inquiry into any existing or\napprehended industrial dispute, after giving\nreasonable notice, enter the premises occupied by\nany establishment to which the dispute relates.\n\n\"(3) Every Board, Court, Labour Court,\nTribunal and National Tribunal shall have the same\npowers as are vested in a Civil Court under\nthe\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1908. when trying a suit,\nin respect of the following matters, namely:-\n\n..........\"\n\n\"11A. Where an industrial dispute, relating\nto the discharge or dismissal of a workman has\nbeen referred to a Labour Court, Tribunal or\nNational Tribunal for adjudication and, in the\ncourse of the adjudication proceedings, the Labour\nCourt, Tribunal or National Tribunal, as the case\nmay be, is satisfied that the order of discharge\nor dismissal was not justified, it may, by its\naward, set aside the order of discharge or\ndismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman\non such terms and conditions, if any, as it thinks\nfit, or give such other relief to the workman\nincluding the award of any lesser punishment in\nlieu of discharge or dismissal as the\ncircumstances of the case may require:\n\nProvided that in any proceeding under this\nsection the Labour Court, Tribunal or National\nTribunal, as the case may be, shall rely only on\nthe materials on record and shall not take any\nfresh evidence in relation to the matter.\"\n\nSection 2\nof the Act specifically lays down that unless\nthere is anything repugnant in the subject or context, the\nexpressions defined\ntherein would have the meanings attributed to them.\nThroughout the Act therefore, while 'arbitrator' would\ninclude an umpire, a 'Tribunal' would not include an\narbitrator but would mean only an Industrial Tribunal\nconstituted under the Act, unless the context makes it\nnecessary to give the word a different connotation. In sub-\nsection (1) of\nsection 11\n, it is conceded, the word\n'Tribunal' has been used in accordance with the definition\nappearing in clause (r) of\nsection 2\nbecause an arbitrator\nis separately mentioned in that sub-section. In sub-sections\n(2) and (3) of that section a Board, a Labour Court, a\nTribunal and a National Tribunal have been invested with\ncertain powers. Would a Tribunal as contemplated by sub-\nsections (2) and (3) then include an arbitrator ? My reply\nto the question is all emphatic 'no'. It is well settled\nthat if a term or expression is used in a particular piece\nof legislation in one sense at one place, the same sense\nwill pervade the entire legislation wherever the term is\nused unless an intention to the contrary is expressed. Here\nthe word 'Tribunal' has been used in three sub-sections of\nthe same section and no reason at all is fathomable for the\nproposition that it means one thing in sub-section (1) and\nsomething different in sub-sections (2) and (3). It may also\nbe mentioned here that in all the three sub-sections the\nword 'Tribunal' has a capital 'T' which is also part of the\nexpression 'Tribunal' as occurring in clause (r) of\nsection\nand thus connotes a proper noun rather than the generic\nword 'tribunal' as embracing all institutions adjudicating\nupon rights of contending parties. A third and perhaps a\nclinching reason for this interpretation is available in the\nuse of the expression \"National Tribunal\" along with the\nword \"Tribunal\" in all the three sub-sections which\nmilitates against the argument that the word \"Tribunal\" as\nused in sub-sections (2) and (3) means an institution of\nthat type. If the word \"Tribunal\" as used in sub-sections\n(2) and (3) means such an institution, then the use of the\nexpression \"National Tribunal\" would be redundant and\nredundancy is not one of the qualities easily attributable\nto a legislative product. In that case, in fact, other words\nused in the two sub-sections last mentioned, namely, 'Court'\nand 'Labour Court' would also become redundant. In this view\nof the matter, the word \"Tribunal\" as used in all the first\nthree sub-sections of\nsection 11\nmust be held to have been\nused in the sense of the definition occurring in clause (r)\nof\nsection 2\n.\n\n12.\nSection 11A\nis just the next succeeding section and\ntherein a part of the arrangement adopted is the same as in\nsub-sections (2) and (3) of\nsection 11\nso that powers are\nconferred by it on a \"Labour 16-868SCI/79\nCourt, Tribunal or National Tribunal\" which arrangement is\nrepeated in the section thrice over. That the word\n\"Tribunal\" as used in\nsection 11A\nhas the same meaning as it\ncarries in the three sub-sections of\nsection 11\nis obvious\nand I need not repeat the reasons in that behalf; for, they\nare practically the same as have been set out by me in\nrelation to\nsection 11\n.\n\n13. In my opinion the language employed in\nsection 11A\n\nsufferers from no ambiguity whatever and is capable only of\none meaning, i.e., that the word 'Tribunal' occurring\ntherein is used in the sense of the definition given in\nclause (r) of\nsection 2\n. It is thus not permissible for this\nCourt to take the Statement of Objects and Reasons or the\npurpose underlying the enactment into consideration while\ninterpreting\nsection 11A\n.\n\nI may mention here however that a perusal of the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons forming the background to\nthe enactment of\nsection 11A\nleads me to the same\nconclusion. In that Statement a reference was specifically\nmade to tribunals as well as arbitrators in, terms of the\nrecommendations of the International Labour Organization.\nBut inspite of that the word 'arbitrator' is conspicuous by\nits absence from the section. What is the reason for the\nomission ? Was it consciously and deliberately made or was\nit due to carelessness on the part of the draftsmen and a\nconsequent failure on the part of the legislature ? In my\nopinion the Court would step beyond the field of\ninterpretation and enter upon the area of legislation if it\nresorts to guess work (however intelligently the same may be\ncarried out) and attributes the omission to the latter cause\nin a situation like this which postulates that the pointed\nattention of the legislature was drawn to the desirability\nof clothing an arbitrator with the same powers as were\nsought to be conferred on certain courts and tribunals by\n\nsection 11A\nand it did not accept the recommendation. I\nwould hold, in the circumstances, that the omission was\ndeliberately made.\n\nIt follows that the powers given to a Tribunal under\n\nsection 11A\nare not exercisable by an arbitrator who,\ntherefore, cannot interfere with the punishment (awarded by\nthe employer) in case he finds misconduct proved.\n\n14. The last point on which I differ with the finding\nof my learned brother relates to the exercise by the High\nCourt of its powers under\narticle 227\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. As pointed out by him the High Court, while\ndischarging its functions as envisaged by that article, does\nnot sit as a court of appeal over the award of the\narbitrator but exercises limited jurisdiction which extends\nonly to\nseeing that the arbitrator has functioned within the scope\nof his legal authority. This proposition finds full support\nfrom\nNagendra Nath Bora and Another v. The Commissioner of\nHills Division and Appeals\n, Assam and Others(1), P. H.\nKalyani v. M/s. Air France, Calcutta(2), state of\nAndhra\nPradesh v. S. Sree Rama Rao\n(\n3) and Navinchandra Shakerchand\nShah v. Manager, Ahmedabad Cooperative Department Stores\nLtd.\n(4), all of which have ben discussed at length by him\nand require no further consideration at my hands. In this\nview of the matter it was not open to the High Court to\nrevise the punishment (if the discharge is regarded as such)\nmeted out by the Management to the delinquent workmen and\nleft in tact by the arbitrator whose authority in doing so\nhas not been shown to have been exercised beyond the limits\nof his jurisdiction.\n\n15. I need not go into the other aspects of the case.\nIn view of my findings-\n\n(a) that the orders of discharge of the workmen\ncould not be regarded as orders of their\ndismissal and were, on the other hand, orders\nof discharge simpliciter properly passed\nunder M.S.O. 23;\n\n(b) that the arbitrator could not exercise the\npowers conferred on a Tribunal under section\n11A of the 1947 Act and could not therefore\ninterfere with the punishment awarded by the\nManagement to the workmen (even if the\ndischarge could be regarded a punishment),\nand\n\n(c) that in any case the High Court exceeded the\nlimits of its jurisdiction in interfering\nwith the said punishment purporting to act in\nthe exercise of its powers under\narticle 227\n\nof the Constitution of India,\nthe judgment of the High Court must be reversed and the\norder of the arbitrator restored. The three appeals are\ndecided accordingly, the parties being left to bear their\nown costs throughout.\n\nO R D E R\nThe appeals are dismissed substantially with such\nmodifications as are indicated in the decretal part of the\njudgment of the majority.\n\nV.D.K. Appeals dismissed.",
