The appellant Ved Prakash Lamba and the respondent Satyapal\nLamba are brothers. This, therefore, is a plain case of sibling rivalry.\n\n2. This second appeal under\nSection 100\nof the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 (\nCPC\n) emanates from Suit 146/2010 which was\ninstituted by the respondent against the appellant. The suit was\ndecreed by the learned Civil Judge by judgment dated 23 May 2015.\n\n3. The appellant appealed against the said judgment and decree to\nthe learned Additional District Judge (\"the learned ADJ\") vide RCA\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 1 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\n10/2015 (\nVed Prakash Labma v. Satyapal Lamba\n).\n\n4. The appeal has been dismissed by the impugned judgment dated\n24 September 2016. The original defendant is in second appeal before\nthis Court under\nSection 100\nof the CPC.\n\n5. A perusal of the orders passed by the learned Civil Judge and\nthe learned ADJ reveal that the disputes between the parties were\npurely disputes of fact. There is no question of law involved therein.\n\n6. It is trite law that pure findings of fact would not merit case for\ninterference in second appeal under\nSection 100\nof the CPC, as they\nwould not result in any substantial question of law, unless the findings\nare perverse.\n\n7. There is a wide swathe of authorities on the point, of which two\nof the most recent to be found in the judgments of the Supreme Court\nin\nChandrabhan v. Saraswati1\nand\nP Kishore Kumar v. Vitthal K.\nPatkar2\n.\n\n8. The relevant passages from the said decisions may be\nreproduced thus:\n\nFrom Chandrabhan:\n\n\"27. The guidelines to determine what is a substantial question\nof law within the meaning of\nSection 100\nCPC has been laid down\n\n1 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1273\n2 (2023) SCC OnLine SC 1483\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 2 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nby this Court in Sir Chunnilal V. Lal Mehta & Sons v. Century\nSpinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.3\n\n28.\nIn Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons, this Court agreed with\nand approved a Full Bench judgment of the Madras High Court\nin\nRimmalapudi Subba Rao v. Noony Veeraju4\nwhich laid down\nthe principles for deciding when a question of law becomes a\nsubstantial question of law.\n\n29.\nIn\nHero Vinoth v. Seshammal5\n, this Court followed Sir\nChunilal v. Mehta & Sons and other judgments and summarized\nthe tests to find out whether a given set of questions of law were\nmere questions of law or substantial questions of law.\n\n30. The relevant paragraphs of the judgment of this Court\nin Hero Vinoth are set out herein below:\n\n\"21. The phrase \"substantial question of law\", as\noccurring in the amended\nSection 100\nCPC is not defined\nin the Code. The word substantial, as qualifying \"question\nof law\", means of having substance, essential, real, of\nsound worth, important or considerable. It is to be\nunderstood as something in contradistinction with\ntechnical, of no substance or consequence, or academic\nmerely. However, it is clear that the legislature has chosen\nnot to qualify the scope of \"substantial question of law\" by\nsuffixing the words \"of general importance\" as has been\ndone in many other provisions such as\nSection 109\nof the\nCode or\nArticle 133(1)(a)\nof the Constitution. The\nsubstantial question of law on which a second appeal shall\nbe heard need not necessarily be a substantial question of\nlaw of general importance.\nIn\nGuran Ditta v. Ram Ditta6\n]\nthe phrase \"substantial question of law\" as it was\nemployed in the last clause of the then existing\nSection 100\n\nCPC (since omitted by the\nAmendment Act, 1973\n) came up\nfor consideration and their Lordships held that it did not\nmean a substantial question of general importance but a\nsubstantial question of law which was involved in the case.\n\nIn Sir Chunilal case the Constitution Bench expressed\nagreement with the following view taken by a Full Bench of\nthe Madras High Court in\nRimmalapudi Subba\nRao v. Noony Veeraju\n:)\n\n3 AIR 1962 SC 1314\n4 AIR 1951 Mad 969\n5 (2006) 5 SCC 545\n6 (1927-28) 55 IA 235 : AIR 1928 PC 172\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 3 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\n\"[W]hen a question of law is fairly arguable, where\nthere is room for difference of opinion on it or\nwhere the Court thought it necessary to deal with\nthat question at some length and discuss alternative\nviews, then the question would be a substantial\nquestion of law. On the other hand if the question\nwas practically covered by the decision of the\nhighest court or if the general principles to be\napplied in determining the question are well settled\nand the only question was of applying those\nprinciples to the particular fact of the case it would\nnot be a substantial question of law.\"\n\n31. The proper test for determining whether a question of law\nraised in the case is substantial would be, whether it is of general\npublic importance or whether it directly and substantially affects\nthe rights of the parties and if so, whether it is either an open\nquestion in the sense that it is not finally settled by this Court. If\nthe question is settled by the highest court or the general principles\nto be applied in determining the question are well settled and there\nis a mere question of applying those principles or the question\nraised is palpably absurd, the question would not be a substantial\nquestion of law.\n\n32. To be 'substantial', a question of law must be debatable,\nnot previously settled by law of the land or a binding precedent,\nand must have a material bearing on the decision of the case, if\nanswered either way, insofar as the rights of the parties before it\nare concerned. To be a question of law \"involving in the case\"\n\nthere must be first, a foundation for it laid in the pleadings and the\nquestion should emerge from the sustainable findings of fact\narrived at by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that\nquestion of law for a just and proper decision of the case. An\nentirely new point raised for the first time before the High Court is\nnot a question involved in the case unless it goes to the root of the\nmatter. It will, therefore, depend on the facts and circumstance of\neach case whether a question of law is a substantial one and\ninvolved in the case or not, the paramount overall consideration\nbeing the need for striking a judicious balance between the\nindispensable obligation to do justice at all stages and impelling\nnecessity of avoiding prolongation in the life of any lis.\n(See\nSantosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari7\n).\n\n33. The principles relating to\nSection 100\nof the CPC relevant\nfor this case may be summarised thus:\n\n7 (2001) 3 SCC 179\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 4 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\n(i) An inference of fact from the recitals or contents of\na document is a question of fact. But the legal effect of the\nterms of a document is a question of law. Construction of a\ndocument involving the application of any principle of law,\nis also a question of law. Therefore, when there is\nmisconstruction of a document or wrong application of a\nprinciple of law in construing a document, it gives rise to a\nquestion of law.\n\n(ii) The High Court should be satisfied that the case\ninvolves a substantial question of law, and not a mere\nquestion of law. A question of law having a material\nbearing on the decision of the case (that is, a question,\nanswer to which affects the rights of parties to the suit) will\nbe a substantial question of law, if it is not covered by any\nspecific provisions of law or settled legal principle\nemerging from binding precedents and involves a debatable\nlegal issue. A substantial question of law will also arise in a\ncontrary situation, where the legal position is clear, either\non account of express provisions of law or binding\nprecedents, but the court below has decided the matter,\neither ignoring or acting contrary to such legal principle. In\nthe second type of cases, the substantial question of law\narises not because the law is still debatable, but because the\ndecision rendered on a material question, violates the\nsettled position of law.\n\n(iii) The general rule is that the High Court will not\ninterfere with findings of facts arrived at by the courts\nbelow. But it is not an absolute rule. Some of the well-\nrecognised exceptions are where (i) the courts below have\nignored material evidence or acted on no evidence; (ii) the\ncourts have drawn wrong inferences from proved facts by\napplying the law erroneously; or (iii) the courts have\nwrongly cast the burden of proof. When we refer to\n\"decision based on no evidence\", it not only refers to cases\nwhere there is a total dearth of evidence, but also refers to\nany case, where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not\nreasonably capable of supporting the finding.\n\n34. In this case, it cannot be said that the First Appellate Court\nacted on no evidence. The Respondents in their Second Appeal\nbefore the High Court did not advert to any material evidence that\nhad been ignored by the First Appellate Court. The Respondents\nalso could not show that any wrong inference had been drawn by\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 5 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nthe First Appellate Court from proved facts by applying the law\nerroneously.\n\n35. In this case, as observed above, evidence had been adduced\non behalf of the Original Plaintiff as well as the Defendants. The\nFirst Appellate Court analysed the evidence carefully and in effect\nfound that the Trial Court had erred in its analysis of evidence and\ngiven undue importance to discrepancies and inconsistencies,\nwhich were not really material, overlooking the time gap of 34\nyears that had elapsed since the date of the adoption. There was no\nsuch infirmity in the reasoning of the First Appellate Court which\ncalled for interference.\n\n36. Right of appeal is not automatic. Right of appeal is\nconferred by statute. When statute confers a limited right of appeal\nrestricted only to cases which involve substantial questions of law,\nit is not open to this Court to sit in appeal over the factual findings\narrived at by the First Appellate Court.\"\n\nFrom P Kishore Kumar\n\n29. The first appellate court having examined the facts in extenso,\nthe High Court ought not to have interfered with the findings\nrendered therein by virtue of being, in second appeal, a court of\nlaw. As was astutely said by this Court in\nGurdev Kaur v. Kaki8\n, a\nsecond appellate court is not expected to conduct a \"third trial on\nfacts\" or be \"one more dice in the gamble.\" The decision rendered\nby the first appellate court, not being in violation of the settled\nposition of law, ought not to have been interfered with. With\nutmost respect to the High Court, we are constrained to observe\nthat the question framed by it could be regarded as one of law, if it\nall, but did not merit the label of a substantial question of law so as\nto warrant interference with the first appellate decree under\n\nsection 100\nof the CPC.\"\n\n9. The Court is required to be additionally circumspect where\nthere are concurrent findings of fact by both the courts below.\n\n10. Suit 146/2010, from which these proceedings emanate, was\ninstituted by the respondent against the appellant.\n\n8 (2007) 1 SCC 546\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 6 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\n11. The litigation pertains to a house situated at J-31, Rajouri\nGarden. There is no dispute that the appellant and the respondents are\nboth residing in the suit property.\n\n12. The plaint instituted by the respondent averred that the\nrespondent was residing on the ground floor of the suit property and\nthe appellant was residing on the first floor thereof.\n\n13. The terrace/second floor consisted only of one room, 12' X 12'\nin dimension. According to the plaint, this room was in common and\njoint use of the appellant and the respondent.\n\n14. It was further averred in the plaint that there were two staircases\nleading from the ground floor of the suit property to the first floor and\none staircase leading from first floor of the suit property to the second\nfloor. Though the appellant and the respondent, according to the\nplaint, were using their respective staircases to move from ground\nfloor to the first floor, it was alleged that the appellant had locked the\nstaircase which proceeded from the first floor to the second floor as a\nresult of which the respondent was unable to obtain access to the\nsecond floor and to the room on the terrace situated on the second\nfloor.\n\n15. In these circumstances, the respondent, in his suit, sought reliefs\nof perpetual and permanent injunction, directing the appellant to\nremove the lock by which access to the staircase to the second floor\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 7 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nhad been blocked and not to interfere with the enjoyment of the room\non the second floor which was in the joint possession of the appellant\nand the respondent.\n\n16. The learned Civil Judge framed the following issues as arising\nfor consideration in the case:\n\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree of mandatory\ninjunction, as prayed for? OPP\n\n2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree of permanent\nprohibitory injunction, as prayed for? OPP\n\n3. Relief.\"\n\n17. Apropos Issue 1, the learned Civil Judge notes that, in the\nwritten statement filed by the appellant/defendant, it was admitted that\nthe suit property was in their joint ownership. It is further observed in\nthe judgment of the learned Civil Judge that though, in the written\nstatement filed by the defendant, it was sought to be averred that there\nwas only one staircase leading from the ground floor to the second\nfloor of the suit property, the inspection report of a learned Local\nCommissioner, who was appointed to visit the property, revealed that\nthere were, in fact, two staircases leading from ground floor to the first\nfloor as had been averred by the respondent in his plaint.\n\n18. It was further observed that the articles of the appellant and the\nrespondent were both found in the room on the terrace of the suit\nproperty, thereby belying the contention of the appellant that the\nappellant was in exclusive possession of the room on the terrace.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 8 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\n19. In these circumstances, the learned Civil Judge held that the\nappellant could not be permitted to block access to the terrace by\nlocking the staircase which led from the first floor to the terrace.\nEqually, as the property was admittedly in joint possession of the\nappellant and the respondent, and the goods of both appellant and\nrespondent were found in the room on the terrace, the learned Civil\nJudge held that the respondent was entitled to a decree of permanent\ninjunction against the appellant prohibiting him from interfering with\nthe respondent's enjoyment of the room on the terrace.\n\n20. As a result, the learned Civil Judge directed the appellant to\nremove the lock on the staircase leading to the terrace and also\ninjuncted the appellant permanently from interfering with the\nenjoyment, by the respondent, of the room on the terrace.\n\n21. In first appeal, the learned ADJ has found no cause to interfere\nwith the decision of the learned Civil Judge. He has noted the\ncontention of the appellant that he was in exclusive possession of the\nroom on the terrace and that, if the respondents were to be allowed\naccess to the said room, it would hinder the safety and security of the\nappellant.\n\n22. The learned ADJ has held that, as the suit property was\nadmittedly in joint ownership and possession of the appellant and the\nrespondent, and as there had been no partition or division of the suit\nproperty, the respondent had equal rights to the room on the terrace.\nAs such, the appellant could not block access, by the respondent, to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 9 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nthe room on the terrace. Inasmuch as the appellant had not suggested\nany alternative way for the respondent to reach the terrace, the learned\nADJ found no infirmity in the decision of the learned Civil Judge\ndirecting the appellant to open access to the staircase leading from the\nfirst floor to the terrace and not to interfere with the enjoyment of the\nroom on the terrace by the respondent.\n\n23. Before me, the appellant has chosen to argue his case in person.\nHe only read ground D in the appeal which is as under:\n\n\"D. That the Ld. Lower Appellate Court has overlooked the\nobservation made by Hon'ble Mr. Justice T.V.R. Tatachari in the\ncase of Prithi Singh Versus Bachitar Singh in R.S.A. No.91 of 67\n(supra)wherein it was observed in paragraph 5of the judgment in\nthe last lines in the following terms:-\n\n\"It is now well settled that every co-owner has a right to use\nthe joint property in a husband like manner not inconsistent\nwith similar rights of other co owners. It is also well settled\nthat where a co owner is in possession of separate parcels\nunder an arrangement consented to by the other co-owners,\nit is not open to anyone to disturb the arrangement without\nthe consent of others except by filing a suit for partition.\"\n\nIn the present case also admittedly there is one stair case from first\nfloor to the terrace which is in possession of the appellant and as\nsuch, the terrace being the integral part of the first floor and is in\nactual and physical possession of the appellant which is clear even\nfrom the evidence produced by the parties and the possession of the\nsame is with the appellant and the respondent in the garb of the\npresent suit wants to disturb the peaceful possession of the\nappellant in respect of the terrace over the first floor of the said\nproperty. However it is further submitted that the respondent in his\nstatement recorded, has also stated that he could not go to the\nterrace unless and appellant open the main entry door of the first\nfloor which clearly shows that the terrace is in actual and physical\npossession of the appellant and the Ld. Trial Court as well as the\nAppellate Court has completely ignored this aspect of this case and\nas such the impugned judgment and decree of the Ld. Lower\nAppellate Court is bad in the eyes of law which has resulted into\ngrave miscarriage of justice to the appellant in view of the fact that\nin the garb of the injunction, the respondent is seeking the decree\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 10 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nfor partition and possession which is not permissible under the\nlaw.\"\n\n24. To a query from the Court as to the evidence to indicate that the\nappellant was in exclusive possession of the room on the terrace, no\nconvincing answer is forthcoming. There are concurrent findings of\nfact that the room on the terrace is in joint possession of the appellant\nand the respondent. The appellant, in his written statement, has\nadmitted the fact that the suit property was jointly owned by the\nappellant and the respondent. It is also an admitted position that there\nhas never been any partition or division of the suit property. Even on\nthis sole ground, the respondent would be entitled to enjoyment of the\nroom on the terrace as much as the appellant.\n\n25. That apart, the learned Civil Judge has also observed that the\narticles of the appellant and the respondent were both found in the\nroom on the terrace. This is a pure finding of fact, which cannot invite\ninterference in second appeal by this Court. If the articles of both\nappellant and respondent were found in the room on the terrace, it\ncannot lie in the mouth of the appellant that he was in exclusive\nphysical possession of said room. No infirmity, whatsoever, therefore\ncan be said to exist in the direction of the learned Civil Judge to the\nappellant to open access of the staircase leading to the terrace and not\nto interfere with the joint enjoyment of the room on the terrace, by the\nrespondent.\n\n26. To my mind, this is purely an ego driven dispute. It is a fight\namongst siblings. This is not a litigation which actually deserved to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 11 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nhave travelled upto this Court and occupied valuable court time.\n\n27. Ideally, this second appeal ought to have invited costs on the\nappellant.\n\n28. Nonetheless, as the appellant is advanced in years and has\nargued the matter himself, I refrain from doing so.\n\n29. After the judgment was completely dictated, the appellant\nsought to submit that the finding that the suit property was in joint\nownership was incorrect and that there was no such admission.\n\n30. I have drawn the attention of the appellant to paras (C) and (K)\nof the facts stated in the written statement which read thus:\n\n\"C. That Late Shri Inderjeet died on 21.08.1990 bequeathing\nthe property under contention to his wife Late Smt. Leelawati (i.e.\nmother of plaintiff and Defendant) vide Registered will dated\n14.7.71. That Late Smt Leela Devi also demised on 21.11.1999\nleaving behind a Registered will dated 25.07.1991 wherein she had\nbequeathed the property under contention equally to both her sons\nwho are the Plaintiff and Defendant therein.\n\nK. The plaintiff does not allow access to the Defendant in the\narea under the occupation of the Plaintiff though the property is\nstill undivided. The Defendant has asked the Plaintiff to divide the\nproperty equally between themselves but Plaintiff has deliberately\nrefrained from doing so as the Plaintiff has some nefarious design.\"\n\n31. The findings of the learned Civil Judge that, in the written\nstatement filed by the appellant, joint ownership of the suit property\nstood admitted, therefore, suffers from no infirmity.\n\n32. In order to avoid further litigation, it is clarified that the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT\n\nKUMAR RSA 9/2017 Page 12 of 13\n\nSigning Date:03.02.2024\n\n16:19:49\n\nappellant shall allow unhindered access to the terrace of the suit\nproperty via the staircase which leads from the first floor to the second\nfloor and the respondent shall be entitled to equal ownership and\nenjoyment of the room on the second floor/terrace along with the\nappellant.\n\n33. The appeal is accordingly, dismissed.\n\nC.
