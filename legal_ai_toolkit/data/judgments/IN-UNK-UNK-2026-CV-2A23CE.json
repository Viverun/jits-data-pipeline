R.J. Constructions, on such terms as this\n\nCourt may deem fit.\n\n2. At the outset, it may be necessary to note the nature and\n\nsubject matter of the instant suit and Suit No.389 of 2010, instituted\n\nby the Defendants.\n\n3. Jaysukhlal Bhuta - original Plaintiffs No.1, and Ramnikhlal,\n\nhusband of Defendant No.1 and the predecessor in title of Defendant\n\nNos.2 to 5, jointly, owned around 83 properties described in Exhibit\n\nB to the Plaint. Kamlesh Bhuta - Applicant No.1 is the son of\n\nJaysukhlal and Bhanumati Bhuta - applicant No.2, is the wife of\n\nJaysukhlal Bhuta. Defendant Nos.2 to 5 are the descendants of\n\nRamnikhlal.\n\n4. The Plaintiffs assert, the suit properties described in Exhibits\n\nB and C are the joint properties and/or joint family properties of\n\nJaysukhlal and Ramnikhlal.\n\n5. The Defendants contend, out of 83 properties described in\n\nExhibit B to the Plaint, 8 properties described in Exhibit C were\n\nexclusively owned by Ramnikhlal, and, thus, the Defendants are the\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 2/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nexclusive owners of the said properties. Conversely, Jaysukhlal and\n\nhis descendants have no right, title and interest therein.\n\n6. The Plaintiffs have instituted the instant suit for declaration\n\nthat the properties mentioned in Exhibits B are joint family\n\nproperties, and for partition and separate possession of the said\n\nproperties.\n\n7. The Defendants have instituted Suit No.389 of 2010, inter alia,\n\nfor a declaration that the properties mentioned in Exhibit C to the\n\nPlaint in the said suit exclusively belonged to Ramnikhlal, and, for\n\npartition of the remaining joint family properties. A prayer is also\n\nmade that the joint family properties which cannot be partitioned\n\nby metes and bounds ought to be sold and the sale proceeds be\n\ndistributed in accordance with the share of the parties.\n\n8. The Plaintiffs assert, area of the joint family properties\n\ndescribed in Exhibit B aggregates approximately 4,63,680 sq.\n\nmeters. The instant Interim Application is preferred in respect of\n\nthe properties bearing CTS Nos.397, 397A, 397/1 to 284, 401, 402,\n\n402/1, 404/A/1, 404/A/2, 404/1 to 39, 422, 422/1 to 15\n\nadmeasuring about 90,836.72 sq. meters situated at Village Mogra,\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 3/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nTaluka Andheri, referred to as 'the Larger Andheri Property',\n\nasserting that:\n\n(a) The Larger Andheri Property has been encroached by the slum\n\ndwellers. In or around 2010, notifications were issued under the\n\nMaharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance And\n\nRedevelopment) Act, 1971\n (the \nSlum Act, 1971\n), declaring various\n\nproperties forming part of the larger Andheri property as slum\n\nrehabilitation area. Despite the initiative by the Plaintiffs to submit\n\na joint proposal as co-owners of the said property as the portions of\n\nthe larger Andheri property are affected by the slums, the\n\nDefendants refused to co-operate with the Plaintiffs.\n\n(b) Few housing co-operative societies (proposed) have sprang up.\n\nThose housing co-operative societies have filed proceedings under\n\nthe \nSlum Act, 1971\n for acquisition of the portions of the larger\n\nAndheri property and rehabilitation of the slum dwellers residing\n\nthereat. Faced with the acquisition proceedings, the Plaintiffs were\n\nconstrained to take out Notice of Motion Nos.365 and 366 of 2014\n\nseeking permission of the Court to develop those portions of the\n\njoint family properties. The Defendants resisted. By an order dated\n\n2 February 2017, this Court permitted each of the co-owners to\n\nmake independent representations for developing the properties\n\nbefore the Competent Authority. The Defendants have not made any\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 4/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nrepresentations.\n\n(c) The endeavour of the Plaintiffs to develop portions of the\n\nlarger Andheri property was also thwarted by the Defendants by\n\nfiling objections to the effect that the proposal cannot proceed\n\nwithout the consent of the co-owners - Defendants. Eventually, by\n\nan order dated 5 October 2021, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority\n\nhas held that the proposal of the Plaintiffs for development of the\n\nplots forming part of the larger Andheri property stood 'filed' for\n\nwant of consent of the co-owners. The said decision is challenged in\n\nWP No.64 of 2022 filed by the Plaintiffs.\n\n9. The Plaintiffs seek interim orders on the premise that, out of\n\nthe larger Andheri Property, an area admeasuring 61,513.40 sq.\n\nmeters is jointly owned by the Plaintiffs and Defendants, and, they\n\nare entitled to 30,756.70 sq. meters each. What is in dispute is, the\n\nshare of the Plaintiffs in part of CTS Nos.397, 397A, 397/1 to 284\n\nadmeasuring 14,661.66 sq. meters only (disputed property).\n\n10. According to the Plaintiffs, the disputed property is owned by\n\nthe Plaintiffs and Defendants in equal shares as it was owned by\n\nfamily partnership firm M/s. R.J.Constructions, in which\n\nJaysukhlal - original Plaintiffs No.1, and Ramnikhlal, the\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 5/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\npredecessor in title of the Defendants, were partners having equal\n\nshares. There are documents which either evidence or contain an\n\nadmission on the part of the predecessor in title of the Defendants\n\nand/or Defendants, that the larger Andheri property, including the\n\ndisputed property, is co-owned by the Plaintiffs and Defendants,\n\nwhether individually or by virtue of Jaysukhlal (original Plaintiffs)\n\nand Ramnikhlal, being the partners, having equal shares in M/s.\n\nR.J. Constructions. The Plaintiffs are, thus, entitled to partition of\n\nthe larger Andheri property.\n\n11. The Applicants/Plaintiffs aver, larger Andheri Property is,\n\nhowever, not capable of being partitioned by metes and bounds on\n\naccount of the topography of the land, two big nallas, which flow\n\nacross the land; reservation of about 16,000 sq. meters as a\n\nrecreation ground under the Development Plan 2034, existence of\n\naround 11 Tabelas sprawled across portions of the larger Andheri\n\nProperty, reservation of an area admeasuring 5500 sq. meters for\n\nDP roads, set back area, etc., aviation height restrictions and more\n\nimportantly, encroachment by more than 20,000 slum dwellers,\n\nwith more than 3700 tenements across the portions of the larger\n\nAndheri property, and various acquisition proceedings in respect of\n\nsome portions of larger Andheri property.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 6/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n12. In view of the aforesaid hindrances which make the partition\n\nof the Larger Andheri Property by metes and bounds virtually\n\nimpossible, there is no alternative but to dispose of the larger\n\nAndheri Property by allotment of the properties therein to one\n\nparty, subject to payment of just compensation and/or market value\n\nto the other party.\n\n13. In the application, the Plaintiffs have ascribed reasons which,\n\naccording to the Plaintiffs, make the Plaintiffs more suitable for the\n\nsale of the larger Andheri Property to them. It is, inter alia,\n\ncontended that the Defendants do not have the financial means or\n\ninclination to purchase the property. Alternatively, if the\n\nDefendants have financial ability, they can pay the share of the\n\nPlaintiffs subject to payment of just market rate to be discovered by\n\nholding inter se auction or bidding.\n\n14. The Plaintiffs have suggested the mode, terms and procedure\n\nof inter se bidding, as set out in Exhibit TT. For the said purpose,\n\nthe Plaintiffs have estimated the base price of the larger Andheri\n\nproperty at Rs.165 Crores approximately.\n\n15. Lastly, it is averred, on account of the disinclination and\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 7/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nreluctance of the Defendants to cooperate with the Plaintiffs in the\n\ndevelopment of the larger Andheri property, there is an imminent\n\nrisk of acquisition of portions of the larger Andheri Property under\n\nthe provisions of \nSection 14\n of the Slum Act, 1971. In that event,\n\nboth the Plaintiffs and Defendants would suffer an irreparable loss\n\nas valuable property would be acquired at a throw away price in\n\naccordance with the provisions of the \nSlum Act, 1971\n. It is,\n\ntherefore, imperative in the interest of equity, justice and fairness to\n\npass interim orders as prayed for by the Plaintiffs.\n\n16. An affidavit in reply came to be filed on behalf of the\n\nDefendants resisting the prayers in the Interim Application. At the\n\nthreshold, the Defendants contend that the prayers in the instant\n\napplication cannot be granted as it would amount to granting final\n\nreliefs at an interim stage without trial, and, thereby, the rights of\n\nthe Defendants would be irretrievably prejudiced. The Defendants\n\nhave categorically asserted that the properties bearing CTS\n\nNos.397, 397A, 397/1 to 284 exclusively belong to the Defendants\n\nas Ramnikhlal had acquired the said properties under Deeds of\n\nIndenture, during the period 1939 to 1948, out of his own funds.\n\nReliance on the Deed of Partnership dated 30 March 1972 to show\n\nthat those properties (disputed property) were brought in the stock\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 8/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nof the firm M/s. R.J.Constructions, is wholly misplaced. The said\n\nPartnership Deed nowhere indicates that Ramnikhlal had brought\n\nin disputed properties as an asset of the partnership firm.\n\nTherefore, the claim of the Plaintiffs over the disputed properties is\n\ncompletely unsustainable.\n\n17. The Defendants have denied that the Defendants have not\n\ntaken measures to assert and/or protect their rights over the\n\nportions of the larger Andheri property. The Defendants filed an\n\nappeal along with M.A.No.23 of 2017 to assail the order dated 30\n\nJune 2017, declaring lands bearing CTS Nos.397 (part), 397/29 to\n\n44 and 422 (part) admeasuring 10032.434 sq. meters as slum\n\nrehabilitation area under \nSection 3(C)(1)\n of the Slum Act, 1971. The\n\nDefendants have also filed an appeal along with M.A.No.8 of 2011\n\nchallenging the Notification dated 23 December 2008 issued under\n\nSection 4(1)\n of the Slum Act, 1971 in respect of CTS Nos.397\n\n(part), 397/275 to 284 admeasuring 7,326 sq. meters.\n\n18. The Defendants categorically denied that they have adopted\n\nobstructionist approach. The Defendants are entitled to protect\n\ntheir rights in the disputed properties. The Plaintiffs have no right,\n\ntitle and interest to develop the properties which exclusively\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 9/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nbelonged to Ramnikhlal. Therefore, the instant application seeking\n\npermission to develop the larger Andheri property or sale of the\n\nlarger Andheri property, comprising properties over which the\n\nPlaintiffs can lay no proprietary title, cannot be entertained.\n\n19. The Defendants further contend that the Plaintiffs have\n\nunilaterally determined the base price of Rs.165 Crores to suit their\n\ncase. Measures to have inter se bidding is suggested with an oblique\n\nmotive to trample upon the rights of the Defendants, and, also\n\nprevent discovery of true market value of the larger Andheri\n\nproperty. Such proposal cannot be countenanced.\n\n20. In the alternative, and without prejudice to the aforesaid\n\ncontentions, in the event the Court comes to the conclusion that the\n\nlarger Andheri property is required to be sold, the Defendants\n\ncontend, bids may be invited from the public at large, so that the\n\nbest price can be fetched.\n\n21. Moreover, properties bearing CTS Nos.401, 402, 402/1,\n\n404/A/1, 404/A/2, 404/1 to 39, 422 and 422/1 to 15 were\n\npurchased in the name of Nagardas Bhuta and Kashiben N. Bhuta,\n\nand, are thus joint family properties. These properties can be\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 10/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\ndivided by metes and bounds, and, there is no need to sale those\n\nproperties.\n\n22. An additional affidavit was filed on behalf of the\n\nApplicants/Plaintiffs to substantiate their claim that the larger\n\nAndheri property cannot be partitioned by metes and bounds. A\n\nreport of Nadkarni & Co., Architects, Interior Designers and Valuers\n\ndated 1 March 2024 was sought to be pressed into service in\n\nsupport of the said claim. A reference is made to a Notification\n\ndated 29 June 2017 issued by the Government of Maharashtra\n\nunder \nSection 14(1)\n of the Slum Act, 1971 to acquire 6,962.4 sq.\n\nmeters land out of Survey Nos.397, 397/275 to 284, to bolster up a\n\ncase that there is an imminent danger of acquisition of substantial\n\nportion of the larger Andheri property by the State Government.\n\n23. In the further affidavit in reply filed on behalf of Defendant\n\nNo.3, it is reiterated that the question as to whether the properties\n\ncannot be partitioned by metes and bounds and, therefore, the\n\nportion of the said properties be sold, is contentious and complex,\n\nand cannot be decided in the Interim Application, without providing\n\nan opportunity to the Defendants to lead evidence. By this\n\napplication, the Plaintiffs desire to preempt the entire trial\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 11/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nprocedure. The Defendants contend that the claim of the Plaintiffs\n\nthat the larger Andheri property cannot be partitioned by metes\n\nand bounds, cannot be accepted as a gospel truth.\n\n24. The Defendants have, in turn, placed reliance on a report\n\nsubmitted by Shreeya Services Pvt. Ltd., Architects, to the effect\n\nthat the larger Andheri property can be partitioned equitably. With\n\nreference to the Notification issued under \nSection 4(1)\n of the Act,\n\n1971, the Defendants contend some properties were also notified\n\nunder the Notification dated 23 December 2008, which was\n\nchallenged by the Defendants by filing an appeal. Therefore, the\n\nPlaintiffs cannot take any advantage of the fact that the\n\nNotifications have been issued for acquisition of the property which\n\nare exclusively owned by the Defendants.\n\n25. In the wake of the aforesaid pleadings, I have heard Mr. Girish\n\nGodbole, learned Senior Advocate for the Applicants/Plaintiffs and\n\nMr. Shailesh Shah, learned Senior Advocate for the Defendants, at\n\nsome length. The learned Counsel took the Court through the\n\npleadings and documents in the instant suit and Suit No.389 of\n\n2010, the documents annexed with this application, reply thereto\n\nand especially the rival reports of Architects, relied upon by the\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 12/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nrespective parties.\n\n26. By this application, the Plaintiffs essentially seek permission\n\nto exclusively develop larger Andheri property or the sale of the\n\nlarger Andheri property to either of the parties in inter se bidding\n\nwith the other party being paid the value of their share as\n\ndiscovered in the inter se bidding.\n\n27. Mr. Godbole, learned Senior Advocate for the Applicants/\n\nPlaintiffs submitted that the prayers in the instant application\n\ndeserve consideration from a perspective which is, in essence,\n\nbeneficial to both the parties. Laying emphasis on the fact that the\n\nvaluable suit properties, especially the larger Andheri property,\n\nface an imminent risk of acquisition at a nominal price under the\n\nprovisions of the \nSlum Act, 1971\n, Mr. Godbole urged that continuing\n\nthe status quo would cause irretrievable prejudice to both the\n\nparties. The factors of large scale encroachments and the\n\nproceedings for acquisition of the portions of the larger Andheri\n\nproperty under the provisions of the \nSlum Act, 1971\n were pressed\n\ninto service to draw home the point that this is a fit case where the\n\nCourt would be justified in permitting the change in the nature of\n\nthe suit properties during the pendency of the suit. To this end, Mr.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 13/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nGodbole placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of Maharwal Khewaji Trust (Regd.) Faridkot V/s. Baldev Dass1.\n\n28. Mr. Godbole further submitted that a practical and pragmatic\n\nview of the matter is required to be taken. Encroachments over the\n\nlarger Andheri property is indisputable. In addition, on account of\n\nthe topography of the suit properties, reservations in the\n\nDevelopment Plan, existence of a number of large cattle sheds\n\n(tabelas), reservation for DP roads and the aviation height\n\nrestrictions, partition of the larger Andheri property by metes and\n\nbounds is impracticable.\n\n29. Baking upon the report of M/s. Nadkarni and Company,\n\nArchitects, especially the conclusion (pages 734-735), Mr. Godbole\n\nurged that the reasons ascribed by the Architects for arriving at the\n\nconclusion that the equitable division of the Larager Andheri\n\nProperty is not practicable, cannot be brushed aside lightly. Each of\n\nthe circumstances noted by the Architect bear upon the partibility\n\nof the subject suit lands from the point of view of economic viability\n\nand development potential.\n\n30. Mr. Godbole submitted that to address such a situation, the\n1 (2004) 8 SCC 488\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 14/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nlegislature has enacted the \nPartition Act, 1894\n. Laying special\n\nemphasis on the statement of objects and reasons of the \nPartition\n\nAct, 1894\n, Mr. Godbole strenuously submitted that a preliminary\n\ndecree for partition is not a pre-condition for the exercise of the\n\npower to direct the sale of the joint family properties. Nor is it\n\nnecessary that the Court must record a positive finding that the\n\npartition by metes and bounds is not reasonable or convenient. It\n\nshould only appear to the Court that the suit property is not capable\n\nof division by metes and bounds. To buttress this submission, Mr.\n\nGodbole placed strong reliance on the decisions of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the cases of R.Ramamurthi Iyer V/s. Raja V. Rajeswara\n\nRao2 and Rani Aloka Dhdhoria and Ors. V/s. Goutam Dudhoria and\n\nOrs.3\n\n31. As a second limb of the submission, Mr. Godbole would urge\n\nthat, given the peculiar facts of the case, this Court is not denuded of\n\nthe power to order the sale at an interim stage, if the Court finds it\n\nexpedient in the interest of justice. The Court can always resort to\n\ninherent powers under \nSection 151\n of the Code of Civil Procedure,\n\n1908, as such a course is not expressly prohibited. Reliance was\n\nplaced on a decision of the Gujarat High Court in the case of\n\n2 (1972) 2 SCC 721\n3 (2009) 13 SCC 569\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 15/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nHirachand Kikabhai V/s. Chandrasen Motichand4 and a judgment of\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of Rajendra Prasad Gupta V/s.\n\nPrakash Chandra Mishra and Ors.5.\n\n32. Mr. Godbole further submitted that the resistance to the sale\n\nof the disputed properties on the premise that those properties are\n\nsolely owned by the Defendants does not merit countenance, as\n\nthere are four documents which clearly demonstrate that the\n\ndisputed property was brought by the predecessor in title of the\n\nDefendants as a capital in M/s. R.J.Constructions. Attention of the\n\nCourt was invited to the Development Agreement dated 2 July 2004\n\nexecuted by and between Ramnikhlal and Jaysukhlal in the\n\ncapacity of partners of M/s. R.J.Constructions and M/s. Aditi\n\nDevelopers, wherein the disputed property was shown to have been\n\nbrought in as the capital of Ramnikhlal, and, consequently, the\n\nproperty of the firm. Secondly, in Suit No.3179 of 2004 instituted\n\nby Ramnikhlal, Jaysukhlal and R.J.Constructions, it was again\n\ncategorically asserted that Ramnikhlal had brought the said\n\nproperty in the firm M/s. R.J.Constructions, and, thereby, the\n\nPlaintiffs therein were the owners of the disputed property.\n\n4 1966 ILR Guj 143\n5 (2011) 2 SCC 705\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 16/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n33. In the face of these documents which, in a sense, constitute\n\nadmission in pleadings, the claim of the Defendants that they are\n\nthe exclusive owners of the disputed property, is clearly\n\nunsustainable. In any event, Mr. Godbole urged, the applicants have\n\nsuggested a mechanism to protect the interest of the Defendants\n\nqua the disputed property in the event the court orders the sale.\n\nEven otherwise, the Court may put appropriate conditions to\n\nprotect the interest of the Defendants qua the claim with regard to\n\nthe disputed property.\n\n34. In opposition to this, Mr. Shah, learned Senior Advocate for\n\nthe Defendants, at the outset, submitted that this application is\n\nactuated by a design to preempt the trial of all the disputed\n\nquestions of facts and law by seeking the sale of the larger Andheri\n\nproperty and present a fait accompli to the Defendants. Taking the\n\nCourt through the prayers in the plaint, especially the relief of\n\ndeclaration in prayer clause (a) and partition by metes and bounds\n\nin prayer clause (b), Mr. Shah urged with tenacity that those\n\nprincipal prayers in the plaint would stand granted without proof\n\nand trial if the Court grants the alternate prayer contained in\n\nprayer clause (b)(i) of sale of the suit properties, at an interim\n\nstage. Such a course is legally impermissible, urged Mr. Shah.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 17/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n35. An earnest endeavour was made by Mr. Shah to draw home\n\nthe point that whether the partition of the suit properties by metes\n\nand bounds is not reasonable and practicable, is a matter rooted in\n\nfacts, and that question warrants determination at the trial. A\n\nsummary inquiry, like the present one, which the applicants desire\n\nthe Court to embark upon to determine whether the partition is\n\npossible, is not permissible.\n\n36. At any rate, the matter is also within the province of the\n\nexperts, urged Mr. Shah. In the case at hand, there are conflicting\n\nreports of the experts. The report of Shreeya Services Pvt. Ltd.,\n\nArchitects, solicited by the Defendants, in terms, records that the\n\nequitable division of the larger Andheri property is practicable. At\n\nthis stage, according to Mr. Shah, the Court is not equipped to give\n\nprimacy to one of the two conflicting reports sans evidence.\n\nTherefore, according to Mr. Shah, the proper course would be to\n\nconclude the trial expeditiously as the pleadings are complete. The\n\nproposed course of action has the propensity to by-pass all the\n\nprovisions of the Code, including Order XX Rule 18.\n\n37. Refuting the submissions on behalf of the applicants premised\n\non the provisions of the \nPartition Act, 1894\n, Mr. Shah asserted that\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 18/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nthe recourse to the provisions of the \nPartition Act\n, can be made at\n\nthe time of passing of the decree. None of the judgments, on which\n\nreliance was placed on behalf of the applicants, were rendered in a\n\ncase where the Court resorted to the provisions of the \nPartition Act\n,\n\nat an interim stage. Therefore, at this juncture, recourse to the\n\nprovisions of the \nPartition Act, 1894\n is extremely tenuous.\n\n38. Mr. Shah further urged that, in the facts of the case, in view fo\n\nthe two conflicting reports, even it cannot be said that it appears to\n\nthe Court that the partition of the larger Andheri property is not\n\nreasonable or practicable. The Defendants have fairly pleaded the\n\ntrue state of affairs as regards the ownership of the suit lands. The\n\nfact that the Defendants have admitted that there are joint family\n\nproperties does not necessarily imply that the Defendants have\n\nadmitted that those properties cannot be divided by metes and\n\nbounds. Thus, the recourse to the provisions of Order XII Rule 6 of\n\nthe Code, is not at all warranted.\n\n39. Mr. Shah urged with a degree of vehemence that the question\n\nas to whether the disputed property was brought in the partnership\n\nfirm by deceased Ramnikhlal, cannot be decided at this stage. The\n\naspect as to whether the recitals in the Development Agreement, or\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 19/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nfor that matter, pleadings in the previous proceedings constitute an\n\nadmission that the disputed properties formed part of the\n\npartnership asset, is a matter which must await adjudication at the\n\ntrial post evidence. Taking the Court through the Partnership Deed,\n\nespecially clause (4) thereof, Mr. Shah submitted that the question\n\nas to whether there was compliance with the reciprocal promise\n\ncontained therein, has to be decided at the trial.\n\n40. Mr. Godbole joined the issue by canvassing a submission that\n\nthe disputed properties, which were incontrovertibly shown as the\n\nproperty of R.J.Constructions, vested in late Ramnikhlal and\n\nJaysukhlal, as the partners of the said firm. \nThe Partnership Act\n\ncontemplates liquidation of the assets of the partnership as the\n\nprimary step to the settlement of accounts between the partners\n\nupon the dissolution of a firm. Both Plaintiffs and Defendants, in\n\ntheir respective suits, are, inter alia, seeking the dissolution of the\n\npartnership M/s.R.J.Constructions. Therefore, there is no\n\nimpediment in ordering the sale of the disputed property as well, for\n\nthe parties are not at issue on the point that the firm M/s. R.J.\n\nConstructions stood dissolved. To bolster up this submission, Mr.\n\nGodbole placed reliance on the judgment of Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of \nS.V.Chandra Pandian & Ors. vs. S.V.Sivalinga Nadar & Ors.6\n.\n6 (1993) 1 SCC 589\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 20/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n Consideration :-\n\n41. Before appreciating the aforesaid submissions canvassed\n\nacross the bar, it may be apposite to precisely ascertain the area\n\nover which the parties are at issue, with regard to the proprietary\n\nrights. In the further affidavit in reply, the Defendants have\n\nclassified the suit properties which are joint family properties,\n\nproperties over which the Defendants claim exclusive ownership\n\nand the properties which exclusively belonged to the Plaintiffs. The\n\nproperties bearing CTS Nos. 401, 404, 404/A/1, 404/A/2, 404/1 to\n\n39, 422, and 422/1 to 15, having been purchased by Nagardas\n\nBhuta and Kashiben Bhuta, are stated to be the undisputed joint\n\nfamily properties. Properties bearing CTS No.402 and 402/1 are\n\nstated to be the properties belonging to the Plaintiffs and, thus,\n\nsolely owned by the Plaintiffs. The properties bearing CTS Nos.397,\n\n397A, 397/1 to 284 are the properties solely owned by the\n\nDefendants (disputed properties).\n\n42. The controversy between the parties, thus, revolves around\n\nthe questions as to whether the disputed properties form part of\n\njoint family properties and whether the larger Andheri property\n\ncannot be partitioned by metes and bounds and whether the\n\ncircumstances of the case are such that the Court, at an interim\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 21/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nstage, ought to direct the sale of the Larger Andheri Property\n\nwithout going for the trial, and, if the circumstances so warrant,\n\nwhat ought to be the modalities of the sale ?\n\n43. Evidently, the distinct considerations would come into play as\n\nregards the three sets of suit properties, as classified by the\n\ndefendants. In respect of the undisputed joint family properties, the\n\nquestion as to whether the said properties are not conveniently and\n\nreasonably partible would be at the hub of the matter, since these\n\ndoes not seem much controversy over the entitlement of Jaysukhlal\n\nBhuta, the predecessor in title of the Plaintiffs, and Ramnikhlal\n\nBhuta, the predecessor in title of the defendants. With regard to the\n\ndisputed properties, over which the defendant claim right, title and\n\ninterest, to the exclusion of the Plaintiffs, the question of title would\n\nbe required to be determined in addition to the necessity of sale on\n\naccount of impracticability of partition by metes and bounds. The\n\nthird set comprising the properties bearing CTS No. 402 and 402/1,\n\nwhich the defendants concede, exclusively belong to the Plaintiffs, a\n\ndeclaration to that effect would suffice.\n\n44. Taking the third set first, it is necessary to note, in the\n\naffidavit in reply dated 7th February, 2024, in paragraph 18, it was,\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 22/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\ninter alia, contended that the properties including the properties\n\nbearing CTS Nos. 402 and 402/1 were purchased in the names of\n\nNagardas Bhuta and Kashiben N. Bhuta and therefore those were\n\njoint family properties. However, in the further affidavit in reply by\n\ndefendant No. 3, it has been categorically asserted that the\n\nproperties bearing CTS Nos. 402 and 402/1 are the properties of the\n\nPlaintiffs solely. In paragraph No. 9 of the said affidavit, it has been\n\nfurther asserted that the defendants have no claim over the said\n\nproperties of the Plaintiffs. It would be contextually relevant to note\n\nthat in the report of Shreeya Services Pvt. Ltd., Architects\n\nappointed by the Defendants also, it is recorded that the Architects\n\nwere instructed to exclude CTS Nos. 402 and 402/1 as those\n\nproperties were in the exclusive ownership of the Plaintiffs. It would\n\nbe also necessary to note that Mr. Shah, learned Senior Advocate for\n\nthe Defendants, also canvassed submissions on the premise that the\n\nproperties bearing CTS Nos. 402 and 402/1 exclusively belong to\n\nthe Plaintiffs.\n\n45. In view of the aforesaid stand of the defendants, on an\n\naffidavit, I am inclined to hold that there is no impediment, even at\n\nthis stage, in making a declaration that the properties bearing CTS\n\nNos. 402 and 402/1, are exclusively owned by the Plaintiffs, and\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 23/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nthus, exclude those properties from further consideration.\n\n46. This leads me to the consideration of the prayers in the\n\ninstant application qua the first set of the suit properties, namely,\n\nthe undisputed joint family properties. At the outset, it is necessary\n\nto note the nature of a suit for partition. A judicial determination in\n\na suit for partition involves broadly two parts. First, whether a\n\nparty claiming partition has a share in the suit property and, if yes,\n\nwhether such a party is entitled to a division and separation of his\n\nshare. Second, once the aforesaid question is answered in the\n\naffirmative, the actual division of the properties, which is primarily\n\nin the nature of a ministerial act.\n\n47. A useful reference in this context can be made to a decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of \nShub Karan Bubna @ Shub Karan\n\nPrasad Bubna vs. Sita Saran Bubna and Others7\n wherein the nature\n\nof a suit for partition was expounded, as under:-\n\n 7] In a suit for partition or separation of a share, the prayer is not\n only for declaration of Plaintiffs's share in the suit properties, but\n also division of his share by metes and bounds. This involves three\n issues:\n\n (i) whether the person seeking division has a share or interest in\n the suit property/properties;\n\n (ii) whether he is entitled to the relief of division and separate\n possession; and\n\n (iii) how and in what manner, the property/properties should be\n\n7 (2009) 9 Supreme Court Cases 689.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 24/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n divided by metes and bounds ?\n\n In a suit is for partition or separation of a share, the court at\n the first stage decides whether the Plaintiffs has a share in the suit\n property and whether he is entitled to division and separate\n possession. The decision on these two issues is exercise of a\n judicial function and results in first stage decision termed as\n `decree' under Order 20 Rule 18(1) and termed as `preliminary\n decree' under Order 20 Rule 18(2) of the Code. The\n consequential division by metes and bounds, considered to be a\n ministerial or administrative act requiring the physical inspection,\n measurements, calculations and considering various permutations\n / combinations /alternatives of division is referred to the\n Collector under Rule 18(1) and is the subject matter of the final\n decree under Rule 18(2).\n\n48. The thrust of the submission of Mr. Shah was that the instant\n\napplication obviates the judicial determination as to the entitlement\n\nand partiability of the suit properties and, instead, directly calls\n\nupon the Court to venture into the division of the properties in a\n\nparticular fashion i.e. by the sale of the suit properties. An earnest\n\nendeavour was made by Mr. Shah to draw home the point that the\n\nsaid exercise can only be at the stage of passing of the final decree. A\n\ntwo-pronged challenge was mounted by Mr. Shah. One, the case that\n\nthe suit properties cannot be reasonably and conveniently\n\npartitioned has not been pleaded adequately. Two, there is no\n\nwarrant for invoking the provisions contained in \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of\n\nthe Partition Act, 1893, at this stage.\n\n49. The statement of objects and reasons for the enactment of\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 25/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nPartition Act, 1893\n indicates the circumstances which necessitated\n\nthe enactment and the mischief the legislation proposed to address.\n\nIt explicitly records that, under the law, as it then stood, the Court\n\nwas enjoined to give the share to each of the parties and could not\n\ndirect a sale and division of the proceeds in any case whatever.\n\nThere were insuperable practical difficulties in the way of making\n\nan equal division, and it was realized that the Court was either\n\npowerless to give effect to its decree or was driven to all kinds of\n\nshifts and expedients in order to do so. It was, therefore, proposed\n\nto supply the said defect in the law, by giving the Court, under\n\nproper safeguard, a discretionary authority to direct a sale where a\n\npartition cannot reasonably be made and the sale would, in the\n\nopinion of the Court, be more beneficial for the parties. At the same\n\ntime, having regard to the strong attachment of the people in this\n\ncountry to their landed possession, it was proposed to make the\n\nconsent of parties interested at least to the extent of a moiety a\n\ncondition precedent to the exercise by the Court of the said power.\n\nThus, in order to prevent any oppressive exercise of the said\n\nprivilege, it was proposed to give such of the shareholders as do not\n\ndesire a sell, the right to buy the others out at a valuation to be\n\ndetermined by the Court.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 26/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n50. Keeping in view, the aforesaid object of the \nPartition Act,\n\n1893\n, the provisions contained in \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of the Act, 1893,\n\ndeserve to be extracted. They read as under:-\n\n 2] Power to Court to order sale instead of division in partition\n suits - Whenever in any suit for partition in which, if instituted prior\n to the commencement of this Act, a decree for partition might have\n been made, it appears to the Court that, by reason of the nature of the\n property to which the suit relates, or of the number of the\n shareholders therein, or of any other special circumstance, a division\n of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made, and that a\n sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds would be more\n beneficial for all the shareholders, the Court may, if it thinks fit, on the\n request of any of such shareholders interested individually or\n collectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards, direct a sale of the\n property and a distribution of the proceeds.\n\n 3] Procedure when sharer undertakes to buy -\n\n (1) If, in any case in which the Court is requested under the last\n foregoing section to direct a sale, any other shareholder applies for\n leave to buy at a valuation the share or shares of the party or parties\n asking for a sale, the Court shall order a valuation of the share or\n shares in such manner as it may think fit and offer to sale the same to\n such shareholder at the price so ascertained, and may give all\n necessary and proper directions in that behalf.\n (2) If two or more shareholders severally apply for leave to buy as\n provided in sub-section (1), the Court shall order a sale of the share or\n shares to the shareholder who offers to pay the highest price above the\n valuation made by the Court.\n\n (3) If no such shareholder is willing to buy such share or shares at the\n price so ascertained, the applicant or applicants shall be liable to pay\n all costs of or incident to the application or applications.\n\n51. From a conjoint reading of \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of the Act, 1893, it\n\nbecomes discernible that the Court invoking the power to direct the\n\nsale of the property in a suit for partition, must first record a finding\n\nthat the case is such that a decree for partition might have been\n\npassed. Secondly, on account of the nature of the property which is\n\nthe subject matter of the suit, the number of shareholders, who are\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 27/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nentitled to be allotted the shares in the suit property or any other\n\nspecial circumstances, it appears to the Court that a division of the\n\nproperty, cannot reasonably or conveniently be made and\n\nconsequently a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds\n\nwould be more beneficial for all the shareholders. It must be\n\nremembered that \nsection 2\n confers a discretion on the Court and as\n\nis the case with the exercise of discretion in other jurisdictions,\n\nsuch discretion must be exercised judiciously and after being\n\ninformed of all the relevant considerations.\n\n52. A profitable reference in this context can be made to the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of R.Ramamurthi Iyer\n\n(supra) wherein, the import of the provisions contained in \nsections\n\n2\n and \n3\n of the Act, 1893 was expounded in the following terms :\n\n 8] ..........The scheme of \nSections 2\n and \n3\n apparently is that if the\n nature of the property is such or the number of shareholders is so\n many or if there is any other special circumstance and a division of the\n property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made, the court can in\n its discretion, on the request of any of the shareholders interested\n individually or collectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards,\n direct a sale of the property and distribute the proceeds among the\n shareholders. Now where a court has been requested under \nSection 2\n\n to direct a sale any other shareholder can apply for leave to buy at a\n valuation the share or shares of the party or parties asking for sale. In\n such a situation it has been made obligatory that the court shall order a\n valuation of the share or shares and offer to sale the same to the\n shareholder who has applied for leave to buy the share at a price\n ascertained by the court. other words if a-Plaintiffs in a suit for\n partition has invoked the power of the court to order sale instead of\n division in a partition suit under \nsection 2\n and the other shareholder\n undertakes to buy at a valuation the share of the party asking for sale\n the court has no option or choice or discretion left to it any it is bound\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 28/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n to order a valuation of the shares in question and offer to sale the same\n to the shareholder undertaking or applying to buy it at a valuation. The\n purpose underlying the section undoubtedly appears to be to prevent\n the property falling into the hands of third parties if that can be done in\n a reasonable manner. It would appear from the Objects and Reasons\n for the enactment of the \nPartition Act\n that as the law stood the court\n was bound to give a share to each of the parties and could not direct a\n sale or division of the proceeds. There could be, instances where\n \"there were insuperable practical difficulties in the way of making an\n equal division and the court was either powerless to give effect to. its\n decree or was- driven to all kinds of shifts and expedient in order to do\n so. The court was, therefore, given a discretionary authority to direct a\n salt where. a partition could not reasonably be made and the sale\n would, in the opinion of the court, be more beneficial to the parties.\n But having regard to the strong attachment of the people in this\n country to their landed possessions the consent of the parties\n interested at least to the extent of a moiety in the property was made a\n condition precedent to the exercise by the court of the new power. At\n the same time in order to prevent any oppressive exercise of this\n privilege those shareholders who did not desire a sale were given a\n right to buy the others out at a valuation to be determined by the court.\n\n53. In the aforesaid case, it is of critical salience to note, in the\n\ncontext of the controversy at hand, that the Supreme Court\n\nenunciated in clear and explicit terms that the language of \nsection 2\n\nof the Partition Act, 1893 does not appear to make the Court to give\n\na finding that the property is incapable of division by metes and\n\nbounds.\n\n54.

(Ref : Shub Karan Bubna, para\n 18.2).\n\n ........ .......\n\n (ix) In a partition suit, under \nSection 2\n of the Partition Act, having\n regard to the nature of the property or large number of shareholders or\n in other special circumstance, if it appears to the court that the\n division of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made\n and that a sale of the property would be more beneficial, it can direct\n sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds as per shares\n declared. In addition, the court may be requested to direct sale by\n shareholders, interested individually or collectively to the extent of one\n moeity or upwards. (Ref : Shub Karan Bubna, para 18.2 and R.\n Rmamurthi Iyer, para 8).\n\n (x) It is not obligatory on the court to give a positive finding that the\n property is incapable of division by metes and bounds. It should only,\n \"appear\" that it is not so capable of division. Parties may jointly agree\n to such dispossession of the property. (Ref : R. Ramamurthi Iyer, para\n\n 13).\n\n (xi) The request from the shareholder (s) for sale of the property does\n not have to be in the nature of a formal prayer. (Ref : Rani Aloka\n Dudhoria, para 48; R. Rmamurthi Iyer, para 13) If a party or co-sharer\n asks for sale of a property under \nSection 2\n of the Partition Act, it is the\n duty of the court to order the valuation of the shares (Ref.: Malati\n Ramachandra Raut).\n\n (xii) The words employed in \nSection 3(1)\n only require the shareholder\n has to merely inform the court or to notify to it that he is prepared to\n buy at a valuation the share of the party asking for sale. No formal\n application for the purpose is necessary (R. Ramamurthi Iyer). It is\n obligatory upon the court to offer to sale the same to the shareholder(s)\n who seek to buy the shares of the other party in terms of \nSection 3\n at\n the price determined upon such valuation. The court has no discretion\n or option or choice in this matter. (Ref : Malati Ramchandra Raut, para\n 9; R. Ramamurthi Iyer, paras 8 and 11).\n\n (xiii) The right of a co-sharer to purchase a property directed to be sold\n under \nSection 3\n of the Partition Act accrues on the date the co-sharer\n request the court to sale the property to him. The valuation of the\n shares has to be made on the date of accrual of this right.

After\n a shareholder has applied for leave to buy at a valuation under \nSection\n 3\n of the Partition Act, the Plaintiffs who requested the court to exercise\n the power under \nSection 2\n of ordering the sale, cannot withdraw the\n suit under \nOrder 23 Rule 1 of the CPC\n. (Ref :R. Rmamurthi Iyer, paras\n 9 and 10).\n\n55. Mr. Shah submitted that the decision in the case of R.\n\nRamamurthi Iyer (supra) was at the stage of passing of the decree\n\nand not at an interim stage, as is the case at hand. It was urged that\n\nthe nature and character of the suit property cannot be changed\n\nduring the pendency of the suit and till rights of the parties are\n\nadjudicated. Reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of Maharwal Khewaji Trust (supra) on behalf of the Plaintiffs,\n\ndoes not advance the cause of the submission on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiffs as the Supreme Court has emphasized the principle of\n\nmaintaining the status-quo during the pendency of the proceeding,\n\nurged Mr. Shah.\n\n56. In the case of Maharwal Khewaji Trust (supra), the Supreme\n\nCourt has observed that unless and until a case of irreparable loss\n\nor damage is made out by a party to the suit, the Court should not\n\npermit the nature of the property being changed which also includes\n\nalienation or transfer of the property which may lead to loss or\n\ndamage being caused to the party who may ultimately succeed and\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 31/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nmay further lead to multiplicity proceedings.\n\n57. Ordinarily, the recourse to the provisions contained in\n\nsections 2\n and \n3\n of the Partition Act, 1893 can be at the stage of a\n\ndecree for partition. However, from the text of \nsection 2\n of the\n\nPartition Act, 1893 an inexorable and immutable rule that recourse\n\nto \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of the Act is not permissible at an interim stage,\n\ncannot be deduced.\n\n58. If upon consideration of all the circumstances, the Court is\n\nsatisfied that, in a given case, a decree for partition might have been\n\nmade, the Court can proceed to determine whether a case for\n\nexercise of discretion to order the sale of the suit property is made\n\nout. Therefore, the resistance on behalf of the defendants that the\n\nstage is not ripe for considering the recourse to \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of\n\nthe Partition Act, 1893 does not merit acceptance, unreservedly.\n\nUndoubtedly, the change in the status-quo, the maintenance of\n\nwhich is the norm, until the adjudication of the rights of the parties,\n\ncan be permitted only where a justifiable case of irreparable loss or\n\nirretrievable damage is made out.

An answer to the aforesaid question will hinge upon the\n\nconsiderations which inform the exercise of discretion under\n\nsection 2\n of the Partition Act, 1893, noted above. First and foremost,\n\nthe nature of the suit properties. By and large, two factors appear to\n\nbe rather incontestable. One, a substantial portion of the suit\n\nproperties has been encroached upon. In the application, the\n\nPlaintiffs assert that there is encroachment by more than 20000\n\nslum dwellers, with over 3700 tenements across the portions of\n\nLarger Andheri Property. Second, proceedings have been initiated\n\nfor declaration of portions of Larger Andheri Property for\n\nrehabilitation of the slum dwellers under the \nSlum Act, 1971\n.\n\n60. It is imperative to note that in an attempt to refute that the\n\ncase of the Plaintiff's that the defendants did not take steps to\n\nchallenge the acquisition proceeding or assert their right to\n\nredevelop the properties encroached upon by the slum dwellers, the\n\ndefendants have placed on record the copies of appeals preferred\n\nbefore the Slum Tribunal assailing the acquisition (Exhibit A and\n\nto the affidavit in reply). It appears that in those appeals, the\n\nPlaintiffs and their predecessor in title also joined. (Implication of\n\nthis wold be considered while determining the controversy as\n\nregards the disputed properties). To add to this, to the additional\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 33/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\naffidavit, the Plaintiffs have annexed a copy of the notification dated\n\n29th June, 2024 wherein in exercise of the powers conferred by sub\n\nsection (1) of \nSection 14\n of the Act and clause (i) of \nSection 3D\n of\n\nthe Slum Act, 1971, the Government made a declaration to acquire\n\nthe properties including the disputed properties and Survey Nos.\n\n401 and 401 (P).\n\n61. The situation which thus obtains is that a large tract of the\n\nLarger Andheri Property has been encroached upon. The\n\nProceedings have been initiated under the \nSlum Act, 1971\n to acquire\n\nportions of Larger Andheri Property. Indeed the Plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendants have assailed the acquisitions by resorting to the\n\nproceedings which they considered appropriate. It is common\n\nknowledge that where the property is encroached upon by slum\n\ndwellers, in a metropolis like Mumbai, where land commands a\n\npremium and there is also a legislative policy to protect the interest\n\nof the persons who happen to be slum dwellers and displaced, the\n\nfactum of such large scale encroachment is a relevant\n\nconsideration. It must weigh in, in determining whether the\n\nproperty can be reasonably and conveniently partitioned by metes\n\nand bounds.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 34/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n62. The topography of the Larger Andheri Property also deserves\n\nconsideration. It is asserted that two big nallas flow across the land.\n\nThose nallas divide Larger Andheri Property into such sub plots as\n\nto render equitable division impracticable. The regulatory\n\ndesignations in the development plan and provisions for DP Road\n\nreservation for recreation ground etc. put further hindrances in the\n\nequitable division of Larger Andheri Property.\n\n63. Mr. Shah the learned counsel for the defendants would urge\n\nthat all the aforesaid difficulties are rooted in facts. At this stage,\n\nthe claim of the Plaintiffs cannot be taken at its face value. It was\n\nurged that the report of Nadkarni & Co., Architects, will have to be\n\ntested at the trial. Mr. Shah further urged that the report of M/s.\n\nShreeya Services Private Limited, Architects, appointed by the\n\ndefendants, on the other hand, indicates that equitable partition of\n\nthe Larger Andheri Property is possible. Therefore, at this stage, it\n\ncannot be said with certainty that it appears that partition of the\n\nLarger Andheri Property is not reasonably possible.\n\n64. I have perused the reports of Nadkarni & Co., Architects and\n\nM/s. Shreeya Services Private Limited, Architects. It is true, at this\n\nstage, the Court may not be equipped to give precedence to one\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 35/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nreport over another. However, the factors which are taken into\n\naccount by respective Architects, can be examined. In the report\n\ndated 1st March, 2024, Nadkarni & Co., has culled out the factors\n\nwhich, in their opinion, render an equitable sub division of the\n\nLarger Andheri Property or the disputed property, not possible.\n\nThe conclusions read as under:\n\n 44) As described above, the proposed development plan roads\n divide the Larger Property as well s the Truncated Property into\n five sub-plots of varying sizes. The existing nallas further sub-\n\n divide two of the sub-plots in the Larger Property and one of the\n sub-plots in the Truncated Property into two parts of varying sizes.\n Thus the Larger Property is divided into seven parts of varying\n sizes by the proposed development plan roads and the existing\n nallas, while the Truncated Property is divided into six parts of\n varying sizes by the proposed development plan roads and the\n existing nallas.\n\n 45) As also described above, the sub-plots created out of the Larger\n Property and the Truncated Property are affected by a number of\n factors viz. Development plan reservation for Garden/ Park (ROS\n 1.5), co-operative housing societies formed by the slum-dwellers,\n existing tabelas (cattle sheds) and highway buffer zones. The areas\n affected by these factors vary significantly from sub-plot to sub-plot,\n and also overlap each other in varying proportions, resulting in\n significant difference in the FSI permissible and consumable on\n each of the sub-plots.\n\n 46) Moreover, the height restrictions that would be imposed by the\n Civil Aviation Authority combined with the sloping nature of the\n Larger Property and the Truncated Property would result in further\n difficulty in consumption of FSI thereon.\n\n 47) Due to the above reasons, an equitable sub-division of the\n Larger Property or the Trucated Property into two parts would not\n be possible. Any sub-division of the Larger Property or the\n Truncated Property will divide such property in an inequitable\n manner and one of the parties would have to accept the less than\n equitable portion out of the Larger Property or the Truncated\n Property.\n\n65. In contrast, in its report, M/s. Shreeya Services Private\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 36/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nLimited, Architects, professed to propose an equitable distribution\n\nof the Larger Andheri Property. The special circumstances\n\nassociated with the property on account of large scale\n\nencroachment by the slum dwellers, existence of large cattle sheds\n\n(tabelas), the effect brought about by the passing of nallas, the\n\ndivision of the Larger Andheri Property as well as disputed\n\nproperty into plots on account of passing of nallas, reservation of\n\nlands for DP roads and other designations and overall situation of\n\nthe lands so as to afford equitable partition of the property from the\n\nperspective of economic viability and development potential, does\n\nnot seem to have been adequately weighed in by M/s. Shreeya\n\nServices Private Limited, Architects.\n\n66. At this juncture, the fact that there is no dispute about the\n\ncharacter of the undisputed joint family properties (as claimed by\n\nthe defendants) assumes decisive significance. With the\n\nencroachment of the properties and the resultant litigation as well\n\nas the vicissitudes of fortunes of litigation, having regard to the\n\nnumerous stake holders involved therein, the possibility of the\n\nparties succeeding in obtaining actual physical possession of a\n\nsubstantial part of Larger Andheri Property appears remote.\n\nConversely, if the properties are not redeveloped by the owners by\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 37/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nresorting to the provisions contained in the \nSlum Act, 1971\n, there is\n\nan imminent possibility of those properties being acquired by the\n\nState Government under the provisions of \nSlum Act, 1971\n. It need\n\nnot be emphasized that compensation to be awarded under the \nSlum\n\nAct, 1971\n to the owner of the property can never be commensurate\n\nwith the development potential of the lands, in a city like Mumbai.\n\n67. In this view of the matter, the submission on behalf of the\n\nPlaintiffs that allowing the status-quo to continue may cause\n\nirreparable loss to both the Plaintiffs and the defendants, can not be\n\nbrushed aside lightly. If the other factors which impede the\n\nequitable distribution of the properly, adverted to above, are\n\nconsidered in juxtaposition with the large scale encroachment of the\n\nsubject property, in my considered view, a justifiable case for\n\nexercise of the discretion under \nsections 2\n and \n3\n of the Partition\n\nAct, 1893 so far as the undisputed joint family properties (out of\n\nLarger Andheri Property) can be said to have been made out.\n\n68. As regards the disputed properties i.e. properties bearing CTS\n\nNos.397, 397/A and CTS No.397/1 to 284, the Plaintiffs seek to\n\ndraw support to their claim that the disputed properties form part\n\nof the property of M/s. RJ Constructions (of which deceased\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 38/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nJaysukhlal Bhuta and Ramnikhlal Bhuta were the partners) from\n\nthe purported admission on the part of defendants and the\n\npredecessor in title of the defendants. It was submitted that there\n\nare documents of unimpeachable character which record such clear\n\nand explicit admissions. Since these are the admissions in\n\npleadings, the Plaintiffs assert, they stand on a higher pedestal and\n\ncan thus form the basis of an adjudication.\n\n69. Reliance was placed on the copies of the judgments in Appeal\n\nNo. 31 of 1981 (Exhibit 3) and Appeal No. 13 of 1986 (Exhibit 4)\n\ndelivered by the Maharashtra Slum Tribunal under \nsection 4(3)\n of\n\nthe Slum Act, 1971, jointly preferred by Jaysukhlal and Ramnikhlal\n\nBhuta and their successors in interest in respect of the properties\n\nbearing CTS Nos.397, 397/A and CTS No.397/1 to 284, respectively.\n\nThe Plaintiffs were shown as the owners of the said property along\n\nwith the predecessor in title of the defendants. Secondly, the Deed of\n\nPartnership dated 30th March, 1972 between Jaysukhlal and\n\nRamnikhlal clearly records that Ramnikhlal Bhuta had agreed to\n\nbring in the property situated at Andheri which was then valued at\n\nRs. 5 lakh in the partnership as his capital.\n\n70. To bolster up the submission that the disputed property was\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 39/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nthe property of the firm, reliance was placed on the Development\n\nAgreement dated 2nd July, 2004 wherein it was, inter alia, recorded\n\nthat, Ramnikhlal had acquired the subject properties bearing CTS\n\nNos. 397, 397/A and CTS No.397/1 to 284 and under the\n\npartnership dated 30th March, 1972 brought the said property as\n\nhis capital in the partnership firm and thereupon both Ramnikhlal\n\nand Jaysukhlal acquired the ownership over the said property.\n\nAttention of the Court was also invited to the copy of the plaint in\n\nSuit No. 3179 of 2024 wherein it was asserted that Ramnikhlal and\n\nJaysukhlal Bhuta were the partners of M/s. RJ Constructions, a\n\npartnership firm, and they owned the property bearing Survey Nos.\n\n397. Ramnikhlal Bhuta had brought the said property into the\n\npartnership firm and thus the Plaintiffs became the owners of the\n\nsaid property.\n\n71. Mr. Godbole, the learned Senior Advocate for the Plaintiffs,\n\nstrenuously submitted that in the face of the aforesaid documents, it\n\ncan hardly be contested that the disputed properties form part of\n\nthe property of the partnership firm, M/s. RJ Constructions. Once\n\nthere is material to show that the properties were brought in the\n\nstock of the firm, the manner in which the properties become the\n\nfirm's property looses significance. Since both the partners have\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 40/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\npassed away and the parties are ad idem that M/s. RJ Constructions\n\nthe firm, is required to be dissolved, the first step towards\n\nsettlement of accounts would be disposal of the property of the firm.\n\nTo this end, Mr. Godbole, placed a heavy reliance on the decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of \nS.V.Chandra Pandian\n (supra).\n\n72. In the said case, Supreme Court after tracing the legal\n\nposition, enunciated that, \"regardless of its character the property\n\nbrought into the stock of a firm or acquired by a firm during its\n\nsubsistence for the purposes and in the course of its business\n\nshall constitute the property of the firm unless the contract\n\nbetween the partners provides otherwise. On the dissolution of the\n\nfirm each partner becomes entitled to his share in the profits, if\n\nany, after the accounts are settled in accordance with \nsection 48\n\nof the Partnership Act. The mode of settlement of accounts set out\n\nin section 48 clearly indicates that the partnership asset in its\n\nentirety must be converted into money and from the pool the\n\ndisbursement has to be made as set out in clause (a) and sub-\n\nclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (b) and thereafter if there is any\n\nresidue that has to be divided among the partners in the\n\nproportions in which they were entitled to a share in the profits of\n\nthe firm.\"\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 41/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n73. Mr. Shah, the learned Senior Advocate, joined the issue by\n\ncanvassing a submission that the question as to whether the\n\ndisputed properties belong to M/s. RJ Constructions, the\n\npartnership firm or the defendants exclusively, can only be decided\n\nat the trial based on evidence. The institution of the suit to remove\n\nthe encroachment over the property or appeal under \nsection 4(3)\n of\n\nthe Slum Act, 1971 claiming that either M/s. RJ Constructions or\n\nboth the Plaintiffs and Defendants were the owners of the disputed\n\nproperties cannot have determinative significance. As there is a\n\ndispute inter se Plaintiffs and Defendants over the ownership of the\n\nproperty and the Defendants have instituted independent suit\n\nclaiming exclusive ownership over the disputed properties, the\n\nissue can not be decided sans evidence. Mr. Shah submitted that\n\nwhether the reciprocal premises under the Partnership Deed were\n\nfully performed so as to divest the exclusive ownership of\n\nRamnikhlal in the disputed properties, is also a matter which\n\nwarrants consideration.\n\n74. Admissions, if true and clear, are considered to be the best\n\nproof of the facts admitted. It is also well recognized that the\n\nadmissions in pleadings or judicial admissions made by the parties\n\nstand on a higher footing than evidentiary admissions. Such judicial\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 42/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nadmissions can be made the foundation of the rights of the parties.\n\nIn contrast, evidentiary admissions which are receivable at the trial\n\nas evidence are, by themselves, not conclusive. They can be shown\n\nto be wrong. (\nNagindas Ramdas vs. Dalpatram Ichharam @ Brijram\n\nAnd Ors.10\n).\n\n75. In the case at hand, prima facie, it appears that the fact that\n\nthe disputed properties were originally acquired by Ramnikhlal\n\nBhuta appears incontestable. The claim of joint ownership over the\n\ndisputed properties rests on the premise that Ramnikhlal had\n\nbrought the disputed properties in the partnership as a partnership\n\nstock. The Deed of Partnership (Exhibit 99) inter alia records that\n\nthe parties had agreed that Ramnikhlal who owned the Property at\n\nAndheri, then valued at Rs. 5 lakh, shall bring the same in the\n\npartnership firm as his capital and thereupon the value thereof\n\nshall be credited in the capital account of Ramnikhlal, the first\n\npartner in the books of partnership as the capital brought by him.\n\n76. The Plaintiffs want the Court to believe that the subsequent\n\nDeed and pleadings \nreferred to above\n indicate that the said exercise\n\nwas done and the disputed properties bearing CTS Nos.397, 397A,\n\n397/1 to 284 assumed the character of the property of the firm.\n10 1974(1) SCC 242.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 43/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nWhether the disputed properties were impressed with the character\n\nof the properties of the partnership firm, would turn on the\n\ncompliance of the reciprocal promises as indicated above and the\n\nadjustment of the accounts of the partners. There is, in my\n\nconsidered view, an element of controversy as to whether\n\nRamnikhlal Bhuta was divested of the exclusive ownership in\n\nconsideration of the other partner contributing capital to the\n\npartnership firm, as agreed. In the peculiar facts of the case, in my\n\nview, the said question cannot be determined on the basis of the\n\npleadings in the proceedings instituted by M/s. RJ Constructions or\n\nthe Plaintiffs and the Defendants jointly for recovering the\n\npossession of the encroached properties. It would be in the fitness of\n\nthings to leave the said question for decision upon appreciation of\n\nevidence.\n\n77. The upshot of aforesaid consideration is that so far as the\n\nundisputed joint family properties, the Court does not find any\n\nimpediment in ordering the sale of those properties even at this\n\nstage as such sale appears to be for the benefit of both the parties.\n\nHowever, as regards the disputed properties, the Court considers it\n\nappropriate to defer the decision to the final disposal of the suit.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 44/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n78. This propels me to the appropriateness of the modalities of sell\n\nsuggested on behalf of the Plaintiffs. In a sense, the Plaintiffs have\n\nreckoned base price of the Larger Andheri Property at Rs. 165\n\nCrores, and proposed inter se bidding by the Plaintiff and\n\nDefendants so as to bye out the other party. Mr. Godbole submitted\n\nthat the Court may devise any other method which protects the\n\ninterest of both the parties.\n\n79. Mr. Shah, learned counsel for the Defendants, would, however,\n\nurge that the modality of the sale suggested by the Plaintiffs is\n\nneither just nor equitable. On the one hand, the valuation is too low.\n\nOn the other hand, the entire exercise is actuated by a desire to\n\nusurp the property by taking undue advantage of the situation.\n\n80. Prima facie, the mode of sale suggested by the Plaintiffs\n\nespecially determination of the sale price by inter se bidding does\n\nnot merit countenance. It is imperative to note that under sub\n\nsection (1) of \nsection 3\n, whenever a shareholder applies for leave to\n\nbuy at a valuation the share or shares of the party or parties asking\n\nfor a sale, the Court is enjoined to order a valuation of shares, in\n\nsuch a manner as it may think fit and offer to sell the same to such\n\nshareholder at the price so ascertained. If two or more shareholders\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 45/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\nseverally apply for leave to buy as provided in sub-section (1), the\n\nCourt shall order a sale of the share or shares to the shareholder\n\nwho offers to pay the highest price above the valuation made by the\n\nCourt. Under \nsection 6\n of the Partition Act, 1893, every sale under\n\nsection 2\n shall be subject to a reserved bidding, and the amount of\n\nsuch bidding shall be fixed by the Court in such manner as it may\n\nthink fit and may be varied from time to time. Sub section (2) of\n\nSection 6\n gives liberty to the shareholders to bid at the sale on such\n\nterms as to non-payment of deposit or as to setting off or accounting\n\nfor the purchase-money or any part thereof instead of paying the\n\nsame as to the Court may seem reasonable. \nSection 8\n of the\n\nPartition Act provides that any order for sale made by the Court\n\nunder \nsection 2\n, \n3\n or 4 shall be deemed to be a decree within the\n\nmeaning of \nsection 2\n of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\n\n81. If the discretionary power vested in the Court under the\n\nPartition Act, 1893\n, is construed in the light of the object of the Act,\n\n1893, adverted to above, it becomes abundantly clear that that the\n\nprivilege to buy the share of the co-owner (of the property), can not\n\nbe exercised in an oppressive manner. The determination of\n\nreserved price by the Court is a measure to ensure that the\n\nproperty is sold at an optimum price.\n\nVishal Parekar, PS 46/49\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 02/01/2025 ::: Downloaded on - 03/01/2025 00:32:22 :::\n\n ia-2685-2023.doc\n\n82. In a situation like the present one, where the property is huge,\n\nencumbered with encroachments and associated disadvantages, the\n\nproper course would be to have the sale by a public auction, where\n\nthe true market price of the property is discovered, albeit, by giving\n\nthe parties an option to bid in the said public auction without\n\ndeposit of earnest money.\n\n83. The ad-hoc base price, as suggested by the Plaintiffs, cannot be\n\nthe basis of sale nor can the bidding be restricted to the parties.\n\nUndoubtedly, the parties will have the right to match the offer made\n\nby a stranger purchaser in the auction sale and, thereafter the\n\nparties may bid inter se if they wish to, over and above the said\n\nprice discovered in the public auction.\n\n84.
