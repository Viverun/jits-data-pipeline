The matter concerns a dispute relating to\nof reserved candidates and general candidates.\n\n At the outset we make it clear that in this\njudgment we are not concerned with the reservation policy of\nthe State or with the validity of any procedure fixing\nroster points for purpose of promotion of reserved\ncandidates. We are here dealing only with a limited\nquestion relating mainly to seniority of the reserved\ncandidates promoted at roster points.\n\n \nWe also make it clear that what we are deciding\ntoday is based on principles already \nlaid down by\n this Court\nsince 1950 and in particular since 1963.\n \nBasing on those\nprinciples, we are concerned with the limited question as to\nwhether Union of India vs. Virpal Singh [1993 (\n6) SCC 685]\nand Ajit Singh Januja vs. State of Punjab\n [1996 (2) SCC\n215], which were earlier decided in favour of the general\ncandidates are to be affirmed or whether the latter\ndeviation made in \nJagdish Lal vs. State of Haryana\n [1997\n(6) SCC 538] against the general candidates, is to be\naccepted. How these IAs 1-3 came to be filed for\nclarification:?\n \nThe circumstances under which the State of\nPunjab has filed these IAs for clarification are as\nfollows:- Initially, in a case relating to the Indian\nRailways, a two Judge Bench of this Court in \nUnion of India\nvs. Virpal Singh\n [1995 (6) SCC 685] (hereinafter referred\nto as Virpal) held that it was \"permissible\" for the\nRailways to say that reserved candidates who get promotion\nat the roster points would not be entitled to claim\nseniority at the promotional level as against senior general\ncandidates who got promoted at a later point of time to the\nsame level. It was further held that \"it would be open\" to\nthe State to provide that as and when the senior general\ncandidate got promoted under the rules, - whether by way of\na seniority rule or a selection rule - to the level to which\nthe reserved candidate was promoted earlier, the general\ncandidate would have to be treated as senior to the reserved\ncandidate (the roster point promotee) at the promotional\nlevel as well, unless, of course, the reserved candidate got\na further promotion by that time to a higher post. (This is\ndescribed for convenience, as the 'catch up' rule) Close on\nthe heels of Virpal, came Ajit Singh from Punjab, before a\nthree Judge Bench and the Bench held that the question of\nseniority at the promotional level had to be decided by\napplying the provisions of \nArticle 14\n and \n16 (1)\n and if any\norder, circular or rule provided that such reserved\ncandidates who got promotions at roster points were to be\ntreated as senior to the senior general candidates who were\npromoted later, then such an order, circular or rule would\nbe violative of \nArticle 14\n and \n16(1).\n It was, however, held\nthat the position would be different if by the time the\nsenior general candidate got his promotion under the normal\nrules of seniority or selection, the reserved candidate who\nwas promoted earlier at the roster point, had got a further\npromotion. In other words, the `catch up' principle as \nlaid\ndown in\n Virpal was accepted.\n \nIn coming to the above\nconclusions, the three Judge Bench relied upon the\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n the nine Judge Bench in \nIndira\nSawhney vs. Union of India\n [1992 Suppl.\n \n(3) SCC 251] and\nby the Constitution Bench in \nR.K.Sabharwal vs. State of\nPunjab\n [1995 (2) SCC 745]. These two cases had laid down\nearlier the manner in which the rights of the general\ncandidates and the reserved candidates ought to be balanced.\n\nIn Ajit Singh the Court said the balance must be maintained\nin such a manner that there was no reverse discrimination\nagainst the general candidates and that any rule, circular\nor order which gave seniority to the reserved candidates\npromoted at roster point, would be violative of \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16(1)\n of the Constitution of India. The Indian Railways\nfollowing the law \nlaid down in\n Virpal issued a circular on\n28.2.97 to the effect that the reserved candidates promoted\nat roster points could not claim seniority over the senior\ngeneral candidates promoted later. The State of Punjab\nafter following Ajit Singh was proceeding to revise\nseniority lists and make further promotions of the senior\ngeneral candidates who had reached the level to which the\nreserved candidates had reached earlier.\n \nAt that point of\ntime, another three Judge Bench came to decide a case from\nthe State of Haryana in \nJagdish Lal vs. State of Haryana\n\n[1997 (6) SCC 538] and took a view contrary to Virpal and\nAjit Singh. It held that the general rule in the Service\nRules relating to seniority from the date of continuous\nofficiation which was applicable to candidates promoted\nunder the normal seniority/selection procedure would be\nattracted even to the roster point promotees as otherwise\nthere would be discrimination against the reserved\ncandidates.\n \nThe Bench also observed that the right to\npromotion was a statutory right while the rights of the\nreserved candidates under \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n\nwere fundamental rights and in that behalf, it followed\n\nAshok Kumar Gupta vs. State of U.P.\n [1997 (5) SCC 201]\nwhere a similar principle had been laid down. The\nContentions in brief: Sri Hardev Singh, learned senior\ncounsel for the State of Punjab submitted that since Jagdish\nLal decided something contrary to Virpal and Ajit Singh the\nState was in a `quandary what to do. In these IAs and the\nconnected batch of cases which have been listed together and\nheard, contentions have been raised by Sri Rajeev Dhawan for\nthe State of Haryana and Sri Altaf Ahmad, Additional\nSolicitor General of India for the State of Rajasthan and\nthe Union of India. According to the learned counsel the\n'roster point promotees', ( i.e. a reserved candidate at\nLevel 1 who is promoted to Level 2 at the roster point meant\nfor such promotion) namely, the reserved candidates cannot\nclaim seniority on the basis of continuous officiation.\nHowever, learned Additional Solicitor General, Sri C.S.\nVaidyanathan for the Indian Railways has taken a contrary\nstand-, in spite of the fact that Railways has already\naccepted Virpal and issued a circular on 28.2.1997 -that\nroster point promotions in the Railways did not confer\nseniority. Senior counsel Sri Harish Salve and others for\nthe general candidates contended that Virpal and Ajit Singh\nwere correctly decided and Jagdish Lal was wrongly decided.\nSenior counsel Sri K. Parasaran, Sri D.D. Thakur, Sri M.N.\nRao, and others including Sri Jose P. Verghese for the\nreserved candidates relied upon Jagdish Lal and they\ncontended that Virpal and Ajit Singh were wrongly decided.\nThe validity of the 'catch-up' rule accepted in Virpal and\nAjit Singh in favour of general candidates was also put in\nissue. One additional point was also argued. This related\nto the \"prospectivity\" of R.K.Sabharwal and Ajit Singh. In\nR.K.Sabharwal this Court has held that once the roster point\npromotions were all made in respect of the reserved\ncandidates, the roster ceased to operate. Unless any of the\nreserved candidates already promoted had retired or been\nfurther promoted etc. and unless there was a vacancy\ngenerated at the points already filled, fresh candidates\nfrom the reserved candidates could not be promoted by\nfurther operation of the roster. Having so held, the Court\nsaid that the judgment would be \"prospective\". The reserved\ncandidates now contend that the above direction means that\nnot only the reserved candidates so promoted in excess of\nthe roster points could not be reverted but that their\nseniority against such excess promotions was also protected\nvide Sabharwal.\n\n Likewise, in regard to Ajit Singh, the contention\nwas as follows: Assume there are rosters at Level 1 and\nagain at Level 2. Assume that a reserved candidate has been\npromoted from Level 1 to Level 2 on the basis of the roster\npoint and again from Level 2 to Level 3 on roster point. A\nsenior general candidate at Level 1 has later reached Level\n3 and by that date the reserved candidate is still at Level\n\n3. Assume that the plea of the general candidates that the\ngeneral candidate became senior at Level 3 to the earlier\npromoted reserved candidate, is correct. Ignoring the\nsenior general candidate at Level 3, the reserved candidate\nhas been further promoted to Level 4 before 1.3.96 when Ajit\nSingh was decided. In that event, the prospective operation\nof Ajit Singh means, according to the reserved candidates,\nthat such a reserved candidate is not only not to be\nreverted but his seniority at Level 4 is also to be\nprotected. The general candidates say that after Ajit Singh\nwas decided on 1.3.96 the said promotion made to Level 4,\nignoring the case of the senior general candidate at Level\n3, is to be reviewed and seniority at Level 3 is to be\nrefixed. At Level 4, - when the general candidate is also\npromoted to Level 4, the seniority of the reserved candidate\nhas also to be fixed on the basis as to when he would have\notherwise been promoted to Level 4, after considering the\ncase of his senior general candidate at Level 3. We shall\nbe dealing with these main contentions in this judgment. So\nfar as the individual points raised in the Civil Appeals,\nContempt Cases and other IAs are concerned, we shall deal\nwith them by separate judgments for convenience.\n\n On the above contentions, the following four main\npoints arise for consideration: Points:\n\n..........L.....T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J\n (1) Can the roster point promotees ( reserved\n category) count their seniority in the promoted\n category from the date of their continuous\n officiation vis-a-vis general candidates who were\n senior to them in the lower category and who were\n later promoted to the same level? (2) Have\n Virpal, Ajit Singh been correctly decided and has\n Jagdish Lal been correctly decided? (3) Whether\n the 'catch-up' principles contended for by the\n general candidates are tenable? (4) What is the\n meaning of the 'prospective' operation of\n Sabbarwal and to what extent can Ajit Singh be\n prospective? .lm10 Points (1) and (2): A word\n with regard to \nArticle 16(4)\n & \nArticle 16 (4A):\n\n Learned senior counsel for the general candidates\n submitted at the outset that while Indira Sawhney\n permitted reservations for a period of five years,\n the Constitution was amended within the said\n period and \nArticle 16(4A)\n was incorporated\n permitting reservation in promotions but\n restricting the same to Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes. Learned counsel submitted that\n it was their contention that this amendment was\n not constitutionally permissible but this question\n need not be decided in this batch as separate writ\n petitions challenging the validity of \nArticle\n 16(4A)\n are pending in this Court. In view of the\n above stand, we shall proceed in these cases on\n the assumption that \nArticle 16(4A)\n is valid and is\n not unconstitutional. At the same time, we also\n note the contention of the reserved candidates\n that \nArticle 16(4A)\n must be deemed to be\n constitutional unless otherwise declared. .pa\n \nArticle 16(1)\n, 16(4)\n and \n16(4A):\n In the context\n of the first and second questions, it is necessary\n to refer to the relevant parts of \nArticle 16\n of\n the Constitution of India. Sub-clauses (1), (4)\n and (4A) of \nArticle 16\n which have relevance in\n this case read as follows: \"\nArticle 16(1)-\n\n Equality of appointment in matters of public\n employment:- There shall be equality of\n opportunity for all citizens in matters relating\n to employment or appointment to any office under\n the State.\n\n (2)......................................\n\n (3)......................................\n\n (4) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the\n State from making any provision for the\n reservation of appointment or posts in favour of\n any backward class of citizens which, in the\n opinion of the State, is not adequately\n represented in the services under the State.\n\n (4A) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the\n State from making any provision for reservation in\n matters of promotion of any class or classes of\n posts in the services under the State in favour of\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which,\n in the opinion of the State are not adequately\n represented in the services under the State.\"\n\n I.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J\n Constitution is not static: We shall at the\n outset deal with the contention raised by Sri\n D.D.Thakur, learned senior counsel appearing for\n the reserved candidates that \nArticle 16(4)\n must be\n interpreted keeping in mind the conditions\n prevailing fifty years ago when the Constitution\n was drafted and when \nArticle 16(4)\n was\n incorporated in the Constitution. Learned counsel\n submitted that the founding fathers were conscious\n that a special provision for reservation was\n necessary to see that the backward classes of\n citizens were adequately represented in the\n services. Hence an interpretation which would\n advance the said objective must be applied.\n Reliance was also placed on the Statement of\n Objects and Reasons in connection with the\n incorporation of \nArticle 16(4A).\n In fact, all the\n learned counsel appearing for the reserved\n candidates contended that the said officers could\n not be treated as equals to the general candidates\n and that their backwardness and past social\n oppression must be borne in mind. Nobody can deny\n that the above approach is the proper one while\n dealing with the reserved classes. The primary\n purpose of \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n is due\n representation of certain classes in certain\n posts. However, we must bear in mind and not\n ignore that there are other provisions, namely,\n \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution which are also very important. The\n Constitution has \nlaid down in\n \nArticles 14\n and\n \n16(1)\n the permissible limits of affirmative action\n by way of reservation under \nArticles 16(4)\n and\n \n16(4A).\n While permitting reservations at the same\n time, it has also placed certain limitations by\n way of \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n so that there is no\n reverse discrimination. It has also incorporated\n \nArticle 335\n so that the efficiency of\n administration is not jeopardized. While\n interpreting provisions of the Constitution and in\n particular fundamental rights of citizens, it is\n well to bear in mind certain fundamental concepts.\n In McCulloch Vs. Maryland ( 1819) 4 Wheel (17\n U.S.316), Chief Justice Marshall cautioned that we\n must keep in mind that it is the Constitution that\n we are expounding. He said that the Constitution\n was intended to endure for ages to come and had\n consequently to be adapted to the various crises\n of human affairs from time to time. Brandeis J\n wrote : \"Our Constitution is not a straight\n jacket. It is a living organism. As such it is\n capable of growth, of expansion and of adaptation\n to new conditions. Growth implies changes,\n political, economic and social. Growth which is\n significant manifests itself rather in\n intellectual and moral conceptions of material\n things\" (Brandeis Papers, Harvard Law School).\n Similarly, in a beautiful metaphor Mr. J.M. Beck\n said as follows:\n\n \"The Constitution is neither, on the one hand, a\n Gibraltor Rock, which wholly resists the ceaseless\n washing of time and circumstances, nor is it, on\n the other hand, a sandy beach, which is slowly\n destroyed by erosion of the waves. It is rather\n to be likened to a floating dock which, while\n firmly attached to its moorings, and not therefore\n at the caprice of the waves, yet rises and falls\n with the tide of time and circumstances\"\n\n (Constitution of the United States, Yesterday,\n Today and Tomorrow' ( 1924) (Oxford University\n Press).\"\n\nL.........I.....T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T..J\n Such should be and would be our approach in\nresolving the important constitutional issues arising in\nthese IAs and in this batch of cases.\n\n We shall first deal with the fundamental rights\nunder \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n and then with the nature of the\nrights of the reserved candidates under \nArticles 16(4)\n and\n\n16(4A).\n\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1):\n Is right to be considered\nfor promotion a fundamental right?\n\n \nArticle 14\n and \nArticle 16(1)\n are closely\nconnected. They deal with individual rights of the person.\n\nArticle 14\n demands that the \"State shall not deny to any\nperson equality before the law or the equal protection of\nthe laws\". \nArticle 16(1)\n issues a positive command that\n\"there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in\nthe matters relating to employment or appointment to any\noffice under the State\". It has been held repeatedly by\nthis Court that sub-clause (1) of \nArticle 16\n is a facet of\n\nArticle 14\n and that it takes its roots from \nArticle 14.\n The\nsaid sub- clause particularizes the generality in \nArticle 14\n\nand identifies, in a constitutional sense \"equality\nopportunity\" in matters of employment and appointment to any\noffice under the State. The word 'employment' being wider,\nthere is no dispute that it takes within its fold, the\naspect of promotions to posts above the stage of initial\nlevel of recruitment. \nArticle 16(1)\n provides to every\nemployee otherwise eligible for promotion or who comes\nwithin the zone of consideration, a fundamental right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion. Equal opportunity here means\nthe right to be \"considered\" for promotion. If a person\nsatisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not\nconsidered for promotion, then there will be a clear\ninfraction of his fundamental right to be \"considered\" for\npromotion, which is his personal right. \"Promotion\" based\non equal opportunity and 'seniority' attached to such\npromotion are facets of fundamental right under \nArticle\n16(1):\n Where promotional avenues are available, seniority\nbecomes closely interlinked with promotion provided such a\npromotion is made after complying with the principle of\nequal opportunity stated in \nArticle 16(1).\n For example, if\nthe promotion is by rule of `seniority-cum- suitability',\nthe eligible seniors at the basic level as per seniority\nfixed at that level and who are within the zone of\nconsideration must be first considered for promotion and be\npromoted if found suitable. In the promoted category they\nwould have to count their seniority from the date of such\npromotion because they get promotion through a process of\nequal opportunity. Similarly, if the promotion from the\nbasic level is by selection or merit or any rule involving\nconsideration of merit, the senior who is eligible at the\nbasic level has to be considered and if found meritorious in\ncomparison with others, he will have to be promoted first.\nIf he is not found so meritorious, the next in order of\nseniority is to be considered and if found eligible and more\nmeritorious than the first person in the seniority list, he\nshould be promoted. In either case, the person who is first\npromoted will normally count his seniority from the date of\nsuch promotion. \n(There are minor modifications in various\nservices in the matter of counting of seniority of such\npromotees but in all cases the senior most person at the\nbasic level is to be considered first and then the others in\nthe line of seniority). That is how right to be considered\nfor promotion and the `seniority' attached to such promotion\nbecome important facets of the fundamental right guaranteed\nin \nArticle 16(1).\n Right to be considered for promotion is\nnot a mere statutory right: The question is as to whether\nthe right to be considered for promotion is a mere statutory\nright or a fundamental right. Learned senior counsel for\nthe general candidates submitted that in \nAshok Kumar Gupta\nVs. State of U.P.\n (1997 (5) SCC 201), it has been laid\ndown that the right to promotion is only a \"statutory right\"\n\nwhile the rights covered by \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n are\n\"fundamental rights\". Such a view has also been expressed\nin Jagdish Lal and some other latter cases where these cases\nhave been followed. Counsel submitted that this was not the\ncorrect constitutional position. In this connection our\nattention has been invited to para 43 of Ashok Kumar Gupta.\nIt reads as follows:-\n\n \"It would thus be clear that right to promotion is\na statutory right. It is not a fundamental right. The\nright to promotion to a post or class of posts depends upon\nthe operation of the conditions of service. \nArticle 16(4)\n\nread with \nArticles 16(1)\n and \n14\n guarantees a right to\npromotion to Dalits and Tribes as a fundamental right where\nthey do not have adequate representation consistently with\nthe efficiency of administration... before expiry thereof\n(i.e. 5 years rule), \nArticle 16(4)\n has come into force from\n17.6.1995. Therefore, the right to promotion continues as a\nconstitutionally guaranteed fundamental right.\" A similar\nview was expressed in Jagdishlal and followed in some latter\ncases. In the above passage, it was laid down that\npromotion was a statutory right and that \nArticles 16(4)\n and\n\n16(4A)\n conferred fundamental rights. In our opinion, the\nabove view expressed in Ashok Kumar Gupta, and followed in\nJagdish Lal and other cases, if it is intended to lay down\nthat the right guaranteed to employees for being\n\"considered\" for promotion according to relevant rules of\nrecruitment by promotion(i.e. whether on basis of seniority\nor merit) is only a statutory right and not a fundamental\nright, we cannot accept the proposition. We have already\nstated earlier that the right to equal opportunity in the\nmatter of promotion in the sense of a right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion is indeed a fundamental right\nguaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n and this has never been\ndoubted in any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta, right\nfrom 1950. \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n do not confer any\nfundamental right to reservation: We next come to the\nquestion whether \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n guaranteed\nany fundamental right to reservation. It should be noted\nthat both these Articles open with a non-obstante clause -\n\"Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making\nany provision for reservation.....\". \nThere is a marked\ndifference in the language employed in \nArticle 16(1)\n on the\none hand and \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A).\n There is no\ndirective or command in \nArticle 16(4)\n or \nArticle 16(4A)\n as\nin \nArticle 16(1).\n On the face of it, the above language in\neach of \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4A)\n, is in the nature of an\nenabling provision and it has been so held in judgments\nrendered by Constitution Benches and in other cases right\nfrom 1963. We may in this connection point out that the\nattention of the learned Judges who decided Ashok Kumar\nGupta and Jagdish Lal was not obviously drawn to a direct\ncase decided by a Constitution Bench in \nC.A.Rajendran vs.\nUnion of India\n 1968 (1) SCC 721 which arose under \nArticle\n16(4).\n It was clearly \nlaid down by\n the five Judge Bench\nthat \nArticle 16(4)\n was only an enabling provision, that\n\nArticle 16(4)\n was not a fundamental right and that it did\nnot impose any constitutional duty. It only conferred a\ndiscretion on the State. The passage \nin \nthe above case\n\nreads as follows:\n\n \"Our conclusion therefore is that \nArticle 16(4)\n\ndoes not confer any right on the petitioner and there is no\nconstitutional duty imposed on the government to make\nreservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,\neither at the initial stage or at the stage of promotion.\nIn other words, \nArticle 16(4)\n is an enabling provision and\nconfers discretionary power on the State to make a\nreservation of appointment in favour of backward class of\ncitizens which, in its opinion, is not adequately\nrepresented in the services of the State.\"\n\n \nThe above principle was reiterated in two three\nJudge Bench judgments in \nP&T SC/ST Employees' Welfare\nAssociation vs. Union of India\n 1988 (4) SCC 147; and in\nSBI SC/ST Employees Welfare Association vs. State Bank of\nIndia 1996 (4) SCC 119.\n \nIn fact, as long back as in 1963,\nin \nM.R.Balaji vs. State of Mysore\n 1963 Suppl. (1) SCR 439\n(at p.474) which was decided by Five learned Judges, the\nCourt said the same thing in connection with \nArticles 15(4)\n\nand \nArticle 16(4).\n Stating that \nArticle 15(4)\n and \n16(4)\n\nwere only enabling provisions, Gajendragadkar, J. ( as he\nthen was ) observed:\n\n \"In this connection, it is necessary to emphasise\nthat \nArticle 15(4)\n like \nArticle 16(4)\n is an enabling\nprovision, it does not impose an obligation, but merely\nleaves it to the discretion of the appropriate government to\ntake suitable action, if necessary.\"\n\n \nUnfortunately, all these rulings of larger Benches\nwere not brought to the notice of the Bench which decided\nAshok Kumar Gupta and Jagdish Lal and to the Benches which\nfollowed these two cases. In view of the overwhelming\nauthority right from 1963, we hold that both \nArticles 16(4)\n\nand \n16(4A)\n do not confer any fundamental rights nor do they\nimpose any constitutional duties but are only in the nature\nof enabling provision vesting a discretion in the State to\nconsider providing reservation if the circumstances\nmentioned in those Articles so warranted. We accordingly\nhold that on this aspect Ashok Kumar Gupta, Jagdishlal and\nthe cases which followed these cases do not lay down the law\ncorrectly. Power is coupled with duty: Learned senior\ncounsel for the reserved candidates, Sri K.Parasaran however\ncontended that \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n confer a\npower coupled with a duty and that it would be permissible\nto enforce such a duty by issuing a writ of mandamus.\nReliance for that purpose was placed upon \nComptroller and\nAuditor General of India, Gian Prakash vs. K.S.Jagannathan\n\n[1986 (2) SCC 679] and also on Julius vs. Lord Bishop\n(1880) 5 AC 214 which case was followed by this Court in\n\nCommissioner of Police vs. Gordhandas Bhanji\n [1952 SCR\n135]. We are unable to agree with the above contention.\n \nAs\npointed out earlier, the Constitution Bench of this Court in\n\nC.A. Rajendran Vs. Union of India\n (1968(1) SCR 721) held\nthat \nArticle 16(4)\n conferred a discretion and did not create\nany constitutional duty or obligation. In fact\n, \nin that\ncase\n, a mandamus was sought to direct the Government of\nIndia to provide for reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n in\ncertain Class I and Class II services. The Government\nstated that in the context of \nArticle 335\n and in the\ninterests of efficiency of administration at those levels,\nit was of the view that there should be no reservation. The\nsaid opinion of the Government was accepted by this Court as\nreasonable and mandamus was refused. Even in M.R. Balaji's\ncase, the Constitution Bench declared that \nArticle 16(4)\n\nconferred only a discretion.\n \nIt is true that in\n\nJagannathan\n's case, the three Judge Bench issued a mandamus,\nafter referring to \nArticle 142\n, that the Government must add\n25 marks to SC/ST candidates who had taken the S.A.S.\nExamination for promotion as Sections Officers and also\nthat, in future, a reduced minimum marks must be provided\nand announced before the examination. The Court also\nobserved that the Department had not passed orders as per a\ngeneral O.M. of the Government dated 21.9.1977.\n \nBut the\nattention of the Court was not drawn to the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench in \nC.A. Rajendran\n's case and other cases\nto which we have referred earlier. Further, if the State is\nof the opinion that in the interests of efficiency of\nadministration, reservation or relaxation in marks is not\nappropriate, then it will not be permissible for the Court\nto issue a mandamus to provide for reservation or\nrelaxation.\n \nWe also note that in \nSuperintending Engineer,\nPublic Health Vs. Kuldeep Singh\n ( \n1997(9) SCC 199),\nJagannathan\n's case was followed and reference was made to\n\nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n and to the principle that\nwhere a power is coupled with a duty as in Julius Vs. Lord\nBishop and \nCommissioner of Police Vs. Gordhandas Bhanji\n,\nthe same could be enforced by the Court.\n \nBut we may point\nout that even in \nKuldeep Singh\n's case, no reference was made\nto C.A. Rajendran and other cases. We, accordingly, hold\nthat the view in Jagannathan and Kuldeep Singh's cases that\na mandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation\nor for relaxation is not correct and runs counter to\njudgments of earlier Constitution Benches and, therefore,\nthese two judgments cannot be said to be laying down the\ncorrect law.\n\n Balancing of fundamental rights under \nArticle\n16(1)\n and the rights of reserved candidates under \nArticles\n16(4)\n and \n16(4A):\n\n \nHaving noticed that \nArticle 16(1)\n deals with a\nfundamental right and \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n are\nenabling provisions, we next come to the need for balancing\n\nArticle 16(1)\n and \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4A).\n Such a\nbalancing principle was enunciated by the Constitution Bench\nin 1963 in \nM.R. Balaji Vs. State of Mysore\n : 1963 Suppl.\n\n(1) SCR 439 wherein it was stated that the interests of the\nreserved classes must be balanced against the interests of\nother segments of society. \nIn \nIndira Sawhney\n's case, Jeevan\nReddy, J. explained how the fundamental right of the\ncitizens as declared in \nArticle 16(1)\n has to be balanced\nagainst the claims of the reserved candidates in \nArticle\n16(4).\n The learned Judge stated: (See page 734 para 808):\n\n \"It needs no emphasis to say that the principal\naim of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n is equality and equality of\nopportunity and that clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n is a means of\nachieving the very same objective. Clause (4) is a special\nprovision - though not an exception to clause (1). Both the\nprovisions have to be harmonised keeping in mind the fact\nthat both are restatements of the principles of equality\nenshrined in \nArticle 14.\n The provision under \nArticle 16(4)\n\n- conceived in the interests of certain sections of society\n\n- should be balanced against the guarantee of equality\nenshrined in clause (1) of \nArticle 16\n which is a guarantee\nheld out to every citizen and to the entire society\". The\nsame principle was reiterated in the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench in \nPost Graduate Institute of Medical\nEducation and Research vs. Faculty Association\n 1998 (4) SCC\n1 after referring to several earlier cases. It was stated :\n\n(P.22) \" The doctrine of equality of opportunity in clause\n(1) of \nArticle 16\n is to be reconciled in favour of backward\nclasses under clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n in such a manner that\nthe latter while serving the cause of backward classes shall\nnot unreasonably encroach upon the field of equality\".\n\n In Ajit Singh, in the context of seniority for the\nroster point promotees it was observed : (p.733 of SCC)\n\n \"For attracting meritorious and talented persons\ninto service, a balance has to be struck, while making\nprovisions for reservation in respect of a section of the\nsociety. This Court from time to time has been issuing\ndirections to maintain that balance....\"\n\n The above approach in Balaji in 1963, Indira\nSawhney in 1991 later in Ajit Singh in 1996 and in PGI Case\nin 1998 for striking a balance between the individuals\nrights under Articles 14 and 16(1) on the one hand and\naffirmative action under Articles 16(4) & 16(4A) on the\nother, appears to us to be on the same lines as the approach\nof the U.S. Supreme Court under the Equal Protection Clause\nin Richmond Vs. Croson and Co. (1989) 488 U.S. 469 ( at\n\n493). In that case, it was stated that while dealing with\nthe affirmative action taken in favour of African-Americans,\nthe Equal Protection Clause which conferred individual\nrights have to be kept in mind by the Courts. Justice\nSandra Day O'Connor observed:\n\n \"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment provides that \"No State shall ....deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws\" (emphasis added). As this Court has noted in the\npast, the \"rights created by the first section of the\nFourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the\nindividuals. The rights established are personal rights\"\n\n(Shelly Vs. Kraemer) 334 U.S.(1948) \"\n\n The same learned Judge, Justice Sandra Day\nO'Connor, stated again recently in Adarand Constructors Inc\nVs. Pena ( 1995) 515 U.S.200, that in such matters relating\nto affirmative action, the Court would launch an inquiry to\nensure that the\n\n \"personal right to equal protection of the laws\nhas not been infringed.\"\n\n Thus this Court has to ensure that, in matters\nrelating to affirmative action by the State, the rights\nunder \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the individual to equality of\nopportunity, are not affected. A reasonable balance has to\nbe struck so that the affirmative action does not lead to\nreverse discrimination. We shall here refer to the speech\nof Dr. Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly:\n\n \"Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in\nfull the demands of these communities who have not been so\nfar employed in the public services to the fullest extent,\nwhat would really happen is, we shall be completely\ndestroying the first proposition upon which we are all\nagreed, that there shall be equality in opportunity\".\n\n \nKrishna Iyer,J. also cautioned in \nAkhil Bharatiya\nSoshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway) Vs. Union of India\n ( 1981\n(1) SCC 246 ( at P.286) that \"care must be taken to see that\nclassification is not pushed to such an extreme point as to\nmake the fundamental right to equality cave in and\ncollapse\".\n \nThe learned Judge relied upon \nTriloki Nath\nKhosla Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir\n ( \n1974 (1) SCC 19)\nand State of Kerala Vs. Thomas\n ( 1976 (2) SCC 310).\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. stated in \nSoshit Karamchari\n Case, (para\n\n102) that reservations cannot lead to an `overkill'. At\npage 301, His Lordship said: \"The remedy of 'reservations'\nto correct inherited imbalances must not be an overkill\".\n\n In other words, affirmative action stops where\nreverse discrimination begins. (i) Efficiency of\nadministration and \nArticle 335:\n It is necessary to see that\nthe rule of adequate representation in \nArticle 16(4)\n for the\nBackward Classes and the rule of adequate representation in\npromotion for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under\n\nArticle 16(4A)\n do not adversely affect the efficiency in\nadministration. In fact, \nArticle 335\n takes care to make\nthis an express constitutional limitation upon the\ndiscretion vested in the State while making provision for\nadequate representation for the Scheduled Castes/Tribes.\nThus, in the matter of due representation in service for\nBackward Classes and Schedule Castes and Tribes, maintenance\nof efficiency of administration is of paramount importance.\nAs pointed in Indira Sawhney, the provisions of the\nConstitution must be interpreted in such a manner that a\nsense of competition is cultivated among all service\npersonnel, including the reserved categories. (ii)\nReservation and effect of the Roster Point reservation: It\nmust be noted that whenever a reserved candidate goes for\nrecruitment at the initial level (say Level 1), he is not\ngoing through the normal process of selection which is\napplied to a general candidate but gets appointment to a\npost reserved for his group. That is what is meant by\n`reservation'. That is the effect of `reservation'. Now in\na case where the reserved candidate has not opted to contest\non his merit but has opted for the reserved post, if a\nroster is set at Level 1 for promotion of the reserved\ncandidate at various roster points to level 2, the reserved\ncandidate if he is otherwise at the end of the merit list,\ngoes to Level 2 without competing with general candidates\nand he goes up by a large number of places. In a roster\nwith 100 places, if the roster points are 8, 16, 24 etc. \nat\neach of these points the reserved candidate if he is at the\nend of the merit list, gets promotion to Level 2 by\nside-stepping several general candidates. That is the\neffect of the roster point promotion. It deserves to be\nnoticed that the roster points fixed at Level 1 are not\nintended to determine any seniority at Level 1 between\ngeneral candidates and the reserved candidates. This aspect\nwe shall consider again when we come to \nMervyn Continho vs.\nCollector of Customs\n [1966 (3) SCR 600] lower down. The\nroster point merely becomes operative whenever a vacancy\nreserved at Level 2 becomes available. Once such vacancies\nare all filled, the roster has worked itself out.\nThereafter other reserved candidates can be promoted only\nwhen a vacancy at the reserved points already filled arises.\n\nThat was what was decided in \nR.K.Sabharwal vs. State of\nPunjab\n. (iii) Seniority of roster promotees: Question is\nwhether roster point promotions from Level 1 to Level 2 to\nreserved candidates will also give seniority at Level 2?\nThis is the crucial question. We shall here refer to two\nlines of argument on behalf of the reserved candidates.\n\nAjit Singh was an appeal from the judgment of the Full Bench\nof the Punjab & Haryana High Court in \nJaswant Singh Vs.\nSecretary to Govt. Punjab Education Department\n, 1989 (4)\nS.L.R. 257. In that case, reliance was placed by the\nreserved candidates on a general Circular dated 19.7.69\nissued by the Punjab Government which stated that the roster\npoint promotions would also confer seniority. In fact,\nwhile dismissing the Writ petitions filed by the general\ncandidates the High Court declared that the State was\nobliged to count seniority of the reserved candidates from\nthe date of their promotion as per the Circular dated\n19.7.69. The judgment of the Full Bench was reversed by\nthis Court in Ajit Singh in the appeal filed by the general\ncandidates. That resulted in the setting aside of the above\ndeclaration regarding seniority of roster point promotees as\nstated in the Punjab circular dated 19.7.69.. But before\nus, reliance was placed by the reserved candidates as was\ndone in Jagdish Lal, upon the general seniority Rule\ncontained in various Punjab Service Rules applicable in the\nCivil Secretariat, Education, Financial Commissioner, etc.\nDepartments which Rules generally deal with method of\nrecruitment, probation, seniority and other service\nconditions. All these Rules provide a single scheme for\nrecruitment by promotion on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit and then for seniority to be determined in the\npromotional post from the date of \"continuous officiation\",\nwhenever the promotion is as per the method prescribed in\nthose Rules. It is on this seniority rule relating to\n`continuous officiation' at the promotional level that\nreliance was placed before us by the reserved candidates, as\nwas done in Jagdish Lal. Question is whether roster points\npromotees can rely on such a seniority rule?\n\n In this context it is necessary to remember two\nfundamental concepts.\n\n (a) Statutory Rules relating to promotion and\nseniority:\n\n We shall take up the rules in one of these\nServices in Punjab - namely the rules concerning Ajit Singh\nin which the present IAs have been filed.\n\n There are three sets of Rules for Class I, II and\nIII Services. The Punjab Secretariat Class III Service\nRules, 1976 deal with the posts of clerk(Level 1),\nAssistant(Level 2) and Superintendent(Grade II)(Level 3).\nAt each of these two levels 1 and 2, there is a roster which\nimplements reservation. The reservation is by way of the\ncircular dated 19.7.1969 in Punjab. For promotion from\nlevel 1 to 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3, the employees are\nrespectively governed by Rule 7 for promotion and by Rule 9\nfor seniority. It is provided in proviso(iii) to Rule 7(1)\nthat all promotions shall be made by selection on the basis\nof seniority-cum-merit and no person shall have a right of\npromotion on the basis of seniority alone. Rule 9 speaks of\nseniority from the date of continuous officiation.\n\n The Civil Secretariat Service, Class-II Service\nrules, 1963 deal with Superintendents(Grade I) i.e. Level 4\nand Rule 8(2) states that promotion to the above posts in\nClass II is by the method of seniority-cum-merit and Rule 10\nstates that seniority is to be counted from date of\ncontinuous officiation. Above Class II is class I which\nconsists of posts of Under Secretary(Level 5) and Deputy\nSecretary(Level 6). Rule 6(3) of the Punjab Civil\nSecretariat (Class I) Rules, 1974 refers to promotion by\nseniority-cum-merit while Rule 8 thereof speaks of seniority\nby continuous officiation. For promotion to Class II and\nClass I, there is no roster promotion i.e. no reservation.\nThere is reservation only in Class III posts by way of\nroster at two stages.\n\n It is clear, therefore, that the seniority rule\nrelating to `continuous officiation' in promotion is part of\nthe general scheme of recruitment -by direct recruitment,\npromotion, etc.- in each of the Services in Class I, II and\nIII - and is based upon a principle of equal opportunity for\npromotion. In our opinion, it is only to such promotions\nthat the seniority rule of `continuous officiation' is\nattracted.\n\n (b) Statutory rule of seniority cannot be delinked\nand applied to roster-point promotions:\n\n As stated above in Ajit Singh, the promotion rule\nin Rule 7(1) proviso (iii) and the seniority Rule in Rule 9\nunder the 1976 Rules for Class III form a single scheme and\nare interlinked. In other words, only in case the officers\nhave reached the level of Superintendents Grade II(Level 3)\nin the manner mentioned in the Rule 7(1) proviso (iii) by\ncompetition between the Assistants (Level 2) and on\nconsideration of their cases on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit, can the seniority Rule in Rule 9\nrelating to continuous officiation in the post of\nSuperintendent Grade II (Level 3) be applied. Here there is\na roster in Ajit Singh for promotion from Level 1 to Level 2\nand from Level 2 to Level 3. The consequence is that in the\ncase of roster point promotees, the said candidates who get\npromoted as Superintendents Grade II (Level 3) as per the\nroster, - having not been promoted as per Rule 7(1) proviso\n\n(iii) of the 1976 Rules i.e. upon consideration with their\ncases on the basis of seniority-cum-merit at the Assistant\nlevel (Level 2), -they cannot rely upon Rule 9 of the 1976\nRules dealing with seniority from the date of \"continuous\nofficiation\" as Superintendents Grade II(Level 3). It is\nnot permissible to delink the seniority Rule from the\nrecruitment Rule based on equal opportunity and apply it to\npromotions made on the basis of the roster which promotions\nare made out side the equal opportunity principle. The\nproper balancing of rights: In the light of the above\ndiscussion, the proper balancing of the rights, in our view,\nwill be as follows.\n\n The general candidates who are senior at\nAssistants' level(Level 2) and who have reached\nSuperintendent Grade-II(Level 3) before the reserved\ncandidate moved to Level 4(Supdt. Grade- I), will have to\nbe treated as senior at the level 3 also(Supdt. Grade-II)\nand it is on that basis that promotion to the post of Level\n4 must be made, upon first considering the cases of the\nsenior general candidates at Level 3. If the cases of the\nsenior general candidates who have reached Level 3 though at\na latter point of time, are not first considered for\npromotion to Level 4, and if the roster point promotee at\nLevel 3 is treated senior and promoted to level 4, there\nwill be violation of \nArticle 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the\nConstitution of India. Such a promotion and the seniority\nat Level 4 has to be reviewed after the decision of Ajit\nSingh. But if reserved category candidate is otherwise\neligible and posts are available for promotion to Level 4,\nthey cannot be denied right to be considered for promotion\nto Level 4, merely because erstwhile seniors at the entry\nlevels have not reached Level 3. What we have stated above\naccords, in fact, with what was actually stated in Ajit\nSingh ( 1996(2) SCC 715). In that case, N.P. Singh, J\nobserved ( P. 731):\n\n \"It also cannot be overlooked that for the first\npromotion from the basic grade, there was no occasion to\nexamine their merit and suitability for promotion\".\n\n That, in our view, is the correct approach for\nbalancing the fundamental rights under \nArticle 14\n and\n\nArticle 16(1)\n on the one hand and the provisions relating to\nreservation in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A).\n\n Was Jagdish Lal correctly decided:\n\n Learned senior counsel for the reserved candidates\nhowever relied upon Jagdish Lal to contend that the roster\npromotees can count seniority in the promoted post from the\ndate of continuous officiation as against senior general\ncandidates promoted later. On the other hand, the learned\nsenior counsel for the general candidates contended that \nthe\nsaid decision\n does not lay down the law correctly. We\nshall, therefore, have to refer to Jagdishlal. We were\ninitially of the view that it may not be necessary to go\ninto the correctness of Jagdish Lal, and that we could\ndistinguish the same on the ground that all the reserved\ncandidates there had got further promotions from the\npromotional level of Dy.Superintendents* before the general\ncandidates reached that Level. But from the table set out\nin Jagdishlal, it would be noticed that \nin that case\n,\nJagdishlal, the general candidate, reached the post of\nDeputy Superintendent on 27.10.87 before the reserved\ncandidate H.S. Hira was further promoted as Superintendent\non 27.5.88. Similarly, Ram Dayal, another general candidate\ngot promoted as Deputy Superintendent\n_____________________________________________________________\n* In Jagdishlal, the hierarchy of posts is Clerk, Assistant,\nDeputy Superintendent, Superintendent, etc.\n____________________________________________________________\non 16.1.89 before the reserved candidates Sant Lal and Ajmer\nSingh got promoted as Superintendent on 8.2.90 and 1.7.90.\nIn that view of the matter, it becomes necessary to go into\nthe correctness of Jagdish Lal on merits. As we would\npresently show, in Jagdishlal, the seniority rule which\nreferred to continuous officiation and which applied to\npromotions made after providing equal opportunity as per\nrules - was delinked from the promotion rule and applied to\nroster promotees, which, in our view, was the main reason\nfor arriving at a different result. Jagdish Lal arose from\nHaryana. The Haryana Education Directorate (State Service\nClass III) Rule 1974 provided for recruitment to the posts\nof clerk (Level 1), Assistant (Level 2) and Deputy\nSuperintendent(Level 3). Rule 9(3) stated that all\npromotions would have to be made by selection based on merit\nand taking into consideration seniority but seniority alone\nwould not give any right to such promotions. Rule 11\nprovided that seniority would be counted from the date of\n\"continuous officiation\". The Court held in Jagdishlal that\nthe roster promotees who were promoted to Level 3 could\ncount their seniority from the date of continuous\nofficiation in that level in view of Rule 11. From Level 1\nto Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3, the rosters\noperated. From the level beyond Level 3, the posts were\nSuperintendent, Budget Officer, Assistant Registrar and\nRegistrar and were governed by the Haryana Education\nDepartment (State Service, Group B) Rule, 1980, and there\nwas no reservation. In those Rules also, Rule 9(3) stated\nthat all promotions would have to be made by selection based\non merit and taking into consideration seniority but\nseniority alone was not to give any right to such promotion.\nRule 11 of the 1980 Rules also stated that seniority would\ncount from the dates of continuous officiation. Thus, in\nthe Class III as well as Class II(Group B) Services, the\n\"continuous officiation\" rule was interlinked with the\npromotion rule based on equal opportunity, as in Ajit Singh,\nand formed a single scheme. The Court in Jagdish Lal\ndelinked Rule 11 from the recruitment rules and applied the\nsame to the roster promotees. For the reasons given already\nin regard to Ajit Singh, we hold that Jagdishlal arrived at\nan incorrect conclusion because of applying a rule of\ncontinuous officiation which was not intended to apply to\nthe reserved candidates promoted at roster points.\n\n \nThe various rulings relied upon in Jagdishlal do\nnot, in our opinion, support the conclusions arrived at \nin\nthat case\n. Some of these rulings were those where it was\nheld that mere empanelment in a seniority list would not\nconfer a right to promotion. Some other cases relied upon\nwere cases where it was held that mere chances of promotions\nwere not `conditions of service' which were protected. So\nfar as the cases which held that mere inclusion of a name in\na panel did not create any right to promotion, there could\nbe no quarrel with the said proposition.\n \nSo far as the\ncases like \nState of Maharashtra vs. Chandrakant Kulkarni\n\n1981 (\n4) SCC 130, Mohd. Shujat Ali vs. Union of India\n 1975\n(3) SCC 76, which held that mere chances of promotion were\nnot conditions of service, they were not applicable to the\npresent situation. It must be noticed that those cases\narose under the \nStates Reorganisation Act, 1956\n where the\nwords 'conditions of service' were used in \nSection 115(7)\n of\nthat Act. The factual position there was that when\nemployees of two different States were integrated, their\nseniority in the parent States necessarily got affected.\n\nThe proviso to \nSection 115(7)\n of the Act required that, if\nthe State to which they were allotted wanted to alter their\n\"conditions of service\", previous permission of the Central\nGovernment was necessary. It was in that context that it\nwas held that mere chances of promotions were not conditions\nof service and there was no question of seeking the sanction\nof the Central Government if chances of promotion were\naffected after allotment to a new State. In fact, the\nCentral Government, had issued orders, under \nSection 115(7)\n\nthat various other conditions of service in the parent State\nlike salary, leave etc. alone would remain protected. The\nabove cases were therefore not in point. The case in Mohd.\nBhakar vs. Y.Krishna Reddy 1967 SLR 753(SC) was in fact\noverruled in Mohd. Shujat Ali. \nSo far as \nK.Jagadeesan vs.\nUnion of India\n 1990 (2) SCC 228 was concerned, it related to\na case where a person's seniority stood affected by an\namendment to the Rules and it was held that that did not\nmake the rule retrospective.\n \nSyed Khalid Rizvi vs. Union\nof India\n 1993 Suppl. (3) SCC 575 no doubt said that there\nwas no \"right to promotion\" but even that case accepted that\nthere was a right to be \"considered\" for promotion.\n \nSo far\nas \nAkhil Bhartiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh vs. Union of\nIndia\n 1996 (6) SCC 65 to which one of us (G.B.Pattanaik,J.\nwas party). That case, in our view, was correctly decided\non facts because by the date the general candidate reached\nthe higher category, the reserved category promotee who\nreached that category earlier had got a further promotion.\n\nReference was also made in \nJagdish Lal, to A.K. Bhatnagar\nvs. Union of India\n 1991 (1) SCC 544. That was a case where\nadhoc recruits were regularised subsequently and were placed\nbelow regular recruits. It was held that their past adhoc\nservice could not be taken into account since they remained\nout of the cadre until regularisation. That case, in our\nview, has also no application. Jagdish Lal is, therefore,\nnot correctly decided.\n\n \nObservations in Ashok Kumar Gupta which run\ncontrary to Indira Sawhney & Sabharwal do not lay down\ncorrect law: We may state that there are various other\nobservations made in Ashok Kumar Gupta and we find that they\nrun counter to the principles \nlaid down by\n the nine Judge\nBench in Indira Sawhney and the Constitution Bench in\nSabharwal. In our view, these observations must, therefore,\nbe treated as not laying down the correct law. Learned\ncounsel for the parties were in agreement with this live of\napproach. We, therefore, leave Ashok Kumar Gupta and do not\ndeal with it any further.\n\n Was Virpal not decided correctly, as contended by\nreserved candidates?:\n\n \nWe then come to another important point that was\nargued by learned senior counsel Sri K.Parasaran. It was\nargued that in Virpal, the Court was concerned with a\ncircular of the Railways dated 31.8.82 which permitted\ndiscounting the seniority of roster promotee from the date\nof continuous officiation and which also stated that his\nseniority should be as per the ranking in the basic level.\nThe Court in Virpal held that it was \"permissible\" for the\nGovernment to do so. It was argued by Sri K.Parasaran that\nit was one thing to say that it was \"open\" to the Government\nto deprive the roster promotee of the benefit of such\nseniority from the date of roster promotion but it was\nanother thing to say that even if the Government thought fit\nto give benefit of seniority on the basis of roster\npromotion, the same should be tested on the anvil of \nArticle\n14\n and \n16(1)\n of the Constitution of India. Thus, it was\nargued that Ajit Singh went far beyond Virpal when it held\nthat any circular, order or rule granting seniority to the\nroster promotee would be violative of \nArticle 14\n and \n16(1)\n\nof the Constitution of India. That brings us to a close\nexamination of the main principle \nlaid down in\n Virpal and in\nAjit Singh. We shall first take up Virpal. In Virpal, the\nfacts were that the Court was concerned with a circular\ndated 31.8.82 of the Railways which stated that the\nseniority of the roster promotees would be based on their\npanel position in the initial grade. The case involved two\nservices - Guards and Station Masters. Railways Guards\nwould be recruited as Guard C and promoted as Guard B, then\nas Guard A and as Guard (Special). Promotion was to be by\nrule of seniority-cum-suitability. In other words, these\nwere non-selection posts. On the other hand, in the case of\nStation Masters, a selection process was involved for\npurposes of promotion.\n\n It is argued by the reserved candidates that\nVirpal was not correctly decided because in Virpal, the\nCourt went by a printed Brochure and committed a factual\nmistake in thinking that the circular of the Railways itself\nrequired the panel seniority at the initial level to be\nreflected at higher levels. The same point was raised by\nthe Indian Railways in its intervention applications IAs\n10-12/98. It was argued that in Virpal the Court erred in\nnot noticing the full text of the Circular dated 31.8.82\nwhich, showed that, as per para 319 of the Railway\nEstablishment Code, Vol.1, panels were required to be\nprepared at each level.\n\n We have examined Virpal closely in the light of\nthe above objection. In our view, the above criticism is\nwholly unjustified and is based upon a wrong mixing up of\nthe separate conclusions arrived at in Virpal in regard to\ntwo different sets of employees. As stated earlier, the\nCourt was there concerned with posts of Railway Guards and\nalso with posts of Station Masters. The former ( i.e.\nGuard posts) were posts governed by the rule of\nseniority-cum-suitability. In other words, for Guards,\nseniority would govern subject to omission of those found\nunsuitable for promotion. On the other hand, Station\nMasters' posts were governed by selection at every level of\npromotion. The learned Judge, Justice Jeevan Reddy, while\ndealing initially with the promotions of Guards ( See P.702\nof SCC) from C Grade to B, from B to A, and from A to\nSpecial Grade A pointed out that the seniority- cum-fitness\nrule applicable in their cases resulted in the seniority at\nthe Level of Guard C in the initial panel being reflected\nfrom stage to stage, subject to fitness. When the learned\nJudge came to discuss the issues relating to Station\nMasters,(See SCC P.711) where merit and selection were\ninvolved, the learned Judge stated that separate panels were\nto be prepared at every level and also that those in an\nearlier panel would be senior to those in a latter panel.\nIn either situation, it was laid down that the reserved\ncandidates could not count their 'seniority' on the basis of\nroster point promotion. Learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral, Sri C.S. Vaidyanathan, attempted to argue that\nwhat the Court said in para 25, 26 was wrong as it assumed\nthat seniority at Level 1 would get reflected in the levels\nhigher up and what is stated in para 46, 47 in regard to one\nprevious panel having priority over a later panel would\napply in all cases, even to Guards referred to in paras 25,\n\n26. The said contention, in our view, is based on a mixing\nup of the cases of Station Masters and Guards who were\ngoverned by different rules of promotion. We are satisfied\nthat there is no factual mistake committed in the judgment\nin Virpal. In fact, subsequent to Virpal, the Railways\naccepted the judgment and issued an order on 28.2.1997 both\nin regard to non-selection and selection posts. The point\nraised in the IAs by the Railways is therefore liable to be\nrejected. We shall refer to these IAs again in our separate\njudgment relating to individual cases. Did Ajit Singh go\nbeyond Virpal and if so, was it correctly decided? We now\ndeal with the points raised by the reserved candidates\nagainst the correctness of Ajit Singh. It was urged by\nlearned senior counsel Sri K.Parasaran, that Ajit Singh went\nfar beyond Virpal. It is pointed out that in Virpal, this\nCourt was concerned with a circular of the Railways which\nstated that the roster promotees could not, on that count,\nclaim seniority. In that context, Jeevan Reddy, J. no\ndoubt stated in Virpal ( See 1995 (6) SCC 684 at 701) as\nfollows:\n\n \"In short, it is open to the State, if it is so\nadvised ...... It is permissible for the State to do so.\"\n\nBut, according to learned senior counsel, Sri K. Parasaran,\nin Ajit Singh, this Court went further and stated that any\nrule, circular or order which gave seniority to the roster\npoint promotees was bad and that this view is not correct.\nOur attention is invited to 1996 (2) SCC 715 ( at 732) as\nfollows:\n\n \"According to us, this question cannot be examined\nonly on the basis of any circular, order or rule issued or\nframed by the State Government or the Union of India. This\nhas to be tested on the basis of our constitutional scheme\nof \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\"\n\n In our opinion, there is no conflict in the\nprinciples \nlaid down in\n these two judgments, nor is there\nanything wrong in the above elucidation of the law. In\nVirpal it was not necessary for the Court to go into the\nquestion whether any circular - if it gave seniority to the\nroster point promotees (reserved candidates) - could be\ntreated as valid. But, in Ajit Singh which was an appeal\nagainst the Full Bench Judgment in Jaswant singh 1989 (4)\nSLR 257, this Court was dealing with a declaration made by\nthe Full Bench for implementation of the Punjab circular\ndated 19.7.69 (see para 29 of Full Bench) which positively\ndeclared that the \"roster points were seniority points\".\nThat was why in Ajit Singh this Court had to consider the\nvalidity of such a Circular. In Ajit Singh this Court held\nthat the declaration granted in the impugned judgment of the\nFull Bench in Jaswant singh on the basis of the Punjab\ncircular would be in conflict with \nArticle 14\n and \nArticle\n16(1).\n This Court had therefore to lay down that any\ncircular, order or rule issued to confer seniority to the\nroster point promotees, would be invalid. Thus, the\ndecision in Ajit Singh cannot be found fault with. Does\nIndira Sawhney protect seniority of promotees at roster\npoint: Learned senior counsel Sri K.Parasaran contended\nthat Indira Sawhney permitted reservations in promotions for\na further period of 5 years and that during that period\n\nArticle 16(4A)\n was incorporated in Part III of the\nConstitution and, therefore, the concept of seniority\nattached to the roster promotion, as per certain rulings\nthen in force, must be deemed to continue and deemed to be\npermissible in view of \nArticle 16(4A).\n We may point out\nthat Indira Sawhney did not have to go into issues relating\nto seniority and on the other hand it referred to the\nprinciple of balancing \nArticle 16(4)\n against the rights of\nthe individual under \nArticle 16(1).\n It is, therefore, not\npossible to accept that the 5 year rule and \nArticle 16(4A)\n\nwould keep out the applicability of \nArticle 16(1)\n to test\nthe validity of any circular, order or rule which conferred\nseniority to the roster point promotees. Do principles in\nMervyn Continho 1966 (3) SCR 60 apply to reserved\ncandidates? Does the roster point for reserved candidates\nat Level 1 decide seniority at Level 1? \nConsiderable\nreliance was placed by learned senior counsel Sri D.D.Thakur\nand Sri Raju Ramachandran on the decision of this Court in\n\nMervyn Continho & Others vs. Collector of Customs\n 1966 (3)\nSCR 600.\n\n In that case, the service was constituted from two\nsources, namely direct recruits and promotees. Question of\nseniority arose at two levels - at the level of Appraisers\nand at the level of Principal Appraisers. At the initial\nlevel of Appraisers, there was a roster for determining the\nseniority of the direct recruits and promotees. The direct\nrecruits were placed first in the roster and then the\npromotees alternatively at the basic level. The promotees\nwho joined service earlier questioned the above rule as\nbeing violative of their seniority at the level of\nAppraisers in view of \nArticle 16(1).\n This challenge was\nnegatived by this Court on the ground that such 'anomalies\narise not on account of there being no direct recruitment\nfor several years' and the roster point seniority was not\nopposed to the principle of equality of opportunity in\nGovernment service. It was said that the anomaly arose out\nof the fortuitous circumstance that in the particular\nservice of Appraisers, for one reason or other, direct\nrecruitment had fallen short of the quota fixed for it. The\nCourt said: \"we are not prepared to say that the rotational\nsystem of fixing seniority itself offends equality of\nopportunity....\". To this extent the Court held against the\npromotees in regard to seniority at the basic level of\nAppraisers. The point here is the roster points in the case\nof reserved candidates do not determine seniority at the\nbasic level.\n\n Learned senior counsel for the reserved candidates\nhowever relied upon the second part of Mervyn which related\nto seniority at the next level of Principal Appraisers. It\nwas the contention of the direct recruits-respondents that\nhere again the seniority should be alternated between direct\nrecruits and promotees as done at the basic level, though\nthere was no such rule. Here, the promotee Appraisers\ncontended that the seniority at the level of Principal\nAppraisers would be governed by the rule of continuous\nofficiation and that there can be no rotation alternatively\nat this higher level on the basis of birthmarks at the level\nof Appraisers. This plea of the promotees was accepted by\nthis Court. The point here is that once the roster at the\nlevel of Appraisers is one which fixed seniority at level 1,\npromotions to Level 2 for Principal Appraisers, have\nnecessarily to be made on that basis. For fixing seniority\nat Level 2, there is no question of placing direct recruits\nand promotees alternatively. It has to be on the basis of\ndate of promotion of each of the officers to Level 2,\nirrespective of their birthmarks. The above decision in\nMervyn cannot apply to a case of reservation because the\nroster in Mervyn was intended to determine seniority while\nthe roster in the cases of reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n\nor \nArticle 16(4A)\n are not intended to determine seniority\nbut are merely intended to provide \"adequate representation\"\n\nat the promotional level. To what extent, Hiralal,\nKaramchand and Kailash Chand Joshi's cases help the reserved\ncandidates? Learned senior counsel for the reserved\ncandidates placed strong reliance on three other decisions\nof this Court namely, \nState of Punjab vs. Hira Lal\n 1970 (\n3)\nSCC 567, Karam Chand vs. Haryana State Electricity Board\n\n1989 Suppl.\n \n(\n1) SCC 342 and Kailash Chand Joshi vs.\nRajasthan High\n Court 1996 (1) SCALE 752.\n \nIn \nHira Lal\n's case\ndecided by a three Judge Bench, there was a circular issued\nby the Punjab Government providing, for the first time,\nreservation in promotional posts. The 1st respondent who\nwas a general candidate senior to the reserved candidate\n(respondent 3) was not promoted while the reserved candidate\nthough junior, was promoted. The High Court allowed the\nwrit petition filed by the general candidate (1st\nrespondent) on the ground of violation of \nArticle 16(1).\n\nThe said judgment was set aside in view of the law \nlaid down\nin\n the \nGeneral Manager, Southern Railway vs. Rangachari\n\n1962 (2) SCR 586 that reservation was permissible at the\npromotional level. In that case, the Court had no occasion\nto consider any circular prescribing seniority to the roster\npromotees. That case is therefore not in point.\nKaramchand, decided by a two Judge Bench was, no doubt,\nconcerned with the question of seniority of the roster point\npromotee. The appellant, who was from the reserved\ncategory, belonged to the Haryana State Electricity Board\nand the Haryana Government's circular dated 27.4.72 pointed\nout that the roster was meant only for reservation and not\nfor fixing inter-se-seniority and that seniority depended\nupon the merit list prepared by the Public Service\nCommission or Selection Board. But the appellant, the\nreserved candidate relied upon Rule 9 of the Punjab\nPWD(Electricity Branch) Service Class III(Subordinate Posts)\nrules, 1952 where Rule 9 provided seniority to be determined\nfrom the date of \"regular\" promotion. The limited dispute\nwas whether his case fell within the \"Exception\" in Rule 9\nwhich related to \"temporary\" promotees who would not get\nseniority upon such temporary promotion. The contention of\nthe Board that he was a temporary promotee was not accepted\nby this Court on the facts of the case. No question\nvis-a-vis a general candidate arose. There are indeed\ncertain observations that seniority of the reserved\ncandidate had to be counted from the date of regular\npromotion which, in our opinion, are not correct. No\nquestion of \nArticle 16(1)\n or seniority as against a general\ncandidate arose. That case is distinguishable. In Kailash\nChand Joshi the appellant, who was senior, belonged to the\nnon- reserved category in the cadre of Munsifs. The\nrespondents 3 to 11 though junior in that cadre to the\nappellant, were promoted as Civil Judges earlier on the\nbasis of roster. The general candidate (appellant ) got\npromoted as Civil Judge later and claimed seniority in the\ncadre of Civil Judge. By that date the roster promotee did\nnot get any further promotion. This was not accepted by\nthis Court in view of Rule 11. There are two aspects of\nthis decision. Firstly, the Court did not notice that once\nthe general candidate, the appellant, who was senior to the\nrespondents reached the level of Civil Judge, the position\nwould be different. Such a principle, in fact, came to be\nlaid down shortly thereafter in Virpal by the same learned\nJudge who decided Kailash Chand Joshi. Secondly, it was not\nnoticed that Rule 22 relating to seniority from the date of\ncontinuous officiation was closely interlinked with the\npromotional Rule based on equal opportunity. We may state\nthat any observations in the above cases that the roster\npromotees will get seniority over the senior general\ncandidates who reach that level later, (but before the\nfurther promotion of the reserved candidate) cannot be\naccepted as correct in view of the legal position stated\nearlier. A 'poignant scenario' in some cases: We next come\nto the poignant scenario in several of the matters before\nus. Virpal referred to such a scenario where all the 33\ncandidates who were to be considered for 11 vacancies were\nfrom the SC/ST category ( see P.710 of SCC). Before us,\nsimilar facts are placed by the general candidates. The\nfactual position is not disputed, though certain reasons\nhave been set out by both sides which none has\nscientifically examined. It is to be noticed that : (i) in\nAjit Singh itself, - (see p.76 and PP.200-215, 232 of paper\nbook) as on 30.9.94 out of 107 officers working as\nSuperintendent Grade I, the first 23 officers are from\nScheduled Castes. At the level of Under Secretaries, out of\n19, the first 11 are from SC category. In the category of\nDy. Secretary, out of four, 2 are from SC category. As on\n30.9.94, the position was that at these levels, the\npercentage was 22.5%, 54% and 67% respectively in the above\ncategories. If the seniority is to be counted as per the\ncase of the reserved candidates, the position would be that\nDy. Secretaries would be 100% manned by Scheduled Castes,\nand Under Secretaries would again be 100% manned by\nScheduled Castes while Superintendents Grade I would be so\nmanned to the extent of 53%.\n\n \n(ii) In \nJatinderpal Singh\n's case ( C.A.Nos. 316-\n\n317/99) the top 134 positions of Principals ( from Head\nMasters' source) would be from Scheduled Castes while the\ntop 72 positions ( from Head Mistress's source) would be\nfrom Scheduled Castes. It is stated that \" adding this to\nthe number awaiting promotions\", the position would be that\ntop 217 and 111 in these categories would be Scheduled\ncastes candidates - which would be 100% and 71% ( the posts\nbeing only 156 under each source). One does not know what\nwill happen in posts beyond Principal, if all persons in the\nzone are from SC/ST category.\n\n (iii) In Kamal Kant (SLP.4945/97 from Haryana ) as\nof today: (a) among Deputy Secretaries, the first 8 posts\nare occupied by the reserved category ( Scheduled Castes and\nBackward Classes) (b) among Under Secretaries (Group A)\n(officiating) 14 posts at the higher levels are occupied by\nthe reserved category.\n\n The above factual position is not, in fact\ndisputed but it is said that this could be because the\nroster was operated again and again till that was stopped\nafter Sabbarwal was decided, but no body has gone into the\nextent to which excess roster operation has created such a\nsituation.\n\n In the written submissions of learned senior\ncounsel, Sri Raju Ramachandran dated 5.8.99, such a\nsituation of almost all top posts being manned by reserved\ncandidates is sought to be justified as being not\nconstitutionally inhibited. In our view, such a situation\nwas never intended by the founding fathers. One should only\nread the speech of Dr. Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly\nas quoted in Indira Sawhney (see pp.660-661 SCC)(referred to\nearlier).\n\n We may, however, make it clear that our decision\nin regard to the \nArticle 16(1)\n, \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle\n16(4A)\n that the rule of \"continuous officiation\" is\napplicable only to promotions made as per rules which give\nequal opportunity - and not otherwise, -is independently\narrived at on the basis of the constitutional position and\nis in no way coloured or influenced by the above facts\nmentioned by the general candidates. Our Conclusions on\nPoints 1 and 2: We, therefore, hold that the roster point\npromotees (reserved category) cannot count their seniority\nin the promoted category from the date of their continuous\nofficiation in the promoted post, - vis- a-vis the general\ncandidates who were senior to them in the lower category and\nwho were later promoted. On the other hand, the senior\ngeneral candidate at the lower level, if he reaches the\npromotional level later but before the further promotion of\nthe reserved candidate-he will have to be treated as senior,\nat the promotional level, to the reserved candidate even if\nthe reserved candidate was earlier promoted to that level.\nWe shall explain this further under Point 3. We also hold\nthat Virpal and Ajit Singh have been correctly decided and\nthat Jagdishlal is not correctly decided. Point 1 and 2 are\ndecided accordingly. Point 3: During the discussion under\nthis \"catch-up\" point - for purposes of convenience, - we\ntake the example of the cadres in Ajit Singh i.e. there is\nroster point promotion for reserved candidates for promotion\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3. There\nis no roster for promotion from Level 3 to Level 4. Two\n'catch up' rules contended for by general candidates: Now,\nas stated earlier, the counsel for the general candidates\nargued for acceptance of two catch-up rules. .pa Extreme\n'catch-up' rule: So far as the extreme contention of the\ngeneral candidates that at Level 3, the roster candidate\nmust wait at Level 3 - before being promoted to Level 4 -\ntill the last senior general candidate at Level 1 reached\nLevel 3, - we reject the same in as much as that will not\namount to a reasonable balancing of the rights of the\ncandidates in the two groups. Nor do we accept that posts\nmust be kept vacant and no promotions of the roster\ncandidates be made. Other Catch-up rule: As accepted in\nVirpal ( see 1995(6) SCC 684 at 702) and Ajit Singh (see\n1996(2) SCC at P.729), we hold that in case any senior\ngeneral candidate at Level 2 (Assistant) reaches Level 3 (\nSuperintendent Grade II) before the reserved candidate\n(roster point promotee) at Level 3 goes further up to Level\n4 \nin that case\n the seniority at Level 3 has to be modified\nby placing such a general candidate above the roster\npromotee, reflecting their inter se seniority at Level 2.\nFurther promotion to Level 4 must be on the basis of such a\nmodified seniority at Level 3, namely, that the senior\ngeneral candidate of Level 2 will remain senior also at\nLevel 3 to the reserved candidate, even if the latter had\nreached Level 3 earlier and remained there when the senior\ngeneral candidate reached that Level 3. In cases where the\nreserved candidate has gone upto Level 4 ignoring the\nseniority of the senior general candidate at Level 3,\nseniority at Level 4 has to be refixed (when the senior\ngeneral candidate is promoted to Level 4) on the basis of\nwhen the time of reserved candidate for promotion to Level 4\nwould have come, if the case of the senior general\ncandidates was considered at Level 3 in due time. To the\nabove extent, we accept the first part of the contention of\nthe learned counsel for the general candidates. Such a\nprocedure in our view will properly balance the rights of\nthe reserved candidates and the fundamental rights\nguaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n to the general candidates.\n\nNo difficulty in amending seniority list: One of the\nobjections raised before us and which appealed to the Full\nBench in \nJaswant Singh\n's case was that this 'catch up'\nprinciple would lead to frequent alteration of the seniority\nlist at Level 3. We do not find any difficulty in this\nbehalf. The seniority list at Level 3 would have only to be\nmerely amended whenever the senior general candidate reaches\nLevel 3. Examples given by reserved candidates -do not\ncreate any anomaly: Learned senior counsel Sri K.\nParasaran and Sri Raju Ramachandran then adverted to a\nsituation which according to them might create serious\nproblems if a senior general candidate is to be treated as\nsenior at the promotional level if he reaches that level\nbefore the roster promotee goes further up. The example\ngiven refer to cases where after the roster point promotee\n(reserved candidate) reaches the promotional level, there is\ndirect recruitment or recruitment by transfer at that\npromotional level. Counsel submit that, if a senior general\ncandidate is thereafter promoted and placed above the\nreserved candidate, can he became senior to the direct\nrecruit and transferee? We do not find any anomaly. The\ndirect recruit or transferee who has no grievance against\nthe reserved candidate who was already there can have no\ngrievance against a senior general candidate who has a\nsuperior claim, in law, against the reserved candidate.\nEven if seniority of roster point promotee does not Count,\nexperience of both groups can be considered as part of merit\nfor further promotion: Before we leave point 3, we may\nrefer to another submission made by Sri K. Parasaran,\nlearned senior counsel for the reserved candidates. Learned\ncounsel submitted that even if the seniority of the reserved\ncandidates had gone up to Level 3 earlier by the roster at\ntwo levels 1 & 2 is not counted, still the 'experience'\ngained by them at Level 3 well before the senior general\ncandidate 'caught up' to that Level, cannot be disregarded\nfor purposes of promotion to Level 4. It is true that the\nroster point promotee who has reached the promotional level\n3 even if he is not entitled to seniority would have gained\nconsiderable `experience' at that level. That experience\nis, no doubt, of considerable relevance in considering his\ncase for further promotion to Level 4. But, at the same\ntime, it is to be noted that the general candidates had\nlonger experience at level 1 and level 2 and have come up to\nlevel 3 by way of competition among the general candidates\nat two stages. The said longer `experience' gained by them\nat the lower levels 1 and 2 and the manner in which they\nhave reached the level 3 to which the reserved candidate had\nreached earlier, are also relevant factors. The quality of\nthe experience of these groups also needs to be kept in\nview. The above principle would be an equitable balancing\nof the `experience' of the candidates at various levels. It\nwill be appropriate for the Government of India or the State\nGovernment, as the case may be, to formulate guidelines by\nway of administrative orders or by way of rules in this\nbehalf. Point 3 is disposed of accordingly. Point 4: This\npoint concerns the \"prospective\" operation of the two\njudgments in Sabharwal and Ajit Singh. The point regarding\nthese two cases directly arises in the appeals from Punjab,\nHaryana and Rajasthan. The prospectivity of Virpal has been\nparticularly raised by learned Additional Solicitor General,\nSri C.S. Vaidyanathan, in the IAs filed by the Railways.\nOnce again our approach here is to prevent reversions and\navoid hardship to the reserved candidates already promoted\nbefore the two judgments and at the same time to try to\nbalance the rights to seniority of the general candidates as\nagainst those of the reserved candidates, in the light of\n\nArticle 16(1).\n Prospectivity of Sabharwal:\n\n (i) What Sabbarwal said in regard to\n\"prospectivity\":\n\n Before Sabharwal was decided on 10.2.1995, it\nappears that, in several services, the roster was initially\nput in operation and promotions at all the roster points\nwere filled up. But the roster was once again operated on\nfuture vacancies, even though all the required reserved\ncandidates were in position at the promotional level. It\nwas not realised that once the roster points were all\nfilled, the roster had served its purpose and fresh members\nof the reserved classes could claim promotional posts only\nif any promotional posts already filled by the reserved\ncandidates fell vacant. This misapplication of the roster\ncame to be removed for the first time on 10.2.95 when\nSabharwal was decided. Obviously, by that time several\nreserved candidates had got promotion in excess of their\nquota because of the wrong \"re- operation\" of the roster\npoints. If the law declared in Sabbarwal were to be treated\nas retroactive as is the normal position whenever the law is\ndeclared by this Court, it would have resulted in reversions\nof several officers of the reserved classes as their\npromotions before 10.2.95 by the fresh operation of the\nroster as aforesaid was wholly unjustified. This Court in\nSabbarwal therefore tried to prevent such reversions and\ndeclared ( P. 753 of SCC, Para 11) as follows at the end of\nthe judgment:\n\n \"We, however, direct that the interpretation given\nby us to the working of the roster and our findings on this\npoint shall be operative prospectively\".\n\n (ii) The rival contentions: To the extent of\nsaving the reversions of those from reserved classes\npromoted before 10.2.95 though such promotions were made\ncontrary to what was decided in Sabharwal, there is no\nserious dispute from the side of the general candidates, but\na contention is raised by the reserved candidates who got\nsuch promotions in excess of the reservation quota that they\nshould in addition get the benefit of the seniority in the\npromotional post even if such promotion made before 10.2.95\nwas wrong in view of what was decided in Sabharwal . This\nplea is strongly opposed by the general candidates. (iii)\nOur conclusion: It is axiomatic in service jurisprudence\nthat any promotions made wrongly in excess of any quota are\nto be treated as ad hoc. This applies to reservation quota\nas much as it applies to direct recruits and promotee cases.\nIf a Court decides that in order only to remove hardship\nsuch roster point promotees are not to face reversions, -\nthen it would, in our opinion be, necessary to hold -\nconsistent with our interpretation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n\n- that such promotees cannot plead for grant of any\nadditional benefit of seniority flowing from a wrong\napplication of the roster. In our view, while Courts can\nrelieve immediate hardship arising out of a past illegality,\nCourts cannot grant additional benefits like seniority which\nhave no element of immediate hardship. Thus, while\npromotions in excess of roster made before 10.2.95 are\nprotected, such promotees cannot claim seniority. Seniority\nin the promotional cadre of such excess roster point\npromotees shall have to be reviewed after 10.2.95 and will\ncount only from the date on which they would have otherwise\ngot normal promotion in any future vacancy arising in a post\npreviously occupied by a reserved candidate. That disposes\nof the 'prospectivity'' point in relation to Sabharwal.\nProspectivity of Ajit Singh:\n\n Coming to the 'prospectivity' of Ajit Singh,\ndecided on 1.3.96 the question is in regard to the seniority\nof the reserved candidates at the promotional level where\nsuch promotions have taken place before 1.3.96. We have\naccepted, while dealing with Points 1 and 2 that the\nreserved candidates who get promoted at two levels by roster\npoints ( say) from Level 1 to Level 2 and level 2 to level 3\ncannot count their seniority at Level 3 as against senior\ngeneral candidates who reached Level 3 before the reserved\ncandidates moved upto Level 4. The general candidate has to\nbe treated as senior at Level 3. Where, before 1.3.96,i.e.\nthe date of Ajit Singh's judgment , at the level 3, there\nwere reserved candidates who reached there earlier and also\nsenior general candidates who reached there later, (but\nbefore the reserved candidate was promoted to level 4) and\nwhen in spite of the fact that the senior general candidate\nhad to be treated as senior at level 3 (in view of Ajit\nSingh), the reserved candidate is further promoted to level\n\n4 - without considering the fact that the senior general\ncandidate was also available at level 3 - then, after\n1.3.96, it becomes necessary to review the promotion of the\nreserved candidate to level 4 and reconsider the same\n(without causing reversion to the reserved candidate who\nreached level 4 before 1.3.96). As and when the senior\nreserved candidate is later promoted to level 4, the\nseniority at level 4 has also to be refixed on the basis of\nwhen the reserved candidate at level 3 would have got his\nnormal promotion, treating him as junior to the senior\ngeneral candidate at level 3. Chander Paul Vs. State of\nHaryana ( 1997(10) SCC 474) has to be understood in the\nmanner stated above. We hold accordingly on Point 4. We\ndispose of the clarification applications IAs 1 to 3/98\nfiled by the State of Punjab accordingly and hold that Ajit\nSingh and Virpal lay down the correct law and not Jagdish\nLal, which must be considered as confined to its own\npeculiar facts. We shall be passing separate orders in the\nPunjab, Haryana and Rajasthan cases and Contempt Cases and\nother IAs on the basis of the principles laid down in this\njudgment which, for convenience will be called Ajit Singh\nII. IAs Nos.1 to 3/98 are disposed of accordingly.",

How these IAs 1-3 came to be filed for\nclarification:?\n \nThe circumstances under which the State of\nPunjab has filed these IAs for clarification are as\nfollows:- Initially, in a case relating to the Indian\nRailways, a two Judge Bench of this Court in \nUnion of India\nvs. Virpal Singh\n [1995 (6) SCC 685] (hereinafter referred\nto as Virpal) held that it was \"permissible\" for the\nRailways to say that reserved candidates who get promotion\nat the roster points would not be entitled to claim\nseniority at the promotional level as against senior general\ncandidates who got promoted at a later point of time to the\nsame level. It was further held that \"it would be open\" to\nthe State to provide that as and when the senior general\ncandidate got promoted under the rules, - whether by way of\na seniority rule or a selection rule - to the level to which\nthe reserved candidate was promoted earlier, the general\ncandidate would have to be treated as senior to the reserved\ncandidate (the roster point promotee) at the promotional\nlevel as well, unless, of course, the reserved candidate got\na further promotion by that time to a higher post. (This is\ndescribed for convenience, as the 'catch up' rule) Close on\nthe heels of Virpal, came Ajit Singh from Punjab, before a\nthree Judge Bench and the Bench held that the question of\nseniority at the promotional level had to be decided by\napplying the provisions of \nArticle 14\n and \n16 (1)\n and if any\norder, circular or rule provided that such reserved\ncandidates who got promotions at roster points were to be\ntreated as senior to the senior general candidates who were\npromoted later, then such an order, circular or rule would\nbe violative of \nArticle 14\n and \n16(1).\n It was, however, held\nthat the position would be different if by the time the\nsenior general candidate got his promotion under the normal\nrules of seniority or selection, the reserved candidate who\nwas promoted earlier at the roster point, had got a further\npromotion. In other words, the `catch up' principle as \nlaid\ndown in\n Virpal was accepted.\n \nIn coming to the above\nconclusions, the three Judge Bench relied upon the\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n the nine Judge Bench in \nIndira\nSawhney vs. Union of India\n [1992 Suppl.\n \n(3) SCC 251] and\nby the Constitution Bench in \nR.K.Sabharwal vs. State of\nPunjab\n [1995 (2) SCC 745]. These two cases had laid down\nearlier the manner in which the rights of the general\ncandidates and the reserved candidates ought to be balanced."

The\nContentions in brief: Sri Hardev Singh, learned senior\ncounsel for the State of Punjab submitted that since Jagdish\nLal decided something contrary to Virpal and Ajit Singh the\nState was in a `quandary what to do. In these IAs and the\nconnected batch of cases which have been listed together and\nheard, contentions have been raised by Sri Rajeev Dhawan for\nthe State of Haryana and Sri Altaf Ahmad, Additional\nSolicitor General of India for the State of Rajasthan and\nthe Union of India. According to the learned counsel the\n'roster point promotees', ( i.e. a reserved candidate at\nLevel 1 who is promoted to Level 2 at the roster point meant\nfor such promotion) namely, the reserved candidates cannot\nclaim seniority on the basis of continuous officiation.\nHowever, learned Additional Solicitor General, Sri C.S.\nVaidyanathan for the Indian Railways has taken a contrary\nstand-, in spite of the fact that Railways has already\naccepted Virpal and issued a circular on 28.2.1997 -that\nroster point promotions in the Railways did not confer\nseniority. Senior counsel Sri Harish Salve and others for\nthe general candidates contended that Virpal and Ajit Singh\nwere correctly decided and Jagdish Lal was wrongly decided.\nSenior counsel Sri K. Parasaran, Sri D.D. Thakur, Sri M.N.\nRao, and others including Sri Jose P. Verghese for the\nreserved candidates relied upon Jagdish Lal and they\ncontended that Virpal and Ajit Singh were wrongly decided.\nThe validity of the 'catch-up' rule accepted in Virpal and\nAjit Singh in favour of general candidates was also put in\nissue. One additional point was also argued. This related\nto the \"prospectivity\" of R.K.Sabharwal and Ajit Singh. In\nR.K.Sabharwal this Court has held that once the roster point\npromotions were all made in respect of the reserved\ncandidates, the roster ceased to operate. Unless any of the\nreserved candidates already promoted had retired or been\nfurther promoted etc. and unless there was a vacancy\ngenerated at the points already filled, fresh candidates\nfrom the reserved candidates could not be promoted by\nfurther operation of the roster. Having so held, the Court\nsaid that the judgment would be \"prospective\". The reserved\ncandidates now contend that the above direction means that\nnot only the reserved candidates so promoted in excess of\nthe roster points could not be reverted but that their\nseniority against such excess promotions was also protected\nvide Sabharwal."

Learned counsel\n submitted that the founding fathers were conscious\n that a special provision for reservation was\n necessary to see that the backward classes of\n citizens were adequately represented in the\n services. Hence an interpretation which would\n advance the said objective must be applied.\n Reliance was also placed on the Statement of\n Objects and Reasons in connection with the\n incorporation of \nArticle 16(4A).\n In fact, all the\n learned counsel appearing for the reserved\n candidates contended that the said officers could\n not be treated as equals to the general candidates\n and that their backwardness and past social\n oppression must be borne in mind. Nobody can deny\n that the above approach is the proper one while\n dealing with the reserved classes. The primary\n purpose of \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4A)\n is due\n representation of certain classes in certain\n posts. However, we must bear in mind and not\n ignore that there are other provisions, namely,\n \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution which are also very important. The\n Constitution has \nlaid down in\n \nArticles 14\n and\n \n16(1)\n the permissible limits of affirmative action\n by way of reservation under \nArticles 16(4)\n and\n \n16(4A).\n While permitting reservations at the same\n time, it has also placed certain limitations by\n way of \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n so that there is no\n reverse discrimination. It has also incorporated\n \nArticle 335\n so that the efficiency of\n administration is not jeopardized. While\n interpreting provisions of the Constitution and in\n particular fundamental rights of citizens, it is\n well to bear in mind certain fundamental concepts.\n In McCulloch Vs. Maryland ( 1819) 4 Wheel (17\n U.S.316), Chief Justice Marshall cautioned that we\n must keep in mind that it is the Constitution that\n we are expounding. He said that the Constitution\n was intended to endure for ages to come and had\n consequently to be adapted to the various crises\n of human affairs from time to time. Brandeis J\n wrote : \"Our Constitution is not a straight\n jacket. It is a living organism. As such it is\n capable of growth, of expansion and of adaptation\n to new conditions. Growth implies changes,\n political, economic and social. Growth which is\n significant manifests itself rather in\n intellectual and moral conceptions of material\n things\" (Brandeis Papers, Harvard Law School).\n Similarly, in a beautiful metaphor Mr. J.M. Beck\n said as follows:"

The word 'employment' being wider,\nthere is no dispute that it takes within its fold, the\naspect of promotions to posts above the stage of initial\nlevel of recruitment. \nArticle 16(1)\n provides to every\nemployee otherwise eligible for promotion or who comes\nwithin the zone of consideration, a fundamental right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion. Equal opportunity here means\nthe right to be \"considered\" for promotion. If a person\nsatisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not\nconsidered for promotion, then there will be a clear\ninfraction of his fundamental right to be \"considered\" for\npromotion, which is his personal right. \"Promotion\" based\non equal opportunity and 'seniority' attached to such\npromotion are facets of fundamental right under \nArticle\n16(1):\n Where promotional avenues are available, seniority\nbecomes closely interlinked with promotion provided such a\npromotion is made after complying with the principle of\nequal opportunity stated in \nArticle 16(1).\n For example, if\nthe promotion is by rule of `seniority-cum- suitability',\nthe eligible seniors at the basic level as per seniority\nfixed at that level and who are within the zone of\nconsideration must be first considered for promotion and be\npromoted if found suitable. In the promoted category they\nwould have to count their seniority from the date of such\npromotion because they get promotion through a process of\nequal opportunity. Similarly, if the promotion from the\nbasic level is by selection or merit or any rule involving\nconsideration of merit, the senior who is eligible at the\nbasic level has to be considered and if found meritorious in\ncomparison with others, he will have to be promoted first.\nIf he is not found so meritorious, the next in order of\nseniority is to be considered and if found eligible and more\nmeritorious than the first person in the seniority list, he\nshould be promoted. In either case, the person who is first\npromoted will normally count his seniority from the date of\nsuch promotion. \n(There are minor modifications in various\nservices in the matter of counting of seniority of such\npromotees but in all cases the senior most person at the\nbasic level is to be considered first and then the others in\nthe line of seniority). That is how right to be considered\nfor promotion and the `seniority' attached to such promotion\nbecome important facets of the fundamental right guaranteed\nin \nArticle 16(1).\n Right to be considered for promotion is\nnot a mere statutory right: The question is as to whether\nthe right to be considered for promotion is a mere statutory\nright or a fundamental right. Learned senior counsel for\nthe general candidates submitted that in \nAshok Kumar Gupta\nVs.

(ii)\nReservation and effect of the Roster Point reservation: It\nmust be noted that whenever a reserved candidate goes for\nrecruitment at the initial level (say Level 1), he is not\ngoing through the normal process of selection which is\napplied to a general candidate but gets appointment to a\npost reserved for his group. That is what is meant by\n`reservation'. That is the effect of `reservation'. Now in\na case where the reserved candidate has not opted to contest\non his merit but has opted for the reserved post, if a\nroster is set at Level 1 for promotion of the reserved\ncandidate at various roster points to level 2, the reserved\ncandidate if he is otherwise at the end of the merit list,\ngoes to Level 2 without competing with general candidates\nand he goes up by a large number of places. In a roster\nwith 100 places, if the roster points are 8, 16, 24 etc. \nat\neach of these points the reserved candidate if he is at the\nend of the merit list, gets promotion to Level 2 by\nside-stepping several general candidates.

It deserves to be\nnoticed that the roster points fixed at Level 1 are not\nintended to determine any seniority at Level 1 between\ngeneral candidates and the reserved candidates. This aspect\nwe shall consider again when we come to \nMervyn Continho vs.\nCollector of Customs\n [1966 (3) SCR 600] lower down. The\nroster point merely becomes operative whenever a vacancy\nreserved at Level 2 becomes available.

Hira was further promoted as Superintendent\non 27.5.88. Similarly, Ram Dayal, another general candidate\ngot promoted as Deputy Superintendent\n_____________________________________________________________\n* In Jagdishlal, the hierarchy of posts is Clerk, Assistant,\nDeputy Superintendent, Superintendent, etc.\n____________________________________________________________\non 16.1.89 before the reserved candidates Sant Lal and Ajmer\nSingh got promoted as Superintendent on 8.2.90 and 1.7.90.\nIn that view of the matter, it becomes necessary to go into\nthe correctness of Jagdish Lal on merits. As we would\npresently show, in Jagdishlal, the seniority rule which\nreferred to continuous officiation and which applied to\npromotions made after providing equal opportunity as per\nrules - was delinked from the promotion rule and applied to\nroster promotees, which, in our view, was the main reason\nfor arriving at a different result. Jagdish Lal arose from\nHaryana. The Haryana Education Directorate (State Service\nClass III) Rule 1974 provided for recruitment to the posts\nof clerk (Level 1), Assistant (Level 2) and Deputy\nSuperintendent(Level 3). Rule 9(3) stated that all\npromotions would have to be made by selection based on merit\nand taking into consideration seniority but seniority alone\nwould not give any right to such promotions. Rule 11\nprovided that seniority would be counted from the date of\n\"continuous officiation\". The Court held in Jagdishlal that\nthe roster promotees who were promoted to Level 3 could\ncount their seniority from the date of continuous\nofficiation in that level in view of Rule 11. From Level 1\nto Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3, the rosters\noperated. From the level beyond Level 3, the posts were\nSuperintendent, Budget Officer, Assistant Registrar and\nRegistrar and were governed by the Haryana Education\nDepartment (State Service, Group B) Rule, 1980, and there\nwas no reservation. In those Rules also, Rule 9(3) stated\nthat all promotions would have to be made by selection based\non merit and taking into consideration seniority but\nseniority alone was not to give any right to such promotion.\nRule 11 of the 1980 Rules also stated that seniority would\ncount from the dates of continuous officiation. Thus, in\nthe Class III as well as Class II(Group B) Services, the\n\"continuous officiation\" rule was interlinked with the\npromotion rule based on equal opportunity, as in Ajit Singh,\nand formed a single scheme. The Court in Jagdish Lal\ndelinked Rule 11 from the recruitment rules and applied the\nsame to the roster promotees. For the reasons given already\nin regard to Ajit Singh, we hold that Jagdishlal arrived at\nan incorrect conclusion because of applying a rule of\ncontinuous officiation which was not intended to apply to\nthe reserved candidates promoted at roster points."

The former ( i.e.\nGuard posts) were posts governed by the rule of\nseniority-cum-suitability. In other words, for Guards,\nseniority would govern subject to omission of those found\nunsuitable for promotion. On the other hand, Station\nMasters' posts were governed by selection at every level of\npromotion. The learned Judge, Justice Jeevan Reddy, while\ndealing initially with the promotions of Guards ( See P.702\nof SCC) from C Grade to B, from B to A, and from A to\nSpecial Grade A pointed out that the seniority- cum-fitness\nrule applicable in their cases resulted in the seniority at\nthe Level of Guard C in the initial panel being reflected\nfrom stage to stage, subject to fitness. When the learned\nJudge came to discuss the issues relating to Station\nMasters,(See SCC P.711) where merit and selection were\ninvolved, the learned Judge stated that separate panels were\nto be prepared at every level and also that those in an\nearlier panel would be senior to those in a latter panel.\nIn either situation, it was laid down that the reserved\ncandidates could not count their 'seniority' on the basis of\nroster point promotion.

In that case, the Court had no occasion\nto consider any circular prescribing seniority to the roster\npromotees. That case is therefore not in point.\nKaramchand, decided by a two Judge Bench was, no doubt,\nconcerned with the question of seniority of the roster point\npromotee. The appellant, who was from the reserved\ncategory, belonged to the Haryana State Electricity Board\nand the Haryana Government's circular dated 27.4.72 pointed\nout that the roster was meant only for reservation and not\nfor fixing inter-se-seniority and that seniority depended\nupon the merit list prepared by the Public Service\nCommission or Selection Board. But the appellant, the\nreserved candidate relied upon Rule 9 of the Punjab\nPWD(Electricity Branch) Service Class III(Subordinate Posts)\nrules, 1952 where Rule 9 provided seniority to be determined\nfrom the date of \"regular\" promotion. The limited dispute\nwas whether his case fell within the \"Exception\" in Rule 9\nwhich related to \"temporary\" promotees who would not get\nseniority upon such temporary promotion. The contention of\nthe Board that he was a temporary promotee was not accepted\nby this Court on the facts of the case. No question\nvis-a-vis a general candidate arose. There are indeed\ncertain observations that seniority of the reserved\ncandidate had to be counted from the date of regular\npromotion which, in our opinion, are not correct. No\nquestion of \nArticle 16(1)\n or seniority as against a general\ncandidate arose. That case is distinguishable. In Kailash\nChand Joshi the appellant, who was senior, belonged to the\nnon- reserved category in the cadre of Munsifs. The\nrespondents 3 to 11 though junior in that cadre to the\nappellant, were promoted as Civil Judges earlier on the\nbasis of roster. The general candidate (appellant ) got\npromoted as Civil Judge later and claimed seniority in the\ncadre of Civil Judge. By that date the roster promotee did\nnot get any further promotion. This was not accepted by\nthis Court in view of Rule 11. There are two aspects of\nthis decision. Firstly, the Court did not notice that once\nthe general candidate, the appellant, who was senior to the\nrespondents reached the level of Civil Judge, the position\nwould be different. Such a principle, in fact, came to be\nlaid down shortly thereafter in Virpal by the same learned\nJudge who decided Kailash Chand Joshi. Secondly, it was not\nnoticed that Rule 22 relating to seniority from the date of\ncontinuous officiation was closely interlinked with the\npromotional Rule based on equal opportunity. We may state\nthat any observations in the above cases that the roster\npromotees will get seniority over the senior general\ncandidates who reach that level later, (but before the\nfurther promotion of the reserved candidate) cannot be\naccepted as correct in view of the legal position stated\nearlier. A 'poignant scenario' in some cases: We next come\nto the poignant scenario in several of the matters before\nus. Virpal referred to such a scenario where all the 33\ncandidates who were to be considered for 11 vacancies were\nfrom the SC/ST category ( see P.710 of SCC). Before us,\nsimilar facts are placed by the general candidates. The\nfactual position is not disputed, though certain reasons\nhave been set out by both sides which none has\nscientifically examined. It is to be noticed that : (i) in\nAjit Singh itself, - (see p.76 and PP.200-215, 232 of paper\nbook) as on 30.9.94 out of 107 officers working as\nSuperintendent Grade I, the first 23 officers are from\nScheduled Castes. At the level of Under Secretaries, out of\n19, the first 11 are from SC category. In the category of\nDy. Secretary, out of four, 2 are from SC category. As on\n30.9.94, the position was that at these levels, the\npercentage was 22.5%, 54% and 67% respectively in the above\ncategories. If the seniority is to be counted as per the\ncase of the reserved candidates, the position would be that\nDy. Secretaries would be 100% manned by Scheduled Castes,\nand Under Secretaries would again be 100% manned by\nScheduled Castes while Superintendents Grade I would be so\nmanned to the extent of 53%."

      "text": "We may, however, make it clear that our decision\nin regard to the \nArticle 16(1)\n, \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle\n16(4A)\n that the rule of \"continuous officiation\" is\napplicable only to promotions made as per rules which give\nequal opportunity - and not otherwise, -is independently\narrived at on the basis of the constitutional position and\nis in no way coloured or influenced by the above facts\nmentioned by the general candidates. Our Conclusions on\nPoints 1 and 2: We, therefore, hold that the roster point\npromotees (reserved category) cannot count their seniority\nin the promoted category from the date of their continuous\nofficiation in the promoted post, - vis- a-vis the general\ncandidates who were senior to them in the lower category and\nwho were later promoted. On the other hand, the senior\ngeneral candidate at the lower level, if he reaches the\npromotional level later but before the further promotion of\nthe reserved candidate-he will have to be treated as senior,\nat the promotional level, to the reserved candidate even if\nthe reserved candidate was earlier promoted to that level.\nWe shall explain this further under Point 3. We also hold\nthat Virpal and Ajit Singh have been correctly decided and\nthat Jagdishlal is not correctly decided. Point 1 and 2 are\ndecided accordingly. Point 3: During the discussion under\nthis \"catch-up\" point - for purposes of convenience, - we\ntake the example of the cadres in Ajit Singh i.e. there is\nroster point promotion for reserved candidates for promotion\nfrom Level 1 to Level 2 and from Level 2 to Level 3. There\nis no roster for promotion from Level 3 to Level 4. Two\n'catch up' rules contended for by general candidates: Now,\nas stated earlier, the counsel for the general candidates\nargued for acceptance of two catch-up rules. .pa Extreme\n'catch-up' rule: So far as the extreme contention of the\ngeneral candidates that at Level 3, the roster candidate\nmust wait at Level 3 - before being promoted to Level 4 -\ntill the last senior general candidate at Level 1 reached\nLevel 3, - we reject the same in as much as that will not\namount to a reasonable balancing of the rights of the\ncandidates in the two groups. Nor do we accept that posts\nmust be kept vacant and no promotions of the roster\ncandidates be made. Other Catch-up rule: As accepted in\nVirpal ( see 1995(6) SCC 684 at 702) and Ajit Singh (see\n1996(2) SCC at P.729), we hold that in case any senior\ngeneral candidate at Level 2 (Assistant) reaches Level 3 (\nSuperintendent Grade II) before the reserved candidate\n(roster point promotee) at Level 3 goes further up to Level\n4 \nin that case\n the seniority at Level 3 has to be modified\nby placing such a general candidate above the roster\npromotee, reflecting their inter se seniority at Level 2.\nFurther promotion to Level 4 must be on the basis of such a\nmodified seniority at Level 3, namely, that the senior\ngeneral candidate of Level 2 will remain senior also at\nLevel 3 to the reserved candidate, even if the latter had\nreached Level 3 earlier and remained there when the senior\ngeneral candidate reached that Level 3. In cases where the\nreserved candidate has gone upto Level 4 ignoring the\nseniority of the senior general candidate at Level 3,\nseniority at Level 4 has to be refixed (when the senior\ngeneral candidate is promoted to Level 4) on the basis of\nwhen the time of reserved candidate for promotion to Level 4\nwould have come, if the case of the senior general\ncandidates was considered at Level 3 in due time. To the\nabove extent, we accept the first part of the contention of\nthe learned counsel for the general candidates. Such a\nprocedure in our view will properly balance the rights of\nthe reserved candidates and the fundamental rights\nguaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n to the general candidates."

      "text": "No difficulty in amending seniority list: One of the\nobjections raised before us and which appealed to the Full\nBench in \nJaswant Singh\n's case was that this 'catch up'\nprinciple would lead to frequent alteration of the seniority\nlist at Level 3. We do not find any difficulty in this\nbehalf. The seniority list at Level 3 would have only to be\nmerely amended whenever the senior general candidate reaches\nLevel 3. Examples given by reserved candidates -do not\ncreate any anomaly: Learned senior counsel Sri K.\nParasaran and Sri Raju Ramachandran then adverted to a\nsituation which according to them might create serious\nproblems if a senior general candidate is to be treated as\nsenior at the promotional level if he reaches that level\nbefore the roster promotee goes further up. The example\ngiven refer to cases where after the roster point promotee\n(reserved candidate) reaches the promotional level, there is\ndirect recruitment or recruitment by transfer at that\npromotional level. Counsel submit that, if a senior general\ncandidate is thereafter promoted and placed above the\nreserved candidate, can he became senior to the direct\nrecruit and transferee? We do not find any anomaly. The\ndirect recruit or transferee who has no grievance against\nthe reserved candidate who was already there can have no\ngrievance against a senior general candidate who has a\nsuperior claim, in law, against the reserved candidate.\nEven if seniority of roster point promotee does not Count,\nexperience of both groups can be considered as part of merit\nfor further promotion: Before we leave point 3, we may\nrefer to another submission made by Sri K. Parasaran,\nlearned senior counsel for the reserved candidates. Learned\ncounsel submitted that even if the seniority of the reserved\ncandidates had gone up to Level 3 earlier by the roster at\ntwo levels 1 & 2 is not counted, still the 'experience'\ngained by them at Level 3 well before the senior general\ncandidate 'caught up' to that Level, cannot be disregarded\nfor purposes of promotion to Level 4. It is true that the\nroster point promotee who has reached the promotional level\n3 even if he is not entitled to seniority would have gained\nconsiderable `experience' at that level. That experience\nis, no doubt, of considerable relevance in considering his\ncase for further promotion to Level 4. But, at the same\ntime, it is to be noted that the general candidates had\nlonger experience at level 1 and level 2 and have come up to\nlevel 3 by way of competition among the general candidates\nat two stages. The said longer `experience' gained by them\nat the lower levels 1 and 2 and the manner in which they\nhave reached the level 3 to which the reserved candidate had\nreached earlier, are also relevant factors. The quality of\nthe experience of these groups also needs to be kept in\nview. The above principle would be an equitable balancing\nof the `experience' of the candidates at various levels. It\nwill be appropriate for the Government of India or the State\nGovernment, as the case may be, to formulate guidelines by\nway of administrative orders or by way of rules in this\nbehalf. Point 3 is disposed of accordingly. Point 4: This\npoint concerns the \"prospective\" operation of the two\njudgments in Sabharwal and Ajit Singh. The point regarding\nthese two cases directly arises in the appeals from Punjab,\nHaryana and Rajasthan. The prospectivity of Virpal has been\nparticularly raised by learned Additional Solicitor General,\nSri C.S. Vaidyanathan, in the IAs filed by the Railways.\nOnce again our approach here is to prevent reversions and\navoid hardship to the reserved candidates already promoted\nbefore the two judgments and at the same time to try to\nbalance the rights to seniority of the general candidates as\nagainst those of the reserved candidates, in the light of"

It\nwas not realised that once the roster points were all\nfilled, the roster had served its purpose and fresh members\nof the reserved classes could claim promotional posts only\nif any promotional posts already filled by the reserved\ncandidates fell vacant. This misapplication of the roster\ncame to be removed for the first time on 10.2.95 when\nSabharwal was decided. Obviously, by that time several\nreserved candidates had got promotion in excess of their\nquota because of the wrong \"re- operation\" of the roster\npoints. If the law declared in Sabbarwal were to be treated\nas retroactive as is the normal position whenever the law is\ndeclared by this Court, it would have resulted in reversions\nof several officers of the reserved classes as their\npromotions before 10.2.95 by the fresh operation of the\nroster as aforesaid was wholly unjustified.
