Against their acquittal, no appeal by the State.\n\n Crl.Revision No.404 of 1998 was instituted by Shiv Kumar\n\nagainst the acquittal of Rajesh, Sangita and Sobha and awarding of less\n\nsentence to Hukam Chand, Dinesh Kumar and Sudershna.\n\n Prosecution story, in brief, is that Shiv Kumar, complainant, is\n\nthe resident of Bhiwani and has 5 sisters. Suman was the youngest and was\n\n28 years' old. She was MA, M.Phil., M.Ed and was married with Dr. Dinesh\n\nKumar resident of Kaithal. At the time of marriage, sufficient dowry was\n\ngiven as per their status. Before marriage, i,e., next day of holi festival,\n\ncomplainant along with Subhash Chand Jain had gone to Kaithal. Raj\n\nKumar Bindlish, Advocate, Kaithal, was requested to accompany them.\n\nThen they had gone to the house of Hukam Chand. Rs.4,10,000/- in cash\n\nwas paid to Hukam Chand for purchase of dowry articles in the presence of\n\nhis family members. Raj Kumar Bindlish was the mediator and at the time\n\nof engagement, Rs.10,000/- in cash and other articles were given. At the\n\ntime of marriage, jewellery and clothes were given. At the time of departure\n\nof baraat, Rs.11,000/- was given in cash to Hukam Chand, Dinesh Kumar,\n\nRajesh, Sangita and Sobha. After marriage for the first time when Suman\n\ncame to Bhiwani, then she was tense and unhappy. On enquiry, she did not\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 3\n\ndisclose anything. Second time when she came to Bhiwani, then told that\n\nher mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law, brother-in-law and husband\n\nmisbehaved with her for want of dowry. Suman further stated that Hukam\n\nChand and Dinesh Kumar were pressurizing her to bring entire amount\n\nlying deposited in the shape of FDRs, share certificates and in her saving\n\nbank account. But she replied to her in-laws that amount was given to her\n\nby her late father. Even her brother did not withdraw a single penny from\n\nher FDRs, share certificates and bank account at the time of her marriage\n\nand showed her inability to bring payment. But Hukam Chand and Dinesh\n\nKumar had pressurized her to bring payment for opening Nursing Home.\n\nThen complainant had paid Rs.60,000/- to avoid harassment of Suman.\n\nDespite receipt of Rs.60,000/-, behaviour of in-laws of Suman did not\n\nchange. On 31.7.1994, Suman came to Bhiwani and told that Dinesh Kumar\n\nand his family members were pressurizing to bring Rs.1,00,000/- lying\n\ndeposited in the shape of FDRs, share certificates and saving bank account,\n\nfailing which, she was to face the consequences. On 10.8.1994, Dinesh\n\nKumar was to visit Bhiwani to take back Suman but he did not turn up. On\n\n11.8.1994 on telephone, Dinesh Kumar told that he was unable to visit\n\nBhiwani and requested complainant party to leave Suman at Kaithal. As per\n\nrequest of Dinesh Kumar, Suman was sent to Kaithal along with Sunder Lal,\n\nbrother of complainant, and his son Rajinder. Sunder Lal came back on the\n\nsame day to Bhiwani and told that behaviour of in-laws of Suman was not\n\ngood. Rajinder was requested to stay at Kaithal because in-laws of Suman\n\nwanted a talk between Rajinder and Dinesh Kumar. Next day, Rajinder\n\ncame back to Bhiwani and informed the complainant party that Suman was\n\nthreatened in his presence by Dinesh Kumar and his family members as to\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 4\n\nwhy she kept jewellery in the lock and key and why she failed to bring\n\npayment lying deposited in her name. Then Suman started weeping.\n\nRajinder also told the complainant that Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar\n\ndirected him to send the payment as demanded by them, which was lying\n\ndeposited in the name of Suman. Complainant had a talk with Hukam\n\nChand that already he (complainant) had given sufficient amount and now\n\nnot proper for them to harass Suman. On 26.8.1994 in the morning at 6.30\n\nAM, complainant received telephonic message from Hukam Chand that\n\nSuman was electrocuted while ironing the clothes with electric press and\n\nrequested him to visit Kaithal. Complainant enquired from Hukam Chand\n\nabout the condition of Suman but he requested to come soon and telephone\n\nwas disconnected. After that, complainant on telephone requested Raj\n\nKumar Bindlish to report about the real facts after enquiry. Complainant\n\nagain tried to contact Raj Kumar Bindlish but he was not at his house. His\n\nwife replied that Raj Kumar Bindlish had gone to the house of Hukam\n\nChand from where Raj Kumar Bindlish reported to the complainant that\n\nSuman had died due to electrocution while ironing the clothes.

Marriage was solemnized on 21.4.1994.\n\nMarriage was simple. Suman was MA/M.Phil./M.Ed and was happily\n\nenjoying married life. Appellant party was financially sound than the\n\ncomplainant party. Unnatural death at the in-laws house on 26.8.1994.\n\nDinesh Kumar was Dental Surgeon and to attend his duty, woke up in the\n\nmorning at 6.30 AM. Suman also woke up at 6.30 AM and after answering\n\ncall of nature, started preparing breakfast for Dinesh Kumar on the stove.\n\nWhile preparing breakfast on the stove, then she caught fire accidentally.\n\nDinesh Kumar came out of bathroom after taking bath, then raised an alarm.\n\nHukam Chand, father, and Sudershna, mother of Dinesh Kumar were\n\nsleeping on the roof of the house and on hearing raula, they came to the\n\nground floor. Sudershna while coming down from the roof, then fell down\n\nand became unconscious. Dinesh Kumar and Hukam Chand made an effort\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 14\n\nto extinguish the fire. Hukam Chand also received burn injuries.\n\nImmediately after the occurrence, intimation was sent to Raj Kumar\n\nBindlish, Advocate, and Shiv Kumar, complainant. Raj Kumar Bindlish,\n\nAdvocate, who was the mediator, came and directed the appellants not to\n\nshift Suman anywhere. At 9.30 AM, Inspector Kundal Lal came.\n\nAppellants were arrested at 9.30 AM. Rajesh, brother of Dinesh Kumar,\n\nwas arrested at 3.00 PM. Appellants were kept confined illegally for about\n\n7-8 days and were paraded in the streets by shaving their heads and\n\nblackening their faces. According to the story, if Suman was set on fire,\n\nthen Raj Kumar Bindlish should have reported the matter to the police.\n\nThere was no idea to wait. House of Raj Kumar Bindlish was at a distance\n\nof 2.00 km from the house of the appellants. Police was in the house of the\n\nappellants at 8.30 AM, whereas statement of the complainant was recorded\n\nat 12.30 noon. Complainant was politically sound. Before recording FIR,\n\nDDR No.8 was recorded but at that time, no detail to the police. PW 12\n\nDr. Kulwinder Singh stated that at about 11.00 AM, message was received\n\nregarding the present occurrence, whereas statement of the complainant was\n\nrecorded at 12.30 noon. Before recording the FIR, question is how Dr.\n\nKulwinder Singh came to know about the incident at 11.00 AM. Dr.\n\nKulwinder Singh stated that dead body was lying in the verandah. Two\n\npartially burnt pillows were found in the bed room. Double bed was also\n\nfound partially burnt. Evidence shows that one washed towel and bed sheet\n\nwere recovered from the roof. Immediately after the occurrence, Raj\n\nKumar Bindlish came to the house of the appellants. So, there was no time\n\nto wash the towel and bed sheet and keep the same on the roof. According\n\nto the story, can of kerosene was recovered from the spot but Dr. S.K.Jain\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 15\n\ndid not state a word regarding smell of kerosene. Dr. S.K.Jain stated that\n\ndead body was brought to General Hospital, Kaithal, on 26.8.1994. Board\n\nwas constituted but the Board was not in a position to opine as to what was\n\nthe cause of death. Then dead body was referred to PGIMS, Rohtak. In\n\nfact, doctors were under the pressure of Shiv Kumar, complainant, who was\n\npolitically sound. When dead body was brought to the hospital with burn\n\ninjuries, then it is very easy to conduct postmortem examination. There was\n\nno idea to send dead body to PGIMS, Rohtak. Dr. D.R.Yadav had\n\nconducted the postmortem examination. Then for the first time stated that\n\nsmell of kerosene was noticed. 80% burn injuries were noticed. Kerosene\n\nwas noticed only in case of scalp hair. In fact, on the day of occurrence, gas\n\ncylinder was out of order. Gas cylinder was brought by the employee of\n\nagency but taken back after seeing the occurrence. In the absence of gas\n\ncylinder, deceased was preparing breakfast on the stove. Suman caught fire\n\naccidentally in the kitchen and when Dinesh Kumar came to know about the\n\nincident, then he had gone to bed room to bring clothes etc. to extinguish\n\nthe fire. In the meantime, Suman had gone to the bed room. Some of the\n\narticles lying in the bed room came into contact of the deceased and were\n\npartially burnt. From the bed room, Suman came in the verandah. In the\n\nverandah, she had a fall. Smoke was in the bed room, kitchen and verandah,\n\nbut no photograph of the kitchen or bed room. Hukam Chand was a\n\npracticing lawyer at Kaithal. Dinesh Kumar was serving as a doctor. When\n\nthey were financially sound and marriage was simple, then there was no\n\nidea to demand cash to open clinic. If cash is demanded to open clinic, then\n\ndemand does not fall within the definition of dowry. Rs.1,00,000/- is not\n\nsufficient to open Nursing Home. Appellants are liable for punishment\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 16\n\nunder \nSection 304-B\n IPC if unnatural death at the in-laws house within 7\n\nyears from the date of marriage. Secondly, deceased was subjected to\n\ncruelty or harassment on account of demand of dowry soon before death,\n\nbut in the present case, unnatural death at the in-laws house due to\n\naccidental fire. Before present occurrence, no complaint to any authority\n\nregarding demand of dowry. If there was a demand of dowry, then entire\n\nstory should have been brought to the notice of the police when DDR No.8\n\nwas recorded. All the family members were got implicated. On the same set\n\nof evidence, three were acquitted by the trial Court. That means, allegation\n\nof the complainant party is not correct one. When accidental death at the\n\nhouse of in-laws, then tendency of the parents is to implicate all the\n\nmembers. On 11.8.1994, as per story, Suman was sent to her in-laws house\n\nwith Sunder Lal and Rajinder. Sunder Lal went back. Rajinder had stayed\n\nwith the deceased. In the presence of Rajinder, appellants threatened the\n\ndeceased as to why jewellery was kept in the locker and was not brought\n\nwith cash. Rajinder was not examined for the reasons best known to the\n\nprosecution. While staying in the in-laws house, deceased wrote number of\n\nletters. In the letters on file, not a word that appellants had ever misbehaved\n\nor maltreated the deceased for want of dowry. Deceased was well educated\n\nand was to get job in near future. After joining service, deceased was\n\nexpected to get salary. Salary was to be used by the appellants. When\n\ndeceased was well educated and was to get employment, then there was no\n\nidea to set the deceased on fire with this allegation that she failed to bring\n\ncash and jewellery. Argued that as per story, Hukam Chand and Dinesh\n\nKumar were pressurizing the deceased to bring cash lying deposited in the\n\nshape of FDRs, share certificates etc. to open Nursing Home but regarding\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 17\n\npayment of Rs.60,000/-, no proof on the file. No allegation that Sudershna\n\never demanded cash and jewellery or misbehaved or maltreated the\n\ndeceased for want of dowry. Sudershna was also named without any reason.\n\nShe was not keeping good health. Her eye sight was also weak. But\n\ngeneral allegation against all the family members that deceased was\n\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment for want of dowry.\n\n Learned State counsel argued that marriage of the deceased\n\nwith Dinesh Kumar was solemnized on 21.4.1994. Unnatural death at the\n\nin-laws house on 26.8.1994. Deceased was issueless. If the deceased had\n\nno problem and was residing peacefully at the in-laws house, then there was\n\nno idea to commit suicide by pouring kerosene as per report of the\n\nlaboratory. According to defence version, at 6.30 AM, deceased caught fire\n\naccidentally while preparing breakfast but on telephone, intimation was\n\ngiven to the complainant that unnatural death due to electrocution while\n\nironing the clothes. Distance of Bhiwani from Kaithal was about 130 kms.\n\nShiv Kumar on receipt of information had telephoned Raj Kumar Bindlesh\n\nto visit the house of the appellants and report whether news was correct one\n\nor not. Again, Shiv Kumar had telephoned at the residence of Raj Kumar\n\nBindlish but he was not present. Wife of Raj Kumar Bindlesh reported that\n\nhe had gone to the house of the appellants. Then complainant had\n\ntelephoned at the house of the appellants, then Raj Kumar Bindlesh on\n\ntelephone reported to the complainant to come soon. On receipt of message\n\nat about 6.30 AM, complainant party had gone to Kaithal. Intimation was\n\ngiven to the police about the incident. DDR was recorded and only after\n\nreaching the house of the appellants and seeing the dead body, statement of\n\nShiv Kumar was recorded. Hukam Chand was a practicing lawyer at\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 18\n\nKaithal. Dinesh Kumar was Dentist. Rajesh was serving as Taxation\n\nInspector. That means, appellants were financially sound. Then nothing to\n\npresume that there was only one gas cylinder in the house of the appellants\n\nand in the absence of gas cylinder, appellants were preparing breakfast etc.\n\non stove. When gas connection is released, then minimum two gas cylinders\n\nare supplied. No explanation where was the second gas cylinder. If the\n\ndeceased caught fire accidentally while preparing breakfast on stove, then\n\nappellants were expected to report to the complainant and Raj Kumar\n\nBindlesh that deceased caught fire accidentally while preparing breakfast.\n\nIn fact, message was sent to the complainant party that deceased caught fire\n\naccidentally while ironing the clothes. Raj Kumar Bindlesh, Advocate, is\n\nfrom Kaithal. He was not inimical towards the appellants. Immediately\n\nafter receipt of telephone from the complainant, Raj Kumar Bindlesh had\n\ngone to the house of the appellants. After that, on receipt of telephone from\n\nthe complainant, then Raj Kumar Bindlesh reported about the incident.\n\nUnnatural death within 4 months. Smell of kerosene was noticed by the\n\ndoctor. In fact, Hukam Chand was influential person. He had a say in the\n\npolice department. That is why, copies of case diary were found to be in\n\npossession of Hukam Chand and this fact is clear from the statement of\n\nInspector Kuldeep Singh when a note was given by the Court that copies of\n\ncase diary are with Hukam Chand. According to the defence version of\n\nDinesh Kumar, occurrence was at about 6.30 AM. He along with his father\n\nmade an effort to extinguish the fire but no burn injury was noticed on the\n\nperson of Dinesh Kumar. Defence version of Hukam Chand was that at\n\nabout 5.15/5.30 AM, he had heard cries, then came from the roof to the\n\nground floor. Then he along with Dinesh Kumar made an effort to\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 19\n\nextinguish the fire. Death was at 9.30 AM. If the deceased caught fire\n\naccidentally while preparing breakfast, then immediately after the\n\noccurrence, appellants should have shifted the deceased to the nearest\n\nhospital for medical aid. There was no idea to keep the burnt lady in the\n\nsame condition in the house till her death. Deceased had an account in the\n\nbank. Payment was lying deposited in the shape of FDRs. Deceased was\n\nnot in Government job. To open Nursing Home, appellants were harassing\n\nthe deceased to bring jewellery and cash. After marriage, when for the first\n\ntime, deceased had gone to her parental house, then on enquiry by the\n\nparents, deceased did not disclose anything but she was not happy. Second\n\ntime, deceased had disclosed about the demand of dowry by her father-in-\n\nlaw and husband. Rs.10,000/- was paid at the time of engagement and\n\nRs.4,10,000/- before marriage to purchase dowry articles to the appellants.\n\nAllegation of the appellants was that marriage was simple but dowry articles\n\nwere recovered in pursuance of disclosure statements suffered by the\n\nappellants. That means, prosecution story is correct one. Rs.60,000/- was\n\npaid by the complainant when there was demand of cash to open Nursing\n\nHome. When there is a demand by the in-laws, then to settle the girl at her\n\nin-laws house, no receipt is obtained. Report is also not lodged with the\n\npolice immediately after the marriage when there is a demand of dowry.\n\nPanchayat is convened and report is lodged with the police or panchayat\n\nwhen situation goes out of control of the complainant party. No doubt, Shiv\n\nKumar had contested election twice but he lost the election. If complainant\n\nhad a telephonic talk with the SP, then nothing to presume that he had a say\n\nin the police department. Before lodging the FIR, complainant did not\n\ncontact the SP or the higher authorities. Complainant can have a say in his\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 20\n\nown area but not in the area of the appellants. After the occurrence, dead\n\nbody was shifted to Civil Hospital, Kaithal, but dead body was referred to\n\nPGIMS, Rohtak, for postmortem examination. If the doctors had referred\n\nthe dead body to PGIMS, Rohtak, for postmortem examination, then doctors\n\ncannot be expected to be under the control of the complainant. If the doctors\n\nwere to oblige the complainant, then they could easily give report in favour\n\nof the complainant party after postmortem examination. There was no\n\nreason to refer the dead body to PGIMS, Rohtak. Dr. D.R.Yadav was Head\n\nof the Department. He is well qualified. Without enmity with the\n\nappellants, when Shiv Kumar had no say in the police department or health\n\ndepartment, then Head of the Department had no reason to annoy the\n\nappellants. When unnatural death at the in-laws house, then presumption\n\nunder \nSection 113-B\n of the Evidence Act is that death was dowry death. As\n\nper bail order dated 15.4.1995, bail application was personally argued by\n\nHukam Chand, appellant, and at that time, allegation of the appellants was\n\nthat Suman committed suicide but during trial, defence version of the\n\nappellants was that Suman caught fire accidentally while preparing\n\nbreakfast. If Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar had made an effort to\n\nextinguish the fire, then burn injuries should have been on their person but\n\nno medical evidence on the file that burn injuries were noticed on the person\n\nof Hukam Chand or Dinesh Kumar. As per defence version, appellants were\n\nkept confined illegally for about 7-8 days but no complaint to any authority.\n\nRelations of the appellants could easily approach the Hon'ble High Court\n\nfor appointment of Warrant Officer. When unnatural death at the in-laws\n\nhouse within few months after the marriage, then it is very easy to plead that\n\ndeceased caught fire accidentally while preparing food etc. Failure to shift\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 21\n\nthe deceased to the nearest hospital for medical aid till her death shows that,\n\nin fact, deceased was set on fire. Appellants were present in the house at the\n\ntime of occurrence. Trial Court has rightly opined that appellants had set\n\nthe deceased on fire.\n\n Suman (deceased) was married with Dinesh Kumar on\n\n21.4.1994. Unnatural death at the house of the appellants on 26.8.1994.\n\nAccording to prosecution story, deceased was set on fire for want of dowry.\n\nDefence version of the appellants was that deceased caught fire accidentally\n\nwhile preparing breakfast on the stove. Now the question is whether\n\ndeceased caught fire accidentally while preparing breakfast or she was set\n\non fire.\n\n To convict the appellants under \nSection 304-B\n IPC, prosecution\n\nwas required to prove that death of the deceased was caused by any burns\n\nor bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within\n\nseven years of her marriage; deceased was subjected to cruelty or\n\nharassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in\n\nconnection with, any demand for dowry, and cruelty or harassment was\n\nsoon before her death.\n\n Admittedly, Suman (deceased) MA/M.Phil/M.Ed., aged about\n\n28 years, was married with Dinesh Kumar. Marriage was solemnised on\n\n21.4.1994. No suggestion to any witness that marriage was not solemnised\n\non 21.4.1994. In view of the statements of Shiv Kumar, Sunder Lal and Raj\n\nKumar Bindlish, Advocate, death was within 7 years from the date of\n\nmarriage.\n\n According to the prosecution, on 26.8.1994 in the morning,\n\nSuman was set on fire. Defence version of the appellants was that Suman\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 22\n\ncaught fire accidentally while preparing breakfast on the stove in the\n\nkitchen. After the occurrence, dead body was sent to Civil Hospital, Kaithal.\n\nDr. S.K.Jain, Medical Officer, stated that on 26.8.1994, dead body was\n\nbrought to the hospital. Application (Ex.PX) was moved. Board was\n\nconstituted but dead body was referred to PGIMS, Rohtak, for postmortem\n\nexamination.\n\n Dr.D.R.Yadav (PW17) stated that on 27.8.1994, he was Head\n\nof Department. Postmortem examination was conducted on the dead body of\n\nSuman. 80% burn injuries were noticed. Burn injuries were ante mortem in\n\nnature. No external injury was noticed on the person of Suman. No case of\n\nthe prosecution or the appellants that deceased had committed suicide. No\n\nsuggestion to the doctors or the prosecution witnesses that death was\n\nnatural. That means, death was unnatural at the in-laws house. Only dispute\n\nis whether deceased was set on fire or she caught fire accidentally. So,\n\nsecond ingredient to convict the appellants under \nSection 304-B\n IPC is also\n\nclear.\n\n Third ingredient to convict the appellants under \nSection 304-B\n\nIPC was that the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment for want\n\nof dowry and such cruelty or harassment was soon before the death.\n\n Shiv Kumar, brother of the deceased, is the complainant and\n\nlodged report with the police that before marriage, i,e., next day of holi\n\nfestival, he along with Subhash Chand Jain and Raj Kumar Bindlish,\n\nAdvocate, Kaithal, had gone to the house of Hukam Chand. Rs.4,10,000/- in\n\ncash was paid to Hukam Chand for purchase of dowry articles in the\n\npresence of his family members. Rs.10,000/- in cash was paid at the time\n\nof engagement. At the time of marriage, gold, clothes etc. were given. At\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 23\n\nthe time of departure of barat, Rs.11,000/- in cash was paid to Hukam\n\nChand, Dinesh Kumar, Rajesh, Sangita and Sobha. After marriage for the\n\nfirst time when Suman came to Bhiwani, then she was tense and unhappy.\n\nOn enquiry, she did not disclose anything. Second time when she came to\n\nBhiwani, then told that her father-in-law Hukam Chand and husband Dinesh\n\nKumar were pressurizing her to bring the amount lying deposited in the\n\nshape of FDRs, share certificates and in her saving bank account.\n\nRs.60,000/- was paid to them to avoid harassment of Suman. On 31.7.1994,\n\nSuman came to Bhiwani and told that Dinesh Kumar and his family\n\nmembers were pressurizing to bring Rs.1,00,000/- lying deposited in the\n\nshape of FDRs, share certificates and saving bank account. On 10.8.1994,\n\nDinesh Kumar was to visit his in-laws house to take back Suman but he did\n\nnot turn up. On 11.8.1994 on telephone, Dinesh Kumar told that he was\n\nunable to visit Bhiwani and requested complainant party to leave Suman at\n\nKaithal. Then, Suman was sent to Kaithal along with Sunder Lal, brother of\n\ncomplainant, and his son Rajinder. Sunder Lal came back on the same day\n\nto Bhiwani In the presence of Rajinder, in-laws of Suman had threatened\n\nher as to why she kept jewellery in the lock and key and why she failed to\n\nbring payment lying deposited in her name. Hukam Chand and Dinesh\n\nKumar directed to send the payment. He further stated that in the morning\n\non 26.8.1994, telephonic message was received at about 6.30 AM from\n\nHukam Chand that Suman was electrocuted while ironing clothes. He was\n\nrequested to visit Kaithal immediately. Then he had requested Raj Kumar\n\nBindlish, Advocate, on telephone to enquire about the incident. Again, he\n\nhad telephoned to Raj Kumar Bindlish but he was not present at his house.\n\nTelephone was attended by his wife. After that, he had telephoned at the\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 24\n\nhouse of Hukam Chand. Telephone was attended by Raj Kumar Bindlish\n\nand told that Suman had died while ironing clothes. He was requested to\n\nvisit Kaithal immediately. Statement of Shiv Kumar, complainant, was\n\nrecorded on 26.8.1994. In view of statement of Shiv Kumar, formal FIR was\n\nrecorded. Special report was delivered to the Ilaqa Magistrate at 3.50 PM\n\non the same day.\n\n Shiv Kumar appeared as PW7 and stated that appellants used to\n\nmisbehave and maltreat Suman for want of dowry. Similar is the statement\n\nof Sunder Lal, brother of Shiv Kumar.\n\n PW14 Raj Kumar Bindlish, Advocate, was the mediator. He\n\nhas also supported the version of Shiv Kumar by saying that before\n\nmarriage, he along with Shiv Kumar and Subhash Chand Jain had gone to\n\nthe house of Hukam Chand. Rs.4,10,000/- in cash was paid to Hukam\n\nChand for purchase of dowry articles. Rs.10,000/- in cash was paid at the\n\ntime of engagement. Sufficient dowry was given. Rs.11,000/- in cash was\n\npaid at the time of marriage. On the day of occurrence, telephone was\n\nreceived from the complainant to enquire about the incident from the house\n\nof Hukam Chand. After that, he had gone to the house of Hukam Chand.\n\nAgain telephone was received from the complainant. Dead body of Suman\n\nwas found lying in the house of Hukam Chand.\n\n Learned defence counsel for the appellants argued that\n\noccurrence was in the morning on 26.8.1994. On telephone, intimation was\n\nnot given to the complainant party that Suman was electrocuted while\n\nironing clothes. In fact, information was given to the complainant that\n\nSuman caught fire accidentally. If Suman was set on fire by the appellants,\n\nthen there was no idea to inform the complainant party that Suman was\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 25\n\nelectrocuted while ironing clothes. House of Raj Kumar Bindlish,\n\nAdvocate, was at a distance of about 2 kms. At about 8.30 AM, police was\n\nin the house but at 12.30 noon, story was concocted that Suman was set on\n\nfire. Initially, DDR was recorded, but while recording DDR, detail was not\n\ngiven. After going through the evidence on the file, submission of learned\n\ndefence counsel seems to be not correct one. According to defence version\n\nof Dinesh Kumar, Suman got up at about 6.30 AM. After answering the call\n\nof nature, she was preparing breakfast for him on the stove. At that time,\n\nhis father and mother were sleeping on the roof of the house. He had gone\n\nto bathroom and came out after about 30-35 minutes after taking bath. Then\n\nnoticed Suman while on fire in the kitchen. He had made an effort to\n\nextinguish the fire. Raula was raised and on hearing raula, Hukam Chand\n\ncame to the ground floor. From the kitchen, Suman came inside the bed\n\nroom and came in contact with some articles lying in the bed room. From\n\nbed room, Suman came to the verandah. Intimation was given to Raj\n\nKumar Bindlish and the complainant. Raj Kumar Bindlish came and\n\ndirected them not to shift Suman anywhere. Defence version of Hukam\n\nChand was that at about 5.15-5.30 AM, he heard raula, then came to the\n\nground floor. He along with Dinesh Kumar tried to extinguish the fire.\n\nDeath was at 9.30 AM. In case, Suman caught fire accidentally while\n\npreparing breakfast at about 6.30 AM or 5.15-5.30 AM, then Dinesh Kumar\n\nor Hukam Chand should have made an effort to shift Suman to the nearest\n\nhospital for medical aid. Till death at aboout 9.30 AM, no effort was made\n\nto shift Suman to the nearest hospital. If Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar\n\nhad made an effort to extinguish the fire, then some burn injuries should\n\nhave been on their person, but no medical evidence on the file that burn\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 26\n\ninjuries were noticed on the person of Hukam Chand or Dinesh Kumar.No\n\nsuggestion to complainant that Dinesh Kumar tried to extinguish fire.\n\n As per defence version, Suman was preparing breakfast on the\n\nstove because there was no gas cylinder in the house. Employee of gas\n\nagency came to the house of the appellants with cylinder but he went back.\n\nSo, this was the reason why Suman was preparing breakfast on the stove\n\nbut explanation of the appellants seems to be not correct one. Hukam\n\nChand was a practicing lawyer, Dinesh Kumar was Dentist and brother of\n\nDinesh Kumar, namely, Rajesh was serving as Inspector in Income Tax\n\nDepartment. When gas connection is issued, then two cylinders are issued\n\nby the gas agency. Appellant party was financially sound. Then nothing to\n\npresume that there was no other gas cylinder in the house. After inspection,\n\nhalf burnt towel and bed sheet were recovered from the roof. Bed sheet of\n\ndouble bed was also found burnt partially. Two partially burnt pillows were\n\nalso found in the bed room. If Suman caught fire accidentally, then no\n\nquestion of smell of kerosene on the scalp hair. If story regarding\n\naccidental fire was correct, then no question of recovery of partially burnt\n\ntowel and bed sheet from the roof. Photographs on the file also show that\n\nstory of accidental fire is not correct one.\n\n Bail application was moved by the appellants. Hukam Chand,\n\none of the appellants, had argued the bail application and at that time,\n\nallegation of the appellants was that it was a case of suicide by Suman but\n\nafter challan was presented and evidence was being recorded, then defence\n\nversion of the appellants was that Suman caught fire accidentally.\n\n Sangita and Shobha, who were acquitted by the trial Court are\n\nthe sisters of Dinesh Kumar but except the deceased, no one caught fire\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 27\n\naccidentally while cooking on the stove or gas cylinder.\n\n \nIn 2009(3) RCR (Crl.) 439, \nState of Haryana vs. Ram Phal and\n\nothers\n, defence version of the accused was that deceased received burn\n\ninjuries in accidental fire due to burst of stove but story of bursting of stove\n\nnot believed. Division Bench of this Hon'ble High Court opined that why\n\nmother-in-law and sister-in-law do not sustain burn injuries from accidental\n\nstove burns and why only the daughter-in-law caught fire accidentally due\n\nto burst of stove.\n\n First of all, defence version seems to be not correct one that\n\nthere was no gas cylinder on the day of occurrence. No explanation\n\nregarding second gas cylinder. IO admitted that on the day of occurrence,\n\none employee of gas agency with cylinder came but he went back after\n\nseeing the incident, but regarding second gas cylinder, no explanation.\n\nWhen one of the appellants was practicing lawyer and second was a doctor,\n\nthen there was a possibility of more than two cylinders in the house when\n\nfamily was not small. Two young unmarried girls were also in the same\n\nhouse, who were acquitted by the trial Court.\n\n Next submission of learned defence counsel for the appellants\n\nwas that appellant party was financially sound than the complainant party.\n\nShiv Kumar, complainant, was politically sound. Dead body was shifted to\n\nCivil Hospital, Kaithal, but doctors were not agreeing to give favourable\n\nreport to the complainant. Then doctors were pressurized to shift the dead\n\nbody to PGIMS, Rohtak. Being politically sound, favourable report was\n\nobtained from Dr. D.R.Yadav but submission of learned defence counsel for\n\nthe appellants is without any force. No doubt, Shiv Kumar had contested\n\nelection but he had no say in the area of Kaithal. Shiv Kumar is from\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 28\n\nDistrict Bhiwani and Bhiwani is at a distance of about 150 kms. from\n\nKaithal. Defeated candidate cannot be expected to have a say in all the\n\ndistricts, particularly when Hukam Chand was a practicing lawyer at Kaithal\n\nand one of his son was a doctor and second was Inspector in Income Tax\n\nDepartment. In fact, Hukam Chand seems to be influential person because\n\nat the time of recording of evidence, photocopies of case diary were found\n\nwith him. Photocopies of case diary are not supplied to the accused. Copies\n\nare not attached with the challan. Only the court has the power to see the\n\ncase diary. At the time of evidence or arguments, defence counsel has no\n\npower to inspect the case diary. If Hukam Chand can have photocopies of\n\ncase diary, then it means that he had a say in the police department. If Shiv\n\nKumar had a say in the police department, then police officials were not\n\nexpected to supply copies of case diary to the appellants. After the\n\noccurrence, dead body was shifted to Civil Hospital, Kaithal. Board was\n\nconstituted but Dr. S.K.Jain stated that they were not in a position to opine\n\nas to what was the cause of death. Suggestion was given to Dr. S.K.Jain\n\nthat they were under the pressure of complainant not to give opinion. Dead\n\nbody was sent to Civil Hospital, Kaithal. Doctors were not under the\n\ncontrol of Shiv Kumar. If the doctors were of the opinion that they were not\n\nin a position to opine as to what was the cause of death, then they had power\n\nto refer the dead body to PGIMS, Rohtak, for postmortem examination.\n\n Dr. D.R.Yadav was Head of Department. He is a well known\n\ndoctor. Nothing on the file that he was under the influence of complainant\n\nparty. 80% burn injuries were noticed. Injuries were ante mortem in nature.\n\nSmell of kerosene was noticed in case of scalp hair. So, if the postmortem\n\nwas by the Head of Department of PGIMS, Rohtak, then not correct to\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 29\n\nopine that postmortem report was procured by the complainant party.\n\n \nLearned defence counsel for the appellants further argued that\n\naccording to the story, payment was demanded to open Nursing Home but\n\nallegation is not correct one because Dinesh Kumar was serving as Doctor\n\nin a hospital. With Rs.1,00,000/- not possible to open Nursing Home. So,\n\nstory regarding demand of cash to open Nursing Home was coined. Demand\n\nof cash to open Nursing Home cannot be said to be dowry demand. In 2004\n\n(1) RCR (Crl.) 625, \nVirender Singh vs. State of Haryana, Some\n presents\n\ndemanded by husband at the time of marriage of sister of his wife- General\n\ndemands and demand of Rs.20,000/- for business- Then demand cannot said\n\nto be dowry demand. But after going through the evidence on the file, I am\n\nnot in a position to agree with the submission of learned defence counsel for\n\nthe appellants, because before marriage, Rs.4,10,000/- was paid to Hukam\n\nChand to purchase dowry articles. Some of the dowry articles were\n\nrecovered by the IO. Rs.10,000/- was paid at the time of engagement.\n\nRs.11,000/- was paid at the time of marriage. After marriage, deceased was\n\npressurized to bring cash lying deposited in the shape of FDRs/share\n\ncertificates etc.\n\n DW3 Zile Singh brought record and stated that FDRs were\n\nissued in the name of the deceased on different dates.\n\n DW4 Dinesh Rastogi brought record and stated that as per\n\nrecord, Account No. 29305 was opened in the name of Suman (deceased) on\n\n22.7.1988.\n\n DW6 Subhash Sharma stated that one agreement to sell was in\n\nfavour of the appellants. Pronotes and receipts (Ex.DV7 to Ex.DV10) were\n\nalso in favour of one of the appellants. No doubt, agreement to sell and\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 30\n\ndifferent pronotes are in favour of the appellants but documentary evidence\n\nalso shows that amount was lying deposited in the name of the deceased.\n\nBefore marriage, deceased had account in the bank. Allegation of the\n\nprosecution is that appellants were demanding payment to open Nursing\n\nHome. If demand had nexus with the marriage directly or indirectly, then\n\ndemand constitutes demand for dowry as held in 2011 STPL (Web) 113 SC,\n\nBachni Devi and another vs. State of Haryana. In this case, learned counsel\n\nfor the appellants had argued that a demand of money on account of some\n\nfinancial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for\n\npurchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said\n\nword is normally understood. Then Court observed that if demand for\n\nproperty or valuable security, directly or indirectly, has a nexus with\n\nmarriage, then such demand would constitute demand for dowry. Cause or\n\nreason for such demand is immaterial.\n\n As per defence version of the appellants, marriage was simple.\n\nDeceased was happily staying at her in-laws house. In case, marriage was\n\nsimple, then no question of recovery of dowry articles. Recovery of dowry\n\narticles during investigation shows that submission of learned defence\n\ncounsel for the appellants is not correct one. If the appellants were\n\nfinancially sound than the complainant party, even then no bar to demand\n\ndowry. All depends upon the character/greed of the husband or his parents.\n\nNumber of cases where financially sound persons were noticed while\n\ndemanding dowry and harassing daughters-in-law for want of dowry.\n\nPayment of more than Rs.4,00,000/- before marriage, Rs.10,000/- at the\n\ntime of engagement, Rs.11,000/- at the time of marriage and payment to\n\nopen Nursing Home after the marriage shows that deceased was harassed\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 31\n\nfor want of dowry soon before death. Death was within 4-5 months.\n\n \nIn 2009 (3) RCR (Crl.) 418, \nNepal Singh vs. State of Haryana\n,\n\ndeath was within 4 years of marriage by taking poison- Evidence of\n\nintervener who had got the marriage settled- Stated that at the time of\n\nsettlement of marriage and even thereafter, no demand of dowry was made-\n\nDemand of dowry not proved- Accused was acquitted but judgment of\n\nSessions Court was upset by the High Court on the allegation that\n\nsomething must have happened and otherwise deceased would not have\n\ncommitted suicide- Then Hon'ble Supreme Court held that this ground is\n\nindefensible and could not have been a reason to set aside the judgment of\n\nacquittal.\n\n In 2010 (4) RCR (Crl.) 53, Amar Singh vs. State of Rajasthan,\n\nAllegation of harassment and torture by making demand of dowry- No\n\nevidence as to what was the exact act or conduct of accused by which the\n\ndeceased felt tortured- Conviction was set aside.\n\n In 2007(2) RCR (Crl.) 395, Biswajit Halder @ Babu Halder vs.\n\nState of West Bengal, Bride committing suicide by taking poison at\n\nmatrimonial home- Allegations that accused were putting pressure on\n\ndeceased to bring more items of dowry- Practically no evidence to show that\n\nthere was any cruelty or harassment for or in connection with the demand of\n\ndowry- Conviction was set aside. But in the present case, before marriage,\n\ncash payment to Hukam Chand to purchase dowry articles. Dowry articles\n\nwere recovered from the house of the appellants. At the time of marriage,\n\nbesides payment of gold ornaments and clothes, there was cash payment of\n\nRs.11,000/-. After marriage, again payment of Rs.60,000/. Deceased had\n\nbank account and payment in the shape of FDRs and share certificates.\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 32\n\nDeceased was pressurized to bring cash payment. If deceased had no\n\nproblem and was residing happily in her in-laws house, then no reason to\n\ncomplain that she was harassed for want of dowry.\n\n Next submission of learned defence counsel for the appellants\n\nwas that occurrence was at about 5.30-6.30 AM on 26.8.1994. After Suman\n\nreceived injuries by accidental fire, then immediately intimation was sent to\n\nthe complainant. Complainant party came to Kaithal. DDR was got\n\nregistered. Police party also came to the place of occurrence at about 9.30\n\nAM. Dr. Kulwinder Singh came to know about the occurrence at 11.00\n\nAM. At the time of DDR, detail was not given by the complainant but later\n\non, story was concocted. Then FIR was got registered in view of statement\n\n(Ex.PG). No explanation why after DDR, again matter was reported to the\n\npolice. Delay in lodging the FIR shows that, in fact, deceased caught fire\n\naccidentally. When death was within 4-5 months from the date of marriage,\n\nthen complainant party thought proper to take revenge by implicating all\n\nfamily members of the husband. Two unmarried daughters and two sons,\n\nincluding husband of the deceased, were residing in the same house with\n\nHukam Chand and his wife. Allegations are the same against all family\n\nmembers but three were acquitted by the trial Court. No explanation\n\nregarding delay. When story as per statement (Ex.PG) is different than the\n\nstory as per DDR, then possibility of false implication cannot be ruled out.\n\n No doubt, as per defence version, occurrence was at about 5.30-\n\n6.30 AM in the house of the appellants. On telephone, message was sent to\n\nthe complainant party but residence of complainant was at a distance of\n\nabout 150 kms. from the place of occurrence. Minimum 2-3 hours are\n\nrequired to cover the distance. On receipt of information, firstly complainant\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 33\n\nrequested Raj Kumar Bindlish to visit the house of the appellants and report\n\nabout the incident. After information to the remaining family members,\n\nthen complainant along with other family members had gone to Kaithal.\n\nDDR was got recorded, then complainant along with other family members\n\nhad gone to the house of the appellants. After that, they came to know that\n\ndeceased was set on fire for want of dowry, then report was lodged. Special\n\nreport was delivered to Ilaqa Magistrate at 3.50 PM. At the time of DDR at\n\nabout 12.30 PM, complainant party was not sure as to what was the real\n\nstory because on telephone, intimation was given to the complainant party\n\nthat Suman received burn injuries while ironing the clothes.\n\n \nIn 2007(4) RCR (Crl.) 1042, \nParamjit Singh @ Mithu Singh vs.\n\nState of Punjab\n through Secretary (Home), Hon'ble Supreme Court in para\n\nNo.13 observed as under:-\n\n \"13. Chapter XII of the code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n deals with information to the police and their powers to\n\n investigate. Investigation into allegations relating to\n\n commission of a cognizable offence starts on information given\n\n to an Officer-in-charge of a Police Station and recorded under\n\n \nSection 154\n of the Code. If from information so received or\n\n otherwise, the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station, if\n\n satisfied that such information discloses the commission of a\n\n cognizable offence, shall either investigate the case himself or\n\n direct the investigation to any police officer subordinate to him,\n\n in the manner provided by the Code. The procedure as regards\n\n the registration of information relating to the commission of a\n\n cognizable offence and the procedure for investigation is\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 34\n\n structured and regulated by Chapter XII of the Code. The\n\n procedure prescribed is required to be followed scrupulously by\n\n the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station. The Punjab Police\n\n Rules do not in any manner override the provisions of the\n\n \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. The said rules are meant for the\n\n guidance of the Police Officers in the State and supplement the\n\n provisions of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n but not supplant\n\n them. In our considered opinion the truth and veracity of\n\n contents of the FIR cannot in all cases be tested with a\n\n reference to the entries made in the Police Station daily diary\n\n which is maintained under the Punjab Police Rules. This\n\n avoidable controversy need not detain us any further since it is\n\n well settled that even a defect, if any, found in investigation,\n\n however, serious has no direct bearing on the competence or\n\n the procedure relating to the cognizance or the trial. A defect\n\n or procedural irregularity, if any, in investigation itself cannot\n\n vitiate and nullify the trial based on such erroneous\n\n investigation.\"\n\n After the occurrence, any one can inform the police about the\n\noccurrence. FIR is not the encyclopedia of the occurrence. After the\n\noccurrence when complainant party was sure as to what was the cause of\n\ndeath, then matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered,\n\nthen story is not to be ignored on the ground that while getting the DDR\n\nrecorded, complete story was not brought to the notice of the police. When\n\nthere is a delay and delay is not explained, then delay itself is not sufficient\n\nfor acquittal of the accused. Delay is one of the suspicious circumstance to\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 35\n\nscrutinize evidence with great care and caution. As discussed earlier, two\n\nunmarried daughters of Hukam Chand were also staying in the same house.\n\nIf defence version is correct one that there was no gas cylinder on the\n\nrelevant date, then question is why only the deceased caught fire\n\naccidentally while preparing breakfast and why unmarried daughters or their\n\nmother did not receive injuries accidentally.\n\n Learned defence counsel for the appellants further argued that\n\ngeneral allegation against the entire family members that they used to\n\nmisbehave and maltreat the deceased for want of dowry and deceased was\n\nsubjected to cruelty and harassment on account of demand of dowry soon\n\nbefore death, but on the same evidence, three were acquitted by the trial\n\nCourt. No role of Sudershna, mother-in-law of the deceased. She was very\n\nold. Her eye sight was also damaged during operation. She was on the roof\n\nand had a fall while coming to the ground floor. Immediately after the\n\noccurrence, she was admitted in the hospital and this fact is clear from the\n\nstatements of DW1 Dr.Prithi Mehta and DW2 Gurmail Kaur, Nurse. As\n\nper statement (Ex.PG), only Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar used to\n\nmisbehave and maltreat the deceased for want of dowry but Sudershna was\n\nconvicted and sentenced on the allegation that she is the mother-in-law.\n\nAfter going through the evidence on the file, I am of the opinion that\n\nsubmission of learned defence counsel for the appellants seems to be\n\nreasonable.\n\n Admittedly, unnatural death at the in-laws house within 4-5\n\nmonths from the date of marriage. Ex.PG is the statement of Shiv Kumar,\n\non the basis of which, formal FIR was recorded, but no allegation that\n\nSudershna at any stage harassed the deceased for want of dowry. Allegation\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 36\n\nof Shiv Kumar was that before marriage, Rs.4,10,000/- was paid to Hukam\n\nChand to purchase dowry articles. Second allegation was that Rs.10,000/-\n\nwas paid at the time of engagement, but no allegation that payment was\n\nmade to Sudershna. Next allegation of the complainant was that\n\nRs.11,000/- in cash was given to Hukam Chand, Dinesh Kumar, Rajesh and\n\nSobha at the time of departure of barat. Not a word by the complainant that\n\ncash payment was also made to Sudershna. First time after marriage when\n\nSuman came to her parental house, then she did not disclose about the\n\ndemand of dowry or harassment. Second time when she came to her\n\nparental house, then had disclosed that her father-in-law and husband were\n\nharassing her for want of dowry and she was directed to bring cash lying\n\ndeposited in the shape of FDRs, share certificates etc. Payment was\n\ndemanded for opening of Nursing Home. Again not a word by the\n\ncomplainant that cash was demanded by Sudershna to open Nursing Home.\n\nAfter demand of cash, Rs.60,000/- was paid by the complainant but no\n\nallegation that payment was made to Sudershna. Third time when Suman\n\ncame, then again told to complainant that her in-laws were demanding\n\nRs.1,00,000/- lying deposited in the shape of FDRs, share certificates etc.\n\nAgain, no allegation by the deceased that cash was demanded by\n\nSudershna. On 10.8.1994, Dinesh Kumar was to visit his in-laws house to\n\nbring back Suman but he did not turn up. On the request of Dinesh Kumar,\n\nSuman was sent to her in-laws house with Sunder Lal and Rajinder.\n\nRajinder is the son of complainant but he was not examined to state as to\n\nwhether Sudershna had misbehaved or maltreated the deceased for want of\n\ndowry. Sunder Lal appeared as PW8 but did not state a word that in his\n\npresence, Suman was harassed for want of dowry by Sudershna or before\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 37\n\nthat, at any stage, Suman told him that Sudershna also misbehaved and\n\nmaltreated her for want of dowry. Rajinder rather told to the complainant\n\nthat Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar directed him to send payment. Then\n\nHukam Chand was requested not to harass Suman.\n\n Raj Kumar Bindlish was the mediator. He has supported the\n\nprosecution story but did not state a word that at any stage, Suman had\n\ncontacted him and disclosed that Sudershna used to misbehave and maltreat\n\nher for want of dowry. Before the occurrence, no complaint to any authority\n\nthat Sudershna used to misbehave and maltreat the deceased for want of\n\ndowry. No panchayat was convened.\n\n In 2006(3) RCR (Crl.) 783, Kanwal Singh and others vs. State\n\nof Haryana, Involvement of family members of accused-Where the bride\n\neither commits suicide or is murdered by her in-laws family, the tempers run\n\nhigh- So much so that attempt is made to rope in the entire family of the\n\nhusband of the victim- Almost all the family members of the husband are\n\nattributed one role or the other so as to implicate them, although they may\n\nnot have done anything in the entire occurrence-Then duty of the Court is to\n\nseparate grain from the chaff and find out if some of the accused have been\n\nfalsely roped.\n\n In Amar Singh's case (supra), all the accused were acquitted\n\nexcept the husband- Allegation against entire family that they demanded\n\nscooter and harassed and teased the bride- Death of bride by burning-\n\nConviction of mother and brother set aside- No evidence as to what was the\n\nexact act and conduct of mother and brother by which the deceased felt\n\ntortured- So far as husband is concerned, he used to taunt that deceased had\n\ncome from hungry house- This is evidence of exact conduct which caused\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 38\n\nharassment to deceased.\n\n In the present case, no evidence on the file as to what was the\n\nexact act and conduct of mother-in-law, which caused harassment to the\n\ndeceased. Before death, whenever deceased came to her parental house,\n\nthen did not level any allegation against her mother-in-law.\n\n In Court, Shiv Kumar or his brother Sunder Lal while\n\nappearing as PW7 and PW8, respectively, then did not state that Sudershna\n\nalso used to misbehave or maltreat the deceased for want of dowry or at any\n\nstage, pressurized the deceased to bring cash or jewellery etc. Evidence on\n\nthe file rather shows that Sudershna was implicated being the mother-in-\n\nlaw. When no role of Sudershna, then I am of the opinion that benefit of\n\ndoubt should be given to her. Sudershna is acquitted of the charge levelled\n\nagainst her.\n\n As per evidence on the file, vague allegation against Rajesh,\n\nSangita and Sobha that they used to misbehave and maltreat the deceased\n\nfor want of dowry. Rajesh is the brother-in-law of the deceased, whereas\n\nSangita and Sobha are unmarried daughters of Hukam Chand. They were\n\nnot present at the time of occurrence. Evidence on the file was rightly\n\nscrutinized by the trial Court while giving them benefit of doubt. No reason\n\nto differ.\n\n Crl.Revision No.404 of 1998 is rejected.\n\n In the light of above discussion, appeal qua Sudershna is\n\naccepted, whereas appeal qua Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar is rejected.\n\n Appellants Hukam Chand and Dinesh Kumar are on bail. They\n\nare directed to surrender before the concerned authority to undergo\n\nimprisonment as ordered by the trial Court, failing which, concerned\n\n Crl.Appeal No.105-SB of 1998 39\n\nauthority/CJM, Kaithal, to issue re-arrest warrants to undergo the remaining\n\nperiod of sentence.\n\n20.4.2011 ( JORA SINGH )\npk JUDGE",
