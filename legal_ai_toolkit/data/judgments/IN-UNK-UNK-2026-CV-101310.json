Lakshmanan\n(Former Judge, Supreme Court of India)\nChairman, Law Commission of India\n\n ILI Building (IInd Floor),\n Bhagwandas Road,\n New Delhi-110 001\n Tel. : 91-11-23384475\n Fax.: 91-11-23383564\n\n October 9, 2007.\n\nDear Dr. Bhardwaj,\n\n I have great pleasure in presenting the 202nd Report of the\nLaw Commission on the proposal to amend \nSection 304-B\n, Indian\nPenal Code, 1860 dealing with the offences of dowry death.\n\n The question that has been examined by the Law\nCommission in this Report is whether \nSection 304-B\n of Indian\nPenal Code, 1960 should be amended to provide for more stringent\npunishment of death sentence to curb the menace of dowry deaths.\n\n The circumstances in which the subject was taken up for\nconsideration by the Commission are stated in Chapter I on\nIntroduction of the Report. Briefly speaking, the Commission\nconsidered this subject pursuant to the Allahabad High Court's\nOrder dated 31st January, 2003 in the matter of Nathu v. State of\nU.P. (Criminal Bail Application No.12466 of 2002) wherein Katju\nJ. (as he then was) observed \"In my opinion dowry death is worse\nthan murder but surprisingly there is no death penalty for it\nwhereas death penalty can be given for murder. In my opinion the\ntime has come when law be amended and death sentence should be\npermitted in cases of dowry deaths\". The Hon'ble Judge directed\nthat a copy of the order be sent by the Registrar General of the\nCourt to Hon'ble Law Minister and Hon'ble Home Minister with a\nrequest that they might consider introducing a Bill in the\nParliament for such amendment or a Ordinance by the Central\nGovernment to the same effect.\n 3\n While dealing with the subject, the Commission had to\nchoose between two options available to it. The first was to\ncomprehensively examine the subject of dowry death in all its\nrelated aspects such as definition of dowry administration and\nenforcement of the legal regulation, and accountability of the\nconcerned agencies etc. and thereby endeavour to codify afresh the\nlaw on dowry death in its entirety. The second was to confine its\nconsideration only to the point referred to it i.e. whether \nSection\n304-B\n be amended to provide for death sentence? The\n st\nCommission chose the second option. In its 91 report, the\nCommission has already examined the subject of 'Dowry Death\nand Law Reforms'. The existing law on the subject could be\nlargely attributed to the recommendations made therein. Besides,\nthe Commission was of the view that pointed focus would be\nnecessary to clear certain doubts and misgivings associated with\nthe cases of dowry death.\n\n The Commission examined \nSection 304-B\n IPC in the light\nof various judicial pronouncements and critically dealt with the\nsubstantive as well as procedural aspects of the subject. The\nCommission finds that the offence of murder is not the same thing\nas the offence of dowry death. Though death of bride may be a\ncommon element in both the offences, the absence of direct\nconnection between the husband and the death of wife\ndistinguished the offence of dowry death from the offence of\nmurder and is a strong mitigating factor. Besides, the presumptive\ncharacter of the offence of dowry death and cardinal principle of\nproportionality as well as the underlying scheme of the Penal Code\ngo against the proposed prescription of death sentence in case of\ndowry death. It may be pertinent to point out that where a case of\ndowry death also falls within the ambit of the offence of murder,\nawarding death sentence is legally permissible. Of course, the\nguidelines laid down by the Supreme Court for award of death\nsentence, especially, the dictum of 'rarest of rare case, may have to\nbe adhered to in such cases as well.\n\n Thus having given its careful consideration to the subject,\nthe Commission reached the conclusion that there is no warrant for\namending \nSection 304-B\n IPC to provide for death sentence. That\nbeing so, one may wander as to what then has been the necessity\nfor submitting such a report where only status quo is recommended\nto be maintained and no further change in the law is suggested. In\nother words, what is the utility of making a negative\nrecommendation instead of a positive one. The Commission was\nseized of this aspect especially, having regard to the fact that the\n 4\npresent reference has been a fall out of a Court's Order. However,\nthe Commission found a lot of misgivings and misapprehension\nassociated with the subject of dowry death. Dowry death is quite\noften confused with the offence of murder. There may be\ninstances where the two may overlap with each other. This gives\nrise to demand for parity in the matter of sentence in both these\ncases. Nevertheless, the two offences are distinct and independent\noffences. The Commission felt the finer nuances need to be spelt\nout clearly for their better understanding and appreciation. This\nwill help in dispelling the ambiguity and confusion shrouded the\nnotion of dowry death vis-à-vis murder. The utility of this Report\nlies in providing clarity on the subject for its correct understanding\nand appreciation and will help in effectively dealing with the cases\nof dowry deaths by the concerned authorities.\n\n Yours sincerely,\n\n (Dr. Justice AR.

The existing laws on the subject\nmay be viewed as the culmination of the Commission's earlier\nefforts in this arena. Generally, where the facts in any incident\nof dowry related death, or for that matter any offence, are such\nwhich unambiguously satisfy and prove the legal ingredients of\nan offence already known to the law, say, murder in case of\ndowry death, the law can be resorted to for bringing the\noffender to book in such a case. In this regard the Law\nCommission noted in its earlier report referred to above, two\nimpediments in connection with dowry death cases, namely,\nfirstly the facts might not fully fit into any known offence; and\nsecondly,\n 8\n\ndifficulties in having proof of directly incriminating facts in the\npeculiarities of the situation in cases of dowry related deaths.\nThese difficulties have been sought to be redressed by\namending the substantive as well as procedural laws. Thus, a\nnew offence of dowry death has been created in \nSection 304B\n\nthat has been inserted in the \nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860 with\neffect from November 19, 1986. The section provides for\npunishment of imprisonment for a term which shall not be less\nthan seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for\nlife. The section embodies a legal fiction whereby the husband\nor the concerned relative is deemed to have caused the dowry\ndeath in a case where the conditions prescribed in the section\nare present and then the onus shifts on the husband, or as the\ncase may be, on the relative concerned to rebut the presumption\nenshrined in the section by cogent evidence to show that he has\nnot caused such dowry death. Besides, Section 113A was\ninserted in the \nIndian Evidence Act\n in 1983 providing for\npresumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman if\nthe conditions specified in that section are satisfied.\n\n1.3 Inadequacy of the existing law.\n\n Notwithstanding the aforesaid legal amendments\nthe incidents of dowry deaths have not shown any sign of\nsignificant decline. This gave rise to demands for capital\n 9\npunishment/death sentence for the offence of dowry death in\norder to imbibe necessary deterrence in the law. On the other\n\nhand, there are others who complain about misuse of dowry\nrelated provisions and plead for their abrogation. Before\ndealing with these conflicting views, it may be expedient to\nstate as to how this matter has come up before the Commission.\n\n1.4 Reference to the Commission.\n\n This matter has come up for consideration of the\nCommission pursuant to the Order dated 31st January, 2003 of\nAllahabad High Court in Criminal Bail Application No.12466\nof 2002 in the case of Natthu Vs State of U.P. In this case, it\nwas alleged that Pritipal, son of Natthu was married to Urmila\nDevi about a year and half before her death. Pritipal and his\nfather Natthu were not satisfied with the dowry given in\nmarriage and were demanding a motorcycle in dowry which\nUrmila's father Sompal was unable to give. They did not allow\nUrmila to visit her parental house until motorcycle was given\nand when Ramveer, brother of Urmila, went to fetch her, they\nthreatened to beat him and told him that Urmila would be sent\non giving of a motorcycle. Next day information was received\nthat they along with others have killed Urmila Devi. The\npostmortem report showed a continuous ligature mark on the\nneck below the thyroid cartilage as well as five continuous\nmarks. One of them being on the neck, just below the chin, and\nothers, on the other parts of the body. These were ante mortem\n 10\ninjuries and prima facie indicated that Urmila Devi was beaten\nbefore strangulation. It was also mentioned by the Doctor in\nthe\n\npostmortem report that the death of Urmila Devi was due to\nasphyxia as a result of ante mortem strangulation. Prime facie\nit seemed to be a case of brutal murder of Urmila Devi. While\ndealing with the bail application referred to above, Hon'ble Mr.\nM. Katju J., as he then was, inter-alia observed. \"In my opinion\ndowry death is worse than murder but surprisingly there is no\ndeath penalty for it whereas death penalty can be given for\nmurder. In my opinion the time has come when law be\namended and death sentences should also be permitted in cases\nof dowry deaths\". The Hon'ble Judge directed :\n\n \"Let a copy of this order be sent by the Registrar General\nof this Court to Hon'ble Law Minister of India and Hon'ble\n the Home Minister of India with the request that they\nmay consider introducing a Bill in Parliament for such\namendment as suggested above or an Ordinance by the\nCentral Government to the same effect\".\n\n1.5 Culpable homicides and varied punishments.\n\n All homicides are not murders, warranting capital\npunishment. There may be culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder, causing death by rash and negligence and death as a\nresult of causing grievous hurt. Different punishments/\nsentences have been provided for different types of homicide,\ndepending upon the nature and gravity of an offence in a given\n 11\ncase. The tenets of penology demands that punishment must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence, pragmatic and\nadequately deterrent, having due regard to its overall\n\nimplications from all relevant angles, social, political and\neconomic etc. The question relating to the adequacy or\notherwise of the punishment for dowry death may, therefore,\nhave to be considered in this backdrop. The punishment for the\noffence of dowry death is imprisonment for not less than seven\nyears that may extend to life imprisonment. Now the question\nis whether capital sentence be added to it as dowry deaths are\ncertainly most abhorrent. If we carefully examine the provision\nof Section 304B, we will note that the offence there under is in\na way fiction of law, whereby the offence of dowry death is\ndeemed to have been committed if certain set of conditions are\nsatisfied in a given case. These conditions are four in number,\nnamely;\n\n(i) There is a death of a women caused by any burns\nor bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under\nnormal circumstances,\n(ii) The death of the woman has taken place within\nseven years of her marriage,\n(iii) Soon before her death, the woman was subjected to\n cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative\n of her husband,\n(iv) Such cruelty or harassment has been for, or in\n connection with, any demand for dowry.\n 12\n\n1.6 Question in issue.\n\n If all the four conditions stated above are present\nin a given case, then the husband or the relative concerned shall\nbe deemed to have caused her death and such death will be\ncalled dowry death. The traditional criminal law dictum that an\naccused is presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty of the\noffence he is charged with, is not applicable on account of the\nlegal fiction embodied in the provisions of Section 304B\nwhereby he is deemed to have caused the death and the onus\nshifts on him to prove otherwise. Where there is evidence that\nthe accused committed the murder of woman in terms of\nSection 300 defining the offence of murder, he will be charged\nwith the commission of the offence of murder and liable to be\nproceeded against accordingly. If the conditions of Section\n304B or, for that matter, any other section of the Penal Code are\npresent in such a case, the accused will be charged with the\ncommission of that offence also. The presence of such\nconditions pertaining to any other offence will not take out the\ncase from the ambit of Section 300 dealing with the offence of\nmurder. In view of the aforesaid, the Commission will consider\nin the succeeding chapters as to whether there is any warrant\nfor appending capital punishment to Section 304B, for the\nreason that the offence of dowry deaths are highly despicable\nand shocks the conscience of the society.\n 13\n\n *****\n\n CHAPTER-2\n\n DOWRY DEATH AND THE LAW\n\n2. 1 Dowry - A social evil\n\n2.1.1 Over the years, Dowry has grown as a deep-rooted social\nevil. It has become bane for our society. It is the cause of atrocity\non woman and many unfortunate deaths of young ladies. It is an\noffence heinous, brutal and barbaric. The Hon'ble Supreme court\nin \nKamlesh Panjiyar Vs State of Bihar\n, (2005)2 SCC 388 has\nmade the observation :\n\n \"Marriages are made in heaven, is an adage. A bride leaves\n the parental home for matrimonial home leaving behind\n sweet memories therewith a hope that she will see a new\n world full of love in her groom's house. She leaves behind\n not only her memories, but also her surname, gotra and\n maidenhood. She expects not only to be daughter in law, but\n a daughter in fact. Alas! The alarming rise in the number of\n cases involving harassment to the newly wed girl for dowry\n shatters the dreams. In-laws are characterized to be outlaws\n for perpetrating terrorism which destroys the matrimonial\n home. The terrorist is dowry, and it is spreading tentacles in\n every possible direction\".\n\n2.1.2 The offenders of death relating to demand of dowry always\ntries to give an impression that to be a suicidal or accidental death,\n\n 14\n\nbut it is always the bride who meets with the accident while\ncooking or doing household work.\n\n2.1.3 In \nSoni Devrabhai Babubhai Vs State of Gujarat and\nOthers\n, (1991) 4 SCC 298, the Supreme Court observed:\n\n \"Section 304B of the India Penal Code and the cognate\n provisions are meant for eradication of the social evil of\n dowry, which has been the bane of Indian society and\n continues unabated in spite of emancipation of women and\n the women's liberalization movement. This all-pervading\n malady in our society has only a few exceptions in spite of\n equal treatment and opportunity to boys and girls for\n education and career. Society continues to perpetuate the\n difference between them for the purpose of marriage and it\n is this distinction, which makes the dowry system thrive.\n Even though for eradication of this social evil, effective\n steps can be taken by the society itself and the social\n sanctions of the community can be more deterrent, yet legal\n sanctions in the form of its prohibition and punishment are\n some steps in that direction. \nThe Dowry Prohibition Act,\n 1961\n was enacted for this purpose. The report of the Joint\n Committee of Parliament quoted the observations of\n Jawaharlal Nehru to indicate the role of legislation in\n dealing with the social evil as under:\n\n \"Legislation cannot be itself normally solve deep rooted\n social problems. One has to approach them in other ways\n\n 15\n\n too, but legislation is necessary and essential, so that it may\n give that push and have those educative factors as well as\n the legal sanctions behind it which help opinion to be given\n a certain shape.\"\n\n The enactment of \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n, in its\n original form was found inadequate. Experience shows that\n the demand of dowry and the mode of its recovery take\n different forms to achieve the same result and various\n indirect and sophisticated methods are used to avoid leaving\n any evidence of the offence. Similarly, the consequence of\n non-fulfillment of demand of dowry meted out to the\n unfortunate bride take different forms to avoid any casual\n connection between the demand of dowry and its\n prejudicial effects on the bride. This experience has led to\n several other legislative measures in the continuing battle to\n combat this evil\" (Paras 5 and 6 at pp.300-301).\n\n2.2 Law to regulate dowry\n\n2.2.1 The Government, from time to time, has come up with\nlegislations to protect the women and to punish those committing\natrocities on them. In 1961, the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n (Act 28 of\n1961) was passed prohibiting taking or giving dowry. \nBy the\nCriminal Law (Second Amendment) Act\n 1983 (Act 46 of 1983)\nChapter XXA was introduced in the Penal Code with Section\n498A, creating a new offence of cruelty, which provides for\npunishment to the husband or relatives if they harass the women\nwith a view to coerce her to meet any unlawful demand for\n\n 16\n\nproperty. \nSection 174\n Cr.PC was also amended to secure Post\nMortem in case of suicide or death of a woman within seven years\nof her marriage. Section 113A has been introduced in the\n\nEvidence Act, 1872\n raising a presumption of cruelty as defined\nunder \nSection\n\n498A\n, I.P.C. against the husband or his relative if the wife\ncommits suicide within a period of seven years from the date of\nher marriage.\n\n2.2.2. These provisions reflect the anxiety of the Government to\ndeal firmly with the menace of dowry and to curb the offences for\nwhich the root-cause is dowry. The Government again made\nsweeping changes in the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act,\n1984. A new offence called \"Dowry Death\" has been inserted by\nintroducing Section 304B in the Penal Code. Section 304, has\nbeen brought into force with effect from November 19, 1986. The\nrelevant G.S.R. reads as follows:-\n\n \"G.S.R. 1185(E)-(New Delhi, the 5th Nov, 1986) - In\n exercise of the powers conferred by \nSection 1\n of Dowry\n Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986 (43 of 1986) the Central\n Government hereby appoints the 19th day of November, 1986\n as the date on which the Act shall come into force\".\n\n2.3. Offence of dowry death\n\n2.3.1 \nSection 304B\n, IPC, says:\n\n (1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns\n or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under\n normal circumstances within seven years of her\n\n 17\n\n marriage and it is shown that soon before her death\n she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\n husband or any relative of her husband for, or in\n connection with, any demand for dowry, such death\n shall be called\n\n \"Dowry death\", and such husband or relative shall be\n deemed to have caused her death.\n\n Explanation: For the purpose of this sub-section\n \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in\n S.2\n of the\n Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\n\n (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with\n imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than\n seven years but which may extend to imprisonment\n for life.\n\n2.3.2. \nIn \nShanti Vs State of Haryana\n, 1991 (1) SCC 371\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court has stated that the term dowry is not\ndefined in \nIndian Penal Code\n. However, it has been defined in the\n\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n as \"any property or valuable security\ngiven or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly -\n\n (a) by one party to the marriage to the other party to the\n marriage; or\n\n (a) by the parents of either party to a marriage by any other\n person, to either party to the marriage or to any other\n person, at or before or any time after the marriage in\n connection with the marriage of the said parties.\"\n\n 18\n\n2.3.3. In view of the aforesaid definition of the word \"dowry\" any\n property or valuable security should be given or agreed to\n be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time\n after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of\n the said parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property\n or valuable security\n\n must have some connection with the marriage of the parties\n and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or\n valuable security with the marriage of the parties is\n essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly\n construed. Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or\n practice in India. It is well settled principle of interpretation\n of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a\n particular trade, business or transaction and words are used\n which everybody conversant with that trade, business or\n transaction knows or understands to have a particular\n meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having\n that particular meaning. (See \nUnion of India Vs Garware\n Nylons Ltd.\n \nAIR 1996 SC 3509 and Chemicals and Fibres\n of India Vs Union of India\n AIR 1997 SC 558). A demand\n for money on account of some financial stringency or for\n meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for purchasing\n manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said\n word is normally understood.\n \n(See \nAppasaheb & Anr. Vs\n State of Maharashtra\n, AIR 2007, SC 763 at p. 767).\n\n 19\n\n2.3.4. There are three occasions related to dowry. One is before\n the marriage, second is at the time of marriage and the third\n is \"at any time\" after the marriage. The third occasion may\n appear to be an unending period. But the crucial words are\n \"in connection with the marriage of the said parties\". This\n means that giving or agreeing to give any property or\n valuable security on any of the above three stages should\n have been in connection with the marriage of the parties.\n There can be many other instances for\n\npayment of money or giving property as between the spouses. \nFor\nexample, some customary payments in connection with birth of a\nchild or other ceremonies are prevalent in different societies. Such\npayments are not enveloped within the ambit of \"dowry\". Hence\nthe dowry mentioned in Section 304-B should be any property or\nvaluable security given or agreed to be given in connection with\nthe marriage. (See \nSatvir Singh and others Vs State of Punjab\nand another\n, AIR 2001, SC 2828 at p. 2834).\n\n2.3.5. It is not enough that harassment or cruelty was caused to\n the woman with a demand for dowry at some time, if\n Section 304-B is to be invoked. But it should have\n happened \"soon before her death\". The said phrase, no\n doubt, is an elastic expression and can refer to a period\n either immediately before her death within a few days or\n even a few weeks before it. But the proximity to her death\n is the pivot indicated by that expression. The legislative\n object in providing such a radius of time by employing the\n words \"soon before her death\" is to emphasise the idea that\n her death should, in all probabilities, have been the\n\n 20\n\n aftermath of such cruelty or harassment. In other words,\n there should be a perceptible nexus between her death and\n the dowry related harassment or cruelty inflicted on her.\n (See \nSatvir Singh Vs State of Punjab\n, supra).\n\n2.3.6. \nIn \nPawan Kumar Vs State of Haryana\n, 1998 (3) SCC\n 309, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the\n ingredients necessary to attract \nsection 304B\n, IPC which are\n as follows:\n\n 1) death of a woman is either by burns or by bodily\n injury or other wise than under normal circumstances;\n\n 2) it should be within seven years of marriage;\n\n 3) it should also be shown that soon before her death\n\n she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by\n\n husband or any relative of husband.\n\n 4) Such harassment or cruelty should pertain to demand\n\n for dowry.\n\n2.3.7. The offence of dowry death punishable under \nSection 304B\n\nof the Indian Penal Code is a new offence inserted in the \nIndian\nPenal Code\n with effect from November 19, 1986 when Act 43 of\n1986 came into force. The offence under Section 304B is\npunishable with a minimum sentence of seven years which may\nextend to life imprisonment and is triable by a Court of Sessions.\nThe corresponding amendments made in the Code of Criminal\nProcedure and the Indian Evidence Act relate to the trial and proof\n\n 21\n\nof offence. Section 304B is a substantive provision creating a new\noffence. (See \nSoni Devrajbhai Babubhai Vs State of Gujarat\nand Others\n (1991) 4SCC 298 at p. 303).\n\n2.4. Present Scenario:\n\n2.4.1 Now 21 years have been passed since the enactment of\n\nDowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986\n. The question before\nus is:\n\n (1) whether the Government has succeeded in curbing the\n menace of 'dowry death'? if not, then\n\n (2) Should death penalty be provided for the offence of\n dowry death?\n\n2.4.2. The answer to the first question is in the negative. The sad\naffair of dowry deaths is still continuing. Large number of cases\nrelating to dowry death is reported each year, which really is a\nmatter of shame and cause for deep concern.\n\n2.4.3. National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nGOI, East Block-7, R.K. Puram, New Delhi, published in report\n\"Crime in India - 2005\" (dated 31st July, 2006 - page 9). \"Crime\nClock of 2005\" reported wherein one dowry death case is\ncommitted in every 77 minute in India.

There are various implications of dowry in the society.\n\n Dowry has also a bearing for the female foeticide in our\n country. People do not want a baby girl considering the\n social situation that one-day they have to pay dowry. On the\n other hand, if there is birth\nof a baby boy, they will fetch some dowry. Unfortunately, in the\nIndian scenario, a girl is looked upon as a liability to her family.\nThe need of the hour is to fight this menace of dowry in the best\n\npossible way. But one thing goes without saying that merely by\namending the Act and making it more stringent, it will not help\nunless the law enforcing agencies do their duty diligently and\nhonestly. There is an argument within the law making agency that\nwhether introduction of capital sentence for the offenders for\ncausing dowry death would meet the ends of justice and would\nprove to be a deterrent. Before going further, it would be\nappropriate to mention that India is not only the land of Rama and\nBuddha, it is also the land of Balmiki and Angulimal, where\ndreaded criminals have reformed after relinquishing their dark\npast. There is another adage that every saint has a past and every\ncriminal has a future. It is stated herein that in most of the\ncountries capital punishment has been abolished. India has adopted\na very balanced approach in this regard. It has capital punishment\nin its statute book but uses it rarely. In India there is a subtle shift\n\n 23\n\nfrom the capital punishment to imprisonment for life and death\nsentence has been awarded only for the rarest of the rare cases.\nThus, even if death penalty is provided, it cannot be awarded as a\nmatter of routine. But the dictum of rarest of rare cases will still be\napplicable.\n\n2.5. Sections in \nI.P.C\n which prescribe Capital\n Punishment:\n\n Following are the Sections in the \nIndian Penal Code\n which\nprescribes for the capital punishment:-\n\n (1) Section 121 - waging or attempting to wage war, or\n abetting the waging of war, against Government of India;\n (2) Section 132 - Abetment of Mutiny, if Mutiny is committed\n in consequence thereof.\n\n (3) Section 194 - Giving or fabricating false evidence with\n intent to cause any person to be convicted of a capital\n offence provided if innocent person be thereby convicted\n and executed.\n\n (4) Section 302 - Murder.\n\n (5) Section 303 - Murder by a person under sentence for\n imprisonment for life (this section has been struck down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court as it has been held to be\n violative of \narticle 21\n of the Constitution of India)\n (6) Section 305 - Abetment of suicide committed by child or\n insane or delirious person or an idiot or a person\n intoxicated.\n\n 24\n\n (7) Section 307 - Attempt by life convict to murder, if hurt is\n caused.\n\n (8) Section 364A - Kidnapping for ransom, etc.\n (9) Section 396 - Murder in dacoity.\n\n2.6 Death sentence : Code makers' view:\n\n The authors of the\nCode stated:\n\n \"We are convinced that it ought to be very sparingly\n inflicted, and we propose to employ it only in cases where\n either murder or the highest offence against the State has\n been committed....To the great majority of mankind nothing\n is so dear as life. And we are of opinion that to put robbers,\n\n ravishers and mutilators on the same footing with murderers\n is an arrangement which diminishes the security of life....\n Those offences are almost always committed under such\n circumstances that the offender has it in his power to add\n murder to his guilt...As he has almost always the power to\n murder, he will often have a strong motive to murder,\n inasmuch as by murder he may often hope to remove the\n only witness of the crime which he has already committed.\n If the punishment of the crime which he has already\n committed be exactly the same with the punishment for\n murder, he will have no restraining motive. A law which\n imprisons for rape and robbery and hangs for murder, holds\n out to ravishers and robbers a strong inducement to spare the\n lives of those whom they have injured. A law which hangs\n\n 25\n\n for rape and robbery, and which also hangs for murder,\n holds out, indeed, if it be rigorously carried into effect, a\n strong motive to deter men from rape and robbery, but as\n soon as a man has ravished or robbed, it holds out to him a\n strong\n motive to follow up his crime with a murder.\" (see Draft\n Penal Code, Note A, Page 93)\n\n2.7 Death Sentence only in rarest of rare cases\nguidelines:\n\n2.7.1 In \nLehna Vs State of Haryana\n, 2002 (3) SCC 76, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has dealt with the case law whereby\nguidelines were laid down for awarding capital sentence. The\n\nHon'ble Court has further held that in \nCriminal Procedure Code\n,\nthere is a definite swing towards life imprisonment.\n\n2.7.2 The apex Court observed:\n\n \"\nSection 302\n IPC prescribes death or life imprisonment as a\n penalty for murder. While doing so, the Code instructs to\n the Court as to its application. The changes which the Code\n had undergone in the last three decades clearly indicate that\n Parliament has taken note of contemporary criminological\n thought and government. It is not difficult to discern that in\n the Code, there is definite swing towards life imprisonment.\n \"Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can only be\n imposed for \"special reasons\", as provided in Section 354\n (3). There is another provision in the Code which also uses\n the significant expression \"special reason\". It is Section\n\n 361. Section 360 of the 1973 Code re-enacts, in substance,\n \nSection 562\n of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (in short\n \"the old Code\"). Section 361 which is a new provision in\n\n 26\n\n the Code makes it mandatory for the court to record \"special\n reasons\" for not applying the provisions of Section 360.\n\n Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the\n provisions of Section 360 wherever it is possible to do so\n and to state \"special reasons\" if it does not do so. In the\n context of Section 360, the \"special reasons\" contemplated\n by Section 361 must be such as to compel the court to hold\n that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender\n after examining the matter with due regard to the age,\n character and antecedents of the offender and the\n circumstances in which the offence was committed. This is\n some indication by the legislature that reformation and\n rehabilitation of offenders and not mere deterrence, are now\n among the foremost objects of the administration of criminal\n justice in our country. Section 361 and Section 354(3) have\n both entered the statute-book at the same time and they are\n part of the emerging picture of acceptance by the legislature\n of the new trends in criminology. It would not, therefore, be\n wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as\n revealed by his age, character, antecedents and other\n circumstances and the tractability of the offender to reform\n\n must necessarily play the most prominent role in\n determining the sentence to be awarded. Special reasons\n must have some relation to these factors. Criminal justice\n deals with complex human problems and diverse human\n beings. A Judge has to balance the personality of the\n offender with the circumstances, situations and the reactions\n and choose the appropriate sentence to be imposed.\" (para\n\n 14).\n\n2.7.3. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed:\n\n \"It should be borne in mind that before the amendment of\n Section 367(5) of the old Code, by the Criminal Procedure\n Code (Amendment) Act, 1955 (26 of 1955) which came into\n force on 1.1.1956, on a conviction for an offence punishable\n with death, if the court sentenced the accused to any\n punishment other than death, the reason why sentence of\n death was not passed had to be stated in the judgment. After\n the amendment of Section 367(5) of the old Code by Act 26\n of 1955, it is not correct to hold that the normal penalty of\n imprisonment for life cannot be awarded in the absence of\n\n 27\n\n extenuating circumstances which reduce the gravity of the\n offence. The matter is left, after the amendment, to the\n discretion of the court. The court must, however, take into\n account all the circumstances, and state its reasons for\n whichever of the two sentences it imposes in its discretion.\n Therefore, the former rule that the normal punishment for\n murder is death is no longer operative and it is now within\n the discretion of the court to pass either of the two sentences\n prescribed in this section; but whichever of the two\n sentences he passes, the Judge must give his reasons for\n imposing a particular sentence. The amendment of Section\n 367(5) of the old Code does not affect the law regulating\n punishment under \nIPC\n. This amendment relates to\n procedure and now courts are no longer required to\n elaborate the reasons for not awarding the death penalty; but\n they cannot depart from sound judicial considerations\n preferring the lesser punishment.\n\n Section 354(3) of the Code marks a significant shift in the\n legislative policy underlying the old Code as in force\n\n immediately before 1.4.1974, according to which both the\n alternative sentences of death or imprisonment for life\n provided for murder were normal sentences. Now, under\n Section 354(3) of the Code the normal punishment for\n murder is imprisonment for life and death penalty is an\n exception. The court is required to state the reasons for the\n sentence awarded and in the case of death sentence \"special\n reasons\" are required to be stated; that is to say, only special\n facts and circumstances will warrant the passing of the death\n sentence.\"\n\n2.7.4 In \nAllauddin Mian and others Vs State of Bihar\n (1989) 3\nSCC 5, the Supreme Court laid down certain broad guidelines for\ndetermining choice of sentence by Courts. It will be useful to refer\nto them as under:\n\n 28\n\n\"In our justice delivery system several difficult decisions are\nleft to the presiding officers, sometimes without providing\nthe scales or the weights for the same. In cases of murder,\nhowever, since the choice is between capital punishment and\nlife imprisonment the legislature has provided a guideline in\nthe form of sub-section (3) of \nSection 354\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (\"the Code\") which reads as\nunder:\n\nWhen the conviction is for an offence punishable with death\nor, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life or\nimprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state\nthe reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in the case of\nsentence of death, the special reason for such sentence.\n\nThis provision makes it obligatory in cases of conviction for\nan offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for\nlife or for a term of years to assign reasons in support of the\nsentence awarded to the convict and further ordains that in\ncase the judge awards the death penalty, \"special reasons\"\n\nfor such sentence shall be stated in the judgment. When the\n\n law casts a duty on the judge to state reasons it follows that\nhe is under a legal obligation to explain his choice of the\nsentence. It may seem trite to say so, but the existence of the\n'special reasons clause' in the above provision implies that\nthe court can in fit cases impose the extreme penalty of\ndeath. Where a sentence of severity is imposed, it is\nimperative thatthe judge should indicate the basis upon\nwhich he considers a sentence of that magnitude justified.\nUnless there are special reasons, special to the facts of the\nparticular case, which can be catalogued as justifying a\nsevere punishment the judge would not award the death\nsentence. It may be stated that if a judge finds that he is\nunable to explain with reasonable accuracy the basis for\nselecting the higher of the two sentences his choice should\nfall on the lower sentence. In all such cases the law casts an\nobligation on the judge to make his choice after carefully\nexamining the pros and cons of each case. It must at once be\nconceded that offenders of some particularly grossly brutal\ncrimes which send tremors in the community have to be\nfirmly dealt with to protect the community from the\nperpetrators of such crimes. Where the incidence of a\n\n 29\n\ncertain crime is rapidly growing and is assuming menacing\nproportions, for example, acid pouring or bride burning, it\nmay be necessary for the courts to award exemplary\npunishments to protect the community and to deter others\nfrom committing such crimes (emphasis supplied). Since\nthe legislature in its wisdom though that in some rare cases\nit may still be necessary to impose the extreme punishment\nof death to deter others and to protect the society and in a\ngiven case the country, it left the choice of sentence to the\njudiciary with the rider that the judge may visit the convict\nwith the extreme punishment provided there exist special\nreasons for so doing.\n\n Even a casual glance at the provisions of the Penal Code\nwill show that the punishments have been carefully graded\ncorresponding with the gravity of offences; in grave wrongs\nthe punishments prescribed are strict whereas for minor\noffences leniency is shown. Here again there is considerable\nroom for manoeuvre because the choice of the punishment is\nleft to the discretion of the judge with only the outer limits\n\nstated. There are only a few cases where a minimum\npunishment is prescribed. The question then is what\nprocedure does the judge follow for determining the\npunishment to be imposed in each case to fit the crime? The\nchoice has to be made after following the procedure set out\nin sub-section (2) of Section 235 of the Code. The sub-\nsection reads as under:\n\nIf the accused is convicted, the judge shall, unless he\nproceeds in accordance with the provisions of Section 360,\nhear the accused on the question of sentence, and then pass\nsentence on him according to law.\n\nThe requirement of hearing the accused is intended to satisfy\nthe rule of natural justice. It is a fundamental requirement of\nfair play that the accused who was hitherto concentrating on\nthe prosecution evidence on the question of guilt should, on\nbeing found guilty, be asked if he has anything to say or any\nevidence to tender on the question of sentence. This is all\nthe more necessary since the courts are generally required to\nmake the choice from a wide range of discretion in the\n\n 30\n\n matter of sentencing. To assist the court in determining the\n correct sentence to be imposed the legislature introduced\n sub-section (2) to Section 235.The said provision therefore\n satisfies a dual purpose; it satisfies the rule o natural justice\n by according to the accused an opportunity of being heard\n on the question of sentence and at the same time helps the\n court to choose the sentence to be awarded. Since the\n provision is intended to give the accused an opportunity to\n place before the court all the relevant material having a\n bearing on the question of sentence there can be no doubt\n that the provision is salutary and must be strictly followed.\n It is clearly mandatory and should not be treated as a mere\n formality.\n\n2.7.5 Sentences of severity are imposed to reflect the seriousness\n of the crime, to promote respect for the law, to provide just\n punishment for the offence, to afford adequate deterrent to\n criminal conduct and to protect the community from further\n similar conduct.\n\nIt serves a threefold purposes (i) punitive; (ii) deterrent; and (iii)\nprotective. That is why the Court in \nBachan Singh\n case (1980) 2\nSCC 684 observed that when the question of choice of sentence is\nunder consideration the court must not only look to the crime and\nthe victim but also the circumstances of the criminal and the\nimpact of the crime on the community. Unless the nature of the\ncrime and the circumstances of the offender reveal that the\ncriminal is a menace to the society and the sentence of life\nimprisonment would be altogether inadequate, the court should\nordinarily impose the lesser punishment and not the extreme\npunishment of death which should be reserved for exceptional\ncases only.\n \nIn the subsequent decision of \nMachhi Singh Vs State\n\n 31\n\nof Punjab\n (1983) 3 SCC 470, the Court, after culling out the\nguidelines \nlaid down in\n \nBachan Singh\n case (supra), observed that\nonly in those exceptional cases in which the crime is so brutal,\ndiabolical and revolting as to shock the collective conscience of\nthe community, would it be permissible to award the death\nsentence.\n\n2.7.6 The following guidelines which emerge from \nBachan Singh\n\ncase [(1980) 2SCC 684] will have to be applied to the facts of each\nindividual case where the question of imposition of death sentence\narises, as given in \nMachhi Singh\n case (1983) 3SCC 470 at p. 489.\n\n (i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted\n except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.\n\n (ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances\n of the 'offender' also require to be taken into\n consideration along with the circumstances of the\n 'crime'.\n\n (iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is\n an exception. Death sentence must be imposed only\n when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether\n inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant\n circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only\n provided, the option to impose sentence of\n imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously\n exercised having regard to the nature and\n\n 32\n\n circumstances of the crime and all the relevant\n circumstances.\n\n (iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating\n circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the\n mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full\n weightage and a just balance has to be struck between\n the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances\n before the option is exercised.\n\n2.7.7 In rarest of rare cases when the collective conscience of the\ncommunity is so shocked, that it will expect the holders of the\njudicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their\npersonal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining\ndeath penalty, death sentence can be awarded. The community\n\nmay entertain such sentiment in the following circumstances as\nobserved by the Supreme Court in \nLehna Singh\n case (supra, at p.\n86, paras 23-24):\n\n (1) When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal,\n grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner\n so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the\n community.\n\n (2) When the murder is committed for a motive which\n evinces total depravity and meanness; e.g. murder by\n hired assassin for money or reward; or cold-blooded\n murder for gains of a person vis-à-vis whom the\n\n 33\n\n murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of\n trust; or murder is committed in the course for betrayal\n of the motherland.\n\n (3) When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or\n minority community etc., is committed not for\n personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse\n social wrath, or in cases of 'bride burning' or 'dowry\n deaths' or when murder is committed in order to remarry\n for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry\n another woman on account of infatuation. (emphasis\n supplied)\n\n (4) When the crime is enormous in proportion; For\n instance when multiple murders, say of all or almost all\n the members of a family or a large number of persons\n of a particular caste, community, or locality, are\n committed.\n\n (5) When the victim of murder is an innocent child, or a\n helpless woman or old or infirm person or a person\n vis-à-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating\n position, or a public figure generally loved and respected\n by the community.\n\n2.7.8 If upon taking an overall global view of all the\ncircumstances in the light of the aforesaid propositions and taking\ninto account the answers to the questions posed by way of the test\n\n 34\n\nfor the rarest of rare cases, the circumstances of the case are such\nthat death sentence is warranted, the court would proceed to do so.\n\n2.8 Some of the cases where the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n has commuted capital punishment to life\nimprisonment:\n\n2.8.1 In \nMachhi Singh Vs State of Punjab\n (1983) 3 SCC 470,\nthe three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court considered the\nConstitution Bench decision \nBachan Singh Vs State of Punjab\n\nand came to hold that where there is no proof of extreme\nculpability, the extreme penalty need not be given. The Supreme\nCourt also further observed that the extreme penalty of death may\nbe given only in the rarest of rare cases where aggravating\n\ncircumstances are such that the extreme penalty meets the ends of\njustice.\n\n2.8.2 In \nSuresh Vs State of U.P.\n, 2001 Cr. L.J. 1462 (SC), the\nconviction was based upon the evidence of a child witness\nand Chandrachud, C.J. speaking for the Court held that it will not\nbe safe to impose extreme penalty of death in a conviction based\non the deposition of a child. It was further observed that the\nextreme sentence cannot seek its main support from the\nevidence of a child\nwitness and it is not safe enough to act upon such deposition, even\nif true, for putting out a life.\n\n2.8.3 In \nRaja Ram Yadav Vs State of Bihar\n, 1996 Cr. L.J. 2307:\n\nAIR 1996 SC 1631, the Hon'ble Supreme Court came to\n\n 35\n\nhold that a gruesome and cruel incident did take place and yet did\nnot think it appropriate to affirm a sentence of death and\ncommuted to life imprisonment. The Hon'ble Apex Court held\nthat:\n\n \"We feel that although the murders had been committed in a\n premeditated and calculated manner with extreme cruelty\n and brutality, for which normally sentence of death will be\n wholly justified, in the special facts of the case, it will not be\n proper to award extreme sentence of death.\"\n\n2.8.4 In \"\nSheikh Abdul Hamid & Anr. Vs State of M.P.\n (1998)\n3 SCC 188\" the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that:\n\n \"Special reasons given by the trial court in awarding death\n sentence to the appellants and confirmed by the High Court,\n were that it was such a cruel act where the appellants have\n not even spared the innocent child and the motive being to\n grab the property. We have given our earnest consideration\n to the question of sentence and the reasons given by the\n High\n Court for awarding death sentence to the appellants. Having\n regard to the guidelines stated above, it may be noticed that\n in the present case it was not pointed out by the prosecution\n that it was a cold-blooded murder. There is nothing on\n record to show how the murder has taken place. In the\n absence of such evidence, we do not find that the case\n\n 36\n\n before us falls within the category of the rarest of rare cases,\n deserving extreme penalty of death.\"\n\n2.8.5 In \"\nRonny Alias Ronald James Alwaris & Ors. Vs State of\nMaharashtra\n (1998) 3 SCC 625\" where there were more\nthan one offender, it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt that:\n\n \"The possibility of reform and rehabilitation, however,\n cannot be ruled out. From the facts and circumstances, it is\n not possible to predict as to whom among the three played\n which part. It may be that the role of one has been more\n culpable in degree than that of the others and vice versa.\n Where in a case like this it is not possible to say as to whose\n case falls within the \"rarest of the rare\" cases, it would serve\n the ends of justice if the capital punishment is commuted\n into life imprisonment.\"\n\n2.8.6 In \"\nGurnam Singh & Anr. Vs State of Punjab\n (1998) 7\nSCC 722\". The Hon'ble Supreme Court while commuting the\ndeath sentence to imprisonment for life has said that:\n\n \"We are also of the view that in the absence of any evidence\n as regard the motive for abduction and as regards the\n accused who actually caused their deaths and the manner\n and circumstances in which they were caused, the\n Designated Court should not have imposed death sentence\n upon appellant Gurnam Singh.\"\n\n2.8.7 In \"\nAllauddin Mian & Ors. Vs State of Bihar\n (1989) 3\nSCC 5\" The Hon'ble Supreme Court has said that:\n\n \"Having come to the conclusion that Allauddin Mian and\n Keyamuddin Mian are guilty of murder, the next question is\n what punishment should be awarded to them, namely,\n whether extinction of life or incarceration for life. \nSection\n\n 37\n\n302\n, IPC casts a heavy duty on the court to choose between\n death and imprisonment for life. When the Court is called\n upon to choose between the convicts cry 'I want to live' and\n the prosecutor's demand 'he deserves to die' it goes without\n saying that the court must show a high degree of concern\n and sensitiveness in the choice of sentence.\"\n\n2.9 Life Imprisonment means imprisonment for whole\nlife:\n\n2.9.1 In Section 304B, the maximum sentence that can be awarded\nis imprisonment for life.\n\n2.9.2 In \nGopal Vinayak Godse Vs State of Maharashtra\n, (AIR\n1961 SC 600: 1961 Cr. L.J. 736: 1961 (3) SCR 440), the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the\nsentence of imprisonment for life is not for any definite period and\nthe imprisonment for life must, prima facie, be treated as\nimprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the\nconvicted person's natural life.\n\n2.9.3 In \nZahid Hussein Vs State of W.B.\n, (2001) 3 SCC 750, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed that:\n\n \n\"4. The Supreme Court after examining the provisions of\n \nArticle 161\n of the Constitution, \nCr.PC\n and \nIPC\n has\n consistently held that a sentence of imprisonment for life\n does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years of\n imprisonment including remission, as a sentence of\n imprisonment for life means a sentence for the entire life of\n the prisoner unless the appropriate Government chooses to\n\n 38\n\nexercise its discretion to remit either the whole or part of the\nsentence. (See \nGopal Vinayak Godse Vs State of\nMaharashtra\n, AIR 1961 SC 600: 1961 Cr. L.J. 736: (1961)\n3SCR 440; \nState of M.P. Vs Ratan Singh\n, AIR 1976 SC\n1552: 1976 Cr. L.J. 1192: (1976) 3SCC 470: 1926 SCC\n(Cr.)\n \n428; \nSohan Lal Vs Asha Ram\n , (1981) SCC 106; and\n\nBhagirath Vs Delhi Admn.\n, 1965 Cr. L.J. 1179 (1986) 2\nSCC580: 1985 SCC (Cr.) 280.\n\n5. We extract below sub-rules (4) and (29) of Rule 591 of\n the West Bengal Rules for the Superintendence and\n Management of Jails (for short 'the Rules').\n\n\"(4) In considering the cases of prisoners submitted to it\nunder sub-rules (1) and (2), the State Government shall take\ninto consideration - (i) the circumstances in each case, (ii)\nthe character of the convict's crime, (iii) his conduct in\nprison, and (iv) the probability of his reverting to criminal\n\nhabits or instigating others to commit crime. If the State\nGovernment is satisfied that the prisoner can be released\nwithout any danger to the society or to the public it may take\nsteps for issue of orders for his release under \nSection 401\n of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898.\n\n(29) Every case in which a convict, who has not received the\nbenefit of any of the foregoing Rules, is about to complete a\nperiod of 20 years of continued detention including\nremission earned, if any, shall be submitted three months\nbefore such completion by the Superintendent of the Jail in\n\n 39\n\n which the convict is for the time being detained, through the\n Inspector General, for orders of the State Government. If\n the convict's jail records during the last three years of his\n detention are found to be satisfactory the State Government\n may remit the remainder of his sentence.\"\n\n6. These sub-rules do not provide for automatic release of a life\nconvict after he has completed 20 years of the detention including\nremission. Under these sub-rules the only right which a life\nconvict can be said to have acquired is a right to have his case put\nup by the prison authorities in time to the State Government for\nconsideration for premature release and in doing so that the\nGovernment would follow the guidelines mentioned in sub-rule\n(4).\n\n7. The Explanation to \nSection 61\n of the Act is as\nfollows:\"Explanation .- For the purpose of calculation of\n\nthe total period of imprisonment under this section, the period of\nimprisonment for life shall be taken to be equivalent to the period\nof imprisonment for 20 years.\"\n\n8. The Explanation came for consideration by the Supreme Court\nin \nLaxman Naskar (Life Convict) Vs State of W.B.\n (2000) 7 SCC\n626: 2000 SCC (Cr.) 280, and this Court held that the said\nExplanation is only for the purpose of calculation of the total\nperiod of imprisonment of a life convict under Section 61, which\nshall be taken to be equivalent to the period of imprisonment for\n\n 40\n\n20 years and a `life convict would not be entitled to automatic\nrelease under this provision of law. We, therefore, find no\nsubstance in the submission made by Mr.Malik, the learned Senior\nCounsel. [Mr. Malik had submitted that in view of sub-rules (4)\nand (29) of Rule 591, all the petitioners were entitled to be\nreleased as of right as their total period of imprisonment was `more\nthan 20 years].\n\n11. Following guidelines were framed by the Government or the\npremature release of life convicts, namely:\n\n (i) Whether the offence is an individual act of crime\n without affecting the society at large.\n\n (ii) Whether there is any chance of future recurrence of\n committing crime.\n\n (iii) Whether there is any fruitful purpose of confining of\n these convicts any more.\n\n (iv) Whether the convicts have lost potentiality in\n committing crime.\n\n (v) Socio-economic condition of the convicts'\n families.\n\n12. The Review Board refused to grant premature release of the\npetitioners on the following grounds: (1) police report is adverse;\n(2) the convicts are not overaged persons and as such have not lost\nthe potentiality in committing crime; (3) since other co-convicts\nwere trying to come out from jail, there was a possibility of\nregrouping for antisocial activities; (4) the offence was not an\nindividual act of crime but was affecting society at large; (5)\nconvicts were antisocial; and (6) the witnesses who had deposed at\n\n 41\n\nthe trial as well as local people were apprehensive of retaliation in\nthe event of premature release.\n\n14... The conduct of the petitioners while in jail is an important\nfactor to be considered as to whether they have lost their\npotentiality in committing crime due to long period of detention.\nThe views of the witnesses who were examined during trial and\nthe people of the locality cannot determine whether the petitioners\nwould be a danger to the locality, if released prematurely. This has\nto be considered keeping in view the conduct of the petitioners\nduring the period they were undergoing sentence. Age alone\ncannot be a factor while considering whether the petitioners still\nhave potentiality of committing crime or not as it will depend on\nchanges in mental attitude during incarceration.\"\n\n2.9.4 In \nRavindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs State of\n Maharashtra\n, (1996) 4 SCC 148, Hon'ble Supreme\n Court commuted the sentence of death to imprisonment\n for life and further ordered that sentence passed under\n Section 201 to run not\n\nconcurrently but consecutively: While doing so, the Court\nobserved:\n\n \"We have given considered thought to the question and we\n have not been able to place the case in that category which\n could be regarded as the \"rarest of the rare\" type. This is so\n because dowry death has ceased to belong to that species of\n killing. The increasing number of dowry deaths would bear\n this. To halt the rising graph, we, at one point, thought to\n\n 42\n\n maintain the sentence; but we entertain doubt about the\n deterrent effect of death penalty. We, therefore, resist\n ourselves from upholding the death sentence, much though\n we would have desired annihilation of a despicable\n character like the appellant before us. We, therefore,\n commute the sentence of death to one of RI for life\n imprisonment.\n\n But then, it is a fit case, according to us, where, for the\n offence under Sections 201/34, the sentence awarded, which\n is RI for seven years being the maximum for a case of the\n present type, should be sustained, in view of what had been\n done to cause disappearance of the evidence relating to the\n commission of murder - the atrocious way in which the\n head was severed and the body was cut in nine pieces.\n These cry for maximum sentence. Not only this, the\n sentence has to run consecutively, and not concurrently,\n to show our strong disapproval of the loathsome, revolting\n and dreaded device adopted to cause disappearance of the\n dead body.\"\n\n2.10 302 and 304 B of the \nI.P.C\n.:\n\n2.10.1 Section 304B and Section 302 are clearly distinguishable.\n\nThe court before framing of the charges should see and analyze\nthat whether charge can be framed against the accused under\n\nSection 302 or not. Charge under 304B is made out in those cases\nwhere what is not clear is the cause of the death. The Section says\nwhere death is caused due to burns or bodily injuries or caused\notherwise than under normal circumstances. This shows that it\nmay be clear that the death was due to burns or bodily injuries or is\notherwise than under normal circumstances (courts say this covers\nsuicide also) so what is not clear is whether those persons who\n\n 43\n\nsubject to cruelty or harassment are responsible for the cause of the\nburns or bodily injuries.\n\n2.10.2 In Hemchand Vs State of Haryana, 1994 (6) SCC 727,\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that \nSection 113B\n of the\nEvidence Act says that when the question is whether a person has\ncommitted a dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon\nbefore her death, such woman has been subjected by such person\nto cruelty or harassment for, or in connection with any demand for\ndowry, the court shall presume that such person had caused the\ndowry death. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has further held that\nproof of direct connection of the accused with her death is not\nessential. The absence of direct connection of the accused with\ndeath has to be taken into consideration in balancing the sentence\nto be awarded to the accused.\n\n2.10.3 In \nAshok Kumar Vs State of Rajasthan\n, 1991 (1) SCC\n166, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down that motive for a\nmurder may or may not be. But in dowry deaths, it is inherent.\nAnd hence, what is required of the court is to examine is as to who\n\ntranslated it into action as motive for it is not individual, but of\nfamily.\n\n2.11 Framing of charge - whether u/s 302 or 304 B:\n\n2.11.1 In \nShamnsaheb M. Multtani Vs State of Karnataka\n,\n(2001) 2 SCC 577 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed:\n\n 44\n\n\"The question raised before us is whether in a case where\nprosecution failed to prove the charge under \nSection 302\n\nIPC, but on the facts the ingredients of Section 304-B have\nwinched to the fore, can the court convict him of that\noffence in the absence of the said offence being included in\nthe charge.\n\n14. Sections 221 and 222 of the Code are the two\nprovisions dealing with the power of a criminal court to\nconvict the accused of an offence which is not included in\nthe charge. The primary condition for application of\nSection 221 of the Code is that the court should have felt\ndoubt, at the time of framing the charge, as to which of the\nseveral acts (which may be proved) will constitute the\noffence on account of the nature of the acts or series of acts\nalleged against the accused. In such a case the Section\npermits to convict the accused of the offence which he is\nshown to have committed though he was not charged with it.\n\n15. Section 222(1) of the Code deals with a case \"when a\nperson is charged with an offence consisting of several\nparticulars\". The Section permits the court to convict the\naccused \"of the minor offence, though he was not charged\nwith it\". Sub-section (2) deals with a similar, but slightly\ndifferent situation.\n\n 45\n\n\"222. (2) When a person is charged with an offence and\nfacts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, he may\nbe convicted of the minor offence, although he is not\ncharged with it.\"\n\n16. What is meant by \"a minor offence\" for the purpose of\nSection 222 of the Code? Although the said expression is\nnot defined in the Code it can be discerned from the context\nthat the test of minor offence is not merely that the\nprescribed punishment is less than the major offence. The\ntwo illustrations provided in the Section would bring the\nabove point home well. Only if the two offences are\ncognate offences, wherein the main ingredients are common,\nthe one punishable among them with a lesser sentence can\nbe regarded as minor offence vis-à-vis the other offence.\n\n17. The composition of the offence under \nSection 304-B\n\nIPC is vastly different from the formation of the offence of\nmurder under \nSection 302\n IPC and hence the former cannot\nbe regarded as minor offence vis-à-vis the latter. However,\nthe position would be different when the charge also\n\ncontains the offence under \nSection 498-A\n IPC (husband or\nrelative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty).\n\n18. So when a person is charged with an offence under\n\nSections 302\n and \n498-A\n IPC on the allegation that he caused\n\n 46\n\nthe death of a bride after subjecting her to harassment with a\ndemand for dowry, within a period of 7 years of marriage, a\nsituation may arise, as in this case, that the offence of\nmurder is not established as against the accused.\nNonetheless, all other ingredients necessary for the offence\nunder \nSection 304-B\n IPC would stand established. Can the\naccused be convicted in such a case for the offence under\n\nSection 304-B\n IPC without the said offence forming part of\nthe charge?\n\n19. A two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court (K.\nJayachandra Reddy and G.N. Ray, JJ.) 1994 SCC (Cr.) 235\nhas held in \nLakhjit Singh Vs State of Punjab\n, 1994 supp. 1\nSCC 173, that if a prosecution failed to establish the offence\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC, which alone was included in the\ncharge, but if the offence under \nSection 306\n IPC was made\nout in the evidence it is permissible for the court to convict\nthe accused of the latter offence.\n\n........\n\n21. The crux of the matter is this: Would there be occasion\nfor a failure of justice by adopting such a course as to\nconvict an accused of the offence under \nSection 304-B\n IPC\n\nwhen all the ingredients necessary for the said offence have\ncome out in evidence, although he was not charged with the\nsaid offence? In this context a reference to Section 464(1)\nof the Code is apposite:\n\n 47\n\n \"464. (1) No finding, sentence or order by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on\nthe ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of\nany error, omission or irregularity in the charge including\nany misjoinder of charges, unless, in the opinion of the court\nof appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in\nfact been occasioned thereby\". (emphasis supplied)\n\n22. In other words, a conviction would be valid even if\nthere is any omission or irregularity in the charge, provided\nit did not occasion a failure of justice.\n\n23. We often hear about \"failure of justice\" and quite\noften the submission in a criminal court is accentuated with\nthe said expression. Perhaps it is too pliable or facile an\nexpression which could be fitted in any situation of a case.\nThe expression \"failure of justice\" would appear,\nsometimes, as an etymological chameleon (the simile is\nborrowed from Lord Diplock in \nTown Investments Ltd. Vs\nDeptt\n. Of the\n\nEnvironment, (1977) 1 All E.R 813: 1978 AC 359: (1977) 2\nWLR 450 (HL). The criminal court, particularly the\nsuperior court should make a close examination to ascertain\nwhether\n\nthere was really a failure of justice or whether it is only a\ncamouflage.\n\n 48\n\n....\n\n25. We have now to examine whether, on the evidence now\non record the appellant can be convicted under \nSection 304-\nB \nIPC without the same being included as a count in the\ncharge framed. Section 304-B has been brought on the\nstatute-book on 9-11-1986 as a package along with \nSection\n113-B\n of the Evidence Act.\n\n....\n\n28. Under \nSection 4\n of the Evidence Act \"whenever it is\ndirected by this Act that the court shall presume a fact, it\nshall regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is\ndisproved\". So the court has no option but to presume that\nthe accused had caused dowry death unless the accused\ndisproves it. It is a statutory compulsion on the court.\nHowever it is open to the accused to adduce such evidence\nfor disproving the said compulsory presumption, as the\nburden is unmistakably on him to do so. He can discharge\nsuch burden either by eliciting answers through cross-\nexamination of the witnesses of the prosecution or by\nadducing evidence on the defence side or by both.\n\n 49\n\n29. At this stage, we may note the difference in the legal\nposition between the said offence and \nSection 306\n IPC\nwhich was merely an offence of abetment of suicide earlier.\nThe Section remained in the statute-book without any\npractical use till 1983. But by the introduction of Section\n113-A in the \nEvidence Act\n the said offence under \nSection\n306\n IPC has acquired wider dimensions and has become a\nserious marriage-related offence. \nSection 113-A\n of the\nEvidence Act says that under certain conditions, almost\nsimilar to the conditions for dowry death the court may\npresume having regard to the circumstances of the case, that\nsuch suicide has been abetted by her husband etc. When the\nlaw says that the court may presume the fact, it is\ndiscretionary on the part of the court either to regard such\nfact as proved or not to do so, which depends upon all the\nother circumstances of the case. As there is no compulsion\non the court to act on the presumption the accused can\npersuade the court against drawing a presumption adverse to\nhim.\n\n30. But the peculiar situation in respect of an offence\n under \nSection 304-B\n IPC, as discernible from the\n distinction pointed out above in respect of the offence\n under \nSection 306\n IPC is this: Under the former the\n court has a statutory compulsion, merely on the\n establishment of two factual\n\n 50\n\npositions enumerated above, to presume that the accused has\ncommitted dowry death. If any accused wants to escape\nfrom the said catch the burden is on him to disprove it. If he\nfails to rebut the presumption the court is bound to act on it.\n\n31. Now take the case of an accused who was called upon\nto defend only a charge under \nSection 302\n IPC. The burden\nof proof never shifts onto him. It ever remains on the\nprosecution which has to prove the charge beyond all\nreasonable doubt. The said traditional legal concept remains\nunchanged even now. In such a case the accused can wait\ntill the prosecution evidence is over and then to show that\nthe prosecution has failed to make out the said offence\nagainst him. No compulsory presumption would go to the\nassistance of the prosecution in such a situation. If that be\nso, when an accused has no notice of the offence under\n\nSection 304-B\n IPC, as he was defending a charge under\n\nSection 302\n IPC alone, would it not lead to a grave\nmiscarriage of justice when he is alternatively convicted\nunder \nSection 304-B\n IPC and sentenced to the serious\npunishment prescribed there under, which mandates a\nminimum sentence of imprisonment for seven years.\n\n31. The serious consequence which may ensue to the\n accused in such a situation can be limned through an\n illustration: If a bride was murdered within seven\n years of her marriage and there was evidence to show\n that either on\n\n 51\n\nthe previous day or a couple of days earlier she was\nsubjected to harassment by her husband with demand for\ndowry, such husband would be guilty of the offence on the\nlanguage of \nSection 304-B\n IPC read with \nSection 113-B\n of\nthe Evidence Act. But if the murder of his wife was actually\ncommitted either by a dacoit or by a militant in a terrorist act\nthe husband can lead evidence to show that he had no hand\nin her death at all. If he succeeds in discharging the burden\nof proof he is not liable to be convicted under \nSection 304-B\n\nIPC. But if the husband is charged only under \nSection 302\n\nIPC he has no burden to prove that his wife was murdered\nlike that as he can have his traditional defence that the\nprosecution has failed to prove the charge of murder against\nhim and claim an order of acquittal.\n\n33. The above illustration would amplify the gravity of\nthe consequence befalling an accused if he was only asked\nto defend a charge under \nSection 302\n IPC and was\nalternatively convicted under \nSection 304-B\n IPC without\nany notice to him, because he is deprived of the opportunity\nto disprove the burden cast on him by law.\n\n34. In such a situation, if the trial court finds that the\n prosecution has failed to make out the case under\n \nSection 302\n IPC, but the offence under \nSection 304-B\n\n \n52\n\n IPC has been made out, the court has to call upon the\n accused to enter on his defence in respect of the said\n offence. Without affording such an opportunity to the\n accused, a conviction under \nSection 304-B\n IPC would lead\n to real and serious miscarriage of justice. Even if no such\n count was included in the charge, when the court affords\n him an opportunity to discharge his burden by putting him\n to notice regarding the prima facie view of the court that he\n is liable to be convicted under \nSection 304-B\n IPC, unless he\n succeeds in disproving the presumption, it is possible for the\n court to enter upon a conviction of the said offence in the\n event of his failure to disprove the presumption.\n\n 35. As the appellant was convicted by the High Court\n under \nSection 304-B\n IPC, without such an opportunity being\n granted to him, we deem it necessary in the interest of\n justice to afford him that opportunity. The case in the trial\n court should proceed against the appellant (not against the\n other two accused whose acquittal remains unchallenged\n now) from the stage of defence evidence. He is put to notice\n that unless he disproves the presumption, he is liable to be\n convicted under \nSection 304-B\n IPC\".\n\n2.11.2 In \nShanti Vs State of Haryana\n 1991(1) SCC 371, the\n Hon'ble Apex Court has held that Section 304B and\n 498A are not mutually exclusive. They deal with two\n\n 53\n\n distinct offences. A person charged and acquitted under\n Section 304B can be convicted\n\nunder Section 498A without charge being framed, if such case is\nmade. But from the point of view of practice and procedure and to\navoid technical defects, it is advisable in such cases to frame\ncharges under both the Sections. If the case is established against\nthe accused he can be convicted under both the Sections but no\nseparate sentence need be awarded under Section 498A in view of\nsubstantive sentence being awarded for major offence under\nSection 304B.\n\n2.12 Summation\n\n From the aforesaid, it may thus be seen that traditionally\nmarriage has been a sacramental institution. It continues to be so\neven at present. However, over a period of time, dowry emerged as\na social evil, leading to increasing number of deaths of innocent\nbrides. This trend assumed alarming proportions and dimensions,\nwhich led the legislature to ponder over the issue and devise\nmeans to curb the menace of dowry deaths. Where the cases of\nbride deaths squarely meet the requirements of the offence of\nmurder or any other offence under the Penal Code, the guilty\npersons can be proceeded against accordingly. The law provides\nfor death penalty in case of murder. Here also the judicial trend has\nbeen to award death penalty in rarest of rare cases and not as a\n\n 54\n\nmatter of routine. \nThe case law on the subject vividly brings out\nthe judicial guidelines for determining as to whether a given case\nfalls in the category of rarest of rare case. These are aptly reflected\nin the cases\n\nwhere death sentence has been converted into life imprisonment.\nGenerally, life sentence may extend to the whole life. The law,\nhowever, provides for release of life convicts upon completion of\n20 years detention subject to certain conditions \nlaid down in\n this\nregard. Inadequacies in the then existing laws were noted where\ncases of bride deaths for reason of dowry could not be clearly\nbrought in Section 302. Nonetheless circumstances were found to\nbe such which indicate the suspicious nature of death that\nwarranted appropriate punishment in order to effectively curb the\nmenace of dowry death. Accordingly, a new substantive offence of\ndowry death was created on presumptive basis, casting the onus to\nrebut the presumption on the accused. \nThe Evidence Act\n too was\namended to provide for certain presumptions in this regard. The\noffence of dowry death as provided in Section 304-B is not the\nsame offence as murder in terms of Section 302. A case may or\nmay not fall under both the sections. Where an accused is charged\nfor one offence, he can be convicted for another offence if the\ncharged offence is failed to be made out but the ingredients of\nanother offence are satisfied on available evidence, provided it\ndoes not lead to miscarriage of justice. In spite of such provisions\nin the law, the incidents of dowry deaths are not showing any\nsignificant decline or abatement. Hence the demand for more\nstringent punishment of death for the offence of dowry deaths.\n\n 55\n\nWhether such demand has any substance or not, will be discussed\nin the succeeding chapter.\n\n ***\n\n 56\n\n CHAPTER-3\n\n CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n3.1 Theoretical Perspective:\n\n Different societies react differently to crimes and their\nperpetrators depending upon their respective value system and\nprevailing philosophy at a given time. Reasons for commission of\ncrimes and the personality traits of criminals are so varied,\ncomplex and innumerable that these are not amenable to any\nexhaustive description and comprehension. Criminals are\nsometimes viewed as born criminal and psychopath and sometimes\nas victims of circumstances. This has been very aptly described by\nElmer Hubart Johonson when he observed in Crime, Correction\nand Society at page 3 that a criminal may be described as a\nmonster or be pictured as a hunted animal or as the helpless victim\nof brutality. Likewise, socio-economic reasons, among others, are\nquite often ascribed as explanation for commission of crimes. Over\na period of time, social approaches and responses to crimes and\ntheir perpetrators have been generalized and classified into\ndifferent theoretical profiles. Theories of criminality have a two-\nfold purpose: they help to organize existing information about\ncriminal behaviour into a coherent, systematic framework, and\nthey serve to point out directions for further research by indicating\npotentially fruitful leads to be explored. In addition, theories of\ncriminality may help establish some rational basis for Programmes\n\n 57\n\naimed at controlling, reducing, eliminating or preventing crime\nand delinquency. (See Criminology and Crime An Introduction by\nHarold J. Vetter and Ira J. Silverman (1986) p. 235). Accordingly,\nwe see the emergence of certain theories of penology which are\nimbibed in varied degrees and proportion in almost all the legal\norders the world over. Thus, we have the punitive approach which\nis traditional in nature and universal in its import and application\nwhereby the criminal is viewed as a bad guy and punishment is\ninflicted on the offender as retribution and also to protect the\nsociety by deterring members of the society from commission of\ncrimes. Then, there is another approach called therapeutic\napproach. According to this, a criminal is a victim of\ncircumstances. In this approach, a criminal is viewed as a sick\nperson, requiring treatment. Thus, it may be seen that in the two\napproaches \nreferred to above\n, criminal is the center of attraction\nand is viewed in two diametrically opposed perspectives and\ntherefore, is meted out different treatment in each of these two\napproaches. There is yet another theory wherein the focus is not on\nthe criminal but on the factors that lead one to become criminal\nand thrust is on removal of such factors with a view to prevent\ncommission of crimes. This approach is thus called the preventive\napproach. Besides, certain other theories too have developed over\nthe years dealing with different aspects of criminology. There are\nsome who deals with the manner in which criminal should be dealt\nwith. To mention some of these are classical and positivist\ntheories, retribution theory, utilitarian theory, deterrent theory,\ncorrective and reformative theory and rehabilitatory theory,\n\n 58\n\nhumanitarian theory, etc. Then there are some others which focus\non the factors\n\nthat lead one to commit a crime. To mention, some of these\ntheories are socio-economic theories, sociological theories, socio-\npsychological and psychiatric and biological and anthropological\ntheories. A blend of all these approaches will be found in all the\nlegal systems the world over though in different proportions and\ndegrees. These approaches are, however, not mutually exclusive.\nRather they supplement each others. All these approaches deal\nwith different facets of criminology and are, as such, necessary for\nunderstanding and appreciating criminal jurisprudence, especially,\npenology in an integrated manner and helps in the formulation of\npublic policy on crimes and punishment by way of prevention and\ncorrection.\n\n3.2 Kinds of Punishments:\n\n Various kinds of punishments are permissible under the law\nto punish persons found guilty of commission of different\noffences/crimes. To mention, some of these are corporal\npunishment, fines, forfeiture and confiscation of properties,\nbanishment, externment, imprisonment, capital punishment or\ndeath sentence, corrective labour, compensation for injury by the\noffender, public censure, etc. Choice of appropriate sanction out of\nmany that can be permissible under law may arise at two stages,\none at the legislative stage and another at the stage of\nadministration of justice in a given case. The first relates to the\nprescription of punishment for a given offence in the legislation.\n\n 59\n\nThat may lay down the maximum and the minimum punishment\nfor an offence. The second stage relates to punishing an individual\n\ncriminal within permissible limits so prescribed in the law\ndepending upon the facts and circumstances of a given case. We\nare concerned here with the first stage, that is to say, whether\n\nSection 304B\n of Indian Penal Code, 1860 should be amended to\nprovide for death sentence for the offence of dowry death. The\nsection presently provides for life imprisonment and a minimum\nsentence of seven years imprisonment. The subject of death\nsentence or capital punishment has generated endless debates the\nworld over that failed to reach unanimous universal conclusions.\nIndia has retained death sentence on its statute book. However, in\npractice it is sparingly used in the rarest of rare cases. There is a\ndistinct tendency to restrict its use to gravest offences committed\nin a diabolic way that shocks the conscience of the public at large.\n\n3.3 Suggestions by the National Commission for Women\n\n The issue relating to the deep-rooted evil of dowry was also\ntaken up in the convention organized by the National\nCommission for Women on 22nd November, 2005 at Symposia\nHall of NSC, Pusa, New Delhi. The Commission proposed an\namendment to enhance the punishment for dowry deaths under\n\nSection 304-B\n, IPC for the following reasons.\n\n (a) To keep this offence at par with murder and by no\n stretch of imagination it is less grave an offence than\n the murder;\n\n 60\n\n (b) To create deterrence in the minds of the people\n indulging in such heinous crimes by now it is more\n\n than clear that neither the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n nor\n the amended provisions of \nIPC\n could deter the people\n and could not register the success. The Committee\n found that because of the above said discrepancies in\n the provision the law has failed in its objective. By\n incorporating the above changes law can be made\n effective.\n\n (c) Also the time limit of presumption may be increased\n because seven years is very short a time and often the\n offence is executed in a preplaned manner.\n\n (d) The minimum punishment should be increased\n from seven to ten years.\n\n3.4 Capital Punishment:\n\n Capital punishment, also known as the Death Penalty, is the\nexecution of a convicted criminal by the state as punishment for\ncrimes known as capital crimes or capital offences. It is the\ninfliction by due legal process of the penalty of death as a\npunishment for crime. The idea of capital punishment is of great\nantiquity and formed a part of the primal concepts of the human\nrace. This has been one of the most primitive and commonly used\nforms of inflicting punishment for criminals as well as political\nenemies. In the world-wide scenario prevalent now-a-days,\ncountries like most European (all except Belarus), Latin American,\nmany Pacific States (including Australia, New Zealand and East\n\n 61\n\nTimor) and Canada have done away with capital punishment. Even\namong the non-Democratic nations, the practice is rare but not\n\npredominant. The latest countries to abolish the death penalty for\nall crimes are Philippines in June 2006 and France in February\n2007. Still many civilized nations continue to harbour this punitive\ntradition. Chief among them are United States, Guatemala, and\nmost of the Caribbean as well as some democracies in Asia (e.g.\nJapan and India) and Africa (e.g. Botswana and Zambia).\n\n3.5 The Indian Scenario\n\n3.5.1 In India, the deliberated penal penalty can be imposed only\nwithin the ambits of Sections. 121 (Waging war against the State),\n132 (abetting mutiny actually committed), 194 (giving or\nfabricating false evidence, upon which an innocent person suffers\ndeath), 302 (murder), 305 (abetment of suicide of a minor or\ninsane, or intoxicated person), 307 (attempt to murder by a life\nconvict), and 396 (dacoity accompanied with murder) of the \nIndian\nPenal Code\n. Further, cases of constructive liability leading to death\npenalty may arise under \nSections 34\n and 109-111 also. Besides the\nPenal code, there are many other laws like \nExplosive Substances\nAct, 1908\n; \nNarcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n1985\n; \nPrevention of Terrorism Act, 2002\n; \nTerrorist and Disruptive\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 1987\n (since repealed); etc. which\nprovide for imposition of capital punishment.\n\n3.5.2 Hon'ble Supreme Court has ruled that death penalty per se\nisn't unconstitutional, although some of the modes of carrying out\n\n 62\n\nthe same may be otherwise. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\ndelay in carrying out execution of capital sentence entitles its\n\ncommutation to life imprisonment, but later overruled its decision.\nPeculiarly, the deterrent value of this penal punishment has been\nrecognized in several cases by various jurists. (See \nJagmohan\nSingh Vs State of Uttar Pradesh\n, AIR 1973 SC 947; \nRajendra\nPrasad Vs State of Uttar Pradesh\n AIR 1979 SC 916; \nBachan\nSingh Vs State of Punjab\n AIR 1980 SC 898; \nMachhi Singh Vs\nState of Punjab\n AIR 1983 SC 957)\n\n3.5.3 There are two conflicting views which can be broadly\nclassified into two schools of thoughts, namely, the Retentionists\n(Pro-Capital Sentencing) and the Abolitionists (Anti-Capital\nSentencing), Functioning under the Retentionists' perspective,\nUtilitarian school of thought advocates that capital punishment\nprevents the convict from replicating the offence and acts as a\ndeterrent for future offenders. Correspondingly, Retributive\ntheorists lay down that as a foundational matter of justice, crime\ndeserves to be reprimanded, and that should be equivalent to the\ninjury caused. More recently, the exponents of capital punishment\nare stressing that the death penalty discourages criminal conduct\non the part of those who are aware of the existence and horrors of\nthis mode of treating criminals.\n\n3.5.4 Some of the famous Abolitionists like Montesquieu,\nVoltaire, Beccaria, etc. have argued that since the penalty is\nirrevocable, it should not be resorted to.\n\n 63\n\n3.5.5 Most anti-death penalty organizations, most notably\nAmnesty International, base their stance on human rights\n\narguments. The anti-death penalty scholars claim that the society\nseeks an escapist attitude by taking away the life of an individual.\nHowever, in India, adequate safeguards shield penalizing powers,\nin this regard. Even if a High Court awards death sentence to the\naccused, on appeal against the Trial Court's acquittal of the same,\nthe right of appeal to the Apex court is automatic. Additionally, a\ncondemned prisoner retains the right to get his sentence\ncommuted, suspended, remitted, reprieved, respited or pardoned\nby the Governor of the State concerned, followed by the President\nof India as provided in the Constitution of India.\n\n3.5.6 Perhaps, recent trends of public sentiment against capital\npunishment represent a broader realization that correction is more\nimportant to society than punishment.\n\n3.5.7 It may be pertinent to note that this Commission has dealt\n in details with diverse facets of capital punishment, in its\n 35th Report, September, 1967. The answer to the query\n under consideration herein may be found in principle in\n that report although the question was not specifically dealt\n with reference to dowry death. In para 77 of that Report, it\n was observed that at first sight, the capital offences (listed\n above in para 69) may not show any common element; but\n a close analysis reveals that there is a thread linking all\n these offences, namely, the principle that the sanctity of\n human life must be protected. It is the will or willful\n\n 64\n\n exposure of life to peril that seems to constitute the basis\n for a provision for the sentence of death. The Commission\n applied this principle while considering the question\n whether any other offence under the\n\nIndian Penal Code\n or any other law should be made capital\noffence. The following offences were considered by the\nCommission in this regard, namely, adulteration of food and drugs,\noffences against Army, arson, espionage, kidnapping and\nabduction, homicide by negligence, rape, sabotage, smuggling and\ntreason (Paras 462 to 540 at pp.156-179). The Commission did\nnot recommend that any other offences under the \nIndian Penal\nCode\n or any other law should be punishable with death (Para 3(b)\nof Summary of Main Conclusions and Recommendation at p.356).\nWhile reaching these conclusions, the Commission reiterated that\nthe cardinal principle of willful disregard of human life, which is\nthe foundation of the sentence of death for the existing capital\noffences would have to be borne in mind and the question\nexamined whether the existing law was not adequate. If it was\nfound to be inadequate, then before embarking on an amendment,\nit would have to be considered whether a precise formula could be\nevolved which, while conforming to this principle, could define\nclearly the scope of the acts of commission that were proposed to\nbe made capital (see Para 476 at p.160). Thus, the Commission,\ninter alia, observed that where an act of adulteration or arson\ncauses death and the conditions of Section 300 on murder,\nparticularly as to mens rea, are satisfied the case could be dealt\nwith under \nSection 300\n/\n302\n, IPC and death sentence could be\nawarded under the law. If not so, then making such an act as a\n\n 65\n\ncapital offence would not be in symmetry with the scheme of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\n (See paras 463 - 466 at pp.156-157). Applying\nthe same analogy to cases of dowry related deaths, if the\nconditions of murder in Section 300 are satisfied, the offender can\ncertainly be awarded death sentence\n\nunder Section 302 as per the norms \nlaid down by\n the apex court in\nvarious cases for the award of death sentence, the most sacrosanct\nnorm being the dictum of 'rarest of rare cases'. If not, then making\ndowry related death as a capital offence may not be in symmetry\nwith the schemes of the \nIndian Penal Code\n.\n\n3.6 Dowry Death vis-à-vis Murder:\n\n3.6.1 Dowry death may or may not be a case of murder. Where it\n is a case of murder, death sentence can be awarded in\n appropriate cases. But when it is not so, imposition of\n death sentence may not be in symmetry with the cardinal\n principle underlying the capital offences in the \nIndian Penal\n Code\n. It may be noted that even before insertion of Section\n 304B on dowry death in 1984, there have been cases of\n dowry deaths which were prosecuted for murder under\n \nSection 300\n, IPC. Thus, State (Delhi Administration) Vs\n Laxman Kumar and others (AIR 1986 SC 250) was a case\n of bride burning wherein the trial court accepted the\n prosecution case and considering it to be one of the\n atrocious dowry deaths, had sentenced each of the\n respondents to death, namely, the husband, the mother-in-\n\n law and brother-in-law. The High Court, however,\n\n 66\n\n acquitted the respondents of the charge of murder of one\n Sudha by setting fire to her. On appeal, the Supreme Court\n partly allowed the appeal. In para 47 of the Judgment, the\n Court made the following observations.\n\n \"47. The next relevant aspect for consideration is what\n should be the proper punishment to be imposed. The\n\n learned trial Judge had thought it proper to impose the\n punishment of death. Acquittal intervened and almost two\n yeas have elapsed since the respondents were acquitted\n and set at liberty by the High Court. In a suitable case of\n bride burning, death sentence may not be improper\n (emphasis supplied). But in the facts the case and\n particularly on account of the situation following the\n acquittal at the hands of the High Court and the time lag,\n we do not think it would be proper to restore the death\n sentence as a necessary corollary to the finding of guilt.\n We accordingly allow both the appeals partly and direct\n that the two respondents, Smt. Shakuntala and Laxman\n kumar shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life. Both\n the appeals against Subhash stand dismissed and his\n acquittal is upheld. Steps shall be taken by the trial Judge\n to give effect to this Judgement as promptly as feasible (at\n p.266).\"\n\n3.6.2 \nSmt. Lichhamadevi Vs State of Rajasthan\n AIR 1988 SC\n 1785 was another case of dowry death that arose before the\n insertion of Section 304B in the \nIndian Penal Code\n. In this\n\n 67\n\ncase, the trial Court acquitted the accused but High Court,\nreversing her acquittal, awarded death sentence. On appeal,\nthe Supreme Court modified the death sentence to life\nimprisonment in view of the two opinions of the Courts\nbelow as to the guilt of the accused. It will be expedient to\nrefer to the following observations made by the Court in\nthis regard;\n\n\"15. The case before us is not an accidental fire causing\nthe death. This is certainly a case \"being put on fire by\nsomeone\". The deceased having been burnt is not in\ndispute. It is a case of bride burning. The Court in State\n(Delhi Admn.) Vs Lakshman Kumar, 1985 Supp (2) SCR\n898 at p.931: (AIR 1986 SC 250 at p.266) has observed that\nin the case of bride burning, death sentence may not be\nimproper. We agree. The persons who perpetrate such\nbarbaric crime, without any human consideration must be\ngiven the extreme penalty. But in the present case, we do not\nthink that the High Court was justified in awarding death\nsentence on the accused-appellant. In 1977 she was\nacquitted by the trial court. In 1985 the High Court reversed\nher acquittal and gave the extreme penalty. It was after a\ngap of eight yeas. When there are two opinions as to the\nguilt of the accused by the two Courts, ordinarily the proper\nsentence would be not death but imprisonment for life.\nApart from that, there is no direct evidence that the appellant\nhad sprinkled kerosene on Pushpa and lighted fire on her.\nThere must have been other persons also who have\ncombined and conspired together and committed the murder.\nIt is unfortunate that they are not before the Court. From the\nJudgment of the High Court, it is apparent that the decision\nto award death sentence is more out of anger than on\nreasons. The Judicial discretion should not be allowed to be\nswayed by emotions and indignation.\"\n\n 68\n\n3.6.3 \nState of Punjab Vs Amarjit Singh\n AIR 1988 SC 2013 is\nanother pre-Section 304B case of dowry death where the accused\nwas convicted and sentenced for life imprisonment for his wife\nbeing put in fire for not satisfying his dowry demands.\n\n3.6.4 \nSubedar Tiwari Vs State of U.P. and others\n AIR 1989 SC\n737 is another case of bride burning where a highly educated wife\ndied on unnatural death by burning within a short span of nine\nmonths of her marriage. Although it was not a dowry death, yet\nthe case is relevant for the reason that the husband could be\n\nprosecuted and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life for such\nan unnatural death under Section 302 if both accident and suicide\ncould be excluded on facts.\n\n3.6.5 \nPanakanti Sampath Rao Vs State of A.P.\n, (2006) 9 SCC\n658 is a case where the accused was charged with commission of\noffences under \nSections 498A\n, \n302\n and \n304B\n IPC and \nSections 3\n\nand \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The trial court acquitted him\nof the offence of murder under Section 302 but convicted him on\nthe remaining counts. He was sentenced to life imprisonment\nunder Section 304B besides the punishment awarded under other\ncharges. On appeal, the High Court found the accused guilty of the\noffence under \nSection 302\n IPC. This was affirmed by the Supreme\nCourt also.\n\n3.6.6 \nWazir Chand and another Vs State of Haryana\n, AIR\n1989 SC 378 is another case of dowry death wherein the accused\npersons, the husband and the father-in-law were proceeded against\n\n 69\n\nunder Ss. 306 r/w 107 for abetting commission of suicide but were\nacquitted of the charge as suicide could not be proved. Yet they\nwere convicted under Section 498A in view of the fact the\nharassment for dowry was proved.\n\n3.6.7 \nState of U.P. Vs Ashok Kumar Srivastava\n, AIR 1992 SC\n840 is another case of bride burning for dowry wherein a young\nwoman aged about 25 years died of burns within less than a year\nof her marriage. The three accused were charged and convicted\nunder \nSection 302\n/\n34\n IPC by the trial court and were sentenced to\n\nimprisonment for life. However, the High Court acquitted the\naccused as the trustworthiness of some of the prosecution\nwitnesses was suspected. Though ordinarily the Supreme Court is\nslow to interfere in an acquittal while exercising power under\n\narticle 136\n but in this case the apex court found that the approach\nof the High Court had resulted in gross miscarriage of justice. The\ncourt, therefore, did not find it possible to refuse to interfere in\nsuch a case where gruesome crime was committed which resulted\nin the extinction of young mother to be. Accordingly, the Supreme\nCourt allowed the appeal restored the order of conviction and\nsentence passed by the trial court.\n\n3.6.8 The curse of dowry claimed another victim in \nKundula\nBale Subrahmanyam Vs State of A.P.\n (1993) 2 SCC 684\nwherein the husband and mother-in-law of the deceased Kundula\nKoti Nagbani were convicted under \nSections 302\n/\n34\n IPC and\nsentenced to suffer imprisonment for life. It will be expedient to\n\n 70\n\nrefer the following observations made by the Supreme Court in\nthis case.\n\n \"25. Of late there has been an alarming increase in cases\n relating to harassment, torture, abetted suicides and dowry\n deaths of young innocent brides. This growing cult of\n violence and exploitation of the young brides, though keeps\n on sending shock waves to the civilized society whenever it\n happens, continues unabated. There is a constant erosion of\n the basic human values of tolerance and the spirit of \"live\n and let live\". Lack of education and economic dependence\n of women have encouraged the greedy perpetrators of the\n crime. It is more disturbing and sad that in most of such\n reported cases it is the woman who plays pivotal role in this\n crime against the younger woman, as in this case with the\n husband either acting as a mute spectator or even an active\n\n participant in the crime, in utter disregard of his matrimonial\n obligations. In many cases, it has been noticed that\n husband, even after marriage continues to be 'Mamma's\n baby' and the umbilical cord appears not to have been cut\n even at that stage.\"\n\n3.6.9 \nKailash Kaur Vs State of Punjab\n (1987) 2 SCC 631 is yet\nanother case of unfortunate instance of gruesome murder of a\nyoung wife by the barbaric process of pouring kerosene oil all over\nthe body and setting her on fire as the culmination of a long\nprocess of physical and mental harassment for extraction of more\ndowry. The prosecution case was that the sister-in-law caught hold\nof the deceased and the mother-in-law poured kerosene oil on her\nand set her on fire. The Supreme Court observed that \"whenever\nsuch cases come before the court and offence is brought home to\nthe accused beyond reasonable doubt, it is the duty of the court to\ndeal with it in most severe and strict manner and award the\nmaximum penalty prescribed by the law in order that it may\n\n 71\n\noperate as a deterrent to other persons from committing such anti-\nsocial crimes.\"\n\n3.7 Role of Courts in Dowry Death Cases\n\n3.7.1 Awakening of the collective consciousness is the need of\n the day. Change of heart and attitude is what is needed. If\n man were to regain his harmony with others and replace\n hatred, greed, selfishness and anger by mutual love, trust\n and understanding and if woman were to receive education\n and become economically independent, the possibility of\n this pernicious social evil dying a natural death may not\n remain a dream only. The legislature, realising the gravity\n of the situation has amended the laws and\n\nprovided for stringent punishments in such cases and even\npermitted the raising of presumptions against an accused in cases\nof unnatural deaths of the brides within the first seven years of\ntheir marriage. \nThe Dowry Prohibition Act\n was enacted in 1961\nand has been amended from time to time, but this piece of social\nlegislation, keeping in view the growing menace of the social evil,\nalso does not appear to have served much purpose as dowry\nseekers are hardly brought to books and convictions recorded are\nrather few. Laws are not enough to combat is evil. A wider social\nmovement of educating women of their rights, to conquer the\nmenace, is what is needed more particularly in rural areas where\nwomen are still largely uneducated and less aware of their rights\nand fall an easy prey to their exploitation. The role of courts,\nunder the circumstances assumes greater importance and it is\nexpected that the courts would deal with such cases in a more\n\n 72\n\nrealistic manner and not allow the criminals to escape on account\nof procedural technicalities or insignificant lacunae in the evidence\nas otherwise the criminals would receive encouragement and the\nvictims of crime would be totally discouraged by the crime going\nunpunished. The courts are expected to be sensitive in cases\ninvolving crime against women. \nThe verdict of acquittal made by\nthe trial court in this case is an apt illustration of the lack of\nsensitivity on the part of the trial court. It recorded the verdict of\nacquittal on mere surmises and conjectures and disregarded the\nevidence of the witnesses for wholly insufficient and insignificant\nreasons. It ignored the vital factors of the case without even\nproperly discussing the same. (See in \nKundula Bale\nSubrahmanyam Vs State of A.P.\n (1993) 2 SCC 684).\n\n3.7.2 In \nKailash Kaur Vs State of Punjab\n (1987) 2 SCC 631,\nAvtar Singh, the husband, Kailash Kaur, the mother-in-law and\nMahinder Kaur, the sister-in-law were put in trial under Section\n302 for setting Amandeep Kaur, the deceased, on fire. The trial\ncourt acquitted the husband giving him the benefit of doubt, but\nconvicted Kailash Kaur and Mahinder Kaur under Section 302 and\nsentenced to undergo life imprisonment. On appeal, the High\nCourt confirmed the conviction of Kailash Kaur but acquitted\nMahinder Kaur giving her the benefit of doubt. When the matter\ncame up before the Supreme court, it said, \"we have very grave\ndoubts about the legality, propriety and correctness of the decision\nof High Court insofar as it has acquitted Mahinder Kaur by giving\nher the benefit of doubt. But since the State has not preferred any\nappeal, we are not called upon to go into that aspect any further.\nAs regards, conviction of Kailash Kaur, the Court expressed its\n\n 73\n\nregret \"that the Sessions Judge did not treat this case as a fit case\nfor awarding maximum penalty under the law and that no steps\nwere taken by the State Government before the High Court for\nenhancement of the sentence.\n\n3.7.3 It will be expedient to refer to the editorial comments\nprefixed to this case, which read as follow:\n\n \n[Ed.: This case is not the first time that the Supreme Court in\nunequivocal terms has commended death sentence to perpetrators\nof \"gruesome murder of young wives ... as the culmination of a\nlong process of physical and mental harassment and torture for\nextraction of dowry\". A three Judge Bench of the Court speaking\n\nthrough Thakkar, J. in \nMachhi Singh Vs State of Punjab\n, (1983)\n3 SCC 470; 1983 SCC (Cri.) 681, had clearly enunciated various\ncircumstances which could be treated as 'rarest of the rare' cases\nin which the accused convicted under \nSection 302\n, IPC must be\npunished with death sentence. One of the circumstances mentioned\nunder the category 'Anti-social and socially abhorrent nature of the\ncrime' was the \"cases of 'bride burning', and what are known as\n'dowry deaths' or when murder is committed in order to remarry\nfor the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another\nwoman on account of infatuation\". The Court felt that in such\ncases the \"collective conscience\" of the community \"is so shocked\nthat it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict\ndeath penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards\ndesirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty\".\n (SCC pp.\n\n487-88, paras 32 and 35).\n\n 74\n\n Notwithstanding the consistent concern of the Court to\naward deterrent punishment to such bride killers, in the instant\ncase the Sessions Court as well as the High Court preferred\nsentence of life imprisonment for the accused mother-in-law of the\ndeceased victim. The Supreme Court confirmed the same even\nthough the facts called for the extreme penalty. It is the socio-legal\nobligation of the Sessions Court and High Courts of the country to\naward capital punishment in such cases of bride killing so as to\nproduce deterrent effect in consonance with the mandate of the\nSupreme Court.\n\n Another disturbing feature in the present case is the acquittal\nof the abettor of the dastardly crime viz. the sister-in-law of the\ndeceased who according to the dying declaration had caught hold\nof the deceased while the appellant-mother-in-law poured kerosene\noil on her and set her on fire. Though the trial court had convicted\nher under \nSection 302\n IPC the High Court acquitted her on ground\nof benefit of doubt. The Supreme Court expressed its \"grave\ndoubts about the legality, propriety and correctness of the decision\nof the High Court\" in this regard but it was helpless since the State\nhad not preferred any appeal against her acquittal. Thus an abettor\nof a serious crime escaped punishment due to sheer laxity on the\npart of\nthe State administration. Again no appeal was taken against the\nacquittal of the husband by the trial court.\n\n 75\n\n The prosecution must keep in mind the trend set by the\nLegislature with the enactment of \nSection 498-A\n, IPC and the\nrecent amendments to the \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n.\n\n \nPathak, J., as he then was, speaking for the Court in\n\nBhagwant Singh Vs Commissioner of Police, Delhi\n, (1983) 3\nSCC 344 had made significant suggestions regarding creation of a\nspecial magisterial machinery for prompt investigation of such\nincidents, need for adoption of efficient investigative techniques\nand procedures taking into account peculiar features of such cases,\nassociation of a female police officer of sufficient rank and status\nwith the investigation from its very inception, and extension of\napplication of \nCoroners' Act, 1871\n to other cities besides those\n\nwhere it operates already. It is for the Government to implement\nthese suggestions.]\n\n3.8 Different offences arising from the same facts:\n\n3.8.1 Offences under different Sections of the \nIndian Penal\n Code\n,1860 are distinct offences. A person can be convicted\n under more than one Section if the conditions of the\n charged Sections are satisfied in a given case. Thus, in\n \nRavindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs Stat of Maharashtra\n\n (1996) 4 SCC 148, a case of dowry death, the accused\n husband was charged and convicted by trial court under\n Section 302 read with \nSection 120B\n, IPC for committing\n murder of his wife Vijaya. He was also found guilty under\n\n 76\n\n Sections 201/34, Sections 498A/34 and \nSections 304B\n/\n34\n\n IPC. He was awarded the sentence of death for the offence\n under Section 302 read with Section 304B; to R1 for seven\n years for the offence under Sections 201/34; to R1 for three\n years and a fine of Rs.500/- in default R1 for three months\n for Sections 498A/34; and R1 for seven years for Sections\n 304B/34 offence, the same being the minimum sentence\n prescribed under the law. On appeal to High Court,\n conviction under \nSections 304B\n/\n34\n IPC was set aside. But\n conviction under other Sections were confirmed when the\n matter came up before the Supreme Court, the following\n observations were made which have material bearing on the\n issue under consideration. The Supreme Court thus\n observed:\n\n\"9.The present was thus a undermost foul, as pointed out by us\n in the opening paragraph. The motive was to get another girl\n\n for the appellant who could get dowry to satisfy the greed\n oft the father. Dowry deaths are blood-boiling, as human\n blood is spilled to satisfy raw greed, naked greed; a greed\n which has no limit. Nonetheless, the question is whether the\n extreme penalty was merited in the present case?\n\n10. We have given considered thought to the question and we\n have not been able to place the case in that category which\n could be regarded as the \"rarest of the rare\" type. This is so\n because dowry death has ceased to belong to that species of\n killing. The increasing number of dowry deaths would bear\n this. To halt the rising graph, we, at one point, thought to\n maintain the sentence; but we entertain doubt about the\n deterrent effect of a death penalty. We, therefore, resist\n ourselves from upholding the death sentence, much though\n we would have desired annihilation of a despicable\n character like the appellant before us. We, therefore,\n\n 77\n\n commute the sentence of death to one of R1 for life\n imprisonment.\"\n\n3.8.2 The conviction under Sections 201/34 was sustained but the\nsentence was directed to run consecutively and not concurrently to\nshow Court's strong disapproval of the loathsome, revolting and\ndreaded device adopted to cause disappearance of the dead body.\nConvictions under other Sections namely, Sections 316, 498A/34\nwere set aside.\n\n3.8.3 On the other hand, merely because accused has been\n acquitted under \nSection 302\n, IPC, presumption as to dowry\n death does not stand automatically rebutted (See \nAlamgir\n Sani Vs State of Assam\n, AIR 2003 SC 2108). Furthermore,\n even if accusation under Section 304 B fails, a person can be\n convicted under Section 498A notwithstanding that cruelty\n is common essential to both the Sections. A person can also\n be convicted under Section 306 though\n\naccusation under Section 304B fails.\n \n(See \nHira Lal and others\nVs State (Govt. of NCT), Delhi\n, AIR 2003 SC 2865, see also\n\nKaliyaperumal Vs State of Tamil Nadu\n, AIR 2003 SC 3828.\n\n3.8.4 Thus, it may be seen that the offence of murder is not the\n same thing as the offence of dowry death under Section\n 304B though death of bride may be a common element in\n both the offences. The absence of direct connection between\n the husband and the death of wife distinguished offence of\n\n 78\n\ndowry death from the offence of murder. This is a strong\nmitigating factor as has been held by the Supreme Court in\nthe case of Hem Chand Vs State of Haryana (1994) 6 SCC\n\n727. It may be relevant to note that in this case, the Supreme\nCourt has gone to the extent that even life imprisonment\nunder Section 304B should not be awarded as a matter of\nroutine in all cases of dowry deaths but only in rare cases.\nAfter quoting Section 304B, the Supreme Court observed:\n\n\"The point for consideration is whether the extreme\npunishment of life imprisonment for life is warranted in the\npresent case. A reading of \nSection 304B\n, IPC would show\nthat when a question arises whether a person has committed\nthe offence of dowry death of a woman what all that is\nnecessary is it should be shown that soon before her\nunnatural death, which took place within seven years of\nmarriage, the deceased has been subjected, by such person,\nto cruelty or harassment for or in connection with demand\nfor dowry. If that is shown, the Court shall presume that\nsuch person has caused the dowry death. It can, therefore, be\nseen that irrespective of the fact whether such person is\ndirectly responsible for the death of the deceased or not by\nvirtue of the presumption, he is deemed to have committed\nthe dowry death if there were such cruelty or harassment and\nthat if the unnatural death has occurred within seven years\nfrom the\n\ndate of marriage. Likewise, there is a presumption under\n\nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act as to the dowry death. It\nlays down that the Court shall presume that the person who\nhas subjected the deceased wife to cruelty before her death\ncaused the dowry death if it is shown that before her death,\nsuch woman had been subjected, by the accused, to cruelty\nor harassment in connection with any demand for dowry.\nPractically, this is the presumption that has been\nincorporated in \nSection 304B\n IPC also. It can, therefore, be\nseen that irrespective of the fact whether the accused has\nany direct connection with the death or not, he shall be\n\n 79\n\n presumed to have committed the dowry death provided the\n other requirements mentioned above are satisfied. In the\n instant case, no doubt, the prosecution has proved that the\n deceased died an unnatural death namely due to\n strangulation, but there is no direct evidence connecting the\n accused. It is also important to note in this context that there\n is no charge under \nSection 302\n IPC ...... Therefore, at the\n most it can be said that the prosecution proved that it was an\n unnatural death in which case also Section 304B would be\n attracted. But this aspect has certainly to be taken into\n consideration in balancing the sentence to be awarded to the\n accused ..... As mentioned above, \nSection 304B\n, IPC only\n raises presumption and lays down that minimum sentence\n should be seven years but it may extend to imprisonment for\n life. Therefore, awarding extreme punishment of\n imprisonment for life should be in rare cases and not in\n every case.\"\n\n3.8.5 From the aforesaid analysis, the following proposition\nemerges:\n\n 1. The offence of dowry death in \nSection 304B\n, IPC\n does not fall into the categories of the offences for\n which death penalty has been provided in the Penal\n Code.\n\n 2. Dowry death is different from the offence of murder.\n\n Death of a bride may fall under both the categories of\n\n offences, namely, murder and dowry death, in which\n case, death sentence may be awarded for committing\n the offence of murder in appropriate cases depending\n upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\n 80\n\n 3. Dowry death per se does not involve the direct\n connection between the accused and the offence\n because of its presumptive character. Where the\n evidence in a given case clearly shows that the\n accused willfully put human life to peril, the case will\n attract the provisions of Sections 300 r/w 302 and it\n will no longer be a case of dowry death simpliciter.\n\n In view of the aforesaid, there is no justification for\namending Section 304B to provide for death penalty. Such penalty\nwill also not be in conformity with the principle of proportionality.\n\n3.8.6 During the course of deliberations in the Commission,\nsuggestions were received that if the Section was not being\namended to provide for death sentence, then at least the minimum\nimprisonment of seven years under the section should be raised to\nten years. This has been also one of the recommendations of the\nNational Commission for Women, and has been referred to earlier\nin this chapter. The reason ascribed for this is that a victim of\ndowry death is generally forced to undergo long and persistent\ntorture before being killed. There seems to be much substance in\nthis recommendation and we concur in it. The recommendations of\n\nthe National Commission for Women are already before the\nGovernment. It is for the Government to take an appropriate view\non the above recommendation.\n\n3.9 Principle of Proportionality in Prescription of\n Punishment:\n\n 81\n\n3.9.1 The principle of proportionality in prescribing liability\naccording to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct has\nbeen very aptly elaborated by the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nLehna Vs State of Haryana\n (2002) 3 SCC 76. It will be expedient\nto refer to the observations made by the apex court on this subject\nas under:\n\n \"The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of\n proportionality in prescribing liability according to the\n culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. It ordinarily\n allows some significant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a\n sentence in each case, presumably to permit sentences that\n reflect more subtle considerations of culpability that are\n raised by the special facts of each case. Punishment ought\n always to fit the crime; yet in practice sentences are\n determined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is\n the correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered to\n justify a sentence; sometimes the desirability of keeping him\n out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic results of his\n crime. Inevitably these considerations cause a departure from\n just desert as the basis of punishment and create cases of\n apparent injustice that are serious and widespread.\n\n The principle of proportion between crime and punishment\n is a principle of just desert that serves as the foundation of\n every criminal sentence that is justifiable. As a principle of\n criminal justice it is hard less familiar or less important than\n\n 82\n\nthe principle that only the guilty ought to be punished\nindeed, the requirement that punishment not to be\ndisproportionately great, which is a corollary of just desert,\nis dictated by the same principle that does not allow\npunishment of the innocent, for any punishment in excess of\nwhat is deserved for the criminal conduct is punishment\nwithout guilt.\n\nA convict hovers between life and death when the question\nof gravity of the offence and award of adequate sentence\ncomes up for consideration. Mankind has shifted from the\nstate of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer\nthe physical opinion of the majority that takes away the\nliberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer\na sentence of imprisonment. Award of punishment following\nconviction at a trial in a system wedded to the rule of law is\nthe outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after\nadequate hearing is afforded to the parties, accusations are\nbrought against the accused, the prosecuted is given an\nopportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his\ninnocence. It is the outcome of cool deliberations and the\nscreening of the material by the informed man i.e. the Judge\nthat leads to determination of the lis.\n\nProportion between crime and punishment is a goal espected\nin principle, and in spite of errant notions it remains a strong\ninfluence in the determination of sentences. The practice of\npunishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now\nunknown in civilized societies; but such a radical departure\n\n 83\n\n from the principle of proportionality has disappeared from\n the law only in recent times. Even now a single grave\n infraction is thought to call for uniformly drastic measures.\n Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any\n serious crime is thought than to be a measure of toleration\n that is unwarranted and unwise. But, in fact, quite apart\n from those considerations that make punishment\n unjustifiable when it is out of proportion to the crime\n uniformly disproportionate punishment has some very\n undesirable practical consequences.\"\n\n3.9.2 There is another important aspect that needs to be kept in\nview while dealing the subject under consideration, that is to say,\nthe need for keeping emotional and sentimental feelings generated\nwhy incidence of dowry death within permissible bounds both\nwhile prescribing sentence for an offence and also while awarding\na sentence in any case. It will be useful to refer the following\nobservations made in the case of \nState (Delhi Administration) Vs\nLaxman Kumar\n, AIR 1986 SC 250:\n\n \"We appreciate the anxiety displayed by some of the women\n organizations in cases of wife burning crime to be\n condemned by one and all and if proved deserving the\n\n severest sentence. The evil of dowry is equally a matter of\n concern for the society as a whole and should be looked\n upon contemptuously both on the giver and the taker.\n\n \nThe Courts cannot allow an emotional and sentimental\n feeling to come into the judicial pronouncements. Once\n\n 84\n\n sentimental and emotional feelings are allowed to enter the\n judicial mind the Judge is bound to view the evidence with a\n bias and \nin that case\n the conclusion may also be biased\n resulting in some cases in great injustice. The cases have to\n be decided strictly on evidence howsoever cruel or\n horrifying the crime may be. All possible chances of\n innocent man being convicted have to be ruled out. There\n should be no hostile atmosphere against an accused in court.\n A hostile atmosphere is bound to interfere in an unbiased\n approach as well as a decision. This has to be avoided at all\n costs.\"\n\n3.9.3 The Court further observed as follows:\n\n We were, however, disturbed by the fact that the High Court\n took notice of publicity through the news media and\n indicated its apprehension of flutter in the public mind. It is\n the obligation of every court to find out the truth and act\n according to law once the truth is discovered. In that search\n for truth obviously the Court has to function within the\n bounds set by law and act on the evidence placed before it.\n What happens outside the Court room when the Court is\n busy in its process of adjudication is indeed irrelevant and\n unless a proper cushion is provided to keep the proceedings\n within the court room dissociated from the heat generated\n outside the court room either through the news media or\n through flutter in the public mind, the cause of justice is\n\n bound to suffer. Mankind has shifted from the state of\n nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the\n physical power of litigating individual or the might of the\n ruler nor even the opinion of the majority that takes away\n the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him\n suffer a sentence of imprisonment. Award of punishment\n following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to rule of\n law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room\n after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties, accusations\n\n 85\n\n are brought against the accused, the prosecutor is given an\n opportunity of supporting the charge and the accused is\n equally given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by\n establishing his innocence. It is the outcome of cool\n deliberations and the screening of the material by the\n informed mind of the Judge that leads to determination of\n the lis. If the cushion is lost and the Court room is allowed\n to vibrate with the heat generated outside it, the adjudicatory\n process suffers and the search for truth is stifled.\n\n3.9.4 The above approach may be germane to judicial proceedings\n before a court determining the guilt of an accused. It is not\n so in respect of legislative proceedings concerning\n prescription of a sentence in law for any given offence. The\n legislature ought not be oblivious to public sentiments and\n demands. Laws are made to satiasfy the needs of the society\n in which they operate. Admittedly, having regard to the\n number and the manner of dowry deaths, there are\n widespread public demands for stringent legal measures to\n effectively curb this social evil. But, at the same time, the\n cardinal principles of penology, especially those relating to\n sentencing, have to be duly adhered to. It is important that\n legal sanctions must be appropriate, pragmatic and effective.\n\n Sentence must not be too less or too harsh and more than\n what is necessary. Both will be counter-\n\nproductive. A rational balance has to be made in prescribing\npunishment for dowry deaths.\n\n 86\n\n3.9.5 It may be expedient to reiterate the word of caution sounded\nby this Commission in its 91st Report, viz;\n\n Given all these circumstances of the usual 'dowry death', it\n will be conceded that even where there is in a particular\n case, moral certainty that the death is the result of murder,\n the circumstances would be hostile to an early or easy\n discovery of the truth. Punitive measures - such that can be\n pursued with the ambit of the existing law - may be\n adequate in their formal content. But their successful\n enforcement is a matter of difficulty. That is why there is\n need to supplement the punitive measures by appropriate\n preventive measures. This Report seeks to make a few\n modest suggestions as to what can be done in this regard. It\n is possible that the measures recommended here will be\n regarded as very mild by some persons or as radicals by\n others. But it is hoped that the discussion will at least give a\n new stance to the thinking on the subject. Some effective\n preventive measures whatever be there content and drift, are\n needed urgently. If this is not done soon, there is a grave\n risk\n that the problem of bride burning will grow out of control\n and a stage will come when one of the two possibilities will\n become real. Either there will be no enthusiasm left for\n trying out concrete solutions or there will come to be\n adopted solutions that might be worse than the problem. It\n\n will be the earnest endeavour of this Commission to see that\n neither of the two possibilities is materialized.\n\n 87\n\n3.9.6 Keeping this in view, we are of the considered view that\nthere is no warrant for prescribing death sentence for the offence\nof dowry death as defined in \nSection 304B\n IPC having regard to\npresumptive character of the offence, absence of direct connection\nin between the death and the offender and gravity of the culpable\nconduct as well as the object sought to be achieved thereby.\n\n3.9.7 The reason for this is not for to seek Capital punishment has\n already been prescribed in \nSection 302\n I.P.C (in a case of\n murder). There is no necessity to prescribe capital\n punishment for offence committed under Section 304B\n (dowry death). There is distinction between section 302\n (murder), section 304B (dowry death) and Section 306\n (abetment to suicide) of the \nIndian Penal Code\n. If charge is\n framed under Section 304B, but after recording and\n appreciation of evidence, the case proved to be a case under\n Section 302, the charge can be altered and the accused can\n very well be punished under Section 302 and if the court\n finds that the case under Section 302 to be a rarest of rare\n cases, then the offender can very well be awarded with\n capital punishment.\n\n3.9.8 In \nPanakanti Sampath Rao Vs State of A.P.\n,(2006) 9 SCC\n658 the Hon'ble Supreme Court affirmed the order passed by the\nHigh Court converting conviction\n u/s 304B\n and \n398A\n to \n302\n I.P.C.\nthe Hon'ble Supreme court held that:\n\n 88\n\n \"There is ample evidence which shows that the appellant has\n harassed and ill-treated the deceased for dowry and the\n circumstances point out that he has caused the death of the\n deceased. Therefore, we find the appellant (A-1) guilty of\n the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC\"\n\n3.10 . Recommendation.\n\n In view of the aforesaid, we do not recommend amendment\nof \nSection 304-B\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 to provide for\ndeath sentence as the maximum punishment in the case of a dowry\ndeath.\n\n3.11 Valedictory remark.\n\n \nBefore parting, we would like to reiterate the rider\nenunciated by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the case of \nK.\nPrema S.Rao Vs Yadla Srinivasa Rao\n AIR 2003 SC 11 at p.11\n(para 27) to the effect that \"the Legislature has by amending the\nPenal Code and Evidence Act made Penal Law more strident for\ndealing with punishing offences against married women. Such\nstrident laws would have a deterrent effect on the offenders only if\nthey are so stridently implemented by the law courts to achieve the\nlegislative intention\". We may add that the enforcement agencies\ntoo will have to be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of\nthe situation arising from the incidents of dowry death. Dowry\ndeaths are manifestation of socio-economic malady prevailing in\nthe society. This has to be addressed at different levels so as to\ncurb the menace of dowry deaths and not at the legal redressal\nlevel\n\n 89\n\nalone. We will, however, refrain ourselves from entering into this\narena as this does not strictly belong to legal realm.\n\n (Dr. Justice AR. Lakshmanan)\n Chairman\n\n(Prof. (Dr) Tahir Mahmood) (Dr.D.P.Sharma)\n Member Member-Secretary",

Briefly speaking, the Commission\nconsidered this subject pursuant to the Allahabad High Court's\nOrder dated 31st January, 2003 in the matter of Nathu v. State of\nU.P. (Criminal Bail Application No.12466 of 2002) wherein Katju\nJ. (as he then was) observed \"In my opinion dowry death is worse\nthan murder but surprisingly there is no death penalty for it\nwhereas death penalty can be given for murder. In my opinion the\ntime has come when law be amended and death sentence should be\npermitted in cases of dowry deaths\". The Hon'ble Judge directed\nthat a copy of the order be sent by the Registrar General of the\nCourt to Hon'ble Law Minister and Hon'ble Home Minister with a\nrequest that they might consider introducing a Bill in the\nParliament for such amendment or a Ordinance by the Central\nGovernment to the same effect.\n 3\n While dealing with the subject, the Commission had to\nchoose between two options available to it. The first was to\ncomprehensively examine the subject of dowry death in all its\nrelated aspects such as definition of dowry administration and\nenforcement of the legal regulation, and accountability of the\nconcerned agencies etc. and thereby endeavour to codify afresh the\nlaw on dowry death in its entirety. The second was to confine its\nconsideration only to the point referred to it i.e. whether \nSection\n304-B\n be amended to provide for death sentence? The\n st\nCommission chose the second option. In its 91 report, the\nCommission has already examined the subject of 'Dowry Death\nand Law Reforms'. The existing law on the subject could be\nlargely attributed to the recommendations made therein. Besides,\nthe Commission was of the view that pointed focus would be\nnecessary to clear certain doubts and misgivings associated with\nthe cases of dowry death."

The\nCommission finds that the offence of murder is not the same thing\nas the offence of dowry death. Though death of bride may be a\ncommon element in both the offences, the absence of direct\nconnection between the husband and the death of wife\ndistinguished the offence of dowry death from the offence of\nmurder and is a strong mitigating factor. Besides, the presumptive\ncharacter of the offence of dowry death and cardinal principle of\nproportionality as well as the underlying scheme of the Penal Code\ngo against the proposed prescription of death sentence in case of\ndowry death. It may be pertinent to point out that where a case of\ndowry death also falls within the ambit of the offence of murder,\nawarding death sentence is legally permissible. Of course, the\nguidelines laid down by the Supreme Court for award of death\nsentence, especially, the dictum of 'rarest of rare case, may have to\nbe adhered to in such cases as well."

In\nother words, what is the utility of making a negative\nrecommendation instead of a positive one. The Commission was\nseized of this aspect especially, having regard to the fact that the\n 4\npresent reference has been a fall out of a Court's Order. However,\nthe Commission found a lot of misgivings and misapprehension\nassociated with the subject of dowry death. Dowry death is quite\noften confused with the offence of murder. There may be\ninstances where the two may overlap with each other. This gives\nrise to demand for parity in the matter of sentence in both these\ncases. Nevertheless, the two offences are distinct and independent\noffences. The Commission felt the finer nuances need to be spelt\nout clearly for their better understanding and appreciation. This\nwill help in dispelling the ambiguity and confusion shrouded the\nnotion of dowry death vis-à-vis murder. The utility of this Report\nlies in providing clarity on the subject for its correct understanding\nand appreciation and will help in effectively dealing with the cases\nof dowry deaths by the concerned authorities."

Nonetheless circumstances were found to\nbe such which indicate the suspicious nature of death that\nwarranted appropriate punishment in order to effectively curb the\nmenace of dowry death. Accordingly, a new substantive offence of\ndowry death was created on presumptive basis, casting the onus to\nrebut the presumption on the accused. \nThe Evidence Act\n too was\namended to provide for certain presumptions in this regard. The\noffence of dowry death as provided in Section 304-B is not the\nsame offence as murder in terms of Section 302. A case may or\nmay not fall under both the sections.

Criminals are\nsometimes viewed as born criminal and psychopath and sometimes\nas victims of circumstances. This has been very aptly described by\nElmer Hubart Johonson when he observed in Crime, Correction\nand Society at page 3 that a criminal may be described as a\nmonster or be pictured as a hunted animal or as the helpless victim\nof brutality. Likewise, socio-economic reasons, among others, are\nquite often ascribed as explanation for commission of crimes. Over\na period of time, social approaches and responses to crimes and\ntheir perpetrators have been generalized and classified into\ndifferent theoretical profiles. Theories of criminality have a two-\nfold purpose: they help to organize existing information about\ncriminal behaviour into a coherent, systematic framework, and\nthey serve to point out directions for further research by indicating\npotentially fruitful leads to be explored.

Accordingly,\nwe see the emergence of certain theories of penology which are\nimbibed in varied degrees and proportion in almost all the legal\norders the world over. Thus, we have the punitive approach which\nis traditional in nature and universal in its import and application\nwhereby the criminal is viewed as a bad guy and punishment is\ninflicted on the offender as retribution and also to protect the\nsociety by deterring members of the society from commission of\ncrimes. Then, there is another approach called therapeutic\napproach. According to this, a criminal is a victim of\ncircumstances. In this approach, a criminal is viewed as a sick\nperson, requiring treatment. Thus, it may be seen that in the two\napproaches \nreferred to above\n, criminal is the center of attraction\nand is viewed in two diametrically opposed perspectives and\ntherefore, is meted out different treatment in each of these two\napproaches. There is yet another theory wherein the focus is not on\nthe criminal but on the factors that lead one to become criminal\nand thrust is on removal of such factors with a view to prevent\ncommission of crimes. This approach is thus called the preventive\napproach. Besides, certain other theories too have developed over\nthe years dealing with different aspects of criminology. There are\nsome who deals with the manner in which criminal should be dealt\nwith.
