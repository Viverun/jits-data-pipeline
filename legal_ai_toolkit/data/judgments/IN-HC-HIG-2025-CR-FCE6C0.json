Krishna Nagar, District Lucknow.\n\nIt is alleged in the prosecution case that the deceased was married with the applicant on 12.12.2015 as per the Hindu Rights and Rituals. It is also alleged that after her marriage, the deceased was beaten physically and tortured mentally and threatened to give divorce by the applicant and his family members for giving less dowry. The informant's daughter used to convey about the atrocities committed upon her to her family members. Out of the wedlock, a boy and a girl were born. On 18.02.2024 at about 10:46, the mother-in-law of the deceased called the informant and told that his daughter has committed suicide by hanging. After receiving information, when, he went to matrimonial home of the deceased, he found only mother-in-law and father-in-law of the deceased there and it was told that the other family members had gone to Ballia. A call was made to 112 by the father-in-law of the deceased.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicant submits that cause of death is asphyxia as a result of antemortem hanging. The deceased was going under regular treatment for some mental health issues since 2015. She was suffering from depression. The prescription papers of the deceased are on record. It has been further submitted that ingredients to attract\nSection 306\nIPC are clearly missing and taking note of this fact, the Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 13.03.2024 passed in criminal misc. writ petition No. 1765/2024 has stayed the arrest of the other family members and subsequently, the names of all the family members except the applicant were dropped by the investigating officer. The applicant has been falsely implicated as he happens to be the husband of the deceased. On the date of incident, the applicant was at Ballia and was attending marriage of a relative. To substantiate his argument, he has annexed train ticket as Annexure No. 8 to the bail application. The applicant has no criminal antecedents.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is not a previous convict; he has no criminal antecedents and he undertakes to cooperate in the investigation.\n\nIssue notice to respondent No. 2.\n\nSteps be taken within a week.\n\nLearned Addl.

Vs. Inspector of Police\n; 2022 SCC online SC 1387\", so also the fact that prima facie ingredients to attract\nSection 306\nIPC appears to be missing; the applicant is not a previous convict and having no criminal history and also considering the judgment in\nSushila Aggarwal and others versus State (NCT of Delhi) and another\n(2020)5 SCC 1 and without entering into the merit of the case, as an interim measure, it would be appropriate to grant interim protection to the applicant under\nSection 438\nCr.P.C.\n\nTill the next date of listing, it is provided that in the event of arrest, the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/I.O./S.H.O. concerned.\n\nThe applicant shall cooperate in the investigation and he will not influence the witness.

It is not disputed that the applicant has not misused the liberty ofinterim anticipatory bail granted by the Court.\n\nWithout expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusation so also the fact that charge-sheet in the case has already been filed, the applicant has not misused the liberty of interim anticipatory bail granted by the Court coupled with the undertaking given by the applicant that he will cooperate in the trial, the interim protection granted by this Court vide order dated 21.8.2024 is made absolute.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, the anticipatory bail application isallowed.\n\nAugust 26, 2025\n\nShravan",
