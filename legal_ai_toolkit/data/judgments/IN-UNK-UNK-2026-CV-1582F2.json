Introduction\n\n1.1 Keeping in view the representations received from various quarters and\n\nobservations made by the Supreme Court and the High Courts, the Home\n\nSecretary, Government of India through his D.O. letter dated 1st September,\n\n2009 requested the Law Commission of India to consider suggesting\n\namendment, if any to\n s.498A\n of Indian Penal Code or other measures to check\n\nthe alleged misuse of the said provision. Thereafter, in the case of Preeti Gupta\n\nvs. State of Jharkhand, (2010) the Supreme Court observed that \"serious re-\n\nlook of the entire provision is warranted by the Legislature. It is a matter of\n\ncommon knowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a\n\nlarge number of complaints. The tendency of over-implication is also reflected\n\nin a very large number of cases\". Copy of the Judgment has been directed to\n\nbe sent to the Law Commission and Union Law Secretary for taking appropriate\n\nsteps. The Law Commission of India after intense deliberations released a\n\nConsultation Paper-cum-Questionnaire which is attached to this report as\n\nAnnexure-I.\n\n1.2 S.498A was introduced in the year 1983 to protect married women from\n\nbeing subjected to cruelty by the husband or his relatives. A punishment\n\nextending to 3 years and fine has been prescribed. The expression 'cruelty' has\n\nbeen defined in wide terms so as to include inflicting physical or mental harm\n\nto the body or health of the woman and indulging in acts of harassment with a\n\nview to coerce her or her relations to meet any unlawful demand for any\n\n 1\n property or valuable security. Harassment for dowry falls within the sweep of\n\nlatter limb of the section. Creating a situation driving the woman to commit\n\nsuicide is also one of the ingredients of 'cruelty'. The offence under s.498A is\n\ncognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable. The section is extracted\n\nbelow:\n\n 498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\n cruelty-Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a\n woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punishable with\n imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also\n be liable to fine.\n\n Explanation.-For the purpose of this section, \"cruelty\" means-\n\n (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to\n drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or\n danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of\n woman; or\n (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a\n view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any\n unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is\n on account of failure by her or any person related to her to\n meet such demand.\"\n\n1.3 Several enactments and provisions have been brought on the statute\n\nbook during the last two or three decades to address the concerns of liberty,\n\ndignity and equal respect for women founded on the community perception\n\nthat women suffer violence or deprived of their constitutional rights owing to\n\nseveral social and cultural factors. Meaningful debates and persuasions have\n\nled to these enactments. The insertion of \nSection 498A\n IPC is one such move\n\nand it penalizes offensive conduct of the husband and his relatives towards the\n\nmarried woman. The provision together with allied provisions in Cr. P.C. are so\n\ndesigned as to impart an element of deterrence. In course of time, a spate of\n 2\n reports of misuse of the section by means of false / exaggerated allegations and\n\nimplication of several relatives of the husband have been pouring in. Though\n\nthere are widespread complaints and even the judiciary has taken cognizance\n\nof large scale misuse, there is no reliable data based on empirical study as\n\nregards the extent of the alleged misuse. There are different versions about it\n\nand the percentage of misuse given by them is based on their experience or\n\nipse dixit, rather than ground level study.\n\n2. Judicial decisions\n\n2.1 In the case of Preeti Gupta Vs. State of Jharkhand1 (supra) decided in\n\n2010, the Supreme Court observed that a serious relook of the provision is\n\nwarranted by the Legislature. The Court said: \"It is a matter of common\n\nknowledge that exaggerated versions of the incidents are reflected in a large\n\nnumber of complaints\". The Court took note of the common tendency to\n\nimplicate husband and all his immediate relations. The Supreme Court\n\ndirected the Registry to send a copy of judgment to the Law Commission and\n\nUnion Law Secretary so that appropriate steps may be taken in the larger\n\ninterests of society. In an earlier case also - Sushil Kumar Sharma Vs. UOI2\n\n(2005), the Supreme Court lamented that in many instances, complaints under\n\ns.498A were being filed with an oblique motive to wreck personal vendetta and\n\nobserved. \"It may therefore become necessary for the Legislature to find out\n\nways how the makers of frivolous complaints or allegations can be\n\n1\n AIR 2010 SC 3363\n2\n 2005 6 SCC 281\n\n 3\n appropriately dealt with\". It was also observed that \"by misuse of the\n\nprovision, a new legal terrorism can be unleashed\".\n\n2.2 Various High Courts in the country have also noted that in several\n\ninstances, omnibus allegations are made against the husband and his\n\nrelations and the complaints are filed without proper justification. The need to\n\nexercise caution in the case of arrest of the husband and his relatives has been\n\nstressed while observing that by such a step, the possibility of reconciliation\n\nbecomes remote and problematic. In some of the cases, directions were given\n\nby the High Courts for regulating the power of arrest and for taking necessary\n\nsteps to initiate conciliatory effort at the earliest point of time. Reference may\n\nbe made in this context to the decision of Delhi High Court in Chandrabhan Vs.\n\nState (order dated 4.8.2008 in Bail application No.1627/2008) and of the\n\nMadras High Court in the case of Tr. Ramaiah Vs. State (order dated 7.7.2008\n\nand 4.8.2008 in MP No.1 of 2008 in Crl. O.P. No.10896 of 2008). In the former\n\ncase, it was observed that \"there is no iota of doubt that most of the complaints\n\nare filed in the heat of the moment over trifling fights and ego clashes. It is also\n\na matter of common knowledge that in their tussle and ongoing hostility, the\n\nhapless children are the worst victims\". The following directions were given to\n\nthe police authorities:\n\n i) \"FIR should not be registered in a routine manner.\n ii) Endeavour of the police should be to scrutinize complaints carefully\n and then register FIR.\n iii) No case under \nsection 498-A\n/\n406\n IPC should be registered without\n the prior approval of DCP/Addl. DCP.\n iv) Before the registration of FIR, all possible efforts should be made for\n reconciliation and in case it is found that there is no possibility of\n\n 4\n settlement, then, necessary steps should, in the first instance, be\n taken to ensure return of sthridhan and dowry articles to the\n complainant.\n v) Arrest of main accused be made only after thorough investigation has\n been conducted and with the prior approval of the ACP/DCP.\n vi) In the case of collateral accused such as in-laws, prior approval of\n DCP should be there on the file.\"\n\n The other directions given were :-\n\n The Delhi Legal Services Authority, National Commission for Women,\n\nNGOs and social workers working for upliftment of women should set up a\n\ndesk in Crime Against Women Cell to provide them with conciliation services,\n\nso that before the State machinery is set in motion, the matter is amicably\n\nsettled at that very stage. The need to explore the possibility of reunion and\n\nconciliation when the case reaches the Court was also stressed. In conclusion,\n\nit was observed that in these matters, the parties themselves can adopt a\n\nconciliatory approach without intervention of any outside agency.\n\n2.3 In an earlier judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of \"Court on its\n\nown in Motion vs. CBI\", reported in 109 (2003) Delhi Law Times 494, similar\n\ndirections were issued to the police and courts regarding arrest, grant of bail,\n\nconciliation etc. It appears that these procedural directions issued by the High\n\nCourt are being followed in Delhi as stated by senior police officers of Delhi,\n\nthough according to the version of some lawyers, there are many instances of\n\nviolation at the police station level. It is to be mentioned that after the order in\n\nChander Bhan's case, (supra), the Commissioner of Police of Delhi issued\n\n 5\n Standing Order No.330 of 2008 compiling the \"Guidelines for Arrest\" as laid\n\ndown by the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court. The judgments relevant to\n\nSection 498-A and the directions issued therein were referred to in the\n\nStanding Order. It is learnt that the practice of obtaining the permission of\n\nACP/DCP level officers before effecting arrest of husband/relatives is being\n\nfollowed in Delhi. In many States, according to information received by the\n\nChairman of this Commission, there are no systemic guidelines and there is no\n\nregular monitoring of this type of cases by the higher officials. Ad-hoc\n\npractices and procedures are in vogue.\n\n2.4 The directives given by the Madras High Court in the case of Tr. Ramiah\n\nare as follows:\n\n i) Except in cases of dowry death/suicide and offences of\n serious nature, the Station House Officers of the All Women Police\n Stations are to register F.I.R. only on approval of the Dowry\n Prohibition Officer concerned.\n ii) Social workers/mediators with experience may be\n nominated and housed in the same premises of All Women Police\n Stations along with Dowry Prohibition Officers.\n iii) Arrest in matrimonial disputes, in particular arrest of\n aged, infirm, sick persons and minors, shall not be made by the\n Station House Officers of the All Women Police Stations.\n iv) If arrest is necessary during investigation, sanction\n must be obtained from the Superintendent of Police concerned by\n forwarding the reasons recorded in writing.\n v) Arrest can be made after filing of the final report\n before the Magistrate concerned if there is non-cooperation and\n abscondance of accused persons, and after receipt of appropriate\n order (Non-Bailable Warrant).\n vi) Charge sheet must be filed within a period of 30 days\n from the date of registration of the F.I.R. and in case of failure,\n extension of time shall be sought for from the jurisdiction\n Magistrate indicating the reasons for the failure.\n vii) No weapon including lathis/physical force be used while\n handling cases at the All Women Police Stations.\n 6\n viii) Complainants/victims should be provided with adequate\n security/accommodation at Government Home and interest of the\n children must be taken care of.\n ix) Stridana properties/movables and immovable to be restored\n at the earliest to the victims/complainants and legal aid may be\n arranged for them through Legal Services Authority for immediate\n redressal of their grievances.\"\n\n2.5 Pursuant to this order, the Director-General of Police, Tamil Nadu,\n\nissued a circular to the effect that the said orders of the Court should be\n\nstrictly followed. In the further order dated 4.8.2008, the Court observed that\n\nwhen the I.O. seeks remand of the accused, the Magistrate must examine the\n\nnecessity therefor and the remand should not be ordered mechanically on the\n\nmere request of the I.O. The Magistrate should be satisfied that sufficient\n\ngrounds exist for directing remand. Further, the Court deprecated the practice\n\nof conducting lengthy panchayats in police stations.\n\n2.6 As regards the decisions of Delhi and Madras High Courts referred to\n\nabove, there are a few comments which we consider appropriate to make. The\n\ndecisions make the offence practically bailable by reason of various\n\nqualifications and restrictions prescribed. The decision of Madras High court\n\ngoes to the extent of saying that arrest can be made only after filing of the final\n\nreport before the Magistrate and on the basis of non-bailable warrant issued by\n\nthe Magistrate. Whether this judicial law-making based on experience and\n\nexpediency of restraining the power of arrest in matters arising out of\n\nmatrimonial problems, is legally sound is one question that arises. Secondly,\n\nwhether the registration of FIR can be deferred for sometime i.e., till initial\n\ninvestigation and reconciliation process is completed, is another point that\n 7\n arises. In Bhajan Lal's case3, the Supreme Court observed, \"It is therefore,\n\nmanifestly clear that if any information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid\n\nbefore an officer in charge of a police station satisfying the requirements of\n\nSection 154(1) of the Code, the said police officer has no other option except to\n\nenter the substance thereof in the prescribed form, that is to say, to register a\n\ncase on the basis of such information.\"\n\n2.7 However, in a recent case of Lalita Kumari v. State of Uttar Pradesh 4, the\n\nquestion whether a police officer is bound to register the FIR when a cognizable\n\noffence is made out or he has the discretion to conduct some kind of\n\npreliminary inquiry before registration of FIR, has been referred to a larger\n\nbench of Supreme Court in view of the apparent divergence in views. The law\n\non this point is therefore in an uncertain state. In this situation, the police in\n\nvarious States have to follow the law laid down or directives issued by the\n\nrespective High Courts in regard to registration of FIR till the law is settled by\n\nthe Supreme Court. Shri Amarjit Singh, ld. Member of the Commission has\n\nsuggested that except in cases of physical violence, the FIR need not be\n\nregistered instantaneously without any enquiry being made. Whether there\n\nshould be a legislative provision in this regard specifically with reference to\n\nF.I.Rs under S, 498-A is a matter on which a fresh look could be taken after\n\nthe Supreme Court interprets the relevant Sections in the above case.\n\n3\n State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, AIR 1992 SC 604\n4\n AIR 2012 SC 1515\n\n 8\n 3. Some data regarding Prosecutions u/s 498-A\n\n3\n.1 The complaint of over-implication noticed by the Courts is borne out by\n\nthe statistical data of the cases under S,498A. According to informations\n\nreceived from the Hon'ble High Courts (during the year 2011), 3,40,555 cases\n\nunder \nSection 498-A\n IPC were pending trial in various courts towards the end\n\nof 2010. There were as many as 9,38,809 accused implicated in these cases.\n\nThis does not include cases pertaining to Punjab and Haryana (statistics not\n\navailable). The implication of the relatives of husband was found to be\n\nunjustified in a large number of decided cases. While so, it appears that the\n\nwomen especially from the poor strata of the society living in rural areas rarely\n\ntake resort to the provision, though they are the worst sufferers. However,\n\naccording to Delhi Police officials, with whom the Commission had interacted,\n\nwomen from poor background living in slums are also coming forward to file\n\ncomplaints.\n\n3.2 According to the statistics published by National Crime Records Bureau\n\nfor the year 2011 (Table4), 3,39,902 cases under S,498A were pending trial in\n\nvarious courts at the end of the year and 29,669 cases under S,304-B of \nIPC\n.\n\nThe conviction rate in S,498A cases is 21.2% and in S,304-B cases, it is 35.8%.\n\nNumber of cases reported under S,498A in the year 2011 are 99,135 and\n\nduring the two previous years, they were 94,041 and 89,546. Thus, there is\n\nslight increase (about 5%) in the reported cases every year. As stated earlier,\n\nmany cases go unreported. The statistics relating to reported incidents may\n\nnot therefore furnish a reliable comparative indicator of the actual incidence of\n\n 9\n crimes in the States. For instance, when compared to other cities, the\n\npercentage share of incidents reported under S, 498-A is the 2nd highest in\n\nDelhi. It may be because that the percentage of reporting is apparently high.\n\nThe dowry-death cases (S,304-B) reported during the years 2009-11 are: 8,383,\n\n8,391 and 8,618. There is a view-point that if the offence under S,498A is\n\nmade bailable or non-cognizable, it will cease to be a deterrent against cruelty\n\ninflicted on married women and the dowry-deaths may increase.\n\n3.3 As noticed earlier, the conviction rate in respect of the cases under\n\ns.498A is quite low - it is about 20%. It is learnt that on account of\n\nsubsequent events such as out-of-court settlement, the complainant women do\n\nnot evince interest in taking the prosecution to its logical conclusion. Further,\n\nineffective investigation is also known to be one of the reasons for low\n\nconviction rate.\n\n4. Arguments: Pro & Contra\n\n4.1 The arguments for relieving the rigour of s.498A by suitable amendments\n\n(which find support from the observations in Court judgments and Justice\n\nMalimath Committee's report on Reforms of Criminal Justice System) are:\n\n The harsh law, far from helping the genuine victimized women, has\n become a source o blackmail and harassment of husbands and others.\n Once a complaint (FIR) is lodged with the Police under\n s.498A\n/\n406\n IPC, it\n becomes an easy tool in the hands of the Police to arrest or threaten to\n arrest the husband and other relatives named in the FIR without even\n considering the intrinsic worth of the allegations and making a preliminary\n investigation. When the members of a family are arrested and sent to jail,\n with no immediate prospect of bail, the chances of amicable re-conciliation\n or salvaging the marriage, will be lost once and for all. The possibility of\n reconciliation, it is pointed out, cannot be ruled out and it should be fully\n explored. The imminent arrest by the Police will thus be counter-\n productive. The long and protracted criminal trials lead to acrimony and\n 10\n bitterness in the relationship among the kith and kin of the family.\n Pragmatic realities have to be taken into consideration while dealing with\n matrimonial matters with due regard to the fact that it is a sensitive family\n problem which shall not be allowed to be aggravated by over-\n zealous/callous actions on the part of the Police by taking advantage of\n the harsh provisions of\n s.498A\n of IPC together with its related provisions in\n \nCrPC\n. It is pointed out that the sting is not in s.498A as such, but in the\n provisions of \nCrPC\n making the offence non-compoundable and non-\n bailable.\n\n4.2 The arguments, on the other hand, in support of maintaining the status\n\nquo are briefly:\n\n S.498A and other legislations like \nProtection of Women from Domestic\n\nViolence Act\n have been specifically enacted to protect a vulnerable section of\n\nthe society who have been the victims of cruelty and harassment. The social\n\npurpose behind it will be lost if the rigour of the provision is diluted. The\n\nabuse or misuse of law is not peculiar to this provision. The misuse can\n\nhowever be curtailed within the existing framework of law. For instance, the\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs can issue 'advisories' to State Governments to avoid\n\nunnecessary arrests and to strictly observe the procedures laid down in the law\n\ngoverning arrests. The power to arrest should only be exercised after a\n\nreasonable satisfaction is reached as to the bona fides of a complaint and the\n\ncomplicity of those against whom accusations are made. The \"Crime Against\n\nWomen Cells\" should be headed by well trained and senior lady police officers.\n\nThese steps would go a long way in preventing the so-called misuse. Side by\n\nside, steps can be taken to effect conciliation between the spouses in conflict\n\nand the recourse to filing of a charge-sheet under s.498A shall be had only in\n\ncases where such efforts fail and there appears to be a prima facie case.\n 11\n Counselling of parties should be done by professionally qualified counsellors\n\nand not by the Police. These views have been echoed among others by the\n\nMinistry of Women and Child Development.\n\n4.3 Further, it is pointed out that a married woman ventures to go to the\n\nPolice station to make a complaint against her husband and other close\n\nrelations only out of despair and being left with no other remedy against\n\ncruelty and harassment. In such a situation, the existing law should be\n\nallowed to take its own course rather than over-reacting to the misuse in some\n\ncases. There is also a view expressed that when once the offending family\n\nmembers get the scent of the complaint, there may be further torture of the\n\ncomplainant and her life and liberty may be endangered if the Police do not act\n\nswiftly and sternly. It is contended that in the wake of ever increasing crimes\n\nleading to unnatural deaths of women in marital homes, any dilution of Section\n\n498-A is not warranted. Secondly, during the process of mediation also, she is\n\nvulnerable to threats and harassment. Such situations too need to be taken\n\ncare of.\n\n5. Thus, the triple problems that have cropped up in the course of\n\nimplementation of the provision are:(a) the police straightaway rushing to\n\narrest the husband and even his other family members (named in the FIR), (b)\n\ntendency to implicate, with little or no justification the in-laws and other\n\nrelations residing in the marital home and even outside the home, overtaken by\n\nfeelings of emotion and vengeance or on account of wrong advice, and (c) lack\n\n 12\n of professional, sensitive and empathetic approach on the part of the police to\n\nthe problems of woman under distress.\n\n6. View of National Commission for Women\n\n6.1 The view point of National Commission for Women represented by\n\nMember-Secretary placed before the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions\n\n(Rajya Sabha) (report presented on 07.09.2011) has been summarized in the\n\nreport of the Committee as follows:\n\n (i) \nSection 498A\n, IPC, provisions of the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n 1961\n and the \nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act\n 2005\n have an element of commonality and need to be harmonized and\n uniformly implemented;\n (ii) Police should in the interest of the protection of the constitutional\n rights of a citizen ensure that no arrest should be made without a\n reasonable satisfaction after some investigation as to the\n genuineness and bonafide of a complaint and the need to effect\n arrest;\n (iii) Creation of Mahila Desks at police station and Crime Against\n Women (CAW) Cell, at least at the district level which would\n specifically deal the complaints made by women. When a wife\n moves to file a complaint to a women cell, a lot of persuasion and\n conciliation is required. The Legal Service Authorities of the States\n / UTs, National Commission for Women, NGO and social workers\n should set up a desk in CAW Cell to provide conciliation services to\n the women so that before the state machinery is set in motion the\n matter is amicably settled at that every stage;\n (iv) In case of matrimonial disputes, the first recourse should be\n effective conciliation and mediation between the warring spouses\n and their families and recourse of filing charges under \nSection\n 498A\n, IPC may be resorted to in cases where such conciliation fails\n and there appears a prima facie case of \nSection 498A\n of IPC and\n other related laws; and\n (v) Counseling mechanism envisaged under the PWDVA should be\n implemented by State Governments and counseling of parties\n should be done only by professionally qualified counselors and not\n by the police. The police may consider empanelling professional\n counselors with CAW Cells.\n\n 13\n 7. The Approach and views of the Commission broadly\n\n7.1 The Commission is of the view that the Section together with its allied\n\nCr.PC\n provisions shall not act as an instrument of oppression and counter-\n\nharassment and become a tool of indiscreet and arbitrary actions on the part of\n\nthe Police. The fact that s.498A deals with a family problem and a situation of\n\nmarital discord unlike the other crimes against society at large, cannot be\n\nforgotten. It does not however mean that the Police should not appreciate the\n\ngrievance of the complainant woman with empathy and understanding or that\n\nthe Police should play a passive role. S.498A has a lofty social purpose and it\n\nshould remain on the Statute book to intervene whenever the occasion arises.\n\nIts object and purpose cannot be stultified by overemphasizing its potentiality\n\nfor abuse or misuse. Misuse by itself cannot be a ground to repeal it or to take\n\naway its teeth wholesale. The re-evaluation of Section 498-A merely on the\n\nground of abuse is not warranted. Besides that, while courts are confronted\n\nwith abusive dimensions, sometimes very visibly in Section 498A prosecutions,\n\nwe cannot close our eyes to a large number of cases which go unprosecuted for\n\na variety of reasons.\n\n7.2 Section 498-A has to be seen in the context of violence and impairment\n\nof women's liberty and dignity within the matrimonial fold. Mindless and\n\nsenseless deprivation of life and liberty of women could not have been dealt\n\nwith effectively through soft sanctions alone. Even though values of equality\n\nand non-discrimination may have to gain deeper roots through other social\n\n 14\n measures, the need to give valuable protection to vulnerable sections of women\n\ncannot be negated.\n\n7.3 While the Commission is appreciative of the need to discourage\n\nunjustified and frivolous complaints and the scourge of over-implication, it is\n\nnot inclined to take a view that dilutes the efficacy of s.498A to the extent of\n\ndefeating its purpose especially having regard to the fact that atrocities against\n\nwomen are on the increase. A balanced and holistic view has to be taken on\n\nweighing the pros and cons. There is no doubt a need to address the misuse\n\nsituations and arrive at a rational solution - legislative or otherwise, while\n\nmaintaining the efficacy of law. While we acknowledge diverse points of view,\n\nsome with extreme emphasis and connotations, the point to be noted is that\n\nthe value to be attached to the rights of women are no less than the value to be\n\nattached to the family as a unit and vice-versa. The challenge before the\n\ncommunity is to ensure the promotion of both values. The emphasis should\n\ntherefore be on wise moderations without overlooking the need and relevance of\n\nthe retention of penal sanctions necessary to protect and promote women's\n\nrights and interests.\n\n7.4 There is also a need to create awareness of the provisions especially\n\namong the poor and illiterate living in rural areas who face quite often the\n\nproblems of drunken misbehavior and harassment of wives. More than the\n\nwomen, the men should be apprised of the penal and other provisions of law\n\nprotecting the women against harassment at home. The easy access of\n\naggrieved women to the Taluka and District level Legal Service Authorities\n\n 15\n and/or credible NGOs with professional counsellors should be ensured by\n\nappropriate measures. There should be an extensive and well-planned\n\ncampaign to spread awareness on right lines. Presently, the endeavour in this\n\ndirection is quite minimal. Visits to few villages once in a way by the\n\nrepresentatives of LSAs, law students and social workers is the present\n\nscenario.\n\n7.5 There is an all-round view that the lawyers whom the aggrieved women\n\nor their relations approach in the first instance should act with a clear sense of\n\nresponsibility and objectivity and give suitable advice consistent with the real\n\nproblem diagnosed. Exaggerated and tutored versions and unnecessary\n\nimplication of husband's relations should be scrupulously avoided. The correct\n\nadvice of legal professionals and the sensitivity of Police officials dealing with\n\nthe cases are very important, and if these are in place, undoubtedly, the law\n\nwill not take a devious course. Unfortunately, there is a strong feeling that\n\nsome lawyers and police personnel have failed to act and approach the problem\n\nin a manner ethically and legally expected of them.\n\n8. Compounding the Offence\n\n8.1 There is preponderance of opinion in favour of making the offence under\n\nS,498-A compoundable with the permission of the court. Even those\n\n(individuals, officials and organizations) who say that it should remain a non-\n\nbailable offence, have suggested that the offence should be made\n\ncompoundable, subject to the permission of court. Some States, for e.g.,\n\n 16\n Andhra Pradesh have already made it compoundable. The Supreme Court, in\n\nthe case of Ramgopal v. State of M. P. in SLP (Crl.) No. 6494 of 2010 (Order dt.\n\nJuly 30, 2010), observed that the offence under S, 498-A should be made\n\ncompoundable. However, there is sharp divergence of views on the point\n\nwhether it should be made a bailable offence. It is pleaded by some that the\n\noffence should be made bailable at least with regard to husband's relations and\n\nin respect of the cases failing under second part of the Explanation Clause (b)\n\nto Section 498-A.\n\n8.2 As regards compoundability, the Commission has given a comprehensive\n\nreport (237th Report) under the title of \"Compounding of \nIPC\n Offences\". The\n\nCommission recommended that the offence under Section 498A should be\n\nmade a compoundable offence with the permission of Court. The Commission\n\nhas suggested the inclusion of the following sub-section in S,320 \nCr.PC\n:\n\n After the application for compounding an offence under\n S.498A\n of\n Indian Penal Code is filed and on interviewing the aggrieved woman,\n preferably in the Chamber in the presence of a lady judicial officer or a\n representative of District Legal Services Authority or a counsellor or a close\n relation, if the Magistrate is satisfied that there was prima facie a\n voluntary and genuine settlement between the parties, the Magistrate shall\n make a record to that effect and the hearing of application shall be\n adjourned by three months or such other earlier date which the Magistrate\n may fix in the interests of Justice. On the adjourned date, the Magistrate\n shall again interview the victim woman in the like manner and then pass\n the final order permitting or refusing to compound the offence after giving\n opportunity of hearing to the accused. In the interregnum, it shall be open\n to the aggrieved woman to file an application revoking her earlier offer to\n compound the offence on sufficient grounds.\n\n The relevant part of Commission's report is furnished in Annexure-II.\n\n 17\n 8.4 In the 154th Report of the Law Commission also, there was a clear\n\nrecommendation to make the offence compoundable. Justice Mallimath\n\nCommittee on Criminal Justice Reform also recommended that it should be\n\nmade compoundable as well as bailable. The Committee of Petitions (Rajya\n\nSabha) in the report presented on 7.09.2011, observed thus at para 13.2 under\n\nthe heading \"Making the offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC compoundable\":\n\n \"The Committee notes that the offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC is\n essentially a fallout of strained matrimonial relationship for which there\n might be various considerations. Since there can be various causes\n leading to an offence under \nSection 498A\n, IPC and parties to the marriage\n could be responsible for the same in varying degrees, it would be\n appropriate if the remedy of compromise is kept open to settle a\n matrimonial dispute. In this context, the Committee feels that in case of\n any marital discord which has reached the stage of a complaint under\n \nSection 498A\n, IPC, it would be better if the parties have the option of a\n compromise whereafter they can settle down in their lives appropriately for\n a better future rather than diverting their energies negatively by pursuing\n litigation. The Committee recommends to the Government to consider\n whether the offence under \nSection 498A\n, IPC can be made compoundable.\"\n\n8.5 These observations and recommendations of the Parliamentary\n\nCommittee reinforces the view taken by the Law Commission in 237th Report\n\nwhich is annexed herewith (Annexure II). In the 111th report of the\n\nDepartment related Standing Committee on Home Affairs on the Criminal Law\n\nAmendment Bill, 2003 (report of 2005), the Committee categorically\n\nrecommended that the offence under Section 498-A should be made\n\ncompoundable. The Committee of Petitions (Rajya Sabha), recommended that\n\nthe offence under Section 498A should continue to be cognizable and non-\n\nbailable while \"strongly recommending\" that \"the ill-effects and miseries of the\n\nprovision should be checked.\" The Committee observed further: \"the Committee\n 18\n fears that failure to do so may leave no option except to dilute the law by making\n\nthe same non-compoundable and bailable.\" Certain measures to check misuse\n\nwere suggested which will be referred to at the appropriate juncture.\n\n9. \nDomestic Violence Act\n\n9.1 In the context of the issue under consideration, a reference to the\n\nprovisions of \nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n (for short\n\nPDV Act) which is an allied and complementary law, is quite apposite. The\n\nsaid Act was enacted with a view to provide for more effective protection of\n\nrights of women who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the\n\nfamily. Those rights are essentially of civil nature with a mix of penal\n\nprovisions. \nSection 3\n of the Act defines domestic violence in very wide terms. It\n\nencompasses the situations set out in the definition of 'cruelty' under Section\n\n498A. \nThe Act\n has devised an elaborate machinery to safeguard the interests of\n\nwomen subjected to domestic violence. \nThe Act\n enjoins the appointment of\n\nProtection Officers who will be under the control and supervision of a Judicial\n\nMagistrate of First Class. The said officer shall send a domestic incident report\n\nto the Magistrate, the police station and service providers. The Protection\n\nOfficers are required to effectively assist and guide the complainant victim and\n\nprovide shelter, medical facilities, legal aid etc. and also act on her behalf to\n\npresent an application to the Magistrate for one or more reliefs under the Act.\n\nThe Magistrate is required to hear the application ordinarily within 3 days from\n\nthe date of its receipt. The Magistrate may at any stage of the proceedings\n\ndirect the respondent and/or the aggrieved person to undergo counseling with\n\n 19\n a service provider. 'Service Providers' are those who conform to the\n\nrequirements of \nSection 10\n of the Act. The Magistrate can also secure the\n\nservices of a welfare expert preferably a woman for the purpose of assisting\n\nhim. Under \nSection 18\n, the Magistrate, after giving an opportunity of hearing to\n\nthe Respondent and on being prima facie satisfied that domestic violence has\n\ntaken place or is likely to take place, is empowered to pass a protection order\n\nprohibiting the Respondent from committing any act of domestic violence\n\nand/or aiding or abetting all acts of domestic violence. There are other powers\n\nvested in the Magistrate including granting residence orders and monetary\n\nreliefs. \nSection 23\n further empowers the Magistrate to pass such interim order\n\nas he deems just and proper including an ex-parte order. The breach of\n\nprotection order by the respondent is regarded as an offence which is\n\ncognizable and non-bailable and punishable with imprisonment extending to\n\none year (vide \nSection 31\n). By the same Section, the Magistrate is also\n\nempowered to frame charges under \nSection 498A\n of IPC and/or \nDowry\n\nProhibition Act\n. A Protection Officer who fails or neglects to discharge his duty\n\nas per the protection order is liable to be punished with imprisonment (vide\n\nSection 33\n). The provisions of the Act are supplemental to the provisions of any\n\nother law in force. The right to file a complaint under Section 498A is\n\nspecifically preserved under \nSection 5\n of the Act.\n\n9.2 An interplay of the provisions of this Act and the proceedings under\n\ns.498A assumes some relevance on two aspects: (1) Seeking Magistrate's\n\nexpeditious intervention by way of passing a protective interim order to prevent\n\n 20\n secondary victimization of a complainant who has lodged FIR under s.498A. (2)\n\nPaving the way for counseling process under the supervision of Magistrate at\n\nthe earliest opportunity.\n\n10. Responses - an overview\n\n10.1 As many as 474 persons, organizations/institutions and officials (listed\n\nin Annexure-III) have sent their responses to the Consultation Paper-cum-\n\nQuestionnaire. A broad analysis of these replies are given in Annexure III-A.\n\nSome of the important and typical responses are compiled in Annexure III-B.\n\nAs many as 244 Judicial Officers from various States including Registrars and\n\nDirectors of Judicial Academies and Officials (most of them are Police Officers)\n\nand members of legal academia have sent their responses. 100 of them\n\nsuggested that the offence should be made bailable. However, 119 of them have\n\nclearly stated that it should remain non-bailable. Among the 24\n\norganizations/institutions, 12 of them pleaded for bailability and 5 have\n\nexpressed the view that it should remain non-bailable. Among the individuals,\n\na vast majority of them suggested that it should be made bailable. Some have\n\nexpressed an extreme view that the Section should be repealed or it should be\n\nmade gender neutral. There are three Non-Resident Indians among the\n\nrepresentationists - two of them individuals and the other an organization.\n\nThey consider it as a harsh law against husbands and it shall be revisited.\n\nThe tales of woes and harassment caused on account of false complaints have\n\nbeen narrated in many representations while pleading that the complainant\n\nwoman should be made accountable for such false and frivolous complaints.\n\n 21\n Some State Governments and Union Territories also gave their suggestions.\n\nTheir views are compiled in Annexure III-C. Most of the respondents including\n\nthose who are not in favour of change emphasized the need for verification of\n\nfacts by way of preliminary/initial investigation and not to rush through the\n\nprocess of arrest. The need to facilitate reconciliation through counseling and\n\nmediation at the earliest stage has been stressed by a large number of\n\nrespondents. The active participation of Legal Service Authorities as a\n\nfacilitator of conciliation and mediation processes and the need for closer\n\ncoordination between the police and LSAs in this regard has also been pointed\n\nout by many of them. It is also stated that LSAs can play a greater role in\n\nspreading awareness in the rural areas.\n\n10.2 The Chairman of the Commission in the company of Vice-Chairman and\n\nother ld. Members and officials of the Commission had occasions to interact\n\nwith Judicial Officers of various ranks (including lady judges). In such\n\nConferences, the general consensus was that the offence under Section 498-A\n\nshould be made compoundable with the permission of the Court and it should\n\ncontinue to remain non-bailable. At the same time, they expressed some\n\nconcern over complaints filed with false allegations or over implication and\n\nstressed on the duty of Police to act with sensitivity and responsibility in\n\nmatters of this nature. So also, the plight of the aggrieved women who go to the\n\nPolice Stations and who in a state of emotion and confusion tend to file\n\ncomplaints with exaggerated versions has been highlighted. Senior Police\n\nOfficers in Delhi have stated that the percentage of misuse is minimal and\n\n 22\n most of the complaints are quite genuine though at times the complaints are\n\ninstigated to make some exaggerated and untrue allegations. They gave details\n\nof the practices that are being followed by Delhi Police especially in regard to\n\nconciliation by qualified counselors. They have also highlighted the problem\n\ncaused by NRI women filing dual complaints i.e., in Delhi under S, 498-A as\n\nwell as the relevant laws in force governing domestic violence in the country\n\nwhere they last resided with the accused husband. In regard to misuse\n\ndimensions, there were different versions from the Police Officers in some other\n\nStates. There was a divided opinion among the lawyers and judges (who\n\nattended the Conferences) at Visakhapatnam (A.P.), Chennai, Aurangabad and\n\nBengaluru on the question whether it should remain non-bailable. However,\n\nthe lawyers, both men and ladies in one voice stated that it should be made\n\ncompoundable and reconciliation process should be put in place without loss\n\nof time. The same was the opinion expressed at the conferences in Judicial\n\nAcademies in several States.\n\n11. Diagnosis of the problem and reasonable solution\n\n11.1 That Section 498A has been misused in many instances admits of no\n\ndoubt. This has been taken judicial notice of in several cases. The\n\nParliamentary Committee has also adverted to this aspect. The inputs received\n\nby the Law Commission and the representations made to the Home Ministry.\n\nalso confirm this fact. However, there is no reliable data to reveal the extent of\n\nabuse or misuse. The data/information reveals that urban and educated\n\n 23\n women are mostly coming forward to file the complaints under this section.\n\nThe data also reveals that in most of the cases, apart from the husband, two of\n\nhis relations (especially in-laws) are being prosecuted. At the same time, the\n\nCommission feels that misuse arising from exaggerated versions and over\n\nimplication should not by itself be a ground to dilute the provision by making\n\nit bailable. Depriving the police of the power to arrest without warrant in order\n\nto have proper investigation would defeat the objective of the provision and may\n\nbe counter-productive. The element of deterrence will be irretrievably lost, once\n\nit is made bailable. It is to be noted that the misuse did not flow from the\n\nsection itself but the roots of misuse were grounded on the insensitive police\n\nresponses and irresponsible legal advice. The victim/complainant deprived of\n\nher cool and objective thinking, quite often, unwittingly signs a complaint\n\ncontaining such exaggerated or partially false allegations. By the time she\n\nrealizes the implications thereof, it would be too late.\n\n11.2 In the Commission's view, the misuse could be minimized by taking\n\nsuch measures as would ensure the strict observance of the law governing\n\narrest as evolved in D.K. Basu's case and incorporated in the statute i.e., in\n\nChapter-V of Cr. P.C. The police at present either overact or adopt indifferent\n\nattitude in many a case. They are expected to act with due sensitivity and\n\nwith the realization that they are dealing with an alleged offence arising out of\n\nstrained matrimonial relations and that nothing should be done to disrupt the\n\nchances of reconciliation, or to cause trauma to the children. While launching\n\nof investigation - preliminary or otherwise, without delay is desirable, the\n\n 24\n arrest and such other drastic measures should not close the doors for\n\nreconciliation and amicable settlement. The Law Commission has already\n\nrecommended that the offence under Section 498-A should be made\n\ncompoundable. This is the minimum that could be done to promote the\n\nrestorative, not merely penal goal of the law. It may be noted that even under\n\nthe \nPrevention of Domestic Violence Act\n, a specific provision is enacted\n\nproviding for conciliation at the earliest on the intervention of Magistrate.\n\n12. Power of Arrest - a balanced approach\n\n12.1 Power of arrest vested with the Police Officer in a cognizable offence is no\n\ndoubt a potent weapon to enforce the penal provision. However, this weapon\n\nshould be sparingly drawn out of its sheath and wielded only if necessary. It\n\nshall not be used at the whim and fancy of the I.O. or be treated as a panacea\n\nfor checking such offences. The attitude to arrest first and then proceed with\n\nthe rest is despicable. Mechanical, casual and hasty application of the power\n\nof arrest is counter-productive and negates the fundamental right enshrined in\n\nArt. 21.\n Such attitude is at the root of misuse of S. 498A. The provisions in\n\nCr.PC\n regulating and channelizing the power of arrest should act as guiding\n\nstar to the police and their spirit and purpose should be foremost in their\n\nminds. Overreach is as bad as inaction. The need for caution in exercising the\n\ndrastic power of arrest in the context of cases u/s 498-A has been emphasized\n\ntime and again by the Courts and the parliamentary Committee. Similarly, the\n\nneed to keep the doors for reconciliation open and to restore the family ties if\n\n 25\n possible has also been highlighted in many judgments and even in statutory\n\nprovisions dealing with matrimonial disputes and domestic violence. Arbitrary\n\nand indiscriminate arrests are an anathema to the rule of law and values of\n\ncriminal justice. In the context of Section 498-A complaints, it tends to become\n\na handy tool to the police officers who lack sensitivity or act with oblique\n\nmotives. The objective of the provision is not better subserved by viewing\n\narrest as the most effective tool. Arrest pending investigation or thereafter\n\nshould never be viewed as a well deserved punitive measure and it should be\n\nexercised on an objective appraisal of the statutorily laid down conditions and\n\ncriteria.\n\n12.2 The value of proportionality permeates the newly introduced provisions\n\nrelating to arrest. If these provisions are scrupulously followed, the potential\n\nfor arbitrary action on the part of police is minimized. Needless to say that\n\nthe power of arrest is coupled with the duty to act reasonably. S. 498-A admits\n\nof various degrees of cruelty which can be broadly categorized as less serious\n\nand more serious. Uniformity of approach in exercising the power of arrest is\n\nbound to result in undue hardship and unintended results.\n\n12.3 It is apposite at this juncture to recall the following significant\n\nobservations made in Joginder Kumar's case: \"The horizon of human rights is\n\nexpanding. At the same time, the crime rate is also increasing. Of late, this Court\n\nhas been receiving complaints about violation of human rights because of\n\nindiscriminate arrests. How are we to strike a balance between the two? A\n\n 26\n realistic approach should be made in this direction. The law of arrest is one of\n\nbalancing individual rights, liberties and privileges, on the one hand, and\n\nindividual duties, obligations and responsibilities on the other; of weighing and\n\nbalancing the rights, liberties and privileges of the single individual and those of\n\nindividuals collectively; of simply deciding what is wanted and where to put the\n\nweight and the emphasis; of deciding which comes first the criminal or society,\n\nthe law violator or the law abider; of meeting the challenge which Mr. Justice\n\nCardozo so forthrightly met when he wrestled with a similar task of balancing\n\nindividual rights against society's rights\".\n\n12.4 The need to balance personal liberty with law enforcement has been\n\nstressed in Nandini Satpathy's case5 by quoting Lewis Mayers: The paradox has\n\nbeen put sharply by Lewis Mayers: \"To strike the balance between the needs of\n\nlaw enforcement on the one hand and the protection of the citizen from\n\noppression and injustice at the hands of the law-enforcement machinery on the\n\nother is a perennial problem of statecraft. The pendulum over the years has\n\nswung to the right\".\n\n13. Analysis of the provisions relating to arrest and the duty of police\n\n13.1 Now, let us analyse the provisions relating to arrest in Chapter-V and\n\nevolve some guidelines as to how the police is expected to act when a FIR\n\ndisclosing an offence u/s 498-A is received.\n\n5\n AIR 1978 SC\n\n 27\n 13.2 Section 41, Cr. P.C., as recast by Act 5 of 2009, lays down certain\n\nconditions and restrictions for arresting a person without an order from the\n\nMagistrate and without a warrant. There are three situations dealt with by\n\nSection 41. Clause (a) speaks of a person committing a cognizable offence in\n\nthe presence of a police officer. He can be arrested straight away. We are more\n\nconcerned with clauses (b) and (ba). Clause (ba) relates to power of arresting a\n\nperson against whom credible information has been received that he has\n\ncommitted a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which\n\nmay extend to more than seven years or with death sentence. Thus, the more\n\nserious cognizable offences are within the ambit of clause (ba). The conditions\n\nfor arrest without warrant as set out in clause (ba) are (i) receipt of credible\n\ninformation of cognizable offence; and (2) on the basis of such information, the\n\npolice officer 'has reason to believe' that the such person has committed the\n\noffence. The preceding clause (b) governs cognizable offences punishable with\n\nimprisonment for a term extending to seven years6. More stringent conditions\n\nfor arrest have been laid down in Cl.(b). A reasonable complaint' or 'a credible\n\ninformation' or 'a reasonable suspicion' that a person has committed a\n\ncognizable offence triggers the application of this part of section 41. In such a\n\ncase, the power of arrest is subject to two conditions which operate\n\ncumulatively. First the police officer should have 'reason to believe' on the\n\nbasis of such complaint, information, or suspicion that a person has\n\ncommitted the offence. Apart from the condition of formation of reasonable\n\n6\n The punishment prescribed by S,498A is imprisonment extending to three years and fine.\n\n 28\n belief on the basis of the complaint or information, the police officer has to be\n\nsatisfied further that the arrest is necessary for one or more of the purposes\n\nenvisaged by sub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (ii) of section 41(1)(b). For ready\n\nreference, the said sub-clause (ii) is extracted hereunder:-\n\n (ii) the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is necessary -\n\n (a) to prevent such person from committing any further offence; or\n (b) for proper investigation of the offence; or\n (c) to prevent such person from causing the evidence of the\n offence to disappear or tampering with such evidence in any\n manner; or\n (d) to prevent such person from making any inducement, threat\n or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case\n so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court\n or to the police officer; or\n (e) as unless such person is arrested, his presence in the court\n whenever required cannot be ensured,\n and the police officer shall record while making such arrest,\n his reasons in writing.\n\n These conditions are in the nature of mandatory prescriptions to be\n\nfollowed by the police officer before resorting to the drastic power of arrest. The\n\nconditions in other clauses of Section 41 are not relevant for our purpose and\n\nhence not discussed.\n\n13.3 When a suspect is arrested and produced before a Magistrate for\n\nextension of police custody, the Magistrate has to address the question whether\n\nspecific reasons have been recorded for arresting the person and if so, prima\n\nfacie, those reasons are relevant and secondly a reasonable conclusion could at\n\nall be reached by the police officer that one or the other conditions stated above\n\nare attracted. To this limited extent, there could be judicial scrutiny at that\n\nstage. If this scrutiny is there, the wrong committed by the police officer -\n\n 29\n intentionally or unwittingly, could be reversed at the earliest. In Section 498-A\n\ncases, it is not too easy to reach the satisfaction that one or more of the clauses\n\nin Section 41 are attracted. What could be achieved by custodial interrogation\n\ncould very well be achieved by interrogating the accused in the course of initial\n\nor preliminary investigation. The husband and other male relations can be\n\ncalled upon to appear before the I.O. on the specified date as laid down in\n\nSection 41-A. The I.O. cannot proceed on the assumption straightaway that\n\narrest is the best way to extract truth, especially in matrimonial offences. He\n\nmust always bear in mind that arrest is not the rule and it should be resorted\n\nto only on the satisfaction of the conditions statutorily prescribed. There are\n\nreports that many arrests in S. 498-A cases are made by police on extraneous\n\nconsiderations or without proper application of mind. At the same time, there\n\nare also reports that the complaints under section 498-A do not receive serious\n\nattention of police and the victim is always viewed with suspicion. Such police\n\ninaction too has to be disapproved.\n\n13.4 The Explanation to Section 498-A which defines cruelty is in two\n\nparts. Clause (a) of the Explanation deals with aggravated forms of cruelty\n\nwhich cause grave injury. Firstly, wilful conduct of such a grave nature as is\n\nlikely to drive the woman to commit suicide falls within the ambit of clause (a).\n\nThe second limb of clause (a) lays down that willful conduct which causes\n\ngrave injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of\n\nthe woman is to be regarded as 'cruelty'. Dowry related harassment is within\n\nclause (b) of the Explanation. When the FIR coupled with the statement of the\n\n 30\n victim woman discloses cruelty of grave nature falling within clause (a), the\n\npolice officer has to act swiftly and promptly especially if there is evidence of\n\nphysical violence. In the first instance, proper medical aid and the assistance\n\nof counselors shall be provided to the aggrieved woman and the process of\n\ninvestigation should start without any loss of time. The need for arresting the\n\nhusband may be more demanding in such a situation in a case of cruelty\n\nfalling under clause (b). We are adverting to this fact in order to make it clear\n\nthat our observations earlier do not mean that under no circumstances, the\n\npower of arrest shall be initially resorted to or that the I.O. should invariably\n\npostpone the arrest/custodial interrogation till the reconciliation process\n\ncomes to close. We would like to stress that the discretion has to be exercised\n\nreasonably having due regard to the facts of each case. Of course, the\n\nconditions subject to which the power of arrest has to be exercised should\n\nalways guide the discretion to be exercised by the police officer. While no hard\n\nand fast rule as to the exercise of power of arrest can be laid down, we would\n\nlike to point out that a balanced and sensitive approach should inform the\n\ndecision of the I.O. and he shall not be too anxious to exercise that power.\n\nThere must be good and substantial reasons for arriving at the satisfaction that\n\nimminent arrest is necessary having regard to the requirements of clause (ii) of\n\nSection 41(1)(b) of Cr. P.C. In this context, the Commission would like to stress\n\nthat the practice of mechanically reproducing in the case diary all or most of\n\nthe reasons contained in the said clause for effecting arrest should be\n\ndiscouraged and discontinued. The Head of Police department should issue\n\n 31\n necessary instructions in this regard which will serve as a safeguard against\n\narbitrary arrests in S,498-A cases.\n\n13.5 The investigating officers should remind themselves of the pertinent\n\nobservations made by the Supreme Court in Joginder Kumar vs. State of U.P.7.\n\nAfter referring to the 3rd report of National Police Commission, the Supreme\n\nCourt placed the law of arrest in a proper perspective by holding:\n\n \"The above guidelines are merely the incidents of personal liberty\n guaranteed under the Constitution of India. No arrest can be made\n because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The existence of the\n power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite\n another. The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his\n power to do so. Arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can\n cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. No\n arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of\n commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent for a\n police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a\n citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made\n without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to\n the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief\n both as to the person's complicity and even so as to the need to effect\n arrest. Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter. The\n recommendations of the Police Commission merely reflect the constitutional\n concomitants of the fundamental right to personal liberty and freedom. A\n person is not liable to arrest merely on the suspicion of complicity in an\n offence. There must be some reasonable justification in the opinion of the\n officer effecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and justified.\n Except in heinous offences, an arrest must be avoided if a police officer\n issues notice to person to attend the Station House and not to leave the\n Station without permission would do. Then, there is the right to have\n someone informed. That right of the arrested person, upon request, to have\n someone informed and to consult privately with a lawyer was recognised\n by Section 56(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984 in England\".\n\n13.6 In Siddaram Satlingappa vs. State of Maharashtra8, it was observed:\n\n7\n AIR 1994 SC 1349; (1994) 4 SCC 260\n8\n AIR 2011 SC 312 (Para 123)\n\n 32\n \"The arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to\n those exceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative in the\n facts and circumstances of that case\".\n\n14. Certain guidelines / prescriptions to mitigate misuse\n\n14.1 Certain Dos and Don'ts to the police personnel by the Head of the police\n\ndept. in order to inculcate the sense of responsibility and sensitivity is the need\n\nof the hour. The abuse of the provision by resorting to the power of arrest\n\nindiscriminately should be checked at all cost. The following\n\nprescriptions/guidelines shall be kept in view by the I.Os and be incorporated\n\nin the Circular to be issued by the Head of Police Department.\n\n14.2 The FIR has to be registered as per law if it discloses an offence and the\n\nPolice Officer has reason to suspect the commission of offence (as laid down in\n\nSection 157). However, on the point of registration of FIR, the police officials\n\nhave to necessarily follow the decisions/directives of High Court on the point.\n\n14.3 On receiving the FIR, the police officer should cross-check with the\n\ncomplainant the correctness of the contents and whether she voluntarily made\n\nall the allegations. For this purpose, she may be interviewed/questioned\n\npreferably in the presence of a lady official or a respectable lady or a Counsellor\n\nattached to a reputed NGO.\n\n14.4 Then, without delay, the police officer must initiate the process of initial\n\ninvestigation by visiting the house of the husband and have a first hand\n\naccount of the version of husband and other relations and take such measures\n\nas may be necessary to ensure that the accused do not indulge in acts\n\n 33\n calculated to endanger the safety and liberty of the complainant. Both sides\n\nshould be counseled not to precipitate the situation. Thereafter, steps should\n\nbe taken to refer the matter to the Mediation Centre if any or District Legal aid\n\nCentre or a team of Counselors/conciliators if any attached to the Police\n\nDistrict. In the absence of professional counsellors, the SP of the District or the\n\nDCP can form a team or panel of mediators/counselors. It may consist of IAS\n\nor other Civil Service Officers (preferably lady officers) and lady IPS Officers\n\n(unconnected to the case) or respected members of media, legal or other\n\nprofessions. If the parties choose to have specified persons as\n\nmediators/conciliators, they must be referred to such persons. The police may\n\nobtain the report of mediators or conciliators within a maximum period of\n\nthirty days and then, depending on the outcome, they may proceed further in\n\nthe matter. If the situation demands, investigation shall be completed and at\n\nthat stage, if custodial interrogation is found necessary for the relevant reasons\n\nto be recorded in writing, the husband and others can be arrested on taking\n\nthe permission of DCP/SP level officer. Then I.O. shall also take such action as\n\nis necessary to restore the valuable belongings of the complainant woman.\n\n These rules or guidelines if followed would prevent misuse while fostering\n\na valued based approach.\n\n14.5 In the case of Non-Resident Indians, it is reported that the passports are\n\nseized when they come to India at the stage of investigation or they are sent to\n\nthe Passport Officer for passing an order of impounding. During the pendency\n\n 34\n of the case in the Court, the prosecutor often requests the Court to direct\n\ndepositing of the passport as a condition for granting bail. This should not be\n\ndone in all cases mechanically as it will cause irreversible damage to the\n\nhusband/accused and he will be exposed to the risk of losing the job and the\n\nvisa being terminated. Ultimately, there may be amicable settlement and/ or\n\nquashing of proceedings or acquittal/discharge but the damage has already\n\nbeen done. The prospect of the accused remaining unemployed would not be in\n\nthe interests of both as the loss of earnings will have a bearing on the\n\nmaintenance claims of the wife, apart from depriving him of the means of\n\nlivelihood. The proper course would be to take bonds and sureties for heavy\n\namounts and the prosecution taking necessary steps to expeditiously complete\n\nthe trial. This aspect should also be brought to the notice of concerned police\n\nofficers by means of circulars issued by the DGPs.\n\n15. Home Ministry's advisory and further action to be taken\n\n15.1 In the Commission's view, the approach of Ministry of Home Affairs in\n\nthe Advisory issued by it in No.3/5/2008-Judl.Cell dt. 20th October, 2009 is\n\nthe correct approach and the instructions issued therein need to be reiterated\n\nafter convening a conference of DGPs of every State so that follow up circulars\n\nwill be issued by them for guidance of police officials within their jurisdiction.\n\nThis is what the Home Ministry said in the said Circular:\n\n \"To comply with the procedure as laid down In D.K. Basu's case, the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in its judgement dated 18.12.96 in CRL CWP\n No.539/86 - DK Basu vs. State of West Bengal has stated that the power\n\n 35\n of arrest without warrant should be exercised only after a reasonable\n satisfaction is reached, after some investigation as to the genuinness and\n bonafides of a complaint and a reasonable belief as to both the person's\n complicity as well as the need to effect arrest. Therefore, in any\n matrimonial dispute, it may not necessary in all cases to immediately\n exercise the powers of arrest. Recourse may be initially taken to dispute\n settlement mechanism such as conciliation, mediation, counseling of the\n parties etc.\"\n\n15.2 The views of the National Commission for Women (extracted in 140th\n\nReport of the Rajya Sabha Committee on Petitions) substantially accords with\n\nthe instructions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in the advisory issued\n\nby it.\n\n15.3 We have indicated earlier what the police is expected to do (vide paras 13\n\nsupra). These aspects should also form the subject matter of the\n\nCircular/Standing order to be issued by the DGPs/Police Commissoners\n\nfor the guidance of the police personnel. A mechanism to monitor the\n\nobservance of the guidelines/instructions should be put in place. Regular and\n\ndedicated supervision by high level officers would go a long way in ensuring\n\nenforcement of this provision on right lines.\n\n15.4 In some States, as noticed earlier, there are directives of the High Courts\n\nas to how the police should handle the complaints under Section 498-A. Based\n\non these directives, it is noticed that certain instructions have already been\n\nissued by the DGPs. It is needless to state that the High Court's directives are\n\nbinding and a fresh circular cannot be issued by the DGP superseding the\n\ninstructions based on the High Court's judgment. In such a situation, the\n\nproper course would be to apprise the High Court of the decision taken at the\n\n 36\n conference of DGPs and to request the High Court to modify the directions\n\nappropriately in the light of the decision taken so that there will be uniformity\n\nin approach all over the country.\n\n16. Amendment of \nSection 41\n Cr.PC by the addition of sub-section (3)\n\n16.1 At the same time, in the interest of uniformity and certainty, it is\n\ndesirable that the essential guidelines are placed within legislative framework,\n\nto the extent necessary. We therefore suggest that sub-section (3) may be\n\nadded to \nSection 41\n of Cr.PC on the following lines:\n\n (3): Where information of the nature specified in clause(b) of sub-\n section(1) of Section 41 has been received regarding the commission of\n offence under \nsection 498-A\n of Indian Penal Code, before the police officer\n resorts to the power of arrest, shall set in motion the steps for\n reconciliation between the parties and await its outcome for a period of 30\n days, unless the facts disclose that an aggravated form of cruelty falling\n under clause (a) of Explanation to S, 498-A has been committed and the\n arrest of the accused in such a case is necessary for one of the reasons\n specified in clause (b) of Section 41.\n\n16.2 We would like to add that this proposed sub-section is not something\n\nmaterially different from the existing law and perhaps its utility lies in making\n\nexplicit what is really implicit in light of the peculiar problems related to\n\nenforcement of S, 498-A. It is a procedural amendment which may act against\n\ninappropriate use of provision while at the same time not diluting the\n\nimportance of life and liberty protection to women.\n\n 37\n 17. S, 358 of \nCr.PC\n - raising the compensation limit\n\n17.1 Another legislative change which the Commission recommends to\n\ndiscourage false and frivolous complaints leading to the arrest and\n\nprosecution of the suspect/accused is to amend \nSection 358\n of Cr.PC so as to\n\nraise the compensation from rupees one thousand to rupees fifteen thousand.\n\nThe words \"not exceeding one thousand rupees\" shall be substituted by the\n\nwords \"not exceeding fifteen thousand rupees\". This amendment is necessary\n\nto check to some extent the false and irresponsible FIRs/complaints in\n\ngeneral, not merely confined to S, 498A. This is without prejudice to the\n\nProvision in \nIPC\n (Section 211) under which falsely charging a person of an\n\noffence is punishable.\n\n17-A. Punishment for misuse - no specific provision necessary\n\n The suggestion of some respondents (in some Articles also, such a\n\nsuggestion was made) that there must be a specific provision to punish women\n\nwho file complaints for extraneous reasons is rather misconceived. There is\n\nno reason why only for S,498A cases, such a special provision shall be made.\n\nIn any case, the existing provisions, viz. S,182, 211 of \nIPC\n and S,250 of \nCr.PC\n\ncan take care of malicious accusations etc, apart from \nSection 358\n Cr.PC.\n\n18. State's obligation to take care of estranged women in distress\n\n One more important aspect on which attention should be bestowed by\n\nthe states and Union Territories is providing necessary aid and assistance to\n\n 38\n the hapless women who having gone to the Police Station with a genuine\n\ngrievance and in a state of distress do not venture to go back to marital home\n\nor even unable to stay with relatives. Either they do not have parents who can\n\ntake care of or maintain them during the period of trauma or there is\n\nreluctance on the part of even close relations to allow her to stay with them\n\nwithout hassles. The process of reconciliation and compromise may take\n\nsome time and there is no knowing what will be its outcome. Further, the\n\nvictim woman in distress would need immediate solace in the form of medical\n\nassistance and a temporary abode to stay, apart from proper counseling. In\n\nthe circumstances in which she is placed, only the State or its\n\ninstrumentalities can take care of her immediate needs. At present, even in\n\ncities, there are no Hostels and Shelter Homes worth mentioning which are\n\ncatering to the welfare of victimized women. Even if there are a few, no proper\n\nfacilities are in place. There are no Crisis Centres attached to Women Police\n\nStations even in major cities (excepting few) which can immediately provide\n\nsuccour and relief to the women in distress. The Commission would therefore\n\nlike to emphasize the obvious that every Government should treat it as a\n\nparamount obligation on their part to cater to the immediate needs of\n\nvictimized women leaving the matrimonial home and not in a position to stay\n\nwith their relatives for various reasons. The women who are worst hit if\n\nassistance is not provided are those from the poor and middle class\n\nbackground. The States should consider this problem on a priority basis and\n\n 39\n initiate necessary steps to alleviate the suffering of women in need of help as a\n\npart of the welfare goal ingrained in our Constitution.\n\n19. Summary of Recommendations\n\n19.1 Misuse of Section 498-A in many cases has been judicially noticed by the\n\napex court as well as various High Courts. This has also been taken note of by\n\nParliamentary Committee on Petitions (Rajya Sabha). However, misuse (the\n\nextent of which is not established by any empirical study) by itself is not a\n\nground to abolish S,498-A or to denude the Section of its teeth. The social\n\nobjective behind the Section and the need for deterrence should be kept in view\n\nwhile at the same time ensuring that the complaints filed with false or\n\nexaggerated allegations out of ulterior motives or in a fit of emotion should be\n\ncurbed.\n\n19.2 The need to spread awareness of the provision and available remedies\n\nespecially in rural areas both among women and men is necessary and in this\n\nregard the District and Taluka Legal Services Authorities, the media, the NGOs\n\nand law students can play a meaningful role.\n\n19.3 All endeavours shall be made for effecting reconciliation at the earliest\n\nwith the help of professional counsellors, mediation and legal aid centres,\n\nretired officials/medical and legal professionals or friends and relations in\n\nwhom the parties have faith. An action plan has to be drawn up for forming\n\nthe panels in every district as well as extending necessary help to he aggrieved\n\nwomen. The I.O. should refrain from participating in the conciliation process.\n\n 40\n 19.4 The law on the question whether registration of FIR could be postponed\n\nfor a reasonable time is in a state of uncertainty. Some High Courts have been\n\ndirecting that FIR shall not be registered under S, 498A (except in cases of\n\nvisible violence, and the like) till the preliminary investigation is done and\n\nreconciliation process is completed. The issue has been referred to a larger\n\nBench of Supreme Court recently. In this regard, the police has to follow the\n\nlaw laid down by the jurisdictional High Court until the Supreme Court decides\n\nthe matter.\n\n19.5 The offence under S, 498-A shall be made compoundable, with the\n\npermission of Court and subject to cooling off period of 3 months, as already\n\nrecommended by this Commission in 237thReport. The preponderance of view\n\nis to make it compoundable.\n\n19.6 The offence should remain non-bailable. However, the safeguard against\n\narbitrary and unwarranted arrests lies in strictly observing the letter and spirit\n\nof the conditions laid down in Sections 41 and 41-A of Cr. PC relating to power\n\nof arrest and sensitizing the Police on the modalities to be observed in cases of\n\nthis nature. The need for custodial interrogation should be carefully assessed.\n\nOver-reaction and inaction are equally wrong. Police should take necessary\n\nsteps to ensure safety of the complainant and to prevent further acts of\n\nharassment.\n\n19.7 The Home Ministry's Advisory dated 20th October 2009 on the subject of\n\n\"Misuse of \nSection 498-A\n of IPC\" as well as the guidelines / additional\n\nprecautions set out in para 14 of this Report should be compiled and at a\n\n 41\n conference of DGPs specially convened for this purpose by the Home Secretary,\n\nthey must be apprised of the need to follow the said principles and guidelines\n\nand to issue circulars / standing orders accordingly. There should be a\n\nmonitoring mechanism in the police Dept. to keep track of S, 498A cases and\n\nthe observance of guidelines.\n\n19.8 Without prejudice to the above suggestions, it has been recommended\n\nthat as set out in para 16 above, sub-section (3) shall be added to Section 41\n\nCr. PC to prevent arbitrary and unnecessary arrests. The legislative mandate\n\nwhich is not materially different from the spirit underlying Sections 41 and 157\n\nCr. PC should be put in place in the interests of uniformity and clarity.\n\n19.9 The compensation amount in Section 358 of Cr. PC shall be increased\n\nfrom one thousand rupees to fifteen thousand rupees and this proposed\n\nchange is not merely confined to the Section under consideration.\n\n19.10 The women police stations (under the nomenclature of Crimes Against\n\nWomen Cell) should be strengthened both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nWell trained and educated lady police officers of the rank of Inspector or above\n\nshall head such police stations. CWCs should be established in every district\n\nwith adequate trained personnel. Panels of competent professional counsellors\n\nand respected elders / professionals who can counsel and conciliate should be\n\nmaintained by SP/SSP for every district. There shall be separate room in the\n\npolice stations for women complainants and the accused women in S, 498-A\n\nrelated cases.\n\n 42\n 19.11 Hostels or shelter homes for the benefit of women who would not like to\n\ngo back to marital homes should be maintained in cities and District\n\nheadquarters with necessary facilities. The assistance given to them shall be\n\ntreated as a part of social welfare measure which is an obligation of the welfare\n\nState.\n\n19.12 The passport of non-resident Indians involved in Section 498-A cases\n\nshould not be impounded mechanically and instead of that, bonds and sureties\n\nfor heavy amounts can be insisted upon.\n\n19.13 Above all, the need for expeditious disposal of cases under section 498A\n\nshould be given special attention by the prosecution and Judiciary.\n\n [Justice (Retd.) P. V. Reddi]\n Chairman\n\n [Justice (Retd.) Shiv Kumar Sharma] [Amarjit Singh]\n Member Member\n\nNew Delhi\n29 August 2012\n\n 43\n Annexure - I\n [refer para 1.1of the Report]\n\n LAW COMMISSION OF INDIA\n\n Consultation Paper-cum-Questionnaire regarding \nSection 498-A\n\n of Indian Penal Code\n\n1. Keeping in view the representations received from various quarters\nand observations made by the Supreme Court and the High Courts, the\nHome Ministry of the Government of India requested the Law\nCommission of India to consider whether any amendments to\n s.498A\n of\nIndian Penal Code or other measures are necessary to check the alleged\nmisuse of the said provision especially by way of over-implication.\n2. S.498A was introduced in the year 1983 to protect married women\nfrom being subjected to cruelty by the husband or his relatives. A\npunishment extending to 3 years and fine has been prescribed. The\nexpression 'cruelty' has been defined in wide terms so as to include\ninflicting physical or mental harm to the body or health of the woman\nand indulging in acts of harassment with a view to coerce her or her\nrelations to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity. Harassment for dowry falls within the sweep of latter limb of\nthe section. Creating a situation driving the woman to commit suicide is\nalso one of the ingredients of 'cruelty'. The offence under s.498A is\ncognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable.\n3. In a recent case of Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand, the\nSupreme Court observed that a serious relook of the provision is\nwarranted by the Legislature. \"It is a matter of common knowledge that\nexaggerated versions of the incidents are reflected in a large number of\ncomplaints. The tendency of over-implication is also reflected in a very\nlarge number of cases\". The Court took note of the common tendency\nto implicate husband and all his immediate relations. In an earlier case\nalso - Sushil Kumar Sharma v. UOI (2005), the Supreme Court lamented\nthat in many instances, complaints under s.498A were being filed with\nan oblique motive to wreck personal vendetta. \"It may therefore become\nnecessary for the Legislature to find out ways how the makers of\nfrivolous complaints or allegations can be appropriately dealt with\", it\nwas observed. It was also observed that \"by misuse of the provision, a\nnew legal terrorism can be unleashed\".\n4. The factum of over-implication is borne out by the statistical data\nof the cases under s.498A. Such implication of the relatives of husband\nwas found to be unjustified in a large number of decided cases. While\nso, it appears that the women especially from the poor strata of the\nsociety living in rural areas rarely take resort to the provision.\n5. The conviction rate in respect of the cases under s.498A is quite\nlow. It is learnt that on account of subsequent events such as amicable\n 44\n settlement, the complainant women do not evince interest in taking the\nprosecution to its logical conclusion.\n6. The arguments for relieving the rigour of s.498A by suitable\namendments (which find support from the observations in the Court\njudgments and Justice Malimath Committee's report on Reforms of\nCriminal Justice System) are: Once a complaint (FIR) is lodged with the\nPolice under\n s.498A\n/\n406\n IPC, it becomes an easy tool in the hands of the\nPolice to arrest or threaten to arrest the husband and other relatives\nnamed in the FIR without even considering the intrinsic worth of the\nallegations and making a preliminary investigation. When the members\nof a family are arrested and sent to jail without even the immediate\nprospect of bail, the chances of amicable re-conciliation or salvaging the\nmarriage, will be lost once and for all. The possibility of reconciliation, it\nis pointed out, cannot be ruled out and it should be fully explored. The\nimminent arrest by the Police will thus be counter-productive. The long\nand protracted criminal trials lead to acrimony and bitterness in the\nrelationship among the kith and kin of the family. Pragmatic realities\nhave to be taken into consideration while dealing with matrimonial\nmatters with due regard to the fact that it is a sensitive family problem\nwhich shall not be allowed to be aggravated by over-zealous/callous\nactions on the part of the Police by taking advantage of the harsh\nprovisions of\n s.498A\n of IPC together with its related provisions in \nCrPC\n.\nIt is pointed out that the sting is not in s.498A as such, but in the\nprovisions of \nCrPC\n making the offence non-compoundable and non-\nbailable.\n7. The arguments, on the other hand, in support of maintaining the\nstatus quo are briefly:\n S.498A and other legislations like \nProtection of Women from\n Domestic Violence Act\n have been specifically enacted to protect a\n vulnerable section of the society who have been the victims of\n cruelty and harassment. The social purpose behind it will be lost if\n the rigour of the provision is diluted. The abuse or misuse of law\n is not peculiar to this provision. The misuse can however be\n curtailed within the existing framework of law. For instance, the\n Ministry of Home Affairs can issue 'advisories' to State\n Governments to avoid unnecessary arrests and to strictly observe\n the procedures laid down in the law governing arrests. The power\n to arrest should only be exercised after a reasonable satisfaction is\n reached as to the bona fides of a complaint and the complicity of\n those against whom accusations are made. Further, the first\n recourse should be to effect conciliation and mediation between the\n warring spouses and the recourse to filing of a chargesheet under\n s.498A shall be had only in cases where such efforts fail and there\n appears to be a prima facie case. Counselling of parties should be\n done by professionally qualified counsellors and not by the Police.\n\n 45\n 7.1 These views have been echoed among others by the Ministry of\nWomen and Child Development.\n7.2 Further, it is pointed out that a married woman ventures to go to\nthe Police station to make a complaint against her husband and other\nclose relations only out of despair and being left with no other remedy\nagainst cruelty and harassment. In such a situation, the existing law\nshould be allowed to take its own course rather than over-reacting to the\nmisuse in some cases.\n7.3 There is also a view expressed that when once the offending family\nmembers get the scent of the complaint, there may be further torture of\nthe complainant and her life and liberty may be endangered if the Police\ndo not act swiftly and sternly. It is contended that in the wake of ever\nincreasing crimes leading to unnatural deaths of women in marital\nhomes, any dilution of Section 498-A is not warranted. Secondly, during\nthe long-drawn process of mediation also, she is vulnerable to threats\nand torture. Such situations too need to be taken care of.\n8. There is preponderance of opinion in favour of making the said\noffence compoundable with the permission of the court. Some States,\nfor e.g., Andhra Pradesh have already made it compoundable. The\nSupreme Court, in a recent case of --*---, observed that it should be\nmade compoundable. However, there is sharp divergence of views on the\npoint whether it should be made a bailable offence. It is pleaded by some\nthat the offence under s.498A should be made bailable at least with\nregard to husband's relations.*Ramgopal v. State of M. P. in SLP (Crl.)\nNo. 6494 of 2010 (Order dt. July 30, 2010.\n8.1 Those against compoundability contend that the women especially\nfrom the rural areas will be pressurized to enter into an unfair\ncompromise and further the deterrent effect of the provision will be lost.\n9. The Commission is of the view that the Section together with its\nallied \nCrPC\n provisions shall not act as an instrument of oppression and\ncounter-harassment and become a tool of indiscreet and arbitrary\nactions on the part of the Police. The fact that s.498A deals with a family\nproblem and a situation of marital discord unlike the other crimes\nagainst society at large, cannot be forgotten. It does not however mean\nthat the Police should not appreciate the grievance of the complainant\nwoman with empathy and understanding or that the Police should play a\npassive role.\n10. S.498A has a lofty social purpose and it should remain on the\nStatute book to intervene whenever the occasion arises. Its object and\npurpose cannot be stultified by overemphasizing its potentiality for abuse\nor misuse. Misuse by itself cannot be a ground to repeal it or to take\naway its teeth wholesale.\n11. While the Commission is appreciative of the need to discourage\nunjustified and frivolous complaints and the scourge of over-implication,\nit is not inclined to take a view that dilutes the efficacy of s.498A to the\nextent of defeating its purpose especially having regard to the fact that\n 46\n atrocities against women are on the increase. A balanced and holistic\nview has to be taken on weighing the pros and cons. There is no doubt a\nneed to address the misuse situations and arrive at a rational solution -\nlegislative or otherwise.\n12. There is also a need to create awareness of the provisions\nespecially among the poor and illiterate living in rural areas who face\nquite often the problems of drunken misbehavior and harassment of\nwomen folk. More than the women, the men should be apprised of the\npenal provisions of law protecting the women against harassment at\nhome. The easy access of aggrieved women to the Taluka and District\nlevel Legal Service Authorities and/or credible NGOs with professional\ncounsellors should be ensured by appropriate measures. There should\nbe an extensive and well-planned campaign to spread awareness.\nPresently, the endeavour in this direction is quite minimal. Visits to few\nvillages once in a way by the representatives of LSAs, law students and\nsocial workers is the present scenario.\n13. There is an all-round view that the lawyers whom the aggrieved\nwomen or their relations approach in the first instance should act with a\nclear sense of responsibility and objectivity and give suitable advice\nconsistent with the real problem diagnosed. Exaggerated and tutored\nversions and unnecessary implication of husband's relations should be\nscrupulously avoided. The correct advice of the legal professionals and\nthe sensitivity of the Police officials dealing with the cases are very\nimportant, and if these are in place, undoubtedly, the law will not take a\ndevious course. Unfortunately, there is a strong feeling that some\nlawyers and police personnel have failed to act and approach the\nproblem in a manner morally and legally expected of them.\n14. Thus, the triple problems that have cropped up in the course of\nimplementation of the provision are:(a) the police straightaway rushing to\narrest the husband and even his other family members (named in the\nFIR), (b) tendency to implicate, with little or no justification, the in-laws\nand other relations residing in the marital home and even outside the\nhome, overtaken by feelings of emotion and vengeance or on account of\nwrong advice, and (c) lack of professional, sensitive and empathetic\napproach on the part of the police to the problem of woman under\ndistress.\n15. In the context of the issue under consideration, a reference to the\nprovisions of \nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n (for\nshort PDV Act) which is an allied and complementary law, is quite\napposite. The said Act was enacted with a view to provide for more\neffective protection of rights of women who are victims of violence of any\nkind occurring within the family. Those rights are essentially of civil\nnature with a mix of penal provisions. \nSection 3\n of the Act defines\ndomestic violence in very wide terms. It encompasses the situations set\nout in the definition of 'cruelty' under Section 498A. \nThe Act\n has devised\nan elaborate machinery to safeguard the interests of women subjected to\n 47\n domestic violence. \nThe Act\n enjoins the appointment of Protection\nOfficers who will be under the control and supervision of a Judicial\nMagistrate of First Class. The said officer shall send a domestic incident\nreport to the Magistrate, the police station and service providers. The\nProtections Officers are required to effectively assist and guide the\ncomplainant victim and provide shelter, medical facilities, legal aid etc.\nand also act on her behalf to present an application to the Magistrate for\none or more reliefs under the Act. The Magistrate is required to hear the\napplication ordinarily within 3 days from the date of its receipt. The\nMagistrate may at any stage of the proceedings direct the respondent\nand/or the aggrieved person to undergo counseling with a service\nprovider. 'Service Providers' are those who conform to the requirements\nof \nSection 10\n of the Act. The Magistrate can also secure the services of a\nwelfare expert preferably a woman for the purpose of assisting him.\nUnder \nSection 18\n, the Magistrate, after giving an opportunity of hearing\nto the Respondent and on being prima facie satisfied that domestic\nviolence has taken place or is likely to take place, is empowered to pass a\nprotection order prohibiting the Respondent from committing any act of\ndomestic violence and/or aiding or abetting all acts of domestic violence.\nThere are other powers vested in the Magistrate including granting\nresidence orders and monetary reliefs. \nSection 23\n further empowers\nthe Magistrate to pass such interim order as he deems just and proper\nincluding an ex-parte order. The breach of protection order by the\nrespondent is regarded as an offence which is cognizable and non-\nbailable and punishable with imprisonment extending to one year (vide\n\nSection 31\n). By the same Section, the Magistrate is also empowered to\nframe charges under \nSection 498A\n of IPC and/or \nDowry Prohibition Act\n.\nA Protection Officer who fails or neglects to discharge his duty as per the\nprotection order is liable to be punished with imprisonment (vide \nSection\n33\n). The provisions of the Act are supplemental to the provisions of any\nother law in force. A right to file a complaint under Section 498A is\nspecifically preserved under \nSection 5\n of the Act.\n15.1 An interplay of the provisions of this Act and the proceedings\nunder s.498A assumes some relevance on two aspects: (1) Seeking\nMagistrate's expeditious intervention by way of passing a protective\ninterim order to prevent secondary victimization of a complainant who\nhas lodged FIR under s.498A. (2) Paving the way for the process of\ncounselling under the supervision of Magistrate at the earliest\nopportunity.\n16. With the above analysis and the broad outline of the approach\nindicated supra, the Commission invites the views of the\npublic/NGOs/institutions/Bar Associations etc. on the following points,\nbefore preparing and forwarding to the Government the final report:\n\n 48\n Questionnaire\n 1) a) What according to you is ideally expected of Police, on receiving the\n FIR alleging an offence\n u/s 498A\n of IPC? What should be their\n approach and plan of action?\n b) Do you think that justice will be better meted out to the aggrieved\n woman by the immediate arrest and custodial interrogation of the\n husband and his relations named in the FIR? Would the objective of\n s.498A be better served thereby?\n 2) a) The Supreme Court laid down in D.K. Basu (1996) and other cases\n that the power of arrest without warrant ought not to be resorted to in\n a routine manner and that the Police officer should be reasonably\n satisfied about a person's complicity as well as the need to effect\n arrest. Don't you agree that this rule applies with greater force in a\n situation of matrimonial discord and the police are expected to act\n more discreetly and cautiously before taking the drastic step of\n arrest?\n b) What steps should be taken to check indiscriminate and\n unwarranted arrests?\n 3) Do you think that making the offence bailable is the proper solution\n to the problem? Will it be counter-productive?\n 4) There is a view point supported by certain observations in the courts'\n judgments that before effecting arrest in cases of this nature, the\n proper course would be to try the process of reconciliation by\n counselling both sides. In other words, the possibility of exploring\n reconciliation at the outset should precede punitive measures. Do\n you agree that the conciliation should be the first step, having regard\n to the nature and dimension of the problem? If so, how best the\n conciliation process could be completed with utmost expedition?\n Should there be a time-limit beyond which the police shall be free\n to act without waiting for the outcome of conciliation process?\n 5) Though the Police may tender appropriate advice initially and\n facilitate reconciliation process, the preponderance of view is that the\n Police should not get involved in the actual process and their role\n should be that of observer at that stage? Do you have a different\n view?\n 6) a) In the absence of consensus as to mediators, who will be ideally\n suited to act as mediators/conciliators - the friends or elders known\n to both the parties or professional counsellors (who may be part of\n NGOs), lady and men lawyers who volunteer to act in such matters, a\n Committee of respected/retired persons of the locality or the Legal\n Services Authority of the District?\n b) How to ensure that the officers in charge of police stations can\n easily identify and contact those who are well suited to conciliate or\n mediate, especially having regard to the fact that professional and\n competent counsellors may not be available at all places and any\n delay in initiating the process will lead to further complications?\n 49\n 7) a) Do you think that on receipt of complaint under S.498A,\nimmediate steps should be taken by the Police to facilitate an\napplication being filed before the Judicial Magistrate under the PDV\nAct so that the Magistrate can set in motion the process of\ncounselling/conciliation, apart from according interim protection?\nb) Should the Police in the meanwhile be left free to arrest the\naccused without the permission of the Magistrate?\nc) Should the investigation be kept in abeyance till the conciliation\nprocess initiated by the Magistrate is completed?\n\n8) Do you think that the offence should be made compoundable (with\n the permission of court)?\n Are there any particular reasons not to make it compoundable?\n9) Do you consider it just and proper to differentiate the husband\n from the other accused in providing for bail?\n10) a) Do you envisage a better and more extensive role to be\n played by Legal Services Authorities (LSAs) at Taluka and District\n levels in relation to s.498A cases and for facilitating amicable\n settlement? Is there a need for better coordination between LSAs\n and police stations?\n b) Do you think that aggrieved women have easy access to LSAs at\n the grassroot level and get proper guidance and help from them at\n the pre-complaint and subsequent stages?\n c)Are the Mediation Centres in some States well equipped and\n better suited to attend to the cases related to S,498-A?\n11) What measures do you suggest to spread awareness of the\n protective penal provisions and civil rights available to women in\n rural areas especially among the poorer sections of people?\n12) Do you have any informations about the number of and\n conditions in shelter homes which are required to be set up under\n PDV Act to help the aggrieved women who after lodging the\n complaint do not wish to stay at marital home or there is none to\n look after them?\n13) What according to you is the main reason for low conviction\n rate in the prosecutions u/s 498A?\n14) (a) Is it desirable to have a Crime Against Women Cell (CWC)\n in every district to deal exclusively with the crimes such as\n S.498A? If so, what should be its composition and the\n qualifications of women police deployed in such a cell?\n (b) As the present experience shows, it is likely that wherever\n a CWC is set up, there may be substantial number of unfilled\n vacancies and the personnel may not have undergone the requisite\n training. In this situation, whether it would be advisable to\n entrust the investigation etc. to CWC to the exclusion of the\n jurisdictional Police Station?\n ---\n\n 50\n\n Annexure - II\n [refer para 8.3 of the Report]\n\n Extracts from the 237th Report of the Law Commission of India on\n 'Compounding of (\nIPC\n) Offences'\n\n5. Compoundability of Certain Offences\n\n5.1 Now, we shall consider the question of compoundability of certain specific\noffences.\n\nSection 498A\n, IPC\n\n5.2 Whether the offence specified in Section 498A should be made\ncompoundable, and, if yes, whether it should be compoundable without or with\nthe permission of the Court, is the two-fold question.\n\n5.3 Section 498A penalizes the husband or the relatives of the husband for\nsubjecting a woman to cruelty. The definition of cruelty as given in the Section\nis in two parts: 1) Willful conduct of such a nature that is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\nhealth (mental or physical), 2) Harassment of the woman with a view to\ncoercing her or her relatives to meet an unlawful demand for any property or\nvaluable security. Thus the dowry related harassment as well as violent\nconduct on the part of the husband or his relations by causing injury or danger\nto her life, limb or health, are comprehended within the scope of Section 498A.\nQuite often, the prosecution under \nSection 498A\n IPC is coupled with\nprosecution under \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 as well.\n\n5.4 Normally, if the wife is prepared to condone the ill-treatment and\nharassment meted out to her either by reason of change in the attitude or\nrepentance on the part of the husband or reparation for the injury caused to\nher, the law should not stand in the way of terminating the criminal\nproceedings. However, the argument that is mainly advanced against the\ncompoundability is that the dowry is a social evil and the law designed to\npunish those who harass the wives with demand of dowry should be allowed to\ntake its full course instead of putting its seal of approval on the private\ncompromises. The social consciousness and the societal interest demands that\nsuch offences should be kept outside the domain of out-of-court settlement, it\nis argued. There can be no doubt that in dealing with this aspect, the impact of\nthe crime on the society and the degree of social harm that might result,\nshould be duly considered. At the same time, undesirable consequences that\nfollow if compounding is not allowed, ought to be kept in view because the\nsocial harm or societal interest cannot be considered in vacuum. A holistic and\nrational view has to be taken. While no impediments shall be placed against\n\n 51\n\n the effective operation of law enacted to curb a social evil, it should not be\nforgotten that the society is equally interested in promoting marital harmony\nand the welfare of the aggrieved women. A rational and balanced approach is\nall the more necessary for the reason that other avenues are open to the\nreconciled couple to put an end to the criminal proceedings. One such course\nis to file a 'quash' petition under \nSection 482\n of CrPC in the High Court.\nWhether it is necessary to drive them to go through this time consuming and\ncostly process is one pertinent question. If a wife who suffered in the hands of\nthe husband is prepared to forget the past and agreeable to live amicably with\nthe husband or separate honourably without rancor or revenge, the society\nwould seldom condemn such move nor can it be said that the legal recognition\nof amicable settlement in such cases would encourage the forbidden evil i.e.\nthe dowry. Section 498A should not be allowed to become counter-productive.\nIn matters relating to family life and marital relationship, the advantages and\nbeneficent results that follow from allowing the discontinuance of legal\nproceedings to give effect to a compromise or reconciliation would outweigh the\ndegree of social harm that may be caused by non-prosecution. If the\nproceedings are allowed to go on despite the compromise arrived at by both\nsides, either there will be little scope for conviction or the life of the victim\nwould become more miserable. In what way the social good is achieved\nthereby? We repeat that a doctrinaire and isolated approach cannot be adopted\nin dealing with this issue. The sensitivity of a family dispute and the individual\nfacts and circumstances cannot be ignored. Hence, the Commission is not\ninclined to countenance the view that dowry being a social evil, compounding\nshould not be allowed under any circumstances. Incidentally, it may be\nmentioned that many offences having the potentiality of social harm, not\nmerely individual harm, are classified as compoundable offences. Further, the\ngravamen of the charge under Section 498-A need not necessarily be dowry-\nrelated harassment. It may be 'cruelty' falling only within clause (a) of the\nExplanation and the demand of dowry is not an integral part of that clause.\n5.5 Another argument against compoundability is that the permission to\ncompound would amount to legal recognition of violence against women and\nthat the factum of reconciliation cannot be a justifiable ground to legally\ncondone the violence. The acceptance of such an argument would imply that\nthe priority of law should be to take the criminal proceedings to their logical\nend and to inflict punishment on the husband irrespective of the mutual desire\nto patch up the differences. It means - reconciliation or no reconciliation, the\nhusband should not be spared of the impending prosecution and the\npunishment if any; then only Section 498A would achieve its objective. We do\nnot think that the objective of Section 498A will be better achieved by allowing\nthe prosecution to take its own course without regard to the rapprochement\nthat has taken place between the couple in conflict. As observed earlier, a\nbalanced and holistic approach is called for in handling a sensitive issue\naffecting the family and social relations. Reconciliation without compounding\nwill not be practically possible and the law should not ignore the important\n\n 52\n\n event of reconciliation. The emphasis should not be merely on the punitive\naspect of the law. In matters of this nature, the law should not come in the way\nof genuine reconciliation or revival of harmonious relations between the\nhusband and estranged wife. Wisdom behind all prosecutions and\npunishments is to explore a judicious mix of deterrence, deprivation of liberty\nand repentance and reformation. Any emphasis on one aspect alone, as has\nbeen found in the working of harsh and cruel punishment regimes, may\nbecome a pigeonhole model.\n\n5.6 The other argument which is put forward against compounding is that\nhapless women especially those who are not much educated and who do not\nhave independent means of livelihood, may be pressurized and coerced to\nwithdraw the proceeding and the victim woman will be left with no option but\nto purchase peace though her grievance remains unsolved. However, this\nargument may not be very substantial. The same argument can be put forward\nin respect of compoundable offences wherever the victims are women. The\nsafeguard of Court's permission would, by and large, be a sufficient check\nagainst the possible tactics that may be adopted by the husband and his\nrelations/friends. The function of the Court in this matter is not a mere\nformality. The Judicial Magistrate or Family Court Judge is expected to be\nextra-cautious and play an active role. In this regard, the judge can take the\nassistance of a woman lawyer or a professional counselor or a representative of\nLegal Services Authority and the woman concerned can be examined in his/her\nchambers in the presence of one of them. Alternatively, the assistance of a lady\ncolleague can also be sought for examining a woman victim in the chambers.\nNormally the trial Magistrates/Judges are sensitized in gender- related issues\nin the course of training at the Judicial Academies. In cities like Delhi,\nBangalore, Chennai etc. competent and trained mediators are involved in the\nprocess of bringing about an amicable settlement in marital disputes. Though\nthe Court is expected to act with due care and caution in dealing with the\napplication for compounding the offence under Section 498A, we are of the view\nthat it is desirable to introduce an additional safeguard as follows:-\n\n After the application for compounding an offence under\n S.498A\n of\nIndian Penal Code is filed and on interviewing the aggrieved woman,\npreferably in the Chamber in the presence of a lady judicial officer or a\nrepresentative of District Legal Services Authority or a counselor or a\nclose relation, if the Magistrate is satisfied that there was prima facie a\nvoluntary and genuine settlement between the parties, the Magistrate\nshall make a record to that effect and the hearing of application shall be\nadjourned by three months or such other earlier date which the\nMagistrate may fix in the interests of Justice. On the adjourned date, the\nMagistrate shall again interview the victim woman in the like manner and\nthen pass the final order permitting or refusing to compound the offence\nafter giving opportunity of hearing to the accused. In the interregnum, it\n\n 53\n\n shall be open to the aggrieved woman to file an application revoking her\nearlier offer to compound the offence on sufficient grounds.\n\n5.7 Accordingly, it is proposed to add sub-section (2A) to \nSection 320\n CrPC.\n\nThe proposed provision will ensure that the offer to compound the offence is\nvoluntary and free from pressures and the wife has not been subjected to ill-\ntreatment subsequent to the offer of compounding. Incidentally, it underscores\nthe need for the Court playing an active role while dealing with the application\nfor compounding the offence under Section 498-A.\n\n5.8 The other points which deserve notice in answering the issue whether the\noffence under Section 498A should be made compoundable, are the following:-\n\n \nth\n5.8.1 The Law Commission of India in its 154 report (1996) recommended\ninclusion of S. 498A in the Table appended to Section 320(2) so that it can be\ncompounded with the permission of the Court. The related extracts from the\nReport are as follows: \"Of late, various High Courts have quashed criminal\nproceedings in respect of non-cognizable offences because of settlement between\nthe parties to achieve harmony and peace in the society. For instance, criminal\nproceedings in respect of offences under \nSection 406\n, IPC, relating to criminal\nbreach of trust of dowry articles or Istridhan and offences under \nsection 498A\n,\nIPC relating to cruelty on woman by husband or relatives of husband were\nquashed in Arun Kumar Vohra v. RituVohra, \nNirlap Singh v. State of Punjab\n.\"\n\n \nth\n5.8.2 In continuation of what was said in the 154 Report, we may point out\n\n 11\n\nthat the apex court, in the case of \nB.S. Joshi vs. State of Haryana\n , has firmly\nlaid down the proposition that in order to subserve the ends of justice, the\ninherent power under \nSection 482\n CrPC can be exercised by the High Court to\nquash the criminal proceedings at the instance of husband and wife who have\namicably settled the matter and are desirous of putting end to the acrimony.\n\nThe principle \nlaid down in\n this case was cited with approval in \nNikhil Merchant\n\n 12 13\n\nvs. CBI\n . However, a coordinate Bench doubted the correctness of these\ndecisions and referred the matter for consideration by a larger Bench.\nAccording to the referring Bench, the Court cannot indirectly permit\ncompounding of non-compoundable offences.\n\n th\n5.8.3 The recommendation of the Law Commission in the 154 Report\n th\nregarding Section 498A was reiterated in the 177 Report (2001). The\nCommission noted that over the last several years, a number ofrepresentations\nhad been received by the Law Commission from individuals and organizations\nto make the said offence compoundable.\n\n5.8.4 Further, Justice Malimath Committee's Report on Reforms of Criminal\nJustice System strongly supported the plea to make Section 498 A a\ncompoundable offence. The Committee observed:\n\n 54\n\n \"A less tolerant and impulsive woman may lodge an FIR even on a trivial act. The\nresult is that the husband and his family may be immediately arrested and there\nmay be a suspension or loss of job. The offence alleged being non-bailable,\ninnocent persons languish in custody. There may be a claim for maintenance\nadding fuel to fire, especially if the husband cannot pay. Now the woman may\nchange her mind and get into the mood to forget and forgive. The husband may\nalso realize the mistakes committed and come forward to turn over a new leaf for\na loving and cordial relationship. The woman may like to seek reconciliation. But\nthis may not be possible due to the legal obstacles. Even if she wishes to make\namends by withdrawing the complaint, she cannot do so as the offence is non-\ncompoundable. The doors for returning to family life stand closed. She is thus left\nat the mercy of her natal family...\n\nThis section, therefore, helps neither the wife nor the husband. The offence being\nnon-bailable and non-compoundable makes an innocent person undergo\nstigmatization and hardship. Heartless provisions that make the offence non-\nbailable and non-compoundable operate against reconciliations. It is therefore\nnecessary to make this offence (a) bailable and (b) compoundable to give a\nchance to the spouses to come together.\"\n\nThough this Commission is not inclined to endorse the entirety of observations\nmade in the above passage, some of them reinforce our conclusion to make it\ncompoundable.\n\n5.8.5 The views of Malimath Committee as well as the recommendations in the\n th\n154 Report of Law commission were referred to with approval by the\nDepartment-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs in its\n th\n111 Report on the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2003 (August 2005). The\nStanding Committee observed thus: \"It is desirable to provide a chance to the\nestranged spouses to come together and therefore it is proposed to make the\noffence\n u/s 498A\n IPC, a compoundable one by inserting this Section in the Table\n th\nunder sub-section(2) of \nSection 320\n of CrPC\". 5.8.6 The 128 Report of the said\nStanding Committee (2008) on the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n (Amendment)\n th\nBill, 2006 reiterated the recommendation made in the 111 Report. 5.8.7 The\nviews of Supreme Court and High Courts provide yet another justification to\ntreat the offence under Section 498A compoundable.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a brief order passed in \nRamgopal vs. State of M.P.\n\nobserved that the offences under Section 498A, among others, can be made\ncompoundable by introducing suitable amendment to law. The Bombay High\nCourt14, as long back as in 1992, made a strong suggestion to amend \nSection\n320\n of CrPC in order to include Section 498A within that Section.\n\n 15\n\nIn the case of \nPreeti Gupta vs. State of Jharkhand\n , the Supreme Court,\nspeaking through Dalvir Bhandari, J. exhorted the members of the Bar to treat\nevery complaint under Section 498A as a basic human problem and to make a\n\n 55\n\n serious endeavour to help the parties in arriving at amicable resolution of that\nhuman problem. The Supreme Court then observed that the Courts have to be\nextremely careful and cautious in dealing with these complaints and must take\npragmatic realities into consideration. Further, it was observed: \"Before parting\nwith the case, we would like to observe that a serious relook of the entire\nprovision is warranted by the legislation. It is also a matter of common\nknowledge that exaggerated versions of the incident are reflected in a large\nnumber of complaints. The tendency of over implication is also reflected in a very\nlarge number of cases\". The Supreme Court then made these observations: \"It is\nimperative for the legislature to take into consideration the informed public\nopinion and the pragmatic realities in consideration and make necessary\nchanges in the relevant provisions of law. We direct the Registry to send copy of\nthis judgment to the Law Commission and to the Union Law Secretary,\nGovernment of India who may place it before the Hon'ble Minister for Law &\nJustice to take appropriate steps in the larger interest of the society\".\n\n5.9 Yet another factor that should be taken note of is the policy of law in laying\nstress on effecting conciliation between the warring couples. The provisions in\n\nSection 9\n of the Family Courts Act, 1984 \nSection23 (2)\n of the Hindu Marriage\nAct, 1955 and \nSection 34(2)\n of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 impose an\nobligation on the court to take necessary steps to facilitate re-conciliation or\namicable settlement.\n\n5.10 It is worthy of note that in Andhra Pradesh, the State Legislature made an\n nd\namendment to \nSection 320(2)\n of CrPC by inserting the following in the 2\nTable.\n\nHusband or relative of 498A The woman subjected to cruelty:\n\nhusband of a woman Provided that a minimum period of\nsubjecting her to cruelty three months shall elapse from the\n date of request or application for\n compromise before a Court and the\n Court can accept a request for\n compounding an offence under\n \nSection 498A\n of the Indian Penal\n Code provided none of the parties\n withdraw the case in the\n intervening period.\n\nThe observations made by the High Court in various cases were taken into\naccount while making this amendment. The amendment came into force on\n1.8.2003. Our recommendation is substantially on the same lines.\n\n5.11 The overwhelming views reflected in the responses received by the Law\nCommission and the inputs the Commission has got in the course of\n\n 56\n\n deliberations with the members of District and Subordinate Judiciary, the\nmembers of the Bar and the law students is yet another reason persuading us\nto recommend the amendment of law to make the offence under 498A\ncompoundable with the permission of Court. The list of respondents from\nwhom views have been received by the Commission is at Annexure 1-B. An\nanalysis of such views touching on the point of compoundability is furnished at\nAnnexure 1-A. The Consultation Paper-cum-Questionnaire on various aspects\nof Section 498-A published by the Commission is attached hereto as Annexure-\n\n2\n\n5.12 At the Conference with judicial officers including lady officers, there was\nalmost unanimous opinion in favour of making the offence compoundable. The\nlady lawyers who were present at the Conferences held in Visakhapatnam,\nChennai and Aurangabad did not oppose the move. At a recent Conference held\nwith about 35 Judicial Officers of various ranks at Delhi Judicial Academy,\nthere was unanimity on the point of compoundability. However, some Judges\nexpressed reservation about allowing 3 months gestation period for passing a\nfinal order of compounding under Section 320(2) Cr PC. It was suggested that\nthere should be some flexibility in this regard and the 3 months' period need\nnot be strictly adhered to especially where there is a package of settlement\nconcerning civil disputes as well. Keeping this suggestion in view, the\nCommission has provided that in the interests of justice, the Magistrate can\npass orders within a lesser time.\n\n5.13 The Law Commission is therefore of the considered view that the offence\nunder \nSection 498A\n IPC should be made compoundable with the permission of\nthe Court. Accordingly, in Table-2 forming part of \nSection 320(2)\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, the following shall be inserted after the entry referring to\nSection 494 and before the entry relating to Section 500:\n\nHusband or relative of husband of a 498A The woman subjected to\nwoman subjecting her to cruelty cruelty.\n\nSub-section (2A) shall be added to \nSection 320\n CrPC, as set out in paragraph\n5.6, page 17 supra.\n\n 57\n\n Annexure - III\n [refer para 10.1 of the Report]\n\n List of persons, organizations and officials who responded\n to the questionnaire\n\nA LIST OF INDIVIDUALS - RESPONDED TO THE QUESTIONANNAIRE ON\n SECTION 498A IPC\n\n S/Shri/Ms\n\n 1.

A.S. Gill, Chairman, Punjab State Law\nCommission expressed the view that there is no need to exercise the power of\narrest of husband and his family members as it will result in breakdown of\nfamily. Recourse may be initially taken to dispute settlement mechanism such\nconciliation, mediation and counselling. The process of making effort for\nreconciliation is to be initiated even at the Police Station level by taking the aid\nof respectable persons named by both parties. The counselling mechanism\nunder \nDomestic Violence Act\n can also be availed of by taking the assistance of\nprofessionally qualified counsellors appointed by State Government. The\noffence should be made bailable and compoundable. Bailability will not\nbecome in any way counter-productive. There is every need to sensitize the\npolice in these matters and only an experienced officer should be entrusted\nwith investigation. Compounding should be allowed subject to the permission\nof Court. The main reason for low conviction rate in the prosecution under\nSection 498-A is due to the fact that the allegations are exaggerated and\nbeyond facts. Crime against Women Cell (CWC) should consist of persons who\nare well educated and experienced and have orientation to deal effectively with\nmarital dispute.\n\n National Commission for Minorities:\n\n The issue can be best addressed by educating public through awareness\nprogrammes, also designed for minorities.\n\n Members of National Commission for Minorities (Dr. H.T. Sangliana\n & Shri K.N. Daruwala)\n\n Police should have open and balanced approach. In all cases,\nstraightway the case need not be registered. The decision to register a case\nmay be taken by the Inspector level officer. Cases under 498A to be handled\nwith utmost care. Only after satisfying with the genuineness of the complaint,\nan arrest should be made and not in a routine manner. Formal investigation\ncan be kept in abeyance until the conciliation attempt is completed which\nshould not be more than three weeks. Right mediators can be identified\nthrough NGO nets and retired officials from Police and judiciary. In\nKarnataka, women's help centres are available in the compound of\nCommissioner of Police. The fourth parties agreed to compromise after\nregistration, Court's permission may be taken to compound. If no death is\ninvolved, it may be made bailable. Bail should be granted to the accused of\nhis/her age is above 60 and if no direct involvement is established. Free legal\naid cell will be useful to butt availability of such help when required is\n\n 75\n\n doubtful. Long pendency of cases discourages the complainants from\npursuing the matters further.\n\n Shri Daruwala:\n\n A detailed inquiry before arrest is necessary. However, the physical\nsecurity of the women must be ensured. Arrest should be made normally with\nwarrants. Police must record reasons for arrest without warrant. The offence\ncould be made bailable though the bail has to be granted sparingly. There\nshould be Police and anti-dowry cell in every district manned by trained\nwoman police. The two processes, conciliation and investigation can proceed\nside by side. Offence could be made compoundable. Women do not have easy\naccess to LSAs at grass root level. Measures to spread awareness should be\ntaken though media and even it can be made part of school curricula.\n\n Dr. Ranbir Singh, Vice-Chancellor (on behalf of NLU Delhi) - There is\nenough evidence to suggest that this Section has been misused in many ways.\nHowever, the misuse did not flow from the principle and intention on which\nthis law is based. Robust effort should be made to implement the law so that\nthe social objective of the law does not suffer. The misuse or false implications\ncould be minimised by insisting on strict observance of the law of arrest as\nevolved in D.K. Basu case [(1997) 1 SCC 416)]. Secondly, the mandate of this\nlaw should be shifted from penal to restorative purpose. The recourse to\nmediation and conciliation in the first instance is the best idea. The arrest and\nother drastic legal measures should begin when all the options of restoration\nhave failed. Registering the case is the legal obligation of the Police but they\nneed not act in undue haste to effect the arrest. They should be guided by the\nspirit of Section 157 Cr. P.C. It would be worthwhile to divide the offence\nunder Section 498-A in two categories depending on the gravity of the act of\ncruelty alleged. The offence can then be categorised as bailable or non-\nbailable. Offence of milder degree may be treated as family discord and be\naddressed with an approach of reconciliation. Awareness building programmes\ninvolving statutory bodies and NGOs should be organised. The officers\nmanning women Police Stations must be given adequate training.\n\n Dr. Bimal Patel, Director, GNLU, Gandhinagar, Gujarat - The Police\nshould investigate the case and only on satisfaction of commission of offence\nunder 498-A they should think of arrest. Making the offence bailable solves the\nproblem to certain extent, though there are divergent views. The recourse can\nalso be taken to Section 437 Cr. P.C. The offence can be made compoundable\nwith the permission of Court. There should be better coordination between the\nLSA (Legal Services Authority) and Police. CWC should be under the control of\nInspector level woman officer.\n\n 76\n\n Judicial Officers Training Institute, (JOTRI), Jabalpur -\n\n 1. Police has to register the criminal case on receiving FIR alleging\n commission of offence under Section 498A, but they should\n commence investigation keeping in view the two conditions\n contemplated under Section 157 Cr.PC.\n\n Having regard to the nature of dispute, preliminary investigation\n should be done instead of straightway arresting the husband or other\n relatives named in the FIR. Immediate arrest of the husband and\n other close relatives will destroy the possibility of amicable resolution\n of dispute forever.\n\n 2. Police officer may commence investigation but before taking harsh\n measures by way of arrest etc., there should be a process of\n reconciliation with the help of counseling centres run by reputed\n NGOs or Govt. mediation centres. The concerned police officer\n should contact the DLSA or TLSA so that the authority may take\n steps to arrange the task of conciliation.\n\n 3. Offence should remain non-bailable with cautious approach of the\n police in making arrest. Misuse or over-implication cannot be a\n ground of making the offence bailable as this will defeat the\n objective of Section 498A.\n\n 4. Counseling/mediation procedures should be completed preferably\n within two months from the date of appearance of husband and\n wife. If the husband does not respond to the notice from family\n counseling centre or does not cooperate in the process of\n counseling, then only, the I.O. should proceed against the erring\n party according to law after receiving the report from the\n counselors/mediators. After amicable settlement, further\n investigation of the criminal case shall be stopped and the case be\n closed.\n\n 5. Police should not get involved in the actual process of conciliation.\n Family counseling courts should be established in every district\n with professional counselors. Mediation Centres are also helpful in\n resolving matrimonial disputes.\n\n Director, H.P. Judicial Academy, Shimla - Make 498-A \nIPC\n gender\nneutral. 498-A should be removed from criminal case as it is a family matter\nand because of this many adverse consequences will follow. The filing of Police\nreport after FIR must be completed in three months and court proceedings\nshould be completed within one year thereafter.\n\n Dr. Neera Bharihoke, ADJ, Delhi - No immediate arrest and it should\nbe the last resort. Make it bailable and compoundable. There should be a\nsupervisory body over CWC. LSA must spread awareness.\n\n 77\n\n Dr. Neera Gupta: Offences under Section 498A to be made non-\ncognizable, bailable. Persons who misuse the provision shall be penalized on\ncompletion of trial by the very same court. Separate provisions should be\nintroduced for this purpose. Heavy fine of Rs.10 lakhs should be there.\nPersons who use women-protection laws for settling personal scores should be\npunished. The Section must be made gender neutral. Police should keep away\nfrom counselling.\n\n Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India -\nLaw according protection to women should be not be tinkered with; however, if\nsome set procedures are followed, misuse can be curtailed. No arrest should be\nmade on a mere allegation. In matrimonial disputes, it may not be necessary to\nimmediately exercise the power of arrest in all cases. First recourse should to\nsettlement mechanism. Counselling of parties should be done by professional\nqualified counsellors and police should empanel such persons Mahila desks to\nbe set up at Police Stations and CAW Cells.\n\n Lawyers Collective (Ms. Indira Jaisingh, Sr. Advocate, New Delhi) -\nPolice should take action as per the existing laws and the procedure specified\nunder Cr. P.C. Let it remain non-bailable and non-compoundable. Need to\nstrengthen coordination between LSA and Police Station. Transparency of\naction and accountability can act as safeguards. Under-staffed and untrained\nCAW Cell cannot be helpful for these cases. Police force needed to be infused\nwith basic human values and made sensitive to the constitutional ethos.\n\n Ms. Nagaratna A., Asstt. Professor of Law, NLSIU, Bangalore -\nOffence should be made bailable and compoundable with the permission of\nCourt. The Police soon after recording FIR must commence investigation and\nfind out the existence of prima facie case. At no point Police shall have the\npower to arrest the accused without warrant of a Magistrate. Aged parents and\nsisters of the husband and other relatives must be spared from the ill-effects\nof unnecessary arrest. For the purpose of arrest, the offence should be made\nnon-cognizable; but, for the purpose of investigation, it shall remain cognizable\nso that the I.O. can commence the investigation without waiting for permission\nby a Magistrate like in a non-cognizable offence. Secondly, the I.O. shall have\nthe power to arrest only after fulfilling the conditions laid down under the\namended \nCr.P.C\n. CWCs shall be headed by well-qualified and trained women\nInspectors. LSA can play a role for conciliation at pre-investigation and pre-\ntrial stage.\n\n AIDWA (Ms. Keerti Singh, Delhi)\n\n Police failure in taking timely action and in investigating the case on proper\nlines commented upon. Police should act according to the existing law and they do\nnot need any directions to be cautious about these complaints as they are already\ntaking long time even to register the FIR. If the woman complaints of physical\nviolence, she should be immediately provided medical aid and the husband/in-laws\nshould be stopped from committing further acts of violence, if necessary by arresting\n\n 78\n\n him. Custodial interrogation could yield good results. The police has to help the\nvictim woman by providing medical counseling and/or sending her to a shelter home.\nCrisis centres should be set up at the block and district level.\n\n The seriousness of the crime should not be diluted by making it bailable and\ncompoundable. Making it compoundable even with the permission of the Court will\nonly result in the woman facing more pressure to compromise. In any event, if a\ncompromise is reached, it gets recognition from the court to quash criminal\nproceedings. Reconciliation should not be thrust upon the woman. It would be wrong\nto first try to reconcile both the parties. Conciliation by a trained counselor should be\nresorted to only if it can be carried out without compromising the rights and position\nof the woman and only if the woman wants the return of dowry/streedhan to settle the\nmatter.\n\nIt would not be advisable to entrust the investigations to the CWCs to the exclusion of\nregular Police Stations. The experience shows that CW Cells have not been positive.\nThe number of Police Stations should be increased and personnel properly trained.\nCWCs should be headed by a lady DSP.\n\n KFWL (President, Ms. K. Devi, Advocate), Kochi - It should remain non-\nbailable but shall be made compoundable with the permission of Court. Immediate\narrest to be made only if offence is grave and affected the life, limb or health of the\nvictim. There should be better coordination between LSA and Police. Crime against\nWomen Cell in every district is desirable and should be headed by an IAS Officer.\nNominees from local bodies, NGO, LSAs, mental health specialists apart from Police\npersonnel should be the members thereof.\n\n Rakshak Foundation (Shri Sachin Bansal, Santa Clara, USA) - Make it\nbailable and compoundable. No arrest before investigation. There should be better\ncoordination between LSA and Police. Fast Track Courts to dispose of cases within a\ntime bound schedule shall be opened.\n\n Shri Priyank Parekh, Manchester, USA - Police to thoroughly investigate and\nnot to arrest immediately, make it bailable and compoundable. CWC with well trained\nPolice officer is desirable.\n\n Dr. Virender Aggarwal, Director (Academics) Chandigarh - Make it non-\nbailable. It should remain non-bailable and non-compoundable. On receiving FIR,\nPolice should make preliminary inquiry through relatives, neigbours etc. to find out\nthe genuineness of the case before taking any action. LSA can decide whether to deal\nwith case as criminal matter or in the realm of matrimonial civil law. CWC should\nonly help the regular investigation agencies.\n\n Shri Sivaiah Naidu, Registrar General, High Court of A.P. - Efforts for\nconciliation should be made on receipt of complaint. Immediate arrest should not be\nresorted to unless there is immediate danger to the victim or the husband is about to\nleave the jurisdiction of Indian Courts. Make the offence bailable and compoundable.\nConciliation between the parties before effecting arrest is desirable and such\nconciliation can take place through the institution of LSA. The panel of mediators may\nconsist of family welfare experts and trained counselors. LSAs in Taluka and District\nlevels should play a more active role. There should be CAW Cell at District\n\n 79\n\n Headquarters and it shall be headed by Dy.SP rank officer. The woman police deployed\nin this cell should have ample experience in life and proper awareness of laws related\nto woman.\n\n Shri Abhay Kumar, Registrar, High Court of M.P., Jabalpur - No immediate\narrest but register the case and start preliminary investigation. It shall remain non-\nbailable but compoundable. Family counseling centres should be opened all over the\nState.\n\n Additional Chief Judl. Magistrate (E.O.), Ernakulam - Simultaneous with the\nregistration of a case under Section 498-A, the Police should intimate the matter to\nthe Protection Officer and cause an application to be filed before the Judl. Magistrate\nunder the \nDomestic Violence Act\n so that the possibility of conciliation could be\nexplored under judicial supervision. Arrest should be resorted to only after getting\npermission from the Magistrate. Do not make the offence bailable but make it\ncompoundable. There should be regular meetings between LSA at the District level\nand SHO of Police Stations to take stock of the cases under 498-A.\n\n Shri Thomas Pallickparampil, District Judge, Kerala - Do not make offence\nbailable but make it compoundable. Interrogation without arrest will be ideal\nsituation. LSA may be assigned better and extensive role. Pre-litigation adalats ought\nto be organized. However, LSAs should not be constrained to coordinate with Police\nStations. Need for specially trained senior woman police officer in CWC.\n\n Shri Narender Kumar, District Judge (Family Courts)- Bhiwani - Make it\nbailable and compoundable. On receiving FIR, definite conclusion based on history of\nfamily life, root cause for lodging FIR should be arrived at. Proper training should be\ngiven to women police officials. To spread awareness by making it mandatory for TV\nchannels to show protective penal provisions and civil rights available to women.\n\n Shri R.R. Garg, District Judge, Karnal - No immediate arrest. First, matter to\nbe sent to Conciliation Board or Counseling/mediation centres. It should remain non-\nbailable but compoundable. Need to spread awareness through print and electronic\nmedia. CWC to be headed by woman police officer of the rank of S.P.\n\n Ms. Renhcamo P. Kikon, DIG of Police, Nagaland, Kohima - It should\nremain non-bailable but compoundable. Initially preliminary investigation and steps\nfor reconciliation/mediation to be taken. If efforts fail, then the case to be registered\nunder Section 498-A. Women Cell should be headed by Inspector rank lady officer.\nLSA should educate women and help them at grass root levels.\n\n I. G. of Police - Union Territory, Chandigarh - Before registering the FIR,\npolice should adopt a conciliation process with the help of competent counselors and\nshould act as an observer in order to avoid unwarranted arrest. A time limit of 45 days\nis already being followed in this process. Offence to remain non-bailable but\ncompoundable with the permission of Court. CWC should be established in every\nDistrict with experienced and well trained women police officials.\n\n 80\n\n Shri Mangesh Kashyap, DCP (HQ), Delhi: \nSection 498(A)\n of IPC is certainly\nneeded in its unadulterated form. Some procedural improvements could be made\nbefore registering FIR. In order to ensure that the facts are not exaggerated, the\naggrieved woman should be asked to write an application after few sessions of\ninteractions with a Counsellor. In case the complaint is found exaggerated benefit of\ndoubt should be given. All possible efforts should be made through counselling and\nmediation to keep the woman and her children in the matrimonial home. Make it\nnon-bailable. Case registered under 498A should be investigated by officer in the\nrank of Sub Inspector or above. They should be supervised regularly by an ACP once\nin a fortnight and DCP / ADCP once in a month.\n\n Shri D.V.K. Rao, Under Secretary, Ministry of Women & Child\nDevelopment, Delhi: On receipt of complaint, police should immediately register a\nFIR and conduct investigation into the matter. However, immediate arrest of husband\nshould not be resorted to unless the alleged act of cruelty is prima facie very serious\nand calls for such arrest. Mediation and counseling process should be undertaken\nbut the police should exercise restraint in making arrest of relatives. It should remain\nnon-bailable and non-compoundable. Appropriate reconciliation effort as a first step\nshould be undertaken. Mediation should be done by trained professionals and should\nbe completed within two months. Legal Services Authorities should play a more\nextensive role in facilitating the conciliation. Crime against women cell should be\nestablished in every District and should consist of personnel who have been trained\nand sensitized to deal with cases of violence against women.\n\n Shri T. Pachuau, IG of Police, Manipur - It should remain non-bailable but\ncompoundable with the permission of the Court. Immediate arrest and custodial\ninterrogation of husband and relatives should be avoided. Action to be taken to\nexamine the victim and the accused soon after filing of FIR. Legal Services Authority\n(LSA) of the District or professional counselors will be ideally suited to process\nconciliation.\n\n 81\n\n Annexure - III-C\n [refer para 10.1 of the Report]\n\nREPLIES OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO THE QUESTIONANNAIRE\nON SECTION 498A IPC\n\n1. Secretary, Law Department, A&N Admn., Port Blair\n\n No immediate arrest without relevant evidence and efforts of\n reconciliation. Make it Non-bailable and compoundable.

Law Department, Tripura.\n\n Insert Section 154-A in the \nCr.P.C\n. as \"Special Law\" by way of\n amendment to prescribe the procedure for arrest and detention in order\n to check misuse of \nSec.498-A\n of IPC.\n\n7. Law Department, Govt. of Goa\n\n Make it compoundable with the permission of court. Make it bailable\n only for husband's relatives not staying with him. Otherwise, it\n should remain non-bailable.\n\n The police, on receiving the complaint under \nsection 498-A\n of IPC, is\n required to find out whether there is any prima facie case reflected in the\n complaint. No immediate arrest should be made but if alleged offence is\n a grave /en only immediate arrest and custodial interrogation of\n husband and his relatives named in the FIR could be made.\n\n 83\n\n Investigation is to be completed in three months. Efforts should be made\n by police first to send the parties for conciliation / settlement by the\n appropriate authority appointed under the \"\nProtection of Women from\n Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n.\" The conciliators / mediators or\n professional counsellors (who may be part of NGOs) or the friends or\n elders known to both the marital parties; lady and men lawyers only who\n volunteer to act in such matters or District Legal Service Authority may\n be invited in conciliation/counseling process. There is need for\n coordination between LSAs and the Police Station. It is desirable to have\n a separate CWC in every District to deal exclusively with such cases.\n Women police Cell should be headed by a Lady DySP,\n\n8. Department of Home and Inter State Border Affairs, Government of\n Arunachal Pradesh, Itanagar.\n\n Before a regular case is registered, preliminary enquiry should be\n mandatory during which both sides should be heard and efforts be made\n for mediation and reconciliation. It should not be made bailable.\n Reconciliation through counseling should be the first step prior to\n registration of the case and a limit time of 90 days for the counseling\n process is recommended. Keep it non-bailable and non-compoundable.\n Investigation by CWC to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the police\n station is not advisable.\n\n9. Government of Madhya Pradesh\n Before arresting the accused, the first step is to mediate and opt for\n compromise as far as possible within one month's time. The mediators\n can include experienced, respectable citizen or even police officers. Make\n it bailable so that it cannot be misused.

In this context, the Committee feels that in case of\n any marital discord which has reached the stage of a complaint under\n \nSection 498A\n, IPC, it would be better if the parties have the option of a\n compromise whereafter they can settle down in their lives appropriately for\n a better future rather than diverting their energies negatively by pursuing\n litigation.

The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his\n power to do so. Arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can\n cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. No\n arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of\n commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent for a\n police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a\n citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made\n without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to\n the genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief\n both as to the person's complicity and even so as to the need to effect\n arrest. Denying a person of his liberty is a serious matter. The\n recommendations of the Police Commission merely reflect the constitutional\n concomitants of the fundamental right to personal liberty and freedom. A\n person is not liable to arrest merely on the suspicion of complicity in an\n offence. There must be some reasonable justification in the opinion of the\n officer effecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and justified.\n Except in heinous offences, an arrest must be avoided if a police officer\n issues notice to person to attend the Station House and not to leave the\n Station without permission would do. Then, there is the right to have\n someone informed. That right of the arrested person, upon request, to have\n someone informed and to consult privately with a lawyer was recognised\n by Section 56(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984 in England\"."

      "text": "1. Keeping in view the representations received from various quarters\nand observations made by the Supreme Court and the High Courts, the\nHome Ministry of the Government of India requested the Law\nCommission of India to consider whether any amendments to\n s.498A\n of\nIndian Penal Code or other measures are necessary to check the alleged\nmisuse of the said provision especially by way of over-implication.\n2. S.498A was introduced in the year 1983 to protect married women\nfrom being subjected to cruelty by the husband or his relatives. A\npunishment extending to 3 years and fine has been prescribed. The\nexpression 'cruelty' has been defined in wide terms so as to include\ninflicting physical or mental harm to the body or health of the woman\nand indulging in acts of harassment with a view to coerce her or her\nrelations to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity. Harassment for dowry falls within the sweep of latter limb of\nthe section. Creating a situation driving the woman to commit suicide is\nalso one of the ingredients of 'cruelty'. The offence under s.498A is\ncognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable.\n3. In a recent case of Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand, the\nSupreme Court observed that a serious relook of the provision is\nwarranted by the Legislature. \"It is a matter of common knowledge that\nexaggerated versions of the incidents are reflected in a large number of\ncomplaints. The tendency of over-implication is also reflected in a very\nlarge number of cases\". The Court took note of the common tendency\nto implicate husband and all his immediate relations. In an earlier case\nalso - Sushil Kumar Sharma v. UOI (2005), the Supreme Court lamented\nthat in many instances, complaints under s.498A were being filed with\nan oblique motive to wreck personal vendetta. \"It may therefore become\nnecessary for the Legislature to find out ways how the makers of\nfrivolous complaints or allegations can be appropriately dealt with\", it\nwas observed. It was also observed that \"by misuse of the provision, a\nnew legal terrorism can be unleashed\".\n4. The factum of over-implication is borne out by the statistical data\nof the cases under s.498A. Such implication of the relatives of husband\nwas found to be unjustified in a large number of decided cases. While\nso, it appears that the women especially from the poor strata of the\nsociety living in rural areas rarely take resort to the provision.\n5. The conviction rate in respect of the cases under s.498A is quite\nlow. It is learnt that on account of subsequent events such as amicable\n 44\n settlement, the complainant women do not evince interest in taking the\nprosecution to its logical conclusion.\n6. The arguments for relieving the rigour of s.498A by suitable\namendments (which find support from the observations in the Court\njudgments and Justice Malimath Committee's report on Reforms of\nCriminal Justice System) are: Once a complaint (FIR) is lodged with the\nPolice under\n s.498A\n/\n406\n IPC, it becomes an easy tool in the hands of the\nPolice to arrest or threaten to arrest the husband and other relatives\nnamed in the FIR without even considering the intrinsic worth of the\nallegations and making a preliminary investigation. When the members\nof a family are arrested and sent to jail without even the immediate\nprospect of bail, the chances of amicable re-conciliation or salvaging the\nmarriage, will be lost once and for all. The possibility of reconciliation, it\nis pointed out, cannot be ruled out and it should be fully explored. The\nimminent arrest by the Police will thus be counter-productive. The long\nand protracted criminal trials lead to acrimony and bitterness in the\nrelationship among the kith and kin of the family. Pragmatic realities\nhave to be taken into consideration while dealing with matrimonial\nmatters with due regard to the fact that it is a sensitive family problem\nwhich shall not be allowed to be aggravated by over-zealous/callous\nactions on the part of the Police by taking advantage of the harsh\nprovisions of\n s.498A\n of IPC together with its related provisions in \nCrPC\n.\nIt is pointed out that the sting is not in s.498A as such, but in the\nprovisions of \nCrPC\n making the offence non-compoundable and non-\nbailable.\n7. The arguments, on the other hand, in support of maintaining the\nstatus quo are briefly:\n S.498A and other legislations like \nProtection of Women from\n Domestic Violence Act\n have been specifically enacted to protect a\n vulnerable section of the society who have been the victims of\n cruelty and harassment. The social purpose behind it will be lost if\n the rigour of the provision is diluted. The abuse or misuse of law\n is not peculiar to this provision. The misuse can however be\n curtailed within the existing framework of law. For instance, the\n Ministry of Home Affairs can issue 'advisories' to State\n Governments to avoid unnecessary arrests and to strictly observe\n the procedures laid down in the law governing arrests. The power\n to arrest should only be exercised after a reasonable satisfaction is\n reached as to the bona fides of a complaint and the complicity of\n those against whom accusations are made. Further, the first\n recourse should be to effect conciliation and mediation between the\n warring spouses and the recourse to filing of a chargesheet under\n s.498A shall be had only in cases where such efforts fail and there\n appears to be a prima facie case. Counselling of parties should be\n done by professionally qualified counsellors and not by the Police."

      "text": "45\n 7.1 These views have been echoed among others by the Ministry of\nWomen and Child Development.\n7.2 Further, it is pointed out that a married woman ventures to go to\nthe Police station to make a complaint against her husband and other\nclose relations only out of despair and being left with no other remedy\nagainst cruelty and harassment. In such a situation, the existing law\nshould be allowed to take its own course rather than over-reacting to the\nmisuse in some cases.\n7.3 There is also a view expressed that when once the offending family\nmembers get the scent of the complaint, there may be further torture of\nthe complainant and her life and liberty may be endangered if the Police\ndo not act swiftly and sternly. It is contended that in the wake of ever\nincreasing crimes leading to unnatural deaths of women in marital\nhomes, any dilution of Section 498-A is not warranted. Secondly, during\nthe long-drawn process of mediation also, she is vulnerable to threats\nand torture. Such situations too need to be taken care of.\n8. There is preponderance of opinion in favour of making the said\noffence compoundable with the permission of the court. Some States,\nfor e.g., Andhra Pradesh have already made it compoundable. The\nSupreme Court, in a recent case of --*---, observed that it should be\nmade compoundable. However, there is sharp divergence of views on the\npoint whether it should be made a bailable offence. It is pleaded by some\nthat the offence under s.498A should be made bailable at least with\nregard to husband's relations.*Ramgopal v. State of M. P. in SLP (Crl.)\nNo. 6494 of 2010 (Order dt. July 30, 2010.\n8.1 Those against compoundability contend that the women especially\nfrom the rural areas will be pressurized to enter into an unfair\ncompromise and further the deterrent effect of the provision will be lost.\n9. The Commission is of the view that the Section together with its\nallied \nCrPC\n provisions shall not act as an instrument of oppression and\ncounter-harassment and become a tool of indiscreet and arbitrary\nactions on the part of the Police. The fact that s.498A deals with a family\nproblem and a situation of marital discord unlike the other crimes\nagainst society at large, cannot be forgotten. It does not however mean\nthat the Police should not appreciate the grievance of the complainant\nwoman with empathy and understanding or that the Police should play a\npassive role.\n10. S.498A has a lofty social purpose and it should remain on the\nStatute book to intervene whenever the occasion arises. Its object and\npurpose cannot be stultified by overemphasizing its potentiality for abuse\nor misuse. Misuse by itself cannot be a ground to repeal it or to take\naway its teeth wholesale.\n11. While the Commission is appreciative of the need to discourage\nunjustified and frivolous complaints and the scourge of over-implication,\nit is not inclined to take a view that dilutes the efficacy of s.498A to the\nextent of defeating its purpose especially having regard to the fact that\n 46\n atrocities against women are on the increase. A balanced and holistic\nview has to be taken on weighing the pros and cons. There is no doubt a\nneed to address the misuse situations and arrive at a rational solution -\nlegislative or otherwise.\n12. There is also a need to create awareness of the provisions\nespecially among the poor and illiterate living in rural areas who face\nquite often the problems of drunken misbehavior and harassment of\nwomen folk. More than the women, the men should be apprised of the\npenal provisions of law protecting the women against harassment at\nhome. The easy access of aggrieved women to the Taluka and District\nlevel Legal Service Authorities and/or credible NGOs with professional\ncounsellors should be ensured by appropriate measures. There should\nbe an extensive and well-planned campaign to spread awareness.\nPresently, the endeavour in this direction is quite minimal. Visits to few\nvillages once in a way by the representatives of LSAs, law students and\nsocial workers is the present scenario.\n13. There is an all-round view that the lawyers whom the aggrieved\nwomen or their relations approach in the first instance should act with a\nclear sense of responsibility and objectivity and give suitable advice\nconsistent with the real problem diagnosed. Exaggerated and tutored\nversions and unnecessary implication of husband's relations should be\nscrupulously avoided. The correct advice of the legal professionals and\nthe sensitivity of the Police officials dealing with the cases are very\nimportant, and if these are in place, undoubtedly, the law will not take a\ndevious course. Unfortunately, there is a strong feeling that some\nlawyers and police personnel have failed to act and approach the\nproblem in a manner morally and legally expected of them.\n14. Thus, the triple problems that have cropped up in the course of\nimplementation of the provision are:(a) the police straightaway rushing to\narrest the husband and even his other family members (named in the\nFIR), (b) tendency to implicate, with little or no justification, the in-laws\nand other relations residing in the marital home and even outside the\nhome, overtaken by feelings of emotion and vengeance or on account of\nwrong advice, and (c) lack of professional, sensitive and empathetic\napproach on the part of the police to the problem of woman under\ndistress.\n15. In the context of the issue under consideration, a reference to the\nprovisions of \nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005\n (for\nshort PDV Act) which is an allied and complementary law, is quite\napposite. The said Act was enacted with a view to provide for more\neffective protection of rights of women who are victims of violence of any\nkind occurring within the family. Those rights are essentially of civil\nnature with a mix of penal provisions. \nSection 3\n of the Act defines\ndomestic violence in very wide terms. It encompasses the situations set\nout in the definition of 'cruelty' under Section 498A. \nThe Act\n has devised\nan elaborate machinery to safeguard the interests of women subjected to\n 47\n domestic violence. \nThe Act\n enjoins the appointment of Protection\nOfficers who will be under the control and supervision of a Judicial\nMagistrate of First Class. The said officer shall send a domestic incident\nreport to the Magistrate, the police station and service providers. The\nProtections Officers are required to effectively assist and guide the\ncomplainant victim and provide shelter, medical facilities, legal aid etc.\nand also act on her behalf to present an application to the Magistrate for\none or more reliefs under the Act. The Magistrate is required to hear the\napplication ordinarily within 3 days from the date of its receipt. The\nMagistrate may at any stage of the proceedings direct the respondent\nand/or the aggrieved person to undergo counseling with a service\nprovider. 'Service Providers' are those who conform to the requirements\nof \nSection 10\n of the Act. The Magistrate can also secure the services of a\nwelfare expert preferably a woman for the purpose of assisting him.\nUnder \nSection 18\n, the Magistrate, after giving an opportunity of hearing\nto the Respondent and on being prima facie satisfied that domestic\nviolence has taken place or is likely to take place, is empowered to pass a\nprotection order prohibiting the Respondent from committing any act of\ndomestic violence and/or aiding or abetting all acts of domestic violence.\nThere are other powers vested in the Magistrate including granting\nresidence orders and monetary reliefs. \nSection 23\n further empowers\nthe Magistrate to pass such interim order as he deems just and proper\nincluding an ex-parte order. The breach of protection order by the\nrespondent is regarded as an offence which is cognizable and non-\nbailable and punishable with imprisonment extending to one year (vide"

      "para_id": 874,
      "text": "Section 31\n). By the same Section, the Magistrate is also empowered to\nframe charges under \nSection 498A\n of IPC and/or \nDowry Prohibition Act\n.\nA Protection Officer who fails or neglects to discharge his duty as per the\nprotection order is liable to be punished with imprisonment (vide \nSection\n33\n). The provisions of the Act are supplemental to the provisions of any\nother law in force. A right to file a complaint under Section 498A is\nspecifically preserved under \nSection 5\n of the Act.\n15.1 An interplay of the provisions of this Act and the proceedings\nunder s.498A assumes some relevance on two aspects: (1) Seeking\nMagistrate's expeditious intervention by way of passing a protective\ninterim order to prevent secondary victimization of a complainant who\nhas lodged FIR under s.498A. (2) Paving the way for the process of\ncounselling under the supervision of Magistrate at the earliest\nopportunity.\n16.

Will it be counter-productive?\n 4) There is a view point supported by certain observations in the courts'\n judgments that before effecting arrest in cases of this nature, the\n proper course would be to try the process of reconciliation by\n counselling both sides. In other words, the possibility of exploring\n reconciliation at the outset should precede punitive measures.

If so, how best the\n conciliation process could be completed with utmost expedition?\n Should there be a time-limit beyond which the police shall be free\n to act without waiting for the outcome of conciliation process?\n 5) Though the Police may tender appropriate advice initially and\n facilitate reconciliation process, the preponderance of view is that the\n Police should not get involved in the actual process and their role\n should be that of observer at that stage? Do you have a different\n view?\n 6) a) In the absence of consensus as to mediators, who will be ideally\n suited to act as mediators/conciliators - the friends or elders known\n to both the parties or professional counsellors (who may be part of\n NGOs), lady and men lawyers who volunteer to act in such matters, a\n Committee of respected/retired persons of the locality or the Legal\n Services Authority of the District?\n b) How to ensure that the officers in charge of police stations can\n easily identify and contact those who are well suited to conciliate or\n mediate, especially having regard to the fact that professional and\n competent counsellors may not be available at all places and any\n delay in initiating the process will lead to further complications?\n 49\n 7) a) Do you think that on receipt of complaint under S.498A,\nimmediate steps should be taken by the Police to facilitate an\napplication being filed before the Judicial Magistrate under the PDV\nAct so that the Magistrate can set in motion the process of\ncounselling/conciliation, apart from according interim protection?\nb) Should the Police in the meanwhile be left free to arrest the\naccused without the permission of the Magistrate?\nc) Should the investigation be kept in abeyance till the conciliation\nprocess initiated by the Magistrate is completed?"

The definition of cruelty as given in the Section\nis in two parts: 1) Willful conduct of such a nature that is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\nhealth (mental or physical), 2) Harassment of the woman with a view to\ncoercing her or her relatives to meet an unlawful demand for any property or\nvaluable security. Thus the dowry related harassment as well as violent\nconduct on the part of the husband or his relations by causing injury or danger\nto her life, limb or health, are comprehended within the scope of Section 498A.\nQuite often, the prosecution under \nSection 498A\n IPC is coupled with\nprosecution under \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 as well."

However, the argument that is mainly advanced against the\ncompoundability is that the dowry is a social evil and the law designed to\npunish those who harass the wives with demand of dowry should be allowed to\ntake its full course instead of putting its seal of approval on the private\ncompromises. The social consciousness and the societal interest demands that\nsuch offences should be kept outside the domain of out-of-court settlement, it\nis argued. There can be no doubt that in dealing with this aspect, the impact of\nthe crime on the society and the degree of social harm that might result,\nshould be duly considered. At the same time, undesirable consequences that\nfollow if compounding is not allowed, ought to be kept in view because the\nsocial harm or societal interest cannot be considered in vacuum.

A rational and balanced approach is\nall the more necessary for the reason that other avenues are open to the\nreconciled couple to put an end to the criminal proceedings. One such course\nis to file a 'quash' petition under \nSection 482\n of CrPC in the High Court.\nWhether it is necessary to drive them to go through this time consuming and\ncostly process is one pertinent question. If a wife who suffered in the hands of\nthe husband is prepared to forget the past and agreeable to live amicably with\nthe husband or separate honourably without rancor or revenge, the society\nwould seldom condemn such move nor can it be said that the legal recognition\nof amicable settlement in such cases would encourage the forbidden evil i.e.\nthe dowry. Section 498A should not be allowed to become counter-productive.\nIn matters relating to family life and marital relationship, the advantages and\nbeneficent results that follow from allowing the discontinuance of legal\nproceedings to give effect to a compromise or reconciliation would outweigh the\ndegree of social harm that may be caused by non-prosecution. If the\nproceedings are allowed to go on despite the compromise arrived at by both\nsides, either there will be little scope for conviction or the life of the victim\nwould become more miserable. In what way the social good is achieved\nthereby? We repeat that a doctrinaire and isolated approach cannot be adopted\nin dealing with this issue. The sensitivity of a family dispute and the individual\nfacts and circumstances cannot be ignored. Hence, the Commission is not\ninclined to countenance the view that dowry being a social evil, compounding\nshould not be allowed under any circumstances. Incidentally, it may be\nmentioned that many offences having the potentiality of social harm, not\nmerely individual harm, are classified as compoundable offences. Further, the\ngravamen of the charge under Section 498-A need not necessarily be dowry-\nrelated harassment. It may be 'cruelty' falling only within clause (a) of the\nExplanation and the demand of dowry is not an integral part of that clause.\n5.5 Another argument against compoundability is that the permission to\ncompound would amount to legal recognition of violence against women and\nthat the factum of reconciliation cannot be a justifiable ground to legally\ncondone the violence. The acceptance of such an argument would imply that\nthe priority of law should be to take the criminal proceedings to their logical\nend and to inflict punishment on the husband irrespective of the mutual desire\nto patch up the differences. It means - reconciliation or no reconciliation, the\nhusband should not be spared of the impending prosecution and the\npunishment if any; then only Section 498A would achieve its objective. We do\nnot think that the objective of Section 498A will be better achieved by allowing\nthe prosecution to take its own course without regard to the rapprochement\nthat has taken place between the couple in conflict. As observed earlier, a\nbalanced and holistic approach is called for in handling a sensitive issue\naffecting the family and social relations. Reconciliation without compounding\nwill not be practically possible and the law should not ignore the important"

However, this\nargument may not be very substantial. The same argument can be put forward\nin respect of compoundable offences wherever the victims are women. The\nsafeguard of Court's permission would, by and large, be a sufficient check\nagainst the possible tactics that may be adopted by the husband and his\nrelations/friends. The function of the Court in this matter is not a mere\nformality. The Judicial Magistrate or Family Court Judge is expected to be\nextra-cautious and play an active role. In this regard, the judge can take the\nassistance of a woman lawyer or a professional counselor or a representative of\nLegal Services Authority and the woman concerned can be examined in his/her\nchambers in the presence of one of them. Alternatively, the assistance of a lady\ncolleague can also be sought for examining a woman victim in the chambers.\nNormally the trial Magistrates/Judges are sensitized in gender- related issues\nin the course of training at the Judicial Academies. In cities like Delhi,\nBangalore, Chennai etc. competent and trained mediators are involved in the\nprocess of bringing about an amicable settlement in marital disputes.

The process of making effort for\nreconciliation is to be initiated even at the Police Station level by taking the aid\nof respectable persons named by both parties. The counselling mechanism\nunder \nDomestic Violence Act\n can also be availed of by taking the assistance of\nprofessionally qualified counsellors appointed by State Government. The\noffence should be made bailable and compoundable. Bailability will not\nbecome in any way counter-productive. There is every need to sensitize the\npolice in these matters and only an experienced officer should be entrusted\nwith investigation. Compounding should be allowed subject to the permission\nof Court. The main reason for low conviction rate in the prosecution under\nSection 498-A is due to the fact that the allegations are exaggerated and\nbeyond facts. Crime against Women Cell (CWC) should consist of persons who\nare well educated and experienced and have orientation to deal effectively with\nmarital dispute."

The misuse or false implications\ncould be minimised by insisting on strict observance of the law of arrest as\nevolved in D.K. Basu case [(1997) 1 SCC 416)]. Secondly, the mandate of this\nlaw should be shifted from penal to restorative purpose. The recourse to\nmediation and conciliation in the first instance is the best idea. The arrest and\nother drastic legal measures should begin when all the options of restoration\nhave failed. Registering the case is the legal obligation of the Police but they\nneed not act in undue haste to effect the arrest. They should be guided by the\nspirit of Section 157 Cr. P.C. It would be worthwhile to divide the offence\nunder Section 498-A in two categories depending on the gravity of the act of\ncruelty alleged. The offence can then be categorised as bailable or non-\nbailable. Offence of milder degree may be treated as family discord and be\naddressed with an approach of reconciliation. Awareness building programmes\ninvolving statutory bodies and NGOs should be organised. The officers\nmanning women Police Stations must be given adequate training."

Secondly, the I.O. shall have\nthe power to arrest only after fulfilling the conditions laid down under the\namended \nCr.P.C\n. CWCs shall be headed by well-qualified and trained women\nInspectors.
