It would be noticed that as per the compromise deed, the\n\nmatter with regard to criminal cases as mentioned in paras 2 and 3 (supra)\n\nare also required to be compromised. However, the moot question is\n\nwhether this is permissible in law.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n4. This question is no longer res integra in view of the judgment\n\nlaid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Narinder Singh & Ors. V.\n\n.\n\nState of Punjab & Anr. JT 2014 (4) SC 573, wherein it was held as under:\n\n\"(I) Power conferred under\nSection 482\nof the Code is to be\n\ndistinguished from the power which lies in the Court to compound the\noffences under\nSection 320\nof the Code. No doubt, under\nSection 482\n\nof the Code, the High Court has inherent power to quash the criminal\nproceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable, where\n\nthe parties have settled the matter between themselves. However,\nthis power is t to be exercised sparingly and with caution.\n(II) When the parties have reached the settlement and on that\n\nbasis petition for quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the\n\nguiding factor in such cases would be to secure:\n\n(I) ends of justice, or\n(II) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.\n\nWhile exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on\n\neither of the aforesaid two objectives.\n\n(III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions which\n\ninvolve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature\n\nand have a serious impact on society. Similarly, for offences alleged\nto have been committed under special statute like the\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act\nor the of offences committed by Public Servants while\n\nworking in that capacity are not to be quashed merely on the basis of\ncompromise between the victim and the offender.\n(IV) On the other, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and\npre--dominantly civil character, particularly those arising out of\ncommercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or\nfamily disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved\ntheir entire disputes among themselves.\n\n(V) While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as\nto whether the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\nhim by not quashing the criminal cases.\n\n(VI) Offences under\nSection 307\nIPC would fall in the category of\nheinous and serious offences and therefore is to be generally treated\nas crime against the society and not against the individual alone.\nHowever, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because\nthere is a mention of\nSection 307\nIPC in the FIR or the charge is\nframed under this provision. It would be open to the High Court to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\nexamine as to whether incorporation of\nSection 307\nIPC is there for\nthe sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence,\n\n.\n\nwhich if proved, would lead to proving the charge under\nSection 307\n\nIPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the\nnature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the\nvital/delegate parts of the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical\n\nreport in respect of injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the\nguiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie analysis, the High\nCourt can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of\n\nconviction or the chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the\nformer case it can refuse to accept the settlement and quash the\ncriminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be\npermissible for the High Court to accept the plea compounding the\n\noffence based on complete settlement between the parties. At this\n\nstage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement\nbetween the parties is going to result in harmony between them which\nmay improve their future relationship.\n\n(VII) While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section\n482 of the Code or not, timings of settlement play a crucial role.\nThose cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the\n\nalleged commission of offence and the matter is still under\ninvestigation, the High Court may be liberal in accepting the\n\nsettlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is\nbecause of the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on\n\nand even the charge sheet has not been filed. Likewise, those cases\nwhere the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the\nevidence is still at infancy stage, the High Court can show\nbenevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but after prima facie\nassessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the\nother hand, where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or\nafter the conclusion of the evidence the matter is at the stage of\nargument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its\npower under Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court\nwould be in a position to decide the case finally on merits and to\ncome a conclusion as to whether the offence under\nSection 307\nIPC\nis committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is\nalready recorded by the trial court and the matter is at the appellate\nstage before the High Court, mere compromise between the parties\nwould not be a ground to accept the same resulting in acquittal of the\noffender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here\ncharge is proved under\nSection 307\nIPC and conviction is already\nrecorded of a heinous crime and, therefore, there is no question of\nsparing a convict found guilty of such a crime.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n5. It would be seen that prior to Narinder Singh's case (supra),\n\n.\n\na three Hon'ble Judges Bench had considered the relevant scope of\n\nSection 482\nand\nCr.P.C. in\nGian Singh versus State of Punjab and\n\nanother\n(2012) 10 SCC 303 wherein it was held that power of the High\n\nCourt in quashing of the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in\n\nexercise of its inherent power is distinct and different from the power of a\n\nCriminal Court for compounding offences under\nSection 320\nCr.P.C. While\n\nexercising inherent power of quashment under\nSection 482\nCr.P.C., the\n\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime and its\n\nsocial impact. It warned the Courts, the High Court for quashing\n\nproceedings in heinous and serious offences of mental depravity, murder,\n\nrape, dacoity etc.\n\nwhich principles have been reported and reaffirmed in\n\nNarinder Singh\n's case (supra).\n\n6. Now the further question remains whether this Court can\n\nquash the FIR where the petitioners have been charged under Sections\n\n341, 323, 504, 506, 452 read with\nSection 34\nIPC. This question need not\n\ndetained this Court no longer in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in Dimpey Gujral, W/o\nVivek Gujral and others versus\n\nUnion Territory\nthrough Administrator, UT, Chandigarh and others\n\n(2013) 11 SCC 497 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court seized of a case\n\nseeking quashment of FIR and its consequential proceedings wherein the\n\naccused had been charged under\nSections 147\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nIPC and the Hon'ble Supreme Court after relying upon the\n\njudgment of\nGian Singh\n's case (supra) held as follows:-\n\n\"7. In certain decisions of this court in view of the settlement\narrived at by the parties, this court quashed the FIRs though\nsome of the offences were non-compoundable. A two Judges'\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\nBench of this court doubted the correctness of those decisions.\nLearned Judges felt that in those decisions, this court had\n\n.\n\npermitted compounding of non-compoundable offences. The\n\nsaid issue was, therefore, referred to a larger bench.\n\nThe larger Bench in\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab\n(2012) 10\n\nSCC 303 considered the relevant provisions of the Code and\nthe judgments of this court and concluded as under: (SCC\npp.342-43, para 61)\n\nr to\n\"61. The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power of the\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or\n\ncomplaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct\nand different from the power given to a criminal court for\ncompounding the offences under Section 320 of the\nCode. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\n\nstatutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to\n\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\n\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be\nexercised where the offender and victim have settled\n\ntheir dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be\nprescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the nature and\ngravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of\nmental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\nvictim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.\nSuch offences are not private in nature and have serious\nimpact on society. Similarly, any compromise between\nthe victim and offender in relation to the offences under\nspecial statutes like\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the\noffences committed by public servants while working in\nthat capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for\nquashing criminal proceedings involving such offences.\nBut the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-\ndominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\npurposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\n\n.\n\nor such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n\nmatrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes\nwhere the wrong is basically private or personal in nature\n\nand the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, the High Court may quash criminal\nproceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\nbetween the offender and victim, the possibility of\n\nconviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\ncriminal case would put accused to great oppression and\nprejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him\n\nby not quashing the criminal case despite full and\n\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In\nother words, the High Court must consider whether it\nwould be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\n\ncontinue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of\nthe criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of\n\nprocess of law despite settlement and compromise\nbetween the victim and wrongdoer and whether to\n\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal\ncase is put to an end and if the answer to the above\n\nquestion(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well\nwithin its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n8. In the light of the above observations of this court in Gian\nSingh, we feel that this is a case where the continuation of\ncriminal proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of\nlaw because the alleged offences are not heinous offences\nshowing extreme depravity nor are they against the society.\nThey are offences of a personal nature and burying them would\nbring about peace and amity between the two sides. In the\ncircumstances of the case, FIR No.163 dated 26/10/2006\nregistered under\nSection 147\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC at Police Station Sector 3,Chandigarh and all\nconsequential proceedings arising there from including the final\nreport presented under Section 173 of the Code and charges\nframed by the trial court are hereby quashed.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP\n7. On the basis of the aforesaid exposition of law, this Court is of\n\nthe opinion that this is a case where the continuation of the criminal\n\n.\n\nproceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law because the\n\nalleged offences are not heinous offences showing extreme depravity nor\n\nare they against the society. They are offences of personal nature and\n\nquashing FIR and proceedings would bring out peace between two sides.\n\n8. In these circumstances, FIR No. 199/2015, dated 10.8.2015,\n\nregistered at Police Station, Sarkaghat, District Mandi under\nSections 341\n,\n,\n,\nIPC by Smt. Bimla Devi( petitioner herein) against the\n\nrespondent No.2 (herein) and criminal case pending in the Court of Ld.\n\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sarkaghat, District Mandi, under\n\nSections 341\n,\nand\nIPC and private complaint No. 19 of 2015 titled\n\nas Parhalad Chand vs. Bimla Devi and others, pending in the Court of Ld.\n\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sarkaghat, District Mandi, under\n\nSections 323, 452, 504, 506 read with\nSection 34\nof IPC against Smt.\n\nBimla Devi and others, are quashed. Resultantly, all the consequential\n\nproceedings emanating from the aforesaid FIR and private complaint are\n\nalso quashed.\n\n9. The petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms, so also\n\nthe pending application(s) if any. The parties are left to bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n10. However, before parting, the Court places on record its\n\ngratitude for the valuable assistance rendered by learned Mediator Shri\n\nS.C. Sharma, Advocate in bringing the aforesaid compromise between\n\nthe parties.\n\nAugust 1, 2017. (Tarlok Singh Chauhan),\n(GR) Judge.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 03/08/2017 23:56:54 :::HCHP",
