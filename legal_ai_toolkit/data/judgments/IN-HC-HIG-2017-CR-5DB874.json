Briefly stated facts, as emerged from the record are\n\nthat complainant namely Om Prakash (PW-5) got recorded his\n\nstatement under\nSection 154\nCr.P.C., before the police that on\n\nthe intervening night of 6.10.2009 and 7.10.2009, at about\n\n1:30 AM, petitioner-accused(hereinafter referred to as the\n\naccused) committed theft of three tyres of the vehicles i.e.\n\nMaruti Alto Car bearing No.HP-20C-6835 owned by one\n\nHemant Kumar and Maruti Van No.HP-14-A-4589 of Sh. Manoj\n\nKumar at Surya Vihar, Rajgarh Road, Solan, Tehsil and\n\nDistrict Solan, H.P. He further reported to the police that on\n\nthe intervening night of 6.10.2009 and 7.10.2009, he was\n\nperforming duty of Chowkidar at Surya Apartments, Surya\n\nVihar, Rajgarh Road, Solan and he stopped the accused from\n\nremoving the tyres from the vehicles, as referred above.\n\nComplainant after noticing the aforesaid theft, informed Sh.\n\nManoj Kumar, who happened to be owner of Maruti Van No.\n\nHP-14-A-4589 and thereafter police was also informed\n\nregarding the incident. On the basis of aforesaid statement of\n\nthe complainant Om Prakash (PW-5), under\nSection 154\n\nCr.P.C., FIR No. 267/2009, dated 7.10.2009 under\nSection 379\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nof\nIPC\nwas registered against the accused at Police Station,\n\nSadar, District Solan, H.P. Police after completion of the\n\ninvestigation, presented the challan in the competent Court of\n\n.\n\nlaw.\n\n3. Learned trial Court after satisfying itself that a\n\nprima-facie case exists against the accused, framed charge\n\nunder\nSections 379\nof IPC against the accused, to which he\n\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n\n4. Learned trial Court on the basis of the evidence\n\nmade available on record by the prosecution, found accused\n\nguilty of having committed the offence punishable under\n\nSections 379\nof IPC and accordingly convicted and sentenced\n\nhim, as per the description given hereinabove.\n\n5. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n\nimpugned judgment/order dated 14.12.2011/27.12.2011,\n\npassed by learned trial Court, present petitioner-accused filed\n\nan appeal under\nSection 374(3)\nof the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure before the learned Sessions Judge, Solan, which\n\ncame to be registered as Criminal Appeal No. 14-S/10 of 2012,\n\nhowever fact remains that aforesaid appeal filed by the\n\npetitioner-accused was dismissed, as a result of which,\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the\n\nlearned trial Court came to be upheld. In the aforesaid\n\nbackground, present petitioner-accused approached this Court\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nby way of instant criminal revision petition, praying therein for\n\nhis acquittal after quashing and setting-aside the impugned\n\njudgments passed by the learned courts below.\n\n.\n\n6. Mr. C.S.Thakur, learned counsel representing the\n\npetitioner-accused, vehemently argued that the impugned\n\njudgments passed by the courts below are not sustainable in\n\nthe eyes of law as the same are not based upon the correct\n\nappreciation of evidence adduced on record by the respective\n\nparties and as such, same deserve to be quashed and set-\n\naside. Mr. Thakur, while inviting attention of this Court to the\n\nimpugned judgments stated that bare perusal of the same\n\nsuggest that both the courts below have failed to appreciate the\n\nevidence in its right perspective, as a result of which,\n\nerroneous findings to the detriment of the petitioner-accused\n\nhave come on record, who is admittedly an innocent person.\n\nMr. Thakur, also made this Court to travel through the\n\nevidence led on record by the prosecution to demonstrate that\n\nno conviction, if any, could be recorded on the basis of the\n\nstatements having been made by so called material witnesses\n\nbecause none of the material prosecution witnesses stated\n\nsomething specific with regard to removal of the tyres by the\n\npetitioner-accused in their presence. Mr. Thakur, while\n\nreferring to the statements of the witnesses also stated that\n\nthere are material contradictions in the statements of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nprosecution witnesses and as such, no conviction, if any, could\n\nbe recorded against the present petitioner-accused on the basis\n\nof the aforesaid statements. In the aforesaid background,\n\n.\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner prayed that present\n\npetitioner-accused may be acquitted of the charge after setting\n\naside and quashing the impugned judgments passed by the\n\nlearned Courts below.\n\n7. Mr. Ramesh Thakur, learned Deputy Advocate\n\nGeneral, supported the impugned judgments passed by both\n\nthe Courts below. While refuting the aforesaid contention\n\nhaving been made by learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.\n\nThakur, contended that bare perusal of the impugned\n\njudgment passed by both the courts below suggest that same\n\nare based upon the correct appreciation of the evidence\n\nadduced on record by the prosecution and as such, there is no\n\nscope of interference, whatsoever, of this court, especially in\n\nview of the concurrent findings of fact and law recorded by the\n\ncourts below. Mr. Thakur, with a view to refute the aforesaid\n\ncontention having been made by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, invited attention of this court to the evidence led on\n\nrecord by the prosecution to demonstrate that case against the\n\npetitioner-accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt\n\nby the prosecution and bare perusal of the impugned judgment\n\npassed by both the Courts below suggest that learned courts\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nbelow have dealt with each and every aspect of the matter very\n\nmeticulously and there is no scope of interference whatsoever,\n\nin view of the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the\n\n.\n\nlearned Courts below. Mr. Thakur, also submitted that while\n\nexercising revisional jurisdiction, Court has very limited\n\npowers to re-appreciate the evidence available on record.\n\nLearned Deputy Advocate General, has placed reliance upon\n\nthe judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in case\nState of\n\nKerala versus Puttumana Illath Jathavedan Namboodiri\n\n(1999)2 Supreme Court Cases 452.\n\n8. In the aforesaid background, Mr. Thakur prayed\n\nthat the present petition deserves to be dismissed being devoid\n\nof any merit.\n\n9. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and\n\nhave carefully gone through the record made available.\n\n10. As far as scope of power of this Court while\n\nexercising revisionary jurisdiction under\nSection 397\nis\n\nconcerned, the Hon' ble Apex Court in Krishnan and\n\nanother Versus Krishnaveni and another, (1997) 4\n\nSupreme Court Case241; has held that in case Court notices\n\nthat there is a failure of justice or misuse of judicial\n\nmechanism or procedure, sentence or order is not correct, it is\n\nsalutary duty of the High Court to prevent the abuse of the\n\nprocess or miscarriage of justice or to correct irregularities/\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nincorrectness committed by inferior criminal court in its\n\njudicial process or illegality of sentence or order. The relevant\n\npara of the judgment is reproduced as under:-\n\n.\n\n\"8. The object of\nSection 483\nand the purpose behind\nconferring the revisional power under\nSection 397\nread\nwith\nSection 401\n, upon the High Court is to invest\n\ncontinuous supervisory jurisdiction so as to prevent\nmiscarriage of justice or to correct irregularity of the\nprocedure or to mete out justice. In addition, the inherent\npower of the High Court is preserved by\nSection 482\n. The\n\npower of the High Court, therefore, is very wide. However,\nthe High Court must exercise such power sparingly and\ncautiously when the Sessions Judge has simultaneously\n\nexercised revisional power under\nSection 397(1)\n. However,\n\nwhen the High Court notices that there has been failure of\njustice or misuse of judicial mechanism or procedure,\nsentence or order is not correct, it is but the salutary duty\n\nof the High Court to prevent the abuse of the process or\nmiscarriage of justice or to correct irregularities/\nincorrectness committed by inferior criminal court in its\n\njudicial process or illegality of sentence or order.\"\n\n11. During the proceedings of the case, this Court had\n\nan occasion to peruse the impugned judgments as well as\n\nentire evidence led on record by the prosecution, perusal\n\nwhereof, certainly suggest that courts below have not\n\nappreciated the evidence in its right perspective, rather there\n\nhas been total misreading and misappreciation of evidence, as\n\na result of which, erroneous findings have come on record.\n\n12. In the instant case, prosecution with a view to\n\nprove its case examined as many as six witnesses. PW-1,Sh.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nHemant Kumar, PW-2, Sh. Manoj Kumar and PW-5, Sh. Om\n\nPrakash (complainant) appears to be eye witnesses in the\n\ninstant case. Apart from above, prosecution also examined\n\n.\n\nPW-3, H.C, Chander Mohan, PW-4, ASI Shanti Swroop\n\n(Investigating Officer) and PW-6, Raj Kumar. The statements\n\nhaving been made by aforesaid witnesses may not be of much\n\nrelevance as far as adjudication of the present case is\n\nconcerned because admittedly none of them were present at\n\nthe time of occurrence. PW-5, Om Prakash deposed before the\n\ncourt below that on the night of 7.10.2009 at about 1:30 AM\n\nwhile patrolling in and around parking area he saw accused\n\nremoving tyres from Maruti Van No. HP-14-A-4589. He also\n\nstated that he saw that tyres of Maruti Alto Car No. HP-20-C-\n\n6835 had been removed. Aforesaid prosecution witness further\n\nstated that immediately after noticing removal of tyres of\n\naforesaid cars, he informed Manoj Kumar i.e. owner of Maruti\n\nVan No.HP-14-A-4589 and thereafter police was also informed\n\ntelephonically. It has also come in his statement that thereafter\n\naccused was apprehended on the spot and handed over to the\n\npolice and thereafter stolen articles were recovered and taken\n\ninto possession. PW-1, Sh. Hemant Kumar and PW-2, Sh.\n\nManoj Kumar corroborated the aforesaid version put forth by\n\nthe complainant namely Sh. Om Prakash.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\n13. PW-2, Manoj Kuamr stated that on the night of\n\n6.10.2009 at about 1:30 AM, he received a telephonic call from\n\nthe complainant disclosing that someone had removed tyres\n\n.\n\nfrom his van and accordingly he went to the spot and found\n\nthat accused had been apprehended by the complainant. He\n\nalso stated that thereafter matter was reported to the police\n\nand stolen tyres alongwith tools were taken into possession\n\nvide seizure memo Ex.PW1/A. PW-2, Sh. Manoj Kumar also\n\nmade similar statement as of PW-1, Sh. Hemant Kumar.\n\n14. Conjoint reading of the statements of aforesaid\n\nwitnesses certainly compels this Court to agree with the\n\nsubmissions having been made by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner that no conviction, if any, could be recorded on the\n\nbasis of aforesaid statements having been made by these\n\nprosecution witnesses because of material contradictions in\n\ntheir statements.\n\n15. PW-5, Om Prakash stated that he had\n\ntelephonically informed Manoj Kumar, who came on the spot\n\nand thereafter Manoj Kumar informed Hemant Kumar, the\n\nowner of the another vehicle telephonically. PW-2, Manoj\n\nKumar stated that he had parked his vehicle bearing\n\nregistration No. HP-14-1-4589 on the road near Surya Vihar at\n\nabout 8:00 PM. He further stated that at about 1:30 AM, he\n\nreceived telephonic call from Om Prakash Chowkidar that the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\ntyre of his vehicle has been removed, at which he rushed to the\n\nspot and saw that front tyre of his vehicle has been removed\n\nalongwith the rear tyre of the Alto car bearing registration No.\n\n.\n\nHP-20-C-6835, which was parked near his vehicle. He also\n\nstated that he telephonically informed Hemant Kumar i.e.\n\nowner of another vehicle. In the cross-examination, PW-1 and\n\nPW-2 have admitted that they did not see the accused\n\nremoving the tyres.\n\n16. Interestingly, there is no explanation available on\n\nrecord that how complainant Om Prakash PW-5, who\n\nhappened to be Chowkidar of Suraya Apartments, Solan could\n\nknow the telephone numbers of these prosecution witnesses\n\ni.e. Manoj Kumar and Hemant Kumar because admittedly\n\nPW-5, nowhere stated that he had prior acquaintance with the\n\naforesaid witnesses. Similarly, there is nothing in the\n\nstatements of PW-1 and PW-2 that they had some\n\nacquaintance with Sh. Om Prakash (PW-5). There is nothing in\n\nthe statement of PW-5 that he noted telephone numbers of\n\nPW-1 and PW-2 from some document lying in the front window\n\nof the cars. If, statement of PW-5 is carefully perused, he\n\nnowhere states that he saw the petitioner-accused removing\n\ntyres, rather it has come in his statement that while patrolling\n\nhe noticed that front tyre of Maruti Car No. HP-14-A 4589 was\n\nremoved. It has nowhere come in his statement that\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nimmediately after noticing removal of the tyre, he apprehended\n\nthe petitioner-accused, rather his statement suggests that after\n\nnoticing the removal of tyres from the cars, he informed PW-1,\n\n.\n\nwho further informed PW-2, who admittedly reached the spot\n\nafter 35 minutes of the call having been made by PW-5. Once,\n\nPW-5 had seen the petitioner accused removing tyres, it is not\n\nbelievable that despite that petitioner-accused remained at the\n\nspot and not made an effort to run away from the spot of\n\noccurrence because PW-5 has not stated that immediately after\n\nnoticing removal of the tyre he apprehended the petitioner\n\naccused, rather all the prosecution witnesses stated that they\n\nreached at the spot and apprehended the petitioner-accused.\n\n17. Leaving everything aside, none of these material\n\nwitnesses as cited by the prosecution stated something specific\n\nwith regard to removal of tyres by the petitioner-accused,\n\nrather PW-1 and PW-2 in their cross-examination categorically\n\nadmitted that they did not see the petitioner accused removing\n\ntyres from their cars. Apart from above, it is not understood\n\nthat when the complainant PW-5 saw the petitioner-accused\n\nremoving tyre from the car, why he did not raise any alarm,\n\nespecially when incident occurred near residential colony.\n\n18. This Court after having carefully examined the\n\nstatements having been made by these prosecution witnesses,\n\nhas no hesitation to conclude that courts below have not\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nappreciated the evidence in its right perspective and there is no\n\ndiscussion/analysis, as such of the evidence in the judgment\n\npassed by the learned trial court while holding the petitioner\n\n.\n\naccused guilty of having committed the offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 379\nof IPC. Bare perusal of the judgment passed\n\nby the courts below suggest that while holding petitioner\n\naccused guilty of having committed the offence, it has simply\n\nplaced reliance upon\nthe statement of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-5\n\nwithout critically analyzing their statements in view of the\n\ndefence put forth by the petitioner-accused, who categorically\n\nin his statement recorded under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. stated\n\nthat he has been falsely implicated in the case. Admittedly,\n\nthere are material contradictions in the statements having\n\nbeen made by the prosecution witnesses and by no stretch of\n\nimagination same could be termed to be cogent and convincing\n\nevidence, which could enable to court below to record\n\nconviction of the petitioner accused under\nSection 379\nof IPC.\n\n19. After perusing the statements of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses as well exhibits placed on record, two views are\n\npossible in the present case and as such, the petitioner-\n\naccused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. The learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner-accused has placed reliance on the judgment\n\npassed by Hon'ble Apex Court reported in State of UP versus\n\nGhambhir Singh & others, AIR 2005 (92) Supreme Court\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\n2439, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that if on the\n\nsame evidence, two views are reasonably possible, the one in\n\nfavour of the accused must be preferred. The relevant\n\n.\n\nparagraph is reproduced as under:-\n\n\"6. So far as Hori Lal, PW-1 is concerned, he had\nbeen sent to fetch a basket from the village and it\n\nwas only a matter of coincidence that while he\nwas returning he witnessed the entire incident.\nThe High Court did not consider it safe to rely on\nhis testimony because he evidence clearly shows\nthat he had an animus against the appellants.\n\nMoreover, his evidence was not corroborated by\nobjective circumstances. Though it was his\ncategorical case that all of them fired, no injury\ncaused by rifle was found, and, only two wounds\n\nwere found on the person of the deceased. Apart\nfrom this PW-3 did not mention the presence of\n\neither PW-1 or PW-2 at the time of occurrence. All\nthese circumstances do create doubt about the\ntruthfulness of the prosecution case. The\npresence of these three witnesses becomes\ndoubtful if their evidence is critically scrutinized.\n\nMay be it is also possible to take a view in favour\nof the prosecution, but since the High Court, on an\nappreciation of the evidence on record, has\n\nrecorded a finding in favour of the accused, we do\nnot feel persuaded to interfere with the order of\nthe High Court in an appeal against acquittal. It\n\nis well settled that if on the same evidence two\nviews are reasonably possible, the one in favour of\nthe accused must be preferred.\"\n\n20. The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court vide\n\njudgment reported in Pawan Kumar and Kamal Bhardwaj\n\nversus State of H.P., latest HLJ 2008 (HP) 1150 has also\n\nconcluded here-in-below:-\n\n\"25. Moreover, when the occurrence is admitted\nbut there are two different versions of the\nincident, one put forth by the prosecution and the\nother by the defence and one of the two version is\nproved to be false, the second can safely be\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP\nbelieved, unless the same is unnatural or\ninherently untrue.\n\n26. In the present case, as noticed hereinabove,\nthe manner of occurrence, as pleaded by the\ndefence, is not true. The manner of the\n\n.\n\noccurrence testified by PW-11 Sandeep Rana is not\n\nunnatural nor is it intrinsically untrue, therefore,\nit has to be believed.\n\n27.Sandeep Rana could not be said to have been\n\nestablished, even if the prosecution version were\ntaken on its face value. It was pleaded that no\nserious injury had been caused to PW-11 Sandeep\nRana and that all the injuries, according to the\ntestimony of PW-21 Dr. Raj Kumar, which he\n\nnoticed on the person of Sandeep Rana, at the\ntime of his medical examination, were simple in\nnature.\n\n21. Consequently, in view of the aforesaid discussion,\n\nthis Court has no hesitation to conclude that the judgment\n\npassed by both the Courts below are not based on correct\n\nappreciation of evidence available on record and as such, same\n\nare quashed and set-aside. Accused is acquitted of the charge.\n\nHis bail bonds are discharged. The fine amount, if any\n\ndeposited by the petitioner accused be refunded to him.\n\nThe present criminal revision petition stands\n\ndisposed of, so also pending application(s), if any.\n\n(Sandeep Sharma)\n15th May, 2017 Judge.\n(shankar)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 20/05/2017 23:59:13 :::HCHP",
