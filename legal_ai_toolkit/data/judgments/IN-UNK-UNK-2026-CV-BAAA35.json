Sudhakar, Administrative Member\n\n COMMON ORDER\n\n {As per Hon'ble Mr. B.V. Sudhakar, Administrative Member}\n\n2. The OAs are filed challenging the notification dated 26.7.2017 read with\n\nthe integrated seniority list issued vide lr dt. 18.7.2017 in the context of the\n\nTribunal order in OA 1263/2010 and those of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P\n 6 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nNo. 9942/2014 and C.C No.166/2016 in W.P. No. 9942/2014. The relief sought\n\nand the respondents being one and the same, a common order is issued.\n\n3. Applicants who belong to the UR category while working as Senior\n\nSection Engineers in the respondents' organisation were considered for\n\npromotion to the Group B post of Asst Exec. Engineer/Assistant Div. Engineer\n\n(for brevity Asst. Engineers -AE), as they were in the zone of consideration in\n\nrespect of UR vacancies against 70% quota in pursuance of 2010 notification\n\nto fill up 22 vacancies with the breakup of 12 UR, 8 SC and 2 ST vacancies\n\nrespectively. Applicants after qualifying in the written exam, viva voce and\n\nmedical tests with the aggregate qualifying mark were not empanelled in the\n\nselect panel dt. 3.12.2010, on the grounds that the UR vacancies were filled up\n\nby SC/ST employees. Of the 12 UR vacancies, 6 were filled by SC/ST\n\nemployees as per the select panel dt 3.12.2010 based on the principle of own\n\nmerit albeit they were juniors to the applicants. The promotion of junior SC/ST\n\nemployees being an eye sore was challenged in OA 1263/2010. Besides, after\n\nenlisting 6 SC/ST candidates against UR vacancies, 2 SC and 1 ST employee\n\nrespectively were selected against SC/ST roster points, leaving 6 SC and 1 ST\n\nvacancy unfilled for want of qualified candidates. The 6 SC/ST candidates who\n\nwere adjusted against UR vacancies were made private respondents in OA\n\n1263/2010 which was allowed on 30.8.2013, by ordering that the applicants\n\nbeing senior and qualified need to be considered. The orders of the Tribunal\n\nwere challenged in the Hon'ble High court of Judicature at Hyderabad in W.P.\n\nNo.9942/2014 and WP No. 15138/2014. Hon'ble High court dealt with the\n\nabove 2 W.Ps along with others in regard to the issue of reservation in\n\npromotions at length by referring to the Hon'ble Supreme Court Judgments in\n\nM.Nagaraj, U.P Power Corporation, K. Manorama and on 29.4.2015 upheld the\n 7 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\norders of the Tribunal to the extent of declaring the action of the respondents in\n\nproviding reservation in promotion without fulfilling the parameters laid down in\n\nM.Nagaraj as incorrect. Hon'ble High court has also directed the respondents to\n\ncomplete the exercise of gathering data, and forming its opinion on the\n\nparameters laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Nagaraj within 6\n\nmonths, leaving it open to the respondents in the interregnum period to make in-\n\ncharge arrangements purely as a temporary measure till an opinion is formed in\n\nregard to reservation in promotion in consonance with Nagaraj judgment. As the\n\nrespondents did not rescind the promotion of private respondents despite\n\nHon'ble High Court orders contempt petition was filed vide Contempt Case\n\nNo.166 of 2016 in WP no 9942 of 2014. In the meanwhile respondents issued an\n\norder dated 24.6.2015 indicating that the promotion of the private respondents\n\nagainst UR vacancies in the panel dated 3.12.2010 has to be treated as purely\n\nadhoc/in-charge basis till further orders. Hon'ble High court while disposing of\n\nthe contempt petition on 23.3.2016 observed that the permission granted to\n\nmake in-charge arrangements did not enable the respondents to cause adhoc\n\npromotion or regularise the promotion made earlier and that even if promotions\n\nwere to be regularised the same shall be from a date after the collection of data\n\nand not preceding it. The contempt was closed after the respondents issued a\n\ncorrigendum stating that the adhoc promotion given was treated as in-charge\n\narrangement and the orders of regularisation were withdrawn along with\n\ntendering an unconditional apology. Applicants did file another CP bearing No.\n\n020/170 of 2014 in OA 1263/2010 before the Tribunal, which was closed giving\n\nliberty to the applicants to revive the same, if necessary, after the expiry of the\n\ntime granted to implement the order of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P No.9942\n\nof 2014 dated 29.4.2015.\n\n 8 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n4. The contentions of the applicants are that the Hon'ble High Court has\n\ngiven 6 months time to continue the in-charge arrangements from the date of\n\nreceipt of the order dt 29.4.2015 in WP 9942/2014 but the in-charge\n\narrangements made on 24.6.2015 were continued beyond the said period\n\ngranting pay fixation benefits as per 7th \nCPC\n, as if the original promotions given\n\nby the respondents were undisturbed as AEs. Not only pay fixation but the\n\nemployees were upgraded to the next higher grade of senior scale based on the\n\nroster point of SC/ST on the grounds that they were regularly working as AEs in\n\nGroup B cadre, which is against the office order dated 24.6.2015. Consequent to\n\nissue of the office order dated 24.6.2015 Contempt Petition No.166 of 2016 was\n\nclosed and since the respondents have acted against the office order cited a\n\nMiscellaneous Petition No.253 of 2017 was filed to recall the order dated\n\n3.3.2016 in CP referred to. The same is under adjudication. The junior SC/ST\n\nemployees who were supposed to be working on in charge basis are being\n\ncontinued on a regular basis and one of them by name Sri Thangaiyan has retired\n\non 31.7.2016 with retiral benefits as are allowed to regularly promoted\n\nemployees in the said cadre. In addition, respondents issued an integrated\n\nseniority list of Senior Section Engineers which is the feeder cadre to AEs, in\n\nwhich the names of the 6 SC/ST employees were not shown implying that the\n\nsaid employees were regularly promoted and not on in-charge basis as AEs in\n\nutter disregard of the office order dt.24.6.2015 issued with the purported\n\nintention of complying with the observations of the Hon'ble High Court in the\n\nW.P no. 9942/2014 and the corresponding contempt petition 166/2016.\n\nApplicants represented on 22.7.2017 requesting that the junior SC/ST employees\n\nwho were made AEs on in-charge basis be shown as juniors in the Integrated\n\nSeniority list of the Sr section Engineer and that their names should replace the\n 9 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nSC/ST employees in the panel dated 3.12.2010. Further, the SC/ ST employees\n\nhave to appear for selection in case they have to be promoted on a regular basis.\n\nInstead of acting on the representations of the applicants, respondents issued two\n\nnotifications on 26.7.2017, one proposing to hold a selection to fill up 26\n\nvacancies of AEs against 70% quota with the communal break up of 7 SC, 1 ST\n\nand 18 UR and the other notification was to cancel the notification dt 2.1.2013\n\nby referring to WP 16280 of 2014 relating to OA 203/2013 filed by UR\n\nemployees challenging the notification dt. 2.1.2013 in regard to the issue of\n\nreservation in promotions. The OA 203/2013 was allowed and the WP\n\n16280/2014 was decided along with other WPs on 29.4.2015 by the Hon'ble\n\nHigh court. Applicants further contend that the respondents have concealed the\n\nfact, that the Hon'ble High Court in WPMP 39928/2016 through which some\n\nUR employees impleaded themselves in WP 11724/2013 filed by some SC/ST\n\nemployees, consequent to their filing OA 392/2013 seeking extension of the\n\nzone of consideration for promotion to AEs against 70% quota in notification dt\n\n2.1.2013 being dismissed by the Tribunal, has ordered that the 8 vacancies listed\n\nin the notification dt 2.1.2013 which was a subject matter of OA 203/2013,\n\nshould be treated as UR vacancies. Therefore, instead of considering the\n\napplicants in OA 1263/2010 for the UR vacancies by revising the select panel dt\n\n3.12.2010 showing them in the zone of consideration for AE promotion in the\n\nnotification issued on 26.7.2017 is blatantly illegal. More than being illegal it\n\nwould imply that the applicants in OA 1263/2010 would have to again appear for\n\nselection. One more irregularity as claimed by the applicants is that the\n\nrespondents were supposed to show the 8 vacancies of 2.1.2013 notification as\n\nUR but they have shown them as 7 SC and 1 ST vacancy in the impugned\n\nnotification dated 26.7.2017 against the orders of the Hon'ble High Court in WP\n 10 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n11724/2013 on 22.12.2016. The applicants find fault with the decision of the\n\nrespondents in showing them in the zone of consideration against notification dt.\n\n26.7.2017 instead of deleting the names of the SC/ST employees from the select\n\npanel dt 3.12.2010 and showing the SC/ST employees in the zone of\n\nconsideration, if eligible as per seniority. Respondents have not settled the issue\n\nby including the names of the applicants in the panel dt 3.12.2010 even after 4\n\nyears of filing of the OA and 2 years since the Hon'ble High court decision.\n\nAnother aspect pointed out by the applicants is that the office order dated\n\n24.6.2015 was not challenged by employees who were provided with in charge\n\narrangements and the common order dt 29.4.2015 which comes in the way of the\n\nSC/ST employees enlisted against roster points of SC/ST was also not\n\nchallenged by Junior SC/ST employees listed at sl no 12 to 14 in the panel dt\n\n3.12.2010. Therefore the two aforesaid orders are binding on the respondents.\n\nApplicants cited the judgment dt 11.3.2016 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nSuresh Chand Goutham v State of Uttar Pradesh reported in WP (c) No 690 of\n\n2015, in support of their arguments. It was held in the cited judgment that no\n\nmandamus can be given to frame a rule or regulation for the purpose of\n\nreservation for SC/ST in the matter of promotion. As per the verdict of the\n\nHon'ble High Court in the Contempt petition, SC/ST employees who have been\n\ngiven promotion in the panel dt 3.12.2010 have lost the promotion since it has to\n\nbe given prospectively after collecting the data required. Therefore they have to\n\napply for selection afresh. The action of the respondents has been discriminative\n\nby extending benefit of promotion to ineligible employees and denying the same\n\nto eligible employees. Admittedly, against the clear directions of the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court.\n\n 11 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n In regard to integrated seniority list, applicants claim that it was prepared\n\nbased on consequential seniority and own merit, which is against Nagaraj\n\njudgment and undertaking given by the learned Solicitor General to the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court. Applicants quoted several Supreme Court judgments in support\n\nof their assertions.\n\n5. Respondents in their reply take objection for making the Chairman of the\n\nRailway Board as a party though no order of the Railway Board has been\n\nchallenged. Applicants are seeking a direction to promote them as AEs in Group\n\nB cadre w.e.f. 3.12.2010 after 7 years from the date of panel under the guise of\n\nnotification dt 26.7.2017 and integrated seniority list dated 18.7.2017. Therefore\n\nthe OA is time barred. Further, the instant OA is not maintainable based on the\n\nprinciple of res-judicata since the OA 1263/2010 wherein similar relief of\n\npromotion as AEs on being allowed was contested in the Hon'ble High Court\n\nand the same was decided in WP no 9942/2014 and CC no 166/2016. Similarly\n\nCP 170/2014 in OA 170/2014 was also closed by the Tribunal. Therefore\n\nnothing survives in the present OA to adjudicate. Respondents have cited the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court observation in Shankar Das v U.O.I (1991) 3 SCC 47 in\n\nsupport of their assertion that the applicants have no right to be appointed against\n\nselect list just because their names appear in the select list. \nOne another\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in union \nTerritory of Chandigarh v Dilbagh\n\nSingh and Ors\n (1993) 1 SCC 154 wherein it was held that a candidate who finds\n\na place in the select list may have no vested right to be appointed to any post, in\n\nthe absence of any specific rules entitling him to the same, he may still be\n\naggrieved of his non-appointment if the authority concerned acts arbitrarily or in\n\na malafide manner. Moreover, as per Para 205 of Railway Establishment Manual\n\nVol-1 the currency of a panel will be current for a period of 2 years from the date\n 12 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nof the approval of the competent authority or till a fresh panel on the basis of\n\nnext selection becomes available whichever is earlier. Hence the panel prepared\n\non 3.12.2010 is no longer valid and therefore applicants can make no claim to\n\ninclude their names in this panel. Coming to details, based on 2010 notification\n\nto fill up 22 vacancies of AEs, 7 SC, 1 ST and 4 UR candidates who were senior\n\nand qualified were adjusted against 12 notified UR vacancies. Against 8 SC and\n\n2 ST vacancies, 2 SC and 1 ST employee were empanelled leaving 6 SC and 1\n\nST vacancy unfilled which were carried forward to the next selection initiated\n\nvide notification dated 2.1.2013. The 15 employees were empanelled and\n\npromoted as AEs on 30.12.2010. However, some of the reserved community\n\nemployees were made as in-charge AEs as per Hon'ble High Court order and\n\nsubsequently regularised. The exercise commenced with the Tribunal allowing\n\nOA 1263/2010 on 30.8.2013 directing to promote applicants there in based on\n\noriginal seniority which was challenged in WP 9942/2014 in the Hon'ble High\n\nCourt.\n Writ petition referred to was decided directing respondents on 29.4.2015\n\nto form an opinion based on Supreme Court directives in M. Nagaraj case,\n\nwithin a period of 6 months and in the interregnum period make in charge\n\narrangements for administrative convenience. In accordance with the orders of\n\nthe Hon'ble High Court promotions ordered in favour of the private respondents\n\nin OA 1263/2010 were treated as purely adhoc /in-charge basis till further orders\n\nvide proceedings dated 24.6.2015. In the meanwhile, some of the applicants\n\nmoved the Tribunal for contempt in CP 170/2015 but since the Hon'ble High\n\nCourt has decided the matter in WP 9942/2014 & WP 39158/2013, it was closed\n\ngiving liberty to the applicant to revive the same, if necessary, after the expiry of\n\nthe time granted by the Hon'ble High Court in the said writ petitions. Chief\n\nPersonnel Officer of the respondents organisation complying with the Hon'ble\n 13 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nHigh Court Order has issued proceedings dt 9.12.2015 in regard to formation of\n\nopinion as per M.Nagraj judgment for promoting SC/ST employees as AEs and\n\nconcluded that the reservation in promotion was in order. Consequent to this\n\ndevelopment contempt in CC no 166 of 2016 was filed in Hon'ble High Court\n\nwhich was closed on 23.3.2016 keeping in view the proceedings dated 24.6.2015\n\nand 9.12.2015. Therefore orders of Hon'ble High Court being fully complied,\n\nrelief sought by the applicants to include them in panel dated 3.12.2010 is\n\ninfructuous. The 6 months time granted by the High Court in WP 9942/2014 was\n\nfor formation of opinion and not in regard to making in charge arrangements of\n\nthe SC/ST employees. \nClaim of the applicants that they will get the contempt\n\npetition reopened is not possible since it is impermissible under law as per\n\nobservation of the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nSudhir Vasudeva, Chairman CMD\n\nONGC & Ors v M. George Ravi Shekaran & Ors\n (2014) 3 SCC 373 wherein it\n\nwas held that once Tribunal disposes a contempt petition after recording its\n\nsatisfaction about compliance, it has become functus officio and therefore MA in\n\nCP for issuing further or additional directions or orders, cannot be entertained.\n\nIn the absence of any orders of the Hon'ble High Court to revert the 6 SC/ST\n\nemployees (Private respondents) or restrict their in-charge arrangements up to 6\n\nmonths in OA 1263/2010, they were continued as AEs and regularised on\n\n18.7.2017. Accordingly the pay and allowance of the promoted SC/ST\n\nemployees were regulated. Respondents also clarify that pay and allowance\n\nwould be one and the same for working as in- charge or on a regular basis. Also\n\nincluding the name of the applicants in the zone of consideration against\n\nnotification dated 26.7.2017 is in order, since the applicants were not promoted\n\nas AEs on 3.12.2010. The notification dated 2.1.2013 was cancelled in view of\n\nthe dismissal of WP 11724/2013 filed by SC/ST employees and to abide by the\n 14 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\ndecision in WP no 16280/2014 of the Hon'ble High Court vide common order\n\ndated 29.4.2015.\n\n Respondents, in regard to integrated seniority list states that they have\n\nfollowed the Railway Board instructions contained in RBE 46/2010. The\n\nrelative seniority of employees coming from different streams will be determined\n\nwith reference to length of non-fortuitous service. SC/ST employees are entitled\n\nto consequential seniority and accordingly Integrated seniority list dt. 18.7.2017\n\nwas prepared. They have quoted RBE (33/2002), RBE (29/2008), RBE\n\n(46/2010) in support of their contentions. The undertaking given by ld. Solicitor\n\nGeneral on 29.9.2016 was in regard to future promotions based on reservation\n\nand therefore, there is no violation of RBE 117/2016. Railway Board, which is\n\nthe apex body to frame policy guidelines has not issued any instructions to\n\ndeviate from the existing instructions in regard to reservation in promotion and\n\nconsequential seniority. Relief sought are plural in nature.\n\n6. Heard Ld. counsel representing respondents, SC/ST employees in OA\n\n964/2017 and the applicants. We have gone through the reply statement,\n\nrejoinder and the other documents plus the material papers submitted, in depth.\n\n7. I) The issues are about reservation in promotions and release of\n\nintegrated seniority list. The OAs have originated consequent to the observations\n\nof the Hon'ble High Court in Contempt Case No.1646 of 2015 & 166 of 2016\n\nwherein it was held as under:\n\n ―As an exercise has been undertaken by the Railways, and in terms of said\n exercise they have now effected promotions, all questions, regarding the\n manner in which the data was gathered, whether such an exercise accords\n with the law declared by the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj or not, and\n whether promotions made, after such exercise, in favour of the scheduled\n castes is valid or not, are again matters which can only be examined in\n independent proceedings, and not in proceedings under the Act.‖\n 15 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n In the context of the Hon'ble High Court observation stated supra,\n\napplicants being aggrieved that the directions in Nagaraj concerning reservations\n\nin promotion have not been followed, approached the Tribunal through the\n\ninstant OAs seeking the relief of placing them in the select panel dated 3.12.2010\n\nand quashing of the notification dated 27.7.2017 as well the integrated seniority\n\nlist issued on 18.7.2017.\n\n II) Before, going into the issue in its virgin form, preliminary\n\nobjections raised by the respondents need to be looked into.\n\n Respondents claimed that the Chairman, Railway Board should not have\n\nbeen made a party to the OA, since no Railway Board order has been challenged.\n\nTrue, no railway Board order has been challenged but the OA is all about\n\nchallenging reservation in promotion which is a policy matter. No authority other\n\nthan the Railway Board is competent to formulate a policy for the respondents\n\norganisation as per the submission of the respondents in OA Nos. 738 &\n\n964/2017. Besides, respondents need to bear in mind that Railway Board has\n\nissued RBE 117/2016 which covers the matter in question. Hence Railway Board\n\nis a proper and necessary party to the OA. Therefore, objection raised is\n\noverruled.\n\n The other preliminary objection is about the OA being time barred\n\nbecause the panel issued on 3.12.2010 cannot be called into question after 7\n\nyears. Case details bring forth the fact that the OA 1263/2010 has been admitted\n\nwithin the life span of 2 years of the select panel dated 3.12.2010, which in fact\n\nconstitutes the eye of the cyclone. The dispute on being adjudicated by the\n\nTribunal in OA 1263/2010, was dealt at length by Hon'ble High Court of\n\nJudicature at Hyderabad, on being contested by the respondents in WP No.\n 16 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n9942/2010 & batch and in the contempt petition 166/ 2016. Aggrieved that the\n\norders of the Hon'ble High Court have not been complied with, the present OA\n\nhas been filed. Besides, a Miscellaneous Petition No.253 of 2017 in regard to\n\nnon-implementation of the orders of the High Court in W.Ps. cited supra, is\n\npending adjudication by the Hon'ble High Court. Therefore, litigation lingers.\n\nThus, the OA cannot be construed to be time barred. It is alive and kicking.\n\n A corollary to the above preliminary objection is that the filing of the\n\ninstant OA is against the principle of res judicata. Respondents affirm that the\n\nissue has been settled as per orders of the Hon'ble High Court whereas\n\napplicants counter the said submission by claiming that the very genesis of the\n\ninstant OA is non compliance of Hon'ble High Court Order. Therefore, there is\n\nan inherent disagreement between the two, which has to be resolved by\n\nexamining as to which side the angel of justice showers her divine grace. Till a\n\nconclusion is arrived at, it cannot be said that the principle of res judicata was\n\ninfringed.\n\n Respondents have also cited the Hon'ble Apex Court verdict in Shankar\n\nDas v U.O.I (1991) 3 SCC 47 in support of their assertion that the applicants\n\nhave no right to be appointed against select list just because their names appear\n\nin the select list. We agree with the contention of the respondents but it should\n\nnot be forgotten that they have a right to be considered. This right is indefeasible.\n\nAlso they have quoted the observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court observation in\n\nUnion Territory of Chandigarh v Dilbagh Singh and Ors\n (1993) 1 SCC 154 to\n\nbuttress their stand. However, a specific rule namely para 203.5 of IREM which\n\nis statutory in nature has not been followed by the respondents and their action\n\nhas been alleged to be arbitrary by the applicants\n, \nthe said judgment\n is thus not\n\nrelevant to the present case.\n\n 17 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n III) Having responded to the preliminary objections, we would now\n\nfocus our attention to the nucleus of the issue namely reservation in promotions.\n\nThe issue has been prefaced with the submissions of the Ld. Counsel as under.\n\n a) Senior Counsel for the respondents :\n\nLd counsel has argued that from among the applicants in OAs 636,738 &\n\n964/2017 excepting for Sri K.Srinivas Rao who cleared the exam, others have\n\neither failed or did not appear in the exam held pursuant to the notification dated\n\n26.7.2017 and thus have no locus standi to agitate for any promotion. However,\n\nthe exam referred to was set aside in OA 486/2018 and on being challenged,\n\nHon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in WP No.37990/2018\n\nsuspended the Tribunal order and a final decision is awaited. When an order is\n\nstayed/suspended, it does not mean that the order is erased out of existence as\n\nobserved by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v.\n\nChurch of South India Trust Assn., (1992) 3 SCC 1. The order is in suspended\n\nanimation which is akin to being in coma till it is resurrected to life or put to\n\nfinal rest depending on the view taken by the Hon'ble High Court in the matter.\n\nIt exists but inoperable. Besides, applicants being aggrieved that despite Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court order being in their favour in WP 9942/2014 & batch, respondents\n\nignoring the same is a matter under scrutiny in the instant OA. Hence the\n\nsubmission of the Sr. Respondent counsel is not in the realm of reason. Sr\n\nCounsel further claims that as per the Hon'ble High Court order, requirements as\n\nstipulated in Nagaraj judgement have been adhered to and promotions granted.\n\nThe Ld. Sr. Counsel argued that since orders of the High Court have been\n\ncomplied there is nothing left in the issue to adjudicate excepting for some\n\nacademic interest. Learned counsel cited observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nin 3 cases, wherein it was held that Courts should not engage themselves in\n 18 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nissues of academic interest. Is it or not, in the present case, would be an aspect\n\nwhich will reveal itself as we progress covering the contours of the case. If\n\nrequired, Ld Sr Counsel has also submitted that 6 posts can be kept vacant till the\n\nissue is resolved so that the process of promotions can be carried on.\n\n b) Senior Counsel for the private respondents in OA 964/2017\n\nLd. senior counsel has submitted that grievances are of three types. Firstly,\n\nwhere there are reasons, secondly where there are none and thirdly where\n\nreasons exist but not projected. Instant case comes under the 3 rd category. The\n\nletter dated 9.12.2015 has not been challenged in OAs 738/2017 and 964/2017.\n\nThere are no pleadings challenging the notification dated 18.7.2017. The\n\nseniority list pertains to Group C and the private respondents promoted as AEs\n\nbelong to Group B and any challenge to Group C seniority list should not impact\n\nthe positions held by the private respondents. The SC/ST employees have been\n\npromoted as AEs on own merit. The applicants have no case as the orders of the\n\nHon'ble High Court have been complied with in promoting the private\n\nrespondents as AEs. Looks simplistic on the face of it but in the issue on hand\n\nthere are many legal connotations which demand a proper and appropriate\n\nresponse. The letter dated 9.12.2015 was issued confirming that the Chief\n\nPersonnel Officer has formed an opinion as per the dictates of Nagaraj Judgment.\n\nReservation in promotion is a policy matter, as explained above, and therefore it\n\nis for the Railway Board to formulate an opinion and not the CPO. Incidentally,\n\nthe decision of the CPO in arriving at an opinion is against the Railway Board\n\norder 117/2016. Therefore, the letter dt 9.12.2015 does not require a challenge\n\nsince it is not in accordance with rules and law. Now let us come to the\n\nintegrated seniority list of 18.7.2017. Seniority list is issued so that it becomes\n\nthe basis for career planning of the employees. Hence the rule, that objections, if\n 19 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nany, are to be obtained from the employees and then the seniority list is to be\n\nfinalised. Applicants have serious reservations in respect of integrated seniority\n\nlist on many grounds. The important one being non adherence to the pre-\n\nconditions laid in Nagraj and the OAs totally hinge on this aspect. Therefore,\n\nissues revolving around reservation in promotion be it seniority list, promotions\n\netc are encompassed by the OAs filed. At this juncture it is to be mentioned that\n\nthe promotion of the private respondents i.e. 6 SC/ST employees is still under\n\nadjudication. Therefore the presumption of the Ld. Sr. Counsel that since SC/ST\n\nemployees now belong to the elevated Group B grade and any pleading\n\nforwarded to show them in the lower grade of Group C is irrational, in our view,\n\nis not based on a logical premise. The Courts are to unveil the mask of an\n\nadministrative decision to scrutinize as to whether such a decision would\n\nwithstand a sizzling legal scrutiny. We would touch upon this aspect from\n\ndifferent dimensions as we meander through the case in the paras that follow.\n\n c) Counsel for the applicants\n\nLd counsel for the applicants has submitted that there has been flagrant violation\n\nof the orders of the Hon'ble High Court. Repeatedly respondents have been\n\ntaking decisions which go against the lawful claims of the applicants leading to\n\nfiling of a spate of OAs seeking justice. Action of the respondents is unlawful\n\nand there has been hostile discrimination of the applicants.\n\niv) Submissions of learned counsel and documents submitted would indicate\n\nthat the entire dispute is fixated around the decision to provide reservation in\n\npromotions. Hon'ble High court, while dealing with the issue, in WP\n\n39158/2013 & batch on 29.4.2015 has ordered as under :\n\n 20 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n VIII. CONCLUSION:\n\n \"As the Tribunal has merely followed the law laid down by the Supreme\n Court in M. Nagaraj, in allowing the O.As, the orders of the Tribunal, to the\n extent it declared the action of the Railways in providing reservation in\n promotion without fulfilling the parameters laid down in M. Nagaraj to be\n illegal, do not necessitate interference. The fact however remains that,\n despite the amendment to the Constitution by insertion of \nArticles 16(4-A)\n\n and (4-B) nearly fourteen years ago, the members of the Scheduled Castes\n and the Scheduled Tribes still face uncertainty on whether or not they are\n entitled for reservation in promotion, and to be extended the benefit of\n consequential seniority. This predicament, they find themselves in, is for no\n fault of theirs but is on account of the failure of the Union of India to gather\n data, and form its opinion, on the parameters laid down by the Supreme\n Court in M. Nagaraj. The prevailing uncertainty can only be put an end to if\n the petitioner-Railway is directed to undertake the aforesaid exercise, and\n take a decision, within a specified time frame.\n\n The Writ Petitions are, accordingly, disposed of directing the petitioner-\n Railways to undertake and complete the exercise of gathering data, and\n forming its opinion on the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in M.\n Nagaraj, with utmost expedition and, in any event, not later than six months\n from the date of receipt of a copy of this Order. As this stalemate cannot be\n permitted to effect railway administration, and the services it renders to the\n public at large, it is open to the petitioner-Railways to make in-charge\n arrangements in the interregnum, making it clear to those, who are given\n charge of the posts, that this arrangement is temporary and would continue\n only till the exercise of formation of opinion, on the need to provide\n reservation in promotion, is completed. The miscellaneous petitions pending,\n if any, shall also stand disposed of. No costs.\"\n\n \nThe most important observation is that the respondents have been directed\n\nby the Hon'ble High Court to undertake and complete the exercise of gathering\n\ndata, and form its opinion on the parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in \nM. Nagaraj Vs. Union of India\n, 2006 (8) SCC 2012. It is thus to be\n\nassessed as to whether the respondents have acted as directed by the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court. The parameters which are to be worked upon as set out in Nagaraj\n\njudgment are extracted here under:\n\n \"The impugned constitutional amendments by which \nArticles 16(4A)\n and\n \n16(4B)\n have been inserted flow from \nArticle 16(4).\n They do not alter the\n structure of \nArticle 16(4).\n They retain the controlling factors or the\n compelling reasons, namely, backwardness and inadequacy of\n representation which enables the States to provide for reservation keeping\n in mind the overall efficiency of the State administration under Article\n\n 335. These impugned amendments are confined only to SCs and STs. They\n do not obliterate any of the constitutional requirements, namely, ceiling-\n\n 21 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n limit of 50% (quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy layer\n (qualitative exclusion), the sub-classification between OBC on one hand\n and SCs and STs on the other hand as held in Indra Sawhney, the concept\n of post-based Roster with in-built concept of replacement as held in R.K.\n Sabharwal.\n\n We reiterate that the ceiling-limit of 50%, the concept of creamy layer and\n the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\n representation and overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional\n requirements without which the structure of equality of opportunity\n in \nArticle 16\n would collapse.\n\n However, in this case, as stated, the main issue concerns the \"extent of\n reservation\". In this regard the concerned State will have to show in each\n case the existence of the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness,\n inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency before\n making provision for reservation. As stated above, the impugned provision\n is an enabling provision. The State is not bound to make reservation for\n SC/ST in matter of promotions. However if they wish to exercise their\n discretion and make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable\n data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation\n of that class in public employment in addition to compliance of Article\n\n 335. It is made clear that even if the State has compelling reasons, as\n stated above, the State will have to see that its reservation provision does\n not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or\n obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.\n\n Subject to above, we uphold the constitutional validity of the \nConstitution\n (Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act, 1995\n, the \nConstitution (Eighty-First\n Amendment) Act, 2000\n, the \nConstitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act,\n 2000\n and the \nConstitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n.\n\n We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of appropriate\n States and that question will be gone into in individual writ petition by the\n appropriate bench in accordance with law \nlaid down by\n us in the present\n case.\"\n\n Thus the Nagaraj judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court makes it clear that\n\nthe State must establish that there exists compelling reasons to provide\n\nreservations in promotions. The reasons in brief are:\n\n i) The data regarding inadequacy of their representations has to be\n\n collected and thereafter a decision need to be taken\n\n ii) Overall efficiency of the State administration under Art 335 has to\n\n be borne in mind\n\n iii) The concept of creamy layer has also to be dealt with.\n\n 22 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n iv) To collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the\n\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.\n\nFurther, to make things vivid on the issue of reservation in promotion, Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in Manoram's Case, (2010) 10 SCC 323, has held that\n\n ― When a member belongs to SC/ST caste gets selected in the open\n competition field on the basis of his own merit, he will not be\n counted against the quota reserved for Scheduled castes, but will be\n treated as open candidate, will apply only in regard to recruitment\n by open competition and not to the promotion effected on the basis\n of seniority -cum-suitability.‖\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has further reinforced the observations made in Nagraj\n\nin \nB.K.Pavitra & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors\n on 9 February, 2017, in Civil\n\nAppeal no. 2368 of 2011, which makes it imperative on part of the respondents\n\nto act as per the conditions laid down therein for providing reservation as under.\n\n ―We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the judgment\n of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj is a categorical imperative. The\n stand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated the reservation in\n promotion with consequential seniority and have given the stamp of\n approval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close scrutiny\n inasmuch as the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that \nArticles 16(4-\n A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are enabling provisions and the State can make provisions\n for the same on certain basis or foundation. The conditions precedent have\n not been satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What has been\n argued with vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept of\n reservation in promotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept\n the said submission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are treated\n valid with certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on the part of\n the State to appreciate and apply the test so that its amendments can be\n tested and withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid down therein.\n\n It is clear from the above discussion that exercise for determining\n ‗inadequacy of representation', ‗backwardness' and ‗overall efficiency', is\n a must for exercise of power under \nArticle 16(4A).\n Mere fact that there is\n no proportionate representation in promotional posts for the population of\n SCs and STs is not by itself enough to grant consequential seniority to\n promotes who are otherwise junior and thereby denying seniority to those\n who are given promotion later on account of reservation policy. It is for\n the State to place material on record that there was compelling necessity\n for exercise of such power and decision of the State was based on material\n including the study that overall efficiency is not compromised. In the\n present case, no such exercise has been undertaken. The High Court\n 23 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n erroneously observed that it was for the petitioners to plead and prove that\n the overall efficiency was adversely affected by giving consequential\n seniority to junior persons who got promotion on account of reservation.\n Plea that persons promoted at the same time were allowed to retain their\n seniority in the lower cadre is untenable and ignores the fact that a senior\n person may be promoted later and not at same time on account of roster\n point reservation. Depriving him of his seniority affects his further\n chances of promotion. Further plea that seniority was not a fundamental\n right is equally without any merit in the present context. In absence of\n exercise under \nArticle 16(4A)\n, it is the ‗catch up' rule which is fully\n applies. It is not necessary to go into the question whether the concerned\n Corporation had adopted the rule of consequential seniority.\n\nOne another relevant observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court In S. Panneer\n\nSelvam & Others v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors, 2015 (10) SCC 292, which has\n\na bearing on the instant case is reproduced for reference to take a view on the\n\ndispute in the OA.\n\n The question before the Hon'ble Apex Court was whether in the absence\n\n of any policy decision by the State for giving consequential seniority to\n\n candidates promoted on the basis of reservation prior to a senior general\n\n category candidate, claim for consequential seniority could be accepted.\n\n Answering the question in the negative, it was held that in absence of\n\n provision for consequential seniority, ‗catch up' rule will be applicable\n\n and the roster point promotees cannot claim such consequential seniority.\n\n The senior general candidates will regain their seniority on being\n\n promoted. Observations relevant in this regard are as follows :\n\n ―34. If we look at the above comparative table of the service\n particulars of the appellants and the respondents, it is seen that the\n contesting respondents U. Palaniappan joined the service almost\n seven years after the appellants, his seniority is automatically\n accelerated at an unprecedented rate and as on 1-4-2004 his\n seniority rank as ADE is 150 and seniority of V. Appadurai is 120.\n The appellants who are qualified and senior than the contesting\n respondents are placed much below in rank in comparison to the\n person belonging to the reserved class promotes who were\n promoted following the rule of reservation. It is to be noted that the\n SC ST employees in the present case have been promoted\n temporarily under Rule 39(a) and Rule 10(a)(i) of the General Rules\n\n 24 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n with the condition that their inclusion in the promotional order shall\n not confer on them any right whatsoever in the service.\n\n Determination of seniority is a vital aspect in the service career of\n an employee and his future promotion is dependent on this.\n Therefore, determination of seniority must be based on some\n principles which are just and fair. In the absence of any policy\n decision taken or rules framed by the State of Tamil Nadu regarding\n Tamil Nadu Highways Engineering Service, accelerated promotion\n given to the respondents following rule of reservation in terms of\n Rule 12 will not give them consequential accelerated seniority.\n\n xxxx\n\n \n36. In the absence of any provision for consequential seniority in\n the rules, the ―catch-up rule‖ will be applicable and the roster-point\n reserved category promotes cannot count their seniority in the\n promoted category from the date of their promotion and the senior\n general candidates if later reach the promotional level, general\n candidates will regain their seniority. The Division Bench appears\n to have proceeded on an erroneous footing that \nArticle 16(4-A)\n of\n the Constitution of India automatically gives the consequential\n seniority in addition to accelerated promotion to the roster-point\n promotes and the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be\n sustained.‖\n\nThe observation in regard to assessment of the backwardness of the sections of\n\nthe society belonging to Schedule castes and Schedule Tribes fell for\n\nconsideration before the Hon'ble Supreme court in the context of the\n\nconstitution perse providing reservation to such sections. The issue was\n\nadjudicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJarnail Singh & Ors Vs. Lachhmi\n\nNarain Gupta & Ors\n, 2018 (10) SCC 396, as under :\n\n \n― 21. Thus, we conclude that the judgment in \nNagaraj\n (supra) does not\n need to be referred to a seven-Judge Bench.\n \nHowever, the conclusion in\n \nNagaraj\n (supra) that the State has to collect quantifiable data showing\n backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, being\n contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) is held to\n be invalid to this extent.‖\n\nOn application of the legal principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme court in\n\nvarious judgments cited supra, to the decision of the respondents we can evaluate\n\nthe variance or congruence to decide the issue under dispute. As pointed out by\n\nlearned Sr counsel during the submissions, respondents need not collect\n 25 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nquantifiable data in regard to backwardness of the Scheduled castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes employees as per Jarnail Singh verdict.\n However, other\n\nparameters, which continue to hold ground, have to be adhered to.\n\n V) In this regard, we find that in assessing the adequacy of\n\nrepresentations of SC/ST employees, Chief Personnel officer of the respondents\n\norganisation vide letter dated 18.7.2017 claims that the data has been collected\n\nand that there is inadequacy of their representation in the cadre in question. In\n\nstatistical terms it is advanced in the said letter that in the cadre of AEs the\n\nrepresentation of SCs is 27.61 % and that of the STs is 10.47 %. Together, the\n\npercentage of representation is less than 50%. Two vital factors which deserve\n\nmention is that primarily reservation in promotion is a policy matter which has to\n\nbe decided by the Railway Board. A decision in this regard is not within the\n\ncompetence of the Chief Personnel Officer of a Zone. Railways are made of a\n\nnumber of Zones. Each zone cannot have a policy of its own. Therefore, the\n\nRailway Board, which is the Apex body of the respondents organisation, lays\n\ndown the policy. This is common knowledge and need not be further emphasized\n\nsince learned counsel for the respondents profess day in and day out before the\n\nbench that the policy laying body for the respondents is the Railway Board and\n\nits orders reign supreme. Besides, issue disputed is an All India issue which\n\ncalls for an All India solution and not a zonal one from the Chief Personnel\n\nOfficer. Railway Board order 117/2016 does not, in essence, permit such\n\ninitiatives by the subordinate formations of the respondents organisation. The\n\nCPO letter has one more dissonance of asserting that the combined\n\nrepresentation of SC and ST employees in the AE cadre is less than 50%\n\nglossing over the fact that reservation provided for BCs, OBCs etc have also to\n\nbe reckoned in order to assess as to whether total reservation percentage is\n 26 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nwithin 50% as stated in Nagraj Judgment. Without the reservation percentage\n\nprovided to other communities being indicated, it is statistically inaccurate to\n\naffirm that the total percentage of reservation was within the ceiling limit of\n\n50%. In fact this Tribunal on 11.1.2019, while dealing with an identical issue in\n\nOA 1162 /2013 and batch, involving the same respondents, continued its\n\nconsistent stand on the issue by directing them as under:\n\n ―Unless and until a decision at the level of Ministry of Railways and\n Railway Board is taken as regards the implementation of the reservation in\n promotions, the same shall not be effected at the lower levels.‖\n\nThe signal sent to the respondents was clear and loud and yet respondents'\n\nmisreading the signal is paving the way for protracted litigation.\n\n VI) Now let us evaluate the second aspect of efficiency. Respondents in\n\nthe same letter referred to, have stated that the AE posts belong to safety\n\ncategory and hence candidates are subjected to a written test, viva voce and\n\nmedical tests. Unless a candidate clears the tests, he would not be empanelled.\n\nThere is no relaxation for reserved candidates in regard to the marks to be\n\nobtained. The 6 SC/ST employees were promoted as AEs only after passing tests\n\nprescribed without any lowering of marks to be obtained. Therefore it has to be\n\nconstrued that they are efficient and capable. Consequently, efficiency in\n\nadministration has not been compromised. There can be no two views about the\n\nfact that the SC/ST employees have cleared the exams prescribed but the\n\ngrievance is that they are junior to the UR employees who have also cleared the\n\nexams and are eligible to be promoted like the reserved community employees.\n\nWhen the legitimate promotion of UR employees is denied by the respondents, it\n\nwould lead to frustration and demoralisation, which would in turn mar the\n\nefficiency of the respondents organisation. The contra effect in terms of morale\n\nand efficiency on others was not reckoned by the respondents. Observations of\n 27 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nthe Full Bench of Hon'ble High Court of Bihar while dealing with the issue of\n\nefficiency in the context of reservation in promotion in \nState of Bihar & Others\n\nvs Sushil Kumar Singh & others\n presented hereunder clears the mist in regard to\n\nunderstanding the factor of efficiency.\n\n ―From this what can be culled out is that the important factors that\n guide the reservations under Article-16(4A) are; (a) backwardness, (b)\n inadequacy of representation and (c) overall efficiency of the State\n administration under Article-335. It is also important to note that while\n providing reservation or making other provisions, the State must ensure\n that a) the facility so created does not lead to excessiveness so as to breach\n the ceiling limit of 50%, b) the creamy layer excluded and denied the\n benefit of reservation, and c) the facility is not extended indefinitely. In\n effect, 6 indicia were identified and stipulated.\n\n It is essential to bear in mind that the reservation provided for\n under Article-16(4) is substantially different from the one under Article-\n 16(4A). The former is a facility that enables persons to enter the State\n service by relaxing the norms of selection or the parameters of merit\n which are stipulated for the posts, in general. Through that process, a\n person who is otherwise not eligible to be appointed, is enabled to enter\n service under the State. The target group for this is unemployed persons,\n of a certain categories. In contrast, Article-16(4A) deals with the situation\n where the target group is already enjoying the benefit of employment on\n the basis of reservation under Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.\n 30-07-2015 Article-16(4), and the effort is only to push them to higher\n places in the hierarchy. In a way, it can be said that while Article-\n 16(4) deals with the primary and basic aspect of protective discrimination,\n i.e. reservation, the one under Article-16(4A) is about the secondary\n aspect. Obviously, for this reason the Parliament as well as the\n constitutional courts have made subtle distinction and have chosen to\n stipulate different parameters for the two.\n\n For example, the benefit under Clause-16(4) is in respect of \"services\n under the State\" whereas the objective underlying Article-16(4A) is to\n ensure representation of the SC/ST in the \"class or classes of posts in the\n service under the State\". Similarly, the necessity to ensure that the\n efficiency in administration does not suffer, is applied with a bit of greater\n emphasis for the reservations under Article-16(4A) than the one\n under Article-16(4). These are only the broader aspects.\n\n The argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the situation\n obtaining at a particular time may not remain the same and after a few\n years it may not be possible to keep pace with changing scenario classwise\n or servicewise, cannot be accepted. The reason is that the facility\n under Article-16(4A) is not aimed at ensuring mere survival or livelihood.\n It results in pushing of a person most junior in the service to higher\n positions by stealing march over his seniors. That can be done only when\n 28 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n the circumstances explained by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court are Patna\n High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt. 30-07-2015 found to be existing.\n\n The appellants cannot ignore the specific language employed in Clause-\n 4(A) indication that the reservation under it shall be in a class or classes in\n a service, under the State, and the service as a whole as indicated in Clause\n (4) of Article-16.\n\n That the reservation under Article-16(4A) of the Constitution is with\n reference to class or classes of posts in the service under the State is\n evident not only from the text of the provision, but also the various\n judgments rendered on the subject.\n\n It is also essential to keep in mind that the makers of the Constitution\n sounded a note of caution inArticle-335 that the special measures taken for\n the benefit of persons belonging to SC/ST category must be such that the\n efficiency in the administration is not compromised. Induction at the entry\n level through reservation may not pose any serious problem to\n administrative efficiency. The reason is that once a person with basic\n qualifications is inducted into service he would be subject to some training\n and methods as are applicable to anyone. On contrast, the reservation in\n promotion would render the concept such as seniority, merit irrelevant and\n enable a person belonging to Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.\n 30-07-2015 SC/ST category to get promotion out of turn, that too with the\n consequential seniority.\n\n An out of turn promotion may certainly make the person happy. However,\n the element of frustration or dissatisfaction in the person who is\n superseded cannot be ignored. The efficiency of administration which is\n adequately protected in Article-335 of the Constitution is likely to suffer a\n double dent on account of out of turn promotions. The first is that a\n relatively inexperienced person would occupy a higher position, and\n second is that an otherwise experienced and senior person is subjected to\n an element of frustration and he may not be able to execute with the same\n amount of interest as he used to do in the normal circumstances. It cannot\n be examined from the point of view of the beneficiary alone.\n\n The creamy layer is another vexed question vis-à-vis the reservations\n under Article-16(4A). It is true that in Indra Sawhney's case (supra), the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the concept of creamy layer does not\n apply to the reservations in favour of persons belonging to SC/ST\n category. \nHowever, in \nNagraj\n's case (supra), their Lordships observed at\n more places than one, that the creamy layer must be excluded from the\n purview of reservation under Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.\n 30-07-2015. That provision, not only from the body of the judgment, but\n also from the last sentence of the judgment, this aspect is clear.‖\n\n Therefore, in the context of the observation of the full bench of the\n\nHon'ble High Court of Bihar, the respondents did make a perfunctory study of\n 29 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nthe impact of reservations in promotions on efficiency and not in its entirety and\n\nthat too, by an incompetent authority. We need to remember that an organisation\n\nis made of a group of people who form a team. Efficiency of the organisation\n\ndepends on team work. If some of the team members are discriminated even\n\nthough they are entitled for certain benefits, then, those discriminated would be\n\nde-motivated and disenchanted leading to inefficiency. This requires a close\n\nstudy and it is for the respondents to make an effort in this direction and that too\n\nat the Apex level. Passing the exam could be one parameter to assess efficiency\n\nbut not necessarily the only parameter to decide efficiency. Therefore, even in\n\nthis regard the orders of the Honourable High Court of A.P have not been carried\n\nout.\n\nBesides, the aspect of creamy layer has not been delved upon by the respondents\n\nin their reply statement, as this is an integral and intrinsic part of the Nagraj\n\nJudgment.\n\n VII) The principle of promoting SC/ST employees based on own merit\n\nis only in recruitment through open competition, but not for promotions effected\n\non the basis of seniority -cum-suitability, as enunciated in Manorama Case by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court. In the instant case promotion was granted on the basis\n\nof Seniority cum Suitability. Therefore, UR employees who were qualified as\n\nper 2010 notification being senior should have been considered as per law but\n\ncontravened by the respondents.\n\n \nVIII) Another interesting aspect of the letter of the chief Personnel officer\n\ndated 18.7.2017 is that the 6 SC/ST employees who were shown against the UR\n\nvacancies in the select panel dt 3.12.2010 are now shown against SC/ST\n\nvacancy. Any modification in the Group B promotion approved by the GM has\n 30 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nto be ratified by the Railway Board. Respondents did not produce any such\n\ndocument ratifying their decision. Therefore, letter dated 18.7.2017 is invalid.\n\nRespondents did attempt to seek post facto approval of their decision vide their\n\nletter dated 3.4.2017, but till date Railway Board has not responded in writing.\n\nBesides, the whole issue in OA 1263 was about promoting SC/ST employees\n\nwho were junior to the applicants, against UR vacancy. Respondents by\n\nattempting to adjust the 6 SC/ST employees against SC/ST vacancies vide letter\n\ndated 18.7.2017 have conceded that the select panel dated 3.12.2010 is not in\n\norder. Albeit, the letter did not have the stamp of approval of the Railway\n\nBoard, it also suffered from one another major inadequacy of not complying with\n\nthe orders of the Hon'ble High Court, wherein it was held that regular promotion\n\ncan be granted only by fulfilling the parameters specified in \nNagaraj\n Case. Such\n\ncompliance which is a must, being absent, regular promotions ordered vide letter\n\ndated 18.7.2017 are irregular. Promotions even to SC/ST vacancies without\n\naddressing the core aspects of Nagraj judgment are illegal. In fact they\n\ncontravene the High Court orders to the extent that they are not in conformity\n\nwith Nagaraj judgment.\n\n IX) One another allied and intricate issue which has been thrown open\n\nby the letter dated 18.7.2017 of the respondents is that the Hon'ble High Court\n\nhas ordered that after collecting the data, respondents need to form an opinion\n\nand then issue orders of promotion with prospective effect. Respondents, instead\n\nof doing so, have retrospectively regularised the promotion of the private\n\nrespondents in OA 1263/2010 from 30.12.2010, which is not in resonance with\n\nthe directions of the Hon'ble High Court in CC 166 of 2016 as under:\n\n ―Even if, as is now contended before us by Sri L. Ravi Chander, learned\n Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Railways, the data gathered\n show the need to provide reservation, the Railways could not have\n\n 31 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n regularised the promotions made earlier, and could only have effected\n promotions afresh after the data, gathered in terms of the judgment of the\n Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj, showed the need to provide reservation, for\n members of the scheduled castes, in promotion posts. ‖\n\nAfter the contempt case CC 166/2016 was filed, the error being noticed,\n\nrespondents have issued corrigenda to the earlier proceedings, and have\n\ninformed the employees concerned that the adhoc promotions given to them\n\nearlier must be treated as an in-charge arrangement; and the earlier order,\n\nregularising their services, was being withdrawn. To this extent respondents\n\nhave corrected the mistake of showing the promotion as in-charge and not as\n\nregular. However, the order of the Hon'ble High Court of granting promotions\n\nafresh from a date after the exercise of gathering the data was glossed over. In\n\nshort granting promotion to the private respondents in OA 1263/2010 vide order\n\ndated 18.7.2017 by asserting that the promotion order issued through O.O no\n\n326/2010 dt 30.12.2010 is in order and accordingly continuing the promotion on\n\nregular basis from the date of issue, is flagrant violation of the orders of the\n\nHon'ble High Court in Contempt petition 1646 of 2015 & 166 of 2016.\n\n X) Complication in the issue is further aggravated by the respondents\n\nin cancelling the orders of promotion and issue of fresh orders of selection on\n\n18.7.2017 since it leads to another legally valid question, as to whether the\n\nrespondents are empowered to issue such orders. Promotion to the post of AE is\n\non selection basis through a written exam, viva voce etc. If once a selection is\n\ncancelled, then fresh orders could be given only after one were to go through\n\nthe selection process prescribed, lest it would be irregular. It is not explained in\n\nthe reply statement as to under what rule such orders were issued. However,\n\nrespondents, on their part approached the Railway Board vide letter dated\n\n3.4.2017 by presenting the background of the case in terms of litigation in OA\n 32 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n1263/2010 and the Hon'ble High Court Orders thereon, for approval of the\n\nfollowing:\n\n ―Since Hon'ble CAT /Hyd has ordered against empanelling reserved\n employees under UR vacancies and Hon‗ble High Court, Hyderabad has\n confirmed the Hon'ble CAT's order, the next 7 UR employees are to be\n now included in the panel against UR vacancies and the 6 reserved\n employees (5 SC & 1 ST) who were earlier promoted against UR\n vacancies on own merit and were made as in charge arrangement are to be\n adjusted against SC/ST vacancies.\n\n As per extant instructions for modifications in any Group B panel should\n have the approval of Railway Board, since the panel has been approved by\n the General Manger. In case it is decided to include the names of 7 more\n employees in the panel dated 3.2.2010, then the revised panel would be as\n indicated in Annexure -12.‖\n\nThe communication gives an inkling that the respondents are veering round to\n\nthe point of view that the orders of the Tribunal and the Hon'ble High Court are\n\nto be abided by. Nevertheless, approval of the Board has not been received in\n\nwriting, though the respondents claim that they have received oral permission to\n\nact as indicated above, by submitting a letter dated 20.11.2018 from Dy CPO to\n\nthe learned standing counsel for the respondents. It is difficult to appreciate that\n\nin matters of National policy having litigative significance, the Railway Board\n\nwould give oral permission. Even, if given, in certain emergency circumstances\n\nthey are backed by written orders on a later date. Public institutions are manned\n\nby issue of formal orders and not by Informal ones, since the later go against the\n\nbasic tenets of organisational management, particularly so, when a humungous\n\norganisation like the Railways is involved. Till date, respondents have failed to\n\nproduce any document to the effect that the Railway Board has approved the\n\npromotion effected vide letter dated 18.7.2017. Hence, the order of promoting\n\nthe SC/ST employees needs a relook since it portends modification of Group B\n\npromotions for which Railway Board approval is a must and only after\n\n 33 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\ncomplying with the pre-conditions of Nagraj as ordered by the Hon'ble High\n\nCourt in W.P No.9942/2014 & batch.\n\n \nXII) Having come half the distance, a recapitulation of the gist of the\n\ncase along with other associated legal battles fought not referred to so far would\n\nhelp in keeping focus on the main issue. The factual matrix of the issue will\n\nreveal that the applicants have been put to disadvantage all along for reasons best\n\nknown to the respondents. To begin with OA 1263 of 2010 was allowed with a\n\ndirection to fill up 7 UR vacancies with UR qualified senior employees instead\n\nof SC/ST employees who were juniors to the applicants. When challenged in\n\nHon'ble High Court in W.P 9942/2014 and batch, respondents were given 6\n\nmonths time to form an opinion keeping in view the directions contained in\n\nNagaraj\n case and decide the issue. Accordingly, respondents claim that they have\n\nfollowed the orders of Nagraj and issued orders favouring SC/ST employees on\n\n18.7.2017 but it was found to be in gross violation of Nagraj Judgment as\n\nexpounded in paras supra. Contempt petition 166 of 2016 wherein Hon'ble High\n\nCourt has faulted the decision of the respondents by observing that in-charge\n\narrangement, which was permitted, do not enable respondents to either effect\n\npromotions on adhoc basis or grant promotions retrospectively. Erroneous orders\n\nof the respondents issued earlier were cancelled and consequently contempt case\n\nwas closed. Nevertheless, in the process respondents have kept open the legal\n\nissue as to whether, after cancelling the orders of promotion granted to the 6\n\nSC/ST employees, are they competent to issue fresh orders of selection without\n\nsubjecting the candidates to go through the selection procedure of clearing the\n\nexams etc without being backed by any rule and admittedly by an incompetent\n\nauthority. Thereafter, 2013 notification was issued to fill up 7 SC/ST and 1 UR\n\nunfilled backlog vacancies of 2010. UR employees filed OA 203/2013 to set\n 34 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\naside the notification which was allowed and on being challenged in the High\n\nCourt in WP no 16280/2014, Hon'ble High Court has upheld Tribunal order.\n\nLater, SC/ST employees filed OA 392/2013 for extending zone of consideration\n\nwhich was dismissed. Tribunal order was challenged in W.P no 11724 of 2014 in\n\nwhich UR employees got themselves impleaded and the Hon'ble High Court\n\nupheld the decision of the Tribunal directing respondents to treat the 8 vacancies\n\nas UR. Instead of complying with the orders of High Court respondents,\n\ncancelled the notification of 2013 on 26.7.2017 and on the same day issued\n\nfresh notification by showing 7 SC/ST vacancies indicated in 2013 as SC/ST\n\nbacklog vacancies instead of showing them as UR vacancies. Thereby, once\n\nagain infringing the orders of the Hon'ble High Court. However, the explanation\n\ngiven by the respondents was that they implemented the relevant High Court\n\norders. When they did cancel, respondents ought to have shown the 8 vacancies\n\nnotified in 2013 as UR. Further, the notification of 2017 indicated 18 UR and 8\n\nSC/ST vacancies. In the 8 SC/ST vacancies, 7 back log unfilled vacancies of\n\n2010 which were notified in 2013 figure. They were ordered to be shown as UR\n\nalong with one more UR, totalling to 8 vacancies by the Hon'ble High Court, but\n\nhas not been adhered to. In compliance with the orders of the High Court in WP\n\n11724/2014 the vacancies notified in 2017 ought to be 18 + 8 UR. It is not\n\nexplained in clear terms as to why the orders of the Hon'ble High Court have not\n\nbeen followed. Cancellation of the 2013 notification would not mean that the\n\nHon'ble High Court order has been complied with. It is difficult to comprehend\n\nsuch a decision when the orders are crystal clear in the matter. Applicants have\n\nbeen fighting a legal battle to place them in the select panel dt. 3.12.2010 and the\n\nrespondents on their part not only denied the same but made it more injurious to\n\nthe cause of the applicants by showing them in the zone of consideration for\n 35 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n2017 notification. Aggrieved applicants filed the instant OAs challenging the\n\norder of the respondents for not including their names in the select panel dt\n\n3.12.2010 and issue of integrated seniority list dt 18.7.2017 showing them in the\n\nzone of consideration and excluding the 6 junior SC/ST employees as if there\n\npromotion to AE is regular.\n\n XIII) Besides, OA 964/2017 and OA 738 of 2017 were filed challenging\n\nthe integrated seniority list and the zone of consideration prepared based on the\n\nsaid list, as the erstwhile junior SC/ST employees names have been placed above\n\nthe names of erstwhile senior UR employees in violation of Railway Board order\n\nNo 117 of 2016 and against law relating to reservation in promotion. Seniority is\n\nthe main foundation which decides the eligibility of employees to appear in\n\nexamination held for selection posts and for further career progression vertically\n\nor horizontally. Instead of concentrating on measures to resolve the issues raised\n\nin the OAs and the WPs respondents have been issuing a flood of notifications\n\ninviting serious legal challenges.\n\n XIV) Against the backdrop of the above recapitulation with the\n\nconcurrent developments, response of the respondents and the submissions of the\n\ncounsel, if analysed, would enable us to take a fair view on the issue. The Ld.\n\nSenior counsel for the respondents has vehemently argued that the issue on hand\n\nis only of academic nature since the High Court orders on the subject have been\n\nimplemented lock, stock and barrel. \nIn support of his submission Ld Counsel\n\ncited the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nLoknath Padhan vs\n\nBireender Kumar Sahu\n in 1974 AIR 505,1974 SCR (3) 114 wherein it was held\n\nthat:\n\n ―We are, therefore, of the view that, the Orissa Legislative Assembly\n being dissolved during the pendency of this appeal, it is now wholly\n 36 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n academic to consider whether the respondent was disqualified under s.\n\n 9A at the date of nomination and since that is the only ground on which\n election of the respondent is challenged, we think it would be futile to hear\n this appeal on merits. We accordingly dismiss the appeal with no orders as\n to costs all throughout.\n\nThe other citation is in regard to \nRamdas Athawale vs Union of India and ors\n in\n\nW.P (civil) no 86 of 2004, wherein Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:\n\n 34. One more aspect of the matter. The petitioner in this writ petition\n under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution has challenged the validity of\n proceedings in the Lok Sabha commencing from 29th January, 2004 on\n the grounds stated hereinabove, with which we have dealt with in the\n preceding paragraphs. The petition has become anfractuous, since the Lok\n Sabha was dissolved and thereafter two elections have been held. The\n issue raised in the petition is purely a hypothetical question. There is no\n existing lis between the parties. It is settled practice that this Court does\n not decide matters which are only of academic interest on the facts of a\n particular case.\n\nThe third one is in \nMoti Ram vs Param Dev and Anr\n reported in 1993 AIR 1662,\n\n1993 SCR (2) 250 wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:\n\n A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondent to the\n appeal that in view of the dissolution of the assembly it was academic to\n decide whether or not the respondent was disqualified under section 9A.\n Upholding the said preliminary objection, this court has held that the court\n should not undertake to decide an issue unless it is a living issue between\n the parties and if an issue is purely academic, in that its decision one way\n or the other would have no impact on the position of the parties, it would\n be waste of public time and indeed not proper exercise of authority for the\n court to engage itself in deciding it.\n\nAs can be seen the judgments cited are not relevant to the instant case since the\n\nissues therein are about challenging related events which occurred before the\n\ndissolution of the Lok Sabha and assembly referred to and therefore no purpose\n\nwould be served when the bodies themselves have been dissolved. Hence they\n\nare academic which the courts should not undertake. However, Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the same citation has held that the courts should take up live issues. The\n\ncase of the applicants is live, since the cause for promotion continues since the\n\nfiling of OA 1263/2010 and followed by a series of OAs and orders of\n 37 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nHonourable High Court in WPs 9942/2014 and batch culminating in the present\n\nOAs. Therefore, the issues raised by the applicants are very much live and not\n\nacademic, calling for a genuine resolution. Besides, the learned Sr Respondent\n\nCounsel has also submitted that one applicant passed, another one did not appear\n\nin the exam and the rest of the applicants failed in the exam conducted in\n\npursuance of 2017 notification. Therefore, only the case of the applicant who has\n\npassed the exam has to be adjudicated and not in regard to the others. At this\n\njuncture, it is to be pointed out that this Tribunal in OA 636/2017 on 3.8.2017\n\nhas observed when the applicants sought interim relief as under:\n\n ―In view of the above, we are not inclined to interdict the Notification\n dated 26.7.2017 at this stage. However, any promotion in pursuance of\n Annex.A-1 Notification dated 26.7.2017 shall be subject to the result of\n the OA and that the participation of the applicants in the selection process\n in pursuance of the notification is without prejudice to their rights in the\n OA.‖\n\nThe Tribunal has observed that the applicants participating in the selection\n\nprocess in pursuance of the notification of 2017 will not prejudice the reliefs\n\nsought in the OA. Hence the presentation of the Ld. Sr. Standing Counsel\n\nreferred to, has no legs to stand since the climax has not been reached. The\n\napplicants hope to persuade the respondents that their claim stems from justice in\n\nas-is-where-in condition when it started, which, true to speak, is being kept alive\n\nby oxygenating it with the intervention of the judicial forums in accordance with\n\nlaw. Committing a wrong and perpetuating the same on the applicants years on is\n\nunfair to say the least. Nevertheless, we are still at the interval stage and there is\n\nlong way to go. Applicants have filed Miscellaneous Petition no 253 of 2017 to\n\nrecall the order in CC 166 of 2016 which is to be adjudicated by the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court. The continuous cause of action arose because of the respondents\n\nissuing letters dated 18.7.2017 & 26.7.2017 and hence their validity or otherwise\n\nis still under judicial scrutiny.\n\n 38 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n XV) As we continue our journey through the maze of alleys by which the\n\ncase traverses, we are confronted with the assertion of the respondents that as\n\nper para 205 of IREM, the life of a select panel is only two years. If it be so, it is\n\nnot explained as to how the respondents could promote on 18.7.2017 the 6\n\nSC/ST employees, private respondents in OA 1263/2010, as AEs based on the\n\nselect panel of 2010. Rules are to be followed uniformly but not selectively.\n\nForget not, that there is another part of the IREM which is extracted below:\n\n ― Para 205 - Currency of Panel.--The panel will be current for a period of\n 2 years from the date of approval of the competent authority or till a fresh\n panel on the basis of next selection becomes available whichever is earlier.\n\n Where provisional panels are drawn the currency will count from the date\n of approval of the provisional panel. If the operation of an approved panel\n has been held in abeyance either wholly or partly as a result of injunction\n from the Court of Law the currency of the panel should be reckoned after\n excluding the period covered by the Court's directive. Before operating the\n panel after the vacation of the junction/after disposal of the case by the\n Court of Law, the personal approval of the General Manager should be\n taken.\n\nThe sum and substance of the para is that when the panel is under judicial study\n\nit will continue to breathe life till a finality is arrived on the matter. In fact, OA\n\n1263/2010 was filed before the expiry period of 2 years from the date of issue of\n\nselect panel on 3.12.2010 and the litigation on the issue is live to this date.\n\n XVI) To be precise the action of the respondents is against Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observation on the issue and in utter disregard of the railway\n\nBoard order RBE 117/2016 , wherein it was instructed not to issue any orders of\n\npromotion based on reservation. RBE 117 /2016 was issued based on an\n\nundertaking given to the Hon'ble Apex Court by the Ld. Solicitor General of\n\nIndia. Respondents disregarding their own instructions is strange and is violative\n\nof the legal principle \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in a catena of\n\njudgments dealing with the need to follow rules. In fact, Hon'ble Supreme Court\n 39 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nhas taken a serious view of violation of instructions and rules as brought out here\n\nunder.\n\n The Hon'ble Supreme Court observation in T.Kannan and ors vs S.K.\n Nayyar (1991) 1 SCC 544 held that ―Action in respect of matters\n covered by rules should be regulated by rules‖. Again in Seighal's case\n (1992) (1) supp 1 SCC 304 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has stated that\n ―Wanton or deliberate deviation in implementation of rules should be\n curbed and snubbed.‖ In another judgment reported in (2007) 7 SCJ 353\n the Hon'ble Apex court held ― the court cannot de hors rules‖\n\nThe Railway Board order RBE 117 of 2016 is reproduced hereunder in view of\n\nthe its intrinsic significance to the instant case.\n\n―The aforesaid Contempt Petition (C) No. 314/2016 in SLP (C) No. 4831 of\n2012 came up for hearing on 29.09.2016. In follow up of hearing of the above\nmentioned contempt case, Shri Ranjit Kumar, the Learned Solicitor General of\nIndia vide its letter No. SG/2/2016-262(I) dated 29.09.2016, has communicated\nand advised M/o. Railways as under:-\n\n ―.. After hearing the matter for some time, the Court felt that the\n main matter is required to be decided and therefore, adjourned the\n Contempt Petition to be decided along with the main matters and fixed the\n date of hearing for 22.11.2016 as the first case. The court stated that if the\n Solicitor General wants to make a statement that no further promotions of\n reserved category persons to unreserved posts will be made relying on the\n circulars dated 10.08.2010/ 14.09.2010, then they would not pass any\n further interim order. I informed the court that the Government would not\n pass any further order of promotion relying upon either of these two\n circulars or on the basis thereof. I also conveyed to the Court that I will\n write a letter informing of about my statement to the Court to you and to\n the Secretary, DOP&T and the Chairman, Railway Board. That is why I\n am addressing this letter to you so that all the Departments are conveyed\n of the assurance given in the Court that in the matter of making any\n promotion of a reserved category officer/ employee the Department\n concerned would not rely upon or make the basis of such promotion to an\n unreserved post based on the circulars dated 10.08.2010 and 14.09.2010\n and that any violation thereof will bring about a definite contempt....‖\n\n (Circular dated 14.9.2010 as quoted by the Ld. SG be read as 01.09.2010\nwhich is RBE 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010 issued based on DOP&T's OM dated\n10.8.2010)\n\n In view of the above assurance, received from the Ld. Solicitor General of\nIndia, it is advised that Railway Board's RBE No. 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010, is\nheld in abeyance with immediate effect till further advice, and all further\n\n 40 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\npromotions of reserved category persons to unreserved posts will not be made by\nignoring Railway Board's RBE No. 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010 which in turn\nwas based upon the DOP&T OM dated 10.08.2010 & under reference No. (i) &\n\n(ii) above. However, all promotions order henceforth shall be subject to\noutcome of the main SLPs and the above mentioned contempt petition which are\nstill pending.\n\n The above may please be brought to the notice of all concerned for\ninformation and strict compliance.‖\n\n The above undertaking was given by the ld. Solicitor General on\n\n29.9.2016 and the respondents issued the letter purporting to promote the SC/ST\n\nemployees on 18.7.2017. Therefore, the promotion ordered is consequent to the\n\nundertaking and hence, invalid.\n\n \nXVII) Incidentally, it is an issue on which other divisions of\n\nthe (SCR) South Central Railway Zone of the respondents organisation have\n\ntaken a decision by reverting the SC/ST employees who were promoted without\n\nadhering to the norms of Nagraj and the undertaking given to the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court by the Ld. Solicitor General. To be specific, Vijayawada division\n\ncoming under the jurisdiction of the SCR has issued orders vide letter dt\n\n4.12.2015, withdrawing the regular promotion as per the directions of the\n\nHon'ble High Court. It is obviously beyond comprehension as to why\n\nSecunderabad and Guntakal divisions under the same Zone failed to follow suit.\n\nThe respondents from 2 to 4 have a precedent to adopt. Not doing so is against\n\nthe observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court of having one policy for different\n\nrailway zones in \nAbid Hussain v. Union of India\n, (1987) 1 SCC 532, which\n\nreads as under:-\n\n \nIt is not disputed that the Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-\n Attendants are being paid overtime allowances for extra duty hours\n exceeding 96 hours in two weeks in the Western Railway, Central\n Railway and Eastern Railway. There is no justification for denying\n 41 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n overtime allowances on the same basis to the Air-conditioned\n Coach-In-Charges-Attendants in the Northern Railway. We\n accordingly direct the Union of India and the Railway\n Administration to pay with effect from July 1, 1984 the overtime\n allowances to the Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-Attendants\n working in the Northern Railway on the same basis on which the\n Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-Attendants in the other three\n Railways\n, \nreferred to above\n, are paid. All arrears of such\n allowances up to date shall be paid as early as possible and in any\n event not later than four months from today. The benefit of this\n order shall be extended to all such employees including those who\n have retired and those who have not joined as petitioners herein.\n\nIn \nG.C. Ghosh vs Union of India\n ( 1991) supp. 2 SCC 497, Hon'ble Supreme\n\ncourt has further held that when one zonal railway has taken a stand, the other\n\nzonal railway need to go by the same. Surprisingly, in the present case, different\n\ndivisions in the same zone have taken different stands, which go against the\n\ndirectives of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to. Not only they have taken a\n\ndifferent stand but upgraded the 6 SC ST employees to a higher grade, though\n\nthey were supposed to be in-charges till the Nagaj exercise is completed and that\n\ntoo, in administrative interests, thereby raising a question on the intent of the\n\norder dated 24.6.2015.\n\nXVIII) Further, respondents have cancelled notification dated 2.1.2013 for\n\nfilling up of 8 AE vacancies, on 26.7.2017, as per Hon'ble High Court order in\n\nWP 16280/2014 wherein fulfilling the parameters \nlaid down in\n \nNagraj\n's case is\n\nnecessary to provide reservation in promotion. On the same date coming up with\n\na fresh notification for filling up 26 posts of AE without complying with the\n\norders of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad of showing 8 posts\n\nof 2013 notification as UR and without completing the exercise of Nagaraj in its\n\nentirety as ordered by the Hon'ble High Court in W.P 9942/2014 and batch dated\n\n29.4.2015, does not stand the test of reason.\n\n 42 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nXIX) An associate issue related to reservation in promotion is the publication of\n\nintegrated seniority list, by the respondents which has been challenged in OAs\n\n738/2017 & 964/2017. After the Hon'ble High Court passed orders in WP No\n\n11724 of 2013 on 22.12.2016, the earlier notification issued on 2.1.2013 for\n\nselection to the post of AE has been cancelled on 26.7.2017. Simultaneously, on\n\nthe same day another notification was issued to fill up 26 posts of AEs, including\n\nSC/ST vacancies was published. To take the exercise forward, integrated\n\nseniority list was issued. Based on the integrated seniority list, the final\n\neligibility list was issued on 10.10.2017. The grievance of the applicants is that,\n\ndespite prevailing instructions and law : not permitting reservation in\n\npromotions, consequential seniority and own merit for SC/ST employees;\n\nrespondents have issued integrated seniority list placing the SC/ST category\n\nemployees above the applicants in the OAs referred to based on the\n\nconsequential seniority granted to them by virtue of accelerated promotions\n\ngiven earlier. On the basis of the said integrated seniority, eligibility list was\n\nissued by placing SC/ST employees above the applicants without obtaining the\n\nwillingness/unwillingness of the employees coming within the zone of\n\nconsideration and also including the names of the employees who are going to\n\nretire within 2 months. The final eligibility list has thus once again been wrongly\n\ndrawn up again with juniors to the applicants finding a place above them. The\n\npatent illegality resorted to will enable the erstwhile juniors to the applicants to\n\nget selected against UR vacancies, leaving the applicants who are seniors not\n\ngetting selected as it had happened in the past forcing the UR employees to\n\ncontest in OA 1263/2010 which was allowed and confirmed by the High Court\n\nin WP 9942 & batch to the extent of directing the respondents to abide by the\n\nparameters in Nagraj judgment. At this juncture, we recall the submission of the\n 43 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nLd. Sr. Counsel for the private respondents that the grievances of the applicants\n\nhave not been projected, as is required, falls flat since the applicants, as\n\nexpounded above, have been periodically agitating stating their grievance in no\n\nuncertain terms. It is also pertinent to add that executive instructions\n\ncommunicated through Railway Board orders cited by the respondents cannot\n\noverrule law laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in judgments cited. If the\n\nRailway Board has not given any instructions on consequential seniority, it\n\nwould not mean that the respondents from 2 to 4 can act against law.\n\nConstructive restrainment is the hallmark of administrative efficacy when\n\nmatters of administrative jurisdiction are involved with implicit legal\n\nimplications.\n\nContinuing on the subject of integrated seniority list, it must be stated that\n\nemployees from different streams of the respondents organisation are eligible to\n\nappear for selection as AE. Hence drawing up a common seniority is required\n\nwhich is termed as integrated seniority list. In an integrated seniority list feeder\n\ncadre employees from different streams like works and permanent way streams\n\nto which the applicants belong to and from other streams like drawing, Bridges,\n\nTrack Machine, EWS, design etc are shown. Seniority has to be based on the\n\nlength of service as \nlaid down in\n para 203.5 of the IREM vol-1 which reads as\n\nunder:\n\n ―Para 203.5 of IREM: Since employees from the different streams\n will be eligible to appear for the selection, their integrated seniority\n for purposes of the selection should be determined on the basis of\n total length of non-fortuitous service rendered in grade Rs. 6500-\n 10500 (R.S.) and above. In other words the date of appointment to\n the grade Rs. 6500-10500(R.S.) on a non fortuitous basis will be\n the criterion. ‖\n\nThe UR employees though senior based on length service but they are shown as\n\njunior to SC/ST employees because of accelerated promotions. By doing so,\n\n 44 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nrespondents are disregarding their own instructions as \nlaid down in\n Para 203.5 of\n\nIREM which is statutory in nature.\n\nXX) In addition, as cited in paras supra, Hon'ble Apex court observation in \nK.\n\nManorama\n case, that an SC employee getting selected in open competition on\n\nown merit can be shown against UR vacancy but not in respect of promotion\n\neffected on the basis of seniority cum suitability.\n The selection to AE is based on\n\nseniority cum suitability and therefore Manorama case applies, which the\n\nrespondents failed to follow. The Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan in WP no\n\n2773 of 2012 has quashed Railway Board order RBE no 126/2010 wherein\n\nSC/ST employees were ordered to be adjusted against UR vacancy on own merit\n\nor reservation roster irrespective of the fact whether the promotion is made by\n\nselection method or non selection method. The order of the Hon'ble High Court\n\nof Rajasthan when challenged in SLP 219 of 2015 filed by the Railways, the\n\nSLP was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 12.1.2015. Therefore,\n\nrespondents have to comply with the said judgment without any iota of doubt,\n\nwhich is in favour of the applicants.\n\nAn identical matter was adjudicated by Hon'ble Principal Bench of this\n\nTribunal in OA no 221/2008 dated 2.12.2010, wherein, it was held as under:\n\n \n― We have applied our mind to the pleadings and the contentions\n raised by the learned counsel representing the applicants on the\n issues as mentioned above, but are of the view that once, in brevity,\n it is the case of the applicants that when no compliance of pre-\n conditions are spelled out in \nM. Nagaraj\n's case has been done,\n reservation in promotion with the accelerated seniority shall have to\n be worked out in the way and manner as per the law settled earlier\n on the issue. If that be so, we need to have to labour on the issues\n raised by the applicants, as shrewdly, if the position is already\n settled , the only relevant discussion and adjudication in this case\n can be and should be confined to non observation of the pre-\n conditions for making accelerated promotions as valid. We have\n already held above that the respondents have not worked out or\n even applied their mind to the pre-conditions as mentioned above\n\n \n45 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n before giving effect to the provisions of Art 16(4A); for that reason,\n circular dated 29.2.2008 vide which the seniority of SC/ST railway\n servants promoted by virtue of rule of reservation /roster has to be\n regulated in terms of the Railway Boards letter dated 8.3.2002 and\n 13.1.2005 has to be quashed. There is a specific prayer to quash\n instructions dated 8.3.2002 & 13.1.2005 as well, but there would be\n no need to do as the same have been discussed in the case of\n Railways itself in the matter of \nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n (supra), and\n commented upon. While setting aside instructions dated 29.2.2008,\n our directions would not give accelerated seniority to SC & ST\n employees till such time pre-conditions on which alone Aritcle 16\n (4 A) of the constitution is to operate, are complied with.‖\n\n Thus the SC/ST employees are not entitled for accelerated seniority till\n\nsuch time the pre-conditions \nlaid down in\n Nagraj judgement are strictly\n\nfollowed.\n \nWe have observed in the aforesaid paras that the respondents have not\n\nadhered with any of the parameters laid in \nM. Nagraj\n case. By keeping in view\n\nthe observation of the Hon'ble Principal Bench, this Tribunal in 1263/2010 has\n\nheld that the applicants therein shall be considered on the basis of their\n\nperformance in the written test and interview and on the basis of their original\n\nseniority and not treating the private respondents as seniors to the applicants for\n\nthe purpose of promotion to the post of AE. The Tribunal order has been upheld\n\nby the Hon'ble High Court of A.P in W.P 9942/2014 and batch. Hence issue of\n\nthe integrated seniority list goes against the very grain of the observation of this\n\nTribunal in OA 1263/2010 which was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court.\n\n XXI) Respondents did issue RBE No 117/2016 directing the subordinate\n\nformation not to follow the orders issued in RBE 126/2010. Therefore, the issue\n\nof the integrated seniority list is against the very essence of RBE 117/2016,\n\nwhich was issued in compliance with the undertaking given to the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt.\n\n Till date the respondents have not framed a rule or any policy as to how to\n\ngo about in regard to reservation in promotions by fulfilling the pre-conditions\n 46 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nin Nagraj. In the absence of a rule or a policy from the Railway Board, the\n\npolicy formulator, issue of integrated seniority list is not as per law.\n\n XXII) Even the order of this Tribunal to follow Nagraj in OA 333 of 2013\n\nwhich was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court of A.P in WP no 20809/2014,\n\nwas carried to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CC no 3196 of 2015 but was\n\ndismissed. Hence respondents adhering to preconditions of Nagraj has attained\n\nfinality and therefore issue of integrity seniority list which is not in tune with\n\nthe spirit of Nagraj shall have to go.\n\n Similar verdicts delivered by the Hon'ble Ernakulam and Mumbai\n\nBenches of this Tribunal in OAs 98/2014 dated 15.11.2016 and 727/2013 &\n\nbatch dt. 9.1.2019 respectively, Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in WP No.\n\n3490/2010 favour the cause of the applicants. The law in regard to reservation in\n\npromotion has attained finality with the vivid observations of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in M. Nagraj, B.K.Pavitra, Manorama, U.P.Power Corporation\n\nas has been discussed in paras supra. Hon'ble Jabalpur Bench of the Tribunal in\n\nOA 143 of 2017 has directed the respondents therein to proceed with selection\n\nwithout the rule of reservation or issue fresh notification.\n\n The respondents claim that the applicants are seeking plural reliefs.\n\nWe do not agree with the same since seniority decides promotion and any\n\ninfringement of the promotion which was legally due to the applicants would be\n\na continuous cause of action. Hence, the relief sought are consequential and not\n\nplural.\n\n XXIII) To sum up, respondents have acted against the orders\n\nof the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in WP No. 9942/2010 and\n\nbatch, by granting promotion to the 6 SC/ST employee without satisfying the\n 47 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\npreconditions \nlaid down in\n Nagraj. Further orders of the Hon'ble High Court in\n\nWP No.11724/2013 to show all the 8 vacancies as UR were not followed. \nThe\n\norders of the Hon'ble High Court were crystal clear that even if preconditions of\n\nM. Nagraj\n case were to be followed the SC/ST employees shall be promoted\n\nprospectively and not retrospectively. However, respondents have chosen to\n\npromote the SC/ST employees retrospectively from 2010 instead of 2017. Legal\n\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Nagraj, Pavitra,\n\nManorama, Palaniswamy and U.P. Power Corporation have not been adhered to.\n\nRailway Board instructions contained in RBE 117/2016 have been violated.\n\nThis is a serious violation as the Ld. Solicitor General of India has given an\n\nundertaking to the Hon'ble Supreme Court as adduced in RBE 117/2016 that\n\nreservation in promotions will not be resorted to as per orders of the DOPT vide\n\nletters dated 10.8.2010 and 1.9.2010. The later letter dt 1.9.2010 was circulated\n\nby the Railway Board as RBE/126/2010. Learned Solicitor General has also\n\nstated that any action taken on the basis of letters dated 10.8.2010/1.9.2010 will\n\nbe construed as contempt of the Supreme Court. Respondents, we are sure, are\n\naware of the consequences of going against the advice of the Ld. Solicitor\n\nGeneral. Para 203.5 of IREM has not been followed. IREM instructions are\n\nstatutory in nature and therefore violating such instructions is a matter of serious\n\nconcern.\n \nVijayawada division of SCR has reverted the SC/ST employees for not\n\nfulfilling the preconditions of \nNagraj\n case, where as Secunderabad and Guntakal\n\ndivisions of SCR have not reverted the SC/ST employees albeit they too have\n\nnot complied with the preconditions of Nagraj. In the process, the law \nlaid down\n\nby\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court that there shall be a uniform policy for Railways\n\nwas brazenly ignored. Respondents have disobeyed their own instructions which\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court has not taken to kindly as per citations cited supra.\n\n 48 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n XXIV) Respondents, being a model employer, should not\n\ndiscriminate employees. On one hand to favour a section of employees they\n\nhave violated law, rules and the orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature\n\nat Hyderabad on the subject and on the other hand applicants have been denied\n\nthe legitimate benefits which they are eligible by gross violation of rules and\n\nlaw. Such action of the respondents fringes on hostile discrimination. Any\n\ndecision which is discriminatory has to be struck down, lest equals would be\n\nmade unequal's. Applicants in the instant case being more than equals to the 6\n\nSC/ST employees by being senior to them were made juniors i.e. unequals by\n\ntaking a decision which is not supported by rules or law. Respondents have not\n\nshown any valid principle to term their decision as rational. Our view is\n\nsupported by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:\n\n 27. \nIn \nRamana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of\n India\n(1979) 3 SCC 489 again this Court observed that a discriminatory\n action of the Government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be\n shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was\n based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational,\n unreasonable or discriminatory.\n\nTherefore the discriminatory decision of the respondents in not promoting the\n\napplicants has to be repudiated.\n\nAn addendum to the discriminative approach of the respondents was the\n\narbitrariness in taking a wrong decision. Hon'ble High Court has brought out\n\nlegal certainty in the issue by directing to abide by the Nagraj pre-conditions\n\nbefore proceeding in the matter. Respondents having admitted that it is the\n\nRailway Board which decides the policy and that they have not received any\n\ninstructions on the matter in question, the lower formation proceeding in the\n\nmatter was ill advised. By giving some margin to the respondents that the urge to\n\nresolve the issue was the prompter, yet it was not explained as to how an\n 49 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nincompetent authority like the CPO can lay down the policy in the absence of\n\ninstructions from the Railway Board and that too, in a way deviating from the\n\norders of the Hon'ble High Court. The discernable principle that emerges from\n\nthe impugned orders referred to does not pass the test of reasonableness. More so\n\nin the context of the facts and circumstances of the case. A mode and procedure\n\nwas prescribed by the Hon'lbe High Court which was apparently not adhered to.\n\nState action has to be based on reason. It is beyond comprehension as to why\n\nwithout fully engaging the Railway Board in the matter, local authorities have\n\nproceeded without any authorial jurisdiction. Governance has to be by rule of\n\nlaw and not as per the whims and fancies of those in power, however mighty\n\nthey may be. Hon'ble High Court has set the legal principles with many clear\n\ninstructions, perfect to the full stop and the coma. Yet not following them is a\n\nmatter of serious concern. Respondents gave many interpretations but the ones\n\nwhich were expected to uphold the legal principles postulated by the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court are missing. Thus the reply statements were hollow bereft of the\n\nsubstance required. \nThere are certain general principles which govern exercise of\n\npower in constitutional democracies. These principles are like reasonableness in\n\ntaking a decision, application of mind, non discrimination, consistency, fairness\n\nand so on. The said principles form the bed rock of administration. Decisions\n\nincongruent to the principles spoken of, would come under the domain of\n\narbitrariness. While making the above observations we are guided by the\n\ninterpretations given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nEast Coast Railway & Anr. v. Mahadev Appa Rao & Ors\n, and\n\nK. Surekha v.Mahadev Appa Rao & Ors. decided on July 7, 2010, in CA No.\n\n4964 of 2010 & Civil Appeal Nos. 4965-4966 of 2010,\n\nwhich is reproduced hereunder:\n\n 50 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n18. There is no precise statutory or other definition of the term\n\"arbitrary\". \nIn \nKumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Ors. v. State\nof U.P. and Ors.\n (AIR 1991 SC 537), this Court explained that\nthe true import of the expression \"arbitrariness\" is more easily\nvisualized than precisely stated or defined and that whether or\nnot an act is arbitrary would be determined on the facts and\ncircumstances of a given case. This Court observed:\n\n \"The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is\n more easily visualized than precisely stated or\n defined. The question, whether an impugned act is\n arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered on the\n facts and in the circumstances of a given case. An\n obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any\n discernible principle emerging from the impugned\n act and if so, does it satisfy the test of\n reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for\n doing an act and there is no impediment in\n following that procedure, performance of the act\n otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose\n any discernible principle which is reasonable, may\n itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every State\n action must be informed by reason and it follows\n that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule\n of law contemplates governance by laws and not by\n humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the\n governance is entrusted for the time being. It is trite\n that `be you ever so high, the laws are above you'.\n\n This is what men in power must remember,\n always.\"\n\n19. Dealing with the principle governing exercise of official\npower Prof. De Smith, Woolf & Jowell in their celebrated book\non \"Judicial Review of Administrative Action\" emphasized\nhow the decision-maker invested with the wide discretion is\nexpected to exercise that discretion in accordance with the\ngeneral principles governing exercise of power in a\nconstitutional democracy unless of course the statute under\nwhich such power is exercisable indicates otherwise. One of\nthe most fundamental principles of rule of law recognized in all\ndemocratic systems is that the power vested in any competent\nauthority shall not be exercised arbitrarily and that the power is\nexercised that it does not lead to any unfair discrimination. The\nfollowing passage from the above is in this regard apposite:\n\n 51 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\n \"We have seen in a number of situations how the\n scope of an official power cannot be interpreted in\n isolation from general principles governing the\n exercise of power in a constitutional democracy.\n\n The courts presume that these principles apply to\n the exercise of all powers and that even where the\n decision-maker is invested with wide discretion,\n that discretion is to be exercised in accordance\n with those principles unless Parliament clearly\n indicates otherwise. One such principle, the rule of\n law, contains within it a number of requirements\n such as the right of the individual to access to the\n law and that power should not be arbitrarily\n exercised. The rule of law above all rests upon the\n principle of legal certainty, which will be\n considered here, along with a principle which is\n partly but not wholly contained within the rule of\n law, namely, the principle of equality, or equal\n treatment without unfair discrimination.\"\n\nAny arbitrary decision infringing law has to be quashed since it is illegal. We\n\nfind the decisions of the respondents in not selecting the applicants in 2010 and\n\npublishing the integrated seniority list in 2017 as arbitrary and irrational.\n\nTherefore they for aforesaid reasons they get branded as illegal. Observations of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court when applied to the decisions of the respondents\n\nthey get marked as arbitrary without any iota of doubt.\n\nWhen we delve deep into the issue from the aspect of equality we cannot resist\n\nin observing that equality is a born enemy to arbitrariness. An arbitrary decision,\n\nlike the respondents decision, lacks constitutional logic thereby defying \nArticle\n\n14\n of the constitution. Non-arbitrariness pervades \nArticle 14\n like a flower in full\n\nbloom with the splendour of different hues of colour and irresistible fragrance.\n\nArticle 14\n dictates equal and fair treatment to the citizens. We find neither, in\n\nthe decisions of the respondents, despite the leading answers provided by the\n\nHon'ble High Court on the issue. There was a sweeping discretion invoked by\n\nan authority other than the incompetent authority in taking the decision, thereby\n\ndecision taken decaying into un-explainable arbitrariness leading to an absence\n 52 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nof a fair procedure to be followed, which is the soul of \nArticle 21.\n A body\n\nwithout a soul is as good as dead wood. So too, the decisions of the respondents\n\non the issue in question, given the background of the case and legal position as\n\nexpounded by the higher judicial fora in the matter. We draw inspiration in\n\nobserving, as we did, from the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nRoyappa, Maneka Gandhi and Charles Shobraj cases as inscribed below\n\n 3. \nIn \nE.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.\n(1974) 4 SCC 3 this Court observed as\n\n under: (SCC p. 38, para 85)\n\n ―85. ... From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to\n arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies;\n one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the\n whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is\n arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to\n political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of\n \nArticle 14\n, and if it affects any matter relating to public\n employment, it is also violative of \nArticle 16.\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n\n strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and\n equality of treatment.‖\n\n 24. \nIn \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n(1978) 1 SCC 248 this\n Court observed as under: (SCC pp. 283-84, para 7)\n\n ―7. ... Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and\n dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and\n doctrinaire limits. ... \nArticle 14\n strikes at arbitrariness in State action\n and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.\n \nThe principle of\n reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an\n essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades \nArticle 14\n\n like a brooding omnipresence....‖\n\n \nCharles Sobraj v. Supdt., Central Jail\n, (1978) 4 SCC 104\n\n Fair procedure is the soul of \nArticle 21\n, reasonableness of the restriction\n is the essence of \nArticle 19(5)\n and sweeping discretion degenerating into\n arbitrary discrimination is anathema for \nArticle 14.\n\nGoing forward, albeit we do not like to use strong expressions, but facts\n\nand circumstances of the case, compel us to state strongly with all the force\n\nwhich English language can command, that respondents have repeatedly\n 53 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nwronged the applicants by denying promotion due to the them. Allowing the\n\nrespondents to take advantage of the wrong done by them would tantamount to\n\nperpetuating injustice rather than doing justice to the persons wronged. Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observation in \nSomesh Tiwari v U.O.I & Ors\n in CA 7308 of\n\n2008, given hereunder, is relevant to the instant case.\n\n \n―27. This Court in \nCommissioner, Karnataka Housing Board v. C.\n Muddaiah\n, [(2007) 7 SCC 689 ] laid down the law, thus :-\n\n \"32. The matter can be looked at from another angle also. It is true that\n while granting a relief in favour of a party, the Court must consider the\n relevant provisions of law and issue appropriate directions keeping in\n view such provisions. There may, however, be cases where on the facts\n and in the circumstances, the Court may issue necessary directions in the\n larger interest of justice keeping in view the principles of justice, equity\n and good conscience. Take a case, where ex facie injustice has been meted\n out to an employee. In spite of the fact that he is entitled to certain\n benefits, they had not been given to him. His representations have been\n illegally and unjustifiably turned down. He finally approaches a Court of\n Law. The Court is convinced that gross injustice has been done to him and\n he was wrongfully, unfairly and with oblique motive deprived of those\n benefits. The Court, in the circumstances, directs the Authority to extend\n all benefits which he would have obtained had he not been illegally\n deprived of them. Is it open to the Authorities in such case to urge that as\n he has not worked (but held to be illegally deprived), he would not be\n granted the benefits? Upholding of such plea would amount to allowing a\n party to take undue advantage of his own wrong. It would perpetrate\n injustice rather than doing justice to the person wronged.\"\n\n \nXXV) Respondents have ex facie done injustice to the applicants.\n\nRepresentations did not evoke a just response. Facts do establish that the\n\nrespondents have unfairly denied the due promotion to the applicants. Taking\n\nadvantage of the wrong committed by the respondents in promoting the SC/ST\n\nemployees they are perpetuating the wrong by issuing notification and\n\nintegrated seniority list in 2017 against the legal principles \nlaid down by\n the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble High Courts, Hon'ble Principle Bench and\n 54 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nother Hon'ble benches of this Tribunal. Unless such actions are interdicted,\n\ngrave injustice would be done to the applicants.\n\n XXVI) From the aforementioned facts, evidently, the action of the\n\nrespondents is against rules, discriminative, arbitrary and hence illegal.\n\na) This Tribunal is of the considered view that the applicants should have\n\nbeen placed in the select panel dated 3.12.2010 against 2010 notification.\n\nHowever, since a stay is in operation in regard to the exam conducted with\n\nreference to an interlinked issue in W.P Nos.40693/2018 & 37990/2018 filed in\n\nthe Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad, the placement of the\n\napplicants in the panel dated 03.12.2010 has to necessarily wait till the disposal\n\nof the WPs and depending upon the final outcome of the writ petition. In the\n\nevent of their placement against the 2010 notification, as a logical corollary, they\n\nwould also be entitled to notional seniority from 3.12.2010 and allowed to draw\n\npay and allowances from the date of joining the promoted posts on notional basis\n\nand their pay re-fixed from the date of their actual joining and arrears thereof\n\nbeing paid.\n\n \nPlacement of the applicants with retrospective date shall apparently result\n\nin the reversion of 6 SC/ST employees who got their promotion. In the case of\n\nthose who are still in service, that exercise has to be carried out and after putting\n\nthem to notice, reversion orders be passed and their pay be re-fixed. However,\n\nexcess payment be not recovered in view of the dictum of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of \nState of Punjab vs Rafiq Masih\n (2015) 4 SCC 334. So is the case with\n\nreference to revision of pension to those who have already retired in that there\n\ncannot be any recovery of excess pension paid, and downward revision is also\n\nsubject to availability of any provisions in the Rules of Pension; otherwise not.\n\n \n55 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nThe respondents ought to draw the integrated seniority list and process the\n\nselection in regard to the notification dt.26.07.2017 by adhering to the\n\npreconditions \nlaid down in\n \nNagraj\n case and IREM\n\ninstructions on the subject, subsequent to the Railway Board laying down the\n\npolicy in regard to policy of reservation in promotions. Proper adherence to the\n\norders of the Hon'ble High Court on the subject is of paramount importance.\n\nInterpretive logic when it goes against the essence of law, will not hold good, as\n\nis seen in the instant case. Respondents may register the same.\n\n(b) While we were scribing the judgment, we had the opportunity\n\nto go through the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court pronounced on\n\n15.4.2019 dealing with the same subject in SLP (C) No. 30621/2011 &\n\nbatch which reads as under:\n\n―Issue notice in the fresh matters.\n\nUntil further orders, status quo, as it exists today, shall be maintained.\n\nList all the matters on 15.10.2019.‖\n\n Thus, the decision that shall be arrived at by the respondent being\n\ncontingent upon the final outcome of the cases presently under consideration of\n\nthe High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in respect of stay of the examination\n\nas stated above and of the Apex Court in respect of reservations in promotion in\n\nrespect of SC/ST category, they shall await the pronouncement of the verdict by\n 56 OA 636/2017 & batch\n\nthe Courts and consider the case of the applicants in tune with the final decision\n\nby the Courts. Periodical intimation to the applicants at a regular interval of\n\nthree months be also given.\n\n(c) Since the wheels of administration cannot be retarded by keeping any\n\nfuture vacancies unfilled the Hon'ble High Court has already directed to fill up\n\nthe future vacancies on ―in charge ‖ basis, and thus, the respondents shall abide\n\nby the said directions of the High Court.\n\n(d) With the above directions the OAs are disposed of. No order\n\nas to costs. MAs shall stand disposed of.\n\n (B.V. SUDHAKAR) (JUSTICE R. KANTHA RAO)\nADMINISTRATIVE MEMBER JUDICIAL MEMBER\n\n Dated, the 26th day of April, 2019\nevr",

Take a case, where ex facie injustice has been meted\n out to an employee. In spite of the fact that he is entitled to certain\n benefits, they had not been given to him. His representations have been\n illegally and unjustifiably turned down. He finally approaches a Court of\n Law. The Court is convinced that gross injustice has been done to him and\n he was wrongfully, unfairly and with oblique motive deprived of those\n benefits. The Court, in the circumstances, directs the Authority to extend\n all benefits which he would have obtained had he not been illegally\n deprived of them. Is it open to the Authorities in such case to urge that as\n he has not worked (but held to be illegally deprived), he would not be\n granted the benefits? Upholding of such plea would amount to allowing a\n party to take undue advantage of his own wrong. It would perpetrate\n injustice rather than doing justice to the person wronged.\""
