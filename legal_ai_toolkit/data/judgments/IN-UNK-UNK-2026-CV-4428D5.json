BASAVARAJA & ORS. .....Respondent(s)\n\n O R D E R\n\n 1. The first respondent along with the other respondents\n\n (second to fifth) stood trial before the Court of the\n\n Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court-II at Davangere,\n\n Karnataka for commission of offence punishable under \nsections\n\n 302\n, \n498A\n and \n201\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (‘\nIPC\n’,\n\n hereafter) read with \nsections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition\n\n Act (‘\nDP Act\n’, hereafter). Vide judgment and order dated 4th\n\n March, 2004, all the respondents were acquitted. The State of\n\n Karnataka carried the judgment and order of acquittal in appeal\n\n before the High Court. The High Court vide judgment and order\n\n dated 27th August, 2010 confirmed the acquittal of the\n\n respondents for the offences under \nsections 302\n and \n201\n of the\n\n IPC as well as \nsections 3\n and \n4\n of the DP Act; however,\n\n convicted the first respondent under \nsection 498A\n, IPC only. On\n\n the question of sentence, it was represented on behalf of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nAshwani Kumar\n\nDate: 2024.04.08\n\n first respondent before the High Court that he had been behind\n\n18:02:55 IST\n\nReason:\n\n bars for four years during the period of trial. Considering\n\n 1\n\n\fthat the maximum punishment that could be imposed under \nsection\n\n498A\n, IPC is three years, the High Court sentenced the first\n\nrespondent to the period of incarceration already undergone and\n\ndisposed of the appeal. This judgment and order of the High\n\nCourt is the subject matter of challenge in the present appeal,\n\nby special leave, at the instance of the State of Karnataka\n\n(‘appellant’, hereafter).\n\n2. At the outset, we are informed by the parties that\n\ncorrect representation had not been made before the High Court\n\nby counsel for the first respondent in respect of the period of\n\nincarceration suffered by him. He had been behind bars for a\n\nlittle less than seventeen months, and not four years as\n\nsubmitted.\n\n3. The trial stemmed from the unnatural death of Susheelamma\n\nwithin 7 years of her marriage. The first respondent happened\n\nto be her husband while the other respondents were her in-laws.\n\nAfter the First Information Report was registered under\n\nsections 498A\n and \n304B\n, IPC read with \nsections 3\n and \n4\n of the\n\nDP Act based on the complaint of Susheelamma’s brother (PW-1),\n\npolice report under \nsection 173(2)\n, Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nCode (‘Cr. PC.’, hereafter) was submitted before the relevant\n\nCourt by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Davangere City,\n\nSub-Division, Davangere, Karnataka. Bare perusal of the police\n\nreport reveals that materials collected during investigation\n\npointed towards suicidal death of Susheelamma owing to\n\nharassment meted out to her by the respondents for not having\n\nbrought with her requisite dowry at the time of marriage and\n\n 2\n\n\feven thereafter till her death. Despite the police report\n\nhaving been filed, inter alia, under \nsection 304B\n, IPC and\n\nsuggesting death of Susheelamma by suicide, charge against the\n\nrespondents was framed by the Sessions Court on 24th July, 2003,\n\ninter alia, under \nsection 302\n, IPC. This appears to us\n\ninexplicable in the absence of any material in the police\n\nreport suggesting commission of offence under \nsection 302\n, IPC.\n\nAssuming that the Sessions Court had reason to frame a charge\n\nunder \nsection 302\n, IPC, it is incomprehensible why no\n\nalternative charge under \nsection 304B\n, IPC was framed.\n\n4. Evidence was led by the prosecution. The Sessions Court\n\ndid not find adequate material on record to convict the\n\nrespondents under \nsection 302\n, IPC or any other relevant\n\nprovision resulting in an order of acquittal being recorded, as\n\nnoticed earlier. However, in appeal, only the first respondent\n\nwas found guilty of the offence under \nsection 498A\n, IPC by the\n\nHigh Court and erroneously sentenced premised on incorrect\n\nrepresentation in respect of the period of incarceration.\n\n5. We have observed on perusal of the impugned judgment\n\nbrushing aside by the High Court of the contention raised on\n\nbehalf of the appellant that sufficient materials were\n\navailable on record for convicting the first respondent as well\n\nas the other respondents under \nsection 304B\n, IPC merely on the\n\nground that no charge in that behalf had been framed and having\n\nregard to efflux of time, which had since occasioned since the\n\ndate of death, in the interest of justice, it would not look\n\ninto the evidence adduced by the prosecution for the purpose of\n\n 3\n\n\ffinding out whether there was any material for convicting the\n\nrespondents under \nsection 304B\n, IPC.\n\n6. Mr. Chidanand, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant, has taken serious exception to this approach of the\n\nHigh Court. According to him, the High Court occasioned grave\n\nfailure of justice in letting the respondents off on the twin\n\ngrounds of absence of any charge framed against them under\n\nsection 304B\n, IPC and long lapse of time. He contends that\n\nnotwithstanding such lapse, the High Court ought to have\n\nexamined whether the evidence on record were sufficient to\n\npresume dowry death of Susheelamma and whether the respondents\n\nshould have been proceeded against for commission of offence\n\npunishable under \nsection 304B\n, IPC; and, if the answers were in\n\nthe affirmative, it was the duty of the High Court to draw\n\nstatutory presumption and remit the case to the Sessions Court\n\nfor proceeding against the respondents to examine as to whether\n\nthey are liable for conviction under \nsection 304B\n, IPC.\n\nReferring to and relying on the testimony of PW-1 and\n\nSusheelamma’s parents, neighbours and an aunt (PWs 10, 12, 8,\n\n14 and 9, respectively), he further contends that since all the\n\ningredients of \nsection 304B\n, IPC were present, i.e., (i) death\n\nof Susheelamma occurred within 7 years of marriage; (ii) such\n\ndeath was due to circumstances other than normal; (iii)\n\nsufficient material was available on record to indicate that\n\nSusheelamma prior to her unnatural death was subjected to\n\ncruelty by the first respondent, which also stands proved by\n\nreason of his unchallenged conviction under \nsection 498A\n, IPC;\n\n 4\n\n\fand (iv) such cruelty was inflicted on Susheelamma owing to her\n\ninability to bring requisite dowry, the High Court grossly\n\nerred in not presuming dowry death of Susheelamma.\n\n7. Our attention has been drawn by Mr. Chidanand to the\n\ndecision of this Court in \nShamnsaheb M. Multtani vs. State of\n\nKarnataka1\n. Heavy reliance has been placed by him on such\n\ndecision in support of the prayer for remand to the Sessions\n\nCourt. The relevant paragraphs of \nthe said decision\n read as\n\nfollows:\n\n “13. … The question raised before us is whether in a\n case where prosecution failed to prove the charge under\n \nSection 302\n IPC, but on the facts the ingredients of\n section 304-B have winched to the fore, can the court\n convict him of that offence in the absence of the said\n offence being included in the charge.\n\n 17. The composition of the offence under \nSection\n 304-B\n IPC is vastly different from the formation of the\n offence of murder under \nSection 302\n IPC and hence the\n former cannot be regarded as minor offence vis-à-vis\n the latter. …\n\n 18. So when a person is charged with an offence under\n \nSections 302\n and \n498-A\n IPC on the allegation that he\n caused the death of a bride after subjecting her to\n harassment with a demand for dowry, within a period\n of 7 years of marriage, a situation may arise, as in\n this case, that the offence of murder is not\n established as against the accused. Nonetheless all\n other ingredients necessary for the offence under\n \nSection 304-B\n IPC would stand established. Can the\n accused be convicted in such a case for the offence\n under \nSection 304-B\n IPC without the said offence\n forming part of the charge?\n\n 21. The crux of the matter is this: Would there be\n occasion for a failure of justice by adopting such a\n course as to convict an accused of the offence under\n\n1 (2001) 2 SCC 577\n\n 5\n\nSection 304B\n IPC when all the ingredients necessary for\nthe said offence have come out in evidence, although he\nwas not charged with the said offence? …\n\n27. The postulates needed to establish the said\noffence are: (1) Death of a wife should have occurred\notherwise than under normal circumstances within seven\nyears of her marriage; (2) soon before her death she\nshould have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by\nthe accused in connection with any demand for dowry.\n\nNow reading \nsection 113B\n of the Evidence Act, as a part\nof the said offence, the position is this: If the\nprosecution succeeds in showing that soon before her\ndeath she was subjected by him to cruelty or harassment\nfor or in connection with any demand for dowry and that\nher death had occurred (within seven years of her\nmarriage) otherwise than under normal circumstances\n‘the court shall presume that such person had caused\nthe dowry death’.\n\n28. Under \nSection 4\n of the Evidence Act ‘whenever it\nis directed by this Act that the Court shall presume\nthe fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless and\nuntil it is disproved’. So the court has no option but\nto presume that the accused had caused dowry death\nunless the accused disproves it. It is a statutory\ncompulsion on the court. However it is open to the\naccused to adduce such evidence for disproving the said\ncompulsory presumption, as the burden is unmistakably\non him to do so. He can discharge such burden either by\neliciting answers through cross-examination of the\nwitnesses of the prosecution or by adducing evidence on\nthe defence side or by both.\n\n30. But the peculiar situation in respect of an\noffence under \nSection 304-B\n IPC, as discernible from\nthe distinction pointed out above in respect of the\noffence under \nSection 306\n IPC is this: Under the former\nthe court has a statutory compulsion, merely on the\nestablishment of two factual positions enumerated\nabove, to presume that the accused has committed dowry\ndeath. If any accused wants to escape from the said\ncatch the burden is on him to disprove it. If he fails\nto rebut the presumption the court is bound to act on\nit.\n\n 6\n\n\f31. Now take the case of an accused who was called\nupon to defend only a charge under \nSection 302\n IPC. The\nburden of proof never shifts on to him. It ever remains\non the prosecution which has to prove the charge beyond\nall reasonable doubt. The said traditional legal\nconcept remains unchanged even now. In such a case the\naccused can wait till the prosecution evidence is over\nand then to show that the prosecution has failed to\nmake out the said offence against him. No compulsory\npresumption would go to the assistance of the\nprosecution in such a situation. If that be so, when an\naccused has no notice of the offence under \nSection 304B\n\nIPC, as he was defending a charge under \nSection 302\n IPC\nalone, would it not lead to a grave miscarriage of\njustice when he is alternatively convicted under\n\nSection 304B\n IPC and sentenced to the serious\npunishment prescribed thereunder, which mandates a\nminimum sentence of imprisonment for seven years.\n\n34. In such a situation, if the trial court finds\nthat the prosecution has failed to make out the case\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC, but the offence under \nSection\n304-B\n IPC has been made out, the court has to call upon\nthe accused to enter on his defence in respect of the\nsaid offence. Without affording such an opportunity to\nthe accused, a conviction under \nSection 304-B\n IPC would\nlead to real and serious miscarriage of justice. Even\nif no such count was included in the charge, when the\ncourt affords him an opportunity to discharge his\nburden by putting him to notice regarding the prima\nfacie view of the court that he is liable to be\nconvicted under \nSection 304B\n IPC, unless he succeeds in\ndisproving the presumption, it is possible for the\ncourt to enter upon a conviction of the said offence in\nthe event of his failure to disprove the presumption.\n\n35. As the appellant was convicted by the High Court\nunder \nSection 304-B\n IPC, without such opportunity being\ngranted to him, we deem it necessary in the interest of\njustice to afford him that opportunity. The case in the\ntrial court should proceed against the appellant (not\nagainst the other two accused whose acquittal remains\nunchallenged now) from the stage of defence evidence.\nHe is put to notice that unless he disproves the\npresumption, he is liable to be convicted under \nsection\n304-B\n IPC. To facilitate the trial court to dispose of\n\n 7\n\n\f the case afresh against the appellant in the manner\n indicated above, we set aside the conviction and\n sentence passed on him by the High Court and remand the\n case to the trial court.”\n\n8. It is, accordingly, prayed by Mr. Chidanand that upon\n\nsetting aside of the impugned judgment and order of the High\n\nCourt except to the extent of recording of conviction against\n\nthe first respondent under \nsection 498A\n, IPC, the Sessions\n\nCourt may be directed to re-start the trial against the\n\nrespondents from the stage of defence evidence in order to\n\nafford them fair opportunity of defence to disprove the\n\npresumption of dowry death under \nsection 304B\n, IPC read with\n\nsection 113B\n of the Evidence Act, 1872.\n\n9. Mr. Kotemath, learned counsel appearing for the first\n\nrespondent as well as the other respondents, on the other hand,\n\ncontends that the materials on record are insufficient to grant\n\nrelief on terms as claimed by learned counsel for the\n\nappellant. He was heard to submit that the dead body of\n\nSusheelamma was not found in the house where Susheelamma and\n\nthe first respondent were residing together just prior to the\n\nformer’s death; on the contrary, the dead body of Susheelamma\n\nwas found in her paternal home. It is further submitted that\n\nthe material witnesses for the prosecution were interested\n\nwitnesses and, therefore, the Sessions Court was entirely\n\ncorrect in not relying on their evidence. He also submits that\n\nthere is no material on record to link the in-laws of\n\nSusheelamma (respondents 2 to 5) to the alleged offence and\n\n 8\n\n\fthat only general allegations have been levelled against them\n\nby the prosecution witnesses and on account thereof, no order\n\nadverse to their interest is called for. He, thus, prayed for\n\ndismissal of the appeal.\n\n10. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on\n\nperusal of the materials on record, we are of the opinion that\n\nthe High Court, to a substantial extent, grossly erred in\n\ndeciding the appeal in the manner it did and that the appeal\n\ndeserves to succeed by remitting the case to the Sessions Court\n\nfor the purpose of trying only the first respondent, and not\n\nthe other respondents, in the manner indicated in the decision\n\nin \nShamnsaheb M. Multtani\n (supra).\n\n11. The testimonies of the relevant witnesses for the\n\nprosecution, which were read in Court by Mr. Chidanand, leave\n\nno manner of doubt that dowry death of Susheelamma could be and\n\nought to have been presumed. All the ingredients for framing of\n\na charge under \nsection 304B\n, IPC were present and quite\n\nmindlessly, an exercise appears to have been undertaken to nail\n\nthe respondents for committing offence punishable under \nsection\n\n302\n, IPC overlooking the contents of the police report under\n\nsection 173(2), Cr. PC suggesting suicidal death. The Sessions\n\nCourt while framing charge under \nsection 302\n, IPC, in our\n\nopinion, did not apply its judicial mind resulting in non-\n\nframing of an alternative charge under \nsection 304B\n, IPC. The\n\nHigh Court too failed to address the problem in the proper\n\nperspective and, thus, disabled itself from rendering justice\n\nto the parties. Merely because a charge under \nsection 304B\n, IPC\n\n 9\n\n\fhad not been framed and there had been lapse of time did not\n\nafford any ground to the High Court to distance itself from\n\nfollowing the settled law and ordering a remand.\n\n11. We find no reason to accept the argument advanced on\n\nbehalf of the respondents that the dead body of Susheelamma was\n\nfound in her paternal home. In fact, we have found a specific\n\nfinding in the judgment of the Sessions Court that both the\n\nfirst respondent and Susheelamma were residing together in a\n\nhouse in Suez Plot and that the dead body of the latter was\n\nfound in such house. Having regard thereto and also in the\n\nlight of the testimony of the neighbour (PW-14), it would\n\nentirely be for the first respondent to explain as to how\n\nSusheelamma died and under what circumstances in terms of\n\nprovisions contained in \nsection 106\n of the Evidence Act.\n\nSignificantly, it is in the evidence of PW-14 that while she\n\nwas brooming at about 4.00 hours of 19 th December, 2002, she saw\n\nthe first respondent cross the “drain that is situated in front\n\nof all the houses”. It is also in the evidence of PW-14 that an\n\nhour or two earlier, she had been woken up by the sound of a\n\nmeowing cat and then had heard the scream of a woman coming\n\nfrom the house of the first respondent, whereupon she assumed\n\nthat someone must have been harassing a woman in the night\n\nhours.\n\n12. The next argument that PWs 1, 10 and 12 are interested\n\nwitnesses and hence their evidence lacks credence has been\n\nadvanced only to be rejected. A lady facing harassment and\n\ncruelty owing to her or her family’s failure to meet dowry\n\n 10\n\n\fdemands would more often than not confide in her immediate\n\nfamily members. If the evidence of the family members in a case\n\nof dowry death is to be discarded on the ground that they are\n\ninterested witnesses, we wonder who would be the reliable\n\nwitness to testify for bringing the culprit to book. We have no\n\nhesitation in rejecting the argument as one wholly without\n\nsubstance.\n\n13. The further argument that materials are insufficient to\n\npresume a dowry death need not detain us for too long. The\n\ningredients for presuming a dowry death, as submitted by Mr.\n\nChidanand and noted by us in paragraph 6 are present. That\n\napart, PW-12 was categorical in her assertion that even six\n\ndays prior to her death, Susheelamma had complained to PW-12\n\nthat the first respondent beat Susheelamma for failing to meet\n\nhis demand to bring Rs.50,000/- or to get a job for him.\n\n14. However, we are in agreement with Mr. Kotemath that\n\nallegations levelled against the other respondents (in-laws of\n\nSusheelamma) are general in nature and that no specific overt\n\nacts are attributed calling for interference with the order\n\nacquitting them.\n\n15. We are conscious of the law as well as decisions of this\n\nCourt holding that an accused could be convicted for an offence\n\nfor which no charge was framed if the accused is aware of the\n\nbasic ingredients of the offence with which he could have been\n\ncharged and if no failure of justice would occasion, provided\n\nfair chance of defence is extended to him. Even then, we feel\n\npersuaded to follow the decision in \nShamnsaheb M. Multtani\n\n 11\n\n\f(supra) not only because we are bound by it (the same having\n\nbeen rendered by three Hon’ble Judges) but also because that\n\ntoo was a case where both \nsections 302\n and \n304-B\n, IPC were\n\ninvolved, as in the present appeal, and the approach followed\n\ntherein has our concurrence as the correct approach. Hence,\n\nfollowing the same, an opportunity is required to be extended\n\nas part of the assurance of a fair trial and reasonableness of\n\nthe procedure established by law to enable the first respondent\n\nrebut the presumption of dowry death drawn in terms of the\n\nprovisions contained in \nsection 304B\n IPC read with \nsection 113B\n\nof the Evidence Act. However, we repeat that notwithstanding\n\nthe availability of evidence and materials on record sufficient\n\nto draw a presumption of dowry death of Susheelamma, such\n\npresumption is, of course, rebuttable and such presumption is\n\nopen to be rebutted if the first respondent adduces relevant\n\nevidence sufficient for a prudent man to believe the existence\n\nof circumstances put forward by him leading to the death of\n\nSusheelamma as probable without he being responsible in any\n\nmanner; however, should such presumption be not rebutted, a\n\nconviction under \nsection 304B\n, IPC could logically follow.\n\n16. Bearing the same in mind and considering the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, the impugned judgment is liable to limited\n\ninterference in exercise of our appellate jurisdiction as\n\nindicated hereafter. The first respondent not having challenged\n\nhis conviction recorded by the High Court under \nsection 498A\n,\n\nIPC, the same is sustained; however, the sentence stands set\n\naside since it was admittedly based on incorrect representation\n\n 12\n\n\fof facts. Further, acquittal recorded by the Sessions Court,\n\nsince affirmed by the High Court, qua the other respondents\n\n(second to fifth) is also maintained. Also, acquittal recorded\n\nby the High Court in respect of the other offences against the\n\nfirst respondent (except \nsection 302\n, IPC) is set aside. The\n\ncase is remitted to the Sessions Court for proceeding further\n\nand to take the same to its logical conclusion in accordance\n\nwith law upon granting reasonable opportunity to both the\n\nprosecution and the defence.\n\n17. We clarify that the Sessions Court, on remand as ordered\n\nby us, shall proceed with the trial from the stage of defence\n\nevidence. The first respondent has been adequately put on\n\nnotice that unless he disproves the presumption of dowry death,\n\nhe is liable to be convicted under \nsection 304B\n, IPC. He shall,\n\ntherefore, be at liberty to disprove the presumption of dowry\n\ndeath by adducing relevant evidence. Upon evidence being\n\nadduced, or if no evidence is adduced, the Sessions Court shall\n\nproceed to conclude the trial in accordance with law, as\n\nexpeditiously as possible. The Sessions Court shall be free to\n\ndraw its own conclusions and observations made hereinabove will\n\nnot stand in the way of conducting a fair trial, which is the\n\nessence of the criminal justice system. Irrespective of the\n\noutcome of the trial to be resumed in terms of this order, the\n\nSessions Court shall also be free to decide on the sentence to\n\nbe imposed on the first respondent for the conviction recorded\n\nagainst him by the High Court in respect of the offence under\n\nsection 498A\n, IPC.\n\n 13\n\n\f18. To facilitate the Sessions Court to dispose of the case\n\nagainst the first respondent in the manner that we have\n\nindicated above and to avoid delay, we direct the first\n\nrespondent to appear before the Sessions Court on 3rd June, 2024\n\nand also grant him the liberty to seek bail. Till 3rd June,\n\n2024, he shall not be arrested. Upon the first respondent\n\napplying for bail, the Sessions Court shall enlarge him on bail\n\nsubject to such terms and conditions as it deems fit and proper\n\nto impose. Should the first respondent not appear on 3rd June,\n\n2024, the Sessions Court shall be entitled to secure his\n\npresence in accordance with law.\n\n19. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above and on\n\nthe aforesaid terms.\n\n20. The trial court records be sent back forthwith.\n\n21. Pending application(s), if any, including the application\n\nfor impleadment of PW-1 shall also stand disposed of.\n\n ...................J.\n (DIPANKAR DATTA)\n\n ....................J.\n (S.V.N.

Even\nif no such count was included in the charge, when the\ncourt affords him an opportunity to discharge his\nburden by putting him to notice regarding the prima\nfacie view of the court that he is liable to be\nconvicted under \nSection 304B\n IPC, unless he succeeds in\ndisproving the presumption, it is possible for the\ncourt to enter upon a conviction of the said offence in\nthe event of his failure to disprove the presumption."
