Krishnamurthy, Manapakkam (HPCL) are\nlocated within the geographical area of Kanchipuram District (GA ID 9.61)\nauthorized to the Complainant; ; and (2) direct the Respondent to pay\ndamages to the Complainant of Rs. 3,00,00,000/- (Rupees Three crores\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 2 of 184\n\n only) for each CNG Station where it has started undertaking works which\naggregates to an amount of Rs. 57,00,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Seven Crores)\nfor the nineteen CNG Stations being developed by Respondent in\nKanchipuram GA; (c) direct the 2nd Respondent to cease and desist from\nlaying, building or operating any CGD network in Kanchipuram District GA\n9.61; and (d) direct the 2nd Respondent to cease and desist from\nestablishing or operating the afore-stated 19 CNG Stations in respect of\nwhich the Appellant had filed Complaint No. Legal/11/2022 before the\nRespondent Board against the 2nd Respondent.\n\n2. The Respondent PNGRB, vide letter dated 26.09.2018, granted\nauthorization to the Appellant for development of a City Gas Distribution\nNetwork in the Geographical Area (GA) of Kanchipuram District under the\nPNGRB (Authorizing entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand City or Local\nNatural Gas Distribution Networks) Regulations, 2008 (hereinafter referred\nto as the \"2008 Regulations\"). The terms and conditions of the authorization\nletter was accepted by the Appellant, after the judgement of the Supreme\nCourt in \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, vide letter dated 20.02.2020. The Board, vide letter dated\n07.09.2018, granted authorization to the 2nd Respondent for development of\nthe City Gas Distribution Network in the Geographical Area (GA) of Chennai\nand Tiruvallar Districts. The terms and conditions of the authorization letter\nwere accepted by the 2nd Respondent vide letter dated 11.09.2018. The\nAppellant filed a complaint before the PNGRB, under Section 21(3) read\nwith \nSection 12(1)(b)\n, \n23\n, \n25\n and \n13 (1) (g)\n of the PNGRB Act, 2006 against\nthe 2nd Respondent, alleging infringement of their rights including\ninfrastructure exclusivity and marketing exclusivity vested with it under the\nCity or Local Gas Distribution Network Authorized for the Geographical Area\nof Kanchipuram District. After adjudicating the said complaint, the PNGRB\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 3 of 184\n\n passed its final judgement dated 22.12.2022 in Case No. Legal/11/2022\nwhich is now under appeal.\n\n3. In its order dated 26.04.2023, this Tribunal recorded the submissions\nof parties that the issue was confined to disputes pertaining to 19 CNG\nStations which are (i) Ram Filling Station, Neelankarai (IOCL); (ii) Vasanth\nEnterprises, Kottivakkam (IOCL); (iii) Sree Hanisha, Kottivakkam (IOCL); (iv)\nVSV Agency, Perungudi (IOCL); (v) Lakshmikantham Service Station,\nPallikaranai (IOCL); (vi) VK Enterprises Coco, Madipakkam (IOCL); (vii)\nSree Balaji Enterprises, Ullagaram (IOCL); (viii) Om Sakthivel Agencies,\nAdambakkam (IOCL); (ix) Kris Enterprises, Vettuvankeni (BPCL); (x) Sree\nVari Enterprises, Kottivakkam (BPCL); (xi) HU Sreeram Agency, Pallikaranai\n(BPCL); (xii) ICPL Fuel Station, St. Thomas Mount (BPCL); (xiii) ASM Abdul\nKadir, Menambakkam Airport (BPCL); (xiv) JSK Fuel Station, Kovur (BPCL);\n\n(xv) Krishnaveni Service Station, Paraniputhur (BPCL); (xvi)\nNandambakkam Petroleum, Nandambakkam (BPCL); (xvii) Metro\nPetroleum, Kovilambakkam (HPCL); (xviii) Krishnaraj & Co.,Menambakkam\nAirport (HPCL); and (xix) R. Krishnamurthy, Manapakkam (HPCL).\n\n4. As shall be detailed later in this judgement, it was submitted, on behalf\nof the 2nd Respondent, that a part of the then Kanchipuram District, where\nthese 19 CNG Stations were located, was included in GA 9.62 for which an\nauthorisation was granted in their favour. The dispute, in the present appeal,\nrevolves mainly around which GA the afore-said 19 CNG stations are\nlocated. While the appellant contends that they all fall within Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA (ie GA 9.61) authorisation for which was granted in their favour,\nboth the PNGRB and the 2nd Respondent submit that they fall within Chennai\n& Tiruvallur Districts GA (ie GA 9.62) authorisation for which was granted in\nfavour of the 2nd Respondent.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 4 of 184\n\n 5. The appellant seeks to support its claim that GA 9.61 is co-terminus\nwith the then Kanchipuram District, among others, on the basis that (1) nine\nof the towns/villages with population of more than 5000, in which 15 of the\n19 CNG Stations are located, have all been identified in the annexed map\nitself as falling within Kanchipuram District GA; (2) these towns/ villages and\ntalukas (in which these 15 CNG stations are located) are not reflected in the\nChennai & Tiruvallur District GA (ie GA 9.62) map which was enclosed along\nwith the authorisation letter issued to the 2nd Respondent; (3) the charge\nareas of GA 9.61 correspond with the Talukas of the then Kanchipuram\nDistrict; (4) the Kanchipuram District Boundary line in black overlaps the\nKanchipuram District GA Boundary line in pink; (5) the area of the GA in sq\nkms tallies with the area of Kanchipuram District as reflected in the 2011\ncensus handbook; (6) the fact that the error in the area, as recorded in the\noriginal authorisation, was corrected by the Board at the appellant's request,\nto reflect the area mentioned in (5) above, is also a tacit admission by the\nBoard that the boundaries of Kanchipuram District GA are co-terminus with\nthe boundaries of Kanchipuram District; (7) the population and number of\nhouseholds as shown in the map of Kanchipuram District GA tallies with the\npopulation and number of households of the then Kanchipuram District as\nper the 2011 Census Hand Book; and these and other factors conclusively\nestablish that all these 19 CNG stations fall within Kanchipuram District and\nresultantly within Kanchipuram District GA for which an authorisation was\ngranted in favour of the appellant; and a co-ordinates based exercise cannot\nbe undertaken to ascertain the locations of these stations, more so as no co-\nordinates of the CNG stations have been independently ascertained by the\nBoard, and the Board has accepted the 2nd Respondent's case without\nindependent application of mind.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 5 of 184\n\n 6. On the other hand, the case of the Board and the 2nd Respondent, in\n\nshort, is that, since the physical map, enclosed along with the application\n\ncum bid document and the letter of authorisation, indicate the co-ordinates\n\nof both GA 9.61 and 9.62, which admittedly coalesce and do not overlap, the\n\nscientific method to be applied, to establish where these 19 CNG Stations\n\nare located, is the Co-ordinates test; and all other modes of identification of\n\nits exact location, relied upon by the appellant, are either irrelevant or pale\n\ninto insignificance as compared to the co-ordinates test.\n\n7. Yet another aspect which must be taken note of is that neither the\n\nAppellant nor the second Respondent seek to have entire process followed\n\nby the PNGRB, in granting authorisation for Kanchipuram District GA in\n\nfavour of the Appellant and Chennai- Tiruvallur Districts GA in favour of the\n\nsecond Respondent, set aside. The inter-se dispute is confined only to these\n\n19 CNG Stations in that, while the Appellant's claim that the 19 CNG stations\n\nin dispute would fall within their GA and it should be permitted to operate\n\nthem, the submission urged on behalf of the second Respondent is that\n\nthese 19 CNG Stations falls within their GA and, since they are continuing\n\nto operate these CNG stations, no interference is called for.\n\n II. A BRIEF BACKGROUND:\n\n8. The Application-Cum-Bid Documents for the 9th round of bidding, for\n\nvarious Geographical Areas including GA 9.61 (Kanchipuram District GA)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 6 of 184\n\n and GA 9.62 (Chennai-Thiruvallur Districts GA), were web-hosted by the\n\nPNGRB on its portal on 12.04.2018. Bids were invited separately for each\n\nGA. Annexure-1 of the Application-Cum-Bid-Document (ACBD) of\n\nKanchipuram District GA i.e. GA 9.61 contains a map which is as under:\n\n9. The left side of the map is the physical map of Kanchipuram District\nGA and the longitude and latitudes i.e. coordinates are reflected on all four\nsides of the said map. On the right side of the map is the total area of the\nGA in square kilometers i.e. 4483 sq kms, the total population of the GA is\nshown as 39,98,252, the total households in the GA are shown as 10,08,246,\nand the total number of charge areas in the GA are recorded as 11. The\ncharge area ID and the name of each of these 11 charge areas is then\ndetailed on the right side of the map. Thereafter is a table titled Legends, on\nthe left side of which is the Vector and the righthand side is the Landmark.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 7 of 184\n\n Under the sub-head Vector, details of the identification marks of (1) district\nHeadquarters, (2) Towns, (3) Villages with population of 5000 and above,\n(4) National highway, (5) State Highway, (6) Railway, (7) GA boundary, (8)\ndistrict boundary, (9) sub-district boundary, (10) forest, and (11) water body\nare furnished. Under the sub-head Landmark, identification marks are given\nfor (1) airport, (2) hospital, (3) police station, and (4) railway. Thereafter,\ndetails of the map scale are furnished, the map date is shown as April 2018,\nand the map table is shown Geographical Area Kanchipuram District. The\nGA boundary of the physical map (ie Kanchipuram District GA) on the left\nside is shown in pink and the district boundary of Kanchipuram district is\nshown in black, both of which overlap. The 11 charge areas are also\ndemarcated in the said map. The Appellant contends that each of these 11\ncharge areas are in fact the Talukas of the then Kanchipuram District and\nthe total area of these 11 charge areas is 4483 square kilometers which is\nthe area of Kanchipuram District as well as Kanchipuram District GA.\n\n10. As noted hereinabove, the map annexed to the ACBD (and later with\nthe authorization letter) contains identification marks of villages with\npopulation of 5000 and above. It is not in dispute that 15 of the subject 19\nCNG stations are located in 9 villages with a population of 5000 and more,\nthe details of which are as under:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 8 of 184\n\n 11. That these 9 villages are located in the Kanchipuram GA map is\n\nevident from the enlarged map of Kanchipuram GA which is as under:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 9 of 184\n\n 12. Likewise, along with the Application-Cum-Bid-Document of GA 9.62\ni.e. Chennai and Thiruvallur Districts GA, the following map was enclosed:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 10 of 184\n\n 13. We had recorded in our earlier order that the learned Senior Counsel,\nappearing both on behalf of the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent, had\nagreed that the maps of Kanchipuram District GA (9.61) and Chennai-\nThiruvallur district GA (9.62) coaelesce, and do not overlap. Consequently,\nthese 15 CNG stations either fall in Kanchipuram district GA i.e. GA 9.61 or\nin Chennai-Thiruvallur Districts GA i.e. GA 9.62. As shall be detailed\nhereinafter, both the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations obligate the\nPNGRB to clearly identify the GAs before inviting bids for grant of\nauthorisation for such GAs. Before considering this aspect, we must,\nhowever, first deal with the rival contentions urged by the learned Senior\nCounsel and learned Counsel appearing on behalf of parties of either side.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 11 of 184\n\n 14. Before doing so, it is necessary to note the contents of the impugned\nOrder passed by the PNGRB.\n\n III. CONTENTS OF THE IMPUGNED ORDER:\n\n15. In the impugned Order dated 22.12.2022, the PNGRB observed that a\ncomplaint was filed by the Appellant, before the PNGRB on 11.04.2022, under\n\nSection 21(3)\n read with \nSection 12(1)(b)\n, \n23\n, \n25\n, \n13(1)(g)\n and other\napplicable provisions of the \nPetroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board\nAct, 2006\n (\"the 2006 Act\" for short), and the Extant applicable Regulations.\nagainst the 2nd Respondent - Torrent Gas Chennai Private Limited for\ninfringement of their rights, including infrastructure exclusivity and marketing\nexclusivity, under the City or Local Gas Distribution Network (hereinafter\nreferred to as 'CGD Network'), and Authorisation for Geographical Area\n(hereinafter referred to as the 'GA') of Kanchipuram District.\n\n16.

The relevant facts, as noted in the impugned Order, are that the\nPNGRB invited bids on 12.04.2018 for the 9th CGD Bidding Round for\nvarious Geographical areas, including the Geographical Areas of Chennai-\nTiruvallur, and Kanchipuram Districts. Pursuant thereto the PNGRB, vide\nletter dated 07.09.2018, granted the authorization for the development of\nCGD Network in the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur District in favour of the 2nd\nRespondent, the terms and conditions of which were accepted by the 2nd\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 12 of 184\n\n Respondent on 11.09.2018. The press release issued by the Board on\n14.09.2018, identifying successful bidders for the 86 authorized GAs, was\nsubjected to challenge before this Tribunal in \n'Adani Gas Limited vs\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board & Anr.' (Appeal No.\n \n292 of\n2018), and 'IMC Limited vs Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board &\nAnr.'(Appeal No.\n 323 of 2018).\n\n18. The Board, vide letter dated 26.09.2018, granted authorization of\nKanchipuram District GA in favour of the appellant. Attached to the\nauthorization is a map which is as under:-\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 13 of 184\n\n \n19.

The Supreme Court, vide its Judgment\ndated 17.02.2020, disposed of Civil Appeal No. 3992 of 2019 titled \n'Adani\nGas Limited vs Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board & Ors.\n',\nagreeing with the order passed by the Technical Member and upholding the\nauthorization granted for Kanchipuram District GA to the Complainant and\nfor Chennai & Tiruvallur District to the 2nd Respondent. Thereafter the\nappellant, vide letter dated 20.02.2020, accepted the terms and conditions\nof the authorization letter dated 26.09.2018.\n\n20. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited ('hereinafter referred to\nas the HPCL'), vide email dated 17.06.2021 enclosed a list of sample\nlayouts provided by the 2nd Respondent to HPCL for installation of\nCompressed Natural Gas ('hereinafter referred to as the CNG) facilities in\nChennai, and informed the appellant that discussions were in progress, and\nthey were interested in facilitating CNG installation at their outlet in the\nSubject GA. The appellant, vide email dated 17.06.2021 informed HPCL that\ncertain petrol station were falling under their GA; in reply thereto HPCL, vide\nemail dated 21.06.2021, informed the appellant that the 2nd Respondent was\nclaiming that four out of five CNG stations were falling in their GA; the\nappellant vide email dated 07.07.2021 informed HPCL that the Subject GA\ncomprises the areas of Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu; the location of CNG\nStation Nos. 1 to 4 fall under the subject GA authorized to the appellant;\nHPCL, vide email dated 08.07.2021, requested the 2nd Respondent to\nresolve the issue, regarding location(s) of CNG Station No. 1 to 4, with the\nappellant as HPCL had already started work at CNG Station No. 2; the 2nd\nRespondent, vide email dated 08.07.2021, informed HPCL that 'KMZ' Map\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 14 of 184\n\n shared by them with HPCL was the official map of their GA issued by the\nPNGRB and, unless the Board notified revised GA boundaries, the said KMZ\nmap had to considered as the official boundaries of the GA.\n\n21. The impugned Order thereafter records that the appellant, vide letter\ndated 17.08.2021, had informed the Board that it had issued Tender No.\nPNGRB/Auth-1/CGD(03)/2021 \"For Supplying GIS Bases Geographical\nArea Maps\", which was based on the Survey of India Map and, if the Board\nhas finalized the agencies to provide the maps, the Complainant may\nprocure the same from the agencies with due permission of the Board, and\nthey be provided with the digital map of the subject GA; in response thereto,\nthe Board, vide letter dated 23.09.2021, informed that Tender No.\nPNGRB/Auth-1/CGD(03)/2021 for supplying GIS based Geographical Area\nMap, was cancelled, and no agency was hired for the said tender; a GIS\nMap, indicating the respective GA and its boundaries, had already been\nprovided along with the authorization letters of the Subject GA; the district\nboundaries with the GAs were considered to be defined by the Survey of\nIndia/Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India or the\nrespective local authority such as the District Administration; and, in case\nany confirmation was required in relation to a district boundary, the same\nshall be dealt directly with the District Administration or the Municipal\nCorporation; the appellant, vide letter dated 23.09.2021, requested the Chief\nController of Explosives, Petroleum & Explosives Safety Organization\n(PESO) to provide the list of 19 locations falling within the subject GA where\nthe 2nd Respondent was undertaking works to establish CNG stations, and not\nto consider any request of the 2nd Respondent pertaining to the same.\n\n22. In order to verify the limits of the district, the appellant, vide letter\ndated 24.09.2021, requested the District Collector, Kancipurram to provide\nthe district map of the Subject GA according to Census of India, 2011;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 15 of 184\n\n subsequently, the District Collector provided the verified map of\nKanchipuram District. Relying on the map provided by the District Collector,\nthe appellant vide letter(s) dated 19.10.2021, provided details of the\nboundaries of the Subject GA all the Oil Marketing Companies (OMC), and\ninformed them that setting up of CNG Stations by the 2nd Respondent in the\nsubject GA was in violation of the \nPNGRB Act\n and the authorization vested\nwith the appellant; thereafter, vide letter dated 31.01.2021, the appellant\ninformed the 2nd Respondent that they were attempting to set up CNG\ndispensing facilities in the Subject GA. They were requested to stop the\nconstruction activities undertaken at various retail outlets. In response\nthereto, the 2nd Respondent, vide its letter dated 22.02.2022, clarified that\nChennai GA was spread over certain parts of Kanchipuram, as per the map\nweb-hosted by the Board, during the bidding process, and the activities\ncarried out by the 2nd Respondent were in compliance with the Geo-\nCoordinate Boundary of Chennai GA; the appellant, vide letter dated\n19.01.2022, informed the Board that an error had occurred in para 1 of the\nterms and conditions of the authorization letter dated 26.09.2018 mentioning\nthe total authorized area of the GA to be '6936.50 sq. kilometres' instead of\n'4483 sq. kilometres' and sought correction of the same, which was\naccepted by the Board vide letter 31.01.2022.\n\n23. Alleging that the Respondent was still in the process of construction\nwork of the CNG Stations in the Subject GA, the appellant filed the complaint\non 11.04.2022, and after notice and completion of pleadings, the matter was\nfinally heard on 07.07.2022. In order to get a ground report, the Board, vide\norder dated 29.09.2022, constituted a three members committee to visit the\ndisputed area on 06.10.2022, and directed status quo to be maintained. On\nthe report of the Committee being placed before it on 18.10.2022, the Board\ndirected certified copy of the Committee Report to be supplied to the parties\nto enable them to file their objections.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 16 of 184\n\n 24. After extracting the contents of the report, the impugned order records\nthe relief sought by the appellant and their contentions. Their contentions\nare (1) the 2nd Respondent is encroaching upon the area of the Subject GA\nhaving set up and operating 3 CNG Station. They are in process of setting up\n16 more CNG Stations. (2) the 2nd Respondent has not disputed that the\ntown/villages and charge area, where the subject CNG Stations are located,\nare specified by name in the map annexed with the authorization letter\nissued to the Complainant, by the Board. (3) the contention of the 2nd\nRespondent that the names of these towns/villages and charge area are to\nbe ignored, and only the contours of the boundary of the map with reference\nto the Geospatial Coordinates i.e. Latitude and Longitude, which will result\nin the Subject CNG Stations falling within the GA of the Respondent. (4) in\nterms of the Public Notice dated 10.03.2016, the Board issued a tender for\nhiring vendors for supplying customised maps. Clause 17.1.1 specifies the\nscope of the work for the vendors which includes preparation of Individual\nGA Maps depicting the Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal as Charge Area and pointing to\nimportant town/cities District HQ and National/State Highway on the map. (5)\npursuant to the public notice dated 10.03.2016, the Board identified a list of\npossible CGD GAs for the upcoming CGD Bidding Round. The said public\nnotice made it explicit that the concept of GA for CGD Bidding was based on\nthe district concept. (6) the Board specified its attention to consider\nTaluka/Tehsil/Mandal as Charge Area, by another public notice dated\n24.02.2018 and 01.03.2018. The public notice dated 24.02.2018 was issued\ndistrict wise, later on public notice was issued GA wise. Both the public\nnotices emphasise that the identification of GA was based on the\nAdministrative Districts. (7) By the public notice dated 01.03.2018, the Board\nemphasised that the basis of identification of the GA was Administrative\nDistrict, and GA 9.61 comprised of Kanchipuram District and GA 9.62\ncomprised of Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts. (8) the public notice dated\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 17 of 184\n\n 01.03.2018 shows that the Board gave wide publicity of its intention to form\none GA comprising of Administrative Districts of Kanchipuram and another\nGA comprising of Administrative Districts of Chennai & Tiruvallur. At no\nstage, the Board formed any opinion with respect to such co-ordinates, by\nwhich the 2nd Respondent was allegedly authorized. (9) by Public Notice No:\n\nPNGRB/MAPS/2018 dated 18.01.2018, the Board, through a vendor,\nundertook the exercise of preparation of maps on the same scope of work\nas of the public notice dated 10.03.2016. (10) the Application-cum-Bid\ndocument (hereinafter referred to as 'ACBD') dated 06.04.2018 was issued\nwith the identification of the GA and the Charge Area on the basis of\nAdministrative District and Talukas/Tehsils/Mandals respectively. The stand\nof the Board, as recorded in para 47 of the Judgment of APTEL in Appeal\nNo. 292/2018 dated 28.02.2019, was that the GAs were identified with\nreference to Administrative Districts as they existed at the time of the census\nof the year 2011. It was the case of the 2nd Respondent before APTEL that\nthey had been authorized by the Board which is, in fact, the same as the\nAdministrative District and the same was admitted by the 2nd Respondent in\nits pleadings. (11) the 2nd Respondent's contention, in the proceedings\nbefore APTEL and the Supreme Court, was that the description by name of\nthe charge areas, number of households and population mentioned in the\nauthorized map were not relevant. This is wholly inconsistent with its own\nstand in respect of GA 9.72. In those proceedings, when the 2nd Respondent\nobserved that there was an error in these figures, when compared with\nadministrative boundaries and data, it was brought to the knowledge of the\nBoard, that with respect to the Subject GA, no such error was highlighted.\nThus, the 2nd Respondent accepted the description of Charge Area, and the\npopulation in GA 9.61 & 9.62, was correct. The 2nd Respondent was now\nestopped from taking the plea that part of charge area of the Subject GA falls\nunder the GA authorized to the 2nd Respondent. (12) if the contention of the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 18 of 184\n\n 2nd Respondent that a mistake was committed by the vendor during the\nministerial exercise of drawing a map of GA, if accepted and applied across\nthe Board, would result in the following: (a) the villages and charge areas\nspecified in the map issued for GA 9.61, would be part of GA 9.62, (b) the\ntotal area of GA 9.61 would stand reduced to 4296.22 sq. km. from the total\narea of 4483 sq. km. specified in the map issued by the Board for the Subject\nGA, (c) the total area of GA 9.62 would stand enhanced to 3738.67 sq. km.\nfrom the total area of 3562 sq. km. stated in the map issued by the Board for\nChennai & Trivullar District, (d) there will be significant overlap in different\nGAs which form part of different CGD Bidding Rounds and, further, all the\nGA boundaries would have to be redefined which would lead to chaos in the\nCGD Sector, and (e ) all the information provided in the map such as vectors,\ntotal area, population, number of households, industrial areas, charge areas\netc. would become irrelevant; and (13) there was no delay in filing the\nComplaint as discussions with the 2nd Respondent completely failed only on\n22.02.2022 when they stated that the authorization should be treated in\nterms of the geo-coordinates boundaries.\n\n25. The impugned Order then records the contentions of the 2nd\nRespondent as under: (1) they are merely operating within the coordinates\nprovided in the map supplied and webhosted by the Board. The appellant\ndoes not dispute the same. It claims, without justification, that the basis of\nthe Board's determination of a GA is not the co-ordinates, but the legends\nand vectors given in the map and the figures stated in the 2011 Census. (2)\na map can be prepared to scale, with accurate depiction of landmarks, etc,\nonly with the proper use of coordinates. Unlike a geo- coordinate map which\nis the \"primary basis\" of determination, the nomenclature and legends\nremain subordinate to the map depicting the latitude and longitude and\ncannot substitute the primary basis which fixes the contours of the\nauthorized Geographical Area. Mention of the name of the district, taluks,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 19 of 184\n\n villages, etc. therein works only as a reference, and not as the grounds of\nthe geographical limits. (3) They had sought the original (digital) maps used\nfor the geo-coordinates map from the Board. These maps were provided by\nBoard on 01.09.2020 (in the form of '.shp' file) and they were exactly as per\nthe co-ordinates webhosted for the bid and later forming part of the\nauthorization. This establishes that the 2 n d Respondent is operating within\nthe co-ordinates given in the map for the authorized GA. (4) the tender\ndocument does not refer to the said Public Notice, and the nomenclature of\nthe GA is merely indicative and does not necessarily mean the whole district.\n\n(5) There is no overlap in GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62, and the appellant is\ndeliberately causing confusion between the boundary of a GA and that of the\ndistrict. (6) the provisions of the Act, and the Regulations made thereunder,\nshow that a specified geographical area could be a combination of\nadministrative demarcation in entirety or a part thereof. Neither the PNGRB\nAct nor the Regulations restrict the specified geographical area to the\nadministrative boundary, and the same is also not even remotely linked to\nany census data. (7) if the intention of the Board was to apply this district\nconcept to the 9th Bidding Round, it would have appropriately incorporated\nthe same in the Regulations, which were amended a couple of months\nbefore the date of conclusion of bid submission (i.e. 10.07.2018). Even\nduring the bidding process, no such indication/ clarification was given by the\nBoard. (8) the GA boundary and the district boundary are two entirely\ndifferent concepts, and both serve completely different purposes. The GA\nboundary is the area/region depicted by the map with geo-coordinates as\nprovided by the Board and for which the bid had been invited by the Board\nfor the development of the CGD network. The concept of a district boundary\nis only for administration purposes. The district boundary does not have any\nsanctity under the statutory framework i.e. the \nPNGRB Act\n and the\nRegulations made thereunder. (9) the charge areas are merely a subset of\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 20 of 184\n\n the GA, and cannot be forcibly introduced as a new basis for defining the\nspecified geographical area, which does not exist in the \nPNGRB Act\n or in the\nRegulations framed thereunder. (10) The appellant's contention that the area\nawarded to the 2nd Respondent cannot be more than 3,569 sq. km is not\ntenable. The authorization for GA 9.62 states that the proposed CGD\nnetwork shall cover an area of 3,569 sq. km \"and as depicted in the\nenclosed drawing or map\". It is, therefore, possible that the GA area number\nmay be more or less than the number given, and it is the GA map which is\nsacrosanct. (11) Until the 10th CGD Bidding Round, all the GAs authorized\nby the Board were always accompanied by the map with geo-coordinates\nforming part of the authorization letter. The concept of referring to the maps\nof Survey of India has been introduced only from the 11th CGD Bidding\nRound. (12) The Public Notice dated 18.01.2018, for the supply of\ncustomized and inter-active maps, nowhere mentions that the vendor should\nplace reliance on the Survey of India maps or on the district boundary as per\nthe 2011 Census. As per the scope of work given in the said tender, the\ngeographical data used by the vendor to prepare the maps could not have\nbeen more than 2 years old. In these circumstances, the question of placing\nreliance on the 2011 Census (for a tender issued in 2018) does not even\narise. (13) The appellant was negligent and failed to undertake its own\nsurvey/ due diligence of the area. Its conduct and submissions are\ninconsistent with its own case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the\nAppellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). (14) the Complaint is time-barred.\nThe appellant had been authorized by the Board on 07.09.2018. It came to\nthe knowledge of the appellant in June 2021 that 2nd Respondent was\nclaiming certain outlets falling within GA authorized to the 2nd Respondent.\nThe appellant had approached the Board on 11.04.2022, almost after a lapse\nof a year since then.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 21 of 184\n\n 26. On the basis of pleadings and arguments, the PNGRB framed the\nfollowing issues for determination: (i) Issue No. 1: Whether the Complaint\nwas time barred as per the provision of \nSection 25\n of the PNGRB Act?; (ii)\nIssue No. 2: Whether the boundaries of the Geographical Area authorized\nto the parties would be depicted on the basis of district boundaries as per\n2011 census?; (iii) Issue No. 3: Whether the Subject CNG Stations were\nfalling under the Geographical Area of the Complainant (ie the appellant)?;\nand (iv): Relief.\n\n27. The Board then observed that, since its inception, it had conducted 11\nCGD Bidding Rounds wherein 297 GAs had been authorized, which covered\n97% of the population and 88% of the area of the country.\n\n28. On Issue No. 1, the Board, after extracting \nSection 25\n of the PNGRB Act,\nobserved that, as per \nsection 25\n of the Act, the complaint had to be filed within\n60 days from the date on which any act or conduct constituting a\ncontravention took place; in view of the facts of the instant case, the Board\nobserved that, various communications were exchanged between the\nappellant and the 2nd Respondent which lasted up to 22.02.2022 when the\n2nd Respondent declined to stop the activities carried out in Kanchipuram\nDistrict; the appellant had also contended that it came to know of the\nactivities of the 2nd Respondent in Kanchipuram District in July 2021, since\nthen communications were exchanged, and the opening and operating of\nthe Subject CNG Stations would tantamount to arising of a continuing cause\nof action; and there was breach and violation in the authorized area of the\nappellant, which continued till date.\n\n29. The Board expressed its inclination to agree with the submission of\nthe appellant for the reason that the averments contained in the complaint\nstated that continuous contravention was taking place in the area authorized\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 22 of 184\n\n to the Complainant; and, thus, this issue was decided in favour of the\nappellant and against the 2nd Respondent.\n\n30. On Issue No. 2, the Board observed that, after forming a prima-facie\nview, it had issued public notices with respect to the process of\nbidding/authorizing the Geographical Areas, and the same nowhere affirmed\nthat it would be a final decision of the Board; pursuant to issuance of the\npublic notice, the Board invites comments/suggestion, if required, from the\npublic at large; and thereafter, the Board takes into consideration the\ncomments/suggestions and formulates its final decision.\n\n31. The Board expressed its disinclination to accept the submission of the\nappellant that the public notice dated 01.03.2018 mentioned that the basis\nof identification of GA was Administrative District; the intention of the Board\nwas never to authorize One Whole District as a Geographical Area; the\nBoard, on various occasions, had authorized Full/Part/Multiple District(s) as\na Geographical Area to numerous entities, in the 9th CGD Bidding Round; as\nper the contents of the ACBD, it was the obligation of the bidder that he must\nbe completely aware of the whereabouts of the proposed geographical area\nand charge areas, for which the bid was being submitted; in the present\ncase, both the appellant as well the 2nd Respondent had bid for the Subject\nGA wherein the appellant became the successful bidder; at the time of\nsubmission of bids for the Subject GAs, none of the parties had either\nbrought this to the notice of the Board nor raised any objection regarding\nthe issue relating to the boundaries of the GA of Kanchipuram District\nand Chennai & Trivullar Districts.\n\n32. With respect to the contention of the appellant that the GA comprised\nof identified talukas, villages, population, households, and landmarks which\nwere based on the district boundaries of Kanchipuram District as of Census\n2011, and was the basis of the bid of the GA authorized under the 9th CGD\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 23 of 184\n\n Bidding Round, the Board noted that the 2nd Respondent had claimed that\nthey were working within the boundaries as per the co-ordinates provided in\nthe map of authorization by the Board, and the geographical co-ordinates\nprovided with the map demarcated the area represented in the map and\ntherefore the locations that fell within the co-ordinates would form part of the\nrelevant geographical area.\n\n33. The Board then observed that, for determining the issue at hand, it\nwas essential to look into \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the CGD Authorization\nRegulations which defined \"authorized area\"; it was evident from the\naforesaid definition that the specified geographical area for a CGD Network\nwould be comprised entirely or partially of a district or sub-division or block\nor village or their combination and, further, an authorized area can also\ninclude any other contiguous area; it may be possible that different areas of\nthe same district may be part of two or more separate authorized Gas;\nsimilarly, a specified GA could be a culmination of two areas falling in\ndifferent districts; there was no requirement, either in the Regulations or\notherwise, that the entire district should necessarily fall only in one specified\narea; there were various such GAs awarded by the Board in different times\nwherein such combinations could be seen; and, in ACBD, the Board clearly\nmentioned that the maps depicted the Geographical Areas and Charge Area.\n\n34. The Board then extracted \nRegulation 10(1)\n read with Schedule D of\nthe CGD Authorization Regulations which related to the \"Grant of\nAuthorization\", and observed that the appellant as well as the 2nd Respondent\nhad accepted the terms and conditions of authorization of their respective\nGas; and the terms and conditions of the authorization letter were sacrosanct\nin nature and could not be deviated.\n\n35. The Board then referred to the map issued with Schedule-D which\ncontained the following table:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 24 of 184\n\n Kanchipuram District Chennai and Trivullar\n District\n Charge NAME Charge NAME\n Area ID Area ID\n CA-01 Alandur CA-01 Chennai\n CA-02 Chengalpattu CA-02 Ambattur\n CA-03 Cheyyur CA-03 Gummidipoondi\n CA-04 Kancheepuram CA-04 Maduravoyal\n CA-05 Maduranthakam CA-05 Mathavaram\n CA-06 Sholinganallur CA-06 Pallipattu\n CA-07 Sripwerumbudur CA-07 Ponneri\n CA-08 Tambaram CA-08 Poonamallee\n CA-09 Tirukalkundram CA-09 Thiruvallur\n CA-10 Tiruporur CA-10 Tiruttani\n CA-11 Uthiramerur CA-11 Uthukkotai\n\n Kanchipuram District Chennai and Trivullar\n District\n Total Population 39,98,252 Total Population 83,74,836\n Total Household 10,060,245 Total Household 21,01,931\n\n No. of charge 11 No. of charge 11\n\n area area\n\n36. It then observed that it was a matter of record that reference to the 2011\nCensus was made in the Bidding Document, for the limited purpose i.e. for\nBid Bond and Application Fee, as it required the Successful Bidder to submit\nthe Performance Bond as per the population in the 2011 Census of India.\n\n37. The Board then referred to the ACBD issued at the time of 9th CGD\nBidding Round, and to certain clauses therein. It noted that Clause 1.1.3\nthereof stipulated that it was the bidder's responsibility to obtain all\ninformation related to the present gas supply availability and pipeline\nconnectivity and also existing customers, if any, in the specified geographical\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 25 of 184\n\n area; Clause 2.1.1 thereof stipulated that the bidder was expected to\nexamine all the contents of the 'Application-cum-Bid document', including all\ninstructions, forms, terms and conditions and all the regulations of PNGRB.\nThe 'Application-cum-Bid document' together with all its annexures thereto\nshall be considered to be read, understood and accepted by the bidder.\nFailure to furnish any information required as per the 'Application-cum-Bid\ndocument' or submission of Application-cum-Bid not complete in every\nrespect will be at bidder's risk and may result in the rejection of the\nApplication-cum-Bid; Clause 2.1.2 stipulated that the bidder shall carefully\nstudy the geographical area and charge areas before submitting their\nApplication-cum-Bid; and Annexure 1(Map) stipulated that the bidder shall\ncarefully study the geographical area and charge areas before submitting\ntheir Application-cum-Bid.\n\n38. From the aforesaid mentioned provisions, the Board made the\nfollowing observations: (i) the appellant and the 2nd Respondent had\nparticipated in the bidding process of the 9th CGD Bidding Round, wherein\nthe ACBD issued by the Board clearly stated that it was the responsibility of\nthe bidder to carefully study the GA and the charge areas before submitting\nthe bid; despite numerous opportunities granted by the Board to submit\nobjections, the appellant did not submit any objection with respect to the\nsame; (ii) the Board gave a tender to the vendor to prepare the map, wherein\nthe vendor was given the scope of work which included that (1) the\ngeographical data used by the vendor to prepare the maps should not be\nmore than 2 years old, complete geo-referencing had to be provided in the\nsupplied maps with standard cartographic symbology and colours; (2) All\nNH/SH & major roads and area segments such as residential, commercial,\nindustrial, forest land / green area in urban /rural areas were to be indicated\nin the maps with their names. The vendor was required to collect details of\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 26 of 184\n\n all administrative divisions such as Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal etc, (3)\nsubmissions shall also be in the form of geo referenced .shp files projected\nin WGS formats besides JPG and PDF formats along with 5 prints each of\nA1 size. (iii) the primary obligation of the vendor was to provide a map of the\ngeographical area and, thereafter, provide population for the area so\ndepicted and not vice versa. Reference to the 2011 Census population\nnumbers find place only once, that too only in the context that the population\ndata of the area was to be provided and authenticated with the source\ndetails; (iv) the tender document given to the vendor did not state that the\nBoard shall provide a map (let alone the Census 2011 map) to the vendor for\nundertaking the exercise of preparing a customized map; and, in these\ncircumstances, the appellant's claim that the Board provided a map (either\nthe Census 2011 map of Kanchipuram revenue district or otherwise) to the\nvendor for preparation of the GA map was entirely speculative and false.\n\n39. The Board further observed that the appellant had attempted to\nconfuse two entirely different concepts, ie the GA boundary and the district\nboundary, even though both serve completely different purposes. (I) the\ndemarcation of the boundary of a district is at the discretion of the Central/\nState Government, and may undergo change with time for better\nadministration as and when the change is notified; in the case of GA of\nKanchipuram Districts also, the district of Kanchipuram has been split\nbetween Kanchipuram district and Chengalpattu district post the award of\nthe GA to the appellant. On the contrary, the boundary of the GA remained\nthe same even if there was a split or merger of district(s) after the GA was\nawarded to a CGD entity. In other words, the GA boundary is sacrosanct and\ncannot be altered post the bid. This also becomes clear when both the\nwebhosted maps attached with the bidding document for GA No. 9.61\n(Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts) and GA No. 9.62 (Kanchipuram Districts)\nare juxtaposed with each other. Not only the bifurcated GA boundaries of the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 27 of 184\n\n respective maps seamlessly coalesce (without any overlap whatsoever) but\nalso reflect and match with the position of major landmarks in the area. (ii)\nReliance has been placed by the appellant, upon the communication\nreceived from the Board on 23.09.2021, to claim that the maps of Survey of\nIndia/ local authorities were relevant for ascertaining the GA boundary. On\nobserving the letter dated 23.09.2021, it is found that the appellant is\ndeliberately twisting the communication from the Board out of context. (iii)\nthe Board's letter dated 23.09.2021 to the Appellant, in response to their\nrequest to provide \"digital map, clearly showing the administrative\nboundaries of the Kanchipuram District GA (ID9.61) for detailed planning and\ndevelopment of infrastructure\"; it was only in this context that the Board\nreplied that the district boundaries within the GA are considered to be as\ndefined by the Survey of India/ Office of the Registrar General and Census\nCommissioner; the Board also clarified that, in case any confirmation was\nrequired in relation to a district's boundary, the same shall be dealt directly\nwith the district administration or municipal corporation; thus, the Survey of\nIndia/ Government maps were only meant for administrative purposes,\nincluding to plan and make applications to local authorities, etc. (iv) until the\n10th CGD Bidding Round, the GAs authorized by the Board had always been\naccompanied by the map with geo-coordinates forming part of the\nauthorization letter. The concept of referring to the maps of Survey of India\nhas been introduced only from the 11th CGD Bidding Round. In the 11th CGD\nBidding Round, the bid document did not include the map of the GA which\nwas proposed to be awarded. Instead, the Board asked the bidders to\nprocure the maps for identification of district and charge area boundaries\nfrom the Survey of India. The tender document for the 11th CGD Bidding\nRound states: \"The district boundary within this GA shall be as defined by\nthe respective local authority, such as district administration. Bidders may\nprocure the maps for identification of District and Charge Area boundaries\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 28 of 184\n\n from Survey of India. However, the boundary should be duly vetted by district\nadministration for correctness on ground. Bidders are informed that any\ndispute arising in relation to boundary shall be dealt directly with the District\nAdministration or Municipal Corporation. PNGRB shall have no role in\ndefining the boundary, except the nomenclature of that particular district and\ncharge areas falling in the GA.\"; it is clear that the Survey of India maps/ maps\nissued by local authorities have no relevance in the present case i.e. for bids\nawarded as part of the 9th CGD Bidding Round.\n\n40. After referring to Clauses 2.2 to 2.2.2 of the Bid Document for the 9th\nCGD Bidding round, which relates to clarifications of Application-cum-Bid\ndocument, the Board observed that it was clear from the said clauses that\nan opportunity was provided to all the bidders to clear their doubts, if any with\nrespect to the tender document which inter- alia included the map as well; a\nvisual inspection of the map for the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts\nmade it clear that the GA boundary of Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts\nextended beyond the district boundary of Chennai and Tiruvallur; if one\nreferred to the GA map of Kanchipuram District as well, it would be clear that\nGA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62 represent mutually exclusive areas and there is no\noverlap whatsoever between the two; the appellant did not show any\nprudence or proactiveness in seeking clarification from the Board regarding\nthe map, if it so required; (ii) in its judgment dated 17.02.2020, the Supreme\nCourt also recognized that the bidders were required to obtain information\non their own and were also required to carefully study the GA and the charge\narea before submitting the bid; (iii) It is an undisputed fact that, vide Tamil\nNadu Government Gazette numbered as No. II/(1)/RDM/(B)/2018 dated\n04.01.2018, some villages which formed part of Kanchipuram District was\nshifted to Chennai District, before the launch of 9th CGD Bidding Round; if\nthe said fact was brought to the knowledge of the Board, at the time of 9th\nCGD Bidding Round, then the GA authorized to the 2nd Respondent would\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 29 of 184\n\n have also included the said shifted villages; however, at this stage, keeping\nin mind the well settled law i.e. the Rule of Estoppel by Conduct which meant\nthat when a person through agreement, misrepresentation or negligence\nmakes the other person believe in certain things upon which the other person\nhad taken some action causing a change in their current situation, then the\nfirst person cannot deny the veracity of the statements given by him in the\nlatter stages, the Board was not in a position to take cognizance of the\nOfficial Gazette dated 04.01.2018. (iv) in view of the above, the Board was\nof view that the 2nd Respondent was strictly operating within the co-ordinates\nprovided by the PNGRB through a GIS map as part of their authorization\nletter. The 2nd Respondent had accepted the map for GA 9.61 during the\nbidding round, and also as a part of their authorization letter; the appellant\nhad neither raised any query during the bidding process nor raised any\nobjections on the GIS map given to them as a part of their authorization\nletter; the appellant had also not disputed the sanctity of the co-ordinates\ngiven in the maps; the GIS map for GA No. 9.62 clearly demarcated the GA\nboundary with pink line and the district boundaries with black line; it was\nalso clear that there was no overlap in maps for GA No. 9.61 and 9.62; it was\nalso clear that the concept of survey of India Map was introduced by the\nBoard from the 11th CGD bidding round, and the same cannot be applicable\nto the GAs awarded during the 9th CGD Bidding Round; and, thus, this issue\nwas decided against the appellant.\n\n41. On Issue No. 3, the Board observed that, in view of the afore-said\ndeliberations, they were holding that the subject disputed area did not fall\nunder the authorized area of the 2nd Respondent; hence, the CNG Station\nNo. 1 to 5 were not under the GA of the appellant; and, therefore, this issue\nwas decided against the appellant.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 30 of 184\n\n 42. The Board summarized its conclusions holding that the concept of\nSurvey of India Map was introduced by the Board from the 11th CGD bidding\nround, and the same could not be made applicable to the GAs awarded\nduring the 9th CGD Bidding Round; the 2nd Respondent was strictly operating\nwithin the coordinates provided by the PNGRB through a GIS map as part of\ntheir authorization letter.\n\n43. In view of these facts, the submission made by the parties, and the\nobservations made, the Board held that the instant Complaint merited\ndismissal being devoid of merits. The interim order also stood vacated.\n\n IV. RIVAL CONTENTIONS:\n\n44. Elaborate submissions, both oral and written, were put forth by Sri.\nParas Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant,\nSri Rahul Sagar Sahai, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nRespondent-PNGRB, and Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the 2nd Respondent. It is convenient to examine these\nrival contentions under different heads.\n\n V. BELATED FILING OF COMPLAINT:\n\n45. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n2nd Respondent, would submit that, after almost 4 years from the date of its\nauthorization i.e. 26.09.2018, the appellant filed a complaint against the 2nd\nRespondent before the PNGRB in April 2022, inter alia, alleging that the 2nd\nRespondent was undertaking development of 19 Compressed Natural Gas\n(\"CNG\") stations within the areas specified to be a part of GA No. 9.61; as\nthe complainant, the onus was on the appellant to show that the disputed\nCNG stations are located in GA No. 9.61; however, the appellant has not\nproved or shown even once the exact location of the CNG stations till date\neither on the GA map or in the .shp file provided by the PNGRB; instead,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 31 of 184\n\n the appellant is causing confusion by introducing irrelevant considerations\nand attempting to re-open the bid process; an attempt has been made to\nturn a commercial dispute about the location of CNG stations into a litigation\nabout the process of determination of a GA; in any case, the 2nd\nRespondent has unequivocally demonstrated, using the GA map as well\nas the .shp files given by the PNGRB, the exact location of the CNG\nstations, and that all the disputed 19 CNG stations fall squarely in the GA\nawarded to them; PNGRB dismissed the complaint filed by the appellant,\nvide its order dated 22.12.2022, holding that the \"subject disputed area\ndoes not fall under the authorized area of the Respondent (ie the\nappellant)\"; the PNGRB held that the 2nd Respondent was \"strictly operating\nwithin the coordinates provided by the PNGRB through a GIS map as a\npart of their authorization letter\"; PNGRB further noted that the appellant\nhad accepted the map for GA No. 9.61 during bidding, and also as a\npart of their authorization letter, and no query or objection with respect to\nthe map was raised at any point; and, further, the sanctity of the co-\nordinates given in the map were also not disputed by the appellant.\n\n46. This issue, regarding belated filing of the complaint, was considered\nby the PNGRB in the impugned Order dated 22.12.2022, and it was\nobserved that bids were invited on 12.04.2018 for the 9th CGD Bidding\nRound for various Geographical areas, including the Geographical Areas of\nChennai- Tiruvallur, and Kanchipuram Districts; the 2nd Respondent was\ngranted authorization by the PNGRB, vide letter dated 07.09.2018, for\ndevelopment of CGD Network in the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistricts, the terms and conditions of which were accepted by the 2nd\nRespondent on 11.09.2018, and the said authorization was amended in\nfavour of the 2nd Respondent vide letter dated 01.09.2020; the appellant\nwas granted authorization vide letter dated 26.09.2018 for Kanchipuram GA,\nand the said authorization was amended in favour of the Complainant vide\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 32 of 184\n\n letter dated 01.09.2020; a complaint was filed by the Appellant on 11.04.2022\nagainst the 2nd Respondent; a press release was issued by the Board on\n14.09.2018, identifying successful bidders for the 86 authorized GAs; and\nthis was subjected to challenge before this Tribunal in \n'Adani Gas Limited vs\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board & Anr.' (Appeal No.\n \n292 of\n2018), and 'IMC Limited vs Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board &\nAnr.' (Appeal No.\n 323 of 2018).\n\n47. On Issue No. 1, ie whether the complaint was time barred as per the\nprovision of \nSection 25\n of the PNGRB Act, the Board observed that, as per\n\nSection 25\n of the Act, the complaint had to be filed within 60 days from the\ndate on which any act or conduct constituting a contravention took place;\nvarious communications were exchanged between the appellant and the 2nd\nRespondent which lasted up to 22.02.2022 when the 2nd Respondent\ndeclined to stop the activities carried out in Kanchipuram District; the\nappellant had also contended that it came to know of the activities of the 2nd\nRespondent in Kanchipuram District in July 2021; since then\ncommunications were exchanged; the opening and operating of the Subject\nCNG Stations would tantamount to arising of a continuing cause of action,\nand there was breach and violation in the authorized area of the appellant,\nwhich continued till date.\n\n48. The Board expressed its inclination to agree with the submission of the\nappellant for the reason that the averments contained in the complaint stated\nthat continuous contravention was taking place in the area authorized to the\nComplainant; and, thus, this issue was decided in favour of the appellant and\nagainst the 2nd Respondent.\n\n A. ANALYSIS:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 33 of 184\n\n 49. \nSection 25\n of the PNGRB Act, 2006 relates to the filing of complaints.\n\nSection 25(1)\n enables a complaint to be filed before the Board by any person\nin respect of matters relating to entities on any matter arising out of the\nprovisions of the \nPNGRB Act\n. \nSection 25(2)\n requires every complaint, made\nunder sub-section (1), to be filed within sixty days from the date on which\nany act or conduct constituting a contravention took place and shall be in\nsuch form and shall be accompanied by such fee as may be provided by\nRegulations. The proviso to \nSection 25(2)\n enables the Board to entertain a\ncomplaint after expiry of the said period if it is satisfied that there was\nsufficient cause for not filing the complaint within that period.\n\n50. As noted hereinabove, the Board has held this issue in favour of the\nAppellant and against the 2nd Respondent, and the present Appeal has been\nfiled not by the 2nd Respondent, but by the Appellant herein. While the 2nd\nRespondent may well be entitled to sustain the order of the PNGRB on\ngrounds which were held against it by the Board, in view of the \nOrder 41\nRule 22 CPC\n, it must also be borne in mind that it is only if this Tribunal were\nto be satisfied, that the reasons which weighed with the PNGRB in rejecting\nthis contention of the 2nd Respondent is ex facie illegal, would interference\nbe justified.\n\n51. More than one year four months after the Appellant accepted the terms\nand condition of authorization vide its letter dated 20.02.2020, Hindustan\nPetroleum Corporation Limited informed the Appellant on 17.06.2021 that\ndiscussions were in progress with the 2nd Respondent for installation of\ncompressed natural gas stations in Chennai. In response thereto, the\nAppellant informed HPCL that some of these petrol stations fell under their\nGA. In response, HPCL informed them by e-mail dated 21-06-2021 that the\n2nd Respondent was contending that some of these petrol stations fell in their\nGA. Thereafter, correspondent ensued between the Appellant and the 2nd\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 34 of 184\n\n Respondent on 07-07-2021 and 08-07-2021. The Appellant requested the\nBoard, vide its letter dated 17.08.2021, to provide GIS based Geographical\nArea map which was based on the Survey of India Map and informed them\nof the agencies which had been finalised to provide the map, so that the\nAppellant would procure the same from such agencies with due permission\nof the Board, and that they be provided with the digital map of the subject\nGA. The Board thereafter, vide its letter dated 23.09.2021, informed the\nappellant that the GIS map, indicating the respective GA area and\nboundaries, had already been provided along with the authorisation letter.\nThe Appellant then approached the District Collector, Kanchipuram, vide its\nletter dated 24.09.2021, seeking a copy of the District Map of Kanchipuram\ndistrict in accordance with the Census of India, 2011. On receipt thereof, the\nAppellant, vide letter dated 19.10.2021, informed the Oil Marketing\nCompanies of the details of the boundaries of their GA contending that the\nCNG stations set up by the 2nd Respondent in the subject GA were in\nviolation of the \nPNGRB Act\n and the authorization vested with the Appellant.\n\n52. On 19.01.2022, the Appellant informed the Board of the error which\nhad occurred in the area mentioned in the authorisation letter dated\n26.10.2018, mentioning the total authorised area of GA 9.61 as 6936.50\nsquare kilometres instead of 4483 square kilometres, and that it needed\ncorrection. The Board, vide the letter dated 31.01.2022, carried out the\nnecessary corrections.\n\n53. Vide letter dated 31.01.2022, the Appellant informed the 2nd\nRespondent that they were attempting to set up CNG dispensing facilities in\nthe subject GA. They were requested to stop construction activities\nundertaken by them at various CNG stations. In response thereto, the 2nd\nRespondent, vide letter dated 22.02.2022, informed the Appellant that the\nChennai GA was spread over certain parts of Kanchipuram as per the map\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 35 of 184\n\n web-hosted by the Board during the bidding process, and the activities\ncarried out by the 2nd Respondent were in compliance with the geo-\ncoordinate boundary of Chennai GA. Thereafter, the Appellant filed a\ncomplaint before the Board on 11.04.2022.\n\n54. It is clear therefore that the delay on the part of the Appellant, in\napproaching the Board under \nSection 25\n of the PNGRB Act by way of its\ncomplaint, was neither wilful nor deliberate. The facts narrated hereinabove\ndo show that the Appellant initially endeavoured to have the issue amicably\nresolved with the 2nd Respondent, and it is only when it failed to do so did it\napproach the Board by filing the complaint. Further, In the impugned order,\nthe Board has noted that various communications were exchanged between\nthe Appellant and the 2nd Respondent up to 22.02.2022 when the 2nd\nRespondent declined to stop the activities being carried out by them in\nKanchipuram District. The Appellant has also contended that it became\naware of the activities of the 2nd Respondent in Kanchipuram District only in\nJuly 2021, since then communications were exchanged, and the 2nd\nRespondent continuing operating the subject CNG Stations would\ntantamount to the arising of a continuing cause of action as there was a\ncontinuing breach and violation in their authorized area. It is in such\ncircumstances that the Board decided this issue in favour of the Appellant\nholding that the averments in the complaint alleged continuous\ncontravention was taking place in the area authorized to the Appellant.\n\n55. While the proviso to \nSection 25(2)\n no doubt enables the PNGRB to\nentertain a complaint after expiry of the period of 60 days, if it is satisfied that\nthere was sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within the said period,\nwe are satisfied that, in the light of the above-referred facts and the\nconclusion of the PNGRB that the cause of action was continuing, the\nAppellant cannot be said to have filed the complaint belatedly.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 36 of 184\n\n \n56. In this context it is necessary to understand what constitutes a\ncontinuing cause of action. A continuing cause of action is a cause of action\nwhich arises from the repetition of acts or omissions of the same kind as that\nfor which the action was brought. If once a cause of action arises, and the\nacts complained of are continuously repeated, the cause of action continues\nand goes on de die in diem. If there is a connection between the series of\nacts before and after the action was brought, and they are repeated in\nsuccession, they become a continuing cause of action. They are an\nassertion of the same claim, and a continuance of the same alleged right.\n(Hole v. Chard Union [(1894) 1 Ch D 293 : 63 LJ Ch 469 : 70 LT 52;\n\nCommissioner of Wealth Tax, Amritsar v. Suresh Seth\n, (1981) 2 SCC\n\n790).\n\n57. It is the very essence of a continuing wrong that it is an act which\ncreates a continuing source of injury and renders the doer of the act\nresponsible and liable for the continuance of the said injury. If a wrongful act\nis of such a character that the injury caused by it itself continues, then the\nact constitutes a continuing wrong. (\nBalkrishna Savalram Pujari v. Shree\nDnyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan\n: AIR 1959 SC 798; \nCommissioner of\nWealth Tax, Amritsar v. Suresh Seth\n, (1981) 2 SCC 790).\n\n58. The true principle appears to be that where the wrong complained of\nis the omission to perform a positive duty requiring a person to do a certain\nact, the test to determine whether such a wrong is a continuing one is\nwhether the duty in question is one which requires him to continue to do that\nact. Breach of a covenant to keep the premises in good repair, breach of a\ncontinuing guarantee, obstruction to a right of way, obstruction to the right of\na person to the unobstructed flow of water, refusal by a man to maintain his\nwife and children whom he is bound to maintain under law and the carrying\non of mining operations or the running of a factory without complying with\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 37 of 184\n\n the measures intended for the safety and well-being of workmen may be\nillustrations of continuing breaches or wrongs giving rise to a civil liability de\ndie in diem. (\nCommissioner of Wealth Tax, Amritsar v. Suresh Seth\n,\n(1981) 2 SCC 790).\n\n59. In case, the Appellant's contention that the subject CNG stations fall\nwithin their authorised GA is held to merit acceptance, then the continuing\noperation of the CNG Stations by the 2nd Respondent in the appellant's GA\nwould be a continuing violation of the appellant's authorisation resulting in a\ncontinuing cause of action. In which case, the complaint cannot be said to\nhave been filed belatedly, since \nSection 25(2)\n requires every complaint,\nmade under sub-section (1), to be filed within sixty days from the date on\nwhich any act or conduct constituting a contravention took place. As the act\nor conduct of the 2nd Respondent, which resulted in a contravention taking\nplace, continues even as on date, the sixty' day limitation period cannot be\nsaid to have expired till date. We are satisfied, therefore, that this contention\nurged on behalf of the 2nd Respondent necessitates rejection.\n\n VI. EARLIER LITIGATION BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT:\n\n60. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that an appeal (Appeal No. 292 of 2018) was filed\nbefore this Tribunal by Adani Gas Limited challenging, inter alia, the decision\nof the PNGRB to award GA No. 9.61 and GA No. 9.62 to the appellant and\nthe 2nd Respondent respectively; the primary question in this appeal was\nwhether a bidder could have quoted a bid to connect domestic piped-natural\ngas connections less than 2% or more than 100% of the total households\nexisting as per the Census of 2011, even though this criteria was not\nmentioned in the Bid Documents; for this purpose, it was imperative to\ndecide the relevance of the Census of 2011 data in the bidding process\nconducted by PNGRB; on 28.02.2019, this Tribunal pronounced its judgment\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 38 of 184\n\n in the appeal; in the appeal preferred thereagainst in \nAdani Gas Limited v.\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board & Ors. [Civil Appeal No.\n\n3992 of 2019; (2020) 4 SCC 529, the Supreme Court upheld the award of\nGA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62; the findings of the Supreme Court are summarized\nas (a) the Census 2011 figures were only utilized to peg the net-worth\nrequirement and value of the performance bond to be submitted by a bidder;\nand where a specific linkage was sought, with reference to the 2011 Census\ndata, a clear and categorical provision was made to that effect; the Supreme\nCourt then analysed why \nRegulation 7\n of the 2008 Regulations did not\nprovide for a link with the Census of 2011; (b) On the Bid Document, the\nSupreme Court considered the provisions of the Bid Document in detail and\nheld that merely because the map given with the Bid Document contained a\nreference to population and household figures on the basis of the Census of\n2011 did not mean that the Census of 2011 was the basis of submission for\nbids; thereafter, the Supreme Court also reiterated the principle that a bidder\ncould not have been disqualified on the basis of a criterion which was not\nnotified, and of which the bidders had no knowledge, as that would be\narbitrary and in violation of \nArticle 14;\n the key takeaways from the judgment\nof the Supreme Court can, thus, be summarized as follows: (a) the Census\nof 2011 has no relevance, except to peg the performance bond and net-\nworth, with respect to the 9th Bidding Round; (b) under the Bid Document,\nthe bidders were required to obtain information about the present gas supply\navailability, the pipeline connectivity and the existing customers in the GA;\nbidders were also required to examine the contents of the Bid Document\nincluding instructions, terms and conditions and regulations of the Board; the\ndata given in the map (population, household etc.) was, at best, a\ncompendium of the latest official record of the GA, and (c) a criterion which\nwas not notified to the bidders at the time of bidding (i.e. not specified in the\nBid Document) cannot be applied as that would be a violation of \nArticle 14.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 39 of 184\n\n A. JUDGEMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT IN \nADANI GAS\n LTD. V. PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS REGULATORY\n BOARD\n, (2020) 4 SCC 529:\n\n61. \nIn \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, the Supreme Court noted that, in 2018, the Petroleum\nand Natural Gas Regulatory Board (\"the Board\") had conducted the ninth\nround of bidding for City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks (\"CGD\nNetworks\"); on 14-9-2018, a press release was placed on the Board's\nwebsite notifying details of the successful bidders in various geographical\nareas (GAs); and the contest in the batch of appeals before it had arisen\nover the grant of authorisation for laying, building, operating or expanding\nCGD networks, among others, in the following GAs: (i) GA 61 --\nKanchipuram District; and (ii) GA 62 -- Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts; two\nappeals were instituted thereagainst before APTEL, one by Adani Gas Ltd\nand the other by IMC Ltd. Adani Gas Ltd had preferred the appeal against\nthe decision of the Board to award LoIs, in respect of three GAs -- 51\n(Puducherry District), 61 (Kanchipuram District), and 62 (Chennai &\nTiruvallur Districts), on the ground that the successful bids were beyond the\nunreasonably high limit adopted by the Board. By their separate judgments,\nthe Chairperson and Member Technical (Petroleum and Natural Gas)\nrendered divergent findings, following which the Chairperson directed that\nthe proceedings in the two appeals be placed before the judicial member.\nThe judicial member recused from hearing the appeals on 7-3-2019. This\nled to the institution of appeals before the Supreme Court which, in the\nexercise of its powers under \nArticle 142\n of the Constitution, transferred the\nproceedings before Aptel to itself in order to bring finality to the dispute.\n\n62. After taking note of Regulations 5, 5(6), 6, 7 and 9 of the 2008\nRegulations, the Supreme Court observed that, under \nRegulation 7\n, the\nBoard, while considering proposals for authorisation, shall tabulate and\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 40 of 184\n\n compare all financial bids which meet the minimum eligibility criteria in\naccordance with the bidding criteria set out; the Table set out in \nRegulation\n7(1)(a)\n provided for the tabulation of all eligible financial bids on the basis of\nfive parameters and the weightage to be ascribed to each of them; the first\ncriterion is the \"lowness\" of the transportation rate for CGD computed in\nrupees per million for a British Thermal Unit, and the weightage ascribed to\nthis criterion is 10%; the second criterion is the \"lowness\" of the\ntransportation rate for CNG expressed in rupees per kilogram, and the\nweightage ascribed to this criterion is 10%; the third criterion is the\n\"highness\" of the number of CNG stations to be installed within eight contract\nyears from the date of authorization, and the weightage ascribed to this\nparameter is 20%; the fourth criterion is the \"highness\" of the number of\ndomestic piped natural gas connections to be achieved within eight contract\nyears from the date of authorization, and the weightage ascribed to this\ncriterion is 50%; the fifth criterion is the \"highness\" of the inch-kilometre of\nsteel pipeline to be laid within eight contract years from the date of\nauthorization, and the weightage ascribed to this parameter is 10%.\n\n63. The Supreme Court then observed that \nRegulation 7(1)(b)\n sets out a\nyear-wise work programme indicating the progress which must be achieved\nby the successful bidder every year during the course of eight contract years\nfrom the date of authorization; under \nRegulation 7(3)\n, a bidding entity with\nthe highest composite score, in terms of the criteria contained in sub-\nregulation (1), is to be declared as the successful bidder; the illustration\nthereto shows that the entity, which has quoted the highest number of PNG\ndomestic connections to be achieved, is allotted a score of 100%; the entities\nbelow the highest were to be assigned a score in relation to the first entity\non a proportionate basis; under \nRegulation 9\n, the grant of an authorisation\nis to be issued to a successful entity after it furnishes a performance bond,\nand the quantum of the performance bond is based on the population of the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 41 of 184\n\n GA as determined with reference to the Census data of 2011; from an\nanalysis of the CGD Authorisation Regulations, it becomes evident that the\n2011 Census figures have been utilised to peg the net worth requirement in\n\nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n and the value of the performance bond to be submitted\nto the Board post authorisation in \nRegulation 9\n; and, significantly, \nRegulation\n7\n, which provides a Table specifying the five bidding criteria to evaluate\ncompeting bids, does not link the said criteria with the census figures of\n2011.\n\n64. The Supreme Court noted that, on 12-4-2018, the Board had initiated\nthe bidding process for authorising entities to lay, build, operate or expand\nCGD networks for the ninth round, and bids were invited by means of an\napplication-cum-bid-document for each GA; the bidding process covered\nvarious GAs, including those of (i) GA 61 -- Kanchipuram District; and (ii)\nGA 62 -- Chennai-Tiruvallur; on 31-5-2018, Addendum 1 to the bid\ndocument was issued by the Board; Clause 14.2, inserted as a result of\nAddendum 1, clarified that, what should be considered to be the level of\n\"unreasonably high\" or \"unreasonably low\" quotes, shall be decided by\nBoard at the time of bid evaluation on a case-to-case basis after considering\nthe relevant factors' in terms of the said stipulation; the Board clarified that\nthe determination of an unreasonably high or low quote would be made by\nthe Board at the time of bid evaluation on a case-to-case basis after\nconsidering the relevant factors; on 23-7-2018, a note (\"Board Note\") was\nmoved for the approval of the members of the Board with a view to\nencourage serious bidders and to avoid unrealistic/unreasonable bidding in\nterms of Clause 4.4.1 of the bid document; the Board Note provided for the\nreasonability of bidding parameters; the Board Note was approved by the\nmembers of the Board including the Chairperson; and, between 24-7-2018\nand 18-8-2018, the financial bids submitted by the bidders for various GAs\nwere opened by the Board.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 42 of 184\n\n 65. The Supreme Court observed that the Board Note of 23-7-2018\nadopted the Census 2011 data, on the total number of households, as the\nbasis for computing the minimum and maximum limits for the purpose of\ndetermining unreasonably low or unreasonably high quotes; the Board Note\nstipulated that 2% of the total households in terms of the Census 2011 data\nwould be regarded as the minimum quote; anything below 2% would be\nconsidered unreasonably low; similarly, on the upper end of the spectrum,\nthe Board Note proposed that 100% of the total households in terms of the\nCensus 2011 data would be regarded as the maximum; a quotation beyond\nthis upper limit would be construed to be unreasonably high; and two\nfeatures of the Board Note dated 23-7-2018 must be noted - first, the Board\nNote was generated after the last date for the submission of bids, and\nsecond, the Board Note was an internal document of the Board which was\nnot notified to the bidders.\n\n66. The Supreme Court observed that the first aspect, which formed the\nsubject-matter of the controversy, was the relevance of the 2011 Census\ndata in the bidding process; the primary plank on which the appellants\ncontend that the 2011 Census data was relevant to the bidding process was\nthe reference to population/household figures derived from the 2011 Census\ndata in the map annexed to the bid document; it was contended that (i) the\nmap attached to the bid document did not only describe the land area but\nalso the population and households comprised in it, (ii) the rationale for this\nwas that the authorisation is to lay the CGD network in a defined land area\nand to service the defined households in that area, (iii) the figures for\npopulation and number of households in the map attached to the bid\ndocument were drawn from the 2011 Census, (iv) in several areas out of\nthe 86 GAs which were a part of the ninth round of bidding, certain parts of\nthe GAs were excluded from the zone of authorization, (v) whenever certain\nparts of the GAs were excluded from the zone of authorisation, the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 43 of 184\n\n population/household number was proportionally reduced to reflect the\npopulation/households as per the reduced area. Examples of the above are\nSurendranagar (GA 8); and Medchal-Ranga Reddy (GA 72); (vi) in GA 72,\nMedchal-Ranga Reddy: (a) the original map attached to the bid document\nshowed the entire district with a corresponding number of households of\n13,47,118 according to the 2011 Census, (b) the bid document was\namended to exclude the area in which an existing entity was already laying\na CGD network as a result of which not only was the land area reduced but\neven the number of households was reduced to 4,56,557, (c) Torrent Gas\nPvt. Ltd., which was the highest bidder for the reduced area, had bid\n10,05,300 PNG connections, which worked out to 74.6% of the original\nnumber of households (13,47,118) and 220% of the reduced number of\nhouseholds (4,56,557), (d) the Board, at its meeting on 29-8-2018, rejected\nthe H1 bidder for GA 72 on the ground that the bid of 220% of the households\nwas unreasonably high, (e ) the bid of the H1 bidder for GA 72 was in fact\n99% of the estimated households for 2026 but was yet rejected as the\n\"unreasonably high\" norm was with reference to the 2011 Census, and not\n100% of the 2026 estimate because, if it was the latter, the H1 bidder would\nhave been declared to be successful, (f) the map annexed to the bid\ndocument depicted not only the land area but also the population/number of\nhouseholds which were intrinsically inter-twined in the bid parameters, (g)\nclause 1.1.3 of the bid document mandated bidders to look at the \"existing\npopulation\", hence, it was incorrect to suggest that the bidders had to keep\nin mind the population in the GAs in 2018, and, on the contrary, Clause 1.1.1\nrequired bidders to bear in mind the population/households as given in the\nmap annexed to the bid document.\n\n67. The Supreme Court observed that the submission urged on behalf of\nthe appellants, in regard to the relevance of the 2011 Census data, must first\nand foremost be assessed in the context of the CGD Authorisation\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 44 of 184\n\n Regulations as amended on 6-4-2018; the Regulations postulated that\nbidders must submit both technical and financial bids; the procedure\nspecified in \nRegulation 5\n applied to an invitation by the Board for laying,\nbuilding, operating or expanding a CDG network; \nRegulation 5(6)\n required\nthe fulfilment of minimum eligibility criteria; for a technical bid to pass muster,\nthe minimum eligibility criteria required the bidder to be qualified both with\nreference to technical and financial parameters; this was evident from\n\nRegulation 5(6)\n under which the Board was to scrutinise the bids of only\nthose entities which fulfilled the minimum eligibility criteria; the minimum\neligibility criteria included the technical capability of the bidding entity to (i)\nlay and build; and (ii) operate and maintain a CGD network; both of them\nwere defined with reference to the qualifying criteria; besides the technical\ncriteria, the minimum eligibility requirement under \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n\nincorporated the financial ability to execute the project and to operate and\nmaintain it in the authorised area; the financial criteria were defined with\nreference to the minimum net worth of the bidding entity; the net worth\nrequired was dependent on the population of the GA under the 2011 Census;\nthe minimum net worth required was specifically defined with reference to\nthe 2011 Census figures of population for the GA; the bidding entity was also\nrequired to submit a bid bond in the form of a performance bond guarantee;\nand the quantum of the guarantee was dependent on the population of the\nGA.\n\n68. The Supreme Court further observed that \nRegulation 7\n required the\nBoard to tabulate all financial bids which met the minimum eligibility criteria,\nin accordance with the bidding criteria specified in the table; the table\nincorporated in the Regulation provided five-fold criteria for the tabulation\nand comparison of financial bids; significantly, the bidding criteria in\n\nRegulation 7\n are not linked to the 2011 Census figures; there were two\nsignificant facets of \nRegulation 7\n: (i) the absence of a linkage of the projected\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 45 of 184\n\n number of domestic PNG connections with the 2011 Census data; and (ii)\nthe absence of a cap or ceiling on the \"highness\" norm both in relation to the\nthird and the fourth criteria; the provisions contained in the 2008 CGD\nAuthorisation Regulations, as amended on 6-4-2018, indicated that where a\nspecific linkage was sought with reference to the 2011 Census data, a clear\nand categorical provision was made to that effect; such provisions were\nfound in regard to the financial capability of a bidder as part of the minimum\neligibility criteria in \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n, and the extent of the performance\nbond in \nRegulation 5(6)(h)\n; absent a condition in \nRegulation 7\n, linking the\n\"highness\" of the number of PNG connections to be achieved within eight\nyears from the date of authorisation with the 2011 Census data, it would be\ncontrary to basic principles of interpretation to read such a restriction into the\nCGD Authorisation Regulations; a conditionality which had not been\nincorporated in \nRegulation 7\n could not be introduced as a matter of\nconstruction; and the Court must first and foremost read the Regulation in\naccordance with its plain and natural meaning.\n\n69. The Supreme Court then observed that there was evidently a reason\nwhy \nRegulation 7\n did not introduce a ceiling or provide for a linkage with the\nCensus data of 2011; consumers or users, as the case may be, in a CGD\nnetwork broadly comprised of four categories, namely: (i) Domestic; (ii)\nCommercial; (iii) Industrial; and (iv) Vehicular; the Board had submitted with\njustification that, in a model of cross-subsidisation, the viability of the project\nhad to be perceived from a twenty-five-year perspective; gains in one\ncategory of users could offset the losses in another category; the CGD\nAuthorisation Regulations were intended to subserve the object of\nestablishing the infrastructure necessary for setting up an operational CGD\nnetwork; in creating the infrastructure, the successful entity was\ncontractually bound to set up a project for the future; the infrastructure so\ncreated would be of service to consumers or, as the case may be, users;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 46 of 184\n\n infrastructural projects catered to future needs could legitimately be forward\nlooking; it was from this perspective that, except for the tariff in the first two\nbidding criteria of \nRegulation 7\n (the transportation rates for CGD and CNG),\nno ceiling was provided by the Board for the criteria set out in \nRegulation 7\n;\nmore particularly, \nRegulation 7(3)\n provided for a mandate to tabulate and\ncompare the bids of all entities which had met the minimum eligibility criteria\nupon their qualifying in a competitive bidding process; the Regulations did\nnot contemplate the disqualification of a bidder with reference to a norm\nwhich would limit a bid to 100% of the population figures provided by the\n2011 Census data; and for the Board to stipulate an absolute norm to that\neffect, when it has not been specifically incorporated in the Regulations,\nwould have rendered the decision-making process vulnerable to a challenge\non the ground that it was not consistent with \nRegulation 7\n.\n\n70. The Supreme Court then held that Clause 1.1.1 of the bid document.\nincorporated a reference to the GA as depicted in the map set out in\nAnnexure 1, for which the Board was inviting bids for the grant of an\nauthorisation to develop a CGD network; the main plank of the submissions\nof the appellants was that the map contained a reference to population and\nhousehold figures on the basis of the 2011 Census; clause 1.1.3 placed the\nresponsibility on the bidder to obtain information about the present gas\nsupply availability, the pipeline connectivity and the existing customers in the\nGA; significantly, the scope of work in Clause 1.2 required bidding entities\n\"to lay, build, operate or expand the CDG networks\" to meet the requirement\nof natural gas\" in domestic, commercial and industrial segments including\nnatural gas in the vehicular segment in the said geographical area to be\nauthorised\"; bidders were required under Clause 2.1.1 to examine the\ncontents of the bid document including instructions, terms and conditions\nand regulations of the Board; the bidder was required to carefully study the\nGA and the charge area before submitting the bid; in other words, bidders\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 47 of 184\n\n were on notice of the actions required to be taken to implement the\nRegulations; the bid document necessarily had to be in conformity with the\nCGD Authorisation Regulations; the map, at best, was a compendium of the\nlatest official record of the GA; the map did not dictate how the number of\ndomestic PNG connections was to be calculated; there was no such\nindication particularly in Clause 1 of the bid document where the map was\nreferenced; the mere attachment of a map to the bid document would not\nresult in the imposition of conditions of eligibility or qualification; these have\nbeen provided in the Regulations which have a statutory character; and the\ndepiction of the GA in a map attached to the bid document did not override\nthe specific requirements of the bidding criteria as defined in \nRegulation 7\n.\n\n71. With respect to the appellants' contention, that the decision which was\ntaken in the form of the Board Note dated 23-7-2018 had categorically\nstipulated a range of 2% to 100% of the number of households as per the\n2011 Census as the minimum/maximum threshold to judge the\nreasonableness of the bids and, despite this, the decision of the Board dated\n10-8-2018 virtually reversed the earlier decision recorded in the Board Note\nof 23-7-2018 thereby tainting the decision-making process with arbitrariness,\nthe Supreme Court summarized the contentions as under: (I) the 2 to 100%\ncriterion based on the 2011 Census data was the basis on which the bids for\n79 out of 86 GAs were evaluated; (ii) in respect of the bids for four GAs (out\nof the remaining seven GAs) where the highest bidder had bid a number of\nPNG connections below 2% of the number provided by the 2011 Census,\nthose four bidders were furnished with an opportunity to improve their bids\nand match the 2% threshold; (iii) it was only for the three bidders, with the\nhighest composite scores in GAs 51, 61 and 62, that the bids were evaluated\nwith reference to the projected number of households in 2026; and (iv) for\nexample, in GA 62 (Chennai-Tiruvallur), there were ten bidders of whom the\nbids of nine were evaluated with reference to the 2011 Census data on the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 48 of 184\n\n number of households, whereas the bid of one bidder (Torrent Gas Pvt. Ltd.)\nhad been evaluated with reference to the number of projected households\nin 2026.\n\n72. The Supreme Court held that the CGD Authorisation Regulations, as\namended on 6-4-2018, revealed that the Regulations did not contain any\nstipulation determining a range of 2 to 100% of the number of households\nunder the 2011 Census as the criterion to evaluate bids; the Regulations did\nnot link the \"highness\" factor of domestic PNG connections to the 2011\nCensus data; in Clause 4.4.1 of the bid document, the Board reserved to\nitself the right to reject any unreasonably high or low bid; in Addendum 1 to\nthe bid document, the Board clarified to all prospective bidders that the\nevaluation of whether a bid was unreasonably low or high would be\nconducted on a case-to-case basis at the time of bid evaluation; if the Board\nNote of 23-7-2018 were to be construed in the manner in which the\nappellants had urged, the automatic disqualification of bidders based on a\ncriterion introduced by the Board Note would raise serious doubts about its\nfairness and legality; this was because the Board Note was not notified to\nbidders as a basis for evaluation of bids before the date for the submission\nof the bids had closed; to disqualify a bidder on the basis of a criterion which\nwas not notified and of which bidders had no knowledge would be arbitrary\nand would constitute an infraction of \nArticle 14;\n the Board was thus correct\nin determining that the automatic disqualification of a bid on the basis of a\ncriterion specified in the Board Note (which was never notified to the bidders)\nwould not be \"legally correct\"; hence, it would be reasonable to interpret the\nBoard Note dated 23-7-2018 as being the formulation of a guideline for the\nBoard; as a guideline in the process of evaluation, the decision taken by the\nBoard on 23-7-2018 was not to the effect that every bid below 2% or above\n100% would necessarily stand disqualified; consistently with the use of the\nword \"may be\", the decision of the Board meant that the power which the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 49 of 184\n\n Board reserved to itself in Clause 4.4.1 could be invoked if it came to the\nconclusion that the bid had not been justified to be reasonable; in other\nwords, the breaching of the range of 2 to 100% was a trigger for the Board\nto scrutinise the bid and determine whether the power under Clause 4.4.1\nshould be invoked; hence, the course of action which the Board followed of\ncalling upon the bidders with the highest composite scores in GAs 51, 61\nand 62 to justify their bids in terms of their reasonableness could not be\nfaulted; on the contrary, if the Board had rejected these bids solely on the\nground that they were above the limit of 100% of households under the 2011\nCensus data, the decision would have been seriously flawed for having\napplied a criterion which was not a part of the Regulations, was not\nembodied in the bid document and. in any event, was not notified to bidders\nbefore they had submitted their bids; evidently, for the purpose of projecting\nthe number of PNG connections within a GA, it was the number of\nhouseholds and not the overall population that was relevant as each\nhousehold was unlikely to have more than one PNG connection; moreover,\nas neither the CGD Regulations nor the bid document required the number\nof projected households to be calculated on the basis of the 2011 Census\ndata, the decision of the Board to accept the justification provided by the\nbidders could not be attacked on the ground that the figures provided did not\nstrictly match the numbers extrapolated from the 2011 Census data; the\npower granted to the Board under Clause 14.2 of the bid document was an\nenabling clause that allowed the Board to apply its mind to a quote and\ndetermine its reasonableness; the quotes submitted by all bidders with\nrespect to the projected number of households in 2026 were admittedly\nestimates; similarly, the Board's own determination of a baseline for\ncomparing the reasonableness of various quotes was also an estimate;\ntherefore, the Board's use of the baseline figure and its consequent\nacceptance of the reasonability of a quote could not be faulted because it\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 50 of 184\n\n did not strictly adhere to one particular methodology of arriving at a number\nof projected households unless the methodology used was arbitrary, having\nno correlation with the result sought to be achieved; on a bare construction\nof the Board Note dated 23-7-2018 and the fact that the Board Note was\nformulated after the last date for the submission of bids, the Board Note did\nnot set out absolute criteria for disqualification of bids; the agenda note dated\n9th August merely tabled a proposal to apply the criteria of 2 to 100% range,\nbut the Board did not subsequently adopt this course of action, a decision\nwithin its power and indeed necessary to preserve the integrity of the bidding\nprocess; having established that the Board Note was not an absolute binding\ncriteria, and the Tribunal was approached only with respect to GAs 51, 61\nand 62, the Board's treatment of other GAs could not be decisive in\ndetermining the legality of the authorisations granted in GAs 51, 61 and 62,\nespecially where the Board's actions in respect of the other GAs had not\nbeen independently challenged; the assessment of the reasonability of the\nbid was a matter solely between the highest bidder and the Board; such an\nassessment would not alter the scores of the highest bidder vis-à-vis the\nscores of the other bidders; the sole question was whether the highest\nbidder's quote was reasonable, and the power to determine such\nreasonability resided solely with the Board by virtue of Clause 14.2 of the bid\ndocument; and, thus, the presence and hearing of other bidders was not\nnecessary.\n\n B. REGULATION 7 OF THE 2008 REGULATIONS:\n\n73. \nIn \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, while the Supreme Court was no doubt examining the\ngrant of authorization for GA 9.61- Kanchipuram District and GA 9.62 --\nChennai & Tiruvallur Districts, which are also the subject matter of the\npresent appeal, the appeal before the Supreme Court was in challenge to\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 51 of 184\n\n the validity of the decision of the Board, to award LoIs for these GAs, on the\nground that the successful bids were beyond the unreasonably high limit\nadopted by the Board.

ANALYSIS:\n\n75. On the relevance of the 2011 Census data in the bidding process, it\nwas contended on behalf of the appellants, in \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum\n& Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n, (2020) 4 SCC 529, that the map\nattached to the bid document did not only describe the land area but also the\npopulation and households comprised in it; the figures for population and\nnumber of households in the map attached to the bid document were drawn\nfrom the 2011 Census; out of the 86 GAs, which were part of the ninth round\nof bidding, certain parts of several GAs were excluded from the zone of\nauthorization, and the population/household number was proportionally\nreduced to reflect the population/households as per the reduced area; the\nmap annexed to the bid document depicted not only the land area but also\nthe population/number of households which were intrinsically inter-twined in\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 58 of 184\n\n the bid parameters; clause 1.1.3 of the bid document mandated bidders to\nlook at the \"existing population\"; and clause 1.1.1 required bidders to bear in\nmind the population/households as given in the map annexed to the bid\ndocument.\n\n76. It is in this context that the Supreme Court observed that the relevance\nof the 2011 Census data must be assessed in the context of the CGD\nAuthorisation Regulations as amended on 6-4-2018; \nRegulation 5(6)\n\nrequired the fulfilment of minimum eligibility criteria, and for the Board to\nscrutinise the bids of only those entities which fulfilled the minimum eligibility\ncriteria; and the bidding criteria in \nRegulation 7\n were not linked to the 2011\nCensus figures.\n\n77. It is useful, in this context, to note what Regulations 5(6)(e) and 5(6)(h)\nof the 2008 Regulations stipulate. \nRegulation 5\n relates to the criteria for\nselection of entity for expression of interest route. \nRegulation 5(6)\n requires\nthe Board to scrutinize the bids received in response to the advertisement in\nrespect of only those entities which fulfil the following minimum eligibility\ncriteria, namely, among others, (e) the entity has adequate financial\nstrength to execute the proposed project, operate and maintain the same\nin the authorized area and shall meet the following financial criterion to\nqualify for bidding for a single CGD network, namely:-\n\n Population in the geographical Minimum net worth of\n area [as per latest census of India] the bidder entity\n (1) (2)\n 5 million or more Rs.1,500 million for a\n population of 5 million,\n plus additional Rs. 300\n million for each 1 million\n of population or part\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 59 of 184\n\n thereof, in excess of 5\n million (refer Note - 3)\n\n 2 million or more but less than 5 Rs.1,000 million\n million\n 1 million or more but less than 2 million Rs. 750 million\n\n 0.5 million or more but less than Rs.500 million\n 1 million\n 0.25 million or more but less Rs.250 million\n than 0.50 million\n 0.1 million or more but less than Rs.100 million\n 0.25 million\n Less than 0.1 million Rs.50 million\n Note - 1 The above minimum net-worth is applicable in case the\n bidder entity bids for a single geographical area in a particular\n bidding round.\n\n Note - 2 In case a bidder entity bids for more than one\n geographical area, then, the minimum net-worth requirement\n shall be calculated by considering 100% of minimum net-worth\n required for the bidded geographical area having the highest\n population, plus 20% of minimum net-worth required for each of\n the other geographical areas. For example, if a bidder has bidded\n for four geographical areas namely A, B,C and D and out of these\n four geographical areas, C has the highest population, then\n minimum net-worth requirement shall be calculated as minimum\n net-worth requirement of C plus 20% of minimum net-worth\n requirements for A, B and D each.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 60 of 184\n\n Note - 3 For example, if the population is 8.4 million, then the\n minimum net-worth required shall be Rs. 2,700 million (i.e. Rs.\n 1,500 million for initial 5 million of population, plus Rs. 1,200\n million for 3.4 million of population in excess of 5 million).\n\n(i) Net-worth of a bidder entity shall be computed as per Schedule-K.\n\n78. \nRegulation 5(6)(h)\n required the entity to furnish a bid bond, in the form\nof Bank Guarantee or demand draft or pay order from any scheduled bank\ndrawn in favour of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board\npayable at New Delhi, for an amount equal to- (i) rupees fifty million for a\npopulation of five million and proportionately higher amount for population\nof more than five million; (ii) rupees thirty million for a population of one\nmillion and more but less than five million; (iii) rupees twenty million for a\npopulation of half a million and more but less than one million; (iv) rupees\nfifteen million for a population of quarter of a million and more but less than\nhalf a million; (v) rupees ten million for a population of one-tenth of a million\nand more but less than quarter of a million; and (vi) rupees five million for a\npopulation less than one-tenth of a million.\n\n79. \nIn \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, the Supreme Court drew a distinction between\nRegulations 5(6)(e) and 5(6)(h) on the one hand, and \nRegulation 7\n of the\n2008 Regulations on the other, to hold that the 2008 Regulations indicated\nthat, where a specific linkage was sought with reference to the 2011 Census\ndata, a clear and categorical provision was made to that effect; such\nprovisions were found in regard to the financial capability of a bidder as part\nof the minimum eligibility criteria in \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n, and the extent of the\nperformance bond in \nRegulation 5(6)(h)\n; absent a condition in \nRegulation 7\n,\nlinking the \"highness\" of the number of PNG connections to be achieved\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 61 of 184\n\n within eight years from the date of authorisation with the 2011 Census data,\nsuch a restriction could not be read into the 2008 Regulations.\n\n80. On the contention of the appellants that the map contained a reference\nto population and household figures on the basis of the 2011 Census, the\nSupreme Court, after referring to clauses 1.1.3, 1.2 and 2.1.1 of the\nApplication cum Bid Document, observed that the bidder was required to\ncarefully study the GA and the charge area before submitting the bid; the bid\ndocument necessarily had to be in conformity with the 2008 Regulations; the\nmap, at best, was a compendium of the latest official record of the GA; the\nmere attachment of a map to the bid document would not result in the\nimposition of conditions of eligibility or qualification, as these have been\nprovided in the Regulations; the depiction of the GA in a map attached to the\nbid document did not override the specific requirements of the bidding\ncriteria as defined in \nRegulation 7\n; the Regulations did not link the \"highness\"\nfactor of domestic PNG connections to the 2011 Census data; neither the\n2008 Regulations nor the bid document required the number of projected\nhouseholds to be calculated on the basis of the 2011 Census data; and the\ndecision of the Board to accept the justification provided by the bidders could\nnot be attacked on the ground that the figures provided did not strictly match\nthe numbers extrapolated from the 2011 Census data.\n\n81. Unlike in \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory\nBoard\n, (2020) 4 SCC 529, the dispute, in the present appeal, relates to 19\nCNG stations all of which, even according to the 2nd Respondent, were\nlocated within the then Kanchipuram District. The submission, urged by\nLearned Senior Counsel and Learned Counsel on either side, vary on the\nmanner in which the boundaries of Kanchipuram District Geographical Area\nshould be determined. The Appellant's contention is that, since the\nKanchipuram District Geographical Area (GA) is co-terminus with the then\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 62 of 184\n\n existing Kanchipuram District, and as there is no dispute that these 19 CNG\nstations fall within the boundaries of Kanchipuram District, these CNG\nstations fall within the authorized area of the Appellant; and the Board erred\nin holding that these CNG stations fall within the geographical area\nauthorised in favour of the second Respondent on the basis of co-ordinates.\n\n82. Even while examining the scope and ambit of \nRegulation 7\n of the 2008\nRegulations, the Supreme Court, in \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural\nGas Regulatory Board\n, (2020) 4 SCC 529, held that the map (in Annexure-\n1 of the ACBD) was, at best, a compendium of the latest official record of the\nGA. If that be so, then all factors, such as area, population, households etc\nas reflected on the right side of the said map, would assume relevance in\ndetermining the contours and extent of each of these GAs ie GA 9,61 and\n9.62.\n\n83. As noted hereinabove, it is not in dispute that the adjoining\ngeographical areas of Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts on the one hand, and\nKanchipuram District GA on the other, do not overlap. it is thus evident that\nthese 19 CNGs stations either fall within the boundaries of Chennai-\nTiruvallur District GA or Kanchipuram District GA. As shall be detailed\nhereinafter, both the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations obligate the\nPNGRB to clearly identify the GAs for which bids are intended to be invited\nbefore commencing the exercise of inviting bids for the concerned\ngeographical areas. What we are required to examine, in the present appeal,\nis the exercise undertaken by the PNGRB to identify the boundaries of GAs\n9.61 and 9.62. Since this question did not arise for consideration in \nAdani\nGas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n, (2020) 4 SCC\n529, reliance placed on behalf of the 2nd Respondent on the said judgement,\nto contend that the data referred to on the right side of the map is irrelevant\nin determining the boundaries of the GAs, is misplaced.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 63 of 184\n\n VII. APPLICATION-CUM-BID DOCUMENT (\"ACBD\"):\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n84. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that the ACBD was issued by the Board on\n12.04.2018; (1) Cl. 1.1.1 of the ACBD states that PNGRB \"has identified\" the\nGA and is \"accordingly\" inviting applications-cum-bids for the \"aforesaid\ngeographical area\" as depicted in the map at Annexure-1; thus, the bids\nwhich were invited, and the area which was depicted, is the area which stood\nidentified by the Board in terms of \nSection 19\n, i.e., the area comprised in the\nrespective districts; (2) in Clause 2.1.2, Annexure 1 is described as the \"Map\ndepicting the Geographical Area and the Charge Areas\", and the bidders\nwere asked to carefully study both, before submitting the bid; the entire\nAnnexure 1, including all the attribute data mentioned therein, constitutes\nthe map and depiction of the Geographical Area; and the GA and the Charge\nAreas are sacrosanct as per ACBD and the Regulations; (3) Annexure 1 to\nthe ACBD describes the Geographical Area with reference to various factors,\nincluding its total area, population, number of households, Charge Areas,\ntowns/ villages comprised therein, overlapping of the district and GA\nboundary etc; the 2nd Respondent is bound by the various attribute data\nwhich it had submitted as part of its offer to the Board, including the total\narea, the population etc., which correspond to the data of the districts of\nChennai and Tiruvallur; (4) thereafter, various bidders sought clarifications\nand the Board issued Corrigenda, correcting the attribute data of several\nmaps; if the GAs were identifiable at this stage only with reference to co-\nordinates, and not Districts, there was no public record available for the\nvarious data figures of the GA; it was thus not possible for any bidder to seek\nany clarification or the Board to issue any Corrigendum, for a GA allegedly\nidentified with reference to co-ordinates; and the population and number of\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 64 of 184\n\n households could, if at all, be derived by undertaking an exercise akin to that\ncarried out by the Survey of India and the Census of India, which was clearly\nnot done.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n85. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel, would submit that the\napplication-cum-bid document (\"ACBD\") for the 9th CGD Bidding Round was\nissued by PNGRB on 12.04.2018; a GA map along with geo-coordinates was\nweb hosted with the bid document for each GA; some of the important\nprovisions of the bid document were as follows: (a) Clause 1.1.1 of the Bid\nDocument stated that the PNGRB has identified the GA considering\navailability of natural gas and pipeline connectivity in the GA or in its vicinity\nfor development of CGD network; further Clause 1.1.1 also states that\nPNGRB is accordingly inviting applications-cum-bids for grant of\nauthorization for developing City Gas Distribution (CGD) network in the\naforesaid geographical area as depicted in the map at Annexure-1; (b)\nClause 1.1.3 stated that it is the bidder's responsibility to obtain all\ninformation related to the present gas supply availability and pipeline\nconnectivity and also existing customers, if any, in the specific GA; (c) Clause\n2.1.1 stated that the bidder is expected to examine all the contents of the Bid\nDocument, including all instructions, terms and conditions and all the\nregulations of the Board, and the Bid Document, together with all its\nannexures, shall be considered to be read, understood and accepted by the\nbidder; (d) Clause 2.1.2 of the Bid Document stated that the application-\ncum-bid document inter alia comprises of the following annexures: (i)\nAnnexure 1 - Map depicting the Geographical Areas and Charge Areas: The\nbidder shall carefully study the geographical area and charge areas before\nsubmitting their Application-cum-Bid, and (ii) Annexure 1 of the Bid\nDocument: The bidder shall carefully study the geographical area and\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 65 of 184\n\n charge area before submitting their Application- cum-Bid; thus the map for\neach GA was supplied by PNGRB as Annexure 1 of the Bid Document; the\ngeo-spatial coordinates i.e. latitude and longitude were an integral part of\neach map; and opportunities were also available to bidders to seek any\nclarifications, if required prior to the bid submission.\n\n C. RELEVANT CLAUSES OF THE APPLICATION CUM BID\n DOCUMENT:\n\n86. Part A of the Application-cum-Bid document (\"ACBD\" for short)\ncontains the instructions to the bidders. Reference of the bidders is drawn\nthereby to the Regulations applicable to them which includes the 2008\nauthorisation regulations and the amendments thereto. Clause 1.1 of the\nACBD relates to the geographical area and related information. Clause 1.1.1\nstates that the PNGRB has identified this geographical area considering the\navailability of natural gas and pipeline connectivity in the GA or in its vicinity\nfor development of CGD network; PNGRB was, accordingly, inviting\nApplications-cum-Bids for grant of authorisation for developing City Gas\nDistribution (CGD) network in the aforesaid geographical area as depicted\nin the map at Annexure-1. Clause 1.1.2 states that the charge areas are also\ndepicted in the map; if the bidding entity is finally granted authorization, the\nentity shall be required to reach the charge areas as stipulated in the CGD\nauthorisation Regulations. Clause 1.1.3 makes it clear that it is the bidder's\nresponsibility to obtain all information related to the gas supply availability\nand pipeline connectivity and also existing customers, if any, in the specified\ngeographical area; the bidder can also refer to list of NOCs/Permissions\ngranted by the PNGRB to various entities under the provisions of the internal\nguidelines for grant of NOC/Permission for (i) supply/distribution of\nCBM/natural gas through cascades; and (ii) setting up of CNG/LNG\nDaughter Booster Stations (DBS) in the areas where the Board has not yet\nauthorised any entity for developing or operating CGD networks at\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 66 of 184\n\n http:///www.pngrb.gov.in/CGD-NOCs.html; these NOCs/Permissions are\nsubject to the conditions contained in the Internal Guidelines and include the\ncondition that in case the area, in which supply/distribution of CBM/natural\ngas through cascades and/or setting up of CNG/LNG DBS are allowed, is\ncovered under any authorised GA in future, then such entity to whom\nNOC/permission has been granted shall obtain prior approval from the\nauthorised entity for continuation of such activities or shall cease its activities\nimmediately. Clause 1.2 relates to the scope of work and, thereunder, the\nentities bidding for this work shall be required to lay, build, operate or expand\nthe CGD network to meet the requirement of natural gas in domestic,\ncommercial and industrial segments, including compressed natural gas in\nthe vehicular segment, in the said geographical area to be authorized, and\nalso to comply with the relevant regulations notified from time to time; and\nthe entities shall be required to carry out the development of CGD project in\nline with the regulations \nlaid down by\n the PNGRB.\n\n87. Clause 2.0 of the ACBD relates to the bidding documents and Clause\n2.1 to documentation. Clause 2.1.1 provides that the bidder is expected to\nexamine all the contents of the Application-cum-Bid document, including all\ninstructions, forms, terms and conditions and all the regulations of PNGRB;\n\nthe Application-cum-Bid document together with all its annexures thereto\nshall be considered to be read, understood and accepted by the bidder;\nfailure to furnish all the information required as per the Application-cum-Bid\ndocument or submission of Application-cum-Bid not complete in every\nrespect will be at the bidder's risk and may result in rejection of the\nApplication-cum-Bid. Clause 2.1.2 stipulates that the Application-cum-Bid\ndocument comprises of the following Annexures and the bidder shall note\nthe following with respect to these Annexures, Annexure 1 to Annexure 13\nas well as Annexure 1 of Part B are detailed thereunder. Annexure 1 is the\nmap depicting the geographical area and charge area, and the bidders were\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 67 of 184\n\n directed to carefully study the geographical are and the charge areas before\nsubmitting the bid.\n\n88. Clause 2.2 of the ACBE relates to clarifications of the Application-cum-\nBid document, and Clause 2.2.1 stipulates that the entity requiring any\nclarification shall obtain the same from the Secretary, PNGRB in writing so\nas to ensure submission of the Application-cum-Bid on or before the bid\nclosing date; the PNGRB will respond in writing to such queries, which are\nreceived up to one month from first day of bid sale period; written copies of\nthe PNGRB's response (including explanation of the query but without\nidentifying the source of the query) will be hosted on the web site of the\nPNGRB. Annexure 1 to the ABCD, which relates to the map depicting the\ngeographical area and the charge area, also requires the bidder to carefully\nstudy the geographical area and charge area before submitting their\nApplication-cum-Bid.\n\n D. ANALYSIS:\n\n89. While the physical map, on the left side of Annexure-1, no doubt\ncontains the longitudes and latitudes of the Geographical Area, and must\ntherefore be held to form an integral part of the map, it must also be borne\nin mind that the other details on the right side of Annexure-1, such as the\narea of the GA in square kilometres, the total number of households in the\nGA as per the 2011 Census, the total population of the GA as per the 2011\nCensus, details of the charge areas of the GA, and on the left side of\nAnnexure-1 itself, details such as the boundaries of the charge areas as\nrecorded in the physical map, location of the 9 villages with a population of\nabove 5000 where 15 of the 19 PNG stations are located, the district\nboundary of Kanchipuram District overlapping the GA boundary of GA 9.61\netc, are also relevant and must also be held to form an integral part of the\nmap in Annexure-1. While the 2nd Respondent seeks to highlight the failure\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 68 of 184\n\n of the Appellant to seek clarifications prior to bid submission, what it has\nchosen not to state is that if, as is now contended before us, the information\non the righthand side of the map is irrelevant and the other factors referred\nto in the physical map are erroneous, the 2nd Respondent should also have\nsought necessary clarifications, which they chose not to do. That the\nPNGRB had held in favour of the 2nd Respondent on the basis of co-\nordinates would not, by itself, justify our ignoring all the other details, given\nboth on the left side and the right side of the map of Annexure-1 of the ACBD,\napart from the co-ordinates.\n\n90. Since the PNGRB has, in the impugned order, applied the co-ordinates\ntest, it would be appropriate to consider the appellant's challenge thereto,\nbefore examining the factors relied on by them to contend that the\nboundaries of the Kanchipuram District GA are co-terminus with the\nboundaries of the then Kanchipuram District. Let us first examine the 2nd\nRespondent's contentions regarding the appellant's pleadings both in their\ncomplaint filed before the PNGRB and thereafter in the appeal filed before\nus.\n\n VIII. HAS THE APPELLANT, IN ITS PLEADINGS,\n ACKNOWLEDGED THE EXISTENCE OF 'COORDINATES':\n\n91. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n2nd Respondent, would submit that, during its oral submissions, the\nappellant has disputed the existence of geo-coordinates, and has\nsubmitted that the PNGRB maps do not contain the geo-coordinates of\neven a single point of the GA or its boundary; apart from these contentions\nbeing raised only for the first time before this Tribunal, this submission is\nalso absurd; in its complaint before the PNGRB, the appellant has\nrepeatedly acknowledged that the map given by the PNGRB contains\n'coordinates' i.e. the latitude and longitude; in fact, the appellant had\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 69 of 184\n\n claimed in its complaint before the PNGRB that it had not \"physically\nverified\" the coordinates i.e. latitude and longitude specified in the map,\nthereby accepting the existence of co-ordinates; prayer (e) of the complaint\nfiled by the appellant before PNGRB also shows that the\nexistence of co-ordinates has not been disputed; even in its appeal before\nthis Tribunal, the appellant has not disputed the fact that the GA maps\ncontain co-ordinates; and it is evident from a perusal of the aforesaid\npleadings that the appellant had never disputed the existence of co-\nordinates in its submissions before the PNGRB.\n\n A. ANALYSIS:\n\n92. In Para 3.1.5(iv), of their complaint filed before the Board, the Appellant\nstated that the 2nd Respondent's contention, that its authorised Chennai GA\nspread over certain parts of Kanchipuram District as per the map web-hosted\nby the Board, was false and fraudulent, since the 2nd respondent's contention\naccorded significance only, and in supersession of vectors, legends etc.\nmarked on the Authorized map, to the co-ordinates i.e. the latitudes and\nlongitude figures of the boundary marked on the authorized map, which\nformed no part of the identification of the GA by the PNGRB; all these data\n(referred to in Para 3.1.5(iv)) could not be disregarded, on the basis of a\nmap, subsequent to the dispute with reference only to the coordinates and\ncontours of the boundary.\n\n93. In Para 4.7 of the very same complaint, the Appellant had stated that\nit had submitted the bid for Kanchipuram GA on the basis of the information\nand data provided in the ACBD for Kanchipuram District, including the total\narea, population, number of households, villages, towns, airport etc; the co-\nordinates, i.e. the latitudes and longitudes specified in the map, were not\nphysically verified by the Appellant to check whether the Vectors and\nLegends mentioned in the map corresponded to the latitudes and longitudes\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 70 of 184\n\n mentioned in the edges, since there was no requirement or obligation for\nthem to do so; the specific latitudes and longitudes did not, within\nthemselves, have any commercial significance; and it was not viable to\nundertake a physical verification exercise of going to individual villages,\nverifying their coordinates and matching it with the authorized map, as such\nan exercise was neither contemplated nor undertaken by any of the bidders.\nIn Para 4.22 of the complaint, the Appellant stated that the co-ordinates can,\nat best, be used by an authorized entity to identify its boundaries, and cannot\nbe used by any other entity to alter their respective geographical areas.\n\n94. Further in Para 6.2(e), among the final reliefs sought by them from the\nPNGRB, the Appellant sought a direction from the Board to hold that the co-\nordinates, given on the side of the rectangle framing the map provided with\nthe authorization, were not capable of changing the identified details and\nspecifications of a particular Geographical Area including: (i) the total area,\ntotal population and total households; and (ii) identified talukas, towns,\nvillages, landmarks, district headquarters specified to be comprising a\nparticular Geographical Area.\n\n95. It is clear from the afore-said averments in the complaint, as also the\nprayers made by them to the Board, that the Appellant's grievance was\nmainly that the details furnished on the right hand side of the map should be\ngiven preference over the co-ordinates i.e. latitudes and longitudes specified\nin the map, more so as they could not be specifically verified by the Appellant\nto check whether the vectors and legends mentioned in the map\ncorresponded to the latitudes and longitudes mentioned on the edges.\n\n96. Even in the Appeal filed before this Tribunal (in Para 7 Page 23), the\nquestion of law raised was whether the geo-spatial co-ordinates, indicated\non the map issued with the letter of authorization, formed the sole and\nexclusive basis for determination of the extent of the geographical area\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 71 of 184\n\n authorized to an entity. It does not appear to be the Appellant's case, even\nin the Appeal filed before this Tribunal, that the latitudes and longitudes\nindicated in the map could not be relied upon, and such contentions are\nbeing urged across the bar for the first time during the course of hearing of\nthis appeal.\n\n97. In the light of the fact that the appellant has not disputed the existence\nof co-ordinates in the physical map in Annexure-1, and has only contended\nthat the other information given in the map would be the relevant\nconsideration for determination of the boundaries of the GA, we may not be\njustified in examining whether or not the map contains co-ordinates. Since\nelaborate arguments were put forth in this regard, and to avoid the possibility\nof our being faulted for not taking note of them, we reproduce the\nsubmissions, urged by Learned Senior Counsel and Learned Counsel, in\nthis regard making it clear that we do not intend expressing any opinion\nthereupon as it is un-necessary for us to do so.\n\n IX. CO-ORDINATES TEST:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n98. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that, even if the co-ordinates test is to be applied, it\nmust be applied with reference to the correct co-ordinate based map of the\nSurvey of India, as per which, even the alleged coordinates of the CNG\nstations as per the 2nd Respondent, fall in GA 9.61 of the appellant;\napplication of co-ordinates must be on the SOI digital map which is,\nadmittedly, the source map for the authorization maps; if the coordinate test\nis applied, it would lead to various regulatory anomalies, some of which are\nnoted in the impugned order, and none of which have been factually\ndisputed; one such anomaly which arises in respect of the Barmer,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 72 of 184\n\n Jaisalmer, Jodhpur Districts GA 9.55, is that a part of the area of the GA, as\nper co-ordinates and principle applied by Board, large part of the authorised\narea falls in Pakistan, which is completely absurd; the co-ordinate test is not\napplicable in the present case, since the authorization maps are not GIS\nmaps; they do not contain the co-ordinates of even a single point of the GA\nor its boundary, but only contain the co-ordinates of the reference grid in\nwhich the map has been placed; a GIS map has been defined by the\nSupreme Court as \"an organised collection of computer hardware, software,\ngeographic data designed to capture all forms of geographically referenced\ninformation (seewww.volusia.org).\" [\nT.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (98) v.\nUnion of India\n, (2006) 5 SCC 28 at para 35]'; clearly, the pdf map issued\nwith the authorization does not match this description; boundaries cannot be\ndetermined by these grid co-ordinates and placing pdf file on a digital\nplatform; the Appellant has made detailed submissions of facts in its Affidavit\ndated 25.04.2023 on the point that the authorization maps are not GIS maps;\nthe processes followed for the preparation of a co-ordinate based geo-\nreferenced map by the Survey of India (SOI) are explained in the Appellant's\nAffidavit dated 25.04.2023; these factual submissions remain\nuncontroverted; coordinates are, but, one of the ways of geo-referencing a\nmap and are not the criteria for determining the authorised area being\ndemarcated by PNGRB for being placed for competitive tender as part of a\nCGD bid round; the tender issued for selection of the map vendor also shows\nthat he was required to geo-reference the map, not with coordinates but\nstandard cartographic symbology and colours; from a bare perusal of the\nauthorization maps, it is evident that there are no co-ordinates of any point\nin the GA or on the boundary of GA are stated therein; in fact, factually, even\nthe 2nd Respondent's case is only that the co-ordinates of the GA boundary\ncan be 'derived' from the map; it is the further case of the 2nd Respondent\nthat, when the coordinates of the CNG stations (as allegedly ascertained by\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 73 of 184\n\n them), and the .shp file provided by PNGRB, are plotted on Google Earth,\nalong with the co-ordinates of the CNG stations, it shows them as falling\nwithin GA 9.62; once all the details of the GA have been clearly provided in\nthe map, and the addresses of the CNG stations are known, there is no\nwarrant for such a derivative exercise; further, the Board itself stated in its\ntender of March, 2021 that \"Use of data from alternative online sources such\nas Google Earth / Google Maps is strictly prohibited as this is strictly against\nthe usage policies of the respective services.\"; the first time the Board sought\npreparation of GA maps geo-referenced with respect to coordinates was by\nissuing a tender for the same in March, 2021; this geo-referencing with\ncoordinates was to be consistent not with any coordinates of any reference\ngrid given in the authorization maps, but with the district boundaries; if the\nauthorization maps were in fact GIS maps, geo-referenced with the co-\nordinates, this whole exercise was completely redundant; if the exercise had\ngone through, any error in the depiction would have been corrected with\nreference to the district boundary as per Survey of India, and not entailed\ncorrection of the attribute data by giving primacy to the juxtaposition of the\ncontours of the boundary with the coordinates of the grid; since there is no\ngeo-referencing exercise which was undertaken by or on behalf of the Board,\neven if the co-ordinate test is applied, it must be applied with reference to\nthe source map, which is the Survey of India map; the appellant has\ndemonstrated in its Affidavit dated 25.04.2023 that conducting such an\nexercise, and assuming, without prejudice, the co-ordinates of the CNG\nstations as stated by the 2nd Respondent to be correct, the CNG Stations in\nquestion fall within GA 9.61 authorized to the appellant; the appellant has\nalso demonstrated that the CNG stations, on the basis of their admitted\naddresses, fall in GA 9.61; and the 2nd Respondent has not disputed these\nmaps and factual submissions, but has argued that the PESO addresses are\nirrelevant.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 74 of 184\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE PNGRB:\n\n99. Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai, Learned Counsel for the PNGRB, would submit\nthat the test to determine a dispute, with regard to boundary (such as the\ninstant case), is \"co-ordinates\" i.e. longitudes and latitudes; the other data\nmentioned in the map such as number of households, population etc.,\nthough part of the map, are determinative for other aspects such as the value\nof the performance bank guarantee etc; it is relevant to take note of\n\nRegulation 5\n of the Authorization Regulations (which provides for bank\nguarantees); the ACBD, in clause 1.1, provides that the GA is 'as depicted\nin the 'map' enclosed; this map is up to scale and co-ordinate based;\ntherefore, it is possible to find out the location of any point based on the co-\nordinates i.e. longitude and latitude; sailors have been using the method for\ncenturies to navigate the open seas; the clause states that \"PNGRB has\nidentified this geographical area ......\"; it only means that the PNGRB has\nidentified the area as depicted in the map and not 'district'; this map is\naccordingly geo-referenced; confusion has been created by the Appellant\nwith regard to the geo- referenced map, digital map, co-ordinate map and\nGIS Map; during oral submissions, the counsel for the Board had referred to\nan article by National (which can be accessed with URL\nhttps://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/geographic-\ninformation-system-gis/4th-grade) and annexed as Annexure - A with\nthis Written Submission, which defines geographic information system\n(GIS) as a computer system for capturing, storing, checking and displaying\ndata related to positions on Earth's surface; it further states that GIS can use\ninformation that includes location which can be expressed in many different\nways such as latitude and longitude, address or ZIP code; therefore, as was\npresented during the oral submissions, GIS is not a separate or different kind\nof map; it is only such a platform or system where data is stored in various\nlayers and can be accessed as such; however, the GIS system is based on\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 75 of 184\n\n co-ordinates i.e. longitude and latitudes; accordingly, a geo-referenced can\nbe digitally stored and shown in a GIS system; the Supreme Court in TN\nGodavarman v UOI (2006) 5 SCC 45 (at para 28 & 29) has dealt with GIS\n(Geographical Information System) and GPS (Global positioning system)\nconcept, and has held that the later technology gives more spatial\ninformation, but that does not mean that the information given by the earlier\ntechnology is inaccurate; the co-ordinate method used by the Board to\ndecide boundary dispute is not erroneous; the Impugned Judgement also\nstates that a visual inspection of the map for the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistricts would make it clear that the GA boundary of Chennal and Tiruvallur\nDistricts extended beyond the district boundary of Chennai and Tiruvallur;\nthe PNGRB further noted that GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62 represented mutually\nexclusive areas and that there was no overlap whatsoever between the two;\nand there is clear finding in the PNGRB impugned order dated 22.12.2022\nthat the map of the GA 9.61 and GA 9.62 coalesce seamlessly.\n\n C. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n100. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that, in terms of the order passed by this Tribunal\non 05.04.2023 in the present appeal, the area of divergence in the present\ncase is \"confined only to the location of the 19 CNG Stations\" as both parties\nclaim that they fall within their respective GAs; a visual inspection of the\nmaps given with the Bid Document for GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62 would show\nthat the maps contain geo-spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude); these\nmaps are admittedly final and sacrosanct; the maps seamlessly merge/\ncoalesce into each other; this shows that the co-ordinates given in the maps\nprovided by PNGRB were accurate, and the maps do not overlap with each\nother; every location on earth has its own unique geo-coordinates; in the\ncase of TN Godavarman v. Union of India & Ors. [(2006) 5 SCC 28], at paras.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 76 of 184\n\n 35 to 37, the Supreme Court has recognized that the latest technology under\nthe Geographical-Information System (GIS) can locate even a pin on earth;\nin the present case, the exact location of the disputed CNG stations can be\nverified only using geo-coordinates as the same are unique to the location\nand do not undergo any change unlike other administrative characteristics\nlike address, names of districts/village/towns etc; the 2nd Respondent first\nascertained the geo-coordinates of each of the CNG stations under\nchallenge; they duly verified if the same fell within the GA awarded to them\nby plotting the coordinates on the map given by PNGRB; the exercise of\nplotting the co-ordinates is straight-forward, it can be undertaken either\nmanually or using any well-accepted GPS software; in fact, the 2nd\nRespondent has demonstrated, in the hearing before this Tribunal, the exact\nlocation of all the 19 CNG stations using co-ordinates by manually plotting\nthem on the PNGRB map; similarly, the 2nd Respondent also demonstrated,\nin its presentation, the exact location of these CNG stations using different\nGIS software; on the contrary, till date, the appellant has not proved or shown\nthe exact location of the CNG stations either on the GA map or in the .shp\nfile provided by PNGRB; all the disputed 19 CNG stations are\nunambiguously within the GA boundary authorized to the 2nd Respondent; in\nits complaint before the PNGRB, the appellant nowhere contended that the\ndisputed 19 CNG stations fell within the GA awarded to the 2nd Respondent\nas per the 'coordinates' test; rather, its only contention (albeit wrong) was\nthat the vendor appointed by PNGRB to prepare the maps made a mistake\nwhile juxtaposing the map with the coordinates; the scope of work for the\nvendor appointed to prepare the said maps further states that \"complete geo-\nreferencing has to be provided in the supplied maps with standard\ncartographic symbology and colours\" (Clause 17.1.1.2); this shows that the\nmaps provided by the vendor were geo-referenced; and the vendor was also\nrequired to ensure submissions in the form of geo- referenced .shp files\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 77 of 184\n\n projected in WGS format besides JPG and PDF (Para. 17.1.1.2(f)); and it\ncan also be visually seen from the map of GA No. 9.62 that an area below\n'Chennai' and around SH-109 (major landmark) is in GA No. 9.62.\n\n101. Though we have refrained from examining the contention urged on\nbehalf of the appellant, for the first time during the hearing of this appeal,\nthat what is shown in the map in Annexure-1 of the ACBD and the\nAuthorisation are not co-ordinates, we must nonetheless consider the\nexercise undertaken by the respondents to locate the 19 CNG Stations on\nthe maps of GA.9.61 and 9.62. As the 2nd Respondent claims to have plotted\nthese stations, by placing the .shp file provided to them by the Board on\nGoogle Earth Platform, we shall take note of the rival submissions in this\nregard. Before that, we must examine the appellant's contention that the .shp\nfiles were not available with the Board when it invited bids in April, 2018.\n\n X. NOT SHARING .SHP FILES: ITS EFFECT:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT:\n\n102. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that it was orally contended by the Board that certain\n.shp files were also available with them at the ACBD stage though, evidently,\nno such file was shared with any bidder; all references to the .shp files in\nthese submissions are without prejudice to the Appellant's contention that\nthe .shp file cannot be considered in the present case since: (i) these files\nwere not made available to either the appellant or the 2nd Respondent, or for\nthat matter to any other bidder, prior to submission of their bids, or even at\nthe stage of authorization; (ii) there is no affidavit on record as to who\nprepared these .shp files, when were they received and if any verification\nthereof was undertaken by the Board; (iii) there is no reference to any .shp\nfile in the ACBD; if such a file existed and the bidders were required to\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 78 of 184\n\n ascertain the extent of their GAs with respect to co-ordinates, there would\nbe no question of PNGRB not making the same available to the bidders at\nthe bidding stage; (iv) if such .shp file existed, and the coordinates were the\ndetermining factor of the GA, at least the Board would have corrected the\ntotal area in sq km, wherever it was inconsistent with the .shp file, by issuing\ncorrigenda; evidently, no such corrigenda, in respect of total area on the\nbasis of .shp file, were issued. (v) there is no record of any co-ordinates\nhaving been supplied to the map vendor for plotting a GA boundary on the\nbasis thereof in an .shp file; Geo-referenced data was not provided to the\nvendor for preparation of the maps, and the vendor was not required to do\nany survey on his own; (vi) when disputes arose between the appellant and\nthe 2nd Respondent, and the appellant requested PNGRB for a digital map\nof GA 9.61 on 17.08.2021, PNGRB, by its response dated 23.09.2021, did\nnot provide this .shp file to the appellant, but referred it to the district\nadministration/ Survey of India/ Census of India.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS OF PNGRB:\n\n103. On the issue of not sharing of .shp files, Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai,\nLearned Counsel for the PNGRB, would submit that an argument was raised\nthat the .shp file was not shared by PNGRB with the Appellant, but had been\nshared with the 2nd Respondent; this is again twisting of the facts; the .shp\nfile needs special software to open; the 2nd Respondent had specifically\nsought .shp file from the Boad, and thus it was shared with them; on the\nother hand, the Appellant had sought a digital map which had already been\nweb-hosted and shared; the same was mentioned in the PNGRB's letter\ndated 23.09.2021. and, in any case, the .shp file was also shared with the\nAppellant during the oral submissions before this Tribunal.\n\n C. SUBMISSIONS OF 2ND RESPONDENT:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 79 of 184\n\n 104. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that the PNGRB had clarified, in January, 2020,\nthat it has .shp files for all the 136 GAs awarded in 9th and 10th Rounds;\ntherefore, the appellant's contention that there were no GIS maps available\nwith the PNGRB in 2018, by referring to the tender floated by PNGRB for\npreparation of GIS maps in 2021, is incorrect and misleading; the map issued\nwith the Bid Document has itself been prepared using the .shp files given by\nthe PNGRB; and, in such a scenario, there can be no question of any\ndifference between the .shp files and the map enclosed with the Bid\nDocument.\n\n D. ANALYSIS:\n\n105. By email dated 01.09.2020, the 2nd Respondent requested the PNGRB\nto share the Geo-coordinates map of the Geographical Area of Chennai and\nTiruvallur (GA-ID 9.52) for demarcating their GA boundary. In reply thereto,\nthe Board forthwith, vide e-mail of the same date i.e. 01.09.2020, forwarded,\na copy of the .SHP file for Chennai and Tiruvallur District GA to the 2nd\nRespondent.\n\n106. After authorization was granted to the Appellant on 26.09.2018, and\nthe Appellant had, vide their letter dated 20.02.2020, accepted the terms and\nconditions of the authorization, they addressed letter dated 17.08.2021 to\nthe Respondent - Board requesting to be furnished a digital map showing\nthe administrative boundaries of Kanchipuram District (ID-9.61) for detailed\nplanning and development of the infrastructure. The Appellant informed the\nBoard that, while they had already procured the Survey of India Map in digital\nform, which was the basis for setting up the administrative boundaries of the\nGA by PNGRB, they should be provided the same as duly authenticated by\nthe Board. The Appellant also informed the PNGRB that the latter had issued\nTender for supplying GIS based Geographical Area maps, which was based\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 80 of 184\n\n on the Survey of India map; and that they be informed if the Board had\nfinalised these agencies to provide the map, in which event, they could\nprocure the same from these agencies with due permission from the\nPNGRB.\n\n107. In reply, the Board, vide letter dated 23.09.2021, informed the\nAppellant that the Tender issued in 2021 for supplying GIS based\nGeographical Area maps was cancelled by the PNGRB and no agency was\nhired under the said tender; along with the authorisation letters of the afore-\nsaid GAs, a GIS map indicating the respective GA area and boundaries had\nalready been provided; the district boundaries with the GAs were considered\nto be as defined by the Survey of India/ Office of the Registrar General &\nCensus Commissioner, India or the respective local authority, such as district\nadministration; and in case any confirmation was required in relation to a\ndistrict's boundary, the same shall be dealt directly with the district\nAdministration or Municipal Corporation.\n\n108. The 2nd Respondent informed the Appellant, vide letter dated\n22.02.2022, that, before commencing activities in their authorised\nGeographical Area, the 2nd Respondent, as a duty-bound CGD entity, had\nsought the original maps (digital maps) used by the PNGRB for the geo-\ncoordinates map, in order to dispel any confusion that could arise in the\nidentification of the boundary limits of the respective authorised entities; the\ndigital maps were received on 01.09.2020 from the PNGRB; these maps\nwere exactly as per the co-ordinates web hosted for the bid and later forming\npart of the CGD authorisation.\n\n109 The .SHP files, on which reliance is now placed on behalf of the\nrespondents to contend that location of each of these 19 CNG stations, on\napplication of the coordinates test, would fall within GA 9.62, were not made\navailable by the Board along with the application-cum-bid document web-\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 81 of 184\n\n hosted on the PNGRB website on 12.04.2018. It is indeed disconcerting\nthat the Board should withhold such an important document and make it\navailable only to the 2nd Respondent at their request on 01.09.2020 after an\nauthorization was granted in their favour. Even worse is the Appellant's\ncase, in that they were not even furnished a copy of the .SHP files till during\nthe hearing of the present Appeal when, by order dated 20.09.2023, we had\ndirected the PNGRB to make available the .SHP files both to the appellant\nand the 2nd Respondent.\n\n110. In our order dated 20.09.2023, we had recorded the submission urged\non behalf of the Board that the .SHP file was ready and could be perused by\nus. We had noted the submission urged on behalf of the Appellant that a\ncopy of the .SHP file relating to Chennai - Tiruvallur GA was made available\nto the 2nd Respondent at their request, and fairness demanded that a copy\nof the .SHP file, for both Chennai - Tiruvallur GA and Kanchipuram GA, be\nmade available to the Appellant also. We had also noted the stand of the\nBoard, during the hearing held on 13.09.2023, that the .SHP file was not\nmade available to the Appellant, since they had not made any such a\nrequest; and it was because the 2nd Respondent had sought a copy thereof,\nthat it was made available to them. We had then observed that, since the\n.shp file with respect to Chennai and Tiruvallur District GA had already been\nmade available to the 2nd Respondent, a copy of the .shp file of 9.61 and\n9.62 be made available to the Appellant, and a copy of the Kanchipuram .shp\nfile be made available to the 2nd Respondent, within one week. It is only\nthereafter that the .shp files of both the GAs were made available to the\nAppellant, and a copy of the .shp file of Kanchipuram District GA was made\navailable to the 2nd Respondent.\n\n111. The submission, urged on behalf of the Board, that the .SHP files were\nmade available at the request of the parties does not merit acceptance, since\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 82 of 184\n\n the Board was obligated to share with the bidders all information relevant for\nsubmission of bids, and since the Board had placed heavy reliance on the\n.SHP files of both the GAs i.e. 9.61 and 9.62, they ought to have been made\navailable to all the bidders along with the ACBD, and should have been\nshared with both the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent.\n\n112. While we are satisfied that the Board ought to have made available the\n.shp file of the respective GAs along with the ACBD itself, that does not mean\nthat we accept the submission of the appellant that the .shp file was not even\nin existence in 2018 when bids were invited. The map vendor was asked to\nsubmit a geo-referenced map, and we have no reason to disbelieve the\nsubmission urged by Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai, learned Counsel for the Board,\nthat it is .shp file submitted by the map vendor which was made available to\nthe appellant (ie for both the GAs) and to the 2nd Respondent (ie for GA 9.61),\nalbeit pursuant to the directions of this Tribunal.\n\n XI. THE .SHP FILES:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n113. Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that, even if the shp file is considered, it also shows\nthat the total population of Kanchipuram GA is specified as 39,98,252; the\narea corresponding to this population as per Census 2011 is the district of\nKanchipuram; as per the impugned order also, the primary obligation of the\nvendor was to provide a map of the geographical area, and thereafter\nprovide population for the area so depicted and not vice--versa; the .shp file\ninter alia contains the names and Code_2011 of the charge areas of the GA;\nthe 'Code_2011' of each of the charge areas corresponds exactly to the\ncodes of the respective talukas as per Census 2011, except that\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 83 of 184\n\n Chengalpattu and Tirupuror have the same code since Chengalpattu was\nbifurcated into two Talukas - Chengalpattu and Tiruporur in the year 2012,\nafter the 2011 Census; the outer boundary which emerges from the Talukas\nis co-terminus with the GA boundary of GA 9.61; the entirety of these\nTalukas, which together comprise the Kancheepuram District, were included\nin the Kanchipuram District GA 9.61; the 2nd Respondent contended that\nthere is a mismatch between the number of talukas and charge area as there\nare 11 charge areas in the authorisation map of GA 9.61 while number of\ntalukas of Kanchipuram District is 10; the afore-stated bifurcation of\nChengalpattu explains this increase from 10 to 11 in para 43(III) of the\nimpugned order; and the population and household figures of the Charge\nAreas as stated in the .shp file add up to 39,98,252 and 10,06,245\nrespectively, which are exactly the corresponding figures in the Census\n2011.\n\n114. With reference to google earth platform, Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned\nSenior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that,\nwithout prejudice to the contention of the Appellant that Google Earth cannot\nbe referred to for the present proceedings, a placing of the pdf authorization\nmap on Google Earth also shows that the pink boundary in the map is a thick\nboundary which, on scale, extends to about 400 metres at several places;\nthus, it cannot be considered to be an accurate depiction of the GAs' extent;\nat the stage of filing the Written Submissions, the 2nd Respondent has\nproduced a map allegedly plotting the Survey of India boundaries of Alandur,\nPallavaram and Sholinganallur Talukas on Google Earth Pro, to show that\nparts of these Talukas fall in GA 9.62; there is no warrant for such a co-\nordinates and Google Earth based exercise (the validity whereof is not\naccepted by the appellant) since as shown above, including on the basis of\n.shp file, that these Talukas fall in GA 9.61; and the sub-district boundaries\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 84 of 184\n\n shown in this map produced by the 2nd Respondent as part of GA 9.62, are\nabsent in the authorization map.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS OF THE 2ND RESPONDENT:\n\n115. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe 2nd Respondent, would submit that a .shp file is a simple, non-topological\nformat for storing the geometric location and attribute information of\ngeographic features; a .shp file depicts a geographic location through\ngeometry and may contain several 'layers'; PNGRB has placed on record\nthe .shp files for GA No. 9.61 and 9.62 before this Tribunal; these .shp files\nhave been used to prepare the map issued with the Bid Document; Geo-\ncoordinates are inherently embedded in the .shp files, unlike other layers\nwhich are added/ imported; any data points/ tables (such as households,\npopulation, names of town etc.) are added/ imported separately and are not\nembedded in the .shp file; they are only indicative and need not necessarily\ncorrespond to the geographic location depicted through geometry; the .shp\nfiles given by the PNGRB match exactly with the GA map and the co-ordinates\ngiven by the PNGRB for GA No. 9.61 and 9.62; the appellant had separately\nadded a 'Survey of India' layer in its presentation, which was not in the .shp\nfiles given by the PNGRB; during the hearing before this Tribunal, the 2nd\nRespondent showed, by way of a presentation, the exact location of the CNG\nstations using the .shp files given by the PNGRB; the result is again the\nsame, all the CNG stations fall in the GA awarded to the 2nd Respondent; the\nmaps showing the location of the 19 CNG stations using the .shp files given\nby the PNGRB are enclosed herewith as ANNEXURE -1; and the 2nd\nRespondent had shown, during its submissions, that some CNG stations in\nparticular are located inside GA 9.62 but are very close (range of around\n100-200 m) to the boundary of GA 9.61.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 85 of 184\n\n 116. The 2nd Respondent claims to have ascertained the geo-coordinates\nof 15 of the 19 CNG stations falling within the 9 Villages, which the Appellant\nclaims are located in the map of Kanchipuram District GA. The 2nd\nRespondent contends that they had ascertained the geo-coordinates of\nthese 15 CNG Stations using a handheld GPS instrument by physically\nvisiting each of the 15 CNG stations. They have furnished details of the co-\nordinates of each of these 15 CNG Stations in the form of a table which reads\nas under:\n\n117. The longitude and latitudes, as reflected in the afore-said table, have\nbeen extrapolated by the 2nd Respondent into the .SHP file and, from the\nvisual presentation made by them during the course of the hearing of this\nAppeal, it does appear that, as a result, these 15 CNG stations fall within the\nGA boundaries of Chennai-Thiruvallur Districts GA. A copy of the relevant\nportion of the said map, as shown by the 2nd Respondent during its visual\npresentation, is as under:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 86 of 184\n\n 118. In the light of the visual presentation made on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, even if we were to accept the Appellant's contention that the\nPNGRB had not undertaken any independent exercise to determine the\nexact location of these 19 CNG stations on the basis of co-ordinates, and\nhad only relied on what the 2nd Respondent had contended, it would only\nrequire us, if we were to hold that it is only the co-ordinates test which is\napplicable and all other parameters should be ignored, to direct the PNGRB\nto undertake the exercise of determining the locations of these 19 CNG\nstations on the basis of the co-ordinates given in the map/.shp file.\n\n119. The clarification given by the Board in January 2020 that it has the\n.SHP files for all the 136 GAs awarded in the 9th and 10th round of bidding\nmatters little, since the .SHP files ought to have been made available to the\nbidders as an Annexure to the ACBD, which was web-hosted on the PNGRB\nportal on 12.04.2018.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 87 of 184\n\n 120. Apart from their contention that no reliance can be placed on co-\nordinates as shown in the .SHP file, the Appellant submits, in the alternative,\nthat the .SHP file has several layers containing the information as recorded\nin the map in Annexure-1. We see no reason to burden this judgement with\nthe voluminous maps filed both on behalf of the appellant and the 2nd\nRespondent. It would, in our view, suffice to take note of one such map of\nKanchipuram District GA, which contains the division of the GA into different\ncharge areas, and also indicates the different layers, of the .SHP file, at the\nextreme left of the said map:\n\n121. Even if we were to ignore the additional layer of \"Survey of India\"\n\nenclosed by the Appellant in its presentation, the fact remains that several\nlayers in the .SHP files, which was pointed out on behalf of the Appellant, do\nalso reflect the villages with population of more than 5000, the area in square\nkilometres, the total number of households in the GA, the total population\netc all of which correspond to the information furnished in the map at\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 88 of 184\n\n Annexure-1 of the ACBD, the effect of which shall be considered later in this\nOrder.\n\n XII. FAILURE OF THE APPELLANT TO SHOW THE EXACT\n LOCATION OF THE CNG STATIONS ON THE PNGRB MAP:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS OF THE 2ND RESPONDENT:\n\n122. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that the exact location of the CNG stations can\nonly be established/ ascertained using co-ordinates - and not on the basis\nof addresses; as an example, if the exact location of this Tribunal is required\nto be ascertained on a map, it can only be done using geo-coordinates\n(latitude and longitude); the official address i.e. 'Core-4, Scope Complex,\nLodhi Road, New Delhi - 110 003' can, at best, give a vague idea of where\nthis Tribunal might be located; in the present case, despite this Tribunal's\norder dated 05.04.2023, the appellant has failed to plot the exact location of\nthe CNG stations on the basis of the co-ordinates given in the map provided\nby PNGRB at the time of bidding; instead, the appellant is causing confusion\nby plotting the CNG stations on the basis of their addresses as per the\nPetroleum & Explosives Safety Organization (PESO); in another instance,\nthe appellant did plot the CNG stations on the basis of co-ordinates - not on\nthe GA map given by PNGRB but on the Survey of India map of Kanchipuram\nduring the hearing before this Tribunal, the appellant had argued that the\nAffidavit dated 25.04.2023 was not controverted by the 2nd Respondent; this\nis irrelevant as the same was not a mandate of the order dated 05.04.2023\npassed by this Tribunal; firstly, it is impossible to exactly \"plot\" the location\nof any point on earth on a map on the basis of \"addresses\" instead of the\nexact \"coordinates\"; Secondly, even otherwise, the objective and jurisdiction\nof PESO is not to verify the location of a CNG station; Thirdly, Survey of\nIndia map has no sanctity for the 9th Round of Bidding, and the only relevant\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 89 of 184\n\n map is the one given by PNGRB on the basis of which bids were submitted\nby the appellant and the 2nd Respondent.\n\n B. ANALYSIS:\n\n123. As noted hereinabove, the visual presentation, made on behalf of the\n2nd Respondent during the course of hearing of this appeal, does show that,\non the .shp files being placed on google earth platform, and if the co-\nordinates (ie the longitude and latitude ) of each of the 15 CNG Stations\n(which the 2nd Respondent claims to have physically ascertained visiting\neach of the 15 CNG Stations and using a hand-held GPS system) were to\nbe accepted, then they do appear to fall within the boundaries of GA 9.62 ie\nChennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA. We have no reason to disagree with the\nsubmission of the Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that the\nSurvey of India Map was irrelevant in the 9th Round of bidding, since the\nBoard had got maps prepared for each GA by awarding work orders to map\nvendors. What we are, however, required to examine (which we shall do so\nlater in this Order) is whether the Co-ordinates test is the only test to be\napplied to the exclusion of all other identification criteria, and whether the\nBoard intended to fix the boundaries of the GAs, for which it intended to invite\nbids, only on the basis of co-ordinates.\n\n XIII. IS APPLICATION OF THE CO-ORDINATES TEST THE ONLY\n WAY OF LOCATING THE CNG STATIONS IN THE\n AUTHORISED GA:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n124. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that the case of the 2nd Respondent is that all of the\nabove factors are liable to be ignored, and one must look at only the\n\"coordinates\" in the authorization maps and read the pink GA boundary in\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 90 of 184\n\n reference thereto, and on that basis alone, determine in which GA do the\nCNG stations in question fall; firstly, such a submission that, one part of a\ndocument should be considered determinative, overlooking all other parts of\nthe document; ignoring the statutory and regulatory background in which the\ndocument is set; and also ignoring the subsequent dealings of the parties\nand their admissions contained therein, is contrary to all canons of\ninterpretation; consistent with this flawed approach, the 2nd Respondent has\nsought to produce a new map with the written submissions, arguing that,\nsince one particular landmark, viz. the state highways, allegedly match in\nthe shp maps of GA 9.61 and GA 9.62, the placing of these maps is correct;\nsuch a map does not further the 2nd Respondents' case; the plotting of CNG\nstations on this map is not accepted by the appellant as correct; there is no\nenquiry with respect to highways involved in the present case; in fact this\nmap contradicts the 2nd Respondent's oral submission that the CNG stations\nin question are along State Highway 107; and the Board having clearly\ndetermined GA 9.61 and GA9.62 as identical with the respective districts,\neven if it is assumed, though not admitted, that any part of the depiction of\nthis decision in the map is inconsistent with the decision, it is at the most a\nbona fide mistake made by the map vendor in the depictive exercise, which\ncannot form the basis of the rights of parties.\n\n B. ANALYSIS:\n\n125. To answer this contention, urged on behalf of the appellant, we must\nfirst ascertain whether the other tests suggested on behalf of the appellant,\n(apart from the co-ordinates test) merit acceptance, and whether the Board\nintended to prescribe any such test to identify the boundaries of the GAs for\nwhich it intended to invite applications for the 9th round of bidding.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 91 of 184\n\n 126. Let us now consider the factors which the appellant seeks to place\nreliance upon in support of their submission that all these 19 CNG Stations\nare in fact located within GA.9.61 ie Kanchipuram District GA.\n\n XIV. RELEVANCE OF CHARGE AREAS:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n127. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that, while the 2nd Respondent has contended that\nthe charge Areas are not relevant at the stage of bidding, this submission is\nclearly unfounded as shown by (i) regulatory determination made during the\n5th CGD Bidding Round; (ii) Cl. 2.1.2 of ACBD; Sch. C; and for the reason\nthat the Charge Areas are the building blocks of a GA; this argument was\nevidently taken since the Charge Areas of the respective GAs are clearly\nidentical with the Talukas of the corresponding Districts, and it is not even\nthe case of the Respondents that there are any co-ordinates of the Talukas\nin the map issued with the ACBD and/ or authorization.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n128. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that the appellant has placed emphasis on the\nconcept of 'charge areas' to argue that 'charge areas' are nothing but\n'talukas' of a district; 'Charge areas' are not defined anywhere either in the\n\nPNGRB Act\n, the Authorization Regulations or in the Bid Document; it is also\nnot a bidding criteria for bidders under \nRegulation 7\n; it is, however,\ncommonly understood that charge areas are such areas in the authorized\narea that a bidder is required to reach to meet the demands of the\nconsumers; the concept of charge areas is to ensure holistic/ equitable\ndevelopment of the entire GA and they are merely a sub-set of the GA; under\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 92 of 184\n\n the Authorization Regulations, the first step is to define the GA based on the\ncriteria given in Schedule A; it is only thereafter that the charge areas are fixed\nwithin the boundary limits of the GA already decided; in other words, a GA is\nlike a cake which is prepared first and 'charge areas' are like slices of that\ncake which can be cut only after the cake is prepared; it cannot be the other\nway around; in fact, in GA No. 9.61 itself, the charge areas do not match with\nthe talukas of Kanchipuram; as per the District Census Handbook of 2011,\nKanchipuram had 10 talukas (Sriperumbudur, Tambaram, Alandur,\nSholinganallur, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Uthiramerur,\nTirukalukundram, Maduranthakam and Cheyyur); however, there are 11\ncharge areas in the map of GA No. 9.61; similarly, the charge areas of GA\nNo. 9.62 also do not match with the talukas of Tiruvallur District; there are 9\ntalukas in Tiruvallur as per the District Census Handbook of 2011\n(Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukkottai, Tiruttani, Pallipattu, Thiruvallur.\nPoonamallee, Ambattur, Mathavaram) whereas there are 10 charge areas\nof Tiruvallur as per the GA map; in fact, in the map of GA No. 9.62, whole of\nChennai has been shown as one charge area i.e. CA-01, even though\nChennai District had 10 talukas existing since 2013; the appellant has also\nrelied upon the response dated 07.04.2015 to the clarifications sought during\nthe 5th Bidding Round to argue that charge areas are demarcated based on\ntehsils/ mandals/ talukas etc; this is wholly irrelevant as the clarifications\napplicable to the 5th Bidding Round in 2015 cannot be applied to the 9th\nBidding Round of 2018.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n129. As noted hereinabove, Clause 1.1.2 of the ACBD states that the\ncharge areas are also depicted in the map; if the bidding entity is finally\ngranted authorization, the entity shall be required to reach the charge areas\nas stipulated in the 2008 Regulations. Similarly, Annexure 1 of the ACBD, ie\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 93 of 184\n\n the map depicting the geographical area and charge area, directs bidders to\ncarefully study the geographical area and the charge areas before submitting\nthe bid.\n\n130. Since the ACBD emphasises on the importance of charge areas, and\nAnnexure-1 thereto requires the bidders to consider both the Geographical\nArea and the charge areas, we must express our inability to agree with the\nsubmission that the charge areas are irrelevant. As the sum total of the area\nin sq.km of each of these talukas is equivalent to the total area in sq.km of\nthe then Kanchipuram District, it is evident that each of the charge areas\ndepicted in the Kanchipuram District GA map ie GA 9.61 is equivalent to the\ntalukas of the then Kanchipuram District (ie prior to GO dated 04.01.2018),\nor in other words the Kanchipuram District as was taken into consideration\nby the PNGRB while inviting bids for the 9th round of bidding.\n\n131. As shall be detailed later in this order, while it was always open to the\nBoard to fix all charge areas, other than as the Talukas of a District, the map\nin Annexure-1 of Kanchipuram District GA does appear to show that the\ncharge areas were taken to be the Talukas of the then Kanchipuram District.\nIt is no doubt true, as is submitted on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, that, in\nterms of the 2011 Census Handbook, Kanchipuram District had 10 Talukas\nIt is because Chengalpattu Taluka was subdivided, after the 2011 Census,\ninto two Talukas in the year 2012, ie into Chengalpattu and Tiruporur talukas,\nand as the map was evidently prepared on the basis of the Kanchipuram\nDistrict as it existed prior to GO dated 04.01.2018, that the total number of\nTalukas are shown in the map in Annexure-1 of GA 9.61 as 11. We had no\noccasion to consider the talukas of Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts, nor was it\neven argued during the course of oral hearing, in as much as the appellant\nmakes no claim over any part of the then Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts, and\nit is the 2nd Respondent which claims that a part of the then Kanchipuram\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 94 of 184\n\n District falls within the boundaries of their GA ie Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts\nGA (ie GA 9.62).\n\n132. Unlike with respect to the Geographical area, the map in Annexure-1\nof the ACBD does not record the co-ordinates of each of the Talukas. Taking\ninto consideration the fact that the area in sq km of each of the talukas, the\npopulation of each of the talukas and the number of households in each of\nthese talukas (as recorded in the 2011 Census Handbook), when clubbed\ntogether, represent the area in sq.km, the population and the number of\nhouseholds of the then Kanchipuram District, and is reflected on the right\nside of the map in Annexure-1 as the area in sq.km, the population and the\nnumber of households of Kanchipuram District GA, it does appear that the\ndemarcated charge areas in the said map correspond to the Talukas of the\nthen Kanchipuram district, and no part of any of these charge areas\n(Talukas) in Kanchipuram GA are shown in the GA map of 9.62 ie Chennai\n& Tiruvallur Districts GA.\n\n XVI. RELEVANCE OF THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES REFERRED\n IN THE MAP:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT:\n\n133. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that (a) Towns/ Villages - within the image part of\nthe authorization maps, the important towns and villages have been marked;\nwithin the GA boundary of the authorisation map of GA 9.61, towns\nParaniputhur; Nandanvakkam; Meenabakkam; St. Thomas Mount-cum-\nPallavaram; Alandur; Kottivakkam; Neelankarai; Pallikaranai; and\nMadippakkam, where 15 of the 19 CNG stations, in respect of which the\ncomplaint was filed are admittedly located, have been specifically named\nand marked; none of these towns are marked in the map of GA 9.62; (The\nremaining 4 CNG Stations are located in villages with a population less than\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 95 of 184\n\n 5,000 as per Census 2011, which are not marked in either of the maps but\nare admittedly part of GA 9.61); the Towns of Kanchipuram District, as per\nCensus 2011. form part of attribute data as also the boundary data of the\nshp file of GA 9.61; their population is also mentioned which matches their\npopulation as per Census 2011; these towns have thus been included in the\nKanchipuram District GA 9.61 as per .shp file by name in the attribute data,\nby being pictorially depicted within the GA; and by their entire population\nbeing included in the attribute data; this also includes the towns mentioned\nabove, where 15 of the 19 CNG stations are located; and all the villages with\npopulation 5,000 or more (total 38 in number) of Kanchipuram District as per\nCensus 2011 form part of attribute data of the .shp file of GA 9.61, with their\nentire population included.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS OF THE 2ND RESPONDENT:\n\n134. With respect to the appellant's claim that the disputed 19 CNG stations\nfall within GA No. 9.61 as the official address of the said stations is in the\nvillages/ towns shown (as 'dots'/ points) in the PNGRB map/ .shp file given\nby the PNGRB, Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf\nof the 2nd Respondent, would submit that any claims over the GA awarded to\nthe 2nd Respondent, merely on the basis of names of villages/ towns, is not\ncorrect as the nomenclature cannot prevail over the geo-coordinates that\ngive precise contours of the GA boundary; the instant dispute is not whether\nthe GA boundary has been properly determined or not; but a commercial\ndispute concerning the location of certain CNG stations; further, the villages/\ntowns shown in the appellant's map are not location points/ coordinates;\nthese villages/ towns run into several kilometres; as examples, Alandur is\naround 19.50 sq. kms and Pallavaram is about 12.92 sq. kms and spread\ninto GA No. 9.62 even though they are shown by way of 'dots'/ points in GA\n9.61 map; significantly, even as per the appellant , Alandur is about 26 sq.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 96 of 184\n\n km; in any event, as per the appellant's own Detailed Feasibility Report\n(DFR), a part of Alandur is in the Chennai District; in response to a query\nfrom this Tribunal as to whether Alandur, Sholinganallur and any other areas\nspread over both GA Nos. 9.61 as well as 9.62, the 2nd Respondent is\nplacing on record a map demonstrating that these areas indeed spread over\nboth GAs; the said map is enclosed as ANNEXURE - 2; therefore, even if a\nCNG station has its official address in a village shown to be on the\nappellant's map, it does not necessarily mean that the location/ geo-\ncoordinates of the CNG station will also always fall within the GA awarded\nto the appellant.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n135. The 2nd Respondent, in its letter addressed to the Appellant on\n22.02.2022, has itself stated that, according to them, a part of Kanchipuram\nDistrict fell within GA No. 9.62 ie Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA. The map\nin Annexure 1 with respect to each of these GAs contains various details,\none among which is the name of the villages whose population is 5000 or\nmore. 15 of these 19 CNG stations fall in 9 villages, with a population of 5000\nand more, in the then Kanchipuram District. The location of these 9 villages\nhave been referred to and identified in the map in Annexure 1 to fall within\nGA No. 9.61 ie Kanchipuram District GA.\n\n136. If, as is now contended before us, a part of Alandur and Pallavaram\nvillages also fall within GA 9.62, and that was the intention of the Board, then\nthe GA 9.62 (Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA) map should have reflected the\nnames of these villages, since it is not in dispute that the population of these\nvillages exceed 5000 in number. The very fact that all these 9 villages/towns\nare reflected only in the physical map of GA 9.61 ie Kanchipuram District GA\ndoes lend support to the appellant's submission that the subject 19 CNG\nStations fall within Kanchipuram District GA ie GA 9.61.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 97 of 184\n\n XVII. GA AND DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES SHOWN IN THE MAP:\n\n A. SUBMISSION OF THE APPELLANT:\n\n137. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit, with respect to the boundary line, that the\nauthorisation maps show the GA boundary in dotted pink line and district\nboundary with solid black line; this, besides being evident from a bare\nperusal of the authorization maps, is also the admitted position of the Board\n(in the impugned order - para 46); a bare perusal of the authorization maps\nalso shows that these boundaries completely overlap each other in both the\nmaps, further establishing the identity of the GA and the respective districts;\neven as per the .shp file, the GA boundary is co-terminus with the District\nboundary as considered by PNGRB both for Kanchipuram District GA 9.61\nand Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts GA 9.62; in the .shp file also, there is no\noverlap between the Kanchipuram District and GA of Chennai & Tiruvallur,\nshowing that no part of Kanchipuram District was, or was intended to be,\nincluded in GA 9.62.\n\n138. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that the 2nd Respondent has\ntaken inconsistent stands with respect to the depiction of the boundary; on\nthe one hand it is contended that the only relevant boundary is the GA\nboundary indicated in pink and \"the district boundary indicated in 'black' has\nno relevance whatsoever\"; on the other hand, it has sought to treat the black\ndistrict boundary line as sacrosanct, and argued that, since the authorization\nmap shows a 'hump' area, below the 'black district boundary' of Chennai, as\nincluded in GA 9.62, a part of Kanchipuram must be held to have been\nincluded in GA 9.62; however, as has been borne out from the record, no\npart of Kanchipuram ever came to be included in GA 9.62; in fact, while it\nhas been the stand of the Board as well as the 2nd Respondent, taken orally\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 98 of 184\n\n for the first time before this Tribunal, that the hump portion in GA 9.62 has\nbeen carved out of Kanchipuram District and given to the 2nd Respondent,\nthis contention is without any basis nor is there even a whisper, in the\npleadings of the 2nd Respondent before the PNGRB or in the pleadings/\nAffidavits filed by the 2nd Respondent and PNGRB before this Tribunal, and/\nor in the record of the Board produced before the court.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS OF THE 2ND RESPONDENT:\n\n139. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that, as part of the 9th Bidding Round, PNGRB\nsupplied a geo-referenced map with every GA as part of the tender document\nitself; in contrast, in the 11th Bidding Round, the PNGRB did not supply a\nmap for the GAs to be authorized; unlike the 9th bidding round which was a\n'map' round, PNGRB did not supply a map for the GAs to be authorised under\nthe 11th bidding round ('no-map' round); this is evident from Clause 1.1 of the\nBid Document for the 11th bidding round: (a) Firstly, as part of Annexure-1 of\nthe Bid Document, only charge areas within the GA were given (Clause\n1.1.1); (b) Secondly, it was also provided that the district boundary of the GA\nshall be as defined by the respective local authority, such as district\nadministration. While it was further provided that the bidders may procure\nthe maps for identification of district and charge areas boundaries from\nSurvey of India, PNGRB made it clear that the boundary \"should be duly\nvetted by district administration for correctness on ground\" (Clause 1.1.2), (c)\nThirdly, PNGRB also made it clear that it \"shall have no role in defining the\nboundary, except the nomenclature of that particular district and charge\nareas falling in the GA\" (Clause 1.1.2), (d) Fourthly, as part of Annexure-1\n(Charge Areas of the GA) read with the Corrigendum issued by PNGRB on\n18.11.2021, PNGRB clarified that in case any charge area had been merged/\nbifurcated/ renamed, then the charge area and name as on the date of\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 99 of 184\n\n advertisement shall prevail; (e ) On 14.02.2022, Schedule-D of the\nRegulation was amended and it was inserted that the authorized area \"for\nlaying, building, operating or expanding the proposed CGD network shall\ncover the following Charge Areas, as depicted in indicative and not to scale\ndrawing or map...\". The authorization given to the successful bidders of the\n11th Bidding Round also specifically states the name of the district and the\ncharge area; (f) reference may also be made to the outline of charge areas\nsupplied with a sample authorizations for the 11th Bidding Round, and the\nsaid outline states that it is \"indicative, non GIS and not to scale\"; in\nconclusion, the terms of the 11th CGD Bidding Round were completely\ndifferent; if the contention of the appellant were to be accepted, there would\nbe no difference between the terms of 9th and 11th Bidding Rounds; it is also\nevident that, whenever PNGRB decided to invite bids on the basis of the\ndistrict boundary, it clearly mentioned the same; PNGRB also made it clear\nthat the boundary of the GA based on district shall be that which is prevalent\nas on the date of the bid, and not based on the last Census data i.e. 2011;\nand thus, even under the district approach, the boundary to be relied upon\nwas the one as on the date of bidding.\n\n140. On the contention of the appellant that the GA boundary indicated in\n'pink' and the district boundary in 'black' overlap, and this shows that the\nGA and district boundaries are the same, Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior\nCounsel. would submit that, Firstly the 'district' boundary/ 'black line' is\nwholly irrelevant for the 9th Round; GA boundary/ 'pink line' is the only\nrelevant consideration; if the appellant's contention is accepted, it will cause\nchaos and uncertainty as the GA map given by PNGRB will have no\nsanctity; Secondly, PNGRB has itself admitted before this Tribunal that\nthere was an error in depicting the district by way of the 'black' line; Thirdly,\nwithout prejudice to the above, 'district' boundary does not necessarily mean\nthe entire district in all cases; it only means that part of the district which\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 100 of 184\n\n has been awarded as part of the GA in question; there are several\ninstances in the 9th Bidding Round itself where PNGRB has used the 'black'\nline to indicate even 'part' districts:\n\n Name of GA Submissions\n Navsari (Except Area\n a. Only a part of Surat district is part of\n Already Authorised), Surat\n GA of 9.10.\n (Except Area Already\n b. However, the 'black' line can still be\n Authorised) & Tapi (Except\n seen all along (Map is at Pg. 100 of\n Area Already Authorised) &\n R- 3).\n Dang District (GA 9.10)\n a. Only a part of Valsad district is included\n as part of GA 9.39.\n Valsad (Except Area\n b. However, the end of the boundary of GA\n Already Authorised), Dhule\n contains indicates the 'black' line as the\n & Nashik Districts (GA 9.39)\n district boundary. This further shows that\n the district boundary indicated in 'black'\n has no relevance\n (Map is at Pg. 101 of R- 3).\n a. GA 9.83 includes a part of (but not the\n entire) Sambhal and Amroha districts.\n This is evident from the fact that\n Moradabad (Except 'Chandausi' - which forms a part of\n Area Already Sambhal district - is specifically included\n\n Authorised) District+ the in the map for GA No. 9.83. A 'black' line\n area granted under indicating the district boundary is also\n \nRegulation 18\n. (GA 9.83) given in the map.\n\n b. Sambhal district (except the area\n already awarded as part of GA No. 9.83)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 101 of 184\n\n was subsequently awarded as part of the\n 11th Bidding\n Round (Map is at Pg. 99 of R- 3).\n\n141. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel, would further ,submit that the\nappellant, in its oral submissions, placed reliance on the .shp file given by\nthe PNGRB to argue that the GA boundary and district boundary coalesce\nfor GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62, and \"depiction of district boundary of\nKanchipuram District in the .shp file is not correct, as it is inconsistent with the\nSurvey of India Boundary\"; the appellant has, thus, acknowledged that\n'district' layer in the . shp file given by t h e PNGRB does not match with\nthe administrative district boundary as per Survey of India; this substantiates\nthe 2nd Respondent's case and establishes beyond doubt that PNGRB has\nnot awarded GAs on the basis of 'district' concept; this further shows that the\nappellant is wrong in using the Survey of India map to plot the CNG stations\non the basis of coordinates, when it was specifically directed by this Tribunal,\nvide order dated 05.04.2023, to enclose maps drawn on the basis of the\nPNGRB maps which refer to the co-ordinates; the appellant deliberately did\nnot comply with this order as it would have shown that all 19 CNG stations\nfall in the GA awarded to the 2nd Respondent..\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n142. In para 46 of the impugned order, the Board has stated that the GIS\nmap for GA 9.62 clearly demarcate the GA boundaries with a pink line and\nthe District boundary with a black line. A perusal of the map of GA 9.61 also\nshows that, while the GA boundaries are recorded in the form of a pink line,\nthe District boundaries are recorded in the form of a black line, both of which\noverlap, necessitating the conclusion that the boundaries of Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA 9.61 is the same as the boundaries of the then Kanchipuram\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 102 of 184\n\n District. We find force in the submission, urged on behalf of the Appellant,\nthat a perusal of the authorised map does show that the GA boundary in pink\noverlaps the District boundary line in black of both GAs 9.61 and 9.62.\n\n143. It is unnecessary for us to examine what the Board did in the 11th\nbidding round, since the present dispute relates to the 9th bidding round.\nWhile a copy of the map of every GA was enclosed along with the ACBD in\nthe 9th bidding round, the maps could only have been prepared on the basis\nof what the Board had identified as the GA for which bids were to be invited.\nIt is not in dispute that the map does contain the co-ordinates of GA 9.61. As\nshall be elaborated later in this Order, there is nothing on the record to show\nthat the Board intended to identify the GA boundaries on the basis of co-\nordinates alone. On the contrary, the material on record does show that the\nBoard had intended, in so far as GAs 9.61 and 9.62 were concerned, to treat\nthese GAs as co-terminus with the then Kanchipuram District and the then\nChennai-Tiruvallur Districts respectively.\n\n144. We see no reason to undertake an exercise of examining the terms\nand conditions of the 11th bidding round since the present case is confined\nonly to the 9th bidding round, that too with respect to the authorised entities\nof GAs 9.61 and 9.62. Suffice it to observe that, since we have refused to\nexamine the appellant's contention regarding non-existence of co-ordinates\nin the map as it is contrary to the pleadings on record, we must express our\ninability to also examine the 2nd Respondent's contentions regarding the\nhump part of Kanchipuram District falling within their GA, as it is neither\nsupported by pleadings both before the PNGRB and later before this\nTribunal, nor is there a reference to any such hump in the impugned order.\n\n145. Except to state that the black line in the map is irrelevant, no reasons\nare forthcoming for the 2nd Respondent's conclusion regarding its\nirrelevance. The submissions made by the Counsel for the Board, during\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 103 of 184\n\n the course of hearing of the present appeal, cannot be treated as the\nsubmission made by the Board, in the absence of any affidavit being placed\nby the Board in this regard. If the black line shown in the map is erroneous,\nas is now claimed, the Board was then duty bound to explain as to when it\ncame to know of the error and as to how such an error had occured. The\nBoard was then obligated to explain as to where the district boundaries are\nreflected. This submission, of the black line being in error, appears to have\nbeen made only to sustain the impugned judgement, that too by the\ncounsel for the Board, and not by the Board itself. The submission that the\nDistrict boundary does not mean the entire District, and refers to only that\npart which falls within the GA, is only to be noted to be rejected, for If that\nwere to be so, then providing for the District boundary was wholly\nunnecessary.\n\n146. \nIn \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, the Supreme Court held that the Tribunal was\napproached only with respect to GAs 51, 61 and 62, (ie GAs 9.51, 9.61 and\n9.62), the Board's treatment of other GAs could not be decisive in\ndetermining the legality of the authorisation granted in GAs 51, 61 and 62,\nespecially where the Board's actions in respect of the other GAs had not\nbeen independently challenged; and to decide the sole question in the said\nappeal, the presence and hearing of other bidders was not necessary.\nReference to other GAs, by the counsel for the 2nd Respondent, is wholly\nextraneous to the present lis, and it would be inappropriate for us, in light of\nthe judgement of the Supreme Court in Adani Gas. to take note of GAs\nwhich do not form part of the dispute in the present appeal.\n\n XVIII. DOES THE NAME OF THE GA INDICATE THAT THE GAs\n WERE CARVED OUT ON THE BASIS OF DISTRICTS:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 104 of 184\n\n 147. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit, with respect to the name of the GA, that the names\nof the GAs in question also show that they correspond to the entirety of their\nrespective districts with no area being excluded from the entire district as\npart of the authorization; the only reasonable interpretation of the\nauthorisations, issued to the appellant and the 2nd Respondent, is that they\nwere issued for the respective districts; they comprise of the Talukas of the\nrespective Districts with GA 9.61 including the three Talukas where the CNG\nstations in question are located; and the respective GAs including the towns\nand villages of the corresponding districts, and in particular, GA 9.61\nincluding the towns where the CNG stations in question are admittedly\nlocated.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE PNGRB:\n\n148. On the issue of naming of GAs, Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai, Learned\nCounsel for the PNGRB, would submit that reliance was also placed on the\nfact that the instant GA was named \"Kanchipuram District GA\" in the\nauthorization and other places, and therefore the entire district should be\nconsidered as the GA based on the name; this argument is also wrong and.\nin fact, is contrary to the Appellant's own stand in the Draft Feasibility Report\n(\"DFR\"); in the DFR submitted by them, the Appellant mentioned that parts\nof Chennai were also part of its GA, however, for the purpose of \"study\nregion\", it is referring to the same as Kanchipuram District GA; at page 348,\nthe DFR states that \"for all intent and purposes, the study region in the report\nis referred to as \"Kancheepuram District GA\"; accordingly, the name used by\nPNGRB and by entities, including the Appellant, were only for reference\npurposes and cannot be used to determine the boundary; the appellant was\nconfusing two entirely different concepts: the GA boundary and the district\nboundary serve completely different purposes; the demarcation of the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 105 of 184\n\n boundary of a district is at the discretion of the Central/ State Government,\nand may undergo change with time for better administration as and when\nthe change is notified; on the other hand, the GA boundary is sacrosanct and\ncannot be altered post the bid; the Impugned Judgment also stated that the\nAppellant had placed a lot of emphasis on the Survey of India digital maps,\nand other maps obtained from local authorities, in support of its complaint;\nhowever, PNGRB observed that, until the 10th CGD Bidding Round, the GAs\nauthorized by PNGRB had always been accompanied by the map with geo-\ncoordinates forming part of the authorization letter; the concept of referring\nto the maps of Survey of India has been introduced only from the 11th CGD\nBidding Round; in the 11th CGD Bidding Round, the bid document did not\ninclude the map of the GA which was proposed to be awarded; and,. instead,\nPNGRB asked the bidders to procure the maps for identification of district\nand charge area boundaries from the Survey of India.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n149. We see no reason to delve into the contentions under this head, since\nthe other details referred to hereinabove do appear to support the appellant's\ncontention that the Board intended to carve out GA 9.61 and 9.62 in terms\nof the then existing Kanchipuram District and Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts.\nThe villages with population of over 5000, where 15 of the CNG Stations\nhave been set up, have all be identified as being located in the GA 9.61 map,\nand fall within the Talukas which constitute the charge areas of Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA. As the appellant has not even contended before us that any part\nof Chennai District falls within Kanchipuram District GA, we see no reason\nto examine the contents of the draft feasibility report to ascertain whether\nsuch a claim had been put forth, on behalf of the Appellant, therein. While\nthe purposes which the GA boundary and the District boundary serve may\nnot be the same, that does not mean that the GA boundary can, in no case,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 106 of 184\n\n be the same as the District boundary. As shall be elaborated later in this\nOrder, the material on record does not show that the Board intended to\nidentify the boundaries of these two GAs on the basis of co-ordinates, as all\nother factors lend support to the appellant's submission that these two GAs\nwere intended to be identified on the basis of the boundaries of their\nrespective Districts.\n\n150. The financial criteria specified in \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n, and the\nrequirement of furnishing a bid bond, in the form of Bank Guarantee or\ndemand draft or pay order, under \nRegulation 5(6)(h)\n of the 2008\nRegulations, both refer to the 2011 Census. \nRegulation 5\n of the 2008\nRegulations relates to the criteria for selection of entity for expression of\ninterest route. \nRegulation 5(6)\n requires the Board to scrutinize the bids\nreceived in response to the advertisement in respect of only those entities\nwhich fulfill the following minimum eligibility criteria, namely, among others,\n\n(e) the entity has adequate financial strength to execute the proposed\nproject, operate and maintain the same in the authorized area and shall\nmeet the following financial criterion to qualify for bidding for a single CGD\nnetwork, namely:-\n\n Population in the Minimum net worth of the bidder\n geographical entity\n area [as per latest census\n of India]\n (1) (2)\n 5 million or more Rs.1,500 million for a population of 5\n million, plus additional Rs. 300\n million for each 1 million of\n population or part thereof, in excess\n of 5 million (refer Note - 3)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 107 of 184\n\n 2 million or more but less Rs.1,000 million\n than 5 million\n 1 million or more but less Rs. 750 million\n than 2 million\n\n 0.5 million or more but less Rs.500 million\n than 1 million\n 0.25 million or more but Rs.250 million\n less than 0.50 million\n 0.1 million or more but less Rs.100 million\n than 0.25 million\n Less than 0.1 million Rs.50 million\n Note - 1 The above minimum net-worth is applicable in case the\n bidder entity bids for a single geographical area in a particular\n bidding round.\n\n Note - 2 In case a bidder entity bids for more than one\n geographical area, then, the minimum net-worth requirement\n shall be calculated by considering 100% of minimum net-worth\n required for the bidded geographical area having the highest\n population, plus 20% of minimum net-worth required for each of\n the other geographical areas. For example, if a bidder has bidded\n for four geographical areas namely A, B,C and D and out of these\n four geographical areas, C has the highest population, then\n minimum net-worth requirement shall be calculated as minimum\n net-worth requirement of C plus 20% of minimum net-worth\n requirements for A, B and D each.\n\n Note - 3 For example, if the population is 8.4 million, then the\n minimum net-worth required shall be Rs. 2,700 million (i.e. Rs.\n 1,500 million for initial 5 million of population, plus Rs. 1,200\n million for 3.4 million of population in excess of 5 million).\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 108 of 184\n\n (i) Net-worth of a bidder entity shall be computed as per Schedule-K.\n\n151. \nRegulation 5(6)(h)\n requires the entity to furnish a bid bond, in the form\nof Bank Guarantee or demand draft or pay order from any scheduled bank\ndrawn in favour of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board\npayable at New Delhi] for an amount equal to- (i) rupees fifty million for a\npopulation of five million and proportionately higher amount for population\nof more than five million; (ii) rupees thirty million for a population of one\nmillion and more but less than five million; (iii) rupees twenty million for a\npopulation of half a million and more but less than one million; (iv) rupees\nfifteen million for a population of quarter of a million and more but less than\nhalf a million; (v) rupees ten million for a population of one-tenth of a million\nand more but less than quarter of a million; and (vi) rupees five million for a\npopulation less than one-tenth of a million.\n\n152. While the purposes served by both \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n and \n5(6)(h)\n of\nthe 2008 Regulations may well be to assess the financial strength of the\napplicant entity, and to quantify the bid bond amount to be submitted by\nthem, it is relevant to note that both these requirements are based on the\npopulation of the Geographical area as per the last census ie the 2011\nCensus. Assessment of financial strength and quantification of the bid bond\nis confined to the population of the geographical area for which the bid has\nbeen submitted, and not beyond. Consequently, population of the\nGeographical area is an indicator of the boundaries of the GA, for it is only\nwithin the GA can the successful bidder operate on its being authorised by\nthe Board to do so. As noted hereinabove, the Survey of India map is of no\nconsequence, nor is the conditions stipulated in the 11th round of bidding of\nany relevance, to the present lis.\n\n153. Suffice it for us to hold that, accepting the submission urged on behalf\nof the second Respondent that it is only the GA co-ordinates of each of these\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 109 of 184\n\n sub-stations which are required to be taken into consideration, would require\nus to ignore every other detail referred to in the map in Annexure 1. It is not\nthe nomenclature of the villages alone which is being taken note of, but\nvarious other information reflected in the maps of these two Gas which have\nbeen considered. Such information appears to support the appellant's\nsubmission that GA 9.61, ie Kanchipuram District GA, is co-terminus with\nKanchipuram District as it existed just prior to GO dated 04.01.2018.\n\n154. It is evident, from what has been stated hereinabove, that, while\napplication of the co-ordinates test may result in the 19 CNG Stations being\nheld to fall within GA 9.62 ie Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts GA, all other\nfactors indicate that the boundary of Kanchipuram District GA is co-terminus\nwith the boundary of the then Kanchipuram District. As it is even the 2nd\nRespondent's case that all these 19 CNG Stations fell within the then\nKanchipuram District, these CNG Stations must then be held to fall within\nKanchipuram District GA.\n\n155. The only manner in which this issue can be resolved is to ascertain\nwhat the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations required of the Board\nregarding determination of the GA, and what the PNGRB intended to specify\nas the GA and its boundaries. As shall be elaborated later in this Order,\n\nSection 19\n of the PNGRB Act read with \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n and\nSchedule A of the 2008 Regulations obligate the Board to clearly identify the\nboundaries of the GA for which bids are to be invited.\n\n XIX. IS THE AUTHORIZATION A STATUTORY CONTRACT\n BETWEEN THE PARTIES?\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n156. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that the authorization issued for GA 9.61 to the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 110 of 184\n\n appellant is and that issued to the 2nd Respondent for GA 9.62 are statutory\ncontracts, between the respective entities and PNGRB, which fall for\ninterpretation in light of the entire statutory and regulatory background, and\nhave the following features: (a) the authorisation issued to the 2nd\nRespondent states that it has been issued for laying a CGD network \"in the\nChennai and Tiruvallur Districts in the State of Tamil Nadu\", and the\nauthorisation issued to the appellant states that it has been issued for the\nKanchipuram Districts in the State of Tamil Nadu\"; (b) Area - the\nauthorization of the 2nd Respondent states that the authorised Area shall\ncover an area of 3569.00 sq km; it is the same area which is mentioned in\nthe map annexed to the authorization; this is also the exact area of GA 9.62\nas per the work order issued to the map vendor [p. 197 at 193/File-3]; this\narea is the sum of the areas of Chennai (175 sq km) and Tiruvallur (3394 sq\nkm) Districts as per Census 2011 [pp. 2, 36, 38/C5]; a detailed break-up of\nthe areas of Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts, in terms of Talukas, show that\nthe total area exactly matches the sum of the areas of the Talukas of the\nDistricts as per Census 2011; it was specifically contended, by the appellant\nbefore the Board, that this total area would stand enhanced if the 2nd\nRespondent's contention is accepted; in response, the 2nd Respondent did\nnot dispute this, but argued that it is possible that the GA area number may\nbe more or less; during the course of oral arguments, on a specific query\nbeing put by the Bench, it was admitted by the 8iuik9o0Learned Counsel for\nthe 2nd Respondent that the said figure of \"3569.00 sq km\" is \"incorrect\" (i.e.,\nit is inconsistent with the 2nd Respondent's case); with respect to the\nappellant, the area mentioned in the authorisation map is 4483 sq km, which\nis also the area of Kanchipuram District as per Census 2011; it is the detailed\nbreak-up of the sum of the areas of the Talukas of Kanchipuram District as\nper Census 2011; it also matches the area communicated to the map vendor\n[p. 197 at 193/File-3]; and this was reiterated by the Board vide letter dated\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 111 of 184\n\n 31.01.2022; had any area from Kanchipuram District been carved out of GA\n9.61, the area of GA 9.61 would have stood reduced from 4483 sq.km (c)\nPopulation - the authorisation maps also mention the population of the\nrespective GAs' which exactly match the population of the respective\ndistricts as per Census 2011; and the detailed break-up of the population\ninto Talukas also shows that the sum of population of the Talukas of the\nrespective districts exactly match the population of the GA specified in the\nauthorisation map; vide addendum dated 21.06.2018, it was declared by\nPNGRB that, for population, the data given in tender documents and\nsubsequent corrigendum and addendum shall be final and binding; this\naddendum was duly signed by all parties including the 2nd Respondent, and\nwas submitted as part of the bid document; the population \"of the\nGeographical Area\" as per Census 2011 is crucial for determination of\neligibility as also grant of authorization (Reg 5(6)(e) and Reg 9); the 2nd\nRespondent, evidently, submitted a bid bond of Rs. 8,37,48,360, which is\nexactly ten times the population of Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts as per\nCensus 2011; thus, the population data is final and binding on the parties;\nthis also shows that no part of the Kanchipuram District has been included\nin GA 9.62; (d) Households - similarly, the authorization maps contain the\nnumber of households of each of the GAs which exactly match the number\nof households in the respective districts; household numbers are indicated,\nsince the number of PNG connections form a significant part of the bid, with\nweightage of 50%. (Reg. 7(1)(a)); the number of PNG connections that a\nbidder may offer to connect is a direct function of the number of households\nin the GA; in the present case, when the reasonability of the bids for PNG\nconnections by the appellant for GA 9.61 and the 2nd Respondent for GA\n9.62 came into question, the Board assessed reasonability of the bids for the\nrespective GAs by considering the household numbers for the respective\n'districts' as per Census 2011, projecting them to the year 2026 by which the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 112 of 184\n\n PNG target is to be completed (considering the authorisation year as 2018)\nand then comparing the figures; the validity of the Board's decision was\nupheld by the Supreme Court in Adani Gas Limited v. PNGRB & Ors.,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529; the prime question before the Court in that case was that,\nfor the purpose of judging reasonability of the bids, which data is to be\nconsidered, i.e., what would be the nature of data, of which date, and of\nwhich geographical unit; the Court considered the above Board agenda note\ndated 28.08.2018; the Board also clearly submitted before the Court that it\nhad made the calculations as per basic data sheet of the 'respective districts\nof the GA' according to the latest census data; in fact, in Civil Appeal No.\n3289 and 2019 which was filed by the 2nd Respondent before the Supreme\nCourt, it stated that \"as per the Census of 2011, the number of households\nexisting in the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur was 21,01,931\", which was the\ncombined number of households for Chennai and Tiruvallur districts as per\nCensus 2011; none of the parties, including the 2nd Respondent, contended\nthat the data to be used for ascertaining reasonability of the bids was to be\nnot of the district, but of a different area, to be ascertained on the basis of\nco-ordinates; a bare reading of the judgment of the Supreme Court shows\nthat all parties proceeded on the assumption that the respective GAs were\nidentical to the corresponding districts; this exercise conducted by the Board\nand sustained by it before the Supreme Court, constitutes a clear admission\non the part of the Board that the respective GAs are co-extensive with the\ncorresponding Districts; the 2nd Respondent did not seek any correction in\nthe said household numbers, and is now bound by the said figures in the\nmap; in the same round, in respect of GA-72, upon part of a district being\ncarved out of the district, PNGRB reduced the number of households; the\n2nd Respondent had objected to the extent of reduction; and it was held by\nPNGRB that the 2nd Respondent was bound by the data given in the ACBD\nsince the finality and binding nature of the data was accepted by all bidders\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 113 of 184\n\n by signing the addendum dated 21.06.2018; this clearly establishes the\nrelevance and binding nature of the household data stated in the map issued\nwith the Authorization (e) Charge Areas/ Sub-districts - the authorisation\nmaps list the Charge Areas on the right hand side, and within the image of\nthe GA, the boundaries of the charge areas are marked and their names are\nindicated; these boundaries are described on the right hand side under\nLegends as \"SUB-DISTRICT BOUNDARY\"; the charge areas and sub-\ndistricts have been used inter-changeably in the map, consistent with the\nregulatory determination; in fact, the charge areas, by name, are the talukas\nof the respective districts; it is an admitted position that the 19 CNG stations\nin question fall in Talukas: Alandur, Sholinganallur and Sriperumbudur;\nthese Talukas constitute Charge Areas CA-01, CA-06 and CA-07 of GA 9.61\nrespectively, as noted in the impugned order as well.\n\n A. ANALYSIS:\n\n157. As noted hereinabove, the Appellant was granted an authorisation, for\nKanchipuram district GA (ie GA 9.61), by the PNGRB vide letter dated\n26.09.2018. Para 1 of the said authorisation recorded the area in square\nkilometres of the said GA as 6936.50 square kilometres. The Appellant, vide\nletter dated 19.01.2022, brought this error, in the authorisation granted to\nthem for Kanchipuram District GA, to the notice of the Board. The PNGRB,\nby its letter dated 31.01.2022, informed the Appellant that, although the\ntender document and the map issued in Schedule D (authorisation letter)\nhad mentioned the correct area as 4483 square kilometres, inadvertently the\nsame had been written as 6936.50 square kilometres in Para-1 of Schedule\nD; and, in view of the above, the authorised area mentioned at Para-1 of\nSchedule D should be read as 4483 square kilometres. It is clear therefore\nthat, as recently as 31.01.2022 (long after the bids were invited and finalised\nand authorisation was granted for both the GAs), the Board acknowledges\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 114 of 184\n\n the total area in sq.kms of GA 9.61 to be 4483 square kilometres which\ncorresponds to the area in sq.kms of the then Kanchipuram District as per\nthe 2011 Census Handbook.\n\n158. We see no reason to examine the Appellant's contentions, on an\nanalysis of the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Adani Gas Limited vs.\nPNGRB (24 SCC 529), since we have already referred to the said Judgment\nin detail earlier in this order. We had also observed earlier in this Order that\nthere was force in the submission of the Appellant that the Talukas of the\nthen Kanchipuram district constituted the charge areas of Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA for which the Appellant was granted an authorisation.\nConsequently, since these 19 CNG stations fall within Alandur,\nSholinganallur, and Sriperumbudur Talukas of Kanchipuram District, which\ncorresponds to charge areas CA-01, CA-06, and CA-07 of GA 9.61, it does\nappear that these 19 CNG stations fall within the charge areas of\nKanchipuram district GA.\n\n159. While we agree with the submission that the authorisation issued to\nthe Appellant and the 2nd Respondent by the PNGRB may well constitute a\nstatutory contract, we do not wish to delve on this aspect in the light of what\nwe have held hereinabove, or to express any opinion on the submission\nurged on behalf of the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent as to what\ntranspired during the oral hearing, though we find a reference thereto in the\nwritten submissions not to be in good taste. Questions posed by the Bench,\nduring the oral hearing of the appeal, are primarily for eliciting necessary\ninformation, and is not a conclusive expression of its views which must await\nthe final judgement. We wish to say no more.\n\n XX. STATUTORY SCHEME:\n\n A. SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 115 of 184\n\n 160. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that, as the subject contract is a statutory contract,\neverything leading to the formation of the contract, including the final\nauthorization issued, is governed by the Act and the Regulations; since\nPNGRB is a regulator, even the regulatory determination made by it are\nelevated to the level of Regulations. (NHAI v. Aam Aadmi Lokmanch,\n(2021) 11 SCC 566); this is owing to the highly specialized and dynamic\nnature of the field meant to be regulated; a regulatory determination once\nmade, equally binds the regulator, and cannot be deviated from except for\nshown public interest. \n((\nSEBI v. Sunil Krishna Khaitan\n, (2023) 2 SCC 643;\n\nMahindra Electric Mobility Limited and Another v. Competition\nCommission of India and Another\n, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8032 at para\n\n119); the Board identifies a 'specified geographic area' in which it considers\nit necessary or expedient to develop the public infrastructure of a CGD\nnetwork; it then gives wide publicity of its intention, i.e., the intention to\ndevelop a CGD network in such specified area (\nS. 19(1)\n); the statutory\nrequirement of giving wide publicity accords sanctity to the area publicized,\nand the same cannot be deviated from in a regulatory action; this is followed\nby selection of an entity through a competitive process at a global level.\n(\nSection 19(2)\n and\n S. 20(5)\n); both the identification of GA on the basis of\nnecessity or expediency, and the competitive selection process, make the\nconcepts of market forces and economic viability, central to the whole\nprocess; the definition of \"authorised area\" in \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the CGD\nAuthorization Regulations permits identification of geographical areas\ncomprising of parts or combinations of various administrative units therein;\nthe identification of geographical area is necessarily with reference to\nadministrative geographical units; there is no reference to identification on\nthe basis of geo-spatial coordinates (either in this or any other clause of the\n2008 Regulations or in any Board decision); the two specified criteria, for\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 116 of 184\n\n determination of a geographical area, are economic viability and contiguity\nas mentioned in Schedule-A; the concept of contiguity is also defined in\nSchedule-A as a function of economic viability. (There is no deletion of\n'economic viability from \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n); the Note to Schedule-A also\nemphasizes on economic viability of the GA; \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the 2008\nRegulations makes such units as the constituent elements of a GA since the\neconomic data, which is necessary for identification of the GA, as also for\nsubmission of bids, is available only in respect of the statutory geographical\nunits such as talukas, districts, notified urban areas etc; in particular, reliable,\ncomprehensive and statutorily authenticated economic data, in terms of the\n\nCensus Act, 1948\n, is available only in the Census (this is the reason why,\ndespite being 7 years old, the last available census data of 2011 is referred\nto in the regulations); the lowest unit, mentioned in \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, is also\nthe lowest unit considered in the Census i.e., a village. (not only is there no\nbasis for the submission of the 2nd Respondent that a part of some of the\nvillages of Kanchipuram District was made part of GA 9.62, but such a\nsubmission is also contrary to \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n); in any case, there is no\neconomic data available for any amorphous area identifiable only with\nreference to the co-ordinates; the GA cannot be a non-specified unit; for\ninstance, a household/commercial user in a particular area should be able\nto know to whom they should apply for supply of PNG, on the basis of the\nadministrative unit in which they are located, rather than undertaking a\ncoordinates based exercise; Schedule-B however indicates that the\ngeographical unit in question should ideally be a district or a combination of\ndistricts, since the said Schedule requires availability of granular data of the\n\"economic activity in the proposed geographical area in terms of industrial\nand commercial activity (number of units and fuel mix)\" and \"vehicular\npopulation profile\", which is available in the Census only at the district level\nand not for its lower sub-division (while Schedule-B applies to the expression\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 117 of 184\n\n of interest route cases, it is submitted that the same parameters must govern\nthe suo-motu determination of the GA by the Board); the statutory scheme\nis that the GA must be identified with reference to geographical units\nconsidered in the Census; the GA cannot be an amorphous unit, identifiable\nwith reference to co-ordinates, for which no economic data is available; the\nbidder is required to make its offer in terms of Schedule-C; while the offer is\nto be made consistent with the ACBD, the ACBD as such is not made part\nof the offer under Schedule-C, or the authorization under Schedule-D;\nSchedule-C contemplates that the bidder shall submit the relevant data,\nincluding the charge areas of the GA and the extent of the geographical area\nas his own data (Cl. 4(B)) i.e., it shall give its own understanding of the\ngeographical area, and give a declaration that the data given in the\n'application-cum-bid' is correct, complete and truly stated; this makes the\nbidder bound by the data submitted by it along with its bid; the Board\nevaluates eligibility, inter alia, on the basis of the financial strength of the\nbidder in terms of \nRegulation 5(6)(e)\n, which is a function of the figure of\npopulation \"in the geographical area\" as per the Census, i.e., the population\nof the geographical area should be available in Census 2011; upon selection\nby the Board, the successful bidder is required to submit Performance Bond\nin terms of \nRegulation 9\n, which is again a function of \"Population in the\nGeographical Area, as per the 2011 Census of India, once again\nemphasizing that the GA must be a unit whose population is available in the\n2011 Census of India; both these provisions necessarily require that the GA\nmust be a combination of one or more geographical units identified in the\nCensus, such as towns, villages, talukas and districts; while it has been held\nin the impugned order that reference to Census 2011 is made in the bidding\ndocument for the limited purpose of the bid bond and the application fee; this\nfirstly ignores that it is only the data 'of the GA' which can be considered -\nthe bid bond for one area cannot be based on the population of another area;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 118 of 184\n\n and secondly, that the bid bond and application fee are completely agnostic\nof the total area, households and towns and villages situated in a GA, all of\nwhich figures in the present case, also correspond to the Census 2011 data\nof the respective districts.\n\n161. Learned Senior Counsel would further contend that, after submission\nof the performance bond, the authorization in terms of Schedule-D is issued\nwith reference to the bid submitted, and lays emphasis on which State or\nUnion Territory the GA is located in, and the extent of the area in terms of sq\nkm for which the authorization is issued [para 1]; in view of the extant\nstatutory scheme, and the regulatory determinations made by the Board, the\nonly permissible manner for identification of GA's is on the basis of districts\nand marking of charge areas on the basis of taluka/ tehsil/ mandal.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n162. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that \nSection 2(i)\n of the PNGRB Act defines a city\nor local natural gas distribution network; \nSection 19\n provides for the grant of\nauthorization; \nSection 19(2)\n states the Board may select an entity in an\nobjective and transparent manner as specified by regulations for such\nactivities; \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the Authorization Regulations defines an\nauthorized area; it is thus evident that determination of the GA is completely\nleft to the discretion of the PNGRB; Schedule A of the Regulations lays down\nthe criteria for defining authorized area for laying, building or expanding a\nCGD network; \nRegulation 4\n deals with initiation of proposal through\nexpression of interest route or suo-motu by the PNGRB; \nRegulation 5\n deals\nwith the criteria for selection of entity via an expression of interest;\n\nRegulation 6\n pertains to the suo-motu route; in the case of a suo-\nmotu route, the 'public consultation process', applicable to the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 119 of 184\n\n expression of interest route under \nRegulation 5\n, has no\napplicability because the Regulation itself states that aspects\nrelating to expression of interest in \nRegulation 5\n shall not apply in\nthe case of a suo-motu bid; PNGRB conducted its 9th CGD Bidding\nRound in the year 2018; this was a suo motu (\nRegulation 6\n) round by PNGRB\ncovering 86 GAs across India; prior to the launch of the 9th Bidding Round\non 12.04.2018, PNGRB amended the 2008 Regulations on 06.04.2018;\nSchedule A of the Regulations was also amended and the criteria/ basis to\ndefine the authorized area for laying, building or expanding a CGD network\nwas modified; \nRegulation 7\n was also substituted and the bidding criteria was\nchanged; however, the definition of \"authorized area\" in \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n\nremained unchanged.\n\n163. Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that, under Schedule A\nof the original/ unamended 2008 Regulations, the criteria for determining a\n'specified geographical area' was economic viability and geographical\ncontiguity; however, by way of the amendment on 06.04.2018, this criteria\nwas changed to \"natural gas availability, pipeline connectivity and\ngeographical contiguity\"; therefore, \"economic viability\" was no longer a\nrelevant factor in determining the 'specified geographical area' for the 9th\nBidding Round; and the Bid Document also does not refer to \"economic\nviability\";\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n164. On the question as to whether exercise of regulatory power can be\nelevated to the status of Statutory Regulations, and the need for regulatory\ncertainty, it must be borne in mind that not every principle essential to the\neffective administration of a statute can or should be cast immediately into\nthe mold of a general rule. Some principles must await their own\ndevelopment, while others must be adjusted to meet particular,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 120 of 184\n\n unforeseeable situations. In performing its important functions in these\nrespects, therefore, an administrative agency must be equipped to act either\nby general rule or by individual order. To insist upon one form of action to\nthe exclusion of the other is to exalt form over necessity. (\nSecurities &\nExchange Commission v. Chenery Corpn.\n, 1947 SCC OnLine US SC\n109 : 91 L Ed 1995 : 332 US 194 (1947); \nMahindra Electric Mobility\nLimited v. Competition Commission of India\n, 2019 SCC OnLine Del\n8032; NHAI v. Aam Aadmi Lokmanch, (2021) 11 SCC 566).\n\n165. Problems may arise in a case which the administrative agency could\nnot reasonably foresee, problems which must be solved despite the absence\nof a relevant general rule. Or the agency may not have had sufficient\nexperience with a particular problem to warrant rigidifying its tentative\njudgment into a hard-and-fast rule. Or the problem may be so specialized\nand varying in nature as to be impossible of capture within the boundaries\nof a general rule. In those situations, the agency must retain power to deal\nwith the problems on a case-to-case basis if the administrative process is to\nbe effective. There is thus a very definite place for the case-by-case\nevolution of statutory standards. And the choice made between proceeding\nby general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in\nthe informed discretion of the administrative agency. (\nSecurities &\nExchange Commission v. Chenery Corpn.\n, 1947 SCC OnLine US SC\n109 : 91 L Ed 1995 : 332 US 194 (1947); \nMahindra Electric Mobility\nLimited v. Competition Commission of India\n, 2019 SCC OnLine Del\n8032; NHAI v. Aam Aadmi Lokmanch, (2021) 11 SCC 566).\n\n166. Law comes into existence not only through legislation but also by\nregulation and litigation. Laws from all three sources are binding. According\nto Professor Wade, 'between legislative and administrative functions we\nhave regulatory functions'. A statutory instrument, such as a rule or\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 121 of 184\n\n regulation, emanates from the exercise of delegated legislative power which\nis a part of administrative process resembling enactment of law by the\nlegislature whereas a quasi-judicial order comes from adjudication which is\nalso a part of administrative process resembling a judicial decision by a court\nof law. (PTC (India) Ltd. v. CERC, (2010) 4 SCC 603; NHAI v. Aam Aadmi\nLokmanch, (2021) 11 SCC 566).\n\n167. It is important for the regulator to be consistent and predictable.\nFurther, regulations must be clear, as ambiguous regulations cause\nconfusion and uncertainty. Regularity and predictability, along with certainty,\nare hallmarks of good regulation and governance. These principles underpin\nthe \"rule of law\", check arbitrariness and are read as the intent of the\nlegislation, which the Courts, if need be, will enforce as a principle of\ninterpretation. A regulator, when it executes statutory functions, interprets\nthe enactment and gives meaning and, in that sense, lays down what it\nbelieves is the rule. As a legislator who constructs and states at the first\ninstance what is the rule, the Board tacitly promises and prophesies the\ninterpretation that appeals to them. Any good regulatory system must\npromote and adhere to principles of certainty and consistency, providing\nassurance to the individual as to the consequence of transactions forming\npart of his daily affairs. (\nUnion of India v. Raghubir Singh\n, (1989) 2 SCC\n\n754). Unless men know what the rule of conduct is, they cannot regulate\ntheir actions to confirm to it. Otherwise, the regulator \"fails in its primary\nfunction as a rule maker. [ Francis Bennion, Bennion on Statutory\nInterpretation, 5th Edn. (Indian reprint), Section 266 at p. 801.] This does\nnot mean that the regulator/authorities cannot deviate from the past practice,\nalbeit any such deviation or change must be predicated on greater public\ninterest or harm. Therefore, to examine the question of inconsistency, the\nanalysis is to ascertain the need and functional value of the change, as\nconsistency is a matter of operational effectiveness. Sometimes changes\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 122 of 184\n\n are desirable and necessary. (\nSEBI v. Sunil Krishna Khaitan\n, (2023) 2\nSCC 643).\n\n168. In \"The Nature of the Judicial Process\", Benjamin N. Cardozo\nobserved:\n\n \"I am not to mar the symmetry of the legal structure by the\n introduction of inconsistencies and irrelevancies and artificial\n exceptions unless for some sufficient reason, which will\n commonly be some consideration of history or custom or policy\n or justice. Lacking such a reason, I must be logical just as I must\n be impartial, and upon like grounds. It will not do to decide the\n same question one way between one set of litigants and the\n opposite way between another.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n169. While it may not be necessary for us to examine the nature of the\nRegulatory power conferred by the \nPNGRB Act\n on the Respondent-Board,\nin the present appeal, the judgements relied on behalf of the Appellant do\nnot support their submission that the regulatory exercise undertaken by the\nPNGRB stands elevated to the level of statutory regulations. Besides\nexercising its regulatory powers under different provisions of the \nPNGRB\nAct\n, the Board has been conferred the power to make Regulations under\n\nSection 61\n of the said Act. \nSection 61(1)\n enables the Board, by notification,\nto make Regulations consistent with the Act and the Rules made thereunder\nto carry out the provisions of the \nPNGRB Act\n. Clauses (a) to (za) of \nSection\n61(2)\n provide for matters with respect to which the Regulations may provide.\nUnlike, with respect to exercise of regulatory power, the Regulations made\nunder \nSection 61\n are required, in terms of \nSection 2 (zb)\n of the PNGRB Act,\nto be notified in the official gazette. It is difficult for us, therefore, to agree\nwith the submission of Shri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 123 of 184\n\n on behalf of the Appellant, that exercise of regulatory powers by the Board\nshould be elevated to the status of Statutory Regulations.\n\n170. It is useful, in this context, to take note of the relevant statutory\nprovisions governing the obligations of the Board to prescribe the extent of\neach Geographical Area for which an authorisation is to be granted by them.\n\nSection 19\n of the PNGRB Act relates to grant of authorisation and, under\nsub-section (1) thereof, when, either on the basis of an application for\nauthorisation for laying, building, operating or expanding a city or local\nnatural gas distribution network is received, or on suo- motu basis the Board\nforms an opinion that it is necessary or expedient to lay, build, operate or\nexpand a city or local natural gas distribution network in a specified\ngeographic area, the Board may give wide publicity of its intention to do so,\nand may invite applications from interested parties to lay, build, operate or\nexpand a city or local natural gas distribution network. \nSection 19(2)\n enables\nthe Board to select an entity in an objective and transparent manner as\nspecified by Regulations for such activities.\n\n171. It is clear from \nSection 19(1)\n of the PNGRB Act that the Board must\nfirst form an opinion that it is necessary or expedient to lay, build, operate or\nexpand a city or local natural gas distribution network in a specified\ngeographic area. It is only after formation of such an opinion is the Board\nthen required to give wide publicity of its intention, and to invite applications\nfrom interested parties. The Board is required thereafter, in terms of \nSection\n19(2)\n, to select an entity in an objective and transparent manner, as specified\nby Regulations, for such activities.\n\n172. \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the 2008 Regulations defines \"authorized area\"\n\nto mean the specified geographical area for a city or local natural gas\ndistribution network (hereinafter referred to as \"CGD network\") authorized\nunder these regulations for laying, building, operating or expanding the CGD\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 124 of 184\n\n network which may comprise of the following categories, either individually\nor in any combination thereof, depending upon the criteria of economic\nviability and contiguity as stated in Schedule A namely:- (i) geographic area,\nin its entirety or in part thereof, within a municipal corporation or municipality,\nany other urban area notified by the Central or the State Government,\nvillage, block, tehsil, sub-division or district or any combination thereof; and\n\n(ii) any other area contiguous to the geographical area mentioned in sub-\n\nclause (i).\n\n173. \nRegulation 6\n relates to invitation by the Board for laying, building,\noperating or expanding of CGD network, and thereunder the Board may suo-\nmotu form a view regarding the development of a CGD network in a specific\ncity or a geographic area, and in such a case, the procedure as specified in\n\nRegulation 5\n (except aspects relating to the expression of interest) shall\napply. \nRegulation 5(4)\n enables the Board, based on the views received and\ntaking into consideration the criteria specified in Schedule A, to decide or fix\nthe authorized area for the proposed CGD network.\n\n174. Schedule-A of the 2008 Regulations relates to the basis for defining\nauthorized area for laying, building, operating or expanding CGD network. It\nis stipulated thereunder that the specified geographical area, in respect of\nan authorized area for a CGD network as per \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the\nAuthorisation Regulations, may be determined considering the following\ncriteria of natural gas availability, pipeline connectivity and Geographical\nContiguity, namely:- (1) Natural Gas availability and pipeline connectivity.\nThereunder geographical area shall either have availability of natural gas or\na natural gas pipeline passing within such area or passing in its vicinity or a\nnatural gas pipeline is proposed to be laid either within or in vicinity of such\narea. (2) Geographical contiguity. Thereunder, for the purpose of any area\nto be considered as contiguous to the geographical area as per Regulation\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 125 of 184\n\n 2(1)(c) of the Authorisation Regulations, such an area shall not have an\neconomic viability to have an independent CGD network on its own.\n\n175. It is clear from the definition of an \"authorised area\" under \nRegulation\n2(1)(c)\n, read with \nRegulation 5(4)\n of the 2008 Regulations, that, taking into\nconsideration the criteria specified in Schedule-A, the Board is required to\ndecide or fix the \"authorised area\" for the proposed CGD network. While an\n\"authorised area\", ie a \"specified geographical area\", may fall in its entirety\nor in part within a district or of a combination of one or more districts, it is\nevident that the boundaries of a geographical area must be\nspecified/decided by the Board, since \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n defines an\nauthorised area to mean the specified geographical area for a city or local\nnatural gas district network, and \nRegulation 5(4)\n requires the Board to fix the\nauthorised area for the proposed CGD network. The obligation to fix the\nauthorised area, ie a specified geographical area, must be fulfilled by the\nBoard prior to invitation of bids. since \nRegulation 5(4)\n requires the\n\"authorised area\" to be fixed for the \"proposed CGD network\".\n\n176. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the word \"specified\" to\nmean \"to identify clearly and definitely\". As the obligation placed on the\nPNGRB, under \nSection 19 (1)\n, is to first form an opinion that it is necessary\nor expedient to lay, build, operate or expand a city or local natural gas\ndistribution network in a specified geographic area, it must identify, clearly\nand definitely, the Geographical area within which it considers it necessary\nto lay a CGD network. As an \"authorized area\" is defined in \nRegulation\n2(1)(c)\n of the 2008 Regulations to mean the specified geographical area\nauthorized for laying, building, operating or expanding the CGD network. It\nis only for a definitely identified area, that an authorisation can be given in\nfavour of the selected entity. While requiring the PNGRB to clearly and\ndefinitely identify the Geographical Area for which bids are to be invited, the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 126 of 184\n\n Regulations leave it to the discretion of the PNGRB to decide what should\nconstitute a geographical area, for \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n makes it clear that a\nGeographical Area may comprise either individually or in any combination\nthereof, depending upon the criteria of economic viability and contiguity as\nstated in Schedule A, a geographic area, in its entirety or in part thereof,\nwithin a municipal corporation or municipality, any other urban area notified\nby the Central or the State Government, village, block, tehsil, sub-division or\ndistrict or any combination thereof; and (ii) any other area contiguous to the\ngeographical area mentioned in sub-clause(i).\n\n177. In this context, it is relevant to note that the 2nd Respondent informed\nthe Appellant, vide letter dated 22.02.2022, that their authorised GA\n(Chennai and Thiruvallur District GAs) was also spread over to certain parts\nof Kanchipuram District as per the map web hosted by the PNGRB during\nthe CGD bidding, considering which the bid members had quoted to make\nthe GA financially viable. Subsequently, in our order dated 05.04.2023, we\nhad recorded that earlier the learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf\nof the 2nd Respondent, was called upon to place before us a coalesced map\nshowing both the GAs (9.61 and 9.62) juxtaposed to each other, to enable\nus to ascertain whether the Geographical Areas, as reflected in the\nrespective maps, overlap; learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\nAppellant and the 2nd Respondent were in agreement that the GAs, as\nindicated in the coalesced map furnished on behalf of the 2nd Respondent,\nreflected the GAs indicated in the separate maps furnished along with the\nbid documents, to the extent the boundaries of both the Geographical Areas\nhad been correctly shown therein. We had also recorded the submission of\nMr. Gopal Jain, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, that, while the disputed 19 CNG stations fell within\nKanchipuram District, they fell with the GA for which an authorization was\ngiven in favour of the 2nd Respondent; using a handheld GPS system, the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 127 of 184\n\n 2nd Respondent had plotted these CNG stations on the basis of coordinates;\nand they found that all these stations fell within GA 9.62 ie Chennai-Tiruvallur\nDistricts GA.\n\n178. Since these 19 CNG stations indisputably fell within the boundaries of\nthe then Kanchipuram District, what we are required to ascertain is whether\nthe PNGRB had decided to fix GA 9.61 and GA 9.62 on the basis of a District\nor beyond or less. If it is held that the Board had fixed the GAs on the basis\nof a district, then, it is the Appellant which is entitled to operate these 19 CNG\nstations falling within its authorised Geographical Area which is co-terminus\nwith the then Kanchipuram District. If, on the other hand, the Board intended\nto fix the GAs on the basis of co-ordinates or to exclude a part of\nKanchipuram District from Kanchipuram District GA, and include it within\nChennai and Tiruvallur District GAs, then it is the 2nd Respondent which must\nbe held entitled to continue operating these 19 CNG Stations.\n\n179. As identification by the Board of a \"specified Geographical Area\" for\nwhich bids are to be invited is in discharge of its statutory obligations under\n\nSection 19(1)\n of the PNGRB Act read with \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n and\nSchedule A of the 2008 Regulations, and the manner in which a\nGeographical Area should be determined is left to the discretion of the Board\nunder the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations, there is no obligation cast\non the Board only to rely on the 2011 Census data while determining the\nGeographical Area. That does not, however, mean that the PNGRB is\nprohibited from relying on the 2011 Census data in determining the limits of\neach of the GAs for which bids are intended to be invited. The exercise now\nundertaken by us is to ascertain whether the 2011 Census data was, in fact,\nrelied upon by the Board in determining the area and extent of GAs 9.61 and\n9.62.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 128 of 184\n\n 180. We have no quarrel with the submissions of Mr. Gopal Jain, Learned\nSenior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, that\ndetermination of the GA is at the discretion of the PNGRB. The question is\nnot regarding the power of the PNGRB to determine the boundaries of each\nof the GAs for which bids are proposed to be invited, but as to how the\nboundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 have been actually determined. It does\nappear that either the map vendor had erred in properly recording the co-\nordinates of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 or it has erred in correctly recording all other\ndetails reflected in the map ie the District boundary, Talukas (Sub-Districts)\nboundaries, reference to the name of the villages with a population of 5000\nand above, the total area of the GA in sq. kms in terms of the 2011 census,\nthe total population of the GA in terms of 2011 census, the total number of\nhouseholds in the GA as per the 2011 census, etc.\n\n181. It is relevant to note that the left side of the map of each of these two\nGAs records the GA boundary by way of a red line, the District boundary by\nway of black lines, and both these lines overlap both with respect to GA 9.61\nand 9.62. The black line between Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts in GA 9.62\nreflects the boundaries of Chennai District within the said GA as it comprises\nof two districts ie Chennai and Tiruvallur. The District boundary, recorded in\nthe black line which overlaps the GA 9.62 boundary line in red, evidently\nrefer to the District boundaries of both Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts put\ntogether, and not separately.\n\n182. It is no doubt true that mere issuance of the public notice, identifying\nGA on the district concept, did not disable PNGRB from, thereafter,\namending the boundaries of the GAs to include within one GA the entire\ndistrict plus a part of another district. The question which necessitates\nexamination is whether the Board had, in fact, deviated from the district\nconcept indicated in the public notice, and had taken a conscious decision\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 129 of 184\n\n to include a part of Kanchipuram District in the GA of Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistricts.\n\n XXI. REGULATORY DETERMINATION BY THE BOARD:\n\n183. On the regulatory determination made by the Board, Sri Paras Kuhad,\nLearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit\nthat it is the stated position of the PNGRB, before this Tribunal, that from the\n4th round onwards it has been authorizing GAs based on the boundaries of\nDistricts, to rule out the issues/disputes arising amongst GAs having\ncontiguous areas. (as recorded in answer to Query no. 2 at p. 102 of the\njudgment in Appeal No. 121 of 2020 titled \nMegha Engineering and\nInfrastructures Limited v. Bhagyanagar Gas Limited\n); on 10.12.2020, the\nBoard filed an Affidavit before this Tribunal in the case of Megha\nEngineering, reaffirming that \"while preparing maps, the vendors are\nsupposed to take data related to boundaries from Survey of India or Census\nof India 2011 District Handbook, based on which, the charge Areas are\ndemarcated\", and that \"the boundaries of the Geographical Areas are\nchecked with the district boundaries as mentioned in the Census of India\n2011 District Census Handbook or with the maps given in the official website\nof each district\"; during the 5th CGD bidding round, the Board further took a\ndecision that charge areas are demarcated as per the mandal boundaries\nwithin the districts, and made a public declaration of this decision in response\nto clarifications dated 07.04.2015; these decisions constitute regulatory\ndetermination made by the PNGRB; in regulatory jurisprudence, such\ndeterminations have been placed on par with regulations made in exercise\nof the power of delegated legislation; and it is not the case of the\nRespondents that the Board revisited these regulatory determinations,\nassuming it could have done so.\n\n A. ANALYSIS:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 130 of 184\n\n 184. As held hereinabove, regulatory determination by the Board cannot be\nplaced on par with Statutory Regulations. In the light of the judgement of the\nSupreme Court, in Adani Gas Limited, it may not be appropriate for us to\nexamine what the PNGRB had done with respect to other GAs, since the\nauthorisation granted with respect to those GAs is neither under challenge,\nnor are those, in whose favour authorisation was granted, parties to the\npresent proceedings. We see no reason, in such circumstances, to examine\nthe clarifications given by the PNGRB with respect to the GAs of Megha\nEngineering and Infrastructure Limited and Bhagyanagar Gas Limited, since\nthe authorisation granted to both the said entities are not the subject matter\nof the present Appeal.\n\n XXII. DETERMINATION OF GAS' 9.61 AND 9.62 BY PNGRB ON\n THE BASIS OF DISTRICTS:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n185. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that (1) the regulatory exercise for the 9th CGD\nBidding Round commenced in the year 2016; one of the objectives under\nconsideration was to identify GAs in a manner that avoided cherry-picking\n(Note to Schedule-A); the Board again made a regulatory determination to\nachieve this objective by identifying GAs on the basis of districts. (Public\nNotices dated 10.03.2016 and 12.04.2016); on 18.01.2018, PNGRB issued\na tender for getting the maps of the identified GAs prepared through a\nvendor; it was stipulated in the tender document that the vendor shall collect\ndetails of all administrative divisions such as Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal etc. and\nindicate them in the maps supplied, and that the source for population data\nof the geographical area, was the Census of India; in the clarifications to the\nsaid tender, it was stated that the Board would not provide geo-referenced\ndata to the vendor for preparation of the maps, and that the vendor was not\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 131 of 184\n\n required to do any survey on his own; (2) shortly after 19.02.2018, a draft\nBoard Agenda was prepared for finalization of GAs for the 9th CGD Bidding\nRound, which shows that the GAs were still based on the district concept;\nthe final Board Agenda and the Minutes of the Meeting thereon were not\nmade available to the Appellant for inspection; however, the final Board\nAgenda was subsequently provided to the Appellant by its counsel who\nobtained it from the PNGRB under the \nRight to Information Act\n on\n19.09.2023); this records that, based on the entire consultation process, i.e.,\ninputs from stakeholders and internal deliberations within PNGRB along with\nmembers and authorization division, the Board had prepared a list of 86 GAs\ncomprising of 156 full districts and 18 Part Districts; in the list enclosed with\nthe Board Agenda, there are several part districts marked but Kanchipuram,\nChennai and Tiruvallur are shown as full and not part districts. [at Sr. 118,\n119, 127]; and the relevant entries read as follows:\n\n List of Geographical Areas for the 9th Round CGD Bidding\n\n SN State/UT District Name Remarks\n\n 118 Tamil Nadu Kanchipuram\n\n 119 Tamil Nadu Chennai clubbed with Tiruvallur\n\n 127 Tamil Nadu Tiruvallur clubbed with Chennai\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE PNGRB:\n\n186. In support of his contention that it was not necessary to make the\nboundary of an administrative district as the boundary of a GA, Sri Rahul\nSagar Sahai, Learned Counsel for the PNGRB, would submit, on the issue\nof the concept of a GA, that it was necessary, at the outset, to understand\nthe formation and concept of GA under the \nPNGRB Act, 2006\n and the\nRegulations framed thereunder as the expression Geographical area (GA)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 132 of 184\n\n had a particular meaning in downstream petroleum jurisprudence; the\nexpression 'specified geographic area' finds mention in \nSection 19\n of the\nPNGRB Act, which governs the grant of authorization to entities; and \nSection\n19(2)\n states that the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n(\"PNGRB\") may select an entity in an objective and transparent manner as\nspecified by regulations for such activities.\n\n187. After extracting \nSection 19\n of the PNGRB Act, and \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n\nof the 2008 Regulations, Learned Counsel for the PNGRB would submit\nthat, on analyzing the provisions of the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008\nRegulations, it was clear that a geographical area may comprise of an area,\nin entirety on in part thereof, within a municipal corporation or municipality,\nany other urban area, village, block, tehsil, sub- division or district or any\ncombination thereof; determination of the GA is completely left to the\ndiscretion of the regulatory authority i.e. PNGRB; \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the\nAuthorization Regulation makes it clear that a specified geographical area\ncould be a combination of administrative demarcations in its entirety or in a\npart thereof; it is possible that different areas of the same district may be a\npart of two or more separate authorized GAs; similarly, a specified GA could\nbe a culmination of two areas falling in different districts; there is no\nrequirement, either in the Regulations or otherwise, that the entire\ndistrict/city should necessarily fall only in one specified GA; in fact, this\nposition is common ground between the parties since, even according to the\nAppellant \"it was never the contention of the Appellant that the Board is not\nempowered to demarcate a Geographical Area comprising of parts of one\nor more districts\".\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n188. \nRegulation 5(7)\n of the 2008 Regulations requires the application-cum-\n\nbid to be submitted in two parts in the form as specified in Schedule C in\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 133 of 184\n\n separate properly earmarked and sealed envelopes, namely: - (a) Part I\n(Technical bid) covering general particulars of the entity and technical details\nof the project including minimum eligibility criteria under sub-regulation (6);\n\n(b) Part II (Financial bid) covering the financial details under \nRegulation 7\n.\nSchedule C of the 2008 Regulations is the proforma of the application-cum-\nbid for grant of authorisation for CGD network. Serial No. 4 of the said\nSchedule relates to technical details of the proposed CGD network project.\nSerial No. 4(B) requires the applicant to indicate in the maps the charge\nareas and the extent of the geographical area along with the sketch of\nfacilities proposed. The application contains a declaration by the applicant\nthat the information furnished is true to the best of the applicant's knowledge\nand belief and the information and data given in the annexure, attachments,\nenclosures and calculation sheets accompanying the application-cum-bid\nare correct, complete and truly stated, and if any statement made therein is\nfound to be incorrect, the application-cum-bid shall be rejected, the\napplication fee and the Bid Bond shall be forfeited and the applicant shall be\nliable to be proceeded against, and for punishment under the provisions of\nthe Act.\n\n189. The application-cum-bid document is issued by the Board inviting\nentities to submit their bids for laying a CGD network in the specified\ngeographical Area (GA). The obligation placed on the Board, by \nSection\n19(1)\n of the PNGRB Act read with \nSection 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n and Schedule A of\nthe 2008 Regulations, is to specify the geographical area for which bids are\nto be invited. Part A of the ACBD draws reference of the bidders to the\napplicable Regulations, including the 2008 Regulations and the\namendments thereto. Clause 1.1.1 of the ACBD states that the PNGRB was\ninviting Applications-cum-Bids for grant of authorisation for developing City\nGas Distribution (CGD) network in the aforesaid geographical area as\ndepicted in the map at Annexure-1. Clause 1.1.2 states that the charge areas\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 134 of 184\n\n are also depicted in the map; if the bidding entity is finally granted\nauthorization, the entity shall be required to reach the charge areas as\nstipulated in the CGD authorisation Regulations. Clause 1.2 of the ACBD\nrequires the bidding entities to comply with the relevant regulations notified\nfrom time to time, and requires them to carry out the development of CGD\nproject in line with the regulations \nlaid down by\n the PNGRB. Clause 2.1.1\nprovides that the bidder is expected to examine the contents of the\nApplication-cum-Bid document, including all instructions, forms, terms and\nconditions and all the Regulations of the PNGRB. Clause 2.1.2 stipulates\nthat the Application-cum-Bid document comprises of Annexure 1 to\nAnnexure 13. Annexure-1 is the map depicting the geographical area and\nthe charge areas, and the bidders were directed thereby to carefully study\nthe geographical area and the charge areas before submitting the bid.\nAnnexure 1 to the ABCD, which relates to the map depicting the\ngeographical area and the charge areas, also requires the bidder to carefully\nstudy the geographical area and the charge areas before submitting their\nApplication-cum-Bid.\n\n190. \nIn \nAdani Gas Ltd. v. Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board\n,\n(2020) 4 SCC 529, the Supreme Court held that the bidder was required to\ncarefully study the GA and the charge area before submitting the bid; and\nthe bid document necessarily had to be in conformity with the 2008\nRegulations. It is, therefore, difficult for us to accept the submission that it is\nonly the application cum bid document which has to be considered, by the\nbidding entities. The conditions stipulated in the application-cum-bid\ndocument must be read along with the applicable statutory provisions in the\n\nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations. Since entities are required to submit\ntheir bids separately for each of the GAs, it is evident that bids can be invited\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 135 of 184\n\n by the PNGRB only after the contours and boundaries of each GA, for which\nbids are invited, are clearly identified by them.\n\n191. While it is true that \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n confers power on the Board to\nspecify the geographical area, in its entirety or in a part thereof, it does not\ndischarge the Board of its obligations to specify the GA before inviting bids.\nIt is necessary for us, therefore, to ascertain what the Board has determined\nto be the specified Geographical Area for GAs 9.61 and 9.62. The question\nis not regarding the power of the Board to demarcate the GA comprising of\none or more districts, but regarding the actual exercise undertaken by the\nBoard, and the decision taken by it pursuant thereto regarding the contours\nand boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62.\n\n192. It is true, as submitted on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, that the Board\nhad addressed letter dated 26.09.2018 to the Appellant regarding grant of\nauthorization for development of city gas distribution networks in the area of\nKanchipuram Districts. Para-1 also states that enclosed the said letter is the\nauthorisation in Schedule D for the GA of Kanchipuram Districts in duplicate.\nWhile Kanchipuram District is referred to in the plural in the letter dated\n26.09.2018, the map annexed thereto refers to the \"Geographical Area,\nKanchipuram District\". It is on the basis of this letter that it is contended that\nthe nomenclature of the GA is irrelevant, and the map given at the time of\nbidding would prevail over any other consideration.\n\n193. While demarcation of the boundaries, of each District in each State, no\ndoubt falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Government which\ncan undergo a change with time, and the boundary limits of both Chennai\nand Kanchipuram Districts have undergone a change pursuant to GO dated\n04.01.2018 issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu before the PNGRB\nissued the Application cum Bid Document on 12.04.2018, it is also not in\ndispute that the Board has itself acknowledged, in the impugned order, that\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 136 of 184\n\n it had not taken into consideration the changes made to the districts, vide\nGO dated 04.01.2018, while inviting bids from eligible entities.\n\n194. Division of the erstwhile Kanchipuram District between Kanchipuram\nand Chengalpattu districts, post award of the GAs, would have no bearing\non determination of the subject GAs 9.61 and 9.62, and in issuing the\napplication-cum-bid document pursuant thereto.\n\n195. As noted hereinabove, the manner in which the Geographical Area\nshould be demarcated, whether it should be on the basis of the district or\nmore or less, are all matters which fall exclusively within the discretion of the\nBoard. As the Board has itself acknowledged that it had not taken into\nconsideration the contents of GO dated 04.01.2018 in demarcating GAs 9.61\nand 9.62, the changes made to the Kanchipuram and Chennai districts by\nway of the said GO would not have any bearing on the determination of\nboundaries of the subject Geographical Areas by the Board. What was taken\ninto consideration by the PNGRB, before issuing the Application cum Bid\nDocument on 12.04.2018, were the Kanchipuram, Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistricts as they existed prior to GO dated 04.01.2018, and the information\nfurnished in the map annexed to the ACBD was based on the 2011 Census\nwhich was the last Census undertaken in the country.\n\n196. What we are concerned with, in the present Appeal, is the exercise\nundertaken by the Board to determine the GA. The Appeals before this\nTribunal and later before the Supreme Court in Adani Gas was on the scope\nand ambit of \nRegulation 7\n, which related to the bidding criteria. The issue in\nthe present case, on the other hand, is regarding determination by the\nPNGRB, of the areas covered by GAs 9.61 and 9.62, in the discharge of its\nstatutory obligations under \nSection 19\n of the PNGRB Act read with\n\nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n and Schedule A of the 2008 Regulations. The\ncontext in which the Supreme Court, in Adani Gas, observed that the 2011\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 137 of 184\n\n Census could not be relied upon has already been dealt with earlier in this\norder, and does not bear repetition.\n\n197. We have no quarrel with the submission of the 2nd Respondent that the\nmap vendor was not called upon to rely on the Survey of India Map and,\nconsequently, it is un-necessary for us to delve into the question whether or\nnot the map prepared by the Map vendor, which forms the basis for invitation\nof bids in the 9th round of bidding, was in accordance with the Survey of India\nMap or the consequences of their failure, if any, to do so.\n\n198. The right side of the map, in Annexure 1 of the ACBD and in the\nauthorization, for GA 9.61 ie Kanchipuram District GA contains details of the\ncharge area ID and the corresponding name of the charge area. CA-01 is\nAlandur, CA-02 is Chengalpattu, CA-03 is Cheyyur, CA-04 is\nKancheepuram, CA-05 is Maduranthakam, CA-06 is Sholinganallur, CA-07\nis Sriperumbudur, CA-08 is Tambaram, CA-09 is Tirukalukundram, CA-10 is\nTiruporur, and CA-11 is Uthiramerur. These 11 charge areas correspond to\nthe Talukas of Kanchipuram District as it stood on 03.01.2018 ie prior to GO\ndated 04.01.2018 issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The boundaries\nof these charge areas are also demarcated within the GA boundary of the\nphysical map on the left side, and is recorded under the caption \"Legend\" on\nthe right side of the map as \"Sub-District boundaries\". That the map vendor\nhas taken information which existed within two years prior to the work order\nis evident from the fact that Kanchipuram District under the 2011 Census\nconsisted of 10 Talukas, one of these ie Chengalpattu taluk was bifurcated\nin the year 2012 to become Chengalpattu and Tiruporur Taluks. Except\nbifurcation of Chengalpattu taluk into two in the year 2012, all other talukas\nof Kanchipuram District remained as it was, post the 2011 Census, till GO\ndated 04.01.2018 was issued. It is the admitted case of PNGRB that it did\nnot take into consideration the amended boundaries of Kanchipuram District\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 138 of 184\n\n as notified by the Government of Tamil Nadu on 04.01.2018, and it had\ninvited bids on the basis of Districts as it existed prior to 04.01.2018.\n\n199. It is relevant to note that the sum total of the population of each of\nthese charge areas, as recorded in the 2011 census, correspond to the total\npopulation of Kanchipuram District as per the 2011 census which is also\nrecorded, as the population of the Kanchipuram District GA, ie 39,98,252,\non the right side of the map. Likewise, the sum total of the area in sq. kms.\nof each of these charge areas (Talukas) in the 2011 census corresponds to\nthe area in sq. kms of Kanchipuram District ie 4483 sq. kms, which is also\nthe area in sq. kms of Kanchipuram District GA. The very fact that the\nAppellant had, vide its letter dated 19.01.2022 sought amendment of its\nauthorization and for correction of the total area in sq. kms. recorded therein\nas 6936,50 sq kms to 4483 sq. kms, and the Board had accordingly, vide its\nletter dated 31.01.2022, carried out the amendment, would show that, even\nas on 31.01.2022, the Board was of the view that the authorization given to\nthe Appellant for Kanchipuram District GA corresponded to the Kanchipuram\nDistrict boundary as it existed prior to GO dated 04.01.2018.\n\n200. The villages with population of 5000 and above are also noted in the\nGA map. Out of the 19 CNG sub-stations, 15 of them are located in 9 villages\nwith a population of 5000 and above, and are all reflected in the map of\nKanchipuram District GA ie GA 9.61, and are not referred to in the map of\nChennai and Tiruvallur Districts GA ie GA 9.62. If, as is now contended\nbefore us on behalf of the second respondent, a part of Kanchipuram District\nwas consciously included in GA 9.62 ie Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA, then\nthe villages above 5000 population and the talukas in which these villages\nwhere these 19 CNG Stations are located, ought to have been reflected in\nthe Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA map, and added to the total area in\nsq.kms, the total population and the total households on the right side of the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 139 of 184\n\n map of Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA. Likewise, the area in sq.kms,\npopulation and households of that part of the Kanchipuram District which\nwas included within the Kanchipuram District GA ought to have been\nexcluded therefrom. Further the 9 villages, where the 15 CNG are located,\nshould have also been reflected in the map of Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts\nGA.\n\n201. It is relevant to note that the total area in sq. kms. ie 3659 sq. kms.,\nthe total population ie 83,74,836 and the total households ie 21,01,931\nshown on the right side of the map at Annexure A of the bid documents for\nGA 9.62 ie Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA tallies with the corresponding\nfigures reflected in the 2011 census for Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts\ntogether; no part of any of the Talukas of Kanchipuram District, where these\n19 CNG stations are located, are reflected in the map of Chennai-Tiruvallur\nDistricts GA; and the 9 villages with a population of 5000 and above, wherein\n15 of the 19 CNG stations are located, are also not shown in the map of\nChennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA.\n\n202. It does appear from the documents placed on record in these\nproceedings, as also from the original records which the PNGRB had placed\nfor our perusal, that the Board has not taken a conscious decision to include\nany part of the then Kanchipuram District or any part of the Talukas/ Villages\nof the then Kanchipuram District in Chennai-Tiruvallur District GA.\n\n203. While it is no doubt true that the Application-cum-Bid Document does\nnot per-se state that the GAs would be awarded on a District concept area\nor on the basis of the Survey of India map, it does not also state that the GAs\nwould be awarded on the basis of co-ordinates. Further, both in terms of the\nACBD as also the annexed map, all the bidders were asked to take note of\nthe Geographical Area and the charge areas. From Annexure 1 to the\nApplication-cum-Bid Document ie the map of each of these GAs, the public\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 140 of 184\n\n notices and other records of the PNGRB, we have sought to ascertain what\nthe Board intended to specify as the boundaries of each of these two GAs,\nsince \nSection 19(1)\n of the PNGRB Act read with \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n and\nSchedule A of the 2008 Regulations, obligates the PNGRB to clearly identify\nthe GA before inviting bids for the said GAs. While the parameters to born in\nmind by the Board to decide on the contours of the GA was changed by\namendment to Schedule A on 06.04.2018, and \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n no doubt\ngives a wide discretion to the Board to fix the boundaries of each of these\n\nGAs, the PNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations also place an obligation on\nthe Board to clearly identify and decide what the boundaries of GAs 9.61\nand GA 9.62 should be.\n\n204. The emphasis, placed on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, on the use of\nwords \"Kanchipuram Districts\" instead of 'Kanchipuram District' in the\nauthorization granted in favour of the Appellant is of no consequence. The\nuse of the word \"Districts\" denotes a district in the plurality and means two\nDistricts or more. It is not even contended, on behalf of the 2nd Respondent,\nthat there exists more than one Kanchipuram District in the State of Tamil\nNadu or that the Appellant's authorization included an area beyond\nKanchipuram District.\n\n205. We have considered various factors, and not merely the nomenclature\ngiven to the respective GAs. The division of Kanchipuram District, post\naward of the GA to the Appellant, has no bearing on the present lis, since\nwhat the Appellant is entitled to is only for the area as reflected in the map\nof Kanchipuram District GA which is co-terminus with the then Kanchipuram\nDistrict. As discussed hereinabove, the judgment of the Supreme Court in\nAdani Gas related to bidding criteria and on the scope of \nRegulation 7\n, and\nnot as to what constituted the GAs for which an authorization was granted in\nfavour of the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 141 of 184\n\n 206. The Appellant's contention, that reliance should be placed on the\nSurvey of India map, is misplaced since what is of relevance is the contours\nof the map in Annexure 1 of the Application-cum-Bid Document which later\nformed part of the authorization letter. The issue regarding non-furnishing of\n.SHP file has already been discussed earlier in this order. The submissions\nmade by parties, before this Tribunal in Adani Gas, as well as before the\nSupreme Court, related to whether or not the successful bidders had\ncomplied with the bidding criteria in \nRegulation 7\n, and the submissions made\nin that context cannot be extrapolated to the present dispute which relates\nto determination of the boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 for which\nauthorization was granted in favour of the Appellant and the second\nRespondent respectively. As already noted hereinabove, in the light of the\njudgement of the Supreme Court in Adani Gas Ltd, it may not be\nappropriate for us, in the instant case, to examine the decision taken by the\nBoard with respect to other GAs.\n\n207. With a view to ascertain what the PNGRB had decided as the criteria\nfor determining the boundaries of both the GAs, we shall now take note of\nthe contents of the relevant Public Notices, the tender and work order issued\nto the map vendor and the communication between them and the Board, as\nalso the official records of the PNGRB which we had directed them to place\nfor our perusal.\n\n XXIII. PUBLIC NOTICE & OTHER DOCUMENTS:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n208. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that it was also noted in the Board Agenda that the\nlist for the 9th CGD Round bidding had been prepared, inter alia, based upon\n\"Combination of districts for forming GAs based upon the input from\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 142 of 184\n\n stakeholders and internal deliberations [pr. 5(vi)]; it was decided that the list\nmay be 'web-hosted once approved by the Board for information of all'; (3)\nthe list was evidently approved by the Board since a list identical to the list\nannexed to the above Board Agenda, was in fact web hosted on 24.02.2018\n\"for information to all stakeholders concerned\". [p. 108/C1]; it is thus\nestablished that the Public Notice was giving wide publicity to the decision\nof the Board formed after completion of the consultation process, in\nconsonance with \nSection 19\n; (4) the Board having decided, pursuant to the\nabove Agenda dated February, 2018, that Kanchipuram, Chennai and\nTiruvallur Districts will be comprised into GAs as indicated above, this\ndecision could only have been changed by the Board itself; no such\nsubsequent decision has been shown to this Court; (5) the same list was\nreorganized and published by PNGRB vide public notice dated 01.03.2018;\nthis list also contained the names of Districts comprising the respective GAs\nand the State in which they were located; in conformity with the Board\nAgenda dated February, 2018, the list contains 86 GAs comprising of 156\nfull districts and 18 Part Districts; the 18 part districts are stated to be so at\nSr. No. 8, 9, 10, 15 (2 part-districts), 19, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57 (2 part-districts),\n75, 76, 77, 82, 83 and 84; all the cases of part-districts are those where a\npart of the area was previously authorized, except in the case of Chittorgarh\nDistrict, for which Rawatbhata Taluka was placed in GA 57, and the\nremaining talukas were included in GA 59; there is no division below Taluka\nlevel in any of the GAs; and GAs 9.61 and 9.62 were described therein as\nfollows:\n\n List of Geographical Areas for the 9th Round CGD Bidding\n\n SN State/UT Geographical District Name\n Areas\n 61 Tamil Nadu Kanchipuram Kanchipuram\n District\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 143 of 184\n\n 62 Tamil Nadu Chennai and Chennai\n Tiruvallur Districts\n Tiruvallur\n\n209. With respect to the correspondence with the map vendor, Sri Paras\nKuhad, Learned Senior Counsel, would submit that, despite repeated\nqueries from the bench and assurances by the Respondents, it has not been\nstated as to what part of Kanchipuram District/talukas/towns/villages were\nincluded in GA 9.62, when, and pursuant to which decision of the Board; in\nfact, as the correspondence with the map vendor shows, no such decision\nwas taken or communicated to the map vendor; (6) on 12.03.2018, the\nBoard awarded contracts for preparation of GA maps pursuant to clause\n17.1.1 of the tender document dated 18.01.2018 to Samvridhi Infotech Pvt.\nLtd and ML Infomap Pvt. Ltd; the contract awarded to ML Infomap Pvt. Ltd\nspecifically reiterated the direction to depict Taluka/ tehsil/ Mandal as charge\nareas, and to indicate the important towns/ cities; (7) on 23.03.2018, a work\norder was issued to ML Infomap Pvt. Ltd to prepare maps for 59 GAs,\nincluding \"Kanchipuram District GA 9.61\" and \"Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistricts GA 9.62\"; this is the only document containing any information\nabout GAs 9.61 and 9.62 provided by PNGRB to ML Infomap; the list\nattached to the work order contains the names of the State, Geographical\nArea, District Name, Area, and Rate; under 'Area', the area of the GA in sq.\nkm, is mentioned, and it matches with the area of the Kanchipuram and\nChennai & Tiruvallur districts as per Census 2011; there is no reference to\nany geographical coordinates (latitude or longitude) in this or any other\ndocument provided by the PNGRB to the map vendor; the only information\nprovided in respect of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 is the name of the respective\ndistricts and the total area, which matches the Census 2011 area in respect\nof GAs 9.61 and 9.62; this is also the same as the area mentioned in the bid\ndocument and the authorization letter of the respective GAs; the selected\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 144 of 184\n\n vendor had provided a certificate to PNGRB on 23.02.2018 stating that it\nhas prepared the maps with administrative boundaries as per census and\nupdated up to the year 2017; it was thus clearly communicated by the\nPNGRB to the map vendor that the GA map should be for the whole of\nKanchipuram and Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts respectively, that the talukas\nof the districts should form the charge areas of the respective GAs, and that\nthe total area covered should be 4483 sq. km for GA 9.61 and 3569 sq. km.\nfor GA 9.62, respectively; assuming, without prejudice, that the map vendor\nwas asked to prepare a map with co-ordinates, he was at best asked to\nprovide the co-ordinates of the respective districts, which alone constituted\nthe Board's determination; it is not the case of the Board that they had\nascertained the co-ordinates and had asked the map vendor to draw a GA\nboundary on the basis thereof; co-ordinates are not the decision of the\nBoard, but are, at best, one of the tools to depict the district based decision\nof the Board; (8) the maps along with a summary sheet were received by\nPNGRB on 09.04.2018, and approval thereon was granted by the members\nof the Board [This document was not made available for inspection, but was\nshown to the Court and the Counsel for the Appellant by the Board during\nthe course of the hearing]; (9) on 11.04.2018, a draft Public Notice was\nprepared for inviting bids under the 9th CGD Bidding Round; the immediately\nnext document in the file is a summary sheet containing the list of GAs being\nadvertised with the figures of population and number of households; for\nKanchipuram District GA 9.61 and Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts GA 9.62;\nthese figures match those of Census 2011; this was one day prior to the\nissuance of the bid document on 12.04.2018, and even till this stage, the\nonly reference point for GAs 9.61 and 9.62 is the respective districts of\nKanchipuram and Chennai & Tiruvallur, and their total area, population and\nhouseholds, all three of which match the Census 2011 data; and (10) it is\nthus established that there is no revisitation of the composition or boundaries\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 145 of 184\n\n of the GAs after 01.03.2018; and contrary to the oral submission of the\ncounsel for PNGRB, there is no proposal, discussion or decision whatsoever\nin any of the files to include any part of Kanchipuram District, or any village\n(or part thereof) in GA 9.62, or to identify the GAs on the basis of co-\nordinates.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF PNGRB:\n\n210. On the issue of public notices, Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai, Learned\nCounsel for the PNGRB, would submit that reliance placed on the PNGRB\nPublic Notices dated 10.03.2016, 24.02.2018 and 01.03.2018 is misplaced;\nthe notices were not final or determinative, and the Board had sought\ncomments/ views from various stakeholders; \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the\nAuthorization Regulations, even after amendment, remained unchanged\nexcept Schedule A; further, the notices mention about a \"concept\"; the\nconcept of district, was there - district boundary is an important factor to be\nconsidered; however, it was not necessary or mandatory to make the\nboundary of an administrative district as the boundary of the GA; and the GA\nboundary may vary from the administrative district boundary.\n\n C. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n211. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n2nd Respondent, would submit that the appellant has placed reliance on the\nPublic Notices issued by the PNGRB, several years prior to the bidding for\nthe 9th Round, to argue that bidding was based upon 'district' concept to\navoid \"cherry-picking\" and ensure uniform development of CGD network;\nPublic Notices are not 'notification' as per the definition of 'notification'\nprovided in \nSection 2(zb)\n of the PNGRB Act, and do not have the force of\nlaw; pursuant to the issuance of a Public Notice, PNGRB invites comments/\nsuggestions, if required, from the public at large and takes its final decision\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 146 of 184\n\n only after considering the said comments/ suggestions; thus, as rightly held\nby the PNGRB, Public Notices are not a 'final decision' of the PNGRB; even\notherwise, neither the tender document for the 9th Bidding Round nor the\nAuthorization Regulations refer to the aforesaid Public Notices; a bidder is\nonly expected to study the requirements of the Bid Document and, as held\nby the Supreme Court in \nAdani\n (supra) case, introduction of any\nconsideration/ criteria/ requirement which was not notified to the bidders in\nthe Bid Document would have been illegal and arbitrary; the Public Notice\ndated 10.03.2016, relied upon by the appellant itself, states that the same\nwas for general information, and any input on the said Public Notice may\nbe submitted to the PNGRB; similarly, the Public Notice dated 12.04.2016\nalso states that the PNGRB seeks comments/ views from the stakeholders\nfor consideration; it is, therefore, clear that the aforesaid Public Notices are\nnot final decisions and have no legal force; moreover, the fact that, pursuant\nto the aforesaid Public Notices, PNGRB did not deem it fit to introduce\n'district' concept by way of an amendment to the Authorisation Regulations\nfurther shows that the Public Notices were not final decisions; the Public\nNotice dated 12.04.2016 refers to the unamended Authorization\nRegulations and envisages that the basis for determining a 'specified\ngeographical area' was economic viability and geographical contiguity;\nhowever, on 06.04.2018 i.e. immediately prior to the launch of the 9th CGD\nBidding Round on 12.04.2018, the Authorization Regulations were\namended and 'economic viability' was removed as a criteria; thus, the\nentire basis of the Public Notice dated 12.04.2016 was changed by this\namendment; the Public Notices dated 24.02.2018 and 01.03.2018 also do\nnot help the appellant; these notices nowhere specify that the boundaries\nof any GA are to be as per the 2011 Census data or as per the Survey of\nIndia map; and it is absurd to suggest that the data of Census of 2011 was\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 147 of 184\n\n used as the basis by PNGRB for bidding and development of CGD\nnetworks in the year 2018.\n\n212. Learned Senior Counsel would further submit that the appellant has\nalso relied on the Public Notice dated 24.02.2018 to argue that PNGRB\nhad already finalized the list of GAs to be awarded as part of the 9th Bidding\nRound; however, this is not correct; and a comparison of the indicative list\ngiven by PNGRB with the Public Notice dated 24.02.2018 and the eventual\nGAs put out for bidding would reveal the following:\n\n Remarks on the indicative list\nGA Name (9th Bidding Round)\n given in Public Notice dated\n(Pg. 195 onwards of C-1)\n 24.02.2018.\n\n (Pg. 109 onwards of C-1)\n Navsari District (EAAA), Surat District\n The names of Surat and Tapi are\n (EAAA), Tapi District (EAAA) & the\n Dangs District (GA 9.10) not indicated in Public Notice.\n\n Valsad (EAAA), Dhule & Nashik Valsad (part area) is not mentioned\n Districts (GA 9.39) in the Public Notice.\n\n Dakshina Kannada District (GA 9.28) It was proposed that the Dakshina\n Kannada District will be split in two\n parts. However, it was eventually\n offered as one GA.\n\n The actual GA offered for bidding\n Medak, Siddipet & Sangareddy includes excluded portion of already\n Districts (GA 9.71) authorized GA. However, the same\n is not indicated in the Public Notice.\n The Public Notice envisages East\n Burdwan District (GA 9.86)\n and West Burdwan.\n However, eventually awarded only\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 148 of 184\n\n as a single district.\n\n Karaikal & Nagapattinam Districts Nagapattinam district is\n (GA 9.50) geographically split by Karaikal (UT).\n However, they are awarded\n Cuddalore, Nagapattinam &\n separately with different\n Tiruvarur Districts (GA 9.64)\n combination. This further\n demonstrates that GAs have not\n been awarded on\n 'district' concept.\n The Public Notice only shows only\n Moradabad (EAAA) District (GA 9.83)\n part of Moradabad district, where as\n + the area granted under Regulation\n the GA includes parts of Sambhal\n 18.\n and Amroha\n Districts.\n\n213. The aforesaid instances show that PNGRB never intended that the\nindicative list released as part of the Public Notice of 24.02.2018 would be\nfinal or that it would restrict PNGRB from making any changes to the\nauthorized area before bidding.\n\n D. ANALYSIS:\n\n i. PUBLIC NOTICES ISSUED BY THE PNGRB:\n\n214. A public notice was issued by the PNGRB on 10.03.2016, (in\ncontinuation of its earlier public notice dated 08.09.2014), wherein it was\nstated that a tentative list of all possible upcoming CGD Gas, for inclusion in\nthe future rounds of CGD bidding had been identified; as the concept of\nGeographical Area (GA) for CGD bidding was now based upon the district\nconcept so as to avoid cherry-picking and ensure that development of CGD\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 149 of 184\n\n network takes place uniformly in city areas as well as rural areas, the\nidentified list had been prepared. Annexure C-2, to the Public Notice dated\n10.03.2016, is the list of probable GAs en-route upcoming/under-\nimplementation natural gas pipelines which can be considered for future\nCGD bidding depending upon the status of construction of the pipelines, and\nthe details of the probable GAs are furnished in the form of a table. Column\n1 of the said table is the Serial Number, Column 2 relates to the GA (District),\nand Column 3 to the State. At Serial Number 110 of the Table is Thiruvallur\nin the State of Tamil Nadu, Serial Number 111 is Chennai in the State of\nTamil Nadu, and Serial Number 126 is Kancheepuram in the State of Tamil\nNadu.\n\n215. Thereafter, another public notice was issued by the PNGRB on\n12.04.2016, in para 3 of which it was stated that the basis of identifying and\nselecting any GA for inviting bids are as under: (i) GA shall be based upon\ndistrict concept so as to avoid cherry-picking, and to ensure that\ndevelopment of CGD network takes place uniformly in city areas as well as\nrural areas; (iii) There should be natural gas pipeline connectivity to the\nrespective GA so as to ensure gas supply for the proposed CGD network;\nthis may include pipeline connectivity directly through the district GA or in\nclose proximity of the district GA; and (vii) prevalent market conditions in a\nspecific area or sector requiring inclusion of GA for CGD development.\n\n216. The subject of the public notice dated 24.02.2018 was the list of\nGeographical Areas (GAs) for the 9th Round CGD (City Gas Distribution)\nbidding. It was stated therein that, in furtherance to the earlier public notice\ndated 10.03.2016, a list of Geographical Areas had been identified by\nPNGRB for the 9th round of CGD bidding and was enclosed as Annexure-A;\nthe list included a total of 86 Geographical Areas consisting of 156 complete\ndistricts and 18 part-districts; and bids shall be invited on these GAs by\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 150 of 184\n\n March, 2018. Annexure-A thereto is the list of Geographical Areas for the\n9th Round CGD bidding. The table, there-under, has four columns. The first\ncolumn is the Serial No., the second column is the State /UT, the third\ncolumn is the district name, and the fourth column is remarks. At Serial No.\n118 is the State of Tamil Nadu, the corresponding District is shown as\nKanchipuram, and the remarks column is blank. At Serial No. 119 is the\nState of Tamil Nadu, the corresponding District is shown as Chennai and, in\nthe remarks column, it is stated that it is clubbed with Thiruvallur. Likewise,\nat Serial No. 127 is the State of Tamil Nadu, the corresponding District is\nshown as Tiruvallur and, in remarks column, it is stated that it is clubbed with\nChennai.\n\n217. The afore-mentioned table also shows that, in certain GAs, one district\nhas been clubbed with either another District or a part of another District.\nFor instance, at Serial No. 96 of the said table, is the State of Punjab, the\ncorresponding district is Patiala, and the remarks column states that it is\nclubbed with Sangrur and part Mohali (SAS Nagar). It is in this context that\na distinction must be drawn between this GA at Serial No. 96 with the GAs\nreferred to at Serial Nos. 118, 119 and 127. While Chennai District is\nclubbed with Tiruvallur District to form one GA, Kanchipuram GA is\nexclusively with respect to Kanchipuram District, and is not clubbed with any\nother District. The table does not show Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts GA\nbeing clubbed with any part of Kanchipuram District either.\n\n218. A public notice was issued thereafter on 01.03.2018, subsequent to\nthe PNGRB's public notice date 24.02.2018, and a GA-wise list was\nenclosed thereto for reference. Annexure-A to the public notice dated\n01.03.2018 is the list of Geographical Areas for the 9th Round CGD bidding.\nThe table there-under contains four columns: the first is the Serial Number,\nthe second is the State /UT, the third is the Geographical Areas, and the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 151 of 184\n\n fourth is the District Name. At Serial Number 61 of the said table is the State\nof Tamil Nadu, the corresponding Geographical Area is shown as\nKanchipuram District, and the District Name is shown as Kanchipuram. At\nSerial Number 62, Column 2 refers to the State of Tamil Nadu, at column 3\nthe Geographical Area is shown as Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts, and at\ncolumn 4, the districts are shown as Chennai and Tiruvallur. No reference\nis made therein to the Chennai and Thiruvallur Districts GA containing any\npart of Kanchipuram District.\n\n219. It is not just the earlier Public Notices dated 10.03.2016 and\n12.04.2016 which state that the GA shall be based upon district concept,\neven the table annexed to the Public Notices dated 24.02.2018 and\n01.03.2018 clearly show that, while Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts GA\ncomprised of the two complete districts of Chennai and Tiruvallur, the\nKanchipuram District GA comprised only of the entire Kanchipuram District.\n\n ii. TENDER & WORK ORDER ISSUED FOR\n PREPARATION OF MAPS:\n\n220. Tender dated 18.01.2018 was issued by the PNGRB inviting bids for\nhiring of vendors for supplying customized and interactive maps. Section-I\nthereof is the instructions to bidders. Section-II relates to the scope of the\nwork and the time schedules. Clause 17 there-under relates to the scope of\nwork. Clause 17.1 stipulates that it was proposed to award a rate contract\nfor a period of two years for providing the following integrated Networks and\nGeographical Area Maps. Clause 17.1.1 refers to the repository of\ngeographical area maps of existing/proposed CGD networks across India;\nand the repository of Geographical Area maps for approximately 100 Gas. It\nis stated that the task includes preparation of individual GA maps depicting\nTaluka/Tehsil/Mandal as charge areas and pointing important towns/cities,\nDistrict HQ and National/State Highways on the map; and output required in\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 152 of 184\n\n WGS, JPG, PDF and Auto card formats along with 5 prints each of A1 size.\nClause 17.1.1.1 states that, based on these maps, PNGRB proposed to float\nfurther bids for authorization for CGD networks in India; during this period,\nmaps shall be required for approximately 100 geographical area/districts;\nhowever, the quantum of work required may vary to any extent and no claim\non this account shall be admissible. Clause 17.1.1.2 requires the bidder to\ntake into account all the points explicitly stated, as well as those that shall\nbe required to produce the output as required and stated. The detailed scope\nof work is as under: (a) The geographical data used by the vendor to prepare\nthe maps should not be more than 2 year old; complete geo-referencing has\nto be provided in the supplied maps with standard cartographic symbology\nand colours; (b) the submissions shall have customized layouts printed on\nA1 sheets (3 sets) at an appropriate scale (minimum 1:10,000) in colour; all\nNH/SH and major roads and area segments, such as residential,\ncommercial, industrial, forest land /green area in urban /rural areas, are to\nbe indicated in the maps with their names; the vendor shall collect details of\nall administrative divisions such as Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal etc, and indicate\nthem in the maps supplied; the accuracy level of the maps at this level shall\nbe within 20 m and certain additional landmarks/ details may be required to\nbe added besides removal of other details; (c) the population data of the\narea is to be provided and shall be authenticated with the source details\n(Census 2011 or later); (e) while taking outputs, a strip of maximum width of\n15 cm should be left on the right side to be used for title, legends, scale,\ntables and other details as desired by PNGRB; the rest of the sheet shall\nindicate the actual map leaving a strip of only 1\" from all edges; (f)\nsubmissions shall also be in the form of geo-referenced .shp files projected\nin WGS formats besides JPG and PDF formats along with 5 prints each of\nA1 size; (g) the vendor shall guarantee the accuracy of the details provided\nin each map to a level as specified; in case inaccuracies are reported by\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 153 of 184\n\n PNGRB within six months of receiving final deliverables for a city/\ngeographical area, the vendor will rectify the same and provide fresh prints\nand submissions at no extra cost within a period of 10 working days.\n\n221. Clause 17.1.1.3 stipulates that the vendor shall provide necessary\nauthorization to PNGRB to use the map for its bidding as well as monitoring\npurposes; this will include adding more information to the maps later on, and\nsharing the maps with other agencies for project implementation and\nmonitoring purposes; no term of such authorization can be in conflict with\nthe terms and conditions of the tender; and the vendor shall also indemnify\nPNGRB from any legal implications arising from use of such maps for the\nafore-said purposes.\n\n222. Thereafter, the scope of work for online GIS integration of oil and gas\npipeline data is specified to include, (1) overlaying of GA maps prepared\nunder clause 17.1.1 on interactive maps of India; (2) overlaying of pipeline\nnetwork prepared under clauses 17.1.2 and 17.1.3 on the interactive maps\nof India; (3) integration of attribute information on pipelines, locations and\nothers provided by PNGRB; (4) development of web based GIS interface for\nvisualization of oil and gas pipelines; (5) develop an interface on GIS\nframework for users to filter information on pipelines, locations, GA maps,\nNGP, PPP, CGD with various options; and (6) integrate the GIS interface\nwith the PNGRB web site under desired section as hypertext link with\nsecured authentication.\n\n223. It is clear from the aforesaid tender dated 18.01.2018, that the\nBoard intended the task, entrusted to the map vendors, to include\npreparation of individual GA maps depicting Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal as charge\nareas, and pointing important towns/cities, District HQ and National/State\nHighways on the map.; and the map vendor was required to collect details\nof all administrative divisions such as Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal etc, and indicate\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 154 of 184\n\n them in the maps supplied; the population data of the area was to be\nprovided and was required be authenticated with the source details (Census\n2011 or later);\n\n224. Tender dated 18.01.2018 makes it clear that the Board intended for\nTaluka/Tehsil/Mandal to be depicted as charge areas; and the population\ndata of the area was to be provided and authenticated with the source details\nie Census 2011 or later. As the last official Census was only the 2011\nCensus, the population and area details have evidently been taken by Map\nVendor therefrom. As Talukas were to be depicted as charge areas, and as\nit is evident that the sum total of the 11 charge areas constituted the\nKanchipuram District GA and the sum total of these 11 talukas constituted\nthe then Kanchipuram District, it is clear that the Kanchipuram District GA is\nco-terminus with the then Kanchipuram District.\n\n225. A work order was issued by the PNGRB to M/s. ML Infomap Private\nLimited on 23.03.2018 requesting them to develop 59 Geographical Area\nmaps enclosed as Annexure-A. Annexure-A to the said letter is a table\ncontaining 8 columns. Column No. 1 is the Serial Number, Column No. 2 is\nthe State/Union Terrirory, Column No. 3 is the GA, Column No. 4 is the name\nof the district, and Column No. 5 is the area in square kilometres. Details of\nthe other columns need not be referred to as they are not relevant for the\npurposes of this Appeal. At Serial Number 61 of the said table is the State\nof Tamil Nadu, the corresponding GA is shown as Kanchipuram District GA,\nthe corresponding district name is shown as Kanchipuram district, and the\narea in square kilometres is shown as 4483 square kilometres. At Serial\nNumber 62 of the said table is the State of Tamil Nadu, the corresponding\nGA is shown as Chennai and Thiruvallur district GA, the corresponding name\nof the district is shown as Chennai and Thiruvallur, and the area in square\nkilometres is shown as 3569 sq.kms.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 155 of 184\n\n 226. It is clear from this work order that the PNGRB intended to have maps\nprepared on the basis of the Districts, for not only does the table contain the\nnames of the Districts which are shown as Kanchipuram, Chennai &\nTiruvallur, the corresponding area in square kilometres also tallies with the\ntotal area in square kilometres of the then Districts of Kanchipuram, Chennai\nand Tiruvallur. The 2011 Census records the area of Chennai District as 175\nsquare kilometres, and the area of Tiruvallur District as 3394 square\nkilometres i.e a total of 3569 square kilometres, which tallies with the area in\nsquare kilometres as shown in the afore-said table, as also in the map of\nGA.9.62. Likewise, the area in square kilometres of Kanchipuram district, in\nthe table annexed to the work order dated 23.03.2018, is shown as 4732\nsquare kilometres, which is the area mentioned not only in the authorisation\nmap, but also the area of the then Kanchipuram district as per Census 2011.\n\n iii. DOCUMENTS FROM THE ORIGINAL RECORDS OF\n THE PNGRB:\n\n227. The original records of the PNGRB, in relation to the subject dispute,\nwere placed for our perusal. The record contains, among others, Board\nAgenda No. Infra/CGD/Bid-9th Round/01/2018 of February, 2018 which\nrelates to finalisation of GAs for the 9th CGD bidding round. Para 4 of the\nsaid Agenda Note records that, based on the inputs received from various\nstakeholders and internal deliberations, a list of 86 Gas, which comprised of\n156 full districts and 18 part districts from 22 States and UTs, had been\nprepared and the list was enclosed as Annexure 1. Para 6 of the said agenda\nnote records that the amendments, in CGD Authorisation Regulations, was\nat an advanced stage of finalisation; an amendment to the CGD\nAuthorisation Regulations was targeted to be finalised by 28.02.2018 for\nlegal vetting; in addition, the tender for hiring an agency for customized maps\nwas under technical evaluation, and was expected to be awarded soon.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 156 of 184\n\n 228. Annexure 1 to the afore-said Agenda Note contains the list of GAs for\nthe 9th Round CGD bidding, and the table thereunder contains four columns.\nThe first is the Serial No; the second is the State/Union Territory; the third is\nthe name of the district, and the fourth is the remarks column. At Serial. No.\n118 of the Table is the State of Tamil Nadu, the district is shown as\nKanchipuram, and the remarks column is blank. At Serial No. 119 of the table\nis the State of Tamil Nadu, the district is shown as Chennai, and in the\nremarks column it is stated that it is clubbed with Tiruvallur. At Serial No. 127\nis the State of Tamil Nadu, the district is shown as Tiruvallur and, in the\nremarks column, it is stated that it is clubbed with Chennai. This Agenda\nNote also makes it clear that Kanchipuram GA was to be the Kanchipuram\nDistrict, and Chennai & Tiruvallur GA was to comprise of two whole districts\nof Chennai and Tiruvallur.\n\n229. The PNGRB informed ML Infomap Pvt. Limited, vide letter dated\n12.03.2018, that they were pleased to award them the contract for item No.\n1 as per the following schedule of rates for each part and subject to all the\nterms and conditions contained in the tender documents. Serial No. 1\ncontains the item details and the rates quoted. It refers to the repository of\ngeographical area maps for approximately 100 Gas. The task includes\npreparation of individual GA maps depicting Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal as charge\nareas, and pointing important town/cities, District HQ and National/State\nHighways on the map as per clause 17.1.1 and the output was required in\nWGS, JPS and PDF formats along with 5 prints each of AI size.\n\n230. The PNGRB informed ML Informap Pvt. Ltd, vide letter dated\n23.03.2018, that they should develop 59 GA maps, and the maps enclosed\nas Annexure A immediately. Annexure A has 8 columns. The first is the Serial\nNo; the second is the State/Union Territory; the third is the GA; the fourth is\nthe district name; the fifth is the area in sq. kms; the sixth is the rate; the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 157 of 184\n\n seventh is the company to which contract was awarded, and the eighth\nrelates to the cost. At Serial No.61, of the table in Annexure-A, is the State\nof Tamil Nadu, the corresponding GA area is referred to as Kanchipuram\ndistrict, the corresponding district name is shown as Kanchipuram, and the\ncorresponding area is shown 4483 sq. kms. At Serial No. 62 in the State of\nTamil Nadu, the corresponding GA area is referred to as Chennai and\nTiruvallur districts, the corresponding district names are shown as Chennai-\nTiruvallur, and the corresponding area is shown as 3569 square kms.\n\n231. From the aforesaid details also, it is clear that the Board intended for\nmaps to be prepared for GAs 9.61 and 9.62 on the basis of the respective\ndistricts in its entirety and not a part thereof, for if the Board had intended to\ninclude a part of Kanchipuram District in Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts GA,\nand exclude such part from the Kanchipuram District GA, it would have made\nit clear in the said letter.\n\n232. A summary sheet, of the GAs offered in the 9th CGD Round, are\ndetailed in pages 399-402 of File No. AUTC/CGD/GA/List/GA/GAIL/17-18.\nThe said summary sheet is in the form of a table containing 11 columns. The\nfirst column relates to the GA. ID; the second column relates to the State/UT;\nthe third column relates to the GA, the fourth column relates to the name of\nDistrict; the fifth column contains details of the households; the sixth column\ncontains details of the population; the seventh column contains details of the\narea in square kms; the eighth column relates to the bid bond (in Rs.), the\nninth column relates to the minimum net worth (in Rs. Crores), the tenth\ncolumn relates to the Performance Bank Guarantee (Rs. in Crores), and the\neleventh column relates to the Application fee.\n\n233. At Srl. No. 61, of the table in the summary sheet, is the State of Tamil\nNadu, the corresponding name of the GA is shown as Kanchipuram district,\nthe corresponding name of the district is shown as Kanchipuram, the\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 158 of 184\n\n corresponding number of households is shown as 10,06,245, the\ncorresponding population is shown as 39,98,252, the corresponding area in\nsquare kms is shown as 4482.00 sq. kms, and the corresponding bid bond\nis shown as Rs. 3,00,00,000. At Serial. No. 62, of the table in the summary\nsheet, is the State of Tamil Nadu, the corresponding GA is shown as\nChennai-Tiruvallur, the corresponding name of the district is shown as\nChennai-Tiruvallur, the corresponding number of households are shown as\n21,01,931, the corresponding population is shown as 83,74,836, the\ncorresponding area in square kms. is shown as 3569 square kms, and the\nbid bond is shown as Rs. 8,37,48,360. From the name, number of\nhouseholds, population and area in sq kms of the respective GAs, as\nreflected in the afore-said table, it is evident that the Board intended to\ndetermine the boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 on the basis of the\ncorresponding Kanchipuram District and Chennai & Tiruvallur Districts.\n\n234. The Board Note dated 09.04.2018, signed by the Secretary of the\nBoard and Member (I&T), records that, subsequent to the Board approval\ndated 05.04.2018, a reference copy of the ACBD was web-hosted on the\nPNGRB site; the Board has already approved 86 GAs for the 9th round CGD\nbidding; and, once the amended CGD authorization Regulations are notified,\nthe bid for the same shall be invited through e-portal. The said note also\nrecords that customised maps for the 86 GAs were received from M/s ML\nInfomap and M/s Samvridhi along with the summary sheet showing GA-wise\narea, population, bid bond, PBG and application fee, which was being placed\nfor approval. In the table given there-under reference is made to Shimla,\nSolan and Sirmaur GA in the District of Shimla which was proposed to be\nmerged with certain charge areas. The said table also refers to Bilaspur,\nHamirpur and Una GA in Bilaspur District which was also proposed to be\nmerged with certain other charge areas. The Board Note thereafter records\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 159 of 184\n\n that, after approval, M/s ML Infomap would be communicated to modify the\nGeographical Area map for the aforesaid GAs.\n\n235. It does appear from the said Board Note dated 09.04.2018, signed by\nthe Secretary of the Board and Member (I&T), that the Board did not modify\nthe Geographical Area maps of GAs 9.61 and 9.62. From the public notices,\nthe tender and work order issued to the map vendor, the correspondence\nbetween the Board and the Map Vendor, and the Board Notes, it is evident\nthat, what the Board intended to fix as the boundaries of GA 9.61 are the\nboundaries of the then Kanchipuram District. What none of the parties to\nthese appellate proceedings have acknowledged, evidently in their own\ninterest, is that, while the Board had all through intended for GA 9.61 to be\nco-terminus with the then Kanchipuram District, the map vender had erred\nin fixing the co-ordinates of this GA and GA 9.62 ie Chennai-Tiruvallur\nDistricts GA, which has resulted in these 19 CNG stations being erroneously\nshown as falling within the co-ordinates of GA 9.62, though they are in fact\nlocated within the boundaries of the then Kanchipuram District as it existed\njust prior to GO dated 04.01.2018, which is co-terminus with Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA.\n\n236. Pursuant to the Board Note dated 09.04.2018, signed by the Secretary\nof the Board and Member (I&T), a draft public notice dated 11.04.2018 was\nprepared for inviting electronic bids from interested parties for development\nand CGD networks in 86 (wrongly stated in the note as 80) Geographical\nAreas. The draft public notice states that details of the Geographical Areas\nand bids were available at the PNGRB website. Attached thereto is a\nsummary sheet ie a table containing 11 columns. The first column is the GA\nID, the second column is the State/ Union Territory, the third column is the\nGeographical Area, the fourth column is the District's name, the fifth column\nrelates to households, the sixth column relates to population, the seventh\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 160 of 184\n\n column relates to the area in sq. km., the eighth column relates to the Bid\nBond in Rupees, the ninth column relates to the minimum networth in\nRupees/ crores, the tenth column relates to the performance bank guarantee\n(in Rupees/crores), and the eleventh column relates to the application fee.\nAt Serial No. 61 of the said table is the State of Tamil Nadu. The\ncorresponding GA is shown as Kanchipuram District, the name of the\ncorresponding District is shown as Kanchipuram, the corresponding number\nof households is shown as 10,06,245, the corresponding population is\nshown as 39,98,252, the corresponding area in sq. km. is shown as 4483\nsq.km., the corresponding Bid Bond is shown as 3 crores, the corresponding\nminimum networth is shown as 100 crores, the corresponding performance\nbank guarantee is shown as 33 crores, and the corresponding application\nfee is shown as 12 lakhs. At Serial No. 62 of the said table is the State of\nTamil Nadu, the corresponding GA is shown as Chennai and Tiruvallur\nDistrict, the corresponding name of the District is shown as Chennai and\nTiruvallur, the corresponding number of households is shown as 21,01,931,\nthe corresponding population is shown as 83,74,836, the corresponding\narea in sq.km. is shown as 3569, the corresponding Bid Bond is shown as\n8,37,48,360, the corresponding minimum networth is shown as 249 crores,\nthe corresponding performance bank guarantee is shown as 50 crores, and\nthe corresponding application fee is shown as 12 lakhs.\n\n237. The Appellant's claim that these figures match the details furnished on\nthe right side of the map in both GAs 9.61 and 9.62 (Annexure 1 to the\nACBD) seems justified. Just a day thereafter, a public notice was issued on\n12.04.2018 inviting electronic bids from interested parties for development\nof CGD networks in 86 Geographical Areas which included Gas 9.61 and\n9.62.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 161 of 184\n\n 238. It is evident from the Board Note dated 09.04.2018 (signed by both the\nSecretary and Member (I&T) of the Board and prepared just three days\nbefore the application-cum-bid documents were web-hosted on 12.04.2018),\nthat the Board did not modify the Geographical Area maps prepared by the\nmap vendor with respect to GAs 9.61 and 9.62. Just as the Appellant had\nsubmitted its application in Schedule C on the basis of the map given by the\nPNGRB, so had the 2nd Respondent submitted its application in Schedule C\non the basis of the map given by the PNGRB for GA 9.62, without raising\nany objection to the information provided on the right side of the map,\nbesides the particulars mentioned on the physical map itself (details of which\nhave been referred to earlier in this Order).\n\n239. The doctrine of estoppel, would not bar this Tribunal from inquiring into\nthe actual identification exercise undertaken by the PNGRB to determine the\nboundaries of the GAs, more so in the light of the evident error which\nappears to have been committed by the map vendor, in fixing the co-\nordinates of each of these two GAs. Thereafter, a public notice was prepared\non 11.04.2018 and was placed on the website of the PNGRB on 12.04.2018.\nIt is stated, in the said public notice, that details of GAs and bids are available\nat the PNGRB's website.\n\n240. As noted hereinabove the public notices issued by the PNGRB prior to\nthe issuance of Application-cum-Bid Document, the tender issued inviting\nbids for preparation of maps, the work order issued to the map vendor and\nthe Board note dated 09.04.2018 signed by the Secretary and Member (I&T)\nof the Board, support the contention of the Appellant that the Board intended\nto invite applications for GA 9.61 and GA 9.62, both of which were specified\non the basis of the respective Districts to which they corresponded. While\nthe Board was, undoubtedly, entitled, even after issuance of the said public\nnotices, to have consciously decided, for reasons to be recorded in writing,\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 162 of 184\n\n to determine the boundaries of the GAs on any basis other than that of a\nDistrict, neither the material placed on record in these appellate proceedings\nnor the original records placed for our perusal by the Board, show that the\nBoard having intended to deviate, or to have actually deviated, from its\nearlier decision that bids for GA 9.61 and GA 9.62 should be invited on the\nbasis of the respective Districts. As there is no material on record to show\nthat the Board had consciously decided to include a part of the then\nKanchipuram District in GA. 9.62, it does appear that the apparent error of\nthe map vendor, in fixing the co-ordinates so as to correspond with the\nrespective districts to which GAs 9.61 and 9.62 related to, went un-noticed\nby the Board as also the parties to these proceedings before an authorization\nwas granted for GA 9.61 in favour of the Appellant, and for GA 9.62 in favour\nof the second Respondent.\n\n241. The material on record does not also show that the Board ever having\nintended to determine the boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 merely on the\nbasis of co-ordinates, nor does it show the Board to have held the other\ninformation, furnished in the maps annexed to the authorization granted to\nGAs 9.61 and 9.62, to be erroneous. We find force in the submission, urged\non behalf of the Appellant, that what the Board intended in stipulating the\nboundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 were the boundaries of the then existing\nDistricts of Kanchipuram, Chennai and Tiruvallur.\n\n242. The public notices issued by the Board, from time to time, are not\nnotifications under \nSection 2(zb)\n of the PNGRB Act, but notices issued by\nthe Board in the discharge of its statutory obligation, under \nSection 19(1)\n\nof the PNGRB Act, to give wide publicity of its intention to invite applications\nfor laying, building, operating or expanding a city or local natural gas\ndistribution network in a specified Geographical Area.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 163 of 184\n\n 243. While it is true that the bidders would go by the Application-cum-Bid\nDocument in submitting their bids, the ACBD itself requires the bidders to\nmake themselves aware of the 2008 Regulations as well as the contents of\nthe map in Annexure 1 of the bid documents. \nThe PNGRB Act\n and the 2008\nRegulations have left it to the discretion of the Board to determine the\nmanner in which the contours or the boundaries of the GA should be\ndetermined. While the amended Schedule A requires the Board to bear in\nmind the factors stipulated therein while determining the GA, it does not\nexpressly stipulate as to how the GA boundaries should be actually\ndetermined. Since \nSection 19\n of the PNGRB Act and the 2008 Regulations\nrequire the PNGRB to specify the geographical area, and only thereafter to\ninvite bids for each of the specified GAs, what the Board ought to have been\ndone was to clearly identify the GAs for which the bids were proposed to be\ninvited before web-hosting the ACBD on 12.04.2018. Failure of the Board to\nexercise greater caution in specifying the GA has resulted in this avoidable\nlitigation. In the light of the judgement of the Supreme Court, in Adani Gas\nLimited, it may not be appropriate for us to examine the contentions, urged\non behalf of the second Respondent, with respect to GAs which are neither\nthe subject matter of the present appeal nor are the successful bidders of\nsuch GAs parties to the present proceedings.\n\n244. We find force in the submission of Mr. Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, that the Board has not been\nable to show which part of the Kanchipuram District and the Talukas/Villages\ntherein were included in GA 9.62, if so when, and pursuant to which decision\ntaken by the Board. The material on record does not also disclose any such\nconscious decision having been taken by the Board, much less any such\ndecision having been communicated to the map vendors pursuant to the\naward of contract in their favour. The records summoned from the Board\ndisclose that the contract awarded to M L Infomap Pvt Ltd, with respect to\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 164 of 184\n\n GAs 9.61 and 9.62, required them to depict Talukas/Tehsils/Mandals as\ncharge area, and to indicate the towns and cities. As the talukas or tehsils or\nmandals are all sub-divisions of a district, and it is the sum total of all the\ntalukas in a district which constitute the said district, it is evident that the map\nvendor was called upon to prepare maps for GAs 9.61 and 9.62 on the basis\nof the districts of Kanchipuram and Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts. The\ntable attached to the work order given to the map vendor makes it\nabundantly clear that the Board intended to have maps prepared for GAs\n9.61 and 9.62 on the basis of the respective districts of Kanchipuram,\nChennai & Tiruvallur, neither more nor less.\n\n245. The exercise undertaken by us was to ascertain what the Board\nintended to and had actually constituted as the boundaries of GAs 9.61 and\n9.62, whether the Board intended that GA 9.61 should be confined to\nKanchipuram District and GA 9.62 to Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts or whether\nthe Board intended to include a part of Kanchipuram District in Chennai-\nTiruvallur Districts GA. It is pursuant to this exercise undertaken by us that\nvarious factors have been taken into consideration, one among which is\napproval of the maps submitted by the map vendors. As the Board could well\nhave decided to deviate from the map submitted by the map vendor (which\napart from the co-ordinates, contains several other details all of which\nindicate that GAs 9.61 and 9.62 were co-terminus with Kanchipuram District\nand Chennai-Tiruvallur District), we also sought to satisfy ourselves as to\nwhether the Board, after receipt of the maps from the map vendor and\nbefore issuing the Application-cum-Bid Document on 12.04.2018, had taken\na conscious decision to deviate from the map submitted by the map vendor.\nIt is in such circumstances that we had to examine, in detail, various aspects\nincluding the process undertaken by the Board in approving the maps\nsubmitted by the map vendor.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 165 of 184\n\n 246. It does not stand to reason that the Board, against whose order an\nappeal lies to this Tribunal, should be heard to contend that the process of\napproving the maps, submitted by the map vendor, is beyond the jurisdiction\nof this Tribunal. In this context, it is necessary to note that \nSection 33(1)\n of\nthe PNGRB Act enables a person, aggrieved by an order or decision made\nby the Board under the \nPNGRB Act\n, to prefer an appeal before this Tribunal\nand \nSection 33(3)\n confers powers on this Tribunal, on receipt of such an\nappeal under \nSection 33(1)\n and after giving the parties an opportunity of\nbeing heard, to pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit. An appeal before\nthis Tribunal, under \nSection 33(1)\n of the PNGRB Act, is an appeal both on\nfacts and law, and is, in effect, a continuation of the original proceeding\nbefore the Board. The jurisdiction conferred on this Tribunal under \nSection\n33(3)\n, to adjudicate the appeal, is extremely wide and, in the exercise of this\njurisdiction, it is always open to this Tribunal not only to consider the material\non record which form part of the appellate proceedings, but also to summon\nand examine the relevant records of the PNGRB. While it is true that both\nthe Appellant and the second Respondent have made it clear that they are\nnot seeking to have the entire bidding process set aside, and their dispute is\nconfined only to the 19 CNG sub-stations, this lengthy and elaborate\nexercise undertaken by us is only to ascertain whether these 19 CNG\nstations, which all admittedly fell within the then Kanchipuram District, was\nintended by the Board to be made part of the Kanchipuram GA ie GA 9.61\nor as part of Chennai-Tiruvallur Districts GA ie GA 9.62.\n\n XXIV. DETERMINATION OF THE SUBJECT GAs ON THE BASIS\n OF DISTRICTS:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 166 of 184\n\n 247. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that the appellant's case was that (i) the statutory\nscheme, when read with the regulatory determination made by the Board,\nrequired that the GA is based on the district concept and the sub-districts\n(Taluka/ Tehsil/ Mandal) should form its Charge Areas; in the present case,\nthe public consultation, the determination of the GAs and the evaluation of\nbids, were all on the basis of GA 9.61 comprising of the entire district of\nKanchipuram, and GA. 9.62 comprising entirely of the districts of Chennai\nand Tiruvallur; no decision was ever taken by the Board to include any part\nof Kanchipuram District, let alone any part of the talukas or villages of\nKanchipuram District in GA 9.62 and vice-versa; this constitutes the\nbackground context of the contract between the parties. (2) the text of the\ncontract between the parties, i.e. the authorisation, also clearly show that\nthese are authorisation for the respective districts. The authorisation for GA\n9.61 issued to the Appellant includes the concerned talukas and the towns/\nvillages in which the concerned CNG stations are located, while the\nauthorization for GA 9.62 given to the 2nd Respondent does not. (3) the\naction of the Board, and the subsequent conduct and dealings of the parties\nat every stage, also show that they understood and represented that the GAs\nwere co-terminus with the respective districts; and (4) the \"coordinates test\"\n\nis not applicable in the facts of the present case.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n248. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that the appellant's contention that the\nauthorization of a GA has been granted by PNGRB on 'district' concept, and\nthat too linked to Census 2011, is wrong and misleading; a bidder is only\nconcerned with what was included in the Bid Document, and introduction of\nany consideration/ criteria/ requirement which was not notified to the bidders\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 167 of 184\n\n in the Bid Document is not permissible; there was no mention whatsoever in\nthe Bid Document that the GAs will be awarded on 'district' concept or on the\nbasis of the Survey of India map; the GA boundary is the area / region\ndepicted by the map with geo-coordinates as provided by the PNGRB, and\nfor which the bid had been invited by the PNGRB for the development of the\nCGD network; on the other hand, the concept of a district boundary is only\nfor administration purposes, and the district boundary does not have any\nsanctity under the \nPNGRB Act\n and the Authorization Regulations; \nRegulation\n2(1)(c)\n of the Authorization Regulations makes it clear that the specified\ngeographical area could be a combination of administrative demarcations in\nentirety or in part thereof; therefore, a specified GA could be a culmination of\ntwo areas falling in different districts; in fact, this position is undisputed since,\neven according to the appellant, \"it was never the contention of the Appellant\nthat the Board is not empowered to demarcate a Geographical Area\ncomprising of parts of one or more districts\"; further, when PNGRB amended\nthe Authorization Regulations in 2018 immediately prior to the 9th Bidding\nRound, it did not introduce the 'district' concept in the Regulations; this\nshows that the PNGRB never intended to follow the 'district' concept while\nawarding GAs; merely because the GA is named 'Kanchipuram District'\ncannot and does not mean that the entire/ full district has been granted to\nthe appellant; in the authorization granted by the PNGRB, the appellant's\nown GA is named \"Kanchipuram Districts\" (i.e. with an 's') whereas the map\nfor GA No. 9.61 only refers to the GA as \"Kanchipuram District\"; in other\nwords, nomenclature is irrelevant and the map given at the time of bidding\nwill prevail over any other consideration; even otherwise, the demarcation of\nthe boundary of a district is at the discretion of the State Government, and\nmay undergo a change with time; as an example, India is reported to have\nmore than 770 districts presently, whereas this number was around 640\ndistricts as per the Census of 2011 and 593 districts in the 2001 Census;\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 168 of 184\n\n further, even Chennai District was enlarged by the Government of Tamil Nadu\nbefore the start of the bid vide Government Order (\"GO\") dated 04.01.2018,\nand several villages/ areas falling in Kanchipuram district have been carved/\nbrought within the Chennai district; even in the case of Kanchipuram, the\ndistrict has been split between Kanchipuram district and Chengalpattu district\npost the award of the GA to the appellant; on the contrary, the boundary of\nthe GA (as depicted in the authorization letter issued by the PNGRB) remains\nthe same, and does not change even if there is a split or merger of district(s)\nafter the GA is awarded to a CGD entity; without prejudice to the aforesaid\nsubmissions, even if it is assumed (without any admission whatsoever) that\nthe PNGRB had intended to adopt the 'district' concept for the 9th bidding\nround (which it has not), PNGRB will have to follow a logical basis of\ndetermination of the district, wherein the said district would necessarily have\nto be the administrative demarcation as notified by the respective State\nGovernment as on the date of advertisement of inviting the bids for the 9th\nRound by PNGRB in April 2018 and not any arbitrary date; this is because\nfirstly, as a concept, 'district' is neither defined in the statute nor in the rules\nor the bidding document; it is absurd to suggest that the district prevailing in\nthe year 2011 was used as the basis by PNGRB for bidding and development\nof CGD networks in the year 2018, since several administrative and other\ndemographic changes had taken place across India between 2011-\n2018; Secondly, the principle that the 2011 Census /area are not relevant\nhas been recognized by the Supreme Court itself in its judgment in the \nAdani\n\n(supra) matter; therefore, selection of district could not have been arbitrary\nand the demarcation that happened by way of a Government notification,\nbefore the notification of the advertisement inviting the bids and even before\nthe tender for selection of vendors to prepare the maps was awarded, could\nnot have been disregarded; if the argument of the appellant, that the district\nboundary was to be kept as the GA were to be accepted, it would lead to\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 169 of 184\n\n chaos and uncertainty in determining the GA boundary; the appellant has\nalso relied upon the communication received from PNGRB on 23.09.2021 to\nclaim that the maps of Survey of India/ local authorities are relevant for\nascertaining the GA boundary; however, the appellant is twisting the letter\nfrom PNGRB out of context; vide letter dated 17.08.2021, the appellant had\nrequested the PNGRB to provide \"digital map clearly showing the\nadministrative boundaries of the Kanchipuram District GA (ID- 9.61) for\ndetailed planning and development of infrastructure\"; in response to the\naforesaid letter, PNGRB clarified, vide letter dated 23.09.2021, that it had\nalready provided a GIS map indicating the respective GA area and\nboundaries with the authorization letter; PNGRB further clarified that the\ndistrict boundaries within the GAs are considered to be defined by the Survey\nof India/ Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India or\nthe respective local authority such as district administration; and PNGRB\nnowhere suggested that GAs had been awarded on 'district' concept.\n\n249. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel, would also submit that the\nappellant has also argued that the primary source considered by PNGRB for\nidentification of geographical areas is not co-ordinates but the 2011 District\nCensus Handbook; Firstly, this argument has already been considered and\nrejected by the Supreme Court in the Adani judgment; Secondly, the\nappellant's stand in this case is inconsistent with its own stand in the past;\nbefore this Tribunal as well as the Supreme Court in the Adani litigation, the\nappellant itself argued (quite rightly) that it was the bidder's responsibility to\nobtain all information related to the gas supply availability and pipeline\nconnectivity and also existing customers, if any, in the specified geographical\narea and the Census of 2011 was never the determining factor for this\npurpose; thus the appellant had itself accepted, inter alia, that the Census of\n2011 was only relevant for the purposes of determining the minimum net\nworth of the bidding entity, and the value of the Performance Bid Bond to be\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 170 of 184\n\n given by the successful bidder to PNGRB; the appellant had also accepted\nthat the reference to Census 2011 population and household numbers in the\nmap were only for giving an idea about population and household numbers\nto the bidders with respect to the map; Thirdly, even the tender document\nissued by PNGRB for the supply of customized and interactive maps\nnowhere mentions that the vendor shall place reliance on the Survey of India\nmaps or on the district boundary as per the 2011 Census; in fact, a perusal\nof the scope of work of the vendor would show that the geographical data\nused by the vendor to prepare the maps could not have been \"more than 2\nyears old\"; had the intention of PNGRB been to make the Census of 2011 as\nthe basis for identifying the GA, it would not have inserted this condition in\nthe tender document; it is absurd to suggest that the data of Census of 2011\nwas used as the basis by the PNGRB for bidding and development of CGD\nnetworks in the year 2018; the appellant has also placed reliance on the 2011\nCensus data to argue that the same matches with the data given in the legend\nof the PNGRB map, the GA is based on 'descriptive' concept, and the map\nissued by the Board is descriptive (as it provides the district boundary, charge\nareas, villages/towns, total area, total population and total household) which\nrepresents the intention of the Board; even this contention was raised and\nrejected by the Supreme Court in the \nAdani Gas\n case; further, the appellant's\nclaim that, if the 'coordinates' test followed by the 2nd Respondent is\naccepted, it would lead to an increase in the total area of GA No. 9.62/\ndecrease in the total area of GA No. 9.61 is also misleading; it is not even\nthe appellant's case that it had physically measured the total area either\nbefore the bid or after accepting the authorization; even otherwise, without\nprejudice to the submission that the Census of 2011 has no relevance in the\ncontext of the present case, there are several cases in the 9th Bidding Round\nwhere the data given in the PNGRB map does not match with the Census of\n2011 data; one such example is the GA of Barmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 171 of 184\n\n Districts (awarded to the appellant) i.e. GA No. 9.55 where the area as per\nthe authorization map was 89,900 sq. km. whereas the total area of Barmer,\nJaisalmer and Jodhpur as per the Census of 2011 is 89,638 sq. km; similarly,\nfor GA No. 9.01 of Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram Districts, the\ntotal area as per the authorization map is 23,650 sq. km. whereas the total\narea of Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram Districts as per the\nCensus of 2011 (District Census Handbook) is 23,537 sq. km.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n250. In the light of what has been held hereinabove, it is evident that the\nPNGRB, in the discharge of its statutory obligations under \nSection 19(1)\n of\nthe PNGRB Act read with \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n, \n5(4)\n, and Schedule-A of the\n2008 Regulations, has determined the boundaries of both the Kanchipuram\nDistrict GA (GA 9.61) and the Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts (GA 9.62) to\nbe co-terminus with the then Kanchipuram District and the then Chennai and\nTiruvallur Districts. The material on record makes it abundantly clear that\nthe Board never intended for any part of the then Kanchipuram District to be\nexcluded from GA 9.61 or to be included in GA 9.62. While every other\nparameter shows that the Board intended for GA 9.61 to be co-terminus with\nthe then Kanchipuram District, and GA 9.62 to be co-terminous with the then\nChennai and Tiruvallur Districts, the error of the map vendor, in failing to\nproperly fix the co-ordinates of both GAs 9.61 and 9.62, that has resulted in\nthis long-drawn litigation between the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent. The\nmaterial on record does not also show the Board ever having intended to\ndetermine the contours of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 on the basis of co-ordinates.\n\n251. While it is true that the map vendor was also directed to provide co-\nordinates, every other information required to be provided in the map clearly\nshow that the Board intended for the maps to be prepared treating GA 9.61\nto be co-terminous with Kanchipuram District, and for GA 9.62 to be treated\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 172 of 184\n\n as co-terminous with Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts. The present dispute\nhas arisen evidently because the Board did not specifically inform the\nbidders of its' having determined the boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 based\non the districts' concept, besides the map vendor's error in fixing the co-\nordinates of both the GAs. Failure on the part of the PNGRB to do so, has\nalso resulted in our having to examine the record in detail to ascertain how\nthe Board has, in fact, determined GAs 9.61 and 9.62, since the exercise of\ndetermination is a statutory obligation to be discharged by the Board in terms\nof the \nPNGRB Act\n and the 2008 Regulations. Since the ACBD itself requires\nbidders to make themselves aware of the \nPNGRB Act\n and the extant\nRegulations, any ambiguity in the map (since the 2nd Respondent contends\nthat, in the light of the co-ordinates, the 19 CNG stations fell within their GAs)\nrequired them to seek clarifications from the Board regarding the apparent\ncontradiction between the co-ordinates on the one hand, and every other\nparameter on the map on the other. The 2nd Respondent chose not to do so,\nand instead proceeded to construct and operate these 19 CNG stations\ndespite being aware that they were physically located in the then\nKanchipuram District, as is evident from the 2nd Respondent's letter\naddressed to the Appellant on 22.02.2022.\n\n252. Determination of the contours of a GA is at the discretion of the Board,\nand it is not necessary for the Board to invariably prescribe the boundaries\nof each GA on the basis of a District, since \nRegulation 2(1)(c)\n of the 2008\nRegulations enables the GA boundary to be determined by the Board on the\nbasis of each district or more or less, or along with any other district in its\nentirety or in part etc. As wide discretion has been conferred on the Board,\nby the extant 2008 Regulations, it was unnecessary for an amendment to be\nmade thereto, that too to curtain the power of the Board requiring it to\ndetermine the GA solely on the basis of a district. While the Board was not\nobligated to fix the boundaries of the GA on the basis of the corresponding\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 173 of 184\n\n district, it has been conferred the power to do so, if it considered it\nappropriate. In the present case, the PNGRB has determined the\nboundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62 on the basis of their respective districts,\nand not beyond.\n\n253. The other contentions, urged under this head, have already been dealt\nwith earlier in this order, and do not bear repetition. Suffice it to hold that the\nimpugned order, dismissing the complaint filed by the Appellant, is contrary\nto the extant statutory provisions and the material on record. and\nnecessitates interference.\n\n XXV. OTHER ISSUES:\n\n 1. ESTOPPEL:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF PNGRB:\n\n254. On the applicability of the principle of estoppel, and on the issue of\nbidder's responsibility to examine the Application Cum Bid Document\n(ACBD) and the Annexure along with it, Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai, Learned\nCounsel for the PNGRB, would submit that the Bid Document for the 9th\nCGD Bidding Round was issued by the Board on 12.04.2018; some of the\nimportant provisions of the Bid Document were as follows: (a) Clause 1.1.1\nof the bid document stated that PNGRB has identified this geographical area\n(GA) considering availability of natural gas and pipeline connectivity in the\nGA or in its vicinity for development of CGD network; (b) Clause 1.1.3 states\nthat it is the bidder's responsibility to obtain all information related to the\npresent gas supply availability and pipeline connectivity and also existing\ncustomers. if any, in the specific GA; (c) Clause 2.1.1 states that the bidder\nis expected to examine all the contents of the Bid Document, including all\ninstructions, terms and conditions and all the regulations of the Board. It\nfurther states that the bid document, together with all its annexures, shall be\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 174 of 184\n\n considered to be read, understood and accepted by the bidder; (d) Clause\n2.1.2 of the Bid Document states that the application-cum-bid document inter\nalia comprises of the following annexures; (e ) Annexure 1 of the ACBD is\nthe Map depicting the Geographical Areas and Charge Areas: The bidder\nshall carefully study the geographical area and charge areas before\nsubmitting their Application-cum-Bid. Importantly, this map includes the\ncoordinates of the GA, and thus the coordinates form an integral part of the\nbid document; (f) the geo-spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are\ngiven in the map provided with the Bid Document; the said co-ordinates can\nbe clearly seen from a simple visual inspection of the map; a bare reading\nof the aforesaid provisions of the ACBD make it amply clear that all the\nbidders were required to carefully study the GA and charge areas before\nsubmitting the bid; It is further evident that the Board had provided multiple\nopportunities for the bidders, including the Appellant, to seek clarifications\nwhich they required prior to the bid submission; the point raised in the\ncomplaint, with regard to the map being erroneous, was never raised earlier;\n\nand all other entities have already invested on the basis of the map enclosed\nwith the tender.\n\n255. On the issue of submission of Schedule C, Sri Rahul Sagar Sahai,\nLearned Counsel for the PNGRB, would submit that that the Appellant had\nparticipated for both GAs - Chennai and Kanchipuram; while it was\nsuccessful in Kanchipuram, it was unsuccessful in Chennai where the 2nd\nRespondent had won the bid; Schedule C submitted by the Appellant as\nwell as the 2nd Respondent for Chennai, at the time of bidding, included the\nsame map which was provided by the PNGRB; at no point of time, had the\nAppellant raised the issue that the said map of Kanchipuram GA or Chennai\nGA were defective; the relevant excerpts of Schedule C, submitted by the\nAppellant and the 2nd Respondent for Chennai GA, and by Appellant for\nKanchipuram GA, submitted during oral hearing, the Impugned Judgment\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 175 of 184\n\n deals with the aforementioned issue, and rightly rejects the contention of\nthe Appellant; it mentions that the ACBD issued by PNGRB for the 9th\nBidding Round made it clear that it was the responsibility of the bidder to\ncarefully study the GA and the charge areas before submitting the bid;\nPNGRB further noted that, despite numerous opportunities granted by\nPNGRB to submit any objection, the Appellant herein had not submitted\nany objections with respect to the same; the impugned Judgment is\ncompletely in tune with the provisions laid down under the \nPNGRB Act\n and\nthe Regulations framed thereunder; and there is no illegality or infirmity in\nthe Order passed by the PNGRB so as to warrant interference by this\nTribunal.\n\n B. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n256. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel, would submit that the\nappellant and the 2nd Respondent both participated and submitted their bids\nfor various GAs under the 9th bidding round; the appellant submitted its bid\nfor both GA No. 9.61 as well as 9.62. The respective maps: (i) given by\nPNGRB with the Bid Document for GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62; (ii) enclosed by\nthe appellant with its Schedule C (application-cum-bid) at the time of\nsubmitting its bid for both GAs; and (iii) enclosed with the authorization\nawarded to the appellant for GA No. 9.61 and to the 2nd Respondent for GA\nNo. 9.62 were the same; the appellant succeeded for GA No. 9.61 and\nauthorisation was granted to them on 26.09.2018; the 2nd Respondent was\nsuccessful for GA No. 9.62 and authorisation was granted by PNGRB to\nthem on 07.09.2018; the maps for GA Nos. 9.61 and 9.62 were available in\nthe public domain at the time of bidding and all bidders had access to the\nsame; the appellant, in fact, submitted its bid for both GAs; significantly, the\nappellant did not seek any clarification with respect to the maps for GA Nos.\n9.61 and 9.62 at the time of bidding; the map forming part of the Bid\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 176 of 184\n\n Document was also given with the authorization of the respective GA; this\nmap was accepted by the parties without any objections; further, the\nappellant also submitted its 'Schedule C' documents to PNGRB on the basis\nof the map given by PNGRB without raising any objections; and the appellant\nis, therefore, estopped from raising any objections about the PNGRB map at\nthis stage.\n\n C. ANALYSIS:\n\n257. We are in agreement with the submission, urged on behalf of the\nBoard, that the bidder was required to study the GA and the charge area\nbefore submitting the application cum bid. That does not discharge the\nPNGRB of its statutory obligation to clearly identify the boundaries of the GA\nfor which it intended to invite bids and, thereafter, to grant authorisation for\nthe identified GAs in terms of the Regulations. A reading of the Geographical\nArea and the Charge Areas, as reflected in the map, does appear to show\nthat the Geographical Area No. 9.61 is the same as the Kanchipuram District\nas it existed prior to 04.01.2018 and the boundaries of the Chennai -\n\nTiruvallur district GA corresponded to the boundaries of Chennai and\nTiruvallur districts as it existed prior to 04.01.2018. Accepting the\nsubmission, urged both on behalf of the Board and the 2nd Respondent, that\nthe co-ordinates have been correctly fixed would mean that every other\ninformation referred to hereinabove has been erroneously determined by the\nmap vendor.\n\n258. It is with a view to satisfy ourselves, as to whether this seemingly far-\nfetched submission urged on behalf of the Board and the 2nd Respondent\nwas justified, that we had called for the records to ascertain whether the\nPNGRB had, at any time, consciously decided to include that part of\nKanchipuram GA (where these 19 CNG stations are located) within Chennai\nand Tiruvallur district GAs or to identify the boundaries of both GA 9.61 and\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 177 of 184\n\n 9.62 on the basis of co-ordinates. No such information is discernible from\nthe records placed before us.\n\n259. The doctrine of estoppel by conduct means that where one by words\nor conduct wilfully causes another to believe in the existence of certain state\nof things and induces him to act on that belief, or to alter his own previous\nposition, the former is precluded from averring against the latter a different\nstate of things as existing at that time. The fundamental requirement as to\nestoppel by conduct is that the estoppel must concern an existing state of\nfacts. The second requirement of an estoppel by conduct is that it should be\nunambiguous. Finally, an estoppel cannot be relied on if the result of giving\neffect to it would be something that is prohibited by law. Estoppel is only a\nrule of evidence. (\nSupdt. of Taxes v. Onkarmal Nathmal Trust\n, (1976) 1\nSCC 766). The test of estoppel by conduct of unambiguity and it not being\nprohibited by law is not satisfied in the present case. The Board cannot justify\nits failure to comply with its statutory obligations, in clearly and\nunambiguously determining the boundaries of GA 9.61 and 9.62, seeking\nshelter under this doctrine.\n\n260. We also find it difficult to accept the submission, urged on behalf of the\nPNGRB, that the impugned judgement is in accordance with the provisions\nof the \nPNGRB Act\n and the Regulations made thereunder, or that the\nimpugned order does not suffer from any illegality or infirmity as to warrant\ninterference by this Tribunal.\n\n 2. IS THE APPELLANT INDIRECTLY CHALLENGING THE\n BID PROCESS AND THE MAP GIVEN BY THE PNGRB?\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND\n RESPONDENT:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 178 of 184\n\n 261. Sri Gopal Jain, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\nRespondent, would submit that the appellant is effectively contending that the\nco-ordinates in the map given by the PNGRB be ignored, and the area which\nhas clearly been awarded to the 2nd Respondent be given to the appellant;\nthe appellant's contention has the effect of going behind the bid process after\nit is over and after the authorization has also been validly awarded way back\nin the year 2018; the appellant is estopped from raising any such objections\nat this stage; co-ordinates bring precision and specificity and, if the\ncoordinates of a map are ignored or not followed, it would be virtually\nimpossible to accurately define the boundary of a GA; it would also lead to\nchaos and uncertainty in the exact identification of the GA boundary; the geo-\ncoordinate map is the \"primary basis\" of determination of the boundary of the\nGA, the legends given in the map are subordinate to the map to-scale and,\ntherefore, cannot substitute the primary basis (map to-scale) which fixes the\ncontours of the authorized GA.\n\n B. ANALYSIS:\n\n262. As submitted on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, the Appellant no doubt\ncontends that the co-ordinates given in the map are erroneous, and\ninferentially claims that the said coordinates be ignored. What is left unsaid\nby the 2nd Respondent is that the both the Board and the 2nd Respondent\nare asking us to ignore all other information furnished in the map in\nAnnexure-1. As detailed hereinabove, it is because of these contradictions\nin the map between the co-ordinates on the one hand, and all the other\ninformation reflected in the map on the other, that we had perforce to\nundertake the exercise of ascertaining what the Board had determined, as\nthe boundaries of GAs 9.61 and 9.62, in terms of the provisions of the Act\nand the 2008 Regulations.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 179 of 184\n\n 263. We must express our inability to agree with the submission that, in the\nabsence of co-ordinates, it is impossible to define the boundaries of GAs,\nand are satisfied that what the Board had identified as GAs 9.61 and 9.62\nare the areas covered by the then Kanchipuram district and Chennai &\nTiruvallur districts. There is nothing either in the \nPNGRB Act\n or in the\nRegulations or even in the ACBD to show that the Legends given in the map\nare subordinate to the map to scale. Even if this contention were to merit\nacceptance, the map to scale in Annexure-1 contains the charge area\nboundaries, the name of the Villages with population of 5000 and more which\nindicate that the boundaries of Kanchipuram District GA is co-terminus with\nthe then Kanchipuram District. Further, the district GA boundary, as shown\nin the said map, of each of these two GAs overlap with the GA boundary.\nThese aspects support the Appellant's contention that the GA authorised in\ntheir favour is the then existing Kanchipuram district.\n\n 3. MISREPRESENTATION BY THE APPELLANT:\n\n A. SUBMISSIONS URGED ON BEHALF OF THE PNGRB:\n\n264. On the issue of facts showing misrepresentation by the Appellant, Sri\nRahul Sagar Sahai, Learned Counsel for the PNGRB, would submit that,\nunlike what has been presented by the Appellant, the Board never stated\nthat the GA in the instant case was based on the district boundary; it was\nwrongly assumed by the Appellant as clearly brought out by the following\nfacts; vide letter dated 17.08.2021, the Appellant sought a \"digital map\"; it\nalso stated that the PNGRB had floated a tender for GIS based GA maps,\nand it could alternatively seek the map from the said agencies; in response,\nthe Board, vide letter dated 23.09.2021, explicitly informed that the GIS map\nindicating the respective GA area and boundaries had already been\nprovided; the district boundaries 'within' the GAs are considered to be as\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 180 of 184\n\n defined by the Survey of India/ office; shockingly, the Appellant completely\nmisrepresented and, vide its letter dated 24.09.2021 to the District Collector,\nsought the district map of Kanchipuram according to Census of India 2011,\nhowever, falsely stated that PNGRB had informed it that along with the\nauthorization a GIS map indicating respective GA area and boundaries has\nalready been provided (the map provided by PNGRB of the Kanchipuram\ndistrict was based on Census of India 2011); It is clear that PNGRB, in its\nletter, had not stated that the map provide by it was based on Census of\nIndia, 2011; the District Collector vide its letter gave the district map of\nKanchipuram district; in yet another case of gross misrepresentation, the\nAppellant wrote to IOCL vide its letter 19.10.2021, that it was informed by\nPNGRB that GIS based Geographical Area Maps were not available since\nthe tender calling for such maps was cancelled; this statement was false as\nPNGRB, vide its response dated 23.09.2021, had in fact stated that the GIS\nmap, indicating the respective GA area and boundaries, had already been\nprovided; the said tender was floated for the 11th CGD Bidding Round; and\nthe whole attempt seemed to be that the Appellant was trying to show that,\naccording to PNGRB, the district map was also the GA map which was\npatently wrong.\n\n B. ANALYSIS:\n\n265. While it is true that the Board never informed either the Appellant or\nthe 2nd Respondent that the GAs were based on the district boundaries, the\ndocuments on record as well as the documents placed for our perusal by the\nBoard, as referred to hereinabove, do show that the Board intended to\ndetermine the GA boundaries on the basis of the boundaries of the\nrespective districts. In any event, the understanding of the Appellant, even\nif it be erroneous (which we are satisfied it is not), would not amount to\nmisrepresentation of relevant facts.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 181 of 184\n\n 4. DOES THE SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT OF THE PNGRB\n REFLECT THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE\n RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WERE\n DEMARCATED ON THE BASIS OF DISTRICTS?\n\n A. SUBMISSION URGED ON BEHALF OF THE\n APPELLANT:\n\n266. Sri Paras Kuhad, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, would submit that in the tender issued by the PNGRB in March\n2021, for hiring an agency for supplying GIS based geographical area maps,\nit is admitted that Taluka/Tehsil/Mandal constitute Charge Areas of the GAs;\nin para 18.1(d), it is admitted that the population and household numbers of\nthe GAs are to be derived from the Census 2011 data, which shows GAs are\ncensus units; in para 18.1(k), the commonality of the GA boundary and\nadministrative boundary is conceded by the Board, by requiring the vendor\nto ensure that the GA boundary must coincide with the administrative\nboundaries within accuracy limit of 5 metres; in para 18.7, the Board has\nstipulated that, if the geo-referencing of the GA map and the GA boundary\nprojections are found not to be in line with the respective district boundaries,\nthen the GA map shall not be accepted; this constitutes a clear admission\nby the Board of the primacy of district boundary over the co-ordinates\nderived from geo-referencing; since this was an exercise for GAs which were\nalready authorised, including all 9th Round GA's, the understanding of the\nBoard as reflected in this tender constitutes an admission of how it\ndemarcated the GA at the relevant time; immediately after disputes arose\nbetween the parties, vide letter dated 23.09.2021 addressed to the\nAppellant, PNGRB stated that \"district boundaries within the GAs are\nconsidered to be as defined by the Survey of India/Office of the Registrar\nGeneral & Census Commissioner, India or respective local authority, such\nas district administration\"; there is a clear continuity in the exercise\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 182 of 184\n\n undertaken by the Board; the Board having decided to identify GAs on the\nbasis of Districts, made its determination for Kanchipuram District GA 9.61\nand Chennai and Tiruvallur Districts GA 9.62 in terms of districts, gave wide\npublicity to this district based determination for the 9th CGD Bidding Round\n(public notice dated 01.03.2018), asked the map vendor to prepare the maps\nof the districts, issued ACBD with all the data of the corresponding districts,\nevaluated reasonability of the bids with reference to the district data, and\nissued authorization stating that it is for the respective districts and the\nspecified total extent, corresponding to the area of the respective districts; it\nreaffirmed the determination based on district concept in the case of Megha\nEngineering [reply to Q. 2 at p. 102 of the judgment in Appeal No. 121 of\n2020] and in letter dated 23.09.2021 to AGP; and, in the 11th Round in 2021\nalso, admittedly, the district concept was followed, consistent with the\ndetermination made in 2016.\n\n B. ANALYSIS:\n\n267. What we are concerned in the present appeal is the 9th round of\nbidding, and we may not be justified in either referring to the earlier or\nsubsequent rounds of bidding or to the clarifications which the PNGRB may\nhave furnished with respect to other GAs. Reliance placed by the appellant,\non the judgment of this Tribunal in \nMegha Engineering and Infrastructures\nLimited Vs. Bhagyanagar Gas Limited & Ors. (Judgment\n in Appeal No.\n121 of 2020) is therefore misplaced.\n\n XXVI. CONCLUSION:\n\n268. In the light of the afore-said findings and conclusions, the impugned\norder passed by the Board in case No. Legal/11/2022 dated 22.12.2022\nmust be, and is accordingly, set aside. Consequently the complaint filed by\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 183 of 184\n\n the Appellant before the Board stands allowed to the extent indicated herein.\n\nWe hold that the subject 19 CNG stations are all located within the then\nKanchipuram district, and since the Kanchipuram district GA (GA 9.61) is co-\nterminus with the then Kanchipuram district, these 19 CNG stations must be\nheld to fall within the boundaries of Kanchipuram district GA, i.e. GA 9.61.\nThe 2nd Respondent shall forthwith cease and desist from laying, building or\noperating any of these 19 CNG stations.\n\n269. In so far as the Appellant's claim for damages of 3 crores for each of\nthe 19 CNG stations, aggregating to Rs.57 crores, is concerned, we are of\nthe view that this relief cannot be granted in the present Appeal, since the\nloss, if any, suffered by the Appellant, and the quantum of damages which\nthey may be entitled to as a result, must first be examined and determined\nby the PNGRB after giving both the parties a reasonable opportunity of being\nheard. We, therefore, grant the Appellant liberty to file a petition afresh\nbefore the PNGRB with respect to their claim for damages.\n\n270. The Appeal stands disposed of accordingly. Pending IAs, if any, shall\nalso stand disposed of.\n\n Pronounced in the open court on this the 15th day of May, 2024.\n\n (Dr. Ashutosh Karnatak) (Justice Ramesh Ranganathan)\n Technical Member Chairperson\n\nREPORTABLE / NON-REPORTABLE\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJudgment in Appeal No. 25 of 2023 Page 184 of 184",
