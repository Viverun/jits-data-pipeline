Singh,Adv.(for private respondent)\n------\nReportable Dated 18th June, 2013.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n2. This writ petition has been filed under\nArticle 226\nof\n\nConstitution of India praying that F.I.R. pertaining to Hathauri\n\nP.S. Case No. 27/2007, dated 2.7.2007 for the alleged offence\n\npunishable under\nSections 498-A\n,\n,\n,\nof the Indian\n\nPenal Code read with\nSections 3\nand\nof Dowry Prohibition Act,\n\nwhich is now pending in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Rosera in the district of Samastipur (Bihar) may be\n\nquashed.\n\n3. Office has raised objection with respect to territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court because of the reason that F.I.R. was\n\nlodged in territorial jurisdiction of State of Bihar i.e., within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of Patna High Court and criminal case in\n\npursuance of F.I.R. as P.S. Case No. 27/2007 is also pending in\n\nthe Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera in the\n\ndistrict of Samastipur (Bihar) falling within the territorial\n\njurisdiction of State of Bihar.\n4. Before proceeding to decide the issue of territorial\n\njurisdiction, it will be appropriate to give the background facts\n\nof the case leading to filing of this writ petition and reaching to\n\nDivision Bench of this Court.\n\n5. The petitioner no.1 and respondent no.3 are the husband\n\nand wife. Their marriage was solemnized on 29.06.2001 at\n\nvillage Arga, P.S. Biroul, District Darbhanga (Bihar). The said\n\nmarriage ultimately turned to be not a happy marriage and,\n\ntherefore, the petitioner no.1 filed a matrimonial suit no. 99 of\n\n2007 in the Court of Principal Judge, Family Court, Ranchi with\n\nthe allegation that after marriage the respondent-wife came\n\nwith the petitioner no.1 to his village at Samstipur and\n\nremained there for one week. A daughter was born in march,\n\n2002 out of the said matrimonial wedlock. The respondent was\n\nbrought to the petitioner's parents house at Ranchi in\n\nDecember, 2002 where she remained from 18.12.2002 to\n\n17.01.2003\n. Thereafter, allegation of misbehaviour and cruelty\n\nwere levelled against the respondent-wife with further\n\nallegation of her suffering from schizophrenia since before the\n\nmarriage. In the said divorce petition, the respondent-wife\n\nappeared and filed the written statement and ultimately, after\n\ntrial, the trial Court decreed the divorce suit on 14 th September,\n\n2009. The divorce decree was granted on the ground of cruelty\n\nand allegation of mental disorder was rejected by the trial\n\nCourt. The trial Court while granting the decree for divorce\n\nawarded the permanent alimony under Section 25 of Hindu\nMarriage Act, 1956\nof Rs. 3 lakhs to the respondent-wife. Being\n\naggrieved against the part of the decree i.e., grant of\n\npermanent alimony to the respondent of Rs. 3 lakhs in the\n\nimpugned judgment and decree, the petitioner no.1 preferred\n\nthe First Appeal No. 199 of 2009. The respondent-wife also\n\npreferred another First Appeal No. 183 of 2010 to challenge the\n\ndivorce decree. Both the appeals have already been admitted.\n\nWhen matter came up for consideration before this Court, this\n\nCourt directed the parties to appear before the Secretary,\n\nJharkhand State Legal Services Authority, Ranchi (JHALSA) and\n\nthe matter was taken up by the conciliator for consideration for\n\narriving at a settlement between the parties. Before the\n\nconciliator, both the parties appeared in person and submitted\n\nseparate written settlement applications on 16.07.2012 and the\n\nconciliator, JHALSA, Ranchi submitted the result of the\n\nconciliation between the petitioner no.1 and respondent-wife to\n\nthis Court in above First Appeal Nos. 199 of 2009 and 183 of\n\n2010 on 17.07.2012. It appears from the conciliator's report\n\nthat the matter has been settled between the parties and it was\n\nagreed by both the parties that petitioner no.1 will make\n\npayment of Rs. 5 lacs against permanent alimony to respondent-\n\nwife and the first installment of that amount, amounting to Rs.\n\none lac will be paid by the petitioner in the form of bank draft\n\non 20.07.2012 before this Court. It was also agreed that second\n\ninstallment of Rs. 4 lacs will be paid by the petitioner no.1 to\n\nrespondent-wife within two months or as the date, which may\nbe fixed by the High Court. It was further agreed by both the\n\nparties that they would file a joint compromise petition in the\n\ncriminal proceedings pending in the Court of Additional Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate, Rosera, Samstipur (Bihar). Both parties\n\nagreed that criminal case will be disposed of after the full and\n\nfinal payment of the agreed amount of Rs.5 lacs by the\n\npetitioner no.1 to respondent-wife. It was further agreed that\n\nany other cases, if any, between the parties, will also be\n\ndisposed of on the basis of compromise. This report came up for\n\nconsideration before this Court on 24th July, 2012 and on that\n\nday, learned counsel for the appellant-husband handed over a\n\ndemand draft of Rs. one lac to learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent-wife. So far as remaining amount of Rs.4 lacs is\n\nconcerned, for that purpose, two months time was granted to\n\nthe appellant-husband and, therefore, the matter was\n\nadjourned. The matter again came up before this Court on 08 th\n\nOctober, 2012 and on that day it was pointed out that criminal\n\ncase filed under Section 498- A read with\nSections 323\nand\n/\nI.P.C., which is pending in the State of Bihar, has not yet\n\nbeen withdrawn. Therefore, further time was granted to the\n\nrespondent-wife to withdraw the criminal case and it was\n\nordered that demand draft, which was ready with the\n\nrespondent, shall be kept by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant-husband for the purpose of safety of the interest of\n\nthe respondent. Then, on 27th November, 2012, further time\n\nwas granted so that the criminal case may be withdrawn by the\nrespondent-wife. On 5th February, 2013, it was informed by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties that though application has been\n\nsubmitted by the respondent-wife for withdrawal of the criminal\n\ncase before the concerned Court in the State of Bihar but no\n\norder has been passed by the trial Court.\n\n6. It appears that the trial Court did not pass any order\n\nbecause the trial Court has no jurisdiction to compound or\n\nquash the criminal proceedings as the offences are not\n\ncompoundable under Section 320 Cr. P.C. Finding this\n\nsituation, the petitioner-husband along with petitioner nos. 2 to\n\n4 has filed this criminal writ petition under\nArticle 226\nof\n\nConstitution of India for quashing of Hathauri P.S. Case No.\n\n27/2007, dated 2.7.2007 for the alleged offence punishable\n\nunder\nSections 498-A\n,\n,\n,\nof the Indian Penal Code\n\nread with\nSections 3\nand\nof Dowry Prohibition Act, which is\n\nnow pending in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Rosera in the district of Samastipur (Bihar).\n\nLearned Single Judge, in view of pendency of matrimonial case\n\ni.e., First Appeal Nos. 199 of 2009 and 183 of 2010, ordered for\n\nplacing this criminal writ petition before the Division Bench.\n\nHence, this criminal writ petition is before us.\n\n7. It also appears from the facts of the case that so far\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of the trial Court which passed the\n\ndivorce decree in matrimonial case no 99 of 2007 along with\n\nthe payment of permanent alimony has not been questioned by\n\nthe respondent-wife and the divorce decree was granted by the\ntrial Court in the State of Jharkhand. Undisputedly, F.I.R. was\n\nlodged in Hathauri police station in the State of Bihar and\n\nthereupon the criminal case has been registered as Hathauri\n\nP.S. Case no. 27/2007. The cause of action for filing the said\n\nF.I.R. and for the trial of the criminal case may have accrued in\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of said police station consequential to\n\nunder the territorial jurisdiction of the Court of Additional Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate, Rosera in the district of Samastipur (Bihar)\n\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of Patna High Court and\n\nquestion for consideration before us is that, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of this case, whether Jharkhand High Court has\n\njurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings pending in the\n\ncourt of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera, District\n\nSamastipur in the State of Bihar?\n\n8. According to learned counsel, Shri Sumeet Gadodia,\n\nappearing for the appellant-husband, this Court has jurisdiction\n\nto entertain the petition. Learned Counsel, Shri Sumeet\n\nGadodia, submitted that a bundle of facts constitutes cause of\n\naction which are necessarily to be placed before the Court for\n\nobtaining a relief by a party and events culminating into\n\nsettlement between the parties occurred in the State of\n\nJharkhand. Even if, assuming for the shake of argument, the\n\ntotal cause of action for the lodging of criminal case accrued in\n\nthe State of Bihar but so far as cause of action for quashing of\n\nF.I.R. and criminal proceeding certainly occurred only within\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of State of Jharkhand where the\nparties before divorce resided together and thereafter, the\n\ndivorce petition was filed by the petitioner no.1 within\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of State of Jharkhand which was duly\n\ndecreed by the trial Court in the State of Jharkhand and\n\nthereafter, the petitioner no.1 preferred the First Appeal before\n\nthis Court which has been admitted. In the First Appeal, this\n\nCourt referred the matter to the Secretary, JHALSA, Ranchi for\n\nexploring the possibility of settlement between the parties and\n\nthere both the parties agreed to settle the matter and they\n\narrived at a settlement within the territorial jurisdiction in the\n\nState of Jharkhand and particularly, in the city Ranchi itself.\n\nThis settlement was acted upon by both the parties within the\n\nState of Jharkhand which has duly been recorded by the Court\n\nin the First Appeal and petitioner no.1 handed over a draft of\n\nRs. one lac to the respondent-wife in the State of Jharkhand\n\nwhich has been encashed by the respondent-wife. The\n\nrespondent-wife willing to settle the matter and further acted\n\nupon on the settlement and submitted an application before the\n\nCourt of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera in the\n\ndistrict of Samastipur(Bihar) so as to take benefit of settlement\n\narrived at in Ranchi, State of Jharkhand. Because of the legal\n\nbar against the said Court i.e., Additional Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Rosera, the said Court was not in a position to\n\nquash F.I.R. or drop the criminal proceedings and, therefore,\n\nkept the application pending before the Court as it is, without\n\nany order. Therefore, cause of action for quashing of the\ncriminal proceeding accrued within the State of Jharkhand and\n\nparticularly, in the city of Ranchi itself.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner no.1 submitted that\n\nissue of cause of action with reference to\nArticle 226\nof\n\nConstitution of India as it was and after insertion of Clause (1-A)\n\nunder\nArticle 226\nand subsequently renumbered as\nArticle\n\n226(2)\nof Constitution of India has been considered by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Navinchandra N. Majithia Vrs.\n\nState of Maharashtra and others reported in (2000) 7\n\nSCC 640 . Hon'ble Supreme Court after considering various\n\njudgments in Navinchandra N. Majithia's case held, that it is\n\nwell settled that \"cause of action\" means that bundle of facts\n\nwhich the petitioner must prove, if traversed to entitle him to a\n\njudgment in his favour. Therefore, the writ petitioner will have\n\nto prove the settlement between the parties for getting the\n\nrelief for quashing of criminal proceedings and those events\n\noccurred only in the territorial jurisdiction of this High Court.\n\nEven in the case of Navinchandra N. Majithia (Supra) also, it\n\nhas been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that F.I.R. was\n\nregistered in a particular State is not the sole criterion to\n\ndecide that no cause of action has arisen even partly within the\n\nterritorial limits of jurisdiction of another State. Nor can it be\n\nsaid that any person can create a fake cause of action or even\n\nconcoct one by simply jutting in to the territorial limits of\n\nanother State or by making a sojourn or even a permanent\n\nresidence therein. The place of residence of the person moving\na High Court is not the criterion to determine the contours of\n\nthe cause of action in that particular writ petition. So, the cause\n\nof action is required to be found out from the bundle of facts\n\nand from the bundle of facts, it is essentially required to be\n\nproved for getting relief.\n\n10. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nin the most recent judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\ndelivered in the case of Jitendra Raghuvanshi and others\n\nvrs. Babita Raghuvanshi and another reported in (2013) 4\n\nSCC 58, Hon'ble Supreme Court in matrimonial disputes held,\n\nthat it is the duty of the Courts to encourage genuine\n\nsettlements of matrimonial disputes, particularly, when the\n\nsame are on considerable increase. Hon'ble Supreme Court also\n\nheld that for the purpose of securing ends of justice, Section\n\n320 of Cr. P.C. would not be a bar to the exercise of power of\n\nquashing of FIR,, complaint or the subsequent criminal\n\nproceedings.\n\n11.\nArticle 226 (2)\nof Constitution of India provides that even\n\nauthority situated outside the territorial jurisdiction of High\n\ncourt but cause of action or part of the cause of action accrued\n\nwithin jurisdiction of High Court, then such High Court can\n\nexercise jurisdiction over the authority situated outside the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of that Court or any other State. In the\n\ncase of B.S. Joshi and others Vrs. State of Haryana and\n\nanother reported in (2003) 4 SCC 675 Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt held, that the High Court can exercise its inherent power\nand quash the criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint in\n\nappropriate cases in order to meet the ends of justice and and\n\nSection 320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers of\n\nthe High Court under Section 482 of the Code.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the respondent-wife supported the\n\ncontentions of the learned counsel for the partitioner and\n\nsubmitted that dispute has been settled between the parties and\n\nthat too long back on 16.7.2012 and both the parties submitted\n\nwritten application before conciliator, JHALSA, Ranchi for\n\nsettling the matter and they have agreed to the terms and\n\nconditions recorded by the conciliator in its minutes/report,\n\ndated 17.07.2012. The respondent-wife already received the\n\npayment of Rs. one lac and because of pendency of criminal\n\ncase, she is not getting the rest permanent alimony of Rs.4 lacs\n\neven when the payment is ready with the learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner no.1 for payment to the respondent-wife.\n\n13. We have considered the submission of learned counsel for\n\nthe parties and perused the facts of those considered judgments\n\nrelied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner.\nArticle 226(2)\n\nof Constitution of India is as under:\n\n\"226.(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to\n\nissue directions, orders or writs to any\n\nGovernment, authority or person may also be\n\nexercised by any High Court exercising\n\njurisdiction in relation to the territories\n\nwithin which the cause of action, wholly or in\n\npart, arises for the exercise of such power,\nnotwithstanding that the seat of such Government\n\nor authority or the residence of such person is\n\nnot within those territories.\"\n\n14.\nArticle 226\nhas been considered by Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Navinchandra N. Majithia (supra) as it\n\nwas before insertion of Clause (2) of\nArticle 226\nof Constitution\n\nof India and after insertion of Clause (2) under\nArticle 226.\nIt\n\nappears from the said judgment that because of judgment of\n\nConstitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nElection Commission Vrs. Saka Venkata Subba Rao\n\nreported in AIR 1953 SC 210, it became necessary to bring\n\n15th amendment to the Constitution by which Clause (1-A) was\n\nadded to\nArticle 226\nof Constitution of India and that Clause\n\nsubsequently numbered as sub-clause (2) of Constitution of\n\nIndia by its 42nd amendment.\nHon'ble Supreme Court held, that\n\nobject of inserting Clause 2 in\nArticle 226\nwas to supersede the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nElection\n\nCommission V. Saka Venkata Subba Rao\nreported in AIR\n\n1953 SC 210 .\nIn Navinchandra N. Majithia's case Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held, that in view of Clause (2) of\nArticle 226\n,\n\nthe power conferred on the High Courts in relation to the\n\nterritories within which \"the cause of action, wholly or in part,\n\narises\" and it is no matter that the seat of the authority\n\nconcerned is outside the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of\n\nthat High Court. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the\namendment is, thus, aimed at widening the width of the area\n\nfor reaching the writs issued by different High Courts.\n\n15. The cause of action is a bundle of facts which the\n\npetitioner must prove, if traversed to entitle him to a judgment\n\nin his favour is a well settled law. At this juncture, it will\n\nappropriate to mention here that in a case where relief is\n\nsought against any Government or authority or any party, of\n\nwhich seat is not within the territory of High Court or the\n\nperson is not residing within the territory of the High Court,\n\nthen in that situation, if cause of action wholly or in part,\n\naccrued in jurisdiction of High Court, the said High Court may\n\nexercise its jurisdiction irrespective of fact that seat of such\n\nGovernment or authority or the residence of such person is not\n\nwithin the territory of High Court. This is very wide conferment\n\nof jurisdiction to recognize the Court's jurisdiction in whose\n\njurisdiction case of action or part of cause of action accrued\n\nirrespective of place of residence. Therefore, if any person is\n\nseeking remedy against any Government or authority having its\n\nseat outside the territorial jurisdiction of High Court but cause\n\nof action arose in the city over which High Court has\n\njurisdiction then in that situation, the writ can be maintained in\n\nthe High Court where the seat of such Government or authority\n\nis not there. Meaning thereby, the stay and residence of\n\nrespondent is not relevant for the purpose of finding out the\n\njurisdiction of the High Court under\nArticle 226 (2)\nof\nConstitution of India but High Court's jurisdiction is by virtue of\n\naccrual of cause of action, wholly or in part.\n\n16. In this case, the petitioner is seeking relief, in fact, not\n\nagainst the police station or the Court situated within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of State of Bihar though in a writ\n\njurisdiction, the criminal proceeding is sought to be quashed\n\nwhich has been initiated in the said police station and pending\n\nin the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera in\n\nthe district of Samastipur(Bihar) within jurisdiction of State of\n\nBihar and if the proceedings will be quashed, that will be the\n\nproceedings initiated by respondent-wife who is only concerned\n\nperson and can be aggrieved against that quashing. In the\n\npresent case, the cause of action is the bundle of facts and\n\nwhich are between the two parties and not the fact relating or\n\nconcerning to the police station or the Court. Therefore, the\n\npetitioner in this case is seeking to establish that there is a\n\ncompromise between the parties in a matrimonial dispute and\n\nbecause of that compromise, the criminal case filed by the\n\nrespondent be quashed. The respondent-wife is not only not\n\nchallenging the jurisdiction of this Court but she had taken part\n\nin the conciliation proceeding within the territorial jurisdiction\n\nof this Court, and in fact beneficiary if criminal proceeding\n\nwhich she initiated and she cannot withdraw is quashed. Then\n\nin that situation, facts leading to and fact of compromise\n\nbetween the parties took place only in the Jharkhand State and\n\nhave constituted cause of action for quashing the criminal\nproceedings. If we take a strict technical view, for quashing of\n\ncriminal case, no event or fact leading to compromise occurred\n\nin the State of Bihar or within the territory where the criminal\n\ncase is pending, then in that situation,\nArticle 226 (2)\nof\n\nConstitution of India empowers this Court to pass appropriate\n\norder which may have its effect in the territory of State of Bihar\n\nas the Court in question is situated in the State of Bihar. In the\n\ncase of B.S. Joshi and others (Supra) in para-14, it has been\n\nspecifically held by Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is as under :\n\n\"14. There is no doubt that the\n\nobject of introducing Chapter XX-A\n\ncontaining Section 498-A in the\nIndian\n\nPenal Code\nwas to prevent torture to a\n\nwoman by her husband or by relatives\n\nof her husband. Section 498-A was\n\nadded with a view to punishing a\n\nhusband and his relatives who harass\n\nor torture the wife to coerce her or\n\nher relatives to satisfy unlawful\n\ndemands of dowry. The hypertechnical\n\nview would be counterproductive and\n\nwould act against interests of women\n\nand against the object for which this\n\nprovision was added. There is every\n\nlikelihood that non-exercise of\n\ninherent power to quash the\nproceedings to meet the ends of\n\njustice would prevent women from\n\nsettling earlier. That is not the\n\nobject of Chapter XX-A of the\nIndian\n\nPenal Code\n.\"\n\n17. In view of Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is clear\n\nthat no hypertechnical view can be entertained which would be\n\ncounterproductive and would act against interests of women\n\nand against the object for which provision of Section 498- A has\n\nbeen added in\nIndian Penal Code\n. Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe recent judgment of Jitendra Raghuvanshi and others\n\n(Supra) has considered the earlier several judgment and in\n\npara- 15 and 16 held as under:\n\n15. In our view, it is the duty of the\ncourts to encourage genuine settlements\nof matrimonial disputes, particularly,\nwhen the same are on considerable\nincrease. Even if the offences are non-\n\ncompoundable, if they relate to\nmatrimonial disputes and the Court is\nsatisfied that the parties have settled\nthe same amicably and without any\npressure, we hold that for the purpose of\nsecuring ends of justice, Section 320 of\nthe Code would not be a bar to the\nexercise of power of quashing of FIR,\ncomplaint or the subsequent criminal\nproceedings.\n\n16. There has been an outburst of\nmatrimonial disputes in recent times. The\ninstitution of marriage occupies an\nimportant place and it has an important\nrole to play in the society. Therefore,\nevery effort should be made in the\ninterest of the individuals in order to\nenable them to settle down in life and\nlive peacefully. If the parties ponder\nover their defaults and terminate their\ndisputes amicably by mutual agreement\ninstead of fighting it out in a court of\nlaw, in order to do complete justice in\nthe matrimonial matters, the courts\nshould be less hesitant in exercising\ntheir extraordinary jurisdiction. It is\ntrite to state that the power under\nSection 482 should be exercised sparingly\nand with circumspection only when the\nCourt is convinced, on the basis of\nmaterial on record, that allowing the\nproceedings to continue would be an abuse\nof process of court or that the ends of\njustice require that the proceedings\nought to be quashed. We also make it\nclear that exercise of such power would\ndepend upon the facts and circumstances\nof each case and it has to be exercised\nin appropriate cases in order to do real\nand substantial justice for the\nadministration of which alone the courts\nexist. It is the duty of the courts to\nencourage genuine settlements of\nmatrimonial disputes and Section 482 of\nthe Code enables the High Court and\n\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution enables\nthis Court to pass such orders.\n18. In view of para-16 of judgment of the case of Jitendra\n\nRaguuvanshi and others(Supra) the courts duty while\n\nexercising jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nin the matter of\n\nquashing of criminal case is that before passing such order the\n\nCourt should satisfy itself fully from entire facts and\n\ncircumstances and materials on record that allowing the\n\nproceeding to continue would be an abuse of process of Court\n\nor that the end of justice require that the proceedings ought to\n\nbe quashed.\n\n19. Therefore, in view of the above discussions, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that in this case, cause of action for\n\nquashing of criminal proceedings arose in the State of\n\nJharkhand giving rise to cause of action for filing the petition\n\nunder\nArticle 226\nto the petitioner and the said quashing is in\n\nthe interest of both the parties and would definite it is in the\n\ninterest of justice that the dispute including the quashing of\n\ncriminal case will entitle respondent-wife and the petitioner to\n\ntake the benefit of settlement including by getting alimony as\n\nagreed by the parties.\n\n20. At this juncture, we may further mention here that the\n\nparties settled the dispute on 16.7.2012 and the settlement was\n\nacted upon and the respondent-wife took the benefit of the\n\nsettlement by receiving Rs. one lac against the permanent\n\nalimony dues. Then, the respondent-wife moved an application\n\nbefore the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera\n\nin the district of Samastipur(Bihar) on 27.11.2012. Today also,\nthe respondent-wife is willing to settle the matter totally and,\n\ntherefore, this Court is satisfied that it is bonafide settlement\n\nbetween the parties and sufficient time was available to the\n\nrespondent-wife to change her mind, if there was no willingness\n\nto settle the matter. Therefore, in that situation, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that the proceedings initiated after lodging\n\nof F.I.R. pertaining to Hathauri P.S. Case No. 27/2007, dated\n\n2.7.2007 for the alleged offence punishable under\nSections\n\n498-A\n,\n,\n,\nof the Indian Penal Code read with\nSections\nand\nof Dowry Prohibition Act, which is now pending in the\n\nCourt of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rosera in the\n\ndistrict of Samastipur (Bihar) is liable to be quashed. Hence,\n\nthis writ petition is allowed overruling the objection of\n\nterritorial jurisdiction and the proceedings initiated after\n\nlodging of F.I.R. pertaining to Hathauri P.S. Case No. 27/2007,\n\ndated 2.7.2007 for the alleged offence punishable under\n\nSections 498-A\n,\n,\n,\nof the Indian Penal Code read with\n\nSections 3\nand\nof Dowry Prohibition Act stands quashed.\n\n21. A copy of this order shall be submitted by both the parties\n\nseparately to the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nRosera in the district of Samastipur (Bihar) so that\n\nconsequential order may be passed in that proceedings.\n\n(Prakash Tatia,C.J.)\n\n(Jaya Roy, J.)\n\nSudhir",
