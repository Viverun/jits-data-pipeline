And Others on 26 March, 2015\n\nAuthor:\nTarlok Singh Chauhan\n\nBench:\nTarlok Singh Chauhan\n\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA\n\nCWP No. 4451 of 2013\n\n.\n\nDate of decision: 26.3.2015\n\nDharam Pal Singh ...Petitioner.\n\nVersus\nState of H.P. and others ..Respondents.\n\nCoram\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan, Judge.\n\nWhether approved for reporting ?1 No\n\nFor the Petitioner : Mr. B.

That the writ of mandamus be issued directing the respondents to\nallow the petitioner to work in the college as Lecturer (Computer\nScience) till regular appointments are made.\"\n\n2. The petitioner having obtained a degree in Master of\n\nComputers Application in first division came to be appointed as Lecturer\n\nin the respondent No.3-College (on period basis). This appointment was\n\npursuant to an advertisement issued in this regard in the local daily and it\n\nwas only after undergoing a selection process by appearing before a duly\nWhether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the Judgment ? Yes\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nconstituted Committee that the petitioner came to be appointed. The\n\npetitioner continued to work for two years but thereafter the respondent\n\n.\n\nNo.3 again advertised the same post on similar conditions i.e. period\n\nbasis to which the petitioner has taken exception and approached this\n\nCourt contending that the action of the respondents amounts to replacing\n\na contractual employee by another set of contract appointee.\n\n3. The respondents have filed the reply and have stated that\n\nthe petitioner was initially engaged on 4.7.2011 to teach the B.C.A.\n\ncourses purely on temporary basis for the academic session 2011-2012\n\nand he worked as such till 24.4.2012. The petitioner was again engaged\n\non 21.6.2012 on the same terms and conditions for the academic session\n\n2012-2013 and worked as such upto 4.4.2013. It is then alleged that in\n\nthe terms and conditions of appointment of the petitioner, it has been\n\nspecifically stated that he is not entitled to claim any financial or service\n\nbenefit and therefore, the petitioner cannot be permitted to continue\n\nteaching especially when the academic session for which he had been\n\nengaged has already ended.\n\n4. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also\n\ngone through the records of the case carefully.\n\n5. The short question which arises for consideration is as to\n\nwhether the respondents can be permitted to replace the petitioner by\n\nanother contract appointee especially when the petitioner is duly qualified\n\nand has been engaged after due selection and his integrity as well as\n\nwork and conduct has been duly certified time and again. It is true that\n\nthe petitioner may not have a right to be appointed as a permanent\n\nemployee at this stage, but this Court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nhe has been working on contract basis for more than two years to the\n\nsatisfaction of the respondents' authorities.\n\n.\n\n6. Dispensing of services of the petitioner after the completion\n\nof his contract period is nothing short of termination. The services of the\n\npetitioner are sought to be replaced by another contract employee which\n\nas held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nState of Haryana and others\n\nvs. Piara Singh and others\n(1992) 4 SCC 118, is not permissible in law.\n\nreads thus:\n\nr to\nIt is apt to reproduce the paragraphs 45, 46 and 47 of the report which\n\n\"45. The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through the\nprescribed agency but exigencies of administration may sometimes call\nfor an adhoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a situation,\n\neffort should always be to replace such an adhoc/temporary employee\nby a regularly selected employee as early as possible. Such a\ntemporary employee may also compete along with others for such\n\nregular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good, but if\nhe does not, he must give way to the regularly selected candidate. The\n\nappointment of the regularly selected candidate cannot be withheld or\nkept in abeyance for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary employee.\n\n46. Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be replaced\nby another adhoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced only by\na regularly selected employee. This is necessary to avoid arbitrary\naction on the part of the appointing authority.\n\n47. Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is\nnecessitated on account of the exigencies of administration, he should\nordinarily be drawn from the employment exchange unless it cannot\nbrook delay in which case the pressing cause must be stated on the file.\nIf no candidate is available or is not sponsored by the employment\nexchange, some appropriate method consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticle 16\nshould be followed. In other words, there must be a notice\npublished in the appropriate manner calling for applications and all\nthose who apply in response thereto should be considered fairly.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\n7. Indisputably, the respondent No.3 is a Government College\n\nand, therefore, cannot be permitted to not only indulge in unfair practice\n\n.\n\nbut it also cannot be permitted to take advantage of its sheer strength of\n\nbargaining power. The Division Bench of this Court in LPA No. 132 of\n\n2014 in\nDr. Lok Pal vs. State of H.P. and others\n, (of which I was one of\n\nthe member), was seized of the matter where though the appellant\n\ntherein had been appointed on a consolidated salary of ` 43,000/- per\n\nthis Court held as under:\n\nr to\nmonth in terms of the advertisement but was actually paid ` 21,000/- and\n\n\"7.This case reflects a sorry state of affairs where the\n\nrespondents on the sheer strength of its bargaining power\nhave taken advantage of their position and imposed wholly\nun-equitable and unreasonable condition of employment on\n\ntheir prospective employees, who did not have any other\nchoice but to accept the employment on the terms and\n\nconditions offered by the respondents. This action of the\nrespondents is violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\nHere it is apt to reproduce relevant observations of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the celebrated decision of\nCentral\n\nInland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. Brojo Nath\nGanguly and another\n, (1986) 3 SCC 156, which reads as\nunder:-\n\n\"88. As seen above, apart from judicial decisions, the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom have statutorily\nrecognized, at least in certain areas of the law of contracts,\nthat there can be unreasonableness (or lack of fairness, if\none prefers that phrase) in a contract or a clause in a\ncontract where there is inequality of bargaining power\nbetween the parties although arising out of circumstances\nnot within their control or as a result of situations not of\ntheir creation. Other legal systems also permit judicial\nreview of a contractual transaction entered into in similar\ncircumstances. For example, section 138(2) of the German\nCivil Code provides that a transaction is void \"when a\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nperson\" exploits \"the distressed situation, inexperience,\nlack of judgmental ability, or grave weakness of will of\nanother to obtain the grant or promise of pecuniary\n\n.\n\nadvantages........which are obviously disproportionate to the\n\nperformance given in return.\" The position according to the\nFrench law is very much the same.\n\n89. Should then our courts not advance with the times?\nShould they still continue to cling to outmoded concepts\nand outworn ideologies? Should we not adjust our thinking\ncaps to match the fashion of the day? Should all\n\njurisprudential development pass us by, leaving us\nfloundering in the sloughs of nineteenth-century theories?\nShould the strong be permitted to push the weak to the\n\nwall? Should they be allowed to ride roughshod over the\n\nweak? Should the courts sit back and watch supinely while\nthe strong trample under-foot the rights of the weak? We\nhave a Constitution for our country. Our judges are bound\nby their oath to \"uphold the Constitution and the laws\". The\n\nConstitution was enacted to secure to all the citizens of this\ncountry social and economic justice.\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution guarantees to all persons equality before the\nlaw and the equal protection of the laws. The principle\n\ndeducible from the above discussions on this part of the\ncase is in consonance with right and reason, intended to\nsecure social and economic justice and conforms to the\n\nmandate of the great equality clause in\nArt. 14.\nThis\nprinciple is that, the courts will not enforce and will, when\ncalled upon to do so, strike down an unfair and\nunreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreasonable\nclause in a contract, entered into between parties who are\nnot equal in bargaining power. It is difficult to give an\nexhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No court can\nvisualize the different situations which can arise in the\naffairs of men. One can only attempt to give some\nillustrations. For instance, the above principle will apply\nwhere the inequality of bargaining power is the result of the\ngreat disparity in the economic strength of the contracting\nparties. It will apply where the inequality is the result of\ncircumstances, whether of the creation of the parties or not.\nIt will apply to situations in which the weaker party is in a\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nposition in which he can obtain goods or services or means\nof livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger\nparty or go without them. It will also apply where a man has\n\n.\n\nno choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his\n\nassent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a\nprescribed or standard form or to accept a set of rules as\npart of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and\n\nunconscionable a clause in that contract or form or rules\nmay be. This principle, however, will not apply where the\nbargaining power of the contracting parties is equal or\n\nalmost equal. This principle may not apply where both\nparties are businessmen and the contract is a commercial\ntransaction. In today's complex world of giant corporations\nwith their vast infra-structural organizations and with the\n\nState through its instrumentalities and agencies entering\n\ninto almost every branch of industry and commerce, there\ncan be myriad situations which result in unfair and\nunreasonable bargains between parties possessing wholly\n\ndisproportionate and unequal bargaining power. These\ncases can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The\ncourt must judge each case on its, own facts and\n\ncircumstances.\"\n\nIn terms of the aforesaid exposition of law, it is clear that this\nCourt has the jurisdiction and power to strike or set aside the\n\nunfavourable term of contract of employment which purports\nto give effect to unreasonable bargain violating\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution.\n\n8. The undertaking obtained from the appellant is so unfair\nand unreasonable that it shocks the conscious of this Court.\nIt reflects the inequality of the bargaining power between the\nappellant and the respondents which emanates from the\ngreat disparity in the economic strength between the job\nseeker and job giver.\n\n9.The appellant was compelled by circumstances to accept\nthe offer made by the respondents, but then the mere\nacceptance of this offer would not give it a stamp of approval\nregarding its validity. It is an age old maxim that \"necessity\nknows no law\" and a person sometimes may have to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nsuccumb to pressure of the other party to bargain who is in\nstronger position. Although, it may not be strictly in place,\nbut the Court cannot shut its eyes to this ground reality.\n\n.\n\n10. At this stage, it shall be apt to quote the following\n\nobservations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nChairman and\nMD NTPC Ltd. Vs. Rashmi Construction Builders and\n\nContractors\n(2004) 2 SCC 663:-\n\n\"28. Further, necessitas non habet legem is an age-old\nmaxim which means necessity knows no law. A person may\nsometimes have to succumb to the pressure of the other\n\nparty to the bargain who is in a stronger position.\"\n\n11.Notably the respondents herein are none other than the\n\nfunctionaries of the State who are expected to function like a\n\nmodel employer. A model employer is under an obligation to\nconduct itself with high probity and expected candour and\nthe employer, who is duty bound to act as a model employer\n\nhas social obligation to treat an employee in an appropriate\nmanner so that an employee is not condemned to feel totally\nsubservient to the situation. A model employer should not\n\nexploit its employees and take advantage of their\n\nhelplessness and misery. The conduct of the respondents\nfalls short of expectation of a model employer.\n\n12. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its decision in\nBhupendra\nNath Hazarika and another Vs. State of Assam and others\n,\n(2013) 2 SCC 516 has succinctly explained this position in\nthe following terms:-\n\n\"61. Before parting with the case, we are compelled to\nreiterate the oft stated principle that the State is a model\nemployer and it is required to act fairly giving due regard\nand respect to the rules framed by it. But in the present\ncase, the State has atrophied the rules. Hence, the need for\nhammering the concept.\n\n62. Almost a quarter century back, this Court in\nBalram\nGupta V. Union of India\n1987 Supp SCC 228 had observed\nthus: (SCC p. 236, para 13)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\n\"13.... As a model employer the Government must\nconduct itself with high probity and candour with its\nemployees.\"\n\n.\n\nIn\nState of Haryana V. Piara Singh\n(1992) 4 SCC 118 the\nCourt had clearly stated: (SCC p. 134, para 21).\n\n\"21....The main concern of the court in such matters\n\nis to ensure the rule of law and to see that the\nExecutive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\nemployees consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\"\n\n63.\n\nIn\nState of Karnataka V. Umadevi\n(3) (2006) 4 SCC 1\n(SCC P. 18, para 6) the Constitution Bench, while discussing\n\nthe role of State in recruitment procedure, stated that if\n\nrules have been made under Article 3089 of the\nConstitution, then the Government can make appointments\nonly in accordance with the rules, for the State is meant to\nbe a model employer.\n\n64.\nIn\nMehar Chand Polytechnic V. Anu Lamba\n(2006) 7\nSCC 161 (SCC p. 166, para 16) the Court observed that\npublic employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged\n\nunder\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India and that the\n\nrecruitment rules are framed with a view to give equal\nopportunity to al the citizens of India entitled for being\nconsidered for recruitment in the vacant posts.\n\n65. We have stated the role of the State as a model employer\nwith the fond hope that in future a deliberate disregard is\nnot taken recourse to and deviancy of such magnitude is\nnot adopted to frustrate the claims of the employees. It\nshould always be borne in mind that legitimate aspirations\nof the employees are not guillotined and a situation is not\ncreated where hopes end in despair. Hope for everyone is\ngloriously precious and a model employer should not\nconvert it to be deceitful and treacherous by playing a game\nof chess with their seniority. A sense of calm sensibility\nand concerned sincerity should be reflected in every step.\nAn atmosphere of trust has to prevail and when the\nemployees are absolutely sure that their trust shall not be\nbetrayed and they shall be treated with dignified fairness\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP\nthen only the concept of good governance can be\nconcretised. We say no more.\"\n\n.\n\nThe position in this case is no different from that of\nDr. Lok Pal\n's case\n\n(supra).\n\n8. The Central Government, State Governments and likewise\n\nall Public Sector undertakings are expected to function like model\n\nemployers. A model employer is under an obligation to conduct itself with\n\nhigh probity and expected candour. An employer who is duty bound to\n\nact as a model employer has social obligation to treat an employee in an\n\nappropriate manner so that an employee is not condemned to feel totally\n\nsubservient to the situation. A model employer should not exploit the\n\nemployees and take advantage of their helplessness and misery.\n\n9. Ex-consequenti the present petition is allowed and the\n\nadvertisement dated 5.6.2013 (Annexure P-4) issued by the respondent\n\nNo.3 is quashed and set-aside and the respondents are directed to allow\n\nthe petitioner to work in the College as Lecturer (Computer Science) till\n\nregular appointments are made or till such time that the petitioner himself\n\ndoes not incur any disqualification from holding the post.\n\nAccordingly, the present petition stands disposed of in the\n\naforesaid terms, so also the pending application(s), if any. The parties are\n\nleft to bear their own costs.\n\nMarch 26, 2015 ( Tarlok Singh Chauhan),\n(GR) Judge\n\n::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:53:33 :::HCHP",
