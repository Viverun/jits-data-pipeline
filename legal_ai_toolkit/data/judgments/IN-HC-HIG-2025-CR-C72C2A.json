The present application filed under Section 483 of the Bharatiya\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 20231 (formerly\nSection 439\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 19732) seeks regular bail in the proceedings arising\nfrom FIR No. 750/2023 registered under\nSections 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nof the\nIndian Penal Code, 18603 at P.S. Krishna Nagar, District Shahdara, Delhi.\nFactual Background\n\n2. Briefly stated, the case of the Prosecution is as follows:\n\"BNSS\"\n\"\nCr.P.C\n.\"\n\"\nIPC\n\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 1 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\n2.1 On 29th November 2023, an intimation was received at P.S. Krishna\nNagar from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital,4 Delhi, reporting that Smt.\nGurpreet Kaur, wife of Shri Karanjeet Singh, aged 24 years, had been\nbrought to the hospital by her husband (the Applicant) following an incident\nof alleged hanging that occurred at House No. 17/12, 2nd Floor, Krishna\nNagar, Delhi. The attending medical officer at GTB Hospital declared her\n\"brought dead\" as per MLC No. 462/11/23. The said DD Entry was\nassigned to SI Naresh Kumar for necessary action.\n\n2.2 SI Naresh Kumar, accompanied by HC Sunil and the Applicant,\nreached the location where the incident occurred. Smt. Prableen Kaur,\n(sister-in law of the Applicant) was also present. The Crime team inspected\nthe scene of crime and took photographs. Broken bathroom tiles were\nseized.\n\n2.3 Co-accused Prableen Kaur, produced a multicoloured chunni, stating\nit had been used by the deceased to hang herself from a ceiling fan in the\nbathroom. She disclosed that she broken open the bathroom door; untied the\nchunni from around the neck of the deceased and ceiling fan; and placed it\ninside a cupboard in the room. The chunni was seized by SI Naresh Kumar.\n2.4 Since the death of the deceased had occurred within 7 years of\nmarriage, in compliance with\nSection 176\nCr.P.C., an intimation was sent to\nthe SDM, Vivek Vihar to hold inquest. Statements of the parents of the\ndeceased were recorded by the Executive Magistrate. They alleged that the\ndeceased had married the Applicant on 12th December, 2022, and had since\nbeen subjected to physical and mental abuse by the Applicant and his\nfamily. Specific allegations included dowry demands, including a car, and\nclaims that the marriage had not been consummated. The deceased was\n\"GTB Hospital\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 2 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nallegedly made to live in a bedroom without a door. An illicit relationship\nwas also alleged between the Applicant and co-accused Prableen Kaur.\n2.5 The impugned FIR was lodged pursuant to these allegations. The\nApplicant was arrested on 1st December 2023, along with co-accused\nPrabhjeet Singh (brother-in-law of the deceased) and Jitender Singh (father-\nin-law of the deceased). Co-accused Prableen Kaur was arrested on 2nd\nDecember 2023.\n\n2.6 A post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted on 30th\nNovember, 2023. The autopsy surgeon opined, \"the cause of death is\nasphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging and viscera of disease has been\npreserved for investigation\". Viscera was preserved and sent to CFSL\nHyderabad for chemical examination, which later reported no detection of\ncommon poisons, pesticides, alkaloids, or drugs.\n2.7 The mobile phones of the Applicant and co-accused Prableen Kaur\nwere seized. The WhatsApp chats revealed that the Applicant used abusive\nand vulgar language regarding the deceased in his conversations with co-\naccused Prableen Kaur. Both the phones were submitted to FSL, Rohini,\nDelhi, for the retrieval of deleted data, the results of which are awaited.\n2.8 The chargesheet was filed on 24th February, 2024 before the Trial\nCourt, and charges were framed against the Applicant and Prableen Kaur\nunder\nSections 498A\n/\n304-B\n/\nIPC, and alternatively\nSections 306\n/\nIPC.\nApplicant's Case\n\n3. The Counsel for the Applicant seeks grant of bail on the following\ngrounds:\n\n3.1 The Applicant is innocent, and has been falsely implicated at the\nbehest of the mother of the deceased with ulterior motives.\n3.2 The investigation is complete, chargesheet has been filed, and charges\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 3 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nhave been framed. The Applicant has already undergone over a year of\nincarceration as an undertrial, and the trial is likely to take considerable\ntime. Continued detention at this stage infringes the Applicant's right to a\nspeedy trial under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India.\n3.3 The charges framed against the Applicant are identical to those faced\nby co-accused Prabhleen Kaur, who was granted bail in December 2023.\nBail is thus sought on the principle of parity.\n\n3.4 The Applicant requires surgical intervention, which can only be\nadministered at a medical facility outside jail. Prior to his arrest, the\nApplicant had been suffering from kidney stones, causing abdominal pain.\nAn Ultrasound of the abdomen conducted on 16 th August 2023 revealed the\npresence of a 4 mm concretion in his right kidney, accompanied by left-\nsided hydroureteronephrosis with a dilated upper ureter. His condition has\nsince deteriorated, with the stone enlarging to 17 mm.\n3.5 The post-mortem report does not mention any anti-mortem injuries.\n3.6 Neither the Applicant, nor his parents or any of his relatives ever\nmade any demand for dowry, either before or during marriage. In such\ncircumstances, it is wholly unreasonable to presume that any such demand\nwould have arisen subsequently, particularly after the parties had spent a\nsubstantial period together post-marriage. Significantly, no complaint was\never lodged by the deceased, her parents, or any other family member\nagainst the Applicant or his relatives regarding any dowry demand during\nher lifetime. The allegations in the FIR have been made only after the death\nof the deceased, seemingly under external influence, with ulterior motives.\n3.7 Pertinently, during the hearing of the bail application of co-accused\nPrableen Kaur before the ASJ, the deceased's mother categorically admitted\nthat no dowry was given at the time of marriage. The said fact was duly\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 4 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nrecorded in the order dated 22nd December 2023, wherein it was observed:\n\n\"On being enquired by the Court, the mother of the deceased/ complainant\nstated that during the marriage no dowry was given.\"\n\n3.8 The Applicant was not present at the scene of the incident when the\ndeceased committed suicide. He was at work and called the deceased around\nlunchtime. On learning of the incident, he rushed home, took her to the\nhospital, and informed her father. He remained fully cooperative.\n3.9 Statements of the deceased's parents under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. differ\nmaterially from their testimonies in court, which reflect an improved\nversion. The original statements lacked key allegations subsequently\nintroduced in the testimonies.\n\n3.10 The allegation of dowry demand is vague and unsubstantiated, and\nlacks any specific timeframe. Allegations of demand made \"subsequent to\nmarriage\" do not meet the legal threshold of \"soon before death\".\nRespondents' Case\n\n4. On the other hand, Mr. Amit Ahlawat, APP for the State, and Mr.\nAman Akhtar, Counsel for the Complainant, strongly oppose the request.\nMr. Ahlawat contends that the allegations levelled against the Applicant\ninvolve the serious offence of dowry death under\nSection 304B\nIPC, a\ncharge that carries a presumption of culpability against the husband and his\nrelatives where the death of a woman occurs within seven years of marriage\nunder suspicious circumstances. It is submitted that the material on record,\nincluding the testimonies of the deceased's parents, indicate that the\ndeceased was subjected to sustained harassment, both physical and\nemotional, by the Applicant and co-accused, Prableen Kaur. The nature of\nabuse was not limited to dowry demands, but extended to personal\nhumiliation and denial of marital rights, as alleged in the statements\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 5 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nrecorded before the Executive Magistrate and in Court. Further, Mr.\nAhlawat highlights the content of WhatsApp chats retrieved from the\nApplicant's mobile phone, which contains vulgar and derogatory remarks\nmade against the deceased. These communications lend prima facie support\nto the Prosecution's contention of persistent cruelty.\n\n5. Mr. Aman Akhtar, counsel for the Complainant, adds that the parents\nof the deceased have consistently reiterated the allegation of unlawful\ndemands made soon before the death of the deceased. He argues that the\nApplicant's conduct points not only to domestic cruelty, but also to a\npotential motive tied to his extra-marital involvement. He asserts that\ngranting bail at this stage would not only undermine the gravity of the\ncharge, but may also embolden the Applicant to influence or intimidate key\nProsecution witnesses. Both counsel stress that the seriousness of the\noffence, the nature of evidence available, and the possibility of interference\nwith the trial process strongly weigh against the grant of bail. They urge the\nCourt to consider the statutory presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872, which squarely applies in this case, and to deny\nthe Applicant the relief sought.\n\nAnalysis\n\n6. The Applicant has been charged under\nSections 498A\n/\n304-B\n/\nIPC,\nand alternatively under\nSections 306\n/\nIPC. The ingredients of the offence\nunder\nSection 304B\nIPC, as elucidated by the Supreme Court in\nRajinder\nSingh v. State of Punjab,5\nand consistently reaffirmed in a catena of\njudgments,6 are as follows:\n\n\"9. The ingredients of the offence under\nSection 304-B\nIPC have been\nstated and restated in many judgments. There are four such ingredients\n(2015) 6 SCC 477.\nChabi Karmakar v. State of W.B.\n, (2025) 1 SCC 398.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 6 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nand they are said to be:\n\n(a) death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily\ninjury or her death must have occurred otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances;\n\n(b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage;\n\n(c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and\n\n(d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand\nfor dowry.\"\n\n7. These four conditions form the statutory foundation for invoking the\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, which shifts\nthe burden onto the accused to rebut the same. However, this presumption is\nnot absolute, and must be preceded by the establishment of foundational\nfacts as required under\nSection 304B\nIPC, including the specific allegation\nof dowry-related harassment occurring \"soon before death\".\n\n8. The death of a young woman within a year of marriage, under\nunnatural circumstances, inevitably invites serious legal scrutiny. Yet, even\nin such tragic cases, the Court must assess whether the evidentiary\nfoundation laid by the prosecution aligns with the statutory requirements. On\ncloser examination, prima facie the material on record in this case reveals\nsignificant ambiguities and lacks the specificity that\nSection 304B\nIPC\ndemands. The allegation of dowry demand, primarily the alleged demand for\na car, finds mention only in the post-incident statements made by the family\nof the deceased. Pertinently, there is no contemporaneous complaint by the\ndeceased, her parents, or any other relative during her lifetime alleging\nharassment or demand for dowry.\n\n9. Furthermore, the statements of the deceased's family members are\ndevoid of specific details, particularly with respect to the date, time, or\nfrequency of the alleged demands.\nIn this regard, it is crucial to refer to the\njudgement of the Supreme Court in\nSatbir Singh & Anr. v. State of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 7 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nHaryana,7\nthe relevant portion of which is extracted as under:\n\n16. The aforesaid position was emphasized by this Court, in the case of\n\nKans Raj v. State of Punjab\n, (2000) 5 SCC 207, wherein the three-Judge\nBench held that:\n\n\"15. ... \"Soon before\" is a relative term which is required to be\nconsidered under specific circumstances of each case and no straitjacket\nformula can be\nlaid down by\nfixing any time­limit. ... In relation to dowry\ndeaths, the circumstances showing the existence of cruelty or harassment\nto the deceased are not restricted to a particular instance but normally\nrefer to a course of conduct. Such conduct may be spread over a period\nof time. .... Proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on\ndowry demand and the consequential death is required to be proved by\nthe prosecution. The demand of dowry, cruelty or harassment based upon\nsuch demand and the date of death should not be too remote in time\nwhich, under the circumstances, be treated as having become stale\nenough.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\nA similar view was taken by this Court in\nRajinder Singh v. State of\nPunjab\n, (2015) 6 SCC 477.\n\n17. Therefore, Courts should use their discretion to determine if the\nperiod between the cruelty or harassment and the death of the victim\nwould come within the term \"soon before\". What is pivotal to the above\ndetermination, is the establishment of a \"proximate and live link\"\n\nbetween the cruelty and the consequential death of the victim.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n10. Therefore, it is a well-settled principle of law that, for the invocation\nof\nSection 304B\nIPC, it is mandatory to establish that the cruelty or\nharassment inflicted upon the deceased occurred \"soon before her death\",\ndemonstrating a proximate and live link between such cruelty and the\nconsequential demise of the victim. In the present case, the absence of any\nproximate allegation of dowry-related harassment close in time to the death\nin the present case, creates a doubt in the case of the Prosecution.\n\n11. At this stage, the Court is not to conduct a mini-trial, nor would it be\nappropriate to render findings that might prejudice either side. However, for\nthe limited purpose of assessing whether the statutory presumption under\n(2021) 6 SCC 1, see also:\nMahesh Kumar v. State of Haryana\n, (2019) 8 SCC 128.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 8 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nSection 304B\nIPC stands attracted, a prima facie examination of the record\nis warranted. In her testimony, the mother of the deceased stated that she,\nalong with other family members, frequently visited the deceased's\nmatrimonial home, and celebrated occasions such as Lohri, Makar\nSankranti, and Diwali, together with the Applicant's family. She further\nacknowledged having attended the birthday celebration of co-accused\nPrableen Kaur on 27th November 2023 at her daughter's matrimonial home,\njust two days prior to the unfortunate incident. This conduct, viewed in\ncontext, suggests that the deceased and her family remained on civil, if not\ncordial, terms with the Applicant's family until very shortly before her\ndeath. Prima facie, the record does not disclose any immediate or proximate\ninstance of dowry-related cruelty or harassment that could satisfy the\nthreshold of \"soon before her death\", thereby creating further doubt in the\nProsecution's version.\n\n12. It has further been alleged that the Applicant was involved in an illicit\nrelationship with co-accused Prableen Kaur, and that the deceased\npurportedly discovered them in a compromising position on two occasions\nin August 2023. While such allegations may carry emotional and moral\nweight, their veracity and relevance are matters that will be determined at\ntrial. However, even assuming arguendo that such a relationship existed, or\nthat vulgar or demeaning language was exchanged via WhatsApp between\nthe Applicant and his co-accused in reference to the deceased, these facts,\nstand alone, do not, prima facie, at this stage, disclose the specific\ningredients of cruelty or harassment in connection with a dowry demand.\nThis Court, in\nParul v. State (NCT of Delhi\n),8 while considering a bail plea\nunder\nSections 304B\n/\nIPC, held that an extra-marital relationship cannot\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 9 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nbe a ground to implicate the accused under\nSection 304B\nIPC. Such\nallegations, as noted above, must be accompanied by conduct (i) linked to a\ndowry demand, and (ii) shown to have occurred soon before the death of the\nwoman, in order to attract the offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC.\n\n13. This Court remains fully conscious of the societal gravity and\nenduring prevalence of dowry deaths. Such offences strike at the\nfoundations of dignity, equality, and justice in domestic life.\nIn\nShabeen\nAhmad v. State of U.P.,9\nthe Supreme Court cautioned that the grant of bail\nin such cases must not be mechanical or perfunctory, and that courts are\nrequired to exercise measured and informed judicial discretion, having\nregard not only to the seriousness of the charge, but also to the broader\nimplications of such offences on social conscience. However, the\nobservations in Shabeen Ahmad cannot be read as laying down a blanket\nprohibition against the grant of bail in every case under\nSection 304B\nIPC.\nRather, the Court reaffirmed that bail decisions must rest on the individual\nfacts and circumstances of each case, the nature and weight of the evidence,\nand the overall context in which the allegations are situated.\n\n14. In view of the above discussion, and upon a prima facie assessment of\nthe material on record, this Court is of the considered opinion that the\nApplicant has made out a case for grant of bail, particularly with respect to\nthe allegations under\nSection 304B\nIPC.\n\n15. As for the alternative offence under\nSection 306\nIPC, law demands a\nthreshold that is both high and precise. The Supreme Court has consistently\nemphasized that, for a charge under\nSection 306\nIPC to be sustained, the\naccused must have instigated, provoked, or engaged in facilitating or\n2023 SCC OnLine Del 5499.\n2025 SCC OnLine SC 479.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 10 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nencouraging the commission of suicide. The Prosecution, in such cases,\nmust be in a position to furnish evidence to establish beyond reasonable\ndoubt that any act or omission of the accused instigated the deceased to\ncommit suicide.10 In this context, the Supreme Court, in\nRamesh Kumar v.\nState of Chhattisgarh,11\nobserved as follows:\n\n\"20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to\ndo \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not\nnecessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what\nconstitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of\nthe consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence\nmust be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not a case where\nthe accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of\nconduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no\nother option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation may\nhave been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without\nintending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be\ninstigation.\"\n\n16. In the present case, prima facie, neither the Complainant nor the\nProsecution has alleged that the Applicant engaged in behaviour amounting\nto instigation, threat, or sustained cruelty of such a nature as to trigger the\ndeceased's suicide. There is no indication of affirmative acts, whether by\ncommission or omission, that drove the deceased to a state of desperation\nimmediately preceding her death. Consequently, the statutory threshold for\ninvoking\nSection 306\nIPC prima facie remains unsatisfied. The only\nallegations raised pertain to an alleged demand for a car as dowry, and an\nalleged extra-marital relationship between the Applicant and his sister-in-\nlaw. However, Courts have consistently held that mere suspicion of an extra-\nmarital affair, however morally reprehensible it may seem, does not per se\namount to abetment of suicide. The Supreme Court, in K.V. Prakash Babu\nGurjit Singh v. State of Punjab, (2020) 14 SCC 264.\n(2001) 9 SCC 618; see also:\nKumar @ Shiva Kumar v. State of Karnataka\n, 2024 INSC 156.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:AKANSHA SINGH BAIL APPLN. 2971/2024 Page 11 of 14\n\nSigning Date:22.04.2025\n\n19:53:46\n\nv. State of Karnataka,12 observed as follows:\n\n\"15. The concept of mental cruelty depends upon the milieu and the\nstrata from which the persons come from and definitely has an\nindividualistic perception regard being had to one's endurance and\nsensitivity. It is difficult to generalize but certainly it can be appreciated\nin a set of established facts. Extra-marital relationship, per se, or as such\nwould not come within the ambit of\nSection 498-A\nIPC. It would be an\nillegal or immoral act, but other ingredients are to be brought home so\nthat it would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of the fact\nthat the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal\nbehaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will\ndepend upon the facts of the said case. To explicate, solely because the\nhusband is involved in an extra-marital relationship and there is some\nsuspicion in the mind of wife, that cannot be regarded as mental\ncruelty which would attract mental cruelty for satisfying the ingredients\nof\nSection 306\nIPC.\"\n\n17. The Supreme Court clarified that, an extra-marital relationship per se\nmay not come within the ambit of\nSection 498-A\nIPC. In order to determine\nas to whether such a relationship amounts to cruelty to attract the offence\nunder\nSection 306\nIPC, the other essential ingredients of the said offence\nwill also need to be satisfied, which will depend upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each individual case. In the present case, the existence and\nfulfilment of such ingredients are issues to be adjudicated after conclusion of\nthe trial. Nonetheless, at this preliminary stage, the Court is of the prima\nfacie opinion that the invocation of\nSection 306\nIPC does not warrant the\ndenial of the relief of bail to the Applicant.\n\n18. It is also pertinent to note that the father-in-law and brother-in-law of\nthe deceased have already been discharged, and the sister-in-law, who faces\nidentical charges as the Applicant, has been granted bail. The Applicant was\narrested on 1st December, 2023 and has remained in judicial custody for over\none year. During this period, the Applicant was granted interim bail, and\n(2017) 11 SCC 176, see also:\nPinakin Mahipatray Rawal v.

The investigation stands concluded, and the charge sheet has already\nbeen filed. The case is presently at the stage of prosecution evidence, and\ngiven the nature of allegations and the number of witnesses cited, the trial is\nunlikely to conclude in the near future. In these circumstances, continued\nincarceration of the Applicant would serve no fruitful purpose.\n\n19. It is well-established that the object of granting bail is neither punitive\nnor preventative. The primary aim sought to be achieved by bail is to secure\nthe attendance of the accused person at the trial.13 Accordingly, in light of\nthe foregoing facts and circumstances, the Applicant is directed to be\nreleased on bail on furnishing a personal bond for a sum of INR 50,000/-\nwith two sureties of the like amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial\nCourt/Duty MM, on the following conditions:\n\na.
