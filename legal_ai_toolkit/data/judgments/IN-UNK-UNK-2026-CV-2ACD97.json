Its\npersonnel consist of large number of civilian scientists as\nwell as a smaller number of service officers drawn from the\nthree wings of the Armed Forces who have operational\nexperience of weapon systems.\n The policy followed in regard to the intake of service\nofficers was that they were initially taken on a tenure\nbasis and subsequently absorbed in the organisation on a\npermanent basis in the event of being found suitable and\nwilling. Since the Officers from the three services came to\nthe R & D cadre with different lengths of service and at\ndifferent levels, it became imperative to evolve a\nreasonable principle for the determination of their inter-se\nseniority after their secondment to the organisation.\n In November 1979 in supersession of all previous Rules\nand Orders on the subject, rules were made under the proviso\nto \nArt. 309\n laying down the procedure for the intake of\nservice officers in the R & D organisation and the terms and\nconditions of service of those permanently retained therein.\nRule 16 dealt with \"Seniority after permanent secondment\"\nand provided that \"seniority of all service Officers\npermanently seconded to DRDO will continue to be based upon\ntheir seniority of substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt.\nCdr..........and the\n454\nseniority of officers with substantive ranks higher than\nMajor/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. will after their permanent\nsecondment also reckon vis-a-vis other officers in the R & D\nCadre, for future promotion/confirmation, from the date of\ntheir substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr.........\n\".\n The appellant who was commissioned in the Air Force was\nseconded to the service. In his writ petition he contended\nthat the principle for determination of seniority laid down\nin Rule 16 was arbitrary and violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n\nof the Constitution, and as he had been permanently seconded\nto the R & D Organisation in 1971 long prior to the\nproclamation of the rule his rights regarding seniority and\npromotion could not be affected by the provisions of this\nrule. By taking the date of substantive appointment to the\nrank of Major/ equivalent as the basis for reckoning\nseniority, officers who had obtained substantive promotions\nto higher ranks in the parent service earlier than some of\ntheir seniors who were only subsequently promoted to such\nhigher ranks, suffer serious prejudice because the latter\ngain over the earlier promotees and supersede them in the\nmatter of seniority in the R & D Organisation, and that\nsubsequent inductees in the R & D Organisation cannot be\nlegally assigned seniority above those already borne on the\ncadre, irrespective of the substantive rank held by them at\nthe time of their intake into the R & D.\n The Single Judge rejected all the contentions and\ndeclined to grant relief. The R & D Organisation was however\ndirected to issue the tentative seniority list drawn up in\naccordance with Rule 16. The Letters Patent Appeal filed by\nthe appellant was dismissed in limine.\n Dismissing the appeal to this Court,\n^\n HELD: 1. Since officers from different sources are\ntaken into the R & D Organisation for meeting the\ndiscipline-wise requirements arising therein from time to\ntime and they are brought into a common pool on such\npermanent secondment, a reasonable principle had to be\nevolved for fixation of inter se seniority within the R & D\ncadre. The principle adopted under Rule 4 of reckoning\nseniority with reference to the date of attainment of the\nrank of substantive Major/equivalent strikes a reasonable\nmean as it ensures to all the service officers in the R & D\nthe fixation of seniority in the integrated cadre giving\nfull credit to the length of service put in by them in their\nrespective parent services. [466 C; 466 H; 467 A]\n 2. It is settled law that the service conditions\npertaining to seniority are liable to alteration by\nsubsequent changes that may be introduced in the rules and\nexcept to the extent of protecting promotions that have\nalready been earned under the previous rules, the revised\nrules will operate to govern seniority and future promotion\nprospects. There is, therefore, no substance in the argument\nadvanced by the appellant that it was not open to the\nGovernment of India to introduce a new principle of\nseniority by promulgation of Rule 16 so as to affect his\nrights for future promotion. [463 D-E]\n 3. A statement contained in the statute or statutory\nrule of the factual background leading up to the enactment\nhas ordinarily to be accepted and acted upon by the court as\nwholly correct. [463 A]\n455\n 4. Rule 16 contains a categorical declaration that in\nthe past also the seniority of service officers permanently\nseconded to the R & D Organisation was being reckoned on the\nbasis of their dates of attainment of substantive rank of\nMajor/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. subject to any penalty/loss of\nseniority that an officer might suffer subsequently. It is\ntherefore not possible to accept the contention of the\nappellant that prior to the coming into force of the rule be\nhad acquired a vested right to have his seniority in the R &\nD reckoned with reference to the date of his permanent\nsecondment and to have all Officers joining the organisation\non subsequent dates ranked only below him. [462 G-H; 463 B-\nC]\n 5. The structure and composition of the Organisation\nhave necessarily to undergo rapid, qualitative and\nquantitative changes in the light of the fast developments\nthat take place in science technology and international\nrelations. The intake of service Officers is not on the\nbasis of any general selection from service cadres. As and\nwhen the Organisation finds it necessary to obtain the\nservice of officers with operational experience in any\nparticular weapon system or other scientific discipline the\nparent service is requested to spare for deputation suitable\nhands in the particular branch or speciality and initially\nthey are taken on a tenure basis. There is a selection only\nin a very limited sense that the suitability of the\nconcerned officer is adjudged before he is taken but the\nclaims or merits of others are not considered. The\nsecondment of such officers to the R & D Organisation is not\ntherefore, effected on the basis of a general selection.\nOfficers who are senior in the parent service in relation to\nthe person who is seconded and who may possess greater\nexperience and superior attainment might not have been\nconsidered for secondment when their juniors in the service\nwere seconded to the R & D Organisation, because the parent\nservice might not have been in the position at the relevant\npoint of time to spare the services of the former. [463 G-H;\n464 A-E]\n 6. Where persons from different sources are drafted to\nserve in a new service a just and wholesome principle\ncommonly applied is that the pre existing length of service\nin the parent department should be respected and preserved\nby taking the same into account in determining their ranking\nin the new service cadre. Such a provision does not involve\nany discrimination violative of \nArticle 16\n of the\nConstitution. [470 E]\n R.S. Makashi & Ors. v. I.M. Menon & Ors., [1982] 1\nS.C.C. 379, referred to.\n 7. The secondment of an officer from his parent service\nto the R & D is not a transfer to Central Service from a\nsubordinate service or from another department. [469 G]\n 8. Rule 16 being statutory in origin, its validity\ncannot be affected by reason of any inconsistency with the\nprovision of a prior executive order issued by the Central\nGovernment i.e. Office Memorandum dated July 22,1972.\n[469 H]\n 9. When a statutory rule governing seniority is issued\nin respect of a service, the said rule would govern the\npersonnel in the service with effect from the date of its\npromulgation and in so giving effect to the rule in future,\nno element of retroactivity is involved. [470 G-H]\n456\n 10. The promulgation of a statutory rule governing\nseniority is not a quasi-judicial function. It is the\nexercise of a legislative power and in respect thereof the\nprinciples of natural justice have no application at all.\n[472 B]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1742 of\n1980.\n\n Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order\ndated the 11th day of April, 1980 of the Delhi High Court in\nL.P.A. No. 53 of 1980.\n\n WITH\n Civil Misc. Petitions Nos. 69 and 5698 of 1981.\n Wing Commander J. Kumar Appellant in Person.\n P.A. Francis, Narayan Nettar and Miss A. Subhashini,\nfor the Respondent.\n\n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n BALAKRISHNA ERADI, J. This appeal by special leave is\ndirected against the judgment of a Division Bench of the\nDelhi High Court dismissing in limine a Letters Patent\nAppeal filed by the present appellant against the judgment\nof a learned Single Judge of that Court whereby the\ncontentions raised by the appellant in Civil Writ Petition\nNo. 1423 of 1979 were rejected and the said writ petition\nwas dismissed.\n\n The appellant-Wing Commander J. Kumar-was commissioned\nin the Indian Air Force on September 3, 1956 with antedated\nseniority from December 10, 1955. He was permanently\nseconded to the Defence Research Development and Inspection\nOrganisation (for short, the L R D & I Organisation) of the\nMinistry of Defence on October 14, 1971. On the bifurcation\nof the LRL & I Organisation effected in July 1976 by the\nseparation of the Inspection Wing, the appellant was\nretained in the Defence Research and Development\nOrganisation, which will hereinafter be referred to as the R\n& D Organisation. The Director-General of Defence Research\nand Development, who is also the Secretary to Government of\nIndia, Defence Research, is the controlling authority of the\nR & D cadre. The said cadre has service officers drawn from\nall the three Wings of the Armed Forces, namely, the Army,\nthe Navy and the Air\n\n457\n\nForce, and in addition thereto a large number of civilian\nemployees are also borne on it.\n\n In November 1979, in supersession of all previous Rules\nand Orders on the subject, the President of India\npromulgated under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the\nConstitution rules laying down the procedure for the intake\nof service officers in the R & D Organisation and the terms\nand conditions of service of those permanently retained\ntherein. Those rules were issued by the Ministry of Defence\nof the Government of India in Office Memorandum No.\nPers/18601/RD. Sel. Bd/7971/D (R&D) dated November 23, 1979.\nThe provisions of the said Memorandum will hereinafter be\nreferred to as the rules. Rule 16 deals with the subject of\n\"Seniority after permanent secondment\". That rule is in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n \"As hithertofore seniority of all service officers\n permanently seconded to DRDO will continue to be based\n upon their seniority of substantive rank of Major/Sqn.\n Ldr./Lt. Cdr., subject to any penalty/loss of seniority\n that an officer might suffer subsequently and the\n seniority of officers with substantive ranks higher\n than Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. will after their\n permanent secondment, also reckon vis-a-vis other\n officers in the R&D Cadre, for future\n promotion/confirmation, from the date of their\n substantive rank of Major/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr., subject\n to any penalty/loss of seniority that an officer might\n have suffered in his parent Arm/Service.\"\n\n The principal contention advanced by the appellant\nbefore us is that the principle for determination of\nseniority laid down in the above rule is arbitrary and\nviolative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nAlternatively, it is contended by the appellant that since\nhe had been permanently seconded to the R&D Organisation in\n1971, long prior to the promulgation of the impugned rules,\nhis rights regarding seniority and promotions cannot, in any\nway, be effected by the provisions of the new rule.\nAccording to the appellant, he continues to be governed by\nthe principles that had been originally laid down in\nGovernment of India (Ministry of Defence) Memorandum dated\nMarch 18, 1967, which were the rules in force at the time of\nhis secondment to the R&D Organisation. It is the further\ncase of the appellant that the R&D being an independent\nOrganisation, the seniority of the personnel absorbed\ntherein has to be reckoned only with reference to the dates\non which they were\n\n458\n\nselected and appointed in the said Organisation and\nsubsequent entrants into the R&D in any particular category\nor rank should, therefore, be placed only below all those\nwho had already joined the Organisation by virtue of\npermanent secondment. The appellant also contends that by\ntaking the date of substantive appointment to the rank of\nMajor/equivalent as the basis for reckoning seniority,\nofficers who had obtained substantive promotions to higher\nranks in the parent service earlier than some of their\nseniors who were only subsequently promoted to such higher\nranks, will suffer very serious prejudice because the latter\nwill gain a march over the earlier promotees and supersede\nthem in the matter of seniority in the R&D Organisation.\nElaborating this plea, it was urged on behalf of the\nappellant that the result of the impugned rule would be to\nbring about the anomalous situation where a person\npermanently seconded to the R&D and holding substantively\nthe rank of Lt.Col./equivalent can be superseded in\nseniority in the said Organisation by a Major/equivalent of\nold vintage who had been overlooked for promotion in his\nparent service and may have thereupon come over to the R&D\nOrganisation. Another objection strongly put forward by the\nappellant was against the lateral induction of officers at\nlevels higher than that of substantive Major/equivalent. It\nwas urged by the appellant that such subsequent inductees\ninto the R&D Organisation cannot be legally assigned\nseniority above those already borne on the cadre,\nirrespective of the substantive rank held by them at the\ntime of their intake into the R&D. The appellant has rested\nthis contention on the premise that the intake of officers\ninto the R&D is by a selection based on merit and hence\nthose selected earlier must necessarily rank higher in the\nseniority list of the Organisation in relation to those who\nare selected and appointed in the Organisation only on later\ndates. The appellant has urged a further point before us\nthat the seniority of officers of the Navy, Army and Air\nForce holding equivalent ranks who served in the\nOrganisation is governed by the principle laid down in\nRegulation No. 251 of the \"Naval Ceramonials, Conditions of\nService and Miscellaneous Regulations, 1964\", and the\nimpugned rule in so far as it is contrary to the principle\nlaid down in the said Regulation has to be declared as\ninvalid and inoperative. Some other incidental pleas and\ngrievances were also put forward by the appellant before the\nHigh Court as well as before us and we shall be dealing with\nthem later on at the appropriate stage.\n\n The learned Single Judge of the High Court rejected all\nthe aforesaid contentions advanced by the appellant and\ndeclined to\n\n459\n\ngrant any relief to him, except to the extent of directing\nthe R&D Organisation to issue the tentative seniority list\ndrawn up in accordance with the impugned rule within three\nmonths from the date of the judgment and to record the\nAnnual Confidential Reports on the appellant from April 1,\n1976 to March 31, 1979 within the same period. The Letters\nPatent Appeal filed by the appellant against the said\njudgment having been dismissed in limine by a Division Bench\nof the High Court, the appellant has preferred this appeal\nafter obtaining special leave from this Court.\n\n The Defence Research and Development Organisation (R&D)\nhas been set up under the Ministry of Defence for carrying\non scientific and technological research and development\nwork on projects of vital importance to the defence forces\nof this country. The head of the said Organisation is a\ncivilian, namely, the Scientific Adviser to the Defence\nMinistry and its personnel consist of a large number of\ncivilian scientists and a much smaller number of service\nofficers drawn from the three defence services. The service\nofficers are initially taken on short tenure and are later\npermanently seconded to the R&D Organisation if found\nsuitable and willing. Those service officers who were\npermanently seconded and absorbed in the R&D cadre are\nthereafter governed by the terms and conditions of service\napplicable to the officers of the said cadre.\n\n Originally, the Defence Research and Development\nOrganisation (R&D) and the Director-General of Inspection\n(DGI) had a combined cadre-Research Development and\nInspection-and the terms and conditions of service of the\npersonnel borne on the said cadre were governed by the\nprovisions contained in Government of India (Ministry of\nDefence) Memorandum No. 11/(5)/58/D-(R&D) dated March 18,\n1967. But, those rules which had also been issued by the\nPresident of India under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the\nConstitution did not contain any provision laying down the\nprinciples for determination of the seniority of the\nofficers functioning in the DRD&I Organisation. Those rules\nwere in force at the time when the appellant was permanently\nseconded to the DRD&I Organisation in 1971.\n\n In the writ petition filed in the High Court, the\nappellant had impleaded 8 officers of the R&D Organisation,\nnamely, respondents nos. 7 and 11 to 17 contending that they\nhave been assigned seniority and granted promotions in\nsupersession of the appellants's legitimate claims and in\nviolation of the rules. In the appeal before\n\n460\n\nthis Court, the appellant had added several more service\nofficers of the R&D as additional respondents. The appellant\nargued his case in person and so did some of the respondents\nwhose promotions and seniority etc., have been challenged by\nthe appellant.\n\n Arguments advanced by the parties appearing in person\nwere heard by us at considerable length and Shri P.A\nFrancis, Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of Respondents\nNos. 1 and 2, namely, the Union of India and the Director-\nGeneral, R&D Organisation, also addressed arguments before\nus covering all the aspects.\n\n As already noticed, the main contentions put forward by\nthe appellant are two-fold, namely, that the principles laid\ndown in rule 16 of the rules for determination of the\nseniority of officers permanently seconded to the R&D are\narbitrary and illegal, and that lateral induction of\nofficers holding ranks above substantive Major/equivalent\nand assigning of seniority to such subsequent inductees by\napplying the provisions of rule 16 amounts to deprivation of\nthe vested rights of persons-like the appellant-who had\njoined the Organisation earlier and it is, therefore,\nillegal and unwarranted.\n\n After giving our best consideration to the arguments\nadvanced on both sides, we do not see any substance in\neither of the aforesaid contentions advanced by the\nappellant,\n The Defence Research Development and Inspection\nOrganisation is a Specialised Technological Organisation set\nup under the Ministry of Defence for carrying out research\nand development work in weapons like guns, electronics,\nmissiles, tanks etc. Its personnel consist of a large number\nof civilian scientists (about 3,600) and about 430 service\nofficers drawn from all the three Wings of the Armed Forces\nwith operational experience of such weapon system to work\nwith the scientists in the research and development\nprogramme. The policy followed in regard to the intake of\nservice officers appears to have been to take them initially\non a tenure basis and subsequently to absorb them in the\nOrganisation on a permanent basis in the event of their\nbeing found suitable and willing. It is seen from the\naffidavits and documents filed on behalf of the respondents\nthat the secondment of service officers depended upon the\nexigencies and the special type of need of the Organisation\nat each relevant point of time so much so that officers who\ncould fill the bill by virtue of their qualification,\nexperience, aptitude and suitability in that particular\nbranch of defence science for which the need\n\n461\n\nfor personnel had arisen and whose services could be spared\nby their parent service were taken into the R&D Organisation\nfrom time to time. Since the officers from the three\nservices came to the R&D cadre with different lengths of\nservice and at different levels, it became imperative to\nevolve a reasonable principle for determination of their\ninter se seniority after their secondment to the R&D\nOrganisation.\n\n The case of the respondents is that right from the\nbeginning, the policy and practice followed by DRD&I\nOrganisation as well as by the bifurcated R&D Organisation\nwas to assign seniority with reference to the date on which\nthe officers attained their rank of substantive\nMajor/equivalent. This was, however, strongly refuted by the\nappellant who asserts that no such principle had been\nformulated or followed by the Organisation prior to the\npromulgation of the impugned rules. The respondents produced\nfor our perusal various files pertaining to the\ndetermination of seniority and grant of promotions in the\nOrganisation during the period prior to the issuance of the\nimpugned rules. The appellant pointed out with reference to\nthose very files that there were quite a few instances where\npromotions had been effected on a basis totally at variance\nwith the principle propounded by the respondents.\n\n From a scrutiny of the files of the Ministry of\nDefence-R&D Organisation-produced before us by the learned\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the Government of India, it\nhas clearly emerged that, excepting for a few stray\ninstances, the practice followed in the R&D Organisation was\nto reckon the seniority of the permanently seconded officers\nwith reference to the date of their attaining substantive\nrank of Major/equivalent. The principle underlying the said\npractice was later formally incorporated in the Minutes of\nthe DRD&I Selection Board as a decision taken by the Board\nat its meeting held in February 1974. The relevant paragraph\nof the Minutes runs thus:\n\n \"Officers with substantive ranks higher than\n Maj/Sqn Ldr/Lt Cdr who are offered permanent secondment\n will reckon their substantive seniority in the\n R&D/Inspection Organisation for future\n promotion/confirmation from the date they got their\n substantive ranks as Maj/Sqn Ldr and subject to any\n penalties as regards loss of seniority that they might\n have suffered in their Arm/Service thereafter. The\n\n462\n\n position as above should be clarified to the officers\n concerned and their acceptance obtained before issuing\n the orders of permanent secondment in such cases. These\n decisions will apply to cases of permanent secondment\n approved by the RD&I Selection Board from 2(74) meeting\n onwards.\"\n\nIt is also seen from the files pertaining to the period\nsubsequent to February 1974 that the aforesaid principle was\nthereafter consistently followed as a binding rule and when\nit was found that a departure from the said principle had\nbeen erroneously made by placing three Air Force officers in\ntheir substantive rank of Wing Commander, the authorities\nconcerned rectified the said mistake after clearly noting in\nthe file that the aforesaid principle went unnoticed by\noversight during the processing of those cases by HQ, R&D\nand the ranking of those officers was revised so as to bring\nit into conformity with the aforesaid rule.\n\n The relevant file leading up to the issuance of the\nimpugned rules was also carefully perused by us. This file\ncontains the Minutes of the Chief of Staff Committee\nrecommending to the Government of India that the draft rules\nmay be finally accepted and issued expeditiously and the\nnoting therein also contains a clear statement that the\nprinciple incorporated in the decision taken at the combined\nmeeting of the DRD&I Selection Board held in February 1974\nwas merely to incorporate \"a rule which was unwritten\nearlier but actually applied in practice\". Thus, there is\nsufficient material available on record to substantiate the\nplea put forward by the respondents that the policy and\npractice followed in the DR&DI Organisation and later in the\nR&D Organisation was to fix the seniority of permanently\nseconded officers with reference to the date of attainment\nof the rank of substantive Major/ equivalent.\n\n Further, the impugned rules are statutory in origin as\nthey have been promulgated by the President of India under\nthe proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution. Rule 16\ncontains a categorial declaration that in the past also the\nseniority of service officers permanently seconded to the\nR&D Organisation was being reckoned on the basis of their\ndates of attainment of substantive rank of Major/Sqn Ldr/Lt\nCdr. subject to any penalty/loss of seniority that an\nofficer might suffer subsequently. The said declaration is\nclearly implied in the opening words \"As hithertofore\"\n\noccurring in rule 16\n\n463\n\nof the impugned rules. A statement contained in a statute or\nstatutory rule of the factual background leading up to the\nenactment has ordinarily to be accepted and acted upon by\nthe court as wholly correct; nothing clinching has been\nbrought to our notice by the appellant to justify any\ndeparture from the said principle. We do not, therefore,\nfind it possible to accept the contention of the appellant\nthat prior to the coming into force of the impugned rule, he\nhad acquired a vested right to have his seniority in the R&D\nreckoned with reference to the date of his permanent\nsecondment and to have all officers joining the Organisation\non subsequent dates ranked only below him. The plea advanced\nby the appellant that the impugned rules have illegally\npurported to divest him of his vested rights of seniority\nand promotion in the R&D must, therefore, be rejected as\ndevoid of merit.\n\n Apart from what is stated above, it is settled law that\nthe service conditions pertaining to seniority are liable to\nalteration by subsequent changes that may be introduced in\nthe rules and except to the extent of protecting promotions\nthat have already been earned under the previous rules, the\nrevised rules will operate to govern the seniority and\nfuture promotion prospects of all the persons in the\nconcerned service. There is, therefore, no substance in the\nargument advanced by the appellant that it was not open to\nthe Government of India to introduce a new principle of\nseniority by promulgation of the impugned rules so as to\naffect his rights for future promotion.\n\n The next question to be considered is whether the\nprinciple enunciated in rule 16 can be said to be\nunreasonable or arbitrary, as contended by the appellant. It\nis in this context that the specialised character of the R&D\nOrganisation assumes importance. Its personnel consist of\ncivilian scientists and service officers of high\ntechnological attainments in different disciplines who have\nbeen drawn to the Organisation from time to time according\nto its exigencies and needs.\n\n The structure and composition of the Organisation have\nnecessarily to undergo rapid qualitative and quantitative\nchanges in the light of the fast developments that take\nplace in the field of science and technology as well as in\ninternational relations. The research and development work\nis carried on by the R&D in different systems of weapons and\nequipments and a variety of disciplines like electronics,\nmissiles, tanks, telecommunication, rocketry, radars\n\n464\n\netc. In addition to about 3,600 civilian scientists, the\nOrganisation has about 160 permanently seconded service\nofficers and about 430 service officers taken on a tenure\nbasis. The intake of service officers is not on the basis of\nany general selection from service cadres. As and when the\nOrganisation finds it necessary to obtain the services of\nofficers with operational experience in any particular\nweapon system or other scientific discipline, suitable hands\nwith aptitude skill and experience in that particular branch\nor speciality whom their parent service is willing to spare\nfor deputation are initially taken on a tenure basis. Thus,\nthere is a selection only in a very limited sense that the\nsuitability of the concerned officer is adjudged before he\nis taken. But what is important to note is that in the\nintake of officers into R&D Organisation there is no\ncomparative evaluation of the merits of the other personnel\noccupying the same rank or possessing like experience in the\nDefence Services. There is no process of selection in which\ntheir claims or merits are considered. Thus, it is clear\nthat the secondment of officers to the R&D Organisation is\nnot effected on the basis of a general selection. There is,\ntherefore, no substance in the contention advanced by the\nappellant that the service officers who are seconded to the\nR & on a later date must take rank only below all those who\nhad joined the Organisation earlier by virtue of their prior\n\"selection\". Officers who are senior in the parent service\nin relation to the person who is seconded and who may\npossess greater experience and superior attainments might\nnot have been considered for secondment when their juniors\nin the service were seconded to the R & D Organisation,\nbecause the parent service might not have been in the\nposition at the relevant point of time to spare the services\nof the former. Further, the discipline-wise requirement in\nthe R & D at any particular time will depend upon the nature\nof the project then taken on hand and posting of a service\nofficer to the R & D Organisation will be on the\nconsideration of his experience and aptitude for that\nparticular type of specialised work and not seniority in the\nparent service. It may well happen that a junior officer who\nhas experience and expertise in that special discipline\nalone may be considered for secondment at that particular\ntime. Thus, the entry of a service officer into the R & D is\nto a large extent dependant on fortuitous circumstances\nrelated to the exigencies and needs that arise in the\nOrganisation from time to time. It is certainly not based on\nthe result of any comparative evaluation of his merit,\nability or suitability as against those of his compeers in\nthe concerned parent service. Such being the factual\nsituation, we are of the view that\n\n465\n\nit will not be reasonable, just or fair to determine the\nseniority of the permanently seconded service personnel\nmerely on the basis of the date of their secondment to the\nOrganisation.\n\n The next question to be considered is whether the\nprinciple for determination of seniority laid down in the\nimpugned rule 16 is just, fair and reasonable or whether it\nis arbitrary and violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution, as contended by the appellant.\n\n The R & D Organisation has in its cadre service\nofficers who were taken initially on tenure basis from the\nArmy, the Air Force and the Navy and were later on\npermanently seconded into the DRD & I/ R & D cadre on their\nbeing found suitable and willing. The contention of the\nappellant is that on such permanent secondment into the R &\nD, the inter se seniority of the officers should be reckoned\nonly with reference to the dates of their selection for such\npermanent secondment. It is the further plea of the\nappellant that since at the time of permanent secondment the\nofficer concerned has to certify in writing that he is\nrelinquishing all his claims of seniority etc., in his\nparent service, no weightage can thereafter be given to the\nrank or seniority which the person inducted had earned in\nhis parent service prior to the date of his permanent\nsecondment. We do not find it possible to accept this\ncontention. Officers from the three Services holding\ndifferent ranks are inducted into R & D Organisation from\ntime to time depending upon the needs of the Organisation,\nand if the appellant's contention is to be accepted, it\nwould lead to serious anomalies and manifest injustice by\nupsetting the norms of seniority and rank structure which is\nthe basic fabric on which the Armed Forces of the country\nare built. The unreasonable consequences that will flow from\nthe acceptance of the appellant's arguments will be clearly\nseen from the following simple illustration:\n\n Suppose, in the year 1974, on a particular date, when\ntwo officers are working in the Air Force-one as a Wing\nCommander and the other in the higher rank of Group Captain-\nthe Wing Commander is permanently seconded to the R & D\nOrganisation and, later, the Group Captain is also\npermanently seconded to the R & D in 1975. If the principle\nadvocated by the appellant is to be accepted, the Group\nCaptain will become junior to the Wing Commander by virtue\nof the latter's earlier induction into the R & D despite the\nfact that he had not been even considered for secondment to\nthe R & D at the time when the Wing Commander was taken.\n\n466\n\n In view of our having already found that the\nappellant's contention that the secondment to the R & D is\nbased on a \"selection\" is incorrect, the basic premise on\nwhich the appellant has founded his plea that the date of\nsecondment should be the determinative factor for reckoning\nseniority in the R & D cadre, falls to the ground.\n\n Since officers from different sources are taken into\nthe R & D for meeting the discipline-wise requirements\narising in the Organisation from time to time and they are\nbrought into a common pool on such permanent secondment, it\nis inevitable that a reasonable principle has to be evolved\nfor fixation of the their inter se seniority within the R &\nD cadre. The fixation of the seniority on the basis of the\nranks held by them in the different branches of the Armed\nForces would not be reasonable or fair, because substantive\nranks above Major/equivalent in the three Wings of the Armed\nForces are conferred by different Selection Boards at\ndifferent times and under varying circumstances and\nconditions depending upon the vacancies arising at the\ndifferent levels in the distinct services from time to time.\nIt is pointed out in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf\non the Union of India (Respondent No. 1) that the\npromotional chances of officers belonging to the three\ndistinct Wings of the Armed Forces to posts above the rank\nof Major/equivalent vary widely and dependant upon\nfortuitous circumstances which may obtain in relation to the\ndistinct services at any relevant point of time. We find\nthere is force in this submission. In all the three\nServices, the promotions up to and inclusive of the rank of\nMajor/equivalent are time-scale promotions based only on\nfixed length of service. In the Air Force and the Army, the\nranks of Major and Sqn. Leader, respectively, are attained\non an officer putting in 13 years' service. In the Navy, the\ntime-scale period for promotion to the equivalent rank of\nLt. Commander is said to vary between about 10 and 13 years.\nBut, what is important to notice is that the promotion to\nthe rank of Major/equivalent is based only on length of\nservice and not on any \"selection\". For posts higher than\nthat of Major/equivalent, promotions in all the three\nServices would depend upon the occurrence of vacancies in\nthe particular branch or group in the concerned Service, the\nschemes of expansion that may be taken up from time to time\nin the particular Service or branch and also the extent of\nstagnation that may be caused to officers at lower levels by\nreason of the officers who are young in age occupying posts\nin the immediate higher levels, etc. When due regard is had\nto all the aspects and circumstances, narrated above, it\nwill be seen that the\n\n467\n\nprinciple adopted under the impugned rule of reckoning\nseniority with reference to a date of attainment of the rank\nof substantive Major/equivalent strikes a reasonable mean as\nit ensures to all the service officers in the R & D the\nfixation of seniority in the integrated cadre giving full\ncredit to the length of service put in by them in their\nrespective parent services.\n\n \nA similar seniority rule formulated by the State of\nMaharashtra in a somewhat like situation, when an integrated\ncadre consisting of personnel drawn from different sources\nwas formed in the State of Maharashtra for administering the\nRationing Scheme, was recently upheld by this Court in \nR.S.\nMakashi & Ors. v. I.M. Menon & Ors.\n(1)\n The following observations contained in that judgment\nare apposite in the present context:\n\n \"When personnel drawn from different sources are\n being absorbed and integrated in a new department, it\n is primarily for the Government or the executive\n authority concerned to decide as a matter of policy how\n the equation of posts should be effected. The courts\n will not interfere with such a decision unless it is\n shown to be arbitrary, unreasonable or unfair, and if\n no manifest unfairness or unreasonableness is made out,\n the court will not sit in appeal and examine the\n propriety or wisdom of the principle of equation of\n posts adopted by the Governments.\"\n\n In enunciating the principle incorporated in the\nimpugned rule, the rule-making authority has adopted as the\nbase for reckoning seniority the highest common factor\napplicable in respect of time scale promotions in the three\nservices, namely the rank of Major/equivalent and thereby\nensured to the service officers seconded to the R & D\nOrganisation a just and equitable treatment. The rule\nprovides for the reckoning of the seniority of the seconded\nofficers by taking into account the length of their service\nin the parent service, for which the date of attainment of\nthe rank of substantive Major/equivalent would furnish a\nsafe index. In our opinion, the said principle cannot be\nsaid to be arbitrary, unjust or unreasonable and the\ncontention to contrary put forward by the appellant will,\ntherefore, stand rejected.\n\n468\n\n It is no doubt true that in the Navy, promotions to the\nrank of Lt. Commander which is equivalent to that of Major\nin the Army may be attained by an officer within a slightly\nshorter period of service, namely, between 10 and 13 years\nwhereas, in the Army and the Air Force, the promotion to the\nrank of Major/equivalent is given only on completion of 13\nyears of service. The slight disparity in the promotion\nprospects between the Navy and the other two Services will\nnot, however, affect the reasonableness of the impugned rule\nbecause it is impossible to achieve perfect arithmetical\nprecision in such matters where officers drawn from\ndifferent sources are to be integrated into one common cadre\nand a rule for fixing their inter se seniority is\nformulated. Further, it is seen from the counter-affidavits\nof Respondents 1 to 3 that out of about 160 permanently\nseconded officers of the R & D Organisation, the large\nmajority are from the Army, a considerable section of the\nbalance is from the Air Force and only less than 10 officers\nhave come from the Navy.\n\n It is also relevant to notice in this context that it\nis specifically provided in rule 4 of the impugned rule that\nthe intake of service officers to fill appointments in the R\n& D Organisation will ordinarily be at Major/equivalent\nlevel. Under rule 5, officers in higher ranks should be\nconsidered for permanent secondment only in exceptional\ncases and when such a course is adopted, it will be subject\nto the condition that their seniority in the R & D cadre\nwill be fixed as stipulated in rule 16. The incorporation of\nthe aforesaid provisions which operate as a safeguard\nagainst large scale induction of officers above the\nsubstantive rank of Major/equivalent further fortifies the\nconclusion arrived at by us that the adoption of the date of\nsubstantive Major/equivalent as the criterion for fixing\ninter se seniority in the R & D cadre was logically fair,\njust and reasonable.\n\n The appellant sought to rely strongly on Regulation 251\nof the Naval Ceremonials, Conditions of Service and\nMiscellaneous Regulations, 1954 and on the provisions\ncontained in the Order AO102/73. Regulation 251 provides\nthat \"the relative seniority of officers of the Army, Navy\nand Air Force, holding equivalent ranks, who serve together\nin an Inter-service Organisation will be regulated as\nfollows.\" The latter Order is in the following terms:\n\n \"(a) Officers holding equivalent substantive rank (no\n acting rank) will rank according to their\n seniority in the substantive rank; and\n\n469\n\n (b) Officers holding acting rank will rank after\n officers holding corresponding substantive rank\n and in relation to each other, they will rank\n according to their seniority in the substantive\n rank.\"\n\n In our opinion, neither the Regulation aforementioned\nnor the Order, extracted above, has any application to the\npresent situation. The R & D Organisation is not an Inter-\nservice Organisation within the meaning of the expression as\nused in the aforementioned Regulation and Order. It is\npredominantly a civil organisation headed by a civilian\nDirector-General and having a total strength of about 24,000\nemployees. The large majority of the personnel working in\nthe R & D Organisation are civilian scientists who are more\nthan 3,000 in number, there are also about 160 service\nofficers permanently seconded to the R & D cadre and about\n240 service officers taken on tenure basis. But, merely\nbecause the R & D Organisation has on its staff serving\nofficers from the Army, Air Force and Navy, it cannot be\nsaid to be an \"Inter-service Organisation\" governed by the\nprovisions of the aforesaid Regulation and Order. The topic\ndealt with in the aforesaid Regulation and Order is only\n\"seniority\" for purposes of command, precedence, discipline\netc., for working purposes to be allied in situations where\nofficers from more than one service operate together in one\ngroup as in times of war for carrying out any particular\nmission or task.\n\n Another argument advanced by the appellant was that the\nimpugned rule cannot be upheld as valid inasmuch as it is in\nconflict with paragraph 7 of the Government of India Office\nMemorandum No. 9372 Estt(D), Cabinet Secretariat, Department\nof Personnel, dated July 22, 1972, which is in the following\nterms:\n\n \"7. Transferees:-(i) The relative seniority of\n persons appointed by transfer to Central Services from\n the subordinate offices of the Central Government or\n other department shall be determined in accordance with\n the order of their selection for such transfer.\"\n\nWe see no substance in this contention. The secondment of an\nofficer from his parent service to the R&D is not a transfer\nto Central Service from a subordinate service or from\nanother department. Further, the impugned rule being\nstatutory in origin, its validity cannot be affected by\nreason of any inconsistency with the provisions of a prior\nexecutive order issued by the Central Government.\n\n470\n\n An allegation has been put forward by the appellant\nthat \"the letter dated November 23, 1979 was a fraud on\nrules and the Constitution, played by respondent no. 5 who\ngot the same issued to obtain personal gain by misusing his\nofficial position, leading to colourable exercise of power\nby the authority who actually issued that letter\". To put it\nmildly, we find that this is a reckless allegation devoid of\nany factual basis. We have gone through the files leading up\nto the issuance of the impugned rules and it is seen\ntherefrom that the matter has been processed by different\nauthorities at different stages and before the draft rules\nwere ultimately submitted to the Government of India for\napproval, they had been considered and approved at a joint\nmeeting of the Chiefs of Staff also.\n\n \nEqually untenable is the further plea advanced by the\nappellant that since the R&D is an integrated cadre, there\ncannot be any further classification of the officers\ncomprised therein on the basis of the length of service put\nin by them in their respective parent services prior to\ntheir permanent secondment in the R&D. As pointed out by\nthis Court in the decision in \nR. S. Makashi v I. M. Menon\n\n(supra), it is a just and wholesome principle commonly\napplied in such situations where persons from different\nsources are drafted to serve in a new service that their\npre-existing length of service in the parent department\nshould be respected and preserved by taking the same into\naccount in determining their ranking in the new service\ncadre. Such a provision does not involve any discrimination\nviolative of \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution.\n\n \nYet, another argument advanced by the appellant is that\nthe impugned rule not having been specifically declared to\nbe retrospective in operation; its provisions cannot be\napplied to the appellant inasmuch as he had been inducted\ninto the R&D cadre on October 14, 1971 long prior to the\npromulgation of the new rules. We have already found that,\nas a matter of fact, the practice generally followed in the\nR&D Organisation, even prior to the promulgation of the\nimpugned rules, was to reckon seniority with reference to\nthe date of attainment of the rank of substantive\nMajor/equivalent. Even otherwise, when a statutory rule\ngoverning seniority is issued in respect of a service, the\nsaid rule would govern the personnel in the service with\neffect from the date of its promulgation and in so giving\neffect to the rule in future, there is no element of\nretroactivity involved. Of course, the rules will not\noperate to deprive any person of promotions already earned\nin the past, but, for purposes\n\n471\n\nof future promotions and seniority in the department, the\nprinciples \nlaid down in\n the impugned rule will necessarily\ngovern all the personnel alike. This contention of the\nappellant has also to fail.\n\n It was very strongly contended by the appellant that\nthe lateral induction of senior service officers holding\nranks above the substantive Major/equivalent level operates\nto deprive the existing R&D personnel of their vested rights\nto promotions within the cadre and hence, such inductions\nmust be held to be illegal and void. This contention ignores\nthe fact that rule 5 specifically provides that in\nexceptional cases, officers above the rank of\nMajor/equivalent may be drafted into the R&D. The contention\nof the appellant appears to us to be based on a fallacious\nassumption that the R&D cadre exists for the sake of the\npersonnel working therein and not for effectuating the\npurpose underlying its constitution which is of such vital\nimportance to the Nation's safety. The Organisation has been\nformed with a view to have a highly specialised cadre of\ntechnological and scientific experts to design and develop\nmilitary hardware etc., for the Armed Forces of the country\nkeeping abreast of the latest developments and advances in\nthe field of defence science. To effectuate this purpose,\nsuch an Organisation by its very nature cannot remain static\nor stagnant, but has to be constantly expanding\nqualitatively and quantitatively. The personnel requirements\nof the Organisation are, therefore, bound to change from\ntime to time and to meet such changing needs, the services\nof qualified experts with specialised knowledge, skill and\nexperience will have to be enlisted from time to time. A\nparticular service officer in the Army, Air Force or Navy\nmay be the best person suited for being placed in charge of\na specialised job newly taken on hand, and in such a\nsituation the Organisation must have the freedom to indent\nfor the services of the officer concerned irrespective of\nthe rank that he may be holding in his parent service. We do\nnot find it possible to recognise any right in the officers\nalready working in the R&D to object to the lateral\ninduction of senior officers under such circumstances. The\ncontention put forward by the appellant that lateral\ninductions into the R&D cadre constitute an illegal\ndeprivation of the vested rights of persons already working\ntherein and are consequently illegal and void, cannot,\ntherefore, be accepted.\n\n The next point urged by the appellant is that since the\nimpugned rules disturb the previously fixed seniority, it is\nquasi-judicial in nature and they ought to have been issued\nonly after\n\n472\n\ngiving notice to all the affected persons. We have already\nfound that no alteration in the pre-existing policy relating\nto determination of seniority in the R&D has been brought\nabout by the impugned rules. Quite apart from that, the\npromulgation of a statutory rule governing seniority is not\na quasi-judicial function. It is the exercise of a\nlegislative power and in respect thereof the principles of\nnatural justice have no application at all.\n\n Detailed facts pertaining to the history of service of\nthe various officers impleaded in the appeal as respondents\nwere referred to by the appellant during the course of his\narguments, and such of the respondents who appeared in\nperson countered those submissions by placing before us,\nwhat, according to them, are the correct facts relating to\ntheir service history. The challenge made by the appellant\nagainst the ranking and seniority of the officers impleaded\nas respondents is based solely on his contention that the\nseniority principle enunciated in rule 16 is arbitrary,\nillegal and ultra vires and that, in any event, the said\nprinciple cannot be applied to him. The said contention has\nbeen found by us to be untenable. Hence, it is not necessary\nfor us to refer to the details regarding the service history\nof the appellant vis-a-vis those of the service officers who\nhave been impleaded as respondents in the appeal.\n\n In the light of our foregoing discussion, it follows\nthat the High Court was perfectly right in upholding the\nvalidity of the impugned rule and in rejecting the challenge\nraised by the petitioner-appellant against the selections,\ninductions and promotions made in the R&D Organisation on\nthe basis of the said rule.\n\n In the course of his submissions before this Court, the\nappellant put forward a grievance that, notwithstanding the\ndirections issued by the High Court in its judgment under\nappeal, he has not been given any posting or assignment.\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India and the\nScientific Adviser to the Defence Minister made available\nfor our perusal the files relating to the appellant's\nposting to the DR&D Laboratory at Hyderabad and the\nallotment of specific assignments therein to the appellant\nfrom time to time. Having gone through the files, we have\ncome to the conclusion that there is no factual foundation\nfor the grievance put forward by the appellant, and hence no\ndirections from this Court are called for in regard to the\nsaid matter. We are purposefully refraining from dwelling in\ngreater detail on this aspect lest any observations that we\nmay make should prejudicially affect the future\n\n473\n\nservice prospects of the appellant. We, however, consider it\nnecessary to observe that the appellant would do well to rid\nhimself of the obsession that all his official superiors are\nput to harass or persecute him and open up a new chapter of\ndevoting his high talents and skills for advancing the\neffectiveness of the R&D Organisation.\n\n The charges put forward by the appellant in the\nContempt Application (C.M.P. No. 5698 of 1981) and in C.M.P.\nNo. 69 of 1981 filed by the appellant under \nSection 340(1)\n,\nCode of Criminal Procedure are bereft of merit and those\napplications will accordingly stand dismissed.\n\n In the result, we dismiss this appeal but direct the\nparties to bear their respective costs.\n\nN.V.K. Appeal dismissed.\n\n474",

Its\npersonnel consist of large number of civilian scientists as\nwell as a smaller number of service officers drawn from the\nthree wings of the Armed Forces who have operational\nexperience of weapon systems.\n The policy followed in regard to the intake of service\nofficers was that they were initially taken on a tenure\nbasis and subsequently absorbed in the organisation on a\npermanent basis in the event of being found suitable and\nwilling. Since the Officers from the three services came to\nthe R & D cadre with different lengths of service and at\ndifferent levels, it became imperative to evolve a\nreasonable principle for the determination of their inter-se\nseniority after their secondment to the organisation.\n In November 1979 in supersession of all previous Rules\nand Orders on the subject, rules were made under the proviso\nto \nArt. 309\n laying down the procedure for the intake of\nservice officers in the R & D organisation and the terms and\nconditions of service of those permanently retained therein.\nRule 16 dealt with \"Seniority after permanent secondment\"\nand provided that \"seniority of all service Officers\npermanently seconded to DRDO will continue to be based upon\ntheir seniority of substantive rank of Major/Sqn.

      "text": "of the Constitution, and as he had been permanently seconded\nto the R & D Organisation in 1971 long prior to the\nproclamation of the rule his rights regarding seniority and\npromotion could not be affected by the provisions of this\nrule. By taking the date of substantive appointment to the\nrank of Major/ equivalent as the basis for reckoning\nseniority, officers who had obtained substantive promotions\nto higher ranks in the parent service earlier than some of\ntheir seniors who were only subsequently promoted to such\nhigher ranks, suffer serious prejudice because the latter\ngain over the earlier promotees and supersede them in the\nmatter of seniority in the R & D Organisation, and that\nsubsequent inductees in the R & D Organisation cannot be\nlegally assigned seniority above those already borne on the\ncadre, irrespective of the substantive rank held by them at\nthe time of their intake into the R & D.\n The Single Judge rejected all the contentions and\ndeclined to grant relief. The R & D Organisation was however\ndirected to issue the tentative seniority list drawn up in\naccordance with Rule 16. The Letters Patent Appeal filed by\nthe appellant was dismissed in limine.\n Dismissing the appeal to this Court,\n^\n HELD: 1. Since officers from different sources are\ntaken into the R & D Organisation for meeting the\ndiscipline-wise requirements arising therein from time to\ntime and they are brought into a common pool on such\npermanent secondment, a reasonable principle had to be\nevolved for fixation of inter se seniority within the R & D\ncadre. The principle adopted under Rule 4 of reckoning\nseniority with reference to the date of attainment of the\nrank of substantive Major/equivalent strikes a reasonable\nmean as it ensures to all the service officers in the R & D\nthe fixation of seniority in the integrated cadre giving\nfull credit to the length of service put in by them in their\nrespective parent services. [466 C; 466 H; 467 A]\n 2. It is settled law that the service conditions\npertaining to seniority are liable to alteration by\nsubsequent changes that may be introduced in the rules and\nexcept to the extent of protecting promotions that have\nalready been earned under the previous rules, the revised\nrules will operate to govern seniority and future promotion\nprospects. There is, therefore, no substance in the argument\nadvanced by the appellant that it was not open to the\nGovernment of India to introduce a new principle of\nseniority by promulgation of Rule 16 so as to affect his\nrights for future promotion. [463 D-E]\n 3. A statement contained in the statute or statutory\nrule of the factual background leading up to the enactment\nhas ordinarily to be accepted and acted upon by the court as\nwholly correct. [463 A]\n455\n 4. Rule 16 contains a categorical declaration that in\nthe past also the seniority of service officers permanently\nseconded to the R & D Organisation was being reckoned on the\nbasis of their dates of attainment of substantive rank of\nMajor/Sqn. Ldr./Lt. Cdr. subject to any penalty/loss of\nseniority that an officer might suffer subsequently. It is\ntherefore not possible to accept the contention of the\nappellant that prior to the coming into force of the rule be\nhad acquired a vested right to have his seniority in the R &\nD reckoned with reference to the date of his permanent\nsecondment and to have all Officers joining the organisation\non subsequent dates ranked only below him. [462 G-H; 463 B-\nC]\n 5. The structure and composition of the Organisation\nhave necessarily to undergo rapid, qualitative and\nquantitative changes in the light of the fast developments\nthat take place in science technology and international\nrelations. The intake of service Officers is not on the\nbasis of any general selection from service cadres. As and\nwhen the Organisation finds it necessary to obtain the\nservice of officers with operational experience in any\nparticular weapon system or other scientific discipline the\nparent service is requested to spare for deputation suitable\nhands in the particular branch or speciality and initially\nthey are taken on a tenure basis. There is a selection only\nin a very limited sense that the suitability of the\nconcerned officer is adjudged before he is taken but the\nclaims or merits of others are not considered. The\nsecondment of such officers to the R & D Organisation is not\ntherefore, effected on the basis of a general selection.\nOfficers who are senior in the parent service in relation to\nthe person who is seconded and who may possess greater\nexperience and superior attainment might not have been\nconsidered for secondment when their juniors in the service\nwere seconded to the R & D Organisation, because the parent\nservice might not have been in the position at the relevant\npoint of time to spare the services of the former.

Where persons from different sources are drafted to\nserve in a new service a just and wholesome principle\ncommonly applied is that the pre existing length of service\nin the parent department should be respected and preserved\nby taking the same into account in determining their ranking\nin the new service cadre.

When a statutory rule governing seniority is issued\nin respect of a service, the said rule would govern the\npersonnel in the service with effect from the date of its\npromulgation and in so giving effect to the rule in future,\nno element of retroactivity is involved. [470 G-H]\n456\n 10. The promulgation of a statutory rule governing\nseniority is not a quasi-judicial function.

It\nwas urged by the appellant that such subsequent inductees\ninto the R&D Organisation cannot be legally assigned\nseniority above those already borne on the cadre,\nirrespective of the substantive rank held by them at the\ntime of their intake into the R&D. The appellant has rested\nthis contention on the premise that the intake of officers\ninto the R&D is by a selection based on merit and hence\nthose selected earlier must necessarily rank higher in the\nseniority list of the Organisation in relation to those who\nare selected and appointed in the Organisation only on later\ndates. The appellant has urged a further point before us\nthat the seniority of officers of the Navy, Army and Air\nForce holding equivalent ranks who served in the\nOrganisation is governed by the principle laid down in\nRegulation No. 251 of the \"Naval Ceramonials, Conditions of\nService and Miscellaneous Regulations, 1964\", and the\nimpugned rule in so far as it is contrary to the principle\nlaid down in the said Regulation has to be declared as\ninvalid and inoperative.

The intake of service officers is not on the basis of\nany general selection from service cadres. As and when the\nOrganisation finds it necessary to obtain the services of\nofficers with operational experience in any particular\nweapon system or other scientific discipline, suitable hands\nwith aptitude skill and experience in that particular branch\nor speciality whom their parent service is willing to spare\nfor deputation are initially taken on a tenure basis. Thus,\nthere is a selection only in a very limited sense that the\nsuitability of the concerned officer is adjudged before he\nis taken. But what is important to note is that in the\nintake of officers into R&D Organisation there is no\ncomparative evaluation of the merits of the other personnel\noccupying the same rank or possessing like experience in the\nDefence Services. There is no process of selection in which\ntheir claims or merits are considered.

Officers who are senior in the parent service\nin relation to the person who is seconded and who may\npossess greater experience and superior attainments might\nnot have been considered for secondment when their juniors\nin the service were seconded to the R & D Organisation,\nbecause the parent service might not have been in the\nposition at the relevant point of time to spare the services\nof the former.

The fixation of the seniority on the basis of the\nranks held by them in the different branches of the Armed\nForces would not be reasonable or fair, because substantive\nranks above Major/equivalent in the three Wings of the Armed\nForces are conferred by different Selection Boards at\ndifferent times and under varying circumstances and\nconditions depending upon the vacancies arising at the\ndifferent levels in the distinct services from time to time.\nIt is pointed out in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf\non the Union of India (Respondent No. 1) that the\npromotional chances of officers belonging to the three\ndistinct Wings of the Armed Forces to posts above the rank\nof Major/equivalent vary widely and dependant upon\nfortuitous circumstances which may obtain in relation to the\ndistinct services at any relevant point of time. We find\nthere is force in this submission. In all the three\nServices, the promotions up to and inclusive of the rank of\nMajor/equivalent are time-scale promotions based only on\nfixed length of service. In the Air Force and the Army, the\nranks of Major and Sqn. Leader, respectively, are attained\non an officer putting in 13 years' service. In the Navy, the\ntime-scale period for promotion to the equivalent rank of\nLt. Commander is said to vary between about 10 and 13 years.\nBut, what is important to notice is that the promotion to\nthe rank of Major/equivalent is based only on length of\nservice and not on any \"selection\". For posts higher than\nthat of Major/equivalent, promotions in all the three\nServices would depend upon the occurrence of vacancies in\nthe particular branch or group in the concerned Service, the\nschemes of expansion that may be taken up from time to time\nin the particular Service or branch and also the extent of\nstagnation that may be caused to officers at lower levels by\nreason of the officers who are young in age occupying posts\nin the immediate higher levels, etc. When due regard is had\nto all the aspects and circumstances, narrated above, it\nwill be seen that the"

This contention ignores\nthe fact that rule 5 specifically provides that in\nexceptional cases, officers above the rank of\nMajor/equivalent may be drafted into the R&D. The contention\nof the appellant appears to us to be based on a fallacious\nassumption that the R&D cadre exists for the sake of the\npersonnel working therein and not for effectuating the\npurpose underlying its constitution which is of such vital\nimportance to the Nation's safety. The Organisation has been\nformed with a view to have a highly specialised cadre of\ntechnological and scientific experts to design and develop\nmilitary hardware etc., for the Armed Forces of the country\nkeeping abreast of the latest developments and advances in\nthe field of defence science. To effectuate this purpose,\nsuch an Organisation by its very nature cannot remain static\nor stagnant, but has to be constantly expanding\nqualitatively and quantitatively. The personnel requirements\nof the Organisation are, therefore, bound to change from\ntime to time and to meet such changing needs, the services\nof qualified experts with specialised knowledge, skill and\nexperience will have to be enlisted from time to time. A\nparticular service officer in the Army, Air Force or Navy\nmay be the best person suited for being placed in charge of\na specialised job newly taken on hand, and in such a\nsituation the Organisation must have the freedom to indent\nfor the services of the officer concerned irrespective of\nthe rank that he may be holding in his parent service.
