Status Report is handed over in Court and taken on record. As per the\ncase of the prosecution, on 09.05.2024 at 6:50 PM an information was\nreceived vide DD No. 119 from Tirath Ram Hospital that a patient namely\nPallavi, aged 28 years was admitted in the Hospital by her husband Ansul\nvide MLC No. 1517/2024 and was declared brought dead by the doctor.

Family members of deceased, who were present at the hospital\nlevelled allegations that her husband and in-laws had tortured her for dowry.\nConcerned SDM was informed telephonically and dead body was preserved\nat Subzi Mandi Mortuary.\n\n3. It is stated that crime team visited the place of incident where\ninspection was conducted and photographs were taken. Exhibits were seized\nand deposited at the Malkhana through seizure memos. On 10.05.2024,\nPost-mortem was conducted at the Mortuary in the presence of Executive\nMagistrate, Civil Lines vide PM No. 580/24, who also recorded the\nstatement of the mother of the deceased and the body was handed over to the\nfamily members.\n\n4. On 10.05.2024, present FIR was registered on the statement of Smt.\nSundari Devi, mother of the deceased. In her statement, complainant stated\nthat she has five children (3 daughters and 2 sons). Her daughter Pallavi was\nmarried to Anshul and in the marriage, complainant and her family had\nspent according to their capacity and had given all household goods and\njewellery but Pallavi's husband and in-laws were not satisfied and tortured\nand harassed her for bringing less dowry and kept demanding more and\nmore, especially a car, on the ground that Anshul was the only son of his\nparents and held the status of a Government servant. Pallavi also complained\nthat Anshul would come home drunk and physically beat her. She also\nnarrated that on 29.04.2024 her husband had spoken to Pallavi's father-in-\nlaw requesting him to send her to the parental house as her mother was ill.\nPallavi came but was soon asked to return back to her matrimonial home,\ndespite her mother being ill and forced by the in-laws, Pallavi went back on\n\nBAIL APPLN. 1762/2024 Page 2 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 14/06/2024 at 22:49:28\n07.05.2024. Complainant stated that on 08.05.2024 Pallavi telephoned her\nand informed that her husband and in-laws were harassing her badly.\nComplainant and her husband decided to visit her matrimonial home on\n10.05.2024 to resolve the issues but before that on 09.05.2024 they received\na phone call from Pallavi's father-in-law that she had committed suicide by\nhanging. Complainant categorically stated that Pallavi's husband and in-\nlaws had a role to play in her alleged suicide as they had been regularly\nharassing and torturing her for dowry.\n\n5. It is stated that thereafter, present FIR was registered and\ninvestigation was initiated, wherein statements of witnesses were recorded\nand evidences collected. On 11.05.2024, co-accused Anshul and his father\nKarm Singh were arrested and are in Judicial Custody. Investigation has\nbrought forth sufficient incriminating material against the applicant, who is\nthe Nanad of the deceased and was residing in the same house. Post-mortem\nreport of deceased Pallavi has been received which reflects presence of a\nbrownish coloured dark abraded hard Panchmentised incomplete ligature\nmark around the neck of length 30 cm and width varying 1 cm-3 cm, 7.5 cm\nfrom chin and 6 cm at sterna notch. The distance of the mark from the right\nand left angle of mandible is 2 cm-2.5 cm respectively. Two crecentric\nabrasions were found, one over the lower lip. Session Court has dismissed\nthe bail application of the applicant looking at the seriousness of the\nallegations and the role attributed to the applicant.\n\n6. Counsel for the applicant states that the applicant is innocent and has\nno role to play in the alleged suicide of the deceased Pallavi. It is stated that\nthe applicant is a young girl, aged 27 years and is unmarried and her\nincarceration will ruin her entire life. There are no allegations of dowry\n\nBAIL APPLN. 1762/2024 Page 3 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 14/06/2024 at 22:49:29\nagainst the applicant which is evident from a bare reading of the FIR. It is\nurged that applicant has never made any attempt to evade the process of law\nand it is a natural reaction to shift out of the known place of residence, if an\nFIR is registered. Applicant is willing to join investigation and cooperate\ntherein. Reliance is placed on the judgments of Co-ordinate Benches of this\nCourt in Smt. Vinni v. The State, Bail Appln.\n208/2022, decided on\n08.03.2022; and\nShiksha @ Shashi Kiran v. State of NCT of Delhi, Bail\nAppln\n. 1029/2023, decided on 28.07.2023.\n\n7. On the other hand, Ms. Shubhi Gupta, learned APP submits that the\nallegations against the applicant are grave and serious. Marriage between\nAnshul and deceased was solemnised on 16.02.2023 and the deceased\ncommitted suicide on 09.05.2024, i.e. within 14 months from the date of\nmarriage. It will be incorrect for the applicant to argue that there are no\nallegations against the applicant. Statement of the complainant is replete\nwith instances where she stated that the deceased had confided in her that\nher in-laws including the applicant were torturing and harassing her for less\ndowry and repeatedly demanding more dowry, especially a car as per their\nstatus as Anshul was the only son and had a Government job. It is urged that\napplicant is not joining investigation and is evading the process of law.\nLearned APP is emphatic that there are specific and serious allegations\nagainst the applicant that she pressed the neck of the deceased and this could\nonly be with a motive to kill the deceased. Investigating Officer has made\nseveral efforts to contact the applicant to join investigation but as per the\nstatements of the neighbours, applicant and her mother both have not been\nseen since the registration of the FIR. Judgments relied upon by learned\ncounsel for the applicant are distinguished on facts arguing that there can be\n\nBAIL APPLN. 1762/2024 Page 4 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 14/06/2024 at 22:49:31\nno precedent in bail matters as each case has to be decided on its own facts,\ncircumstances, seriousness of allegations, role ascribed to the accused etc.\n\n8. I have heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned APP for the\nState and examined their rival submissions.\n\n9. Before proceeding to deal with the present case, it would be useful to\nrefer to an order in the case of\nLavesh v. State NCT of Delhi, Bail Appln\n.\nNo.1602/2011, decided on 05.12.2011, where the FIR was registered under\n\nSection 498A\n/\n304B\nIPC and Petitioners were real sister and brother of the\nhusband of the deceased, respectively.\n\nApplication for grant of pre-arrest\nbail was dismissed by the Court relying on the judgement of the Supreme\nCourt in\nSamunder Singh v. State of Rajasthan and Others\n, (1987) 1 SCC\n\n466. Challenge to the order declining bail was unsuccessful in the Supreme\nCourt looking at the nature and gravity of the accusations, possibility of the\napplicant fleeing from justice, etc.\nIn\nSamunder Singh\n(supra), the Supreme\nCourt made a very significant observation that dowry deaths are even now\ntreated with some casualness and that High Court should not have exercised\nthe discretion to grant anticipatory bail, disregarding the magnitude and\nseriousness of the matter. The matter regarding the unnatural death of the\ndaughter-in-law at the house of her in-laws was still under investigation.\nRelevant paragraph of the judgement is as under:-\n\n\"The widespread belief that dowry deaths are even now treated with some\ncasualness at all levels seems to be well grounded. The High Court has\ngranted anticipatory bail in such a matter. We are of the opinion that the\nHigh Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction to release the\naccused on anticipatory bail in disregard of the magnitude and\nseriousness of the matter. The matter regarding the unnatural death of the\ndaughter-in-law at the house of her father-in-law was still under\ninvestigation and the appropriate course to adopt was to allow the\nconcerned magistrate to deal with the same on the basis of the material\nbefore the court at the point of time of their arrest in case they were\n\nBAIL APPLN. 1762/2024 Page 5 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 14/06/2024 at 22:49:31\narrested. It was neither prudent nor proper for the High Court to have\ngranted anticipatory bail which order was very likely to occasion\nprejudice by its very nature and timing. We therefore consider it essential\nto sound a serious note of caution for future. The High Court is under no\ncompulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipatory bail in a\nmatter of this nature. So far as the present matter is concerned, since it has\nbecome infructuous, we do not propose to pass any order. Subject to these\nobservations, the appeal is dismissed.\"\n\n10.\nIn the case of\nMs. Preeti v. The State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n), 2016\nSCC OnLine Del 2325, this Court declined to grant Anticipatory Bail to the\nmother-in-law and sister-in-law of the deceased who died an unnatural death\nand FIR was registered under\nSections 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nIPC. Court observed\nthat the deceased had committed suicide within four and a half years from\nthe date of marriage. Petitioners were not co-operating with the investigation\nand the case was still at the initial stages.\n\n11. In the present case, marriage between deceased Pallavi and Anshul\nwas solemnized on 16.02.2023 and the unnatural death has taken place in\nless than 14 months from the date of marriage, which raises a statutory\npresumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and\n\nSection 304-B\nIPC, as rightly contended by the learned APP. Mother of the\ndeceased has made serious and pointed allegations against the Applicant\nalso, who is the sister-in-law of the deceased and lived in the same house.\nAllegations of dowry demand, harassment, mental and physical torture have\nbeen clearly levelled including a repeated demand for a car. Significantly,\nthere is a serious allegation against the applicant that she pressed the neck of\ndeceased on an earlier occasion. Post-mortem report indicates that there are\ntwo crecentric abrasions, one present over lower lip, which may be pointers\nto some physical assault prior to the alleged hanging by the fan. I find prima\nfacie merit in the submission of learned APP that there is sufficient\n\nBAIL APPLN. 1762/2024 Page 6 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 14/06/2024 at 22:49:32\nincriminating evidence against the applicant, who was residing in the same\nhouse as the deceased. Status Report reveals that despite efforts by the\nPolice, applicant has successfully evaded arrest till date and has not joined\ninvestigation. The seriousness of the allegations; role ascribed to the\napplicant; factum of death of the deceased in about 14 months of marriage;\nstatements of the mother of the deceased regarding repeated demands of\ndowry and torture of the deceased; and the matter being at a nascent stage\nare some of the factors which dissuade this Court to exercise discretion in\nfavour of the applicant and grant pre-arrest bail.\n\n12. Insofar as the judgments relied upon by counsel for the applicant are\nconcerned, none of them are even close to the facts of the present case.\nMoreover, each bail application has to be decided on the given facts and\ncircumstances and as mentioned above, facts of this case do not aid the\napplicant.\n\n13. Bail Application is, accordingly, dismissed.\n\n14. Needless to state no observation in this order will be construed as an\nexpression on the merits of the case.\n\nJYOTI SINGH, J\nMAY 28, 2024\nB.S.
