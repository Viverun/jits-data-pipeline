What is the nature of the function of the Chief Justice or his designate\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is the\nquestion that is posed before us. The three judges bench decision in Konkan\nRly.\nCorporation Ltd. v. Mehul Construction Co.\nas approved by the\nConstitution Bench in\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani\nConstruction Pvt. Ltd.\nhas taken the view that it is purely an\nadministrative function, that it is neither judicial nor quasi-judicial and\nthe Chief Justice or his nominee performing the function under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, cannot decide any contentious issue between the parties.\n\nThe correctness of the said view is questioned in these appeals.\nPage 1799\n\n2. Arbitration in India was earlier governed by the Indian Arbitration Act,\n1859 with limited application and the Second Schedule to\nthe Code of Civil\nProcedure\n, 1908. Then came the\nArbitration Act, 1940\n.\nSection 8\nof that Act\nconferred power on the Court to appoint an arbitrator on an application\nmade in that behalf.\nSection 20\nconferred a wider jurisdiction on the Court\nfor directing the filing of the arbitration agreement and the appointment\nof an arbitrator.\nSection 21\nconferred a power on the Court in a pending\nsuit, on the agreement of parties, to refer the differences between them\nfor arbitration in terms of the Act.\nThe Act\nprovided for the filing of the\naward in court, for the making of a motion by either of the parties to make\nthe award a rule of court, a right to have the award set aside on the\ngrounds specified in the Act and for an appeal against the decision on such\na motion.\nThis Act\nwas replaced by the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act,\nwhich, by virtue of\nSection 85\n, repealed the earlier enactment.\n\n3.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter referred to as\n'the Act') was intended to comprehensively cover international and\ncommercial arbitrations and conciliations as also domestic arbitrations and\nconciliations. It envisages the making of an arbitral procedure which is\nfair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the concerned\narbitration and for other matters set out in the objects and reasons for\nthe Bill.\nThe Act\nwas intended to be one to consolidate and amend the law\nrelating to domestic arbitrations, international commercial arbitrations\nand enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, as also to define the law\nrelating to conciliation and for matters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto. The preamble indicates that since the United Nations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has adopted a Model Law for\nInternational Commercial Arbitration and the General Assembly of the United\nNations has recommended that all countries give due consideration to the\nModel Law and whereas the Model Law and the Rules make significant\ncontribution to the establishment of a unified legal framework for a fair\nand efficient settlement of disputes arising in international commercial\nrelations and since it was expedient to make a law respecting arbitration\nand conciliation taking into account the Model Law and the Rules, the\nenactment was being brought forward.\nThe Act\nreplaces the procedure\nlaid\ndown in\n\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940.\nPart I of the Act\n\ndeals with arbitration. It contains\nSections 2\nto\n. Part II deals with\nenforcement of certain foreign awards, and Part III deals with conciliation\nand Part IV contains supplementary provisions. In this case, we are not\nconcerned with Part III, and Parts II and IV have only incidental\nrelevance. We are concerned with the provisions in Part I dealing with\narbitration.\n\n4.\nSection 7\nof the Act read with\nSection 2 (b)\ndefines an arbitration\nagreement.\nSection 2(h)\ndefines 'party' to mean a party to an arbitration\nagreement.\nSection 4\ndeals with waiver of objections on the part of the\nparty who has proceeded with an arbitration, without stating his objections\nreferred to in the section, without undue delay.\nSection 5\nindicates the\nextent of judicial intervention. It says that notwithstanding anything\ncontained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed\nby Part I, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided\nin Part I. The expression 'judicial authority' is not defined. So, it has\nto be Page 1800 understood as taking in the courts or any other judicial\nfora.\nSection 7\ndefines an arbitration agreement and insists that it must\nbe in writing and also explains when an arbitration agreement could be said\nto be in writing.\nSection 8\nconfers power on a judicial authority before\nwhom an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an\narbitration agreement, to refer the dispute to arbitration, if a party\napplies for the same.\nSection 9\ndeals with the power of the Court to pass\ninterim orders and the power to give interim protection in appropriate\ncases. It gives a right to a party, before or during arbitral proceedings\nor at any time after the making of the arbitral arbitral award but before\nits enforcement in terms of\nSection 36\nof the Act, to apply to a court for\nany one of the orders specified therein. Chapter III of Part I deals with\ncomposition of arbitral tribunals.\nSection 10\ngives freedom to the parties\nto determine the number of arbitrators but imposes a restriction that it\nshall not be an even number. Then comes\nSection 11\nwith which we are really\nconcerned in these appeals.\n\n5. The marginal heading of\nSection 11\nis 'Appointment of arbitrators'. Sub-\nSection (1) indicates that a person of any nationality may be an\narbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Under sub-Section\n(2), subject to sub-Section (6),the parties are free to agree on a\nprocedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. Under sub- Section\n(3), failing any agreement in terms of sub-Section (2), in an arbitration\nwith three arbitrators, each party could appoint one arbitrator, and the\ntwo arbitrators so appointed, could appoint the third arbitrator, who would\nact as the presiding arbitrator. Under sub- Section (4), the Chief Justice\nor any person or institution designated by him could make the appointment,\nin a case where sub-Section (3) has application and where either the party\nor parties had failed to nominate their arbitrator or arbitrators or the\ntwo nominated arbitrators had failed to agree on the presiding arbitrator.\nIn the case of a sole arbitrator, sub- Section (5) provides for the Chief\nJustice or any person or institution designated by him, appointing an\narbitrator on a request being made by one of the parties, on fulfilment of\nthe conditions laid down therein. Then comes sub-Section (6), which may be\nquoted hereunder with advantage:\n\n\"(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,-\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n(b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an\nagreement expected of them under that procedure; or\n\n(c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function\nentrusted to him or it under that procedure,\na party may request the Chief Justice or any person or institution\ndesignated by him to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on\nthe appointment procedure provides other means for securing the\nappointment.\"\n\nSub-Section (7) gives a finality to the decision rendered by the Chief\nJustice or the person or institution designated by him when moved under\nsub-Section (4), or sub-Section (5), or sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\n. Sub-\nSection (8) enjoins the Chief Justice or the person or institution\ndesignated by Page 1801 him to keep in mind the qualifications required for\nan arbitrator by the agreement of the parties, and other considerations as\nare likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial\narbitrator. Sub-Section (9) deals with the power of the Chief Justice of\nIndia or a person or institution designated by him to appoint the sole or\nthe third arbitrator in an international commercial arbitration. Sub-\nSection (10) deals with Chief Justice's power to make a scheme for dealing\nwith matters entrusted to him by sub-Section (4) or sub-Section (5) or sub-\nSection (6) of\nSection 11\n. Sub-Section (11) deals with the respective\njurisdiction of Chief Justices of different High Courts who are approached\nwith requests regarding the same dispute and specifies as to who should\nentertain such a request. Sub-\nSection 12\nclause (a) clarifies that in\nrelation to international arbitration, the reference in the relevant sub-\nsections to the 'Chief Justice' would mean the 'Chief Justice of India'.\nClause (b) indicates that otherwise the expression 'Chief Justice' shall be\nconstrued as a reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court within\nwhose local limits the principal Court is situated. 'Court' is defined\nunder\nSection 2(e)\nas the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in\na district.\n\n6.\nSection 12\nsets out the grounds of challenge to the person appointed as\narbitrator and the duty of an arbitrator appointed, to disclose any\ndisqualification he may have. Sub-Section (3) of\nSection 12\ngives a right\nto the parties to challenge an arbitrator.\nSection 13\nlays down the\nprocedure for such a challenge.\nSection 14\ntakes care of the failure of or\nimpossibility for an arbitrator to act and\nSection 15\ndeals with the\ntermination of the mandate of the arbitrator and the substitution of\nanother arbitrator. Chapter IV deals with the jurisdiction of arbitral\ntribunals.\nSection 16\ndeals with the competence of an arbitral tribunal, to\nrule on its jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own\njurisdiction, including ruling on any objection with respect to the\nexistence or validity of the arbitration agreement. A person aggrieved by\nthe rejection of his objection by the tribunal on its jurisdiction or the\nother matters referred to in that Section, has to wait until the award is\nmade to challenge that decision in an appeal against the arbitral award\nitself in accordance with\nSection 34\nof the Act. But an acceptance of the\nobjection to jurisdiction or authority, could be challenged then and there,\nunder\nSection 37\nof the Act.\nSection 17\nconfers powers on the arbitral\ntribunal to make interim orders. Chapter V comprising of\nSections 18\nto\ndeals with the conduct of arbitral proceedings. Chapter VI containing\n\nSections 28\nto\ndeals with making of the arbitral award and termination\nof the proceedings. Chapter VII deals with recourse against an arbitral\naward.\nSection 34\ncontemplates the filing of an application for setting\naside an arbitral award by making an application to the Court as defined in\n\nSection 2(e)\nof the Act. Chapter VIII deals with finality and enforcement\nof arbitral awards.\nSection 35\nmakes the award final and\nSection 36\n\nprovides for its enforcement under\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 in the\nsame manner as if it were a decree of court. Chapter IX deals with appeals\nand\nSection 37\nenumerates the orders that are open to appeal. We have\nalready referred to the right of appeal available under\nSection 37(2)\nof\nthe Act, on the Tribunal accepting a plea that it does not have\njurisdiction or when the arbitral tribunal accepts a plea that it is\nexceeding the scope of its authority. Page 1802 No second appeal is\ncontemplated, but right to approach the Supreme Court is saved. Chapter X\ndeals with miscellaneous matters.\nSection 43\nmakes the\nLimitation Act, 1963\n\napplicable to proceedings under the Act as it applies to proceedings in\nCourt.\n\n7. We will first consider the question, as we see it. On a plain\nunderstanding of the relevant provisions of the Act, it is seen that in a\ncase where there is an arbitration agreement, a dispute has arisen and one\nof the parties had invoked the agreed procedure for appointment of an\narbitrator and the other party has not cooperated, the party seeking an\narbitration, could approach the Chief Justice of the High Court if it is an\ninternal arbitration or of the Supreme Court if it is an international\narbitration to have an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal appointed. The Chief\nJustice, when so requested, could appoint an arbitrator or arbitral\ntribunal depending on the nature of the agreement between the parties and\nafter satisfying himself that the conditions for appointment of an\narbitrator under sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\ndo exist. The Chief Justice\ncould designate another person or institution to take the necessary\nmeasures. The Chief Justice has also to have the qualification of the\narbitrators in mind before choosing the arbitrator. An arbitral tribunal so\nconstituted, in terms of\nSection 16\nof the Act, has the right to decide\nwhether it has jurisdiction to proceed with the arbitration, whether there\nwas any agreement between the parties and the other matters referred to\ntherein.\n\n8. Normally, any tribunal or authority conferred with a power to act under\na statute, has the jurisdiction to satisfy itself that the conditions for\nthe exercise of that power existed and that the case calls for the exercise\nof that power. Such an adjudication relating to its own jurisdiction which\ncould be called a decision on jurisdictional facts, is not generally final,\nunless it is made so by the Act constituting the tribunal. Here, sub-\nSection (7) of\nSection 11\nhas given a finality to the decisions taken by\nthe Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him in respect\nof matters falling under sub-Sections (4), (5) and (6) of\nSection 11\n. Once\na statute creates an authority, confers on it power to adjudicate and makes\nits decision final on matters to be decided by it, normally, that decision\ncannot be said to be a purely administrative decision. It is really a\ndecision on its own jurisdiction for the exercise of the power conferred by\nthe statute or to perform the duties imposed by the statute. Unless, the\nauthority satisfies itself that the conditions for exercise of its power\nexist, it could not accede to a request made to it for the exercise of the\nconferred power. While exercising the power or performing the duty under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, the Chief Justice has to consider whether the\nconditions\nlaid down by\nthe section for the exercise of that power or the\nperformance of that duty, exist. Therefore, unaided by authorities and\ngoing by general principals, it appears to us that while functioning under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, a Chief Justice or the person or institution\ndesignated by him, is bound to decide whether he has jurisdiction, whether\nthere is an arbitration agreement, whether the applicant before him, is a\nparty, whether the conditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled\nand if an arbitrator is to be appointed, who is the fit person, in terms of\nthe provision.\nSection 11(7)\nmakes his decision on the matters entrusted to\nhim, final.\n\n9. The very scheme, if it involves an adjudicatory process, restricts the\npower of the Chief Justice to designate, by excluding the designation of a\nnon-judicial institution or a non-judicial authority to perform the\nfunctions. For, under our dispensation, no judicial or quasi-judicial\ndecision can be rendered by an institution if it is not a judicial\nauthority, court or a quasi-judicial tribunal. This aspect is dealt with\nlater while dealing with the right to designate under\nSection 11(6)\nand the\nscope of that designation.\n\n10. The appointment of an arbitrator against the opposition of one of the\nparties on the ground that the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction or on the\nground that there was no arbitration agreement, or on the ground that there\nwas no dispute subsisting which was capable of being arbitrated upon or\nthat the conditions for exercise of power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act do\nnot exist or that the qualification contemplated for the arbitrator by the\nparties cannot be ignored and has to be borne in mind, are all\nadjudications which affect the rights of parties. It cannot be said that\nwhen the Chief Justice decides that he has jurisdiction to proceed with the\nmatter, that there is an arbitration agreement and that one of the parties\nto it has failed to act according to the procedure agreed upon, he is not\nadjudicating on the rights of the party who is raising these objections.\nThe duty to decide the preliminary facts enabling the exercise of\njurisdiction or power, gets all the more emphasized, when sub-Section (7)\ndesignates the order under sub-sections (4), (5) or (6) a 'decision' and\nmakes the decision of the Chief Justice final on the matters referred to in\nthat sub-Section. Thus, going by the general principles of law and the\nscheme of\nSection 11\n, it is difficult to call the order of the Chief\nJustice merely an administrative order and to say that the opposite side\nneed not even be heard before the Chief Justice exercises his power of\nappointing an arbitrator. Even otherwise, when a statute confers a power or\nimposes a duty on the highest judicial authority in the State or in the\ncountry, that authority, unless shown otherwise, has to act judicially and\nhas necessarily to consider whether his power has been rightly invoked or\nthe conditions for the performance of his duty are shown to exist.\n\n11.\nSection 16\nof the Act only makes explicit what is even otherwise\nimplicit, namely, that the arbitral tribunal constituted under the Act has\nthe jurisdiction to rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on\nobjections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration\nagreement. Sub-section (1) also directs that an arbitration clause which\nforms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of\nthe other terms of the contract. It also clarifies that a decision by the\narbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso\njure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. Sub-section (2) of\nSection\nenjoins that a party wanting to raise a plea that the arbitral tribunal\ndoes not have jurisdiction, has to raise that objection not later than the\nsubmission of the statement of defence, and that the party shall not be\nprecluded from raising the plea of jurisdiction merely because he has\nappointed or participated in the appointment of an arbitrator. Sub-section\n(3) lays down that a plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope\nof its authority, shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be\nbeyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral\nproceedings. When the Tribunal decides these two questions, namely, the\nquestion of jurisdiction and the question of exceeding the scope of Page\n1804 authority or either of them, the same is open to immediate challenge\nin an appeal, when the objection is upheld and only in an appeal against\nthe final award, when the objection is overruled. Sub-section (5) enjoins\nthat if the arbitral tribunal overrules the objections under sub-section\n(2) or sub-section (3), it should continue with the arbitral proceedings\nand make an arbitral award. Sub-section (6) provides that a party aggrieved\nby such an arbitral award overruling the plea on lack of jurisdiction and\nthe exceeding of the scope of authority, may make an application on these\ngrounds for setting aside the award in accordance with\nSection 34\nof the\nAct. The question, in the context of Sub-Section (7) of\nSection 11\nis, what\nis the scope of the right conferred on the arbitral tribunal to rule upon\nits own jurisdiction and the existence of the arbitration clause, envisaged\nby\nSection 16(1)\n, once the Chief Justice or the person designated by him\nhad appointed an arbitrator after satisfying himself that the conditions\nfor the exercise of power to appoint an arbitrator are present in the case.\nPrima facie, it would be difficult to say that in spite of the finality\nconferred by sub-Section (7) of\nSection 11\nof the Act, to such a decision\nof the Chief Justice, the arbitral tribunal can still go behind that\ndecision and rule on its own jurisdiction or on the existence of an\narbitration clause. It also appears to us to be incongruous to say that\nafter the Chief Justice had appointed an arbitral tribunal, the arbitral\ntribunal can turn round and say that the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction\nor authority to appoint the tribunal, the very creature brought into\nexistence by the exercise of power by its creator, the Chief Justice. The\nargument of learned Senior Counsel, Mr. K.K. Venugopal that\nSection 16\nhas\nfull play only when an arbitral tribunal is constituted without\nintervention under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, is one way of reconciling that\nprovision with\nSection 11\nof the Act, especially in the context of sub-\nsection (7) thereof. We are inclined to the view that the decision of the\nChief Justice on the issue of jurisdiction and the existence of a valid\narbitration agreement would be binding on the parties when the matter goes\nto the arbitral tribunal and at subsequent stages of the proceeding except\nin an appeal in the Supreme Court in the case of the decision being by the\nChief Justice of the High Court or by a Judge of the High Court designated\nby him.\n\n12. It is common ground that the Act has adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on\nInternational Commercial Arbitration. But at the same time, it has made\nsome departures from the model law.\nSection 11\nis in the place of\nArticle\nof the Model Law. The Model Law provides for the making of a request\nunder\nArticle 11\nto \"the court or other authority specified in\nArticle 6\nto\ntake the necessary measure\". The words in\nSection 11\nof the Act, are \"the\nChief Justice or the person or institution designated by him\". The fact\nthat instead of the court, the powers are conferred on the Chief Justice,\nhas to be appreciated in the context of the statute. 'Court' is defined in\nthe Act to be the principal civil court of original jurisdiction of the\ndistrict and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original\ncivil jurisdiction. The principal civil court of original jurisdiction is\nnormally the District Court. The High Courts in India exercising ordinary\noriginal civil jurisdiction are not too many. So in most of the States the\nconcerned court would be the District Court. Obviously, the Parliament did\nnot want to confer the power on the District Court, to entertain a request\nfor appointing an arbitrator or for constituting an arbitral tribunal under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act. It has to be noted that under\nSection 9\nof the Act,\nthe District Court or the High Page 1805 Court exercising original\njurisdiction, has the power to make interim orders prior to, during or even\npost arbitration. It has also the power to entertain a challenge to the\naward that may ultimately be made. The framers of the statute must\ncertainly be taken to have been conscious of the definition of 'court' in\nthe Act. It is easily possible to contemplate that they did not want the\npower under\nSection 11\nto be conferred on the District Court or the High\nCourt exercising original jurisdiction. The intention apparently was to\nconfer the power on the highest judicial authority in the State and in the\ncountry, on Chief Justices of High Courts and on the Chief Justice of\nIndia. Such a provision is necessarily intended to add the greatest\ncredibility to the arbitral process. The argument that the power thus\nconferred on the Chief Justice could not even be delegated to any other\nJudge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, stands negatived only\nbecause of the power given to designate another. The intention of the\nlegislature appears to be clear that it wanted to ensure that the power\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act was exercised by the highest judicial\nauthority in the concerned State or in the country. This is to ensure the\nutmost authority to the process of constituting the arbitral tribunal.\n\n13. Normally, when a power is conferred on the highest judicial authority\nwho normally performs judicial functions and is the head of the judiciary\nof the State or of the country, it is difficult to assume that the power is\nconferred on the Chief Justice as persona designata. Under\nSection 11(6)\n,\nthe Chief Justice is given a power to designate another to perform the\nfunctions under that provision. That power has generally been designated to\na Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court respectively. Persona\ndesignata, according to Black's Law Dictionary, means \"A person considered\nas an individual rather than as a member of a class\". When the power is\nconferred on the Chief Justices of the High Courts, the power is conferred\non a class and not considering that person as an individual.\nIn the\nCentral\nTalkies Ltd., Kanpur v. Dwarka Prasad\nwhile considering the status in which\nthe power was to be exercised by the District Magistrate under the United\nProvinces (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, this Court\nheld:\n\n\"a persona designata is \"a person who is pointed out or described as an\nindividual, as opposed to a person ascertained as a member of a class, or\nas filling a particular character.\" (See Osborn's Concise Law Dictionary,\n4th Edition., p.253). In the words of Schwabe, C.J., in Parthasardhi Naidu\nv. Koteswara Rao, [I.L.R. 47 Mad 369 F.B.] personae designatae are,\n\"persons selected to act in their private capacity and not in their\ncapacity as Judges.\" The same consideration applies also to a well-known\nofficer like the District Magistrate named by virtue of his office, and\nwhose powers the Additional District Magistrate can also exercise and who\ncan create other officers equal to himself for the purpose of the Eviction\nAct.\"\n\nIn\nMukri Gopalan v. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker\nthis Court after\nquoting the above passage from the\nCentral Talkies Ltd., Kanpur v. Dwarka\nPrasad, Page\n1806 applied the test to come to the conclusion that when\n\nSection 18\nof the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1965\nconstituted the District Judge as an appellate authority under that Act, it\nwas a case where the authority was being conferred on District Judges who\nconstituted a class and, therefore, the appellate authority could not be\nconsidered to be persona designata. What can be gathered from P. Ramanatha\nAiyar's Advanced Law Lexicon, 3rd Edition, 2005, is that \"persona\ndesignata\" is a person selected to act in his private capacity and not in\nhis capacity as a judge. He is a person pointed out or described as an\nindividual as opposed to a person ascertained as a member of a class or as\nfilling a particular character. It is also seen that one of the tests to be\napplied is to see whether the person concerned could exercise the power\nonly so long as he holds office or could exercise the power even\nsubsequently. Obviously, on ceasing to be a Chief Justice, the person\nreferred to in\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act could not exercise the power. Thus,\nit is clear that the power is conferred on the Chief Justice under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act not as persona designata.\n\n14. Normally a persona designata cannot delegate his power to another.\nHere, the Chef Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice of India is\ngiven the power to designate another to exercise the power conferred on him\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. If the power is a judicial power, it is\nobvious that the power could be conferred only on a judicial authority and\nin this case, logically on another Judge of the High Court or on a Judge of\nthe Supreme Court. It is logical to consider the conferment of the power on\nthe Chief Justice of the High Court and on the Chief Justice of India as\npresiding Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court and the exercise\nof the power so conferred, is exercise of judicial power/authority as\npresiding Judges of the respective courts. Replacing of the word 'court' in\nthe Model Law with the expression \"Chief Justice\" in the Act, appears to be\nmore for excluding the exercise of power by the District Court and by the\ncourt as an entity leading to obvious consequences in the matter of the\nprocedure to be followed and the rights of appeal governing the matter. The\ndeparture from\nArticle 11\nof the Model Law and the use of the expression\n\"Chief Justice\" cannot be taken to exclude the theory of its being an\nadjudication under\nSection 11\nof the Act by a judicial authority.\n\n15. We may at this stage notice the complementary nature of Sections 8 and\n\n11. Where there is an arbitration agreement between the parties and one of\nthe parties, ignoring it, files an action before a judicial authority and\nthe other party raises the objection that there is an arbitration clause,\nthe judicial authority has to consider that objection and if the objection\nis found sustainable to refer the parties to arbitration. The expression\nused in this Section is 'shall' and this Court in\nP. Anand Gajapathi Raju\nv. P.V. G. Raju\nand in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Pink City\nMidway Petroleum Page 1807 has held that the judicial authority is bound to\nrefer the matter to arbitration once the existence of a valid arbitration\nclause is established. Thus, the judicial authority is entitled to, has to\nand bound to decide the jurisdictional issue raised before it, before\nmaking or declining to make a reference.\nSection 11\nonly covers another\nsituation. Where one of the parties has refused to act in terms of the\narbitration agreement, the other party moves the Chief Justice under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act to have an arbitrator appointed and the first party\nobjects, it would be incongruous to hold that the Chief Justice cannot\ndecide the question of his own jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator when\nin a parallel situation, the judicial authority can do so. Obviously, the\nhighest judicial authority has to decide that question and his competence\nto decide cannot be questioned. If it is held that the Chief Justice has no\nright or duty to decide the question or cannot decide the question, it will\nlead to an anomalous situation in that a judicial authority under\nSection 8\n\ncan decide, but not a Chief Justice under\nSection 11\n, though the nature of\nthe objection is the same and the consequence of accepting the objection in\none case and rejecting it in the other, is also the same, namely, sending\nthe parties to arbitration. The interpretation of\nSection 11\nthat we have\nadopted would not give room for such an anomaly.\n\n16.\nSection 11(6)\ndoes enable the Chief Justice to designate any person or\ninstitution to take the necessary measures on an application made under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. This power to designate recognized in the Chief\nJustice, has led to an argument that a judicial decision making is\nnegatived, in taking the necessary measures on an application, under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. It is pointed out that the Chief Justice may\ndesignate even an institution like the Chamber of Commerce or the Institute\nof Engineers and they are not judicial authorities. Here, we find substance\nin the argument of Mr. F.S.Nariman, learned senior counsel that in the\ncontext of\nSection 5\nof the Act excluding judicial intervention except as\nprovided in the Act, the designation contemplated is not for the purpose of\ndeciding the preliminary facts justifying the exercise of power to appoint\nan arbitrator, but only for the purpose of nominating to the Chief Justice\na suitable person to be appointed as arbitrator, especially, in the context\nof\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act. One of the objects of conferring power on the\nhighest judicial authority in the State or in the country for constituting\nthe arbitral tribunal, is to ensure credibility in the entire arbitration\nprocess and looked at from that point of view, it is difficult to accept\nthe contention that the Chief Justice could designate a non- judicial body\nlike the Chamber of Commerce to decide on the existence of an arbitration\nagreement and so on, which are decisions, normally, judicial or quasi\njudicial in nature.\nWhere a Chief Justice designates not a Judge, but\nanother person or an institution to nominate an arbitral tribunal, that can\nbe done only after questions as to jurisdiction, existence of the agreement\nand the like, are decided first by him or his nominee Judge and what is to\nbe Page 1808 left to be done is only to nominate the members for\nconstituting the arbitral tribunal. Looking at the scheme of the Act as a\nwhole and the object with which it was enacted, replacing the\nArbitration\nAct\nof 1940, it seems to be proper to view the conferment of power on the\nChief Justice as the conferment of a judicial power to decide on the\nexistence of the conditions justifying the constitution of an arbitral\ntribunal. The departure from the UNCITRAL model regarding the conferment of\nthe power cannot be said to be conclusive or significant in the\ncircumstances. Observations of this Court in paragraphs 389 and 391 in\nSupreme Court Advocates on\nRecord Association v. Union of India\nsupport the\nargument that the expression chief justice is used in the sense of\ncollectivity of judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts\nrespectively.\n\n17. It is true that the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not\nconferred on the Supreme Court or on the High Court, but it is conferred on\nthe Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court. One\npossible reason for specifying the authority as the Chief Justice, could be\nthat if it were merely the conferment of the power on the High Court, or\nthe Supreme Court, the matter would be governed by the normal procedure of\nthat Court, including the right of appeal and the Parliament obviously\nwanted to avoid that situation, since one of the objects was to restrict\nthe interference by Courts in the arbitral process. Therefore, the power\nwas conferred on the highest judicial authority in the country and in the\nState in their capacities as Chief Justices. They have been conferred the\npower or the right to pass an order contemplated by\nSection 11\nof the Act.\nWe have already seen that it is not possible to envisage that the power is\nconferred on the Chief Justice as persona designata. Therefore, the fact\nthat the power is conferred on the Chief Justice, and not on the court\npresided over by him is not sufficient to hold that the power thus\nconferred is merely an administrative power and is not a judicial power.\n\n18. It is also not possible to accept the argument that there is an\nexclusive conferment of jurisdiction on the arbitral tribunal, to decide on\nthe existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.\nSection 8\nof the\nAct contemplates a judicial authority before which an action is brought in\na matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement, on the terms\nspecified therein, to refer the dispute to arbitration. A judicial\nauthority as such is not defined in the Act. It would certainly include the\ncourt as defined in\nSection 2(e)\nof the Act and would also, in our opinion,\ninclude other courts and may even include a special tribunal like the\nConsumer Forum (See\nFair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. and Anr. v. N.K. Modi\n.\nWhen the defendant to an action before a judicial authority raises the plea\nthat there is an arbitration agreement and the subject matter of the claim\nis covered by the agreement and the plaintiff or the person who has\napproached the judicial authority for relief, Page 1809 disputes the same,\nthe judicial authority, in the absence of any restriction in the Act, has\nnecessarily to decide whether, in fact, there is in existence a valid\narbitration agreement and whether the dispute that is sought to be raised\nbefore it, is covered by the arbitration clause. It is difficult to\ncontemplate that the judicial authority has also to act mechanically or has\nmerely to see the original arbitration agreement produced before it, and\nmechanically refer the parties to an arbitration. Similarly,\nSection 9\n\nenables a Court, obviously, as defined in the Act, when approached by a\nparty before the commencement of an arbitral proceeding, to grant interim\nrelief as contemplated by the Section. When a party seeks an interim relief\nasserting that there was a dispute liable to be arbitrated upon in terms of\nthe Act, and the opposite party disputes the existence of an arbitration\nagreement as defined in the Act or raises a plea that the dispute involved\nwas not covered by the arbitration clause, or that the Court which was\napproached had no jurisdiction to pass any order in terms of\nSection 9\nof\nthe Act, that Court has necessarily to decide whether it has jurisdiction,\nwhether there is an arbitration agreement which is valid in law and whether\nthe dispute sought to be raised is covered by that agreement. There is no\nindication in the Act that the powers of the Court are curtailed on these\naspects. On the other hand,\nSection 9\ninsists that once approached in that\nbehalf, \"the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it has\nfor the purpose of and in relation to any proceeding before it\".\n\nSurely,\nwhen a matter is entrusted to a Civil Court in the ordinary hierarchy of\nCourts without anything more, the procedure of that Court would govern the\nadjudication [See\nR.M.A.R.A. Adaikappa Chettiar and Anr. v. R.\nChandrasekhara Thevar\n(AIR 1948 P.C. 12)]\n\n19.\nSection 16\nis said to be the recognition of the principle of Kompetenz\n\n- Kompetenz. The fact that the arbitral tribunal has the competence to rule\non its own jurisdiction and to define the contours of its jurisdiction,\nonly means that when such issues arise before it, the Tribunal can and\npossibly, ought to decide them. This can happen when the parties have gone\nto the arbitral tribunal without recourse to\nSection 8\nor 11 of the Act.\nBut where the jurisdictional issues are decided under these Sections,\nbefore a reference is made,\nSection 16\ncannot be held to empower the\narbitral tribunal to ignore the decision given by the judicial authority or\nthe Chief Justice before the reference to it was made. The competence to\ndecide does not enable the arbitral tribunal to get over the finality\nconferred on an order passed prior to its entering upon the reference by\nthe very statute that creates it. That is the position arising out of\n\nSection 11(7)\nof the Act read with\nSection 16\nthereof. The finality given\nto the order of the Chief Justice on the matters within his competence\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act, are incapable of being reopened before the\narbitral tribunal.\nIn\nKonkan Railway\n(Supra) what is considered is only the\nfact that under\nSection 16\n, the arbitral tribunal has the right to rule on\nits own jurisdiction and any objection, with respect to the existence or\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement. What is the impact of\nSection 11(7)\n\nof the Act on the arbitral tribunal constituted by an order under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, was not considered. Obviously, this was because of the\nview taken in that decision that the Chief Justice is not expected to\ndecide anything while entertaining a request under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\nand is only performing an administrative function in appointing an arbitral\ntribunal. Once it is held that there is an Page 1810 adjudicatory function\nentrusted to the Chief Justice by the Act, obviously, the right of the\narbitral tribunal to go behind the order passed by the Chief Justice would\ntake another hue and would be controlled by\nSection 11(7)\nof the Act.\n\n20. We will now consider the prior decisions of this Court.\nIn\nSundaram\nFinance Ltd. v. NEPC India Ltd.\nthis Court held that the provisions of the\nAct must be interpreted and construed independently of the interpretation\nplaced on the\nArbitration Act, 1940\nand it will be more relevant to refer\nto the UNCITRAL model law while called upon to interpret the provisions of\nthe Act. This\nCourt further held\nthat under the 1996 Act, appointment of\narbitrator(s) is made as per the provision of\nSection 11\nwhich does not\nrequire the Court to pass a judicial order appointing an arbitrator or\narbitrators. It is seen that the question was not discussed as such, since\nthe court\nin that case\nwas not concerned with the interpretation of\nSection\nof the Act.\n\nThe view as above was quoted with approval in\nAdor Samia\nPrivate Limited v. Peekay Holdings Limited and Ors.\nand nothing further was\nsaid about the question. In other words, the question as to the nature of\nthe order to be passed by the Chief Justice when moved under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, was not discussed or decided upon.\n\n21.\nIn\nWellington Associates Ltd. v. Kirit Mehta\nit was contended before\nthe designated Judge that what was relied on by the applicant was not an\narbitration clause. The applicant contended that the Chief Justice of India\nor the designate Judge cannot decide that question and only the arbitrator\ncan decide the question in view of\nSection 16\nof the Act. The designated\nJudge held that\nSection 16\ndid not exclude the jurisdiction of the Chief\nJustice of India or the designated Judge to decide the question of the\nexistence of an arbitration clause. After considering the relevant aspects,\nthe learned Judge held:\n\n\"I am of the view that in cases where --- to start with - there is a\ndispute raised at the stage of the application under\nSection 11\nthat there\nis no arbitration clause at all, then it will be absurd to refer the very\nissue to an arbitrator without deciding whether there is an arbitration\nclause at all between the parties to start with. In my view, in the present\nsituation, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of India or his designate\nto decide the question as to the \"existence\" of the arbitration clause\ncannot be doubted and cannot be said to be excluded by\nSection 16\n.\"\n\n22. Then came\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v. Mehul Construction Co.\nin\nwhich\nthe first question framed was, what Page 1811 was the nature of the order\npassed by the Chief Justice or his nominee in exercise of his power under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996? After noticing\nthe Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Act and after comparing the\nlanguage of\nSection 11\nof the Act and the corresponding article of the\nmodel law, it was stated that the Act has designated the Chief Justice of\nthe High Court in cases of domestic arbitration and the Chief Justice of\nIndia in cases of international commercial arbitration, to be the authority\nto perform the function of appointment of an arbitrator, whereas under the\nmodel law, the said power was vested with the court. When the matter is\nplaced before the Chief Justice or his nominee under\nSection 11\nof the Act\nit was imperative for the Chief Justice or his nominee to bear in mind the\nlegislative intent that the arbitral process should be set in motion\nwithout any delay whatsoever and all contentious issues left to be raised\nbefore the arbitral tribunal itself. It was further held that at that\nstage, it would not be appropriate for the Chief Justice or his nominee, to\nentertain any contention or decide the same between the parties. It was\nalso held that in view of the conferment of power on the arbitral tribunal\nunder\nSection 16\nof the Act, the intention of the legislature and its\nanxiety to see that the arbitral process is set in motion at the earliest,\nit will be appropriate for the Chief Justice to appoint an arbitrator\nwithout wasting any time or without entertaining any contentious issue by a\nparty objecting to the appointment of an arbitrator. The Court stated:\n\n\"Bearing in mind the purpose of legislation, the language used in\nSection\n11(6)\nconferring power on the Chief Justice or his nominee to appoint an\narbitrator, the curtailment of the power of the court in the matter of\ninterference, the expanding jurisdiction of the arbitrator in course of the\narbitral proceeding, and above all the main objective, namely, the\nconfidence of the international market for speedy disposal of their\ndisputes, the character and status of an order appointing an arbitrator by\nthe Chief Justice or his nominee under\nSection 11(6)\nhas to be decided\nupon. If it is held that an order under\nSection 11(6)\nis a judicial or\nquasi-judicial order then the said order would be amenable to judicial\nintervention and any reluctant party may frustrate the entire purpose of\nthe Act by adopting dilatory tactics in approaching a court of law even\nagainst an order of appointment of an arbitrator. Such an interpretation\nhas to be avoided in order to achieve the basic objective for which the\ncountry has enacted the Act of 1996 adopting the UNCITRAL Model.\"\n\n23. The Court proceeded to say that if it were to be held that the order\npassed was purely administrative in nature, that would facilitate the\nachieving of the object of the Act, namely, quickly setting in motion the\nprocess of arbitration. Great emphasis was placed on the conferment of\npower on the Chief Justice in preference to a court as was obtaining in the\nmodel law. It was concluded \" The nature of the function performed by the\nChief Justice being essentially to aid the constitution of the arbitral\ntribunal immediately and the legislature having consciously chosen to\nconfer the power on the Chief Justice and not a court, it is apparent that\nthe order passed by the Chief Justice or his nominee is an administrative\nPage 1812 order as has been held by this Court in\nAdor Samia\ncase (supra)\nand the observations of this Court in\nSundaram Finance Ltd.\ncase (supra)\nalso are quite appropriate and neither of those decisions require any\nreconsideration.\"\n\n24. It was thus held that an order passed under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act,\nby the Chief Justice of the High Court or his nominee, was an\nadministrative order, its purpose being the speedy disposal of commercial\ndisputes and that such an order could not be subjected to judicial review\nunder\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India. Even an order refusing to\nappoint an arbitrator would not be amenable to the jurisdiction of the\nSupreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. A petition under\n\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution was also not maintainable. But, an order\nrefusing to appoint an arbitrator made by the Chief Justice could be\nchallenged before the High Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\nWhat seems to have persuaded this Court was the fact that the statement of\nobjects and reasons of the Act clearly enunciated that the main object of\nthe legislature was to minimize the supervisory role of courts in arbitral\nprocess. Since\nSection 16\nempowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own\njurisdiction including ruling on objections with respect to the existence\nor validity of an arbitration agreement, a party would have the opportunity\nto raise his grievance against that decision either immediately or while\nchallenging the award after it was pronounced. Since it was not proper to\nencourage a party to an arbitration, to frustrate the entire purpose of the\nAct by adopting dilatory tactics by approaching the court even against the\norder of appointment of an arbitrator, it was necessary to take the view\nthat the order was administrative in nature. This was all the more so,\nsince the nature of the function performed by the Chief Justice was\nessentially to aid the constitution of the arbitral tribunal immediately\nand the legislature having consciously chosen to confer the power on the\nChief Justice and not on the court, it was apparent that the order was an\nadministrative order. With respect, it has to be pointed out that this\nCourt did not discus or consider the nature of the power that the Chief\nJustice is called upon to exercise. Merely because the main purpose was the\nconstitution of an arbitral tribunal, it could not be taken that the\nexercise of power is an administrative power. While constituting an\narbitral tribunal, on the scheme of the Act, the Chief Justice has to\nconsider whether he as the Chief Justice has jurisdiction in relation to\nthe contract, whether there was an arbitration agreement in terms of\n\nSection 7\nof the Act and whether the person before him with the request, is\na party to the arbitration agreement. On coming to a conclusion on these\naspects, he has to enquire whether the conditions for exercise of his power\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act exist in the case and only on being\nsatisfied in that behalf, he could appoint an arbitrator or an arbitral\ntribunal on the basis of the request. It is difficult to say that when one\nof the parties raises an objection that there is no arbitration Page 1813\nagreement, raises an objection that the person who has come forward with a\nrequest is not a party to the arbitration agreement, the Chief Justice can\ncome to a conclusion on those objections without following an adjudicatory\nprocess. Can he constitute an arbitrary tribunal, without considering these\nquestions? If he can do so, why should such a function be entrusted to a\nhigh judicial authority like the Chief Justice. Similarly, when the party\nraises an objection that the conditions for exercise of the power under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act are not fulfilled and the Chief Justice comes to\nthe conclusion that they have been fulfilled, it is difficult to say that\nhe was not adjudicating on a dispute between the parties and was merely\npassing an administrative order. It is also not correct to say that by the\nmere constitution of an arbitral tribunal the rights of parties are not\naffected. Dragging a party to an arbitration when there existed no\narbitration agreement or when there existed no arbitrable dispute, can\ncertainly affect the right of that party and even on monetary terms, impose\non him a serious liability for meeting the expenses of the arbitration,\neven if it be preliminary expenses and his objection is upheld by the\narbitral tribunal. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the position\nthat no adjudication is involved in the constitution of an arbitral\ntribunal.\n\n25. It is also somewhat incongruous to permit the order of the Chief\nJustice under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act being subjected to scrutiny under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution at the hands of another Judge of the High Court. In the\nabsence of any conferment of an appellate power, it may not be possible to\nsay that a certiorari would lie against the decision of the High Court in\nthe very same High Court. Even in the case of an international arbitration,\nthe decision of the Chief Justice of India would be amenable to challenge\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution before a High Court. While construing\nthe scope of the power under\nSection 11(6)\n, it will not be out of place for\nthe court to bear this aspect in mind, since after all, courts follow or\nattempt to follow certain judicial norms and that precludes such challenges\n(see\nNaresh Shridhar Mirajkar and Ors. v. State of Maharashtra and Anr.\nand\n\nRupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra and Anr..\n\n26.\nIn\nNimet Resourcs Inc. and Anr. v. Essar Steels Ltd.\nthe question of\nexistence or otherwise of an arbitration agreement between the parties was\nitself held to be referable to the arbitrator since the order proceeded on\nthe basis that the power under\nSection 11(6)\nwas merely administrative.\n\n27. The correctness of the decision in\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v.\nMehul Construction Co.\n(supra) was doubted in\nKonkan Railway Cooperation\nLtd. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. The\nreconsideration was recommended on\nthe ground that the Act did not take away the power of the Court to decide\npreliminary issues notwithstanding the arbitrator's competence to decide\nsuch issues including whether particular matters were \"excepted matters\",\nor whether an arbitration agreement existed or whether there was a dispute\nin terms of the agreement. It was noticed that in other countries where\nUNCITRAL model was being followed, the court could decide such issues\njudicially and need not mechanically appoint an arbitrator. There were\nsituations where preliminary issues would have to be decided by the court\nrather than by the arbitrator. If the order of the Chief Justice or his\nnominees were to be treated as an administrative one, it could be\nchallenged before the single Judge of the High Court, then before a\nDivision Bench and then the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution, a result that would cause further delay in arbitral\nproceedings, something sought to be prevented by the Act. An order under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act did not relate to the administrative functions of the\nChief Justice or of the Chief Justice of India.\n\n28. The reference came up before a Constitution Bench.\nIn\nKonkan Railway\nConstruction Ltd. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\n, the Constitution Bench\nreiterated the view taken in\nMehul Construction Co.\n's case (supra), if we\nmay say so with respect, without really answering the questions posed by\nthe order of reference. It was stated that there is nothing in\nSection 11\n\nof the Act that requires the party other than the party making the request,\nto be given notice of the proceedings before the Chief Justice. The Court\nwent on to say that\nSection 11\ndid not contemplate a response from the\nother party. The approach was to say that none of the requirements referred\nto in\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act contemplated or amounted to an adjudication\nby the Chief Justice while appointing an arbitrator. The scheme framed\nunder the\nArbitration Act\nby the Chief Justice of India was held to be not\nmandatory. It was stated that the UNCITRAL model law was only taken into\naccount and hence the model law, or judgments and literature thereon, was\nnot a guide to the interpretation of the Act and especially of\nSection 11\n.\n\n29. With respect, what was the effect of the Chief Justice having to decide\nhis own jurisdiction in a given case was not considered by the Bench.\nSurely, the question whether the Chief Justice could entertain the\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act could not be left to the\ndecision of the arbitral tribunal constituted by him on entertaining such\nan application. We also feel that adequate attention was not paid to the\nrequirement of the Chief Justice having to decide that there is an\narbitration agreement in terms of\nSection 7\nof the Act before he could\nexercise his power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act and its implication. The\naspect, whether there was an arbitration agreement, was not merely a\njurisdictional fact for commencing the arbitration itself, but it Page 1815\nwas also a jurisdictional fact for appointing an arbitrator on a motion\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, was not kept in view. A Chief Justice could\nappoint an arbitrator in exercise of his power only if there existed an\narbitration agreement and without holding that there was an agreement, it\nwould not be open to him to appoint an arbitrator saying that he was\nappointing an arbitrator since he has been moved in that behalf and the\napplicant before him asserts that there is an arbitration agreement.\nAcceptance of such an argument, with great respect, would reduce the high\njudicial authority entrusted with the power to appoint an arbitrator, an\nautomaton and sub-servient to the arbitral tribunal which he himself brings\ninto existence. Our system of law does not contemplate such a situation.\n\n30. With great respect, it is seen that the court did not really consider\nthe nature of the rights of the parties involved when the Chief Justice\nexercised the power of constituting the arbitral tribunal. The court also\ndid not consider whether it was not necessary for the Chief Justice to\nsatisfy himself of the existence of the facts which alone would entitle him\nor enable him to accede to the request for appointment of an arbitrator and\nwhat was the nature of that process by which he came to the conclusion that\nan arbitral tribunal was liable to be constituted. When, for example, a\ndispute which no more survives as a dispute, was referred to an arbitral\ntribunal or when an arbitral tribunal was constituted even in the absence\nof an arbitration agreement as understood by the Act, how could the rights\nof the objecting party be said to be not affected, was not considered in\nthat perspective. In other words, the Constitution Bench proceeded on the\nbasis that while exercising power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act there was\nnothing for the Chief Justice to decide. With respect, the very question\nthat fell for decision was whether there had to be an adjudication on the\npreliminary matters involved and when the result had to depend on that\nadjudication, what was the nature of that adjudication. It is in that\ncontext that a reconsideration of\nthe said decision\nis sought for in this\ncase. The ground of ensuring minimum judicial intervention by itself is not\na ground to hold that the power exercised by the Chief Justice is only an\nadministrative function. As pointed out in the order of reference to that\nBench, the conclusion that it is only an administrative act is the opening\nof the gates for an approach to the High Court under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution, for an appeal under the Letters Patent or the concerned\nHigh\nCourt Act\nto a Division Bench and a further appeal to this Court under\n\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n31. Moreover, in a case where the objection to jurisdiction or the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement is overruled by the arbitral\ntribunal, the party has to participate in the arbitration proceedings\nextending over a period of time by incurring substantial expenditure and\nthen to come to court with an application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act seeking the setting aside of the award on the ground that\nthere was no arbitration agreement or that there was nothing to be\narbitrated upon when the tribunal was constituted. Though this may avoid\nintervention by court until the award is pronounced, it does mean\nconsiderable expenditure and time spent by the party before the arbitral\ntribunal. On the other hand, if even at the initial stage, the Chief\nJustice judicially pronounces that he has jurisdiction to appoint an\narbitrator, Page 1816 that there is an arbitration agreement between the\nparties, that there was a live and subsisting dispute for being referred to\narbitration and constitutes the tribunal as envisaged, on being satisfied\nof the existence of the conditions for the exercise of his power, ensuring\nthat the arbitrator is a qualified arbitrator, that will put an end to a\nhost of disputes between the parties, leaving the party aggrieved with a\nremedy of approaching this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution.\nThat would give this Court, an opportunity of scrutinizing the decision of\nthe Chief Justice on merits and deciding whether it calls for interference\nin exercise of its plenary power. Once this Court declines to interfere\nwith the adjudication of the Chief Justice to the extent it is made, it\nbecomes final. This reasoning is also supported by sub-section (7) of\n\nSection 11\n, making final, the decision of the Chief Justice on the matters\ndecided by him while constituting the arbitral tribunal. This will leave\nthe arbitral tribunal to decide the dispute on merits unhampered by\npreliminary and technical objections. In the long run, especially in the\ncontext of the judicial system in our country, this would be more conducive\nto minimising judicial intervention in matters coming under the Act. This\nwill also avert the situation where even the order of the Chief Justice of\nIndia could be challenged before a single judge of the High Court invoking\nthe\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India or before an arbitral\ntribunal, consisting not necessarily of legally trained persons and their\ncoming to a conclusion that their constitution by the Chief Justice was not\nwarranted in the absence of an arbitration agreement or in the absence of a\ndispute in terms of the agreement.\n\n32.\nSection 8\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940 enabled the court when\napproached in that behalf to supply an omission.\nSection 20\nof that Act\nenabled the court to compel the parties to produce the arbitration\nagreement and then to appoint an arbitrator for adjudicating on the\ndisputes. It may be possible to say that\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act combines\nboth the powers. May be, it is more in consonance with\nSection 8\nof the Old\nAct. But to call the power merely as an administrative one, does not appear\nto be warranted in the context of the relevant provisions of the Act. First\nof all, the power is conferred not on an administrative authority, but on a\njudicial authority, the highest judicial authority in the State or in the\ncountry. No doubt, such authorities also perform administrative functions.\nAn appointment of an arbitral tribunal in terms of\nSection 11\nof the Act,\nis based on a power derived from a statute and the statute itself\nprescribes the conditions that should exist for the exercise of that power.\nIn the process of exercise of that power, obviously the parties would have\nthe right of being heard and when the existence of the conditions for the\nexercise of the power are found on accepting or overruling the contentions\nof one of the parties it necessarily amounts to an order, judicial in\nnature, having finality subject to any available judicial challenge as\nenvisaged by the Act or any other statute or the Constitution. Looked at\nfrom that point of view also, it seems to be appropriate to hold that the\nChief Justice exercises a judicial power while appointing an arbitrator.\n\n33. In Attorney Geenral of the Gambia v. Pierre Sarr N'jie (1961 Appeal\nCases 617) the question arose whether the power to judge an alleged\nprofessional misconduct could be delegated to a Deputy Judge by the Chief\nJustice who Page 1817 had the power to suspend any barrister or solicitor\nfrom practicing within the jurisdiction of the court. Under\nSection 7\nof\nthe Supreme Court Ordinance of the Gambia, the Deputy Judge could exercise\n\"all the judicial powers of the Judge of the Supreme Court\". The question\nwas, whether the taking of disciplinary action for professional misconduct;\nwas a judicial power or an administrative power. The Judicial Committee of\nthe Privy Council held that a judge exercises judicial powers not only when\nhe is deciding suits between the parties but also when he exercises\ndisciplinary powers which are properly appurtenant to the office of a\njudge. By way of illustration, Lord Dening stated \"Suppose, for instance,\nthat a judge finding that a legal practitioner had been guilty of\nprofessional misconduct in the course of a case, orders him to pay the\ncosts, as he has undoubtedly power to do (see Myers v. Elman, per Lord\nWright). That would be an exercise of the judicial powers of the judge just\nas much as if he committed him for contempt of court. Yet there is no\ndifference in quality between the power to order him to pay costs and the\npower to suspend him or strike him off.\"\n\n34. The above example gives an indication that it is the nature of the\npower that is relevant and not the mode of exercise.\nIn\nShankarlal Aggarwal\nand Ors. v. Shankar Lal Poddar and Ors.\nthis Court was dealing with the\nquestion whether the order of the Company Judge confirming a sale was\nmerely an administrative order passed in the course of the administration\nof the assets of the company under liquidation and, therefore, not a\njudicial order subject to appeal. This Court held that the order of the\nCompany Judge confirming the sale was not an administrative but a judicial\norder. Their Lordships stated thus:\n\n\"It is not correct to say that every order of the Court, merely for the\nreason that it is passed in the course of the realization of the assets of\nthe Company, must always be treated merely as an administrative one. The\nquestion ultimately depends upon the nature of the order that is passed. An\norder according sanction to a sale undoubtedly involves a discretion and\ncannot be termed merely an administrative order, for before confirming the\nsale the court has to be satisfied, particularly where the confirmation is\nopposed, that the sale has been held in accordance with the conditions\nsubject to which alone the liquidator has been permitted to effect it, and\nthat even otherwise the sale has been fair and has not resulted in any loss\nto the parties who would ultimately have to share the realization.\nIt is not possible to formulate a definition which would satisfactorily\ndistinguish between an administrative and a judicial order. That the power\nis entrusted to or wielded by a person who functions as a court is not\ndecisive of the question whether the act or decision is administrative or\njudicial. An administrative order would be one which is directed to the\nregulation or supervision of matters as distinguished from an order which\ndecides the rights of parties or confers or refuses to confer rights to\nproperty which are the subject of adjudication before the court. One of the\ntests would be whether a matter which involves the exercise of discretion\nis left for the decision of the authority, particularly if that authority\nwere a court, Page 1818 and if the discretion has to be exercised on\nobjective, as distinguished from a purely subjective consideration, it\nwould be a judicial decision. It has sometimes been said that the essence\nof a judicial proceeding or of a judicial order is that there would be two\nparties and a lis between them which is the subject of adjudication, as a\nresult of that order or a decision on an issue between a proposal and an\nopposition. No doubt it would not be possible to describe an order passed\ndeciding a lis between the authority that is not a judicial order but it\ndoes not follow that the absence of a lis necessarily negatives the order\nbeing judicial. Even viewed from this narrow standpoint, it is possible to\nhold that there was a lis before the Company Judge which he decided by\npassing the order. On the one hand were the claims of the highest bidder\nwho put forward the contention that he had satisfied the requirements laid\ndown for the acceptance of his bid and was consequently entitled to have\nthe sale in his favour confirmed, particularly so as he was supported in\nthis behalf by the Official Liquidators. On the other hand, there was the\nfirst respondent and the large body of unsecured creditors whose interests,\neven if they were not represented by the first respondent, the court was\nbound to protect. If the sale of which confirmation was sought was\ncharacterized by any deviation subject to which the sale was directed to be\nheld or even otherwise was for a gross undervalue in the sense that very\nmuch more could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the sale were\nproperly held, in view of the figure of Rs. 3,37,000/- which had been bid\nby Nandlal Agarwalla it would be duty of the court to refuse the\nconfirmation in the interests of the general body of creditors, and this\nwas the submission made by the first respondent. There were thus two points\nof view presented to the court by two contending parties or interests and\nthe court was called upon to decide between them, and the decision vitally\naffected the rights of the parties to property. Under the circumstances,\nthe order of the Company Judge was a judicial order and not administrative\none, and was therefore not inherently incapable of being brought up in\nappeal.\"\n\n35. Going by the above test it is seen that at least in the matter of\ndeciding his own jurisdiction and in the matter of deciding on the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement, the Chief Justice when confronted\nwith two points of view presented by the rival parties, is called upon to\ndecide between them and the decision vitally affects the rights of the\nparties in that, either the claim for appointing an arbitral tribunal\nleading to an award is denied to a party or the claim to have an\narbitration proceeding set in motion for entertaining a claim is\nfacilitated by the Chief Justice. In this context, it is not possible to\nsay that the Chief Justice is merely exercising an administrative function\nwhen called upon to appoint an arbitrator and that he need not even issue\nnotice to opposite side before appointing an arbitrator.\n\n36. It is fundamental to our procedural jurisprudence, that the right of no\nperson shall be affected without he being heard. This necessarily imposes\nan obligation on the Chief Justice to issue notice to the opposite party\nwhen he is moved under\nSection 11\nof the Act. The notice to the opposite\nparty cannot be considered to be merely an intimation to that party of the\nfiling of the arbitration application and the passing of an administrative\norder Page 1819 appointing an arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal. It is\nreally the giving of an opportunity of being heard. There have been cases\nwhere claims for appointment of an arbitrator based on an arbitration\nagreement are made ten or twenty years after the period of the contract has\ncome to an end. There have been cases where the appointment of an\narbitrator has been sought, after the parties had settled the accounts and\nthe concerned party had certified that he had no further claims against the\nother contracting party. In other words, there have been occasions when\ndead claims are sought to be resurrected. There have been cases where\nassertions are made of the existence of arbitration agreements when, in\nfact, such existence is strongly disputed by the other side who appears on\nissuance of notice. Controversies are also raised as to whether the claim\nthat is sought to be put forward comes within the purview of the concerned\narbitration clause at all.\nThe Chief Justice has necessarily to apply his\nmind to these aspects before coming to a conclusion one way or the other\nand before proceeding to appoint an arbitrator or declining to appoint an\narbitrator. Obviously, this is an adjudicatory process. An opportunity of\nhearing to both parties is a must. Even in administrative functions if\nrights are affected, rules of natural justice step in. The principles\nsettled by Ridge v. Baldwin [(1963) 2 ALL ER 66] are well known, therefore,\nto the extent,\nKonkan Railway\n(supra) states that no notice need be issued\nto the opposite party to give him an opportunity of being heard before\nappointing an arbitrator, with respect, the same has to be held to be not\nsustainable.\n\n37. It is true that finality under\nSection 11 (7)\nof the Act is attached\nonly to a decision of the Chief Justice on a matter entrusted by sub-\nSection (4) or sub-Section (5) or sub-Section (6) of that Section. Sub-\nSection (4) deals with the existence of an appointment procedure and the\nfailure of a party to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days from the\nreceipt of a request to do so from the other party or when the two\nappointed arbitrators fail to agree on the presiding arbitrator within 30\ndays of their appointment. Sub-Section (5) deals with the parties failing\nto agree in nominating a sole arbitrator within 30 days of the request in\nthat behalf made by one of the parties to the arbitration agreement and\nsub-Section (6) deals with the Chief Justice appointing an arbitrator or an\narbitral tribunal when the party or the two arbitrators or a person\nincluding an institution entrusted with the function, fails to perform the\nsame. The finality, at first blush, could be said to be only on the\ndecision on these matters. But the basic requirement for exercising his\npower under\nSection 11(6)\n, is the existence of an arbitration agreement in\nterms of\nSection 7\nof the Act and the applicant before the Chief Justice\nbeing shown to be a party to such an agreement. It would also include the\nquestion of the existence of jurisdiction in him to entertain the request\nand an enquiry whether at least a part of the cause of action has arisen\nwithin the concerned State. Therefore, a decision on jurisdiction and on\nthe existence of the arbitration agreement and of the person making the\nrequest being a party to that agreement and the subsistence of an\narbitrable dispute require to be decided and the decision on these aspects\nis a prelude to the Chief Justice considering whether the requirements of\nsub-Section (4), sub-Section (5) or sub-Section (6) of\nSection 11\nare\nsatisfied when approached with the request for appointment of an\narbitrator. It is difficult to understand the finality to referred to in\n\nSection 11(7)\nas excluding the decision Page 1820 on his competence and the\nlocus standi of the party who seeks to invoke his jurisdiction to appoint\nan arbitrator. Viewed from that angle, the decision on all these aspects\nrendered by the Chief Justice would attain finality and it is obvious that\nthe decision on these aspects could be taken only after notice to the\nparties and after hearing them.\n\n38. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, approached\nwith an application under\nSection 11\nof the Act, is to decide at that\nstage. Obviously, he has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense,\nwhether the party making the motion has approached the right High Court. He\nhas to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement, as defined in the\nAct and whether the person who has made the request before him, is a party\nto such an agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can also decide\nthe question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long barred claim that\nwas sought to be resurrected and whether the parties have concluded the\ntransaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and\nobligations or by receiving the final payment without objection. It may not\nbe possible at that stage, to decide whether a live claim made, is one\nwhich comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. It will be\nappropriate to leave that question to be decided by the arbitral tribunal\non taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims involved in the\narbitration. The Chief Justice has to decide whether the applicant has\nsatisfied the conditions for appointing an arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the\nChief Justice can either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the\ndocuments produced or take such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as\nmay be necessary. We think that adoption of this procedure in the context\nof the Act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act of\nexpediting the process of arbitration, without too many approaches to the\ncourt at various stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral tribunal.\n\n39. An aspect that requires to be considered at this stage is the question\nwhether the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice of India\ncan designate a non-judicial body or authority to exercise the power under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. We have already held that, obviously, the\nlegislature did not want to confer the power on the Court as defined in the\nAct, namely, the District Court, and wanted to confer the power on the\nChief Justices of the High Courts and on the Chief Justice of India. Taking\nnote of\nSection 5\nof the Act and the finality attached by\nSection 11 (7)\nof\nthe Act to his order and the conclusion we have arrived at that the\nadjudication is judicial in nature, it is obvious that no person other than\na Judge and no non-judicial body can be designated for entertaining an\napplication for appointing an arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act or\nfor appointing an arbitrator. In our dispensation, judicial powers are to\nbe exercised by the judicial authorities and not by non-judicial\nauthorities. This scheme cannot be taken to have been given the go-by by\nthe provisions in the Act in the light of what we have discussed earlier.\nTherefore, what the Chief Justice can do under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is\nto seek the help of a non-judicial body to point out a suitable person as\nan arbitrator in the context of\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act and on getting the\nnecessary information, if it is acceptable, to name that person as the\narbitrator or the set of persons as the arbitral tribunal.\n\n40. Then the question is whether the Chief Justice of the High Court can\ndesignate a district judge to perform the functions under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act. We have seen the definition of '\nCourt' in the Act\n. We have\nreasoned that the intention of the legislature was not to entrust the duty\nof appointing an arbitrator to the District Court. Since the intention of\nthe statute was to entrust the power to the highest judicial authorities in\nthe State and in the country, we have no hesitation in holding that the\nChief Justice cannot designate a district judge to perform the functions\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. This restriction on the power of the Chief\nJustice on designating a district judge or a non-judicial authority flows\nfrom the scheme of the Act.\n\n41. In our dispensation of justice, especially in respect of matters\nentrusted to the ordinary hierarchy of courts or judicial authorities, the\nduty would normally be performed by a judicial authority according to the\nnormal procedure of that court or of that authority. When the Chief Justice\nof the High Court is entrusted with the power, he would be entitled to\ndesignate another judge of the High Court for exercising that power.\nSimilarly, the Chief Justice of India would be in a position to designate\nanother judge of the Supreme Court to exercise the power under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act. When so entrusted with the right to exercise such a\npower, the judge of the High Court and the judge of the Supreme Court would\nbe exercising the power vested in the Chief Justice of the High Court or in\nthe Chief Justice of India. Therefore, we clarify that the Chief Justice of\na High Court can delegate the function under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act to a\njudge of that court and he would actually exercise the power of the Chief\nJustice conferred under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. The position would be the\nsame when the Chief Justice of India delegates the power to another judge\nof the Supreme Court and he exercises that power as designated by the Chief\nJustice of India.\n\n42. In this context, it has also to be noticed that there is an ocean of\ndifference between an institution which has no judicial functions and an\nauthority or person who is already exercising judicial power in his\ncapacity as a judicial authority. Therefore, only a judge of the Supreme\nCourt or a judge of the High Court could respectively be equated with the\nChief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court while\nexercising power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act as designated by the Chief\nJustice. A non-judicial body or institution cannot be equated with a Judge\nof the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court and it has to be held\nthat the designation contemplated by\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not a\ndesignation to an institution that is incompetent to perform judicial\nfunctions. Under our dispensation a non-judicial authority cannot exercise\njudicial powers.\n\n43. Once we arrive at the conclusion that the proceeding before the Chief\nJustice while entertaining an application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is\nadjudicatory, then obviously, the outcome of that adjudication is a\njudicial order. Once it is a judicial order, the same, as far as the High\nCourt is concerned would be final and the only avenue open to a party\nfeeling aggrieved by the order of the Chief Justice would be to approach to\nthe Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India. If it\nwere an order by the Chief Justice of India, the party will not have any\nfurther remedy in respect of the matters covered by the order of the Chief\nJustice of India or the Judge of the Page 1822 Supreme Court designated by\nhim and he will have to participate in the arbitration before the Tribunal\nonly on the merits of the claim. Obviously, the dispensation in our\ncountry, does not contemplate any further appeal from the decision of the\nSupreme Court and there appears to be nothing objectionable in taking the\nview that the order of the Chief Justice of India would be final on the\nmatters which are within his purview, while called upon to exercise his\njurisdiction under\nSection 11\nof the Act. It is also necessary to notice in\nthis context that this conclusion of ours would really be in aid of quick\ndisposal of arbitration claims and would avoid considerable delay in the\nprocess, an object that is sought to be achieved by the Act.\n\n44. It is seen that some High Courts have proceeded on the basis that any\norder passed by an arbitral tribunal during arbitration, would be capable\nof being challenged under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the Constitution of India.\nWe see no warrant for such an approach.\nSection 37\nmakes certain orders of\nthe arbitral tribunal appealable. Under\nSection 34\n, the aggrieved party has\nan avenue for ventilating his grievances against the award including any\nin-between orders that might have been passed by the arbitral tribunal\nacting under\nSection 16\nof the Act. The party aggrieved by any order of the\narbitral tribunal, unless has a right of appeal under\nSection 37\nof the\nAct, has to wait until the award is passed by the Tribunal. This appears to\nbe the scheme of the Act. The arbitral tribunal is after all, the creature\nof a contract between the parties, the arbitration agreement, even though\nif the occasion arises, the Chief Justice may constitute it based on the\ncontract between the parties. But that would not alter the status of the\narbitral tribunal. It will still be a forum chosen by the parties by\nagreement. We, therefore, disapprove of the stand adopted by some of the\nHigh Courts that any order passed by the arbitral tribunal is capable of\nbeing corrected by the High Court under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the\nConstitution of India. Such an intervention by the High Courts is not\npermissible.\n\n45. The object of minimizing judicial intervention while the matter is in\nthe process of being arbitrated upon, will certainly be defeated if the\nHigh Court could be approached under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of\nIndia or under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India against every order\nmade by the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, it is necessary to indicate that\nonce the arbitration has commenced in the arbitral tribunal, parties have\nto wait until the award is pronounced unless, of course, a right of appeal\nis available to them under\nSection 37\nof the Act even at an earlier stage.\n\n46. We, therefore, sum up our conclusions as follows:\n\ni) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief\nJustice of India under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not an administrative\npower. It is a judicial power.\n\nii) The power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, in its entirety, could be\ndelegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court only to another judge of\nthat court and by the Chief Justice of India to another judge of the\nSupreme Court.\n\n(iii) In case of designation of a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme\nCourt, the power that is exercised by the designated, judge would be that\nof the Chief Justice as conferred by the statute.\n\n(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will have the right to\ndecide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this\njudgment. These will be, his own jurisdiction, to entertain the request,\nthe existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise\nof a live claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his\npower and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief\nJustice or the judge designated would be entitled to seek the opinion of an\ninstitution in the matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of\n\nSection 11(8)\nof the Act if the need arises but the order appointing the\narbitrator could only be that of the Chief Justice or the judge designate.\n\n(v) Designation of a district judge as the authority under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not warranted on the\nscheme of the Act.\n\n(vi) Once the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or the sole arbitrator,\nthe High Court would not interfere with orders passed by the arbitrator or\nthe arbitral tribunal during the course of the arbitration proceedings and\nthe parties could approach the court only in terms of\nSection 37\nof the Act\nor in terms of\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\n(vii) Since an order passed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or by\nthe designated judge of that court is a judicial order, an appeal will lie\nagainst that order only under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India to\nthe Supreme Court.\n\n(viii) There can be no appeal against an order of the Chief Justice of\nIndia or a judge of the Supreme Court designated by him while entertaining\nan application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n(ix) In a case where an arbitral tribunal has been constituted by the\nparties without having recourse to\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, the arbitral\ntribunal will have the jurisdiction to decide all matters as contemplated\nby\nSection 16\nof the Act.\n\n(x) Since all were guided by the decision of this Court in\nKonkan Railway\nCorporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\nand orders under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act have been made based on the position adopted in\nthat decision, we clarify that appointments of arbitrators or arbitral\ntribunals thus far made, are to be treated as valid, all objections being\nleft to be decided under\nSection 16\nof the Act. As and from this date, the\nposition as adopted in this judgment will govern even pending applications\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n(xi) Where District Judges had been designated by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, the appointment orders thus far\nmade by them will be treated as valid; but applications if any pending Page\n1824 before them as on this date will stand transferred, to be dealt with\nby the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court or a Judge of that court\ndesignated by the Chief Justice.\n\n(xii) The decision in\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani\nConstruction Pvt. Ltd.\nis overruled.\n\n44. The individual appeals will be posted before the appropriate bench for\nbeing disposed of in the light of the principles settled by this decision.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nC.K. Thakker, J.\n\n1. I have had the benefit of going through the judgment prepared by my\nlearned brother P.K. Balasubramanyan ('majority judgment' for short). I,\nhowever, express my inability to agree with the majority judgment on the\nquestion as to the nature of function performed by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court/Chief Justice of India or 'any person or institution designated\nby him' under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996.\n\n2. The concept of arbitration is not unknown to India. In good old days,\ndisputes between private individuals used to be placed before Panchas and\nPanchayats. Likewise, commercial matters were decided by Mahajans and\nChambers. Formal arbitration proceedings, however, came into existence\nafter Britishers started commercial activities in India. The provisions\nrelating to arbitration were found in\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1859\n(Act VIII of 1859) which was repealed by Act X of 1877. A full-fledged law\npertaining to arbitration in India was the Arbitration Act, 1899. A\nconsolidated and amended law relating to arbitration was passed in 1940,\nknown as the\nArbitration Act, 1940\n(Act X 1940).\n\nAs has been said, protracted, time consuming, atrociously expensive and\ncomplex court procedure impelled the commercial-world to an alternative,\nless formal, more effective and speedy mode of resolution of disputes by a\nJudge of choice of the parties which culminated into passing of an\n\nArbitration Act\n. Experience, however, belied expectations. Proceedings\nbecame highly technical and thoroughly complicated. The provisions of the\nAct made 'lawyers laugh and litigants weep'. Representations were made from\nall quarters of the society to amend the law by making it more responsive\nto contemporary requirements. Moreover, apart from arbitration,\nconciliation has been getting momentum and worldwide recognition as an\neffective instrument of settlement of disputes. There was no composite\nstatute dealing with all matters relating to arbitration and conciliation.\n\n3. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)\nadopted a Model Law in 1985 on International Commercial Arbitration. The\nPage 1825 General Assembly of the United Nations recommended member -\nStates to give due consideration to the Model Law to have uniformity in\narbitration procedure which resulted in passing of the\nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n.\nThe Act\nis a complete Code in itself and\nconsolidates and amends the law relating to domestic arbitration,\ninternational commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral\nawards. The Preamble expressly refers to UNCITRAL Model Law on\nInternational Commercial Arbitration and UNCITRAL Conciliation Rules.\n\n4. Over and above 'Preliminary' (\nSection 1\n), the Act is in four parts. Part\nI (\nSections 2\nto\n) deals with Arbitration. Part II (\nSections 44\nto 60)\ncontains provisions relating to Enforcement of Foreign Awards. While Part\nIII (Section 61 to 81) provides for Conciliation, Part IV (Sections 82 to\n\n86) relates to Supplementary Provisions. In these cases, we are mainly\nconcerned with Part I.\nGeneral provisions are found in Chapter I (\nSections 2\nto\n).\nSection 2(b)\n\ndefines 'arbitration agreement' as referred to in\nSection 7\n. 'Arbitral\ntribunal' means a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators -\nSection 2\n\n(d). Clause (h) defines 'party' as a party to arbitration agreement.\n\nSection 5\nrestricts judicial intervention. The said section is material and\nreads thus ;\n\n\"5. Extent of judicial intervention. -Notwithstanding anything contained in\nany other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this\nPart, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in\nthis Part.\"\n\nChapter II deals with 'Arbitration agreement'.\nSection 7\ndeclares that by\nan arbitration agreement, the parties may submit to arbitration all or\ncertain disputes between them. Such agreement must be in writing.\nSection 8\n\nconfers power on a judicial authority to refer the dispute to arbitration\nin certain cases.\nSection 9\nenables the court to make interim orders.\nChapter III provides for composition of Arbitral Tribunal.\nSection 10\n\nallows parties to determine the number of arbitrators but declares that\n'such number shall not be an even number'.\nSection 11\nrelates to\nappointment of arbitrators. It is relevant and material and may be quoted\nin extenso;\n\n\"11. Appointment of arbitrators. - (1) A person of any nationality may be\nan arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n(2) Subject to Sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a\nprocedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators.\n(3) Failing any agreement referred to in Sub-section (2), in an arbitration\nwith three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the\ntwo appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator who shall act\nas the presiding arbitrator.\n\n(4) If the appointment procedure in Sub-section (3) applies and-\n\n(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days from the\nreceipt of a request to do so from the other party; or\n\n(b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator\nwithin thirty days from the date of their appointment; Page 1826 the\nappointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the Chief Justice or\nany person or institution designated by him.\n\n(5) Failing any agreement referred to in Sub-section (2), in an arbitration\nwith a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree the appointment shall\nbe made, upon request of a party, by the Chief Justice or any person or\ninstitution designated by him.\n\n(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties, -\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n(b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an\nagreement expected of them under that procedure; or\n\n(c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function\nentrusted to him or it under that procedure,\na party may request the Chief Justice or any person or institution\ndesignated by him to take the necessary measure, unless the agreement on\nthe appointment procedure provides other means for securing the\nappointment.\n\n(7) A decision on a matter entrusted by Sub-section (4) or Sub-section (5)\nor Sub-section (6) to the Chief Justice or the person or institution\ndesignated by him is final.\n\n(8) The Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by him, in\nappointing an arbitrator, shall have due regard to -\n\n(a) any qualification required for the arbitrator by the agreement of the\nparties, and\n\n(b) other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an\nindependent and impartial arbitrator.\n\n(9) In the case of appointment of sole or third arbitrator in an\ninternational commercial arbitration, the Chief Justice of India or the\nperson or institution designated by him may appoint an arbitrator of a\nnationality other than the nationalities of the parties where the parties\nbelong to different nationalities.\n\n(10) The Chief Justice may make such scheme as he may deem appropriate for\ndealing with matters entrusted by Sub-section (4) or Sub-section (5) or\nSub-section (6) to him.\n\n(11) Where more than one request has been made under Sub-section (4) or\nSub-section (5) or Sub-section (6) to the Chief Justices of different High\nCourts or their designates, the Chief Justice or his designate to whom the\nrequest has been first made under the relevant sub-section shall alone be\ncompetent to decide on the request.\n\n(12)(a) Where the matters referred to in Sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7),\n(8) and (10) arise in an international commercial arbitration the reference\nto \"Chief Justice\" in those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference\nto the \"Chief Justice of India\".\n\n(b) Where the matters referred to in Sub-sections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8)\nand (10) arise in any other arbitration, the reference to \"Chief Justice\"\n\nin those sub-sections shall be construed as a reference to the Chief\nJustice of the Page 1827 High Court within whose local limits the principal\nCivil Court referred to, in Clause (e) of Sub-section (1) of\nSection 2\nis\nsituate and, where the High Court itself is the Court referred to in that\nclause, to the Chief Justice of that High Court.\"\n\nSection 12\nrequires the arbitrator to disclose the disqualification, if\nany. It also permits parties to challenge such arbitrator. Whereas\nSection\nlays down procedure for challenge,\nSections 14\nand\ndeal with special\nsituations.\n\nChapter IV relates to jurisdiction of Arbitral Tribunals.\nSection 16\nis\nanother important provision and confers power on the Arbitral Tribunal to\nrule on its own jurisdiction. It reads thus ;\n\n\"16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.-(1) The\narbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any\nobjections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration\nagreement, and for that purpose. -\n\n(a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated\nas an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and\n\n(b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void\nshall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the submission clause.\n(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be\nraised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; however,\na party shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because that\nhe has appointed, or participated in the appointment of an arbitrator.\n(3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its\nauthority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the\nscope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.\n(4) The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in Sub-\n\nsection (2) or Sub-section (3) admit a later plea if it considers the delay\njustified.\n\n(5) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to in Sub-section\n(2) or Sub-section (3) and, where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision\nrejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an\narbitral award.\n\n(6) A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application for\nsetting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with\nSection 34\n.\"\nChapters V and VI relate to 'Conduct of Arbitral Proceedings' and 'Making\nof Arbitral Award and Termination of Proceedings'. Chapters VII, VIII and\nIX provide for 'Recourse Against Arbitral Award', 'Finality and Enforcement\nof Arbitral Awards' and 'Appeals' respectively. Chapter X covers\n'Miscellaneous' matters.\n\n5. The controversy in the present group of matters centres round\ninterpretation of\nSection 11\nand the nature of function performed by the\nChief Justice under Sub-section (6) thereof. According to one view, it is\nadministrative, while according to the other view, it is judicial or quasi-\njudicial.\n\n6. I have already quoted\nSection 11\n. It provides for appointment of\narbitrators. Sub-sections (1) to (3) which confer power on parties to\narbitration agreement to appoint arbitrators present no difficulty. Sub-\nsections (4) to (6) deal with cases where there is failure by the parties\nto appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or default by two arbitrators in\nappointing the third arbitrator.\nThe Act\nin such eventuality empowers the\nChief Justice or any person or institution designated by him to take\nnecessary steps for securing the appointment. Sub-section (7) of\nSection 11\n\nmakes the 'decision' of the Chief Justice 'final'. Sub-section (8) requires\nthe Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by him in\nappointing an arbitrator to have due regard to qualifications required of\nthe arbitrator by the agreement of the parties as also other considerations\nas are likely to secure the appointment of independent and impartial\narbitrator. Sub-section (10) enables the Chief Justice to frame a scheme\ndealing with matters entrusted to him by Sub-sections (4) to (6).\n\nSection 11\ncame to be interpreted by this Court in few cases.\nIn\nSundaram\nFinance Ltd. v. NEPC India Ltd.\n, a two Judge Bench was called upon to\nconsider whether under\nSection 9\nof the Act, the 'court' had jurisdiction\nto pass interim orders before arbitral proceedings commenced and before an\narbitrator was appointed. Considering the scope of the said provision, this\nCourt held that the 'court' had no jurisdiction to entertain application\nunder\nSection 9\nbefore initiation of arbitration proceedings.\n\n7. The Court, however, taking note of UNCITRAL Model Law, observed:\n\n\"Under the 1996 Act, appointment of Arbitrator(s) is made as per the\nprovision of\nSection 11\nwhich does not require the Court to pass a judicial\norder appointing Arbitrator(s)\".\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nIt is, no doubt, true that the question about nature of function to be\nperformed by the Chief Justice under\nSection 11\ndid not strictly arise\nin\nthat case\nand, hence, the above observation could not be termed as 'ratio'.\nAs I will presently show, in a subsequent case, it was submitted that the\nstatement was in the nature of 'passing observation' or 'obiter'.\n\n8.\nIn\nAdor Sami Private Ltd. v. Peekay Holdings Ltd. and Ors.\n, a direct\nquestion arose before a two-Judge Bench. There, an order passed by the\nChief Justice under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act was challenged\nin this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. The question before\nthe Court was whether a special leave petition was maintainable.\nReproducing the observation in Sundaram Finance Ltd., the Court held that\nPage 1829 the order passed by the Chief Justice under\nSection 11\nof the Act\nwas administrative in nature.\n\nReferring to a decision of the Constitution\nBench in\nIndo-China Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Jasjit Singh, Additional\nCollector of Customs and Ors.\n, , the Court observed that it is well settled\nthat a petition under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution would lie against an\norder made by a Court or Tribunal. Since the Chief Justice or his designate\nacts under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act in administrative capacity, the order\ncould not be said to have been passed by a court or by a tribunal having\ntrappings of a court. Special leave petition was hence held not\nmaintainable.\n\nIn\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v. Mehul Construction Co. (Konkan\nRailway Corporation Ltd. I\n), the point was again considered by a three-\nJudge Bench. It was observed that an important question had arisen for\nconsideration of the Court as to the nature of the order passed by the\nChief Justice under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act and the remedy available to\nthe aggrieved party against such order. Referring to Sundaram Finance Ltd.\nand Ador Samia Private Ltd., the Court held that the function performed by\nthe Chief Justice was essentially to aid the constitution of Arbitral\nTribunal. The Legislature had consciously chosen to confer the power on the\n'Chief Justice' and not on the 'Court'. The order passed by the Chief\nJustice or his nominee was administrative order. The Court considered\nUNCITRAL Model Law of International Commercial Arbitration, the old Act of\n1940 and the relevant provisions of 1996 Act and observed that the sole\nobjective was to resolve disputes as expeditiously as possible so that\ntrade and commerce are not adversely affected on account of litigation. The\nStatement of Objects and Reasons of the Act clearly enunciated the object\nof the legislation that it was intended to minimize the supervisory role of\nthe court in arbitral process.\n\nAccording to the Court, when the matter is placed before the Chief Justice\nor his nominee under\nSection 11\nof the Act, it is imperative for the Chief\nJustice or his nominee to bear in mind the legislative intent. The Chief\nJustice or his nominee is not expected to entertain contentious issues\nbetween the parties and decide them.\nSection 16\nof the Act empowers the\nArbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Combined reading of\n\nSections 11\nand\nmake it crystal clear that questions as to\nqualifications, independence and impartiality of Arbitral Tribunal as also\nof the jurisdiction of the tribunal can be raised before the arbitrator who\nwill decide them. The function of the Chief Justice or his nominee is just\nto appoint an arbitrator without wasting time. The nature of the function\nto be performed by the Chief Justice is essentially to aid the constitution\nof the tribunal and is administrative. If the function is held to be\njudicial or quasi-judicial, the order passed by the Chief Justice or his\nnominee would be amenable to judicial intervention and a Page 1830\nreluctant litigant would attempt to frustrate the object of the Act by\nadopting dilatory tactics by approaching a court of law against an\nappointment of arbitrator. Such an interpretation should be avoided to\nachieve the basic objective for which the Act has been enacted.\n\nIn\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. (Konkan\nRailway Corporation Ltd. II\n), a similar question had come for\nconsideration before a two-Judge Bench. The attention of the Court was\ninvited to earlier decisions including a three-Judge Bench decision in\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. I. It was, however, argued by the learned\nSolicitor General that once a contention is raised that the matter cannot\nbe referred to arbitration, the issue has to be decided by the Chief\nJustice or his nominee and such an order cannot be characterized as\nadministrative. When the attention of the learned Solicitor General was\ninvited to Sundarm Finance Ltd., submitted that the question about nature\nof the order under\nSection 11\nwas never raised before the Court and the\nobservation that the order passed by the Chief Justice or his nominee under\n\nSection 11\nwas administrative was merely 'passing observation' or 'obiter'.\nIn Ador Samia, special leave petition under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution\nwas dismissed merely relying upon observation in Sundaram Finance Ltd. It\nwas no doubt true that in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd.I, a three-Judge\nBench held that an order passed under\nSection 11\nof the Act by the Chief\nJustice or his nominee was administrative in nature but it required\nreconsideration in view of several factors. It was submitted that the Act\ndid not take away the power of the court to decide preliminary issues; the\nChief Justice or his nominee was bound to consider whether there was an\narbitration agreement, or whether an arbitration clause existed or the\nmatters were 'excepted matters'. Again, if the order of the Chief Justice\nor his nominee would be treated as administrative, it could be challenged\nbefore a High Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, then before a\nDivision Bench in Letters Patent Appeal/Intra-court Appeal and then before\nthe Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution which would further\ndelay arbitration proceedings.\nIt was, therefore, necessary to reconsider\nthe law laid down in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. I.\n\n9. In view of the contentions raised before a two-Judge Bench, an order was\npassed directing the Registry to place the papers before Hon. the Chief\nJustice for passing appropriate orders. Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. I\nwas thus placed before a Constitution Bench of five Judges. The\nConstitution Bench, Page 1831 considered the relevant provisions of the Act\nand the scheme framed by the Chief Justice of India known as \"The\nAppointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996\".\nDiscussing the Statement of Objects and Reasons and considering the\nrelevant provisions of the Act, the Court held that the only function the\nChief Justice or his designate was required to perform was to fill the gap\nleft by a party to the arbitration agreement or two arbitrators appointed\nby the parties and nominate an arbitrator or umpire so that Arbitral\nTribunal is expeditiously constituted and arbitration proceedings\ncommenced. According to the Constitution Bench, the order passed by the\nChief Justice or his designate under\nSection 11\nnominating an arbitrator\ncould not be said to be 'adjudicatory order' and the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate could not be described as 'Tribunal'. Such an order, therefore,\ncould not be challenged under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. The decision\nof three-Judge Bench in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. I was thus\naffirmed.\n\nThe Court observed:\n\n\"\nSection 11\nof the Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators. It\nprovides that the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing\nan arbitrator or arbitrators. In the event of there being no agreement in\nregard to such procedure, in an arbitration by three arbitrators each party\nis required to appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed\nmust appoint the third arbitrator. If a party fails to appoint an\narbitrator within thirty days from the request to do so by the other party\nor the two arbitrators appointed by the parties fail to agree on a third\narbitrator within thirty days of their appointment, a party may request the\nChief Justice to nominate an arbitrator and the nomination shall be made by\nthe Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him. If the\nparties have not agreed on a procedure for appointing an arbitrator in an\narbitration with a sole arbitrator and the parties fail to agree on an\narbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request to one party by the\nother party, the nomination shall be made on the request of a party by the\nChief Justice or his designate. Where an appointment procedure has been\nagreed upon by the parties but a party fails to act as required by that\nprocedure or the parties, or the two arbitrators appointed by them, fail to\nreach the agreement expected of them under that procedure or a person or\ninstitution fails to perform the function entrusted to him or it under that\nprocedure, a party may request the Chief Justice or his designate to\nnominate an arbitrator, unless the appointment procedure provides other\nmeans in this behalf. The decision of the Chief Justice or his designate is\nfinal. In nominating an arbitrator the Chief Justice or his designate must\nhave regard to the qualifications required of the arbitrator in the\nagreement between the parties and to other considerations that will secure\nthe nomination of an independent and impartial arbitrator.\nThere is nothing in\nSection 11\nthat requires the party other than the party\nmaking the request to be noticed. It does not contemplate a response from\nthat other party. It does not contemplate a decision by the Chief Justice\nor his designate on any controversy that the other party may raise, even in\nPage 1832 regard to its failure to appoint an arbitrator within the period\nof thirty days. That the Chief Justice or his designate has to make the\nnomination of an arbitrator only if the period of thirty days is over does\nnot lead to the conclusion that the decision to nominate is adjudicatory.\nIn its request to the Chief Justice to make the appointment the party would\naver that this period has passed and, ordinarily, correspondence between\nthe parties would be annexed to bear this out. This is all that the Chief\nJustice or his designate has to see. That the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate has to take into account the qualifications required of the\narbitrator by the agreement between the parties (which, ordinarily, would\nalso be annexed to the request) and other considerations likely to secure\nthe nomination of an independent and impartial arbitrator also cannot lead\nto the conclusion that the Chief Justice or his designate is required to\nperform an adjudicatory function. That the word 'decision' is used in the\nmatter of the request by a party to nominate an arbitrator does not of\nitself mean that an adjudicatory decision is contemplated.\nAs we see it, the only function of the Chief Justice or his designate under\n\nSection 11\nis to fill the gap left by a party to the arbitration agreement\nor by the two arbitrators appointed by the parties and nominate an\narbitrator. This is to enable the arbitral tribunal to be expeditiously\nconstituted and the arbitration proceedings to commence. The function has\nbeen left to the Chief Justice or his designate advisedly, with a view to\nensure that the nomination of the arbitrator is made by a person occupying\nhigh judicial office or his designate, who would take due care to see that\na competent, independent and impartial arbitrator is nominated.\nIt might be that though the Chief Justice or his designate might have taken\nall due care to nominate an independent and impartial arbitrator, a party\nin a given case may have justifiable doubts about that arbitrator's\nindependence or impartiality. In that event it would be open to that party\nto challenge the arbitrator under\nSection 12\n, adopting the procedure under\n\nSection 13\n. There is no reason whatever to conclude that the grounds for\nchallenge under\nSection 13\nare not available only because the arbitrator\nhas been nominated by the Chief Justice or his designate under\nSection 11\n.\nIt might also be that in a given case the Chief Justice or his designate\nmay have nominated an arbitrator although the period of thirty days had not\nexpired. If so, the arbitral tribunal would have been improperly\nconstituted and be without jurisdiction. It would then be open to the\naggrieved party to require the arbitral tribunal to rule on its\njurisdiction.\nSection 16\nprovides for this. It states that the arbitral\ntribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction. That the arbitral tribunal may\nrule \"on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the\narbitration agreement\" shows that the arbitral tribunal's authority under\n\nSection 16\nis not confined to the width of its jurisdiction, as was\nsubmitted by learned Counsel for the appellants, but goes to the very root\nof its jurisdiction. There would, therefore, be no impediment in contending\nbefore the arbitral tribunal that it had been wrongly constituted by reason\nof the fact that the Chief Justice or his designate had nominated an\narbitrator although the period of thirty days had not expired and that,\ntherefore, it had no jurisdiction.\"\n\nRegarding the scheme, the Court observed that such scheme could not govern\nthe Act. Since\nSection 11\ndid not contain any element of 'adjudication' and\nthe function of the Chief Justice or his designate was purely\nadministrative, there was no question of issuing notice to affected persons\nor to afford opportunity of hearing. The scheme, however, contained Clause\n7 (Notice to affected persons) and expressly provided for issuance of\nnotice to persons likely to be affected thereby. It thus went 'beyond terms\nof\nSection 11\n' and was, therefore, bad.\n\nThe Court, in this connection, observed ;\n\n\"The schemes made by the Chief Justices under\nSection 11\ncannot govern the\ninterpretation of\nSection 11\n. If the schemes, as drawn, go beyond the terms\nof\nSection 11\nthey are bad and have to be amended. To the extent that The\nAppointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996, goes\nbeyond\nSection 11\nby requiring, in Clause 7, the service of a notice upon\nthe other party to the arbitration agreement to show cause why the\nnomination of an arbitrator, as requested, should not be made, it is bad\nand must be amended. The other party needs to be given notice of the\nrequest only so that it may know of it and it may, if it so chooses, assist\nthe Chief Justice or his designate in the nomination of an arbitrator.\"\n\nThe point was thus concluded by a Constitution Bench of five Judges wherein\nit was held that the function performed by the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate was administrative and did not contain any adjudicatory process.\nThe order passed by the Chief Justice or his designate could not be\nchallenged before this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution.\n\n10. In the light of the above legal position, when these matters were\nplaced\nbefore a Constitution Bench of five Judges on July 19, 2005, the following\norder was passed :\n\n\"After hearing the learned Counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion\nthat the cases may call for re-consideration of the decision of this Court\nin\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.\n,\n, in particular the view taken in paras 18 to 21 thereof, which is by a\nConstitution Bench.\n\nBe placed before a seven-Judge Bench.\"\n\n11. That is how, the matters have been placed before us.\n\nWe have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at considerable length.\nIt was urged by Mr. Venugopal, Senior Advocate that when the Chief Justice\nis requested to make an appointment of an arbitrator under Sub-section (6)\nof\nSection 11\nof the Act, the Chief Justice must apply his mind and satisfy\nhimself about the fulfillment of conditions for the exercise of power for\nappointment of an arbitrator. The Chief Justice for that purpose, is bound\nto Page 1834 decide certain preliminary or 'jurisdictional' facts before\ntaking a decision of appointment of arbitrator. He must be convinced that\nthere is an 'arbitration agreement' under\nSection 7\nof the Act, the other\nparty has refused to make an appointment, or parties or two arbitrators\nhave failed to reach an agreement or a person or institution has failed to\nperform the function entrusted to him or it. Moreover, the Chief Justice in\nappointing an arbitrator 'shall have regard to' qualifications,\nindependence and impartiality of the arbitrator. The Chief Justice, after\nconsidering all those factors will come to a conclusion whether the\nprovisions of law have been complied with and only then he may make such\norder. The issues arise before the Chief Justice are thus contentious\nissues and require adjudication. Such adjudication affects rights of\nparties. The 'duty to act judicially' is, therefore, implicit and the\ndecision is judicial or quasi-judicial.\n\nI am unable to uphold the argument. In my view, it is based on the\nmisconception that wherever a statute requires certain matters to be taken\ninto account and the authority is obliged to apply its mind to those\nconsiderations, the action, decision or adjudication must be held judicial\nor quasi-judicial. With respect, this is not the legal position.\n\n12. It is settled law that in several cases, an appropriate authority may\nhave to consider the circumstances\nlaid down in\nthe Act, apply its mind and\nthen to take a decision. Such decision may affect one or the other party\nand may have far reaching consequences. But from that it cannot be\nconcluded that the decision is judicial or quasi-judicial and not\nadministrative.\n\nBefore more than fifty years, in\nState of Madras v. C.P. Sarthy\n, the\nConstitution Bench of this Court, while interpreting the provisions of\n\nSection 10\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 held that the action of the\nGovernment of referring or refusing to refer the matter for an adjudication\nto Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal is administrative.\nThe Court stated:\n\nThis is, however, not to say that the Government will be justified in\nmaking a reference under\nSection 10(1)\nwithout satisfying itself on the\nfacts and circumstances brought to its notice that an industrial dispute\nexists or is apprehended in relation to an establishment or a definite\ngroup of establishments engaged in a particular industry. It is also\ndesirable that the Government should, wherever possible, indicate the\nnature of the dispute in the order of reference. But it must be remembered\nthat in making a reference under\nSection 10(1)\nthe Government is doing an\nadministrative act and the fact that it has to form an opinion as to the\nfactual existence of an industrial dispute as a preliminary step to the\ndischarge of its function does not make it any the less administrative in\ncharacter. The Court cannot, therefore, canvass the order of reference\nclosely to see if there was any material before the Government to support\nits conclusion, as if it was a judicial or quasi-judicial determination. No\ndoubt, it will be open to a party seeking to impugn the resulting award to\nshow that what was referred Page 1835 by the Government was not an\nindustrial dispute within the meaning of the Act, and that, therefore, the\nTribunal had no jurisdiction to make the award. But, if the dispute was an\nindustrial dispute as defined in the Act, its factual existence and the\nexpediency of making a reference in the circumstances of a particular case\nare matters entirely for the Government to decide upon, and it will not be\ncompetent for the Court to hold the reference bad and quash the proceedings\nfor want of jurisdiction merely because there was, in its opinion, no\nmaterial before the Government on which it could have come to an\naffirmative conclusion on those matters.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n13. Now, it cannot be disputed that the action of the Government (of\nreferring the dispute or refusing to refer it) certainly affects one party\nor the other. Still an action which is otherwise administrative in nature\ndoes not change its character and remains as it is irrespective of the\nconsequences likely to ensue or the effect of decision on parties to such\ndispute. [See also\nPrem Kakar v. State of Haryana\n,\nSultan Singh v. State of\nHaryana\n,\nSecretary Indian Tea Association v. Ajit Kumar Barat,]\nSeveral\nsimilar actions having far reaching consequences have been held\nadministrative, for instance, an order of acquisition or requisition of\nproperty; an order making an appointment to a civil post, an order granting\nsanction to prosecute a public servant; etc.\nIt cannot be gainsaid that there must be an 'arbitration agreement' between\nthe parties. It also cannot be denied that there must be default or failure\non the part of one party to appoint an arbitrator. But that will not make\nthe function performed by the Chief Justice as judicial or quasi-judicial.\nChapter II (Arbitration Agreement) precedes Chapter III (Composition of\nArbitral Tribunal). Therefore, when the question as to composition of\nArbitral Tribunal and appointment of an arbitrator comes up for\nconsideration, it can safely be assumed that there is an arbitration\nagreement, inasmuch as it is in consonance with the legislative scheme and\nthe question as to the appointment of arbitrator arises only in view of\nsuch agreement. Moreover, before exercising the power to appoint an\narbitrator, the Chief Justice must peruse the relevant record relating to\nan agreement and failure by one party in making an appointment which would\nenable him to act. There is, however, no doubt in my mind that at that\nstage, the satisfaction required is merely of prima facie nature and the\nChief Justice does not decide lis nor contentious issues between the\nparties.\nSection 11\nneither contemplates detailed inquiry, nor trial nor\nfindings on controversial or contested matters.\n\n14. The Law Commission, in 176th Report on Arbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Bill, 2001, after referring to the relevant Rules and legal\nopinion, stated:\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that the ICC Rules and the opinion of jurists\nsupport the view that at the stage of\nSection 11\n, it is permissible to\ndecide preliminary issues. There are considerable advantages if such issues\nare decided at that stage, inasmuch as a decision at that stage saves time\nand expense for the parties. As pointed out by Fouchard and others, there\nis no question of an 'automatic appointment' of arbitrators, whenever an\napplication is made for an appointment of arbitrators. The appointing\nauthority normally considers if a case is made out for appointment of\narbitrators and such a decision can be taken on undisputed facts available\nat that stage.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n15. As Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration\n(1994 edn.); (para 854) pithily put it; \"the Court should only verity that\nthe clause is not patently void, as it would be unreasonable to require it\nto appoint an arbitrator where there is no indication that an arbitration\nclause exists. The Court should not be seen to automatically appoint\narbitrators in cases where the arbitration clearly has no contractual basis\nand the award has no chance of being recognized in any jurisdiction\".\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n16. At the stage of exercising powers under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\n,\nthe Chief Justice is bound to apply his mind to allegations and counter-\nallegations of the parties and will form an opinion on the available\nmaterial. Thus, in\nWellington Associates Ltd. v. Kirit Mehta\n, at the stage\nof\nSection 11\n, it was argued that the relevant clause relied upon by the\napplicant was not an 'arbitration clause'. It merely permitted parties to\nagree, in future, to go to arbitration.\n\nUpholding the objection, the Court observed that the clause was not an\narbitration clause and the application was not maintainable. It held that\n\nSection 16\ndid not take away the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice to\ndecide the question of 'existence' of the arbitration agreement. The said\nsection did not declare that except the Arbitral Tribunal, none else could\ndetermine such question. \"Merely because the new Act permits the arbitrator\nto decide this question, it does not necessarily follow that at the stage\nof\nSection 11\n, the Chief Justice of India or his designate cannot decide\nthe question as to the existence of the arbitration clause.\" [See also\n\nMalaysian Airlines System v. Stic Travels (P) Ltd.\n, (2001) 1 SCC 509;\n\nNimeet Resources INC v. Essar Steels Ltd.\n; (2000) SCC 497;\nShin Etsu\nChemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd. and Anr.\n].\n\nPage 1837\n\n17. It was then argued that Sub-section (7) of\nSection 11\nempowers the\nChief Justice to decide the question and uses the expression 'decision'\nwhich is significant. Whenever a statute confers power on an authority to\npass an order or to take a decision, it must be held that the function is\njudicial or quasi-judicial and duty to act judicially must be inferred.\nEven this contention is not well founded. Sub-section (7), no doubt, uses\nthe term 'decision'. But as I have already observed earlier, the Chief\nJustice forms prima facie opinion as to the fulfillment of conditions\nspecified in Sub-section (6). The decision neither contemplates\nadjudication of lis between two or more parties nor resolves controversial\nand contentious issues. It merely requires the Chief Justice to take an\nappropriate action keeping in view the provisions of Part II and Sub-\nsections (1), (4) and (5) of\nSection 11\n. Regarding matters which the Chief\nJustice is expected to consider, such as qualification, independence and\nimpartiality of arbitrator, they are statutory provisions and the Chief\nJustice is obliged to keep them in view as per mandate of the Legislature.\nThe said fact, however, does not make the function of the Chief Justice\njudicial or quasi-judicial.\n\n18. It was also submitted that there is an important provision which cannot\nbe lost sight of and it is the finality of decision rendered by the Chief\nJustice. Sub-section (7) expressly declares that the decision of the Chief\nJustice under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nis 'final'. It was submitted\nthat in view of finality attached to the order passed by the Chief Justice,\nthe order passed by him cannot be made subject-matter of dispute under the\nAct and all provisions, including\nSection 16\nmust be read in conformity\nwith 'finality clause'. For that reason also, the action must be held\njudicial or quasi-judicial.\n\n19. As to the ambit and scope of\nSection 16\n, I will refer to little later,\nbut in my view, finality of an order has nothing to do with the nature of\nfunction to be performed by the Chief Justice. Several statutes declare an\norder passed, decision taken or declaration made by the competent authority\n'final' or 'final and conclusive' or 'final and conclusive and is not open\nto challenge in any court'. This is known as 'statutory finality' and such\nclauses require to be interpreted in juxta-position of constitutional\nprovisions. As a general rule, no appeal, revision or review lies against\nan order which has been treated by a statute as 'final'. It may not be\nchallenged by instituting a civil suit in certain cases. But such finality\ncannot take away the jurisdiction of High Courts or the Supreme Court and\njudicial review is available against 'final' orders albeit on limited\ngrounds. [Vide Somvanti v. State of Punjab;\nNeelima Misra v. Harvinder Kaur\nPaintal and Ors\n.]\n\n20. But there is another important reason why the function of the Chief\nJustice under\nSection 11\nshould be considered administrative. All the three\nSub-sections, (4), (5) and (6) of the said section empower the Chief\nJustice or 'any person or institution designated by him' to exercise the\npower of the Chief Page 1838 Justice. No provision similar to the one in\nhand was present in 1940 Act. Parliament, therefore, has consciously and\nintentionally made the present arrangement for the first time allowing\nexercise of the power by the Chief Justice himself or through 'any person\nor institution designated by him', since the function is administrative in\ncharacter and is required to be performed on prima facie satisfaction under\nSub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\n21. Now, let us consider\nSection 16\nof the Act. This section is new and did\nnot find place in the old Act of 1940. Sub-section (1) of that section\nenables the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. It further\nprovides that the jurisdiction of the tribunal includes ruling on any\nobjections with respect to existence or validity of the arbitration\nagreement. Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) lay down procedure of raising plea\nas to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and entertaining such plea.\nSub-section (5) mandates that the Arbitral Tribunal 'shall decide' such\nplea and, 'where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision rejecting the plea,\ncontinue with the arbitration proceedings and make an arbitral award'. Sub-\nsection (6) is equally important and expressly enacts that a party\naggrieved by arbitral award may invoke\nSection 34\nof the Act for setting\naside such award. The provision appears to have been made to prevent\ndilatory tactics and abuse of immediate right to approach the court. If an\naggrieved party has right to move the court, it would not have been\npossible to preclude the court from granting stay or interim relief which\nwould bring the arbitration proceedings to a grinding halt. The provisions\nof\nSection 16 (6)\nread with\nSection 5\nnow make the legal position clear,\nunambiguous and free from doubt.\n\n22.\nSection 16 (1)\nincorporates the well-known doctrine of Kompetenz -\nKompetenz or competence de la competence. It recognizes and enshrines an\nimportant principle that initially and primarily, it is for the Arbitral\nTribunal itself to determine whether it has jurisdiction in the matter,\nsubject of course, to ultimate court-control. It is thus a rule of\nchronological priority. Kompetenz -Kompetenz is a widely accepted feature\nof modern international arbitration, and allows the Arbitral Tribunal to\ndecide its own jurisdiction including ruling on any objections with respect\nto the existence or validity of the arbitration-agreement, subject to final\nreview by a competent court of law; i.e. subject to\nSection 34\nof the Act.\n\n23. Chitty on Contract (1999 edn.; p. 802) explains the principle thus:\n\nEnglish law has always taken the view that the arbitral tribunal cannot be\nthe final adjudication of its own jurisdiction. The final decision as per\nthe substantive jurisdiction of the tribunal rests with the Court. However,\nthere is no reason why the tribunal should not have the power, subject to\nreview by the Court, to rule on its own jurisdiction. Indeed such a power\n(often referred to as the principle of \"Kompetenz - Kompetenz\" has been\ngenerally recognized in other legal systems. It had also been recognized by\nEnglish Law before the 1986 Act, but\nSection 30\nof the Act put this on a\nstatutory basis. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral\ntribunal Page 1839 may rule on its substantive jurisdiction that is, as to\n\n(a) whether there is valid arbitration agreement; (b) whether the tribunal\nis properly constituted; and (c) what matters have been submitted to\narbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement. Any such ruling\nmay be challenged by any arbitral process of appeal or review or in\naccordance with the provisions of\nPart I of the Act\n, notably by an\napplication under\nSection 32\nor by a challenge to the award under Section\n\n67. (emphasis supplied) Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter in their work on\n\"Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration\", (4th edn.),\n(para 5-34) also said:\n\nWhen any question is raised as to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral\nTribunal, a two stage procedure is followed. At the first stage, if one of\nthe parties raises 'one or more pleas concerning the existence, validity or\nscope of the agreement to arbitrate', the ICC's Court must satisfy itself\nof the prima facie existence of such an agreement [ICC Arbitration Rules\n6(2)]. If it is satisfied that such an agreement exists, the ICC's Court\nmust allow the arbitration to proceed so that, at the second stage, any\ndecision as to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be taken by\nthe Arbitral Tribunal itself.\n\n24. To cite Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman again:\n\n658. - More fundamentally, although the arbitrators' jurisdiction to rule\non their own jurisdiction is indeed one of the effects of the arbitration\nagreement (or even of a prima facie arbitration agreement, since the\nquestion would not arise in the absence of a prima facie arbitration\nagreement), the basis of that power is neither the arbitration agreement\nitself, nor the principle of pacta sunt servanda under which the\narbitration agreement is Binding.\n\nThe competence-competence principle enables the arbitral tribunal to\ncontinue with the proceedings even where the existence or validity of the\narbitration agreement has been challenged by one of the parties for reasons\ndirectly affecting the arbitration agreement, and not simply on the basis\nof allegations that the main contract is void or otherwise ineffective. The\nprinciple that the arbitration agreement is autonomous of the main contract\nis sufficient to resist a claim that the arbitration agreement is void\nbecause the contract containing it is invalid, but it does not enable the\narbitrators to proceed with the arbitration where the alleged invalidity\ndirectly concerns the arbitration agreement. That is a consequence of the\ncompetence-competence principle alone. The competence-competence principle\nalso allows arbitrators to determine that an arbitration agreement is\ninvalid and to make an award declaring that they lack jurisdiction without\ncontradicting themselves.\n\nOf course, neither of those effects results from the arbitration agreement.\nIf that were the case, one would immediately be confronted with the\n\"vicious circle\" argument put forward by authors opposed to the competence-\ncompetence principle: how can an arbitrator, solely on the basis of an\narbitration agreement, declare that agreement to be void or even hear a\nclaim to that effect? The answer is simple: the basis for the competence-\ncompetence Page 1840 principle lies not in the arbitration agreement, but\nin the arbitration laws of the country where the arbitration is held and,\nmore generally, in the laws of all countries liable to recognize an award\nmade by arbitrators concerning their own jurisdiction. For example, an\ninternational arbitral tribunal sitting in France can properly make an\naward declaring that it lacks jurisdiction for want of a valid arbitration\nagreement, because it does so on the basis of French arbitration law, and\nnot on the basis of the arbitration agreement held to be non-existent or\ninvalid. Similarly, it is perfectly logical for the interested party to\nrely on that award in other jurisdictions, provided that those other\njurisdictions also recognize the competence-competence principle. As we\nshall now see, the legal basis for the principle does not prejudice the\nsubsequent review by the courts, in France or in the country where\nrecognition is sought, of the arbitrators' finding that the arbitration\nagreement is non-existent or invalid.\n\n659. - Even today, the competence-competence principle is all too often\ninterpreted as empowering the arbitrators to be the sole judges of their\njurisdiction. That would be neither logical nor acceptable. In fact, the\nreal purpose of the rule is in no way to leave the question of the\narbitrators' jurisdiction in the hands of the arbitrators alone. Their\njurisdiction must instead be reviewed by the courts if an action is brought\nto set aside or to enforce the award. Nevertheless, the competence-\ncompetence rule ties in with the idea that there are no grounds for the\nprima facie suspicion that the arbitrators themselves will not be able to\nreach decisions which are fair and protect the interests of society as well\nas those of the parties to the dispute. This same philosophy is also found\nin the context of arbitrability, where it serves as the basis for the case\nlaw which entrusts arbitrators with the task of applying rules of public\npolicy (in areas such as antitrust law and the prevention of corruption),\nsubject to subsequent review by the courts.\n\n660. - However, it is important to recognize that the competence-competence\nrule has a dual function. Like the arbitration agreement, it has or may\nhave both positive and negative effects, even if the latter have not yet\nbeen fully accepted in a number of jurisdictions. The positive effect of\nthe competence-competence principle is to enable the arbitrators to rule on\ntheir own jurisdiction, as is widely recognized by international\nconventions and by recent statutes on international arbitration. However,\nthe negative effect is equally important. It is to allow the arbitrators to\nbe not the sole judges, but the first judges of their jurisdiction. In\nother words, it is to allow them to come to a decision on their\njurisdiction prior to any court or other judicial authority, and thereby to\nlimit the role of the courts to the review of the award. The principle of\ncompetence-competence thus obliges any court hearing a claim concerning the\njurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal - regarding, for example, the\nconstitution of the tribunal or the validity of the arbitration agreement -\nto refrain from hearing substantive argument as to the arbitrators'\njurisdiction until such time as the arbitrators themselves have had the\nopportunity to do so. In that sense, the competence-competence principle is\na rule of chronological priority. Taking both of its facets into account,\nthe competence-competence principle can be defined as the rule whereby\narbitrators must have the first Page 1841 opportunity to hear challenges\nrelating to their jurisdiction, subject to subsequent review by the courts.\nFrom a practical standpoint, the rule is intended to ensure that a party\ncannot succeed in delaying the arbitral proceedings by alleging that the\narbitration agreement is invalid or non-existent. Such delay is avoided by\nallowing the arbitrators to rule on this issue themselves, subject to\nsubsequent review by the courts, and by inviting the courts to refrain from\nintervening until the award has been made. Nevertheless, the interests of\nparties with legitimate claims concerning the invalidity of the arbitration\nagreement are not unduly prejudiced, because they will be able to bring\nthose claims before the arbitrators themselves and, should the arbitrators\nchoose to reject them, before the courts thereafter.\n\nThe competence-competence rule thus concerns not only the positive, but\nalso the negative effects of the arbitration agreement.\n\n25.\nIn\nRenusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. and Anr.\n,\nconsidering the relevant provisions of the\nForeign Awards (Recognition and\nEnforcement) Act, 1961\n, this Court held that the arbitrator or umpire is\ncompetent to provisionally decide his own jurisdiction, if the arbitration\nagreement so provides, however, subject to final determination by a\ncompetent court.\n\nThe Court stated:\n\n\"As explained earlier the scheme that emerges on a combined reading of\nSections 3 and 7 of the Foreign Awards Act clearly contemplates that\nquestions of existence, validity or effect (scope) of the arbitration\nagreement itself, in cases where such agreement is wide enough to include\nwithin its ambit such questions, may be decided by the arbitrators\ninitially but their determination is subject to the decision of the Court\nand such decision of the Court can be had either before the arbitration\nproceedings commence or during their pendency, if the matter is decided in\na\nSection 3\npetition or can be had under\nSection 7\nafter the award is mane\nand filed in the Court and is sought to be enforce by a party thereto. In\nthe face of such schemes envisaged by the Foreign Awards Act which governs\nthis case it will be difficult to accept the contention that the\narbitrators will have no jurisdiction to decide questions regarding the\nexistence, validity or effect (scope) of the arbitration agreement. In fact\nthe scheme makes for avoidance of dilatory tactics on the part of any party\nto such agreement by merely raising a plea of lack of arbitrator's\ncompetence -and a frivolous plea at that - and enables the arbitrator to\ndetermine the plea one way or the other and if negatived to proceed to make\nhis award with the further safeguard that the Court would be in a position\nto entertain and decide the same plea finally when the award is sought to\nbe enforced.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIn the instant case, according to the majority,\nSection 16(1)\nonly makes\nexplicit what is even otherwise implicit, namely, that the tribunal has the\njurisdiction to rule its own jurisdiction, 'including ruling on any\nobjections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration\nagreement.'\nSo far, so good and I am in respectful agreement with these observations.\nThe matter, however, does not rest there. Over and above Sub-section (1),\n\nSection 16\ncontains other sub-sections and in particular, Sub-sections (5)\nand (6). The former requires the tribunal to continue the proceedings in\ncase it decides that the tribunal has jurisdiction in the matter and the\nlatter provides remedy to the aggrieved party.\n\n26. In my opinion, conjoint reading of Sub-sections (1), (4), (5) and (6)\nmakes it abundantly clear that the provision is 'self-contained' and deals\nwith all cases, even those wherein the plea as to want of jurisdiction has\nbeen rejected. As a general rule, such orders are subject to certiorari\njurisdiction since a court of limited jurisdiction or an inferior tribunal\nby wrongly interpreting a statutory provision cannot invest itself with the\njurisdiction which it otherwise does not possess. But it is always open to\na competent Legislature to invest a tribunal of limited jurisdiction with\nthe power to decide or determine finally the preliminary or jurisdictional\nfacts on which exercise of its jurisdiction depends. In such cases, the\nfinding recorded by the tribunal cannot be challenged by certiorari. (Vide\nUjjam Bai v. State of U.P.\n\n27. As a general rule, neither in England, nor in India, such jurisdiction\nis granted on a court of limited jurisdiction or on an inferior tribunal.\nIn Halsbury's Laws of England, (4th edn. vol. 1; para 56); it has been\nstated;\n\nIt is possible for an inferior tribunal to be vested with power to\ndetermine conclusively questions demarcating the limits of its own\njurisdiction. Such a grant of power must now be regarded as exceptional, in\nview of the very restrictive interpretation placed by the courts on\nstatutory formulae purporting to exclude their inherent supervisory\njurisdiction, and their reluctance to be precluded by subjectively worded\ngrants of power from determining judicially ascertainable matters\ndelimiting the area of competence of inferior tribunals, especially where\nthe relevant question is one of law.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn fact, one of the points of differentiation between a Crown's Court and a\nstatutory tribunal is that whereas a court has inherent power to decide the\nquestion of its own jurisdiction, although as a result of inquiry, it may\nturn out that it has no jurisdiction to try the suit, the jurisdiction of a\ntribunal constituted under a statute is strictly confined to the terms of\nthe statute creating it. The existence of preliminary or 'jurisdictional'\nfact is a sine qua non to the assumption of jurisdiction by a tribunal of\nlimited jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional fact does not exist, the\ntribunal cannot act. But a Legislature Page 1843 may confer such power on a\ncourt of limited jurisdiction or on an inferior tribunal (vide\nEbrahim\nAboobaker v. Custodian General\n;\nUjjam Bai v. State of U.P.\n,;\nRaja Anand v.\nState of U.P.\n,;\nNaresh Shridhar Mirazkar v. State of Maharashtra\n, ;\nRaza\nTextiles Ltd. v. I.T.O.\n,;\nShiv Chander v. Amar Bose\n,;\nShrisht Dhawan v.\nShaw Brothers\n,;\nVatticherubura Village Panchayat v. Nari Venkatarama\nDeekshithulu\n,;\nExecutive Officer, Arthanareswarar Temple v. R.\nSathyamoorthy and Ors.\n].\n\n28. Let us consider the principle in the light of case-law on the point:\n\nKeeping in view, the distinction referred to hereinabove, before more than\nhundred years, in Queen v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1888) 21 QB 313: 33\nWR 776, Lord Esher, M.R. made the following observations:\n\n\"When an inferior court or tribunal or body, which has to exercise the\npower of deciding facts, is first established by Act of Parliament, the\nlegislature has to consider, what powers it will give that tribunal or\nbody. It may in effect say that, if a certain state of facts exists and is\nshown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things, it\nshall have jurisdiction to do such things, but not otherwise. There it is\nnot for them conclusively to decide whether that state of facts exists,\nand, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do\nmay be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without\njurisdiction. But there is another state of things which may exist. The\nlegislature may intrust the tribunal or body with a jurisdiction, which\nincludes the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of\nfacts exists as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that it does exist, to\nproceed further or do something more. When the legislature are establishing\nsuch a tribunal or body with limited jurisdiction, they also have to\nconsider, whatever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any\nappeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be none. In the second\nof the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the\nformula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by\nwrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legislature gave them\njurisdiction to Page 1844 determine all the facts, including the existence\nof the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their\njurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide,\nwithout any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of\ntheir jurisdiction.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n29. The above statement of law has been quoted with approval by this Court\nin several cases.\nIn\nChaube Jagdish Prasad and Anr. v. Ganga Prasad\nChaturvedi\nthe Court stated:\n\n\"These observations which relate to inferior courts or tribunals with\nlimited jurisdiction show that there are two classes of cases dealing with\nthe power of such a tribunal (1) where the legislature entrusts a tribunal\nwith the jurisdiction including the jurisdiction to determine whether the\npreliminary state of facts on which the exercise of its jurisdiction\ndepends exists and (2) where the legislature confers jurisdiction on such\ntribunals to proceed in a case where a certain state of facts exists or is\nshown to exist. The difference is that in the former case the tribunal has\npower to determine the facts giving it jurisdiction and in the latter case\nit has only to see that a certain state of facts exists.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nAgain, in\nAddanki Tiruvenkata Thata Desika Charyulu v. State of Andhra\nPradesh and Anr.\n, the Settlement Officer was empowered to decide finally as\nto whether inam village was an 'inam estate'. It also barred jurisdiction\nof Civil Court from\nquestioning the correctness of the decision.\n\n30. Considering the question as to extent to which the powers of statutory\ntribunals are 'exclusive', the Constitution Bench after referring to\nCommissioner of Income Tax, stated:\n\n\"It is manifest that the answer to the question as to whether any\nparticular case falls under the first or the second of the above categories\nwould depend on the purpose of the statute and its general scheme, taken in\nconjunction with the scope of the enquiry entrusted to the tribunal set up\nand other relevant factors.\"\n\n31. As already indicated by me earlier, Sub-section (1) of\nSection 16\ndoes\nnot merely enable the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction,\nbut requires it to continue arbitral proceedings and pass an arbitral\naward. [Sub-section (5)] It allows the aggrieved party to make an\napplication for setting aside the award in accordance with\nSection 34\n.\n[Sub-section (6)]. Thus, in my judgment,\nSection 16\ncan be described as\n'self-contained Code' as regards the challenge to the jurisdiction of\nArbitral Tribunal. As per the scheme envisaged by Parliament, once the\nArbitral Tribunal rules that it has jurisdiction, it will proceed to decide\nthe matter on merits and make an award. Parliament has also provided the\nremedy to the aggrieved party by enacting that he may make an application\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Act. In the circumstances, the proceedings cannot\nbe allowed to be arrested or interference permitted during the pendency of\narbitration proceedings.\n\nPage 1845\nIt was submitted by Mr. Venugopal that once the Chief Justice is satisfied\nas to fulfillment of conditions for the exercise of power to appoint an\narbitrator and his decision is 'final', it would be impossible to hold that\nthe Arbitral Tribunal can go behind the decision of the Chief Justice and\nhold otherwise.\n\nMr. Venugopal suggested that\nSection 16\nshould be so construed that it\nwould apply only to the cases covered by Sub-sections (2) and (3) of\n\nSection 11\nand not to Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nand the appointment of\nan arbitrator made by the Chief Justice. By such interpretation, submitted\nthe counsel, both the provisions can be harmoniously interpreted and\nproperly applied.\n\nThough the majority observed it to be 'one of the ways of reconciliation',\nI have my own reservation in accepting it. Firstly, the function of the\nCourt is to interpret the provision as it is and not to amend, alter or\nsubstitute by interpretative process. Secondly, it is for the Legislature\nto make a law applicable to certain situations contemplated by it and the\njudiciary has no power in entering into 'legislative wisdom'. Thirdly, as\nheld by me, the 'decision' of the Chief Justice is merely prima facie\ndecision and Sub-section (1) of\nSection 16\nconfers express power on the\nArbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Fourthly, it provides\nremedy to deal with situations created by the order passed by the Arbitral\nTribunal. Finally and importantly, the situation envisaged by Mr. Venugopal\nwould seldom arise. Normally, when parties agree on the appointment of an\narbitrator or arbitrators, there would hardly be any dispute between them\non such appointment which may call for intervention by Arbitral Tribunal\nunder\nSection 16\nof the Act. For all these reasons, I am unable to persuade\nmyself to hold that\nSection 16\nhas limited application to cases covered by\nSub-sections (2) and (3) and not to Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the\nAct. The phraseology used by the Legislature does not warrant\ninterpretation sought to be suggested by Mr. Venugopal.\n\n32. It was also submitted that in case of failure on the part of the party\nto the arbitration agreement in appointing an arbitrator, an application\ncan be made under\nSection 11\nof the Act and arbitrator can be appointed by\nthe Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him. It was\nurged that it is settled law that judicial or quasi-judicial power has to\nbe exercised by the authority to whom it is granted and cannot be\ndelegated. As the intention of Parliament was to confer the power on the\nhighest judicial authority in the State and in the country, it cannot be\nallowed to be exercised by 'any person' or 'institution'.\n\n33. In my view, the submission is ill-conceived and has been made by\nlooking at the matter from an incorrect angle. It first assumes that the\nfunction performed by the Chief Justice is judicial or quasi-judicial and\nthen proceeds to examine legal position on that basis and attempts to\nsalvage the situation by urging that the power must be exercised by the\nChief Justice. In that case, however, the subsequent part \"or any person or\ninstitution designated by him\" (Chief Justice) would become redundant.\nRealising the difficulty and keeping in view the principles relating to\ninterpretation of statutes, Mr. Nariman, Senior Advocate submitted that\n\nSection 11\nprovides for dichotomy of functions. It contemplates two\nsituations, and deals with two stages. The first stage consists of\nconsideration of preliminary facts and taking of decision Page 1846 as to\nwhether an arbitrator can be appointed. The second stage allows nomination\nof an arbitrator. According to Mr. Nariman, the first part is essentially a\njudicial function, which cannot be delegated to 'any person or institution'\nand at the most, it can be delegated to any Judge of the court. The second\nstage, however, is more or less ministerial and at that stage, the Chief\nJustice may, if he thinks fit, take help of any person or institution so\nthat proper and fit person is appointed as arbitrator.\n\nThough the submission weighed with the majority, I express my inability to\nagree with it for several reasons. Firstly, as earlier noted, it proceeds\non the basis that the function of the Chief Justice is judicial or quasi-\njudicial, which is not correct. In my view, it is administrative which is\napparent from the language of\nSection 11\nand strengthened by\nSection 16\n\nwhich enables the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction.\nSecondly, a court of law must give credit to Parliament that it is aware of\nsettled legal position that judicial or quasi-judicial function cannot be\ndelegated and if the function performed by the Chief Justice is judicial or\nquasi-judicial in nature, keeping in view legal position, it would not have\nallowed delegation of such function to 'any person or authority'. Thirdly,\nthe majority held, and I am in respectful agreement with it, that the\nconferment of power on the Chief Justice is not as 'persona designata'.\nHence, the power can be delegated. Finally, if the legislative intent is\nthe exercise of power by the Chief Justice alone, one fails to understand\nas to how it can be exercised by a 'colleague' of the Chief Justice as\nwell.\n\nIn my opinion, acceptance of the submission of Mr. Nariman would result in\nrewriting of a statute. The scheme of the legislation does not warrant such\nconstruction. No court much less the highest court of the country would\ninterpret one provision (\nSection 11\n) of an Act of Parliament which would\nmake another provision (\nSection 16\n) totally redundant, otiose and nugatory.\nThe Legislature has conferred power on the Chief Justice to appoint an\narbitrator in certain contingencies. By the same pen and ink, it allowed\nthe Chief Justice to get that power exercised through 'any person or\ninstitution'. It is not open to a court to ignore the legislative mandate\nby making artificial distinction between the power to be exercised by the\nChief Justice or by his 'colleague' and the power to be exercised by other\norgans though Legislature was quite clear on the exercise of power by the\npersons and authorities specified therein. I accordingly reject the\nargument.\n\n34. It was then urged that the principal ground for holding the function of\nthe Chief Justice under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nas administrative was\nto ensure immediate commencement of arbitration proceedings and speedy\ndisposal of cases. In reality, however, it is likely to cause delay for the\nsimple reason that if the order passed by the Chief Justice of the High\nCourt is treated as judicial or quasi judicial, it can only be challenged\nin the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. So far as the\norder of the Chief Justice of India is concerned, it is 'final' as no\nappeal/application/writ petition lies against it. But if such decision is\nheld to be administrative, initially, it can be challenged on the judicial\nside of the High Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. Normally,\nunder the High Court Rules, such petitions are dealt with and decided by a\nSingle Judge. Hence, the decision of a single Page 1847 Judge can further\nbe challenged by filing a Letters Patent Appeal or Intra-court Appeal under\nthe relevant clause of the Letters Patent applicable to the High Court\nconcerned. Finally, an order passed by the Division Bench can always be\nmade subject-matter of challenge before this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution. Thus, an interpretation sought to be adopted for the purpose\nof reducing litigation and speedy disposal of proceedings would really\nresult in increase of litigation and delay in disposal of cases.\nI must admit that once it is held that the order passed by the Chief\nJustice is administrative, it can be challenged in Writ Petition, Letters\nPatent Appeal and in Special Leave Petition. But in my opinion, while\nexercising extraordinary jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution, the High Court would consider the provisions of the Act, such\nas, limited judicial intervention of Court (\nSection 5\n); power of Arbitral\nTribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction and the effect of such decision\n(\nSection 16\n). It will also keep in mind the legislative intent of\nexpeditious disposal of proceedings and may not interfere at that stage.\nUltimately, having jurisdiction or power to entertain a cause and\ninterference with the order are two different and distinct matters. One\ndoes not necessarily result into the other. Hence, in spite of jurisdiction\nof the High Court, it may not stall arbitration proceedings by allowing the\nparty to raise all objections before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n35.\nIn\nLaxmikant Revchand Bhojwani and Anr. v. Pratapsingh Mohansingh\nPardeshi\n, the relevant\nRent Act\ndid not provide for further appeal or\nrevision against an order assed by the appellate authority. The aggrieved\nparty, therefore, invoked supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. The\nHigh Court allowed the petition and set aside the order passed by the\nappellate court.\n\nQuashing the order of the High Court and keeping in view the legislative\nscheme, this Court said;\n\n\"Before parting with this judgment we would like to say that the High Court\nwas not justified in extending its jurisdiction under\nArticle 227\nof the\nConstitution of India in the present case.\nThe Act\nis a special legislation\ngoverning landlord-tenant relationship and disputes. The legislature has,\nin its wisdom, not provided second appeal or revision to the High Court.\nThe object is to give finality to the decision of the appellate authority.\nThe High Court under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India cannot assume\nunlimited prerogative to correct all species of hardship or wrong\ndecisions. It must be restricted to cases of grave dereliction of duty and\nflagrant abuse of fundamental principles of law or justice, where grave\ninjustice would be done unless the High Court interferes.\"\n\n[See also Koyilerian Janaki and Ors. v. Rent Controller (Munsiff), Cannore\nand Ors.;\nOuseph Mathai and Ors. v. M. Abdul Khadir\n;]\n\nIn\nState of Orissa and Ors. v. Gokulananda Jena\n, (2003) 6 SCC 456, relying\nupon Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. II, the High Court of Orissa held that\nsince the order passed by the Chief Justice was administrative, it was not\namenable to writ jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution.\nHolding that the High Court was wrong and the writ petition under\nArticle\nwas maintainable, a two-Judge Bench stated;\n\n\"However, we must notice that in view of\nSection 16\nread with\nSections 12\n\nand\nof the Act as interpreted by the Constitution Bench of this Court in\nthe M/s.\nKonkan Railway\n(supra) almost all disputes which could be\npresently contemplated can be raised and agitated before the Arbitrator\nappointed by the Designated Judge under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. From the\nperusal of the said provisions of the Act, it is clear that there is hardly\nany area of dispute which cannot be decided by the Arbitrator appointed by\nthe Designated Judge. If that be so, since an alternative efficacious\nremedy is available before the Arbitrator, writ court normally would not\nentertain a challenge to an order of the Designated Judge made under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act which includes considering the question of\njurisdiction of the Arbitrator himself. Therefore, in our view even though\na writ petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is available to an\naggrieved party, ground available for challenge in such a petition is\nlimited because of the alternative remedy available under the Act itself.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe above observations clearly go to show that though the constitutional\nremedy cannot be taken away and an aggrieved party can invoke the\njurisdiction of the High Court against an order passed by the Chief\nJustice, the Writ Court will be circumspect in entertaining a petition and\nin exercising extraordinary jurisdiction in such cases.\n\n36. As has been held in earlier decisions as also in the majority judgment,\nthe paramount consideration of Parliament in selecting the Chief Justice\nand in conferring upon him the power to appoint an arbitrator is to ensure\ncomplete independence, total impartiality and highest degree of credibility\nin arbitral process. The Chief Justice of India and Chief Justices of High\nCourts have been specially chosen considering their constitutional status\nas Judges of superior courts and their rich experience in dealing with such\nmatters. The office occupied by them would infuse greater confidence in the\nprocedure in appointing an arbitrator and in ensuring fairness, integrity\nand impartiality.\n\nBut that does not mean that the Chief Justice is exercising judicial or\nquasi-judicial power. On the contrary, the Chief Justice, acting in\nadministrative capacity, as distinguished from judicial capacity, is\nexpected to act quickly and expeditiously without being inhibited by\nprocedural requirements and 'technical tortures'. In undertaking the task\nto appoint an Arbitral Tribunal, he is neither required to consult parties\nnor arbitrators. The Chief Justice would thus uphold, preserve and protect\nsolemnity of agreement between the parties to arbitration. This practice is\nprevalent in England and in other countries since several years.\n\n37. I intend to conclude the discussion on this point by quoting the\nfollowing pertinent observations of Lord Hobhouse in Palgrave Gold Mining\nCo. v. McMillan, 1892 AC 460 : 61 LJ PC 85. Dealing with a similar\nsituation and repelling an identical contention, before more than hundred\nyears, the Law Lord rightly declared;\n\nIt is very common in England to invest responsible public officials with\nthe duty of appointing Arbitrators under given circumstances. Such\nappointment should be made with integrity and impartiality, but it is new\nto their Lordships to hear them called judicial acts...\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n38. The last question relates to issuance of notice to the party likely to\nbe affected and affording an opportunity of hearing before making an order\nof composition of Arbitral Tribunal.\nSection 8\nof the old Act of 1940\nexpressly provided written notice and opportunity of hearing in case of\nappointment of an arbitrator or umpire. The present Act of 1996 neither\nprovides for issuance of notice nor for opportunity of being heard.\nIn exercise of power under Sub-section (10) of\nSection 11\nof the Act, the\nChief Justice of India had framed a scheme, known as \"The Appointment of\nArbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme. 1996\". Clause 7 provided\nfor issuing notice to affected persons and read thus;\n\n\"Notice to affected persons.- Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6, the\nChief Justice or the person or the institution designated by him shall\ndirect that a notice of the request be given to all the parties to the\narbitration agreement and such other person or persons as may seem to him\nor is likely to be affected by such request to show cause, within the time\nspecified in the notice, why the appointment of the arbitrator or the\nmeasure proposed to be taken should not be made or taken and such notice\nshall be accompanied by copies of all documents referred to in paragraph 2\nor, as the case may be, by information or clarification, if any, sought\nunder paragraph 5.\"\n\n39. In Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. II, the Constitution Bench held the\nfunction of the Chief Justice of appointment of an arbitrator under Sub-\nsection (6) of\nSection 11\nas administrative and not judicial. In the light\nof the said finding, the Court proceeded to state that it was not necessary\nto issue notice to the parties likely to be affected.\nSection 11\ndid not\nprovide for such notice. The Court, however, did not stop there. It held\nthat by making a provision for issuance of notice, the scheme went 'beyond\nthe terms of\nSection 11\n' and was bad on that ground. A direction was,\ntherefore, issued to amend it.\n\nSince the majority judgment has held the function of the Chief Justice as\njudicial, it ruled that such notice ought to be issued and opportunity of\nhearing ought to be afforded by the Chief Justice to the person or persons\nlikely to be affected thereby in an appointment of arbitrator.\nI have, on the other hand, held that the function of the Chief Justice\nunder Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nis neither judicial nor quasi-judicial\nbut administrative. It is also true that unlike\nSection 8\nof the 1940 Act,\n1996 Act does not envisage issuance of notice to the party likely to be\naffected by the order of the Chief Justice.\n\n40. The question, however, is : Can such clause in the scheme prepared by\nthe Chief Justice of India be held bad as going 'beyond the terms of\n\nSection 11\n'? The Constitution Bench so held in Konkan Railway Corporation\nLtd. II. With great respect to the Constitution Bench, such provision\ncannot be held inconsistent with the parent Act or otherwise bad in law.\nThe Constitution Bench did not assign any reason as to why it was of the\nview that Clause 7 could not stand or how it violated\nSection 11\n. But\nreference to Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd v. Lakshmi Chand,;\nEngineering Mazdoor\nSabha v. Hind Cycles Ltd.\n, and\nAssociated Cement Companies Ltd. v. P.N.\nSharma\n, clearly shows that since the Constitution Bench was of the view\nthat while performing function of appointing an Arbitral Tribunal the Chief\nJustice was not acting as a Court or Tribunal, he was not expected to issue\nnotice or afford an opportunity of hearing to the parties likely to be\naffected by such decision.\n\nOnce the function of the Chief Justice is held to be administrative, there\nmay not be 'duty to act judicially' on the part of the Chief Justice.\nNevertheless in such cases, an administrative authority is required to act\n'fairly'. Basic procedural fairness requires such notice to the opposite\nparty. The principle in\nR. v. Electricity Commissioners\n, or Ridge v.\nBaldwin, may not apply to administrative functions, but another concept\nwhich developed at a later stage and accepted in public law field and found\nplace in Administrative Law of 'duty to act fairly' would apply to\nadministrative actions as well.\n\n41. By now, it is well settled that when an administrative action is likely\nto affect rights of subjects, there would be a duty on the part of the\nauthority to act fairly.\n\nIn Pearlberg v. Varty (Inspector of Taxes), Lord Pearson said;\n\n\"A tribunal to whom judicial or quasi-judicial functions are entrusted is\nheld to be required to apply those principles (i.e. the rules of natural\njustice) in performing those functions unless there is a provision to title\ncontrary. But where some person or body is entrusted by Parliament that\nadministrative or executive functions there is no presumption that\ncompliance with the principles of natural justice is required although, as\n'Parliament is not to be presumed to act unfairly', the courts may be able\nin suitable cases (perhaps always) to imply an obligation to act with\nfairness.\" 5\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn\nR. v. Commissioner\nfor Racial Equality, Lord Diplock stated;\n\"Where an act of Parliament confers upon an administrative body functions\nwhich involve its making decisions which affect to their detriment the\nrights Page 1851 of other persons or curtail their liberty to do as they\nplease, there is a presumption that Parliament intended that the\nadministrative body should act fairly towards those persons who will be\naffected by their decisions.\"\n\nThe above principles have been accepted and applied in India also.\nIn the\nleading case of\nKeshav Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India\n, a textile mill was\nclosed down. A Committee was appointed by the Government of India to\ninvestigate into the affairs of the mill-company under the\nIndustries\n(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951\n. After affording opportunity to the\nCompany, a report was prepared by the Committee and submitted to the\nGovernment. A copy of the report, however, was not supplied to the Company.\nOn the basis of the report, the Government took over the management of the\nCompany. The said action was challenged by the company inter alia on the\nground of violation of principles of natural justice inasmuch as no copy of\nthe report submitted by the Committed to the Government was supplied to the\nCompany nor was hearing afforded before finally deciding to take over the\nmanagement.\n\nRejecting the contention and observing that no prejudice had been caused to\nthe mill-company, this Court did not interfere with the order.\nSpeaking for the Court, A.K. Mukherjea, J. stated:\n\n\"The second question, however, as to what are the principles of natural\njustice that should regulate an administrative act or order is a much more\ndifficult one to answer. We do not think it either feasible or even\ndesirable to lay down any fixed or rigorous yardstick in this manner. The\nconcept of natural justice cannot be put into a straitjacket. It is futile,\ntherefore, to look for definitions or standards of natural justice from\nvarious decisions and then try to apply them to the facts of any given\ncase. The only essential point that has to be kept in mind in all cases is\nthat the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of\npresenting his case and that the administrative authority concerned should\nact fairly, impartially and reasonably. Where administrative officers are\nconcerned, the duty is not so much to act judicially as to act fairly.\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn\nMohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commission\nafter considering\nseveral cases, Krishna Iyer, J. stated :\n\n\"Once we understand the soul of the rule as fairplay in action -and it is\nso - we must hold that it extends to both the fields. After all,\nadministrative power in a democratic set-up is not allergic to fairness in\naction and discretionary executive justice cannot degenerate into\nunilateral injustice. Nor is there ground to be frightened of delay,\ninconvenience and expense, if natural justice gains access. For fairness\nitself is a flexible, pragmatic and relative concept, not a rigid,\nritualistic or sophisticated abstraction. It is not a bull in a china shop,\nnor a bee in one's bonnet: Its essence is good conscience in a given\nsituation; nothing more - but nothing less.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIn\nNally Bharat Engineering Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar\n, the Government, on\nan application by a dismissed workman transferred his case from one Labour\nCourt to another Labour Court without issuing a notice or giving\nopportunity to the employer.\n\nSetting aside the order and referring to several cases, the Supreme Court\ninvoked the 'acting fairly' doctrine. The Court stated: \"Fairness, in our\nopinion, is a fundamental principle of good administration. It is a rule to\nensure the vast power in the modern State is not abused but properly\nexercised. The State power is used for proper and not for improper\npurposes. The authority is not misguided by extraneous or irrelevant\nconsiderations. Fairness, is also a principle to ensure that statutory\nauthority arrives at a just decision either in promoting the interest or\naffecting the rights of persons. To use the timehallowed phrase that\n'justice should not only be done but be seen to be done' is the essence of\nfairness equally applicable to administrative authorities. Fairness is thus\na prime test for proper and good administration. It has no set form or\nprocedure. It depends upon the facts of each case.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nQuoting the observations of Paul Jackson, the Court said:\n\n\"It may be noted that the terms 'fairness of procedure', 'fair play in\naction', 'duty to act fairly' are perhaps used as alternatives to 'natural\njustice' without drawing any distinction. But Prof Paul Jackson points out\nthat 'such phrases may sometimes be used to refer not to the obligation to\nobserve the principles of natural justice but, on the contrary, to refer to\na standard of behavior which increasingly, the courts require to be\nfollowed even in circumstances where the duty to observe natural justice is\ninapplicable'.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nde Smith states:\n\n\"The principal value of the introduction of the 'duty to act fairly' into\nthe courts' vocabulary has been to assist them to extend the benefit of\nbasic procedural protections to situations where it would be both confusing\nto characterize as judicial or even quasi-judicial, the decision-makers'\nfunctions, and inappropriate to insist on a procedure analogous to a\ntrial.\"\n\n['Judicial Review of Administrative Action'; (1995); p. 399]\n\n42. It is thus clear that the doctrine of 'fairness' has become all\npervasive. As has been said, the 'acting fairly' doctrine proved useful as\na device for evading confusion which prevailed in the past. \"The courts now\nhave two strings to their bow.\" An administrative act may be held to be\nsubject to the requirement and observance of natural justice either because\nit affects rights or interests and hence would involve a 'duty to act\njudicially' or it may be administrative, pure and simple, and yet, may\nrequire basic procedural Page 1853 protection which would involve 'duty to\nact fairly'. [Wade & Forsyth; 'Administrative Law'; (2005); pp. 492-94; de\nSmith; \"Judicial Review of Administrative Action\", (1995); pp. 397-98]\n'Acting fairly' is thus an additional weapon in the armoury of the court.\nIt is not intended to be substituted for another much more powerful weapon\n'acting judicially'. Where, however, the former ('acting judicially')\ncannot be wielded, the court will try to reach injustice by taking resort\nto the latter - less powerful weapon ('acting fairly'). [See C.K. Thakker :\n\n\"From Duty to Act Judicially to Duty to Act Fairly\",].\n\n43. As the Chief Justice is performing administrative function under Sub-\nsection (6) of\nSection 11\nin appointing an arbitrator, mere is no 'duty to\nact judicially' on his part, nonetheless there is 'duty to act fairly'\nwhich requires him to issue notice to the other side before taking a\ndecision to appoint an arbitrator. I am, therefore, of the view that Clause\n7 of the scheme as stood prior to the amendment, could neither be held bad\nin law nor inconsistent with\nSection 11\nof the Act. I am, therefore, in\nrespectful agreement with the majority judgment on that point.\n\n44. On the basis of the above findings, my conclusions are as under;\n\n(i) The function performed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or the\nChief Justice of India under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act (i.e.\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n) is administrative, - pure and\nsimple -, and neither judicial nor quasi-judicial.\n\n(ii) The function to be performed by the Chief Justice under Sub-section\n(6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act may be performed by him or by 'any person or\ninstitution designated by him'.\n\n(iii) While performing the function under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof\nthe Act, the Chief Justice should be prima facie satisfied that the\nconditions\nlaid down in\n\nSection 11\nare satisfied.\n\n(iv) The Arbitral Tribunal has power and jurisdiction to rule 'on its own\njurisdiction' under Sub-section (1) of\nSection 16\nof the Act.\n\n(v) Where the Arbitral Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction, it shall\ncontinue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award.\n\n(vi) A remedy available to the party aggrieved is to challenge the award in\naccordance with\nSection 34\nor\nSection 37\nof the Act.\n\n(vii) Since the order passed by the Chief Justice under Sub-section (6) of\n\nSection 11\nof the Act is administrative, a Writ Petition under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution is maintainable. A Letters Patent Appeal/Intra-court\nAppeal is competent. A Special Leave Petition under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution also lies to this Court.\n\n(viii) While exercising extraordinary jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution, however, the High Court will be conscious and mindful of the\nrelevant provisions of the Act, including\nSections 5\n,\n,\nto\nas also\nthe object of the legislation and exercise its power with utmost care,\ncaution and circumspection.\n\n(ix) The decision of the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway Corporation\nLtd. II, to the extent that it held the function of the Chief Justice under\nSub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act as administrative is in consonance\nPage 1854 with settled legal position and lays down correct law on the\npoint.\n\n(x) The decision of the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway Corporation\nLtd. II, to the extent that it held Clause 7 of \"The Appointment of\nArbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996\" providing for\nissuance of notice to affected parties as 'beyond the term of\nSection 11\n'\nand bad on that ground is not in accordance with law and does not state the\nlegal position correctly.\n\n(xi) Since the Chief Justice is performing administrative function in\nappointing an Arbitral Tribunal, there is no 'duty to act judicially' on\nhis part. The doctrine of 'duty to act fairly', however, applies and the\nChief Justice must issue notice to the person or persons likely to be\naffected by the decision under Sub-section (6) of\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\n(xii) All appointments of Arbitral Tribunals so far made without issuing\nnotice to the parties affected are held legal and valid. Henceforth,\nhowever, every appointment will be made after issuing notice to such person\nor persons. In other words, this judgment will have prospective operation\nand it will not affect past appointments or concluded proceedings.",
