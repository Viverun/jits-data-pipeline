Petitioner\nThrough: Mr. Sumit Bansal, Mr. Ateev Mathur,\nMr. Rajnish Gaur, Ms. Sumi Anand\nand Ms. Richa Oberoi, Advocates\n\nversus\n\nANJU BALA GUPTA & OTHERS ..... Respondents\nThrough: Mr. Om Prakash Sharma, Advocate\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nVIPIN SANGHI, J. (ORAL)\n\n1. The petitioner has preferred the present writ petition to assail the\norder dated 14.03.2013 passed by the Presiding Officer Dr. R.K. Yadav of\nthe Central Government Industrial Tribunal cum Labour Court I, New Delhi\n(CGIT/Tribunal).\n\n2. A little background of the relevant facts is necessary. The respondent\nwas employed with the petitioner on 01.11.1978. The petitioner came out\nwith a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) on 01.07.2003. The respondent\nopted for voluntary retirement under the said scheme and was relieved from\n\nPage 1 of 22\n\nservice on 31.08.2003.\n\n3. The lump sum amounts payable to the respondent was paid by the\npetitioner bank. She has also been receiving her pension from the petitioner.\nMuch after the respondent had severed her relationship with the petitioner\nbank, the management of the petitioner bank entered into a Bipartite\nSettlement with the employees on 02.06.2005. However, the same was\napplicable w.e.f. 01.11.2002. Accordingly, the petitioner bank paid the\narrears of the difference between the salary already received by the\nrespondent and the revised salary, as well as the component of gratuity and\nprovident fund on the basis of the revised salary. However, the respondent\nwas not granted any revision of pension, or arrears on that account which is\nwhat lead her to prefer her petition under\nSection 33-C (2)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947\n(The Act\n) before the CGIT.\n\n4. The petitioner raised the preliminary objection to the maintainability\nof the said petition on the ground that there was no pre-existing right on the\nbasis of which the said petition had been preferred. It was claimed that for a\npetition to be maintainable under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Act, it was\nnecessary that there existed a prior adjudication or settlement of a claim.\nThe CGIT does not function as an Adjudicating Authority while dealing\nwith a petition under\nSection 33C(2)\n. Rather, it functions like an Executing\nCourt. The preliminary objection raised by the petitioner before the CGIT\nwas that the respondent was seeking to re-write the terms of the VRS offered\nby the petitioner bank in the year 2003 under which the respondent had\nderived the benefits. It was submitted that the CGIT, in any case, could not\nhave adjudicated upon the said claim under\nSection 33C(2)\n.\n\nPage 2 of 22\n\n5. The CGIT framed the issues on 14.11.2011. After framing three\nissues, the CGIT observed as follows:\n\n\"On the written statement, objections are taken that claims\nunder various heads are not based on existing rights. Those\nobjections are incidental to issue No.1 and would be\nadjudicated while answering that issue. The management may\nraise those propositions at the time of arguments and no issue\nis required to be settled on those objections.\"\n\nThereafter the matter was adjourned for evidence being led by the\nparties.\n\n6. It appears that the petitioner also moved an application on 02.12.2011\nbefore the CGIT for the issue with regard to maintainability of the\nrespondent's petition being decided. While dealing with this application on\n23.12.2011, the CGIT made the following observation:\n\n\"It is a settled proposition of law that the claimant is not\nentitled to get his disputed claims settled, by way of petition\nunder\nsection 33-C(2)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in\nshort the Act). It is pointed out to Shri Gupta that disputed\nclaims are beyond the purview of\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Act\nand would be discarded at the time of final adjudication. The\nmanagement is also assured that the claims which are not\nmaintainable would not and cannot be taken for adjudication.\"\n\n7. From the above it appears that the CGIT recognised the position that,\nat least a part of the grievances raised in the respondent's petition were\nbeyond the scope of enquiry permissible in proceedings under\nSection 33-\n\nC(2) of the Act. An assurance was also given to the petitioner that such of\nthe claims which are beyond the pale of\nSection 33-C(2)\n, shall not be taken\nup for adjudication.\n\nPage 3 of 22\n\n8. On or about 19.06.2012, the respondent moved two applications - one\nfor leading additional evidence and the other for production of additional\ndocuments by the petitioner. These applications were opposed by the\npetitioner and were disposed of, by the two orders of the same date, i.e.,\n19.07.2012. In the operative part of the order dated 19.07.2012 passed on\nthe respondent's application for production of documents by the petitioner,\nthe CGIT directed as follows:\n\n\"16. In view of reasons detailed above, it is ordered that\nclaimant is not entitled for details of break up of amount paid in\n2005 to other similarly placed employees as well as Gratuity\nRules. His request for supply of these documents cannot be\ngranted. However, request for production of the documents,\nother than break up amount paid to similarly placed employees\nfor the year 2005 and Gratuity Rules, is to be accepted. Bank,\ntherefore, is called upon to produce those documents on the\nnext date of hearing positively. With these observations,\napplication stands disposed off. Announced in open court on\n19.07.2012.\"\n\n9. At that stage, the petitioner approached this court by filing W.P.(C.)\nNo.5832/2012. The grievance of the petitioner was that the respondents\napplication under\nsection 33C(2)\nwas, itself, not maintainable and, therefore,\nthe petitioner could not be directed to produce documents and furnish\ninformation as sought by the respondent. Detailed submissions were made\nby the parties with regard to the scope of the proceedings under\nsection\n33C(2)\nof the Act. The claims made by the respondent under that provision\nbefore the CGIT were also examined-claim by claim. The grievances raised\nby the respondent were also examined one by one.\n\nPage 4 of 22\n\n10. After considering the scope of the proceedings under\nsection 33C(2)\n\nof the Act, in the light of the judgment of the\nCentral Inland Water\nTransport Corporation Limited Vs. The Workmen and Another\n, (1974) 4\nSCC 696, this Court held as follows:\n\n\"26. .... .... As to whether or not the mere revision of pay\nscale and payment of arrears of pay, gratuity and provident\nfund would also call for revision of pension - particularly in the\nface of Clause 13 and Clause 3 of the General Terms &\nConditions as extracted above, is an issue which would need\nadjudication. Similarly, whether there is discrimination and, if\nso, whether it is actionable, are issues which require\nadjudication. So as not to prejudice the case of either of the\nparties, this Court is refraining from making any comment on\nthe same at this stage. However, there can be no doubt that the\nrelief sought by the respondent is premised on the annulment of\nClause 13 and Clause 3, as aforesaid. In the teeth of these\nclauses, the relief of revision of pension certainly cannot be\ngranted. The said dispute raised by the respondent would\nrequire independent adjudication. The respondent has itself\nstated in her petition that Clause 3 has become redundant in\nview of her submissions made in the petition. This clearly\nshows that the respondent is seeking to justify her claim not on\nthe terms & conditions of the settlement, but de hors and, rather\ncontrary to the said terms & conditions. The aforesaid issues\nraised by the respondent can certainly not be said to be\nincidental to the VRS/settlement between the parties. It cannot\nbe said that the respondent is merely seeking to execute or\nenforce the settlement through the process under\nSection 33-\n\nC(2) of the Act. The respondent is, in fact, seeking to establish\nher right to relief by raising the aforesaid issues and is also\nseeking the determination of the issue of the petitioner's\ncorresponding liability. These are well beyond the scope of an\nincidental enquiry that may be undertaken in enforcement or\nexecution proceedings in respect of a pre-determined right in a\nsettlement or adjudication.\n\nPage 5 of 22\n\n27. Pertinently, the CGIT has appreciated this aspect - as is\nevident from the order dated 23.12.2011 extracted above.\nHowever, the CGIT has not separated the claims/issues which\nfall within the scope of an enquiry under\nSection 33-C(2)\nand\nthose which fall beyond it. In my view, this is a fallacious\napproach because, by not doing so, further enquiry/proceedings\nfor leading additional evidence/production of documents would\nunnecessarily be undertaken even in respect of issues/claims\nwhich fall beyond the scope of enquiry under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof\nthe Act. The approach of the CGIT could not be to gather\nevidence/information even beyond the scope of the enquiry\nbefore it, and then to discard a part of it later. The CGIT\nshould not have postponed the segregation of the issues/claims\nbeyond its jurisdiction under\nSection 33-C(2)\nbut dealt with the\nsaid objection at the earliest to limit the scope of its enquiry to\ncover those aspects which fall within its jurisdiction. Of\ncourse, if there is an aspect on which a firm view cannot be\ntaken, i.e., whether, or not, it falls within the scope of enquiry\nunder\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Act, without evidence being\nrecorded, the CGIT should observe so and in that eventuality, it\nmay postpone the determination of the issue of jurisdiction till\nafter the evidence is recorded. However, this aspect should\nreceive consideration from the Tribunal at the earliest so as to\ncurtail unnecessary proceedings, expense of time and expense.\n\n28. There are a couple of aspects which appear to fall within\nthe scope of the enquiry permissible under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof\nthe Act. I now proceed to deal with them.\n\n29. The first grievance of the respondent stems out of the\nsettlement inasmuch, as, the respondent is seeking information\nwith regard to the detailed break up of the amounts computed\nand paid by the petitioner at the time when she was granted\nVRS. There can be no doubt that the respondent is entitled to\nthe said information.\n\n30. Similarly, her grievance number six, as aforesaid, in\nrelation to the manner in which TDS has been deducted from\nthe amount already been paid to her or being paid to her,\n\nPage 6 of 22\n\nappears to be justified and the petitioner cannot deny the said\ninformation.\n\n31. As noticed above, the seventh grievance is a general\ngrievance in relation to which there can be no general\ndirection. However, all the other grievances raised by the\nrespondent stem out of her primary submission that Clauses 13\n& 3 of the VRS/settlement do not bind her. As aforesaid, these\nare grievances which cannot be remedied under\nSection 33-\n\nC(2) of the Act and the respondent would have to, if she is so\nadvised, seek a reference of the said disputes under\nSection 10\n\nof the Act.\n\n32. Accordingly, I dispose of this petition in the aforesaid\nterms with the direction that the CGIT shall examine the claim\nfor production of documents by the petitioner in the light\nthereof.\"\n\n11. The aforesaid judgment dated 01.02.2013 in W.P.(C.) No.5832/2012\nwas placed before the CGIT on 07.02.2013. Thereafter, the impugned order\nhas come to be passed. I consider it appropriate to reproduce the impugned\norder in its entirety. The same reads as follows:\n\n\"Information is furnished by the management to the claimant,\nin pursuance of order dated 01.02.2013 passed by High Court\nof Delhi. Shri Gupta presents that on supply of the above\ninformation, nothing remains to be computed in terms of money\nin favour of the claimant. Shri Sharma dispels the submissions.\nI have gone through the petition, moved under\nsection 33-C(2)\n\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the Act), written\nstatement filed by the management and order dated 01.02.2013\npassed by High Court of Delhi. In the claim statement in\ngrievance No. 4 a claim is made for revision of pension, on\nenhancement of pay in terms of clause (5) of 7th Bipartite\nSettlement. Enhancement of pay of the claimant, with\nretrospective effect, is not a matter of dispute. Arrears have\nalready been paid. But her pension was not enhanced. In its\n\nPage 7 of 22\n\nwritten statement, the management claims that such a claim\nrequires adjudication, which is not permissible under the\nprovisions of\nsection 33-C (2)\nof the Act.\n\nIn its order dated 1.2.2013 High Court of Delhi considered the\nissue as to what information is to be furnished by the\nmanagement to the claimant. The High Court was hearing a\nwrit petition against the order dated 19.07.2012, on the\nstrength of which this Tribunal commanded the management to\nproduce documents, detailed in that order. During the hearing\nof that petition, the High Court considered the petition under\n\nsection 33-C (2)\nof the Act and written statement filed by the\nmanagement. Scope of powers of this Tribunal, while dealing\nwith a petition under\nsection 33-C (2)\nof the Act was also noted\nby the High Court. There is no two opinion that a workman\ncannot put forward a claim in a petition under\nsection 33-C (2)\n\nof the Act, which is not based on an existing right, that is to say\nalready adjudicated upon or provided for and must arise in the\ncourse of and in relation to the relationship between an\nindustrial workman and his employer.\n\nWhile adjudicating the writ petition, the High Court noted\nthat since claim for revision of pension was disputed one it\ncannot be adjudicated in the present petition, moved under\n\nsection 33-C (2)\nof the Act. For reaching that conclusion, the\nHigh Court noted the facts projected before it by the\nmanagement. Wrong facts were placed before the High Court\nby the management with a view to mislead the Court. In para\n18 of the petition, the claimant gives the list of the persons,\nwhose pension was revised by the management despite the fact\nthat they also took VRS under the very scheme, which was\nopted by the petitioner/claimant. In its written statement, the\nmanagement adopted an eerie silence on those facts. The\nmanagement opted not to speak about the case of those seven\nemployees who sought VRS under the scheme and\nsubsequently their pension was revised. By its stand taken,\nthe management is deemed to have admitted those facts.\nWhen these facts are taken into consideration, it emerges that\n\nPage 8 of 22\n\nthe claim of \"revision of pension\" was already provided for.\nThe High Court was misled when it recorded facts, in the\nabove order, to the effect that claim for revision of pension\nwas disputed one.\nIn order\n,\nreferred above\n, reasoning detailed\nwas based on wrong facts, placed by the management.\nTherefore, it is apparent that claim of \"revision of pension\" is\nalready provided for and falls within the ambit of\nsection 33-C\n(2)\nof the Act. Hence submissions of Shri Gupta, that nothing\nremains to be adjudicated in the matter, are uncalled for.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12. The submission of Mr. Bansal, learned counsel for the petitioner is\nthat the impugned order flies in face of the inter partes judgment of this\ncourt dated 01.02.2013, which has attained finality as the parties have\naccepted the same. He submits that the impugned order is completely\ncontrary to the judgment of this court, whereby this court had allowed the\ntribunal to proceed only in respect of two aspects of the respondents\ngrievances, which stemmed out of the settlement between the parties. The\nfirst was with regard to the respondent seeking information about the\ndetailed breakup of the amount paid by the petitioner at the time when she\nwas granted VRS, and the second was in relation to the manner in which\nTDS had been deducted from the amount already paid to the respondent, or\nbeing paid to her. It is only in respect of these two aspects that the court had\nheld that the proceedings under\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act were\nmaintainable. In respect of all other grievances and claims, this court had\nconcluded that those grievances and claims could not be raised in\nproceedings under\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act, since the said grievances and\nclaims required adjudication, whereas the proceedings under\nsection 33C(2)\n\nof the Act are in the nature of execution proceedings.\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\n13. Mr. Bansal submits that, with a view to overreach the judgment of this\ncourt, the CGIT has observed that \"wrong facts were placed before the High\nCourt by the management with a view to mislead the court\". The CGIT\nfurther observed that in para 18 of the claim petition preferred by the\nrespondent under\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act, the claimant has given the list\nof persons whose pension was revised by the management despite the fact\nthat they also took VRS under the very same scheme which was opted for by\nthe respondent/claimant. Learned counsel submits that it was not for the\nCGIT to conclude that any wrong facts were placed before this court or\naccepted by this court, while rendering its decision on 01.02.2013 in\nW.P.(C.) No.5832/2012. The said judgment was passed after hearing the\ncounsel for both sides, and the parties had accepted the decision of this\nCourt. The respondent had not assailed the decision dated 01.02.2013 either\nin review or in appeal, much less on the ground that this Court had been\n\"misled\" by the Petitioner into giving\nthe said decision\n.\n\n14. Mr. Bansal submits that assuming that the respondent was not\nsatisfied with the judgment dated 01.02.2013 in W.P.(C.) No.5832/2012, it\nwas for the respondent to assail\nthe said judgment\nin appeal. The respondent\naccepted\nthe said decision\n, and did not assail the same. Learned counsel\npoints out that this court has specifically dealt with the grievance of the\nrespondent of her being discriminated in para 26 of the judgment dated\n01.02.2013, by observing:\n\n\"Having heard learned counsel for the parties, I am of the view\nthat the grievance of the petitioner with regard to the\nmaintainability of the respondent's petition under\nSection 33-\n\nC(2) largely is well-founded. What the respondent is seeking by\n\nPage 10 of 22\n\nfiling the said petition, primarily, is to seek the annulment of the\nterms & conditions of the VRS/settlement - particularly Clause\n13 and Clause 3 of the General Terms & Conditions, as set out\nhereinabove. The respondent is seeking the said annulment,\ninter alia, on the basis of subsequent Bipartite Settlement,\nwhereby the pay scales were revised retrospectively from the\ndate when the respondent was still in service. As to whether or\nnot the mere revision of pay scale and payment of arrears of\npay, gratuity and provident fund would also call for revision of\npension - particularly in the face of Clause 13 and Clause 3 of\nthe General Terms & Conditions as extracted above, is an issue\nwhich would need adjudication. Similarly, whether there is\ndiscrimination and, if so, whether it is actionable, are issues\nwhich require adjudication. So as not to prejudice the case of\neither of the parties, this Court is refraining from making any\ncomment on the same at this stage. However, there can be no\ndoubt that the relief sought by the respondent is premised on\nthe annulment of Clause 13 and Clause 3, as aforesaid. In the\nteeth of these clauses, the relief of revision of pension certainly\ncannot be granted. The said dispute raised by the respondent\nwould require independent adjudication. The respondent has\nitself stated in her petition that Clause 3 has become redundant\nin view of her submissions made in the petition. This clearly\nshows that the respondent is seeking to justify her claim not on\nthe terms & conditions of the settlement, but de hors and, rather\ncontrary to the said terms & conditions. The aforesaid issues\nraised by the respondent can certainly not be said to be\nincidental to the VRS/settlement between the parties. It cannot\nbe said that the respondent is merely seeking to execute or\nenforce the settlement through the process under\nSection 33-\n\nC(2) of the Act. The respondent is, in fact, seeking to establish\nher right to relief by raising the aforesaid issues and is also\nseeking the determination of the issue of the petitioner's\ncorresponding liability. These are well beyond the scope of an\nincidental enquiry that may be undertaken in enforcement or\nexecution proceedings in respect of a pre-determined right in a\nsettlement or adjudication.\"\n\nPage 11 of 22\n\n15. Mr. Bansal points out that the observations made by the CGIT that in\nits written statement the petitioner management had adopted an eerie silence\nin respect of the allegation of the discrimination are also contrary to the\nrecord. Reference has been made to the written statement of the petitioner\nmanagement filed before the CGIT and in particular para 2 of the\npreliminary objections and the parawise reply to para 5.4. Para 2 of the\npreliminary objections reads as follows:\n\n\"It may further be noted that at the time when VRS Scheme was\nimplemented, some of the employees who opted for VRS were\nalready vested with the right of pension and some of the\nemployees who opted for VRS were not vested with the right of\npension. All such employees who were vested with the right of\npension at the time of VRS and when granted VRS are enjoying\nthe benefit of revision of pension, as well, but, the employees\nwho were not vested with pension but were still given the\npensionary benefits by way of the terms of VRS, will not be\nentitled for any revision or other benefits. A complete reading\nof the scheme of VRS will make it abundantly clear that the\nemployees who were not vested with the right of pension should\nnot have claimed the re-computation or revision of the pension\nat any future date or time.\"\n\n16. The relevant extract from para 5.4 of the parawise reply reads as\nfollows:\n\n\"The details of the various individuals which have been given\nvide para 5.4, and the amounts mentioned against them are\nincorrect and not borne out by records. No such amount, as\nindicated, was paid to them and moreover, these persons are\ndifferently placed than the petitioner. Therefore, the element of\ndiscrimination which is being raised is misplaced and without\nany basis. The amounts mentioned against each one of them\nare not admitted to be correct.\"\n\nPage 12 of 22\n\n17. Mr. Bansal points out that there was no basis for the CGIT to\nobserve that the management did not speak about the case of the seven\nemployees who sought VRS under the scheme and subsequently their\npension was revised. There was no basis to conclude that the reasoning was\nbased on wrong facts alleged by the respondent/claimant. In any event, once\nthis court had confined the scope of the enquiry before the CGIT under\n\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act, it was not open to the tribunal to expand the scope\non its own. Learned counsel submits that in the second last paragraph of the\nimpugned order, once again the tribunal has observed that \"the High Court\nwas misled when it recorded facts, in the above order, to the effect that\nclaim for revision of pension was disputed one. In order\n,\nreferred above\n,\nreasoning detailed was based on wrong facts, placed by the management.\"\n\n18. Mr. Bansal also submits that the conduct of the CGIT in passing the\nimpugned order tantamounts to criminal contempt as defined in\nsection 2(c)\n\nof the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, (CCA in short) which is, inter alia,\ndefined to mean doing of any act whatsoever which interferes or tends to\ninterfere with or obstruct or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in\nany manner.\n\n19. Mr. Bansal submits that under\nsection 16\nof the CCA, a judge,\nmagistrate or any person acting judicially shall also be liable for contempt of\nhis own court, or any other court in the same manner as any other individual\nis liable under the provisions of the CCA, as far as applicable.\n\n20. Mr. Bansal submits that the impugned order is a result of blatant and\nconscious disobedience of the judgment of this court by the CGIT. Despite\n\nPage 13 of 22\n\na clear direction of this court to limit the scope of enquiry under\nsection\n33C(2)\nof the Act to only two aspects, the CGIT has sought to expand its\nscope, even though this court had disapproved of the earlier action of the\nCGIT in undertaking an enquiry into aspects which fell beyond its scope\nunder\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act. Learned counsel submits that the conduct\nof the CGIT is such is to mar the rule of law and the discipline that all\nsubordinate Courts and tribunals are bound to follow by obeying the orders\nand judgments passed by this court. He submits that under\nArticle 227\nof\nthe Constitution, this court exercises superintendence and supervisory\njurisdiction over all courts and tribunals which are subordinate to it, which\nincludes the CGIT.\n\n21. Mr. Bansal has also drawn my attention to\nArticle 215\nof the\nConstitution which states that every High Court shall be a court of record,\nand shall have all powers of such court, including powers to punish for\ncontempt of itself.\nIn this regard, reliance is placed on the decision of this\ncourt in\nDeepak Khosla v. Union of India & Ors.\n, 173 (2010) DLT 41\n(DB). He submits that by virtue of\nsection 15\nof the CCA, this court can\ntake action on its own motion as well, in the case of criminal contempt. He\nsubmits that this court should, while disposing of the writ petition on merits,\nafter taking cognizance of the contempt committed by the Tribunal, refer the\ncriminal contempt committed by the tribunal to a Division Bench of this\ncourt.\n\n22. Mr. Bansal has also referred to several decisions in support of his\naforesaid submissions. He has drawn my attention to Sh. Baradakanta\nMishra v. Sh. Bhinsen Sen Dixit, AIR 1972 SC 2266, where the Supreme\n\nPage 14 of 22\n\nCourt quoted the extract from the earlier decision in\nEast India Commercial\nCo. Ltd. v. The Collector of Customs, Calcutta\n, AIR 1962 SC 1893. Mr.\nBansal has specifically relied upon the following extract from the said\nquotation:\n\n\"It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal over which\nthe High Court has superintendence can ignore the law\ndeclared by that court and start proceedings in direct violation\nof it. If a tribunal can do so, all the subordinate courts can\nequally do so, for there is no specific provision, just like in the\ncase of Supreme Court, making the law declared by the High\nCourt binding on subordinate courts. It is implicit in the power\nof supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that all the\ntribunals subject to its supervision should conform to the law\n\nlaid down by\nit. Such obedience would also be conducive to\ntheir smooth working; otherwise there would be confusion in\nthe administration of law and respect for law would\nirretrievably suffer.\"\n\n23. The Supreme Court proceeded to observe as follows in\nthe said\ndecision\n:\n\n\"17. Our view that a deliberate and a mala fide conduct of not\nfollowing the binding precedent of the High Court is\ncontumacious does not unduly enlarge the domain of contempt.\nIt would not stifle a bona fide act of distinguishing the binding\nprecedent, even though it may turn out to be mistaken .\"\n\n24. Mr. Bansal submits that the Supreme Court has held in B.K. Brar v.\nHon'ble the Chief Justice & his companion Judges of the Orissa High\nCourt & Ors., AIR 1961 SC 1367 that to constitute contempt of court, it is\nnecessary to show that the subordinate court intentionally disobeyed the\norder of the superior court. Mr. Bansal submits that disobedience of the\njudgment of this court by the CGIT is clearly intentional, since the CGIT\n\nPage 15 of 22\n\nwas aware and discusses\nthe said decision\nin the impugned order. Despite it\nbeing clearly directed that the enquiry under\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act shall\nbe restricted only to two aspects, the CGIT seeks to enlarge the scope of the\nsaid proceedings by labelling the submission of the petitioner before this\ncourt as misleading and by observing that this court had been misled. He\nsubmits that the present is not a case where the CGIT was not aware of the\njudgment of this court or that there was any scope for any doubt about the\ninterpretation of\nthe said judgment\n.\n\n25. Mr. Bansal has also placed reliance on the decision of the Madras\nHigh Court in B. Ramalingam - suo motu contempt petition No.782/2005,\n2006 (1) CCC 165 (Mad). After referring to several decisions of the\nSupreme Court and the High Courts, the Division Bench issued the\nfollowing directions:\n\n\"24. The following are the directions:\n\n(I) When a position, in law, is well settled as a result of\njudicial pronouncement of this Court, it would amount to\njudicial impropriety to say the least, for the subordinate\nCourts to ignore the settled decisions rendered by High Courts\nand the Supreme Court and then to pass a judicial order which\nis clearly contrary to the settled legal position. Such judicial\nadventurism should be avoided.\n\n(II) Judicial restraint and discipline are as necessary to\nthe orderly administration of justice as they are to the\neffectiveness of the army. The duty of restraint, the humility\nof function should be a constant theme of Judges. Judicial\nrestraint in this regard might better be called judicial\nrespect; that is, respect by the judiciary.\n\n(III) If subordinate judiciary refuses to carry out the\n\nPage 16 of 22\n\ndirections given to it by the superior judiciary in the\nexercise of its appellate or revisional powers, the result will be\nchaos in the administration of justice. The appellate\njurisdiction inherently carries with it a power to issue\ncorrective directions binding on the forum below. Failure on\nthe part of latter to carry out the directions or show disrespect\nto the propriety of such directions would be destructive\nhierarchical system in administration of justice. The seekers of\njustice and the society would lose faith in both. The\nsubordinate judiciary must bear in mind for ever.\n\n(IV) Any discourtesy shown by the subordinate Courts to a\nsuperior Court is bound to involve them in proceedings for\ncontempt. No subordinate Court is entitled to demand of\nthe superior Court the law under which the order has been\npassed before complying with it. They should strictly comply\nwith the order of High Court and Supreme Court both in\nletter and spirit. It must be understood by all concerned that\nany discourtesy or disobedience shown to the orders of\nsuperior courts will be visited by this Court with the severest\npenalties.\n\n(V) In the hierarchical judicial system, it is not for any\nsubordinate court to tell a superior court as to how a matter\nshould be decided when an appeal is taken against its decision\nto that superior court. Such a course would be subversive of\njudicial discipline on the bedrock of which the judicial system is\nfounded and finality is attached and orders are obeyed.\n\n(VI) Judicial system requires that clear pronouncements by\nthe High Court, about what the law on a matter is, must be\ntreated as binding on all the subordinate courts. Where the\nHigh Court has stated that the law\nlaid down in\na particular\ncase is the applicable law, it is not open to the subordinate\ncourt to consider or rely on any supposedly conflicting\ndecisions from any other High Court, our High Court's decision\nis binding on all the subordinate judiciary in Tamil Nadu and\nPondicherry.\"\n\nPage 17 of 22\n\n26. Mr. Bansal submits that by passing the impugned order, the CGIT has\nmade a mockery of judicial process, which would have its pernicious\ninfluence beyond the parties, and affect the interest of the public in the\nadministration of justice. He places reliance on the following observation\nmade by the Supreme Court in\nAdvocate General, State of Bihar v. Madhya\nPradesh Khair Industries & Anr.\n, (1980) 3 SCC 311:\n\n\"While we are conscious that every abuse of the process of the\ncourt may not necessarily amount to contempt of court, abuse\nof the process of the court calculated to hamper the due course\nof a judicial proceeding or the orderly administration of justice,\nwe must say, is a contempt of court. It may be that certain\nminor abuses of the process of the court may be suitably dealt\nwith as between the parties, by striking out pleadings under the\nprovisions of Order 6 Rule 16 or in some other manner. But, on\nthe other hand, it may be necessary to punish as a contempt, a\ncourse of conduct which abuses and makes a mockery of the\njudicial process and which thus extends its pernicious influence\nbeyond the parties to the action and effects the interest of the\npublic in the administration of justice. The public have an\ninterest, an abiding and a real interest, and a vital stake in the\neffective and orderly administration of justice, because, unless\njustice is so administered, there is the peril of all rights and\nliberties perishing. The court has the duty of protecting the\ninterest of the public in the due administration of justice and,\nso, it is entrusted with the power to commit for contempt of\ncourt, not in order to protect the dignity of the court against\ninsult or injury as the expression \"Contempt of Court\" may\nseem to suggest, but, to protect and to vindicate the right of the\npublic that the administration of justice shall not be prevented,\nprejudiced, obstructed or interfered with. \"It is a mode of\nvindicating the majesty of law, in its active manifestation\nagainst obstruction and outrage.\" [ Per Frankfurter, J. in\nOffutt v. U.S.(1954) 345 US 11] \"The law should not be seen to\nsit by limply, while those who defy it go free, and those who\nseek its protection lose hope.\"\n\nPage 18 of 22\n\n27. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents has sought to\njustify the impugned order primarily by seeking to reargue the scope of\n\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act which already stands adjudicated finally inter se,\nthe parties vide judgment dated 01.02.2013. The submission of learned\ncounsel for the respondent is that the claim for revision of pension arises out\nof the eighth bipartite settlement and, therefore, it requires no further\nadjudication. He has also tendered in court a compilation of judgments of\nwhich he has only referred to the first judgment in the case of Tata Iron &\nSteel Co. Ltd. v. CGIT, Dhanbad & Ors., 1966 1 LLJ 759, where the High\nCourt had held that on the question, as to whether the tribunal should not\nhave disposed of the application on merits under Rule 22 of the Central\nRules was a question of the discretion of the tribunal, and the High Court in\nexercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nand\nof the\nConstitution, does not interfere with the exercise of that discretion by the\nlower courts or tribunals.\n\n28. Having heard learned counsels for the parties, perused the impugned\naward and the judgment of this court in WPC No.5838/2012 dated\n01.02.2013, it is abundantly clear to me that the impugned order is patently\nlaconic and cannot stand scrutiny even for a moment. I have already\nextracted herein above the relevant extract from the decision dated\n01.02.2013. The said decision shows that the court was conscious of and\napplied its mind to the aspect whether the claim for revision of pension on\naccount of retrospective revision of pay scale and payment of arrears,\ngratuity and provident fund could be dealt with in proceedings under\nsection\n33C(2)\nof the Act, or not. The court had observed that the said aspect would\n\nPage 19 of 22\n\nneed adjudication, particularly in the face of clauses 13 and 3 of the general\nterms and conditions. Pertinently, the respondent had claimed in its\napplication under\nsection 33C(2)\nof the Act that clause 3 had become\nredundant in view of her submission made in the application/petition.\nTherefore, this court had come to the conclusion that it could not be said that\nby raising the claim for revision, the respondent was merely seeking to\nexecute or enforce the settlement through the proceedings under\nsection\n33C(2)\nof the Act. This court had concluded that the respondent was\nseeking to establish her right to relief by raising, inter alia, the aforesaid\naspect of revision of pension and also seeking determination of the issue of\npetitioners corresponding liability.\n\n29. In the face of the clear findings returned by this court, which have\nbeen accepted by the respondent inasmuch, as, the respondent did not chose\nto challenge the judgment dated 01.02.2013, it did not lie in the mouth of the\nrespondent, much less the tribunal, to claim that the petitioner had misled\nthis court or that this court had been misled into returning the said finding.\nWhether, or not, this court had been misled or erred in returning its decision\ncould not have been examined by the tribunal, or pronounced upon as done\nby it. The said issue could have been raised only in an appeal before a\nhigher forum. What the CGIT has done is to sit in judgment over the\ndecision dated 01.02.2013; conclude that the same is a result of the court\nbeing misled, and; to blatantly disregard the same.\n\n30. I also find merit in the petitioners submission that the CGIT while\npassing the impugned award has erred on record since it has been observed\nthat the petitioner has maintained an eerie silence, even though that is not\n\nPage 20 of 22\n\nthe position on facts.\n\n31. It is not open to the respondent to seek to reopen the issues concluded\nby the judgment dated 01.02.2013 in the process of defending the impugned\norder as sought to be done by her. I, therefore, reject the submission of\nlearned counsel for the respondent that the claim for revision of pension\nstemmed out of the bipartite agreement, and that it required no further\nadjudication and it merely required re-computation.\n\n32. Reliance placed on the decision in Tata Iron & Steel (supra) has no\nrelevance whatsoever. The court, in that case, was primarily dealing with\nthe issue whether the tribunal had the jurisdiction to dismiss the application\nof the employer under\nsection 33(2)(b)\nof the Act for non prosecution, if the\nemployer is not present on date on which it is fixed for hearing. The further\nquestion examined by the court was; when that where tribunal has exercised\nsuch jurisdiction, whether the High Court would be justified in interfering\nwith exercise of such discretion under\nArticle 226\nand\n227.\n\n33. It is well settled that while exercising its writ jurisdiction, this court\ndoes not sit as an appellate forum to undertake judicial review of quasi\njudicial orders. However, it does not preclude this court from exercising its\njurisdiction to interfere with the orders passed by the tribunal and quasi\njudicial bodies where it appears to the court that the tribunal has, inter alia,\nacted beyond its jurisdiction.\n\n34. The present is clearly a case where the tribunal has exceeded its\njurisdiction and, therefore, interference by this court would not only be\njustified but is also called for with a view to keep the tribunal in check,\n\nPage 21 of 22\n\nmaintain the rule of law and in the interest of justice. Accordingly, the\nimpugned order is quashed and set aside. The writ petitions stand disposed\nof.\n\n35. The conduct of Dr. R.K. Yadav CGIT who has passed the impugned\norder, prima facie, appears to be contumacious in the light of several\ndecisions relied upon by the petitioner. Prima Facie, it appears that his\nconduct not only amounts to civil contempt inasmuch, as, it appears to be\nwilful disobedience of the judgment of this court aforesaid, but also amount\nto criminal contempt since his conduct may amount to interference with the\nadministration of justice.\n\n36. I would not like, at this stage, to dwell on this aspect in any greater\ndetail, since I consider it appropriate to issue notice to Dr. R.K. Yadav,\nPresiding Officer, CGIT, requiring him to show cause as to why proceedings\nfor contempt of the decision dated 01.02.2013 in WP (C) No. 5832/2012 be\nnot initiated against him. The Registry is directed to appropriately open a\nfresh file with the title \"Court of its own Motion V. Dr. R. K. Yadav Central\nGovernment Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court No. 1, New Delhi\" and\nnumber the same. A copy of the decision dated 01.02.2013 in WP (C)\n5832/2012 and the order dated 14.03.2013 passed by Dr. R. K. Yadav be\nplaced in the said file along with this order, and the same be also served\nupon him. The notice be made returnable on 26.08.2013. The Contempt\npetition be placed before the appropriate bench as per roster, subject to\norders of Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice.\n\nVIPIN SANGHI, J.\n\nJULY 17, 2013 sr\n\nPage 22 of 22",

THE PETITIONER HAS PREFERRED THE PRESENT WRIT PETITION TO ASSAIL THE ORDER DATED 14.03.2013 PASSED BY THE PRESIDING OFFICER DR. R.K. YADAV OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL CUM LABOUR COURT I, NEW DELHI (CGIT/TRIBUNAL).  2. A LITTLE BACKGROUND OF THE RELEVANT FACTS IS NECESSARY. THE RESPONDENT WAS EMPLOYED WITH THE PETITIONER ON 01.11.1978. THE PETITIONER CAME OUT WITH A VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT SCHEME (VRS) ON 01.07.2003. THE RESPONDENT OPTED FOR VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT UNDER THE SAID SCHEME AND WAS RELIEVED FROM  PAGE 1 OF 22  SERVICE ON 31.08.2003.  3. THE LUMP SUM AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THE RESPONDENT WAS PAID BY THE PETITIONER BANK. SHE HAS ALSO BEEN RECEIVING HER PENSION FROM THE PETITIONER. MUCH AFTER THE RESPONDENT HAD SEVERED HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PETITIONER BANK, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PETITIONER BANK ENTERED INTO A BIPARTITE SETTLEMENT WITH THE EMPLOYEES ON 02.06.2005. HOWEVER, THE SAME WAS APPLICABLE W.E.F. 01.11.2002. ACCORDINGLY, THE PETITIONER BANK PAID THE ARREARS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALARY ALREADY RECEIVED BY THE RESPONDENT AND THE REVISED SALARY, AS WELL AS THE COMPONENT OF GRATUITY AND PROVIDENT FUND ON THE BASIS OF THE REVISED SALARY. HOWEVER, THE RESPONDENT WAS NOT GRANTED ANY REVISION OF PENSION, OR ARREARS ON THAT ACCOUNT WHICH IS WHAT LEAD HER TO PREFER HER PETITION UNDER SECTION 33-C (2) OF THE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ACT, 1947 (THE ACT ) BEFORE THE CGIT.  4. THE PETITIONER RAISED THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION TO THE MAINTAINABILITY OF THE SAID PETITION ON THE GROUND THAT THERE WAS NO PRE-EXISTING RIGHT ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE SAID PETITION HAD BEEN PREFERRED. IT WAS CLAIMED THAT FOR A PETITION TO BE MAINTAINABLE UNDER SECTION 33-C(2) OF THE ACT, IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THERE EXISTED A PRIOR ADJUDICATION OR SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM. THE CGIT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS AN ADJUDICATING AUTHORITY WHILE DEALING WITH A PETITION UNDER SECTION 33C(2) . RATHER, IT FUNCTIONS LIKE AN EXECUTING COURT. THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION RAISED BY THE PETITIONER BEFORE THE CGIT WAS THAT THE RESPONDENT WAS SEEKING TO RE-WRITE THE TERMS OF THE VRS OFFERED BY THE PETITIONER BANK IN THE YEAR 2003 UNDER WHICH THE RESPONDENT HAD DERIVED THE BENEFITS. IT WAS SUBMITTED THAT THE CGIT, IN ANY CASE, COULD NOT HAVE ADJUDICATED UPON THE SAID CLAIM UNDER SECTION 33C(2) .  PAGE 2 OF 22  5. THE CGIT FRAMED THE ISSUES ON 14.11.2011. AFTER FRAMING THREE ISSUES, THE CGIT OBSERVED AS FOLLOWS:  \"ON THE WRITTEN STATEMENT, OBJECTIONS ARE TAKEN THAT CLAIMS UNDER VARIOUS HEADS ARE NOT BASED ON EXISTING RIGHTS. THOSE OBJECTIONS ARE INCIDENTAL TO ISSUE NO.1 AND WOULD BE ADJUDICATED WHILE ANSWERING THAT ISSUE. THE MANAGEMENT MAY RAISE THOSE PROPOSITIONS AT THE TIME OF ARGUMENTS AND NO ISSUE IS REQUIRED TO BE SETTLED ON THOSE OBJECTIONS.\"  THEREAFTER THE MATTER WAS ADJOURNED FOR EVIDENCE BEING LED BY THE PARTIES."
