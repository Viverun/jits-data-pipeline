Bhattacharyya\n\nFor the Respondent bank : Mr. Sakti Nath Mukherjee\nMr. L. K. Gupta\nMr. Saptangshu Basu\n\nFor the Respondent Nos.5 to 16 : Mr. Swapan Kumar Dutta\nMr. Dipankar Das Gupta\nMr. Anirban Pramanick\n\nHeard On: 24.04.2008 & 05.05.2008.\n\nJudgment On: 16.05.2008.\nPRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.\n\nThe scale-I officers (JMG) of the respondent bank filed a\n\nwrit petition before this Court challenging the promotion process\n\nin respect of promotion to Scale-II. The aforesaid promotion is\n\ngoverned by the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of\n\nOfficers and other Employees) Rules, 1998 framed under the\n\nRegional Rural Banks Act, 1976\n.\n\nThe real grievances of the writ petitioners is that the\n\nselection for promotion has been virtually made on the basis of\n\nmerit-cum-seniority in violation of the specific rule prescribed\n\nfor the promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. The\n\naforesaid contentions made on behalf of the writ petitioners did\n\nnot find favour with the learned Single Judge of the trial court\n\nand the writ petition was dismissed by the said learned Single\n\nJudge by the judgment and order under appeal.\n\nThe instant appeal has been preferred at the instance of the\n\nsaid writ petitioners assailing the judgment and order under\n\nappeal whereby and whereunder the writ petition filed by the\n\nappellants herein was dismissed on merits.\n\nFor the purpose of adjudication of the issues raised in this\n\nappeal, relevant provisions of the Regional Rural Banks\n\n(Appointment and Promotion of Officers and other Employees) Rules,\n\n1998 are required to be taken into consideration. The basis of\n\npromotion to the post of Scale-II officer and the mode of\n\nselection have been provided in Clause 2 of Third Schedule of the\n\naforesaid Promotion Rules of 1998. Clause 2(d) of the aforesaid\n\nThird Schedule to the Promotion Rules, 1998 speaks of promotion to\n\nthe post of Scale-II officer on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nThe mode of selection, however, has been prescribed in Clause 2(f)\n\nof the said Third Schedule. The composition of committee for\n\nconsidering the Commission has been mentioned in Clause 2(g). The\n\nselection process for promotion has been mentioned in Clause 2(j)\n\nof Third Schedule.\n\nFor proper appreciation, aforesaid Clauses of Third Schedule\n\nare set out hereunder:\n\n\" 2 (d) Whether promotion to be: Promotion shall be made on\nmade on seniority basis or the basis of\nseniority-cum-seniority-cum-basis. merit.\n\n(f) Mode of Selection: The selection of the candidate\nshall be made by the committee on the basis\nof written test, interview and assessment of Performance\nAppraisal Reports for the preceding five years as an\nofficer in scale-I/Field Supervisor.\n\n(g) Composition of Committee: The committee (for\nconsider-ing promotion) shall consistof the following persons,\n\nnamely -\n\ni) The Chairman of the concerned Regional Rural\nBank-Chairman\n\nii) A director nominated by the Sponsor Bank-Member\n\niii) A director nominated by the National Bank-Member\n\nNote : If none of the members of the Committee\nbelongs to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, the\nBoard may nominate a person belonging to Schedules\nCaste/Schedules Tribes as an additional member and\nsuch person shall participate in the process of\nselection by the concerned Committee.\n\n(j) Selection Process for Promotion : The selection\nshall be on the basis of Performance in the\nwritten test, interview and\nPerformance Appraisal Reports\nfor preceding five years as\nper the division of marks given\nbelow :\nA) Written Test : 60 marks\nB) Interview : 20 marks\n\nC) Performance Appraisal Reports : 20 marks\n\nTotal Marks : 100 marks\n\nA) Written test: The candidates shall be require to\n( 60 marks) appear for written test comprising\nof two parts viz. Part (A)covering\nBanking Law and Practice of\nBanking and Part(B)covering Credit\nPolicy, Credit Management including\nPriority Sector, Economics and\nManagement.\n\n60 marks allotted to written test\nshall be further divided as under:\n\nPart 'A'\n30 marks\nPart 'B'\n30 marks\nA list of only those candidates,\nwho secure a minimum of 40% marks\nin each part shall be prepared and\nsuch candidates shall be called for\ninterview.\n\nB) Interview (20 marks): There shall be no minimum\nqualify-ing marks for the interview.\n\nC) Performance appraisal: Performance Appraisal\nReports for Reports (20 marks)the preceding five years shall be\nconsidered for the purpose of\nawarding marks for promotion.\"\n\nThirteen vacancies for Scale-II officers were notified by the\n\nbank and in terms of Clause 2(i) of the Third Schedule, 52\n\ncandidates were identified to fall in the zone of consideration.\n\nOut of the aforesaid 52 candidates, 26 including the appellants\n\nherein qualified in the written test. Thereafter, all the\n\naforesaid 26 candidates including the appellants herein who\n\nqualified in the written test were asked to appear at the\n\ninterview. In the said interview following factors were taken into\n\nconsideration in respect of each one of the candidates:\n\ni) Marks secured in the written test\n\nii) Marks secured in the performance appraisal\n\niii) Marks secured in the interview\n\nThe management of the bank published the result of the\n\naforesaid 26 candidates who have qualified in the written test\n\nafter taking into account the marks of the written test of the\n\nrespective candidates once again along with the marks obtained in\n\nviva-voce test and performance appraisal. Unfortunately, although\n\nthe appellant No. 1 is senior to all the private respondents,\nexcept the private respondent No. 4 and the appellant Nos. 2 and 3\n\nare senior to private respondent Nos. 8 to 16, they have been\n\ndeclared as failed. According to the appellants, there is no scope\n\nto declare any candidate passed or failed since no Benchmark was\n\nprescribed in the Promotion Rules of 1998 for interview and\n\nperformance appraisal. The learned Counsel of the appellants\n\nfurther submits that the management of the bank by superseding the\n\nappellants herein have given promotion to the private respondents\n\nwithout following the principle of seniority-cum-merit. It has\n\nbeen specifically urged on behalf of the appellants herein that\n\nthe comparative assessment of merits of the candidates is not at\n\nall permissible while selection for promotion is made following\n\nthe policy of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nMr. Saktinath Mukherjee, learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nthe respondent bank submits that the authorities of the bank are\n\nunder the obligation and duty bound to follow the rules in its\n\ntotality and any particular rule has to be construed in the\n\ncontext of the entire rule. The learned Senior Counsel of the\n\nrespondent bank, however, admits that there may be an apparent\n\ninconsistency between Clause 2(d) on the one hand and Clauses 2(f)\n\nand (j) on the other hand. Undisputedly, Clause 2(d) provides\n\nseniority-cum-merit formula and Clauses 2(f) and (j) provide for\n\nassessment of merits of the candidates. The learned Senior Counsel\nof the respondent bank further submits that the rule of\n\nconstruction in case of an apparent inconsistency is that a head-\n\non collision of the different Rules should be avoided and an\n\nendeavour should be made for harmonious construction of the\n\nstatutory rules in order to resolve the inconsistency in respect\n\nof the statutory rules.\n\nIt has also been argued on behalf of the respondent bank that\n\nthere is no challenge to the procedure prescribed in the Rules. We\n\nare, however, not very much impressed by the aforesaid argument as\n\nthe appellants/writ petitioners have specifically challenged the\n\nselection procedure on the ground that the same is contrary to\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule which provides for selection on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nThe principal question to be decided in this appeal is,\n\nwhether the respondent bank while following the prescribed\n\nprocedure for selecting candidates for promotion to the post of\n\nScale-II officer really followed the principle of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit as specifically provided in the promotion rules.\n\nThe learned Senior Counsel representing the appellants\n\nsubmits that the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion\n\nof Officers and other Employees) Rules, 1998 made it clear that\nthe promotion to the posts of Scale-II officers should be made on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit but the selection process for\n\nsuch promotion as provided by the said Rules of 1998 is not in\n\nconsonance with the aforesaid policy. The aforesaid inconsistency\n\nhas also been admitted by the learned Senior Counsel representing\n\nthe respondent bank.\n\nTherefore, it is to be decided whether the bank should follow\n\nthe selection process for promotion as provided in the Rules of\n\n1998 even though such selection is in violation and/or\n\ninconsistent with the promotion policy based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit.\n\nThe learned Single Judge following the earlier judgment\n\ndelivered by another Hon'ble Single Judge of this Court in W.P.\n\nNo. 8066 (W) of 1999 (Pradip Kumar Sarkar vs. Murshidabad Gramin\n\nBank and Ors.) held as hereunder:\n\n\"16. Before going to the next point, it is relevant to\ntake note that the 1998 Rules, in effect, postulates\nthat promotion to be given thereunder is actually based\non merit-cum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit. This\nview has found support in a judgment delivered by\nanother Hon'ble Judge of this Court in W.P. 8066(W) of\n1999 (Pradip Kumar Sarkar and Ors. Vs. Murshidabad\nGramin Bank and Ors. by judgment delivered on 2.4.01).\nIn the said judgment, it has been held that although\nunder Rule 2(d) it has been stipulated that promotion is\nto be given on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, but in\neffect, it is merit-cum-seniority. The learned Single\nJudge has also held that Clause 2(d) has to be read as\nmerit-cum-seniority within the definition of the said\nphraseology. The relevant paragraphs of the said\njudgment are to be found at Pages 6 and 9 to 11 thereof\nand, they are accordingly reproduced hereunder as\nfollows:\n\nPage-6 (top)\n' With regard to the second ground Mr. Sanyal\nhas submitted that the relevant Standing Order\nbeing Standing Order No. 642 E dated July 29,\n1998, if read as a whole, clearly postulates\nthat the promotion shall be made on merit cum\nseniority basis and not as seniority cum merit\nas wrongly stipulated in 2(b) thereof.\nAccording to Mr. Sanyal, Clause 2 of the third\nschedule of the said Standing Order, if read\nas a whole, would logically suggest such\nmeaning.\n\nMr. Sanyal in support of his contention\nhas cited two Supreme Court decisions reported\nin 98 Vol. III Supreme Court Cases, Page 694\nand AIR 1986, Supreme Court, Page 1043.'\n\nPage 9-11\n' Rule 2 of the third schedule of the Standing\nOrder is relevant for consideration in the\ninstant case. Sub-Clause (b) denotes the\npromotion would be made on seniority cum\nmerit. The eligibility clauses being clause\n\n(e), (b) and (i) give the criterion to bring\nthe candidates within the zone of\nconsideration.\n\nClause (f) prescribes the mode of\nselection i.e. by holding written test,\ninterview and performance assessment. Clause\n\n(g) deals with the composition of the\nselection committee.\n\nClause (j) stipulates that the selection\nshall be on the basis of performance in the\nwritten tests, interview and performance\nappraisal require for proceeding five years.\nSub-Clause A stipulates that a candidate to\nbecome eligible to be called on in interview\nmust obtain 40% marks in both the groups\nwhereas sub-clause B denotes that there is no\nminimum qualifying marks in the interview.\nWhereas sub-clause C the last five years\nrecords are to be considered for awarding\nmarks. There are total 100 marks in the\nselection process out of which written tests\ndenotes 60 marks, interview and performance\nrecords 20 marks each.\n\nIt is significant that there is no\nminimum marks prescribed for being considered\nfor ultimate selection. If I have to accept\nthe contention of Mr. Mukherjee that the\npromotion in the instant case is in accordance\nwith seniority cum merit then I have to find\nout from the standing order the minimum marks\nto make the senior most eligible for the\npromotional post. In absence of such marking\nit is very difficult to ask the authority to\nact on the basis of the Standing Order by\ngiving promotion to the senior cadre on the\nbasis of minimum eligible qualification when\nthere is no minimum eligible qualification\nfixed for the said post. The rule of\ninterpretation does not permit me to add or\ndelete any word. I have to give harmonious\nconstruction of the said Standing Order as far\nas practicable. Hence, reading clause 2 of the\nthird schedule of the said Standing Order and\ntaking a sum total of the relevant sub-clauses\nand the meaning thereof it appears to me that\nalthough the said promotion has been\nstipulated to be made on the basis of\nseniority cum merit it is in effect merit cum\nseniority. I, therefore, find substance in Mr.\nSanyal's argument. I hold that clause 2(d) has\nto be read as merit cum seniority in\naccordance with the definition of the said\nphrase as held by the Apex Court in various\njudgments including the judgment reported in\nAIR 1998 Supreme Court, page 2565. Hence I do\nnot find any irregularity in the selection\nprocess.\"\n\n[SIC but underlining by this Court]\n\nThe learned Single Judge following the said judgment in the\n\ncase of Pradip Kumar Sarkar & Ors. (Supra) came to an erroneous\nfinding that the 1998 Rules although provides that promotion is to\n\nbe given on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, in effect, it is on\n\nthe basis of merit-cum-seniority. The aforesaid finding of the\n\nlearned Single Judge is virtually contrary to the prescribed rules\n\nwhich are applicable in the matter of granting promotion. The\n\nlearned Single Judge, in our opinion, was clearly misled by the\n\nprovisions mentioned in the Rules with regard to the mode of\n\nselection. The prescribed procedures for mode of selection can\n\nunder no circumstances change the basis of promotion which has\n\nbeen clearly mentioned in the said Rules i.e. seniority-cum-merit.\n\nIn the present case, undisputedly, the respondent bank selected\n\nthe candidates and granted promotion actually on the basis of\n\nmerit-cum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit which has been\n\nerroneously approved by the learned Single Judge in the judgment\n\nunder appeal.\n\nWe respectfully disagree with the aforesaid findings of the\n\nlearned Single Judge. Clause 2(d) of the Third Schedule of the\n\n1998 Rules specifically provides that promotion should be made on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit and there is no ambiguity in this\n\nregard. When the 1998 Rules clearly provide that promotion should\n\nbe made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, the learned Single\n\nJudge had no scope to take a contrary view since it is well-\n\nsettled that the Court cannot rewrite the Rules.\n\nThe learned Single Judge also erroneously held as hereunder:\n\n\"12. Merely because at Rule 2(d), the authors of the\nRule have stated that promotion shall be on the basis of\nseniority-cum-merit, the same, by itself, cannot mean\nthat under the 1998 Rules, seniority has to be given\nweightage in supersession of merit.\"\n\nIn our opinion, the learned Single Judge did not lay down the\n\ncorrect law. In the event, promotion is to be given on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit then seniority has to be given weightage in\n\nsupersession of merit.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nB. V. Sivaiah and\n\nOthers vs. K. Addanki Babu and Others\nreported in (1998) 6 SCC 720\n\nspecifically held:\n\n\"18. We thus arrive at the conclusion\nthat the criterion of 'seniority-cum-\n\nmerit' in the matter of promotion\npostulates that given the minimum\n\nnecessary merit requisite for efficiency\nof administration, the senior, even\nthough less meritorious, shall have\npriority and a comparative assessment of\nmerit is not required to be made. For\nassessing the minimum necessary merit,\nthe competent authority can lay down the\nminimum standard that is required and\nalso prescribe the mode of assessment of\nmerit of the employee who is eligible for\nconsideration for promotion. Such\nassessment can be made by assigning marks\non the basis of appraisal of performance\non the basis of service record and\ninterview and prescribing the minimum\nmarks which would entitle a person to be\npromoted on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit.\"\n\nReferring to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court,\n\nArijit Pasayat, J. in the case of\nBhagwandas Tiwari & Ors. vs.\n\nDewas Shajapur Kshetriya Gramin Bank & Ors.\nreported in AIR 2007\n\nSC 994 explained the principles of seniority-cum-merit and merit-\n\ncum-seniority as hereunder:\n\n\"10. The principle of 'merit-cum-\nseniority' lays greater emphasis on merit\nand ability and seniority plays a less\nsignificant role. Seniority is to be\ngiven weight only when merit and ability\nare approximately equal. In the context\nof Rule 5(2) of the Indian Administrative\nService/Indian Police Service\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulations,\n1955 which prescribed that \"selection for\ninclusion in such list shall be based on\n(AIR 1974 SC merit and suitability in all respects\n\n87) with due regard to seniority\" Mathew, J.\n\nin\nUnion of India v. Mohan Lal Capoor and\nOrs.\n, 1973 (2) SCC 836, has said:-\n\n' For inclusion in the list, merit\nand suitability in all respects\nshould be the governing\nconsideration and that seniority\nshould play a secondary role. It is\nonly when merit and suitability are\nroughly equal that seniority will be\na determining factor, or if it is\nnot fairly possible to make an\nassessment inter se of the merit and\nsuitability of two eligible\ncandidates and come to a firm\nconclusion, seniority would tilt the\nscale.'\n\n(AIR 1974 SC 87) Similarly, Beg, J. (as the learned Chief\nPara 22 Justice then was) has said (SCC p. 851,\nPara 22) :\n\n'22. Thus, we think that the correct\nview, in conformity with the plain\nmeaning of words used in the relevant\nrules, is that the 'entrance' or\n'inclusion' test, for a place on the\nselect list, is competitive and\ncomparative applied to all eligible\ncandidates and not minimal like pass\nmarks at an examination. The Selection\nCommittee has an unrestricted choice of\nthe best available talent, from amongst\neligible candidates, determined by\nreference a reasonable criteria applied\nin assessing the facts revealed by\nservice records of all eligible\ncandidates so that merit and not here\nseniority is the governing factor.'\n\n11. On the other hand, as between the\nprinciples of seniority and merit, the\ncriterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' lays\ngreater emphasis on seniority. In State\n(AIR 1968 SC of Mysore and Anr. V. Syed Mahmood and\n1113)\nOrs., 1968 (3) SCR 363, while considering\nRule 4(3)(b) of the Mysore State Civil\nServices General Recruitment Rules, 1957\nwhich required promotion to be made by\nselection on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit, this Court has observed that the\nrule required promotion to be made by\nselection on the basis of 'seniority\nsubject to the fitness of candidate to\ndischarge the duties of post from among\npersons eligible for promotion.' It was\npointed out that where promotion is based\non seniority-cum-merit, the officer\ncannot claim promotion as a matter of\nright by virtue of his seniority alone\nand if he is found unfit to discharge the\nduties of the higher post, he may be\npassed over and an officer junior to him\nmay be promoted.\n\n12.\nIn\nState of Kerala and Anr. V. N. M.\n\n(AIR 1976 SC 490) Thomas and Ors., 1976 (2) SCC 310, A.N.\nPara 38 Ray, C.J. has thus explained the\ncriterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' (SCC\np. 335, Para 38):-\n\n'With regard to promotion the normal\nprinciples are either merit-cum-\n\nseniority or seniority-cum-merit.\nSeniority-cum-merit means that given\nthe minimum necessary merit\nrequisite for efficiency of\nadministration, the senior though\nthe less meritorious shall have\npriority.\"\n\nAs observed earlier, the bank in the present case, granted\n\npromotion in violation of the promotion policy based on seniority-\n\ncum-merit. Going through the records we find that the authorities\n\nof the respondent bank while selecting the candidates for\n\npromotion considered the marks secured by the individual\n\ncandidates in the interview and performance appraisal reports\n\napart from the written test and thus, in effect, followed the\n\nprocedure for granting promotion on the basis of merit-cum-\n\nseniority as specifically recorded by the learned Single Judge in\n\nthe judgment under appeal. The marks secured in the interview as\n\nwell as the performance appraisal report and in the written test\n\ncannot have any effect in the matter of granting promotion on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit. However, in order to ensure minimum\n\nstandard of merit, provision for securing minimum 40% marks in\neach part in the written test cannot be declared unreasonable\n\nalthough ultimate selection cannot be based on the basis of marks\n\nsecured by the candidates seeking promotion to the higher post.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nHargovind Yadav vs.\n\nRewa Sidhi Gramin Bank and Ors.\nreported in (2006) 6 SCC 145\n\nconsidered the aforesaid issue as hereunder:\n\n\"22. Interviews can be held and assessment of\nperformance can be made by the Bank in\nconnection with promotions. But that can be\nonly to assess the minimum necessary merit.\nBut where the procedure adopted does not\nprovide the minimum standard for promotion,\nbut only the minimum standard for interview\nand does the selection with reference to\ncomparative marks, it is contrary to the\nrule of 'seniority-cum-merit'. This aspect\nof the matter has been completely lost sight\nof by the learned Single Judge and the\nDivision Bench of the High Court in this\nround of litigation. As noticed above, they\nhave proceeded on the basis that the\nappellant having failed to secure the\nminimum marks prescribed for interview, was\nrightly denied promotion, by ignoring the\nprinciple\nlaid down by\nthis Court in Sivaiah\nin regard to seniority-cum-merit. At all\nevents, as the promotion policy adopted by\nthe Bank was held to be illegal in the\nearlier round of litigation (WP No. 4485 of\n1993 dated 13-10-1988), the Bank could not\nhave adopted the same policy to again reject\nthe appellant for promotion.\n\nWe may also\nnote that the law\nlaid down in\nSivaiah was\nreiterated in\nSher Singh v. Surinder Kumar\n\nwherein this Court had occasion to consider\na similar question relating to the promotion\nfor the post of clerk to Field Supervisor in\nthe case of another Gramin Bank. This Court\nheld that as the criterion for making\npromotion from the post of clerk to that of\nField Supervisor was seniority-cum-merit but\nthe Bank did not follow the criterion of\nseniority-cum-merit but made promotions on\nthe basis of merit-cum-seniority, the\npromotion was vitiated and therefore\ninvalid.\"\n\nThe learned Single Judge approved the stand of the respondent\n\nbank in the matter of granting promotion even after recording that\n\nthe selection for such promotion was made on the basis of merit-\n\ncum-seniority and not seniority-cum-merit as clearly mentioned in\n\nthe Rules and thus, virtually the learned Single Judge made an\n\nattempt to re-legislate the statute and/or rewrite the Rules as\n\nargued by Mr. K. Bandyopadhyay, learned Senior Counsel\n\nrepresenting the appellants. Mr. Bandyopadhyay also referred to\n\nand relied on a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nJinia\n\nKeotin and Others vs. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi and others\nreported in\n\n(2003) 1 SCC 730 (Paragraph 5).\n\nThere is no doubt that the Court has no power either to re-\n\nlegislate the statute and/or rewrite the Rules. Therefore, the\n\nlearned Single Judge even after coming to the specific finding\n\nthat the rule for granting promotion on the basis of seniority-\n\ncum-merit has not been followed approved the action of the\nrespondent bank with regard to selection of the candidates for\n\ngranting promotion to the higher post.\n\nThe learned Senior Counsel of the appellants raised another\n\nissue relating to the conducting of the written test by a private\n\nagency without constituting a Committee in compliance with the\n\nRules. In our opinion, the Rules should be followed at every stage\n\nand there is no scope to avoid the mandate of the Rules.\n\nIt has also been submitted on behalf of the respondent bank\n\nthat the 1998 Rules contained several provisions materially\n\ndifferent than those in the 1988 Rules. According to the learned\n\nSenior Counsel of the respondent bank, all the decided and\n\nreported cases on promotion in Regional Rural Banks/Gramin Banks\n\nincluding\nB. V. Sivaiah & Ors.\n(Supra) and\nHargovind Yadav\n(Supra)\n\nhave considered the Recruitment Rules of 1988 and not the\n\nRecruitment Rules of 1998. Since the Recruitment Rules of 1988 as\n\nwell as the Recruitment Rules of 1998 specifically provide that\n\nthe selection for promotion should be made strictly on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit, the principles of law\nlaid down in\nthe\n\naforesaid decisions cited on behalf of the appellants are very\n\nmuch applicable in the facts of the present case.\n\nThe learned Senior Counsel representing the\n\nrespondent bank submits that there is an apparent inconsistency\n\nbetween Clause 2(d) of the Third Schedule on one hand and Clauses\n\n2(f) & (j) on the other hand. Thus, the said learned Senior\n\nCounsel of the respondent bank virtually admits that the mode of\n\nselection for promotion mentioned in the Rules is inconsistent\n\nwith the principle for granting promotion in terms of the\n\naforesaid Rules on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. The learned\n\nSenior Counsel of the respondent bank further submits that the\n\nCourt should make an endeavour for harmonious construction of the\n\naforesaid Rules in order to resolve the apparent inconsistency.\n\nIt is true that if the harmonious construction is possible and\n\npermissible then the same should be accepted otherwise the\n\nprinciple prescribed in the Rules for promotion based on\n\nseniority-cum-merit cannot be given a go-bye even for the purpose\n\nof following the selection process as provided in the said Rules\n\nof 1998. The selection process prescribed in the rules should be\n\nfollowed in order to achieve the policy of promotion based on\n\nseniority-cum-merit as specifically mentioned in the said Rules of\n\n1998. The policy for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n\ncannot be diluted at any stage and if necessary suitable amendment\n\nof the selection process should be made. Undisputedly, the\n\nselection process for promotion should be prescribed in such a\nmanner so that the policy for promotion based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit can be followed and implemented.\n\nThe provisions mentioned in the Recruitment Rules of\n\n1998 with regard to the mode of selection and the selection\n\nprocess for promotion cannot have any overriding effect on the\n\nprinciple prescribed for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit as specifically mentioned in Clause 2(d) of the Third\n\nSchedule of the Recruitment rules, since the procedure cannot\n\nprevail upon principle or supersede the principle under any\n\ncircumstances. The principle prescribed in the Rules for promotion\n\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit should be strictly followed\n\nand implemented at every stage and in doing so, if any\n\ninconsistency is detected with any other rule prescribing the\n\nprocedure relating to mode of selection and selection process for\n\npromotion then such inconsistency should be avoided in such a\n\nmanner so that the principle prescribed for promotion on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit is not at all defeated.\n\nWith regard to mode of selection and selection process for\n\npromotion, minimum standard prescribed for written test upon\n\nimposing condition on the candidates for securing a minimum of 40%\n\nmarks in each part of the written test should be followed and in\n\ndoing so there would be no inconsistency with the principle\nprescribed for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule. Regarding interview and\n\nperformance appraisal reports, no minimum qualifying marks have\n\nbeen prescribed. Therefore, the concerned authority should\n\nconsider the performance of the candidate concerned at the\n\ninterview and performance appraisal reports for the preceding five\n\nyears in order to assess the suitability of the candidates to the\n\npromotional posts. This Court cannot rewrite the Rules but in\n\norder to give a harmonious construction of the Rules, the marks\n\nawarded in the interview and the performance appraisal reports\n\nshould be considered only for assessing the suitability of the\n\ncandidates and not to adjudge comparative merits of the candidates\n\nupon giving a go-bye to the principle of promotion on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit.\n\nThe learned Counsel representing the private\n\nrespondents also adopted the arguments advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent bank.\n\nIn the instant case, the appellants have\n\nsuccessfully passed the written test conducted under the Rules\n\nupon securing more than 40% marks. Therefore, for the purpose of\n\ngranting promotion to the post of Scale-II officers, seniority\n\nshould be the governing factor. None of the appellants has been\nfound unfit to discharge the duties of the higher post on the\n\nbasis of the interview or performance appraisal reports.\n\nTherefore, the claims of the appellants for\n\npromotion to the posts of Scale-II officers should be reconsidered\n\nby the competent authority of the respondent bank strictly on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit under the said 1998 Rules.\n\nFor the reasons discussed hereinbefore and\n\nspecifically for non-complying with the provisions mentioned in\n\nClause 2(d) of the Third Schedule of 1998 Rules, in the matter of\n\ngranting promotion to the post of Scale-II officer strictly on the\n\nbasis of 'seniority-cum-merit', the impugned order of promotion\n\nissued earlier by the Chairman, Nadia Gramin Bank on 25th August,\n\n2005 cannot be sustained in the eye of law and the same is,\n\ntherefore, quashed.\n\nThe authorities of the respondent bank are directed\n\nto undertake selection process de novo for promotion to the post\n\nof Scale-II officers from Scale-I officers following the principle\n\nof seniority-cum-merit as clearly mentioned in the 1998 Rules and\n\nexplained hereinbefore.\n\nSince a considerable time has already been elapsed,\n\nthe authorities of the respondent bank are directed to complete\n\nthe selection process de novo in the manner directed hereinabove\n\nat an early date but positively within a period of eight weeks\n\nfrom date.\n\nWith the aforesaid observations and directions, we\n\nallow the appeal and set aside the judgment and order passed by\n\nthe learned Single Judge.\n\nIn the facts and circumstances of the present case, there\n\nwill be no order as to costs.\n\nLet urgent Xerox certified copy of this judgment, if applied\nfor, be given to the learned Advocates of the parties on\ncompletion of usual undertaking.\n\n[PRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.]\n\nTAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.\n\nI agree\n\n[TAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.]\nLATER :\n\nAfter pronouncement of the judgment, the learned\n\nCounsel of the respondent-bank as well as the private respondents\n\nprays for stay of the operation of\nthe said judgment\nand order. We\n\nfind no reason to grant such stay.\n\nAccordingly, the prayer for stay is refused.\n\n[PRANAB KUMAR CHATTOPADHYAY, J.]\n\n[TAPAN MUKHERJEE, J.]",
