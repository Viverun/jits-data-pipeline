By way of the present petition under \nSection 482\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, „\nCr.P.C\n‟), the petitioners seek\nquashing of FIR No.94 of 2022 registered at Police Station Economic\nOffences Wing, Mandir Marg, New Delhi for offences punishable under\n\nSection 467\n/\n468\n/\n471\n/\n420\n/\n120B\n of the Indian Penal Code (in short, the\n\nIPC\n) and all criminal proceedings emanating therefrom.\n\n2. On 16.06.2022, FIR in question came to be registered on a written\ncomplaint made by Mr. Punit Beriwala S/o Mr. S.S. Beriwala,\nrespondent No.2 herein (who is called \"the complainant\"). Besides\nothers, the FIR is also against the present petitioners, who are the son and\nwife of one Bhai Manjit Singh. Bhai Manjit Singh is also an accused in\nthe instant FIR. It is, thus, seen that the father of petitioner No.1 and\nhusband of petitioner No.2, Bhai Manjit Singh, is the main accused in the\ninstant FIR. There are two other accused, namely, SREI Infrastructure\nFinance Ltd. and SREI Equipment Finance Ltd., which are stated to be\nfinancial institutions. Bhai Manjit Singh has also been arrayed as accused\nin the capacity of being Karta of the Hindu Undivided Family (in short,\n„HUF‟). It is, thus, seen that there are six accused in the FIR. Bhai Manjit\nSingh in the capacity of HUF Karta is accused No.1, Bhai Manjit Singh\nin his personal capacity is accused No.2, Maheep Manjit Singh W/o Bhai\nManjit Singh is accused No.3 (petitioner No.2) and Vikramjit Singh\n\n [3]\n\n(petitioner No.1) is accused No.4. Accused No.5 and 6 are SREI\nInfrastructure Financial Ltd. and SREI Equipment Ltd., respectively. The\npetitioners are being referred here according to their number as accused\nin the FIR. Since the present petition is filed by accused No.3 - Maheep\nManjit Singh and accused No.4 - Vikramjit Singh, therefore, the matter\nis being dealt only with respect to the two accused. The gravamen of the\nallegation in the FIR is as under:\n\n(i) Accused No.1 is a HUF by name of Bhai Manjit Singh of which,\n accused No.2, accused No.3 and accused No.4 are the coparceners.\n\n(ii) Accused No.1 is the owner of the property bearing No.28-A\n Prithviraj Road, New Delhi admeasuring 3727 sq. yards.\n\n (hereinafter referred to as „property in dispute‟).\n\n(iii) In the year 2004, accused No.2 - Bhai Manjit Singh approached\n the complainant being Karta of accused No.1 with an offer to sell\n the property in dispute to the complainant. Accused No.2\n represented and assured that other family members of the accused\n No.1 have also extended an offer to sell the property in dispute to\n the complainant and it was told that the property in dispute is free\n from all kinds of encumbrances.\n\n(iv) After negotiation between the complainant and the accused No.1\n to 4, it was agreed that the total sale consideration of the property\n in dispute shall be Rs.28 crores. The property in dispute was stated\n to be leasehold, therefore, parties agreed for the payment of total\n sale consideration in parts. Accused Nos.1 to 4 had undertaken to\n get the property in dispute freehold from the Land and\n Development Office. It was also agreed that the complainant\n\n [4]\n\n would make some payments as earnest money till the time accused\n Nos.1 to 4 get the said property freehold from the Land and\n Development Office. Between 12.04.2004 to 03.01.2005 against\n various receipts, a total sum of Rs.1,64,50,000/- was paid to the\n accused No.1. The role attributed to accused No.3 and 4 i.e.,\n petitioners herein is that they have signed as witnesses in the\n aforesaid receipts. The possession of part premises of the property\n in dispute i.e., servant quarter was handed over to the complainant\n vide letter of possession dated 22.04.2004.\n\n(v) Accused No.1 to 4 had assured that they would transfer the\n property to the complainant after obtaining all permissions and\n making payments to various authorities in order to freely transfer\n the property in dispute to the complainant.\n\n(vi) In June 2020, accused No.2 is stated to have approached the\n complainant stating that the title of the property in dispute is clear\n from all encumbrances and, therefore, the complainant should\n make the payment of balance consideration so that the title of the\n property in dispute can be transferred in the name of the\n complainant.\n\n(vii) The complainant requested the accused Nos.1 to 4 to show the\n documents to indicate that the property in dispute is clear from all\n encumbrances. Since no documents were provided, therefore, the\n complainant observed some mala fide behaviour, hence, he issued\n a public notice on 18.07.2020 in the newspaper „Hindustan Times‟\n declaring to the public at large his agreement with respect to the\n property in dispute with accused No.1 to 4.\n\n [5]\n\n(viii) Pursuant to aforesaid public notice, an objection letter dated\n 20.07.2020 was received on behalf of Punjab and Sindh Bank,\n Rajendra Place, New Delhi, SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd., and\n SREI Equipment Finance Ltd. staking claim over the property in\n dispute, wherein, it was stated that the said property had been\n mortgaged by the accused No.2 for securing the loan granted to\n one borrower company, namely, Montari Industries Ltd. That\n apart, two other objections vide letters dated 22.07.2020 were also\n received by the complainant from the accused Nos.5 and 6, stating\n therein that the property in dispute is mortgaged with them as well.\n Besides, the objections as stated above, another objection letter\n dated 23.07.2020 was also received from accused No.1 itself by\n the complainant, denying the agreement between the accused No.1\n and complainant for the sale of the said property in dispute and the\n accused No.1 sought the production of documents from the\n complainant.\n\n(ix) As per the allegation in the FIR, it is only on 23.07.2020, that\n accused Nos.1 to 4 for the first time refused to perform their\n obligation to conclude the sale transaction of the property in\n dispute. There were various correspondences between the\n complainant and the accused and the complainant also filed a civil\n suit [CS (OS) 598 of 2021] before this court. However, on\n 02.12.2021, the complainant could get the copy of the sale deed\n whereby, accused No.1 sold the property in dispute to JK Paper\n Ltd., wherein, it was disclosed to him that under a Memorandum\n of Family Settlement dated 10.03.2000, accused No.2 resigned as\n Karta of accused No.1 and transferred all rights, claims, title and\n\n [6]\n\n entitlements in favour of remaining members of the HUF and the\n accused No.4 was recognized as Karta of accused No.1.\n\n(x) As per the complaint, accused No.2 in the capacity of Karta of\n accused No.1 signed and delivered various receipts for a sum of\n Rs.1,64,50,000/- towards part consideration for the purchase of\n property in dispute and accused Nos. 3 and 4 had signed as\n witnesses to the said receipts issued in favour of the complainant\n which clearly indicated that accused Nos.3 to 4 have jointly misled\n the complainant to enter into an oral agreement to purchase the\n said property from the accused No.1, thereby, grabbing and\n siphoning off the hard-earned money of the complainant.\n\n(xi) The complainant after perusal of the sale deed also came to know\n that accused No.1 executed the Mortgage Deed dated 04.01.2019\n in favour of the accused No.5. Accused No.1 also deposited the\n title deeds of the property in dispute with accused No.6 as security\n against the credit facility for an amount of Rs.87,00,00,000/-\n availed by the ADIZAA Investment Pvt. Ltd.\n\n(xii) It is, alleged in paragraph No.44 of the FIR that the accused had\n committed fraud against the complainant to the tune of\n Rs.6,67,87,000/- alongwith interest calculated up-to-date @ 18%\n per annum w.e.f. 03.01.2005. It is the allegation that the accused\n had acted dishonestly thereby causing wrongful loss to the\n complainant and wrongful gain to themselves. The accused have\n committed an offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing\n delivery of property. They have also committed an offence of\n\n [7]\n\n dishonest misappropriation of the property apart from the\n commission of an offence of criminal breach of trust.\n\n3. The petitioners as stated above who are accused Nos.3 and 4 i.e.,\nwife and son of the accused No.2, respectively have filed this petition for\nquashing of FIR and all the proceedings emanating therefrom on various\ngrounds.\n\n4. This petition was taken up for hearing by this court on 31.08.2022\nand after considering the averments made in the petition, notices were\ndirected to be issued to the Respondents. Respondent No.2 through his\ncounsel accepted the notice. Respondent No.2 sought time to file the\nreply. On prayer made by the petitioners for considering the grant of\ninterim relief, this court, after consideration of the matter, directed the\nrespondent to file the reply within seven days and subject to cooperation\nby the petitioners, their arrest has been stayed. On 15.09.2022, the parties\nundertook to file written synopsis with relevant judgments so that the\nmatter could be heard finally and, accordingly, this petition came up for\nhearing on 22.09.2022 and on that date, the arguments on behalf of the\nparties were heard for final disposal.\n\n5. Respondent No.2/complainant filed his reply and the substance of\nthe reply is as under:\n\n(i) The accused have deceived the complainant into believing that the\n accused No.2 is the Karta of accused No.1. The accused\n dishonestly induced the complainant to part with his hard-earned\n money in the year 2004-05 to the tune of Rs. 1,64,50,000/- and\n entered into an Agreement to Sell with the complainant with\n\n [8]\n\n respect to property in dispute and hence, an offence punishable\n under \nSection 420\n of the IPC is prima facie made out.\n\n(ii) Since the accused dishonestly misappropriated the amount paid to\n them and finally refused to honour the Agreement to Sell with\n respect to the property in dispute and, therefore, the act of the\n accused is clearly punishable under \nSection 406\n of the IPC.\n\n(iii) Accused persons are in the habit of committing offences. One Mr.\n Ashok Gupta was also subjected to misrepresentation, who had\n disbursed consideration of Rs.4,30,00,000/- to the accused Nos.1\n and 2 in the year 2010-11.\n\n(iv) It is stated in the reply that the property in dispute was mortgaged\n to various banks in order to avail loan and hence, the accused are\n habitual offenders who had defrauded various people by showing\n dreams to own the property in dispute.\n\n(v) An FIR No.105 of 2016 dated 24.06.2016 was also got registered\n by Mr. Ashok Gupta at Police Station E.O.W, Delhi, against the\n accused No.1 to 4. The said FIR, however, came to be quashed\n vide order dated 13.02.2019 in W.P.C.(Crl) No.465/2019 by this\n court on the basis of an amicable settlement entered into between\n Ashok Gupta and accused Nos.1 to 4.\n\n(vi) It is stated that on 22.08.2022, the accused No.1 lodged an FIR\n No.128/2022 at Police Station Tuglaq Road, New Delhi alleging\n therein that receipts of the amount are forged, whereas, he did not\n utter even a single word in his reply dated 23.07.2022 sent by him\n on behalf of the Bhai Manjit Singh (HUF). The averments made in\n\n [9]\n\n the FIR are contrary to the ones made in Civil Suit (OS)\n No.598/2021 and FAO (OS) No.20/2022.\n\n(vii) The petitioners i.e., accused No.3 & 4 have not joined the\n investigation. The change of Karta from Bhai Manjit Singh to\n accused No.4/petitioner No.1, was never intimated to the\n complainant. The complainant was sincerely and patiently waiting\n for the accused persons to obtain all NOCs to ensure that the\n property in dispute becomes free from all incumbrances and,\n therefore, no delay can be attributed to the complainant. The delay\n is not material in taking criminal proceedings for the offences\n alleged in the FIR.\n\n(viii) There are cross FIRs. They need proper investigation as in one FIR\n accused No.2 himself is alleging that the receipts in question are\n forged which is contrary to his own reply and documents. In the\n present FIR, it was alleged that the accused No.2 has induced the\n complainant while describing himself to be Karta of accused No.1,\n whereas, the accused No.2 had already resigned from being Karta\n of the family on 02.05.2000 itself. Since this fact has been\n discovered only after perusal of the sale deed dated 02.12.2021,\n therefore, it cannot be said that there is any delay in lodging the\n instant FIR. It is thus, stated in the instant reply that there is no\n substance in the petition, therefore, the same deserves to be\n dismissed.\n\n6. Respondent No.1/EOW has also filed its reply/Status report stating\ntherein that during the investigation, it was found that accused No.1 to 4\nhave also cheated another person Ashok Gupta on the pretext of the sale\n\n [10]\n\nof the same property and, therefore, they are habitual cheaters. The\nnotice under \nSection 91\n of the Cr.P.C. was issued to the accused to\nsupply relevant documents to confirm payment and their signatures were\nsought to be obtained. It is also stated that the investigation of the case is\nat the initial stage. The reply of the accused is being analyzed and further\ninvestigation is in progress.\n\n7. The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners\nsubmits that there is no agreement entered into between the parties for\nthe sale of the property in dispute and it is unbelievable to accept the\nallegation that the payment of such a hefty amount was made, as part\nconsideration, without recording any written agreement. There is a delay\nof about 17 years in the registration of the FIR and the delay has not been\nexplained in any manner whatsoever. There is not a single letter, e-mail,\nWhatsApp message, or text exchanged between the complainant and the\naccused No.2 between 2005 and 2020 enquiring about the status of the\nproperty in dispute and the complete silence on the part of the\ncomplainant speaks volumes about the correctness of the allegations.\nEven if entire allegations made in the FIR are taken at their face value as\ncorrect, no offence as alleged is made out against the petitioners. No\noffence of cheating is made out. The dispute, at best, is purely of civil\nnature, which has been given a criminal colour to arm-twist the\npetitioners. There is no allegation of forgery. \nThe E.O.W. does not have\nany right to register an FIR for an offence where the pecuniary limit is\nless than three crores. The FIR No.105/2016 lodged by Ashok Gupta is\nalready quashed and rather respondent No.2 is a habitual offender against\nwhom FIR No.40 of 2018 is pending at E.O.W apart from FIR\nNo.2000/2013 at the same Police Station. Besides that, respondent No.2\n\n [11]\n\nis also placing reliance on the notice under \nSection 8(6)\n of Security\nInterest (Enforcement Rules 2002) read with \nSecuritization and\nReconstructing of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest\nAct\n. The learned senior counsel places reliance on the decisions of the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in the matters of \nProf. RK Vijayasarathy v.\nSudha Seetharam1\n, VY Jose v. State of Gujarat2, \nG. Sagar Suri and\nAnr. v. State of UP and Ors.3\n, \nRashmi Jain v. State of UP4\n, \nJibrial\nDiwan v. State of Maharashtra5\n, \nMohammed Ibrahim v. State of\nBihar6\n, \nState of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal7\n , \nSheela Sebastian v. R.\nJawaharraj8\n and \nBandekar Brothers Pvt Ltd. & Anr v. Prasad\nVassudev Keni & Ors9\n.\n\n8. Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.2\nwhile reiterating the submissions in the reply, highlights that it is only on\n23.07.2020, the accused for the first time denied the transaction with the\ncomplainant and stated that absolutely there is no proposal of sale of the\nproperty in dispute. It is also stated that on 02.12.2021, the accused\nfraudulently and in a bid to frustrate the rights of the complainant, sold\nthe property to JK Paper Ltd. and it is only on the perusal of the\ndocuments, the complainant had come to know that the accused had got\nconverted the property from leasehold to freehold on 09.03.2017, which\nwas granted on 04.06.2018. It is, therefore, submitted that as per the\n\n1\n\n (2019) 16 SCC 739\n\n2\n\n (2009) 3 SCC 78\n3 2000 2 SCC 636\n\n4\n\n (2014) 13 SCC 553\n\n5\n\n (1997) 6 SCC 499\n\n6\n\n (2009) 8 SCC 751\n\n7\n\n 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335\n\n8\n\n (2018) 7 SCC 515\n\n9\n\n (2020) 20 SCC 1\n\n [12]\n\nterms of the agreement, the property was to be sold to the complainant\nonly after the same is free from all encumbrances and that process\ncontinued up to 2018 and, therefore, there cannot be said to be any delay\nin the registration of the FIR. While highlighting the averments made in\nthe FIR, the learned senior counsel has submitted that this court has to\nconfine itself to the allegations in the FIR and to consider whether the\nallegations made therein constitute prima facie allegations of the offence\nas alleged against them. According to him, the mere existence of civil\nproceedings cannot act as a bar to the investigation of a cognizable\noffence and both can go together in a given case. It has been pointed out\nthat right from the beginning, the intention of petitioner No.2 in\ndescribing himself as a Karta of petitioner No.1 was clearly to cheat the\ncomplainant and to dishonestly induce him to deliver the property. \nIt is\nstated that the petitioners, who are accused Nos.3 and 4, in the FIR have\nput their signatures as witnesses into the receipt which contains specific\naverment that accused No.2 being Karta of accused No.1 is entitled to\nenter into an agreement for the sale of the property in dispute. It is, thus,\nsubmitted that prima facie the allegations against all the accused are\nmade out and this court should not interfere in the FIR at this stage as the\ninvestigation is yet to be completed. It has also been argued that the High\nCourt should be extremely cautious and slow to interfere with the\ninvestigation and/or trial of criminal cases and should not stay the\ninvestigation and/or prosecution except when it is convinced beyond any\nmanner of doubt that FIR does not disclose cognizable offence. Learned\nsenior counsel has placed reliance on decisions of the Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt in the cases of \nNeeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd v. State of\n\n [13]\n\nMaharashtra10\n, \nState of Madhya Pradesh v. Mishrilal11\n, \nLalita Kumari\nv. State of U.P.12\n, \nEdmund S. Lyngdoh v. State of Meghalaya13\n, \nSyed\nAskari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam v. State (Delhi Admn\n.\n)14, \nLee Kun\nHee v. State of UP15\n, \nTrisuns Chemicals v. Raj Agarwal16\n, \nPriti Saraf &\nAnr v. State of NCT of Delhi & Anr17\n and \nRamveer Upadhyay & Anr v.\nState of UP & Anr18\n and the decision of this court in the matter of \nMGF\nDevelopments v. State NCT of Delhi19\n\n9. The Learned APP while placing reliance on standing order No.\nCrime/06/2022 dated 23.05.2022 stated that the understanding of the\npetitioners with respect to the pecuniary jurisdiction of E.O.W is\ncompletely misplaced as an offence has a pecuniary limit of up to one\ncrore. E.O.W is empowered to enquire into with the approval of district\nDCP and up to three crore Jt. CP Range/Crime and for more than three\ncrores Spl. CP/EOW and in this case, there is approval by the competent\nauthority and hence, the petitioner cannot allege any incompetence on the\npart of E.O.W.\n\n10. I have heard submissions made by the learned senior counsel\nappearing on behalf of the parties and perused the record.\n\n11. So far as the pecuniary jurisdiction of E.O.W is concerned, since\nthe issue goes to the root of the matter, therefore, the same has to be\n\n10\n\n 2021 SCC OnLine SC 315\n\n11\n\n (2003) 9 SCC 426\n\n12\n\n (2014) 2 SCC 1\n\n13\n\n (2016) 15 SCC 572\n\n14\n\n (2009) 5 SCC 528\n\n15\n\n 2012 3 SCC 132\n\n16\n\n 1999 8 SCC 686\n\n17\n\n 2021 sSCC OnLine SC 206\n\n18\n\n 2022 SCC OnLine SC 484\n\n19\n\n 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2824\n\n [14]\n\nexamined at the threshold. Standing order No.Crime/06/2022 dated\n23.05.2022 clause 4.1.2 reads as under:\n\n \"4.1.2 Following officers will be competent to order\n for taking up the enquiry in EOW as well as in Districts: -\n\n Sr. Amount Competent Authority\n No.\n\n 1. Up to 1 Crore District DCP\n\n 2. 1Crore to 3 Crore Jt. CP Range/Crime\n\n 3. More than 3 Crore Spl. CP/EOW\n\n If during the course of the enquiry, it emerges that\n the Economic offence involves more than one crore and\n three crores, the complaint(s) will be sent to the competent\n authority for approval as well as for taking up the enquiry.\n Complaints which have been asked to be enquired from the\n higher offices like CP/Delhi and Special CP/EOW shall be\n taken up for enquiry, after preliminary scrutiny and\n verifying the facts. Enquiry of complaints and subsequent\n investigation of the cases as per described limit shall be\n undertaken in the districts by specialized units like DIU\n (District Investigation Unit)/ Crime with the approval of\n the competent authority.\n\n Further, the Multi Victim Cases (20 (Twenty) or\n more victims) will be investigated in EOW irrespective of\n the amount involved. The rest of the cases of similar\n nature, but less than 3 crore and less than twenty victims,\n shall be investigated by concerned Districts or Crime. The\n cases related to cyber-crime in which substantial cyber\n techniques are to be delved into will be taken up by Cyber\n Cell under Special Cell or Crime Branch. The cases in\n\n [15]\n\n which inter-state gangs are involved will be investigated\n by Crime Branch.\"\n\n12. A perusal of the standing order clearly indicates that there is no\nthreshold limit for E.O.W to investigate any offence. What is required as\nper the standing order is the approval of competent authority for taking\nup the inquiry in E.O.W as well as in districts. For an amount up to one\ncrore, the competent authority is district DCP and for an amount of one\ncrore to three crore, the competent authority is Jt. CP Range/Crime,\nwhereas, for an amount of more than three crore Spl. CP/EOW is the\ncompetent authority.\n\n13. It is, thus, seen that there is no substance in the argument advanced\non behalf of the petitioners that the E.O.W does not have pecuniary\njurisdiction to entertain a complaint for an offence involving an amount\nof less than three crores. It is, therefore, held that the E.O.W is competent\nto investigate the offence in question.\n\n14. Under the facts of the present case, the question that arises for\nconsideration of this court is whether the High Court would be justified\nin quashing FIR at its nascent stage when the investigation has not yet\nbeen completed. The determination of the question involved in the\ninstant case would depend upon the issue as to whether the allegations\nmade in the FIR, even when taken at their face value and accepted in\ntheir entirety, do they prima facie constitute any offence or make out a\ncase against the petitioners or, whether the allegations made in the FIR\nare so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent\nperson can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for\nproceeding against the petitioners.\n\n [16]\n\n15. It is settled legal position that the power under \nSection 482\n of the\nCr.P.C. should be sparingly invoked with circumspection and it should\nbe exercised to see that the process of law is not abused or misused. The\nHigh Court at the stage of quashing the FIR is not to embark upon an\ninquiry as to the probability, reliability or genuineness of the allegations\nmade therein. If the averments taken on face value do not constitute the\ningredient necessary for an offence, the FIR in question can certainly be\nquashed. Though the law does not require that the complaint should\nreproduce the legal ingredient of the offence verbatim, however, the\ncomplaint must contain the basic facts necessary for making out an\noffence under the penal code. It is also permissible in the exercise of\npower under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. to examine, whether a matter\nwhich is essentially of a civil nature has been given a cloak of a criminal\noffence. If the High Court finds that the continuation of FIR would result\nin an abuse of the process of law, the High Court would be empowered to\nexercise its power under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. and to quash the FIR\neven at the nascent stage.\n\n16. In order to reassure the aforesaid legal position, a few judgments\nof the Hon‟ble Supreme Court on the aforesaid legal aspects are\nnecessary to be considered.\n\n17. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nState of Karnataka v.\nL. Muniswamy20\n had an occasion to consider the scope and ambit of\npower under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. In the case of \nL. Muniswamy\n\n(supra), the challenge was made by the accused to the charges before the\nHigh Court and the High Court dismissed the petition, accordingly, the\n\n20\n\n (1997) 2 SCC 699\n\n [17]\n\naccused therein were before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. The Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court in paragraph No.7 of its decision held as under:\n\n \"In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court\n is entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to the\n conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would\n be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of\n justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed.\n The saving of the High Court's inherent powers, both in\n civil and criminal matters is designed to achieve a salutary\n public purpose which is that a court proceeding ought not\n to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment\n or persecution. In a criminal case, the veiled object behind\n a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on\n which the structure of the prosecution rests and the like\n would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in\n the interest of justice. The ends of justice are higher than\n the ends of mere law though justice has got to be\n administered according to laws made by the legislature.\n The compelling necessity for making these observations is\n that without a proper realisation of the object and purpose\n of the provision which seeks to save the inherent powers of\n the High Court to do justice between the State and its\n subjects it would be impossible to appreciate the width and\n contours of that salient jurisdiction.\"\n\n18. \nIn the matter of \nChandrapal Singh and Ors v. Maharaj Singh &\nAnr.21\n, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court was considering the validity of a\ncriminal complaint instituted by the landlord against the tenant for the\ncommission of an offence under \nSections 193\n, \n199\n and \n201\n of the IPC.\nThe cognizance was taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate for the\naforesaid offences and the order of cognizance was challenged by the\ntenant before the High Court. The High Court did not find any merit in\nthe said challenge and, therefore, the tenant was before the Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court.\n\n21\n\n (1982) 1 SCC 466\n\n [18]\n\n19. While deciding the aforesaid controversy the Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt in paragraph No.1 of the decision has observed as under:\n\n \"A frustrated landlord after having met his waterloo in\n the hierarchy of civil courts has further enmeshed the\n tenant in a frivolous criminal prosecution which prima\n facie appears to be an abuse of the process of law. The\n facts when stated are so telling that the further discussion\n may appear to be superfluous.\"\n\n Extract of paragraph No.14 is also reproduced as under:\n\n \"Complainant herein is an advocate. He lost in both courts\n in the rent control proceedings and has now rushed to the\n criminal court. This itself speaks volumes. Add to this the\n fact that another suit between the parties was pending\n from 1975. This conclusion is inescapable that invoking\n the jurisdiction of the criminal court in this background is\n an abuse of the process of law and the High court rather\n glossed over this important fact while declining to exercise\n its power under \nSection 482\n CrPC.\"\n\n On the basis of the aforesaid observations and findings, the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in paragraph No.15 of its judgment had set aside\nthe order of taking cognizance against the petitioners therein.\n\n20. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nG. Sagar Suri and\nAnr.\n (supra) which is also relied upon by the learned counsel appearing\non behalf of the petitioners had an occasion to consider the prayer for\nquashing of the criminal proceedings against the petitioners therein for\nan offence under \nSection 406\n/\n420\n of IPC.\n \nIn paragraph No.8 of the\naforesaid decision, it has been held that if the matter, which is essentially\nof a civil nature, has been given a cloak of a criminal offence, criminal\nproceedings are not a short-cut of other remedies available in law, are\nfactors to be considered while exercise power under Section 482 of the\n\n [19]\n\nCr.P.C\n. In addition to the earlier decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court\nin the case of \nL. Muniswamy\n (supra), the Hon‟ble Supreme Court had\nalso considered other decisions in the case of Kurukshetra University &\nAnr v. State of Haryana & Anr.22, Chandrapal Singh and Ors. (supra)\nand under the circumstances of that case has held that invoking the\njurisdiction of a criminal court for allegedly having committed an\noffence under \nSection 406\n/\n420\n of IPC by the appellant, was an abuse of\nthe process of law and, therefore, the appeal preferred by the\nappellant/accused, therein, was allowed and criminal case pending before\nthe Chief Judicial Magistrate was quashed.\n\n21. \nIn the matter of \nZhandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd & Anr. v.\nMohd Sharaful Haque & Anr.23\n, while placing reliance on the decision\nin the case of \nR.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab24\n, and the decision of the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of \nBhajan Lal\n (supra) and other\nearlier decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme it has been held as under:\n\n \"9. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab\n MANU/SC/0086/1960:1960 Cri. LJ 1239, this Court\n summarized some categories of cases where inherent\n power can and should be exercised to quash the\n proceedings.\n\n (i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar\n against the institution or continuance e.g., want of\n sanction;\n\n (ii) where the allegations in the first information report or\n complaint taken at its face value and accepted in their\n entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;\n\n22\n\n (1977) 4 SCC 451\n\n23\n\n (2005) 1 SCC 122\n\n24\n\n AIR 1960 SC 866\n\n [20]\n\n (iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there\n is no legal evidence adduced or the evidence adduced\n clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.\"\n\n22. \nIn the decision of \nUma Shankar Gopalika v. State of Bihar &\nOrs.25\n, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court was considering the challenge made\nby the accused to the complaint filed by respondent No.2, therein, for an\noffence punishable under \nSection 420\n/\n120B\n of the IPC. The matter was\nrelated to an agreement and the complainant had made a partial payment\nof his investment to the accused. It was the case of the appellant/accused\ntherein that the only allegation against him was that the accused assured\nthe complainant that when they receive the insurance claim, they would\npay a certain sum to the complainant but the same was never paid. It was\nalso alleged that the accused, therein, fraudulently persuaded the\ncomplainant to agree so that accused persons may take steps for moving\nconsumer court in relation to their own claim. The Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt in paragraph No.6 of its decision had held that every breach of\ncontract would not give rise to the offence of cheating and only those\ncases of breach of contract would amount to an offence where there was\nany deception played at the very inception. If the intention to cheat has\ndeveloped later on, the same cannot amount to the offence of cheating. In\nthe said case, it was found that there was no deception at the very\ninception and, accordingly, no offence under \nsection 420\n/\n120B\n of the\nIPC was found to be committed. The dispute in question was found to be\ncivil in nature and it was held that the remedy lies before the civil court\nby filing a properly constituted suit. Accordingly, the Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt had set aside the order passed by the High Court and also quashed\n\n25\n\n (2005) 10 SCC 336\n\n [21]\n\nthe complaint in question. Paragraph Nos.6 and 7 of the aforesaid\ndecision are being reproduced as under:\n\n \"6. Now the question to be examined by us is as to whether\n on the facts disclosed in the petition of the complaint any\n criminal offence whatsoever is made out of much fewer\n offences Under \nSection 420\n/\n120B\n of the Indian Penal\n Code. The only allegation in the complaint petition against\n the accused persons is that they assured the complainant\n that when they receive the insurance claim amounting to\n Rs. 4,20,000/-, they would pay a sum of Rs. 2,60,000/- to\n the complainant out of that but the same has never been\n paid. Apart from that, there is no other allegation in the\n petition of complaint. It was pointed out on behalf of the\n complainant that the accused fraudulently persuaded the\n complainant to agree so that the accused persons may take\n steps for moving the Consumer Forum in relation to a\n claim of Rs. 4,20,000/-. It is well settled that every breach\n of contract would not give rise to an offence of cheating\n and only in those cases breach of contract would amount\n to cheating where there was any deception played at the\n very inception. If the intention to cheat has developed,\n later on, the same cannot amount to cheating. In the\n present case, it has nowhere been stated that at the very\n inception there was any intention on behalf of the accused\n persons to cheat which is a condition precedent for an\n offence Under \nSection 420\n of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n 7. In our view petition of complaint does not disclose any\n criminal offence at all much less any offence either Under\n Section 420 or \nSection 120B\n of the Indian Penal Code and\n the present case is a case of purely civil dispute between\n the parties for which remedy lies before a Civil Court by\n filing a properly constituted suit. In our opinion, in view of\n these facts allowing the police investigation to continue\n would amount to an abuse of the process of Court and to\n prevent the same it was just and expedient for the High\n Court to quash the same by exercising the powers Under\n \nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure which it\n has erroneously refused.\"\n\n [22]\n\n23. \nIn the matter of \nIndian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd. and\nOrs.26\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was again considering the scope and\nambit of \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. in the context of an offence\npunishable under \nSections 405\n/\n420\n/\n403\n and \n415\n of the IPC. In \nthe said\ndecision\n, the complaint in question was found to be maintainable only\nwith respect to an offence punishable under \nSections 450\n and \n425\n of the\nIPC and the other offences were found to have been rightly quashed by\nthe High Court.\n \nThe Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nVir\nPrakash Sharma v. Anil Kumar Agarwal & Anr27\n was considering the\ntenability of the offence under \nSections 406\n/\n409\n/\n420\n and \n417\n of the IPC.\nThe cognizance was taken against the appellants therein and the summon\nwas issued to them. The appellants approached the High Court, however,\nthe High Court refused to exercise its jurisdiction on the ground that the\nallegation against the accused therein was factual in nature and cannot be\nadjudicated in the exercise of power under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the well-settled legal position that\nif the allegations contained in the complaint even if taken on face value\nand taken to be correct in their entirety, do not disclose an offence, the\nHigh Court can exercise its power under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C and\nquashed the complaint/FIR. In the said case, the dispute was found to be\nessentially of a civil nature. Non-payment or underpayment of the price\nof the goods itself does not amount to the commission of an offence of\ncheating or criminal breach of trust. Finally, paragraph No.17 of the\njudgment of the High Court was set aside and the order of taking\ncognizance was quashed.\n\n26\n\n (2006) 6 SCC 736\n\n27\n\n (2007) 7 SCC 373\n\n [23]\n\n24. \nIn the matter of \nInder Mohan Goswami & Anr. v. State of\nUttaranchal28\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the validity\nof FIR under \nSection 420\n/\n467\n of the IPC against the appellants therein\nagainst whom non-bailable warrants were also issued. The allegations\ntherein against the accused were that the accused allegedly had\ncommitted an offence of cheating in connivance with other accused by\nselling a portion of their land to a third party and by cancelling the\nGeneral Power of Attorney. The complainant therein after the filing of\nthe criminal complaint also instituted a civil suit against the appellant\ntherein. The appellant/accused, therein, filed a petition under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition on\nthe ground that the record demonstrated that the allegation in the FIR\nconstitutes an offence as alleged by the complainant therein.\n \nThe Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in \nthe said decision\n of \nInder Mohan Goswami\n (supra)\nmade reference to various earlier decisions including the decisions of the\nEnglish Courts and analyzed the relevant provisions of law with respect\nto \nsections 420\n, \n415\n and \n467\n of the IPC. It has been held that inherent\npowers under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. can be exercised: -\n\n(i) to give effect to an order under the court,\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and\n(iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice.\n\n It has also been held that if any abuse of the process leading to\ninjustice is brought to the notice of the court, then the court would be\njustified in preventing injustice by invoking inherent powers in absence\nof specific provisions in the statute.\n\n28\n\n (2007) 12 SCC 1\n\n [24]\n\n25. The Hon'ble Supreme Court after analyzing the relevant Sections\nof the \nIPC\n has held that the court must ensure that criminal prosecution is\nnot used as an instrument of harassment or for seeking private vendetta\nor with an ulterior motive to pressurize the accused. It has also been held\nthat it is neither possible nor desirable to lay down an inflexible rule that\nwould govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdictions\nof the High Courts under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C., though wide, have\nto be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when it is\njustified by the tests specifically \nlaid down in\n the statute itself.\n\n26. \nIn the decision of \nSuneet Gupta v. Anil Triloknath Sharma &\nOrs.29\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while affirming the order of the High\nCourt of quashing an FIR for offences punishable under Sections\n468/406 read with 120B of the \nIPC\n, has noticed that the High Court\nrightly quashed the FIR as \nin that case\n one partner was trying to drag the\nprincipal company into criminal litigation to recover dues which the\nprincipal had paid to the other partner. It was also noted that the dispute\ntherein was a tripartite civil dispute and the same was given a colour of\ncriminality.\n\n27. \nIn the matter of \nGorige Pentaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh &\nOrs30\n, the appellant therein was aggrieved by the judgment passed by the\nHigh Court, whereby, his petition was dismissed for quashing of the FIR\nfor offences punishable under \nSection 3(1)(x)\n of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and under\n\nSection 447\n/\n427\n/\n506\n of the IPC. The Hon'ble Supreme Court made the\nreference to the decided cases on the subject and has held that inherent\n\n29\n\n (2008) 11 SCC 670\n\n30\n\n (2008) 12 SCC 531\n\n [25]\n\npower under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised by the High\nCourt for the advancement of justice. The complaint\n, \nin that case\n, was\nfound to be a total abuse of the law.\n\n28. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nR. Kalyani v. Janak\nC. Mehta & Ors31\n while considering various earlier decisions as have\nbeen referred hereinabove including the decision in the case of \nRajesh\nBajaj v. State NCT of Delhi32\n, \nHamida v. Rashid33\n, \nSunita Jain v.\nPawan Kumar Jain34\n, \nState of Orissa v. Saroj Kumar Sahoo35\n, \nKailash\nVerma v. Punjab State Civil Supplies Corpn.36 Monika Kumar\n v. State\nof U.P37 has held that the following proposition of law would emerge\nfrom \nthe said decision\n.\n\n \"15. Propositions of law which emerge from the said\n decisions are:\n\n (1) The High Court ordinarily would not exercise its\n inherent jurisdiction to quash a criminal proceeding and,\n in particular, a First Information Report unless the\n allegations contained therein, even if given face value and\n taken to be correct in their entirety, disclosed no\n cognizable offence.\n\n (2) For the said purpose, the Court, save and except in\n very exceptional circumstances, would not look to any\n document relied upon by the defence.\n (3) Such a power should be exercised very sparingly. If the\n allegations made in the FIR disclose the commission of an\n offence, the court shall not go beyond the same and pass\n\n31\n\n (2009) 1 SCC 516\n\n32\n\n (1999) 3 SCC 259\n\n33\n\n (2008) 1 SCC 474\n\n34\n\n (2008) 2 SCC 705\n\n35\n\n (2005) 13 SCC 540\n\n36\n\n (2005) 2 SCC 571\n\n37\n\n (2008) 8 SCC 781\n\n [26]\n\n an order in favour of the accused to hold the absence of\n any mens rea or actus reus.\n\n (4) If the allegation discloses a civil dispute, the same by\n itself may not be a ground to hold that the criminal\n proceedings should not be allowed to continue.\"\n\n28.1 Having held so, the Hon'ble Supreme Court went on to observe\nthat no hard and fast rule can be laid down. Each case has to be\nconsidered on its own merit and the High Court should not hesitate to\nexercise its jurisdiction in appropriate cases. One of the paramount duties\nof the superior courts is to see that a person who is apparently innocent is\nnot subjected to prosecution and humiliation on the basis of a false and\nwholly untenable complaint.\n\n29. Finally, the Hon'ble Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the\nHigh Court, whereby, the complaint in question was set aside by the\nHigh Court. The same legal position had been reiterated by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the decision of \nDalip Kaur & Ors. v. Jagnar Singh &\nAnr38\n whereby the offence involved was that under \nSections 406\n and \n420\n\nof the IPC and the question which was decided by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt was whether a breach of contract of an agreement for sale would\nconstitute an offence for the aforesaid Sections. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt came to the conclusion that the High Court did not correctly\nexercise its power and, accordingly, the matter was remitted back for\nfresh consideration.\n\n30. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Kishan Singh\nthrough LRs v. Gurpal Singh & Ors39 was considering the tenability of\nan FIR under \nSections 420\n/\n423\n/\n467\n/\n468\n/\n471\n/\n120B\n of the IPC which was\n\n38\n\n (2009) 14 SCC 696\n\n39\n\n (2010) 8 SCC 775\n\n [27]\n\nquashed by the High Court placing reliance on the decree of the civil\ncourt between the same parties in respect of the subject matter. In\nparagraph No.25 of the said decision, it was found that FIR was lodged\nwith the sole intention to harass the respondents therein. The FIR was\nlodged in the year 2002 and the allegations in the FIR were substantially\nsimilar to the allegation made in the civil suit filed in the year 1996. It\nwas found that FIR was filed with inordinate delay and there was no\nplausible explanation for the same. In paragraph No.21 of the said\ndecision, it is noted that prompt and an early recording of the occurrence\nby the informant with its vivid details gives an assurance regarding the\ntruth of its version. In case, there is some delay involving the FIR, the\ncomplainant must give an explanation for the same. It has also been held\nthat undoubtedly, delay in lodging the FIR does not make the\ncomplainants‟ case improbable when such delay is properly explained.\nHowever, deliberate delay in lodging the complaint is always fatal. It has\nalso been held that in cases where there is a delay in lodging an FIR, the\ncourt has to look for a plausible explanation for such delay. In the\nabsence of such an explanation, the delay may be fatal. The reason for\nquashing such proceedings may not be merely that allegations were an\nafterthought or had given a coloured version of the event, in such cases,\nthe court should carefully examine the facts before it for the reason that a\nfrustrated litigant who failed to succeed before the civil case may initiate\ncriminal proceedings just to harass the other side with mala fide intention\nor the ulterior motive of wreaking vengeance on the other party.\nParagraph No.21 to 26 are being reproduced as under:\n\n \n\"21. Prompt and early reporting of the occurrence by the\n informant with all its vivid details gives an assurance\n\n [28]\n\nregarding the truth of its version. In case, there is some\ndelay in filing the FIR, the complainant must give an\nexplanation for the same. Undoubtedly, a delay in lodging\nthe FIR does not make the complainant's case improbable\nwhen such a delay is properly explained. However,\ndeliberate delay in lodging the complaint is always fatal.\nvide: \nSahib Singh v. State of Haryana\n, (1997) 7 SCC 231\n\n22. In cases where there is a delay in lodging an FIR, the\nCourt has to look for a plausible explanation for such\ndelay. In absence of such an explanation, the delay may be\nfatal. The reason for quashing such proceedings may not\nbe mere that the allegations were an afterthought or had\ngiven a coloured version of events. In such cases, the court\nshould carefully examine the facts before it for the reason\nthat a frustrated litigant who failed to succeed before the\nCivil Court may initiate criminal proceedings just to\nharass the other side with mala fide intentions or the\nulterior motive of wreaking vengeance on the other party.\nChagrined and frustrated litigants should not be permitted\nto give vent their frustrations by cheaply invoking the\njurisdiction of the criminal court. The court proceedings\nought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of\nharassment and persecution. In such a case, where an FIR\nis lodged clearly with a view to spite the other party\nbecause of a private and personal grudge and to enmesh\nthe other party in long and arduous criminal proceedings,\nthe court may take a view that it amounts to an abuse of\nthe process of law in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase.\n\n(vide: \nChandrapal Singh and Ors. v. Maharaj Singh and\nAnr.\n; \nState of Haryana and Ors. v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and\nOrs.\n; \nG. Sagar Suri and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Ors.\n; and\n\nGorige Pentaiah v. State of A.P. and Ors\n.\n\n23. The case before us relates to a question of the\ngenuineness of the agreement to sell dated 4.1.1988. The\nsaid agreement was between Kishori Lal and the\nrespondents and according to the terms of the said\nagreement, the sale deed was to be executed by 10.6.1989.\nAs the sale deed was not executed within the said time, suit\n\n [29]\n\nfor specific performance was filed by the other party in\n1989 which was decreed in 1996.\n\n24. So far as the present appellants are concerned,\nagreement to sell dated 22.10.1988 was executed in favour\nof their father and the sale deed was to be executed by\n15.6.1989. No action was taken till 1996 for non-execution\nof the sale deed. The appellants' father approached the\ncourt after 7 years by filing Suit No. 81/1996 for specific\nperformance. However, by that time, the suit filed by the\npresent respondents stood decreed. The appellants' father\nfiled another Suit No. 1075/96 for setting aside the\njudgment and decree passed in favour of the respondents 1\nto 4. The said suit was dismissed by the Additional District\nJudge (Senior Division), Khanna on 10.6.2002.\nSubsequently, the appellants preferred RFA No. 2488/02\non 15.7.2002 against the aforesaid order, and the said\nappeal is still pending before the Punjab & Haryana High\nCourt.\n\n25. It is to be noted that the appellants' father Kishan\nSingh lodged FIR No. 144/02 on 23.7.2002 through his\nattorney Jaswant Singh Mann under \nSections\n420\n/\n323\n/\n467\n/\n468\n/\n471\n/\n120B\n IPC, against the respondents.\nThe allegations made in the FIR were substantially similar\nto the allegations made by the appellants in Civil Suit No.\n1075/96, which had been decided against them. It is\nevident that the aforesaid FIR was filed with inordinate\ndelay and there has been no plausible explanation for the\nsame. The appellants lodged the aforesaid FIR only after\nmeeting their Waterloo in the Civil Court. Thus, it is\nevident that the FIR was lodged with the sole intention of\nharassing the respondents and enmeshing them in long\nand arduous criminal proceedings. We are of the view that\nsuch an action on the part of the appellants' father would\nnot be bona fide, and the criminal proceedings initiated by\nhim against the respondents amount to an abuse of the\nprocess of law.\n\n26. In view of the above, and to do substantial justice, we\nare not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the\nHigh Court quashing the criminal proceedings against the\n\n [30]\n\n respondents in spite of the fact that the impugned judgment\n dated 13.02.2009 passed in Criminal Misc. No. 4136 of\n 2003 is not sustainable in the eyes of law.\"\n\n31. \nIn the matter of \nBinod Kumar & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr.40\n,\nthe Hon‟ble Supreme Court was considering the charges under \nSection\n406\n of the IPC and whether criminal complaint for criminal breach of\ntrust for allegedly retaining the bill amount payable by the respondent\nNo.2 therein was liable to be quashed. While placing reliance on earlier\ndecisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs no.17 to 19 has held\nas under:\n\n \"17. \nSection 420\n IPC deals with cheating. Essential\n ingredients of \nSection 420\n IPC are: - (i) cheating; (ii)\n dishonest inducement to deliver property or to make, alter\n or destroy any valuable security or anything which is\n sealed or signed or is capable of being converted into a\n valuable security, and (iii) mens rea of the accused at the\n time of making the inducement.\n\n 18. In the present case, looking at the allegations in the\n complaint on the face of it, we find no allegations are\n made attracting the ingredients of \nSection 405\n IPC.\n Likewise, there are no allegations as to cheating or the\n dishonest intention of the appellants in retaining the\n money in order to have wrongful gain to themselves or\n causing wrongful loss to the complainant. Excepting the\n bald allegations that the appellants did not make payment\n to the second respondent and that the appellants utilized\n the amounts either by themselves or for some other work,\n there is no iota of allegation as to the dishonest intention\n in misappropriating the property. To make out a case of\n criminal breach of trust, it is not sufficient to show that\n money has been retained by the appellants. It must also be\n shown that the appellants dishonestly disposed of the same\n in some way or dishonestly retained the same. The mere\n\n40\n\n (2014) 10 SCC 663\n\n [31]\n\n fact that the appellants did not pay the money to the\n complainant does not amount to criminal breach of trust.\n\n 19. Even if all the allegations in the complaint taken at the\n face value are true, in our view, the basic essential\n ingredients of dishonest misappropriation and cheating\n are missing. Criminal proceedings are not a short cut for\n other remedies. Since no case of criminal breach of trust\n or dishonest intention of inducement is made out and the\n essential ingredients of \nSections 405\n/\n420\n IPC are missing,\n the prosecution of the appellants under \nSections 406\n/\n120B\n\n IPC, is liable to be quashed.\"\n\n32. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nVinod Natesan v.\nState of Kerala & Ors.41\n was considering a case with respect to an\noffence under Section 420/406 read with \nSection 34\n of the IPC, where,\nthe allegations were that the accused after entering into the agreement\nwith the complainant with regard to the availing of intellectual services\nfor marketing the products of the complainant, the accused did not pay\nthe amount due and payable in the agreement. It was alleged that only\npart payment was made and the remaining payment was not made and\nthe accused therein backed out from the agreement and thereby the\naccused had committed that offence as alleged therein. The High Court\n\nin that case\n exercised its power under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. and\nquashed the complaint, therefore, the complainant approached the\nHon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court affirmed the order\npassed by the High Court and dismissed the appeal. Paragraph No.10 and\n11 of \nthe said decision\n are being reproduced as under:\n\n \"10. Having heard the Appellant as party in person and\n the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of the original\n Accused as well as the State of Kerala and considering the\n judgment and order passed by the High Court, we are of\n\n41\n\n (2019) 2 SCC 401\n\n [32]\n\nthe opinion that the learned High Court has not committed\nany error in quashing the criminal proceedings initiated\nby the complainant. Even considering the allegations and\naverments made in the FIR and the case on behalf of the\nAppellant, it cannot be said that the ingredients of Sections\n406 and 420 are at all satisfied. The dispute between the\nparties at the most can be said to be the civil dispute and it\nis tried to be converted into the criminal dispute.\n\nTherefore, we are also of the opinion that continuing the\ncriminal proceedings against the Accused will be an abuse\nof process of law and, therefore, the High Court has\nrightly quashed the criminal proceedings. Merely because\nthe original Accused might not have paid the amount due\nand payable under the agreement or might not have paid\nthe amount in lieu of one month Notice before terminating\nthe agreement by itself cannot be said to be a cheating\nand/or having committed offence Under \nSections 406\n and\n\n420\n of the Indian Penal Code as alleged. We are in\ncomplete agreement with the view taken by the High\nCourt.\n\n11. In so far as the submissions made on behalf of the\nAppellant-party in person that initially the learned Judge\ndismissed the application and, thereafter when the\njudgment was dictated and pronounced, the learned Judge\nhas allowed the application and, therefore, the impugned\njudgment and order passed by High Court is required to\nbe quashed and set aside is concerned, the aforesaid has\nno substance. What is produced as P-45 is the docket of\nthe file, which does not bear the signature of the learned\nJudge. Therefore, it cannot be said that initially the\nlearned Judge dismissed the petition and, thereafter, when\nthe judgment was pronounced the order was changed and\nthe application was allowed. Even otherwise, as observed\nhereinabove, we are more than satisfied that there was no\ncriminality on part of the Accused and a civil dispute is\ntried to be converted into a criminal dispute. Thus, to\ncontinue the criminal proceedings against the Accused\nwould be an abuse of the process of law. Therefore, the\nHigh Court has rightly exercised the powers Under\n\nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure and has\n\n [33]\n\n rightly quashed the criminal proceedings. In view of the\n aforesaid and for the reasons stated above, the present\n appeal fails and deserves to be dismissed and is\n accordingly dismissed.\"\n\n33. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nAnand Kumar Mohatta\n& Anr. v. State (NCT of Delhi), Department of Home & Anr.42\n was\nconsidering a case, wherein, the challenge made by the accused in the\nFIR for an offence punishable under \nSection 406\n of the IPC was rejected\nby the High Court, therefore, the accused therein was before the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in an SLP. The dispute had arisen out of the agreement\ndated 03.06.1993 entered into between the accused and the complainant\ntherein. The FIR was lodged about 21 years after the agreement. In that\ncase, initially, the FIR was also lodged against the wife of one of the\naccused but no offence was found to have been committed after the\ninvestigation. The agreement was with respect to the development of the\nproperty owned by the accused. The property was situated at Feroz Shah\nRoad, New Delhi. The parties agreed to develop the said property by\nconsidering a high-rise building comprising flats. The complainant\ntherein paid a sum of Rs. One crore as per the agreement. The agreement\ncould not be fulfilled on account of new building regulations. The\nappellant therein wrote a letter that he does not wish to develop the\nproperty. The amount received by the appellant therein admittedly was\nnot returned to the complainant. A complaint was filed by the\ncomplainant therein on 19.11.2011 for an offence punishable under\n\nSection 406\n of the IPC. It was alleged that the accused was guilty of an\noffence under Section 406 since he had clandestinely and surreptitiously\ntransferred the subject property in the name of his wife i.e., co-accused\n\n42\n\n (2019) 11 SCC 706\n\n [34]\n\ntherein and the said act was done to defeat the agreement dated\n03.06.1993. While placing reliance on earlier decisions of the Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in paragraphs Nos.23 to 25 has held as under:\n\n \"23. We, thus find that it is not possible to hold that the\n amount of Rs. One crore which was paid along with the\n development agreement as a deposit can be said to have\n been entrustment of property which has been dishonestly\n converted to his own use or disposed of in violation of any\n direction of law or contract by the Appellant. The\n Appellants have not used the amount nor misappropriated\n it contrary to any direction of law or contract which\n prescribes how the amount has to be dealt with. Going by\n the agreement dated 03.06.1993, the amount has to be\n returned upon the handing over of the constructed area of\n the owner which admittedly has not been done. Most\n significantly the Respondent No. 2 has not demanded the\n return of the amount at any point of time. In fact, it is the\n specific contention of the Respondent No. 2 that he has not\n demanded the amount because the agreement is still in\n subsistence.\n\n 24. We do not see how it can be contended by any stretch\n of imagination that the Appellants have misappropriated\n the amount or dishonestly used the amount contrary to any\n law or contract. In any case, we find that the dispute has\n the contours of a dispute of civil nature and does not\n constitute a criminal offence.\n\n 25. Having given our anxious consideration, we are of the\n view that assuming that there is a security deposit of Rs.\n One Crore and that he has misappropriated the dispute\n between the two parties can only be a civil dispute.\"\n\n33.1 The Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the order passed by the High\nCourt and quashed the FIR and chargesheet filed against the\naccused/appellant therein. It was found that the prosecution was mala\nfide untenable and solely intended to harass the appellant therein. It was\n\n [35]\n\nalso held that the respondent/complainant therein having failed to\nsucceed to recover the deposited amount through a civil action tried to\nimplicate the accused therein with mala fide intent. Paragraphs No.31 to\n33 are also reproduced as under:\n\n \"31. We find that the prosecution is mala fide, untenable\n and solely intended to harass the Appellants. We are\n forfeited in view of the Respondent not having made any\n attempt to recover the deposit of Rs. One Crore through a\n civil action.\n\n 32. We have, therefore, no hesitation in quashing the FIR\n and the charge sheet filed against the Appellants. Hence,\n the FIR No. 0139/2014 dated 20.08.2014 and charge sheet\n dated 03.08.2018 are hereby quashed.\n\n 33. For the aforesaid reasons, we hereby set aside the\n impugned judgment and order dated 02.02.2016 of High\n Court of Delhi. Accordingly, appeal is allowed along with\n the application filed by the Appellants seeking amendment\n of main prayer.\"\n\n34. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this decision while taking note of\nthe decision in the case of \nIndian Oil Corporation\n (supra) has held that\nthere is a growing tendency in a business circle to convert purely civil\ndisputes into criminal cases.\n \nThe said expression has been made keeping\nin mind the observations made by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the\ndecision of \nIndian Oil Corporation\n (supra). In Paragraph No.13 therein,\nit was held that any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not\ninvolve any criminal offence, by applying pressure through criminal\nprosecution should be deprecated and discouraged.\n\n35. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nProf. R. K.\nVijayasarathy & Anr. v. Sudha Seetharam & Anr.\n (supra) was\nconsidering the prayer of the accused-appellant therein to quash the\n\n [36]\n\ncriminal proceedings instituted by the complainant and the challenge to\nthe criminal proceedings was rejected by the High Court. In that case,\nFIR for an offence punishable under Sections 405/406/415/420 read with\n\nSection 34\n of the IPC was registered against the appellant therein in\nparagraphs No.25 to 30. Following observations have been made by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court, the same is reproduced as under:-\n\n \"25. The suit for recovery of money was instituted by the\n son of the Appellants against the first Respondent in 2013.\n The complaint alleging offences under the Penal Code was\n filed by the first Respondent belatedly in 2016. It is clear\n from the face of the complaint, that no amount was\n entrusted by the first Respondent to either of the\n Appellants and there was no dishonest inducement of the\n first Respondent by the Appellants to deliver any property.\n As stated by the first Respondent in the complaint, the\n money belonged to the son of the Appellants. It was\n transferred by the Appellants' son to her on his own\n volition. The money was alleged to have been returned to\n the Appellants on the instructions of their son. A plain\n reading of the complaint thus shows that the ingredients\n necessary for constituting offences Under Sections 405,\n 415 and 420 of the Penal Code are not made out.\n\n \n26. The Respondents have relied on the decision of this\n Court in \nRajesh Bajaj v. State of NCT of Delhi\n: (1999) 3\n SCC 259. In that case, the Delhi High Court had quashed\n an FIR alleging an offence Under Section 420 of the Penal\n Code on the ground that the complaint did not disclose the\n commission of any offence. Allowing the complainant's\n appeal, this Court held thus:\n\n \"9. It is not necessary that a complainant should\n verbatim reproduce in the body of his complaint all\n the ingredients of the offence he is alleging. Nor is\n it necessary that the complainant should state in so\n many words that the intention of the Accused was\n dishonest or fraudulent. Splitting up of the\n definition into different components of the offence\n\n [37]\n\n to make a meticulous scrutiny, whether all the\n ingredients have been precisely spelled out in the\n complaint, is not the need at this stage. If factual\n foundation for the offence has been laid in the\n complaint the court should not hasten to quash\n criminal proceedings during investigation stage\n merely on the premise that one or two ingredients\n have not been stated with details...\"\n\n The decision does not advance the submission of\n the first Respondent. As we have noted above, the\n complaint in the present case is bereft of the basic\n facts necessary to constitute the offences alleged\n Under Sections 405, 406, 415 and 420 of the Penal\n Code.\n\n27. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant contended\nthat the actions of the first Respondent constitute an abuse\nof process of the court. It is contended that the present\ndispute is of a civil nature and the first Respondent has\nattempted to cloak it with a criminal flavor to harass the\naged Appellants. It is also contended that there is an undue\ndelay in filing the complaint from which the present appeal\narises, and this demonstrates the mala fide intention of the\nfirst Respondent in filing the complaint against the\nAppellants. Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants\nrelied on the decision of this Court in \nState of Karnataka v.\nL Muniswamy\n: (1977) 2 SCC 699. In that case, the\nprosecution alleged that eight of the Accused had\nconspired to kill the complainant. The Karnataka High\nCourt quashed the proceedings on the ground that no\nsufficient ground was made out against the Accused. A\nthree judge Bench of this Court dismissed the appeal by\nthe State with the following observations:\n\n \"7. ...In the exercise of this wholesome power, the\n High Court is entitled to quash a proceeding if it\n comes to the conclusion that allowing the\n proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the\n process of the Court or that the ends of justice\n require that the proceeding ought to be quashed.\n\n [38]\n\n The saving of the High Court's inherent powers,\n both in civil and criminal matters, is designed to\n achieve a salutary public purpose which is that a\n court proceeding ought not to be permitted to\n degenerate into a weapon of harassment or\n persecution. In a criminal case, the veiled object\n behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the\n material on which the structure of the prosecution\n rests and the like would justify the High Court in\n quashing the proceeding in the interest of\n justice.\"\n\n28. The jurisdiction Under \nSection 482\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure has to be exercised with care. In the\nexercise of its jurisdiction, a High Court can examine\nwhether a matter which is essentially of a civil nature has\nbeen given a cloak of a criminal offence. Where the\ningredients required to constitute a criminal offence are\nnot made out from a bare reading of the complaint, the\ncontinuation of the criminal proceeding will constitute an\nabuse of the process of the court.\n\n29. In the present case, the son of the Appellants has\ninstituted a civil suit for the recovery of money against the\nfirst Respondent. The suit is pending. The first Respondent\nhas filed the complaint against the Appellants six years\nafter the date of the alleged transaction and nearly three\nyears from the filing of the suit. The averments in the\ncomplaint, read on its face, do not disclose the ingredients\nnecessary to constitute offences under the Penal Code. An\nattempt has been made by the first Respondent to cloak a\ncivil dispute with a criminal nature despite the absence of\nthe ingredients necessary to constitute a criminal offence.\nThe complaint filed by the first Respondent against the\nAppellants constitutes an abuse of process of court and is\nliable to be quashed.\n\n30. For the above reasons, the appeal is allowed. The\njudgment of the High Court is set aside and the criminal\nproceedings arising from PCR 2116 of 2016 instituted by\nthe first Respondent against the Appellants are quashed.\nWe however clarify, that no opinion has been expressed on\n\n [39]\n\n the merits of the pending civil suit filed by the son of the\n Appellants for the recovery of money. The pending suit\n shall be disposed of in accordance with the law.\"\n\n36. On the basis of the aforesaid legal position and for the purposes of\nthe present case, this court is of the considered view that the High Court\nis well within its jurisdiction to quash the FIR even at its nascent stage if\nthe following conditions are fulfilled: -\n\n(i) If the allegations made in the FIR, even if are accepted to be true\n in their entirety, the same would not constitute prima facie\n commission of offence alleged in the FIR;\n\n(ii) If the matter is essentially of a civil nature and has been given a\n cloak of a criminal offence.\n\n(iii) If the allegations made in the FIR are so absurd and inherently\n improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach\n a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding\n against the accused.\n\n37. The delay in lodging of the FIR may by itself not be the reason for\nquashing the FIR, however, the same can always be taken into\nconsideration to appreciate the truthfulness or genuineness of the\ncomplaint in question.\n\n38. Coming back to the facts of the present case, as stated in the initial\nparagraphs, it would be seen that the entire allegation made against the\npresent petitioners is that the petitioners are son and wife of Bhai Manjit\nSingh. The main accused i.e., Bhai Manjit Singh had introduced the\npresent petitioners to the complainant to sell the property in dispute to\nthe complainant.\n\n [40]\n\n39. It is, thus, alleged in the complaint that accused Nos.1 to 4\ndeliberately committed fraud by misrepresenting that the accused No.2 is\nthe Karta of accused No.1 in the year 2004. Whereas, according to the\ncomplaint, it was found that accused No.2 had already resigned as Karta\nof accused No.1 and instead accused No.4 was recognized as Karta of\naccused No.1. It is, thus, further reiterated that accused Nos.1 to 4,\ntherefore, played fraud upon the complainant by misrepresenting the\nstatus of accused No.2 as Karta. It is also alleged that the present\npetitioners had acknowledged the sale of the property as well as the\npayment made by the complainant towards advance. Receipt of the\namount so received by the main accused, namely, Bhai Manjit Singh was\nwitnessed by the present petitioners. One of the receipts on page No.97\nof the reply is being reproduced so as to understand the actual recital\nmade therein.\n\n ― RECEIPT\n Received a sum of Rs. 31,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty One\n Lacs Only) as earnest money from Mr.. Punit Beriwala, s/o\n Shri S.S. Beriwala, r/o 15/10 Sarvapriya Vihar, New Delhi,\n against the sale of our property No. 28-A, Prithviraj Road,\n New Delhi, admeasuring 3727 sq. yards. The total sale\n consideration agreed upon is Rs. 28 Crore. (Rupees\n Twenty Eight Crores only), further a sum of Rupees Thirty\n lakhs to be made by Thursday.\n\n The sale is subject to the said property being free from all\n kinds' charges, lien, encumbrances, prior sales,\n mortgages, litigations, claims, etc. The Seller has agreed\n to get the said property freehold from the concerned\n authorities at his own expense before the transfer of the\n said property in favor of the PURSHASER i.e Shri Punit\n Beriwal or his nominees\n\n [41]\n\n Sd/-\n\n SELLER.\n\n Bhai Manjit Singh HUF\n Through karta Bhai Manjit Singh\n s/o\n r/o 2 South End Lane, New Delhi\n WITNESS\n\n 1. -SD-\n\n Maheep Singh\n 2 south End Lane, New Delhi\n\n 2. SD/-\n\n Vikramjit Singh\n 2 south End Lane, New Delhi\"\n\n40. It is further alleged in the FIR that on 22.04.2004, the physical\npossession of a part of the property in dispute was handed over by the\naccused No.1 to 4 to the complainant. It is further alleged that accused\nNo.1 to 4 undertook to get the said property unencumbered by making\npayments to various authorities. However, the same was sold to JK Paper\nLtd. It is alleged that the accused Nos.1 to 4 for the very first time vide\nletter dated 23.07.2020 had refused to perform their obligation to\nconclude the sale transaction of the said property as agreed with the\ncomplainant.\n\n41. Having considered the allegations in the FIR in their entirety and\naccepting them to be correct on face value, this court is of the considered\nview that the same does not constitute an offences under \nSections\n467\n/\n468\n/\n471\n/\n420\n/\n120B\n of the IPC. As per paragraph No.7 of the FIR,\nwhen all accused were ready and willing to sell the said property to the\ncomplainant, there was no reason to purport that the accused No.2 was\nthe Karta of accused No.1. There is no written agreement between the\nrespondent No.2 with the petitioners for sale of such a valuable and\n\n [42]\n\nprime property. The only role alleged against the petitioners are that they\nare witnesses to the alleged receipts signed by Bhai Manjit Singh for\nreceipt of part sale consideration. The act of signing the receipt as a\nwitness would not constitute any of the aforesaid offences. The last\npayment admittedly has been made on 03.01.2015 and it is unbelievable\nthat in the year 2005, having made the payment of Rs.1,64,50,000/-\nagainst the total consideration of Rs.28,00,00,000/-, one would not prefer\ngetting a formal agreement executed. The narration of the FIR does not\ndisclose any action/step/effort being made by respondent No.2 between\n\n03.01.2005 to 18.07.2020 i.e., for almost 16 long years. It is again\nbeyond any prudent behaviour that someone who makes a payment of\nRs.1,64,00,000/- in the year 2005 would not even bother to enquire about\nthe further steps to be taken either for the execution of the sale document\nor to enquire about the step being taken by the seller with respect to\nobtaining NOCs etc. for almost 16 years. There is no whisper about any\nsteps being taken by respondent No.2 between 2005 to 2020. Even\naccording to the recital in the FIR, admittedly a part possession of the\nproperty in dispute was handed over to respondent No.2 on 22.04.2004\nitself. The same would conclusively belie the allegation that right from\ninception there had been an intention of cheating respondent No.2.\nRespondent No.2 filed a civil suit on 28.10.2001 before this court\nseeking relief for specific performance, possession and injunction. The\ndate of FIR is 16.06.2022. The application in the civil suit for dismissal\nof the suit under \nOrder VII Rule XI of the CPC\n was dismissed by this\ncourt on 07.02.2022 and against the said order the learned Division\nBench of this court in FAO(OS) No.20/2022 stayed the further\nproceedings of the said civil suit vide order dated 29.03.2022. It is, thus,\n\n [43]\n\napparent that the proceedings of the civil suit have been stayed by the\nDivision Bench of this court on 29.03.2022. It is, thereafter, the instant\nFIR dated 16.06.2022 has been registered.\n\n42. Cheating is defined in \nSection 415\n of the IPC and is punishable\nunder \nSection 420\n of the IPC. \nSection 415\n of the IPC is set out below:\n\n \"Section 415: - Cheating\n Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or\n dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver\n any property to any person, or to consent that any\n person shall retain any property, or intentionally\n induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do\n anything which he would not do or omit if he were not\n so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is\n likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body,\n mind, reputation or property, is said to 'cheat'.\n Explanation. -A dishonest concealment of facts is a\n deception within the meaning of this section.\"\n\nSection 415 thus requires: -\n\n1. Deception of any person.\n\n2. (a) Fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person-\n\n (i) to deliver any property to any person; or\n\n (ii) to consent that any person shall retain any property; or\n\n(b) Intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which\nhe would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or\nomission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in\nbody, mind, reputation or property.\n\n43. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nInder Mohan\nGoswami\n (supra) while considering the FIR lodged under \nSection\n467\n/\n420\n/\n120B\n of the IPC has held as under: -\n\n [44]\n\n\"42. On a reading of the aforesaid section, it is manifest\nthat in the definition there are two separate classes of acts\nwhich the person deceived may be induced to do. In the\nfirst class of acts he may be induced fraudulently or\ndishonestly to deliver property to any person. The second\nclass of acts is the doing or omitting to do anything which\nthe person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were\nnot so deceived. In the first class of cases, the inducing\nmust be fraudulent or dishonest. In the second class of\nacts, the inducing must be intentional but need not be\nfraudulent or dishonest. Therefore, it is the intention which\nis the gist of the offence. To hold a person guilty of\ncheating it is necessary to show that he had a fraudulent or\ndishonest intention at the time of making the promise.\nFrom his mere failure to subsequently keep a promise, one\ncannot presume that he all along had a culpable intention\nto break the promise from the beginning.\n\n43. We shall now deal with the ingredients of \nSection 467\n\nIPC. \nSection 467\n IPC reads as under:\n\n \"467. Forgery of valuable security, will etc.--\n Whoever forges a document which purports to\n be a valuable security or a will, or an authority\n to adopt a son, or which purports to give\n authority to any person to make or transfer any\n valuable security, or to receive the principal,\n interest or dividends thereon, or to receive or\n deliver any money, moveable property, or\n valuable security, or any document purporting to\n be an acquittance or receipt acknowledging the\n payment of money, or an acquittance or receipt\n for the delivery of any moveable property or\n valuable security, shall be punished with\n imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of\n either description for a term which may extend\n to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\n\n44. The following ingredients are essential for commission\nof the offence under \nSection 467\n IPC:\n\n 1. the document in question so forged;\n\n [45]\n\n 2. the accused who forged it.\n\n 3. the document is one of the kinds enumerated in the\n aforementioned section.\n\n The basic ingredients of offence under Section 467 are\n altogether missing even in the allegations of the FIR\n against the appellants. Therefore, by no stretch of the\n imagination, the appellants can be legally prosecuted for\n an offence under \nSection 467\n IPC.\n\n 45. Even if all the averments made in the FIR are taken to\n be correct, the case for prosecution under \nSections 420\n\n and \n467\n IPC is not made out against the appellants. To\n prevent abuse of the process and to secure the ends of\n justice, it becomes imperative to quash the FIR and any\n further proceedings emanating therefrom.\n\n 46. The court must ensure that criminal prosecution is not\n used as an instrument of harassment or for seeking private\n vendetta or with an ulterior motive to pressure the\n accused. On analysis of the aforementioned cases, we are\n of the opinion that it is neither possible nor desirable to\n lay down an inflexible rule that would govern the exercise\n of inherent jurisdiction. Inherent jurisdiction of the High\n Courts under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. though wide has to be\n exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only\n when it is justified by the tests specifically \nlaid down in\n the\n Statute itself and in the aforementioned cases. In view of\n the settled legal position, the impugned judgment cannot\n be sustained.\"\n\n44. As has been discussed hereinabove, even as per FIR itself, the part\npossession of the property in dispute was handed over to Respondent\nNo.2 in the year 2004 itself. There is no question of arriving at a\nconclusion that there was a dishonest or fraudulent intention at the\nbeginning of the alleged act to induce the complainant to deliver an\nadvance sum to the accused. So far as \nSection 467\n IPC is concerned, I\nhave examined the entire FIR and there is no allegation of forgery\n\n [46]\n\nagainst the petitioners. Hence, an offence under Sections 467/468 is also\nclearly not made out. None of the documents in the instant case has been\nused as genuine which is known or has been reason to believe to be\nforged and hence, an offence under \nSection 471\n of the IPC is also not be\nattracted. There is no dishonest intention from the inception to induce\nrespondent No.2 to purchase the property in question and it is thus,\nconcluded that accepting all the allegations against the petitioner as\ncorrect in the FIR, no offence as alleged is prima facie made out. The\ncase in hand clearly falls within exception No. (1) and (5) carved out for\nquashing of criminal prosecution in the decision of \nBhajan Lal\n (supra).\nThe allegations made in the FIR against the petitioners constitute purely\na civil dispute and an attempt is being made to cloak them as criminal\noffences.\n \nExceptions No (1) and (5) of Bhajan Lal\n (supra) are\nreproduced as under: -\n\n (1) Where the allegations made in the first information\n report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face\n value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie\n constitute any offence or make out a case against the\n accused.\n\n (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint\n are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of\n which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion\n that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the\n accused.\n\n45. As far as the decision relied upon by the learned senior counsel for\nrespondent No.2 in the case of Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.\n\n [47]\n\n(supra) is concerned, in paragraph No.57 thereof, the principle of law\nthat emerges on the basis of the decisions of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court\nright from the decision of the Privy Council have been reiterated. In\nparagraph No.60 of \nthe said decision\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nclearly held that in a given case, there may be an allegation of abuse of\nprocess of law by converting a civil dispute into a criminal dispute only\nwith a view to pressure the accused.\n\n46. This court in the instant case finds that an effort has been made by\nrespondent No.2 to convert a civil dispute into a criminal case. The\ndecision of \nNeeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra), therefore, would\nnot help the respondents.\n \nThe decision in the case of \nMishrilal\n (supra),\nrelates to FIR under \nSections 147\n/\n148\n/\n149\n and \n324\n of the IPC and\nanother FIR for various offences including an offence under Sections\n302/307 etc. of the \nIPC\n. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph No.8\nof \nthe said decision\n has held that the Investigating Officer submitted the\nchallan on the basis of a complaint lodged by the accused Mishri Lal in\nrespect of the same incident.\n \nIt has been held, it would have been just,\nfair and proper to decide both cases by the same court in view of the\nguideline devised by the Hon‟ble Supreme court in the case of \nNathi Lal\n& Ors. v. State of UP & Anr.43 The\n principle laid down therein is that the\ncross cases should be tried together by the same court irrespective of the\nnature of the offence involved. The aforesaid principle of law is not\ndisputed and does not call for any consideration in the instant case. What\nis being argued by respondent No.2 is that the accused No.2 in the instant\ncase has lodged an FIR against the present respondent No.2 stating\ntherein that the receipts in question are forged. According to respondent\n\n43\n\n 1990 Supp SCC 145\n\n [48]\n\nNo.2 in one place the accused No.2 is alleging that the receipts are false\nand a contrary statement has been made to state that the amount in\nquestion has been received against those receipts and, therefore, the FIR\nwhich has been lodged by the respondent No.2 and the FIR lodged by the\naccused No.2 are cross FIRs and it requires a trial to go on. The aforesaid\narguments do not have any substance for the reason that in the instant\nFIR, this court is only concerned with the allegations made therein and to\nadjudicate as to whether the same would constitute prima facie\ncommission of the offence or not.\n Since it has been held that no prima\nfacie offence in question is made out, therefore, the FIR lodged by\naccused No.2 of the present FIR against respondent No.2 would not bar\nthis court to exercise power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n47. So far as the decision in the case of \nEdmund S. Lyngdoh\n (supra)\nis concerned, in paragraph No.30 therein the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has\nheld that mere delay in lodging the FIR is not necessarily fatal to the\nprosecution case. This court is in respectful agreement with the aforesaid\nlegal position. This court has not exercised its power under \nSection 482\n\nof the Cr.P.C. on the ground of delay alone. The court has proceeded to\nanalyze the allegations made in the FIR as a whole and has contrasted\nthem with the offence lodged against the petitioners and has opined that\nthe offence in question is not prima facie attracted, therefore, the FIR is\nbeing quashed. The delay alone is not the reason but of course is one of\nthe reasons to consider the genuineness and authenticity of the allegation.\nThe Hon‟ble Supreme Court has not said that delay should never be\ntaken into consideration in considering the prayer for quashing of an FIR.\nThe delay of course can be one of the factors to be kept in mind while\n\n [49]\n\nexercising the power under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C in a case of this\nnature.\n\n48. Another decision in the case of \nMGF Developments\n (supra) is in\nthe same line, therefore, the same does not require to be elaborately\ndiscussed except to state that \nin that case\n, a Co-ordinate Bench of this\ncourt has held that if on the reading of complaint, the Magistrate comes\nto a conclusion that cognizable offence is made out then it is his duty to\nregister the FIR. In the present case, this court has considered the entire\nFIR and has opined that no cognizable offence is made out it is for the\nreason \nthe said decision\n would not have any application under the facts\nof the present case.\n \nIn the decision cited by the learned senior counsel for\nthe respondent in the case of \nSyed Askari Hadi Ali Augustine Imam\n\n(supra), the legal position expounded therein is well settled that\nordinarily criminal proceedings will have primacy over civil proceedings.\nPrecedence to criminal proceedings is given having regard to the fact that\nthe disposal of the civil proceedings ordinarily takes a long time and in a\ngiven case civil proceedings as also criminal proceedings may proceed\nsimultaneously. In the present case, this court does not have any doubt\nwith respect to the legal position propounded therein. However, this\ncourt has exercised its power not on the ground that the criminal and civil\nproceedings cannot go simultaneously but on the ground that the instant\nFIR that has been lodged does not constitute a criminal offence rather\ndispute in question has been found to be of civil in nature. It is for this\nreason that this decision would not have any application in the present\ncase.\n\n [50]\n\n49. Another decision in the case of \nLee Kun Hee\n (supra) relied upon\nby respondent No.2 relates to the scope of interference, in the exercise of\npower under \nArticle 226\n against the order of summoning issued by the\nMagistrate. This court has elaborately considered the legal position\npropounding by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in various decisions and has\nfound that the instant case requires exercise under \nSection 482\n of the\nCr.P.C on the basis of the facts and situation involved therein.\n\n50. The decision relied upon by the respondent in the case of \nTrisuns\nChemicals\n (supra) also relates to the scope of \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C.\nin quashing the FIR and the decision in the case of \nRamveer Upadhyay\n& Anr.\n (supra) would also not help the respondents as the facts involved\nin this case clearly calls for interference in the exercise of power under\n\nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C. In the last decision in the case relied upon by\nrespondent No.2 in the case of \nPriti Saraf & Anr\n (supra) in paragraph\nNo.32 therein, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has opined that careful\nreading of the complaint/FIR/chargesheet would clearly disclose the\ncommission of an offence. It has been held that whether the allegations in\nthe complaint or otherwise are correct or not have to be decided based on\nevidence to be led during the course of the trial.\n \nIn the instant case, this\ncourt has held that the reading of the FIR does not disclose a cognizable\noffence and the various decisions of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court as has\nbeen discussed, hereinabove, would clearly show that in case no\ncognizable offence is made out and an effort has been made to give a\ncloak of criminality to a civil dispute, the High Court would be justified\nin exercising its power under \nSection 482\n of the Cr.P.C.. It is, for this\nreason, the decision in the case of \nPriti Saraf & Anr.\n (supra) would not\nhave any application in the facts of the present case.\n\n [51]\n\n51. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the instant petition is allowed\nand FIR No.94 of 2022 registered at Police Station Economic Offences\nWing, Mandir Marg, New Delhi for offences punishable under \nSections\n467\n/\n468\n/\n471\n/\n420\n/\n120B\n of the IPC and all criminal proceedings\nemanating therefrom qua the petitioners are hereby quashed.\n\n52. The petition is disposed of alongwith pending applications.\n\n53. However, any observation made herein would not prejudice any of\nthe rights of the parties in pending civil suit or other proceedings, if any.\n\n (PURUSHAINDRA KUMAR KAURAV)\n JUDGE\nOCTOBER 17, 2022\npriya",

The only allegation in the complaint petition against\n the accused persons is that they assured the complainant\n that when they receive the insurance claim amounting to\n Rs. 4,20,000/-, they would pay a sum of Rs. 2,60,000/- to\n the complainant out of that but the same has never been\n paid.
