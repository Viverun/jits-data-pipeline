By way of filing the instant revision petition, the accused-\n\npetitioner has questioned the validity of the order dated\n\n08.08.2023 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge\n\n(Women Atrocity Cases), Jodhpur Metropolitan, Jodhpur in Session\n\nCase No.55/2022 titled \"State v. Haribhajan Ram\". whereby\n\nthe learned Trial Court has framed charges against the petitioner-\n\naccused under \nSections 498-A\n and \n306\n I.P.C.\n\nBrief facts:-\n\n2. On 07.09.2018 at around 10:00 PM an FIR No.230/2018\n\ncame to be lodged at police station Mandore, District Jodhpur\n\nagainst the petitioner based upon the parcha bayan/statement\n\ngiven by late Smt. Geeta Devi, for the offence punishable under\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (2 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nSection 498A\n IPC. Smt. Geeta Devi stated that she was working as\n\na Constable in RAC First Battalion Mandore, Jodhpur and her\n\nhusband (present petitioner) used to mentally harass her and had\n\ndeserted her for almost ten years. She stated that whenever they\n\ncrossed each other, he used to hurl abuses and threatened to kill\n\nher. She stated that on 05.09.2018 when she went to the Court,\n\nher husband (present petitioner) insulted her and verbally abused\n\nher. She stated that she had informed this fact to her brother\n\nDinesh and her mother & father. She further stated that she\n\nmarried the petitioner-Haribhajan Ram in the year 2004 and gave\n\nbirth to two children namely, son Prakash and daughter Kusum.\n\nShe stated that earlier she had lodged a case for grant of\n\nmaintenance against the present petitioner. She stated that being\n\nfed up with the treatment meted out to her by her husband, on\n\n07.09.2018 she poured petrol upon her body and ignited herself\n\nand thereafter, she was taken to the hospital. She further stated\n\nthat due to the cruelty meted out by her husband, she had\n\nattempted to commit suicide.\n\n3. During the course of her treatment, dying declaration of the\n\ndeceased Smt. Geeta Devi was recorded by Special Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate, NI Act Cases, No.3 Jodhpur, wherein upon a question\n\nbeing asked as to how she got in such a condition, late Smt. Geeta\n\nDevi informed the Magistrate that day before yesterday, there was\n\na date in the Court case, which she had filed against her husband\n\ni.e. present petitioner and during the course of cross-examination,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner had asked her various\n\nuncomfortable questions to her and had tried to cause difficulty for\n\nher on each date. She further stated that her husband had\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (3 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\ntortured her whenever he met her and he used to cause difficulty\n\nfor her and used to level frivolous allegations against her. She\n\nfurther stated that because of the mental tension, she had tried to\n\ncommit suicide, for which, her husband was responsible. She\n\nfurther stated that for the last twelve years, her husband was\n\ncause of unhappiness as he had married somebody else and had\n\nabandoned herself and her children.\n\n4. Smt. Geeta Devi succumbed to the burn injury on\n\n20.09.2018 i.e. around 14 days after the date of incident. The\n\npolice had thereafter recorded the statement of various witnesses,\n\nincluding Mohan Ram - father of the deceased, Dinesh-brother of\n\nthe deceased, Mohani Devi-mother of the deceased, Prakash-son\n\nof the deceased, Pawan Rankawat-advocate of the deceased, and\n\nBharat Sodha and Sulochana i.e. neighbours of the deceased. The\n\npolice after investigation had came to a conclusion that offence\n\npunishable under \nSection 498A\n IPC was made out against the\n\npetitioner. However, post direction issued by the Commissioner of\n\nPolice, Jodhpur dated 26.01.2019, the investigating officer was\n\nchanged and post investigation the police filed the chargesheet\n\nagainst the petitioner for offences punishable under \nSections 498A\n\nand \n306\n IPC. Post taking of cognizance, the matter was listed at\n\nthe stage of framing of charge. The petitioner prayed for discharge\n\nbefore the learned trial Court. However, the learned trial Court\n\nwhile observing that, all the grounds taken by the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner can be decided only at the stage of trial and not\n\nat the stage of framing of charge, proceeded to frame charges\n\nagainst the petitioner for offences punishable under \nSections 498A\n\nand \n306\n IPC.\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (4 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nSubmission by the counsel for the petitioner:-\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, for the\n\npurpose of establishing the offence under \nSection 306\n IPC,\n\nabetment to commit suicide by the accused is a prerequisite. He\n\nfurther submitted that abetment of a thing has been defined under\n\nSection 107\n of IPC, wherein for the purpose of abeting a thing, a\n\nperson has to be shown to instigate any person to do that thing or\n\nto intentionally aid, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of\n\nthat thing. He submitted that both the ingredients are\n\nconspiciously missing in the present case, even if, the case of each\n\nof the prosecution is admitted as it is. He further submitted that\n\neven for bringing home the offence under \nSection 498A\n IPC, the\n\nsubjecting of a woman to cruelty i.e. any wilful conduct which is of\n\nsuch nature as is likely drive the woman to commit suicide has to\n\nbe averred and proved. However, in the present case, there is no\n\nsuch averment whatsoever. He further submitted that a bare\n\nperusal of the dying declaration of the deceased will reveal that\n\nshe made allegations against the counsel for the petitioner that he\n\nhad asked certain uncomfortable questions to her during the\n\ncourse of cross-examination and based upon that she had further\n\nstated that her husband used to harass her whenever she used to\n\ngo to the Court on the dates fixed. He further stated that even\n\nassuming that the deceased had stated that the husband-\n\npetitioner used to level certain wrong allegations against her, then\n\ntoo, no case of cruelty or abetment is made out. He rather\n\nasserted that the perusal of the dying declaration itself will reveal\n\nthat the reason of committing suicide was that the petitioner had\n\nallegedly left the deceased since last twelve years and had\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (5 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\ncontacted second marriage. He submitted that contacting second\n\nmarriage would not make out a case of cruelty or abetment.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the\n\nprosecution itself admits, as per the averment made by Smt.\n\nGeeta Devi in her statement recorded under \nSection 161\n Cr.P.C,\n\nthat the marriage between the parties was solemnized on\n\n21.07.2004 and thereafter the husband had abandoned her in the\n\nyear 2006. He stated that in the year 2009, deceased got\n\nemployed in the HadiRani Battalion of RAC, wherein she had\n\nshown herself to be divorcee while seeking appointment in that\n\ncategory. He stated that as per allegations levelled, whenever the\n\nCourt date was there, the husband used to insult her, but no other\n\nspecific allegation has been leveled against the present petitioner\n\nwith regard to the words used or the nature of harassment etc. He\n\nasserted that it is an admitted fact, based on the statement of late\n\nSmt. Geeta Devi herself, that she and the present petitioner have\n\nbeen living separately for the last eleven years.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that a\n\nperusal of statement of Dinesh i.e. brother of late Smt. Geeta Devi\n\nwill reveal that whenever she used to go to Court, the present\n\npetitioner used to insult her, because of which, she was very sad.\n\nHe further asserted that Dinesh has in so many words, stated that\n\nduring the course of cross-examination, the counsel for the\n\npetitioner had asked certain uncomfortable questions to Smt.\n\nGeeta Devi, due to which, she was mentally upset and thereafter\n\npoured petrol upon herself. He further stated that identical\n\nstatements have been given by father of late Smt. Geeta Devi,\n\nShri Mohan Ram, wherein he also admitted that the petitioner and\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (6 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nlate Smt. Geeta Devi have been living separately since the year\n\n2007. On 05.09.2018 the counsel for the petitioner, one Sahiram\n\nand other one Kanvarlal had threatened Smt. Geeta Devi, due to\n\nwhich, she was very afraid and therefore committed suicide.\n\nIdentical statements have been given by Smt. Mohani Devi i.e.\n\nmother of the deceased.\n\n8. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nJaiprakash i.e. son of late Smt. Geeta Devi, stated in his\n\nstatement, that the petitioner did not used to visit the place where\n\nhe used to stay with his mother. He also stated that on the Court\n\ndate the present petitioner hurled certain abusive words to Smt.\n\nGeeta Devi and no other overt act was attributed to the petitioner.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner further stated that the\n\nstatement of Shri Pawan Rakavat, learned counsel for the\n\ndeceased Smt. Geeta Devi, reveals that he admitted that on the\n\nCourt date there was no conversation between petitioner and\n\ndeceased Smt. Geeta Devi nor was any threat given by the\n\npetitioner to late Smt. Geeta Devi. He further stated that late Smt.\n\nGeeta Devi never informed him about being under any pressure or\n\ndiscomfort due to the petitioner. He further stated that the claim\n\nfor interim maintenance filed by late Smt. Geeta Devi was\n\ndismissed by the trial Court and same was affirmed by the\n\nAppellate Court. He further submitted that against both the\n\nabovementioned orders, a revision petition has been filed before\n\nthe High Court, which is pending consideration. He further stated\n\nthat post the Court date, late Smt. Geeta Devi came along with\n\nthe present petitioner to his chamber and appeared very normal\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (7 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nand on that date there was no talk, altercation or any other thing\n\nbetween the deceased-Smt. Geeta Devi and the present petitioner.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the petitioner lastly submitted that the\n\nstatement of independent witnesses, Mrs. Sulochana and Bharat\n\nSodha will clearly reveal that the deceased Smt. Geeta Devi used\n\nto stay with one Manphool, and on the date of incident, Manphool\n\ntried to save Smt. Geeta Devi. However, she succumbed to the\n\nburn injuries. The counsel thus submitted that perusal of the\n\nstatements and documents will itself reveal that even if what has\n\nbeen stated by the witnesses, as also, the dying declaration of the\n\nthe deceased is treated to be correct as it is, then too, the\n\nnecessary ingredients for offences punishable under \nSections 498A\n\nand \n306\n IPC are not made out. He submitted that the trial Court\n\nhas to apply its mind to the allegations made and the documents\n\navailable on record and there has to be a sifting and weighing of\n\nevidence, though for a limited purpose.\n\n10. He further asserted that the trial Court cannot act as a\n\nmouth piece of the prosecution but must apply its mind to the\n\nrecord of the case and thereafter come to a definite conclusion,\n\nwhether the ingredients of the offence in question are made out or\n\nnot. \nIn order to buttress his submission, learned counsel relied\n\nupon the judgment passed by the Apex Court rendered in the case\n\nof \"\nPatel Babubhai Manohardas and Ors. v. State of\n\nGujarat\n\" 2025 INSC 322 in Criminal Appeal No. 1388 of 2014\n\ndecided on 05.03.2025 and the judgment of this Court rendered in\n\nS.B. Criminal Revision Petition No.1155/2023 titled \"\nMangal\n\nSingh v. State and Ors.\n\" decided on 24.01.2025. He thus\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (8 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nprayed that the order impugned deserves to be quashed and set\n\naside and an order of discharge should have been passed.\n\nSubmission on behalf of counsel for the State and\n\nComplainant:-\n\n11. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor and Mr. Mahesh Thanvi,\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the complainant supported the\n\norder in question and submitted that at the stage of framing of\n\ncharge, the court cannot go into the niceties of the evidence\n\navailable on record and the sifting and weighing of the evidence\n\ncan be done only for limited purpose. Learned counsels further\n\nsubmitted that this Court while exercising powers of revision\n\nunder \nSection 397\n read with \nSection 401\n of Cr.P.C. would not like\n\nto interfere in the matter, as in the case in hand the order is well\n\nreasoned and has been passed after considering the entire\n\nevidence. Learned counsels further submitted that there is no\n\nperversity in the order in question and the order in question has\n\nbeen issued in accordance with law. They further submitted that\n\nthe High Court should not meticulously examine the evidence and\n\nfind out whether the end result would be conviction or not at the\n\nstage of framing of charge. They further submitted that the order\n\nimpugned has rightly been passed. It was further submitted that\n\nthe evidence on record clearly made out the allegations against\n\nthe petitioner with all the necessary ingredients to bring home the\n\noffences punishable under \nSections 306\n and \n498-A\n of IPC.\n\n12. Mr. Mahesh Thanvi, learned counsel vehemently submitted\n\nthat the statement given by the deceased as well as her dying\n\ndeclaration are sufficient to show instigation and abetment on the\n\npart of the petitioner as well as the cruelty meted out by him upon\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (9 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nthe deceased and therefore the order impugned has rightly been\n\npassed. \nIn support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment\n\npassed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of \"\nState of Madhya\n\nPradesh v. Deepak\n\" in S.B. Criminial Appeal No.485/2019\n\ndecided on 13.03.2019.\n\nApplicable law & relevant case law on point in issue:-\n\n As far as the provisions of \nSections 306\n, \n107\n & \n498A\n IPC are\n\nconcerned, the same provide as under:\n\n \"306. Abetment of suicide:--If any person commits suicide,\n whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be\n punished with imprisonment of either description for a term\n which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\n\n \"107. Abetment of a thing:--A person abets the doing of a\n thing, who--\n\n First.--Instigates any person to do that thing; or\n Secondly.--Engages with one or more other person or persons\n in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal\n omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in\n order to the doing of that thing; or\n Thirdly.--Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the\n doing of that thing.\n\n Explanation 1.--A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or\n by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to\n disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or\n procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that\n thing.\"\n\n \"498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting\n her to cruelty:--Whoever, being the husband or the relative of\n the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall\n be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\n three years and shall also be liable to fine.\n Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, \"cruelty\" means--\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to\n drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or\n danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the\n woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with\n a view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (10 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on\n account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet\n such demand.\"\n\n13. A clear reading of the plain language of these Sections will\n\nreveal that to attract the ingredients of \nSection 306\n IPC, the\n\naccused should have abeted the commission of suicide. A person\n\nis said to abet the doing of a thing who instigate any person to do\n\nthat thing or engages in conspiracy with one or more persons for\n\ndoing of that thing and if an act or illegal omission takes place in\n\npursuance of that conspiracy and in order to commit that thing or\n\nintentionally aids by act or illegal omission. However, for the\n\npresent case, as far as the provisions under \nSection 498A\n IPC are\n\nconcerned, it will reveal that to bring home the ingredients of\n\noffence punishable under this Section, it was on the part of the\n\nprosecution to show that the husband did any wilful conduct which\n\nis of such nature as is likely to instigate the woman to commit\n\nsuicide.\n\n14. As far as the provisions of \nSection 306\n IPC are concerned,\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \"\nRamesh Kumar v. State\n\nof Chhattisgarh\n\" (2001) 9 SCC 618 had observed as under:\n\n \"20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite\n or encourage to do 'an act'. To satisfy the requirement of\n instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must be\n used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must\n necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence.\n Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be\n capable of being spelt out. The present one is not a case where\n the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued\n course of conduct created such circumstances that the\n deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide\n in which case an instigation may have been inferred. A word\n uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without intending the\n consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be\n instigation.\"\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (11 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n15. Subsequently, in the case of \"\nM. Mohan v. State\n\" (2011) 3\n\nSCC 626 of Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed in Para 45 as\n\nunder:\n\n \"45. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases\n decided by this Court are clear that in order to convict a person\n under \nSection 306\n IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to\n commit the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act\n which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and\n this act must have been intended to push the deceased into\n such a position that he/she committed suicide.\"\n\n16. In \"Swamy Prahaladdas v. State of M.P.\" 1995 SCC (Cri)\n\n943 of Hon'ble Apex Court, observed in Para 3 as under:\n\n \"3. ...Those words are casual in nature which are often\n employed in the heat of the moment between quarrelling\n people. Nothing serious is expected to follow thereafter. The\n said act does not reflect the requisite 'mens rea' on the\n assumption that these words would be carried out in all\n events.\"\n\n17. \nIn \"\nAmalendu Pal v. State of West Bengal\n\" (2010) 1 SCC\n\n707, of Hon'ble Apex Court, observed in para 12 as under:-\n\n \"12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that\n before holding an accused guilty of an offence under \nSection\n 306\n IPC, the court must scrupulously examine the facts and\n circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence\n adduced before it in order to find out whether the cruelty and\n harassment meted out to the victim had left the victim with no\n other alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to be\n borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide\n there must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to\n the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of\n harassment without there being any positive action proximate\n to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led\n or compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms\n of \nSection 306\n IPC is not sustainable.\"\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (12 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n18. Recently the hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \"\nMahendra\n\nAwase v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\", (2025) 4 SCC 801 while\n\ndealing with the earlier judgments, held as under:-\n\n \"16. In order to bring a case within the purview of \nSection\n 306\n IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the commission\n of the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the\n commission of suicide must have played an active role by an\n act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate the\n commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the\n person charged with the said offence must be proved and\n established by the prosecution before he could be convicted\n under \nSection 306\n IPC.\"\n\n \"19. As has been held hereinabove, to satisfy the requirement\n of instigation the accused by his act or omission or by a\n continued course of conduct should have created such\n circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option\n except to commit suicide. It was also held that a word uttered\n in a fit of anger and emotion without intending the\n consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be\n instigation.\"\n\n \"22. It could certainly not be said that the appellant by his acts\n created circumstances which left the deceased with no other\n option except to commit suicide. Viewed from the armchair of\n the appellant, the exchanges with the deceased, albeit heated,\n are not with intent to leave the deceased with no other option\n but to commit suicide. This is the conclusion we draw taking a\n realistic approach, keeping the context and the situation in\n mind. Strangely, the FIR has also been lodged after a delay of\n two months and twenty days.\"\n\n19. Recently again, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n\"\nAyyub v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.\n\" 2025 INSC 168 in\n\nCriminal Appeal No.461/2025 by way of its judgment dated\n\n07.02.2025 while reiterating the observations made in the case of\n\nMahendra Awase\n (supra) and while considering all other\n\njudgments on the issue, held as under:\n\n \"21. We find none of the ingredients required in law to make out\n a case under \nSection 306\n IPC to be even remotely mentioned in\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (13 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n the charge-sheet or are being borne out from the material on\n record. The utterance attributed to the appellants assuming it to\n be true cannot be said to be of such a nature as to leave the\n deceased Tanu with no other alternative but to put an end to her\n life. The surrounding circumstances, particularly the prior\n lodgment of the FIR by the first appellant against the family of\n Tanu for the death of his son Ziaul Rahman, does indicate an\n element of desperation on the part of the respondent no. 2 to\n somehow implicate the appellants. Reliance of the statements\n recorded under \nSection 161\n Cr.P.C. belatedly on\n 07.11.2022,08.11.2022 and 22.11.2022, only reinforces out\n suspicion viz. one-sided, partial and inimical investigation. Under\n these circumstances, proceeding with the trial against the\n appellants in the charge-sheet as filed will be a gross abuse of\n process.\"\n\n20. Furthermore, this Court in the case of \"\nMangal Singh v.\n\nState of Rajasthan & Anr.\n\": S.B. Criminal Revision Petition\n\nNo.1155/2023, decided on 24.01.2025 had an occasion to deal\n\nwith various judgments dealing with the issue in hand and held\n\nthat even if all the evidence on record including the chargesheet\n\nand statements of witnesses are taken to be correct, if there is no\n\niota of evidence against the petitioner then charges should not be\n\nframed. It was further observed that if it cannot be shown that the\n\ndeceased was left with no alternative but to commit the\n\nunfortunate act of the suicide and the motive to abet suicide is\n\nalso not provided, then the necessary ingredients of proceeding\n\nwith trial under \nSection 306\n IPC is not made out.\n\n21. Based upon the consideration of the provisions as well as the\n\ncase law on the topic in question, it is clear that the words uttered\n\nwhich are casual in nature and often employed in the heat of the\n\nmoment between quarreling people cannot show the existence of\n\nrequisite mens rea for the offences to make out a offence\n\npunishable under \nSection 306\n IPC. It is further clear that in order\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (14 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nto bring home the offence punishable under \nSection 306\n IPC,\n\nspecific abetment, as contemplated under \nSection 107\n IPC, on the\n\npart of the petitioner with an intention to abet the suicide of the\n\nperson concerned, is required. Thus, intention of the accused to\n\naid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide is a\n\nmust for attracting \nSection 306\n IPC and furthermore, the person\n\nconcerned i.e. accused must have been shown to play an active\n\nrole by act of instigation or by doing certain acts to facilitate the\n\ncommission of suicide.\n\n22. Furthermore, a reasonable certainty to impact and the\n\nconsequences of the same must be capable of being spelt out. It\n\nis thus clear that the requisite mens rea to commit the offence\n\nand the knowledge of the consequences of the alleged abetment\n\nare necessary and have to be shown in existence to bring home\n\nthe offence in question. Not only this, the act of the committing\n\nsuicide while seeing no option on the part of the deceased and the\n\nact on the part of the accused being such that he must have\n\nintended to push the deceased into such a position that he/she\n\ncommits suicide is also a necessary ingredient to bring home the\n\noffence in question against the accused person.\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning:-\n\n23. If the record of the present case is considered, a perusal of\n\nthe statement of the deceased, based upon which the FIR was\n\nlodged as well as her dying declaration will reveal that she had\n\nleveled allegations against counsel for the petitioner for asking\n\nfrivolous and certain uncomfortable questions during the cross-\n\nexamination and harassment being meted out by the petitioner as\n\nalso leveling of wrong allegations as a reason to commit suicide.\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (15 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\nShe has further stated that she was under mental tension due to\n\nthe fact that her husband i.e. present petitioner had left her in\n\ndestitute for last twelve years and married somebody else. This\n\ncoupled with the statement given by Dinesh-brother of the\n\ndeceased, Mohan Ram-father of the deceased, Mohani Devi-\n\nmother of the deceased and Jaiprakash-son of the deceased will\n\nreveal that they all in unison had stated that the counsel for the\n\npetitioner had asked certain uncomfortable questions on\n\n05.09.2018 and thereafter certain allegations have been leveled\n\nagainst the petitioner of harassing her without specifying any act\n\nwhich forced the deceased to commit suicide or to make out any\n\ncase of abetment on the part of the petitioner.\n\n24. Rather, on the contrary, the statement of Pawan Rakavat,\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent, reveals that no incident as\n\nsought to be portrayed ever took place on the date in question,\n\nand that there was no altercation between the deceased and the\n\npetitioner whatsoever. The neighbours, Sulochana and Bharat\n\nSodha, had rather stated that the deceased used to stay with her\n\nhusband, Manphool and not with the present petitioner. This\n\ncoupled with the fact that, admittedly as per the statement of the\n\ndeceased herself, the marriage was solemnized between the\n\npetitioner and deceased way back in the year 2004 and since 2006\n\nonwards, they have been living separately, there is no evidence to\n\nshow that the accused had meted out the deceased with cruelty to\n\nbring home the offence punishable under \nSection 498A\n IPC or to\n\ninstigate or abet the deceased to commit suicide to bring home\n\nthe offence punishable under \nSection 306\n IPC.\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (16 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n25. The entire evidence of the prosecution even if admitted as it\n\nis, will reveal that the same has not been able to bring out any act\n\nof abetment on the part of the petitioner to force the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide or with a knowledge that the deceased would\n\ncommit suicide. Simple use of abusive language, even if it is\n\nadmitted to be true, then too, would not bring home the offence\n\npunishable under \nSection 306\n IPC. Not only this, no specific\n\naverment or assertion has been made in the evidence of all the\n\nwitnesses, including the dying declaration or the parcha bayan of\n\nthe deceased, to show what were the words uttered or what was\n\nthe act which instigated the abetment of suicide. Thus, the\n\nprosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt against\n\nthe petitioner and rather it is on record that the deceased was\n\nexperiencing significant emotional distress due to the failed\n\nrelationship and due to the fact that the petitioner was undertaken\n\nsecond marriage and was not living with her, which by itself does\n\nnot constitute commission of an offence punishable under \nSections\n\n498A\n and \n306\n IPC. The existence of strained relationship between\n\nthe parties undermines the theory that the action of the accused-\n\npetitioner was responsible for driving the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide. Learned trial Court has failed to consider this aspect of the\n\nmatter while passing the order impugned.\n\n26. As far as the judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for\n\nrespondent in the case of \"\nState of Madhya Pradesh v.\n\nDeepak\n\" (supra) is concerned, it provides that at the stage of\n\nframing of charge, the Court is not concerned with the proof of\n\nallegation rather it has to focus on the material and form an\n\nopinion, whether there is strong suspicion that the accused has\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (17 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\ncommitted an offence, which if put to trial could prove his guilt.\n\nThe framing of charge is not at a stage at which the final test of\n\nguilt has to be applied. The Court at the stage of framing of\n\ncharge is required to sift and weigh the evidence for a limited\n\npurpose only to satisfy itself that if the facts, emerging from the\n\nmaterial and the documents placed on record, are accepted at\n\ntheir face value, disclose the existence of all the ingredients\n\nconstituting the alleged offence or offences. At the stage of\n\nframing of the charge, the Court has to consider the material with\n\nthe view to find out if there is a ground for presuming that the\n\naccused has committed an offence and not for the purpose of\n\narriving at the conclusion that it is not likely to lead to a\n\nconviction.\n\n27. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has, time and again, dealt with\n\nthe powers of the Court while framing charges and the relevant\n\nconsiderations qua the same. \nIn the case of \nSajjan Kumar v.\n\nCentral Bureau of Investigation\n: 2010 9 SCC 368, the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-\n\n \"Exercise of jurisdiction under \nSections 227\n & \n228\n of Cr.P.C.\n\n 21. On consideration of the authorities about the scope\n of \nSection 227\n and \n228\n of the Code, the following\n principles emerge:-\n\n (i) The Judge while considering the question of\n framing the charges under \nSection 227\n of the\n Cr.P.C. has the undoubted power to sift and weigh\n the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out\n whether or not a prima facie case against the\n accused has been made out. The test to determine\n prima facie case would depend upon the facts of\n each case.\n\n ii) Where the materials placed before the Court\n disclose grave suspicion against the accused which\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (18 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n has not been properly explained, the Court will be\n fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding\n with the trial.\n\n iii) The Court cannot act merely as a Post Office or\n a mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to\n consider the broad probabilities of the case, the\n total effect of the evidence and the documents\n produced before the Court, any basic infirmities\n etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be a\n roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter\n and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a\n trial.\n\n iv) If on the basis of the material on record, the\n Court could form an opinion that the accused\n might have committed offence, it can frame the\n charge, though for conviction the conclusion is\n required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt\n that the accused has committed the offence.\n\n v) At the time of framing of the charges, the\n probative value of the material on record cannot\n be gone into but before framing a charge the Court\n must apply its judicial mind on the material placed\n on record and must be satisfied that the\n commission of offence by the accused was\n possible.\n\n vi) At the stage of \nSections 227\n and \n228\n, the Court\n is required to evaluate the material and documents\n on record with a view to find out if the facts\n emerging therefrom taken at their face value\n discloses the existence of all the ingredients\n constituting the alleged offence. For this limited\n purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot be expected\n even at that initial stage to accept all that the\n prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is\n opposed to common sense or the broad\n probabilities of the case.\n\n vii) If two views are possible and one of them\n gives rise to suspicion only, as distinguished from\n grave suspicion, the trial Judge will be empowered\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (19 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n to discharge the accused and at this stage, he is\n not to see whether the trial will end in conviction\n or acquittal.\n\n 24. At the stage of framing of charge under \nSection 228\n\n of the Cr.P.C. or while considering the discharge petition\n filed under \nSection 227\n, it is not for the Magistrate or a\n Judge concerned to analyse all the materials including\n pros and cons, reliability or acceptability etc. It is at the\n trial, the Judge concerned has to appreciate their\n evidentiary value, credibility or otherwise of the\n statement, veracity of various documents and free to take\n a decision one way or the other.\"\n\n28. \nIn the case of \nM.E. Shivalingamurthy v. Central Bureau\n\nof Investigation\n: 2020 2 SCC 768, the Hon'ble Apex Court,\n\nwhile dealing with the considerations to be undertaken at the\n\nstage of framing of charge, held as under:-\n\n \"LEGAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE IN REGARD TO AN\n APPLICATION SEEKING DISCHARGE\n\n \n17. This is an area covered by a large body of case law. We\n refer to a recent judgment which has referred to the earlier\n decisions, viz., \nP. Vijayan v. State of Kerala\n and discern the\n following principles:-\n\n 17.1 If two views are possible and one of them gives\n rise to suspicion only as distinguished from grave\n suspicion, the Trial Judge would be empowered to\n discharge the accused.\n\n 17.2 The Trial Judge is not a mere Post Office to frame\n the charge at the instance of the prosecution.\n\n 17.3 The Judge has merely to sift the evidence in\n order to find out whether or not there is sufficient\n ground for proceeding. Evidence would consist of the\n statements recorded by the Police or the documents\n produced before the Court.\n\n 17.4 If the evidence, which the Prosecutor proposes to\n adduce to prove the guilt of the accused, even if fully\n accepted before it is challenged in cross-examination\n or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, \"cannot\n show that the accused committed offence, then, there\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (20 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the\n trial\".\n\n 17.5 It is open to the accused to explain away the\n materials giving rise to the grave suspicion.\n\n 17.6 The court has to consider the broad probabilities,\n the total effect of the evidence and the documents\n produced before the court, any basic infirmities\n appearing in the case and so on. This, however, would\n not entitle the court to make a roving inquiry into the\n pros and cons.\n\n 17.7 At the time of framing of the charges, the\n probative value of the material on record cannot be\n gone into, and the material brought on record by the\n prosecution, has to be accepted as true.\n\n 17.8 There must exist some materials for entertaining\n the strong suspicion which can form the basis for\n drawing up a charge and refusing to discharge the\n accused.\n\n 18. The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at the\n stage when the accused seeks to be discharged under \nSection\n 227\n of the Cr.P.C. (See State of J & K v. Sudershan\n Chakkar). The expression, \"the record of the case\", used in\n \nSection 227\n of the Cr.P.C., is to be understood as the documents\n and the articles, if any, produced by the prosecution. The Code\n does not give any right to the accused to produce any document\n at the stage of framing of the charge. \nAt the stage of framing of\n the charge, the submission of the accused is to be confined to the\n material produced by the Police (See \nState of Orissa v.\n Debendra Nath Padhi\n).\"\n\n29. \nIn the case of \nState of Rajasthan v. Ashok Kumar\n\nKashyap\n: 2021 11 SCC 191, the Hon'ble Apex Court, while\n\nagain dealing with the issue, held as under:-\n\n \n\"11.1 In \nP. Vijayan\n (supra), this Court had an occasion to\n consider \nSection 227\n of the Cr.P.C. What is required to be\n considered at the time of framing of the charge and/or\n considering the discharge application has been considered\n elaborately in \nthe said decision\n. It is observed and held that at\n the stage of \nSection 227\n, the Judge has merely to sift the\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (21 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n evidence in order to find out whether or not there is sufficient\n ground for proceeding against the accused. It is observed that\n in other words, the sufficiency of grounds would take within its\n fold the nature of the evidence recorded by the police or the\n documents produced before the Court which ex facie disclose\n that there are suspicious circumstances against the accused so\n as to frame a charge against him. It is further observed that if\n the Judge comes to a conclusion that there is sufficient ground\n to proceed, he will frame a charge under \nSection 228\n Cr.P.C., if\n not, he will discharge the accused. It is further observed that\n while exercising its judicial mind to the facts of the case in\n order to determine whether a case for trial has been made out\n by the prosecution, it is not necessary for the court to enter\n into the pros and cons of the matter or into a weighing and\n balancing of evidence and probabilities which is really the\n function of the court, after the trial starts.\n\n \n11.2 In the recent decision of this Court in the case of \nM.R.\n Hiremath\n (supra), one of us (Justice D.Y. Chandrachud)\n speaking for the Bench has observed and held in paragraph 25\n as under: (SCC p. 526)\n \"25. The High Court ought to have been cognizant\n of the fact that the trial court was dealing with an\n application for discharge under the provisions of\n \nSection 239\n Cr.P.C. The parameters which govern\n the exercise of this jurisdiction have found\n expression in several decisions of this Court. It is a\n settled principle of law that at the stage of\n considering an application for discharge the court\n must proceed on the assumption that the material\n which has been brought on the record by the\n prosecution is true and evaluate the material in order\n to determine whether the facts emerging from the\n material, taken on its face value, disclose the\n existence of the ingredients necessary to constitute\n the offence.\n \nIn \nState of [State of T.N. v. N. Suresh\n Rajan\n], (2014) 11 SCC 709, adverting to the\n earlier decisions on the subject, this Court held: (SCC\n pp. 721-22, para 29)\n \"29. ... At this stage, probative value of the\n materials has to be gone into and the court\n is not expected to go deep into the matter\n and hold that the materials would not\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (22 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n warrant a conviction. In our opinion, what\n needs to be considered is whether there is a\n ground for presuming that the offence has\n been committed and not whether a ground\n for convicting the accused has been made\n out. To put it differently, if the court thinks\n that the accused might have committed the\n offence on the basis of the materials on\n record on its probative value, it can frame\n the charge; though for conviction, the court\n has to come to the conclusion that the\n accused has committed the offence. The law\n does not permit a mini trial at this stage.\"\n\n 13. Having considered the reasoning given by the High\n Court and the grounds which are weighed with the High Court\n while discharging the accused, we are of the opinion that the\n High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in exercise of the\n revisional jurisdiction and has acted beyond the scope of\n \nSection 227\n/\n239\n Cr.P.C. While discharging the accused, the\n High Court has gone into the merits of the case and has\n considered whether on the basis of the material on record, the\n accused is likely to be convicted or not. For the aforesaid, the\n High Court has considered in detail the transcript of the\n conversation between the complainant and the accused which\n exercise at this stage to consider the discharge application\n and/or framing of the charge is not permissible at all.\"\n\n30. Recently, in the case of \nCaptain Manjit Singh Virdi v.\n\nHussain Mohammed Shattaf & Ors.\n: 2023 7 SCC 633, the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court, held as under:-\n\n \"11. The law on issue as to what is to be considered at the\n time of discharge of an accused is well settled. It is a case\n in which the Trial Court had not yet framed the charges.\n Immediately after filing of charge sheet, application for\n discharge was filed. The settled proposition of law is that at\n the stage of hearing on the charges entire evidence\n produced by the prosecution is to be believed. In case no\n offence is made out then only an accused can be\n discharged. Truthfulness, sufficiency and acceptability of\n the material produced can be done only at the stage of\n trial. At the stage of charge, the Court has to satisfy that a\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (23 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n prima facie case is made out against the accused persons.\n Interference of the Court at that stage is required only if\n there is strong reasons to hold that in case the trial is\n allowed to proceed, the same would amount to abuse of\n process of the Court.\"\n\n31. \nIn the case of \nState of Gujarat v. Dilipsinh Kishorsinh\n\nRao\n: 2023 17 SCC 688, the Hon'ble Apex Court, while again\n\ndealing with the issue of relevant considerations at the stage of\n\nframing of charge, held as under:-\n\n \"10. It is settled principle of law that at the stage of\n considering an application for discharge the court must\n proceed on an assumption that the material which has been\n brought on record by the prosecution is true and evaluate\n said material in order to determine whether the facts\n emerging from the material taken on its face value, disclose\n the existence of the ingredients necessary of the offence\n alleged.\"\n\n 12. The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at\n the stage when the accused seeks to be discharged. The\n expression \"the record of the case\" used in \nSection 227\n\n Cr.P.C. is to be understood as the documents and articles, if\n any, produced by the prosecution. The Code does not give\n any right to the accused to produce any document at the\n stage of framing of the charge. The submission of the\n accused is to be confined to the material produced by the\n investigating agency.\n\n \n13. The primary consideration at the stage of framing of\n charge is the test of existence of a prima-facie case, and at\n this stage, the probative value of materials on record need\n not be gone into. This Court by referring to its earlier\n decisions in the \nState of Maharashtra Vs. Som Nath Thapa\n\n (1996) 4 SCC 659 and the State of MP Vs. Mohan Lal\n Soni (2000) 6 SCC 338 has held the nature of evaluation to\n be made by the court at the stage of framing of the charge is\n to test the existence of prima-facie case. It is also held at the\n stage of framing of charge, the court has to form a\n presumptive opinion to the existence of factual ingredients\n constituting the offence alleged and it is not expected to go\n deep into probative value of the material on record and to\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (24 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n check whether the material on record would certainly lead to\n conviction at the conclusion of trial.\n\n 19. The plea or the defence when requiring to be proved\n during course of trial is itself sufficient for framing the\n charge. In the instant case, the learned Trial Judge has\n noticed that explanation provided by the respondent accused\n pertaining to purchase of shop No.7 of Suman City Complex\n of plot No.19, Sector-11 from the loan borrowed and paid by\n the respondent was outside the check period and hence the\n explanation provided by respondent is a mere eye wash. This\n is an issue which has to be thrashed out during the course of\n the trial and at the stage of framing the charge mini trial\n cannot be held. That apart the explanation offered by the\n respondent accused with regard to buying of Maruti Wagon-R\n car, Activa scooter, purchase of house etc., according to the\n prosecution are all the subject matter of trial or it is in the\n nature of defence which will have to be evaluated after trial.\"\n\n32. Thus, considering the mandate of \nSections 227\n and \n228\n of\n\nCr.P.C. as well as the relevant judgments upon the issue in hand,\n\nit is clear that at the stage of framing of charge, the weighing and\n\nsifting of evidence is limited to extend of considering whether if a\n\nprima facie case is made out against the accused-petitioner or\n\nnot. It is further clear that if based upon the material available on\n\nrecord, case of grave suspicion is made out against the petitioner-\n\naccused, then the Court has no other option but to frame charges\n\nand to proceed with the trial. Rather, even if, Court comes to form\n\nan opinion that the accused-petitioner might have committed the\n\noffence, it has to proceed with the trial after framing charges.\n\n33. At the same time, it is also clear that the Court cannot act as\n\na mouth piece of the prosecution or as a mere post office and it\n\nhas to apply its judicial mind to the material placed on record\n\nbefore it. It is further clear that, if after considering the entire\n\nmaterial adduced by the prosecution, to prove the guilt of the\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (25 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\npetitioner-accused, even if, the same is fully accepted at face\n\nvalue, without being challenged and cross-examined or rebutted\n\nby defence, fails to establish the necessary ingredients of the\n\noffence or to establish that the petitioner-accused has committed\n\nthe offence, then the trial Court ought to discharge the petitioner-\n\naccused at the stage of framing of charge. The law thus requires\n\nthe rights of both the parties to be taken care of and when the\n\nprosecution case, even if, accepted to be true on its face value,\n\ndoes not make out the necessary ingredients of the offence in\n\nquestion then the trial Court cannot proceed with and the accused\n\ncannot be forced to undergo the trial in such a situation. The same\n\nwould rather be abuse of process of law and cause grave injustice\n\nto the accused-petitioner.\n\n34. It is also trite that, as far as revisional power is concerned,\n\nprior to reversing any finding, the Court is required to satisfy itself\n\nas to the legality and correctness of the proceedings or the order\n\nmade in the case. The object of the provision is to set right a\n\npatent defect or an error of jurisdiction or law, and the revisional\n\nCourt should not unduly interfere or meticulously examine the\n\nwitnesses on record to form an opinion whether the end result\n\nwould be conviction or not. It is in order to prevent patent\n\nmiscarriage of justice or correcting a grave error that the\n\nrevisional power should be exercised.\n\n35. However, the law is also well settled based upon the\n\njudgments, reference to which has been made (supra) that even if\n\nthe evidence available on record is admitted as it is, then too, if\n\nthe ingredients of the offence are not made out then, the order\n\nframing charge cannot be sustained. In the present case, even if\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JD:36933] (26 of 26) [CRLR-1508/2023]\n\n the evidence available on record is accepted as it is, then too, it\n\n cannot connect the petitioner with the crime in question. Thus,\n\n permitting the prosecution to proceed with the trial in the present\n\n case would essentially cause patent miscarriage of justice and a\n\n grave error and would essentially be an abuse of process of Court\n\n leading to injustice. Thus, the order impugned dated 08.08.2023\n\n passed by the learned Trial Court framing charges against the\n\n petitioner under \nSections 498A\n and \n306\n IPC cannot be sustained\n\n and deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\n 36. Accordingly, the revision petition is allowed and while\n\n quashing the impugned order dated 08.08.2023 passed by the\n\n learned Additional Sessions Judge (Women Atrocity Cases),\n\n Jodhpur Metropolitan in Session Case No.55/2022 (State v.\n\n Haribhajan Ram), the petitioner is discharged from the said\n\n offences. If the petitioner is on bail, he need not surrender the bail\n\n bonds.\n\n (SANDEEP SHAH),J\n 123-Love/-\n\n (Downloaded on 28/08/2025 at 09:52:14 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
