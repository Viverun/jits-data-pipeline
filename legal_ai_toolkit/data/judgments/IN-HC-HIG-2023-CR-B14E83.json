District & Sessions Judge,\n\nBengaluru Rural District, sitting at Anekal in\n\nS.C.No.53/2010 for offences punishable under\nSections 302\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nand 201 of the\nIPC\n.

Heard the learned counsel Shri Prasanna Kumar P\n\nfor the appellants / accused and the learned HCGP Shri\n\nKrishna Kumar K.K. for the respondent / State. Perused the\n\nimpugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nrendered by the Trial Court in S.C.No.53/2010 consisting of\n\nthe evidence of PW-1 to PW-22, the documents at Exhibits\n\nP1 to P27 on behalf of the prosecution, the documents at\n\nExhibits D1 to D4 on behalf of the accused and the material\n\nobjects marked at MO-1 to MO-15.\n\n4. The factual matrix of this appeal is as under:\n\nIt transpires from the case of the prosecution that\n\nAccused No.1 / Mallikarjuna @ Balaji @ Chinna @ Arjun had\n\nborrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs only)\n\nfrom the deceased Sridhar. It is said that the deceased\n\nSridhar was frequently demanding Accused No.1 to repay\n\nthe said borrowed amount. In that regard, an enmity had\n\ndeveloped in between the deceased and accused persons.\n\nTherefore, it is said that Accused No.1 had hatched a\n\ncriminal conspiracy with Accused Nos.2 to 7 to commit the\n\nmurder of the said Sridhar. Accordingly, as on 10.02.2010\n\nin between 11.58 a.m. and 1.00 p.m., the accused persons\n\nhad committed the murder of the deceased Sridhar and in\n\norder to screen themselves from legal punishment, tried to\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nhave burnt the dead body of Sridhar. However, the body\n\nremained half burnt. In pursuance of the act of the accused,\n\non the filing of a complaint by the complainant namely CW-2\n\ncited as a witness in the charge-sheet as per Exhibit P8,\n\ncriminal law was set into motion by recording an FIR as per\n\nExhibit P18. But another complaint is also got marked at\n\nExhibit P17 and one more FIR was also said to be recorded\n\nas per Exhibit P21. Subsequent to recording the FIR and\n\nsetting the criminal law into motion, the Investigating Officer\n\nhas taken up the case for investigation and during\n\ninvestigation, he recorded the voluntary statement of\n\nAccused No.1 as per Exhibit P22 and voluntary statement of\n\nAccused No.4 as per Exhibit P23, voluntary statement of\n\nAccused No.3 as per Exhibit P24, voluntary statement of\n\nAccused Nos.5, 6 and 7 as per Exhibit P25, as per Exhibit\n\nP26 and as per Exhibit P27 and based upon their voluntary\n\nstatements, the Investigating Officer had proceeded with the\n\ninvestigation of the case by conducting several mahazars\n\nsuch as Exhibits P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P9, P11, P12, P13,\n\nP14 and P19, all of them being panchanamas. These are the\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nmahazars said to have been drawn by the Investigating\n\nOfficer in the presence of panch witnesses who were secured\n\nsuch as PW-1, PW-2, PW-4, PW-5, PW-12, PW-3, PW-6, PW-\n\n14, PW-7, PW-13, PW-11, PW-15, PW-22 and PW-21. They\n\nare the witnesses secured by the Investigating Officer and in\n\ntheir presence the aforesaid several panchanamas have been\n\ndrawn by the Investigating Officer and so also the Statement\n\nof witnesses were recorded and DNA report was secured at\n\nExhibit P15 and so also during the course of investigation,\n\nthey have seized MO-1 to MO-15 wherein MO-9, MO-10 and\n\nMO-11 being gold ring, gold chain and MO-1 mobile and\n\nother articles which were seized also were subjected in P.F.\n\nThe entire investigation was completed and the Investigating\n\nOfficer laid the charge-sheet against Accused Nos.1 to 7\n\nbefore the Committal Court for offences under\nSection 302\n\nand\nSection 201\nof the IPC. Subsequently, the Committal\n\nCourt had passed an order as contemplated under\nSection\nof the Cr.P.C. and committed the case to the Court of\n\nSessions for trial.\n\n-8-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n5. Subsequent to committing the case to the Court of\n\nSessions, Accused Nos.1 to 7 were secured to face trial.\n\nAccordingly, in S.C.No.53/2010, the Trial Court heard the\n\narguments of the learned Public Prosecutor and so also\n\ndefence counsel on framing of charge. On prima facie\n\nmaterial being found against each one of the accused Nos.1\n\nto 7 respectively, charges were framed against Accused\n\nNos.1 to 7 for the offences reflected in the FIR. The charges\n\nwere read over to the accused persons in a language known\n\nto them and they have declined the charges made against\n\nthem. Accordingly, the plea of the accused was recorded\n\nseparately but the accused claimed to be tried.\n\n6. Subsequently, the prosecution, in order to prove the\n\nguilt against the accused, examined in all PW-1 to PW-22\n\nand got marked several documents at Exhibits P1 to P27\n\nand got marked MO-1 to MO-15 on the part of the\n\nprosecution. Exhibits D1 to D3 are the photos and Exhibit\n\nD4 is the receipt issued by the petrol bunk and these\n\ndocuments have been got marked on the part of the defence\n\nside.\n\n-9-\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n7. Subsequent to closure of the evidence on the part of\n\nthe prosecution, Accused Nos.1 to 7 have answered to the\n\nincriminating statements recorded by the Trial Court as\n\ncontemplated under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C. whereby the\n\naccused have declined the incriminating evidence appearing\n\nagainst them and accordingly it was recorded separately.\n\nSubsequent to recording the incriminating statements of the\n\naccused, the Trial Court had called upon the accused to\n\nenter into defence evidence if any. But the accused did not\n\nchoose to let any defence evidence. Accordingly, it was\n\nrecorded.\n\n8. Subsequent to closure of the evidence on the part of\n\nthe prosecution as well as on the part of the defence, in\n\nterms of the relevant provisions of the\nCr.P.C\n., the Trial\n\nCourt had heard the arguments advanced by the Public\n\nProsecutor and also the counter arguments advanced by the\n\ndefence counsel for the accused, and on an examination of\n\nthe evidence of the witnesses inclusive of the exhibited\n\ndocuments, rendered a conviction judgment against the\n\naccused for the offences under\nSection 302\nand\nSection 201\n\n- 10 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nIPC\n. It is this judgment which is under challenge in this\n\nappeal by urging various grounds.\n\n9. Learned counsel Shri P. Prasanna Kumar for the\n\nappellants / Accused Nos.1 to 7 contends that the impugned\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the\n\nIII Addl. District and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural\n\nDistrict, sitting at Anekal is contrary to law, facts and\n\nevidence available on record, and as such the same is liable\n\nto be set-aside.\n\n10. PW-8 / Smt. Shubha being the wife of the deceased\n\nSridhar, is the author of the missing complaint at Exhibit P7\n\nand she has identified the burnt dead body of her husband\n\nSridhar and also identified the belongings of the deceased.\n\nBut she has not mentioned in her complaint at Exhibit P7\n\nabout Accused No.1 or Accused No.2 coming to their house\n\nto borrow money from her husband. There is no agreement\n\nor anything in writing to show that Accused No.1 had\n\nborrowed Rs.8,00,000/- from the deceased Sridhar. Hence,\n\nher evidence to the effect that accused had gone to her\n\n- 11 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nhouse and had borrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- from her\n\nhusband Sridhar, has no basis at all. This PW-8 / Shubha\n\nhas been subjected to cross-examination and her evidence\n\nhas been dismantled and does not inspire confidence in the\n\nmind of the Court to arrive at a conclusion that the\n\nprosecution has proved the guilt against the accused. PW-\n\n10 / Murugeshan, PW-11 / Selvaraj, PW-12 / Joraram\n\nChoudri, PW-13 / W.C. Chandrashekar are witnesses who\n\nhave been subjected to examination on the part of the\n\nprosecution. But nothing worthwhile has been elicited in\n\ntheir chief examination to believe the theory put forth by the\n\nprosecution that Accused Nos.1 and 2 along with the other\n\naccused have committed the murder of Sridhar. PW-16 /\n\nMahesh Kumar who is an official witness during\n\ninvestigation, it was found that Accused Nos.1 and 2 were\n\nmissing and on enquiring, it was found that they were\n\nresiding in Mumbai. Subsequently they were apprehended\n\nat Mumbai on 27.02.2010. Further on 01.03.2010, a team\n\nof police officials went to Chennai in order to search the\n\nother accused and apprehended them and produced before\n\n- 12 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nthe Investigating Officer. Though the prosecution has let in\n\nseveral witnesses to prove the guilt of the accused, but has\n\nnot been able to establish the guilt against the accused by\n\nfacilitating cogent, consistent, corroborative and so also\n\nacceptable evidence that the accused have committed the\n\nmurder of the deceased Sridhar. But the investigation\n\nreveals that Accused Nos.1 and 2 have committed the\n\nmurder of the deceased and burnt the dead body of the\n\ndeceased Sridhar. MO-7 / Wrist watch belonging to\n\ndeceased Sridhar came to be seized near Chandapura\n\nRailway Bridge by drawing a mahazar at Exhibit P6. The\n\nsaid watch was identified through his wife PW-8 / Shubha.\n\nBut the criminal law was set into motion on receipt of a\n\ncomplaint by the said Shubha. But her evidence is not\n\ncorroborated with any other independent witnesses in order\n\nto prove the guilt against the accused to secure conviction\n\nfor offences under\nSection 302\nand\nSection 201\nof the IPC.\n\n11. Lastly, the learned counsel for the accused\n\nvehemently contended that the Trial Court has misdirected\n\nthe evidence of the prosecution witnesses and also\n\n- 13 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nmisinterpreted the evidence let in by the prosecution which\n\nis contrary to law and facts and also evidence available on\n\nrecord. It is contended that the reasons assigned by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge in impugned judgment are\n\nerroneous resulting in a substantial miscarriage of justice to\n\nthe appellants. Further, the learned Sessions Judge has\n\nfailed to take note of the fact that PW-21 / B.S. Manjunath\n\nduring his cross examination, has deposed that they went to\n\nMumbai to apprehend Accused Nos.1 and 2 via private\n\nvehicle whereas PW-14 / Nataraj, S/o. Narayanaswamy has\n\ndeposed that they went through flight. The said\n\ninconsistency is a material defect in the case of the\n\nprosecution and the same has not at all been considered by\n\nthe learned Sessions Judge. It is further contended that PW-\n\n17 / Shri Lakshmi Balasubramaniam has admitted that if\n\nthere are identical twins, then the DNA profile will be the\n\nsame. Such being the case, the prosecution has failed to\n\nconclusively establish the identity of the accused persons.\n\nThese facts have not at all been considered by the learned\n\n- 14 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nSessions Judge. Hence it is contended that as such the\n\nappellants are entitled for an order of acquittal.\n\n12. It is further contended that the learned Sessions\n\nJudge has miserably failed to take note of the fact that the\n\nprosecution has failed to establish the alleged enmity\n\nbetween the deceased and the accused persons. As such\n\nthere was no motive for the accused persons to commit the\n\nmurder of the deceased. Further, the prosecution has not\n\nrecovered any incriminating article at the instance of the\n\nappellants. When such being the case, the impugned\n\njudgment and order of conviction is unsustainable as\n\nagainst these appellants are concerned.\n\n13. DNA analysis of the blood sample of the parents of\n\nthe deceased proved that the dead body was that of the\n\ndeceased Sridhar. It is contended that if there are identical\n\ntwins, then the DNA profile will be the same. Such being the\n\ncase, the Trial Court has failed to establish the identity of\n\nthe deceased person. On this premise also learned counsel\n\nseeks for intervention.\n\n- 15 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n14. It is further contended that the mahazar witnesses\n\ncited by the prosecution, have not completely supported the\n\ncase of the prosecution and that there are material\n\ndiscrepancies even in their evidence which go to the very\n\nroot of the case of the prosecution and as such the recovery\n\nof the article at the instance of the appellants would have no\n\nlegs to stand. Hence the impugned judgment and order of\n\nconviction and sentence is unsustainable and the same is\n\nliable to be set-aside. Hence, it is contended that if the\n\njudgment of the learned Sessions judge is not set aside in\n\nthis appeal, it would result in a substantial miscarriage of\n\njustice. On these grounds, the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants seeks to allow the present appeal and to thereby\n\nset aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\ndated 27.03.2017 rendered by the III Addl. District &\n\nSessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural District, Sitting at Anekal\n\nin S.C.No.53/2010 and consequently acquit the appellants\n\nof the alleged offences.\n\n15. On the contrary, learned HCGP Shri Krishna\n\nKumar K.K. for the respondent / State contends that the\n\n- 16 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nentire evidence of the prosecution is circumstantial in\n\nnature and chain of circumstances would bring home the\n\nguilt of the accused as established by the prosecution by\n\nfacilitating the evidence of PW-8 / Subha and PW-16 /\n\nMahesh Kumar and PW-21 / B.S. Manjunath being official\n\nwitnesses.\n\n16. Learned HCGP contends that PW-8 / Smt.\n\nShubha, being the wife of the deceased Sridhar has stated in\n\nher evidence that the first accused namely Mallikarjuna @\n\nBalaji @ Chinna @ Arjun had visited her house to sort out\n\nsome financial dealings of Accused Nos.1 and 2 with the\n\ndeceased Sridhar. She has specifically stated in her\n\nevidence that Accused Nos.1 and 2 are said to have visited\n\nthe house of the deceased and demanded for money\n\nfrequently. Therefore, Accused No.2 used to take that\n\nmoney by coming to their house. Accused Nos.1 and 2 had\n\nborrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- for their financial\n\nbusiness. But in fact she has referred about some financial\n\ndealings of her husband namely Sridhar with the accused in\n\nExhibit P7 of the missing complaint made by her. In view of\n\n- 17 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nexamining her after a lapse of 4 years of the occurrence of\n\nthe incident, some discrepancies have arisen in the evidence\n\nof PW-8. As noticed by the Trial Court, the said\n\ndiscrepancies would not cut the root of the prosecution\n\ntheory relating to the incident of the accused having\n\ncommitted the murder of the deceased Sridhar and\n\nconcealing his dead body in order to screen themselves from\n\nlegal punishment. PW-8 has been subjected to cross-\n\nexamination at length but in her cross-examination, the\n\ndefence counsel did not elicit any acceptable evidence as\n\nregards the incident narrated in her missing complaint and\n\ndisbelieved the theory of the prosecution. But Exhibit D\n\nseries at Exhibits D1 to D4 have been got marked on the\n\ndefence side as relevant portion. The same was confronted\n\nto the Investigating Officer who is examined as PW-21. This\n\nPW-8 has been subjected to thorough cross-examination\n\nand she has specifically stated that on 09.02.2010 her\n\nhusband Sridhar made a phone call to the first accused\n\nBalaji and demanded him to repay the borrowed amount.\n\nAs on 10.02.2010, deceased Sridhar went in a car bearing\n\n- 18 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nNo.KA-05/1665 stating that he would meet the first accused\n\n/ Mallikarjuna @ Balaji and get back the borrowed money\n\nfrom him. But on the aforesaid date, at around 12.40 p.m.,\n\ncalls made to his mobile were not received by her husband.\n\nBut the said calls were thereafter diverted to her mobile at\n\naround 3.00 p.m. Though she received the telephone call,\n\nnobody responded to her call on the either side. She had\n\ninformed the said fact to the friends of her husband Sridhar.\n\nThe aforesaid evidence that the deceased Sridhar had gone\n\non that day in the morning and thereafter his whereabouts\n\ncould not be known also, remained unchallenged even\n\nthough she has stood for cross-examination. Her evidence\n\nfinds corroborated with the evidence of PW-21 /\n\nInvestigating Officer in respect of the contents at Exhibit P7\n\nof the missing complaint.\n\n17. PW-21 / I.O. has got identified the watch and\n\nclothes of the deceased Sridhar. PW-22 / A. Yelagaiah has\n\nspecifically stated in his evidence that the accused led the\n\npolice to the place where chilly powder was thrown and drew\n\nthe mahazar as per Exhibit P13. PW-15 / R.C. Chandra\n\n- 19 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nthough has subscribed his signature to Exhibit P13, he has\n\nnot supported the case of the prosecution. But the motive\n\nfactor for the incident relating to the accused persons being\n\nthe perpetrator and so also they having committed the\n\nmurder of Sridhar as there was an enmity developed\n\nbetween the accused and the deceased, is proved.\n\n18. He has also taken us through the evidence of the\n\nprosecution witnesses and also the charges lugged against\n\nthe accused and more importantly Accused No.1 with the\n\nassistance of Accused No.2 having borrowed a sum of\n\nRs.8,00,000/- from the deceased Sridhar and when the\n\ndeceased Sridhar started demanding him to repay the\n\nborrowed amount, an animosity developed between the\n\naccused and the deceased. It is contended by the learned\n\nHCGP that on information given by PW-10 / Murugeshan to\n\nthe V.A.O about a burnt dead body lying near the water\n\nchannel, the said V.A.O. Sri. Abdul had filed a complaint as\n\nper Exhibit P8. The said dead body was decomposed and\n\nunidentified. Thereafter the police visited the spot and drew\n\na mahazar as per Exhibit P9 and seized the blood stained\n\n- 20 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nmud, ordinary mud and water cans. Thereafter, on\n\n15.02.2010 the car of the missing person was traced at\n\nChennai. Hence, PW-21 / I.O. went to Chennai and seized\n\nthe said car by drawing a mahazar as per Exhibit P19.\n\nThereafter, the wife of the deceased namely PW-8 / Smt.\n\nShubha got released the said car by producing the relevant\n\ndocuments. Thereafter, PW-21 / I.O. received information\n\nthat a burnt dead body of an unidentified person was found\n\nat Pallikonda Village of Tamil Nadu, which body was kept in\n\nGovernment Hospital, Vellore. Hence, relatives of missing\n\nperson went along with the I.O. and identified the said dead\n\nbody as the one of the deceased Sri. Sridhar. The wife of the\n\ndeceased namely PW-8 / Shubha had also identified the\n\ndead body to be that of her husband. Further, the Doctors\n\nhad collected the blood samples of the parents of the\n\ndeceased Sri Sridhar in order to conduct DNA analysis. The\n\nDNA analysis also proved that the dead body was of the\n\ndeceased Sridhar. Further, gold chain of the deceased at\n\nMO-11 and two gold rings marked as MO-9 and MO-10 /\n\nmotor cycle were recovered by drawing a panchanama at\n\n- 21 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nExhibit P3. It is no doubt true that based on the missing\n\ncomplaint made by PW-8 / Shubha, Accused Nos.1 and 2\n\nalong with other accused were apprehended by the police\n\nand accused were put on trial relating to offences under\n\nSections 302\nand\nof the IPC. A cursory glance of the\n\nentire evidence on the part of the prosecution reveals that\n\nthe prosecution has successfully proved the guilt against the\n\naccused. Therefore, the Trial Court has rightly come to the\n\nconclusion and rendered a conviction judgment for offences\n\npunishable under\nSection 302\nand\nSection 201\nof the IPC.\n\nTherefore in this appeal, it does not arise to call for any\n\ninterference of the impugned judgment of conviction and\n\nsentence since the accused have committed the murder of\n\nthe deceased Sridhar and have burnt his dead body and also\n\nhave caused disappearance of evidence in order to screen\n\nthemselves from legal punishment. Therefore, it does not\n\narise to call for interference the judgment of conviction and\n\norder of sentence even on re-appreciation of the same.\n\nConsequently, learned HCGP seeks to dismiss this appeal as\n\nbeing devoid of any merits.\n\n- 22 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n19. In the context of contentions made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants / accused and so also the counter\n\narguments advanced by the learned HCGP Shri Krishna\n\nKumar K.K., in this matter, it requires to examine certain\n\nimportant evidence on the part of the prosecution. In this\n\nregard, it is required to establish strong circumstances,\n\ncircumstantial evidence, motive factor which bears an\n\nimportant significance. Motive always locks-up in the mind\n\nof the accused and sometime it is difficult to unlock. People\n\ndo not act wholly without motive. The failure to discover the\n\nmotive of an offence does not signify its non-existence.\n\n20. But the law regarding circumstantial evidence is\n\nwell-settled. When a case rests upon the circumstantial\n\nevidence, such evidence must satisfy three tests:\n\ni) the circumstance from which an inference of guilt\n\nsought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly\n\nestablished;\n\nii) those circumstances should be of definite tendency\n\nunerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;\n\n- 23 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\niii) circumstances taken cumulatively should form the\n\nchain complete that there is no escape from the conclusion\n\nthat within all human probability the crime was committed\n\nby the accused and none else. The circumstantial evidence\n\nin order to sustain conviction must be complete and\n\nincapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of\n\nthe guilt of the accused. The circumstantial evidence should\n\nnot only be consistent with guilt of the accused but should\n\nbe inconsistent with his innocence. Suspicion, however\n\ngrave it may be, cannot take the place of proof.\n\n21. Mere identification of the dead body of the\n\ndeceased by his relatives including his wife in the absence of\n\nany other evidence connecting the accused persons with the\n\nmurder is not enough to fasten the guilt upon the accused,\n\nalthough there may be suspicion against the accused\n\npersons. But suspicion, however strong it may be cannot be\n\nvalid substitute for proof. The chain of circumstances which\n\nhas been established on the basis of reliable evidence the\n\ncredibility of which has not in any manner been impeached\n\nby cross-examination and which evidence gets support from\n\n- 24 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nDNA analysis that the death occurred on the account of the\n\ninjuries inflicted upon the deceased. But in the instant\n\ncase, the death occurred due to enmity in between Accused\n\nNos.1 and 2 and the deceased with the assistance of the\n\nremaining accused. There is an allegation that the accused\n\npersons committed the murder of the deceased. However,\n\nexcept the say of PW-8 / Shubha that accused persons had\n\nborrowed money from her husband Sridhar and when\n\nSridhar persistently started demanding repayment of the\n\nsaid money from the accused, the accused had hatched a\n\ncriminal conspiracy and committed the murder of Sridhar,\n\nthere is no other evidence to establish that the accused\n\npersons had committed the murder of the deceased and\n\nburnt his dead body. Further, there is no written evidence\n\nto show that deceased Sridhar had lent a sum of\n\nRs.8,00,000/- to Accused No.1. The allegations made by\n\nPW-8 against the accused persons have not been proved by\n\nthe prosecution by producing convincing evidence as regards\n\nthe same. The entire case of the prosecution rests on\n\ncircumstantial evidence. Further, as regards the last seen\n\n- 25 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\ntheory, the foundation of this theory lies on the principle of\n\nprobability, cause, and connection as no fact takes place in\n\nisolation. Basically, it means that if an event takes place\n\nthen other events also take place which are the probable\n\nconsequences of a major event or is related to it either\n\nretrospectively or prospectively. These inferences or\n\npresumptions are drawn logically according to how a\n\nreasonably prudent man will connect the dots in the\n\nparticular scenario. Even the presumption of fact is taken\n\nunder\nSection 114\nof the Indian Evidence Act under which\n\nthe Court can presume that certain facts exist if some other\n\nfacts are proved to be existing in the cases of natural events,\n\nhuman conduct, and public and private business. For\n\ninstance, if A was the last person seen with B just before his\n\nmurder then it can be presumed that A murdered B under\n\nthis theory because A had adequate opportunity to commit\n\nthe crime. But this presumption is not considered as\n\nconclusive proof for the guilt of the person and these\n\npresumptions are rebuttable by the accused. It only shifts\n\nthe onus on the person to prove that he is innocent which is\n\n- 26 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nan exception in the criminal law as the burden of proving\n\nthe guilt of the accused is on prosecution. Thus, the fact of\n\nlast seen should also be supported by other factors in such\n\na way that the circumstances are unerringly determinative\n\nin nature and conclusively prove the guilt of the person. The\n\ncourt needs to be on guard while deciding upon these kinds\n\nof matters.\n\n22.\nIn the judgment of\nBABU VS. STATE OF KERALA\n\n((2010) 9 SCC 189)) relating to doctrine of innocence, it is\n\nheld that criminal trial - proof - burden and onus of proof -\n\nreversal of burden of proof - when permissible -\n\npresumptions - presumption of innocence - Constitution of\n\nIndia -\nArticles 21\nand\n14.\nIt is held \"every accused is\n\npresumed to be innocent unless the guilt is proved. The\n\npresumption of innocence is a human right. However,\n\nsubject to the statutory exceptions, the said principle forms\n\nthe basis of criminal jurisprudence. For this purpose, the\n\nnature of the offence, its seriousness and gravity thereof has\n\nto be taken into consideration. The courts must be on guard\n\nto see that merely on the application of the presumption, the\n\n- 27 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nsame may not lead to any injustice of mistaken conviction.\"\n\nIn the same reliance it is also held that in a criminal trial -\n\ncircumstantial evidence - generally - burden of proof - in\n\ncase of circumstantial evidence burden on prosecution is\n\nalways greater. Further, in respect of criminal trial -\n\ncircumstantial evidence - motive - relevance - absence of\n\nmotive in a case depending on circumstantial evidence is a\n\nfactor that weighs in favour of accused - in a case of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, motive must be established at least\n\nto a certain extent.\n\n23. Whereas in the case of\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda\n\nvs. State of Maharashtra\n(1984) 4 SCC 116 it is relevant to\n\nrefer to para 163 which reads as under:\n\n\"We then pass on to another important point which\nseems to have been completely missed by the High Court. It\nis well settled that where on the evidence two possibilities\nare available or open, one which goes in favour of the\nprosecution and the other which benefits an accused, the\naccused is undoubtedly entitled to the benefit of doubt.\nIn\n\nKali Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh\n,this Court made the\nfollowing observations:\n\n- 28 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nAnother golden thread which runs through the web of the\nadministration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views\nare possible on the evidence adduced in the case one\npointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his\ninnocence, the view which is favourable to the accused\nshould be adopted. This principle has a special relevance in\ncases where in the guilt of the accused is sought to be\nestablished by circumstantial evidence.\"\n\n24. In the instant case, it is relevant to refer to the\n\njudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ram\n\nNiwas vs. State of Haryana (Criminal Appeal No.25 of\n\n2012) wherein it is held as under:\n\n\"The prosecution case rests on circumstantial\nevidence. The law with regard to conviction on the\nbasis of circumstantial evidence has very well been\ncrystalized in the judgment of this Court in the case of\n\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra\n,\nwherein this Court held thus:\n\n\"152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the\nHigh Court we would like to cite a few decisions on the\nnature, character and essential proof required in a\ncriminal case which rests on circumstantial evidence\nalone. The most fundamental and basic decision of this\nCourt is\nHanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n[AIR\n\n- 29 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n1952 SC 343]. This case has been uniformly followed\nand applied by this Court in a large number of later\ndecisions up-to-date, for instance, the cases of Tufail\n(Alias) Simmi v. State of Uttar Pradesh [(1969) 3 SCC\n198] and Ramgopal v. State of Maharashtra [(1972) 4\nSCC 625]. It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J.\n\nhas laid down in\nHanumant\ncase [AIR 1952 SC 343] :\n\n\"It is well to remember that in cases where the\nevidence is of a circumstantial nature, the\ncircumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be\ndrawn should in the first instance be fully established,\nand all the facts so established should be consistent\nonly with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.\nAgain, the circum stances should be of a conclusive\nnature and tendency and they should be such as to\nexclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be\nproved. In other words, there must be a chain of\nevidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable\nground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of\nthe accused and it must be such as to show that within\nall human probability the act must have been done by\nthe accused.\"\n\n153. A close analysis of this decision would show\nthat the following conditions must be fulfilled before a\n\n- 30 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\ncase against an accused can be said to be fully\nestablished:\n\n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of\nguilt is to be drawn should be fully established.\n\nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that\nthe circumstances concerned \"must or should\" and not\n\"may be\" established. There is not only a grammatical\nbut a legal distinction between \"may be proved\" and\n\"must be or should be proved\" as was held by this\nCourt in\nShivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra\n[(1973) 2\nSCC 793] where the observations were made :\n\n\"Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused\nmust be and not merely may be guilty before a court\ncan convict and the mental distance between 'may be'\nand 'must be' is long and divides vague conjectures\nfrom sure conclusions.\"\n\n(2) the facts so established should be consistent only\nwith the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to\nsay, they should not be explainable on any other\nhypothesis except that the accused is guilty,\n\n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive\nnature and tendency,\n\n- 31 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis\nexcept the one to be proved, and\n\n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as\nnot to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must\nshow that in all human probability the act must have\nbeen done by the accused.\n\n154. These five golden principles, if we may say so,\nconstitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based\non circumstantial evidence.\"\n\n19. This Court has held that there has to be a chain\nof evidence so complete so as not to leave any\nreasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the\ninnocence of the accused and must show that in all\nhuman probability the act must have been done by the\naccused. It has been held that the circumstances should\nbe of a conclusive nature and tendency. This Court has\nheld that the circumstances should exclude every\npossible hypothesis except the one to be proved. It has\nbeen held that the accused 'must be' and not merely\n'may be' guilty before a Court can convict.\n\n20. It is settled law that the suspicion, however\nstrong it may be, cannot take the place of proof beyond\nreasonable doubt. An accused cannot be convicted on\n\n- 32 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nthe ground of suspicion, no matter how strong it is. An\naccused is presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n25. PW-21 / I.O. as on 27.02.2010 after collecting the\n\nmobile phones and doubts expressed by the informants, had\n\narrested Accused Nos.1 and 2 at Mumbai. PW-16 / Mahesh\n\nKumar had also deposed that he accompanied PW-21 while\n\narresting Accused Nos.1 and 2 at Mumbai. Though PW-21\n\nduring his cross-examination has deposed that they went to\n\nMumbai by a private vehicle, PW-16 has deposed that they\n\nwent by Flight. The inconsistency in both of their\n\nstatements looms large in spite of the fact that they had\n\ngone to Mumbai prior to 4 years. Further, the statements\n\nmade by PW-8 / Shubha have not been proved by the\n\nprosecution by producing convincing evidence.\n\n26. In the present case, we find that the prosecution\n\nhas failed to establish the chain of events in order to\n\nconclusively prove the guilt of the accused persons. Though\n\nthe prosecution has let in several witnesses to prove the\n\nguilt of the accused, but has not been able to establish the\n\n- 33 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nguilt against the accused by facilitating cogent, consistent,\n\ncorroborative and so also acceptable evidence that the\n\naccused have committed the murder of the deceased\n\nSridhar.\n\n27.\nIn the case of\nNAVANEETHAKRISHNAN V. THE\n\nSTATE BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE\n(AIR 2018 SC 2027),\n\nthe mobile phones along with other materials were\n\ndiscovered at the instance of the information given by the\n\naccused. Those recoveries did not have any connection with\n\nthe crime committed and the fact of which the discoveries\n\nwere made, could not be proved to be a relevant one. The\n\nApex Court observed that in the absence of any connecting\n\nlink between the crime and the things recovered, the\n\nrecovery on the behest of accused will not have any material\n\nbearing on the facts of the case. The Court held that no\n\nevidence has been adduced or produced by the prosecution\n\nas to how these objects have a bearing on the case. It further\n\nheld that the said statements are inadmissible in spite of the\n\nmandate contained in\nSection 27\nof the Indian Evidence Act\n\n- 34 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nfor the simple reason that it cannot be stated to have\n\nresulted in the discovery of some new fact. The material\n\nobjects which the police is claimed to have recovered from\n\nthe accused may well have been planted by the police.\n\n28.\nIn the case of\nBIPIN KUMAR MONDAL vs. STATE\n\nOF WEST BENGAL\n(AIR 2010 SC 368), it is held that,\n\nmotive is a thing which is primarily known to the accused\n\nhimself and it may not be possible for the prosecution to\n\nexplain what actually prompted or excited him to commit a\n\nparticular crime.\n\n29.\nIn the case of\nMUNISH MUBAR vs. STATE OF\n\nHARYANA\n(AIR 2013 SC 912), it is held that, in a case of\n\ncircumstantial evidence, the evidence indicating the guilt of\n\nthe accused becomes untrustworthy and unreliable, because\n\nmost often it is only the perpetrator of the crime alone, who\n\nhas knowledge of the circumstances that prompted him to\n\nadopt a certain course of action, leading to the commission\n\nof the crime. Therefore, if the evidence on record suggest\n\n- 35 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nsufficient/necessary motive to commit a crime, it may be\n\nconceived that the accused has committed the same.\n\n30. It is no doubt true that criminal law was set into\n\nmotion on receipt of a complaint by PW-8 / Shubha. But\n\nher evidence is not corroborated with any other independent\n\nwitnesses in order to prove the guilt against the accused to\n\nsecure conviction for offences under Section 302 and\nSection\nof the IPC. Further, the learned Sessions Judge has\n\nfailed to take note of the fact that PW-21 / B.S. Manjunath\n\nduring his cross examination, has deposed that they went to\n\nMumbai to apprehend Accused Nos.1 and 2 via private\n\nvehicle whereas PW-14 / Nataraj, S/o. Narayanaswamy has\n\ndeposed that they went through flight. The said\n\ninconsistency goes to the root of the matter in the present\n\ncase on hand, since it is a very important piece of evidence.\n\nPW-17 / Shri Lakshmi Balasubramaniam has admitted that\n\nif there are identical twins, then the DNA profile will be the\n\nsame. Such being the case, the prosecution has failed to\n\nconclusively establish the identity of the accused persons.\n\nThese facts have not at all been considered by the learned\n\n- 36 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nSessions Judge. The learned Sessions Judge has failed to\n\ntake note of the fact that the prosecution has failed to\n\nestablish the alleged enmity between the deceased and the\n\naccused persons. As such there was no motive for the\n\naccused persons to commit the murder of the deceased.\n\nFurther, the prosecution has not recovered any\n\nincriminating article at the instance of the appellants. When\n\nsuch being the case, the impugned judgment and order of\n\nconviction is unsustainable as against these appellants are\n\nconcerned.\n\n31. DNA analysis of the blood sample of the parents of\n\nthe deceased proved that the dead body was that of the\n\ndeceased Sridhar. However, if there are identical twins, then\n\nthe DNA profile will be the same. Such being the case, the\n\nTrial Court has failed to establish the identity of the\n\ndeceased person. Further, the mahazar witnesses cited by\n\nthe prosecution, have not completely supported the case of\n\nthe prosecution and there are material discrepancies even in\n\ntheir evidence which go to the very root of the case of the\n\nprosecution and as such the recovery of the article at the\n\n- 37 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\ninstance of the appellants would have no legs to stand.\n\nHence the impugned judgment and order of conviction and\n\nsentence is unsustainable and the same is liable to be set-\n\naside. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid reasons and\n\nfindings, we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment\n\nof conviction and order of sentence rendered by the Trial\n\nCourt suffers from infirmities and so also absurdities.\n\nConsequently\n,\nthe said judgment\nrequires intervention.\n\nAccordingly, we proceed to pass the following:\n\nORDER\n\nThe appeal preferred by the appellants / accused\n\nNos.1 to 7 under\nSection 374(2)\nCr.P.C. is hereby allowed.\n\nConsequently, the judgment of conviction and order of\n\nsentence dated 27.03.2017 rendered by the III Addl. District\n\n& Sessions Judge, Bengaluru Rural District, Sitting at\n\nAnekal in S.C.No.53/2010 is hereby set aside.\n\nConsequently the appellants / Accused Nos.1 to 7 are\n\nacquitted of the offences under\nSections 302\nand\nof the\n\nIPC for which they were charged.\n\n- 38 -\n\nNC: 2023:KHC:24390-DB\n\nCRL.A No. 666 of 2017\n\nAppellants / accused Nos.1 to 7 are on bail. Therefore,\n\nthe bail bonds if any executed by them, shall stand\n\ncancelled.\n\nIf Appellants / Accused Nos.1 to 7 have deposited any\n\nfine amount, the same shall be refunded to the respective\n\nappellants, on due identification.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nKS",
