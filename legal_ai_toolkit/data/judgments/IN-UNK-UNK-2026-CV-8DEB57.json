The writ petitioners state that they are working as\n\n Muzdoor Grade-I in Public Works Department and had completed\n\n more than 28 years of service. The Government issued various\n\n Government Orders granting the benefit of regularization to the\n\n daily rated employees and temporary employees working in the\n\n Public Works Department. However, the benefit of the said\n\n Government Order is not extended to the writ petitioners and still\n\n they are continuing as Mazdoors, on daily wages basis. Recently,\n\n the Government passed an order enhancing the salary of of the\n\n Mazdoors, equivalent to the scale of pay fixed for the post of\n\n Sweepers in the Government Departments along with Dearness\n\n 3\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Allowance in G.O.(Ms).No.233, Public Works (C2) Department,\n\n dated 06.12.2019.\n\n 3. The learned counsel for the petitioners articulated the case\n\n of the writ petitioners by stating that engagement of daily wage\n\n employees and allowing them to continue on temporary basis for\n\n long years is an exploitation. Thus, the grievances of the\n\n petitioners are to be redressed by regularizing their services in the\n\n sanctioned post, in the regular time scale of pay. The petitioners\n\n are in verge of retirement. Therefore, only by granting the benefit\n\n of regularization, they will be in a position to receive the pension\n\n and pensionary benefits. Many changes occurred regarding the\n\n engagement of daily rated employees / NMRs in Public Works\n\n Department. Many such temporary employees were regularized in\n\n the sanctioned post and working as regular employees. However,\n\n another set of people are denied the benefit of regularization,\n\n without any valid reason.\n\n 4. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners solicited the\n\n attention of this Court with reference to the Judgments wherein\n\n such engagements are considered as exploitation and the relief was\n\n also granted. However, some of the Judgments in relation to the\n\n 4\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n orders of the Inspector of Labour or under the \nTamil Nadu\n\n Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to\n\n Workmen) Act\n, this Court is of the considered opinion that those\n\n Labour Law may not have direct application with reference to the\n\n appointments made in public services in Government Departments.\n\n The Service Rules in Government Departments are independent\n\n and the Industrial or Labour Laws are not applicable to the\n\n appointments made in Government services. When the posts are\n\n governed under the Special Rules, the said Rules alone will prevail\n\n over the General Law. In other words, the Special Rules for a\n\n particular post or the Recruitment Rules for a particular post in a\n\n Government alone will prevail over in General Laws, including the\n\n Labour Law or Industrial Law.\n\n 5. This being the principles, the application of the \nTamil Nadu\n\n Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to\n\n Workmen) Act\n, cannot be applied in the present case, as the\n\n petitioners are engaged in the Department of Public Works to\n\n perform the Government work. The Government undoubtedly\n\n passed several orders periodically granting the benefit of\n\n regularization and permanent absorption. Certain conditions were\n\n imposed for grant of regularization and permanent absorption.\n\n 5\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Initially, the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and\n\n Administrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006 and the\n\n said Government Order was withdrawn and a revised order was\n\n passed in G.O.(Ms).No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n\n (F) Department, dated 27.06.2013. As per the said G.O.Ms.No.74,\n\n certain conditions were stipulated for grant of benefit of\n\n regularization.\n\n 6. Beyond all these Government Orders, the Constitutional\n\n Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, settled the legal\n\n principles in the matter of grant of regularization and permanent\n\n absorption. \nIn the case of \nUmadevi Vs. State of Karnataka\n\n reported in (2006) 4 SCC (1), the Constitution Bench in\n\n unequivocable terms held that regularization or permanent\n\n absorption cannot be granted in violation of Service Rules in force.\n\n The very practice of engaging the temporary employees and\n\n considering their length of services granting regularization or\n\n permanent absorption is opposed to Constitutional Principles.\n\nThus, the Constitution Bench in \nUmadevi\n case settled the legal\n\n principles in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption\n\n and in para 54 of the Judgment, more specifically, held that all\n\n other judgments, including the Judgments of Supreme Court\n\n 6\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n rendered earlier in the matter of regularization and permanent\n\n absorption denuded to loose its status as precedent.\n \nThus, the\n\n Constitution Bench Judgment in \nUmadevi\n case is the guiding\n\n principles to be followed by all the Courts and Government across\n\n the Country for grant of regularization and permanent absorption,\n\n with reference to the temporary appointments made.\n\n 7. In this context, it is relevant to look in to the subsequent\n\n Judgments of the Supreme Court and in the subsequent Judgments,\n\n where the relief of regularization is granted must be only based on\n\n some facts and circumstances and such Judgments of the Two\n\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot be considered\n\n as precedent so as to dilute the legal principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\n Umadevi. When the cases fall under the principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench, then, the decision is to be rendered based on\n\n the Constitution Bench Judgment and no other Judgment can be\n\n considered as the binding precedents.\n\n \n8. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners made a\n\n submission that it is the duty mandatory on the part of the\n\n respondents to consider the case of the writ petitioners for\n\n 7\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n regularisation in the existing vacancies since the writ petitioners\n\n have put in more than 28 years of their services as daily wage\n\n employees and their names are registered under the Nominal\n\n Muster Roll maintained by the respondents. It is not the case of\n\n appointment of the writ petitioners but the case of their\n\n regularisation is the contention of the writ petitioners. When the\n\n employees have completed 10 years of their services, without the\n\n intervention of any Court order then their services to be\n\n regularised as per paragraph 53 of the Constitution Bench\n\n judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of India, in the case of\n\n \nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n [(2006) 4 SCC 1], laid down\n\n the legal principles in the matter of regularisation, permanent\n\n absorption. The relevant Paragraph 53 of the judgment, cited\n\n supra, is extracted hereunder:-\n\n “53.One aspect needs to be clarified.\n\n There may be cases where irregular\n appointments (not illegal appointments) as\n explained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1\n SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\n Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2\n SCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC\n 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937]\n and referred to in para 15 above, of duly\n\n 8\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant\n posts might have been made and the\n employees have continued to work for ten\n years or more but without the intervention\n of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The\n question of regularisation of the services of\n such employees may have to be considered\n on merits in the light of the principles\n settled by this Court in the cases\n abovereferred to and in the light of this\n judgment. In that context, the Union of\n India, the State Governments and their\n instrumentalities should take steps to\n regularise as a one-time measure, the\n services of such irregularly appointed, who\n have worked for ten years or more in duly\n sanctioned posts but not under cover of\n orders of the courts or of tribunals and\n should further ensure that regular\n recruitments are undertaken to fill those\n vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\n filled up, in cases where temporary\n employees or daily wagers are being now\n employed. The process must be set in\n motion within six months from this date. We\n also clarify that regularisation, if any\n already made, but not sub judice, need not\n be reopened based on this judgment, but\n there should be no further bypassing of the\n\n 9\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n constitutional requirement and regularising\n or making permanent, those not duly\n appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n 9. The writ petitioners, though admit the fact that their\n\n appointment was irregular, contended that their appointments are\n\n not illegal and therefore their services ought to have been\n\n regularised in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n of India.\n\n 10. Further, it is contended that the right to life is a\n\n Fundamental Right enshrined in \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of\n\n India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, time and again,\n\n reiterated and emphasised that the right to life cannot be\n\n interpreted as a mere animal life and it is a decent life, which is to\n\n be ensured. The writ petitioners are deprived of their livelihood in\n\n view of the denial of regularisation which amounts to deprivation of\n\n their life. At the outset, it is stated that the writ petitioners have\n\n worked for 10 years or more and without the intervention of\n\n orders of the courts or of tribunals. In other words, the State\n\n Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\n\n regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\n\n 10\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly\n\n sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\n\n tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are\n\n undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\n\n filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are\n\n being now employed. The appointments of such employee should\n\n not be illegal. Even if irregular, where the appointments are not\n\n made against the sanctioned posts. Where a person employed\n\n under the open competitive process of prescribed qualifications and\n\n was working against the sanctioned posts, he had been selected\n\n without undergoing the open competitive process, such\n\n appointments are considered to be irregular.\n\n 11. Mooting out the above two principles, the learned counsel\n\n for the writ petitioners urged this Court by stating that in respect\n\n of the irregular appointments, there is no bar for granting\n\n regularisation. But the learned counsel is of the opinion that the\n\n illegal appointments alone, cannot be regularised. As far as the\n\n irregular appointments are concerned, the length of service is to be\n\n taken into account for the purpose of granting regularisation.\n\n Accordingly, the writ petitioners are entitled for regularisation in\n\n 11\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, cited\n\n supra.\n\n 12. The learned Additional Government Pleader, appearing\n\n on behalf of the respondents, submit that the writ petitioners were\n\n engaged as casual labourers for certain specific works under the\n\n provisions of paragraph 290 of T.N.PWA Code which is in\n\n connection with the execution of work. The writ petitioners have\n\n not been accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ\n\n petitioners were not engaged in connection with any affairs of the\n\n State Government. The Hon'ble High Court of Madras had already\n\n held that PWD is not an industry to involve the Industrial\n\n Establishment Rules. Further, it is submitted that the writ\n\n petitioners have not been appointed in sanctioned posts. The writ\n\n petitioners were engaged only to execute certain special and\n\n specified works on daily wage basis and therefore, the benefit of\n\n regularisation, cannot be granted.\n\n 13. Further, it is submitted that in Government Offices, there\n\n are specified sanction as to the category of post, number of such\n\n posts, scale of pay etc., and the method of recruitment to the posts\n\n 12\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n are defined by statutory rules such as Tamil Nadu State and\n\n Subordinate Service Rules and no deviation is permitted from the\n\n method of recruitment, howsoever, save the previous approval of\n\n the Government.\n\n 14. Paragraph 290 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Account Code\n\n specifies that with the following exceptions, all persons engaged\n\n departmentally for the execution of works are considered as day\n\n labourers and their wages should be drawn on Muster Rolls, Form\n\n 21 (C.Form Nos.474 and 475) and charged to the estimates of the\n\n works on which they are employed:-\n\n (i) Permanent and temporary employees of the division whose\n\n pay is charged to the head 'Establishment';\n\n (ii) Members of the works charged establishment as defined\n\n in paragraphs 58 to 62 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department\n\n Code.\n\n 15. Thus, the above two categories only form part of the\n\n establishment concerning with the PWD Office in the State and the\n\n 13\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n recruitment to the posts are made in accordance with the rules of\n\n the different services codified in Tamil Nadu Service Manual\n\n Volume I to III and therefore, the writ petitioners were engaged as\n\n casual labourers for the purpose of specified nature of work to\n\n which an estimate is got sanctioned as per Tamil Nadu Public\n\n Works Department Code, to the extent necessary.\n\n 16. Paragraph 290 of the TNPWD Code states that for the\n\n work done by daily labour, the subordinate incharge of the work\n\n will prepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on\n\n when practicable the work done and the amount payable.\n\n 17. As the writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\n\n for a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\n\n casual labour virtually stopped as and when the work is completed.\n\n The engagement was not made on daily wage basis or not made on\n\n any Service Rules. Thus, the question of regularisation of\n\n petitioners' NMR services do not arise.\n\n 18. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the\n\n respondents, further stated that paragraphs 6(i), (ii), (vi), (vii), (ix)\n\n of Government Order No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n\n (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, the Government have ordered\n\n that\n\n 14\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “6(i) This order shall be deemed to\n have been come into force with retrospective\n effect from 1.1.2006;\n\n 6(ii) The services of the full time daily\n wage employees, who were initially\n appointed on full time basis in consultation\n with the Employment Exchange, to\n discharge the function of the post in the\n Tamil Nadu Basic Service and completed 10\n (ten) years of service as on 1.1.2006 shall be\n regularised against regular vacancies in the\n sanctioned cadre strength; Further, in\n paragraph 6(ii), it is stated that the service\n of the full time daily wage employees who\n were initially appointed on full time basis in\n consultation with the Employment Exchange\n to discharge the function of the post in the\n Tamil Nadu Basic Service and completed ten\n years of service as on 1.1.2006 shall be\n regularised against regular vacancies in the\n sanctioned cadre strength;\n\n 6(vi) The part-time and casual\n employees are not entitled to the concession\n referred to at paragraph (ii) above;\n\n 6(vii) The services of the full time daily\n wage employees, who have completed 10\n years of service, after 1.1.2006, shall not be\n regularised;\n\n 15\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 6(ix) Stipulates that all the proposals\n for regularisation of the services of full time\n daily wages employees should be sent to the\n Government even in case where relaxation\n of rules are not involved”.\n\n 19. Whereas the writ petitioners in these writ petitions have\n\n not completed 10 years of service as on 1.1.2006 by daily wage\n\n basis. But, the writ petitioners were not appointed in consultation\n\n with the Employment Exchange as daily wagers. The Government\n\n Orders issued with regard to the regularisation of Contingent Staff\n\n to regular servants are only on completion of 10 years of\n\n continuous service as contingent servants. Thus, the question of\n\n regularisation of service of the writ petitioners do not arise.\n\n 20. In this regard, this Court delivered a judgment in WP No.\n\n 41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 regarding NMR case as follows:-\n\n “The petitioner produced a Certificate\n issued by one Assistant Engineer\n WRO/Public Works Department, Irrigation\n Section, Vadakkankulam to the effect that\n has been working as NMR from 1.6.1992. It\n is also not stated whether pursuant to any\n order, the petitioner has been working on\n the contrary, the petitioner's claim was that\n they should be absorbed by reglarising her\n\n 16\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n service. It is also admitted that she was not\n routed through Employment Exchange and\n the G.O.Ms.No.177, dated 4.6.1998, does\n not ensure to the benefit.\n\n \nThe Supreme Court in \nSecretary, State\n of Karnataka vs. Umadevi\n, reported in\n (2006) 4 SCC 1, has held that regularisation\n cannot be a method of recruitment unless\n the petitioner has the case for absorption.\n\n As per the orders of the Government in the\n Original Application (later converted into\n the writ petition) the relief claimed by the\n petitioner, cannot be countenanced by this\n Court. Hence, the writ petition stands\n dismissed.”\n\n 21. It is further submitted by the learned Additional\n\n Government Pleader for the respondents that the related issue was\n\n dealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\n\n Nos.2726-2729 of 2014 and referred the case between State of\n\n Karnataka and others vs. Uma Devi and others in AIR 2006\n\n SC 1806, held as under:-\n\n “There is no fundamental right in those\n who have been employed on daily wages or\n temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim\n that they have a right to be absorbed in\n service. As has been held by this Court, they\n\n 17\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\n regular appointment could be made only by\n making appointments consistent with the\n requirements of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n Constitution. The right to be treated equally\n with the other employees employed on daily\n wages, cannot be extended to a claim for\n equal treatment with those who were\n regularly employed. That would be treating\n unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on\n to claim a right to be absorbed in service even\n though they have never been selected in\n terms of the relevant recruitment rules.”\n\n \n22. The learned Additional Government Pleader also referred\n\n to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court case in \nState of\n\n Rajasthan and others vs. V.Dayal Lal and Others\n [AIR 2011\n\n SC 1193] held as under:-\n\n “(i) The High Courts, in exercising\n power under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n will not issue directions for regularisation,\n absorption or permanent continuance,\n unless the employees claiming\n regularisation had been appointed in\n pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n accordance with relevant rules in an open\n competitive process, against sanctioned\n vacant posts. The equality clause contained\n\n 18\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be\n scrupulously followed and Courts should\n not issue a direction for regularisation of\n services of an employee which would be\n violative of the constitutional scheme.\n While something that is irregular for want\n of compliance with one of the elements in\n the process of selection which does not go\n to the root of the process, can be\n regularised, back door entries,\n appointments contrary to the constitutional\n scheme and/or appointment of ineligible\n candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n (ii) Mere continuation of service by a\n temporary or ad hoc or daily-wage\n employee, under cover of some interim\n orders of the Court, would not confer upon\n him any right to be absorbed into service,\n as such service would be “litigious\n employment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or\n daily-wage service for a long number of\n years, let alone service for one or two\n years, will not entitle such employee to\n claim regularisation, if he is not working\n against a sanctioned post. Sympathy and\n sentiment cannot be grounds for passing\n any order of regularisation in the absence\n of a legal right.\n\n 19\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n (iii) Even where a scheme is\n formulated for regularisation with a cut-off\n date (that is a scheme providing that\n persons who had put in a specified number\n of years of service and continuing in\n employment as on the cut-off date), it is not\n possible to others who were appointed\n subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or\n contend that the scheme should be applied\n to them by extending the cut-off date or\n seek a direction for framing of fresh\n schemes providing for successive cut-off\n dates.\n\n (iv) Part-time employees are not\n entitled to seek regularisation as they are\n not working against any sanctioned posts.\n\n There cannot be a direction for absorption,\n regularisation or permanent continuance of\n part-time temporary employees.\n\n (v) Part-time temporary employees in\n government-run institutions cannot claim\n parity in salary with regular employees of\n the Government on the principle of equal\n pay for equal work. Nor can employees in\n private employment, even if serving full\n time, seek parity in salary with government\n employees. The right to claim a particular\n\n 20\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n salary against the State must arise under a\n contract or under a statute.”\n\n Based on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, cited supra,\n\n Codal Rules and Government orders, the claim of the writ\n\n petitioners cannot be considered.\n\n 23. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\n\n submitted that paragraph 290 of TNPWD Code states that “for\n\n work done by daily labour the subordinate incharge of the work will\n\n prepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on when\n\n practicable the work done and the amount payable”. The writ\n\n petitioners were engaged as casual labour for a specified work and\n\n that necessity for engagement of such casual labour virtually\n\n stopped as and when the work is completed. The writ petitioners\n\n have not been accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ\n\n petitioners cannot claim any right for this casual labour work.\n\n 24. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\n\n submitted that as per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\n\n Department dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\n\n Department, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\n\n 21\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Administrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, Hon'ble\n\n High Court in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.\n\n 2726-2729 of 2014, dated 21.2.2014 judgment, cited supra, the\n\n claim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered.\n\n 25. The writ petitioners were not employed in connection\n\n with the affairs of the State as defined in \nArticle 323-A\n of the\n\n Constitution of India and they were only casual labourers co-\n\n terminus with the purposeful completion of the work concerned as\n\n per the Acts and the Rules, in which such provision for the\n\n deployment of casual labour is made. Thus, the writ petitioners are\n\n estopped from invoking the lofty jurisdiction of this Apex Forum\n\n outside the ambit of the constitutional provisions.\n\n 26. At the outset, the grounds relied on by the learned\n\n Additional Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the\n\n respondents, are enumerated as under:-\n\n (i) The engagement of casual labour and payment made by\n\n way of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\n\n Chapter X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n\n 291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n 22\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n (ii) The casual labourers thus engaged for a particular work\n\n cannot be regularised how so ever in any manner, without sanction\n\n of the post, scale of pay etc., by the Government;\n\n (iii) The writ petitioners were not employed in connection\n\n with the affairs of the State as defined in \nArticle 323-A\n of the\n\n Constitution of India and the writ petitioners were only casual\n\n labourers co-terminus with the purposeful completion of the works\n\n concerned as per the Acts and the Rules in which such provisions\n\n for the deployment of casual labour is made;\n\n (iv) The engagement of casual labourers and payment made\n\n by way of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\n\n Chamber X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n\n 291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n (v) As per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\n\n Department, dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\n\n Department, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\n\n Administrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, this\n\n Court in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.\n\n 2726-2729 of 2014 dated 21.2.2014, judgment cited supra, the\n\n claim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered;\n\n 23\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n (vi) The Government have issued orders in G.O.Ms.No.680,\n\n Public Works (C2) Department, dated 16.8.1995 for complete ban\n\n on appointing new Nominal Muster Rolls, which is already in force.\n\n In this regard, D.O.Letter No.26860/C2/2009-2 dated 15.10.2009\n\n received from the Principal Secretary to Government, PWD,\n\n Chennai, is submitted for perusal. Thus, the Article quoted in the\n\n application, cannot be correlated with the affairs of the State;\n\n (vii) The writ petitioners were not borne on any cadre\n\n strength of the erstwhile work charged establishment (now\n\n amended in Tamil Nadu Engineering Subordinate Service) and the\n\n service and the writ petitioners were not connected with the affairs\n\n of the State Government;\n\n (viii) The writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\n\n for a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\n\n casual labourers virtually stopped as and when the work was\n\n completed. In view of the above, the claim of the writ petitioners\n\n cannot be considered.\n\n 24\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n \n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the learned\n\n counsel for the petitioners as well as the learned counsel for the\n\n respondents, this Court has to first consider the factual matrix\n\n involved in these writ petitions on hand. The writ petitioners,\n\n undoubtedly, were appointed as daily wage employees in the year\n\n 2003 and they are continued in service for more than ten years, is\n\n the claim set out in these writ petitions. However, pursuant to the\n\n Judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n of India in the case of \nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n,\n\n reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as\n\n “Umadevi Case”], one time benefit was granted by the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n \n28. Even before \nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil Nadu\n\n issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\n\n Department, dated 28.02.2006. As per the said Government Order,\n\n the temporary employees who have completed ten years of service\n\n as on the date of the Government Order can be regularised. Even\n\n prior to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the\n\n Government issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\n\n Reforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, granting the benefit of\n\n 25\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n one time regularization in respect of the temporary employees who\n\n have completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the\n\n State was extending the benefit of regularization or permanent\n\n absorption to the temporary/daily rated employees who have\n\n completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n 29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large number of\n\n temporary employees were conferred with the benefit of\n\n regularization and based on that, the writ petitioner also raised his\n\n claim for regularization. However, after the Constitution Bench\n\n judgment rendered in “Umadevi Case”, the State Government\n\n issued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department,\n\n dated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the\n\n Government have imposed certain conditions and those conditions\n\n are akin to that of the recruitment rules in force. The very idea of\n\n issuing G.O.Ms.No.74, is to provide certain restricted concession to\n\n the temporary employees who were otherwise appointed by\n\n following the recruitment rules in force. Therefore, the prospectus\n\n of the large number of employees who have served on daily wage\n\n basis are prevented from getting their regularization. In other\n\n words, the said G.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and\n\n restrictions for regularization and for granting permanent\n\n 26\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n absorption. Thus, the persons who are eligible to be regularized\n\n under G.O.Ms.No.22, are prevented from getting the benefit from\n\n and out of the said Government order and G.O.Ms.No.74, imposes\n\n certain restrictions.\n\n 30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this\n\n Court that in the similar circumstances, the learned Single Judge of\n\n this Court dealt with the issues in W.P.No.29346 of 2014 &\n\n etc.,batch and delivered a judgment on 22.09.2017, setting aside\n\n the said G.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending the same with\n\n retrospective effect. In other words, the implementation of the\n\n Government orders was restricted only prospectively and\n\n accordingly, the relief of regularization was granted to those writ\n\n petitioners.\n\n 31. The learned Additional Government Pleader brought to\n\n the notice of this Court that the State preferred Writ Appeals in\n\n W.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in W.P.29346/14, W.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in\n\n W.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr. No.89142/17 in W.P.No.15668/14,\n\n W.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in W.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17 in\n\n W.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against \nthe said judgment\n and the\n\n same is pending.\n\n 27\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues independently\n\n and based on the judgments of the Apex Court of India in the\n\n matter of regularization and permanent absorption. However, the\n\n learned Additional Government Pleader brought to the notice of\n\n this Court that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court passed an\n\n order in the batch of Writ Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of 2012 and etc.,\n\n batch on 10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench has\n\n considered the terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 and\n\n passed an order stating that the services shall not be disturbed in\n\n the light of the Government Order passed in G.O.Ms.No.74,\n\n Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department dated\n\n 27.06.2013 as well as the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India in Civil Appeal Nos.2726-2729 of 2014 with Nos.\n\n 2730-31 of 2014.\n\n 33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the opinion that\n\n the terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 had already\n\n been taken note of by the Hon'ble Division Bench and the entire\n\n Government Order was upheld and the direction was issued to pass\n\n orders in the light of the G.O.Ms.No.74 and therefore, the judgment\n\n delivered by the learned Single Judge, need not be relied upon and\n\n 28\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n more so, the State also preferred writ appeals against the said\n\n orders.\n\n 34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to consider the\n\n issues independently based on the judgments of the Apex Court of\n\n India.\n\n 35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of\n\n regularization and permanent absorption is the judgment of the\n\n Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\n “Umadevi Case”. All other subsequent judgments cited by the\n\n respective counsels are by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\n Supreme Court of India. Thus, the binding nature of the judgments\n\n rendered in respect of other cases has to be cogently read and\n\n harmoniously interpreted based on the legal principles settled by\n\n the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n 36. Before considering the subject of regularization and\n\n permanent absorption, this Court has to consider the interpretation\n\n of the judgments on “binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In\n\n view of the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has cited\n\n number of judgments, which were passed subsequent to the\n\n 29\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Constitution Bench judgment, stating that Paragraph (53) of the\n\n “Umadevi Case” has been interpreted in different ways and under\n\n different circumstances and the present case is also to be\n\n considered and a direction to be issued for regularization. In view\n\n of the fact that large number of judgments are cited before this\n\n Court in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption,\n\n now, this Court has to first decide what all are the judgments which\n\n all are having a “binding precedent” and on this reason, this Court\n\n has to consider very interpretation of the concept regarding\n\n “binding precedent”. \nIn respect of judgments in relation to the\n\n interpretation of “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\n\n consider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India in the case of \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi\n\n and Others\n, reported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is pertinent to\n\n note that it is a judgment by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India headed by His Lordship, Hon'ble Chief\n\n Justice of India, Dipak Misra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of\n\n India delivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote paragraphs\n\n (15 to 26):\n\n 30\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 16. Presently, we may refer to certain decisions which\n deal with the concept of binding precedent.\n\n 17. \nIn \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n alias Kalika\n Singh and others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it has\n been held:-\n\n “10. … an earlier decision may seem to be incorrect to a\n Bench of a coordinate jurisdiction considering the\n question later, on the ground that a possible aspect of\n the matter was not considered or not raised before the\n court or more aspects should have been gone into by\n the court deciding the matter earlier but it would not be\n a reason to say that the decision was rendered per\n incuriam and liable to be ignored. The earlier judgment\n may seem to be not correct yet it will have the binding\n effect on the later Bench of coordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\n 17.1.The Court has further ruled:-\n\n “10. … Easy course of saying that earlier decision was\n rendered per incuriam is not permissible and the\n matter will have to be resolved only in two ways —\n either to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter\n to a larger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt\n that earlier decision is not correct on merits.”\n\n 18. In G.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and others\n (2014) 13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted the said\n principle on the basis of judgments of this Court\n rendered in Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India\n Ltd. (1985) 4 SCC 369), Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija\n v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra (1989) 3 SCC\n\n 396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar v.\n\n \nRatilal Motilal Patel (AIR 1968 SC 372). It may be\n noted here that the Constitution Bench in \nMadras Bar\n Association v. Union of India and another\n [JT\n 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the prior\n Constitution Bench judgment in \nUnion of India v.\n Madras Bar Association [JT\n 2010 (5) SC 553]is a\n binding precedent.\n Be it clarified, the issues that were\n put to rest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment\n\n 31\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n \n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India, while dealing with the cases of accident claims, has\n\n elaborately discussed about the “binding precedent”. The case in\n\n relation to the Motor Accident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma”\n\n was being followed by all the Courts across the Country for the\n\n purpose of awarding compensation. When the question arosed that\n\n the “binding nature” of the said case of “Sarla Verma” delivered\n\n by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\n\n headed by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that the principles\n\n \nlaid down in\n the case of “ \nVirayya v. Venkata Subbayya”\n , it has\n\n been held by the Andhra Pradesh High Court that under the\n\n circumstances aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that view which\n\n is in accordance with justice and legal principles after taking into\n\n consideration the views expressed in the two conflicting Benches, it\n\n is further held that in the case of \nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n\n alias Kalika Singh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n\n 489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be not correct\n\n yet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench of coordinate\n\n jurisdiction.\n \nTheir Lordships rendered the case of \nChandra\n\n Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n, reported in\n\n 32\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n [JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding precedent\n\n is of utmost importance in the administration of our judicial system.\n\n It promotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\n\n consistency promotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is\n\n this need for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in\n\n the decisions of this Court.\n\n 38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard, the\n\n Apex Court of India held that the judgment by the Larger Bench of\n\n the Courts are to be treated as “binding precedent”, while deciding\n\n the legal principles involved in the particular case.\n\n 39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India in the case of Padma Sundara Rao and Others Vs.\n\n State of Tamil Nadu and others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC\n\n 533, and the relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n “9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions\n without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in\n with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance\n is placed. There is always peril in treating the words of\n a speech or judgment as though they are words in a\n legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that\n\n 33\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts\n of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v.\n British Railways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC\n 877 (HL) [Sub nom British Railways Board v.\n\n Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial\n flexibility, one additional or different fact may make a\n world of difference between conclusions in two cases.”\n\n 40. In view of the legal principle settled in the matter of\n\n “binding precedent”, now, this Court is bound by the legal\n\n principles settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there\n\n is no other subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in respect of\n\n the subject of regularization and permanent absorption. The last\n\n judgment rendered by the Constitution Bench in the subject matter\n\n is “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of “binding precedent”\n\n or to be followed as “binding precedent”. Thus, the facts and\n\n circumstances of the present writ petition has to be considered only\n\n in the light of the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench.\n\n All other judgments subsequently passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India may have certain distinctions far and against.\n\n However, these judgments are to be interpreted only based on the\n\n 34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n facts and circumstances prevailing in that particular case and\n\n therefore, this Court cannot consider those judgments delivered on\n\n a particular facts in relation to that particular case. However, the\n\n legal principles are to be considered in relation to the facts and\n\n circumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n 41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by the\n\n Constitution Bench in the matter of regularization and permanent\n\n absorption. Paragraph (5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n “5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions\n which could not be said to be consistent with the\n constitutional scheme of public employment. Such\n directions are issued presumably on the basis of\n equitable considerations or individualisation of justice.\n The question arises, equity to whom? Equity for the\n handful of people who have approached the court with a\n claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this country\n seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\n competing for employment? When one side of the coin\n is considered, the other side of the coin has also to be\n considered and the way open to any court of law or\n justice, is to adhere to the law as laid down by the\n Constitution and not to make directions, which at times,\n even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\n\n 35\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n certainly tend to water down the constitutional\n requirements. It is this conflict that is reflected in these\n cases referred to the Constitution Bench”\n\n 42. This Court wants to look into the very findings made by\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above said paragraph\n\n (5), the Apex Court has conceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n of India had also on occasions, issued directions, which could not\n\n be said to be consistent with the Constitutional schemes of public\n\n employment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\n\n equitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that equity to\n\n whom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the\n\n Court with the claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this\n\n Country seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\n\n competing for employment? When one side of the coin is\n\n considered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered and\n\n the way open to any Court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law\n\n as laid down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which\n\n at times, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\n\n certainly tend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is\n\n this Conflict that reflected in these cases referred to the\n\n Constitution Bench.\n\n 36\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern\n\n recorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The concern\n\n raised by the Constitution Bench is that by granting relief to a\n\n handful of people, the large sector of meritorious youth of this\n\n great nation cannot be deprived of their constitutional rights.\n\n Under this pretext, the Constitution Bench commenced its\n\n consideration in “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the very enumeration in\n\n the above paragraph is crystal clear that the Constitution Bench\n\n has laid down the principle in the matter of regularization and\n\n permanent absorption and the idea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n of India has to stop the practice of appointing employees, through\n\n back door on extraneous consideration by showing favoritism and\n\n nepotism.\n\n 44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi Case” is\n\n extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“10. When these matters came up before a Bench of\n two Judges, the learned Judges referred the cases to a\n Bench of three Judges. The order of reference is\n reported in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (1)\n [(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 935 : (2003) 9\n Scale 187] .

After having found that there is conflict of opinion\n between the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court,\n we are of the view that these cases are required to be\n heard by a Bench of five learned Judges.\n\n 5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the\n Chief Justice for appropriate orders.”\n\n We are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue\n here. We have to lay down the law. We have to approach\n the question as a constitutional court should.”\n\n 39\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that there were\n\n conflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by\n\n two-Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and\n\n therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\n\n the question required to be considered by a larger Bench. It is\n\n further observed that when the matters came up before a three-\n\n Judge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\n\n consideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in\n\n the light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor\n\n General. In the reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench\n\n itself decided that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\n\n \nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n and \n335\n of the Constitution and, therefore,\n\n these cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\n\n Judges(Constitution Bench).\n\n 46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi Case”, it is stated\n\n that in addition to the equality clause represented by \nArticle 14\n of\n\n the Constitution, \nArticle 16\n has specifically provided for equality of\n\n opportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these\n\n fundamental rights, \nArticle 309\n provides that subject to the\n\n provisions of the Constitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate\n\n 40\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to\n\n public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union\n\n or of a State.\n\n 47. In view of the interpretation placed on \nArticle 12\n of the\n\n Constitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also govern\n\n the instrumentalities that come within the purview of \nArticle 12\n of\n\n the Constitution. With a view to make the procedure for selection\n\n fair, the Constitution by \nArticle 315\n has also created a Public\n\n Service Commission for the Union and the Public Service\n\n Commissions for the States. \nArticle 320\n deals with the functions of\n\n the Public Service Commissions and mandates consultation with\n\n the Commission on all matters relating to methods of recruitment\n\n to civil services and for civil posts and other related matters. As a\n\n part of the affirmative action recognised by \nArticle 16\n of the\n\n Constitution, \nArticle 335\n provides for special consideration in the\n\n matter of claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and\n\n Scheduled Tribes for employment.\n\n 48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi Case” reads as\n\n follows:\n\n 41\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “12. In spite of this scheme, there may be\n occasions when the sovereign State or its\n instrumentalities will have to employ persons, in\n posts which are temporary, on daily wages, as\n additional hands or taking them in without\n following the required procedure, to discharge\n the duties in respect of the posts that are\n sanctioned and that are required to be filled in\n terms of the relevant procedure established by\n the Constitution or for work in temporary posts\n or projects that are not needed permanently.\n This right of the Union or of the State\n Government cannot but be recognised and there\n is nothing in the Constitution which prohibits\n such engaging of persons temporarily or on\n daily wages, to meet the needs of the situation.\n But the fact that such engagements are resorted\n to, cannot be used to defeat the very scheme of\n public employment. Nor can a court say that the\n Union or the State Governments do not have the\n right to engage persons in various capacities for\n a duration or until the work in a particular\n project is completed. Once this right of the\n Government is recognised and the mandate of\n the constitutional requirement for public\n employment is respected, there cannot be much\n difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\n\n 42\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n ordinarily not proper for the Courts whether\n acting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution or\n under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution, to direct\n absorption in permanent employment of those\n who have been engaged without following a due\n process of selection as envisaged by the\n constitutional scheme.”\n\n 49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\n judgment is that the temporary engagements like daily wage\n\n appointments, consolidated pay appointments and temporary\n\n appointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to\n\n defeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a Court say\n\n that the Union or the State Governments do not have the right to\n\n engage persons in various capacities for a duration or until the\n\n work in a particular project is completed. Once this right of the\n\n Government is recognised and the mandate of the constitutional\n\n requirement for public employment is respected, there cannot be\n\n much difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is ordinarily not\n\n proper for the Courts, whether acting under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\n Constitution or under \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution, to direct\n\n absorption in permanent employment of those who have been\n\n engaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged\n\n 43\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n by the constitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the\n\n Constitutional Bench that regular recruitment rules in force,\n\n followed scrupulously by the competent authorities and\n\n engagements on temporary basis cannot be resorted or the same\n\n cannot lead to permanent absorption or regularization. Further, it\n\n is stated that the Government is entitled to appoint the persons on\n\n daily wages/consolidated pay/temporary basis, if a Government is\n\n of the opinion that a project has to be implemented or a special\n\n works to be carried out, then they are at liberty to do so, by\n\n engaging the temporary employees. Such being the concept\n\n accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a mere\n\n appointment on temporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a\n\n right for the employees to claim regularization or permanent\n\n absorption.\n\n 50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\n judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n “13. What is sought to be pitted against\n this approach, is the so-called equity\n arising out of giving of temporary\n employment or engagement on daily\n wages and the continuance of such\n persons in the engaged work for a certain\n\n 44\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n length of time. Such considerations can\n have only a limited role to play, when\n every qualified citizen has a right to\n apply for appointment, the adoption of\n the concept of rule of law and the scheme\n of the Constitution for appointment to\n posts. It cannot also be forgotten that it is\n not the role of the courts to ignore,\n encourage or approve appointments\n made or engagements given outside the\n constitutional scheme. In effect, orders\n based on such sentiments or approach\n would result in perpetuating illegalities\n and in the jettisoning of the scheme of\n public employment adopted by us while\n adopting the Constitution. The approving\n of such acts also results in depriving\n many of their opportunity to compete for\n public employment. We have, therefore,\n to consider the question objectively and\n based on the constitutional and statutory\n provisions. \nIn this context, we have also\n to bear in mind the exposition of law by a\n Constitution Bench in \nState of Punjab v.\n Jagdip Singh\n [(1964) 4 SCR 964 : AIR\n 1964 SC 521] . It was held therein: (SCR\n pp. 971-72)\n “In our opinion where a government\n servant has no right to a post or to a\n\n 45\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n particular status, though an authority\n under the Government acting beyond its\n competence had purported to give that\n person a status which it was not entitled\n to give he will not in law be deemed to\n have been validly appointed to the post\n or given the particular status.”\n\n 51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement made by\n\n the Constitution Bench in respect of providing equal opportunity\n\n and in respect of implementing the equality clause enshrined under\n\n \nArticle 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution. In the above said paragraph\n\n (13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has emphasized that it\n\n cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the Courts to\n\n ignore, encourage or approve appointments made or engagements\n\n given outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on\n\n such sentiments or approach would result in perpetuating\n\n illegalities and in the jettisoning of the scheme of public\n\n employment adopted by us, while adopting the Constitution. We,\n\n the people of India, while adopting the Constitution.\n\n \n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many\n\n of their opportunity to compete for public employment. The\n\n 46\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Constitution Bench of “Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition\n\n of law \nlaid down by\n the previous Constitution Bench in the case of\n\n \nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported in [AIR (1964) SC\n\n 521].\n \nThe earlier Constitution Bench in the case of \nState of\n\n Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant\n\n has no right to a post or to a particular status, though an authority\n\n under the Government acting beyond its competence had purported\n\n to give that person a status which it was not entitled to give he will\n\n not in law be deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\n\n given the particular status.\n\n 53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment, the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has elaborately discussed about\n\n various orders of the Courts either interim orders or final orders\n\n which were brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion that those\n\n orders more or less was the issue of directions for continuation or\n\n absorption without referring to the legal position obtaining. It was\n\n brought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been created by\n\n such orders without reference to the legal principles and it is time\n\n that this Court settled the law once and for all so that in case the\n\n Court finds that such orders should not be made, the Courts,\n\n 47\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n especially, the High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\n\n directions or passing such orders.\n\n 54. The very arguments advanced by the learned counsel for\n\n the State of Karnataka is that a chaos was created on account of\n\n various contradicting orders passed by the High Courts in the\n\n matter of regularization or permanent absorption in order to settle\n\n the legal principles. The learned counsel urged the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India to take note of the fact that there is a chaos\n\n prevailing in respect of the regularization and permanent\n\n absorption of the temporary/daily wages employees and brought to\n\n the notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High\n\n Courts would be precluded from issuing any such directions or\n\n passing such orders in contrary to the legal principles in the\n\n matters of regularization or permanent absorption or appointment.\n\n The observation made in this regard is that bypassing of the\n\n Constitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by the passing of\n\n orders without dealing with and deciding the validity of such orders\n\n on the touchstone of Constitutionality.\n\n 55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\n judgment which is extracted hereunder:\n\n 48\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “20. The decision in Dharwad Distt. \nPWD Literate\n Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n\n [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12\n ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a scheme\n framed by the State of Karnataka, though at the\n instance of the Court. The scheme was essentially\n relating to the application of the concept of equal pay\n for equal work but it also provided for making\n permanent, or what it called regularisation, without\n keeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had\n been appointed ad hoc, casually, temporarily or on\n daily-wage basis. In other words, employees who had\n been appointed without following the procedure\n established by law for such appointments. This Court,\n at the threshold, stated that it should individualise\n justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\n possible to accept the statement, unqualified as it\n appears to be. This Court is not only the constitutional\n court, it is also the highest court in the country, the\n final court of appeal. By virtue of \nArticle 141\n of the\n Constitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the\n land. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its main\n role is to interpret the constitutional and other\n statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\n philosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\n ourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The\n role of the Supreme Court is to render justice according\n to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is\n\n 49\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n expected to decide questions of law for the country and\n not to decide individual cases without reference to such\n principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders\n not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to\n send out confusing signals and usher in judicial chaos.\n Its role, therefore, is really to interpret the law and\n decide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders\n which are inconsistent with the legal conclusions\n arrived at by the court in the selfsame judgment not\n only create confusion but also tend to usher in\n arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity\n tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.”\n\n \n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt. \nPWD\n\n Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. Vs. State of Karnataka\n,\n\n reported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was considered in the above\n\n paragraph. It is observed that the role of the Court to interpret the\n\n law and decide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders\n\n which are inconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\n\n Court in the self same judgment not only create confusion but also\n\n tend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that\n\n equity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\n\n 50\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n\n has accepted the decision, the question of law for the country and\n\n not to decide individual cases without reference to such principles\n\n of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with\n\n its own decisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals and\n\n result in judicial chaos. The observation made in this regard are\n\n certainly to be followed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n 58. \nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex Court\n\n referred the spirit of \nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n,\n\n reported in (1973) 4 SCC 225, the Court held that \nArticle 14\n \n&\n\n 16\n which was described as a facet of \nArticle 14\n is part of the basic\n\n structure of the Constitution.\n \nIn the case of \nIndra Sawhney Vs.\n\n Union of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168\n, \nthe said decision\n\n was reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\n\n transgress the basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the\n\n principle of equality enshrined in \nArticle 14\n of which \nArticle 16(1)\n\n is a facet.\n\n 59. \nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the above said\n\n case of \nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000)\n\n 51\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 1 SCC 168, it is held that equality and equal opportunity is a basis\n\n feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant position of\n\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution in the scheme of things.\n\n \n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in the\n\n case of \nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n\n (1987) 1 SCC 378 and the relevant paragraph (3) is extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n “3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our\n Constitution and it is the essence of the rule of law\n that the exercise of the power by the State whether it\n be the legislature or the executive or any other\n authority should be within the constitutional\n limitations and if any practice is adopted by the\n executive which is in flagrant and systematic violation\n of its constitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a\n member of the public would have sufficient interest to\n challenge such practice by filing a writ petition and it\n would be the constitutional duty of this Court to\n entertain the writ petition and adjudicate upon the\n validity of such practice”\n\n 61. Let us now look into the way in which the Constitution\n\n Bench has arrived the conclusion in the matter of regularization\n\n and permanent absorption in “Umadevi Case” and the relevant\n\n paragraphs (43) to (50), which all are extracted hereunder:\n\n 52\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of\n equality in public employment is a basic feature of our\n Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our\n Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled from\n passing an order upholding a violation of \nArticle 14\n or\n in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with\n the requirements of \nArticle 14\n read with \nArticle 16\n of\n the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme\n for public employment, this Court while laying down\n the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\n appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a\n proper competition among qualified persons, the same\n would not confer any right on the appointee. If it is a\n contractual appointment, the appointment comes to an\n end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement\n or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\n same would come to an end when it is discontinued.\n Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be\n made permanent on the expiry of his term of\n appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\n because a temporary employee or a casual wage\n worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\n appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in\n regular service or made permanent, merely on the\n strength of such continuance, if the original\n appointment was not made by following a due process\n of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not\n open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the\n instance of temporary employees whose period of\n\n 53\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees\n who by the very nature of their appointment, do not\n acquire any right. The High Courts acting under \nArticle\n 226\n of the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue\n directions for absorption, regularisation, or permanent\n continuance unless the recruitment itself was made\n regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.\n\n Merely because an employee had continued under\n cover of an order of the court, which we have described\n as “litigious employment” in the earlier part of the\n judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be\n absorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in\n such cases, the High Court may not be justified in\n issuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately\n the employee approaching it is found entitled to relief,\n it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a\n manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to\n him, whereas an interim direction to continue his\n employment would hold up the regular procedure for\n selection or impose on the State the burden of paying\n an employee who is really not required. The courts\n must be careful in ensuring that they do not interfere\n unduly with the economic arrangement of its affairs by\n the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the\n instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the\n constitutional and statutory mandates.\n\n 44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work” is\n different from the concept of conferring permanency on\n those who have been appointed on ad hoc basis,\n\n 54\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n temporary basis, or based on no process of selection as\n envisaged by the rules. This Court has in various\n decisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal\n work and has laid down the parameters for the\n application of that principle. The decisions are rested\n on the concept of equality enshrined in our Constitution\n in the light of the directive principles in that behalf. But\n the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a\n position where the court could direct that appointments\n made without following the due procedure established\n by law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to\n treat them as permanent. Doing so, would be negation\n of the principle of equality of opportunity. The power to\n make an order as is necessary for doing complete\n justice in any cause or matter pending before this\n Court, would not normally be used for giving the go-by\n to the procedure established by law in the matter of\n public employment. Take the situation arising in the\n cases before us from the State of Karnataka. Therein,\n after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC\n (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the\n Government had issued repeated directions and\n mandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc\n employment or engagement be given. Some of the\n authorities and departments had ignored those\n directions or defied those directions and had continued\n to give employment, specifically interdicted by the\n orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing\n officers have even been punished for their defiance. It\n\n 55\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n would not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise\n of jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n or 32 of the\n Constitution or in exercise of power under \nArticle 142\n\n of the Constitution permitting those persons engaged,\n to be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on\n their appointments or engagements. Complete justice\n would be justice according to law and though it would\n be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court\n would not grant a relief which would amount to\n perpetuating an illegality.\n\n 45. While directing that appointments, temporary\n or casual, be regularised or made permanent, the\n courts are swayed by the fact that the person\n concerned has worked for some time and in some cases\n for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the\n person who accepts an engagement either temporary or\n casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\n employment. He accepts the employment with open\n eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\n bargain—not at arm's length—since he might have been\n searching for some employment so as to eke out his\n livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that\n ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the\n constitutional scheme of appointment and to take the\n view that a person who has temporarily or casually got\n employed should be directed to be continued\n permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\n mode of public appointment which is not permissible. If\n the court were to void a contractual employment of this\n\n 56\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n nature on the ground that the parties were not having\n equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the\n court to grant any relief to that employee. A total\n embargo on such casual or temporary employment is\n not possible, given the exigencies of administration and\n if imposed, would only mean that some people who at\n least get employment temporarily, contractually or\n casually, would not be getting even that employment\n when securing of such employment brings at least some\n succour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our\n vast country are in search of employment and one is not\n compelled to accept a casual or temporary employment\n if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It\n is in that context that one has to proceed on the basis\n that the employment was accepted fully knowing the\n nature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In\n other words, even while accepting the employment, the\n person concerned knows the nature of his employment.\n It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense of\n the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\n which he is temporarily employed or the interest in that\n post cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as\n to enable the giving up of the procedure established,\n for making regular appointments to available posts in\n the services of the State. The argument that since one\n has been working for some time in the post, it will not\n be just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of\n the nature of the employment when he first took it up,\n is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the\n\n 57\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n procedure established by law for public employment\n and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of\n constitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined\n in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n 46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the\n respondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine of\n legitimate expectation, the employees, especially of the\n Commercial Taxes Department, should be directed to\n be regularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990) 2\n SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 :\n\n (1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 :\n\n \n1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3\n SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M. Puthuparambil v. Kerala\n Water Authority\n, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S)\n 25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural\n University [Gujarat Agricultural University v. Rathod\n Labhu Bechar\n, (2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC (L&S)\n 613] and the like, have given rise to an expectation in\n them that their services would also be regularised. The\n doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\n administrative authority affect the person by depriving\n him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he\n had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to\n enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be\n permitted to continue to do until there have been\n communicated to him some rational grounds for\n withdrawing it on which he has been given an\n opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received\n assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be\n\n 58\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of\n advancing reasons for contending that they should not\n be withdrawn.\n \n[See Lord Diplock in Council for Civil\n Services Union v.

State of Rajasthan\n [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .] There is no\n case that any assurance was given by the Government\n or the department concerned while making the\n appointment on daily wages that the status conferred\n on him will not be withdrawn until some rational reason\n comes into existence for withdrawing it. The very\n engagement was against the constitutional scheme.\n\n Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes\n Department sought to get the appointments made\n permanent, there is no case that at the time of\n appointment any promise was held out. No such\n promise could also have been held out in view of the\n circulars and directives issued by the Government after\n Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S)\n 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though,\n there is a case that the State had made regularisations\n in the past of similarly situated employees, the fact\n remains that such regularisations were done only\n pursuant to judicial directions, either of the\n Administrative Tribunal or of the High Court and in\n some cases by this Court. Moreover, the invocation of\n\n 59\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable the\n employees to claim that they must be made permanent\n or they must be regularised in the service though they\n had not been selected in terms of the rules for\n appointment. The fact that in certain cases the court\n had directed regularisation of the employees involved\n in those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim\n based on legitimate expectation. The argument if\n accepted would also run counter to the constitutional\n mandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to\n be rejected.\n\n 47. When a person enters a temporary\n employment or gets engagement as a contractual or\n casual worker and the engagement is not based on a\n proper selection as recognised by the relevant rules or\n procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\n appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\n nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of\n legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post\n when an appointment to the post could be made only by\n following a proper procedure for selection and in cases\n concerned, in consultation with the Public Service\n Commission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate\n expectation cannot be successfully advanced by\n temporary, contractual or casual employees. It cannot\n also be held that the State has held out any promise\n while engaging these persons either to continue them\n where they are or to make them permanent. The State\n cannot constitutionally make such a promise. It is also\n\n 60\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n obvious that the theory cannot be invoked to seek a\n positive relief of being made permanent in the post.\n\n 48. It was then contended that the rights of the\n employees thus appointed, under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of\n the Constitution, are violated. It is stated that the State\n has treated the employees unfairly by employing them\n on less than minimum wages and extracting work from\n them for a pretty long period in comparison with those\n directly recruited who are getting more wages or\n salaries for doing similar work. The employees before\n us were engaged on daily wages in the department\n concerned on a wage that was made known to them.\n There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not\n being paid. Those who are working on daily wages\n formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\n they are discriminated as against those who have been\n regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\n No right can be founded on an employment on daily\n wages to claim that such employee should be treated on\n a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and made\n permanent in employment, even assuming that the\n principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for\n equal work. There is no fundamental right in those who\n have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or\n on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to\n be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court,\n they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\n regular appointment could be made only by making\n appointments consistent with the requirements of\n\n 61\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The right to be\n treated equally with the other employees employed on\n daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal\n treatment with those who were regularly employed.\n That would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot\n also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in\n service even though they have never been selected in\n terms of the relevant recruitment rules. The arguments\n based on \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution are\n therefore overruled.\n\n 49. It is contended that the State action in not\n regularising the employees was not fair within the\n framework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels\n the State to make appointments as envisaged by the\n Constitution and in the manner we have indicated\n earlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees\n had worked for some length of time but this has also\n been brought about by the pendency of proceedings in\n tribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the\n employees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this\n nature would mean that the State would be permitted\n to perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public\n employment and that would be a negation of the\n constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of\n India. It is therefore not possible to accept the\n argument that there must be a direction to make\n permanent all the persons employed on daily wages.\n When the court is approached for relief by way of a\n writ, the court has necessarily to ask itself whether the\n\n 62\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n person before it had any legal right to be enforced.\n Considered in the light of the very clear constitutional\n scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have been\n able to establish a legal right to be made permanent\n even though they have never been appointed in terms\n of the relevant rules or in adherence of \nArticles 14\n and\n \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 50. It is argued that in a country like India where\n there is so much poverty and unemployment and there\n is no equality of bargaining power, the action of the\n State in not making the employees permanent, would\n be violative of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. But the\n very argument indicates that there are so many waiting\n for employment and an equal opportunity for competing\n for employment and it is in that context that the\n Constitution as one of its basic features, has included\n \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n309\n so as to ensure that public\n employment is given only in a fair and equitable\n manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\n opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\n upholding rights under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a\n set of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\n of people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\n State employment. The acceptance of the argument on\n behalf of the respondents would really negate the rights\n of the others conferred by \nArticle 21\n of the\n Constitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold\n that the right to employment is also a right coming\n within the purview of \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution. The\n\n 63\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n argument that \nArticle 23\n of the Constitution is breached\n because the employment on daily wages amounts to\n forced labour, cannot be accepted. After all, the\n employees accepted the employment at their own\n volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their\n employment. The Governments also revised the\n minimum wages payable from time to time in the light\n of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us that\n importing of these theories to defeat the basic\n requirement of public employment would defeat the\n constitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of\n equality.”\n\n 62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to the rule\n\n of equality in public employment is a basic feature of our\n\n Constitution when it is clarified that adherence to the rule of\n\n equality in public employment is a basic feature of the Constitution,\n\n certainly, no person can deviate the principles in this regard and\n\n therefore, appointment in accordance with the recruitment rules in\n\n force by the competent authorities is the constitutional mandate\n\n and any deviation to be construed as violation of the constitutional\n\n principles. It is observed that if it is a contractual appointment, the\n\n appointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were\n\n an engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\n\n 64\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n same would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly\n\n temporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the\n\n expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\n\n merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is\n\n continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would\n\n not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made\n\n appointment, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the\n\n original appointment was not made by following a due process of\n\n selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n 63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment\n\n at the instance of temporary employees whose period of\n\n employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the\n\n very nature of their appointment do not acquire any right. The\n\n High Courts acting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution, should\n\n not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularization, or\n\n permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made\n\n regularly and in terms of constitutional scheme.\n\n 64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the facts and\n\n circumstances of the present writ petition on hand. In the present\n\n writ petition, the writ petitioners were appointed on daily wage\n\n 65\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n basis as Nominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere continuance\n\n or the length of service rendered alone cannot be a ground for\n\n granting the relief of regularization. Thus, the very legal principles\n\n settled by the Constitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts and\n\n circumstances of the present writ petition. Further, the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India deals with the “litigious employment”. Of\n\n course, the situation does not arise in the present case. The\n\n interim order of Status Quo granted by this Court has not been\n\n properly implemented by reinstating the petitioners in service and\n\n the Contempt petition filed by the writ petitioners were also posted\n\n along with the writ petition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of\n\n “litigious employment” would not arise in respect of the present\n\n writ petition. Therefore, the petitioners have not continued in\n\n service by virtue of the interim order of Status Quo granted by this\n\n Court. However, their services were ousted, after filing of the writ\n\n petition.\n\n 65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment deals\n\n with the concept of “equal pay for equal work”. Thus, it may not be\n\n required to elaborate the paragraph as far as the present case on\n\n hand is concerned.\n\n 66\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states that the\n\n Apex Court of India held that, while directing that appointments,\n\n temporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\n\n are swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for\n\n some time and in some cases for a considerable length of time. It is\n\n not as if the person who accepts an engagement either temporary\n\n or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment.\n\n He accepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true that he\n\n is not in a position to bargain- not at arm's length – Since he might\n\n have been searching for some employment so as to eke out his\n\n livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone,\n\n it would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of\n\n appointment and to take the view that a person who has\n\n temporarily or casually got employed should be directed to be\n\n continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\n\n mode of public appointment which is not permissible. A total\n\n embargo of such casual or temporary employment is not possible,\n\n given the exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only\n\n mean that some people who at least get employment temporarily,\n\n contractually or casually, would not be getting even that\n\n employment when securing of such employment brings at least\n\n some succour to them.\n\n 67\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in\n\n search of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual\n\n or temporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\n\n employment. It is in this context that one has to proceed on the\n\n basis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature\n\n of it and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\n\n while accepting the employment, the person concerned knows the\n\n nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the\n\n real sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\n\n which he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post\n\n cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude, so as to enable the\n\n giving up of the procedure established, for making regular\n\n appointments to available posts in the services of the State.\n\n 68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment,\n\n their Lordships held that the invocation of the doctrine of\n\n legitimate expectation cannot enable the employees to claim that\n\n they must be made permanent or they must be regularised in the\n\n service though they had not been selected in terms of the rules for\n\n appointment. The fact that in certain cases the court had directed\n\n regularization of the employees involved in those cases cannot be\n\n 68\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n made use of, to found a claim based on legitimate expectation. The\n\n argument if accepted would also run counter to the constitutional\n\n mandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n 69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\n\n enumerates that when a person enters a temporary employment or\n\n gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the\n\n engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognised by the\n\n relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\n\n appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature.\n\n Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation\n\n for being confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post\n\n could be made only by following a proper procedure for selection\n\n and in cases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service\n\n Commission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation\n\n cannot be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or\n\n casual employees.\n\n 70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi Case” Judgment, the\n\n Constitution Bench considered the right of the employees thus\n\n appointed, under \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution, are\n\n violated. Even in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the\n\n 69\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Supreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages in the\n\n department concerned on a daily wage that was made known to\n\n them. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being\n\n paid. Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by\n\n themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as\n\n against those who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the\n\n relevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on daily\n\n wages to claim that such employee should be treated on par with a\n\n regularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment,\n\n even assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming\n\n equal wages for equal work. There is no fundamental right for\n\n those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on\n\n contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in\n\n service. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be\n\n holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only\n\n by making appointments consistent with the requirements of\n\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n 71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law compels\n\n the State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution\n\n and in the manner we have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India in the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the\n\n 70\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Court is approached by way of a writ, the Court has necessarily to\n\n ask itself whether the person before it had any legal right to be\n\n enforced. Even, the Constitution Bench dealt with the \nArticle 21\n of\n\n the Constitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is so\n\n much poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of\n\n bargaining power, the action of the State in not making the\n\n employees permanent, would be violative of \nArticle 21\n of the\n\n Constitution. But the very argument indicates that there are so\n\n many waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\n\n competing for employment and it is in that context, the Constitution\n\n as one of its basic features, has included Articles 14,16 and 309 so\n\n as to ensure that public employment is given only in a fair and\n\n equitable manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\n\n opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding rights\n\n under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution, a set of persons cannot be\n\n preferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\n\n to compete for State employment.\n\n 72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph urged by\n\n the learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the\n\n Judgment of “Umadevi Case”.\n\n 71\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Paragraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n “53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may\n be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\n appointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa\n [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\n Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\n and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15\n above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\n vacant posts might have been made and the employees\n have continued to work for ten years or more but\n without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\n tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\n of such employees may have to be considered on merits\n in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the\n cases abovereferred to and in the light of this\n judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State\n Governments and their instrumentalities should take\n steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services\n of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten\n years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\n cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should\n further ensure that regular recruitments are\n undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that\n require to be filled up, in cases where temporary\n employees or daily wagers are being now employed.\n The process must be set in motion within six months\n\n 72\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any\n already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened\n based on this judgment, but there should be no further\n bypassing of the constitutional requirement and\n regularising or making permanent, those not duly\n appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n 73. The above said paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\n is a one time relief, of Course, granted by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India to mitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the\n\n temporary employees. Now, the question arises how long the\n\n benefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended to the\n\n employees and what is the interpretation of the subsequent\n\n judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in respect of\n\n paragraph (53) of the judgment of the Constitution Bench.\n\n 74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India, while stopping the entire irregular appointments\n\n and back door appointments had taken note of the fact that certain\n\n reliefs are required in respect of the employees who are already\n\n regularized or in respect of those persons, a proposal is already\n\n kept pending. Certainly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have\n\n never intended to grant the relief of regularization or permanent\n\n 73\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n absorption in public employment contrary to the legal principles\n\n settled in earlier paragraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the\n\n judgment has to be understood harmoniously and together with the\n\n legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench in earlier\n\n paragraphs.\n\n 75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that\n\n paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment cannot be\n\n treated as an isolation and it should be considered along with the\n\n other legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping in\n\n mind, the legal principles settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India in earlier paragraphs, this Court is of the opinion that one\n\n time relief granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be\n\n extended in its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel\n\n beyond the scope of the intention expressed by the Constitution\n\n Bench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n \n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment\n\n of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of \nU.P.State\n\n Electricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n,\n\n reported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\n\n judgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n 74\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon\n the decision of this Court in \nSecy., State of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n and has urged that no direction for regularisation can\n be given by the Court. In our opinion, the decision in\n Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n 753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision cannot\n be applied to a case where regularisation has been\n sought for in pursuance of \nArticle 14\n of the\n Constitution.”\n\n 77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\n\n distinguished that case with the “Umadevi Case”. The very\n\n language used in Paragraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the\n\n decision in “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The said\n\n decision cannot be applied to a case where regularization has been\n\n sought for in pursuance of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. However,\n\n this Court is of the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished\n\n the “Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and circumstances that\n\n the case. When their Lordships have distinguished that case, this\n\n Court is of the opinion that the legal principles settled in\n\n “Umadevi Case” has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two Judges\n\n Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, as it is a “binding\n\n precedent” as stated by this Court in earlier paragraphs.\n\n 75\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding precedent” and when\n\n the case was distinguished from “Umadevi Case” on factual\n\n circumstances, the same cannot be applied in the present case\n\n before this Court.\n\n 79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal and\n\n another Vs. Prantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik\n\n Mahaparishad, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the\n\n relevant paragraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the\n\n petitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n “5. A writ petition was filed before the\n Uttaranchal High Court which was dismissed by the\n impugned order. The High Court was of the view that\n all the 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily\n wages for more than six years and had completed 240\n days in each calendar year and they ought to be\n regularised. Accordingly, the writ petition was\n dismissed.”\n\n 80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this Court is of\n\n the opinion that the case relates to an award passed by the Labour\n\n Court and an Award passed by the Labour Court under the\n\n 76\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance\n\n in respect of the Government employments made by virtue of the\n\n rules framed by the State in this regard. However, the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India in that case, remanded the matter back for\n\n reconsideration by the High Court in the light of the legal\n\n principles settled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects,\n\n the case cannot have any application in respect of the facts and\n\n circumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n \n81. It has further cited the case of \nState of Karnataka and\n\n Others Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n, reported in (2010) 9 SCC\n\n 247 and the relevant paragraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n “7. It is evident from the above that there is an\n exception to the general principles against\n “regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\n SCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n (i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\n years or more in duly sanctioned post without the\n benefit or protection of the interim order of any court\n or tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\n instrumentality should have employed the employee\n and continued him in service voluntarily and\n continuously for more than ten years.\n\n 77\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n (ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\n illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\n not made or continued against sanctioned posts or\n where the persons appointed do not possess the\n prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\n will be considered to be illegal. But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n 82. In \nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved out in\n\n relation to the one time relief granted in paragraph (15) of the\n\n “Umadevi Case”.\n\n 83. In the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs. Daya\n\n Lal and Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant\n\n paragraph (12), enumerates the settled principles in respect of\n\n regularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context of the case\n\n and those principles carved out in paragraph (12) of the above\n\n judgment are akin to that of the legal principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n 78\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n \n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the\n\n attention of this Court relying the case decided by the Hon'ble Two\n\n Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\n \nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\n\n reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph (31) and (33)\n\n of the judgments are extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\n process of selection adopted in identifying the\n appellants herein cannot be said to be unreasonable or\n arbitrary in the sense that it was devised to eliminate\n other eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note\n that in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,\n this Court was dealing with appointments made without\n following any rational procedure in the lower rungs of\n various services of the Union and the States.\n\n 33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the need\n to employ a certain number of people for discharging a\n particular responsibility of the State under the\n Constitution is always with the executive government of\n the day subject to the overall control of the legislature.\n\n That does not mean that an examination by a\n constitutional court regarding the accuracy of the\n assessment of the need is barred.”\n\n 79\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of an\n\n undoubted opinion that there is a slight deviation in respect of the\n\n legal principles carved out by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in\n\n “Umadevi Case”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\n\n by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of “Umadevi Case”.\n\n To reiterate the language used by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India emphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also\n\n occasions to issue directions which could not be said to be\n\n consisted by the public employment. Such directions are issued\n\n presumably on the basis of equitable consideration or\n\n individualization of justice. The question arises, equity to whom?\n\n Equity for the handful of people who have approached the Court\n\n with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this Country\n\n seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for competing\n\n for employment?\n\n 86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi Case” judgment,\n\n again the Constitution Bench reiterated that “It is also clarified that\n\n those decisions which run counter to the principle settled in this\n\n decision, or in which directions running counter to what we have\n\n held herein, will stand denuded of their status as precedents.”\n\n 80\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n \n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the judgment\n\n cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of \nNihal\n\n Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n, reported in\n\n (2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their status\n\n as precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to consider and\n\n follow the same.\n\n 88. \nIn the case of \nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and\n\n others Vs. State of Orissa and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\n\n SCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of\n\n India held that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\n\n judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted regularisation\n of regular appointments and not illegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the appointments in the\n instant case could be described as illegal and if they\n were not, whether the State could be directed to\n regularise the services of the degree-holder Junior\n Engineers who have worked as ad hoc Assistant\n Engineers for such a long period, not only on the\n analogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation\n\n 81\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n but also on the principle underlying para 53 of the\n decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n \n43.As to what would constitute an irregular\n appointment is no longer res integra. The decision of\n this Court in \nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n [(2010) 9\n SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has examined that\n question and explained the principle regarding\n regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case [\nState\n of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\n SCC (L&S) 753] . The decision \nin that case\n summed up\n the following three essentials for regularisation: (1) the\n employees have worked for ten years or more, (2) that\n they have so worked in a duly sanctioned post without\n the benefit or protection of the interim order of any\n court or tribunal, and (3) they should have possessed\n the minimum qualification stipulated for the\n appointment. Subject to these three requirements being\n satisfied, even if the appointment process did not\n involve open competitive selection, the appointment\n would be treated irregular and not illegal and thereby\n qualify for regularisation.\n \nPara 7 in this regard is\n apposite and may be extracted at this stage: (\nM.L.\n Kesari\n case [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n 826] , SCC p. 250)\n\n “7.\n \nIt is evident from the above that there is an\n exception to the general principles against\n ‘regularisation’ enunciated in \nUmadevi (3) [State of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n\n 82\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n (L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n (i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\n years or more in a duly sanctioned post without the\n benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or\n tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\n instrumentality should have employed the employee and\n continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\n for more than ten years.\n\n (ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\n illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\n not made or continued against sanctioned posts or\n where the persons appointed do not possess the\n prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\n will be considered to be illegal. But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n \n89. It is important to cite the case of \nSECRETARY TO\n\n GOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION\n\n DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.\n\n [ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. In paragraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court has observed as follows:\n\n 83\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “8.this Court in \nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal &\n Ors.\n, AIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of\n regularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in\n all possible eventualities and laid down well-settled\n principles relating to regularisation and parity in pay\n relevant in the context of the issues involved therein.\n The same are as under:\n\n “(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\n \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution will not issue\n directions for regularisation, absorption or\n permanent continuance, unless the employees\n claiming regularisation had been appointed in\n pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n accordance with relevant rules in an open\n competitive process, against sanctioned vacant\n posts. The equality clause contained in \nArticles\n 14\n and \n16\n should be scrupulously followed and\n Courts should not issue a direction for\n regularisation of services of an employee which\n would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\n While something that is irregular for want of\n compliance with one of the elements in the\n process of selection which does not go to the\n root of the process, can be regularised, back\n door entries, appointments contrary to the\n constitutional scheme and/or appointment of\n ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n (ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary\n or ad hoc or daily-wage employee, under cover\n of some interim orders of the court, would not\n confer upon him any right to be absorbed into\n service, as such service would be “litigious\n employment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily-\n wage service for a long number of years, let\n alone service for one or two years, will not\n entitle such employee to claim regularisation, if\n he is not working against a sanctioned post.\n Sympathy and sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be\n grounds for passing any order of regularisation\n in the absence of a legal right.\n\n (iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\n regularisation with a cut-off date (that is a\n\n 84\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n scheme providing that persons who had put in a\n specified number of years of service and\n continuing in employment as on the cut-off\n date), it is not possible to others who were\n appointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to\n claim or contend that the scheme should be\n applied to them by extending the cut-off date or\n seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes\n providing for successive cut-off dates.\n\n (iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek\n regularisation as they are not working against\n any sanctioned posts. There cannot be a\n direction for absorption, regularisation or\n permanent continuance of part-time temporary\n employees.\n\n (v) Part-time temporary employees in\n government-run institutions cannot claim parity\n in salary with regular employees of the\n Government on the principle of equal pay for\n equal work. Nor can employees in private\n employment, even if serving full time, seek\n parity in salary with government employees.\n The right to claim a particular salary against\n the State must arise under a contract or under\n a statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n \n90. Reiterating the principles \nlaid down in\n the \nCase of\n\n Secretary to Government, School Education Department,\n\n Chennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014)\n\n 4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically ruled\n\n that the High Courts, in exercising power under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\n Constitution of India will not issue directions for regularization,\n\n absorption or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\n\n 85\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n claiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a\n\n regular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\n\n competitive process against sanctioned vacant posts, the equality\n\n clause contained in \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n should be scrupulously\n\n followed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularization\n\n of services of an employee which would be violative of the\n\n Constitutional scheme.\n\n 91. \nIn the case of \nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and\n\n Others\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph (25) & (26)\n\n are extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid\n decisions of this Court. The principle as has been \nlaid\n down in\n \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also\n been applied in relation to the persons who were\n working on daily wages. According to us, the daily\n wagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the\n term “appointment”. They do not hold a post. The\n scheme of alternative appointment framed for regular\n employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\n confer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of\n abolished organisation to such alternative employment.\n\n \n(See \nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n [(2006) 4\n SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in\n\n 86\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n the context of appointment arose by reason of the\n concept of regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3),\n (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position\n continued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on\n daily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\n according to the rules. Usually, the projects in which\n the daily wagers were engaged, having come to an end,\n their appointment is necessarily terminated for want of\n work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers\n of a government concern are not equivalent to that of a\n government servant and his claim to permanency has to\n be adjudged differently.\n\n 26.In these circumstances, in our considered\n opinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter of\n course. It would depend upon the facts of the case\n following the rules and regulations and cannot be\n dehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n 92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the above\n\n two paragraphs are running contrary to the legal principles settled\n\n by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n Thus, the rules \nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the Constitution\n\n Bench to be applied in respect of \nthe above case\n cited.\n\n 87\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 93. \nIn the case of \nMalathi Das and Others, Vs. Suresh\n\n and Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and the relevant\n\n paragraph (13) is extracted hereunder:\n\n \n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is wholly\n unnecessary for us to consider as to whether the cases\n of persons who were awaiting regularisation on the date\n of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is\n required to be dealt with in accordance with the\n conditions stipulated in para 53 of \nUmadevi (3) [State of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n (L&S) 753] inasmuch as the claims of the respondent\n employees can well be decided on principles of parity.\n\nSimilarly placed employees having been regularised by\n the State and in case of some of them such\n regularisation being after the decision in \nUmadevi (3)\n [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n \n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that the stand\n taken by the appellants in refusing regularisation to the\n respondents cannot be countenanced. However, as the\n said stand of the appellants stems from their perception\n and understanding of the decision in \nUmadevi (3) [State\n of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\n SCC (L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for\n contempt but make it clear that the appellants and all\n the other competent authorities of the State will now be\n\n 88\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n obliged and duty-bound to regularise the services of the\n respondents (74 in number) which will now be done\n forthwith and in any case within a period of two months\n from the date of receipt of this order.”\n\n \n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again taken a\n\n deviation in respect of the legal principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n Therefore, such deviation to be held as denuded of their status as\n\n precedent, as \nlaid down in\n paragraph (54) of the Constitution\n\n Bench.\n\n 95. \nIn the case of \nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar and\n\n Others\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India in paragraph (11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n \n“11.Elaborating upon the principles \nlaid down in\n\n Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n 753] and explaining the difference between irregular\n and illegal appointments in \nState of Karnataka v. M.L.\n Kesari\n [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] ,\n this Court held as under: (\nM.L. Kesari\n case [(2010) 9\n SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para\n\n 7)\n “7.

But where the person\n employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\n was working against sanctioned posts, but had been\n selected without undergoing the process of open\n competitive selection, such appointments are\n considered to be irregular.”\n\n 14.Considering the facts and circumstances of\n the case that the appellant has served the University\n for more than 29 years on the post of night guard and\n that he has served the College on daily wages, in the\n interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\n regularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\n w.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post\n as per the direction of the Registrar).\"\n\n 90\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment, the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the appellant has served\n\n in the University for more than 29 years in the post of night guard\n\n and that he has served the College on daily wages, in the interest of\n\n justice, the authorities are directed to regularise the services of the\n\n appellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n 97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India has deviated the principles \nlaid down in\n “Umadevi Case”.\n\n Thus, this Court has to derive an opinion that the decision would be\n\n denuded of its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this\n\n Court has to independently apply the legal principles settled by the\n\n Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n 98. \nIn the case of \nPrem Ram Vs. Managing Director,\n\n Uttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and Others\n,\n\n reported in (2015) 11 SCC 255, undoubtedly, the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India has decided the case based on the facts\n\n and circumstances of the case. However, on a plain reading of the\n\n judgment, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles\n\n settled by the Constitution Bench has not been considered by the\n\n 91\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n Thus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment for the\n\n purpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n 99. \nIn the case of \nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs.\n\n Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Others\n,\n\n reported in (2015) 14 SCC 382, while, the Supreme Court of\n\n India in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n \n“13.Considering the facts of the present case on\n the touchstone \nlaid down in\n Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\n Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n (L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division Bench was\n not right in setting aside the appointment of the\n appellants. More so, it was nobody's case challenging\n the appointment of the appellants. Admittedly, the\n appellants were engaged as contractual employees\n from 1994 and have completed more than ten years of\n continuous service with Respondent 1. They continued\n in service not by the orders of the Court/Tribunal, but\n by the decision of the respondents. The appellants were\n regularised as per the policy decision dated 16-4-2003\n taken by Respondent 1 and approved by the State\n Government vide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the\n appointment of the appellants were made pursuant to\n the policy of regularisation, the High Court was not\n right in quashing the appointment of the appellants as\n\n 92\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n the same were never in question before the High Court.\n The plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\n seek regularisation with retrospective effect from\n 20-11-2002 and the consequential seniority.”\n\n \n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken note of the one time\n\n benefit granted by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the\n\n Judgment in “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles\n\n settled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and 54 of the\n\n judgment has not been considered by their Lordships. Since the\n\n legal principles enunciated in the above paragraphs of the\n\n Constitution Bench has not been considered and the case was\n\n decided based on the particular facts and circumstances of the\n\n case, this Court is not bound to consider it as a “binding precedent”\n\n as enumerated in the first portion of this Judgment. This Court has\n\n earlier considered the nature of the “binding precedents” and the\n\n interpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by the\n\n Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\n recent case of \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and\n\n Others\n, reported in [JT 2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n 93\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to find out\n\n that those cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India were decided based on certain facts and\n\n circumstances of the case. However, all those circumstances and\n\n the legal principles were well settled by the Constitution Bench in\n\n “Umadevi Case”. Various paragraphs of the Constitution Bench\n\n judgment as discussed above made it very clear that all the\n\n circumstances arisen out of the temporary/casual/daily wages\n\n employees were dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided.\n\n This being the factum of the case, this Court is not inclined to\n\n follow the above judgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as a “binding precedent” and this\n\n Court is bound by the legal principles settled by the Constitution\n\n Bench in “Umadevi Case” which remains as the law of the land\n\n under \nArticle 141\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n \n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of the\n\n Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n\n in the case of \nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board Vs.\n\n Ranjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n 491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n 94\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “17.A combined reading of the aforementioned\n paragraphs would clearly indicate that what the\n Constitution Bench had in mind in directing\n regularisation was in relation to such appointments,\n which were irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n \n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is\n explicit. It has been so pointed out in \nNational\n Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n [(2006) 5 SCC 493 :\n\n 2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC pp.\n 500-01, paras 23-25)\n “23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing on\n behalf of the respondents that the appointments were\n irregular and not illegal, cannot be accepted for more\n than one reason. They were appointed only on the basis\n of their applications. The Recruitment Rules were not\n followed. Even the Selection Committee had not been\n properly constituted. In view of the ban on employment,\n no recruitment was permissible in law. The reservation\n policy adopted by the appellant had not been\n maintained. Even cases of minorities had not been given\n due consideration.\n\n 24.

The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India has dealt with the interpretation of paragraphs 16,\n\n 17, 19 and 22 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17),\n\n (19) and (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n 96\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “16. \nIn \nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n 937] this Court clearly held that the words “regular” or\n “regularisation” do not connote permanence and cannot\n be construed so as to convey an idea of the nature of\n tenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to\n condone any procedural irregularities and are meant to\n cure only such defects as are attributable to\n methodology followed in making the appointments. This\n Court emphasised that when rules framed under \nArticle\n 309\n of the Constitution are in force, no regularisation is\n permissible in exercise of the executive powers of the\n Government under \nArticle 162\n of the Constitution in\n contravention of the rules. These decisions and the\n principles recognised therein have not been dissented\n to by this Court and on principle, we see no reason not\n to accept the proposition as enunciated in the above\n decisions. We have, therefore, to keep this distinction in\n mind and proceed on the basis that only something that\n is irregular for want of compliance with one of the\n elements in the process of selection which does not go\n to the root of the process, can be regularised and that it\n alone can be regularised and granting permanence of\n employment is a totally different concept and cannot be\n equated with regularisation.\n\n 17. We have already indicated the constitutional\n scheme of public employment in this country, and the\n\n 97\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n executive, or for that matter the court, in appropriate\n cases, would have only the right to regularise an\n appointment made after following the due procedure,\n even though a non-fundamental element of that process\n or procedure has not been followed. This right of the\n executive and that of the court would not extend to the\n executive or the court being in a position to direct that\n an appointment made in clear violation of the\n constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made in\n that behalf, can be treated as permanent or can be\n directed to be treated as permanent.\n\n 19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also\n controlled by economic considerations and financial\n implications of any public employment. The viability of\n the department or the instrumentality of the project is\n also of equal concern for the State. The State works out\n the scheme taking into consideration the financial\n implications and the economic aspects. Can the court\n impose on the State a financial burden of this nature by\n insisting on regularisation or permanence in\n employment, when those employed temporarily are not\n needed permanently or regularly? As an example, we\n can envisage a direction to give permanent employment\n to all those who are being temporarily or casually\n employed in a public sector undertaking. The burden\n may become so heavy by such a direction that the\n undertaking itself may collapse under its own weight. It\n is not as if this had not happened. So, the court ought\n not to impose a financial burden on the State by such\n\n 98\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n directions, as such directions may turn\n counterproductive.\n\n \n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question\n whether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme of\n appointment can be approved, was not considered or\n decided. The distinction emphasised in \nR.N.\n Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972)\n 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The Court\n appears to have been dealing with a scheme for “equal\n pay for equal work” and in the process, without an\n actual discussion of the question, had approved a\n scheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously at\n the direction of the Court, to order permanent\n absorption of such daily-rated workers. With respect to\n the learned judges, the decision cannot be said to lay\n down any law, that all those engaged on daily wages,\n casually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or\n vacancy existed and without following the rules of\n selection, should be absorbed or made permanent\n though not at a stretch, but gradually. If that were the\n ratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n 104. \nIn the case of \nPost Master General, Kolkata and\n\n Others Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported in (2007) 5 SCC 317,\n\n paragraphs (5) & (18) are relevant and the same are extracted\n\n hereunder:\n\n 99\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n “5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction,\n although the case of Niva Ghosh was allegedly\n considered, her case was not, whereupon a contempt\n petition was filed. In the said contempt proceedings, a\n stand was taken by the appellant that she had not\n completed a period of 240 days in a year before the said\n cut-off date. The said contempt petition was dismissed\n with liberty to the respondent to file a fresh original\n application. Pursuant to the said observations, the\n respondent filed an application before the Central\n Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which\n was marked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n 18.There are two distinctive features in the\n present case, which are:\n\n (i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot be\n invoked where any illegality has been committed or\n where no legal right is established.\n\n (ii) According to the appellant the respondent having\n completed 240 days, does not fulfil the requisite\n criteria.

State\n\n of Kerala and Others\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610,\n\n wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India interpreted the scope\n\n 100\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n of paragraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (17) &\n\n (18) of \nthe said judgment\n and the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n “17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon the\n observations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC\n 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as under: (SCC p.\n\n \n42, para 53)\n “53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\n cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\n appointments) as explained in \nState of Mysore v. S.V.\n Narayanappa\n [AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] ,\n R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n [(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\n and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n [(1979) 4 SCC\n 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para 15\n above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\n vacant posts might have been made and the employees\n have continued to work for ten years or more but\n without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\n tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\n of such employees may have to be considered on merits\n in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the\n cases abovereferred to and in the light of this judgment.\n In that context, the Union of India, the State\n Governments and their instrumentalities should take\n steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services\n of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten\n years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\n cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should\n further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken\n\n 101\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\n filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily\n wagers are being now employed. The process must be\n set in motion within six months from this date. We also\n clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not\n sub judice, need not be reopened based on this\n judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of\n the constitutional requirement and regularising or\n making permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\n constitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\n\n A case of regularisation which thus attained finality and\n was not sub judice would not come within the purview\n of exception to the rule contained in Para 53 of \nthe said\n judgment\n. The appellants' case, thus, does not come\n within the purview thereof. Only those cases where\n regularisations had already been made were not to be\n reopened. It is not in dispute that services of the\n appellants were terminated as far back as in 1987 and\n they did not question the legality or validity of the said\n order.\n \nIt is only after the decision of this Court in \nJacob\n\n case [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15\n ATC 697] that representations were filed. Such\n representations were rejected both by the Kerala Water\n Authority as also the State of Kerala.\n\n \n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither in\n law nor in equity were entitled to be reinstated in\n service. The decision of this Court in \nJacob\n case [(1991)\n 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15 ATC 697]\n being not applicable to the case of the appellants, we\n\n 102\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n are bound by the \nratio \nlaid down in\n Umadevi [(2006) 4\n SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So far as Para 53 of the\n judgment of the Constitution Bench in the said case is\n concerned, the same has been considered by this Court\n in a large number of decisions.\n \nIn \nPunjab Water Supply\n & Sewerage Board v. Ranjodh Singh\n [(2007) 2 SCC\n 491 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498,\n para 15)\n\n “15.\n \nThe question came up for consideration before a\n Constitution Bench of this Court in \nState of Karnataka v.\n Umadevi\n (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n wherein it was held that no person who was temporarily\n or casually been employed could be directed to be\n continued permanently.\n \nIt was opined that by doing so it\n would be creating another mode of public employment\n which is not permissible.”\n\n [See \nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn.\n Ltd.\n [(2006) 6 SCC 310 : 2006 \nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State\n of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n [(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (\n2007)\n 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master General v. Tutu Das\n (Dutta\n) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 179] .]”\n\n 106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the judgment,\n\n is well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court of India as cited above, this Court is not inclined to\n\n consider the other judgments referred by the learned counsel for\n\n 103\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n the petitioner. However, on a perusal of all these judgments cited\n\n supra, this Court is of the opinion that ultimately the legal principle\n\n settled in by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is\n\n binding over the subject and the same is to be followed\n\n scrupulously by all the Courts across the country and the same\n\n becomes the law of the land in the matter of regularization,\n\n permanent absorption and appointment.\n\n 107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of the\n\n case on hand, it remains that the writ petitioners were appointed as\n\n daily rated employees for a particular period and, this Court has to\n\n draw an inference that all the Government orders passed\n\n subsequent to the Constitution Bench Judgment, if runs contrary to\n\n the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench, would\n\n become invalid and the same cannot be implemented or followed.\n\n In other words, it is to be noted that the Government has no\n\n authority to issue any orders granting regularization, permanent\n\n absorption or appointment in violation of the Constitutional\n\n schemes and in violation of the recruitment rules in force. The\n\n power of the Government in this regard is certainly abrogated by\n\n the principles settled by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi\n\n Case”. Such being the factum of the case, the State Government is\n\n 104\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n to be precluded as well as its authority are to be regularized in\n\n respect of appointing employees in contravention with the\n\n recruitment rules in force and effecting appointments through back\n\n doors.\n\n 108. This Court has to place on record that the State is\n\n bound to over see the appointments made in this regard illegally or\n\n irregularly by the competent authorities and the same is to be\n\n construed as the fraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\n\n liable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal Rules and\n\n other relevant rules. The State shall be vigilant in this regard and\n\n the authorities indulging in such activities of exercising powers by\n\n issuing illegal or irregular appointments are to be booked under\n\n the Discipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by the\n\n State in this regard, since these all are the Constitutional principles\n\n required for the State to be followed and the State being a modal\n\n employer, has to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\n\n principles scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n 109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in\n\n paragraph (15) of the judgment in “Umadevi Case”, the\n\n Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that\n\n 105\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n a distinction between regularisation and conferment of permanent\n\n status in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This Court is of the\n\n opinion that the conferment of permanent status Act, is a general\n\n law applicable to the employees, in the absence of any special law\n\n governing the particular subject. However, if any such law prevails\n\n and covering the field of appointment of regularisation and\n\n permanent absorption, then the general law would not apply. In\n\n nutshell, the special law and rules will prevail over the general law\n\n and the special rules in force are to be applied in the relevant case.\n\n \n110. The very concept of public employment are elaborately\n\n adjudicated and the principles are \nlaid down in\n \nUmadevi\n case.\n\n This Court is of the considered opinion that all appointments are to\n\n be made strictly in accordance with the Service Rules in force.\n\n Equal opportunity in public employment is the constitutional\n\n mandate. All eligible persons, who are all aspiring to secure public\n\n employment, must be provided with an opportunity to participate in\n\n the open competitive process under the Constitutional scheme and\n\n any violation would result in denial of equal opportunity enunciated\n\n under the Constitution of India. Thus, equality clause being the\n\n Fundamental Right. Public employment cannot be denied to the\n\n meritorious candidates, who are all longing to secure public\n\n 106\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n employment, by participating in the process of selection more so,\n\n by availing the Rules of Reservation. The practice of engaging\n\n temporary employees, allowing them to continue in an irregular\n\n manner and thereafter, granting the benefit of regularization and\n\n permanent absorption is not only in violation of the Constitutional\n\n Principles, but depriving the Fundamental Rights of the citizen of\n\n this great Nation, who are all otherwise meritorious and waiting to\n\n participate in the process of selection.\n\n 111. In the event of large scale back door appointments\n\n undoubtedly, the efficiency level in the public administration would\n\n be diluted. One can easily visualize that in the absence of any\n\n merit selection, the efficiency level cannot be ensured or\n\n maintained. Beyond the deprival of opportunity of public\n\n employment to the meritorious candidates, the efficiency in the\n\n public administration is also contemplated under the Constitutional\n\n Principles. Efficient public administration is mandate. In order to\n\n maintain the efficient Public Administration, the appointments are\n\n to be made by selecting meritorious candidates for public services.\n\n Dilution on the Constitutional Principles would result in disaster\n\n consequences. In the event of lack of efficiency in public\n\n 107\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n administration, the public at large would suffer in respect of\n\n availing the benefits and services of Government schemes and\n\n policies. Once there is a dilution of efficiency level in public\n\n administration, then the Constitutional Principles are thrown on\n\n the wind. Thus, the Courts cannot show any leniency or misplaced\n\n sympathy in the matter of upholding the constitutional mandates,\n\n Philosophy and Ethos. In the event of dilution of these\n\n Constitutional Principles, the efficiency level in public\n\n administration will get affected and consequently, the\n\n administration and implementation of Government schemes will get\n\n affected.\n\n 112. All these aspects are to be borne in mind. It is not as if\n\n Courts can decide certain issues on sympathy or by taking a lenient\n\n view. Such misplaced sympathy or lenient view may result in\n\n denial of social justice to all the citizen of this great Nation. If the\n\n implication of such misplaced sympathy would result in adverse\n\n consequences, then Courts should not prefer to grant relief in such\n\n cases merely based on the length of services or the manner in\n\n which the irregular or illegal appointments are made.\n\n ................. (W.P.No.28633 of 2014...............\n\n 108\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n 113. In the present case, the order impugned states that the\n\n writ petitioners are not satisfying the conditions stipulated in\n\n G.O.Ms.No.74, Personal Administrative Reforms Department, dated\n\n 27.06.2013. Therefore, their claim for regularization is not\n\n feasible.\n\n 114. Even in case they are not satisfying the conditions, this\n\n Court is of the opinion that such Government Orders, which are all\n\n passed and running counter to the principles settled by the\n\n Constitutional Bench cannot be considered as valid Government\n\n Orders. Any Government Orders running counter to the principles\n\n \nlaid down by\n the Constitutional Bench are unconstitutional.\n\n Therefore, the Government is also restrained from granting the\n\n benefit of regularization or permanent absorption through back\n\n door method. It is not as if the Government can take a decision,\n\n which is otherwise not inconsonance with the Constitutional\n\n Principles. Periodically granting regularization in violation of Rules\n\n is impermissible both under the Constitution of India as well as\n\n based on the principles \nlaid down by\n the Constitution Bench.\n\n Therefore, relying on a Government Order Court cannot decide the\n\n matter contrary to the principles \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court\n\n 109\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n\f W.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n of India, more specifically, by the Constitution Bench. Thus, such\n\n Government Orders, which are all running counter to the\n\n principles, cannot be approved by this Court. However, if the\n\n Government Orders are running in consonance with the legal\n\n principles, the said Government Order can be approved for the\n\n purpose of grant of the benefit of regularization or permanent\n\n absorption.\n\n 115. In view of the discussions made above, this Court is of\n\n the opinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for the relief\n\n of regularization or permanent absorption as such sought for in\n\n these writ petitions.\n\n 116. Accordingly, all the writ petitions stand dismissed.\n\n However, there shall be no order as to costs.

In other words, employees who had\n been appointed without following the procedure\n established by law for such appointments. This Court,\n at the threshold, stated that it should individualise\n justice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\n possible to accept the statement, unqualified as it\n appears to be. This Court is not only the constitutional\n court, it is also the highest court in the country, the\n final court of appeal. By virtue of \nArticle 141\n of the\n Constitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the\n land. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its main\n role is to interpret the constitutional and other\n statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\n philosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\n ourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The\n role of the Supreme Court is to render justice according\n to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is"

The employees before\n us were engaged on daily wages in the department\n concerned on a wage that was made known to them.\n There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not\n being paid. Those who are working on daily wages\n formed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\n they are discriminated as against those who have been\n regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\n No right can be founded on an employment on daily\n wages to claim that such employee should be treated on\n a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and made\n permanent in employment, even assuming that the\n principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for\n equal work.
