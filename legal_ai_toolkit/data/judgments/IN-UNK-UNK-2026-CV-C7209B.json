This writ petition has been filed for the following reliefs: -\n\n \"This writ petition has been filed for quashing of the order dated\n 28.06.2018 passed by respondent no. 1 as contained in Memo No.\n 1703 (Annexure-5) and the entire proceedings being case no.\n JHMSEFC 25/2015 New Case No. JH/20/M/00015 on the ground\n that the same is wholly without jurisdiction.\"\n\n 4. The learned counsel for the Respondent No.-2 has submitted\n that the maintainability of the present writ petition challenging\n the award passed by the Respondent No.-1 may be decided as\n\n 2\n\n preliminary issue.\n\nArgument of the petitioners on the point of maintainability of the\nwrit petition\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n impugned award passed by the Respondent No.1 is wholly\n without jurisdiction and accordingly, a nullity in the eyes of\n law and submits that there has been gross violation of\n principles of natural justice while passing the impugned\n award. It is submitted that considering aforesaid two points,\n the present writ petition has been filed.\n\n6. The learned counsel has also submitted that the plea of\n jurisdiction to entertain the claim of the respondent no.2 was\n raised before the Respondent No.-1. During the proceedings,\n still the Respondent No.-1 entertained the claim and rejected\n the point of jurisdiction raised by the petitioners by the\n impugned award. The learned counsel reiterates that as the\n point of jurisdiction is involved in this case, therefore, the writ\n petition is maintainable.\n\n7. The learned counsel has referred to following judgements: -\n\n \ni. Judgment in the case of \nWhirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar\n of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others\n reported in (1998) 8\n SCC 1(Para-14 and 15 ) to submit that it has been held by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court that alternative remedy\n does not to operate as a bar to writ petition in at least\n three contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has\n been filed for the enforcement of any of the\n Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation\n of the principle of natural justice or where the order or\n proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the\n validity of an Act is challenged.\n\n \nii. Judgment reported in (2017) 8 SCC 830 (\nS.N.D.P.\n Sakhayogam vs. Kerala Atmavidya Sangham and Others\n)\n (Para-16 and 17) to submit that the issue of jurisdiction,\n\n 3\n\n which goes to the root of the case, if found involved, has\n to be tried at any stage of the proceedings, once brought\n to the notice of the Court.\n\niii. Judgment reported in 2019 (4) JCR 243 (Jhr.) [State Project\n Director, through Uma Shankar Singh versus M/s. Raj\n Enterprises, Nainital (Uttarakhand)] to submit that it has\n been held by this Court that a writ petition under \nArticle\n 227\n of the Constitution of India is maintainable against\n the order passed by the commercial court, but the\n Courts would be slow in entertaining such writ petition\n considering the object of the \nCommercial Courts Act,\n 2015\n.\n\niv. Judgment passed by this court being W.P. (C) No. 6378\n of 2014 dated 14.06.2018 wherein it has been held that\n power of the High Court under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution of India is plenary in nature and\n involvement of contractual dispute or availability of\n alternative remedy cannot, ipso-facto, be a ground for\n dismissal of a writ petition. It has been held that public\n law element was involved in the said case, and it has\n been held that the respondent of the said case was\n required to act fairly and reasonably and has also been\n held that arbitrariness in State action can be examined\n under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India.\n v. Judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n reported in (2018) 13 SCC 462 (\nBank of India vs. Yadav\n Consultancy Services Private Limited and another\n)\n (Paragraph No. 13 and 14) to submit that in the said case,\n the concerned High Court did not decide the point of\n jurisdiction and accordingly, the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court held that the order of the High Court suffered\n from serious infirmity and was liable to be set aside.\n\n 4\n\n Learned counsel submits that the said case before the\n Hon'ble Supreme Court also arose out of a case under\n \nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development\n Act, 2006\n (hereinafter '\nMSMED Act\n') and accordingly,\n the point regarding lack of jurisdiction of Respondent\n No. 1 having been raised in the present case, it is the\n duty of this court to consider and decide such point.\n\nArgument of Respondent No. 2\n\n8. Learned counsel on behalf of the respondent No. 2 on the other\n hand, has relied upon following judgements: -\n\n a. Judgment passed by this court in W.P. (C) No. 6 of 2002\n dated 3.3.2006 (paragraph no. 9) to submit that the present\n writ petition has been filed challenging the award and\n there is no dispute that the impugned award is\n governed by the provisions of \nArbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996\n (hereinafter referred to as the Act\n of 1996) and appropriate remedy to challenge the award\n is under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n Act, 1996. He submits that this court, in paragraph 9 of\n \nthe said judgment\n, has held that in view of the Scheme\n of the Act of 1996, and particularly the spirit of \nSection 5\n\n thereof, there was no reason for the writ court to\n exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to entertain the\n challenge to the award on the grounds which were\n urged in the said case.\n\n \nb. Judgment reported in (2003) 5 SCC 399 (para 13 ) (\nSeth\n Chand Ratan versus Pandit Durga Prasad and others\n) to\n submit that the statutory remedies which are provided\n under the statute cannot be bypassed to take recourse to\n proceeding under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the\n Constitution of India and such a course of action may\n enable a litigant to defeat the provisions of the statute\n\n 5\n\n which may provide for certain conditions for filing the\n appeal, like limitation, payment of court fees or deposit\n of some amount or fulfilment of some other conditions\n for entertaining the appeal. Learned counsel submits\n that as per the provisions of the \nMSMED Act\n, there is\n condition of pre-deposit to the extent of 75% of the\n award for challenging the same and in the instant case,\n the petitioner cannot be permitted to by-pass the\n statutory remedies and pre-deposit and challenge the\n award under \nArticle 226\n and \n227\n of the Constitution of\n India.\n\n c. The learned counsel for the respondent has also referred\n to a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (SBP and CO Limited versus\n Patel Engineering Limited and another) para 45 and\n judgment reported in (2010) 8 SCC 110, para 44,to submit\n that the present writ petition is not maintainable against\n an award.\n\n9. Learned counsel referred to the impugned award to submit\n that the point of jurisdiction has been decided by the\n respondent no. 1. He further refers to \nSection 16\n of the\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to submit that the plea,\n that the arbitral tribunal does not have the jurisdiction, has to\n be raised before the Arbitral Tribunal itself and the same once\n decided by the Arbitral Tribunal can be challenged under\n \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. He\n submits that the point of jurisdiction and other points which\n were raised and considered by the respondent no. 1 while\n passing the award could have been challenged by the\n petitioner under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n Act, 1996 which has to be filed within the stipulated time\n frame and has limited scope for interference against the\n\n 6\n\n arbitral award. Learned counsel has also submitted that the\n subject matter of dispute was within the jurisdiction of the\n respondent no. 1 and it cannot be said that the award suffers\n from patent lack of jurisdiction. The learned counsel hastens to\n add that the jurisdiction once decided in terms of \nSection 16\n of\n the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, whatever be its\n nature, can be raised only by way of objection under \nSection 34\n\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n10. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions regarding the\n proper remedy under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996, learned counsel also submits that the\n present case cannot be said to be a case of patent lack of\n jurisdiction, in as much as, in order to examine the jurisdiction\n of the respondent no. 1 the records as well as other plea of the\n parties is required to be examined requiring appreciation of\n materials on record and legality of the arbitral award on\n merits.\n\nRejoinder Argument of the petitioners\n\n11. In response, Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n petitioners submits that there is no dispute that the arbitration\n award passed by the respondent no. 1 could have been\n challenged under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996, but this by itself does not ousted the\n jurisdiction of this court to entertain challenge to the\n impugned award under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of\n India particularly when a plea of jurisdiction and gross\n violation of principles of natural justice while passing the\n impugned award are grounds of challenge. The learned\n counsel has also referred to the judgment which has been\n relied upon by the respondent passed in W.P. (C) No. 6 of\n 2002, and he refers to paragraph 7 thereof to submit that this\n court, while considering the challenge to another award\n\n 7\n\n passed by the Respondent No. 1, refused to entertain the writ\n petition as it was not the case that the reference itself was not\n maintainable and the supplier was not an enterprises covered\n under the provisions of \nMSMED Act, 2006\n. The learned\n counsel for the petitioners submits that the aforesaid grounds\n are the points of challenge in the present case and therefore the\n writ petition is maintainable and accordingly the said\n judgment which has been relied upon by the respondent No. 2\n is actually in favour of the writ petitioners.\nFindings of the Court\n\n12. After hearing the learned counsels for the parties, this court\n finds that there is no dispute that the impugned arbitration\n award in the present case is dated 28.06.2018 which has been\n challenged before this Court by filing the present writ petition\n on 12.09.2018. The notices were issued to the respondent no. 2\n vide order dated 04.10.2018 and the respondent no. 2 appeared\n by filing a Vakalatnama.\n\n13. After hearing counsel for the parties and after going through\n the materials on record, this court finds that the present\n petitioners had raised the plea before the respondent no. 1\n challenging the maintainability of the case filed by the\n Respondent No. 2. It was also pleaded that the claimant is not\n covered within the definition of supplier as defined under\n \nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006\n\n and that the claimant became a supplier within the meaning of\n the said Act of 2006 w.e.f. 26.03.2015 and accordingly, the\n claimant could not claim benefit under the Act for supply of\n services rendered by it before 26.03.2015. It was also the case of\n the petitioners before the respondent no. 1 that the claim itself\n was barred by limitation. The aforesaid plea was objected by\n the respondent no.2 in the proceedings before the respondent\n no.1. The respondent no. 1 decided the aforesaid points vide\n\n 8\n\n another order dated 25.05.2018 and has been recorded in the\n impugned award. Upon going through the impugned award,\n this court finds that the point of jurisdiction was raised and\n argued by the parties and was decided on 25.05.2018 by citing\n reasons.\n\n14. This Court finds that in the judgment passed by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in the case reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (\nS.B.P.\n and Company vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Another\n), it has been\n held in paragraph 45 and 46 as under:-\n\n 45. It is seen that some High Courts have proceeded on the basis that\n any order passed by an Arbitral Tribunal during arbitration, would be\n capable of being challenged under \nArticle 226\n or 227 of the\n Constitution. We see no warrant for such an approach. \nSection 37\n\n makes certain orders of the Arbitral Tribunal appealable. Under \nSection\n 34\n, the aggrieved party has an avenue for ventilating its grievances\n against the award including any in-between orders that might have been\n passed by the Arbitral Tribunal acting under \nSection 16\n of the Act. The\n party aggrieved by any order of the Arbitral Tribunal, unless has a right\n of appeal under \nSection 37\n of the Act, has to wait until the award is\n passed by the Tribunal. This appears to be the scheme of the Act. The\n Arbitral Tribunal is, after all, a creature of a contract between the\n parties, the arbitration agreement, even though, if the occasion arises,\n the Chief Justice may constitute it based on the contract between the\n parties. But that would not alter the status of the Arbitral Tribunal. It\n will still be a forum chosen by the parties by agreement. We, therefore,\n disapprove of the stand adopted by some of the High Courts that any\n order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is capable of being corrected by the\n High Court under \nArticle 226\n or 227 of the Constitution. Such an\n intervention by the High Courts is not permissible.\n\n 46. The object of minimising judicial intervention while the matter is in\n the process of being arbitrated upon, will certainly be defeated if the\n High Court could be approached under \nArticle 227\n or under \nArticle 226\n\n of the Constitution against every order made by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n Therefore, it is necessary to indicate that once the arbitration has\n commenced in the Arbitral Tribunal, parties have to wait until the\n award is pronounced unless, of course, a right of appeal is available to\n them under \nSection 37\n of the Act even at an earlier stage.\n\n15. There is no dispute that objection to jurisdiction can be raised\n under \nsection 16\n of the aforesaid Act of 1996 and has been\n raised in the present case before the Respondent no.1 and has\n been decided vide order dated 25.05.2018 against the present\n petitioners. Applying the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (supra), such decision on\n the point of jurisdiction is also subject to challenge under\n\n 9\n\nSection 34\n and also under \nSection 37\n of the said Act of 1996\n once the final award is passed. In the present case,\n appreciation of facts and law would be required for the\n purpose of deciding the jurisdiction of the respondent no. 1.\n There is no dispute, even from the side of the petitioners that\n the application for setting aside the award under \nSection 34\n of\n the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is maintainable\n before the competent court, even on the point of jurisdiction.\n\n16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in (2003)\n 5 SCC 399 (Seth Chandra Pd. Versus Pandit Durga Prasad) at\n Paragraph No. 13 has categorically held that the litigant cannot\n be permitted to defeat the provisions of the Statute which may\n provide for certain conditions for filing of appeal, like\n limitation, payment of court fee or deposit of some amount or\n fulfilment of some other conditions for entertaining the appeal\n and they may not be permitted to bypass the said remedy to\n take recourse to proceeding under \nArticle 226\n and \n227\n of the\n Constitution of India. Paragraph No. 13 of the aforesaid\n judgment is quoted hereunder for ready reference.\n\n Para-13. Even otherwise, the view taken by the Division Bench of the\n High Court for repelling the objection of the appellant regarding the\n maintainability of the writ petition that an alternative remedy does not\n divest the High Court of its powers to entertain petitions under \nArticles\n 226\n and \n227\n of the Constitution, has hardly any application on the facts\n of the present case. It has been settled by a long catena of decisions that\n when a right or liability is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the\n remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be\n had to that particular statutory remedy before seeking the discretionary\n remedy under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of\n statutory remedies is no doubt a rule of policy, convenience and\n discretion and the court may in exceptional cases issue a discretionary\n writ of certiorari. Where there is complete lack of jurisdiction for the\n officer or authority or tribunal to take action or there has been a\n contravention of fundamental rights or there has been a violation of rules\n of natural justice or where the Tribunal acted under a provision of law,\n which is ultra vires, then notwithstanding the existence of an alternative\n remedy, the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief. In the\n present case, the alternative remedy of challenging the judgment of the\n court was not before some other forum or tribunal. On the contrary, by\n virtue of sub-section (3) of \nSection 27\n of the Act, the order passed by the\n court amounted to a decree against which an appeal lay to the High\n Court. When the party had statutory remedy of assailing the order passed\n by the District Court by filing an appeal to the High Court itself, he could\n\n 10\n\n not bypass the said remedy and take recourse to proceedings under\n \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the Constitution. Such a course of action may\n enable a litigant to defeat the provisions of the statute which may provide\n for certain conditions for filing the appeal, like limitation, payment of\n court fee or deposit of some amount or fulfilment of some other conditions\n for entertaining the appeal.\n\n17. So far as the judgement relied upon by the petitioners in the\n case of \nWhirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks,\n Mumbai and Others\n reported in (1998) 8 SCC 1 is concerned, it\n has been clearly held in Para 15 that under \nArticle 226\n of the\n constitution , the High Court, having regard to the facts of the\n case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ\n petition, but the High Court has imposed upon itself certain\n restrictions, one of which is that if an efficacious remedy is\n available, the High Court would not normally exercise its\n jurisdiction. In this background, it has been held that the\n alternative remedy would not be a bar at least in three\n contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed\n for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where\n there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or\n where the order or proceedings are wholly without\n jurisdiction or the validity of an Act is challenged. Thus, it is\n clear that while entertaining the writ petition also, the court\n has to exercise sound discretion based on the facts of the cases\n as well as the statutory scheme dealing with the matter and it\n cannot be said that merely because a point of jurisdiction is\n involved, the writ petition has to be necessarily involved. In\n the said judgement the Hon'ble Supreme court has referred to\n judgement passed in the case of Rashid Ahmed -versus-\n Municipal Board reported in AIR 1950 SC 163 and held in\n Para 16 as follows:-\n\n \n16.\" \nRashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board\n. Kairana laid down that\n existence of an adequate legal remedy was a factor to be taken into\n consideration in the matter of granting writs.\n \nThis was followed by\n \nanother Rashid\n case, namely \nK.S. Rashid & Son v. Income Tax\n\n 11\n\n Investigation Commission\n which reiterated the above proposition and\n held that where alternative remedy existed, it would be a sound\n exercise of discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Article\n\n 226. This proposition was; however, qualified by the significant\n words, \" unless there are good grounds therefor\" which indicated that\n alternative remedy would not operate as an absolute bar and that writ\n petition under \nArticle 226\n could still be entertained in exceptional\n circumstances.\"\n\n This court finds that in the aforesaid judgement, the show\n cause notice itself was challenged and the same was ultimately\n quashed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by holding that the\n Registrar could not have legally issued suo-motu notice under\n \nSection 56(4)\n of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958\n for cancellation of certificates of registration/renewal already\n granted.\n\n The facts in the present case is totally different. The\n jurisdictional issue was raised and contested before the arbitral\n tribunal and decided by a reasoned order and subsequently\n final award was passed which is under challenge in this writ\n petition. In such circumstances, this court is not inclined to\n exercise powers under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of\n India as such exercise of power would be against the very\n scheme of the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n and the\n issue involves appreciation of the facts of the case.\n\n18. The Judgment, relied upon by the petitioners, reported in\n (2017) 8 SCC 830 (\nS.N.D.P. Sakhayogam vs. Kerala Atmavidya\n Sangham and Others\n) arose out of suit filed in the civil court and\n the impugned judgement was the judgement passed by the\n concerned High Court in second appeal. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court considering the point of jurisdiction involved, which\n was not taken note of the concerned courts, remanded the\n matter to the trial court for disposal of the suit afresh. This\n judgement does not help the petitioners in any manner as the\n\n 12\n\n issue of jurisdiction was raised and contested by the parties\n before the respondent no. 1 and it was duly decided by citing\n reasons. The petitioners, instead of availing the statutory\n remedy under the aforesaid Act of 1996 as per the procedure\n prescribed under the statute, filed the present writ petition\n challenging the award on the point of jurisdiction. This court is\n not inclined to entertain this writ petition under Article\n 226/227 of the Constitution of India which has been filed\n bypassing the statutory remedies. It cannot be said that once a\n writ petition has been filed challenging jurisdiction of the\n authority or alleging violations of the principles of natural\n justice, the writ petition has to be necessarily entertained and\n decided on merits. Such an interpretation would be against the\n very nature of extra ordinary discretionary jurisdiction\n exercised under \nArticle 226\n of the constitution of India and\n also against the scheme of the aforesaid Act of 1996 as the\n point of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is required to be\n raised as per the scheme of the Act of 1996 with particular\n reference to \nSection 16\n thereof and the remedy as well as the\n manner of availing the remedy against such decision is\n provided under the Act itself.\n\n19. So far as the Judgment reported in 2019 (4) JCR 243 (Jhr.) [State\n Project Director, through Uma Shankar Singh versus M/s. Raj\n Enterprises, Nainital (Uttarakhand)] is concerned, the same does\n not apply to the facts and circumstances of this case as in the\n said case, this court has considered the point as to whether a\n writ petition under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India is\n maintainable against an order passed by the commercial court\n and it has been held that the writ petition would be\n maintainable, but the Courts would be very slow in\n entertaining such writ petition considering the object of the\n \nCommercial Courts Act, 2015\n. In the said case, the petition of\n\n 13\n\n the petitioner that the award was a nullity was not taken on\n record by the learned executing court on the ground of expiry\n of 120 days as prescribed under order VIII \nRule 1 of C.P.C\n as\n applicable to the commercial courts. In such circumstances, the\n writ petition filed against the order of executing court was\n held to be maintainable and was also entertained and the\n matter was remitted back to the learned executing court\n considering the facts and circumstances of the said case.\n\n In the present case, the arbitral award has been\n challenged and the proceedings does not arise from any order\n passed by learned court below although it is not in dispute\n that on the date of filing of this writ petition, no case was\n pending for execution of the award. There is a vast difference\n between entertaining a writ petition against an arbitral award\n and entertaining a writ petition against an order passed by the\n court below in the matter of execution of award. Accordingly,\n the aforesaid judgement does not apply to the facts and\n circumstances of this case.\n\n20. The judgement passed by this court being W.P. (C) No. 6378\n of 2014 dated 14.06.2018 also does not apply to the facts and\n circumstances of this case where a writ petition was\n entertained and decided by holding that power of the High\n Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India is plenary\n in nature and involvement of contractual dispute or\n availability of alternative remedy cannot, ipso-facto, be a\n ground for dismissal of a writ petition and it was held that\n arbitrariness in State action involving public law element can\n be examined under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India .\n This judgement does not apply to the facts of this case where\n arbitral award is directly under challenge bypassing the\n statutory remedies under the aforesaid Act of 1996.\n\n21. So far as the judgment reported in (2018) 13 SCC 462 (\nBank of\n\n 14\n\nIndia vs. Yadav Consultancy Services Private Limited and another\n)\nis concerned, this court finds that in the said case, the award\nwas challenged under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 wherein certain point of jurisdiction was\ntaken and thereafter, the matter was challenged before the\nHigh Court under \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 which was also dismissed. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court was of the considered view that the High\nCourt erred in not considering the question of lack of\njurisdiction as raised by the counsel. This Court finds that\nthere is no dispute that the point regarding lack of jurisdiction\ncan be raised under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 if it comes within the permissible\ngrounds and the judgment under \nsection 34\n can be subject\nmatter of further challenge under \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 and the courts under the Act of 1996\nare under an obligation to decide the point of jurisdiction/lack\nof jurisdiction in accordance with law. In the instant case,\nadmittedly the petitioners have not approached the Civil\nCourt under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996 and accordingly, have not approached this court under\n\nSection 37\n of the aforesaid Act of 1996. Rather the petitioners\nhave straightway challenged the award under \nArticle 226\n of\nthe Constitution of India raising the point of jurisdiction of the\narbitral tribunal, which has already been decided by the\ntribunal by a reasoned order as stated above. Considering the\nnature of extra-ordinary and discretionary jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India and the facts and\ncircumstances of this case coupled with the scheme of the\naforesaid act of 1996, this court is not inclined to entertain the\nwrit petition and is of the view that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable.\n\n 15\n\n22. A coordinate bench of this court in judgment dated 03.03.2016\n passed in WPC No. 6/2002 has held in Para 8 that when\n specific grounds to assail an award are already available for\n challenge under \nsection 34\n of the aforesaid Act of 1996, there is\n no reason why the petitioner should not have availed the\n statutory remedy available under the provisions of the Act of\n 1996 which are in the nature of special legislation. The counsel\n for the petitioners has tried to distinguish this case by referring\n to certain observation of the court in Para 7 of the said\n judgement and submitted that it has been observed that \nin that\n case\n, there was no such ground that the reference itself was not\n maintainable by alleging that the supplier itself was not\n covered under the provision of the \nMSMED Act, 2006\n.\n\n This court is of the considered view that the said\n distinguishing feature has no bearing in this writ petition as\n the said point alleging that the Respondent No. 2 was not\n covered under the \nMSMED Act, 2006\n has been considered by\n the arbitral award and it is not in dispute that such point can\n be subject matter of challenge under \nSection 34\n of the aforesaid\n Act of 1996. In this view of the matter, the legal principle as\n held by this Court in Para 8 of the said judgement is still\n applicable to the facts of this case and applying the said\n principle of law, this court is not inclined to entertain this writ\n petition.\n\n23. As a result of the aforesaid findings, this court is not inclined\n to entertain the present writ petition filed by the petitioners\n against the impugned award and is also of the considered\n view that the present writ petition against the impugned\n award is not maintainable. Accordingly, the writ petition is\n dismissed.\n\n24. However, dismissal of this writ petition will not come in the\n way of the writ petitioners to take appropriate remedies as\n\n 16\n\n may be available to the petitioners in accordance with law and\n it is observed that dismissal of this case or any observation\n made in this order will not prejudice either of the parties in\n any manner whatsoever as this court has not entered into the\n merits of rival claims of the respective parties.\n\n 25. Since the writ petition is not being entertained and is held to\n be not maintainable against an award governed by the\n provisions of \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, the\n Interlocutory Application No. 5585 of 2019 filed by the\n Respondent No. 2 seeking direction upon the petitioners to\n deposit the statutory amount in this writ petition is also\n dismissed.\n\n 26. Any other pending Interlocutory application is dismissed as\n not pressed.\n\n 27. Let a copy of this judgement be immediately handed over to\n the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n (Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nBinit/",

This rule of exhaustion of\n statutory remedies is no doubt a rule of policy, convenience and\n discretion and the court may in exceptional cases issue a discretionary\n writ of certiorari. Where there is complete lack of jurisdiction for the\n officer or authority or tribunal to take action or there has been a\n contravention of fundamental rights or there has been a violation of rules\n of natural justice or where the Tribunal acted under a provision of law,\n which is ultra vires, then notwithstanding the existence of an alternative\n remedy, the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief. In the\n present case, the alternative remedy of challenging the judgment of the\n court was not before some other forum or tribunal. On the contrary, by\n virtue of sub-section (3) of \nSection 27\n of the Act, the order passed by the\n court amounted to a decree against which an appeal lay to the High\n Court. When the party had statutory remedy of assailing the order passed\n by the District Court by filing an appeal to the High Court itself, he could"

So far as the judgement relied upon by the petitioners in the\n case of \nWhirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks,\n Mumbai and Others\n reported in (1998) 8 SCC 1 is concerned, it\n has been clearly held in Para 15 that under \nArticle 226\n of the\n constitution , the High Court, having regard to the facts of the\n case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ\n petition, but the High Court has imposed upon itself certain\n restrictions, one of which is that if an efficacious remedy is\n available, the High Court would not normally exercise its\n jurisdiction. In this background, it has been held that the\n alternative remedy would not be a bar at least in three\n contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed\n for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where\n there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or\n where the order or proceedings are wholly without\n jurisdiction or the validity of an Act is challenged. Thus, it is\n clear that while entertaining the writ petition also, the court\n has to exercise sound discretion based on the facts of the cases\n as well as the statutory scheme dealing with the matter and it\n cannot be said that merely because a point of jurisdiction is\n involved, the writ petition has to be necessarily involved.
