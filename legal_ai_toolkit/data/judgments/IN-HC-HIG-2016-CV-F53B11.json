Petitioners\nThrough: Mr. Apurb Lal & Ms. Meenu Pandey,\nAdvocates.\nversus\n\nNORTH DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI\nAND ORS ..... Respondents\nThrough: Ms. Biji Rajesh, Ms. Aditi Gupta &\nMr. Gaurang Kanth, Advocate for NDMC.\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA\nHON'BLE MS. JUSTICE SUNITA GUPTA\n\nSUNITA GUPTA, J.\n\nThe present writ petition impugns the order dated 10.5.2016 passed by\nthe Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, whereby O.A.\nNo.1749/2015 filed by the petitioners has been dismissed.\n\n2. The petitioners were appointed as Laboratory Assistants in the\nerstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi between July, 2004 and October,\n2004. After trifurcation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the\npetitioners were assigned to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation\n(Corporation for short).\n\n3. The petitioners proclaim that they should be covered under the\nCentral Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (herein after referred to as the\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 1 of 18\n\nOld Pension Scheme) and not under the New Contributory Pension Scheme,\neffective from 1.1.2004 (hereinafter referred to as the New Pension\nScheme). The claim is predicated on the argument that they were appointed\nto posts in which vacancies had arisen in the year 2002-2003. The date of\nappointment being after 1.1.2004 would be inconsequential to decide the\napplicability of the old or new pension schemes to the petitioners. They\nattribute delay in appointment/joining to the respondents.\n\n4. For the sake of clarity, we would like to state the relevant facts. On\n27.12.2002, the respondent No.1 Corporation had requisitioned the Delhi\nSubordinate Services Selection Board („DSSSB‟ for short), for filling up of\nvarious posts including the vacant posts of Laboratory Assistants. The\nadvertisement inviting applications was published on 5.6.2003 and the\nwritten examination was conducted on 19.10.2003. The DSSSB had\ndeclared the results, vide Office Order No.109 dated 29.10.2003, and the\ndossiers of the selected candidates were sent to respondent No.1 Corporation\nby the DSSSB on 6.11.2003. The offer of appointment was made to the\npetitioners on 19.03.2004 and the petitioners were appointed to the post of\nLaboratory Assistants between July, 2004 and October, 2004.\n\n5. The petitioners submit that the New Pension Scheme which was\nbrought into effect from 1.1.2004 would not be applicable to the petitioners\nas they were recruited prior to 31.12.2003. There was no rational and basis\nfor fixing 1.1.2004 as the cut off date for applicability of the New Pension\nScheme and the date should be struck down as being violative and infringing\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioners relies on the decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nMarripati Nagaraja & Others vs. Government of Andhra\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 2 of 18\n\nPradesh & Ors.\n; (2007) 11 SCC 522 and the decision dated 28.06.2013 of\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam Bench in O.A. No.724/2012\ntitled\nP. Rajesh Kumar & Ors. vs. State of Kerala\nand the order dated\n11.12.2013 in O.A. No.1869/2011 titled\nRabinder Kumar Pattanayak vs.\nUnion of India & Ors.\ndecided by the Central Administrative Tribunal,\nPrincipal Bench, New Delhi.\n\n7. We have considered contentions raised by the petitioners but do not\nfind any merit in them.\n\n8. The Delhi Municipal Corporation Service Regulations, 1959 apply to\nall municipal officers and employees, except those appointed under a\ncontract, rendering part time service or earning daily wages. Regulation 4\n(1) reads as under:-\n\n\"4. Conditions of service of municipal officers and other\nmunicipal employees-\n\n(1) Unless otherwise provided in the Act or these\nRegulations, the Rules for the time being in force and\napplicable to Government servants in the service of\nthe Central Government shall, as far as may be,\nregulate the conditions of service of municipal\nofficers and other municipal employees except in\nrespect of matters relating to provident funds, subject\nto the modifications that any reference in the Rules to\na Government servant, the Consolidated Fund of\nIndia, the Civil Surgeon and the Medical Committee\nshall be construed as a reference respectively to a\nmunicipal officer or other municipal employees, the\nMunicipal Fund, the Municipal Health Officer and\nMedical Board constituted by the Commissioner.\"\n\nAs per the said Regulation, unless it is specifically provided in the\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 3 of 18\n\nMunicipal Act\nor in the present Regulations, the Rules in force and\napplicable to the Government servants in service of the Central Government\nwould regulate the conditions of service of municipal officers and\nemployees with the exception of matters relating to provident fund.\n\n9. Clause (1) of\nRegulation 3\nof the Municipal Corporation Services\n(Death-cum-Retirement and Benefits) Regulations, 1971 (1971 Regulations,\nfor short) reads as under:-\n\n\"3. Unless otherwise provided in the Act or these\nregulations, these regulations shall apply to all officers\nand other Municipal Employees of the M.C.D. whose\npay is chargeable to the \"General Account\" or the\n\"Water Supply & Sewage Disposal Account\" of the\nMunicipal Fund.\n\nProvided that nothing in these regulations shall apply\nto such Municipal Officers and other Municipal\nemployees as are appointed under any contract or\ntemporary deputation or render part time service or are\nin receipt of daily wages.\n\n(1) In future Municipal Officer and other Municipal\nemployees will be eligible for grant, in place of existing\nbenefits of contributory provident fund and gratuity of\nperson and death-cum-retirement gratuity with all\nrelated benefits, to the extent and subject to the\ncondition restrictions prescribed in the Liberalized\nPension Rules of the Central Government of 1950 and\nFamily Pension Scheme, 1964, as amended from time to\ntime, and these Rules and the relevant chapter of the\ncivil service Regulations, the Civil Pension\nCommutation Rules and all orders, rulings and\nprocedural instructions issued thereunder by the Central\nGovernment and the Comptroller and Auditor General\nof India, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Municipal\nOfficers and employees.\n\nProvided that those of the Municipal Officers and\nemployees who on the introduction of these regulations\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 4 of 18\n\nare, already subscribing to the contributory provident\nfund, may, at their option continue to subscribe to the\nfund under existing regulations or surrender the\nMunicipal contribution paid into their provident fund\naccounts and interest thereof, to the Corporation and\ninstead count their service towards pension, such option\nshall be exercised in writing within six months of the\npromulgation of these regulations and the option once\nexercised shall be treated as final and irrevocable.\"\n\nA reading of the said Regulation would indicate that benefit of the\nRules and relevant chapter of the Central Civil Services Regulations, Civil\nPension Commutation Rules, all orders and rulings, and procedural\ninstructions issued by the Central Government and the Comptroller and\nAuditor General of India, were to apply mutatis mutandis to municipal\nofficers and employees and were subject to the conditions and restrictions\nprescribed. The proviso deals with municipal employees and officers, who\nwere already subscribing to contributory provident fund.\n\n10. The Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 had come into force\non 1st June, 1972. By amendment dated 30th May, 2003, published in the\nGazette of India on the same date, the Central Civil Services (Pension)\nRules, 1972 were made applicable only to the Government servants\nappointed on or before 31st December, 2003. As a sequitur, the aforesaid\npension regulations would not apply to any Government servant appointed\non the 1st day of January 2004, or thereafter. Simultaneously, the\nGovernment of India vide notification No.5/7/2003-ECB & PR dated 22nd\nDecember, 2003 had introduced a new pension scheme for the Government\nemployees who had entered into service on or after 1st January, 2004.\n\n11. The Commissioner‟s letter No.F.33/CA-FA/665/C&C dated\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 5 of 18\n\n29.7.2005 refers to the New Pension Scheme applicable to all employees of\nautonomous bodies under various Central Ministries/Departments recruited\non or after 1.1.2004, as per the O.M. No.1(13)/EV/2001 dated 13.11.2003 of\nMinistry of Finance, Government of India. For the sake of clarity, we would\nlike to reproduce the relevant portion of the said letter which reads as\nunder:-\n\n\"By virtue of Delhi Municipal Corporation Service\n(Death-cum-Retirement & Benefits) Regulations, 1971\nnotified vide Delhi Administrative Gazette Notification\nNo.F. 2(130) 67-LSG dated 29.10.1971 Part-IV (Extra-\nordinary), Liberalized Pension Rules of the Central\nGovernment of 1950 and Family Pension Scheme 1964\nas amended from time to time, along with relevant\nchapter of Civil Service Regulation with Civil Pension\nCommutation Rules and all orders ruling procedural\ninstruction issued hereunder by the Central Government\nand Comptroller and Auditor General are applicable\nmutatis mutandis to Municipal Officer and employees.\n\nNow the Government of India, Ministry of Finance vide\nO.M. No.5/7/2003/ECB&PR dated 2.12.2003 has\nintroduced new defined Contribution Pension Scheme for\nnew entrants in Central Government Service except\nArmed Forces replacing the existing scheme of Defined\nBenefit Pension Scheme. Subsequently Government of\nIndia, Ministry of Finance vide No.1(7)(2)/2003/TA/11\ndated 7.1.2004 read with O.M. No. 1(7)(2)/2003/TA/67-\n74 dated 4.12.2004 have defined the important provisions\n(placed as Annexure-I). Salient features of the scheme\nare :-\n\n(i) The new pension scheme will be applicable to all\nemployees of Autonomous Bodies under various\nCentral Ministries/Departments recruited on or\nafter 1.1.2004 as per Govt. of India, Ministry of\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 6 of 18\n\nFinance O.M. No. 1(13)/EV/2001 dated\n13.11.2003.\n\n(ii) Contribution to be recovered from every\nemployee/officer @ 10% of his Pay + Dearness\nPay + Dearness Allowance every month. Equal\namount of Corporation contribution is to be paid\nby the Corporation.\n\n(iii) The amount so collected will be invested to created\nPension Fund.\n\n(iv) The modalities of managing the fund are yet to be\nfinalized on the lines of Govt. of India as well\nGovt. of NCT of Delhi.\n\nIn view of the provision of Delhi Municipal Corporation\nServices (Death-cum-Retirement & Benefits) Regulations\n1971, new Pension Scheme will also be applicable to all\nofficers and employees of the Municipal Corporation of\nDelhi recruited on or after 1.1.2004.\n\nIt is, therefore, proposed that new defined Contribution\nPension Scheme introduced by Govt. of India with all\nprocedures, instructions, orders and future amendments\nissued there undue [sic. under] by the Central Govt. of\n[sic. or] Comptroller & Auditor General from time to\ntime be adopted mutatis and mutandis for Municipal\nofficers and employees recruited on or after 1.1.2004.\n\nThe matter may please be placed before the Corporation\nthrough the Standing Committee for approval.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nThe letter of the Commissioner dated 29.07.2005 was in conformity\nwith the Delhi Municipal Corporation Service Regulations, 1959 as well as\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 7 of 18\n\nthe Municipal Corporation Services (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits)\nRegulations, 1971. A reading of the aforesaid letter elucidates that the\nrespondent No.1-Corporation had followed the mandate issued by the\nCentral Government, i.e. the New Pension Scheme was made applicable to\nall employees joining on or after 1.1.2004. The Central Government as a\nmatter of policy and for good reason has taken the date of joining as the\ndetermining factor for deciding whether a Government employee would be\ncovered under the Old Pension Scheme or the New Pension Scheme, for it\nwould curtail litigation and make the New Pension Scheme applicable\nprospectively and not retrospectively. The letter uses the expression\n\"recruited on or after 1.1.2004\" The said expression has to be read as per the\nCentral Government‟s interpretation and instructions.\n\n12. The penultimate paragraph of the Commissioner‟s letter dated\n29.7.2005 is lucid and categorical. The letter specifically records that the\nNew Pension Scheme introduced by the Government of India with all\nprocedures, instructions, orders and future amendments issued there under\nby the Central Government from time to time, would be adopted mutatis\nmutandis by the Corporation and the employees recruited on or after\n1.1.2004. It was specifically clarified that the New Pension Scheme would\nbe applicable as per the Government of India, Ministry of Finance O.M.\nNo.1(13)/EV/2001 dated 13.11.2003. The cut-off date of 31st December,\n2003 for applicability of the old pension scheme was dependent upon the\ndate of joining and not on the date when the recruitment process was\ninitiated.\n\n13. Accordingly, the matter was placed before the Standing Committee,\nwho vide their Resolution No.210 dated 10th August, 2005 had resolved to\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 8 of 18\n\napply the new contributory pension scheme to municipal employees\nrecruited in service on or after 1st January, 2004.\n\n14. The Commissioner of Municipal Corporation vide letter No.F.33/CA-\ncum-FA/1320/C&C dated 10th December, 2007 proposed the procedure for\nimplementation of the New Pension Scheme in the MCD for employees who\nhad been recruited on or after 1.1.2004. In the said letter, the expression\nused is \"joined service on or after 1.1.2004.\" The contention of the petitioner\nthat the old pension scheme would be applicable to all employees dependent\nupon the date when the recruitment process was initiated is clearly contrary\nto the letters of the Commissioner mentioned above.\n\n15. It is pertinent to note that the letter dated 29.7.2005 itself is not under\nchallenge or questioned on the ground of ultra vires either the provisions of\nthe Act or the Regulations. The prayer made in the OA was restricted to\nsetting aside of the order dated 23rd April, 2015 by which the Administrative\nOfficer (Health) of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation had informed the\npetitioners that they would be covered by the new pension scheme as they\nhad joined municipal service on or after 1st January, 2004 and were not\neligible for benefits under the old pension scheme.\n\n16. The second prayer in the OA was to direct the respondents to give\npension to the petitioners under the old pension scheme as was done in the\ncase of other employees. The OA referred to office order dated 1 st June,\n2010 and 10th August, 2011 by which benefit of old pension scheme was\ngranted to Dr. Alka Chandra, Specialist (Grade-II), Anaesthesia and Dr.\nRachna Rustgi Gupta, GDMO-II. These letters accept their representations\nto be governed by the old pension scheme. In these cases, benefit of old\npension scheme was allowed after noticing that the candidates from the\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 9 of 18\n\nsame batch including those junior had joined before 31 st December, 2003\nand had been admitted to the old pension scheme. These cases, therefore,\nwould fall in a separate category, for some of the candidates of the same\nbatch, including those who were junior, were appointed earlier in point of\ntime and were covered by the old pension scheme and, therefore, directions\nwere given to cover the other candidates who had joined after 1 st January,\n2004 under the old pension scheme. We are not determining and\ncommenting upon the merits of the said orders, for that is not the subject\nmatter before us. In the present case, all appointments as Laboratory\nAssistants were made between July, 2004 and October, 2004. It is not a case\nwherein some candidates or juniors were appointed as Laboratory Assistant\non or before 31st December, 2003 and were accordingly entitled to benefit\nunder the old pension scheme.\n\n17. Reliance placed by the counsel for the petitioners on the decision of\nthe Principal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal in\nOA\nNo.1869/2011, Rabinder Kumar Pattanayak Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n,\ndated 11th December, 2013 is misconceived and is distinguishable on facts.\nIn the said case, selection to the post of Assistant Legislative Council\nadvertised by the Union Public Service Commission vide advertisement\nNo.14/2002 became subject matter of challenge before the Tribunal and then\nbefore the High Court in a writ petition. This had resulted in delay in issue\nof appointment letters to some of the candidates, who were ultimately\ndeclared successful and were offered appointments. Applying the maxim\nand the dictum that the Court shall not prejudice anyone, relief was granted\nby extending benefit of the old pension rules noticing that provisional\nappointment had been granted from the date of appointment of junior.\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 10 of 18\n\nDirection was given that the candidate should be treated at par with his batch\nmates for all consequential purposes except back wages. In the present case,\nwe do not have anyone from the same recruitment process or a junior joining\nthe post of Laboratory Assistant prior to 1st January, 2004. No one has been\ngiven benefit of the old pension scheme.\n\n18. We are not inclined to accept the reasoning of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Ernakulam Bench in the decision dated 28.06.2013\nin OA No. 724/2012,\nP. Rajesh Kumar and Ors. Vs. The Union of India &\nOrs.\n, which records that benefit of the old pension scheme would be\navailable to the applicants therein for the reason that the vacancies had\narisen and related to the period prior to 1st January, 2004. The ratio and\nreasoning is unacceptable in view of the prescribed cut-off date of 1.1.2004,\nwith reference to the date of joining and not the date of vacancies. The\naforesaid criterion, i.e. the date of joining, is not arbitrary or whimsical but\nis with salutary and good reason.\n\nCourts cannot substitute the said criterion\nwith another criterion as has been done by the Tribunal in the case of\nP.\nRajesh Kumar\n(supra), wherein the date of vacancy, it has been observed,\nwould be the fair and just criterion. This is impermissible and cannot be\naccepted. The courts or judicial forums cannot legislate and substitute dates.\nIt is well-settled that the courts do not interfere with cut-off date as these are\nmatters of discretion and within the domain of the Executive or the\nLegislature. The power to specify a date from which terminal or pensionary\nbenefits, as the case may be, shall take effect is concomitant of the power of\nthe State or Corporation to change the conditions of service unilaterally. So\nlong as the date specified is reasonable and not wayward with reference to\nthe requirement of fixing a point of time etc., no interference by the Court is\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 11 of 18\n\ncalled for.\n\n(See\nState of West Bengal & Ors. Vs. Ratan Behari Dey & Ors.\n\n(1993) 4 SCC 62). When classification is permissible, choice of date being a\nbasis of classification, the date so fixed cannot always be dubbed as arbitrary\neven if no particular reason is forthcoming for the choice unless it is shown\nto be capricious or whimsical in the given circumstances. When a line or\npoint is to be fixed and there is no mathematical formula or logical way to\nfix the same precisely, the decision of the Legislature or its delegate must be\naccepted unless it can be said that the date or point so fixed is widely of the\nreasonable mark.\n\n(See\nUnion of India Vs. Parameswaran Matchworks\n\n(\n1975) 1 SCC 305 and A. Manjula Bhashini Vs. A.P. Women\n's Coop\nFinance Corpn. Ltd. (2009) 8 SCC 431). Whenever a law is enacted or an\namendment is made, the same has to be with effect from a particular date.\nWhen it is otherwise permissible and legitimate to fix a date, the date so\nfixed is open to scrutiny on the limited grounds of whimsicality and\ncapriciousness. If the choice made is burdensome to those to whom the\nwrong done is sought to be rectified, it would be open to the Court to\nexamine the choice of date and find out whether it has resulted in any\ndiscrimination.\n(See B. Prabhakar Rao Vs. State of A.P, (1985) Supp SCC\n\n432). Further, it is a well-settled and accepted principle of law that the name\nof a candidate appearing on a select list would not give him an indefeasible\nright to appointment and it would be open to the Government to not fill up\nthe vacancies. The Government cannot be compelled to fill up vacancies\nwhere the decision not to do so is sound and rational, especially in the case\nof direct recruits. (See\nNeelima Shangla Vs. State of Haryana\n(\n1986) 4\nSCC 268), Manoj Manu vs. UOI\n(2013) 12 SCC 171, Kulwinder Pal Singh\nVs. State of Punjab (2016) 6 SCC 532). Thus, we would hold that there can\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 12 of 18\n\nbe a gap between the date of vacancy, selection and appointment. On some\noccasions, appointments may not be made at all or may be made after a long\ndelay.\n\n19. Reliance placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in\nMarripati\nNagaraja and Ors. Vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Ors.\n, (2007)\n11 SCC 522 is misplaced. The said case related to recruitment to 34 posts of\nAssistant Director of Agriculture in the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Service\npursuant to the notification issued on 1.10.1992. Subsequently, there was an\namendment in the recruitment rules and Rule 22-A providing for reservation\nfor women was substituted. On interpreting the said Rule, the Supreme\nCourt observed that the women candidates were entitled to preference and\nthe percentage of reservation was increased from 30 to 33.33 per cent. The\nSupreme Court held that though the notification amending the rule had been\ngiven retrospective effect, no existing right of any person was taken away by\nissue of the said notification. Referring to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution, it\nwas observed that the Government is entitled to make rules with\nretrospective effect and retroactive operation. However, in the absence of\nany rule being given a retrospective effect by an express provision or\nstipulation, the rules prevailing on the date of notification were to be\napplied. Going by the dictum, in the present case, the new pension scheme\nhas been made applicable to all those who had joined on or after 1 st January,\n2004. Significantly, it was held that whether or not a rule was to be given\nretrospective effect is within the domain of the State and unless the rule was\nset aside, it would not be unconstitutional.\n\n20. The third prayer made by the petitioner in the OA was that\nrules/amendments/instructions were not in consonance with the\nArticle 14\nof\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 13 of 18\n\nthe Constitution. The challenge, it appears, is to the entire new pension\nscheme, but the said challenge has been made without any basis or\nfoundation. Even before us, no such attempt was made to challenge the very\nbasis of the new pension scheme. For the reasons stated in paragraph 18\nabove, the challenge to the date of joining as the determining criteria, and\n1.1.2004 as the cut-off date must be rejected.\n\n21. The impugned order of the Tribunal follows the Division Bench\njudgment of this court in\nShailender Kumar and Ors. vs. Delhi High\nCourt\n(Through Registrar General) and Anr.; (2012) 189 DLT 524. The said case\nrelated to appointment of petitioners who were unable to join the post of\nLower Division Clerk by 31.12.2003, though they were offered appointment\nby letters dated 15.9.2003, 15.11.2003 and 12.12.2003, and the said offer of\nappointment was accepted. An identical plea was raised. Pertinently, the\ncontention in the said case was on a better footing as letters of offer were\nissued pre 31.12.2003 but actual date of joining was post 31.12.2003.\nRejecting the plea of the petitioners therein, it was held as under :-\n\n\"2. The main contention of the petitioners is that the\noffer of appointment having been made to them prior to\n01.01.2004 and their inability to join the post by\n31.12.2003 not being attributable to any lapse on their\npart, the benefit of CCS(Pension) Rules, cannot be\ndenied to them, particularly, when this was extended to\nthose who were selected simultaneously with them but\nwere able to join on or before 31.12.2003, on account of\ntheir medical examination and police verification having\nbeen completed by that date. In our view, the contention\nis devoid of any merit. The Government was well within\nits right in discontinuing the applicability of CCS\n(Pension) Rules, 1972 and applying a new pension\nscheme to those who were to join the service after\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 14 of 18\n\npromulgation of the new pension scheme. It was for the\nGovernment to decide, in its wisdom, as to whether it\nwanted to apply the new pension scheme to those who\nhad entered service on or after 01.01.2004 or to those\nwho were offered appointment on or after 01.01.2004.\nThe Government having decided to discontinue the\napplicability of CCS (Pension) Rules and to extend the\nnew pension scheme to all those who were to join service\non or after 01.01.2004, irrespective of the date on which\noffer of appointment was made to them, the petitioners do\nnot have any legal right to claim applicability of\nCCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 to them. It is not as if the new\npension scheme has been introduced after the petitioners\nhad joined service of the Government. The petitioners\nwere not in the service of the Government prior to\n01.01.2004 and, therefore, they had no right to the posts\nof LDC in District Sessions Court, when the new scheme\nwas promulgated by the Government. Thus, this is not a\ncase of service condition of the employees being varied\nby the Government to their detriment. Even if the\npetitioners could not join the service on or before\n31.12.03 on account of no fault on their part that would\nmake no difference since the relevant date is the date of\njoining the service and not the date on which the\nemployment was offered to them. If we accept the\ncontention that the offer of appointment having been\nmade to the petitioners prior to 01.01.2004, they are\nentitled to be governed by CCS (Pension) Rules, that\nwould be contrary to the terms of the scheme framed by\nthe Government. We must take note of the fact that there\nhas necessarily to be some timelag between the making of\noffer for appointment and the selected candidate joining\nthe service of the Government because medical\nexamination and police verification must necessarily\nprecede the joining of service by him. If the medical\nexamination of some persons who are offered\nemployment along with the petitioners was conducted\nand/or their police verification was done before the\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 15 of 18\n\nmedical examination and/or police verification of the\npetitioners and consequently, those persons were able to\njoin service on or before 31.12.2003 no benefit on that\naccount accrues to the petitioners since completion of\nmedical examination and police verification depends\nupon a lot of factors including the place where the\ncandidate is residing, the hospital in which he is to be\nmedically examined, the date fixed by that hospital for\nmedical examination, the time taken by the concerned\npolice official in verification of the antecedents etc. If a\nperson is offered employment say in last week of\nDecember, 2003, he cannot claim benefit of CCS\n(Pension) Rules because some time is necessarily\nrequired for his medical examination and police\nverification and, therefore, it will not be possible for him\nto join the service of the Government on or before\n31.12.2003.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n5. However, in the case before us, there was no order\npassed by any Court restraining the respondents from\nmaking appointments to the post of LDC in District &\nSessions Court. They were in a position to join service\nsoon after their medical examination and police\nverification was complete. On the other hand, in the case\nof\nDr. Pawan Kumar N. Mali\n(supra), relief was granted\nto the petitioners, primarily applying the principle that\nthe order of the Court cannot prejudice anyone. Had\nthere been no stay order\nin that case\n, the respondents\nin\nthat case\nwould have joined service prior to 01.01.2004,\nsince not only the offer of appointment had been made to\nthem, even their medical examination had been\nconducted well before the cut-off date of 01.01.2004.\nThey were prevented from joining service, only because\nof stay order granted by the Court. On the other hand,\nnone of the petitioners before this Court could have been\nallowed to join service prior to 01.01.2004 since the\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 16 of 18\n\ncharacter verification in respect of all the three\npetitioners was received after 31.12.2003.\nThis judgment,\ntherefore, cannot be applied to the case before us.\n\n6. This is not the case of the petitioners that their\ninability to join on or before 31.12.2003 was attributable\nto any negligence or lapse on the part of the respondents.\nIf inability of the petitioners to join service on or before\n31.12.2003 is not attributable to the respondents or to\nany order passed by a Court and was only on account of\nthe time taken by the Hospital/Police in conducting\nmedical examination and police verification, the\npetitioners cannot claim parity with the petitioners in the\ncase of\nDr. Pawan Kumar N.Mali\n(supra). For the\nreasons given in the preceding paragraphs, we find no\nmerit in the writ petition and the same is hereby\ndismissed.\"\n\n22. The Division Bench of this court in\nShailender Kumar and Ors\n\n(supra) distinguished the decision in W.P. (C) No.5983/2010 titled\n\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi & Anr. vs. Dr. Pawan Kumar N. Mali &\nOrs.\ndated 3.2.2011.\n\nNotably, in\nDr. Pawan Kumar N. Mali\n(supra) case,\nthe doctors in question were selected by UPSC in October, 2002 and 3 out of\n13 selected officers had joined on 20.1.2003. The remaining 10 doctors had\nundergone the medical examination, but they could not be given placement\non account of the interim order passed in the writ petition filed by the\ndoctors who were appointed on contractual basis seeking their\nregularization. It was held that the status quo order in respect of the doctors\non contractual basis which was subsequently vacated and the writ petition\nwas dismissed, would not prejudice the respondents. This case carves, and\nrelates to, an exception to the general rule.\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 17 of 18\n\n23. In the present case, the delay in issue of appointment letters was not\nmalafide or intentional. The results were declared and thereafter the dossiers\nof selected candidates were sent by the DSSSB on 06.12.2003. The files had\nto be processed and by the time the appointment letters were issued, the\nNew Pension Scheme enforceable with effect from 1.1.2004 had become\napplicable. Thus, the decision of the Division Bench in the case of\n\nShailendra Kumar\n(supra) would be squarely applicable.\n\n24. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any merit in the\npresent writ petition and the same is dismissed affirming and upholding the\norder passed by the Tribunal. There would be no order as to costs.\n\nSUNITA GUPTA, J.\n\nSANJIV KHANNA, J.\n\nDECEMBER 01, 2016\n'AA'\n\nW.P.(C) 5828/2016 Page 18 of 18",

THE PRESENT WRIT PETITION IMPUGNS THE ORDER DATED 10.5.2016 PASSED BY THE PRINCIPAL BENCH OF THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL, WHEREBY O.A. NO.1749/2015 FILED BY THE PETITIONERS HAS BEEN DISMISSED.  2. THE PETITIONERS WERE APPOINTED AS LABORATORY ASSISTANTS IN THE ERSTWHILE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI BETWEEN JULY, 2004 AND OCTOBER, 2004. AFTER TRIFURCATION OF THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI, THE PETITIONERS WERE ASSIGNED TO THE NORTH DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION (CORPORATION FOR SHORT).  3. THE PETITIONERS PROCLAIM THAT THEY SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE CENTRAL CIVIL SERVICES (PENSION) RULES, 1972 (HEREIN AFTER REFERRED TO AS THE  W.P.(C) 5828/2016 PAGE 1 OF 18  OLD PENSION SCHEME) AND NOT UNDER THE NEW CONTRIBUTORY PENSION SCHEME, EFFECTIVE FROM 1.1.2004 (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE NEW PENSION SCHEME). THE CLAIM IS PREDICATED ON THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY WERE APPOINTED TO POSTS IN WHICH VACANCIES HAD ARISEN IN THE YEAR 2002-2003. THE DATE OF APPOINTMENT BEING AFTER 1.1.2004 WOULD BE INCONSEQUENTIAL TO DECIDE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE OLD OR NEW PENSION SCHEMES TO THE PETITIONERS. THEY ATTRIBUTE DELAY IN APPOINTMENT/JOINING TO THE RESPONDENTS.  4. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, WE WOULD LIKE TO STATE THE RELEVANT FACTS. ON 27.12.2002, THE RESPONDENT NO.1 CORPORATION HAD REQUISITIONED THE DELHI SUBORDINATE SERVICES SELECTION BOARD („DSSSB‟ FOR SHORT), FOR FILLING UP OF VARIOUS POSTS INCLUDING THE VACANT POSTS OF LABORATORY ASSISTANTS. THE ADVERTISEMENT INVITING APPLICATIONS WAS PUBLISHED ON 5.6.2003 AND THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION WAS CONDUCTED ON 19.10.2003. THE DSSSB HAD DECLARED THE RESULTS, VIDE OFFICE ORDER NO.109 DATED 29.10.2003, AND THE DOSSIERS OF THE SELECTED CANDIDATES WERE SENT TO RESPONDENT NO.1 CORPORATION BY THE DSSSB ON 6.11.2003. THE OFFER OF APPOINTMENT WAS MADE TO THE PETITIONERS ON 19.03.2004 AND THE PETITIONERS WERE APPOINTED TO THE POST OF LABORATORY ASSISTANTS BETWEEN JULY, 2004 AND OCTOBER, 2004.  5. THE PETITIONERS SUBMIT THAT THE NEW PENSION SCHEME WHICH WAS BROUGHT INTO EFFECT FROM 1.1.2004 WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE PETITIONERS AS THEY WERE RECRUITED PRIOR TO 31.12.2003. THERE WAS NO RATIONAL AND BASIS FOR FIXING 1.1.2004 AS THE CUT OFF DATE FOR APPLICABILITY OF THE NEW PENSION SCHEME AND THE DATE SHOULD BE STRUCK DOWN AS BEING VIOLATIVE AND INFRINGING  ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA.  6. LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONERS RELIES ON THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN MARRIPATI NAGARAJA & OTHERS VS. GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA  W.P.(C) 5828/2016 PAGE 2 OF 18  PRADESH & ORS. ; (2007) 11 SCC 522 AND THE DECISION DATED 28.06.2013 OF THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL, ERNAKULAM BENCH IN O.A. NO.724/2012 TITLED P. RAJESH KUMAR & ORS. VS. STATE OF KERALA AND THE ORDER DATED 11.12.2013 IN O.A. NO.1869/2011 TITLED RABINDER KUMAR PATTANAYAK VS. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. DECIDED BY THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL, PRINCIPAL BENCH, NEW DELHI.  7. WE HAVE CONSIDERED CONTENTIONS RAISED BY THE PETITIONERS BUT DO NOT FIND ANY MERIT IN THEM.  8. THE DELHI MUNICIPAL CORPORATION SERVICE REGULATIONS, 1959 APPLY TO ALL MUNICIPAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES, EXCEPT THOSE APPOINTED UNDER A CONTRACT, RENDERING PART TIME SERVICE OR EARNING DAILY WAGES.
