JUSTICE I. A. ANSARI\n THE HON'BLE DR. (MRS.) JUSTICE INDIRA SHAH\n\nAdvocates present:\n\nFor the petitioner : Mr. N Nath, Advocate.\nFor the respondents : Mr. DC Chakraborty,\n Central Govt. Counsel,\n Mr. I Hussain, SC, CGC,\n Mr. PS Deka, Govt. Advocate, Assam,\n Mr. S. Sharma, Advocate,\n Mr. DK Mishra, Amicus Curiae,\nDate of hearing : 20th June, 2013.\nDate of Judgment : 22nd July, 2013\n\n Judgment and Order\n(Ansari, J)\n\n The material facts, giving rise to the present writ petition, made\n\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India, may, in brief, be set out as\n\nunder:\n\n (i) The petitioner came to be appointed, on 18-11-1982, as\n\nAssistant Conservator of Forest, Government of Assam, and he was\n\npromoted, on 21-11-1986, as Deputy Conservator of Forests. The State\n Page 2\n\nGovernment published, on 25-08-2005, a draft gradation list showing inter\n\nse seniority of Deputy Conservator of Forests as on 01-08-2005.\n\n (ii) The Union Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred\n\nto as 'UPSC') constituted, in the year 2009, a Selection Committee to\n\nrecommend suitable officials from State Forest Service for promotion to\n\nthe Indian Forest Service for the year 2008, the number of vacancies, for\n\ncarrying out promotion to the Indian Forest Service, being three for the\n\nyear 2008.\n\n (iii) As the zone of consideration is taken 3 times the number of\n\nvacancies available, 9 names were to be considered for filling up the said\n\n3 vacancies for the year 2008. The names of the writ petitioner as well as\n\nthe 4th respondent herein were included amongst the incumbents, whose\n\ncandidature was placed before the Selection Committee for consideration.\n\n (iv) The Selection Committee convened its meeting to\n\nrecommend the names of the State Forest Service Officials for promotion\n\nto the Indian Forest Service for the year 2008. Promotion from the State\n\nForest Service to the Indian Forest Service (hereinafter referred to as 'IFS')\n\nis governed by the Indian Forest Service (Appointment by Promotion)\n\nRegulations, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Promotion Regulations')\n\nand the criterion for such promotion is merit-cum-suitability.\n\n (v) Regulation 5 (3AA) of the Promotion Regulations provide for\n\nthe manner of promotion to the State Forest Service Officials to the IFS. In\n\nterms of Regulation 5(3AA), the Selection Committee shall classify the\n Page 3\n\neligible officers as 'Outstanding', 'Very Good', 'Good' or 'Unfit', as the\n\ncase may be, on the basis of overall relative assessment of their service\n\nrecords. Thus, the Annual Confidential Reports (hereinafter referred to as\n\n'ACR(s)') of the last 5 years, immediately preceding the year of selection,\n\namongst other documents, and records, pertaining to the service of the\n\ncandidates, formed the foundation for evaluation of relative merit of the\n\ncandidates for their ultimate categorization.\n\n (vi) The ACR of the State Government officials, in Assam, is\n\nrecorded in accordance with the provisions of the Assam Services\n\n(Confidential Rolls) Rules, 1990 (hereinafter referred to as 'the ACR\n\nRules') framed under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India, which\n\nordain the procedure for writing and maintaining confidential report,\n\nreview and acceptance thereof as well as consequential grading of the\n\nofficer concerned. Rule 2(c) of the ACR Rules defines confidential report\n\nto be one as drawn up in terms with the procedure laid down in Rule 5 of\n\nthe ACR Rules, which, in turn, contemplates that a confidential report,\n\ncontaining the appraisal of the performance, character, conduct and\n\nqualities of every Government employee, shall be written for each\n\nfinancial year, ordinarily, within, at the latest, two months of the close of\n\nthe financial year. Rule 6 of the ACR Rules envisages that the confidential\n\nreport shall be reviewed by the reviewing authority within one month of\n\nits being written. Sub-Rule (3) of Rule 6 makes the reviewing authority or\n\naccepting authority, as the case may be, competent to review the\n Page 4\n\nconfidential report if the authority concerned has seen the performance of\n\nthe employee for, at least, 90 days during the period for which the report\n\nhas been written. The confidential report, upon review, shall, under Rule\n\n7 of the ACR Rules, be accepted with such modification as may be\n\nconsidered necessary and countersigned by the accepting authority\n\nconcerned within one month of its review.\n\n (vii) The meeting of the Selection Committee, constituted by the\n\nUPSC, was convened, on 08-12-2009, to consider the cases of the suitable\n\neligible officers of the State Forest Service including the cases of the\n\npetitioner as well as 4th respondent and to recommend 3 officials of the\n\nState Forest Service for promotion to the Indian Forest Service. Neither\n\nthe petitioner nor the 4th respondent was found suitable for promotion\n\nand their names were accordingly did not figure in the list of\n\nrecommendees for promotion to the IFS.\n\n (viii) Acting on the recommendations, so made, Ministry of\n\nEnvironment and Forest, Government of India, issued a notification, on\n\n25-08-2010, promoting the said three officials to the Indian Forest Service,\n\nthese three officials being, Sri Hem Kanta Talukdar, Sri Chitta Ranjan\n\nBorbora and Sri Modhusudhan Singha and these three persons were\n\naccordingly promoted to the Indian Forest Service and allocated the then\n\nAssam-Meghalaya Joint Cadre by notification, dated 31-08-2010, issued,\n\nin this regard, by the Director, Ministry of Environment and Forests,\n\nGovernment of India. All the three persons, who were so promoted, were\n Page 5\n\njunior to the petitioner in the gradation list, which had been published, as\n\nalready indicated above, on 25-08-2005.\n\n2. In the month of April, 2010, the petitioner came to know from\n\nreliable source that his grading, in the ACR of 2002-03, was given 'Good'\n\nby the reporting authority, but the reviewing authority downgraded it to\n\n'Average' without assigning any reason therefor. The petitioner also\n\ncame to learn that in his ACR, pertaining to the period 30-09-2004 to 31-\n\n03-2005, the reviewing officer had assigned him the grading 'Average',\n\nthough all the attributes, recorded by the recording officer under various\n\nparameters, indicated that the petitioner could have very well been\n\ngraded as 'Good'. This apart, the petitioner also came to learn that his\n\nperformance, for the period from 01-04-2004 to 29-04-2004 and also for\n\nthe period from 18-08-2005 to 05-01-2006, remained without being\n\nappraised inasmuch as the petitioner's ACRs for the said two periods,\n\nnamely, 01-04-2004 to 29-04-2004 and 18.08.2005 to 05.01.2006, had neither\n\nbeen prepared nor necessary steps were taken, in this regard, by the\n\nreporting officer without any discernible reason.\n\n3. The downgrading of the ACR of the petitioner, for the period 2002-\n\n2003 from 'Good' to 'Average' by the accepting authority without\n\nassigning any reason therefor, was, in effect, an adverse entry,\n\nparticularly, in the context of Regulation 5(3AA) of the Promotion\n\nRegulations, which mandates classification of eligible officers as\n Page 6\n\n'Outstanding', 'Very Good', 'Good' or 'Unfit' on the basis of overall\n\nassessment of the relative merit of their service records.\n\n4. In the face of the classification, which is required to be made by\n\nRegulation 5(3AA), any entry, which is below 'Outstanding', is an\n\nadverse entry and it will render a person 'Unfit' for promotion to the IFS.\n\nThe said moderated entry, downgrading the petitioner's ACRs from\n\n'Good' to 'Average', for the year 2002-03, was never communicated to the\n\npetitioner at any point of time, though such an entry was an adverse\n\nentry and ought to have been communicated to the petitioner in terms of\n\nRule 10 of the Assam Services (Confidential Rolls) Rules, 1990.\n\n5. The petitioner, then, filed, on 19-07-2010, a representation to the\n\nCommissioner and Secretary, Environment and Forests, Government of\n\nAssam, seeking review of his ACRs to ascertain if there was any down\n\ngrading of any entry, which was adverse in nature and to rectify if there\n\nwas any such adverse entry.\n\n6. By his order, dated 16-09-2010, the Commissioner and Secretary,\n\nEnvironment and Forests, Government of Assam, upgraded the\n\ndowngraded entry of the petitioner, for the period 2002-03 as well as for\n\nthe period 30-09-2004 to 31-03-2005, from 'Average' to 'Good' and further\n\ndirected the concerned recording officers to record the ACRs of the\n\npetitioner for the period, which was left unrecorded, i.e., for the periods\n\nfrom 01-04-2004 to 29-04-2004 and from 18-08-2005 to 05-01-2006.\n\n Page 7\n\n7. Pursuant to the order, so issued on 16-09-2010, the ACRs, for the\n\nperiods from 01-04-2004 to 29-04-2004 and 18-08-2005 to 05-01-2006,\n\nwhich had not been appraised, was subsequently recorded and the\n\npetitioner was assigned the grading 'Very Good' and 'Outstanding' for\n\nthe periods from 01-04-2004 to 29-04-2004 and from 18-08-2005 to 05-01-\n\n2006, respectively.\n\n8. Thereafter, the 4th respondent, too, preferred representation to the\n\nCommissioner and Secretary, Environment and Forests, Government of\n\nAssam, seeking upgradation of his downgraded entries for the period\n\n2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 and the entries, recorded\n\ntherein, were, eventually, upgraded to 'Very Good' by an order, issued, in\n\nthis regard.\n\n9. Following the upgradation of entries of the petitioner, the Principal\n\nSecretary, Government of Assam, addressed a communication, on 21-05-\n\n2001, to the UPSC requesting the UPSC to hold Review Selection\n\nCommittee for reviewing the select list of the year 2008. Earlier thereto,\n\nthe petitioner as well as the 4th respondent had moved the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal, Guwahati Bench, seeking directions to be issued\n\nto the UPSC to hold meeting of the Review Selection Committee for the\n\npurpose of considering the cases of the petitioner and the 4th respondent\n\nfor promotion to the IFS. The present petitioner's application gave rise to\n\nOriginal Application (in short, 'OA') No. 211 of 2011, which was disposed\n\nof by the learned Tribunal, on 26-09-2011, by directing the UPSC to hold\n Page 8\n\nReview Selection Committee within a period of three months from the\n\ndate of receipt of the order so passed by the learned Tribunal.\n\n10. Pursuant to the order, so passed by the learned Tribunal, a Review\n\nSelection Committee was constituted to review the select list of the year\n\n2008. The Review Selection Committee accordingly convened its meeting\n\non 09-12-2011 and recommended the case of 4th respondent for promotion\n\nto the IFS for the year 2008. This recommendation was put to challenge\n\nby the present petitioner by making an application under \nSection 19\n of\n\nthe Central Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, at Guwahati, which gave\n\nrise to Original Application (in short, 'OA') No. 64 of 2012. The said\n\napplication has, however, been dismissed by order, dated 05-09-2012.\n\nAggrieved by this order, dated 05-09-2012, dismissing his OA, the\n\npetitioner has made the present writ petition, under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India, seeking issuance of appropriate directions.\n\n11. We have heard Mr. N. Nath, learned counsel for the petitioner, and\n\nMr. D. C. Chakraborty, learned Central Government counsel, appearing\n\nfor respondent No. 2. We have also heard Mr. I. Hussain, learned Central\n\nGovernment counsel, appearing for respondent No. 1, Mr. P. S. Deka,\n\nlearned Additional Senior Govt. Advocate, appearing for respondent No.\n\n4, and Mr. D. K. Mishra, learned Senior counsel, appearing as amicus\n\ncuriae.\n\n12. The first contention, raised on behalf of the petitioner, is that there\n\nhas been violation of \nRegulation 5(3AA)\n of the Indian Forest Service\n Page 9\n\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966 (which is being referred\n\nto as the 'Promotion Regulations'), inasmuch as the Review Selection\n\nCommittee, contends Mr. Nath, has not considered, in accordance with\n\nlaw, the petitioner's 5 years record of service immediately preceding the\n\nyear of selection, i.e., the year 2008.\n\n13. Resisting the submission, so made, the respondents contend, in\n\ntune with each other, that the Review Selection Committee did consider,\n\nin accordance with the statutory obligations and the 'guidelines' issued, in\n\nthis regard, by the UPSC, i.e., respondent No.2, the records of the\n\npetitioner's service for the requisite periods.\n\n14. Let us, now, determine the correctness of the rival submissions,\n\nwhich have been made before us.\n\n15. While considering the question as to whether the Review Selection\n\nCommittee has dealt with the petitioner's case and considered his ACR(s)\n\nfor the requisite period of 5 years in accordance with the requirements of\n\nlaw, what needs to be noted, at the very outset, is that a Review Selection\n\nCommittee has, nowhere, been defined under the Promotion Regulations\n\nor under the 'guidelines', which have been issued by the UPSC. However,\n\nRegulation 2(d)\n of the Promotion Regulations defines a 'Committee' to\n\nmean the Committee set up in accordance with \nRegulation 3\n. In order,\n\ntherefore, to find out as to what a 'Committee' would, in the context of the\n\nPromotion Regulations, mean, one is necessarily required to travel to\n\nRegulation 3\n, which deals with the constitution of the Committee for\n Page 10\n\nmaking recommendation from the State Forest Service (which is being\n\nreferred to as, 'SFS'). The relevant provisions of \nRegulation 3\n read as\n\nunder:\n\n \"3. Constitution of the Committee to make selection-\n\n (1) There shall be constituted for each of the Joint Cadres a Committee\n consisting of the Chairman of the Commission or where the Chairman is\n unable to attend, any other member of the Commission representing and\n the following other members namely:-\n\n (a) For States other than Joint Cadres and Union Territories -\n\n i) The Chief Secretary or Additional Chief Secretary;\n\n ii) Secretary to the Government dealing with Forests;\n\n iii) Principal Chief Conservator of Forests;\n iv) A senior member of the Service not lower in rank\n than a Conservator of Forests; and\n v) A nominee of the Government of India not below\n the rank of a Joint Secretary.\n\n (aa) For Joint Cadre :-\n i) Chief Secretaries to the Governments of the Constituent\n States.\n\n ii) Chief Conservator of Forests of the Constituent States.\n\n ii) A nominee of the Government of India not below the rank of\n a Joint Secretary.\n\n (b) For Union Territories -\n\n (1) Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs dealing with\n Union Territories;\n\n (2) Inspector-General of Forests or Dy. Inspector General of Forests,\n (3) Chief Secretary of one of the Union Territories,\n (4) A Senior member of the Service not lower than in rank than a\n Conservator of Forests:\n\n Provided that the Central Government may, if deemed necessary, after\n consultation with the State Government concerned alter the\n composition of the Committee.\n\n (2) The Chairman or the member of the Commission shall preside at all\n meetings of the committee at which he is present.\n\n Page 11\n\n (3) The absence of a member, other than the Chairman or member of the\n commission, shall not invalidate the proceedings of the Committee if\n more than half the members of the Committee had attended its\n meetings.\"\n\n16. From a bare reading of \nRegulation 3\n, it becomes clear that the\n\nSelection Committee, in order to consider cases of promotion from State\n\nForest Service (i.e., 'SFS') to Indian Forest Service (i.e., 'IFS'), has to be\n\nconstituted in terms of \nRegulation 3\n. As far as the procedures for\n\nselection and preparation of Select list is concerned, the same have been\n\nlaid in \nRegulation 5\n. Mr. Nath, learned counsel, appearing for the\n\npetitioner, is correct in contending that a Review Selection Committee is\n\nnothing, but a Committee constituted under \nRegulation 3\n of the\n\nPromotion Regulations.\n\n17. What logically follows from the above discussion is that a Review\n\nSelection Committee, being a Committee constituted under \nRegulation 3\n,\n\nhas no option but to follow (same as a Committee constituted under\n\nRegulation 3\n) the procedure laid down in \nRegulation 5\n for the purpose of\n\nmaking selection and for preparing select list of officers of the SFS to be\n\npromoted to IFS. A Review Selection Committee, otherwise also, must\n\nproceed to take a decision as regards selection as if it is considering a\n\ngiven case afresh and for the first time. \nThe support, sought to be\n\nreceived, in this regard, by Mr. Nath, learned counsel, from the case of\n\nGurdial Singh Fiji vs. State of Punjab\n, reported in (1979) 2 SCC 368, and\n\nUPSC vs. Hiranyalal Dev (AIR 1988 SC 1069), is not misplaced inasmuch\n\nas the appellant, in \nGurdial Singh Fiji\n's case (supra), was not considered\n Page 12\n\nfor promotion to IAS on the ground of adverse entry in his ACR(s) for the\n\nperiod 1966-67 against which the appellant's representation was pending\n\ndisposal. The Supreme Court held the non-consideration of the\n\nappellant's representation as illegal and directed reconsideration of the\n\nappellant's case by taking into consideration the Govt. decision on his\n\nrepresentation and his service records up to date.\n \nThe relevant\n\nobservations, made by the Supreme Court, in \nGurdial Singh Fiji\n's case\n\n(supra), read as under:\n\n 19. In matters of this nature, particularly when the Select lists have\n\n to be prepared and reviewed from year to year, it becomes difficult\n\n to work out the logical consequences of holding that the case of any\n\n particular officer ought to be reconsidered. But, inevitably, for\n\n reasons mentioned above, the case of the appellant shall have\n\n to be considered afresh by the Selection Committee. How best\n\n to do it has to be left to its wise discretion in the matter of details,\n\n but in order to eliminate, insofar as one may, chances of yet another\n\n litigation we ought to indicate the broad frame-work within which\n\n the Committee should act and the preliminary steps which the\n\n Government must take in order to facilitate the Committee's task.\n\n 20. In the first place, the State Government shall consider and\n\n dispose of within two months from today the representations made\n\n by the appellant on January 23, 1969 and December 19, 1971 in\n\n regard to the adverse report in his confidential roll, for the year\n\n 1966-67. We are hopeful that the High Court will cooperate with\n\n the Government in the disposal of the representations. The\n\n Selection Committee will, within three months thereafter, decide\n\n whether the appellant should be included in the Select list as of\n\n May 11, 1973. That question has to be decided in accordance with\n Page 13\n\n the relevant regulations by applying the test of merit and\n\n suitability cum-seniority. For deciding the question of appellant's\n\n merit and suitability, the Selection Committee will take into\n\n consideration the Government's decision on his representations\n\n and his service record up-to-date. If the Committee decides that he\n\n is not suitable for inclusion in the Select list and, should therefore,\n\n be superseded, it shall record its reasons for the proposed\n\n supersession. If, on the other hand, the Committee decides to\n\n include his name in the Select list, he will be entitled to rank in\n\n that list in accordance with his seniority as of May 11, 1973\n\n unless, in the opinion of the Committee, there is a junior officer of\n\n exceptional merit and suitability who may be assigned a higher\n\n place. The Selection Committee will review the list for 1973 in\n\n accordance with these directions. The Union Public Service\n\n Commission will thereafter be consulted in accordance with\n\n the regulations. The Select list as finally approved by the\n\n Commission will form the Select list of the members of the\n\n State Civil Service.\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n18. The reference made by Mr. Nath, learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\nto the case of Hiranyalal Dev (supra) is also not misplaced wherein the\n\nappellant was not considered suitable for promotion to IPS due to some\n\nadverse entries, which were not communicated to him. Subsequently, the\n\nadverse entries were communicated and the same were expunged after\n\nconsidering the representation of the appellant. The relevant\n\nobservations, appearing at para 5 and 9 of Hiranyalal Dev (supra), read\n\nas under:\n\n Page 14\n\n\"5. It cannot be gainsaid that the Selection Committee could not have\n\ntaken into consideration the adverse remarks entered in the records\n\nwhich had not been communicated to Respondent 1, and in any case\n\ncould not have taken into consideration these remarks which were\n\nsubsequently set aside by the State Government. The legal effect of the\n\nsetting aside of the adverse remarks would be that the remarks must\n\nbe treated as non-existent in the eye of law. The Selection Committee\n\nhad, therefore, fallen in error in taking into account these adverse\n\nremarks which in the eye of law did not exist and which could not\n\nhave been lawfully taken into consideration. However, the fact that the\n\nSelection Committee erred in this behalf does not necessarily mean that\n\nRespondent 1 should have been categorised or considered as \"very good' vis-\n\na-vis others who were also in the field of choice. How to categorise in the light\n\nof the relevant records and what norms to apply in making the assessment are\n\nexclusively the functions of the Selection Committee. The Tribunal could not\n\nmake a conjecture as to what the Selection Committee would have done or to\n\nresort to conjecture as to the norms to be applied for this purpose. The proper\n\norder for the Tribunal to pass under the circumstances was to direct the\n\nSelection Committee to reconsider the merits of Respondent 1 vis-a-vis the\n\nofficial who was junior to him and whose name was Shri Sardar Pradeep Kar.\n\nInstead of doing so, the Tribunal has held that Respondent 1 should be\n\ndeemed to have been included in the impugned select list prepared in 1983, at\n\nleast in the place in the order of his seniority on the basis of the assessment of\n\nhis C.C. Rolls, and has issued a direction to appoint Respondent 1 with effect\n\nfrom the date on which Shri Kar was appointed. The jurisdiction to make the\n\nselection vested in the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee had\n\nto make the selection by applying the same yardstick and norm as\n\nregards the rating to be given to the officials, who were in the field of\n\nchoice by categorising the concerned officials as \"outstanding\", \"very\n\ngood\", \"good\" etc. This function had also to be discharged by the\n\nSelection Committee by applying the same norm and tests and the\n Page 15\n\nselection was also to be made by the Selection Committee as per the\n\nrelevant rules. The powers to make selection were vested unto the Selection\n\nCommittee under the relevant rules and the Tribunal could not have played\n\nthe role which the Selection Committee had to play. The Tribunal could not\n\nhave substituted itself in place of the Selection Committee and made the\n\nselection as if the Tribunal itself was exercising the powers of the Selection\n\nCommittee, as has been done which is evident from the passage extracted from\n\npara 16 of the judgment:\n\n \"We have also gone through the C.C. Roll, of the two junior officers,\n\n Respondents 11 and 12 for the same period of five years including 1982-\n\n 83. We are of the definite view that there is absolutely no reason after\n\n expunction of the adverse remarks to hold that the applicant deserved a\n\n lower classification than these two respondents, who were junior to him.\"\n\nThe proper course to adopt was the course which was indicated by\n\nthis Court in \nGurdial Singh Fijji v. State of Punjab\n wherein this\n\nCourt directed that the case of the appellant be considered afresh by\n\nthe Selection Committee indicating the broad framework within\n\nwhich the Committee should act and the preliminary steps the\n\nGovernment should take in order to facilitate the Committee's task.\n\nIn \nState of Mysore v. Syed Mahmood\n a dispute about promotion of certain\n\nofficers had been raised. In writ petitions filed by the aggrieved officers the\n\nHigh Court passed orders directing the State Government to promote them\n\nfrom the respective dates on which respondents junior to them were\n\npromoted. The orders passed by the High Court were set aside by this Court\n\nand a direction was issued to the State Government to consider whether the\n\nsaid officers should have been promoted on the relevant dates. It was held:\n\n \"The promotions were irregularly made and they were, therefore, entitled\n\nto ask the State Government to reconsider their case. In the circumstances,\n\nthe High Court could issue a writ to the State Government compelling it to\n\nperform its duty and to consider whether having regard to their seniority and\n\nfitness they should have been promoted on the relevant dates when officers\n Page 16\n\n junior to them were promoted. Instead of issuing such a writ, the High Court\n\n wrongly issued writs directing the State Government to promote them with\n\n retrospective effect. The High Court ought not to have issued such writs\n\n without giving the State Government an opportunity in the first instance to\n\n consider their fitness for promotion in 1959.\"\n\n Xxx xxx xxxx\n\n 9. In place of the order quoted hereinabove we substitute an order in the\n\n following terms viz.:\n\n \"The Selection Committee shall reconsider the impugned select list\n\n prepared in 1983 as if it was deciding the matter on the date of the selection\n\n on the footing that the adverse remarks made against Respondent 1 which\n\n were subsequently set aside did not exist in the records and consider the\n\n question as to whether he would have been appointed or Respondent 11 Shri\n\n Sardar Pradeep Kar would have been appointed on the basis of the\n\n categorization to which each of them was entitled having regard to the C.C.\n\n Rolls (ignoring the adverse remarks against Respondent 1 which were\n\n subsequently quashed) and pass appropriate orders in the light of the decision\n\n taken on this point. If Respondent 1's claim is accepted upon reconsideration\n\n in the light of the aforesaid exercise, the order of appointment should provide\n\n for his appointment with effect from the date on which he would have been\n\n appointed if he was selected when the original selection was made in 1983 and\n\n he should be given all the benefits. The Selection Committee shall complete its\n\n exercise within two months from the date of this order. There will be no order\n\n regarding costs.\"\n\n (Emphasis added)\n\n19. Situated thus, it becomes clear that the role of a Review Selection\n\nCommittee is exactly the same as the Selection Committee and the\n\nReview Selection Committee shall be treated as Body constituted under\n Page 17\n\nRegulation 3\n for the purpose of carrying out the selection and making\n\nrecommendations of the officers of the SFS to be promoted to IFS.\n\n20. In the light of what has been discussed above, let us, now, revert to\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n, which lays down as to how a Select Committee shall\n\nproceed with the consideration of a case for promotion from SFS to IFS.\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n reads, \"The selection Committee shall classify the eligible\n\nofficers as 'Outstanding', 'very good', 'good' or 'Unfit', as the case may be,\n\non overall relative assessment of their service record.\"\n\n21. A Selection Committee, be the Committee constituted for the first\n\ntime to consider the cases of promotion or as a Committee, constituted for\n\nthe purpose of review of a case, or a number of cases for promotion, is, in\n\nthe light of \nRegulation 5(3AA)\n, under statutory obligation to classify\n\neligible officers into four categories, as indicated above, namely,\n\n'Outstanding', 'very good', 'good' or 'Unfit', as the case may be, on\n\noverall relative assessment of their service records.\n\n22. The term 'service records', we may hasten to point out, has not been\n\ndefined in the Promotion Regulations. The UPSC has, therefore, issued\n\n'guidelines', which prescribe what service records would mean and signify.\n\nThe UPSC 'guidelines', issued in this regard, and contained in paragraph\n\n2.3, read as follows:\n\n \"2.3 In accordance with \nRegulation 5(4)\n of the Promotion\n\n Regulations, the Selection Committee has to classify the eligible\n\n officers as 'Outstanding', 'very good', 'good' or 'Unfit' as the case\n\n may be on an overall relative assessment of their service records\n Page 18\n\n (i.e., ACRs and the documents kept therein by the competent\n\n authority). For making an overall relative assessment, the\n\n Committee will not depend solely on the grading recorded by\n\n the reporting/reviewing/accepting authority but will make\n\n its independent assessment of the service records of the\n\n eligible officers as per the procedure indicated below.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n23. Coupled with the above, paragraph 4.1 of the UPSC 'guidelines'\n\nread as under:\n\n \"4.1 The Selection Committee will go through the records of\n\n the eligible officers and make their assessment after\n\n deliberating on the quality of the officer as indicated in the\n\n various columns recorded by the Reporting/Reviewing\n\n officer/Accepting Authority in the ACRs for different years\n\n and then finally arrive at the classification to be assigned to\n\n each officer. The Selection Committee would take into account\n\n orders regarding appreciation for the meritorious work done by the\n\n concerned officers. Similarly it would also keep in view orders\n\n awarding penalties or any adverse remarks communicated to the\n\n officer, which, even after due consideration of his representation,\n\n have not been completely expunged.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n24. From what is embodied in paragraph 2.3 of the UPSC 'guidelines', it\n\nclearly transpires that service records will mean not only the ACR(s) of a\n\ncandidate, but also the documents kept/maintained in connection\n\ntherewith by the competent authority and that the Committee,\n\nconstituted under \nRegulation 3\n, will not, in order to make overall relative\n\nassessment, depend solely on the grading recorded by the reporting or\n Page 19\n\nthe reviewing authority, but will make an independent assessment of the\n\nservice records of the eligible officers as per the procedure indicated by the\n\nUPSC 'guidelines'.\n\n25. In terms of the UPSC 'guidelines', the Selection Committee, or the\n\nReview Selection Committee, as the case may be, shall go through the\n\nservice records of each of the eligible officer with special reference to the\n\nperformance of the officers during the last 5 years immediately preceding\n\nthe year for which the select list is required to be prepared, and, upon\n\ndeliberations, make its own assessment of the candidate and record, in\n\nthe assessment sheet, the gradings, which it considers, in the light of\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n, as appropriate.\n\n26. The UPSC's 'guidelines' will clearly indicate that the service records\n\nof each of the officers would have to be considered by the Selection\n\nCommittee with, of course special reference to the performance of the\n\nofficer during the last 5 years, immediately preceding the year for which\n\nthe select list is required to be prepared, and deliberate on the quality of\n\nthe officers and finally arrive at a classification to be assigned to each\n\nofficer in order to ensure objectivity for the purpose of evaluation and\n\nassign accordingly any of the four gradings mentioned in \nRegulation\n\n5(3AA)\n, namely, 'Outstanding', 'very good', 'good' or 'Unfit'.\n\n27. 'Deliberation', according to Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary,\n\n6th Edition, means, 'the process of carefully considering' or 'discussing'.\n\nChambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1979 Edition, defines\n Page 20\n\n'deliberation' as 'act of deliberating, mature reflection'. According to\n\nWebster's Comprehensive Dictionary, Encyclopedic Edition, 'deliberation'\n\nmeans, 'thoughtfulness and care in deciding or acting'.\n\n28. In the light of what the word 'deliberation' means and convey, it\n\nclearly follows, as rightly contended by Mr. Nath, learned counsel, that in\n\norder to satisfy the test of 'overall assessment', there must be a 'careful\n\nconsideration' or careful discussion' on the quality of the officers concerned\n\nwith regard the various attributes recorded in their respective ACR(s)\n\nand, as such, deliberation or discussion must precede the assigning of\n\ngrading by the Selection Committee.\n\n29. It is the admitted case of the UPSC that the petitioner was\n\ncategorized as 'good' on the basis of overall relative assessment of his\n\nperformance, as reflected under various columns of his ACR(s), the\n\nACR(s) being for the period from 2002 to 2003 and 30.09.2004 to\n\n31.03.2005 and, on the basis of the assessment of the petitioner's ACR(s)\n\nfor the said period of barely 1 ½ years, the petitioner was not\n\nrecommended for promotion.\n\n30. Apart from the fact that the above averments of the UPSC, made in\n\nits affidavit, has not been disputed or traversed by any of the other\n\nrespondents, including respondent No. 4, who is hereinafter referred to\n\nas the 'private respondent', the minutes of the meeting of the Review\n\nSelection Committee, constituted under \nRegulation 3\n, to review the select\n\nlist of 2008 and consider, amongst others, the cases of the petitioner and\n Page 21\n\nthe private respondent is, in this regard, of great relevance. Para 3.1, which\n\ncontains the minutes of the meeting of the Review Selection Committee,\n\nbeing extremely important, is reproduced below:\n\n \"3.1 The Committee were further informed that the Government\n\n of Assam have, in compliance with separate orders of the Hon'ble\n\n Tribunal and also based on their representations, forwarded the\n\n upgraded ACRs of\n\n (i) Shri Arup Kumar Das for the year 2002-03 from 'Average'\n\n to 'good' and for the period from 30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005\n\n from 'Average' to 'good'.\n\n (ii) Shri R C Goswami for the period 2002-03, 2003-04, 2004-\n\n 05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 from 'good' to 'very good'.\n\n (iii) Shri Amrit Kumar Das for the period from 14.11.2007 to\n\n 12.03.2008 from 'good' to 'very good'.\"\n\n31. Close on the heels of what paragraph 3.1 of the minutes of the\n\nmeeting of the Review Selection Committee, reproduced above, reflects,\n\nparagraph 5.1 and 5.2, which relate to the present petitioner, and\n\nparagraph 6.1 and 6.2, which relate to the private respondent, being\n\nrelevant for correct appreciation of the manner in which the Review\n\nSelection Committee has dealt with the matter, are also reproduced\n\nbelow:\n\n \"Shri Arup Kumar Das\n\n 5.1 The Review Committee first considered the case of Sh. Arup\n\n Kumar Das. The Review Committee noted that the original Selection\n\n committee has graded Sh. Arup Kumar Das as 'good' on an over-all\n\n relative assessment of his service records.\n\n Page 22\n\n 5.2 The Review Committee examined the records of Sh. Arup\n\n Kumar Das upto the year 2006-07 for the Select list of 2008 as the crucial\n\n date for reckoning the eligibility of officers is 01.01.2008. The Review\n\n Committee took into consideration the upgraded ACRs of Sh. Arup\n\n Kumar Das for the period mentioned in para 3.1 (i) above. On an overall\n\n assessment of his performance as reflected under various columns of the\n\n upgraded ACRs, the Review Committee graded Shri Arup Kumar Das as\n\n 'good'. On the basis of this assessment, the Review Committee did not\n\n recommend any change in the Select list of 2008 prepared on 08.12.2009\n\n in respect of Sh. Arup Kumar Das.\n\n Shri R. C. Goswami\n\n 6.1 The Review Committee next considered the case of Sh. R. C.\n\n Goswami. The Review Committee noted that the original Selection\n\n Committee has graded Sh. R. C. Goswami as \"Good\" on an over-all\n\n relative assessment of his service records.\n\n 6.2 The Review Committee examined the records of Sh. R. C.\n\n Goswami upto the year 2006-07 for the Select list of 2008 as the crucial\n\n date for reckoning the eligibility of officers is 01.01.2008. The Review\n\n Committee took into consideration the upgraded ACRs of Sh. R. C.\n\n Goswami for the period mentioned in para 3.1 (ii) above. On an overall\n\n assessment of his performance reflected under various columns of the\n\n upgraded ACRs, the Review Committee graded Shri R. C. Goswami as\n\n \"Very Good\". On the basis of this assessment, the Review Committee\n\n recommended his name for inclusion in the Select list of 2008 for\n\n promotion to the IFS of Assam Meghalaya Joint Cadre (Assam segment)\n\n and placed his name at Sl. No. 1A of the List prepared on 08.12.2009.\"\n\n32. If the contents of paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2, which relate to the service\n\nrecords of the present petitioner, vis-à-vis paragraph 6.1 and 6.2, which\n\nrelate to the service records of the private respondent, are considered\n Page 23\n\ntogether in the light of what stands recorded in paragraph 3.1 (which we\n\nhave already quoted above), it leaves no room for doubt that that, so far\n\nas the petitioner was concerned, what the Review Selection Committee\n\nhad considered was merely his upgraded ACR(s) for the period 2002-\n\n2003 and for the period from 30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005, i.e., for the period\n\nof 1 ½ years, whereby the downgrading of the petitioner's ACR from\n\n'good' to 'Average' was upgraded and restored to 'good' from 'Average'.\n\nAs against this, the ACR(s) of the private respondent was considered for\n\nthe whole period of 5 years, namely, for the period from 2002 to 2003,\n\n2003 to 2004, 2004 to 2005, 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 2007 and, on the basis\n\nof all these five years of ACRs, he (private respondent) was graded 'very\n\ngood' from 'good'.\n\n33. While, thus, the private respondent's ACRs of all the 5 years,\n\nimmediately preceding the year of selection, had been considered, the\n\npetitioner's ACR of only for the period of 1 ½ years, as indicated above,\n\nhad been considered by the Review Selection Committee.\n\n34. Situated thus, it is clear that the Review Selection Committee\n\ncommitted two errors, namely, (i) it omitted to notice the fact that it was\n\nunder legal obligation to consider the ACRs of the petitioner as well as of\n\nthe private respondent for the entire period of 5 years, including that part\n\nor portion of 5 years, where any change/changes, in the grading,\n\nwas/were recorded in the ACRs and (ii) the Review Selection Committee\n\ncompletely ignored the fact that apart from upgradation of the ACRs of\n Page 24\n\nthe petitioner, for the said period of 1 ½ years (i.e., for the period from\n\n2002 to 2003 and for the period from 30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005), the\n\npetitioner's ACRs, for the period from 01.04.2004 to 29.04.2004 and\n\n18.08.2005 to 05.01.2006, had been subsequently upgraded, as already\n\nindicated above, by order, dated 16.09.2010, inasmuch as the performance\n\nof the petitioner, for the period from 01.04.2004 to 29.09.2004 and also for\n\nthe period from 18.08.2005 to 05.01.2006 (which had gone unappraised),\n\ncame to be recorded, pursuant to the order, dated 16.09.2010, passed by\n\nthe Commissioner and Secretary, Environment and Forest, Government\n\nof Assam, and the petitioner was, pursuant to the order, dated 16.09.2010,\n\nassigned the grading 'very good' for the period from 01.04.2004 to\n\n29.09.2004 and he (petitioner) was graded 'Outstanding' for the period\n\nfrom 18.08.2005 to 05.01.2006.\n\n35. To put it a little differently, the Review Selection Committee\n\nconsidered, unlike the case of the private respondent, the petitioner's\n\nupgraded ACRs for the brief period of 1 ½ years (i.e., from 2002 to 2003\n\nand 30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005), and did not consider the period, which had,\n\ninitially, been left unappraised and was, subsequently, assigned the\n\ngrading of 'very good' and 'Outstanding' pursuant to the order, dated\n\n16.09.2010, aforementioned.\n\n36. In short, the consideration of the petitioner's case by the Review\n\nSelection Committee suffers from infraction of \nRegulation 5(3AA)\n of the\n\nPromotion Regulations inasmuch as the Review Selection Committee has\n Page 25\n\nnot considered the entire service records of the petitioner anew for the\n\nrequisite period of 5 years immediately preceding the year of selection;\n\nmore so, when the Review Selection Committee has, it is obvious, not\n\ntaken into account at all the entries in the ACR(s) of the petitioner for the\n\nearlier unappraised period from 01.04.2004 to 29.09.2004 and 18.08.2005\n\nto 05.01.2006, and, thus, the consideration of the petitioner's case by the\n\nReview Selection Committee must be held to be in violation of the\n\nmandates of the \nRegulation 5(3AA)\n and cannot, therefore, be sustained.\n\n37. To put it a little differently, the Review Selection Committee's\n\nappraisal of the case of the petitioner suffers from omission to consider\n\nthe petitioner's service records for the requisite period of 5 years in its\n\nentirety inasmuch as the Review Selection Committee has considered\n\nonly the petitioner's upgraded ACRs for the year 2002-2003 and for the\n\nperiod from 30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005, but the Review Selection Committee\n\nhas omitted to consider the petitioner's subsequently appraised service\n\nrecords for the period from 01.04.2004 to 29.09.2004 and for the period\n\nfrom 18.08.2005 to 05.01.2006.\n\n38. The learned Tribunal, therefore, fell in serious error, in the case at\n\nhand, in taking the view that the assessment of the petitioner's service\n\nrecord was properly done by the Review Selection Committee; whereas,\n\nit is glaringly noticeable that the Review Selection Committee did not do\n\nwhat it was assigned to do or obliged to do in terms of the Promotion\n Page 26\n\nRegulations and in the light of the 'guidelines', issued, in this regard, by\n\nthe UPSC.\n\n39. Yet another ground on which the petitioner has impugned the\n\nrecommendations of the private respondent by the Review Selection\n\nCommittee and non-recommendation of his case for promotion by the\n\nsaid Committee, in the light of the decision reached by the learned\n\nTribunal, is that during the period of 5 years immediately preceding the\n\nyear of selection, the appropriate authority had not recorded the various\n\nentries in the ACRs of the petitioner. A chart, showing the authorities,\n\nwho had acted in the capacity of the Reporting, Reviewing and the\n\nAccepting authorities, in the ACRs of the petitioner from the year 2002 to\n\n2007, as embodied in the writ petition, is reproduced below:\n\n YEAR REPORTING REVIEWING ACCEPTING\n AUTHORITY AUTHORITY AUTHORITY\n\n2002-03 CCF PCCF PRINCIPAL\n SECRETARY\n1.4.03 to --- COMMISSIONER\n30.7.03 & SECRETARY\n23.9.03 to CF CCF ---\n31.3.04\n1.4.04 to CF CCF ---\n30.9.04\n30.9.04 to CF CCF PCCF\n31.3.05\n1.4.05 to CCF PCCF COMMISSIONER\n17.8.05 & SECRETARY\n18.8.05 to CF CCF ---\n31.3.06\n2006-07 CF CCF PCCF\n Page 27\n\n40. A cautious reading of what have been reproduced above would\n\nshow that the ACRs of the petitioner for the period 2002-2003 was written\n\nby the Chief Conservator of Forests, reviewed by the Principal Chief\n\nConservator of Forests and accepted by the Principal Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Environment and Forests; whereas, the ACR, pertaining to\n\nthe period 23.09.2003 to 31.03.2004, was written by Conservator of\n\nForests, reviewed by Chief Conservator of Forests and accepted by the\n\nCommissioner & Secretary, and with regard to the petitioner's ACR for\n\nthe period from 01.04.2005 to 17.08.2005, it was again the Chief\n\nConservator of Forests, who had acted as the Reporting authority, the\n\nReviewing and the Accepting authorities being Principal Chief\n\nConservator of Forests and the Commissioner and Secretary, Department\n\nof Environment and Forests. However, for the period from 30.09.2004 to\n\n31.03.2005, the Reporting authority was, once again, the Conservator of\n\nForests, the Reviewing authority was the Chief Conservator of Forests\n\nand the Accepting authority was the Principal Chief Conservator of\n\nForests.\n\n41. The question, therefore, which falls for consideration, is: Whether,\n\nin the petitioner's case, the Conservator of Forests could have acted as the\n\nReporting authority, or it was the Chief Conservator of Forest, who ought\n\nto have been the Reporting authority?\n\n42. While considering the question, posed above, we may refer to Rule\n\n2(f) of the Assam Services (Confidential Rolls) Rules, 1990 (hereinafter\n Page 28\n\nreferred to as the '1990 Rules'), which defines 'Reporting authority' as the\n\nauthority, who was, during the period for which the confidential report is\n\nwritten, immediate superior to the employee and such other authority as\n\nmay be specifically empowered, in this behalf, by the Government.\n\nSimilarly, 'Reviewing authority' is defined by Rule 2(g) of the 1990 Rules to\n\nmean the authority, who was, during the period for which the\n\nconfidential report is written, immediate superior to the Reporting\n\nauthority and such other authority as may be specifically empowered, in\n\nthis behalf, by the Government. Rule 2(a) of the 1990 Rules defines\n\n'Accepting authority' as the authority, who was, during the period for\n\nwhich the confidential report is written, immediate superior to the\n\nReviewing authority and such other authority as may be specifically\n\nempowered, in this behalf, by the Government.\n\n43. The petitioner, as has been pointed out, is presently serving as\n\nDivisional Forest Officer (in short, 'DFO') and he, therefore, belongs to\n\nthe cadre of Deputy Conservator of Forest (in short, 'DCF'). The\n\nimmediate superior of a DCF is the Conservator of Forests (in short, 'CF')\n\nand, as such, only CF can initiate confidential reports of a DCF. Similarly,\n\nthe immediate superior of CF is the Chief Conservator of Forest (in short,\n\n'CCF') and the immediate superior of CCF is the Principal Chief\n\nConservator of Forest (in short, 'PCCF'). Accordingly, only CCF and\n\nPCCF can act as the Reviewing and Accepting authority, respectively, in\n\nrespect of a DCF.\n\n Page 29\n\n44. However, in the case at hand, the ACR(s) of the petitioner were\n\nreported/reviewed and accepted by authorities other than the authorities,\n\nwho were empowered and authorized by the Rules to do so.\n\nConsequently, the ACR(s), prepared by such authorities, as indicated\n\nhereinbefore, can not, rightly contends Mr. Nath, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, form basis for making assessment of the merit of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n45. In support of his contention that the ACR(s), in respect of a DFO can\n\nonly be written by the CF, reviewed and accepted by CCF and PCCF,\n\nrespectively, Mr. Nath has also placed reliance on the case of T N\n\nGodavarman vs. Union of India, reported in (2007) 15 SCC 273. The\n\nrelevant observations, made by the Supreme Court, in T N Godavarman\n\n(supra), read as follows:\n\n \"22. For writing of the confidential reports, the Central\n\n Government has, under \nSection 3\n of the All India Services Act,\n\n 1951, framed All India Services (Confidential Rolls) Rules, 1970.\n\n According to Rule 2(e), the \"reporting authority\" is defined as\n\n follows:\n\n 2. (e) 'reporting authority' means the authority who was, during\n\n the period for which the confidential report is written, immediately\n\n superior to the member of the service and such other authority as\n\n may be specifically empowered in this behalf by the Government;\"\n\n 23. The \"reviewing authority\" is defined in Rule 2(f) as follows:\n\n 2. (f) 'reviewing authority' means the authority who was, during\n\n the period for which the confidential report is written, immediately\n Page 30\n\nsuperior to the reporting authority and such other authority as may\n\nbe specifically empowered in this behalf by the Government;\"\n\n 24. It seems that Rule 2(e) had been interpreted by the State\n\nto mean that the confidential report of an officer could be written\n\nby a person who is superior to him and also by such other officer\n\nwho may be specified in this behalf. In view of the latter portion of\n\nthe said Rule 2(e), the State Government has authorised officers of\n\nservice other than of the Forest Department to write the\n\nconfidential reports. In this manner, in effect, the administrative\n\ncontrol of officers belonging to the Forest Department is not within\n\nthe Department itself.\n\n25. The aforesaid Rule 2(e) came up for consideration before this\n\nCourt in \nState of Haryana v. P.C. Wadhwa\n. While interpreting the\n\nsaid Rule 2(e), this Court at p. 1035 observed as follows: (SCC pp.\n\n606-07, para 5)\n\n5. In this connection, it may be pointed out that it is not disputed\n\nthat the conjunction 'and' occurring in clauses (e), (f) and (a)\n\nshould be read as 'or'. Under clause (e), the 'reporting authority'\n\nmay be either immediately superior to the member of the service or\n\nsuch other authority as may be specifically empowered in this\n\nbehalf by the Government. The expression 'immediately superior'\n\nobviously indicates that the reporting authority should be the\n\nimmediate superior officer in the same service to which the member\n\nof the service belongs. The position is the same as in the cases of\n\n'reviewing authority' and 'accepting authority'. So, under the first\n\npart of clause (e), the reporting authority of the respondent could be\n\na person who is immediately superior to him in the police service.\"\n\n26. It appears to us, and which is logical, that up to the officer of\n\nthe rank of Additional Principal Chief Conservator of\n\nForests the reporting authority has to be the immediately\n\nsuperior officer within the Forest Department. For example,\n Page 31\n\n for the Assistant Conservator of Forests, the reporting authority\n\n can only be the Divisional Forest Officer and for him the reporting\n\n authority would be the Conservator of Forests for whom the\n\n reporting authority has to be the Chief Conservator of Forests and\n\n his reporting authority would be Additional Principal Chief\n\n Conservator of Forests and lastly his reporting authority would be\n\n the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests. Likewise the reviewing\n\n authority would also be the person within the same Department. It\n\n is only in case of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests\n\n that the reporting authority will be a person other than the\n\n one belonging to the service because there is no one superior\n\n to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests within the\n\n service. As far as he is concerned, the reporting authority would be\n\n a person who is familiar with the work of Principal Chief\n\n Conservator of Forests and that will be the person to whom he\n\n reports and who is superior to him in rank and hierarchy.\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n46. Mr. S. Sharma, learned counsel for the private respondent, has\n\ncontended that the petitioner's ACR(s) for the period 2003-2004 was\n\nreviewed by PCCF and accepted by the Principal Secretary, because\n\nduring the relevant period, the petitioner was in the Wild Life Wing of\n\nthe Department; whereas the ACR, pertaining to the period from\n\n30.09.2004 to 31.03.2005, was reviewed by CCF and accepted by PCCF,\n\nbecause during the period, in question, the petitioner had been working\n\nin the Research and Education Wing of the Department.\n\n47. Controverting the above submissions, made on behalf of the private\n\nrespondent, it has been submitted, on behalf of the petitioner, that the\n Page 32\n\nvarious wings, such as, Wild Life, Territorial, Social Forestry, Research\n\nand Education, etc., are only wings of the Forest Department and the\n\nimmediate superior of a DCF shall always be CF irrespective of any wing\n\nof the Department. A superior officer, in the context of a DCF, does not\n\ndiffer from wing to wing and, hence, the whole contention of the private\n\nrespondent, raised, in this regard, has no foundation, erroneous and is\n\nliable to be rejected.\n\n48. It has been further contended, on behalf of the petitioner, that the\n\nfact, that the contention of the private respondent has no foundation, falls\n\nflat in view of the fact that the ACR of the petitioner, for the period\n\n01.04.2005 to 17.08.2005 (i.e., the period immediately succeeding\n\n30.09.2004 - 31.03.2005), was reviewed by the PCCF and accepted by the\n\nCommissioner and Secretary in spite of the fact that during the said\n\nperiod, the petitioner had been still working in Research and Education\n\nwing of the Department concerned.\n\n49. In the light of the 1990 Rules, the petitioner's ACR(s) were clearly\n\nnot written by the appropriate authorities acting as Reporting authority,\n\nReviewing authority and Accepting authority. When the petitioner's\n\nACR(s) have been written by the authorities other than competent\n\nauthorities, the assessment of the merit of the petitioner, the entries and\n\nthe gradings, which had been given by the authorities not competent to\n\nact as the Reporting, Reviewing and Accepting authorities, were bad in\n\nlaw and ought not to have been considered, while considering the\n Page 33\n\npetitioner's case for promotion. These aspects of the case appear to have\n\nescaped not only the notice of the Review Selection Committee, but also\n\nof the learned Tribunal. On the basis of the ACR(s) written by the\n\nauthorities, who were not competent to writ the petitioner's ACR(s),\n\nquestion of consideration of a valid selection, for the purpose of\n\npromotion, from SFS to IFS would not arise.\n\n50. It is further contended, on behalf of the petitioner, that the ACR(s)\n\nof the petitioner were not communicated to him, at any point of time by\n\nthe Committee, which was contrary to the law \nlaid down by\n the Supreme\n\nCourt in \nDev Dutt vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2008) 8 SCC 725.\n\nRelying upon the case of \nDev Dutt\n (supra), Mr. Nath, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner, correctly submits that, in terms of the decision, rendered in\n\nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), all ACR(s) of the employees need to be\n\ncommunicated to the employee concerned, within a reasonable period of\n\ntime, whether there is benchmark or not and non-communication of the\n\nsame is arbitrary and violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe relevant paragraphs of the decision of the Supreme Court, in \nDev\n\nDutt\n's case (supra), read as under:\n\n \n\"12. It has been held in \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n that\n\n arbitrariness violates \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. In our opinion, the\n\n non-communication of an entry in the ACR of a public servant is\n\n arbitrary because it deprives the employee concerned from making a\n\n representation against it and praying for its upgradation. In our opinion,\n\n every entry in the annual confidential report of every employee under the\n\n State, whether he is in civil, judicial, police or other service (except the\n Page 34\n\nmilitary) must be communicated to him, so as to enable him to make a\n\nrepresentation against it, because non-communication deprives the\n\nemployee of the opportunity of making a representation against it which\n\nmay affect his chances of being promoted (or get some other benefits).\n\nMoreover, the object of writing the confidential report and making entries\n\nin them is to give an opportunity to a public servant to improve his\n\nperformance, vide \nState of U.P. v. Yamuna Shanker Misra\n. Hence such\n\nnon-communication is, in our opinion, arbitrary and hence violative of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n13. In our opinion, every entry (and not merely a poor or adverse entry)\n\nrelating to an employee under the State or an instrumentality of the State,\n\nwhether in civil, judicial, police or other service (except the military) must\n\nbe communicated to him, within a reasonable period, and it makes no\n\ndifference whether there is a benchmark or not. Even if there is no\n\nbenchmark, non-communication of an entry may adversely affect the\n\nemployee's chances of promotion (or getting some other benefit), because\n\nwhen comparative merit is being considered for promotion (or some other\n\nbenefit) a person having a \"good\" or \"average\" or \"fair\" entry certainly\n\nhas less chances of being selected than a person having a \"very good\" or\n\n\"outstanding\" entry.\n\n17. In our opinion, every entry in the ACR of a public servant must be\n\ncommunicated to him within a reasonable period, whether it is a poor, fair,\n\naverage, good or very good entry. This is because non-communication of\n\nsuch an entry may adversely affect the employee in two ways: (1) had the\n\nentry been communicated to him he would know about the assessment of\n\nhis work and conduct by his superiors, which would enable him to\n\nimprove his work in future; (2) he would have an opportunity of making a\n\nrepresentation against the entry if he feels it is unjustified, and pray for its\n\nupgradation. Hence, non-communication of an entry is arbitrary, and it\n\nhas been held by the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in \nManeka\n Page 35\n\nGandhi v. Union of India\n that arbitrariness violates \nArticle 14\n of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n18. Thus, it is not only when there is a benchmark but in all cases that an\n\nentry (whether it is poor, fair, average, good or very good) must be\n\ncommunicated to a public servant, otherwise there is violation of the\n\nprinciple of fairness, which is the soul of natural justice. Even an\n\noutstanding entry should be communicated since that would boost the\n\nmorale of the employee and make him work harder.\n\n36. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice\n\nby holding that fairness and transparency in public administration\n\nrequires that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in\n\nthe annual confidential report of a public servant, whether in civil,\n\njudicial, police or any other State service (except the military), must be\n\ncommunicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a\n\nrepresentation for its upgradation. This in our opinion is the correct legal\n\nposition even though there may be no rule/G.O. requiring communication\n\nof the entry, or even if there is a rule/G.O. prohibiting it, because the\n\nprinciple of non-arbitrariness in State action as envisaged by \nArticle 14\n of\n\nthe Constitution in our opinion requires such communication. \nArticle 14\n\nwill override all rules or government orders.\n\n37. We further hold that when the entry is communicated to him the\n\npublic servant should have a right to make a representation against the\n\nentry to the authority concerned, and the authority concerned must decide\n\nthe representation in a fair manner and within a reasonable period. We\n\nalso hold that the representation must be decided by an authority higher\n\nthan the one who gave the entry, otherwise the likelihood is that the\n\nrepresentation will be summarily rejected without adequate consideration\n\nas it would be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. All this would be\n\nconducive to fairness and transparency in public administration, and\n\nwould result in fairness to public servants. The State must be a model\n Page 36\n\n employer, and must act fairly towards its employees. Only then would\n\n good governance be possible.\n\n 41. In our opinion, non-communication of entries in the annual\n\n confidential report of a public servant, whether he is in civil,\n\n judicial, police or any other service (other than the military),\n\n certainly has civil consequences because it may affect his chances for\n\n promotion or get other benefits (as already discussed above). Hence, such\n\n non-communication would be arbitrary, and as such violative of\n\n \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n51. A bare reading of the observations, made by the Supreme Court in\n\nthe above quoted paragraphs, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), makes it clear\n\nthat the ACR(s), which have not been communicated to a person\n\nconcerned, can not be taken into consideration by any Selection\n\nCommittee, while examining his/her case for promotion.\n \nHowever, the\n\nSupreme Court has \nlaid down, in\n \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), that in the\n\nevent of non-communication of the ACR(s) to the employee concerned\n\nfor any reason, such ACR(s) are to be communicated to the employee\n\nconcerned at the stage of consideration of his/her case for promotion\n\nenabling the employee concerned to make representation against the\n\nentry, which needs to be fairly considered following which his/her case\n\nneeds to be reconsidered by the Review Selection Committee.\n \nThe ratio\n,\n\nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), squarely\n\napplies to the case at hand inasmuch as the adverse entries, in the ACR(s)\n\nof the petitioner, were not communicated to the petitioner before\n Page 37\n\nconsideration of his case, for promotion, by the Review Selection\n\nCommittee.\n\n52. From the decision, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), it becomes\n\nabundantly clear that making of any effective representation by an\n\nemployee requires communication of the entries, made in his/her ACR(s),\n\nwhich would include not only the gradings, assigned to the employee, but\n\nalso the remarks made on various components of performance of the\n\nemployee concerned and consideration of the grading, assigned to him,\n\nmust precede submission of any representation, if made, by the employee\n\nconcerned so as to enable the employee concerned make effective\n\nrepresentation.\n\n53. Though the learned Tribunal has proceeded on the premises that\n\nthe petitioner had been communicated the entries of his ACR(s), the\n\nlearned Tribunal, we find, has failed to notice that the entries, in some of\n\nthe ACR(s), had been obtained by the petitioner on the basis of the\n\napplication, made by the petitioner under the \nRight to Information Act,\n\n2005\n, and the same had not been communicated to the petitioner by the\n\nauthorities concerned. The petitioner's case, therefore, suffers from, in\n\nfact, infraction of the law laid down, and the directions given, in \nDev\n\nDutt\n's case (supra).\n\n54. Clearly, therefore, when the petitioner made his representation, on\n\n19.07.2010, seeking review of his ACR(s), he had no idea as to what had\n\nbeen made in his ACR(s) and this fact is clearly discernible if one cares to\n Page 38\n\nread the petitioner's representation. The relevant portion of the\n\npetitioner's representation, dated 19.07.2010, read as follows:\n\n \n\"To,\n\n The Commissioner and Secretary to the Govt. of Assam,\n Environment and Forest Department, Dispur, Guwahati-6.\n\n Sub Thorough Review of my ACR's for the Financial years 2000-2001,\n 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2005-2006.\n\n Ref. My earlier letter No. AKD/1/Confidential/7 dtd. 15/07/2010.\n\n Respected Sir,\n\n In continuation to my earlier letter No. \nreferred above\n with\n\n reference to the above subject I have honour to request you kindly to\n\n review my ACR's for the period (2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003,\n\n 2003-2004 and 2005-2006) as I suspect that during the years the ACR's\n\n written by respective Recording/Reviewing officers sent to UPSC and\n\n MOEF was initiated in such a way that I should not be inducted into\n\n Indian Forest Service as the grades given was more or less as an adverse\n\n ACR. Because these years were crucial for the select list prepared by\n\n UPSC for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and got myself deprived in every\n\n selection.\n\n \nAs \nreferred above\n, since I did not have any access to the\n\n confidential Rolls prepared by the authorities I had presumed that\n\n everything recorded was with higher grades the good assessment,\n\n as I have neither been informed verbally or nor intimated in\n\n writing regarding any poor performance in any form for the years\n\n stated above also substantial evidence if there was any to improve\n\n my skills for getting better grades which was a systematic way of\n\n spoiling my career. But now I have realized that the ACRs prepared\n\n during the years \nreferred above\n were written in casual and superficial and\n\n without proper weightage in upgraded form which led to debar me from\n\n selection to the Indian Forest Service.\n\n Page 39\n\n Therefore, I request you humbly to get my ACRs properly\n\n Reviewed and Rectified so that I may be considered to be included to the\n\n IFS selection and get natural justice from your end as I have still faith and\n\n confidence in your abilities so that I may continue with a better zeal in the\n\n remaining part of my service career.\n\n Yours faithfully,\n\n s/d--\n\n (A. K. Das), D.F.O,\n Govt. T.T.S. Plant Division\n Makum, Tinsukia\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n55. As the communication of the entries in the ACR(s) is, in the light of\n\nthe decision, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), sine qua non in order to enable\n\nthe employee concerned make effective representation, it is clear that the\n\npetitioner did not have any idea, on the date of making of the\n\nrepresentation, i.e., 19.07.2010, about the fact that the entries, made in his\n\nACR(s), including the gradings awarded to him, were not adverse in\n\nnature inasmuch as any grading, assigned to an officer, in the light of\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n, would be treated, in the light of the decision, in \nDev\n\nDutt\n's case (supra), as an adverse entry. In fact, suspecting that his\n\nACR(s) had not been properly recorded, the petitioner had asked for the\n\nreview thereof. As the entries had not been communicated to the\n\npetitioner before the petitioner had made the representation, the learned\n\nTribunal ought to have held that the petitioner was denied the right to\n\nmake effective representation against the various entries, made in his\n\nACR(s), during the past 5 years, in question, and the petitioner was,\n\ntherefore, seriously prejudiced.\n\n Page 40\n\n56. We consider it incumbent upon us to point out, with regard to the\n\nabove, that the personal hearing, which had been afforded to the\n\npetitioner on his representation, dated 19.07.2010, aforementioned, did\n\nnot cure the incurable defect of non-communication of the entries in the\n\nACR(s) to the petitioner in terms of the decision in \nDev Dutt\n's case\n\n(supra). It would be idle for the authority concerned to hear an employee\n\nif he is not communicated the entries made in his ACR(s).\n\n57. \nIn support of his submission that the decision, in \nDev Dutt\n's case\n\n(supra), covers the case of the petitioner, Mr. N. Nath, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner, contends that a judicial pronouncement, on an issue of\n\nlaw, is always retrospective in operation unless the decision itself makes\n\nthe operation of the law, so pronounced, prospective. In fact, prospective\n\nlaying down of a law is a device innovated by the Supreme Court to\n\navoid reopening of settled issues and multiplicity of proceedings.\n \nIn \nDev\n\nDutt\n's case (supra), the Supreme Court, in its own wisdom and\n\ndiscretion, did not make its operation prospective and, accordingly, the\n\nratio\n, \nlaid down in\n \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), could only be applied\n\nretrospectively.\n \nMr. Nath, learned counsel, further contends, and rightly\n\nso, that even assuming that the law\n, \nlaid down in\n \nDev Dutt\n's case\n\n(supra), is prospective, the same would still apply to the present case\n\ninasmuch as \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra) was decided on 12th May, 2008, and\n\nthe Selection Committee, in the case at hand, met on 08.12.2009 and the\n\nReview Selection Committee met on 09.12.2011.\n\n Page 41\n\n58. Controverting the finding of the learned Tribunal, that the ACR(s)\n\nhad been duly communicated to the petitioner and that on the basis of\n\nsuch communicated ACR(s), the petitioner had filed representation,\n\ndated 19.07.2010, Mr. Nath, learned counsel for the petitioner, has also\n\npointed out, with great justification, that this finding of the learned\n\nTribunal is wholly erroneous inasmuch as the petitioner's representation\n\nitself shows that he was not privy to his ACR(s) at the time of filing of his\n\nrepresentation and that the finding of the learned Tribunal seems to have\n\nbeen influenced by the fact that the petitioner had annexed a few ACR(s)\n\nto his representation in order to substantiate his claims, but the learned\n\nTribunal ought to have taken note of the fact that the petitioner had\n\nobtained the copies of his ACR(s) under the \nRight To Information Act,\n\n2005\n. Further-more, the fact that the petitioner came to know about the\n\ndowngrading of the entry, in his ACR(s), from 'good' to 'Average' for the\n\nperiod 2002-2003 in April, 2010, only is, in itself, a testimony of the fact\n\nthat the ACR(s) of the petitioner had never been communicated to him.\n\n59. While considering the rival submissions with regard to the non-\n\ncommunication of the entries in the ACR(s) to the petitioner, it is\n\nnoteworthy that the respondents/authorities concerned did neither file\n\nany written statement before the learned Tribunal nor have they filed any\n\naffidavit, before this Court, controverting the contentions of the petitioner\n\nregarding non-communication of the entries in his ACR(s) to him.\n\n Page 42\n\n60. We deem it apposite to point out, at this juncture, that the scope of\n\njudicial review is limited in matters of selection. However, it is\n\nincumbent and obligatory, on the Courts and the Tribunals, to interfere,\n\nwhen the process of assessment and recommendation is vitiated by mala\n\nfide, or bias, or violation of the statutory rules and regulations, or when\n\nthe process of assessment suffers from arbitrariness or from error\n\napparent on the face of the record. Reference may be made, in this\n\nregard, to the case of M V Thimmaiah vs. UPSC & Ors, reported in\n\n(2008) 2 SCC 119, wherein the Supreme Court held as under:\n\n \"21. Now, comes the question with regard to the selection of the\n\n candidates. Normally, the recommendations of the Selection Committee\n\n cannot be challenged except on the ground of mala fides or serious violation of\n\n the statutory rules. The courts cannot sit as an Appellate Authority to\n\n examine the recommendations of the Selection Committee like the\n\n court of appeal. This discretion has been given to the Selection\n\n Committee only and courts rarely sit as a court of appeal to examine\n\n the selection of the candidates nor is the business of the court to examine each\n\n candidate and record its opinion.\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n61. We may also refer to the case of \nUnion of India vs. A K Narula\n,\n\nreported in (2007) 11 SCC 10, wherein the Supreme Court held, in\n\nparagraph 15, as under:\n\n \n\"15. The 'guidelines' give a certain amount of play in the joints to DPC\n\n by providing that it need not be guided by the overall grading recorded in\n\n CRs, but may make its own assessment on the basis of the entries in CRs.\n\n DPC is required to make an overall assessment of the performance of each\n\n candidate separately, but by adopting the same standards, yardsticks and\n Page 43\n\n norms. It is only when the process of assessment is vitiated either\n\n on the ground of bias, mala fides or arbitrariness, that the\n\n selection calls for interference. Where DPC has proceeded in a fair,\n\n impartial and reasonable manner, by applying the same yardstick and\n\n norms to all candidates and there is no arbitrariness in the process of\n\n assessment by DPC, the court will not interfere (vide SBI v. Mohd.\n\n Mynuddin, UPSC v. Hiranyalal Dev and \nBadrinath v. Govt. of T.N.\n).\n\n The Review DPC reconsidered the matter and has given detailed reasons\n\n as to why the case of the respondent was not similar to that of R.S. Virk. If\n\n in those circumstances, the Review DPC decided not to change the\n\n grading of the respondent for the period 1-4-1987 to 31-3-1988 from\n\n \"good\" to \"very good\", the overall grading of the respondent continued to\n\n remain as \"good\". There was no question of moving him from the block of\n\n officers with the overall rating of \"good\" to the block of officers with the\n\n overall rating of \"very good\" and promoting him with reference to DPC\n\n dated 13-6-1990. In the absence of any allegation of mala fide or bias\n\n against DPC and in the absence of any arbitrariness in the manner in\n\n which assessment has been made, the High Court was not justified in\n\n directing that the benefit of upgrading be given to the respondent, as was\n\n done in the case of R.S. Virk.\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n62. When considered as a whole, what emerges from the above\n\ndiscussion is that fairness is an essential ingredient of all administrative\n\nactions including a selection process. We may refer, in this regard, to the\n\ncase of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences -vs- Dr.\n\nK. Kalyana Raman and Others, reported in (1992) Supp (2) SCC 481,\n\nwherein it has been held that the function, performed by a Selection\n\nCommittee, is administrative in nature.\n\n Page 44\n\n63. In the present case, therefore, it is imperative that the review\n\nselection be fair and fairness demands that the Review Selection\n\nCommittee follows the procedure in letter and spirit as \nlaid down in\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n of the Promotion Regulations. Strangely enough,\n\nhowever, the Review Selection Committee acted, in the present case,\n\nmechanically without even realizing that it was not considering, contrary\n\nto the requirements of \nRegulation 5 (3AA)\n, the petitioner's ACRs of 5\n\nyears immediately preceding the year of selection. The Selection\n\nCommittee also failed to note that the petitioner's ACR(s) had been\n\nwritten substantially by persons, who were not competent to act as\n\nReporting, Reviewing and/or Accepting authorities. \nThe Review\n\nSelection Committee further did not question and/or try to find out if the\n\nadverse entries, in the ACR(s) of the petitioner, (in the light of the\n\ndecision, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), which, on the date of consideration\n\nof the petitioner's case by the Review Selection Committee, held the\n\nfield), had been communicated to the petitioner or not.\n \nEven the learned\n\nTribunal has completely failed to note that the petitioner had not been\n\ncommunicated, contrary to the decision, in \nDev Dutt\n's case (supra), the\n\nentries in the ACR(s) of the requisite period of 5 years in order to enable\n\nhim to make effective representation against the entries, which were\n\ninjurious to the consideration of the petitioner's case for promotion.\n\n64. Because of what have been discussed and pointed out above, we\n\nhave no hesitation in holding that the impugned review, which the\n Page 45\n\nReview Selection Committee had conducted, was contrary to law and all\n\nthe issues, raised by the petitioner and discussed by us above, need to be\n\naddressed by the State respondents, in general, and the UPSC, in\n\nparticular.\n\n65. Before, however, we close the discussion on the case, which the\n\npetitioner has set up, and issue necessary direction(s), we need to point\n\nout that in the light of the amendments, which the Indian Forest Service\n\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1966, (which we have been\n\nreferring to as the Promotion Regulations), underwent by Notification,\n\ndated 20.04.1966, the 'guidelines', which have been issued by the UPSC\n\nand which have been the subject of discussion in this writ petition, need a\n\nreview by the UPSC, particularly, with regard to the system of\n\n'interpolation' of the names in the select list after a review takes place.\n\n66. In order to make explicit what have been indicated above, we must\n\nreiterate that the Promotion Regulations provide for appointment of\n\nmembers of the State Forest Service to the Indian Forest Service by\n\npromotion. \nRegulation 5\n of the said Regulations provides for preparation\n\nof a list of suitable officers. While \nRegulation 5(2)\n provides for zone of\n\nconsideration and eligibility of the members of the State Forest Service,\n\nRegulation 5\n(3-AA) and \nRegulation 5(4)\n provide for the relative\n\nassessment of merit and preparation of merit wise list respectively.\n\nRegulation 5(3AA)\n and \nRegulation 5(4)\n being relevant, are reproduced\n\nbelow:\n\n Page 46\n\n \"5. Preparation of a list of suitable officers :-\n\n(1) *** *** ***\n *** *** ***\n(2) *** *** ***\n *** *** ***\n3(A) *** *** ***\n *** *** ***\n3(AA) The Selection Committee shall classify the eligible officers\n\nas 'Outstanding', 'good', 'very good' or 'Unfit' , as the case may be, on all\nrelative assessment of their service records.\n\n(4) The list shall be prepared by including the required number of\n names, first from amongst the officers finally classified as\n 'Outstanding' then from amongst those similarly classified as\n 'very good' and thereafter from amongst those similarly classified\n as 'good' and the order the names inter-se within each category\n shall be in the order of their seniority in the State Forest Service.\n\n Provided that the name of an officer so included in the list shall be treated as\nprovisional if the State Government withholds the integrity certificate in respect\nof such an officer or any proceedings, departmental or criminal, are pending\nagainst him or anything adverse against him which renders him unsuitable for\nappointment to the service has come to the notice of the State Government.\nProvided further that while preparing year-wise select lists for more than one\nyear pursuant to the second proviso to sub-regulation (1), the officer included\nprovisionally in any of the select list so prepared, shall be considered for\ninclusion in the select list of subsequent year in addition to the normal\nconsideration zone an din case he is found fit for inclusion in the suitability list\nfor that year on a provisional basis, such inclusion shall be in addition to the\nnormal size of the select list determined by the Central Government for such\nyear.\n\nExplanation I : The proceedings shall be treated as pending only if a\n charge-sheet has actually been issued to the officer or filed in a\n Court, as the case may be\nExplanation II : The adverse thing which came to the notice of the State\nGovernment rendering him unsuitable for appointment to the service shall be\ntreated as having come to the notice of the State only if the details of the same\nhave been communicated to the Central Government and the Central\nGovernment is satisfied that the details furnished by the State Government have\na bearing on the suitability of the officer and investigation thereof is essential.\n\n Page 47\n\n (5) Omitted.\"\n (Emphasis added)\n\n67. A careful perusal of the Regulations reveals that \nRegulation 5(2)\n,\n\nprior to its amendment by Notification No. 11039/2/76 AIS (I)-G, dated\n\n20.04.1976, provided that merit and suitability in all respect with due\n\nregard to seniority shall be the criterion for the selection to the Indian\n\nForest Service. The identical unamended Regulations of the Indian\n\nAdministrative Services (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1955,\n\nas quoted in paragraph 5 of the decision rendered in \nUnion of India\n\nversus M. L. Kapoor\n, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 836, are reproduced\n\nbelow:\n\n \"5. *** *** ***\n\n 5.

The decision, in \nM.L. Kapoor\n's case (supra), shows that according\n\nto the un-amended \nRegulation 5\n of the Indian Administrative Service\n\n(Appointment by Promotion) Regulation, 1955, promotion ought to have\n\nbeen, ordinarily, in terms of seniority unless any junior officer, in the\n\nopinion of the Selection Committee, constituted by the UPSC, was found\n\nto be of exceptional merit and suitability inasmuch as such a junior\n\nofficer, on the basis of his exceptional merit and suitability, could be\n\nplaced, rather, ought to have been placed, in the select list, at a position\n\nhigher than that of an officer, who might have been senior to the junior\n\nofficer concerned.\n\n69. It is pointed out by Mr. D.K. Mishra, learned Amicus Curiae, that\n\nthe expression 'merit cum suitability with due regard to seniority', was\n\nconsidered by a learned Single Judge of this Court in \nRamen Ch. Kalita\n\nVs. State of Assam\n, reported in 2003 (3) GLT 369.\n \nThe learned Single\n\nJudge, relying on the decision, rendered in \nM.L. Kapoor\n (supra),\n\nobserved and held, at paragraph 10, as follows:\n\n \" ( 10 ) In the light of the above discussions, the parameters applied while\n\n making the impugned selection, do not appear to conform to the principle\n\n of merit and suitability with due regard to seniority as prescribed by the\n\n rules in force. The correct meaning of the expression, \"merit and\n\n suitability with due regard to the seniority\", having regard to the context\n Page 49\n\n of the Rules in force and keeping in mind the earlier Rules holding the\n\n field, would be that though the criteria of merit and suitability with due\n\n regard to seniority is essentially a merit based criterion, seniority cannot\n\n altogether be ignored and has to be considered parallely along\n\n with merit while determining the eligibility of a candidate for his\n\n inclusion in the select list. Though it would not be the duty of the court\n\n to lay down the exact modalities to cover selection by application of said\n\n criteria, it may be apposite to observe that out of the total marks\n\n earmarked for assessment, say out of 100 marks, a particular percentage\n\n can be assigned to merit and the remaining percentage to seniority. The\n\n percentage prescribed for merit must necessarily be higher than the\n\n percentage prescribed for seniority, as this court has already held that the\n\n expression in question convey primarily a merit based assessment. What\n\n marks should be given to seniority can also be worked out by taking into\n\n account each year of completed service and on that basis the necessary\n\n fusion between merit and seniority can be reached. Having reached the\n\n aforesaid conclusion, this court cannot but hold that the parameters\n\n applied in the selection on 23.7. 2002 do not conform to what was\n\n required to be followed by applying the principle of \"merit and suitability\n\n with due regard to the seniority\". The impugned selection and the\n\n consequential promotion order dated 19. 9. 2002 therefore, will have to be\n\n set aside, which I hereby do.\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n70. It is submitted by the learned Amicus Curiae, with great\n\njustification, that \nSarat Kumar Dash v. Biswajit Patnaik\n, reported in 1995\n\nSuppl.\n \n(1) SCC 434, was not placed before the learned Single Judge in\n\nRamen Ch. Kalita\n (supra).\n \nIn the case of \nSarat Kumar Dash\n (supra), the\n\nexpression 'merit cum suitability with due regard to seniority' fell for\n\nconsideration.\n \nThe argument put forward by the counsel for the appellant\n Page 50\n\nwas accepted by the Supreme Court, in \nSarat Kumar Dash\n (supra), that\n\neven in case of merit cum suitability with due regard to seniority, seniority has\n\nno role to play, if the junior is more meritorious.\n \nThe relevant portion of\n\nthe decision, in \nSarat Kumar Dash\n (supra), runs as under:\n\n \n\"5. It is contended by Shri P.P. Rao, the learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n appellants that the Tribunal has committed grievous error in placing\n\n reliance on the decision of this Court in \nUnion of India v. Mohan Lal\n\n Capoor\n. Therein, unamended Rule 5(2) of the statutory rules provides that\n\n in case of supersession of the officer of the police service of the State, the\n\n PSC was required to record reasons. Under those circumstances, this\n\n Court has directed that recording of reasons was necessary. He further\n\n contends that in the judgment itself, this Court held that in case of\n\n \"merit-cum-suitability\" with due regard to seniority, the principle\n\n of seniority has no role to play and the ratio therein was not\n\n properly understood by the Tribunal. We find force in the contention.\n\n 6. It is seen that the Government, in the absence of statutory rules, have\n\n applied, by administrative order, the principle of \"merit-cum-suitability\n\n with due regard to seniority\". It is settled law that in case of\n\n promotion to the posts of higher cadre, it has always been the\n\n settled criteria applied by the Governments is \"merit-cum-\n\n suitability with due regard to seniority\" or \"merit and ability\" but\n\n not 'seniority' or \"seniority-cum-suitability\". In fact, this question\n\n was considered by PSC, as stated earlier, before its evaluation of\n\n the respective merits. They secured the rules in the comparable\n\n services of the State where the principle of \"merit-cum-suitability\n\n with due regard to seniority\" is the statutory rule and thereby, the\n\n PSC had accepted the recommendation of the Government to apply the\n\n above rule to adjudge the relative merits of the candidates and in fact they\n\n did so apply.\n\n Page 51\n\n7. \nIn \nKapoor\n case, this Court has stated with regard to the principle thus:\n\n(SCC p. 856, para 37)\n\n \"[W]hen \nRegulation 5(2)\n says that the selection for inclusion in the\n\n list shall be based on merit and suitability in all respects with due\n\n regard to seniority, what it means is that for inclusion in the list,\n\n merit and suitability in all respects should be the governing\n\n consideration and that seniority should play only a secondary role.\n\n It is only when merit and suitability are roughly equal that\n\n seniority will be a determining factor, or if it is not fairly possible\n\n to make an assessment inter se of the merit and suitability of two\n\n eligible candidates and come to a firm conclusion, seniority would\n\n tilt the scale. But, to say, as the High Court has done, that seniority\n\n is the determining factor and that it is only if the senior is found\n\n unfit that the junior can be thought of for inclusion in the list is,\n\n with respect, not a correct reading of \nRegulation 5(2)\n. I do not\n\n know what the High Court would have said had \nRegulation 5(2)\n\n said: \"Selection for inclusion in the select list shall be based on\n\n seniority with due regard to merit and suitability\". Would it have\n\n said that the interpretation to be put upon the hypothetical sub-\n\n regulation (2) is the same as it put upon the actual sub-regulation?\n\n8. In case of merit-cum-suitability, the seniority should have no\n\nrole to play when the candidates were found to be meritorious and\n\nsuitable for higher posts. Even a junior most man may steal a\n\nmarch over his seniors and jump the queue for accelerated\n\npromotion. This principle inculcates dedicated service, and accelerates\n\nability and encourages merit to improve excellence. The seniority would\n\nhave its due place only where the merit and ability are approximately\n\nequal or where it is not possible to assess inter se merit and the suitability\n\nof two equally eligible competing candidates who come very close in the\n\norder of merit and ability. Under those circumstances, the seniority will\n\nplay its due role and calls it in aid for consideration. But in case where the\n Page 52\n\n relative merit and suitability or ability have been considered and\n\n evaluated, and found to be superior, then the seniority has no role to play.\n\n In our view the PSC has evolved correct procedure in grading the officers\n\n and the marks have been awarded according to the grading. It is seen that\n\n the four officers have come in the grading of 'B'. In consequence, the PSC\n\n had adopted the seniority of the appellants and Panda in the lower cadre\n\n in recommending their cases for appointment in the order of merit.\"\n\n (Emphasis is added)\n\n71. What further follows from the above discussion is that contrary to\n\nwhat has been decided in \nRamen Ch. Kalita\n (supra), when determination\n\nof relative assessment of merit of the aspiring candidates is sine qua non\n\nfor selection, the seniority shall have a role only when the merit is equal\n\nor else, seniority will not permit promotion of a senior, who is less\n\nmeritorious than his junior.\n\n72. When we revert to the Promotion Regulations, particularly,\n\nRegulations 5(3AA) and 5(4), what clearly surfaces is that having\n\nclassified eligible officers of the State Forest Service as 'Outstanding,\n\n'Very Good' or Good', in terms of the provisions of Promotion\n\nRegulation 3(AA)\n, the Selection Committee, since after the amendments\n\nof 1976, is duty bound to prepare a select list in terms of \nRegulation 5(4)\n,\n\nwhich lays down to the effect that keeping in view the requirement of\n\nnumber of names, the Selection Committee shall, first, include, in the\n\nselect list, the names of those officers, who had been finally classified as\n\n'Outstanding' and, then, select list shall contain the name of those, who\n\nmay have been classified as 'Very Good' and, thereafter, from amongst\n Page 53\n\nthose similarly classified as Good have to be included in terms of their\n\ninter se seniority in the State Forest Service.\n\n73. Thus, \nRegulation 5(4)\n makes it abundantly clear that when a junior\n\nofficer of a State Forest Service is classified as 'Outstanding', he will,\n\nwhile receiving promotion to the Indian Forest Service, supersede his\n\nsenior if his senior happens to be classified as 'Very Good' or 'Good'. To\n\nput it crisply and in precise terms, \nRegulation 5\n makes it the duty of the\n\nUPSC to ensure that promotion from the State Forest Service to the Indian\n\nForest Service is based on merit alone unless merit of the senior and\n\njunior stand on the same footing, for, the senior, in such a case, would\n\nretain his seniority in the Indian Forest Service; but, in a given case,\n\nwhen a junior is found to be more meritorious than his senior, then, the\n\njunior shall steal march over his senior.\n\n74. What is, now, necessary to note is that \nRegulation 5 (1)\n of the\n\nPromotion Regulations provides for preparation of a list of suitable\n\nofficers requiring the Central Government to decide, in consultation with\n\nthe State Government concerned, the number of members of the State\n\nForest Service to be included in the select list with a rider that such\n\nnumbers shall not exceed the number of substantive vacancies as on the 1st\n\nday of January of the year on which the meeting is held.\n\n75. \nRegulation 5(2)\n of the Promotion Regulations provides for zone of\n\nconsideration. According to \nRegulation 5(2)\n, the number of the members\n\nof the State Forest Service to be considered for promotion shall be three\n Page 54\n\ntimes the number of vacancies determined under \nRegulation 5 (1)\n.\n\nNormally, the zone of consideration is meant for the purpose of giving a\n\nchoice of better officers for promotion and it is for this reason that the\n\nselection is based on merit by classifying the officers into the categories of\n\n'Outstanding\", 'Very Good' and 'Good' on the basis of comparative\n\nassessment of their inter se merit. When a Review Selection Committee is\n\nheld, for the reason that an adverse remark has been set aside by the\n\nCourt in respect of the concerned officer or the downgrading of an\n\nofficer's ACRs has been found to be illegal and other similar\n\ncircumstances, the Review Selection Committee must consider afresh the\n\ncase of such officer alongwith the cases of all other already promoted\n\nofficers, with reference to the date on which the cases of other officers\n\nwere considered, because there may be a case, wherein as a result of\n\nsetting aside the adverse entry or the downgrading of the ACR, an officer\n\nmay displace or push down another officer to occupy the latter's place in\n\nthe merit list and if such a situation arises, the last person, in the final\n\nselect list, shall have to make way for the more meritorious officer\n\ninasmuch as the list of suitable officers, as contemplated by \nRegulation 5\n\n(1)\n, cannot exceed the number of substantive vacancies of a given calendar\n\nyear.\n\n76. Logically speaking, therefore, on review, promoting an officer to\n\nthe Indian Forest Service (who, upon review, is found fit to be promoted\n\nto the Indian Forest Service from State Forest Service) cannot be allowed\n Page 55\n\nto usurp or fill up the future vacancies of the next year. The 'guidelines',\n\nissued by the UPSC, if found contrary to the scheme of promotion so\n\nenvisaged by the Promotion Regulations, cannot bear scrutiny of law.\n\n77. The UPSC has issued 'guidelines' for preparation of the list of\n\nsuitable officers by Selection Committee for promotion to the Indian\n\nForest Service. Though the said 'guidelines' are not under challenge, it is\n\nclear that the 'guidelines', for review, are not in conformity with the\n\nPromotion Regulations. For example, it has been provided, in the said\n\n'guidelines', at paragraph 9, as follows:\n\n \"9...... In the event, the State Government certifies that there is no\n\n material change in the service records of the officer in the relevant\n\n years, the Review Committee may not change the grading of the\n\n officer already assigned by the earlier Committee. In exceptional\n\n circumstances, in case the Selection Committee recommends any\n\n change in the grading, specific reasons for the change should be\n\n appropriately recorded by the Review Committee in the minutes.\"\n\n78. The above 'guidelines' place the State Government in the shoes of\n\nthe Selection Committee to decide whether material changes have, or\n\nhave not, occurred in the ACR following its review by removing the\n\nillegalities, though it is essentially for the Review Selection Committee to\n\nexamine the reviewed ACR of the officer concerned and, then, grade such\n\nan officer as 'Outstanding', 'Very Good' or 'Good' or 'Unfit' as has been\n\nprovided by \nRegulation 5(4)\n of the Promotion Regulations.\n\n79. The UPSC's 'guidelines' further provide, in paragraph H.10, for\n\n\"Interpolation of names in the select list after review\". We have\n Page 56\n\nalready pointed out that appointment by promotion, in terms of the\n\nPromotion Regulations, is based on merit inasmuch as the Selection\n\nCommittee is required, under the Promotion Regulations, to categorize\n\nthe officers as 'Outstanding', 'Very Good' and 'Good' and, thereafter, to\n\nprepare merit list in the manner prescribed under \nRegulation 5(4)\n, which\n\nwe have already discussed above.\n\n80. If an occasion, therefore, arises for holding a Review Selection\n\nCommittee and, upon review, the officer is classified as 'Outstanding' or\n\n'Very Good' and if he is required to be accommodated in the list of\n\npromotion, which may have been prepared for a given calendar year, the\n\nofficer shall have to be placed at an appropriate place according to his\n\nmerit in the select list, which already existed. The effect of placement of\n\nsuch an officer, at an appropriate place, in the select list, will have\n\ncascading effect of pushing down the candidates in the select list and,\n\nobviously, the candidate, having the least merit, at the end of the list, will\n\nhave to make way for better candidate.\n\n81. Hence, there is no question of exceeding, by way of interpolation,\n\nstatutory limit of the size of the select list prepared under the \nRegulation\n\n5(1)\n of the Promotion Regulations and, consequently, there is no room for\n\ndoubt that there can be any interpolation of the names in the select list after\n\nreview, for, the select list would, otherwise, exceed the number of\n\nsubstantive vacancies, which might have occurred in a given year.\n\nHowever, as the UPSC guidelines, with regard to interpolation of names in\n Page 57\n\nthe select list after review, are not under challenge, in the present writ\n\npetition, we refrain from interfering with the said guidelines making it\n\nclear that it is, nonetheless, duty of the UPSC to ensure that their\n\nguidelines are in tune with the amended provisions of the Promotion\n\nRegulations.\n\n82. In the result and for the reasons discussed above, this writ petition\n\nsucceeds. The impugned order, dated 05.09.2012, passed by the learned\n\nTribunal, the recommendations made by the Review Selection\n\nCommittee, in its meeting, dated 09.12.2011, as well as the promotion of\n\nrespondent No. 4 to the Indian Forest Service are hereby set aside.\n\nRespondent No. 2 is hereby directed to hold a meeting of the Review\n\nSelection Committee to consider the petitioner's case for promotion to the\n\nIndian Forest Service on the basis of all the relevant ACRs of the\n\npetitioner vis-à-vis all the relevant ACRs of the respondent No. 4.\n\n83. With the above observations and directions, this writ petition\n\nstands disposed of.\n\n84. No order as to costs.\n\n JUDGE JUDGE\n\nDutt/rk\n Page 58\n Page 59",
