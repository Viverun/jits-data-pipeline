AND OTHERS\n Appearance:\n Shri Anmol Shrivastava - Advocate for the petitioner.\n\n Ms. Akashmi Trivedi, Proxy Counsel on behalf of Ms. Richa Parasher\n - Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and 2.\n\n ORDER\n\n The petitioner has filed this petition under \nArticle 226\n of the\n constitution of India for following relief:-\n\n ***अत- माननीय यायमूित महोदय से िनवेदन ह क ितयािचकाकता को\n िनदिशत कया जावे क याािचकाकता प रवा रक पे शन का िनधारण कर\n पे शन का भुगतान अदा कये जाने के आदे श व िनदश दान कये जावे जो\n यायोिचत होगा। अ य सहायता एवं यय जो माननीय यायालय उिचत\n समझे दान करे ।**\n\n Counsel for the petitioner by the instant petition is raising a grievance\n that petitioner's husband has died in harness in the year 1986, but after his\n death, the claim of family pension of the present petitioner has been rejected\n by the respondents on the ground that petitioner's husband did not qualify\n the requisite period of service so as to claim pension and, therefore, the\n family pension cannot be granted to the present petitioner.\n\n 2. Pleadings are complete, therefore, looking to the issue involved in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 2 WP-96-2019\n the case and as per the submission made by the learned counsel for the\n petitioner that the issue has already been settled, this petition is finally heard.\n\n 3. By this petition, the petitioner is claiming family pension due to the\n death of her husband, who was working in the respondent department as a\n work charged & contingency paid employee and after his death, which\n occurred on 25.09.1986, no family pension has been granted to the\n petitioner.\n\n 4. As per the facts of the case, the husband of the petitioner was a daily\n wager appointed in the year 1975 and he was paid wages from the Work\n Charged and Contingency Paid establishment; he was regularized in the\n Work Charged Establishment vide order dated 30.11.1983 and thereafter he\n\n died on 25.09.1986, and as such he had rendered approx. 11 years of services\n in the Work Charged Establishment as a regular employee.\n\n 5. As per the reply submitted by the respondents, since the petitioner's\n husband did not complete the qualifying service as per Rule 4(a) of the\n Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension\n Rules, 1979 (for short 'Pension Rules, 1979') he was not eligible for\n pension. As per Rule 2(c) of the Pension Rules, 1979, the qualifying service\n of 10 years was not completed by the husband of the petitioner and,\n therefore, the claim of family pension of the petitioner was rejected.\n\n 6. The issue involved in the present case has already been settled. The\n Writ Court in WP No. 13653/2009 - Smt. Ram Bai Rajak vs. State of M.P.\n and others dealing with the same issue has observed as under:-\n\n \n\"The petitioner is wife of late Shri Anandilal Rajak who was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 3 WP-96-2019\n working in the respondents department. Late Shri Anandilal Rajak\n was initially appointed as a daily wages employee on 1.3.1978. He\n was posted as Chowkidar and subsequently he was regularized on\n the work charged and contingency paid employee in the\n establishment on 10.6.1996/18.6.1996 vide Annexures P/2 and P/3\n respectively. After working for a period about 9 years work\n charged and in contingency paid establishment the petitioner's\n husband late Shri Anandilal Rajak died on 20.02.2005. After his\n death the petitioner claimed pension and other benefits in\n accordance to the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,\n 1976 and the Madhya Pradesh (Worked charged and Contingency\n Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979. The claim of the petitioner\n for grant of family pension and other benefits have been rejected\n only on the ground that the petitioner's husband has not completed\n 10 years regular services in the work charged and contingency\n paid establishment and therefore pension can not be granted vide\n impugned order Annexure P/8 dated 7.2.2007. The question with\n regard to period of service to be rendered in the work charged and\n Contingency Paid Establishment for grant of pension has been\n considered by this Court in \nBal Kishan Patel v. State of MP and\n others\n (WP No.4357/2004) and after taking note the requirement\n of the provisions contained in Madhya Pradesh (Worked charged\n and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 and the\n Provisionary Rule 2(c) and Rule 4 A of the said Rules the matter is\n so decided.\n\n \"14. It is apparent that for the purpose of family pension Rule 4-A\n of the Pension Rules of 1979 read with Rule 47 of the Rules of\n 1976 makes it clear that if an Incumbent has rendered not less than\n\n 7 years continuous service, family of incumbent is entitled for the\n family pension. It is not in dispute that deceased Jabmohan Singh\n Gond had rendered the contentious service for more than 7 years.\n Rule 6 (3) of the Pension Rules of 1979 clearly provides that\n without interruption for not less than 6 years such services shall be\n counted for pension as if such services has rendered on regular\n post, qualifying service has to be given effect to while considering\n the length of the service, as specified in Rule 2 (c) of the Rules of\n 1979 otherwise the purpose of fiction created of Rule (3) stands\n defeated. Thus the submission raised by the respondents that Rule\n 6(3), services cannot to be computed towards qualifying service,\n cannot accepted. The services which has been rendered, as\n qualifying service, under Rule of the Pension Rules of 1979 has to\n be counted, as rendered on a regular post. Thereafter entitlement\n has to be determined by the respondents in accordance with law.\"\n In the case at hand the petitioner's husband was engaged on daily\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 4 WP-96-2019\n wage basis in the Work-charged Establishment of Rani Avantibai\n Sagar Project. Thereafter, by order dated 26.06.1996 was bought\n on regular Work Charged Establishment in grade 825-900-20-\n 1220 as Time Keeper. The late husband of the petitioner while in\n service expired on 12.2.2001. The petitioner after death of her\n husband approached the authorities for grant of family pension.\n The said request was turned down by letter dated 13.09.2006 on\n the ground that petitioner's husband since has not rendered 10\n years of service in the Work-charged establishment she was not\n entitled for the family pension. It is this denial which has forced\n the petitioner to prefer the instant-writ petition.\n A \"Work-charged employee\" is defined under Rule 2 (b) to mean\n 'a person employed upon the actual execution, as distinct from\n general supervision of a specified work or upon subordinate\n supervision of the departmental labour, store, running and repairs\n of electrical equipment and machinery in connection with such\n work, excluding the daily paid labour and musterroll employee\n employed on the work.' Whereas, \"permanent employee as\n defined under clause (c) of Rule 2 of Rules 1979 means \"a\n contingency paid employee or a work-charged employee has\n completed fifteen years of service or more on or after the 1st\n January, 1974: Provided that in respect of a contingency paid\n employee or a work charged employee who has attained the age of\n superannuation on or after the First April 1981, permanent\n employee means an employee who has completed 10 years of\n service on or after 1st January, 1974. Rule 4A which was inserted\n vide notification dated 13.9.1982, pub. in M.P. Rajpatra. Pt. IV\n (ga), dated 26.12.1982, page 133; stipulates:\n\n \"4A. Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 4 the family of a\n permanent employee who dies while in service or after retirement\n on pension on or after the 1st April, 1981 shall be entitled to\n family pension at the rate of 30% of his/her pay drawn at the time\n of death/retirement subject to minimum of Rs.40/- per month and\n maximum of Rs. 100/- per month subject to other conditions of\n rule 47 of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,\n 1976 except sub-rule (3) of the said rule. Admittedly the aforesaid\n provisions have an overriding effect over Rule 4 wherein the\n stipulations have been laid down as to the minimum qualifying\n service which a person engaged on work-charged establishment\n should have at his credit, i.e., 10 years, before he is held entitled\n for grant of pension on his retirement. In other words the bar as\n created under Rule 4, in the considered opinion of this Court will\n not be attracted in case a member of a regular Workchared\n establishment dies in harness; meaning thereby that even a day's\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 5 WP-96-2019\n service rendered by a workman brought on regular work-charged\n establishment in case if he dies thereafter would entitle the family\n of such workman for a family pension as per stipulations\n contained in Section 4A. The only guiding factor while applying\n Rule 4A. of Rules of 1979 would be the conditions stipulated in\n Rule 47 of M.P. Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1979 Sub-rule (2)\n of Rule 47 of the Rules, 1976 stipulates; \"(2) Without prejudice to\n the provisions contained in sub-rule (3), where a Government\n servant dies- (a) While in service provided he had been medically\n examined and found fit for appointment under the Government.\n\n (b) after retirement from service and was on the date of death in\n receipt of a pension or compassionate allowance, referred to in\n Chapter V on the date of death, the family of the deceased shall be\n entitled to contributory family pension (hereinafter in thisrole\n referred to as Family Pension) the amount of which shall be\n determined as follows:\n\n Pay servant of Government servant Amount of month family pension\n\n (i) Below Rs.400 30 per cent of pay subject to a\n minimum of Rs.60 and maximum of\n Rs.100.\n\n (ii) Rs.400 and above but not exceeding 15 per cent of pay subject to a\n Rs. 1200. minimum of Rs.100 and maximum of\n Rs. 160.\n\n (iii) Above Rs. 1200/- 12 per cent of pay subject to a\n minimum of Rs.160 and maximum of\n Rs.250.\n\n In the present case also the claim of the petitioner was rejected\n only on the ground that the petitioner's husband has not completed\n 10 years regular service in work charged and contingency paid\n Establishment. This could not be done. The petitioner is entitled to\n get pension in the head indicated in the aforesaid table even if he\n has not completed 10 years service. In this view of the matter\n rejection of petitioner's claim by the impugned order is\n unsustainable Accordingly the order Annexure P/8 dated 7.2.2007\n is quashed, the respondents are directed to fix family pension of\n the petitioner within a period of 60 days and pay all arrears to the\n petitioner alongwith interest at the rate 6% per annum from the\n date of entitlement till payment. The petition stands allowed and is\n disposed of with the aforesaid.\"\n\n 7. Similarly, the Division Bench answering a reference made to it on\n the said issue in WA No. 1522/2019 has considered as under:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n \nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 6 WP-96-2019\n\n \"13. Now coming to family pension. The issue, in our opinion, has\n been duly considered and decided in the case of \nSmt. Sampat Bai\n vs State of Madhya Pradesh\n : Writ Petition No.17240/2012 on\n 05.02.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n \"Question is whether the respondents are justified in\n rejecting the claim and whether theproposition of law\n \nlaid down in\n Mamta Shukla (supra) and the provisions\n of M.P. (Work Charged and Contingency Paid\n Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 and M. P. Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 1976, supports the rejection\n order. And whether rendering 10 years of service in a\n work charged establishment will also be condition\n precedent for granting of family pension, could be\n ascertained after examining the relevant provision of\n 1979 Rules and that of 76 Rules. Rule 4 A of the Rules\n of 1979 and Rule 6 thereof respectively provide for: \"4\n A. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 4 the\n family of a permanent employee, who dies while in\n service or after retirement on pension on or after the 1st\n April 1981 shall be entitled to family pension at the rate\n of 30% of his/her pay drawn at the time of\n death/retirement subject to minimum, of Rs.40/- per\n month and maximum of Rs. 100/- per month subject to\n other conditions of Rule 47 of Madhya Pradesh Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of\n the said Rules. 6.

When the\n aforesaid two Rules are read together, it is clear as\n crystal that the provisions which govern the family\n pension has a different field of operation than the\n provisions regarding pension to an employee who\n retires from the workcharged establishment and are\n governed by Rule 6 of Rules of 1979. By virtue of Rule\n 4 A the provisions as contained under Rule 47 of the\n M.P. Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 are attracted.\n The said Rule provides for 47. Contributory Family\n Pension - (1) The provisions of this rule shall apply:-\n\n (a) to a Government servant entering service in a\n pensionable establishment or on after 1st April 1966,\n and (b) to a Government servant who was in service on\n 31st March, 1966 and came to be governed by the\n provisions of the Family Pension Scheme for State\n Government Employees, 1966 contained in\n Government of Madhya Pradesh Finance Department\n memo No.1963/C.R903-IV-R.

As to the law laid\n down by Full Bench in Mamta Shukla (supra) the issue\n before the Full Bench was- \"(i) Whether the decision of\n the Division Bench in W.A. No. 725/2007, \nSmt.\n Rahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. and others\n is not a\n good law in view of the decision of the earlier Division\n Bench of this Court vide order dated 18- 7-2005, passed\n in W.P. No.1273/2000, State of M.P. And others vs.\n Ram Singh and another ? (ii) Whether an employee is\n eligible for the benefit of family pension in accordance\n with the provisions of Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged\n and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979\n after completing qualifying service in accordance with\n the provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by the\n concerned Department for work charged and\n contingency paid employees or in accordance with the\n definition of Rule 2 of Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged\n and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979\n in regard to \"contingency paid employee\", \"work-\n charged employee\" and permanent employee\" ? (iii)\n Whether for counting qualifying service of an employee\n for the purpose of grant of benefit of pension it is\n necessary that the employee has to be appointed in\n accordance with the provisions of contingency paid\n employees recruitment rules framed by the\n concerneddepartment in regard to work charged and\n contingency paid employees ?\" The reference was\n answered in the following terms - 24- On the basis of\n above discussion, we hold in regard to the substantial\n questions of law Nos: 2 and 3 that an employee is\n eligible to count his past service as qualifying service in\n accordance with Rule 6 of the Pension Rules, 1979, if\n he was appointed in accordance with the provisions of\n Recruitment Rules of 1977. We further hold that an\n employee, who was not appointed in accordance with\n the provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by the\n concerned department, i.e., the Recruitment Rules of\n 1977, would not be eligible to count his past service as\n qualifying service for the purpose of grant of pension in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 9 WP-96-2019\n accordance with the Pension Rules of 1979 and we\n answer the substantial questions of law Nos. 2 and 3\n accordingly. 25.\n \nIn regard to substantial question of law\n No. 1 Earlier Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.\n 1273/2000, \nState of M.P. vs. Ramsingh and another\n, as\n held that a daily wager employee would not fall within\n the definition of work charged and contingency paid\n employee, hence his case would not be covered by\n Madhya Pradesh Work charged and Contingency Paid\n Employees Pension Rules, 1979, has not been noticed\n by the subsequent Division Bench of this Court in\n \nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. And\n other, 2010(4)\n MPLJ 332. However, in the subsequent case, the\n Division Bench has held that if an employee comes\n within the definition of work charged and contingency\n paid employee as defined the Pension Rules of 1979,\n then he is eligible to count his past service for the\n purpose of qualifying service in accordance with the\n Rules of 1979. In our opinion, there is no conflict\n between the Division Bench judgments, because the\n findings of the Division Benches are based on different\n factual aspects. Accordingly, we answer the substantial\n question of law No. 1 that there is no conflict of opinion\n between the two Division Bench judgments.\n \nHence, the\n decision of the Division Bench in the case of \nRahisha\n Begum vs. State of M.P. and others\n, 2010(4) MPLJ 332,\n is not per incuriam. We answer substantial question of\n law No. 1 accordingly.\"\n\n Apparent, it is from the above pronouncement that, the\n issue as to grant of family pension to a widow of an\n employee of work charged who are apparently covered\n by Rule 4A of Rules of 1979 was not the term of\n reference and nor was the same dwelt upon by the Full\n Bench. In view of above, the respondents are not\n justified in denying the family pension to the petitioner\n only on the ground that the petitioner's husband did not\n complete 10 years of service in Regular Work Charged\n Establishment. In view whereof, the impugned order\n dated 07.05.2012 is quashed. The respondents are\n directed to grant family pension to the petitioner from\n the date of entitlement. Petitioner shall also be entitled\n for the interest @ 7.5% on the difference till its final\n payment.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 10 WP-96-2019\n\n 8. Thus, in view of the aforesaid settled legal position, it is clear that\n the petitioner's claim for grant of family pension cannot be rejected by the\n respondents on the ground that her husband had not completed 10 years of\n qualifying service in the Work Charged Establishment.\n\n 9. Although the respondents have also raised a ground of delay saying\n that the husband of the petitioner died in the year 1986, but no claim of\n family pension was raised by the petitioner and therefore this petition\n deserves to be dismissed on the ground of delay and latches.\n\n \nThe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nState of Orissa v. Mamata\n Mohanty\n, (2011) 3 SCC 436 has held as under:-\n\n \n\"54. This Court has consistently rejected the contention that a\n petition should be considered ignoring the delay and laches in case\n the petitioner approaches the Court after coming to know of the\n relief granted by the Court in a similar case as the same cannot\n furnish a proper explanation for delay and laches. A litigant cannot\n wake up from deep slumber and claim impetus from the judgment\n in cases where some diligent person had approached the Court\n within a reasonable time. (See \nRup Diamonds v. Union of\n India\n [(1989) 2 SCC 356 : \nAIR 1989 SC 674], State of\n Karnataka v. S.M. Kotrayya\n [(1996) 6 SCC 267 : 1996 SCC\n (L&S) 1488] and Jagdish Lal v.

Thangappan\n reported in (2006) 4 SCC 322 has held as follows :\n\n 6. Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to be borne in\n mind by the High Court when they exercise their discretionary\n powers under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. In an appropriate\n case the High Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary powers\n if there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant\n to assert his right as taken in conjunction with the lapse of time\n and other circumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\n \nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n 11 WP-96-2019\n Even where fundamental right is involved the matter is still within\n the discretion of the Court as pointed out in \nDurga Prashad v.\n Chief Controller of Imports and Exports\n (1969) 1 SCC 185. Of\n course, the discretion has to be exercised judicially and\n reasonably.\n\n \n7. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes Peacock in\n Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd (1874) 5 PC\n 221 (PC at p. 239) was approved by this Court in \nMoon Mills Ltd.\n v. M.R. Meher\n [\nAIR 1967 SC 1450] and Maharashtra SRTC v.\n Shri Balwant Regular Motor Service\n [AIR 1969 SC 329]. Sir\n Barnes had stated:\n\n \"Now, the doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary\n or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to\n give a remedy either because the party has, by his conduct done\n that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it,\n or where by his conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not\n waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which\n it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were\n afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time\n and delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument\n against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon\n mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any\n statute of limitation, the validity of that defence must be tried\n upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances always\n important in such cases are, the length of the delay and the nature\n of the acts done during the interval which might affect either party\n and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course\n or the other, so far as it relates to the remedy.\n\n \n9.In the case of \nGhulam Rasool Lone vs State of J&K\n reported in\n (2009) 15 SCC 321 , it is held as follows:\n\n \"19. It is beyond any cavil of doubt that the remedy under \nArticle\n 226\n of the Constitution of India is a discretionary one.
