The investigation was also\nmonitored by the High Court.\n\n5. It may be noted that during the course of\ninvestigation, few more ladies in addition to the\nappellant herein made allegations of torture and\nsexual exploitation against respondent No.2.\n\n6. The application for bail filed by respondent\nNo.2 came to be rejected by the learned Exclusive\nSpecial Court (SC/ST Act), Patna6 vide order dated\n10th July, 2023. Respondent No.2 preferred an\nappeal under \nSection 14(A)(2)\n of the SC/ST Act\nbefore the High Court, assailing the order passed by\nthe Special Court.\n\n7. In the meanwhile, chargesheet came to be filed\nagainst respondent No.2 in the Special Court which\ntook cognizance of the offences punishable under\n\nSections 341\n, \n342\n, \n323\n, \n328\n, \n376\n, \n120B\n, \n504\n, \n506\n of\nthe IPC, \nSections 3\n/\n4\n of the IT Act and \nSection\n\n6\n Hereinafter referred to as the “Special Court”.\n\n 3\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\f3(1)(w)/3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act vide order dated\n29th August, 2023.\n\n8. It may be noted that in the appeal before the\nHigh Court, the appellant-victim was not impleaded\nas a party, and bail was granted to the accused\n(respondent No.2) in clear violation of the mandate\nunder Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act which makes\nhearing of the victim in any prayer for bail essential.\nThe High Court, vide order dated 18th January,\n2024, allowed the appeal filed by respondent No.2\nand granted her bail with the following reasoning: -\n\n “7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties\n and taking into consideration that there is no\n specific allegation against the appellant, the\n Court is inclined to allow this appeal.\n Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the\n impugned order dated 10.07.2023 is hereby set\n aside.”\n\n9. The appellant-victim is before us through this\nappeal by special leave to assail the order passed by\nthe High Court.\n\n10. We have heard and considered the\nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel for the\nappellant-victim, learned counsel representing\n\n 4\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\frespondent No.2-accused and the learned standing\ncounsel representing the State of Bihar.\n\n11. Learned counsel for the appellant-victim\nvehemently and fervently contended that the High\nCourt granted bail to respondent No.2 by a cryptic\norder without assigning any reasons whatsoever and\ntotally ignoring the critical fact that respondent No.2\nbeing the Superintendent of the women protection\nhome was a person in authority, who misused her\nposition to exploit the helpless female inmates of the\ninstitution and deliberately orchestrated their\nsexual exploitation by various influential persons.\nNumerous women inmates have made grave\nallegations in their statements recorded under\n\nSection 164\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973, stating that they were sent out of the\ninstitution for providing sexual gratification to\noutsiders and those who resisted, were injected with\nintoxicants and under the influence thereof, they\nwere subjected to sexual exploitation by different\nmen.\n\n12. It was further contended that unidentified men\nwere allowed access into the protection home where\n\n 5\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fthey would take advantage of the helpless condition\nof the victims so as to gain sexual favours.\n\n13. He further pointed out that pursuant to the\nrelease of respondent No.2 on bail, she has been\nreinstated in service, and she is heading another\nprotection home within the State of Bihar. As per\nthe learned counsel, this approach of the State\nauthorities in allowing respondent No.2 to continue\nfunctioning as a person in-charge of the protection\nhome, despite there being allegations of misuse of\npower to facilitate sexual exploitation of female\ninmates would imminently expose the inmates to a\ngrave risk of being subjected to sexual exploitation.\nHe submitted that it is apparent that the concerned\nauthorities of the State Government are hands in\nglove with the accused and have no intention of\npunishing respondent No.2 for her recalcitrant\nconduct. Rather she has been rewarded with a fresh\ntenure in an identical protection home where she\nhad earlier committed the atrocities on the female\ninmates.\n\n14. Learned counsel further submitted that in\ncase, respondent No.2 is allowed to remain on bail,\n\n 6\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fthere is an imminent danger of her influencing the\nwitnesses and frustrating the trial. He pointed out\nthat as a matter of fact, numerous threats have\nalready been given to the witnesses of this case and\nhence, the continuance of respondent No.2 on bail\nwould be detrimental to a fair trial.\n\n15. On these grounds and looking to the gravity\nand nature of allegations, learned counsel for the\nappellant implored the Court to exercise its\nextraordinary jurisdiction under \nArticle 136\n of the\nConstitution of India so as to cancel the bail granted\nto respondent No.2.\n\n16. Learned standing counsel representing\nrespondent No.1-State of Bihar supported the\nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel for the\nappellant-victim. He contended that after thorough\ninvestigation, grave allegations of misuse of official\nposition to exploit the helpless and destitute female\ninmates housed in the protection home have been\nsubstantiated. Respondent No.2 being a person in\nauthority shall definitely influence the fair trial of\nthe case and there is imminent threat to the life and\nlimb of the victim ladies, if respondent No.2 is\n\n 7\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fallowed to continue on bail during the pendency of\nthe trial. However, on a pertinent query being posed,\nlearned standing counsel was not in a position to\nexplain the conduct of the State authorities in\nreinstating respondent No.2-accused and putting\nher in charge of another women’s home in spite of\nthe fact that she is facing a prosecution for abuse of\npowers and sexual exploitation while working in a\nsimilar institution.\n\n17. Learned counsel representing respondent\nNo.2-accused strenuously tried to justify the\nimpugned order. He urged that the High Court,\nwhile considering the bail application has taken\nnote of the material available on record and rightly\nfound that there are no specific allegations against\nrespondent No.2 in the prosecution evidence and\nthereafter, a reasoned order has been passed\ndirecting release of respondent No.2 on bail. He\nurged that respondent No.2 being a woman had\nlanguished in custody for almost 500 days, since\n27th August, 2022 and this was the most vital factor\nwhich weighed with the High Court in favour of\ngrant of bail. He urged that detailed discussion of\n\n 8\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fevidence at the stage of deciding the bail application\nmay prejudice the trial and hence, it would not be\nfair to say that the High Court has not adverted to\nthe merits of the case.\n\n18. He urged that respondent No.2 being a woman\nis entitled to a special consideration for grant of bail\nand as such, this Court should be slow in\ninterfering with the order passed by the High Court\ndirecting release of respondent No.2 on bail.\n\n19. We have given our thoughtful consideration to\nthe submissions advanced at the bar and have gone\nthrough the impugned order and the material\nplaced on record.\n\n20. At the outset, we may like to note that the\nallegations attributed to respondent No.2 shake the\nconscience of the Court. Respondent No.2 being\nposted as the Officer in-charge of the women’s\nprotection home was required to work as a protector\nof the inmates, but she turned rogue and indulged\nin sexual exploitation of the helpless and destitute\nwomen who had been placed in the said protection\n\n 9\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fhome which is an institution created to provide\nthem safety and security.\n\n21. Thus, it is clearly a case, wherein the person\nput in the role of a saviour has turned into a devil.\n\n22. Not only are the allegations attributed to\nrespondent No. 2-accused are grave and\nreprehensible in nature, in addition thereto, the fact\nremains that releasing respondent No. 2 on bail is\nbound to have an adverse effect on trial because\nthere would be an imminent possibility of the\nwitnesses being threatened.\n\n23. Recently, this Court in the case of \nShabeen\nAhmad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.7\n\nwhile placing reliance upon the case of \nAjwar v.\nWaseem8\n cancelled the bail granted to the accused\nin a dowry death case observing as follows:\n\n “18.... A superficial application of bail parameters\n not only undermines the gravity of the offence\n itself but also risks weakening public faith in the\n judiciary’s resolve to combat the menace of dowry\n deaths. It is this very perception of justice, both\n within and outside the courtroom, that courts\n must safeguard, lest we risk normalizing a crime\n\n7 (2025) 4 SCC 172.\n\n8 (2024) 10 SCC 768.\n\n 10\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\f that continues to claim numerous innocent lives.\n\n \nThese observations regarding grant of bail in\n grievous crimes were thoroughly dealt with by this\n Court in \nAjwar v. Waseem\n in the following paras:\n\n \n“26. While considering as to whether bail\n ought to be granted in a matter involving a\n serious criminal offence, the Court must\n consider relevant factors like the nature of\n the accusations made against the accused,\n the manner in which the crime is alleged to\n have been committed, the gravity of the\n offence, the role attributed to the accused,\n the criminal antecedents of the accused,\n the probability of tampering of the\n witnesses and repeating the offence, if the\n accused are released on bail, the likelihood\n of the accused being unavailable in the\n event bail is granted, the possibility of\n obstructing the proceedings and evading\n the courts of justice and the overall\n desirability of releasing the accused on\n bail. [Refer : \nChaman Lal v. State of U.P.\n [Chaman Lal\n v. State of U.P., [(2004) 7 SCC\n 525]; \nKalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh\n Ranjan\n [(2004) 7 SCC 528]; \nMasroor v.\n State of U.P.\n [(2009) 14 SCC 286];\n \nPrasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n\n [(2010) 14 SCC 496]; \nNeeru Yadav v. State\n of U.P.\n [(2014) 16 SCC 508]; \nAnil Kumar\n Yadav v. State (NCT of Delhi\n) [(2018) 12\n SCC 129]; \nMahipal v. Rajesh Kumar\n\n [(2020) 2 SCC 118].\n\n 27. It is equally well settled that bail\n once granted, ought not to be cancelled\n in a mechanical manner. However, an\n unreasoned or perverse order of bail is\n always open to interference by the\n superior court. If there are serious\n allegations against the accused, even if he\n has not misused the bail granted to him,\n\n 11\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\f such an order can be cancelled by the\n same Court that has granted the bail. Bail\n can also be revoked by a superior court if it\n transpires that the courts below have\n ignored the relevant material available on\n record or not looked into the gravity of the\n offence or the impact on the society\n resulting in such an order. \nIn \nP v. State of\n M.P.\n [(2022) 15 SCC 211] decided by a\n three-Judge Bench of this Court [authored\n by one of us (Hima Kohli, J.)] has spelt out\n the considerations that must weigh with\n the Court for interfering in an order\n granting bail to an accused under \nSection\n 439(1)\nCrPC in the following words : (SCC\n p. 224, para 24)\n\n “24.\n \nAs can be discerned from the\n above decisions, for cancelling bail\n once granted, the court must consider\n whether any supervening\n circumstances have arisen or the\n conduct of the accused post grant of\n bail demonstrates that it is no longer\n conducive to a fair trial to permit him\n to retain his freedom by enjoying the\n concession of bail during trial [\nDolat\n Ram v. State of Haryana\n, (1995) 1\n SCC 349] . To put it differently, in\n ordinary circumstances, this Court\n would be loathe to interfere with an\n order passed by the court below\n granting bail but if such an order is\n found to be illegal or perverse or\n premised on material that is\n irrelevant, then such an order is\n susceptible to scrutiny and\n interference by the appellate\n court.”\n\n Considerations for setting aside bail\n orders\n\n 12\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\n\f 28. The considerations that weigh with the\n appellate court for setting aside the bail\n order on an application being moved by the\n aggrieved party include any supervening\n circumstances that may have occurred\n after granting relief to the accused, the\n conduct of the accused while on bail, any\n attempt on the part of the accused to\n procrastinate, resulting in delaying the\n trial, any instance of threats being\n extended to the witnesses while on bail,\n any attempt on the part of the accused to\n tamper with the evidence in any manner.\n\n We may add that this list is only\n illustrative and not exhaustive. However,\n the court must be cautious that at the\n stage of granting bail, only a prima facie\n case needs to be examined and detailed\n reasons relating to the merits of the case\n that may cause prejudice to the accused,\n ought to be avoided. Suffice it is to state\n that the bail order should reveal the\n factors that have been considered by\n the Court for granting relief to the\n accused.”\n (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n24. It is trite that bail once granted should not be\ncancelled ordinarily, but where the facts are so\ngrave that they shake the conscience of the Court;\nand where the release of the accused on bail would\nhave an adverse impact on the society, the Courts\nare not powerless and are expected to exercise\njurisdiction conferred by law to cancel such bail\n\n 13\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\forders so as to subserve the ends of justice. The\npresent one is precisely a case of such nature.\n\n25. We may note that the impugned order could\nhave been quashed on the solitary ground of non-\ncompliance of Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act\nwhich mandates that notice to a victim is essential\nbefore a prayer for bail is being considered, in a case\nwhere the offence/s under the SC/ST Act have been\napplied.\n\n26. On going through the memo of appeal filed by\nthe respondent-accused in the High Court, we find\nthat the appellant-victim was not impleaded as a\nparty respondent therein and hence, did not have\nthe benefit of right of hearing as warranted by\nSection 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act.\n\n27. Furthermore, keeping in view the principles\n\nlaid down by\n this Court in \nShabeen Ahmad\n (supra),\nwe are of the firm opinion that the present case is\nan exceptional one, wherein the grant of bail by the\nHigh Court to respondent No.2-accused by a cryptic\norder dated 18th January, 2024 has resulted into\ntravesty of justice. Grant of bail to the person\n\n 14\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\faccused of such grave offences without assigning\nreasons shakes the conscience of the Court and\nwould have an adverse impact on the society.\nFurthermore, the release of the accused on bail\nwould adversely impact the trial as there would be\nhigh chances of the material witnesses being\nthreatened and influenced. Our conclusions are\nfortified by the fact that respondent No.2-accused\nhas been reinstated to the position of\nSuperintendent of another protection home which\nspeaks volumes about her clout and influence with\nthe administration.\n\n28. Consequently, it is a fit case, warranting\nexercise of this Court’s extraordinary jurisdiction\nunder \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution of India so as\nto interfere in the impugned order dated 18th\nJanuary, 2024 which is hereby quashed and set\naside.\n\n29. The bail granted to respondent No.2-accused is\nhereby cancelled. She shall surrender before the\ntrial Court within a period of four weeks from today,\nfailing which, the trial Court shall cancel her bail\nbonds and ensure that she is taken into custody for\n\n 15\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\fthe remainder of trial. The trial Court and the\nDistrict administration shall ensure that proper\nprotection and support is provided to the victims of\nthe case. In case there is any change of\ncircumstances, respondent No.2-accused shall be at\nliberty to renew her prayer of bail before the\nappropriate forum.\n\n30. The appeal is allowed in the above terms.\n\n31. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand\ndisposed of.\n\n ….……………………J.\n (VIKRAM NATH)\n\n ...…………………….J.\n (SANDEEP MEHTA)\nNEW DELHI;\n\nJULY 21, 2025.\n\n 16\n\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.)
