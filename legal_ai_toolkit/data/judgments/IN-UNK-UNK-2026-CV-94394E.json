Marriage of applicant was\nsolemnized with Faujiya on 12/4/13. She was sick since prior to her\nmarriage and after marriage her treatment was carried out by the\napplicant and his family members only. She has not lodged any\ncomplaint against anyone. She was also suffering from paralysis.\nHowever, from 14/7/16, Faujiya had been residing with her parents and\nhas died on 13/12/17 at her parental home only. Earlier on 20/9/16,\nfather of Faujiya had registered a case under \nsection 498A\n of the IPC\nagainst the applicant and other family members. On 29/8/16 and\n16/9/16, father of the applicant and applicant respectively had informed\nthe Police about being threatened by parents of the deceased of being\nroped in a false case.

It is submitted that the applicant\n was involved in harassing the deceased for non fulfillment of dowry, in\n which regard a complaint was also lodged. Not being able to withstand\n the harassment, Faujiya fell ill and ultimately was taken by her parents\n for treatment. However, finally she succumbed.
