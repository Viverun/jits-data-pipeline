Petitioner\n\nVs.\n\nJagat Ram & Anr. ... Respondents\n\nWITH\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.451 OF 2011\n\nRam Kumar ... Petitioner\n\nVs.\n\nJagat Ram & Anr. ... Respondents\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nALTAMAS KABIR, J.\n\n1. Two Special Leave Petitions have been filed\n\nagainst the judgment and order dated 11th October,\n2010, passed by the Division Bench of the Punjab &\n\nHaryana High Court in L.P.A. No.490 of 2010,\n\nsetting aside the promotion granted to the\n\nPetitioner in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.451\n\nof 2011. While Special Leave Petition (Civil)\n\nNo.451 of 2011 has been filed by Ram Kumar, the\n\nRespondent No.3 before the High Court, setting\n\naside his promotion to the post of Assistant\n\nManager (Administration) in the Haryana State\n\nWarehousing Corporation, Special Leave Petition\n\n(Civil) No.2659 of 2011 has been filed by the\n\nWarehousing Corporation challenging the same order.\n\n2. The facts briefly stated disclose that the\n\nHaryana State Warehousing Corporation, hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"the Corporation\", framed its Rules\n\nand Regulations known as the Haryana Warehousing\n\nCorporation (Officers & Staff) Regulations, 1994,\n\nhereinafter referred to as \"the 1994 Regulations\"\n\nin exercise of the powers conferred by Section 42\nof the Housing Corporation Act, 1962, with the\n\nprevious sanction of the State Government.\n\nRegulation 8 of the 1994 Regulations deals with\n\npromotions in the Corporation. Regulation 8(2) of\n\nthe 1994 Regulations provides as follows :-\n\n\"8(2). All promotions unless otherwise\n\nprovided, shall be made on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit basis and seniority alone shall not\n\nconfer any right to such promotions.\"\n\n3. The Respondent No.3, Ram Kumar, was promoted to\n\nthe post of Assistant Manager (Administration) in\n\nthe Corporation on account of his excellent service\n\nrecord in comparison to that of Jagat Ram, who is\n\nRespondent No.1 in both the Special Leave\n\nPetitions. Challenging the said decision, Jagat\n\nRam filed a Writ Petition before the Punjab &\n\nHaryana High Court on 17.11.2009. The learned\n\nSingle Judge dismissed the Writ Petition filed by\n\nJagat Ram after taking into consideration the\n\nservice records of both Jagat Ram and Ram Kumar and\n\nupon holding that the service record of Ram Kumar\nwas superior to that of Jagat Ram and that the\n\nCorporation had not committed any error in granting\n\npromotion to Ram Kumar.\n\n4. Against the order of the learned Single Judge,\n\nJagat Ram filed a Letters Patent Appeal, being 490\n\nof 2010, before the Division Bench of the Punjab &\n\nHaryana High Court, which was allowed. The\n\nDivision Bench while allowing the Letters Patent\n\nAppeal filed by Jagat Ram held that although\n\npromotion to the post of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration) is to be effected on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit and not seniority alone, the\n\npromotion given to Ram Kumar was based on his\n\ngradings and on a comparative assessment of his\n\nmerit as against the merit of the Respondent No.1,\n\nJagat Ram. The Division Bench further held that\n\nsince the criterion for promotion to the post of\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration) was seniority-\n\ncum-merit and not merit-cum-seniority, the\npromotion given to Ram Kumar was not sustainable\n\nsince such promotion had been made predominantly on\n\nthe principle of merit, in contravention of the\n\nprovisions of the Regulations. The Division Bench\n\ndirected the concerned Respondents to redo the\n\nexercise for promotion to the post of Assistant\n\nManager in accordance with the provisions of the\n\nRegulations in force.\n\n5. Appearing for the Special Leave Petitioner in\n\nSpecial Leave Petition (Civil) No.451 of 2011, Mr.\n\nD.P. Mukherjee, learned Advocate, contended that\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court had\n\nmisunderstood and consequently misapplied the\n\nregulation governing appointments on the ground of\n\nseniority-cum-merit, particularly, since it\n\nprovided that seniority alone could not confer\n\nright to promotions on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit. Mr. Mukherjee submitted that if it was only\n\na question of seniority-cum-merit, then the\nreasoning of the Division Bench may have been\n\nacceptable. However, such not being the case and\n\na stipulation having been made that seniority alone\n\nwould not govern promotions on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit, the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt had erred in giving emphasis to seniority\n\nwhen the Petitioner, Ram Kumar, possesses far\n\nsuperior qualifications than the Respondent No.1,\n\nJagat Ram.\n\n6. Mr. Mukherjee urged that on account of the\n\naddition of the expression \"seniority alone would\n\nnot confer right to promotion\", it must be\n\nunderstood that merit would also require\n\nconsideration for the purpose of granting\n\npromotion, even on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit. Mr. Mukherjee urged that since Ram Kumar\n\nhad been assessed as \"outstanding\" over 10 years,\n\nwhile Jagat Ram had been assessed \"outstanding\"\n\nonly for one year, it was in keeping with\nRegulation 8 of the 1994 Regulations that Ram Kumar\n\nhad been preferred to Jagat Ram.\nIn support of his\n\nsubmissions, Mr. Mukherjee referred to the decision\n\nof this Court in\nJagathigowda C.N. & Ors. Vs.\n\nChairman, Cauvery Gramina Bank & Ors.\n[(1996) 9 SCC\n\n677], in which this Court held that while granting\n\npromotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, the\n\ntotality of the service record of the eligible\n\ncandidates had to be considered and consequently\n\nsince Ram Kumar had superior credentials in\n\ncomparison to Jagat Ram, he had been rightly\n\npromoted to the post of Assistant Manager and the\n\njudgment and order of the Division Bench was\n\nerroneous and was liable to be set aside and that\n\nof the learned Single Judge was liable to be\n\nsustained.\n\n7. The same stand was taken on behalf of the\n\nCorporation in Special Leave Petition (Civil)\n\nNo.2659 of 2011 and it was urged by Mr. Alok\nSangwan, learned Advocate, appearing for the\n\nCorporation, that the promotion of Ram Kumar had\n\nbeen effected in accordance with Regulation 8(2) of\n\nthe 1994 Regulations and while considering the\n\nseniority of the eligible candidates, the\n\nCorporation had given effect to the second part of\n\nthe Regulation which categorically indicated that\n\nseniority alone would not be the criteria for\n\npromotion. Mr. Sangwan also urged that the order\n\nof the Division Bench of the High Court was liable\n\nto be set aside.\n\n8. The submissions made by Mr. D.P. Mukherjee and\n\nMr. Alok Sangwan were opposed on behalf of the\n\nRespondent No.1 in both the Special Leave\n\nPetitions, Jagat Ram, and it was urged by Mrs.\n\nKanwaljit Kochar, learned Advocate, that the\n\nDivision Bench had rightly interpreted the\n\nprinciple in relation to promotions made on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit. Mrs. Kochar submitted\nthat if merit was to play a larger role than\n\nseniority in effecting such promotions, then the\n\nprocedure to be adopted would have been merit-cum-\n\nseniority and not seniority-cum-merit. According\n\nto her, the decision in\nJagathigowda C.N.\n's case\n\n(supra) does not really help the case of the\n\nPetitioners since this Court had merely indicated\n\nin the facts of that case, based on the NABARD\n\nCircular dated 7.4.1986, that the selection of the\n\neligible candidates should be based on performance\n\nof the respective candidates in the Bank. It was\n\nfurther observed that the instructions of NABARD\n\nbeing in the nature of guidelines, the promotions\n\nmade by the Bank could not be set aside unless the\n\nsame were arbitrary and unfair.\n\n9. The law relating to promotions to be granted on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit has been settled\n\nby this Court in various decisions, including the\n\ncase of the\nState of Mysore vs. Syed Mahmood\n[AIR\n1968 SC 1113], wherein it was observed that when\n\npromotion is to be made by selection on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit i.e. seniority subject to\n\nthe fitness of the candidates to discharge the\n\nduties of the post from amongst any person eligible\n\nfor promotion, the State Government had erred in\n\npromoting juniors ranking below the candidates in\n\norder of seniority and that such promotions were\n\nirregular. Of course, the question posed in these\n\nSpecial Leave Petitions gives rise to another\n\nquestion regarding the latter part of Regulation\n\n8(2) of the 1994 Regulations which indicates that\n\nseniority alone would not confer any right to be\n\npromoted. In that regard, this Court held in the\n\nabove-mentioned case that where the promotion is\n\nbased on seniority-cum-merit, the officer cannot\n\nclaim promotion as a matter of right by virtue of\n\nhis seniority alone. If he is found unfit to\n\ndischarge the duties of the higher post, he may be\n\npassed over and an officer junior to him may be\npromoted.\n\n10. That principle has been followed ever since and\n\nwas reiterated by a Three-Judge Bench of this Court\n\nin the case of\nB.V. Sivaiah & Ors. Vs. K. Addanki\n\nBabu & Ors.\n[(1998) 6 SCC 720], wherein the\n\ncriterion for promotion on the basis of seniority-\n\ncum-merit fell for consideration with regard to the\n\nsame-day appointees. It was held that seniority-\n\ncum-merit in the matter of promotion contemplates\n\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite\n\nfor efficiency of administration, a senior\n\ncandidate, even though less meritorious, would have\n\npriority and a comparative assessment of merit is\n\nnot required to be made. The said view was again\n\nrepeated in the case of\nK. Samantaray vs. National\n\nInsurance Co. Ltd.\n[(2004) 9 SCC 286]. While\n\nconsidering the concepts relating to promotion on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit and merit-cum-\n\nseniority, reference was made to an earlier\ndecision of this Court in\nSant Ram Sharma vs. State\n\nof Rajasthan\n[AIR 1967 SC 1910], in which it was\n\nobserved that the principles of seniority-cum-merit\n\nand merit-cum-seniority are completely different.\n\nFor the former, greater emphasis is laid on\n\nseniority though it is not the determinative factor\n\nwhile in the latter merit is the determining\n\nfactor. A third mode described as \"hybrid mode of\n\npromotion\" contemplates a third category of cases\n\nwhere seniority is duly respected and at the same\n\ntime merit is also appropriately recognized.\nIn\n\nyet another decision in the case of\nHarigovind\n\nYadav vs. Rewa Sidhi Gramin Bank\n[(2006) 6 SCC\n\n145], this Court reiterated the principles\n\nexplained in\nB.V. Sivaiah\n's case (supra) holding\n\nthat where procedure adopted does not provide the\n\nminimum standard for promotion, but only the\n\nminimum standard for interview and does selection\n\nwith reference to comparative marks, it is contrary\n\nto the rule of \"seniority-cum-merit\".\n11. In applying the principle of granting promotion\n\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit, what is\n\nimportant is that the inter se seniority of all\n\ncandidates who are eligible for consideration for\n\npromotion should be identified on the basis of\n\nlength of service or on the basis of the seniority\n\nlist as prepared, inasmuch as, it is such seniority\n\nwhich gives a candidate a right to be considered\n\nfor promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nAs was indicated in\nSyed Mahmood\n's case (supra)\n\nwhere the promotion is based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit, the officer cannot as a matter of right\n\nclaim promotion by virtue of his seniority alone,\n\nwhich principle is also reflected in Regulation\n\n8(2) of the 1994 Regulations. Consequently, the\n\ncandidate had to be fit to discharge the duties of\n\nthe higher post and if his performance was assessed\n\nnot to meet such a requirement, he could be passed\nover and those junior to him could be promoted\n\ndespite his seniority in the seniority list.\n\n12. In the instant case, the only feature which\n\nweighed with the Corporation in granting promotion\n\nto Ram Kumar was a comparative assessment between\n\nhis performance and that of Jagat Ram. While Jagat\n\nRam had got only one \"outstanding\" remark in 10\n\nyears, Ram Kumar had obtained \"outstanding\" remark\n\nin all the 10 years. Accordingly, he was preferred\n\nto Jagat Ram, whose qualifications were inferior to\n\nthat of Ram Kumar by comparison. But, as has been\n\nrightly held by the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt, in cases of seniority-cum-merit, the\n\ncomparative assessment is not contemplated and is\n\nnot required to be made.\n\n13. There is nothing on record to indicate that\n\nJagat Ram was not capable of discharging his\n\nfunctions in the promoted post of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration). He was denied promotion only on\nthe ground of the superior assessment that had been\n\nmade in favour of Ram Kumar, which, in our view,\n\nruns contrary to the concept of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit.\n\n14. There is, therefore, no reason to differ with\n\nthe views of the Division Bench of the High Court\n\nand both the Special Leave Petitions, filed by Ram\n\nKumar and the Corporation, are accordingly\n\ndismissed.\n\n15. There will, however, be no order as to costs.\n\n................................................J.\n\n(ALTAMAS KABIR)\n\nNew Delhi\n\nDated:23.02.2011\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.2659 OF 2011\n\nHaryana State Warehousing ...Petitioners\nCorporation & Anr.\n\nvs.\n\nJagat Ram & Anr. ...Respondents\n\nWITH\n\nSPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.451 OF 2011\n\nRam Kumar ...Petitioner\n\nvs.\n\nJagat Ram & Ors. ...Respondents\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nCYRIAC JOSEPH, J.\n\n1. I had the benefit of reading the judgment of my\n\nlearned brother Altamas Kabir, J. I respectfully agree\n\nwith the decision to dismiss the Special Leave Petitions.\n\nHowever, I wish to support and supplement the decision\n\nthrough this separate but concurring judgment.\n2. The dispute in these Special Leave Petitions relates\n\nto the claim of Jagat Ram [Respondent No.1 in S.L.P. (C)\n\nNo. 2659 of 2011] for appointment to the post of Assistant\n\nManager (Administration) in Haryana State Warehousing\n\nCorporation [Petitioner No.1 in S.L.P. (C) No.2659 of\n\n2011].\n\n3. Jagat Ram had filed Civil Writ Petition No.18891 of\n\n2009 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, challenging\n\nthe appointment of Ram Kumar [Petitioner in S.L.P. (C)\n\nNo.451 of 2011 and respondent No.2 in S.L.P. (C) No.2659 of\n\n2011] as Assistant Manager (Administration) and seeking a\n\ndirection to Haryana State Warehousing Corporation\n\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Corporation\") to promote\n\nJagat Ram as Assistant Manager (Administration) w.e.f.\n\n1.8.2009. The said Writ Petition was dismissed by a Single\n\nBench of the High Court on 9.12.2009. Thereupon, Jagat Ram\n\nfiled Letters Patent Appeal No.490 of 2010 before a\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court and vide judgment dated\n\n11.10.2010, the Division Bench allowed the L.P.A. and set\n\naside the promotion of Ram Kumar, with a direction to the\n\nCorporation to redo the exercise and complete the same as\n\nexpeditiously as possible. Aggrieved by the judgment of\nthe Division Bench, the Corporation and Ram Kumar have\n\nfiled these Special Leave Petitions.\n\n4. Jagat Ram was first appointed as Godown Attendant-cum-\n\nWatchman in the Corporation and he joined the service on\n\n25.4.1979. He was promoted as Clerk-cum-Typist on\n\n23.12.1981. He was further promoted as Establishment\n\nAssistant on 16.5.1996.\n\n5. Ram Kumar was first appointed in the Corporation as\n\nJunior Scale Stenographer and he was promoted as\n\nEstablishment Assistant on 10.11.2004.\n\n6. Thus, admittedly, Jagat Ram was senior to Ram Kumar in\n\nthe cadre of Establishment Assistant.\n\n7. A vacancy of Assistant Manager (Administration) arose\n\non 1.8.2009 due to the retirement of one V.K. Chakarvarty,\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration) on 31.7.2009.\n\nAppointment to the post of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration) is governed by the provisions of Haryana\n\nState Warehousing Corporation (Officers and Staff)\n\nRegulations, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as \"the\n\nRegulations\"). According to Regulation 8(1) of the\nRegulations, the method of recruitment to the post of\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration) is by promotion from\n\namongst Establishment Assistants. Regulation 8(2) of the\n\nRegulations provides as follows :\n\n\"All promotions, unless otherwise\nprovided, shall be made on seniority-cum-\nmerit basis and seniority alone shall not\nconfer any right to such promotions.\"\n\nAccording to Regulation 6 of the Regulations, no person\n\nshall be appointed to any post in the service unless he is\n\nin possession of qualification and experience specified in\n\nAppendix-B to the Regulations. As per clause 19 of\n\nAppendix-B to the Regulations, for promotion to the post of\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration) 5 years' experience as\n\nEstablishment Assistant is required. Thus, it is not in\n\ndispute that as per the Regulations the vacancy in the\n\ncadre of Assistant Managers (Administration) was to be\n\nfilled by promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n\nfrom among Establishment Assistants having the required\n\nexperience of 5 years.\n\n8. As already indicated, a vacancy of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration) arose on 1.8.2009. As on that date Ram\n\nKumar did not have 5 years' experience as Establishment\nAssistant, as he was promoted to the post of Establishment\n\nAssistant only on 10.11.2004. However, Jagat Ram had more\n\nthan 5 years' experience as he was promoted to the post of\n\nEstablishment Assistant on 16.5.1996. The vacancy of\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration) which arose on 1.8.2009\n\nwas filled up only on 17.11.2009 by promoting Ram Kumar as\n\nAssistant Manager (Administration). By 17.11.2009, Ram\n\nKumar also had acquired experience of 5 years in the cadre\n\nof Establishment Assistants. But Jagat Ram was admittedly\n\nsenior to Ram Kumar.\n\n9. In the Writ Petition filed by Jagat Ram, he had\n\ncontended that the promotion of Ram Kumar to the cadre of\n\nAssistant Managers (Administration) was illegal as he did\n\nnot possess the required experience of 5 years on the date\n\nof occurrence of the vacancy i.e. 1.8.2009. It was alleged\n\nthat the vacancy which arose on 1.8.2009 was deliberately\n\nkept vacant for more than 3 months and that the filling up\n\nof the vacancy was purposefully delayed to enable Ram Kumar\n\nto acquire the minimum required experience of 5 years as\n\nEstablishment Assistant. It was also alleged that since\n\nRam Kumar was working as Junior Scale Stenographer-cum-\n\nPersonal Assistant to the Managing Director of the\nCorporation, the action of the respondents in delaying the\n\nfilling up of the vacancy of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration) was mala fide. Jagat Ram also claimed\n\nthat being the senior-most and meritorious amongst the\n\nEstablishment Assistants, he was the only eligible\n\ncandidate for promotion to the post of Assistant Manager\n\n(Administration) when it fell vacant on 1.8.2009.\n\n10. The Writ Petition filed by Jagat Ram was dismissed on\n\n9.12.2009 by a Single Bench of the High Court apparently\n\neven without issuing notice to the respondents. In the\n\njudgment dated 9.12.2009, the learned Single Judge held\n\nthat Ram Kumar was eligible for promotion on the date when\n\nthe case for promotion was considered. It was also\n\nobserved that the service records placed on record by the\n\npetitioner (Jagat Ram) clearly showed that the record of\n\nRam Kumar was much better than that of Jagat Ram. The\n\nlearned Single Judge rejected the contention that undue\n\nfavour was shown to Ram Kumar by the Managing Director.\n\nAggrieved by the judgment of the learned Single Judge,\n\nJagat Ram filed L.P.A. No. 490 of 2010 which was allowed by\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court.\n11. In the impugned judgment dated 11.10.2010 in L.P.A.\n\nNo.490 of 2010, the Division Bench of the High Court held\n\nthat as per the Regulations governing promotion to the post\n\nof Assistant Manager (Administration), the criterion for\n\npromotion is seniority-cum-merit, but Ram Kumar was wrongly\n\nand illegally given promotion following the criterion of\n\nmerit or even merit-cum-seniority. Relying on the judgment\n\nof this Court in\nState of Mysore and another v. Syed\n\nMahmood and others\n(AIR 1968 SC 1113), the Division Bench\n\npointed out that when promotion is to be made on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit, a senior can be overlooked only\n\nwhen he is found unfit for the higher post. The Division\n\nBench rejected the contention of the Corporation that the\n\nwords \"seniority alone shall not confer any right to such\n\npromotions\" appearing in Regulation 8(2) of the Regulations\n\nindicated that a junior can be preferred to a senior on the\n\nbasis of merit. According to the Division Bench, the words\n\nquoted above only clarify and fortify that promotion is\n\nrequired to be made by applying the criterion of seniority-\n\ncum-merit. The Division Bench found that the selection and\n\npromotion of Ram Kumar was predominantly on the principle\n\nof merit and hence it was in contravention of the\n\nprovisions contained in the Regulations. Accordingly, the\npromotion of Ram Kumar was set aside and the Corporation\n\nwas directed to redo the exercise and complete the same as\n\nexpeditiously as possible but strictly in accordance with\n\nthe Regulation in force. It may be observed that the\n\nDivision Bench did not consider the question whether\n\neligibility of the candidates should have been considered\n\nwith reference to the date of occurrence of the vacancy.\n\n12. The first issue that arises for consideration in these\n\nSpecial Leave Petitions is the effect of the words\n\n\"seniority alone shall not confer any right to such\n\npromotions\" appearing in Regulation 8(2) of the\n\nRegulations.\n\n13. The learned counsel for the petitioners in the Special\n\nLeave Petitions contended that those words gave freedom or\n\nright to the Corporation to prefer a junior to his senior\n\non the basis of better merit. It was contended that in\n\nview of those words, quoted above, seniority should yield\n\nto merit. The contention of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners is devoid of merit. As rightly held by the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court, the words \"seniority\n\nalone shall not confer any right to such promotions\" only\n\nclarify the earlier part of Regulation 8(2), which\nstipulates that \"all promotions, unless otherwise provided,\n\nshall be made on the seniority-cum-merit basis\". The clear\n\nmandate of Regulation 8(2) is that promotions shall be made\n\non seniority-cum-merit basis and not on the basis of\n\nseniority alone or merit alone. To emphasise that\n\npromotion cannot be claimed as a matter of right on the\n\nbasis of seniority and that along with seniority, merit\n\nalso will be considered, it is clarified in the Regulation\n\nitself that \"seniority alone shall not confer any right to\n\nsuch promotions\". The above quoted words do not in any way\n\ndilute or vary the principle that promotions shall be made\n\non seniority-cum-merit basis. They only clarify the\n\nmeaning or implication of the expression \"seniority-cum-\n\nmerit\".\nIn this context, it may be pointed out that in\n\nState of Mysore and another v. Syed Mahmood and others\n(AIR\n\n1968 SC 1113), this Court has held as follows:\n\n\"(4) ..... Where the promotion is based on\nseniority-cum-merit, the officer cannot\nclaim promotion as a matter of right by\nvirtue of his seniority alone. If he is\nfound unfit to discharge the duties of the\nhigher post, he may be passed over and an\nofficer junior to him may be promoted.\"\n14. The next issue that arises for consideration is\n\nwhether the impugned promotion of Ram Kumar was on the\n\nbasis of seniority-cum-merit as required by Regulation 8(2)\n\nof the Regulations. For deciding the said issue, it is\n\nnecessary to understand the meaning of the expression\n\n\"seniority-cum-merit\".\n\n15.\nIn\nState of Kerala and another v. N.M. Thomas and\n\nothers\n[(1976) 2 SCC 310], this Court held that seniority-\n\ncum-merit means that given the minimum necessary merit\n\nrequisite for efficiency of administration, the senior\n\nthough less meritorious shall have priority.\n\n16.\nIn\nB.V. Sivaiah and others v. K. Addanki Babu and\n\nothers\n[(1998) 6 SCC 720], a three Judges' Bench of this\n\nCourt considered the question \"what is meant by seniority-\n\ncum-merit?\" and held as follows :\n\n\"18. We thus arrive at the conclusion\nthat the criterion of \"seniority-cum-\nmerit\" in the matter of promotion\npostulates that given the minimum\nnecessary merit requisite for efficiency\nof administration, the senior, even though\nless meritorious, shall have priority and\na comparative assessment of merit is not\nrequired to be made. For assessing the\nminimum necessary merit, the competent\nauthority can lay down the minimum\nstandard that is required and also\nprescribe the mode of assessment of merit\nof the employee who is eligible for\nconsideration for promotion. Such\nassessment can be made by assigning marks\non the basis of appraisal of performance\non the basis of service record and\ninterview and prescribing the minimum\nmarks which would entitle a person to be\npromoted on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit.\"\n\n17.\nIn\nUnion of India and others v. Lt. Gen. Rajendra\n\nSingh Kadyan and another\n[(2000) 6 SCC 698], this Court\n\nheld that \"seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the requirement\n\nof certain minimum merit or satisfying a benchmark\n\npreviously fixed, and subject to fulfilling the said\n\nrequirement, the promotion is based on seniority. It was\n\nalso held that the requirement of assessment of comparative\n\nmerit was absent in the case of \"seniority-cum-merit\".\n\n18. Following the decision in\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra), this\n\nCourt in\nHarigovind Yadav v. Rewa Sidhi Gramin Bank and\n\nothers\n[(2006) 6 SCC 145] held that where the procedure\n\nadopted did not provide the minimum standard for promotion,\n\nbut only the minimum standard for interview, and did the\n\nselection with reference to comparative marks, it was\n\ncontrary to the rule of \"seniority-cum-merit\". This Court\n\nin that case\nfound that the procedure was not one of\nascertaining the minimum necessary merit and then promoting\n\nthe candidates with the minimum merit in accordance with\n\nseniority, but assessing the comparative merit by drawing\n\nup a merit list, the assessment being with reference to\n\nmarks secured for seniority, performance, postings at\n\nrural/difficult places and interview.\n\n19.\nIn\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava and others v. Samyut\n\nKshetriya Gramin Bank and others\n[(2010) 1 SCC 335], while\n\nconsidering the question \"whether minimum qualifying marks\n\ncould be prescribed for assessment of past performance and\n\ninterview, where the promotions are to be made on the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit?\", this Court observed as\n\nfollows :\n\n\"11. It is also well settled that the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit, for\npromotion, is different from the principle\nof \"seniority\" and the principle of \"merit-\ncum-seniority\". Where promotion is on the\nbasis of seniority alone, merit will not\nplay any part at all. But where promotion\nis on the principle of seniority-cum-merit,\npromotion is not automatic with reference\nto seniority alone. Merit will also play a\nsignificant role. The standard method of\nseniority-cum-merit is to subject all the\neligible candidates in the feeder grade\n(possessing the prescribed educational\nqualification and period of service) to a\nprocess of assessment of a specified\nminimum necessary merit and then promote\nthe candidates who are found to possess the\nminimum necessary merit strictly in the\norder of seniority. The minimum merit\nnecessary for the post may be assessed\neither by subjecting the candidates to a\nwritten examination or an interview or by\nassessment of their work performance during\nthe previous years, or by a combination of\neither two or all the three of the\naforesaid methods. There is no hard-and-\nfast rule as to how the minimum merit is to\nbe ascertained. So long as the ultimate\npromotions are based on seniority, any\nprocess for ascertaining the minimum\nnecessary merit, as a basic requirement,\nwill not militate against the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit.\n\n12. xxx xxx xxx\n\n13. Thus it is clear that a process\nwhereby eligible candidates possessing the\nminimum necessary merit in the feeder posts\nis first ascertained and thereafter,\npromotions are made strictly in accordance\nwith seniority, from among those who\npossess the minimum necessary merit is\nrecognised and accepted as complying with\nthe principle of \"seniority-cum-merit\".\n\nWhat would offend the rule of seniority-\ncum-merit is a process where after\nassessing the minimum necessary merit,\npromotions are made on the basis of merit\n(instead of seniority) from among the\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary\nmerit. If the criteria adopted for\nassessment of minimum necessary merit is\nbona fide and not unreasonable, it is not\nopen to challenge, as being opposed to the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit. We\naccordingly hold that prescribing minimum\nqualifying marks to ascertain the minimum\nmerit necessary for discharging the\nfunctions of the higher post, is not\nviolative of the concept of promotion by\nseniority-cum-merit.\"\n\n20.\nIn\nRupa Rani Rakshit and others v. Jharkhand Gramin\n\nBank and others\n[(2010) 1 SCC 345], the Bank did not\n\nsubject eligible candidates to any process of assessment to\n\nascertain any specified minimum merit, for the purpose of\n\npromoting candidates who possessed the minimum merit, on\n\nthe basis of seniority. On the other hand, the Bank\n\nproceeded to assess their inter se merit with reference to\n\nfour criteria (period of service, educational\n\nqualification, performance during three years and\n\ninterview) by allocating respectively maximum marks of 40,\n\n6, 24 and 30 and thus proceeded to promote those who had\n\nsecured higher marks in the order of merit. This Court\n\nheld that such promotions were not on seniority-cum-merit\n\nbasis.\n\n21. Though learned counsel for the petitioners relied on\n\nthe decision of this Court in\nJagathigowda, C.N. & Others\n\nv. Chairman, Cauvery Gramina Bank & Others\n[(1996) 9 SCC\n]\n,\nthe said decision\ncannot support the case of the\n\npetitioners, because, in the said case the guidelines\n\napplicable to the promotions had specifically provided that\n\"the selection of the eligible candidates should be based\n\non performance of the respective candidates in the Bank\".\n\nHowever, learned counsel invited our attention to the\n\nfollowing observation in paragraph 8 of the judgment:\n\n\"... It is settled proposition of law that\neven while making promotions on the basis\nof seniority-cum-merit, the totality of the\nservice record of the officer concerned has\nto be taken into consideration. ...\"\n\nThe above observation only means that, for the purpose of\n\nconsidering whether the officer fulfils the requirement of\n\nminimum merit or satisfies the benchmark previously fixed,\n\nthe totality of his service record has to be taken into\n\nconsideration. It does not mean that a further assessment\n\nof comparative merit on the basis of the service record is\n\nwarranted even after the officers are found to fulfil the\n\nrequirement of minimum merit and satisfy the benchmark\n\npreviously fixed.\n\n22. Thus it is the settled position that the criterion of\n\nseniority-cum-merit is different from the criterion of\n\nmerit and also the criterion of merit-cum-seniority. Where\n\nthe promotion is based on seniority-cum-merit, the officer\n\ncannot claim promotion as a matter of right by virtue of\n\nhis seniority alone. If he is found unfit to discharge the\nduties of the higher post, he may be passed over and an\n\nofficer junior to him may be promoted. Seniority-cum-merit\n\nmeans that, given the minimum necessary merit required for\n\nefficiency of administration, the senior, though less\n\nmeritorious, shall have priority in the matter of promotion\n\nand there is no question of a further comparative\n\nassessment of the merit of those who were found to have the\n\nminimum necessary merit required for efficiency of\n\nadministration. For assessing the minimum necessary merit,\n\nthe competent authority can lay down the minimum standard\n\nthat is required and also prescribe the mode of assessment\n\nof merit of the employees. Such assessment can be made by\n\nassigning marks on the basis of appraisal of performance on\n\nthe basis of service record and interview and prescribing\n\nthe minimum marks which would entitle a person to be\n\nconsidered for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit. The concept of \"seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the\n\nrequirement of certain minimum merit or satisfying a\n\nbenchmark previously fixed and, subject to fulfilling the\n\nsaid requirement, promotion is based on seniority. There\n\nis no further assessment of the comparative merits of those\n\nwho fulfil such requirement of minimum merit or satisfy the\n\nbenchmark previously fixed. On the other hand, the\nprinciple of \"merit-cum-seniority\" puts greater emphasis on\n\nmerit and ability and seniority plays a less significant\n\nrole. Seniority is given weightage only when merit and\n\nability are more or less equal among the candidates\n\nconsidered for promotion.\n\n23. In the light of the above legal position with regard\n\nto the principle of \"seniority-cum-merit\", it is clear that\n\nthe impugned promotion of Ram Kumar was not on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit but was on the basis of merit. The\n\nwritten statement filed by the Corporation in L.P.A. No.\n\n490 of 2010 reveals that while considering the candidates\n\nfor promotion, both Jagat Ram and Ram Kumar were found\n\nsuitable for promotion and that even though Jagat Ram was\n\nsenior to Ram Kumar, Ram Kumar was given promotion on the\n\nground that he had better merits. Justifying the promotion\n\nof Ram Kumar in preference to the appellant Jagat Ram, it\n\nwas stated in the written statement as follows :\n\n\"2. xxx xxx xxx\n\nAs is evident from a perusal of\nAnnexure P-4, all the Assistants who were\neligible for promotion to the rank of\nAssistant Manager (Administration) having\ncompleted 5 years of service as Assistant\nwere considered on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit by the competent authority. The\nsenior most candidate i.e. Shri R.K. Nayyar\nhad bad service record in as much as there\nwere three charge-sheets pending under\nRule-7 against him besides penalty imposed\nupon him. The second candidate in\nseniority was the petitioner Shri Jagat\nRam, whose ACR dossier for the last 10\nyears contained one grading as Very Good\nand 9 were good. The third candidate, Smt.\nPushpa Devi again has 8 very good, =\noutstanding, one good and = average grading\nin her ACR resume. Penalty of stoppage of\none increment without cumulative effect was\nimposed upon her on 18.12.2008. She was\nalso issued a warning on 04.12.2008. The\nrespondent No.3, Shri Ram Kumar, had all\nthe 10 Annual Confidential Reports as\nOutstanding and there were no departmental\nproceedings pending or concluded against\nhim and thus on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit as provided in the Regulations, the\ncandidature of respondent No.3 was found to\nbe most suitable and accordingly the\ncompetent authority, vide detailed and\nreasoned orders, promoted the respondent\nNo.3 to the rank of Assistant Manager\n(Administration). ...\"\n\nIn reply to Jagat Ram's contention that selection had to be\n\nmade from a panel of three suitable officials and that Ram\n\nKumar could not have been considered as he was at serial\n\nNo.4, the Corporation stated in the written statement as\n\nfollows :\n\n\"3. ...The contention is totally devoid of\nmerits. The Chief Secretary Punjab vide\nNotification dated 28.06.1961, copy of\nwhich is attached as Annexure R-1/1 had\nclarified the issue and has ordered that in\nthe first instance, list of eligible\nofficers/officials, who fulfil the\nprescribed experience etc. for promotion is\nto be drawn up and then out of this list,\nsuch officers/officials as are considered\nunsuitable for promotion are to be weeded\nout and a list of only those who are\nsuitable for promotion has to be drawn up.\nSelection thereafter is to be confined to\nthree suitable officers/officials of the\nlist. ... Selection for every vacancy has,\ntherefore, to be made from the slab of\nthree officers/officials, who are\nconsidered fit for promotion and unless a\njunior among them happens to be of\nexceptional merit and suitability, the\nsenior-most will be selected.\n\nIn the present case, in the\nCorporation there were only four\nEstablishment Assistants who were eligible\nand the candidature of all the four was\nconsidered. Out of four, two were found\nunsuitable and out of the remaining two\nsuitable officials, the respondent No.3\nbeing most suitable and meritorious was\nselected and promoted to the post of\nAssistant Manager (Administration).\"\n\nTherefore, it is clear that even according to the\n\nCorporation, both Jagat Ram and Ram Kumar fulfilled the\n\nrequirement of minimum merit and were suitable for\n\npromotion but Ram Kumar, though junior, was preferred as he\n\nwas found to be more meritorious. This was obviously in\n\nviolation of the principle of seniority-cum-merit. Since\nboth Jagat Ram and Ram Kumar fulfilled the requirement of\n\nminimum merit and were found suitable for promotion and\n\nsince Jagat Ram was senior to Ram Kumar, Jagat Ram was\n\nentitled to be promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit. Consequently, the promotion of Ram Kumar was liable\n\nto be set aside as was rightly done by the Division Bench\n\nof the High Court.\n\n24. In the light of the discussion above, the Special\n\nLeave Petitions are devoid of merit and hence they are\n\ndismissed.\n\n25. There will, however, be no order as to costs.\n\n...............................J.\nCYRIAC JOSEPH\nNew Delhi;\n\nFebruary 23, 2011.",
