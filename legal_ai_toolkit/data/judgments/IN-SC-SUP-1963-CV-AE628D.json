In 1956 he was posted to Jullunder where\nhe remained till he proceeded on leave preparatory to\nretirement sometime in December 1960. His leave was\nsanctioned on December 18, 1960, and was notified in the\nPunjab Gazette dated January 27, 1961. On June 3, 1961, the\nGovernor of Punjab passed orders suspending the appellant\nwith immediate effect and revoking his leave as the\nGovernment had decided that a departmental enquiry be\ninstituted against him under s. 7 of the Punjab Civil\nServices (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. The Governor\nfurther passed an order under r. 3.26(d) by which \"A\ngovernment servant under suspension on a charge of\nmisconduct shall not be ............ permitted to retire on\nhis reaching the date of compulsory retirement but should be\nretained in service until the enquiry into the charge is\nconcluded and a-final order is passed thereon.\" The order\nunder r. 3.26(d) was that in view of the appellant's\nreaching the age of superannuation on June 16, 1961, he\nshould be retained in service beyond that date till the\ncompletion of the departmental enquiry. These orders\nreached the appellant, according to him, only on June 19,\n1961, but they were published in the Punjab Government\nGazette Extraordinary dated June 10, 1961. By a writ\npetition filed under\nArt. 226\nof the Constitution of India\nbefore the High Court of Punjab, the appellant challenged\nthe legality of the orders of suspension, revocation of\nleave, retention in service after the date of superannuation\nand institution of the departmental enquiry, on the grounds\ninter alia, (1) that the rules governing his service did not\nempower the Governor to pass the impugned orders, and (2)\nthat the impugned orders were passed mala fide by or at the\ninstance\nof the Chief Minister, who was in-charge of the department\nof Health and who was personally hostile to him by reason of\ncertain incidents, and that the orders were promoted by the\ndesire on the part of the Chief Minister to wreak personally\nhis vengeance on the appellant.\nHELD:(i) Under r. 8.15 of the Punjab Civil Services\n(Punishment and Appeal) Rules there is no restriction on the\npower of revocation of leave with respect to the time when\nit is to be exercised, and the authority empowered to grant\nleave has the discretion to revoke it even after the officer\nto whom leave had been sanctioned had proceeded on leave,\n(ii)The date from which a Government servant is on leave\npreparatory to retirement cannot be treated as the date of\nhis retirement from service, and an order of suspension of\nthe Government servant during such leave is valid.\n(iii)Though the orders of suspension and revocation\ndated June 3, 1961, were actually communicated to the\nappellant only after the date of his retirement, since he\nwas on leave the said orders were effective from the moment\nthey were issued.\nBachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab, A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 395\nand State of Punjab v. Sodhi Sukhdev Singh, [1961] 2 S.C.R.\n371, distinguished.\n(iv)The appellant had no absolute right to opt for retire-\nment on his attaining the age of superannuation, that any\nsuch option was subject to r. 3.26(d) which applied to him\nand that his case came under that rule as he was on the date\nof his compulsory retirement under suspension on charges of\nmisconduct.\n(v)Whenever any charge of misconduct is under enquiry by\nthe Government, be it informally or formally, the Government\nis competent to suspend the Government servant and, if the\nrequirements ofthe case require, to take action under\ns. 3.26(d).\n(vi)The provisions of r. 3.26(d) do not contravene Arts. 19\nand 23 of the Constitution of India.\n(vii)Rendering of the tape recorded conversation can be\nlegal evidence by way of corroborating the statements of a\nperson who deposes that the other speaker and he carried on\nthat conversation or even of the statement of a person who\nmay depose that he overheard the conversation between the\ntwo persons and what they actually stated bad been tape\nrecorded. Weight to be given to such evidence will depend\non the other factors which may be established in a\nparticular case.\nPer Das, Subba Rao and Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ.-(i) Where an\nauthority exercising a power has taken into account as a\nrelevant factor something which it could not properly take\ninfo account, the exercise of the power would be bad. Where\nthe purposes sought to be achieved are mixed, some relevant\nand some alien to the purpose, the difficulty is resolved by\nfinding the\ndominant purpose which impelled the action, and where the\npower itself is conditioned by a purpose, the courts would\ninvalidate the exercise of the power when an irrelevant\npurpose is proved to have entered the mind of the authority.\n(ii)The Court is not an appellate forum where the correct-\nness of an order of Government could be canvassed and it has\nno jurisdiction to substitute its own view as to the\nnecessity or desirability of initiating disciplinary\nproceedings, for the entirety of the power, jurisdiction in\nthat regard is vested in law inthe Government. The\nonly question which could be consideredby the court is\nwhether the authority vested with the power has paid\nattention to or taken into account circumstances, eventsor ma\ntters\nwholly extraneous to the purpose for which the powerwas veste\nd,\nor whether the proceedings have been initiated malafide\nfor satisfying a private or personal grudge of the authority\nagainst the officer. If the act is in excess of the power\ngranted or is an abuse or misuse of power, the matter is\ncapable of interference and rectification by the Court.\n(iii)It is not correct to say that mala fides in the\nsense of improper motive could be established only by direct\nevidence, that is, that it must be discernible from the\norder impugned or must be shown from the noting in the file\nwhich preceded that order. If bad faith would vitiate the\norder, the same can be deduced as a reasonable and\ninescapable inference from proved facts.\nMunicipal Council of Sydney v. Cambell, [1925] A.C. 338,\nShort v. Poole Corporation [1926] 1 Ch. 66, Vatcher v.\nPaull, [1915] A.C. 372, Sadler v. Shefield Corporation,\n[19241 1 Ch. 483, Earl Fitzwilliam v. Minister of T. & C.\nPlanning, 119511 2 K. B. 284 and General Assembly of Free\nChurch v. Overatoun, [1904] A.C. 515, relied on.\nPer Dayal and Mudholkar, JJ. (dissenting). On the facts,\nthe dominant motive which induced the Government to take ac-\ntion against the appellant was not to take disciplinary\nproceedings against him for misconduct which it bona fide\nbelieved he had committed, but to wreak vengeance on him for\nincurring his wrath and for the discredit that he had\nbrought on the Chief Minister; the impugned orders were\nvitiated by mala fides, in that they were motivated by an\nimproper purpose which was outside that for which the power\nof discretion was conferred on Government ; and the said\norders revoking the leave granted and placing the appellant\nunder suspension and directing an enquiry into the charges\nagainst him, should be set aside.\nQuaere, whether the provision in\nArt. 310(1)\nof the Consti-\ntution of India that \"members of a Civil Service of a State\nhold office during the pleasure of the Governor\", conferred\na power on the State Government to compel an officer to\ncontinue in service of the State against his will apart from\nservice Rules which might govern the matter even after the\nage of superannuation was reached.\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal NO'. 80 of 1963.\nAppeal from the judgment and order dated April 4, 1962, of\nthe Punjab High Court in Civil Writ No. 961 of 1961.\nThe appellant appeared in person.\n\nC.K. Daphtary, Attorney General, Mohinder Singh Punnu,\nDeputy Advocate-General, Punjab and B. R. G. K. Achar for P.\nD. Menon, for the respondent.\n\nSeptember 2, 1963. The judgment of S. K. Das, K. Subba Rao\nand N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by N.\nRajagopala Ayyangar, JJ. The dissenting Opinion of Raghubar\nDayal and J. R. Mudholkar, JJ., was delivered by Raghubar\nDayal, J.\n\nAYYANGAR, J.-This appeal is against a judgment of the High\nCourt, Punjab, dismissing a petition filed by the appellant\nin that Court under\nArt. 226\nof the Constitution and has\nbeen preferred pursuant to a certificate of fitness granted\nunder\nArt. 133(1) (c).\n\nThe appellant was a Civil Surgeon in the employment of the\nState Government who had been granted leave preparatory to\nretirement, and subsequently, in June 1961, orders were\npassed by Government (1) revoking the leave he had\noriginally been granted and recalling him to duty, (2)\nsimultaneously placing him under suspension pending the\nresult of an inquiry into certain charges of misconduct, and\n(3) ordering a departmental inquiry against him. The\nlegality of these orders was challenged by the appellant in\nthe petition that he filed in the High Court. The petition\nwas dismissed by the learned Judges, but on application by\nthe appellant, he was granted a certificate of fitness on\nthe strength of which he has filed the present appeal.\nThe facts of the case leading up to the appeal before us are\nset out by our learned Brother Dayal, J. in his judgment\nfully and in great detail and so we have thought it unneces-\nsary to cumber this judgment with them. Two points were\nurged before us by the appellant who argued the case in\nperson and presented the facts and the law with commend-\nable clarity and moderation. The first of them was that\nevery one of the impugned orders of June 1961 (a) recalling\nhim from the leave previously granted, (b) placing him under\nsuspension pending an inquiry, and (c) starting an inquiry\nagainst him were illegal for the reason that such action on\nthe part of Government was contrary to and not permitted by\nthe relevant Service Rules applicable to him. The second\nground of challenge was that these orders, assuming them to\nbe within the power of Government on a proper interpretation\nof the rules were passed mala fide, by or at the instance of\nthe Chief Minister, Punjab, who was personally hostile to\nhim by reason of certain incidents and circumstances which\nhe set out and that the impugned orders were prompted by the\ndesire on the part of the Chief Minister to wreak personally\nhis vengeance on the appellant.\n\nThe relevant rules on the topic as well as their interpre-\ntation have all been dealt in the judgment of Dayal, J., and\nwe agree in the main with his conclusion that the orders\nimpugned were not beyond the power of the Government. We\nshould, however, add that we should not be taken to have\naccepted the interpretation which Dayal, J., has placed on\neach one of the several rules which he has considered.\nBesides, we should not be taken to have acceded to the\nsubmission of the learned Attorney-General who appeared for\nthe respondent-State, that the provision in\nArt. 310(1)\nof\nthe Constitution that \"members of a Civil Service of a State\nhold office during the pleasure of the Governor\", conferred\na power on the State Government to compel an officer to\ncontinue in service of the State against his will apart from\nservice rules which might govern the matter even after the\nage of superannuation was reached, or where he was employed\nfor a defined term, even after the term of his appointment\nwas over. We consider that to construe the expression \"the\npleasure of the Governor\" in that manner would be patently\nunwarranted besides being contrary to what this Court said\nin\nState of Bihar v. Abdul Majid\n(1). In the view which we\nhave taken on the second ground of challenge to the orders\nof Government we have not considered it necessary to examine\nin detail the several rules to which our attention was drawn\nor their proper interpretation.\n\nWe shall now proceed to deal with the second point\n(1) [1954] S.C.R. 786 at p. 799.\nurged before us viz., that the order was passed mala fide\nand so could not be allowed to stand. Before entering into\nthe details of the allegations made, the evidence in their\nsupport and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, we\nconsider it useful to state the principles underlying this\nbranch of the law. The Service Rules which are statutory\nvest the power to pass the impugned orders on the Govern-\nment. The expression 'Government' in the context is the\nfunctionary within the State who is vested with executive\npower in the relevant field. Of course, the Constitution\nvests the executive power in a State in the Governor but he\nis constitutionally directed to act on the aid and advice of\nhis Ministers. In the case before us it is common ground\nthat it was the Chief Minister who was incharge of the\nHealth Department in which the appellant was employed and it\nwas' therefore the Chief Minister as the Minister in-charge\nof that portfolio who initiated these proceedings though the\nformal orders of the Ministry were issued by the Secretaries\netc. of the Department in the name of the Governor. For the\npurposes of the present controversy the functionary who took\naction and on whose instructions the action was taken\nagainst the appellant was undoubtedly the Chief Minister and\nif that functionary was actuated by mala fides in taking\nthat action it is clear that such action would be vitiated.\nIn this context it is necessary to add that though the\nlearned Attorney-General at first hinted that he would raise\na legal contention, that even if mala fides were established\nagainst the Chief Minister still the impugned orders could\nnot be set aside, he did not further pursue the matter, but\nproceeded, if we may say so rightly, to persuade us that\nmala fides was not made out by the evidence on record. Such\nan argument, if right, would mean that even fraud or\ncorruption, leaving aside mala fides, would not be\nexaminable by a Court and would not vitiate administrative\norders. As Lord Denning said in Lazarus Estates, Ltd. v.\nBeasley(1)\n\"No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be\nallowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud.\" In the\ncircumstances we do not consider it necessary to deal with\nthis aspect more fully or in greater detail. If this were\nput aside, the second ground of attack on the orders may be\nviewed from two related aspects--of ultra vires\n(1)[1956] 1. All E.R. 341, 345.\npure and simple and secondly as an infraction of the rule\nthat every power vested in a public body or authority has to\nbe used honestly, bona fide and reasonably, though the two\noften slide into each other. Thus Sir Lyman Duff, speaking\nin Municipal Council of Sydney v. Campbell(1) in the context\nof an allegation that the statutory power vested in a\nmunicipal corporation to acquire property had been used in\nbad faith which was held to have been proved stated :\n\n\"A body such as the Municipal Council of\nSydney, authorised to take land compulsorily\nfor specified purposes, will not be permitted\nto exercise its powers for different purposes,\nand if it attempts to do so, the Courts will\ninterfere. As Lord Loreburn said, in Marquess\nof Clanricarde v. Congested Districts Board\n(79 J.P. 481) :\n\n\"Whether it does so or not is a question of\nfact.\" Where the proceedings of the Council\nare attacked upon this ground, the party\nimpeaching those proceedings must, of course,\nprove that the Council, though professing to\nexercise its powers for the statutory purpose,\nis in fact employing them in furtherance of\nsome ulterior object.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Short v. Poole Corporation(\")\nPollock M. R. observed :\n\n\"The appellants (represented before the Court\nby Maugham K. C.-afterwards Lord Maugham) do\nnot contest the proposition that where an\nauthority is constituted under statute to\ncarry out statutory powers with which it is\nentrusted, . . ... . if an attempt is made to\nexercise those powers corruptly-as under the\ninfluence of bribery, or mala fide-for some\nimproper purpose, such an attempt must fail.\nIt is null and void see Reg. v. Governors of\nDarlington School (6 Q.B. 682, 715).\"\n\nIn, the same case Warrington, L.T., said\n\"No public body can be regarded as having\nstatutory authority to act in bad faith or\nfrom corrupt motives and any action purporting\nto be that of the body, but proved to be\ncommitted in bad faith or from corrupt\n(1) [1925] A.C. 338.\n\n(2) [1926] 1 Ch. 66, 85.\nmotives, would certainly be held to be\ninoperative. It may be also possible to prove\nthat an act of the public body, though\nperformed in good faith and without the taint\nof corruption, was so clearly founded on alien\nand irrelevant grounds as to be outside the\nauthority conferred upon the body, and\ntherefore inoperative. It is difficult to\nsuggest any act which would be held ultra\nvires under this head, though performed bona\nfide,'\n(Vide pages 90-91).\"\n\nIt was really the first aspect of ultra vires that was\nstressed by Lord Parker when in Vatcher v. Paull(1) at page\n378 of the report he spoke of a power exercised for a\npurpose or with an intention beyond the scope of or not\njustified by the instrument creating the power. In legal\nparlance it would be a case of a fraud on a power, though no\ncorrupt motive or bargain is imputed. In this sense, if it\ncould be shown that an authority exercising a power has\ntaken into account-it may even be bona fide and with the\nbest of intentions,--as a relevant factor something which it\ncould not properly take into account, in deciding whether or\nnot to exercise the power or the manner or extent to which\nit should be exercised, the exercise of the power would be\nbad. Sometimes Courts are confronted with cases where the\npurposes sought to be achieved are mixed,-some relevant and\nsome alien to the purpose. The courts have, on occasions,\nresolved the difficulty by finding out the dominant purpose\nwhich impelled the action, and where the power itself is\nconditioned by a purpose, have proceeded to invalidate the\nexercise of the power when any irrelevant purpose is proved\nto have entered the mind of the authority (See Sadler v.\nSheffield Corporation(2) as also Lord Denning's observation\nEarl Fitzwilliam etc. v. Minister of T. & C. Planning(3).\nThis is on the principle that if in such a situation the\ndominant purpose is unlawful then the act itself is unlawful\nand it is not cured by saying that they had another purpose\nwhich was lawful.\n\nAs we said earlier, the two grounds of ultra vires and mala\nfides are thus most often inextricably mixed. Treat-\n(1) [1915] A.C. 372. (2) [1924] 1 Ch. 483.\n\n(3) [1951] 2 K.B. 284, 307.\ning it as a question of ultra vires, the question is what is\nthe nature of the power?; has it been granted to achieve a\ndefinite object?-in which case it would be conditioned by\nthe purpose for which it is vested. Taking the present case\nof the power vested in Government to pass the impugned\norders, it could not be doubted that it is vested in\nGovernment for accomplishing a defined public purpose viz.,\nto ensure probity and purity in the public services by\nenabling disciplinary penal action against the members of\nthe service suspected to be guilty of misconduct. The\nnature of the power thus discloses its purpose. In that\ncontext the use of that power for achieving analien\npurpose-wreaking the minister's vengeance on theofficer\nwould be mala fide and a colourable exercise ofthat\npower, and would therefore be struck down by theCourts.\nIn this connection we might cite a dictum of Lord Lindley in\nGeneral Assembly of Free Church etc.v. Overtoun(1) when the\nlearned Lord said at page\n695 :\n\n\"I take it to be clear that there is a\ncondition implied' in this as well as in other\ninstruments which create powers, namely, that\nthe power shall be used bona fide for the\npurposes for which they are conferred.\"\n\nDoubtless, he who seeks to invalidate or nullify any act or\norder must establish the charge of bad faith, an abuse or a\nmisuse by Government of its powers. While the indirect\nmotive or purpose, or bad faith or personal ill-will is not\nto be held established except on clear proof thereof, it is\nobviously difficult to establish the state of a man's mind,\nfor that is what the appellant has to establish in this\ncase, though this may sometimes be done (See Edgington v.\nFitzmaurice(2)). The difficulty is not lessened when one\nhas to establish that a person in the position of a minister\napparently acting on the legitimate exercise of power has,\nin fact, been acting mala fide in the sense of pursuing an\nillegitimate aim. We must, however, demur to the suggestion\nthat mala fide in the sense of improper motive should be\nestablished only by direct evidence that is that it must be\ndiscernible from the order impugned or must be shown from\nthe notings in\n(1) [1904] A.C. 515, 695.\n\n(2) [1885] 29 C.D. 459.\nthe file which preceded the order. If bad faith would\nvitiate the order, the same can, in our opinion, be deduced\nas a reasonable and inescapable inference from proved facts.\nPausing here, we might summarise the position by stating\nthat the Court is not an appellate forum where the\ncorrectness of an order of Government could be canvassed\nand, indeed,. it has no 'Jurisdiction to substitute its own\nview as to the necessity or desirability of initiating\ndisciplinary proceedings, for the entirety of the power,\njurisdiction and discretion in that regard is vested by law\nin the Government. The only question which could be\nconsidered by the Court is whether the authority vested with\nthe power has paid attention to or taken into account\ncircumstances, events or matters wholly extraneous to the\npurpose for which the power was vested, or whether the\nproceedings have been initiated mala fide for satisfying a\nprivate or personal grudge of the authority against the\nofficer. Ifthe act is in excess of the power granted or\nis an abuseor misuse of power, the matter is capable of\ninterferenceand rectification by the Court. In such an\nevent the fact that the authority concerned denies the\ncharge of mala fides, or asserts the absence of oblique mo-\ntives or of its having taken into consideration improper or\nirrelevant matter does not preclude the Court from enquiring\ninto the truth of the allegations made against the authority\nand affording appropriate reliefs to the party aggrieved by\nsuch illegality or abuse of power in the event of the\nallegations being made out.\n\nBefore entering on a discussion of the question whether the\nappellant has established that the action of Government was\nvitiated by mala fides, we consider it Pertinent to make a\nfew preliminary observation. In considering the evidence we\nhave kept in view the high position which the Chief Minister\nholds in the State and are conscious of the fact that\ncharges of a personal nature made against such a dignitary\nare not to be lightly accepted. We have also borne in mind\nthat charges of personal hostility are easily and very often\nmade by persons who are subjected to penal or quasi penal\nproceedings against those who initiate them, and have\ntherefore made full allowance for these factors, and we have\nexamined\nand weighed the evidence with anxious care. We would only\nadd that the fact that two of our brethren feel differently\non this matter has heightened our responsibility and in the\ncare to be bestowed in appreciating the evidence. The\nConstitution enshrines and guarantees the rule of law and\n\nArt. 226\nis designed to ensure that each and every authority\nin the State, including the Government, acts bona fide and\nwithin the limits of its power and we consider that when a\nCourt is satisfied that there is an abuse or misuse of power\nand its Jurisdiction is invoked, it is incumbent on the\nCourt to afford justice to the individual. It is with these\nconsiderations in mind that we approach the facts of this\ncase.\n\nThe allegations in the writ petition filed by the appellant\non this matter may be summarised as follows :\n\n(1) The appellant was requested by the Chief\nMinister to perform an operation on his\nson--Surinder Singh-in April 1960. The\noperation was performed. The Chief Minister\ndesired that after the operation his son\nshould stay under the care of the appellant at\nJullundur during his convalescence. Surinder,\nhowever, left the appellant's place and the\nChief Minister became angry for the supposed\nnegligence of the appellant in permitting this\nto happen.\n\n(2) The Chief Minister himself and the\nmembers of his family made several requests to\nthe appellant to show undue favours to certain\npatients who were recommended to the\nappellant. These were complied with, but when\nsubsequently the appellant refused to comply\nwith further requests the Chief Minister\nturned hostile.\n\n(3) The Chief Minister's wife had been\nasking for medicines to be sent to her by the\nappellant for the use of herself, and her\nrelations from the hospital stores of\njullundur. The appellant, however, sent her\nthe medicines, though not from the hospital\nbut buying them himself in the market. The\nChief Minister's wife also wanted some\nexpensive articles like Singer Sewing machines\netc. to be sent to her gratis. This the ap-\n\npellant did but the refusal to comply with\nfur-\nther demands of the same type angered the\nChief Minister.\n\n(4) One Kirpa Singh was working as the\nmanager of an automobile concern known as\nNational Motors, Jullundur which was either\ndirectly or indirectly owned by Surinder-the\nson of the Chief Minister. The appellant at\nthe instance of the Chief Minister\naccommodated Kirpa Singh in his own house and\nbesides provided him with board. This went on\nfor about 7 months but in or about April, 1960\nthe appellant desired Kirpa Singh to look out\nfor a lodging and board elsewhere and the\nlatter had to do so. This was a further cause\nof irritation and anger for the Chief\nMinister.\n\n(5) Several matters recited above were in\nApril 1960 or thereabouts and as a result of\nthe hostility developed by reason of these the\nappellant was accused, in September 1960, of\nshowing undue favours to Akali prisoners who\nwere lodged at the District Jail at Jullundur.\nThis allegation was false and was later not\npressed.\n\n(6) The Chief Minister desired to have the\nhelp of the appellant as an expert to instruct\nthe police officers who were conducting the\nprosecution in what is known as the Karnal\nMurder case. The appellant had given some\nsort of assurance to the Chief Minister that\nthe prosecution would succeed. It failed\nbefore the Sessions Judge and subsequently the\nappeal by the State was dismissed by the High\nCourt of Punjab and finally an application for\nspecial leave was dismissed by this Court.\n\nThe Chief Minister became very angry with the\nappellant because the assurance given to him\nthat the prosecution would succeed had been\nbelied and the Chief Minister felt chagrined\nat the result.\n\n(7) One Dr. Dhillon who was a Junior Medical\nOfficer in the Punjab Medical Service\naccompanied the Chief Minister as a medical\nattendant in 1956-57. Under the rules the\nChief Minister was not entitled to this type\nof medical attention. There was some dispute\nas regards the\nsalary payable to Dr. Dhillon during the\nperiod when he was with the Chief Minister.\n\nThe appellant was requested to give a false\ncertificate regarding the services of Dr.\nDhillon. The Chief Minister complained that\nthough several years had passed, Dhillon's\nsalary for the 45 days that he had been with\nthe Chief Minister had not yet been paid to\nhim. The appellant refused to comply this\ndemand and this was a further source of\nirritation and hostility.\n\nThe appellant's further case is that as a result of these\nincidents or sources of irritation and displeasure of the\nChief Minister, the Chief Minister was thinking of taking\nsome steps against him and that he got a complaint against\nhim on October 29, 1960 which he sent up for investigation.\nThe charge then made against the appellant was that on July\n5, 1960 he had refused to examine a woman-patient who had\ncome to the hospital with an out-door chit and that the\nhusband of the woman was forced to pay a sum of Rs. 16.00\nfor her examination at his residence. On the excuse that\nthis complaint had been made, the appellant was transferred\nfrom Jullundur to Amritsar by an order dated December 6,\n1960. It was stated by the appellant that in the State\nofficers were usually transferred only during the months\nMarch or April, so that the education of their children etc.\nmight not be interrupted by the change of station, but that\nhis transfer in December was therefore out of the ordinary\nand done with a view to inconvenience and humiliate him and\ndeprive him of his practice at Jullundur. The appellant\nthus having realised the hostility of the Chief Minister and\nnot desiring to continue much longer in service, made an\napplication for leave preparatory to retirement. He was\nreaching the age of 55 on June 15, 1961 and he applied for\nleave until that period. His leave was sanctioned with\neffect from December 18, 1960 and this was gazetted on\nJanuary 27, 1961. It is this leave that was revoked by the\nimpugned orders on June 3, 1961 and under these the ap-\npellant was placed under suspension and an inquiry was\nstarted later in the matter.\n\nBetween these two dates i.e. between December 1960 and June\n1961, however, some events happened which\n48-2 S. C. India/64\nare set out in the petition require to be stated. It would\nbe seen that when the leave preparatory to retirement which\nwas applied for was sanctioned, the Government had already\nwith them the complaint made on October 29, 1960 relating to\nthe charge that the appellant had improperly demanded a sum\nof Rs. 16.00 from a patient desiring treatment at the\nJullundur hospital. That related to an incident of July\n1960 and was apparently not thought to be serious enough to\njustify the refusal of the leave applied for. But after the\nleave was sanctioned, in the issue of the Weekly newspaper\nBlitz dated the 15th January, 1961 there appeared an article\nin which allegations were made against the Chief Minister.\nSeveral of the allegations were those which we have\nmentioned earlier as having been made by the appellant in\nhis petition and stated to be the reasons for the hostility\nof the Chief Minister. The appellant however was not named\nas such in the article. It must however have been apparent\nto those acquainted with the matter that it was the\nappellant from whom these favours were sought or obtained by\nthe Chief Minister. It is the case of the appellant that\nthe Chief Minister who was in Delhi at that time must have\nbeen apprised of the contents of the article even on January\n13, 1961 and this does not seem improbable because it is\ncommon knowledge that copies of this weekly are available in\nDelhi even two days before the date it bears. In the\nabsence of any affidavit from the Chief Minister, and there\nis none on the record, it is not possible to say whether the\narticle in the Weekly was or was not seen by him on the\n13th. On that day-January 13, 1961, however, the Inspector\n(Vigilance), Jullundur addressed a communication to the\nappellant enquiring whether the appellant who had by then\ngone to Kanpur (it is to he remembered he was then on leave)\nwould come to Jullundur for clarifying certain points in\nrelation to an inquiry which had been ordered by the Punjab\nGovernment. It is stated that this was in connection with\nthe complaint regarding the improper receipt of Rs. 16.00\nfrom a patient who had come to the hospital for treatment in\nJuly 1960. The Vigilance Inspector made some inquiries of\nthe appellant and examined the records at the hospital in\nFebruary, 1961. On March 18, 1961 the appellant's wife\nwrote a letter to the 'Blitz' confirming the allegations\nagainst the Chief Minister which had already appeared in\nthat paper in its issue of January 15, 1961 and in the same\nmonth-March 1961 the appellant's wife circulated Members of\nParliament and others with the details ofthe allegations\nfound in the newspaper. It is the case ofthe appellant\nthat these matters occasioned the hostility of the Chief\nMinister and that the impugned orders passedin June 1961\nwere passed not bona fide for the purposeof conducting\nan inquiry into his conduct but to harassand humiliate\nhim and thus wreak vengeance on him for the part that he\nplayed in bringing down the reputation of the Chief Minister\nby the disclosures. As we observed earlier, if the\nappellant is able to establish that the main object and\npurpose of the initiation of the inquiry was not in the\ninterest of the Service or to ascertain any misconduct on\nthe part of the appellant, but that the dominant motive and\npurpose was the harassment and humiliation of the appellant\nfor his refusal to yield to the demands of the Chief\nMinister or the members of his family at some stages, and in\ndefaming him openly at the later stage, it would clearly be\na case of mala fides and the impugned orders have to be set\naside.\n\nWe shall first take up for consideration the several\nallegations that have been made and see whether they had\nbeen satisfactorily made out. Before proceeding further it\nis necessary to state that allegations of a personal cha-\nracter having been made against the Chief Minister, there\ncould only be two ways in which they could be repelled.\nFirst, if the allegations were wholly irrelevant, and even\nif true, would not afford a basis upon which the appellant\nwould be entitled to any relief, they need not have been\nanswered and the appellant could derive no benefit from the\nrespondents not answering them. We have already dealt with\nthis matter and have made it clear that if they were true\nand made out by acceptable evidence, they could not be\nignored as irrelevant ; (2) If they were relevant, in the\nabsence of their intrinsic improbability the allegations\ncould be countered by documentary or affidavit evidance\nwhich would show their falsity. In the absence of such\nevidence they could be disproved only by the party against\nwhom the allegations were made denying the\nsame on oath. In the present case there were serious al-\nlegations made against the Chief Minister and there were\nseveral matters of which he alone could have personal\nknowledge and therefore which he alone could deny, but what\nwas, however, placed before the Court in answer to the\ncharges made against the Chief Minister was an affidavit by\nthe Secretary to Government in the Medical Department who\ncould only speak from official records and obviously not\nfrom personal knowledge about the several matters which were\nalleged against the -Chief Minister. In these circumstances\nwe do not think it would be proper to brush aside the\nallegations made by the appellant particularly in respect of\nthose matters where they are supported by some evidence of a\ndocumentary nature seeing that there is no contradiction by\nthose persons who alone could have contradicted them. In\nmaking this observation we have in mind the Chief Minister\nas well as Mrs. Kairon against whom allegations have been\nmade but who have not chosen to state on oath the true facts\naccording to them.\n\nBefore passing on to a consideration of the details of the\nseveral allegations there is one matter to which we ought to\nmake reference at this stage and that is the admissibility\nand evidentiary value of the tape-recorded talks which have\nbeen produced as part of his supporting evidence by the\nappellant. The learned judges of the High Court without\nsaying in so many terms that these were inadmissible in\nevidence, this being the contention raised by the\nrespondent-State, have practically put them out of\nconsideration for the reason that tape-recordings were\ncapable of being tampered with. With respect we cannot\nagree. There are few documents and possibly no piece of\nevidence which could not be tampered with, but that would\ncertainly not be a ground on which Courts could reject\nevidence as inadmissible or refuse to consider it. It was\nnot contended before us the tape-recordings were\ninadmissible. In the ultimate analysis the factor mentioned\nwould have a bearing only on the weight to be attached to\nthe evidence and not on its admissibility. Doubtless, if in\nany particular case there is a well-grounded suspicion, not\neven say proof, that a tape-recording has been tampered\nwith, that would be a good ground for\nthe Court to discount wholly its evidentiary value. But in\nthe present case we do not see any basis for any such\nsuggestion. The tape-recordings were referred to by the\nappellant in his writ petition as part of the evidence on\nwhich he proposed to rely in support of his assertions as\nregards the substance of what passed between him and the\nChief Minister and the members of the latter's family on the\nseveral matters which wece the subject of allegations in the\npetition. Before the written statement of the State was\nfiled, the respondent-State made an application to the Court\non August 23, 1961 in which they averred :\n\n\"The respondents are not in a position to give\na complete and full reply to the assertions\nmade by the petitioner without inspecting the\noriginal records and without knowing and (sic)\nrenderings of the so-called tape-recordings\nmentioned by the petitioner in his\naforesaid petitionThe applicant, therefore,\nprays that thepetitioner may be ordered to\nplace on recordthe renderings of the so-\ncalled tape-records.\"\n\nOn November 3, 1961 the Court passed an order\nin which it recorded :\n\n\"As regards the renderings of the tape-\n\nrecords, on which the petitioner relies,\nlearned Counsel for the petitioner\nundertakes to play the tape-recorder before\nthe respondent within a fortnight from the\ndate of the putting in of the above renderings\non a date suitable to both the sides.\"\n\nAgain on December 14, 1961 the State made an application to\nthe Court to modify the order dated November 3, 1961 by\ndirecting the appellant to play the tape-records in the\noffice of the Counsel for the State and allow the State to\nre-tape-record the tape-recordings produced by the ap-\npellant, so that a correct copy of the tape-records was\navailable to the respondent-State before filing the written\nstatement. In the applications made by the respondent to\nthe Court for directions regarding the inspection of the\ntape-records produced by the appellant, and seeking the\nfacility for re-recording, it was explicitly stated that\nthis was for the purpose of the State satisfying itself\nwhether the voices of the persons whose talks were purported\nto\nhave been tape-recorded were truly the voices of those per-\nsons. The Court passed an order on January 5, 1962\ndirecting the appellant to file the original tape-records\ninto Court to be sealed in the presence of both the parties\nand kept in custody of the Registrar of the Court, but this\nwas to be after the records were played before the res-\npondent on January 11, 1962 in the office of the Registrar\nof the Court.' This order was given effect to and the State\nhad the re-recorded copies in their possession to verify the\nauthenticity and correctness of the originals. The written\nstatement of the State was filed in February 1962 only after\nthey had thus their own copies of the -records, so that they\nwere in a position to verify (a) tape whether the voice\nrecorded was that of the person whose voice it professed to\nbe ; (b) whether there had been any interpolations or\nomissions ; and (c) whether there had been any other\ntampering with the records. In the counter-affidavit filed\nby the State there was no denial of the genuineness of the\ntape-records, no assertion that the voices of the persons\nwhich were recorded in the tape-records were not those which\nthey purport to be or that any portion of the conversation\nwhich would have given a different colour to it had been cut\noff. We should however add that there was a vague statement\nregarding the taperecord of the talk between the Vigilance\nInspector and the appellant with which we shall deal later.\nIt is in the light of these circumstances and this history\nof the proceedings that the evidence afforded by the tape-\nrecorded talk has to be considered in appreciating the\ngenuineness of the talks recorded and in deciding whether\nthe allegations made by the appellant are substantiated or\nnot.\n\nWe shall now take up the allegations in the order in which\nthey appear in the petition and in which we have set them\nout earlier. The first relates to the incident connected\nwith the operation on the Chief Minister's son Surinder\nSingh. Now, in regard to this, Surinder has filed an\naffidavit in which he has denied that there was any\noperation performed on him either by the appellant or by any\nother. There is no documentary evidence that the appellant\nperformed the operation which he claims to have performed in\nthe shape of hospital records. The appellant's explanation\nfor the absence of any such\nrecord was that the operation was necessitated by the nature\nof the disease which Surinder had contracted and for this\nreason the Chief Minister desired the operation to be\nperformed in secret. Accordingly the operation was per-\nformed not at Jullundur which is a big city where the Chief\nMinister and his family were well-known but in a rural\ndispensary about 50 miles away from his headquarters town.\nThe main points that were urged by the learned Attorney\nGeneral against the appellant's story was : (1) that\nSurinder has denied it, (2) that no evidence based on any\nhospital record had been produced to substantiate the story,\n(3) that the exact date on which the operation was performed\nwas not given, and (4) that the tape-recorded talk would not\nsubstantiate the appellant's case that he performed an\noperation. It would be convenient to take the tape-recorded\ntalks first because it is on them that the appellant relies\nfor corroborating his statement that he did perform an\noperation on Surinder at the end of April 1960. There are\nthree tape-recorded talks which bear on this incident and\nthese are numbered 6, 2 and 11. Talk no. 2 is the most\nimportant of them and is a tape-recorded talk on the trunk-\ntelephone between Mrs. Kairon (the Chief Minister's wife)\nand the appellant. In the course of the talk the record\nshows the lady to have asked :\n\n\"Mrs. Kairon : How is the young lad ?\n\nAns. : Your young lad is alright.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Have you removed off the\ndressing ?\n\nAns. : The dressing has come off. There is\nno dressing\nover the wound now.\n\nMrs. Kairon And; there is no discharge etc.\nAns. : There is no discharge now.\n\nMrs. Kairon Is the wound not raw ?\n\nAns. : No.\nMrs. Kairon Can he walk about now ?\n\nAns. : Slightly....................\nMrs. Kairon : There is no other ulcer inside.\nAns. : No, he is quite alright now.\n\nMrs. Kairon : The thing is that there can\ndevelop induration of the wound.\nAns. : Is it?\n\nMrs. Kairon : There is no other ulcer inside.\nAs you said ?\n\nAns. : No. He is quite alright now.\"\n\nFrom the internal evidence furnished by this tape-record\nitself it is seen that this talk was on May 1, 1960. Talk\nno. 6 is said to be slightly earlier in date, being towards\nthe end of April 1960. That too is stated to be after the\noperation and is a tape-recorded talk on a trunk-telephone\nbetween Mrs. Kairon and the appellant. This talk was\nnecessitated, according to the appellant, by the fact that\nSurinder had left the Circuit house at Jullundur, where he\nhad been directed to stay during convalesence, even before\nhe was completely healed and it was the negligence of the\ndoctor in permitting this to happen that is said to have\nbeen one of the causes of the appellant incurring the\ndispleasure of the Chief Minister. There are portions of\nthis record which are also relied on to corroborate the\nappellant that he perfomed an operation on Surinder and to\nestablish that the denial by Surinder is false :\n\n\"Mrs. Kairon : Dr. Sahib, did you test his\n(Surinder's)\nurine.?\n\nAns. : Urine is quite alright.\n\nMrs. Kairon : When was it tested ?\n\nAns. : It was done that day.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Dr. Sahib, it is 8 days now.\nAns. : We got it tested here when he came.\"\n\nThe appellant submitted that the words \"that day\" which we\nhave emphasized were a reference to the day on which the\noperation was performed. In the course of this talk (No. 6)\nMrs. Kairon made inquiries as to whether her son Surinder\nwas with the appellant and this inquiry was made because she\nhad information from other sources that he had left\nJullundur. When the appellant was asked about this he said\nin the tape-recorded talk :\n\n\"You see, he has tried to be clever with me.\nMrs. Kairon : What ?\n\nAns. : This Surinder.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Oh, you know what Sardar Sahib\nsaid.\n\nHe said he did not expect this thing from you.\nDr. P. Singh : From me ? Mrs. Kairon : Yes.\nDr. P. Singh : Why.\n\nMrs. Kairon: That he should go away from\nyou.\n\nDr. P. Singh: No, not from me. From\nCircuit House.\nMrs. Kairon: He got a trunk call booked\nand he got\n\nengaged in conversation elsewhere and I have\nfound out things from you.\n\nDr. P. Singh Look what could I do.\n\nMrs. Kairon He said why did you do it if you\ndid not have the strength to keep him.\n\nDr. P. Singh He told me he will stay on for 3\nor 4 days.\n\nMrs. Kairon Sardar Sahib said he did not see\nmuch sense in either of you.\"\n\nThe last of the tape-recorded renderings is that numbered 11\nand it purports to record a trunk-call talk between Surinder\nhimself and the appellant. Portions of it are relied on by\nthe appellant on both the points (a) that he performed an\noperation on Surinder, and (b) that Surinder left his care\nwithout his knowledge and thus made him incur the\ndispleasure of his parents :\n\n\"Surinder : Well Dr. Sahib. You better\ndictate to me the prescription of that triple\ndye. I want to apply it.\n\nAns. : When you come in the evening. You can\ntake it at that time.\n\nSurinder : No. I want to apply now, in the\nmorning. Ans. : Then, you should have, taken\nit yesterday and then\nleft..........................................\nSurinder : Alright, it was a mistake. Now you\ntell me. Dr. P. Singh : Otherwise it is\nalright now ?\n\nSurinder : A little bit of stuff came out of\nit, sort of blood.\n\nDr. P. Singh : It would be just a nominal sort\nof affair? Surinder : Yes please.\"\n\nThe above is in so far as regards the operation and next as\nto Surinder leaving the appellant's care we were referred to\nthe following in the recorded talk :\n\n\"Dr. P. Singh : You went away, all on the\nquiet.Surinder : I had to come here.\nDr. P. Singh : Why ? With me your\nunderstanding was that you will go only after\nshowing me in the evening.\n\nSurinder : I will come to you in the evening.\nDr. P. Singh : No, you will come today, but\nyesterady you went away without notice. We\ncame to know of it only when the servant came\nand reported that the room is all vacant, and\nthat Sardar Sahib has gone, giving a go by.\"\n\nThe question is whether this last (No. 11) tape-recorded\ntalk does or does not establish that the appellant's story\nabout his having operated on Surinder was true. In the\nfirst place, Surinder, through the affidavit that he made,\ndenies that any operation was performed on him by the\nappellant or by anyone else, does not deny that the voice\nrecorded in talk no. 11 is his. Besides, Surinder while\nstating in his affidavit that he was diabetic, admitted that\nhis urine had been examined by the appellant--a matter\nreferred to in talk no. 6 between Mrs. Kairon and the\nappellant. Of course he did not say in his affidavit that\nthe examination of his urine referred to in this talk, was\nthat referred to by him in his affidavit but that is not\nvery material. Nor has he offered any explanation for his\nstatement in talk no. 11 of \"a little bit of the stuff com-\ning out\". His version, however, as regards the recorded\ntalks was :\n\n\"I heard the tape-records prepared from the\ntaperecords recorded by the petitioner. The\nrenderings are not intelligible and clear and\nare denied.\"\n\nIf it was not intelligible, (we need hardly add that we do\nnot agree in this characterisation) how they could be denied\nis not clear, nor is one able to appreciate as to why the\ntalk should be unintelligible to him if they recorded what\nhe spoke. That is so far as rendering no. 11 is concerned.\nBut in regard to renderings 2 and 6 which purport to be a\nrecord of the talks between the appellant and Mrs. Kairon\nthere is no affidavit from Mrs. Kairon denying the\nauthenticity of her voice or of the talk, as recorded. No\ndoubt, Surinder in his affidavit denies that there was any\ntalk between the appellant and his mother regarding supply\nof medicines and he also states that the tape-records\nreferred to by the petitioner are all forged,\nhut in the context the forgery attributed could only relate\nto that portion in which Mrs. Kairon is recorded to have\nasked for medicines. If the state could get Surinder to\nfile an affidavit in regard to the tape-recorded talk, we do\nnot appreciate why no affidavit from Mrs. Kairon was filed\nto give her version as to whether she really talked with the\nappellant as recorded, and if she did so in what respects\nthe record was wrong. In the absence of any such affidavit\nor statement by her on oath that the voice recorded in the\nseveral talks and in particular in talks 2 and 6 was not\nhers or that the record had been manipulated, we cannot but\nhold that the records are genuine and that conversations\ntook place as recorded.\n\nThe next question is whether these show that the appellant\nperformed the operation. We believe we have extracted\nsufficient from these talks to show that they do indicate\nunmistakably that Surinder had undergone an operation\nsometime before the beginning of May 1960. The statement of\nSurinder, therefore, that he under-went no operation by\nanyone must obviously be discarded as untrue and no value\ncan be attached to the denial contained in the affidavit\nthat he has filed. If really he had undergone an operation\nand questions regarding the condition of his wound, the\noccurrence of discharge etc. are the subject of talks\nbetween Mrs. Kairon and the appellant in talks 2 and 6 and\nbetween Surinder himself and the appellant in talk 11, it\nstands to reason, in the absence of any rational or\nreasonable explanation by Mrs. Kiaron, that the appellant\nwas the person who had performed that operation.\nThe question that next falls to be considered is whether the\noperation was entrusted to the appellant by the Chief\nMinister or not. Apart from the probabilities of the case,\nthe extracts we have made from the tape-recorded talks no. 2\n& 6 and the reference to Sardar Saheb would indicate that\nthe Chief Minister was concerned in entrusting the operation\nto the appellant and the inference is more readily drawn\nbecause in the face of the allegations in the affidavit and\nthe tape-recorded talk between the appellant neither Mrs.\nKairon, nor the Chief Minister has placed her or his version\nof the matter before the Court by making any statement on\noath. In the circumstances we have no\nhesitation in holding that it was at the instance of the\nChief Minister that the appellant undertook the operation on\nthe chief Minister's son.\n\nIt was next said that even assuming the above conclusion\nwere justified, the statement in the tape-recorded talk\nwhich indicated the Chief Minister's displeasure at the\nconduct Of the appellant in permitting his son to leave\nJullundur before he was completely cured, was inadmissable\nin evidence for proving what the Chief Minister said to his\nwife and on that account we should hold that hostility on\nthe part of the Chief Minister owing to this incident was\nnot established. It is true that the statement of Mrs.\nKairon as to what the Chief Minister told her would be\nmerely hearsay and would not be admissible in evidence as a\nstatement of the Chief Minister but the tape-recorded talk\ndoes show that she herself was greatly displeased with the\nappellant and it was really to emphasise the displeasure of\nthe family and its head that the Chief Minister's name was\nbrought in. In the circumstances we do not consider that the\nrespondents derive any advantage from this technical\nobjection to the reception of the Chief Minister's statement\nsecondhand. The leaned Attorney-General also submitted that\nthe exact date of the operation was not given nor was the\nplace where it was performed set out in the affidavits and\nthat these detracted from the value of the allegations but\nwe do not consider that in the face of the recorded talks\nand the inference deducible therefrom that an operation was\nperformed by the appellant sometimes towards the end of\nApril 1960 very much turn on these factors. In making this\nstatement regarding the date we have in mind the reference\nin talk no. 2 to \"tomorrow\" as being the 2nd of May.\nThe next allegation relates to the requests made by the\nChief Minister himself and the members of his family for\nundue favours to be shown to certain patients who were\nrecommended for medical certificates or for special\ntreatment by the appellant at the hospital. This allegation\nwas denied by the State, but as stated earlier, the denial\nhas little force because the only persons who were in a\nposition to contradict the appellant have not come forward\nto state anything on oath. The allegation has, therefore,,\nto be considered with reference to the documentary evidence\non which reliance\nwas placed. They are Exs. B-1 to B-19 which are recommen-\ndations by either the Chief Minister, his sons, his brother\nor his sister introducing certain patients to the appellant\nand suggesting that they be attended to properly or their\nrequests granted. That anything improper was required to be\ndone by the appellant or anything contrary to the rules was\nexpected to be done by him or was suggested is not borne out\nby these documents. It is the appellant's submission that\nof these only two were not complied with-the request\ncontained in B-2 and B-5 but even as regards this there is\nno such specific assertion on the record, nor is it easy to\nsee why the appellant refused to comply with these requests.\nIn the circumstances we are unable to hold that this item of\nmisunderstanding is made out. But we must add that as these\nslips or chits were addressed to the appellant, some by the\nChief Minister, others by one or other of his two sons,\nstill others by his brother and one by Ms sister, they do\nestablish that at the dates which they bear the appellant\nwas a great friend of the Chief Minister and enjoyed the\nconfidence of the Chief Minister and the member's of family.\nThe next item may be considered separately under two heads;\n(1) Supply of medicines to the family of the Chief Minister\nat the request of Mrs. Kairon and others, and (2) the supply\nof two Singer Sewing machines to Mrs. Kairon. Needless to\nsay that these allegations have, no doubt, been denied by\nthe State, but there is no denial by the only persons who\ncould effectively contradict the appellant. As regards the\nsupply of medicines, the appellant's case is that they were\nsent by post by registered packets or parcels and in\ncorroboration of his statement he has produced six postal\nreceipts of registered packets or parcels despatched to\nSardarni Partap Singh Kairon. These bear dates from 1957 to\n1959 and they indicate that between Re. 1/- to Rs. 2/- was\npaid as postal charges for their transmission. Surely,\nsomething must have been sent in these packets or parcels\nand received by Mrs. Kairon but there is, on the side of the\nrespondent, no positive statement as to what these packets\ncontained. It therefore, appears to us that it is not\npossible to discard the appellant's statement that these\npackets contained medicines despatched to the Chief\nMinister's wife, for the use of the members of the family.\nIt matters\nlittle, for the purpose of this case, whether the medicines\nwere purchased at the cost of the appellant, as he says, or\nwere taken from the hospital. But whichever happened, it is\nclear that articles of some value were despatched from time\nto time over this three-year period by the appellant to Mrs.\nKairon. The tape-recorded talks do lend support to the\nappellant's story that he was required to send medicines and\nthat he complied with such demands. In talk no. 3 which was\nwith Mrs. Kairon and is stated to have been in August, 1959\n:\n\n\"Appellant : I shall get the medicines\ndelivered to you today.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Those tablets too and the\nmixture too.\n\nAppellant : What are those tablets ?\n\nMrs. Kairon : in those bottles were brown\nbrown tablets\nAppellant: I shall send them\n\nstraightaway ........................\nAppellant : I shall send you the injections\nalso. Mrs. Kairon : Alright.\"\n\nThen we have talk no. 1 which purports to be a record of\nconversion over the trunk-telephone between Mrs. Kairon and\nthe appellant and which is said to be in March 1960, but for\nour present purpose the date is not very material. We would\nextract the following from this talk\n\"Mrs. Kairon : The medicines have been\nreceived. Appellant : leave the question of\narrival of medicines ........................\n\nMrs. Kalron You sent injections.\n\nAppellant : I had sent you those injections.\nMrs. Kairon Yes they were 4 injections.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Those tablets have not been\nreceived. Appellant : Which tablets.\nMrs. Kairon : Those capsules.\n\nAppellant : Those brown.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Yes.\n\nAppellant : You had not asked for those.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Well. Does not matter.\n\nAppellant : I will do it now.\"\n\nLastly, we have talk no. 2 which appellant had\nwith Mrs. Kairon and is stated to have been\nin May 1960 in which the following passages\noccur :\n\n\"Appellant : The medicines that you had asked\nfor have arrived. When you come you take it.\nMrs. Kairon : You give it to Raghbir Singh\n(General Manager, Roadways).\n\nAppellant : You know those injections of B\nComplex that, you had asked for.\n\nMrs. Kairon : Yes.\n\nAppellant : You had asked for the B Complex\ninjections. Isn't it ?\n\nMrs. Kairon : Yes.\n\nAppellant : I have got those here.\"\n\nIn the face of the support afforded by the documentary evi-\ndence and the tape-recorded talks, coupled with the absence\nof any denial or explantion of these matters by the persons\nwho alone could deny them, we feel unable to attach any\nvalue to the affidavit of Surinder denying that any\nmedicine's were called for or supplied.\n\nThe appellant says that when demands of this type increased\nhe refused further to comply with them, but there is no\npositive evidence of any demand which he refused to comply\nwith andthus incur the anger or displeasure of the Chief\nMinister. But notwithstanding the absence of that type\nof evidenceit is clear that until 1959, at least, as is\nshown by thesepostal receipts and even till April-May\n196--as disclosed by the tape-recorded talks, the appellant\nwas on the friendliest terms with the Chief Minister and\nsome explanation has to be forthcoming as to why there was a\nsudden change of attitude from May 1960 or there abouts and\nmore particularly after January 1961. It is in the light of\nthis circumstance that the evidence afforded by the tape-\nrecorded talks regarding the operation on Surinder Kairon\nand of the article in the Blitz to which reference has\nalready been made assume crucial importance.\nThe second head of this item relates to the supply of the\nsewing machines. We consider that this portion of the\nappellant's case has been established beyond reasonable\ndoubt by Exs. C-7 to C-10 which have all been referred to\nby Dayal, J. in his judgment and we entirely concur with him\nin holding that this allegation has been completely proved.\nThe learned judges of the High Court discarded the\nappellant's case because of the affidavit of Mrs. Sodhi but\nwe agree with Dayal, J. that this would not explain either\nC-8 or C-10 which proved that a wooden case with the words\n'Singer Sewing Machine' stencilled or on a label at the top\nwas sent through the manager of the Punjab Roadways to Mrs.\nKairon. The statements contained in the affidavits filed by\nSri Pahwa, the Roadways manager as well as by Om Prakash,\nClerk of the Punjab Roadways are most artificial and apart\nfrom the discrepancies as regards the measurements and\nweight of the wooden box which was transported by them, and\nthe improbability of their having noted or remembered the\ndetails without any written record then made, they failed to\noffer any explanation for the label or stencilling at the\ntop referred to in Ex. C-9. Besides, the taperecorded\nconversation no. 3 between Mrs. Kairon and the appellant in\nwhich there is a reference to the colour of the machine that\nwas sent, makes it clear that the appellant's story of his\nhaving sent a machine to Mrs. Kairon is true. It is\nsomewhat surprising that though Ex. C-7 to C-10 were\nannexures to the writ petition and the respondents had\ncopies of the tape-recorded talks with them before they\nfiled their statements, they contented themselves with\nfiling these affidavits of Sri Pahwa and Om Prakash and Mrs.\nSodhi and abstained from letting the court know what Mrs.\nKairon had to say on the matter. This Sewing Machine\nincident was in July 1959 and it shows that up to that date\nthere was com-\nplete friendliness between the Chief Minister and the ap-\npellant. The appellant's further allegation that Mrs. Kai-\nron or the other members of the Chief Minister's family\ndemanded of him the supply of other costly articles and that\nhis refusal to comply with them angered the Chief Minister,\nmust be discarded as an embellishment for which there is no\nsupport in the evidence placed before the court.\nThe next item of the source of hostility alleged by the\nappellant is that be sent out of his house Kirpa Singh, the\nmanager of an automobile concern of the Chief Minister's\nson-Surinder-in or about March-April 1960 after having\npermitted him to stay there for about 7 months. Surinder\nhas filed an affidavit in which he has denied his ownership\nof the automobile concern and also that Kirpa Singh was\nprovided with board and lodging by the appellant at the\ninstance of his father. Kirpa Singh also made an affidavit\nto the same effect. Two matters however, stand out\nprominently. The first is that it cannot be doubted that\nKirpa Singh is a great friend both of the Chief Minister and\nhis son. Tape-record no. 15 which purports to record the\ntalk between Kirpa Singh and the appellant brings this out.\nIt was sought to discount the evidentiary value of this talk\nby the circumstance that the appellant had brought about\nthis talk designedly in order to tape-record the con-\nversation. We do not, however, agree that it has any such\neffect. The reality of that talk and the correctness of the\ntape-recording is not denied by Kirpa Singh in the affidavit\nbe filed and if he really spoke the words which that record\nshows he did the facts above stated are made out. That\nKirpa Singh was the manager of an automobile concern in\njullunder is not in dispute but both Surinder as well as\nKirpa Singh, in their affidavits, have studiously refrained\nfrom stating who the owner of that concern was beyond\nstating that Surinder is not the owner. We consider this\naverment most disingenuous and least frank. That Kirpa\nSingh was afforded board and lodging at the appellant's\nhouse is also admitted. It was not suggested that Kirpa\nSingh was a friend of the appellant otherwise than as a\nfriendof the Chief Minister and his son. and this tape-\nrecord 15 makes clear. It does not, therefore, stand to\nreason that the appellant would have undertaken the cost and\nincovenience of providing Kirpa Singh with board and\n49-2 S. C. India/64\nlodging except to oblige the Chief Minister and his son (2)\nIt is also a fact that Kirpa Singh moved out of the\nappellant's place at the end of March 1960 having stayed\nthere from September 1959 (vide Ex. D-1). The question\nimmediately arises whether this was because of the\ndisinclination on the part of the appellant to continue to\nretain him in his house. Having regard to the other cir-\ncumtances which have already been mentioned, of the\nundercurrent of hostility borne by the Chief Minister which\nstarted roundabout this time, we are inclined to accept as\ntrue the appellant's version that he sent Kirpa Singh out of\nhis house in preference to the story of Kirpa Singh that he\nwent out of his own accord. If the Chief Minister was\nobliged by the appellant providing board and lodging to\nKirpa Singh, it would not be a violent inference to draw\nthat the Chief Minister was angry with the appellant for\nhaving sent Kirpa Singh out.\n\nSome of the other matters set out as those which led to the\nhostility of the Chief Minister are also made out, such as\nfor instance that the appellant's services were utilised by\nthe Chief Minister in connection with the Karnal murder case\n(vide talk no. 7 with the Chief Minister himself) but as we\nconsider them to be of minor significance, we do not propose\nto deal with them in any detail, particularly as it would be\nsufficient to proceed on the basis of the items earlier\ndiscussed.\n\nNext we have the fact that notwithstanding that on the 29th\nof October 1960 there was some complaint received by the\ndepartment regarding his having improperly taken Rs. 16 from\na patient in July 1960, he was granted leave preparatory to\nretirement as and from December 18, 1960. In other words,\nthe Government had no idea at that date that charges should\nbe formulated against the appellant and that his retirement\nshould be postponed for completing such an inquiry. We have\nthen the circumstance that in all the earlier Confidential\nReports relating to the appellant there was nothing wrong\nfound with him and his conduct and character were not the\nsubject of any adverse comment. It was only subsequently,\nlong after the close of the year 1960, that an adverse\nremark was made against the appellant in respect of the year\n1-4-59 to 31-3-60 and this was communicated to him only late\nin February 1961. The appellant\ncomplains that this was really an after-thought and was\nbrought in long after that year was over in order to afford\nsome justification for the charges that were eventually made\nagainst him. What we have stated earlier regarding the\nunfriendly feelings which developed with the Chief Minister\nfrom about April-May, 1960 onwards seems to lend some\nsupport to this suggestion.\n\nWe have next the circumstance connected with the article in\nBlitz which appeared in its issue dated January 15, 1961.\nThat seems to be the starting point of the action taken\nagainst the appellant, for on January 13, 1961 the Vigilance\nOfficer sent a communication to the appellant to offer his\nexplanation in regard to certain charges which were then the\nsubject of inquiry. In the order dated the 3rd June, 1961\nby which the appellant was placed under suspension there is\nreference to three inquiries-one dated October 29, 1960,\nanother of January 11, 1961 and the third dated April 17,\n1961. The dates apparently are a reference to the dates of\nthe several complaints. The order refers to investigations\nmade by the Vigilance Department into certain complaints\nagainst the appellant but though the bona fides of these in-\nquiries as well as the bona fides of the action taken under\nthe impugned order were questioned the report of the Vigi-\nlance Inspector was not placed before the Court to enable it\nto judge what exactly the complaints were and whether they\nwere the same as the charges listed in the charge-sheet\nagainst the appellant. The above has to be judged in the\ncontext of the feature that there is a tape-recorded\nconversation which the appellant had with the Vigilance\nInspector (tape-record no. 16) in the course of which the\nInspector appears to suggest that he himself did not believe\nin the reality of the complaints. In the counter affidavit\nfiled by the State it was stated that the Vigilance\nInspector \"who has been made to hear a copy of the tape-\nrecords in question has reported that the tape-records are\nunintelligible and as such it is not possible to compare the\nrenderings with it. He has therefore reported that the\ntalk, as disclosed in the rendering took place between him\nand the petitioner but that the rendering appeared to have\nbeen twisted by the petitioner according to his own liking\".\nThe Vigilance Inspector himself made no affidavit nor was\nthere any denial even by the State that the voice recorded\nas that of the Vigilance\nInspector was really his. The tape-recorded talks have been\ntranslated-the originals having been heard by the State\nofficials as well as by the Inspector and we do not see any\nJustification for the complaint that they were\nunintelligible. There is, therefore, no reason why it was\nnot possible to say (a) that there was no talk, (b) if there\nwas, what exactly was its purport, and (c) where and in what\nrespects the tape-recording departed from the truth either\nby way of addition or omission. The talk, as recorded, as\nalready stated would appear to suggest that the Vigilance\nInspector did not believe in the truth of the complaint.\nThat, however, might not be very relevant for deciding\nwhether the complaint was true or false but in the face of\nthat recorded conversation is was certainly necessary for\nthe State to produce the Inspector's report for countering\nthe case of the appellant that the charges were invented for\nthe purpose of enabling the State to harass and humiliate\nhim.\n\nLastly, it is rather curious that some of the charges which\nare to be the subject of enquiry relate to a period long\nanterior to June 1961. For instance, charge 2(b) is\nconcerned with an illegal demand and receipt of sum of Rs.\n100/from a patient who came to the hospital on March 13,\n1957. Similarly, there are others which had been made ear-\nlier but had been dropped or their falsity had been admitted\non earlier occasions but were stated to have been revived\nfor the purpose of Justifying this inquiry. In the view we\nentertain that the action against the appellant was taken\nbecause of the matters we have held proved and because of\nthe charges made against the Chief Minister in the article\nin the Blitz it is not necessary to discuss minutely as to\nwhether the charges could be true or were merely invented.\nThe facts establish that up to March-April 1960 the ap-\npellant was on the best terms with the Chief Minister and\nthe members of his family. He was going out of his way to\noblige the Chief Minister and do his bidding, though as an\nofficer of the position and status of the appellant this was\nhardly conduct which should properly be expected of him.\nPossibly , his being kept at Jullunder without transfer for\nfour years was because of this failing on his part. From\nApril 1960 onwards we find that there is a change in the\nattitude of the Chief Minister. The operation on Surinder\nand the incidents connected with it and the sending out of\nKirpa\nSingh relate to this period. This apparently led to the\norder for his transfer from Jullunder to Amritsar. Having\nfallen from grace, the appellant did not apparently consider\nit safe to continue in service and hence applied for leave\npreparatory to retirement and this was granted. Immediately\nhe got to know that he had obtained this leave he was\napparently emboldened to make public the improper acts which\nhe himself had done for pleasing the Chief Minister and\ncurry his favour and the article in the Blitz was obviously\ninspired by him. When this came to the notice of the Chief\nMinister in the middle of January 1961 stern action\nfollowed-first the Vigilance Inspector's communication of\nthe 13th January followed by the adverse report against the\n\n-appellant for 1960 in February 1961 and the further charges\nagainst him in April 1961 which led to the passing of the\nimpugned orders. In the circumstances we are satisfied that\nthe dominant motive which induced the Government to take\naction against the appellant was not to take disciplinary\nproceedings against him for misconduct which it bona fide\nbelieved he had committed, but to wreak vengeance on him for\nincurring his wrath and for the discredit that he had\nbrought on the Chief Minister by the allegations that he had\nmade in the article which appeared in the Blitz in its issue\ndated January 15, 1961 followed by the communication to the\nsame newspapers by the appellant's wife, in which these\nallegations were affirmed and in large part we have found to\nbe true. We therefore hold that the impunged orders were\nvitiated by mala fides, in that they were motivated by an\nimproper purpose which was outside that for which the power\nor discretion was conferred on Government and the said\norders should therefore be set aside.\n\nWe therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order dated\nJune 3, 1961 revoking the leave granted and placing the\nappellant under suspension and the order dated June 29, 1961\ndirecting an inquiry into the charges against him.\nAs the appellant has failed to make out the other point\nabout the orders being contrary to the Service Rules we di-\nrect that there shall be no order as to costs, here and in\nthe High Court.\n\nRAGHUBAR DAYAL J.-This appeal, on a certificate granted by\nthe High Court of Punjab, is directed against\nits order dismissing the appellant's petition under\nArt. 226\n\nof the Constitution praying for quashing, by a writ of cer-\ntiorari or other suitable directions, the orders of the\nPunjab Government (1) suspending him; (ii) revoking his\nleave; (iii) compelling him to continue in service after he\nhad attained the age of superannuation, and (iv) ordering a\ndepartmental enquiry against him.\n\nThe appellant, Sardar Partap Singh, Joined the Punjab Civil\nMedical Service, Class 1, in 1947. He joined the service as\na direct recruit on August 21, 1947. His previous service\nin the Indian Medical Service from 1934 to 1939, in the\nPunjab Civil Medical Service from April 1940 to June 1941\nand in the Indian Military Service in temporary rank till\nabout the end of 1945, has no bearing on the terms of his\nservice as a member of the Punjab Civil Medical Service,\nClass 1.\n\nThe appellant reached the Selection Grade of the Civil\nMedical Service, Class I, in January 1955 and was trans-\nferred to Jullunder as Civil Surgeon in April 1956. He\nremained there till he proceeded on leave preparatory to\nretirement sometime in December 1960. His leave was san-\nctioned on December 18, 1960, and was notified in the Punjab\nGazette dated January 27, 1961.\n\nOn June 3, 1961, the Governor of Punjab ordered the\nsuspension of the appellant with immediate effect as the\nGovernment had decided that a departmental enquiry be\ninstituted against him under r. 7 of the Punjab Civil Ser-\nvices (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952. The Governor\nfurther passed an order under r. 3.26(d) of the Punjab Civil\nServices Rules. These rules were issued under the proviso\nto\nArt. 309\nof the Constitution and came into force from\nApril 1, 1953. They have been referred to as the 1959 rules\nin the judgment of the High Court and at the hearing as they\nwere amended from time to time and were re-printed in 1959.\nWe shall also refer to them as the 1959 rules. The\nGovernor's order under r. 3.26(d) of these rules was that in\nview of the appellant's reaching the age of superannuation\non June 16, 1961 he be retained in service beyond that date\ntill the completion of the departmental enquiry.\nThe orders of the Governor were communicated to the\nDirector, Health Services, Punjab, by the Secretary to the\nGovernment in the Medical and Health Department by his\nletter Annexure J dated June 3, 1961. The Director, Health\nServices, communicated these orders to the appellant by a\nletter, Annexure 1, dated June 3, despatched under postal\ncertificate. He further sent a copy of that letter and its\nenclosures by registered post to the appellant on June 5,\n1961. The registered cover was further marked 'express\ndelivery'. Copies of this letter were sent to the then\nCivil Surgeon, Jullunder, and the Accountant General,\nPunjab, for information.\n\nOn June 10, 1961, notifications about the Governor's placing\nthe appellant under suspension and fixing his headquarters\nat Chandigarh and about his revoking, with effect from June\n3, the leave preparatory to retirement which had been\nsanctioned to him and retaining him in service until the\nenquiry into the charges against him be concluded and a I\nfinal order passed, were published in the Punjab Government\nGazette Extraordinary dated June 10, 1961. The Director,\nHealth Services, Punjab, forwarded to the appellant, with\nhis letter dated 3/11th of July 1961, a memorandum dated\nJune 29, 1961, statement of charges and statement of\nallegations which he had received from the Secretary to\nGovernment, Punjab, Vigilance Department, for the\nappellant's submitting' such explanation ,is he might\ndesire. This letter purported to be with reference to\nenquiries nos. 70, 3 and 27 dated October 29, 1960, January\n11, 1961 and April 17, 1961 respectively against the\nappellant.\n\nThe appellant challenged, by his writ petition, the legality\nof the orders of suspension, revocation of leave, retention\nin service after the date of superannuation and institution\nof the departmental enquiry, on various grounds. The\ncompetency of the Governor to make the orders was\nquestioned. It was alleged that unjustified personal grie-\nvances arose between the appellant and Sardar Partap Singh\nKairon, Chief Minister of Punjab, in or about 1960, that the\nimpugned orders were passed mala fide in the exercise of\npower, if any, vested in the respondent, the State of Punjab\nin the Ministry of Health, that this was an abuse of power\nand was intended to feed the grudge of the Chief Minister\nagainst him.\nThe respondent State refuted the contention that the\nimpugned orders were passed mala fide on account of the\nalleged grievances of the Chief Minister and stated that the\nGovernment was competent under rules governing the services\nof the appellant to pass the impugned orders and that the\nappellant's allegations had nothing to do with the orders\nsuspending him and revoking his leave preparatory to\nretirement.\n\nThe High Court agreed with the contention for the respondent\nand dismissed the appellant's petition. On the appellant's\napplication, it granted the necessary certificate under\nArt.\n133(1)(c)\nof the Constitution.\n\nThe appellant has questioned the correctness of the impugned\norders, broadly speaking, on two grounds. One is that the\nrules governing his service did not empower the Governor to\npass the impugned orders. The second is that the impugned\norders were passed mala fide as the Chief Minister, who was\nin charge of the department of Health, bore ill-will towards\nhim.\n\nThe first contention has been urged before us in various\nways and we deal with the more salient and important aspects\nurged to support the contention that the impugned orders\ncould not have been passed by the Governor in view of the\nvarious rules.\n\nIt is contended that leave, once sanctioned, cannot be\nrevoked after the officer has proceeded on leave. He can\nonly be recalled to duty. The appellant was not recalled to\nduty as he was not posted to any post of a civil surgeon.\nRule 8.15 of the 1959 rules reads :\n\n\"Leave cannot be claimed as of right. When\nthe exigencies of the public services so\nrequire, discretion to refuse or revoke leave\nof any description is reserved to the\nauthority empowered to grant it.\n\nIt follows therefore that the authority granting leave has\nthe discretion to revoke it. There is no restriction on the\npower of revocation with respect to the time when it is to\nbe exercised. It can be exercised before the officer to\nwhom leave was granted proceeds on leave. It can also be\nrevoked after he has proceeded on leave. Revocation of\nleave simply means cancelling the leave granted.\nThe exigency necessiating the revocation of leave may arise\nafter the officer has proceeded on leave. Rule 8.3 has no\nbearing on the question as it provides that the rules\nfollowing it govern the procedure for making applications\nfor leave and for granting leave in India. It deals with\nthe procedure and not with the right of the officer to leave\nor with the power of the necessary authority to sanction or\nrefuse leave or revoke leave. Rule 8.42 deals with matters\nincidental to the recall from leave and in no way affects\nthe discretion of the authority to revoke leave. In fact,\nrecall to duty must follow the revocation of the leave with\nrespect to the period not availed of till then.\nThe next contention is that when a Government servant\nproceeds on leave preparatory to retirement, he ceases to\nhold office and to be in the employment of Government and\nthat in fact he practically retires on the date he avails of\nthe leave and consequently no question of his suspension can\narise. This contention, again, has no force. A Government\nservant is in service till his service terminates and the\nservice can terminate only by dismissal, removal or\nretirement. The date from which a Government servant is on\nleave preparatory to retirement cannot be treated as the\ndate of his retirement from service.\n\nIt is also urged that a Government servant on leave\npreparatory to retirement cannot be suspended as suspension\nmeans a person's ceasing to work on the post he holds and\nthe public servant on such leave holds no office or post and\ntherefore he cannot be effectively suspended. Suspension of\na Government servant, during the course of his service,\nsimply means that no work is to be taken from him during the\nperiod of suspension. The Government servant does not work\non a post during the period of his suspension. If he is\nactually discharging the duty of a certain office prior to\nsuspension, the order of suspension would mean that he would\ncease to work on and discharge the duties of that post. If\nat that time he is not working on any post but is on leave,\nno question of Ms actually ceasing to work or giving up the\ndischarge of duty arises, but that does not mean that the\norder of suspension would be ineffective. The Government\nservant, during suspension or on leave, holds a lien on his\npermanent post in view of r. 3.13 unless his lien is\nsuspended or is transferred under the appropriate\nrule and so has a title to hold that post when under sus-\npension or on leave.\n\nWe may refer to the case reported as\nKhem Chand v. Union of\nIndia\n(1) wherein the rule that a Government servant be\ndeemed to be on suspension during the period between the\ndate of dismissal and the date of its being set aside, was\nheld valid. Suspension during such period is analogous to\nsuspension during the period of leave after\nrevocation of leave for that period.\n\nAnother contention is that the order revoking the leave must\nprecede the order of suspension, and as the order of\nsuspension was before the revocation of his leave it is bad.\nWe do not agree with this contention. Notifications about\nthe suspension and revocation of leave from June 3, 1961,\nwere issued on June 3, 1961. The order of suspension bears\nan earlier number than the order about the revocation of\nleave. The order in which the two orders were issued does\nnot affect in substance the validity of the two orders so\nlong as the Governor had the power to suspend the appellant\nand revoke his leave. Orders may be issued in any sequence.\nThe next contention is that these orders of June 3 were\nactually communicated to the appellant after the date of his\nretirement and is therefore ineffective. The appellant's\ndate of birth is June 16, 1906. The order of suspension\nreached the appellant, according to his statement, on June\n19, 1961, though it was despatched by the Director, Health\nServices, Punjab, on June 3, 1961. The envelope containing\nthe letter was addressed to the appellant by his Kanpur\naddress which he appeared to have furnished to the office.\nThe appellant was apparently not at Kanpur when the letter\nreached him and the letter took unduly long on being\nredircted to the address where it was delivered to the\nappellant. There is not sufficient material on the record\nto show when it was redirected and what caused this delay.\nThe Director, Health Services, not only addressed an\nordinary cover under postal certificate to the appellant but\nalso followed it up by a registered letter on June 5. The\nGovernment, not having received an acknowledgement of the\nappellant with respect to the receipt of the orders of\nsuspension etc., published the orders in the Punjab\n[1963] Supp. I S.C.R. 229.\nGovernment Gazette extraordinary dated June 10. Ordinarly,\nthe notification about these orders would have been\npublished in the Gazette in due course. They were published\nin the Gazette Extraordinary as the Government it appears\nfrom the written statement, had the impression that the\nappellant was avoiding the receipt of the letter addressed\nto him. There was a reason for their anxiety to see that\nthe orders could be made known to the appellant as he was\ndue to retire from June 16, 1961. The newspapers also,\naccording to the appellant's own petition, published in\ntheir issues of June 15 about the notification concerning\nthe respondent in the Gazette Extraordinary. The, orders of\nthe Government ordinarily take effect from the moment they\nare issued except when they cannot be effective due to their\nnature. An order of suspension of the appellant when he was\non leave could be effective from the moment it was issued.\nThe appellant was on leave and was not discharging any\nofficial functions. If he had been actually on duty, the\norder of suspension would have taken effect from the moment\nit reached him and from which moment alone the appellant\ncould have complied with that order by ceasing to work any\nfurther in the discharge of his duties. It is therefore\nimmaterial whether the publication of the orders in the\nGazette Extraordinary amounted to sufficient notice to the\nappellant of the various orders and whether the letters\ncommunicating to him the orders reached him after the due\ndate of retirement. In the present case the orders were\neffective from June 3, 1961, and their validity and effect\ndid not depend on the date of communication to the\nappellant.\n\nThe case reported as\nBachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab\n(l)\nis not apposite and does not support the contention. It was\nnot a case of suspension. In that case a Government servant\npreferred an appeal against his dismissal by the Revenue\nSecretary of Pepsu Government to the state Government of\nPepsu. The Revenue Minister recorded his opinion that\ninstead of dismissing him he be reverted to his original\npost. Thereafter, the State of Pepsu merged with the State\nof Punjab. The remarks of the Revenue Minister were not\ncommunicated to the appellant.\n\nAIR 1963 S.C. 395.\nsubsequent to the merger, the Chief Minister, Punjab, dis-\nmissed the appeal. This order was communicated to the\nappellant. The remarks of the Revenue Minister of Pepsu\nwere held not to be an order of the State Government and, in\nthe context of that case, it was said at p. 398:\n\n\"Before something amounts to an order of the\nState Government two things are necessary.\nThe order has to be expressed in the name of\nthe Governor as required by cl. (1) of\nArt.\nand then it has to be communicated.\"\n\nThe remarks of this Court in\nState of Punjab v. Sodhi\nSukhadev Singh\n(1) and quoted in this case, do not go -so far\nand lay down that a final decision by the Council of\nMinister becomes an order when the Rajpramukh acts upon it\nby issuing an order in that behalf to the respondent. The\nfurther following remarks should be construed in the same\ncontext:\n\n\"Thus it is of the essence that the order has\nto be communicatcd to the person who would be\naffected by that order before the State and\nthat person can be bound by that order. For,\nuntil the order is communicated to the person\naffected by it, it would be open to the\nCouncil of Ministers to consider the matter\nover and over again and therefore till its\ncommunication the order cannot be regarded as\nanything more than provisional in character.\"\n\nThese observations thercfore refer to an order made in the\ncircumstances of that case. It is to be noted that in both\nthese cases, no formal order was at all made by the Gov-\nernment. The impugned orders in the present case were\nformally issued by the Governor on June, 1961, and -were\neven published in the -Gazette extraordinary on June 10.\nThey were final orders. Of course, the Governor could, at\nany time, pass further orders superseding those orders. The\npossibility of a change in the order is not the main basis\nfor considering whether a certain order is effective or not.\nThe main contention of the appellant, however, is that r. 3.26(d\n)\nof the 1959 rules is not applicable to him and that if it be\napplicable, his case is not covered by the terms of that\nrule. The appellant joined the Punjab Civil Medical\nAIR 1961 S.C. 493, 512.\nService, Class 1, in 1947. At that time the Punjab Civil\nMedical Services, Class I (Recruitment and Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1940, hereinafter called the Medical Rules.\nwere in force. They were made by the Governor of Punjab in\nthe exercise of powers conferred on him by cl. (b) of sub-s.\n(1) and cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of\ns. 241\nof the Government of\nIndia Act, 1935. Rule 13 of the Medical rules\nis :\n\n\"In respect of leave, pension and other\ncognate matters not specifically mentioned in\nthese rules, members of Service shall be\ngoverned by such general rules as may be\nframed in that regard by the Governor of the\nPunjab, under cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of\ns. 241\n\nof the Government of India Act, 1935.\"\n\nThe Punjab Civil Services Rules were also made by the\nGovernor of Punjab under\ns. 241\nof the Government of India\nAct and came into force from April 1, 1941. They too were\nin force at the time the appellant joined service. Rule\n3.26 (d) did not find place in the 1940 rules. The 1959\nrules which, as already stated, really came into force in\n1953, have this rule. It reads :\n\n\"A Government servant under suspension on a\ncharge of misconduct shall not be required or\npermitted to retire on his reaching the date\nof compulsory retirement but should be\nretained in service until the enquiry into the\ncharge is concluded and a final order is\npassed thereon.\"\n\nThe contention for the appellant is that the rule with res-\npect to the retirement of a Government servant relates to a\nmatter cognate to pensions and that therefore, in view of r.\n13 of the Medical rules, matters of his retirement would be\ngoverned by the 1941 rules. We are of opinion that the\nquestion of retirement of a Government servant on super-\nannuation or otherwise is not a matter cognate to pensions.\nPension follows retirement and may be said to be incidental\nto it. Rule 13 of the Medical rules therefore does not\ngovern the terms of retirement of the appellant. It is r. 17\nof the Medical rules which would govern the matter of his\nretirement. This rule reads:\n\n\"In all matters not expressly provided for in\nthese rules, the members of the service shall\nbe governed by such general rules as may have\nbeen or may hereafter be\nframed by Government and by the provisions of the\nGovernment\nof India Act, 1935\n.\"\n\nIt is clear from this rule that in the matter of retirement\nthe appellant would be governed by such eneral rules as\nmight have been made by the Government at the time the\nMedical rules were made or as would be made by the Govrnment\nsubsequently. The latest general rules governing he\nretirement of Government servants will govern the retirement\nof the appellant even if it be assumed that the Medical\nrules still govern his conditions of service.\nRule 3.26(d) is therefore applicable to the appellant.\nThe further contention of the appellant is that this rule\napplies to a government servant under suspension on charge\nof misconduct and therefore to a Government servant against\nwhom a formal departmental enquiry has been instituted for\nenquiring into the charges of misconduct framed against him\nand that no such charge being framed and no such\ndepartmental enquiry being instituted prior to the order of\nsuspension of the appellant on June 3, 1961, the order of\nsuspension cannot be treated to be an order under r.\n3.26(d). We do not agree. There is no Justification to give\nsuch a restricted meaning to the word 'charge' in this rule.\nThe appellant refers to r. 7 of the punjab Civil Services\n(Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952, hereinafter called the\nPunishment and Appeal Rules,This rule reads:\n\n\"(1) Without prejudice to the revisions of the\n\nPublic Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850\n, no\norder of dismissal, removal or reduction,\nshall be passed against a person to whom these\nrules are applicable, unless he has been given\na reasonable opportunity of showing cause\nagainst the action proposed to be taken in\nregard to him.\n\n(2)The grounds on which it is proposed to\ntake such action, shall be reduced to the form\nof a definite charge or charges which shall be\ncommunicated in writing to the person charged\nand he shall be required within a reasonable\ntime to state in writing whether he admits the\ntruth of all, or any, of the charges, what\nexplanation or defence, if any, he has to\noffer and whether he desires to be heard in\nperson. If he so ,desires, or if the\nauthority empowered to dismiss,\nremove or reduce him so directs, an oral\nenquiry shall be held at which all evidence\nshall be heard as to such of the charges as\nare not admitted.\"\n\nThis rule comes into play only after a prima facie case is\nmade out against a Government servant and not at the state\nof a preliminary investigation into accusations made against\na Government servant. But it does not follow that\nsuspension is not permissible till this stage of making a\nformal charge arrives. Rule 3.26(d) is of general applica-\ntion and therefore the expression 'charge of misconduct' in\nthis rule is not to be interpreted narrowly as meaning 'the\ncharges formally framed and communicated to the government\nservant concerned' with the intimation that a formal\ndepartmental enquiry had been initiated against him on those\ncharges. The appellant's contention does not find any\nsupport, as urged, from the last portion of this rule which\nreads 'until the enquiry into the charge is concluded and a\nfinal order is passed thereon'. Of course, the enquiry\nwould be into the charges of misconduct on account of which\nthe Government servant has been suspended and the suspension\nwill continue till a final order is passed on those charges.\nThe requirements of the last portion of this rule do not in\nany way lead to the conclusion that the enquiry into the\ncharges refers to a formal departmental enquiry into the\ncharges framed and communicated to the Government servant in\naccordance with r. 7 of the Punishment and Appeal rules. We\nare of opinion that whenever any charge of misconduct is\nunder enquiry by the Government, be it informally or\nformally, the Government is competent to suspend the\nGovernment servant and if the requirements of the case\nrequire to take action under r. 3.26(d).\n\nIt was contended that the appellant's suspension without\ncalling him to explain the charges first, was bad as the\nproceedings to suspend him were of a quasijudicial character\nand therefore necessitated the Government's obtaining his\nexplanation to the charges of misconduct before passing the\norder of suspension. The order suspending the Government\nservant pending enquiry is partly an administrative order.\nWhat has been held to be quasijudicial is the enquiry\ninstituted against the Government servant on the charges of\nmisconduct, an enquiry during\nwhich under the rules it is necessary to have an explanation\nof the Government servant to the charges and to have oral\nevidence, if any, recorded in his presence and then to come\nto a finding. None of these steps is necessary before\nsuspending a Government servant pending enquiry. Such\norders of suspension can be passed if the authority\nconcerned, on getting a complaint of misconduct, considers\nthat the alleged charge does not appear to be groundless,\nthat it requires enquiry and that it is necessary to suspend\nthe Government servant pending enquiry.\n\nExplanation I to rule 2.2(b), Vol. II, 1959 rules, supports\nthe view that there can be suspension of a Government\nservant even prior to the issue of charges of misconduct to\nhim, the Explanation being,\n\"Departmental proceedings shall be deemed to\nhave been instituted when the charges framed\nagainst the pensioner are issued to him, or,\nif the officer has been placed under\nsuspension from an earlier date, on such\ndate\".\n\nBachhittar Singh\n's Case(1) is no authority for the con-\ntention that the initial order of suspension pending enquiry\nmust be made after obtaining the explanation of the Gov-\nernment servant concerned. That question did not at all\narise for consideration in this case.\n\nIn this connection we may also deal with another contention\nof the appellant that the 1941 or 1959 rules do not empower\nthe Government to suspend a government servant pending an\nenquiry. It is contended that the suspension contemplated\nby the rules is the suspension which comes under r. 7.5,\n1941 rules, or under rules 7.5 and 7.6 of the 1959 rules.\nThese rules do not invest the Government with the power of\nsuspension, but only provide either for certain periods\nduring a Government servant's service to be deemed to be\nperiods during which he was under suspension or during which\nhe be placed under suspension in view of the various\nexigencies mentioned in those rules. No such formal rule is\nto be found in any of these rules. The power of suspending\na Government servant is vested in the authority which\nappoints the Government servant in view of\ns. 16\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897.\n\nA.I.R. 1963 S.C. 395.\nThe other substantial contention for the appellant in\nconnection with the inapplicability of r. 3.26(d) to his\ncase is that, under the 1941 rules which governed his\nservice initially, he had a right to opt for retirement on\nsuperannuation and that therefore the 1959 rules could not\nadversely affect that right and empower the Governor to\nretain the appellant in service after the date of superan-\nnuation without the consent of the appellant.\nRule 1.6 of the 1959 rules provides that nothing in those\nrules shall operate to deprive any person of any right or\nprivilege to which he is entitled by or under any law or by\nthe terms of his agreement. Rule 5.28, Vol. II, 1941:\n\nrules reads:\n\n\"A Government servant in Superior service who has attained\nthe age of 55 years may, at his option, retire on a\nSuperannuation pension.\"\n\nThe contention of the appellant is that this rule gives him\nthe right to retire on superannuation pension on attaining\nthe age of 55 years and that therefore he cannot be retained\nin service after he had attained that age without his con-\nsent, that he cannot be deprived of this right by the 1959\nrules and that therefore r. 3.26(d) could not be applicable\nto him after he had attained the age of 55 years.\nThere is nothing Corresponding to r. 5.28 of Vol. 11 of 1941\nrules in Vol. 11 of the 1959 rules. It appears that r. 5.28\nof the latter volume was cancelled. When the retirement of\nthe appellant, as already held, is governed by the 1959\nrules and not by the 1941 rules, the right, if any, given by\nthe 1941 rules to the appellant to opt for retirement could\nnot be said to be a right which comes within r. 1.6 of the\n1959 rules as rule 1.6 preserves such rights to which the\nGovernment servant be entitled by or under any law or by the\nterms of his agreement. It contemplates such rights which\nthe law in force gives to the Government servant at the time\nthe 1959 rules are in force. When the 1941 rules do not\ngovern him now, it cannot be said that he has a right to opt\nfor retirement on attaining the age of 55.\n\nRule 5.28, aforesaid, is in Vol. 11 of the 1941 rules which\nembodies the rules relating to pensions and provident fund\nand therefore the proper interpretation of that rule would\nbe that it provides for and permits the grant\n50-2 S. C. India/64\nof superannuation to a government servant who has opted to\nretire after attaining the age of 55 years on being required\nby the Government, in the exercise of its powers under r.\n3.26 of Volume 1, to continue in service. This is clear\nfrom the sequence of rules in Volume II.\nSection 4\nof\nChapter V deals with superannuation pension. Its part I\ndeals with conditions of grant. This part has got three\nrules 5.27, 5.28 and 5.29. The other part deals with\nprocedure. Now, r. 5.27 provides that superannuation pen-\nsion is granted to a Government servant in superior service\nentitled or compelled to retire at a particular age. This\nrule refers to the Government servant to whom superannuation\npension is granted. Rule 5.28 follows this rule under the\nheading 'conditions of grant' and therefore is to be\ninterpreted to mean that superannuation pension can be\ngranted to a Government servant in superior service who is\nretired at his option after he has attained the age of 55\nyears.\n\nAssuming however that the appellant had a right to retire on\nattaining the age of 55 years in view of this rule or r.\n3.26(a), that right is subject to r. 3.26(d) in as far as\nthis rule provides that no Government servant would be\npermitted to retire on his reaching the date of compulsory\nretirement if he be under suspension on a charge of\nmisconduct.\n\nIt is also contended that r. 3.26(d) applies to those\nGovernment servants whose date of compulsory retirement,\ni.e., the date on reaching which they could be retired or\npermitted to retire, precedes the date of superannuation on\nwhich date they must retire. There is nothing in this rule\nor in note no. 3 to r. 3.26 which should make us construe\nthe expression 'date of compulsory retirement' to be the\ndate on reaching which they can be retired or permitted to\nretire prior to the actual date of superannuation. No such\nrule was really necessary for such cases as it was not\nincumbent on the State to require the officers reaching such\nan age to retire. Requiring them to retire at that age was\nan option with the Government. The expression 'date of\ncompulsory retirement' in r. 3.26(d) must really refer to\nthe dates mentioned in the earlier clauses of r. 3.26 and\nthey are those on which the Government servant attains the\nage of 55 years or any of the ages mentioned\nin clauses (b) and (c) of that rule. Clause (b) provides\nthat certain Government servants should be required to\nretire at the age of 60. Clause (c)(i) provides for the\nretirement of certain officers on reaching the age of 55\nyears and empowers the Government, however, to require them\nto retire on reaching the age of 50 years in certain\ncircumstances.\nThe expression 'required to retire would\ncertainly refer to these officers whose cases come within\nthe previous clauses of r. 3.26 and may also be applicable\nto Government servants who may be required to retire under\nany other rule in particular circumstances. The width of\nthe rule cannot clearly make the rule inapplicable to the\ncases covered by the earlier clauses of r. 3.26.\nThe expression 'permitted to retire', again, would refer to\ncases where the Government servant opts to retire in view of\ncertain rules providing for his exercising such an option.\nThe following observations at p. 579 of the case reported as\n\nThe State of Bombay v. Saubhagchand M. Doshl\n(1) do not\nsupport the contention of the appellant. They simply mean\nthat the question under consideration\nin that case\ncould\narise in those circumstances, the observation being.\n\n\"It should be added that questions of the\nabove character could arise only when the\nrules fix both an age of superannuation and an\nage for compulsory retirement and the services\nof a civil servant are terminated between\nthese two points of time.\"\n\nThe question raised\nin that case\nwas whether the order of\ncompulsory retirement amounted to an order of dismissal or\nremoval or not.\n\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appellant had no\nabsolute right to opt for retirement on his attaining the\nage of superannuation, that any such option was subject to\nr. 3.26(d) which applies to him and that his case comes\nunder that rule as he was on the date of his compulsory\nretirement under suspension on charges of misconduct.\nIt is true that no question of Government retaining a\nGovernment servant in service on Ms attaining the age of 55\nyears arises if the officer had once retired on attaining\nthat age. If the Government desires to have the advantage\n(1)[1958] C.R. 571.\nof his services after he had retired, the only course open\nto the Government is to reemploy him. No such situation\nhowever arises in the present case when the impugned orders\nsuspending the appellant, revoking his leave subsequent to\nthat date and retaining him in service after the date of\nsuperannuation in view of r. 3.26(d) had been made prior to\nthe date on which he was to attain the age of 55 years.\nIt has also been contended that r. 3.26(d) infringes the\nfundamental rights of the appellant as a citizen Of India\nunder\nArt. 19\nand\nof the Constitution. We do not agree.\nRule 3.26(d) simply provides that the service which the\nappellant took up voluntarily and on conditions as be\nlaid\ndown by\nthe relevant rules would continue in certain\ncircumstances even though the Government servant has\nattained the age of superannuation. Further, any res-\ntriction the rule imposes on any alleged fundamental right\nunder cls. (f) and (g) of\nArt. 19\nis a reasonable\nrestriction in the interests of the general public. The\nservices to be rendered by the Government servant subsequent\nto such an age, in view of r. 3.26(d), is in no sense a\nservice which can be equated with the expression 'begar' or\n'forced labour' in\nArt. 23.\nThe appellant is not forced to\ndo any work. He remains under suspension and does no work.\nEven if it be assumed that the retention in Service of the\nGovernment servant, in view of the provisions of r. 3.26(d),\ncan come within the expression 'forced labour' this rule\nwould be valid in view of\nArt. 23(2)\nwhich provides that\nnothing in that Article shall prevent the State from\nimposing compulsory service for public purposes. We are of\nopinion that such retention would be for a public purpose,\nas it is in the larger interests of the efficiency of the\nservices that a Government servant should remain within the\ncon-' trol of -the Government so long as the departmental\nenquiry against him on a charge of misconduct is not con-\ncluded and final orders are not passed.\n\nIt was also contended that some of the charges framed\nagainst the appellant, if true, would constitute criminal\noffences and that therefore criminal prosecution should have\nbeen launched against him in place of the departmental\nproceedings. There is nothing in the rules or the general\nlaw which would support this contention. It is for the\nGovernment to decide what action should be taken against the\nGovernment servant for certain misconduct. Such a\ndiscretion in the Government does not mean that the pro-\n,vision for the departmental enquiry on such charges of\nmisconduct is in violation of the provisions of\nArt. 14.\n\nThe service rules apply equally to all the members of the\nservice i.e., to all persons similarly placed and are not\ntherefore discriminatory. The Government has the discretion\nin every case, considering the nature of the alleged\nmisconduct and other circumstances, whether a criminal\nprosecution should be launched or not. The Government is\nalso free to conduct departmental proceedings after the\nclose of the criminal proceedings, if instituted.. There is\ntherefore nothing illegal in the Government instituting the\ndepartmental proceedings against the appellant.\nBefore dealing with the allegation about the impugned orders\nbeing made mala fide, we may deal with certain general\npoints raised by the appellant.\n\nA grievance has been made that Sardar Pratap Singh Kairon,\nthe Chief Minister, was not made a party to the proceedings\non the writ petition. The appellant did not implead him in\nthe first instance. It was after the decision of this Court\nin\nR. P. Kapur v. Sardar Pratap Singh Kairon\n(1) that the\nappellant applied for the impleading of the Chief Minister\nas the respondent in the petition. That application was\nrejected by the High Court as no relief had been claimed\nagainst him. The order cannot be said to be wrong when the\nonly ground mentioned for impleading the Chief Minister as a\nparty was to make it incumbent on him to file an affidavit,\nwhich he was not legally obliged to, if he was not a party.\nA number of affidavits sworn by Mrs. Sodhi, Pahwa, Yog Raj,\nOm Prakash, Surendra Singh Kairon and Kirpa Singh were filed\non behalf of the respondent in the Court below. It is now\ncontended that these affidavits should not have been taken\ninto consideration when no reference to them has been made\nin the written statement filed on behalf of the respondent.\nNo such objection seems to have been raised in the Court\nbelow. The allegations in the petition and the affidavit of\nthe appellant with respect to matters concerning these\npersons were not accepted by the\n(1) [1961] 2 S.C.R. 143.\nrespondent. It was therefore not improper or irregular or\nillegal for the State to have secured these affidavits and\nto have filed them in Court. In fact, it should have\nsecured affidavit from the Chief Minister, Mrs. Kairon, the\nInspector-General of Prisons and the Vigilance Inspector\nabout the allegations concerning them. There is therefore\nno force in this contention.\n\nIt has been contended that the allegations of facts made by\nthe appellant in the petition being not specifically con-\ntroverted in the written statement and being not denied by\nthe persons most competent to deny them, should be taken to\nbe established. The contention really refers to the\nallegations made against the Chief Minister and his wife and\nabout certain matters in the tape recorded conversation the\nappellant had with the I.G. of Prison and the Vigilance\nInspector. The appellant has filed a rendering of the con-\nversation alleged to have taken place between him and these\npersons. These persons have not denied, by their own\naffidavits, that they did not have the alleged conversations\nwith the appellant, even though the officers of the State,\non the application of the State, were allowed to listen to\nthe recorded tape conversation and to prepare their own tape\nrecords of the renderings of the tape recordings filed by\nthe appellant in Court in order to enable the State to\nverify the appellant's allegation that the tape-recorded\ntalks were between the appellant and the persons alleged.\nAbsence of such affidavits can at best lead the Court to\naccept what was alleged to be stated by these persons in the\nconversations, but cannot be sufficient to establish what\nthe person talking states to be the statements of other\npersons. The tape recorded conversation between the ap-\npellant and the other person talking with him can only be\ncorroborative evidence of the statement of appellant that\nthe other persons had made such and such statements, but\ncannot be direct or primary evidence that the third person\nhad stated what the other speaker had told the appellant.\nThe High Court did not rely on the renderings of the tape\nrecorded conversation in view of the fact that such tape\nrecording can be tampered with. Tape recordings can be\nlegal evidence by way of corroborating the statements of a\nperson who deposes that the other speaker and\nMinister towards the appellant. There is no allegation that\nthe boy suffered on account of his leaving the appellants\nhouse prior to his being cured completely. There is nothing\nin the record of the alleged conversation between the\nappellant and the wife of the Chief Minister, tape recorded\ntalks nos. 6 and 2 in April and May respectively, to show\nthat the Chief Minister had asked the appellant to perform\nthe operation. Any statement attributed to the Chief\nMinister, by his wife, even if the talk was with her,is not\nevidence of what the Chief Minister had stated, as Sardarni\nPratap Singh Kairon has not been examined. Surendra has\ndenied, in his affidavit, the appellant's performing any\noperation on him at the relevant time. In these\ncircumstances, it is not possible to hold that the Chief\nMinister did ask such a favour from the appellant and that\neven if the appellant's allegation is correct, he felt so\nannoyed with the appellant at Surendra's leaving Jullunder\nfor a few days, be it from the house of the appellant or\nfrom the Circuit House, as to break all such friendship with\nthe appellant as has been alleged by him and swing over to\nthe other extreme and harbour such grudge against him as to\nabuse his position as the Chief Minister, get unjustified\nenquiries launched against him and get the impugned orders\npassed.\n\nAnother allegation is that the Chief Minister himself and\nhis family members, made numerous recommendations asking for\nundue favours pertaining to the sphere of the appellant's\nduties and that when they went beyond the limits of\nendurance, the appellant expressed his inability to comply\nwith some of the extremely unreasonable demands. In support\nof this contention, the appellant filed documents of the B-\nseries, nineteen in number. None of these documents, by\nitself, would show that the appellant was asked to act in a\nmanner which may be said to be not in keeping with the\nproper discharge of his official duties. The contents, by\nthemselves, show that the writers, who included the Chief\nMinister, his sons Surendra and Girendra and his brother\nJaswant Singh, recommended to the appellant certain persons\nfor treatment, for admission in the hospital or for grant of\nmedical certificates. It is not to be presumed that untrue\ncertificates were required to be issued. The appellant does\nnot state in what manner he\nacted improperly and why he did so. The there fact that he\nwas a friend of the Chief Minister would not justify it. He\nheld a responsible position and is expected to have done his\nduty. In case he did not do his duty and thus suffered from\na weakness of character, his conduct can be said to be due\nto his desire to remain in good grace with the Chief\nMinister and thus gain some advantage in the service, be it\npromotion, posting at a good station or protection from any\nadverse action in case he acted improperly in the discharge\nof his official duties. There is nothing in the petition to\nindicate how and when the Chief Minister and the appellant\nbecame friends. The relationship between the Chief Minister\nand an efficient public servant may be a close one, but\nwould not amount to friendship and therefore the explanation\nthat the appellant showed undue favours for some time to\npersons recommended by the Chief Minister and his relations\nmerely on account of friendship does not appear good and,\neven if the appellant's allegation be correct, Ms showing\nundue favours would not antagonize the Chief Minister. The\nappellant has not shown which recommendations he did not\ncomply with and when such occasions arose. Therefore this\nallegation does not establish the Chief Minister's bearing a\ngrudge against the appellant.\n\nThe other reason for the Chief Minister's grievance is said\nto be the appellant's ceasing to comply with the un-\nreasonable requests of the family members of the Chief\nMinister for medicines and other expensive articles. He\ndoes not say which requests and when he did not comply with.\nSo long as he complied with those requests, they would put\nhim in good grace with the Chief Minister and Ms relations.\nIt is however denied that he did supply such things. It\nappears from certain postal receipts filed by the appellant\nthat certain parcels were sent to Mrs. Pratap Singh Karion\nin July and October 1957, March and September 1958 and March\n1959. The receipts do not show that these parcels contained\nmedicines. Tape recorded talks nos. 1, 3, and 4 do refer to\nrequests for and supplies of medicines by the appellant. It\nis also alleged that among the expensive articles supplied\nwere two Singer sewing machines. Cash memos for the\npurchase of two Singer sewing machines by Sardar Bahadur\nBagh Singh, father-in-\nlaw of the appellant in July 1959 and October 1959, have\nbeen filed. In July 1959, a wooden box was sent to Mrs.\nKairon through Pahwa who was then the Traffic Manager of the\nPunjab Roadways at Amritsar. Om Prakash brought that box\nfrom the appellant's place to Pahwa. Both these persons, Om\nPrakash and Pahwa, have filed affidavits. They describe the\nbox to be of such a size that it could not possibly contain\nthe Singer sewing machine. Om Prakash however had stated in\nthe receipt, Annexure C. 9, that he had received a box\nbearing label 'Singer Sewing Machine' from Dr. Partap Singh.\nTape recorded talk no. 3 in August 1959 records Mrs.\nKairon's conversation about receiving a machine and not\nliking it on account of its colour and the appellants\ntelling her, that they would deduct the money in certain\ncontingencies. The State has not filed any affidavit by her\nin denial of these statements. The conversation shows that\nthe appellant supplied a Singer sewing machine to Mrs.\nKairon and that some deduction could be made in the price in\ncertain contingency. There is no reason to disbelieve the\nappellant's statement that he had supplied a Singer sewing\nmachine and medicines to her. These supplies by the\nappellant would however ingratiate him with the Chief-\nMinister. There is nothing on the record to indicate which\nrequests for what medicines and articles and when were\nrefused by the appellant and thus gave cause for grievance\nto the Chief Minister.\n\nAnother reason for the Chief Minister's harbouring a\ngrievance against the appellant is said to have arisen in\nApril 1960 on account of the appellant's asking the Chief\nMinister's friend, Kirpa Singh, whom he had kept as a guest\nfor about 7 months, to leave the appellant's house. Kirpa\nSingh was the Manager of National Motors at jullunder. It\nis alleged in the petition that this firm was either\ndirectly or indirectly owned by Surendra Singh Kairon or a\nclose relation of his. This allegation is very vague. Both\nKirpa Singh and Surendra Singh have denied Surendra Singh's\nhaving any concern with the National Motors at jullunder.\nKirpa Singh did stay at the appellant's house in the alleged\nperiod. His letter Exhibit D-1, however does not indicate\nthat he felt annoyed at leaving the appellant's house where\nhe had stayed from September\n1959 to the end of March 1960. In fact, Kirpa Singh, by his\nletter, expressed his thanks to the appellant. There could\ntherefore be no reason for the Chief Minister to feel\nannoyed and bear grudge against the appellant on account of\nKirpa Singh not staying as a guest of the appellant from\nApril 1960, even though Kirpa Singh was a friend of the\nChief Minister and was kept as guest by the appellant at the\ninstance of Surendra Singh, as appears from the tape\nrecorded talk no. 15.\n\nThe other two reasons for the Chief Minister's being\naggrieved with the appellant relate to what happened sub-\nsequent to April 1960. It is alleged that in September\n1960, the Chief Minister sent a message through the Home\nSecretary, Punjab, to the effect that he had been over\nliberal towards the Akali prisoners in the District Jail.\nIt is stated in the written statement filed by the\nrespondent that the District Magistrate, Jullunder, made\nsuch a complaint to the Home Secretary, who happened to be\nat jullunder and that the Home Secretary conveyed it to the\nappellant at a meeting at which the Inspector-General of\nPrisons and the Collector were also present. The matter was\nclosed as a result of what was talked about at the meeting.\nReference has been made in this connection to the tape\nrecorded conversation the appellant had with the Inspector\nGeneral of Prisons in November 1960. It appears from this\nconversation that exaggerated information had reached the\nChief Minister and made him send the message and that he was\nsatisfied when the I.G. of Prisons explained the matter to\nhim. A Chief Minister's sending a message to an officer\nabout certain complaint received against him cannot be taken\nto indicate his ill-will against that officer. He is bound\nto do so as a part of his, duty.\n\nThe next reason is said to be that the Chief Minister had\nused the appellant extensively in the Karnal Murder Case,\noff the record, when it was the subject matter of an appeal.\nThe Sessions Judge acquitted the accused in that case in\nNovember 1959 and the High Court dismissed the Government\nappeal in May 1960. The appellant did his best to help the\nprosecution with instructions in connection with the medico-\nlegal matters in the case and stated to the Chief Minister\nthat the outcome of the case would\nbe favourable. This is borne out from tape recorded talk\nno. 17 recorded in April 1960. It is alleged that the dis\nmissal of the appeal by the High Court and the ultimate\ndismissal of the Government petition for special leave to\nthe Supreme Court in October 1960 displeased the Chief\nMinister who expressed his displeasure to the appellant. It\ncan be imagined that the Chief Minister in these cir-\ncumstances would sarcastically speak to the appellant about\nthe strong assurances he had given about the outcome of the\ncase, but it is difficult to hold that that would make the\nChief Minister hostile to the appellant despite the hardwork\nhe had done, at his request, in helping the prosecution with\nthe medico-legal aspect of the case. It is significant to\nnote that the appellant does not allege that the Chief\nMinister expressed his displeasure to him in May 1960,\nshortly after the High Court-dismissed the State Appeal.\nAnother cause for the displeasure of the Chief Minister is\nsaid to be the appellant's inability to comply with the\nillegitimate contents of the instructions conveyed to him by\nthe Chief Minister in December 1956 in connection with Dr.\nDhillon's accompanying the Chief Minister for a number of\ndays as medical attendant. The nature of those instructions\nhas not been disclosed. What part the appellant played in\nthe alleged subsequent developments with the Accountant\nGeneral, Punjab, and which were unpalatable to the Chief\nMinister, has not been indicated. The incident took place\nin December 1957 and surely, even if true, does not appear\nto have affected the alleged friendly relations between the\nChief Minister and the appellant up to April 1960.\nWe have considered all the reasons set out by the appellant\nin his petition for the Chief Minister's bearing grudge\nagainst him from May 1960 onward and are of opinion that\nthey, singly or cumulatively, fail to establish that the\nChief Minister had any grievance against the appellant.\nThe earliest definite incident which, according to the ap-\npellant, annoyed the Chief Minister, took place in the\nbeginning of April 1960, as Kirpa Singh was made to leave\nhis house at the end of March 1960. We have held that in\nview of Kirpa Singh's letter of thanks to the appellant,\nthere\ncould have been no cause for the Chief Minister to feel\ndispleased with the appellant. This inference finds support\nfrom the fact that the Chief Minister did not do anything\nagainst the appellant soon after it, but on the other hand,\nentrusted the appellant to perform an important operation\nsecretly on his son Surendra in the end of April 1960, which\ncould be only if he entertained good relations with the\nappellant till then.\n\nWe have also held that the alleged inability of the\nappellant to keep Surendra Singh at his place subsequent to\nthe appellant's performing the operation on him could not\nhave displeased the Chief Minister as no ill-effect fol-\nlowed. This view, again, finds support from the fact that\nthe Chief Minister did nothing against the appellant till\nthe end of October when an enquiry was instituted against\nthe appellant. The alleged incident about Surendra's\nleaving jullunder for a few days before he fully recovered\ndid not therefore lead to any animosity between the Chief\nMinister and the appellant.\n\nThe High Court, Punjab, dismissed the State appeal in the\nKarnal Murder case in May 1960. The appellant is said to\nhave helped the prosecution at the appellate stage. The\nChief Minister could have had cause for dissatisfaction but,\nas we have mentioned earlier, the dismissal of the appeal\ncould not have given rise to such bad feeling in the Chief\nMinister against the appellant as to lead to the transfer of\nthe appellant in October and to institute the enquiry\nagainst him.\n\nThe recorded conversation between the appellant and the I.G.\nof Prisons in November 1960 tends to indicate that the\nappellant's relations with the Chief Minister could not have\nbeen bad in November 1960 as he had sought the advice of the\nI.G. of Prisons about his reporting to the Government about\nthe attitude of the District Magistrate at that meeting. If\nthe relations between the Chief Minister and the appellant\nwere as bad as we are asked to believe, such an idea in\nconnection with the attitude of the District Magistrate,\neven if it was improper, could not have occurred to the\nappellant at that time when the I.G. of Prisons himself had\ntold him : 'In my opinion that matter was hushed up'.\nThe appellant has, however, also urged certain matters as\nindicating the malice borne by the Chief Minister towards\nhim and thus indirectly giving support to his al legation\nthat the Chief Minister had personal grievances against him.\nThe appellant's transfer from Jullunder to Amritsar was\nordered in December 1960. Jullunder, according to the\nappeuant's statement in Court, is a coveted station for\nCivil Surgeons. He had overstayed there the normal period\nof three years. His transfer cannot be attributed to malice\nof the Chief Minister, when an enquiry had been instituted\nagainst him in connection with a complaint regarding the\ndischarge of his duties. Transfer, in such circumstances,\nwas the most natural order to be passed by the Head of a\nDepartment. It may be that for the convenience of its\nofficers transfers are usually ordered in March and April\nand are not ordered shortly before the period of retirement.\nBut any transfer outside that period or sometime before\nretirement, for administrative reasons, cannot be said to be\na transfer ordered mala fide.\n\nThe appellant's brother-in-law, who was officiating in the\nProvincial Civil Service, Executive Branch, was reverted to\nthe lower cadre on November 22, 1960, the reversion being\nbetween the institution of a departmental enquiry against\nthe appellant and the orders of his transfer. This is said\nto be evidence of the general ill-will which the Chief\nMinister bore against the appellant. It is alleged in the\nwritten statement that the reversion was on account of the\nunsatisfactory conduct and work of - the appellant's\nbrother. We cannot take this reversion to be mala fide as\nthere is nothing on the record that it has been so held in\nany proceedings which could have possibly been taken by the\nappellant's brother-in-law against his reversion. Sub-\nsequent cancellation of the reversion orders on his\nrepresentation, as stated in Court by the appellant, does\nnot, by itself point to reversion being made mala fide.\nThe appellant preferred to take leave preparatory to\nretirement and, as already stated, such leave was sanctioned\nto Mm. He proceeded on leave some time in December 1960.\nSubsequently, things happened which could have given cause\nto the Chief Minister for feeling aggrieved with the\nappellant. The Blitz of January 14, 1961 pub-\nlished an article under the caption Punjab's latest scandal:\n\nThe sewing machine of Kairon family'. According to this\narticle, the Civil Surgeon paid the price for the sewing\nmachine and supplied it to the Chief Minister's wife. It\nalso mentioned that the Roadways Official transported it.\nIt described the appellant to be the henchman of the Chief\nMinister and a handyman for Ms family members. It stated\nthat the Civil Surgeon is said to have despatched several.\nmedicine parcels to the Chief Minister's wife by registered\npost and that he was asked to supply them out of the hos-\npital stock. It referred to the Chief Minister's son having\na garage in Jullunder and to the Boarding of the Manager of\nthe Garage with the Civil Surgeon. It also mentioned about\nthe recommendatory letters from the Chief Minister's sons,\nsister-in-law and brother to the Doctor. It referred to Dr.\nDhillon's affair. Naturally, the Chief Minister could have\ntaken this article to be inspired by the appellant and, more\nso when the appellant's wife published a letter in the Blitz\ndated March 18, 1961, practically admitting what had been\nalleged in that article except such matters which went\nagainst her husband. She stated that she sent parcels of\nmedicines by registered post and other means to the wife of\nthe Chief Minister and that the Garage Manager stayed with\nthem as required by the Chief Minister's wife.\nBetween January and March, several things happened which\nindicated to the appellant that the Government was taking\naction against him. On January 17, 1961, the appellant\nreceived a letter dated January 13, 1961,from the Inspector\nof Vigilance, District Jullunder, enquiring from him about\nthe place where and the date when he could be contacted for\nascertaining his view point on points relevant to the\nenquiry ordered by the Punjab Government. This was in\nconnection with the enquiry instituted on October 29, 1960.\nIt is 'alleged for the appellant that the Chief Minister\ncould have seen the copy of the Blitz dated January 14 at\nDelhi on January 13, 1961 and that he then started\nvindictive proceedings against the petitioner and used the\nGovernment machinery in a malicious manner to satisfy his\npersonal malice and vendetta. The implication is that it\nwas on the Chief Minister's knowing of the article published\nin the Blitz dated January 14 that he directed\nthe Vigilance Inspector to issue the letter of January 13\nto. the appellant for ascertaining the place and the date\nwhen he could interrogate him in connection with the\nenquiry. This is a far-fetched idea. The enquiry had been\nin progress since October 29 and it must have been in due\ncourse that the Vigilance Officer wrote the letter dated\nJanuary 13 to the appellant.\n\nWhatever views the Vigilance Inspector expressed about the\nvarious charges framed against the appellant in the tape-\nrecorded talk no. 16 on February 13, 1961, even if they be\nhis real views in the matter, is no index of the fact that\nthe superior officers who had investigated the case had\nformed a similar opinion and that the action taken by the\nGovernment a few months later in formally framing charges\nwith respect to those matters was actuated by malice. The\nletter, Annexure J, dated June 3, 1961 states that the\nevidence brought on record was sufficiently strong to\nwarrant serious action against him. Any views expressed by\nthe Vigilance Inspector who had really no business to\nexpress them when he was deputed to get the explanation or\nthe appellant's version about certain allegations against\nhim, is not sufficient, in our opinion, to look at this\nassertion in the letter with suspicion. In fact, if the\nChief Minister had started the enquiry in October on account\nof malice and had prompted the Vigilance Inspector on\nJanuary 13 as a result of the publication of an article in\nthe Blitz of January 15, 1961, presuming that he had seen\nthat copy of the Blitz at Delhi on January 13, the Chief\nMinister could have very well seen to the early submission\nof the police report making out a case against the appellant\nand would have taken action against the appellant much\nearlier than June 3, 1961, when special steps had to be\ntaken to see that necessary legal action against the\nappellant is complete before his date of retirement on June\n16, 1961. Surely, the Chief Minister could have easily\nmanaged these matters if he were actuated by malice and had\nbeen taking keen personal interest simply with a view to\nwreak vengeance against the appellant who had the audacity\nto act against his wishes even though he had submitted to\nthem for an appreciable time.\n\nIn February 1961, the appellant received a copy of the\nremarks entered in his annual confidential file for the\nyear April 1, 1959, to March 31, 1960: 'Professionally he is\nreported to be somewhat about average. Yet, there has been\npersistent complaints about his avarice and lack of\nintegrity'. The appellant did not appear to have taken any\naction in connection with the adverse remarks communicated\nto him till June 29, 1961, except in so far that he asked\nthe Director of Health Services about the period during\nwhich a representation against such remarks could be made.\nIn his representation dated June 29, 1961, which was\nsubmitted beyond the usual period for making representation,\nthe appellant said:\n\n\"I am constrained to point out that these\nobservations by Shri Kairon, Chief Minister\n(Govt. in the Health Deptt.) do not reflect an\nhonest opinion in the context of certain facts\non record, a few of which are outlined below.\"\n\nand referred to the various matters stated by him in the\npetition. The written. statement shows that these remarks\nwere not made by the Chief Minister but were made by the\nSecretary in the Health Department. We do not know when\nthese remarks were made. The mere fact that they were\ncommunicated in February 1961 does not mean that they were\nrecorded near about that date. Annual remarks, in the\nnature of things, must be made after some appreclable time\nfrom the close of the year as they are based on the receipt\nof the remarks from the departmental heads, who take their\nown time in submitting such remarks. Even if they were made\nnear about February 1961, that would not show that they were\nmade maliciously on account of the Chief Minister's ill-will\nas, by that time, the various complaints against the\nappellant which had come to the notice of the enquiring\nofficer, would have also come to the notice of the\nGovernment. The complaints, according to the charge-sheet\nframed against the appellant,mostly relate to the years 1959\nand 1960.\n\nThe tape-recorded conversations between the appellant and\nthe Chief Minister and his wife were played at a Press\nConference on March 29, 1961, at Chandigarh. This led to\nsome move for an adjournment motion in the Punjab\nLegislative Assembly on March 30.\n\nIn April 1961, the appellant's wife sent a pamphlet 'Acts of\ncorruption by Shri Partap Sing Kairon and his' 51-2 S. C.\nIndia'64\nfamily members' to the Members of Parliament and other\nleading persons throughout the country. This conduct of.\nthe appellant's wife would have again furnished cause for\ngrievance to the Chief Minister.\n\nThe question, however, is whether these acts of the ap-\npellant and his wife giving cause for grievance to the Chief\nMinister between January and April 1961 can be said to have\nled the Government to take the steps against the appellant\nwith regard to his suspension, revocation of leave,\nextension of service and institution of a formal depart-\nmental enquiry out of malice or that such steps were taken\nagainst him in due course. We are of opinion that the steps\ncannot be said to be taken mala fide merely because the\nappellant and his wife acted in a manner which could\nundoubtedly provide cause for grievance to the Chief Minis-\nter. Nothing is on record to indicate why the appellant and\nhis wife felt so prompted as to have an inspired article\nprinted in the Blitz of January 14 and to have the appel-\nlant',,, wife's letter published in the Blitz in March 1961\nand her pamphlets distributed all over the country. Surely,\nthe appellant and his wife cannot be said to have done this\nwith the noble object of bringing the misdeeds of the Chief\nMinister of Punjab to public notice and thereby to cause a\nchange for the better in the administration of the affairs\nin the Punjab. The appellant was not a free man. He was\nstill in service, though on leave preparatory to retirement.\nHe was to retire in June 1961 and therefore he had to\nobserve the usual discipline enjoined on a public servant.\nHis wife too was not to act in manner in which a public\nservant's wife is not expected to act. It cannot be\nbelieved that the appellant did not know what his wife was\ndoing. The conclusion is irresistable that the appellant\nand his wife rushed to the Press so prematurely, even if\nthey could be said to be actuated with laudable motives of\nbringing improvement in the administration of the State, to\ncreate a shield for the appellant in case the police\ninvestigation that was in progress against him culminated in\nthe formulation of formal charges against him and in the\ninstituting of a formal departmental enquiry against him.\nThe design was on the part of the appellant and cannot be\nsaid to be on the part of the Chief Minister, who can be\nresponsible\nfor various orders of Government as the Minister-in-charge\nof the department and as head of the Administration.\nIt has also been contended in connection with the alleged\nmala fides that in view of r. 8.19 of the 1941 rules, the\nGovernment should have refused the leave in December 1960 if\ngenuine complaints had been made against the appellant and\ninvestigation was proceeding on them. The leave was to be\ngoverned by the 1959 rules and r. 8.19 in those rules did\nnot make it incumbent on the Government to refuse leave to\nthe appellant in December 1960. The rule is :\n\n\"Leave shall not be granted to a Government\nservant whom a competent authority has decided\nto dismiss, remove or compulsorily retire from\nGovernment service.\"\n\nGovernment had not arrived at any such decision and there-\nfore could not have and was not bound to refuse leave by\nresorting to r. 8.19. Even the rule as it stood in the 1941\nrules could not have justified the Government resorting to\nit for refusing leave to the appellant. That rule was:\n\n\"Leave should not be granted to a Government\nservant who is to be dismissed or removed from\nservice for misconduct or general\ninefficiency, if such leave will have the\neffect of postponing the date of dismissal or\nremoval, or to a Government servant whose\nconduct is at thetime forming, or is in\nthe near future, likely to form,the\nsubject matter of departmental enquiry.\"\n\nThe rule wasnot mandatory. It was discretionary with the\nGovernment to grant leave or not. The police was investi-\ngating into the complaint against the appellant in December\n1960 and it would have been too much for the Government to\nform a definite opinion about the action to be taken against\nthe appellant then.\n\nThe grant of leave to the appellant in 1960 does not\ntherefore indicate that the Government had not received any\ncomplaint against him by the time it granted him leave and\nthat the Government's subsequent action against the\nappellant was mala fide.\n\nAnother submission for the appellant to establish his case\nof mala fides against the respondent is that the Government\nhaving sanctioned him leave, need not have taken recourse to\nsuspending him and revoking his leave, but\ncould have taken adequate action against the appellant under\nr. 2.2(b), Vol. 11, 1941 rules, if he was found guilty of\ngrave misconduct as a result of the departmental proceedings\nthe Government was to institute against him. The mere fact\nthat Government took one type of action open to them and not\nthe other, is no ground to hold the Government action mala\nfide. Further, resort to r. 2.2(b) could have been taken\nonly if the appellant was found guilty of grave misconduct\nand it would have been always a debatable point whether the\ncharges made out against him established grave misconduct or\nsimple misconduct. Action under that rule can be taken only\nin limited circumstances.\n\nWe are therefore of opinion that it is not established that\nthe impugned orders were made by the Governor not with the\nostensible object of a proper departmental enquiry against\nthe appellant with respect to the complaints received\nagainst him, complaints found to have substance by the\npolice on investigation but were made with the ulterior\npurpose of causing harassment and loss of reputation to the\nappellant as he had been instrumental in making public\nallegations tending to bring the Chief Minister of the State\ninto disrepute.\n\nWe therefore dismiss the appeal.\n\nBY COURT: In view of the opinion of the majority, the appeal\nis allowed. There will be no order as to costs here and in\nthe High Court.\n\nAppeal allowed.",
