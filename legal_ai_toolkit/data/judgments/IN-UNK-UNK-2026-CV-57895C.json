Nagaraj v. Union of\nIndia\n .\n\n \nThe respondents herein, i.e., applicants in the O.As, are all\nemployees of the Railways working in different cadres. They\ninvoked the jurisdiction of the Tribunal aggrieved by the action of\nthe Railways in promoting members of the Scheduled Castes and \nthe Scheduled Tribes, who were juniors to them in service, on the\nbasis of reservation. They contended before the Tribunal that such\nreservation was in violation of the law declared by the Supreme\nCourt in M. Nagaraj1; \nSuraj Bhan Meena v. State of Rajasthan\n ,\nand \nUttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited v. Rajesh\nKumar\n . They sought a direction that the select list, which\nincluded candidates belonging to the reserved category, be set\naside; the select list be revised by following seniority in the feeder\ncategory; and the applicants (other than those who belong to the\nreserved category) be promoted with all consequential benefits.\n\n \nBy its order in O.A.No.203 of 2013 and O.A.Nos.1417 and\n1433 of 2012 dated 12.07.2013 (which is under challenge in W.P.\nNo.39158 of 2013), the Tribunal held that post-2006 the question\nof reservation in promotion, and consequential benefits etc., would\nbe governed by the judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1;\nthe Supreme Court in Suraj Bhan Meena2 and in Uttar Pradesh \nPower Corporation Limited3 had followed the earlier judgment of\nthe Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj1; the Railways was not able\nto demonstrate that they had undertaken the exercise to collect\nquantifiable data as envisaged in M. Nagaraj1; the applicants had\nrightly urged that the Railways, if they had to continue with\nreservation in promotion with consequential benefits, had to collect\nquantifiable data, and satisfy the parameters \nlaid down in\n M.\nNagaraj1 and, if they had not done so, their action would be illegal;\nthe Railways had merely stated, in their reply, that they were\nfollowing the Railway Boards Circulars and DOP&T instructions;\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, was\ncategorical; and, in the light of \nthe said judgment\n, the O.As should\nbe allowed.\n\n In its order in O.A. No.125 of 2014 dated 15.01.2015 (which\nis under challenge in W.P.No.775 of 2015) the Tribunal rejected the\npreliminary objection of the petitioners herein that the O.A. was\nbarred by limitation. After referring extensively to the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, the Tribunal held that the\napplicants had contended that the Railway authorities did not\ncomply with the directions of the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1,\nfor providing reservation in promotion; they had further contended\nthat the Railways was bound to collect data to show that the\nreserved candidates were inadequately represented in the services,\nand they had overall administrative efficiency; no exercise had\nbeen carried out by the authorities to collect such data; the main\nobjection raised by the applicants was that the authorities did not\nundertake any exercise before providing reservation in promotion;\nthe mandatory exercise, stipulated by the Constitution Bench in\nM. Nagaraj1, required the State to collect quantifiable data showing\n\n(i) backwardness of the class, (ii) inadequacy of representation of\nthat class, (iii) compliance with \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution of\nIndia; these directions were not complied by the Railways;\nadmittedly the condition precedent, as \nlaid down by\n the Supreme\nCourt in M. Nagaraj1, was not satisfied; no exercise had been\nundertaken by the Railways before providing reservation in\npromotion by the impugned selection; the Railways had merely \nstated that reservation was required in promotional posts, without\ncollecting necessary data of the reserved candidates in the select\nlist, and without satisfying the preconditions \nlaid down in\n M.\nNagaraj1; and the impugned promotions were not valid. The\nselection of reserved candidates, and their inclusion in the select\nlist, was quashed and the Railways were directed to provide\nreservation in promotion, after collecting necessary data, as \nlaid\ndown by\n the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1. \n\n \nIt is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that no factual\nfoundation was laid by the applicants before the Tribunal to show\nthat the order of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1 had been\nviolated; the O.A. was liable to be dismissed on the ground of\nlimitation; the burden was on the respondents-applicants to\nestablish violation of \nArticles 14\n and \n16 (1)\n of the Constitution of\nIndia, by the reservation provided under \nArticle 16 (4)\n and \n16 (4-\nA);\n this onus was not discharged by them; the respondents-\napplicants had only challenged the covering letter dated\n22.01.2014, and not the original order issued by the Railway\nBoard dated 22.01.2014; the Tribunal had not assigned any\nreasons for allowing the O.As; no rule or circular had been\nchallenged before the Tribunal; there was no plea in the O.As\nregarding excessive representation or of persons included in the\nselect list not being backward; even the seniority list was\nchallenged belatedly; the Tribunal did not examine the circulars\napplicable in this regard; the respondents-applicants, who have\nnot participated in the selection, cannot turn around and question\nthe very selection itself; the original selection list dated\n24.04.2006, and the subsequent circulars of 2008 and 2010 have\nnot been challenged; the Tribunal is the Court of first instance; the\nmaterial on record could alone have been considered by the\nTribunal; in the absence of pleadings, this Court would not take\nupon itself the task of examining this issue; there is no averment\nin the O.A. that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\nare not backward or that there is excessive representation or even\nthat, by providing reservation in promotion, efficiency in\nadministration would be adversely affected; the grounds of\nchallenge, to the validity of the selection list, should be clear and\nspecific; the onus is on the person, who invokes the jurisdiction of\nthe Tribunal, to show how the judgment in M. Nagaraj1 has not\nbeen followed; neither is there any pleading nor is there any\nfinding except to refer to the judgment in M. Nagaraj1; contentions,\nnot even raised in O.A, have been referred to in the order, as if they\nhad been raised; only the issue was decided in M. Nagaraj1, and all\nthe cases were referred back to the appropriate Bench; the\njudgments in Suraj Bhan Meena2 and Uttar Pradesh Power \nCorporation Limited3 were decided on the factual matrix of those\ncases wherein there was a challenge to the circulars/rules; the\nSupreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, did not hold that there should be\nno reservation in promotion or that reservation should only be\nprovided after the exercise is completed; any finding recorded,\nwithout any plea, is a perverse finding; the order passed without\nfactual foundation is liable to be set aside; the policy of the\nRailways, in providing reservation in promotion, has been in\nexistence for several decades; the validity of the action of the\nrailways can only be examined in properly constituted proceedings\nwherein factual foundation is laid; no rejoinder was filed, by the\napplicants in the O.A, to the counters filed in reply to the O.As;\neven otherwise, the Railways have fulfilled the parameters\n, \nlaid\ndown in\n M. Nagaraj1, in providing reservation in promotion; and\nthe order of the Tribunal must be set aside.\n\n \nOn the other hand it is contended, on behalf of the\nrespondents-applicants, that the select list, prepared vide memo\ndated 01.08.2011, was initially operated only till serial No.166; the\nlife of the panel, which was for two years, expired on 31.07.2013; it\nis only by letter dated 22.01.2014 was the life of the panel\nextended; but for such extension, the earlier select list would have\nceased to operate; the respondents-applicants have invoked the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal within one year of the proceedings\ndated 22.01.2014 whereby the life of the panel was extended; the\nlaw \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj, required the\nRailways to show that they had gathered adequate data to provide\nreservation in promotion; as the Railways had failed to place any\nsuch data, the Tribunal was justified in setting aside the select list,\nand in directing the Railways to follow the law declared in M.\nNagaraj1; the State is bound to place data before the Court to show\nthat the law declared by the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, has\nbeen complied with; the validity of the DoPT circulars was\nconsidered by the Principal Bench of the Central Administrative\nTribunal in O.A.No.2211 of 2008 dated 02.12.2010; and the\nimpugned order of the Tribunal is valid, and does not necessitate\ninterference.\n\n Heard Sri G.S. Sanghi, Learned Senior Standing Counsel for\nRailways, Smt. Pushpender Kaur, Learned Standing Counsel for \nRailways, Sri G. Vidyasagar, Learned Senior Counsel, Sri J.\nSudheer, Sri K. Chidambaram and Sri A. Durga Bhaskar, Learned \nCounsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners and Sri K.R.K.V.\nPrasad, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents.\nIt is convenient to examine the submissions, made by Learned\nCounsel on either side, under different heads.\n\nI. HAS FACTUAL FOUNDATION BEEN LAID, IN THE \n PLEADINGS BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL, JUSTIFYING \n GRANT OF RELIEF? \n\n It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that no factual\nfoundation was laid, in the applications filed in the various O.As\nbefore the Tribunal, to show how the order of the Supreme Court\nin M. Nagaraj1, Suraj Bhan Meena2; and Uttar Pradesh Power \nCorporation Limited3 had been violated by the Railways; in M.\nNagaraj1 the Supreme Court had, after declaring the law, directed\nthe matters to be posted before the regular bench for examination,\nof the applicability of the law declared by it, in each individual\ncase; a bald and vague averment that the Railways had failed to\nadhere to the order of the Supreme Court, in the aforesaid\njudgments, would not suffice; factual details, of the manner in\nwhich the Railways had violated the aforesaid judgments of the\nSupreme Court, should have been pleaded; it is only if factual\nfoundation had been laid in this regard, in the applications filed in\nsupport of the various O.As, could the Tribunal have recorded its\nfindings thereupon; any finding recorded by the Tribunal, not\nsupported by the pleadings on record, is an error of law apparent\non the face of the record; the burden lies heavily on the\nrespondents-applicants, who had invoked the jurisdiction of the\nTribunal, to establish that the reservation provided, in terms of\n\nArticle 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n, by the Railways violated their\nfundamental rights under \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n of the Constitution\nof India; no rule or circular has been challenged in any of the O.As;\nthe circulars issued by the Railways between the years 2008 to\n2010, (after the judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1),\nhave also not been put in issue; in the absence of any plea, the\nTribunal was not justified in examining these issues; this Court\nwould also not examine these issues for the first time in writ\nproceedings, as the Tribunal is the Court of first instance; there is\nno averment in the O.As, that the members of the Scheduled \nCastes, who are being considered for promotion, are not backward;\nthere is also no averment that the representation in services, of the\nScheduled Castes, is excessive; the O.As do not even state, much \nless detail, how providing reservation in promotion for the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes would affect efficiency\nin administration; the grounds of challenge to the select list,\nwhereby members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled \nTribes were sought to be promoted, should be clear and specific;\nneither is there any plea in the O.As nor has the Tribunal recorded\nany finding on whether and how the Railways had acted contrary\nto the judgment of the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, in providing\nreservation in promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes; mere reference to the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in M. Nagaraj1, in the applications filed in support of the\nO.As, would not suffice; the Tribunal ought to have dismissed the\nO.As. on the ground of lack of pleadings; on the contrary, the\nTribunal has dealt with the contentions which have not even been\npleaded in the O.As, but were put forth only during the course of\narguments; any finding, recorded without any plea, is a perverse\nfinding; the policy of the Railways, in providing reservation in\npromotion, has been in existence for the past several decades;\nthough the plea, of absence of pleadings, was raised by the\npetitioners herein in their counter filed before the Tribunal, the\napplicants in the O.As chose not to file any rejoinder thereto; and,\non this short ground alone, the impugned orders of the Tribunal\nnecessitate being set aside.\n\n On the other hand it is contended, on behalf of the\nrespondents-applicants, that the contention of the Railways having\nproviding reservation in promotion even after the law declared by\nthe Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, without first ascertaining\nwhether the parameters prescribed for providing reservations in\npromotion were satisfied, has been raised in the O.As; it would\nsuffice for the applicants to raise such a plea; it is not necessary\nfor the said plea to be elaborated in detail; the law declared by the\nSupreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, required the Railways to place\ndata before the Tribunal to show that the parameters, stipulated in\n\nthe said judgment\n,were satisfied; no such material was placed by\nthe Railways before the Tribunal; even in the present Writ\nPetitions, the Railways have not shown how the parameters\n, \nlaid\ndown by\n the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, are satisfied; it is only\nif these parameters are satisfied, can reservations be provided, in\nfavour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, in\npromotion; as the onus was on the Railways to show that they had\ncomplied with the parameters, before providing reservation in\npromotion, the Tribunal was justified in setting aside the\npromotions of the unofficial respondents in the O.As; and the\npleadings in the O.As sufficiently show that reservation was being\nprovided, for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, in\npromotion without fulfilling the parameters \nlaid down by\n the\nSupreme Court in M. Nagaraj1; and the order of the Tribunal does\nnot necessitate interference on this ground.\n\n \nNo party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleading,\nand all necessary and material facts should be pleaded by the\nparty in support of the case set up by it. (\nNational Textile Corpn.\nLtd. v. Nareshkumar Badrikumar Jagad\n ; \nRam Sarup Gupta v. \nBishun Narain Inter College\n ; \nBachhaj Nahar v. Nilima\nMandal\n ). Pleadings are the foundation of litigation. There must be\nenough factual allegations to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level. The pleadings must contain something more than\na statement of facts that merely create a suspicion of a legally\ncognizable right of action.\n \n(\nMaria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes\nv. Erasmo Jack\n de Sequeira ; Bell Atlantic Corporation v.\nTwombly ). A party must take appropriate pleadings, and lay\ndown the factual foundation, so that the court may reach a just\nconclusion.\n \n(\nRajasthan State Industrial Development &\nInvestment Corpn. v. Subhash Sindhi Coop. Housing Society\n ).\nPleadings and particulars are necessary to enable the court to\ndecide the rights of the parties. As a rule relief, not founded on the\npleadings, should not be granted. A decision cannot be based on\ngrounds outside the pleadings of the parties.\n \n(National Textile\nCorpn. Ltd.4; \nTrojan & Co. v. Nagappa Chettiar\n ; \nState of\nMaharashtra v. Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd.\n and \nKalyan\nSingh Chouhan v. C.P. Joshi\n ).\n\n \nA new ground raising a pure question of law or a legal issue,\nfor which no inquiry/proof is required, can be permitted to be\nraised by the Court at any stage of the proceedings, (National\nTextile Corpn. Ltd.4; \nSanghvi Reconditioners (P) Ltd. v. Union\nof India\n ; and \nGreater Mohali Area Development Authority v.\nManju Jain\n ), but a question of fact, which requires investigation\nand inquiry and for which no factual foundation has been laid by a\nparty before the Court or the Tribunal, cannot be allowed to be\nagitated. If the Court, for some compelling circumstances, desires\nto entertain a new factual plea, it must give due opportunity to the\nopposite party to controvert the same and adduce evidence to\nsubstantiate its pleadings. It is not permissible for the Court to\nconsider a new case on facts or mixed question of fact and law\nwhich was not the case of the parties before the Court or the\nTribunal below.\n \n(Greater Mohali Area Development Authority14;\n\nState of U.P. v. Dr. Anupam Gupta\n ; \nRam Kumar Agarwal v. \nThawar Das\n ; \nVasantha Viswanathan v. V.K. Elayalwar\n ; \nAnup \nKumar Kundu v. Sudip Charan Chakraborty\n ; Tirupati Jute\nIndustries (P) Ltd. v. State of W.B. and Sanghvi\nReconditioners (P) Ltd.13).\n\n \nIn \nSouthern Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. v.\nElectricity Inspector & ETIO\n , the Supreme Court held that, for\nattracting \nArticle 14\n, necessary facts are required to be pleaded;\nthe foundational facts, as to how the statutory provision was\ndiscriminatory, had not been stated; the respondents did not have\nthe opportunity to meet the said contention; and such factual\nfoundation, unless it was apparent from the statute itself, could\nnot be permitted to be laid later.\n \nIn \nBangalore Development\nAuthority v. Aircraft Employees Coop. Society Ltd.\n, , the\nSupreme Court held that, though the applicants had pleaded that a\nprovision was discriminatory, no factual foundation was laid in\nsupport of this plea; and, in the absence of such foundation, the\nCourt was not justified in recording its conclusion that the\nimpugned provision was violative of the equality clause contained\nin \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n \nIn \nUnion of India v. Pushpa Rani\n , the Supreme Court\nheld:-\n\n The point which remains to be considered is whether the order of the\nTribunal, which has been confirmed by the High Court, can be maintained by\napplying the ratio of M. Nagaraj case6. Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, learned Senior\nCounsel appearing for some of the respondents, made strenuous efforts to\nconvince us that the policy of reservation cannot be applied at the stage of\nmaking promotions because the Railway Administration did not produce any \nevidence to show that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were not \nadequately represented in different cadres and that the efficiency of\nadministration will not be jeopardised by reserving posts for Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes, but we have not felt persuaded to accept this submission.\nIn the applications filed by them, the respondents did not plead that the\napplication of the policy of reservation would lead to excessive\nrepresentation of the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, \nor that the existing policy of reservation framed by the Government of\nIndia was not preceded by an exercise in relation to the issue of adequacy\nof their representation. Rather, the thrust of their claim was that\nrestructuring of different cadres in Group C and D resulted in upgradation\nof posts and the policy of reservation cannot be applied qua upgraded\nposts. Therefore, the Union of India and the Railway Administration did\nnot get opportunity to show that the employees belonging to Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes did not have adequate representation in\ndifferent cadres; that the outer limit of reservation i.e. 50% will not be\nviolated by applying the policy of reservation and that the efficiency of\nadministration will not be jeopardised by applying the policy of\nreservation. Therefore, it is neither possible nor desirable to entertain a\ntotally new plea raised on behalf of the respondents, more so, because\nadjudication of such plea calls for a detailed investigation into the issues of\nfacts.(emphasis supplied). \n\n As the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the\npetitioners have referred mainly to the documents filed in W.P.\nNo.39158 of 2013 and W.P. No.775 of 2015, it is convenient to\nrefer to the pleadings in the O.As which are the subject matter of\nthese Writ Petitions to ascertain whether factual foundation was\nlaid by the respondents-applicants for the relief sought for in the\nO.As. In O.A. No.1433 of 2012, (the order passed in which is\nunder challenge in W.P. No.39158 of 2013), the respondents-\napplicants questioned the action of the Railways in observing, vide\nmemo dated 04.12.2012, the rule of reservation, and the principle\nof own merit, in respect of SC/ST employees in promotions while\npublishing the select list for the post of Passenger Guards/Senior\nPassenger Guards in the Secunderabad Division. \nIn the said O.A,\nthe respondent-applicants pleaded that they were working as\nSenior Goods Guards; their names were reflected in the seniority\nlist published by the Secunderabad Division; the Secunderabad\nDivision of the Railways, without issuing any notification and\nwithout declaring the number of vacancies, had published the\nselect list for the post of Passenger Guards/Senior Passenger\nGuards, vide memo dated 04.12.2012; the railways had followed\nthe rule of reservation in promotion, in violation of the law declared\nby the Supreme Court, and the earlier orders of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal; while publishing the panel, the names of\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes were \nconsidered on their own merit against unreserved posts; a large\nnumber of employees belonging to SC/ST, who were juniors to the \npetitioners, were included in the select list; as the respondents had\nfollowed the rule of reservation in promotion, including the own\nmerit concept, 15 posts had been filled up by SC/ST employees\nwho had joined in the goods guard cadre subsequent to the\nrespondents-applicants; as a result of the policy of reservation in\npromotion, employees, who belonged to SC/ST category, were \npromoted ahead of them to the post of Senior Goods Guards in the\nyears 2008-2011; on account of such accelerated promotion, and \nthe advantage of seniority they gained, members belonging to the\nSCs and STs were further promoted to the post of passenger\nguards/senior passenger guards; the selection was finalised\nwithout transparency, and without issuing any notification; the\nvacancies, which included anticipated vacancies, were filled up by\na large number of juniors to the applicants; some of the promotees\nhave been impleaded as party respondents in the O.As; as the rule\nof reservation in promotions was observed, even after the judgment\nof the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, SC/ST employees, who were \njuniors to the applicants, would get accelerated promotion to the\npost of senior goods guards with the further benefit of seniority;\nthey would then march ahead of the applicants; the Railways had\nfilled up vacancies, in the category of Passenger Guards/Senior\nPassenger Guards, by providing reservation in promotion, and\napplying the principle of own merit in respect of SC/ST\nemployees, even after Courts/Tribunals have held that the said\npolicy/instruction is illegal and arbitrary; the action of the\nrespondents, in considering a large number of SC/ST employees \nfor promotion to the post of passenger guard/senior passenger\nguard, based on the existing seniority list in the feeder category of\nsenior goods guard, (which list was prepared on the basis of the\naccelerated promotion given to SC/ST employees), is arbitrary and\nillegal; such promotions were given, despite the law declared by the\nSupreme Court; the Government could not follow the policy of\nreservation in promotion without complying with the\ncriteria/parameters \nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1 and Suraj Bhan\nMeena2; the aforesaid judgments have been followed by the\nPrincipal Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal and other\nHigh Courts in the country; directions were given by\nCourts/Tribunals to the Government not to follow the principle of\nown merit in respect of SC/ST employees; the relevant\ninstructions were struck down as it had resulted in excess\noperation of the roster point relating to SC/STs; in view of the\ndecision of the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, reservation in\npromotion and granting consequential seniority to the SC/ST\nemployees, without following the pre-conditions \nlaid down in\n\nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n of the Constitution, is illegal; and the\nrespondents had issued the select list resulting in a large number\nof junior SC/ST employees being granted higher status/promotion\ndetrimental to the interests of seniors such as the applicants.\n\n \nIn the application filed in O.A. No.125 of 2014 (the order\npassed in which is under challenge in W.P. No.775 of 2015), the\napplicants stated that, in view of passage of time resulting in\nexpiry of the life of panel i.e., two years, they had submitted a\nrepresentation dated 31.07.2013 requesting the fourth respondent\nto issue a fresh select list in supersession of the operating panel\ndated 01.08.2011, as they were seniors to the SC/ST employees \nenlisted in the said panel; the respondents should have issued\nproceedings to extend the currency of the panel only to the extent\nof the unreserved zone, but not to the zone relating to the roster\npoint of SC/ST, as that would result in juniors to the applicants,\nwhose names were included in the select list and who belonged to\nSC/STs, being promoted in violation of the settled law; the\nRailways was promoting juniors, following the principles of\nreservation in promotion, in disregard to the law \nlaid down by\n the\nSupreme Court and other Courts/Tribunals, though no\nquantifiable data, on the parameters \nlaid down by\n the Supreme\nCourt, has been published; implementation of the policy of\nreservation in promotion, without complying with the\ncriteria/parameters \nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1, Suraj Bhan Meena2,\nand Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited3, is illegal; as a\nresult the applicants, who belong to the unreserved category, are\nnot being promoted; and the action of the Railway Board in seeking\nto extend the currency of the panel, even though the Tribunal had\ndeclared such a panel containing junior SC/ST employees as \nillegal, is in violation of \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n21\n of the Constitution\nof India.\n\n As shall be referred to in detail hereinafter in this order, the\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, held\nthat before exercising the enabling power, under \nArticles 16(4-A)\n\nand (4-B) of the Constitution of India to provide reservation in\npromotion and in conferring the benefit of consequential seniority\nin favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the\nState should collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the\nclass, inadequacy of representation of that class in public\nemployment, and compliance of the requirement of maintaining\noverall efficiency in administration as stipulated in \nArticle 335\n of\nthe Constitution. In view of the law declared by the Supreme\nCourt, in M. Nagaraj1, compliance with the aforesaid parameters\nby the Railways is a condition precedent for providing reservation\nin promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes.\n\n \nAs the relief sought for by the respondents-applicants before\nthe Tribunal was to set aside the promotions given to the members\nof the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, on the ground\nthat the Railways could not have provided reservation in promotion\nto higher posts, without complying with the aforesaid parameters\n\nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1, it would suffice if there are specific\naverments in this regard in the O.As, filed by the respondents-\napplicants, before the Tribunal. As is evident from the averments,\nin the O.As referred to hereinabove, the respondents-applicants\nhave pleaded that the Government was not entitled to follow the\npolicy of reservation in promotion without complying with the\ncriteria/parameters \nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1 and Suraj Bhan\nMeena2; in view of the decision of the Supreme Court, in M.\nNagaraj1, reservation in promotion and granting consequential\nseniority to SC/ST employees, without following the pre-conditions\n\nlaid down in\n \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n of the Constitution, is\nillegal; the respondents (Railways) were consistently giving\npromotion to juniors, following the principles of reservation in\npromotion, in disregard to the law \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court\nand other Courts/Tribunals, though no quantifiable data, on the\nparameters \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court, have been published; \nand implementation of the policy of reservation in promotion,\nwithout complying with the criteria/parameters \nlaid down in\n M.\nNagaraj1, Suraj Bhan Meena2, and Uttar Pradesh Power \nCorporation Limited3 is illegal. Sufficient pleas have been taken\nin the O.As, and adequate factual foundation has been laid\ntherein, for the Court/Tribunal to reach a just conclusion, and to\nenable it to decide the rights of the parties to the relief sought for.\n\n In Pushpa Rani22, the applicants did not even plead, in the\nO.As filed before the Tribunal, that application of the policy of\nreservation would lead to excessive representation of the members\nof the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, or that the\nexisting policy of reservation framed by the Government was not\npreceded by an exercise in relation to the issue of adequacy of their\nrepresentation. Reliance placed by the petitioners, on Pushpa\nRani22, is misplaced. We see no merit in the contention, urged on\nbehalf of the petitioners, that the orders passed by the Tribunal\nnecessitate interference on the ground that they were passed even\nin the absence of pleadings sufficient to grant relief.\nII. WERE THE O.As FILED BY THE RESPONDENTS- \n\n APPLICANTS BEYOND THE PERIOD OF LIMITATION \n PRESCRIBED UNDER SECTION 21 OF THE \n ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS ACT? \n\n It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the select\nlist dated 01.08.2011, which forms the basis for providing\nreservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, has not been subjected to challenge in the O.As\nfiled before the Tribunal; the respondents-applicants have also not\nquestioned the original order dated 22.01.2014, but have only\nquestioned the covering letter of the same date; the belated\nchallenge to the select list, beyond the period of limitation\nprescribed in \nSection 21\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act, could\nonly have been entertained by the Tribunal if a petition had been\nfiled to condone the delay; neither was any such petition filed\nbefore the Tribunal, nor did the Tribunal condone the delay; and\nas the selection now made, is on the basis of the select list dated\n01.08.2011, any belated challenge thereto, beyond the period of\nlimitation prescribed in \nSection 21\n of the Administrative Tribunals\nAct, should not have been entertained by the Tribunal.\n\n On the other hand it is contended, on behalf of the\nrespondents in these Writ Petitions (applicants in the O.As), that\nthe select list, in memo dated 01.08.2011, was initially operated\nonly upto serial No.166 thereat; it was not operated thereafter; the\ncurrency of the panel is only for two years which expired by\n31.03.2013; it is by proceedings dated 22.01.2014 that the life of\nthe panel was extended; but for such extension the panel,\nprepared pursuant to the select list dated 01.08.2011, would not\nhave been operated; the respondents herein (applicants in the\nO.As) are aggrieved by the life of the panel being extended by\nproceedings dated 22.01.2014; they invoked the jurisdiction of the\nTribunal just a few months after the proceedings dated 22.01.2014\nwas issued; the O.As filed by them can neither be said to be\nbarred by limitation nor to be hit by delay and laches; and the\nTribunal was justified in entertaining the O.As and deciding them\non merits.\n\n \nNo party can claim relief as a matter of right, as one of the\ngrounds for refusing relief is if the person approaching the court is\nguilty of delay and laches. The Court, exercising public law\njurisdiction, does not encourage agitation of stale claims where the\nright of third parties have crystallised in the interregnum.\n(\nAflatoon v. Lt. Governor of Delhi\n ; \nState of Mysore v. V.K.\nKangan\n ; \nMunicipal Council, Ahmednagar v. Shah Hyder \nBeig\n ; \nInder Jit Gupta v. Union of India\n ; \nShiv Dass v. Union\nof India\n ; \nA.P. SRTC v. N. Satyanarayana\n ; \nCity and Industrial\nDevelopment Corpn. v. Dosu Aardeshir Bhiwandiwala\n ; \nShiba \nShankar Mohapatra v. State of Orissa\n ). A party should\napproach the court just after accrual of the cause of the complaint.\nThe principle on which the court proceeds, in refusing relief to the\npetitioner on the ground of laches or delay, is that the rights,\nwhich have accrued to others by reason of the delay in filing the\napplication/writ petition, should not be allowed to be disturbed\nunless there is a reasonable explanation for the delay. The action\nof courts cannot harm innocent parties if their rights emerge by\nreason of delay on the part of the person moving the Court.\n \n(Shiba\nShankar Mohapatra30; \nRamchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State \nof Maharashtra\n ; \nTilokchand Motichand v. H.B. Munshi\n ).\n\n In Secy. to Govt. of India v. Shivram Mahadu Gaikwad ,\nthe Supreme Court held:-\n\n..When we turn to the judgment of the Tribunal we find that there is no\nmention about the question of limitation even though it stared in the face. It\nwould immediately occur to anyone that since the order of discharge was\nof 7-10-1986 and the application was filed in 1990, it was clearly barred by\nlimitation unless an application for condoning the delay was made under\n\nSection 21(3)\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act. No such application was\nin fact made. Even if it was the contention of the employee that he was\nsuffering from schizophrenia, that could have been projected as a ground for\ncondonation of delay under sub-section (3) of \nSection 21\n of the said statute.\nEven otherwise without insisting on the formality of an application under\n\nSection 21(3)\n if the Tribunal had dealt with the question of limitation in\nthe context of \nSection 21\n we may have refrained from interfering with the\norder of the Tribunal under \nArticle 136\n, but it seems that the Tribunal\ntotally overlooked this question which clearly stared in the face. Even the\nemployee made no effort to explain the delay and seek condonation. We \nfind no valid explanation on record for coming to the conclusion that the\ncase for condonation of delay is made out. In the circumstances, there is no\ndoubt that the application was clearly barred by limitation.. (emphasis\nsupplied).\n\n \nAs \nSection 21(2)\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act gives a\nright to make an application within one year of the grievances\ncovered under clauses (a) and (b) of \nSection 21(1)\n, and within the\nouter limit of six months in respect of the grievances covered under\n\nSection 21(2)\n, the applicant need not give any explanation for the\ndelay having occurred during that period. The applicant is entitled,\nas of right, to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for redressal\nof his grievance. It is only if the application is filed beyond that\nperiod, does the need arise to give a satisfactory explanation for the\ndelay caused till the date of filing of the application. The question\nof satisfaction of the Tribunal, in this regard, would arise only\nthereafter. \nSection 21(3)\n starts with a non obstante clause, which\nwipes out the effect of \nSection 21(2)\n, and the need arises thereby to\nfurnish a satisfactory explanation for the delay which occasioned\nafter the expiry of the period prescribed in \nSection 21(1)\n and (2).\n(\nState of Karnataka v. S.M. Kotrayya\n ).\n\n Among the reliefs sought for in O.A.No.020/00125/ 2014\n(the order passed in which is under challenge in W.P.No.775 of\n2015), is to declare that the permission accorded by the Railway\nBoard, vide their letter dated 22.1.2014, extending the currency of\nthe panel could not be applied to the select list for the post of Loco-\n\nPilot (goods) as it is illegal. By proceedings dated 01.08.2011, a\nselect list of employees was prepared for promotion to the post of\nLoco Pilot (goods) pursuant to a suitability test conducted by the\ncommittee, on the basis of perusal of the records, on 26.07.2011.\nThe select list contains, from serial No.167 downwards, members\nof the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes who were placed \nin the select list as reservation was provided in promotion. The\nsaid memo dated 01.08.2011 records that there was a short fall of\n12 Scheduled Castes and 35 Scheduled Tribes; there were no \nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes employees eligible and \navailable for whom the 47 vacancies were kept; and the select list\nwas provisional.\n\n By proceedings dated 22.01.2014, the South Central\nRailways, after referring to the Railway Boards letter of the same\ndate ie., 22.01.2014, communicated the approval of the Railway\nBoard for extension of the currency of the panel, for promotion to\nthe post of Loco Pilot (goods), which had expired on 31.07.2013 for\na period of one year as a special case. It is not in dispute that the\ncurrency of the panel, prepared pursuant to the select list dated\n01.08.2011, was for a period of two years and expired by\n31.07.2013. But for the extension granted by the Railway Board\nvide circular dated 22.01.2014, the panel could not have been\noperated after 31.07.2013. If the period of limitation under \nSection\n21\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act is reckoned from the date of\nthe Railway Boards Circular dated 22.01.2014, the said O.A. was\nfiled within the period of limitation.\n\n \nIn \nKuldip Chand v. Union of India\n , the Supreme Court\nheld:-\n\n .. It is next contended by Mr M.M. Kashyap, learned counsel for the\nappellant, that Ashok Kumar disputed the correctness of the seniority list made\non 23-12-1982 in his representations dated 10-1-1983 and 1-8-1983 which\nwere duly considered and rejected. He allowed it to become final as he did not\nchallenge the same till post of accountant became vacant. When it was rejected,\nhe filed the writ petition in the High Court. There is a considerable delay in\nclaiming his seniority over the appellant. It is true that the seniority list\nwas prepared as early as on 23-12-1982 but no vacancy had arisen\nthereafter and, therefore, the mere rejection of the claim for seniority does\nnot disentitle him to claim his seniority over the appellant for\nconsideration by the respondent-Union.\n\n When the aforesaid facts are taken into consideration, it would be\nobvious that the preparation of seniority list per se was illegal. Therefore,\nthe mere fact that he did not challenge the seniority list, which was\nillegally prepared, till he was aggrieved for non-consideration of the claim\nto the post of accountant, his legitimate right to be considered cannot be\ndenied. Under these circumstances, the delay is of no consequence for\nconsidering the claims of Ashok Kumar for the post of accountant..\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n As shall be detailed hereinafter, the select list dated\n01.08.2011, providing reservation in promotion, was prepared by\nthe Railways without gathering data, and even without formation\nof opinion on the parameters stipulated in M.Nagaraj1. Having\nacting illegally in preparing the select list dated 01.08.2011, the\nRailways cannot be heard to contend that a belated challenge to\ntheir illegal act should not have been entertained by the Tribunal.\n\nIII. WERE THE O.As, FILED BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL, LIABLE \n TO BE DISMISSED FOR NON-JOINDER OF NECESSARY \n PARTIES?\n\n It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the affected\ncandidates have not been impleaded as party respondents to the\nO.As; their selection, based on the select list dated 01.08.2011,\ncannot therefore be set aside; the O.As ought to have been\ndismissed by the Tribunal for non-joinder of necessary parties; and\nthe Tribunal had erred in entertaining the O.As, and in granting\nrelief, in the absence of those Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes employees, whose names were included in the select list,\nbeing arrayed as respondents in the O.As filed before the Tribunal.\n\n On the other hand it is contended, on behalf of the\nrespondents (applicants in the O.As filed before the Tribunal), that\nthe action of the Railways, in providing reservation in promotion\nwithout undertaking the exercise of identifying backwardness,\nexamining whether or not efficiency in administration would be\neffected thereby, and whether members of the Scheduled Castes \nand Scheduled Tribes were adequately represented, was under \n\nchallenge in the O.As filed before the Tribunal; the law declared by\nthe Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, required the Railways to\nprovide reservation in promotion only after obtaining necessary\ndata and on satisfying itself, on the basis of such data, that these\nparameters were satisfied; consequently the Railways could have\nprovided reservations in promotion, in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes, only after undertaking such an\nexercise; as the Railways have not gathered data, which is the pre-\nrequisite for providing reservation in promotion for the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes, their action in operating the\nselect list dated 01.08.2011, and thereby providing reservation in\npromotion, was under challenge in the O.As; the promotions, given\nto any particular member of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, whose name was included in the select list was\nnot under challenge in the O.As filed before the Tribunal; as such,\nthe only necessary party was the the Railways, which has been\narrayed as a respondent in all the O.As; persons, whose names are\nfound in the select list, are not necessary parties to the O.As.\nwherein the challenge is to the action of the Railways in providing\nreservation in promotion; and the contention, of non-joinder of\nnecessary parties, necessitates rejection.\n\n In Prashant Ramesh Chakkarwar v. UPSC , the Supreme \nCourt held that the High Court did not commit any error by non-\nsuiting the petitioners, on the ground of non-impleadment of the\nselected candidates as parties to the original applications and the\nwrit petitions; if the methodology of moderation adopted by the\nCommission was faulted, the entire selection would have to be\nquashed; and that was not possible without giving an opportunity\nof hearing to those who had been selected and appointed in\ndifferent cadres. \nIn \nState of Rajasthan v. Ucchab Lal\nChhanwal\n , the Supreme Court held that, on a perusal of the writ\npetition, it was noticed that there were specific averments that\njuniors in the gradation list had been promoted; they had not been\narrayed as parties; in the event, the order passed by the High\nCourt was affirmed, persons who were seniors to the respondents\nin the promotional cadre were bound to become juniors, regard\nbeing had to their seniority position in the feeder cadre; no order,\nthat would adversely affect him, could be passed behind the back\nof the person; and such an order, if passed, is in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice, and is liable to be ignored as not\nbinding on such a party.\n \n(Ucchab Lal Chhanwal37; \nJ.S. Yadav v.\nState of U.P.\n ).\n\n \nIf a person challenges the selection process, successful\ncandidates or at least some of them are necessary parties. (Ucchab\nLal Chhanwal37; \nPrabodh Verma v. State of U.P.\n ; \nTridip Kumar\nDingal v. State of W.B.\n ). In the O.As filed by the respondents-\napplicants before the Tribunal, some of the persons whose names\nwere included in the select list, even if not all of them, were\narrayed as respondents.\n\n \nThe order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad\nBench in O.A.No.203 of 2013 and O.A.Nos.1417 and 1433 of 2012, \nis under challenge in W.P.No.39158 of 2013. The respondents in\nO.A.No.1433 of 2012 are the Union of India represented by the\nSecretary (Establishment), Ministry of Railways; the General\nManager, South Central Railway; the Divisional Railway Manager,\nSouth Central Railway; and respondents 4 to 18, the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes who were extended \nthe benefit of reservation in promotion. The relief sought for in the\nsaid O.A. is to call for the records in Memo dated 04.12.2012,\npertaining to the selection for the post of Passenger Guard/Senior\nPassenger Guard, in following the principles of reservation in\npromotion, and on own merit, in respect of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes employees who were the erstwhile \njuniors to the applicants, as illegal and in violation of the law\nsettled by the Supreme Court (ie the judgment of the Constitution\nBench of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1). While a\nconsequential direction is also sought, among others, that the\napplicants also be promoted, the challenge in the O.As are mainly\nto the action of the Railways in providing reservation in promotion\nwithout fulfilling the parameters \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court\nin M. Nagaraj1.\n\n The order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad\nBench, in O.A.No.020/00125/2014 dated 01.01.2015, is under \nchallenge in W.P.No.775 of 2015. The respondents in\nO.A.No.020/00125/2014 are the Union of India represented by the\nSecretary (Establishment), Ministry of Railways; the General\nManager, South Central Railway; the Chief Personnel Officer,\nSouth Central Railway; the Senior Divisional Personnel Officer,\nSouth Central Railway; and respondents 5 to 15, the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes who were extended \nthe benefit of reservation in promotion. The relief sought for in the\nsaid O.A. is to declare that the permission accorded by the Railway\nBoard, to extend the currency of the panel vide letter dated\n\n22.01.2014, cannot be applied to the select list for the post of Loco\nPilot (Goods) as it is illegal and arbitrary; to quash and set aside\nthe select list dated 01.08.2011 from Sl.No.207 to 259; and to\ndirect the official respondents to finalise the promotion/selection\nafter collecting necessary data in accordance with the pre-\nconditions \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court (ie in the Constitution\nBench judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1).\n\n \nIn cases where the validity of policy decisions are impeached,\non the ground of their being violative of Constitutional provisions,\nsuch proceedings are analogous to those in which the\nconstitutionality of a statutory rule is assailed. In such\nproceedings the necessary parties to be impleaded are those\nagainst whom the relief is sought, and in whose absence no\neffective decision can be rendered by the Court. In the present\ncase, the relief is claimed only against the Railways and their\naction, in providing reservations in promotion in favour of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes without fulfilling the\nparameters prescribed for the exercise of the enabling power under\n\nArticles 16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n, has been subjected to challenge. In all\nthe O.As the Ministry of Railways and their representatives have\nbeen arrayed as respondents. The employees, who are likely to be\naffected as a result, are, at the most, proper parties and not\nnecessary parties, and the non-joinder of all of them would not be\nfatal to the O.As filed before the Tribunal. (GM, South Central\nRly. v. A.V.R. Siddhantti ). As relief is sought only against the\nMinistry of Railways and their representatives, even if technically\nall the promoted employees are not before the court, the petition is\nnot liable to fail on that ground. (\nA. Janardhana v. Union of\nIndia\n ; A.V.R. Siddhantti41).\n\nIV. HAS THE RAILWAYS FULFILLED THE PARAMETERS, \n STIPULATED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN M.NAGARAJ, \n BEFORE PROVIDING RESERVATION IN PROMOTION? \n\n Before examining the submission, urged on behalf of the\nRailways, that reservation in promotion is justified as the\nparameters prescribed in M. Nagaraj1 are satisfied, it is useful to\nbriefly refer to the circumstances in which the Constitution was\namended by the insertion of \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n and the\nproviso to \nArticle 335\n, and to the law declared by the Supreme\nCourt in M. Nagaraj1 regarding the circumstances in which the\nState could exercise its enabling power under \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and\n\n16(4-B)\n to provide reservation in promotion, and to extend the\nbenefit of consequential seniority, in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes. \n\n The concept of reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n is hedged by\nthree constitutional requirements, namely, backwardness of a\nclass, inadequacy of representation in public employment of that\nclass and its effect on the overall efficiency in administration. If the\nextent of reservation is excessive, it then makes inroads into the\nprinciple of equality under \nArticle 16(1).\n Backwardness and\ninadequacy of representation are compelling reasons for the State\nto provide representation in public employment. If, in a given case,\nthe court finds excessive reservation under the enactment/rules\nthen such an enactment/rule would be liable to be struck down\nsince it would amount to derogation of the constitutional\nrequirements. (M. Nagaraj1).\n\n \nPrior to the judgment of the Supreme Court in \nIndra\nSawhney v. Union of India\n , reservation in promotion existed. In\nIndra Sawhney43, the Supreme Court held that reservation in\nappointments or posts under \nArticle 16(4)\n is confined to the initial\nappointment, and does not extend to reservation in matters of\npromotion. The Union Government was of the view that the\njudgment, in Indra Sawhney43, adversely affected the interests of\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services, and\nfelt it necessary to continue the existing policy of providing\nreservation in promotion, confining it to Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes alone. Clause (4-A) was inserted after clause (4)\nof \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution. (M. Nagaraj1). \nArticle 16(4A)\n of\nthe Constitution of India, introduced by the Constitution Seventy-\nseventh Amendment Act, 1995 with effect from 17.06.1995, read \nthus:\n\n Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision\nfor reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the\nservices under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State.\n\n \nBy the Constitution Eighty-first Amendment Act, 2000\n,\n\nArticle 16(4B)\n was introduced in the Constitution. \nArticles 16(4B)\n\nreads thus:\n\n Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from considering any\nunfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year\nin\naccordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause\n(4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or\nyears and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the\nvacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the\nceiling\nof fifty per cent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year.\n\n \nBy the Constitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000\n, a\nproviso was inserted to \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution. After its\namendment, \nArticle 335\n and its proviso read thus:\n\n Claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to services and \npostsThe claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled \nTribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of\nefficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and\nposts\nin connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State:\n\n Provided that noting in this article shall prevent in making of any\nprovision in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes for relaxation in qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the\nstandards of evaluation, for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or\nclasses of services or posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a\nState.\n\n \nArticle 16(4A)\n, which was inserted by the \nConstitution\nSeventy-seventh Amendment Act, 1995\n, was amended by the \n\nConstitution Eighty-fifth Amendment Act, 2001\n with retrospective\neffect from 17.6.1995, and the words with consequential seniority,\nwas inserted in \nArticles 16(4A)\n between the words provision for\nreservation in matters of promotion and to any class or classes of posts in\nthe services under the State. After its amendment \nArticle 16(4A)\n reads\nthus:-\n\n Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any\nprovision\nfor reservation in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any\nclass or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State,\nare not adequately represented in the services under the State.\n\n \nIn M. Nagaraj1, the validity, the interpretation, and the\nimplementation of the \nConstitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) \nAct, 1995\n, the \nConstitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000\n,\nthe \nConstitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000\n, and the \n\nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n was under\nchallenge. In addition, the Supreme Court was called upon to\nexamine whether the action taken pursuant thereto, which sought\nto reverse with retrospective effect the decisions of the Supreme\nCourt in matters relating to promotion was valid; and whether, by\nvirtue of the aforesaid constitutional amendments, the power of\nParliament under \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and (4-B) was so enlarged as to\nobliterate any or all the limitations of \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n335\n of the\nConstitution. While upholding the validity of the aforesaid\namendments, the Supreme Court held that \nArticle 16(4-A)\n is\nconfined to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes; as\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n flow from \nArticle 16(4)\n, and since\n\nArticle 16(4)\n is an enabling provision, \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n\nare also enabling provisions; as the constitutional amendments, by\nwhich \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n were inserted, flowed from\n\nArticle 16(4)\n they did not alter its structure; the boundaries of the\nwidth of the power under \nArticle 16(4)\n were not obliterated by, and\nwere retained in, \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B);\n when the State fails\nto identify and implement the controlling factors then\nexcessiveness comes in; \nArticle 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n retain the\ncontrolling factors or the compelling reasons, namely,\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation which enables the \nStates to provide reservation keeping in mind the overall efficiency\nof the State administration under \nArticle 335;\n they do not also\nobliterate the constitutional requirements, namely, ceiling limit of\n50% (quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy layer\n(qualitative exclusion), the sub-classification between OBCs on the\none hand and SCs and STs on the other as held in Indra\nSawhney43, and the concept of post-based roster, with inbuilt\nconcept of replacement, as held in \nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab\n ; whether reservation, in a given case, is desirable as a\npolicy or not, is not for Courts to decide as long as the parameters\nmentioned in \nArticles 16(4)\n and \n16(4-A)\n are maintained; equity,\njustice and merit (\nArticle 335\n)/efficiency are variables which can\nonly be identified and measured by the State; the discretion of the\nState, in providing reservation under the enabling provisions of\n\nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4-A)\n of the Constitution, is subject to\nthe existence of backwardness and inadequacy of\nrepresentation in public employment; backwardness must be \nbased on objective factors, and inadequacy should factually exist;\nthough vesting of the power, by the enabling provisions of\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\n and (4-B), is constitutionally valid, yet exercise of\nthe power by the State, in a given case, may be arbitrary,\nparticularly if the State fails to identify and measure backwardness\nand inadequacy keeping in mind the efficiency of service as\nrequired under \nArticle 335;\n the concepts of efficiency,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation are required to be\nidentified and measured; that exercise depends on availability of\ndata, and on numerous factors; if the State has quantifiable data\nto show backwardness and inadequacy, it can then make \nreservations in promotions keeping in mind maintenance of\nefficiency which is a constitutional limitation on the discretion of\nthe State as indicated by \nArticle 335;\n as \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-\nB)\n are enabling provisions, the State is not bound to make\nreservation for SCs/STs in matters of promotion; however, if they\nwish to exercise their discretion and make such provision, the\nState has to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the\nclass, and inadequacy of representation of that class in public\nemployment, in addition to compliance with \nArticle 335;\n and, even\nif the State has compelling reasons, it must ensure that its\nreservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to\nbreach the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or\nextend the reservation indefinitely.\n\n There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure the three\nvariable factors of equity, justice and efficiency. If the concerned\nState fails to identify and measure backwardness, inadequacy and\noverall administrative efficiency then, in that event, the provision\nfor reservation would be invalid. (M. Nagaraj1). The question,\nwhether the concerned State has identified and valued the\ncircumstances justifying its making reservation, must be decided\non the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court must be\nsatisfied, in each case, that the State has exercised its opinion in\nmaking reservation in promotions for SCs and STs, for which the\nconcerned State should place the requisite quantifiable data, and\nsatisfy the Court that such reservation has become necessary on\naccount of inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs in a particular\nclass or classes of posts without affecting the general efficiency of\nservice as mandated under \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution. With\nregards the extent of reservation, the State will have to show, in\neach case, the existence of the compelling reasons, namely,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall\nadministrative efficiency before making provision for reservation. If,\nin a given case, the court finds excessive reservation under a State\nenactment, then such an enactment would be liable to be struck\ndown since it would amount to derogation of the constitutional\nrequirements. (M. Nagaraj1).\n\n Bearing these aspects in mind, let us now examine whether \nthe petitioner-Railways is justified in its submission that the\nreservation provided by them, in favour of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes for promotion to higher posts, satisfies\nthe parameters \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1.\n\n In the affidavit filed in support of W.P. No.39158 of 2013, by\nthe Union of India and the South Central Railway, it is stated that,\nfrom out of the total sanctioned posts, posts were reserved in\npromotions considering 15% and 7.5% representation for the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes; the backlog unfilled\nposts, which were reserved for the Scheduled Tribes was 1941,\nwhich showed that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes \nwere not adequately represented in promotional categories;\nreservation in promotions was, therefore, justified; quantified data\nwas obtained, with regards adequacy of representation of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the cadre of\npassenger guards, before the select list was finalised; the same was\nincorporated by the Railways in the counter filed by them before\nthe Tribunal; the table extracted in the counter showed that, as\nagainst the reservation prescribed for the Scheduled Castes at 15%\nand for the Scheduled Tribes at 7.5%, the existing staff, belonging\nto these two categories, were lower than the number of posts\nrequired to be provided if reservation, of the aforesaid percentage,\nwas to be adhered to; and, considering the 15% and 7.5% \nreservation required to be provided in their favour, the data\nshowed that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes were \nnot adequately represented in the cadre of passenger guards.\n\n With regards backwardness and efficiency in administration,\nit is stated that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\nform a separate class by themselves, and are construed to be\nbackward communities; the Constitution 82nd Amendment Act \nprovided that nothing in the Article shall prevent, in making any\nprovision in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and\nthe Scheduled Tribes, relaxation in qualifying marks in any\nexamination or lowering the standards in so far as evaluation for\nreservation, in matters of promotion to any class or classes of\nservice of posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or the\nState, was concerned; in the instant case, as the post of passenger\nguards was a safety category post, no relaxation whatsoever, as\nenshrined in the Article, had been provided in the Selection in\nquestion; as the aforesaid twin requirements, for providing\nreservations, were complied with, the rights of the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes, for reservation in promotion, was\nprotected by the Constitutional Amendments. \n\n Even in their counter, filed before the Tribunal, the Railways\ncontended that, in terms of the Railway Boards circular dated\n29.01.2009, it was clarified that the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\nTribes who had been promoted, during the period from 07.08.2002\nto 06.05.2005, by the non-selection method by virtue of their\nseniority in the feeder grade or otherwise, in excess of the\nreservation quota were to be adjusted against the reserved\nvacancies arising in future; by its Circular dated 01.09.2010, the\nRailway Board had clarified that members of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes, appointed by promotion on their own\nmerit and seniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\nqualifications, were required to be adjusted against the unreserved\npoints of the reservation roster, irrespective of whether the\npromotion was made by the selection or the non-selection method;\nthese orders were made with effect from 21.08.1997 i.e., the date\nfrom which post based roster was introduced in the Railways;\nhowever staff, promoted prior to issuance of the said circulars,\nwere required to be reverted; the short fall in the categories of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, if any, was required to be\nmade good through vacancies arising in future.\n\n The counter, filed by the Railways before the Tribunal,\nfurther details the reservation required to be provided for the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes at 15% and 7.5% \nrespectively. It then takes note of the existing staff in the reserved\ncategory, to conclude that, as the existing staff fall short of the\nrequired number of posts to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes, vacancies still exist which are required\nto be filled up. Reference is also made to the Departmental of\nPersonnel and Training, Union of India O.M. dated 29.09.2007,\nand the earlier O.M. dated 29.05.2007 circulated by the Railway\nBoard. It is further stated that, in terms of the Railway Boards\ninstructions issued in proceedings dated 01.09.2010 and\n20.06.2003, employees belonging to SC/ST category, appointed by \npromotion on their own merit and seniority and not owing to\nreservation or relaxation of qualifications, were required to be\nadjusted against the unreserved points of the reservation roster,\nirrespective of whether promotion was made by selection or non-\nselection method. Reliance is also placed on the DOP&T circular\ndated 29.03.2007 in this regard.\n\n Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n gives freedom to the State to\nprovide for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or\nclasses of posts in the services of the State. \nArticle 16(4-A)\n is\ngoverned by two compelling reasons backwardness and \ninadequacy of representation, as mentioned in \nArticle 16(4).\n In\nevery case where the State decides to provide for reservation in\npromotion, there must exist two circumstances, namely,\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation. The State\nmust form its opinion on gathering quantifiable data in this regard.\nIf these two reasons do not exist, then the enabling provision\ncannot be enforced. The State can make provision for reservation\nonly if these two circumstances exist. (M. Nagaraj1). Apart from\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation the State\nshould also keep in mind overall efficiency (\nArticle 335\n). All the\nthree factors should be borne in mind, by the appropriate\nGovernment, in providing for reservation in promotion for SCs and\nSTs. (M. Nagaraj1; Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab ).\n\n The law declared by the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1,\nrequires the State to identify and measure the existence of\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation in public\nemployment, keeping in mind the need to maintain overall\nefficiency in administration. It is only if the State has quantifiable\ndata to show backwardness and inadequacy of representation,\ncan it then provide reservation in promotion, that too after taking\ninto consideration the effect of reservation on the overall efficiency\nin administration. The exercise of gathering the necessary data\nmust precede the exercise of formation of opinion on the need to\nprovide reservation in promotion; and the exercise of formation of\nopinion must precede a decision being taken to provide\nreservation. A post-decision justification, that too in the counter\nfiled before the Tribunal or in the Writ Petition filed before this\nCourt, would not suffice. The petitioner-Railways should have\nplaced before the Tribunal, the quantifiable data, if any, gathered\nby it before making provision for reservation, to show the existence\nof compelling reasons (ie (1) backwardness, (2) inadequacy of\nrepresentation, and (3) overall administrative efficiency) to provide\nreservation.\n\n As reliance is placed thereupon by the Learned Standing\nCounsel for the Railways, it is also necessary to refer to the\ncirculars, issued by the DOPT and the Railways, subsequent to the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1. By their memo \ndated 21.06.2007, the Southern Railway circulated a copy of the\nRailway Boards letter dated 29.05.2007, along with a copy of the\nletter issued by the DOPT, Govt. of India dated 29.03.2007. The\nRailways circular dated 29.05.2007, refers to the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, and to the DOPT circular dated\n29.03.2007, to state that the DOP&T had advised that reference to\ncreamy layer, in the concluding paragraph and the other portions\nof the judgment in M. Nagaraj1, did not relate to the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes; the DOPT had, in consultation\nwith the law officers of the Government, examined whether the\njudgment in M. Nagaraj1 introduced the concept of creamy layer\nfor the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes; they had been \nadvised that the observations made in M. Nagaraj1, regarding\ncreamy layer amongst the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled \nTribes, were mere obiter dicta, per incurium and to not flow from,\nand cannot be reconciled with, the nine judge bench judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney43; and the reference to\ncreamy layer, in the concluding paragraph and other portions of\nthe judgment, did not relate to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes.\n\n In its circular dated 29.02.2008, the Railway Board, after\nreferring to the judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1,\nobserved that, in the light of the said judgment, the seniority of the\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes railway servants, promoted by \nvirtue of the rule of reservation/roster, should be regulated in\nterms of the instructions contained in the Boards letters dated\n08.03.2002 and 13.01.2005 whereby it was directed that railway\nservants, on their promotion by virtue of the rule of\nreservation/roster, were entitled to consequential seniority also.\nBy its proceedings dated 10.08.2010, the DOPT, Government of \nIndia clarified that the members of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, appointed by promotion on their own merit and\nseniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\nqualifications, would be adjusted against unreserved points of the\nreservation roster, irrespective of whether promotion was made by\nthe selection method or the non-selection method; and these\norders would take effect from 02.07.1997 i.e., the date of which the\npost based reservation was introduced.\n\n None of these circulars deal specifically with the parameters\nrequired to be satisfied before the enabling power, under \nArticle\n16(4A)\n and \n16(4B)\n of the Constitution of India, can be exercised to\nprovide reservation in promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes. The fact that the Union Government\ndid not find it convenient to gather data, with regards the\nparameters laid down in M. Nagaraj1, is evident from their\nendeavour to have \nArticle 16(4A)\n of the Constitution amended. By\nthe Constitution (One Hundred Seventeenth Amendment) Bill, \n2012, \nArticle 16(4-A)\n was sought to be substituted by the following\nclause, namely: \n\n(4A) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in the Constitution, the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes notified under \nArticle 341\n and\n\nArticle 342\n, respectively, shall be deemed to be backward and nothing in this\nArticle or in \nArticle 335\n shall prevent the State from making any provision for\nreservation in matters of promotions, with consequential seniority, to any class\nor classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes to the extent of the percentage of reservation\nprovided to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the services of the\nState..\n\n The statement of objects and reasons for the said Bill\nprovides that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have\nbeen provided reservation in promotions since 1955; this was\ndiscontinued following the judgment in Indra Sawhney43, wherein\nit was held that it was beyond the mandate of \nArticle 16(4)\n of the\nConstitution of India; subsequently, the Constitution was amended\nby the \nConstitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995\n and a \nnew clause (4A) was inserted in \nArticle 16\n to enable the\nGovernment to provide reservation in promotion in favour of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes; subsequently, clause \n(4A) of \nArticle 16\n was modified by the \nConstitution (Eighty-fifth\nAmendment) Act, 2001\n to provide consequential seniority to the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes candidates promoted \nby giving reservation; the validity of the constitutional amendments\nwas challenged before the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court, \nwhile deliberating on the issue of validity of Constitutional\namendments in the case of M. Nagaraj1, observed that the\nconcerned State will have to show in each case the existence of\ncompelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of \nrepresentation and overall administrative efficiency, before making\nprovision for reservation in promotion; relying on the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, the High Court of Rajasthan\nand the High Court of Allahabad had struck down the provisions\nfor reservation in promotion in the services of the State of\nRajasthan and the State of Uttar Pradesh, respectively;\nsubsequently, the Supreme Court had upheld the decisions of\nthese High Courts striking down the provisions for reservation in\nrespective States; it had been observed that there was difficulty in\ncollection of quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class\nand inadequacy of representation of that class in public\nemployment; moreover, there was uncertainty on the methodology \nof this exercise; in the wake of the judgment of the Supreme Court\nin M. Nagaraj1, the prospects of promotion of the employees,\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, were \nbeing adversely affected; demands for carrying out further\namendment in the Constitution were raised by various quarters; a\ndiscussion on the issue of reservation in promotion was held in\nParliament on 3.5.2012; demand for amendment of the \nConstitution, in order to provide reservation for the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes in promotion, had been voiced by\nMembers of Parliament; an All-Party Meeting to discuss the issue\nwas held on 21-08-2012; there was a general consensus to carry\nout an amendment in the Constitution, so as to enable the State to\ncontinue the scheme of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes as it existed since 1995; in view\nof the above, the Government had reviewed the position, and had\ndecided to move the constitutional amendment to substitute clause\n(4A) of \nArticle 16\n, with a view to provide impediment-free\nreservation in promotion to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, and to bring certainty and clarity in the matter;\nand it was also necessary to give retrospective effect to the\nproposed clause (4A) of \nArticle 16\n with effect from the date of\ncoming into force of that clause as originally introduced, ie from\nthe 17th day of June, 1995.\n\n Even though \nArticle 16(4-A)\n has not yet been amended, as\nwas sought to be done by the Constitution (One hundred and \nseventeenth amendment) Bill, 2012, the DOPT, Government of \nIndia, by its proceedings dated 07.01.2014, informed the Union\nPublic Service Commission that, in view of the judgment of the\nHigh Court of Rajastan and Uttar Pradesh striking down\nreservation in promotion by the respective State Governments, and\nkeeping in view the observations of the Supreme Court in M.\nNagaraj1, it was decided by the Government of India to bring the\nConstitutional Amendment Bill, by suitably changing \nArticle\n16(4A)\n, to do away with the conditions laid down in M. Nagaraj1;\nthe constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha \nin 2012, and was pending consideration before the Lok Sabha;\nsince the Government of India had taken an in-principle decision\nto continue reservation in promotion by bringing the constitutional\namendment bill, which had already been passed by the Rajya \nSabha, it would be appropriate to continue the existing practice of\ncontinuation of reservation in promotion, as per the existing\nprocedure adopted by the Departmental Promotional committees. \nThe Union Public Service Commission was requested to take \nfurther necessary action accordingly. It is evident, therefore, that\nthe parameters laid down in M. Nagaraj1, as conditions precedent\nfor the exercise of the enabling power under \nArticle 16(4-A)\n, to\nprovide reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, have not been fulfilled till date.\nV. JUDGMENTS OF THE SUPREME COURT ON WHICH \n RELIANCE IS PLACED BY COUNSEL ON EITHER SIDE: \n\n As Learned Counsel on either side have referred to several\njudgments of the Supreme Court, it is necessary to note what has\nbeen declared therein. \nIn \nS.V. Joshi v. State of Karnataka\n , the\nSupreme Court held that \nArticles 15\n and \n16\n of the Constitution\nhad been amended by the \nConstitution (Ninety-third Amendment) \nAct, 2005\n, and the \nConstitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act,\n2000\n, respectively; these Amendment Acts were the subject-matter \nof the subsequent decisions in \nM. Nagaraj1 and Ashoka Kumar \nThakur v. Union of India\n in which, inter alia, it had been laid\ndown that, if a State wanted to exceed fifty per cent reservation, it\nwas then required to base its decision on quantifiable data; in the\ncase before it, this exercise had not been done; and keeping in\nmind the said parameters, the State should place quantifiable data\nbefore the Tamil Nadu State Backward Classes Commission and, \non the basis of such quantifiable data amongst other things, the\nCommission should decide the quantum of reservation.\n\n \nIn Suraj Bhan Meena2, it was contended that, in the\nabsence of any data in relation to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes, the parameters \nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1 were\nnot fulfilled; Rule 33 of the Rajasthan Administrative Service\nRules, 1954, providing for consequential seniority, was\nunconstitutional as no exercise had been undertaken by the State\npursuant to \nArticle 16(4-A)\n of the Constitution; and since the State\ndid not undertake the exercise, which was mandatory in terms of\nthe judgment in M. Nagaraj1, the State could not, either directly or\nindirectly, circumvent or ignore or refuse to undertake the exercise\nby taking recourse to the \nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment)\nAct\n providing for reservation in promotion with consequential\nseniority. It is in this context that the Supreme Court observed\nthat, in M. Nagaraj1, the Constitution Bench had held that the\nState was not bound to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and \nthe Scheduled Tribes candidates in matters of promotion but, if it\nwished, it could collect quantifiable data touching upon the\nbackwardness of the applicants, and inadequacy of representation\nof that class in public employment, for the purpose of compliance\nwith \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution; and in order to provide for\nreservation, if at all, the tests indicated in \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and\n\n16(4-B)\n would have to be satisfied, which could only be achieved\nafter an inquiry as to identity.\n\n The Supreme Court, in Suraj Bhan Meena2, further held\nthat the position, after the decision in M. Nagaraj1, was that\nreservation in promotion was dependent on the inadequacy of\nrepresentation of members of the Scheduled Castes and the \nScheduled Tribes and Backward Classes; it was subject to the\ncondition of ascertaining whether such reservation was at all\nrequired; the view of the Rajasthan High Court, which was under\n\nchallenge before it, was based on the decision in M. Nagaraj1 as no\nexercise was undertaken in terms of \nArticle 16(4-A)\n to acquire\nquantifiable data regarding the inadequacy of representation of the\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in public \nservices; and the Rajasthan High Court had rightly quashed the\nnotifications issued by the State of Rajasthan providing for\nconsequential seniority and promotion to members of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. \n\n In Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited3 it was\ncontended, both on behalf of the State Government and the U.P.\nPower Corporation, that once the principle of reservation was made\napplicable to the spectrum of promotion, no fresh exercise was\nnecessary; and efficiency in service was not jeopardised. It is in\nthis context that the Supreme Court held:-\n\n We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj1 is a categorical imperative.\nThe stand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated the\nreservation in promotion with consequential seniority and have given the\nstamp of approval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close scrutiny\nin as much as the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that \nArticles 16(4-\nA)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are enabling provisions and the State can make provisions\nfor the same on certain basis or foundation. The conditions precedent have\nnot been satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What has been argued \nwith vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept of reservation in\npromotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept the said\nsubmission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are treated valid\nwith certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on the part of the\nState to appreciate and apply the test so that its amendments can be\ntested and withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid down therein..\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n In Chairman and Managing Director, Central Bank of\nIndia v. Central Bank of India SC/ST Employees Welfare\nAssociation , the order of the Madras High Court, holding that\nthe O.M. dated 13.08.1997 made a provision for reservation in\nfavour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, was\nunder challenge before the Supreme Court. After referring to the\nConstitution Bench judgment in M.Nagaraj1, the Supreme Court \nobserved that clauses (4) and (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution\nare only enabling provisions which permit the State to make\nprovision for reservation of certain categories of persons;\nreservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts\ncan be made in favour of SC/ST category employees if, in the\nopinion of the State, they are not adequately represented in\nservices under the State; the power lies with the State to make\nsuch a provision, but the Courts cannot issue any mandamus to \nthe State to, necessarily, make such a provision; it is for the State\nto act, in a given situation, and to take such affirmative action;\nwherever there exists such a provision, for reservation in matters\nof recruitment or promotion, it would bestow an enforceable right\nin favour of persons belonging to the SC/ST category; failure on\nthe part of any authority to reserve the posts, while making\nselections/ promotions, would enable the beneficiaries of these\nprovisions to approach the Courts to get their rights enforced; and\nexistence of a provision for reservation, in matters of selection or\npromotion as the case may be, is the sine qua non for seeking a\nmandamus as only when such a provision is made by the State, a \nright accrues in favour of SC/ST candidates, and not otherwise.\n The question whether the State could provide reservation in\nmatters of promotion, without gathering data and forming its\nopinion on the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in\nM.Nagaraj1, did not arise for consideration in Central Bank of\nIndia48. Nor were the earlier judgments of the Supreme Court in\nSuraj Bhan Meena2 and Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation \nLimited3 noticed therein. It is only if the parameters laid down in\nM.Nagaraj1 are satisfied and a provision is made for reservation in\npromotions in favour of the SCs/STs thereafter, would it confer an\nenforceable right in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes to claim the benefit of reservation in\npromotions, and not otherwise. Reliance placed by the petitioners,\non Central Bank of India48, is, therefore, misplaced.\n The Supreme Court, in Suraj Bhan Meena2 and Uttar Pradesh \nPower Corporation Limited3, have followed and reiterated the law\ndeclared in M. Nagaraj1. It is no doubt true that the rules made by\nthe Government were under challenge therein. It is also true that\nthe Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, did not examine the validity of\nindividual State enactments, and held that the question would be\ngone into, in individual writ petitions, by the appropriate Bench in\naccordance with the law laid down in the said judgment. In the\npresent case, the Railways have only been following the policy, of\nproviding reservation in promotion, which were in existence even\nprior to the judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1. As the\nRailways was required to gather data, and form its opinion before\nproviding reservation, continuance of the earlier policy of\nreservation in promotion, without undertaking the exercise of\ngathering data and formation of opinion, is illegal.\nVI. IS NOTIFICATION OF THE SCHEDULED CASTES AND THE \n SCHEDULED TRIBES, BY THE PRESIDENTIAL ORDER \n MADE UNDER \nARTICLES 341\n AND \n342\n OF THE \n CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, NOT SUFFICIENT PROOF OF \n THEIR BACKWARDNESS? \n\n It is also contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the\nvery fact that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are\nnotified in the Presidential Order, under \nArticles 341\n and \n342\n of\nthe Constitution, is proof of their backwardness. Similar\ncontentions did not find favour with the Supreme Court. In Uttar\nPradesh Power Corporation Limited3, it was contended, on \nbehalf of the appellants, that once an incumbent belongs to the\nScheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe category, it is conclusive that he\nsuffers from backwardness and no further enquiry is necessary;\nthe requirement of having quantifiable data is not a new concept\npropounded in M. Nagaraj1, but is a reiteration of the earlier view\nenunciated in Indra Sawhney43; the emphasis on backwardness is \nabsolutely misconceived, for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes \nare duly notified as such in the Presidential List by virtue of\n\nArticles 341\n and \n342\n of the Constitution; their exclusion from the\nlist can be done by the amendment of the Presidential Order alone;\nhence, any kind of collection of data as regards backwardness is\nan exercise in futility; there is only one list of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes, and this list constitutes one group for\nthe purpose of reservation; this list cannot be interfered with,\ndisturbed, regrouped or reclassified by the State; there may not be\nexclusion by engrafting the principle of backwardness for the\npurpose of reservation in promotion; data was immediately\ncollected after the 1994 Act; therefore no fresh data was necessary\nto be collected after the decision rendered by the Constitution\nBench in M. Nagaraj1; the efficiency of service, as encapsuled in\n\nArticle 335\n of the Constitution, has been duly respected by\nproviding a uniform minimum standard in matters of promotion as\nfar as the Corporation is concerned; when there was no challenge\nto the orders, issued prior to the amendment for reservation in\npromotion, no quantifiable data was necessary; the Government, in\nits wisdom, had carried out the assessment earlier, and had\ndecided to continue the policy; to lay down the principle that, in\nview of the decision in M. Nagaraj1, a fresh exercise is necessary\nwould tantamount to putting the concept in the realm of inherent\nfallacy; the decision in Suraj Bhan Meena2 is not a binding\nprecedent; the intention of Parliament, at the time of exercise of its\nconstitutional power to give retrospective effect to the Eighty-fifth\namendment, is that the representation of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes in the services in the States has not\nreached the required level, and it is necessary to continue the\nexisting position of providing reservation in promotion in the case\nof Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes; and M. Nagaraj1 does not \nlay down that the quantifiable data of backwardness should be\ncollected with respect to eligible Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe\nemployees seeking promotion. It is in this context that the\nSupreme Court held:- \n\n . from the aforesaid decision in M. Nagaraj case1 and the\nparagraphs we have quoted hereinabove, the following principles can be\ncarved out:\n\n (i) Vesting of the power by an enabling provision may be\nconstitutionally valid and yet exercise of power by the State in a\ngiven case may be arbitrary, particularly, if the State fails to identify\nand measure the backwardness and inadequacy keeping in mind the \nefficiency of service as required under \nArticle 335.\n\n (ii) \nArticle 16(4)\n which protects the interests of certain sections of the\nsociety has to be balanced against \nArticle 16(1)\n which protects the interests\nof every citizen of the entire society. They should be harmonised because\nthey are restatements of the principle of equality under \nArticle 14.\n\n (iii) Each post gets marked for the particular category of candidates to be\nappointed against it and any subsequent vacancy has to be filled by that\ncategory candidate.\n\n (iv) The appropriate Government has to apply the cadre strength as\na unit in the operation of the roster in order to ascertain whether a\ngiven class/group is adequately represented in the service. The cadre\nstrength as a unit also ensures that the upper ceiling limit of 50% is\nnot violated. Further, roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy\nbased. \n\n (v) The State has to form its opinion on the quantifiable data\nregarding adequacy of representation. Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n is an\nenabling provision. It gives freedom to the State to provide for\nreservation in matters of promotion. Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n applies\nonly to SCs and STs. The said clause is carved out of \nArticle 16(4-A).\n\nTherefore, clause (4-A) will be governed by the two compelling reasons\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation, as mentioned in\n\nArticle 16(4).\n If the said two reasons do not exist, then the enabling\nprovision cannot be enforced.\n\n (vi) If the ceiling limit on the carry over of unfilled vacancies is\nremoved, \nthe other alternative time factor comes in and in that event, the timescale\nhas to be imposed in the interest of efficiency in administration as mandated\nby \nArticle 335.\n If the timescale is not kept, then posts will continue to remain\nvacant for years which would be detrimental to the administration.\nTherefore, in each case, the appropriate Government will now have to\nintroduce the duration depending upon the fact situation.\n\n (vii) If the appropriate Government enacts a law providing for reservation\nwithout keeping in mind the parameters in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 335\n,\nthen this Court will certainly set aside and strike down such legislation.\n\n (viii) The constitutional limitation under \nArticle 335\n is relaxed and not\nobliterated. As stated above, be it reservation or evaluation, excessiveness in\neither would result in violation of the constitutional mandate. This exercise,\nhowever, will depend on the facts of each case.\n\n (ix) The concepts of efficiency, backwardness and inadequacy of\nrepresentation are required to be identified and measured. That\nexercise depends on the availability of data. That exercise depends on\nnumerous factors. It is for this reason that the enabling provisions are\nrequired to be made because each competing claim seeks to achieve \ncertain goals. How best one should optimise these conflicting claims\ncan only be done by the administration in the context of local\nprevailing conditions in public employment.\n\n (x) \nArticle 16(4)\n, therefore, creates a field which enables a State to\nprovide\nfor reservation provided there exists backwardness of a class and inadequacy\nof representation in employment. These are compelling reasons. They do not\nexist in \nArticle 16(1).\n It is only when these reasons are satisfied that a State\ngets the power to provide for reservation in the matter of employment.\n\n In the said Suraj Bhan case21, the State Government had not \nundertaken any exercise as indicated in M. Nagaraj1. The two-Judge Bench \nhas noted three conditions in the said judgment. It was canvassed before\nthe Bench that exercise to be undertaken as per the direction in M.\nNagaraj1 was mandatory and the State cannot, either directly or\nindirectly, circumvent or ignore or refuse to undertake the exercise by\ntaking recourse to the \nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act\n\nproviding for reservation for promotion with consequential seniority. While\ndealing with the contentions, the two-Judge Bench opined that the State is\nrequired to place before the Court the requisite quantifiable data in each\ncase and to satisfy the Court that the said reservation became necessary\non account of inadequacy of representation of the Scheduled Caste and\nScheduled Tribe candidates in a particular class or classes of posts, without\naffecting the general efficiency of service\n We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj1 is a categorical\nimperative. The stand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated\nthe reservation in promotion with consequential seniority and have given\nthe stamp of approval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close\nscrutiny inasmuch as the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are enabling provisions and the State can make\nprovisions for the same on certain basis or foundation. The conditions\nprecedent have not been satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What\nhas been argued with vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept\nof reservation in promotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept\nthe said submission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are\ntreated valid with certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on\nthe part of the State to appreciate and apply the test so that its\namendments can be tested and withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid \ndown therein. . (emphasis supplied).\n\n The law declared by the Supreme Court, in Uttar Pradesh\nPower Corporation Limited3, is binding on this Court and,\nnotwithstanding the persuasive submission made on behalf of the\npetitioners, it is not open to this Court to take a different view.\n\n In Indra Sawhney43 (a nine-judge bench judgment of the\nSupreme Court) it was held that backward classes under \nArticle\n16(4)\n would also include SCs/STs for whose entry into services,\nprovision is also made under \nArticle 335;\n while \nArticle 16(4)\n is\ncouched in an enabling language, \nArticle 335\n is in a mandatory\ncast; it became necessary to make the additional provision of\nreservation for SCs/STs under \nArticle 335\n because for them the\nreservation in services were to be made as obligatory; it is because\nof the mandate of \nArticle 335\n and the level of backwardness of the\nSCs/STs - the most backward among the backward classes - that \nit also became necessary to caution and emphasise in the same \nvein, that the imperative claims of the SCs/STs shall be taken into\nconsideration consistently with the efficiency of the administration,\nand not by sacrificing it; as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes are also the members of the backward classes of citizens,\nwithin the meaning of \nArticle 16(4)\n, the nature of backwardness of\nthe backward class of citizens is implicit in \nArticle 16(4)\n itself;\nClause (4) of \nArticle 15\n specifically mentions that nothing in \nArticle\n15\n, or in clause (2) of \nArticle 29\n, shall prevent the State from\nmaking any special provision for the advancement of any \"socially\nand educationally backward classes of citizens or for the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\"; it groups \"socially and\neducationally backward classes\" with \"Scheduled Castes and \nScheduled Tribes\"; and, when it is remembered that \nArticles 341\n\nand \n342\n enable the President to specify by notification, the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it can hardly be debated \nthat such specifications, from time to time, may only be from the\nsocially and educationally backward classes or from classes whose\neconomic backwardness is on account of their social and\neducational backwardness. \n\n After holding that backwardness and inadequacy of\nrepresentation operate as a justification in the sense that the State\ngets the power to make reservation only if backwardness and\ninadequacy of representation exist, the Supreme Court, in M.\nNagaraj1, held:-\n\n .At this stage, one aspect needs to be mentioned. Social justice is\nconcerned with the distribution of benefits and burdens. The basis of\ndistribution is the area of conflict between rights, needs and means. These\nthree\ncriteria can be put under two concepts of equality, namely, formal equality\nand \nproportional equality. Formal equality means that law treats everyone equal.\nConcept of egalitarian equality is the concept of proportional equality and it\nexpects the States to take affirmative action in favour of disadvantaged\nsections\nof society within the framework of democratic polity. In Indra Sawhney5 all the\nJudges except Pandian, J. held that the means test should be adopted to\nexclude the creamy layer from the protected group earmarked for\nreservation. In Indra Sawhney5 this Court has, therefore, accepted caste\nas a determinant of backwardness and yet it has struck a balance with the\nprinciple of secularism which is the basic feature of the Constitution by\nbringing in the concept of creamy layer. Views have often been expressed\nin this Court that caste should not be the determinant of backwardness\nand that the economic criteria alone should be the determinant of\nbackwardness. As stated above, we are bound by the decision in Indra\nSawhney5. The question as to the determinant of backwardness cannot \nbe gone into by us in view of the binding decision. In addition to the above\nrequirements this Court in Indra Sawhney5 has evolved numerical benchmarks \nlike ceiling limit of 50% based on post-specific roster coupled with the concept\nof\nreplacement to provide immunity against the charge of discrimination. \n (emphasis supplied)\n\n As noted hereinabove, the Constitution Bench, in M. Nagaraj1,\nhas specifically held that the question of determinants of\nbackwardness could not be gone into by them in view of binding\ndecision in Indra Sawhney43. The manner in which\nbackwardness is to be identified is for the Union Government to\ndecide, and the Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, has not stipulated\nthe manner in which backwardness should be determined. As the \nSupreme Court, in Indra Sawhney43, has held that the Scheduled \nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes are the most backward among \nthe backward classes the Railways are not precluded, after\ngathering the required data, from also taking into consideration\nthe law declared by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney43 as \naforementioned, and the Presidential Order issued under \nArticles\n341\n and \n342\n of the Constitution of India, in forming its opinion\nregarding backwardness. Needless to state that the Railways\nwould, in addition, be required to ascertain whether the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes are inadequately represented in the\nRailway services, and to take into consideration maintenance of\nover all efficiency in Railway administration, in forming its opinion\non the need to provide reservation in promotion.\n\nVII. PARITY IN TREATMENT: \n\n \nAs service jurisprudence postulates that all similarly\nsituated persons should be treated similarly, normally, when a\nparticular set of employees are given relief by the Court, all other\nidentically situated persons need to be treated alike by extending\nthat benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination, and\nwould be violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India. The\nnormal rule is that, merely because other similarly situated\npersons did not approach the Court earlier, they are not to be\ntreated differently. This principle is subject to well-recognised\nexceptions in the form of laches and delay as well as acquiescence.\nThose persons, who do not challenge the wrongful action in their\ncases, acquiesce thereto and wake up after a long delay, only\nbecause their counterparts who had approached the court earlier\nhad succeeded in their efforts, cannot claim that the benefit of the\njudgment, rendered in the case of similarly situated persons,\nshould be extended to them. They would be treated as fence-sitters\nand laches and delay, and/or acquiescence, would be a valid\nground to dismiss their claim. However, this exception may not\napply in those cases where the judgment pronounced by the Court \nis a judgment in rem with the intention to give benefit to all\nsimilarly situated persons, whether they had approached the court\nor not. (\nState of U.P. v. Arvind Kumar Srivastava\n ).\n\n \nIn \nG.C. Ghosh v. Union of India\n , the Supreme Court\nheld:-\n\n \n..Reliance has been placed by the petitioners on the decision of\nthe Allahabad High Court in \nUnion of India v. Smt Afsar Jahan Begum\n\nrendered in Special Appeal No. 9 of 1975 on March 12, 1979. The aforesaid\ndecision has been accepted by the Railway Administration in the sense\nthat no special leave petition was preferred in this Court and the matter\nfinally rested there. The petitioners who are employees of Eastern Railway\nhave contended that they are entitled to the same treatment as is being\naccorded to their counterparts in the Northern Railway in pursuance to the\naforesaid decision rendered by the Allahabad High Court which has become\nfinal as between the Railway Administration on the one hand and the\nemployees of the Northern Railway on the other. In the light of the\ncommand of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India the same\ntreatment is required to be accorded to the petitioners regardless of the\nfact that they are serving in Eastern Railway unless it is shown that there\nis some distinguishing feature, for according a different treatment. Learned\nAdditional Solicitor General appearing for the Railway Administration is not in\na\nposition to contend that there is any such special distinguishing feature to\njustify denying of uniformity in treatment. The prayer of the writ petitioners\nmust accordingly be granted to the aforesaid extent. It is therefore directed\nthat\nthe petitioners should be accorded the same treatment as their counterparts are\nbeing accorded in the Northern Railway in regard to treating the running\nallowance granted to the running staff as part of the pay when they are\ntransferred or promoted to a stationary post during the period they hold the\nofficiating in the stationary post to the same extent and in the same manner as\nenjoined by the Allahabad High Court pursuant to the aforesaid judgment. .\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n The very same issue, relating to reservation in promotions in\nthe Railways, fell for consideration before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi. The\nPrincipal Bench of CAT, by its order in O.A. No.2211 of 2008 dated\n02.12.2010, noted the case of the applicants that the pre-\n\nconditions spelt out in M. Nagaraj1 had not been complied with;\nand reservation in promotion, with accelerated seniority, was\nrequired to be worked out as per the settled law on the issue. After\nnoting that the Railways had not worked out, or even applied their\nmind, regarding the preconditions stipulated in the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, before giving effect to the\nprovisions of \nArticle 16(4A)\n, the Principal Bench, CAT quashed the\ncircular dated 29.02.2008 by which the seniority of the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes railway servants, promoted by virtue of\nrule of reservation/roster, was to be regulated. While setting aside\nthe said circular instructions dated 29.02.2008, the Principal\nBench CAT directed the Railways not to give accelerated seniority\nto the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes \ntill such time the preconditions, on which alone \nArticle 16(4A)\n of\nthe Constitution was to operate, were complied with.\n\n It is represented before us that the aforesaid order of the\nPrincipal Bench of CAT has been implemented by the Railways. If\nthat be so, it does not stand to reason that employees, belonging to\nother zones of the Railways, should be treated differently, more so\nas the respondents-applicants are not guilty of delay and laches in\ninvoking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSION: \n\n As the Tribunal has merely followed the law \nlaid down by\n the\nSupreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, in allowing the O.As, the orders of\nthe Tribunal, to the extent it declared the action of the Railways in\nproviding reservation in promotion without fulfilling the\nparameters \nlaid down in\n M. Nagaraj1 to be illegal, do not\nnecessitate interference. The fact however remains that, despite\nthe amendment to the Constitution by insertion of \nArticles 16(4-A)\n\nand (4-B) nearly fourteen years ago, the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes still face uncertainty on whether\nor not they are entitled for reservation in promotion, and to be\nextended the benefit of consequential seniority. This predicament,\nthey find themselves in, is for no fault of theirs but is on account of\nthe failure of the Union of India to gather data, and form its\nopinion, on the parameters \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in M.\nNagaraj1. The prevailing uncertainty can only be put an end to if\nthe petitioner-Railway is directed to undertake the aforesaid\nexercise, and take a decision, within a specified time frame.\n\n \nThe Writ Petitions are, accordingly, disposed of directing\nthe petitioner-Railways to undertake and complete the exercise of\ngathering data, and forming its opinion on the parameters \nlaid\ndown by\n the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1, with utmost \nexpedition and, in any event, not later than six months from the\ndate of receipt of a copy of this Order. As this stalemate cannot be\npermitted to effect railway administration, and the services it\nrenders to the public at large, it is open to the petitioner-Railways\nto make in-charge arrangements in the interregnum, making it\nclear to those, who are given charge of the posts, that this\narrangement is temporary and would continue only till the exercise\nof formation of opinion, on the need to provide reservation in\npromotion, is completed. The miscellaneous petitions pending, if\nany, shall also stand disposed of. No costs.\n\n_______________________________ \n(RAMESH RANGANATHAN, J) \n___________________________________ \n(M.SATYANARAYANA MURTHY, J) \nDate: 29.04.2015.",

Rather, the thrust of their claim was that\nrestructuring of different cadres in Group C and D resulted in upgradation\nof posts and the policy of reservation cannot be applied qua upgraded\nposts. Therefore, the Union of India and the Railway Administration did\nnot get opportunity to show that the employees belonging to Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes did not have adequate representation in\ndifferent cadres; that the outer limit of reservation i.e. 50% will not be\nviolated by applying the policy of reservation and that the efficiency of\nadministration will not be jeopardised by applying the policy of\nreservation.

It is only if the parameters laid down in\nM.Nagaraj1 are satisfied and a provision is made for reservation in\npromotions in favour of the SCs/STs thereafter, would it confer an\nenforceable right in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes to claim the benefit of reservation in\npromotions, and not otherwise. Reliance placed by the petitioners,\non Central Bank of India48, is, therefore, misplaced.\n The Supreme Court, in Suraj Bhan Meena2 and Uttar Pradesh \nPower Corporation Limited3, have followed and reiterated the law\ndeclared in M. Nagaraj1. It is no doubt true that the rules made by\nthe Government were under challenge therein. It is also true that\nthe Supreme Court, in M. Nagaraj1, did not examine the validity of\nindividual State enactments, and held that the question would be\ngone into, in individual writ petitions, by the appropriate Bench in\naccordance with the law laid down in the said judgment. In the\npresent case, the Railways have only been following the policy, of\nproviding reservation in promotion, which were in existence even\nprior to the judgment of the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj1. As the\nRailways was required to gather data, and form its opinion before\nproviding reservation, continuance of the earlier policy of\nreservation in promotion, without undertaking the exercise of\ngathering data and formation of opinion, is illegal.\nVI. IS NOTIFICATION OF THE SCHEDULED CASTES AND THE \n SCHEDULED TRIBES, BY THE PRESIDENTIAL ORDER \n MADE UNDER \nARTICLES 341\n AND \n342\n OF THE \n CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, NOT SUFFICIENT PROOF OF \n THEIR BACKWARDNESS?"
