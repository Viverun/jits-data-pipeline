For the sake of clarity and convenience, the parties are\nhereinafter referred by their ranks and status, i.e., M/s\nMangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd., as Plaintiff and M/s\nMathroo Associates as the Defendant.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n3. The Defendant had invoked the Arbitration Agreement and\npreferred certain claims against the Plaintiff. In response to the\nstatement of Claim preferred by the Defendant, the Plaintiff\nalong with its response to the Statement of Claim also preferred\nCounter-Claim against the Defendant.\n\n4. The Brief Facts leading to the case are as follows:-\n\nThat the Plaintiff is a Public Sector Undertaking and is a\nsubsidiary of Oil & Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) of\nGovernment of India, that the Defendant is a registered\nArchitect and is practicing the profession of Architecture under\nthe name and style of \"Mathroo Associates\", that the Defendant\nNo.2 is a formal party in the Arbitral Proceedings and hence, is\nbeing added as Defendant No.2, that the Plaintiff desired\ncertain designs to be built in for the proposed Retail Outlets at\nMangaluru and Ahmadabad, which designs were ready with the\nDefendant No.2, that the Defendant was recommended and\nselected as a contract for the design of the Retail Outlets by the\nDefendant No.2 and accordingly, worked for the Defendant No.2\nat the designing stage, that several other parties were also\ninvolved in the designing stage in addition to the Defendant,\nthat on 17.01.2005, a Work Order bearing No.WQA-025 was\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nplaced by the Plaintiff with the Defendant, for carrying out work\nwith respect to the Retail Outlets at Mangaluru and Ahmadabad,\nthe terms and conditions of which were accepted in totality by\nthe Defendant, that a Work Order was also issued on\n08.06.2006, bearing No.WQA - 132, in respect of Panvel Retail\nOutlet, that Clause-5.1 of the Work Order dated 17.01.2005\nprovided that Retail Outlet at Mangaluru would be handed over\nto the Plaintiff in working condition, complete in all aspects on\nor before 08.03.2005, that however with respect to the Retail\nOutlet at Ahmadabad, it was specified in Clause 5.2 that the\nsame would be handed over to the Plaintiff within eight weeks\nfrom the date of handing over the site, that the payments were\nreleased from time to time by the Plaintiff as per the Contract,\nthat the last payment was released by the Plaintiff on\n20.04.2005 i.e., within a month of completion of work by the\nDefendant on 19.03.2005, that as per records, the Plaintiff has\npaid the Defendant a sum of Rs.4,74,27,772/- by 20.04.2005,\nwhich exceeds and covers the complete value of the work done\nby the Defendant against the Retail Outlet at Mangaluru and\nthe Plaintiff is not liable to pay any further amount towards the\nsaid Contract, that on the other hand, the Plaintiff was entitled\nto receive from the Defendant a sum of Rs.16,14,370/- as and\nby way of refund for excess payments made, that in respect of\nAhmadabad Retail Outlet, the Plaintiff had furnished the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nDefendant a mobilisation advance of Rs.22,55,463/- , that as\nthe Plaintiff could not get statutory clearances, the project did\nnot commence and hence, there was no question of 'handing\nover' of the site to the Defendant and the amount furnished\ntowards mobilisation advance was adjusted by the Plaintiff in its\naccounts and appropriated towards payments to be made in\nrespect of Mangaluru Project, that there arose a dispute\nbetween the parties in respect of payments and the Defendant\npreferred Arbitration, that the Plaintiff filed Counter-Claim for\nRs.26,40,669/- from the Defendant, that after recording\nevidence and hearing the arguments, the learned Sole\nArbitrator has passed the Impugned Award on 18.06.2011 and\npartly allowed the Claim of the Defendant and dismissed the\nCounter-Claim of the Plaintiff as 'barred by time'.\n\n5. Being aggrieved by the said Arbitral Award, the Plaintiff\nhas challenged the same on several grounds, which will be\ndiscussed later in the body of the Judgment.\n\n6. The Defendant has filed a detailed Statement of Objections\non 29.01.2013, and the contentions taken by the Defendant in\nthe said Statement of Objections will be considered while\ndiscussing the various grounds urged by the Plaintiff, in the\nbody of the Judgment. The 2nd Defendant has also filed his\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\ndetailed Statement of Objections on 06.02.2013.\n\n7. I have heard the arguments of the Advocate for the\nPlaintiff and Advocate for Defendant. The Advocate of the\nPlaintiff has filed Written Arguments on 18.02.2020. The\nAdvocate for the Defendant has filed Written Arguments on\n18.02.2020.\n\n8. Based on the above contentions of both parties, following\nPoints arise for my consideration:-\n\n1. Whether there are grounds to set aside the\nImpugned Award under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act?\n\n2. What Order?\n\n9. My findings on the above points are as follows:-\n\nPoint No.1:- In the Affirmative.\n\nPoint No.2:- As per the final Order for\nthe following reasons.\n\nREASONS\n\n10. Point No.1: - The Defendant has preferred a Claim\nPetition before the Learned Arbitrator for the following reliefs:-\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(a) To award a sum of Rs.4,89,61,730/- payable to the\nClaimant (i.e., the Defendant No.1) as damages/compensation\nand dues etc., up to November 2008.\n\n(b) To award 30% amount (plus surcharge etc.) on the\nactual \"Award Amount\", awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal,\ntowards the \"Income Tax\" payable by the Claimant (i.e., the\nDefendant No.1) on the Award Amount, as stipulated in Clause\nNo:4 of the Work Order (Contract) dated 17.01.2005.\n\n(c) To award interest at 18% per annum from December\n2008 onwards till the date of recovery of all dues.\n\n(d) To Award Cost of the Arbitration Proceedings, as per the\nCost Memo filed by the Claimant (i.e., the Defendant No.1), on\nconclusion of the proceedings or as decided/determined by the\nArbitral Tribunal itself.\n\n(e) To Award any pecuniary relief or reliefs, as deemed fit\nand proper, by the Learned Arbitrator.\n\n11. The Plaintiff has preferred Counter Claim before the\nLearned Arbitrator.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n12. The Learned Arbitrator has partly allowed the claims of\nthe Defendant and dismissed the Counter Claim of the Plaintiff\nin the Impugned Award.\n\n13. The Plaintiff has challenged the said Impugned Award in\nthis proceeding. The Hon'ble High Court in the Judgment\ndated 17.04.2021 in Com.A.P.No.25/2021 (Union of India\nvs. M/s Warsaw Engineers) has laid down certain\nguidelines/principles about the writing of Judgments in a\nPetition filed under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation\nAct. Keeping in my mind the said guidelines, I now propose to\nexamine each and every ground urged by the Plaintiff\nspecifically with reference to the submissions made by both\nAdvocates.\n\n14. The First ground is that the Impugned Award is ex-facie\nerroneous, opposed to public policy, patently illegal and\ncontrary to Justice. This ground being a general ground, the\nsame will be discussed later, after discussing about all other\nspecific grounds.\n\n15. The Second ground is that the Arbitrator erred in failing to\nappreciate that the present claim filed by the Defendant was\nbarred by limitation.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(a) According to the Defendant the right to sue arose in\nfavour of the Defendant against to the Plaintiff on or about\n20.04.2005, when after the last payment of Rs.4,58,58,702/- by\nthe Plaintiff, balance amount due and payable to Defendant was\nwithheld by the Plaintiff, that as per\nSection 43 (2)\nof the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, the Arbitral proceedings for the\npurpose of limitation are deemed to have commenced on the\nday on which the request for the dispute to be referred to\nArbitration is received by the Plaintiff as provided under\nSection\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, that in the present case\nthe request of the Defendant to refer the dispute to arbitration\nwas addressed to Plaintiff on 10.07.2007 as per Ex.C28, that\nwas received by the Plaintiff on or about 12.07.2007 as per\nEx.C30, that therefore, the Arbitral proceedings has\ncommenced with in the period of 3 years from the day of right\nto sue arose under\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\nand the\nclaims are not barred by limitation.\n\n(b) The Learned Arbitrator has framed Issue No.2 about the\nsaid facts and discussed the effect of\nSection 43 (2)\nand\nSection\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, and has held that the\nclaim of the Defendant is well within the limitation. The said\nfinding is neither perverse nor contrary to any law. Hence, the\nsaid ground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-\nSection\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n16. The Third ground is that the learned Arbitrator has ex\nfacie erred in failing to appreciate that the signing of the\nClearance Certificate and Completion Certificate did not mean\nthat the Plaintiff had admitted the amount of the Work Order\nvalue claimed by the Defendant as per the terms of the\nContract between the parties.\n\n(a) In order to appreciate this ground, the facts of the\ncase have to be discussed. The Plaintiff intended to establish\noval shaped proto type retail outlet of dispensing of petrol and\ndiesel and other petroleum products all over India since they\nare the subsidiary of ONGC. On the advice of ONGC, the Plaintiff\ndecided to interest the construction of retail outlet unit to the\nDefendant. As an experimental basis, they have decided to\nentrust the construction of outlets in two places one at\nMangaluru and another at Ahmadabad. On approval the same\nwas communicated to the Defendant as per Ex.R1. The\nDefendant categorically undertaken that they will assists the\nPlaintiff technically in obtaining building permission and\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nsanction though the responsibility of obtaining the sanction will\nbe that of the Plaintiff as could be seen from Ex.R2. Work Order\nwas placed on the Defendant as per Ex.C1. Value of the work\nwas modified incorporating certain additional work and total\nwas increased up to Rs. 5,15,43,302.52 + taxes. Retail outlet at\nMangaluru was completed on 18.03.2005. The Work Order was\nchanged as per Ex.C7, Ex.C8, Ex.C9 and Ex.C10 from time to\ntime. The Work Order as per Ex.C10 the amount agreed is Rs.\n5,07,55,403. The Site Clearance Certificate and Completion\nCertificate were issued as per Ex.C13 & 14 on 18.03.2005. In\nthe Clearance Certificate, it was mentioned actual work\nexecuted is Rs. 5,15,43,302.52. However, the same is not taken\nas the value of work in the Award as could be seen from Page\nNo. 59 to 61 and 87 & 88 of the Award. The Learned Arbitrator\nhas taken Rs. 4,66,95,599/- as the value of the Mangaluru\nProject. Therefore, this ground is highly misconceived. Hence,\nthe said ground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-\nSection (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by\nthe Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this\ncount is thwarted and rejected.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n17. The Fourth ground is that the learned Arbitrator ought to\nhave appreciated that the Defendant issued a Final Bill for the\ntotal Order value of Rs.4,66,95,599/- which has been fully paid\nby the Plaintiff after making requisite deductions and\nadjustments.\n\n(a) The Defendant has denied that Rs. 4,66,95,599/- was\nthe final bill or that the Plaintiff has paid the same amount or\nthat the deductions are justified. As could be seen from Ex.C21\nthe Plaintiff paid Rs. 4,51,72,309/-. The same is also discussed\nat Para No. 15.4 in Page No. 85 of the Award and that the\nLearned Arbitrator has clearly held that Rs. 4,66,95,599/- is the\nbilled amount in terms of Ex.C1 and an amount of Rs.\n4,51,72,309/- has been paid to the Claimant/Defendant. The\nPlaintiff has not rebutted the said findings by showing any other\ndocuments and hence he has not established his contentions\nunder this ground. Hence, the said ground is not available for\nthe Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\nchallenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of\nArbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n18. The Fifth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has ex-\nfacie erred in failing to appreciate that all the deductions made\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nin respect of Mangaluru Project by the Plaintiff were correct and\nproper.\n\n(a) By a Letter dated 27.06.2006, as per Ex.C21 the\nPlaintiff had resorted to some deductions. Among the same, the\ndeduction based on Ex.R7 for Rs. 5,67,544/-, is rejected by the\nLearned Arbitrator at Page No. 59 & 60 of the Award. The\nreason for rejection is that the author of Ex.R7 is not examined\nand that the same is not counter-signed by anybody. The said\nreasoning cannot be considered as perverse. The another\ndeduction towards error in Invoicing for Rs. 2,69,353/- is allowed\nby the Learned Arbitrator and discussed at Para No. 10.10 in\nPage No.60 of the Award. Similarly, another deduction towards\nCrane Hiring Charges for Rs. 45,300/- is allowed by the Learned\nArbitrator and discussed at Para No. 10.11 in Page No. 61 of the\nAward. However, the deduction towards Mobilization Advance of\nRs. 22,55,463/- is rejected by the Learned Arbitrator and\ndiscussed at Para No. 10.12 & 10.13 in Page No. 61 & 62 of the\nAward. All these aspects were considered in detail by\nappreciating the evidence on record and hence the same\ncannot be considered as perverse. Hence, the said ground is not\navailable for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section\n(2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus,\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nthe challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting\naside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n19. The Sixth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has ex-\nfacie erred in holding that there was no clause providing a\ndeduction for one project bill to another bill and that each\nproject is separate in character despite there being a common\norder.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued that\nthe Ex.R.2/ L.O.I. was accepted on 12.01.2005 wherein the\nDefendant had also undertaken to assist the Plaintiff technically\nin obtaining building permission and sanction, that as per\nClause 5.2, it was agreed that the retail outlet at Ahmadabad\nwill be handed over to the Plaintiff within eight weeks from the\ndate of handing over of the Site to the Defendant, that in this\nregard, the Plaintiff had paid a sum of Rs. 22,55,463/- towards\nmobilisation advance for Ahmadabad Project, that the said\namount of mobilisation advance was adjusted towards the\nproject at Mangaluru. The said adjustment of mobilisation\nadvance of Ahmadabad project of Rs. 22,55,463/- is rejected by\nthe Learned Arbitrator as there was no provision in the Work\nOrder dated 17.01.2005 for adjustment of advance given\nagainst one project against amounts due under another\nproject.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(b) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has attacked\nthe same by relying on a decision reported in A.I.R. - 1963 -\nKarnataka - 64 (\nLife Insurance Corporation of India vs. T.\nSubramanyam\n) , wherein it is held that the mode of payment\nof debt may be more than one, it may be by actual payment, it\nmay be by adjustment or it may be by any other means as\nagreed to by the debtor and creditor.\n\nHe has also relied on\nanother decision reported in A.I.R. - 1964 - M.P. - 231 (\nState\nof Madhya Pradesh vs. Raja Balbhadra Singh\n), wherein it\nis held that on general principles a person is entitled to pay\nhimself that amount which is due to him from another if he has\nin his hand, money belonging to that other, provided that his\ndues are legally recoverable and that although that the\nquestion will be adjudged adjusted by the court of law when it\narises, he not obliged to sue for the recovery of the money\nwhich he is in already in possession of the said money.\n\n(c) The Learned Advocate for the Defendant has argued\nthat the Learned Arbitrator has considered the said aspects in\ndetail at Para No. 10.12 and 10.13 of the Award and hence the\nrejection of the said claim based on finding of facts which\ncannot be considered in this proceedings as held in 2010 (1) -\nS.C.C. - 409 (Ravindrakumar Gupta and Company vs.\nUnion of India), 2012 (1) - S.C.C. - 594 (P.R. Shah,\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nShares and Stock Brokers Private Limited vs. B.H.H.\nSecurities Private Limited and Others\n), and 2015 (5) -\nS.C.C. - 739 (\nSwan Gold Mining Limited vs. Hindustan\nCopper Limited\n. By relying on the said decisions the Learned\nAdvocate for the Defendant has argued that the finding of fact\nand the interpretation cannot be substituted by this court by\nsitting as an Appellate Court merely because another view is\npossible to be given.\n\n(d) It is to be noted that the Arbitrator is a creature of\ncontract and he cannot travel beyond the terms of the contract.\nWhen he has given a finding that there was no terms in the\ncontract between the parties to adjust the mobilisation advance\nof one project as against another project and hence the said\nadjustment is contrary to the terms of the contract, the said\nfinding cannot be reversed in this proceedings just because\nanother view is possible to be taken. Therefore the ratio of the\nabove-mentioned decisions which are relied by the Learned\nAdvocate for the Plaintiff is not applicable to the facts of the\npresent case. Hence, the said ground is not available for the\nPlaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge\nflanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral\nAward on this count is thwarted and rejected.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n20. The Seventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nex-facie erred in holding that the sum of Rs.22,55,463/- paid\ntowards mobilisation advance for the Ahmadabad Project\ncannot be adjusted in respect of the Mangaluru Project, despite\nnoting that the Ahmadabad Project was not taken up at all by\nthe parties.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued that\non 15.04.2006 the Town Planning Department submitted\nEx.C34/ Letter to the Municipal Commissioner informed that the\nplan cannot be sanctioned in view of 11 KV Electrical Grid Line\npassing through and distance of 80 meter form Road has not\nmaintained, that a note was also made indicating that the plan\ncan be approved subject to conditions stipulated, that ONGC\naddressed Ex.C40/ Letter to AMC on 28.04.2006 to grant\npermission to maintain distance of 50 meters from plot\nboundary on a road junction after giving undertaking to comply\nwith the conditions imposed, that on 01.05.2006 the note was\nsubmitted to the Municipal Commissioner informing about the\nconditions incorporated who clarified that the distance of 50\nmeter instead of 80 meter requires approval from the State\nGovernment and they cannot give any permission, that the\nDefendant addressed Ex.R.5/ Letter on 23.06.2006 to the\nPlaintiff indicating that the conditions imposed by the AMC is\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nnot feasible to implement and suggested an alternative to have\nthe project at a different site, that in view of restrictions\nimposed by the State Authorities and prohibition under law, the\nplan was not sanctioned, that the alternative site suggested by\nthe Defendant was not viable and project could not be\nimplemented, that the retail outlet could not be constructed\nwithout obtaining the license and sanctioned plan in accordance\nwith AMC Act and bye-laws, that the plan was not sanctioned in\nview of the location of the property and the distance between\nthe road and the plot, that it was impossible to implement the\nproject as per the specification, that the contract was frustrated\nas per the Force Majeure Clause contained in Ex.C1, that the as\nthe contract was frustrated the pass of advance amount paid\nfor the said project was adjusted towards Mangaluru Project and\nthe Defendant was requested to refund the balance amount.\n\n(b) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has further\nargued that the Learned Arbitrator ought to have appreciated\nthe well established position in law that in the absence of\npleadings and/ or evidence of any loss, a party was not entitled\nto the compensatory relief purported to be claimed.\nIn support\nof his arguments he has relied on the decision reported in 2015\n(3) - S.C.C. - 49 (\nAssociate Builders vs. Delhi\nDevelopment Authority\n), which particularly deals with the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nfact that when the Arbitrator wanders outside the work/\nContract and deals with the matter, the Award should be set\naside as one which is unreasonable and shock the conscience of\nthe court. He submits that the said principle is applicable to the\npresent case and hence the impugned award is in contravention\nof public policy of India being in contravention of the\nfundamental policy of Indian Law.\n\n(c) The 1st Defendant has contended that it is factually\nincorrect that the Ahmadabad project was not taken up at all by\nthe parties, that the work was undertaken but prevented from\ndoing so due to non-compliance of 3 conditions for re-issuance\nof Raja Chitti (permission) has indicated in Ex.C36/Letter dated\n08.05.2006 issued by the Municipal Corporation, that the\nfulfillment of the said requirements were the sole responsibility\nof the Plaintiff, that as for as adjustment of mobilisation\nadvance is concerned, the Plaintiff cannot judge its own cause\nin as much as it cannot under law and equity to derive a right to\nadjust amount paid for one project against amount due under\nanother project when such right not under the contract and\nwhen the two projects are independent of each other. He has\nfurther contended that about running amount payment is\nconcerned is has no bearing on the issue raised, that the\nPlaintiff had no right or authority to adjust Rs. 22,55,463/- of\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nAhmadabad project against payments due to the 1 st Defendant\nunder Mangaluru project as was done under Ex.C21/Letter\ndated 27.06.2006, one and half year after completion and\nhandover of Mangaluru Project on 18.03.2005, that the conduct\nof the Plaintiff was completely illegal and without authority\n\n(d) As per the finding of the Learned Arbitrator the\nAhmadabad Project was taken up and drawings were provided\ntime to time and other works were also undertaken and hence\nrejected the said adjustment at Para No. 74 & 75 of the Award.\nThe Learned Arbitrator after appreciating the oral evidence of\nRW.1 & RW.2 and has observed that from the material on record\nit is clear that the Claimant/Defendant has produced drawings\nand those drawings were also approved to a certain extent by\nAMC, that AMC has not given final approval on account of\ninaction on the part of the Respondent No.1/ the present\nPlaintiff in the matter, that the Respondent No.1/ the present\nPlaintiff has also not terminated, canceled or stated anything\nwith regard to any further action to be taken by the\nClaimant/Defendant in continuation of the project, that on the\nother hand it is admitted before the Learned Arbitrator that the\nproject is virtually given up or abandoned on account of want of\nstatutory approval, that the Respondent No.1/ Plaintiff has thus\nproved that the project in Ahmadabad never took place in the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nlight of no permission by the AMC. After the said observations,\nthe Learned Arbitrator has given the finding as follows:-\n\n\"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the\nClaimant has done some work and the contract has been\nunilaterally abandoned without notice to the Claimant.\nThe Claimant is therefore entitled for some\ncompensation in the given circumstances.\"\n\n(e) Further while giving such a finding at Para No. 13.4 of\nthe Award at Page No. 75 of the Award, the Learned Arbitrator\nhas mentioned that in fact he had seem the place at the time of\nexamination of RW.2. Much argued by the Learned Advocate for\nPlaintiff about the said observation/ finding about his visit and\nhas argued that the personal knowledge of the Arbitrator was\nimported in the Award as against the evidence on record, which\nis not permissible. However, the Learned Arbitrator has clearly\nmentioned that he had visited the spot at the time of\nexamination of RW.2, who is the witness of the Plaintiff himself.\nWhen such being the case, the Plaintiff is estopped from\ncontending otherwise.\n\n(f) Therefore, the material on record, the Learned\nArbitrator has given such a finding and hence the same is not\nperverse. Hence, the said ground is not available for the Plaintiff\nunder Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act\n. Thus, the challenge flanked by\nthe Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this\ncount is thwarted and rejected.\n\n21. The Eighth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has ex\nfacie erred in failing to appreciate that the Mangaluru and\nAhmadabad Projects were on running account evident from the\ndetails of payments and bank statements at Ex.R.1.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\ngrounds, i.e., Ground No. 6 & 7. I have already discussed in\ndetail about the said facts while answering Ground No. 6 & 7.\nHence for the same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding\nof the Learned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said\nground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2)\nand Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n22. The Ninth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has erred\nin failing to appreciate that the adjustment of Rs.22,55,463/-\nbeen rightly permitted, the Plaintiff would have been entitled to\nreceive the sum of Rs.7,32,173/- rather than being held liable to\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nmake payment of Rs.12,08,710/- and the said disallowance of\nadjustment/deduction by the learned Arbitrator constitutes a\nfailure of justice.\n\n(a) The Invoice No. 8 & 9 as per Ex.C15 & 16 was issued\ntowards the work at Mangaluru. The amount claimed is Rs.\n1,76,92,652 i.e., after deducting the paid amount of Rs.\n3,38,50,650 in the claimed amount of Rs. 5,15,43,302.52. The\nLearned Arbitrator has upheld the deduction of Rs. 45,300/-\ntowards crane hiring charges.\n\n(b) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued that\nthe retail outlet at Mangaluru was completed on 18.03.2005,\nthat the Work Order was changed as per Ex.C7 to Ex.C10 from\ntime to time, that the value of the Work was modified\nincorporating certain additional work and total was increased to\nRs. 5,15,43,302.52 + taxes, that Site Clarence Certificate and\nCompletion Certificate were issued as per Ex.C13 and Ex.C14 on\n18.03.2005, that in the Clearance Certificate, it was mentioned\nthat the actual value of work executed is Rs. 5,15,43,302.52/-,\nthat the Ex.C15 & Ex.C16 invoices were issued towards the\nwork at Mangaluru, that the amount claimed is Rs.\n1,76,92,652/-, that on 21.06.2005 a meeting was convened and\nit was decided that the total amount will be Rs. 4,76,75,599/-,\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nthat thereafter the Defendant sent revised bill and on\nnegotiation they have given deduction on supervision charges\nand reduced the amount to Rs. 4,66,95,599.01, that on\n27.06.2006 Ex.C21/ Letter was issued intimating that the\namount payable for Mangaluru Project has been completely\npaid after adjusting the advance amount paid towards\nAhmadabad R.O. and the Defendant has to refund the excess\namount, that the Plaintiff sent Ex.C30/ Letter on 04.08.2007\nfurnishing the details and requested to refund excess amount of\nRs.16,14,370/-. He has further argued that there was a mistake\nin measurement and the same was noticed that there is a\nmistaken addition of Rs.5,67,544/- and that the same requires\nto be deducted out of the amount payable, that there was an\narithmetical error while tracing invoice amounting to Rs.\n2,69,353/-, that while sending Ex.C1/ Letter the said amount\nwas deducted along with Debit Note for Rs. 45,300/-, that the\ntotal amount claimed after adjustment of aforesaid amount and\nadvance amount paid for Ahmadabad Project is Rs. 16,14,370/-,\nthat the Statement indicating the same is attached to Ex.C21,\nthat the actual amount payable works out to Rs. 4,58,58,702/-.\n\n(c) The Learned Arbitrator has held that there is no\nevidence on record to substantiate any fraudulent promise,\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\npressurization etc., leading to the above mentioned meeting\ndated 21.06.2005 at Page No. 53 to 57 of the Impugned Award.\n\n(d) The disbursement of Rs. 22,55,463/- took place in\nMay 2005. The counter claim seeking refund of the amount was\nfiled on 16.05.2009. Hence, there is a delay of 4 years hence\nthe same was rejected as time barred by the Learned Arbitrator.\nThe said findings cannot be considered as perverse. Hence, the\nsaid ground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section\n(2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n23. The Tenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has ex-\nfacie erred in failing to direct the Defendant to refund the sum\nof Rs.22,55,463/- to the Plaintiff herein.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 9. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 9. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n24. The Eleventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\ncommitted an error apparent on the face of the Impugned\nAward by completely ignoring the issue of refund of the sum of\nRs.22,55,463/- and failing to direct the Defendant to refund the\nsaid mobilisation advance of Rs.22,55,463/-, or alternatively to\nadjust the same towards the payments due.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground , i.e., Ground No. 9. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 9. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n25. The Twelfth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nerred in granting liberty to the Defendant to claim payment of\ntax arrears subject to production of proof of payment and to the\nsatisfaction of Defendant.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued that\nhaving concluded that the arguments of the Defendant about\nthe said tax arrears did not appeal to the Learned Arbitrator and\nthere was no material to claim in respect of the said taxes he\nhas erred in grant liberty to make future claims by the\nDefendant, that the grant of liberty constitutes an act beyond\nthe jurisdiction of the Arbitrator and is contrary to law and\nopposed to Public Policy of India.\n\n(b) The Learned Advocate for the Defendant has argued\nthat the Learned Arbitrator has given finding at Para No. 12.1 to\n12.6 and he has also referred to Clause 4 of Ex.C1 and Ex.C2.\nThe Defendant has denied that the grant of liberty constitutes\nan act beyond the jurisdiction of the Learned Arbitrator.\nAccording to the Defendant it is a clear mandate under Clause 4\nof the Work Order dated 17.01.2005 that the Plaintiff is entitled\nto all taxes, duties and levies will be paid extra at actual, that in\nthe Arbitral proceeding the Defendant had produced various\ndetails for a tax claim of Rs. 48,27,025/- of which the Learned\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nArbitrator has granted Rs. 5,70,648/- towards refund of works\ntax with interest thereon at 18% from 3.11.2006 till realisation.\nThe Plaintiff had contended that unless assessment order is\nproduced, no reimbursement towards taxes paid under Clause 4\ncould be made. The Respondent has contended at the time of\nhearing of the matter various tax assessments were pending or\nnot completed, hence the Tribunal has granted liberty to\nDefendant in the regard which is just and proper, and that the\nLearned Arbitrator as instead of granting reimbursement of\namounts towards taxes has deferred it subject to submission of\nvalid documents which is equitable having regard to Clause 4 of\nthe Work Order.\n\n(c) Under Clause 4 of Work Order dated 17.01.2005, it is\nmentioned that \"All taxes duties and levies will be paid at\nactual\". In the Arbitral proceedings the Defendant has produced\nvarious details for a tax Claim of Rs. 48,27,025/-, of which the\nLearned Arbitrator has granted only Rs. 5,70,648/- towards\nrefund of works tax with interest thereon at 18% from\n3.11.2006 till realization. The Plaintiff has contended unless\nAssessment Orders are produced on record no reimbursement\ntowards taxes paid under Clause 4 could be made. At the time\nof hearing of the matter of various tax assessments were\npending or not completed. Hence the Learned Arbitrator has\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\ngranted liberty to the Defendant in this regard. The Learned\nArbitrator instead of granting reimbursement of amounts\ntowards taxes has deferred it subject to submission of valid\ndocuments. The said direction cannot be considered as contrary\nto the terms of contract or contrary to the Public Policy, as\ncontended by the Plaintiff. Hence, the said ground is not\navailable for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section\n(2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus,\nthe challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting\naside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n26. The Thirteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nerred in purporting to grant liberty to the Defendant to make\nfuture claims upon the Plaintiff, which constitutes an act beyond\njurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator and is contrary to law.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 12. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 12. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n27. The Fourteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nerred and has acted in a patently illegal manner in purporting to\nreserve the right of the Defendant to produce documentary\nevidence and in directing the Plaintiff to look into those\ndocuments in respect of claims for tax, despite holding that\nthere was nothing on record to support the claim in that regard.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 12. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 12. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n28. The fifteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred\nin holding that the Plaintiff had not placed any acceptable\narguments for denial of the claim of Works Contract Tax.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 12. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 12. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n29. The Sixteenth ground is that learned Arbitrator has erred in\nholding that the material on record would reveal that the three\nconditions for re-issuance of the RC had not been complied with\nby the Plaintiff, without elucidating the basis for arriving at the\nsaid conclusion or how the same was revealed from the\nmaterial on record.\n\n(a) The Defendant has contended as per Ex.C36/ Letter\ndated 08.05.2006, the Plaintiff has to comply with three\nconditions for re-issuance of Raja Chitti, that the fulfillment of\nwhich was the sole responsibility of the Plaintiff and that the\nPlaintiff did not comply with the conditions which was a material\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nbreach of Ahmadabad project by the Plaintiff that prevented the\nDefendant from completing the project.\n\n(b) The Learned Advocate for the Defendant has argued\nthat the Learned Arbitrator has referred to Ex.C.36 at Para No.\n13.2 and based on the said document, the Learned Arbitrator\nhas given finding at Para No. 13.3.\n\n(c) On perusal of said findings of the Learned Arbitrator\nand my observations, discussions and findings, while answering\nseventh ground and for the same reasons, the said findings are\nnot perverse. Hence, the said ground is not available for the\nPlaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge\nflanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral\nAward on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n30. The Seventeenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in failing to appreciate the fundamental condition of the\nWork Order in respect of Ahmadabad Project which was that the\nwork would commence and be completed within eight weeks\nfrom the \"handing over of the site\" and hence, as the said\nhandover had never taken place and the contract had never\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nfructified and thus there was no question of the Defendant\nhaving done any work in respect of thereof.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 16. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 16. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n31. The Eighteenth ground is that learned Arbitrator erred in\nholding that there was breach of contract by the Plaintiff and\nhas failed to appreciate that in respect of Ahmadabad Project,\nthe contract would effectively come into operation only upon\nhandover of the site and hence, no claim could be made in\nrespect of any work alleged to have been done prior to the\nhandover of the site.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued\nthat the award is also bad for the reason of wrong application of\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nSection 73\nof the Contract Act, that it was necessary for the\nLearned Arbitrator to consider that there was no breach or\nviolation of any of the terms of the contract by the Plaintiff in\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, that as recorded at\nPage No. 76 of the Award, the Learned Arbitrator has assumed\nthat the Plaintiff committed breach of contract, that the\nLearned Arbitrator went on to say that as per\nSection 73\nof the\nContract Act that the Plaintiff is liable to pay damages to the\nDefendant despite the fact that there was no such averments in\nthe statement of claims and there was no piece of evidence to\ndetermine so, that the Learned Arbitrator should have applied\n\nSection 56\nof the Contract Act and hence the Impugned Award\nis unsustainable and liable to be set aside.\n\n(b) In support of the said arguments, the Learned\nAdvocate for the Plaintiff has relied on a decision reported in\nA.I.R. - 1954 - S.C.- 44 (\nSatyabrata Ghose vs.\nMugneeram Bangur and Company and Another\n), wherein\nit is held that the word impossible has been used not only in the\nsense of physical or literal impossibility, but also covers cases\nwhere the performance may be impractical, useless from the\npoint of view of object and purpose, which the parties had in\nview.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(c) He has also relied on a decision reported in A.I.R. -\n2007 - Orissa - 56 (\nSyed Khursed Ali vs. State of Orissa\nand another\n). In the said case the Petitioner applied for a\nCertificate under the Cow Slaughter Act, which was not granted\nand therefore could not supply beef as per the agreement. The\nHon'ble High Court held that the Doctrine of frustration of\nventure will be applicable to the facts of the case where\ndoctrine is based not upon the existence of any actual\nimpossibility in fact but upon the existence in circumstances of\nthe case, of any implied condition, which must be absolutely\nnecessary to give effect to the transaction which the parties\nmust have intended.\n\n(d) He has also relied on a decision reported in 2007 (3)\n\n- ARBLR - 314 (Delhi) (\nDelhi Jal Board vs. Esskay Kohli\n),\nwherein is held that where the obtaining of permission was a\nrequirement of law, it was not open for any of the parties to\nhave waived that condition and insist on performance of\ncontrary to the said provision, that the condition was a vital\none, it became impossible for the parties to complete the\ntransaction has contemplated by the parties in its absence.\n\n(e) According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff has issued\nEx.C4/ Letter dated 11.02.2005, with approved drawings and\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nRaja Chitti for the Ahmadabad project in acknowledgment of\nhanding over of the site under the Work Order with the direction\nto Defendant to commence the project which is on record and\nhence the contention that the handover of the site was not took\nplace is denied. He has further contended that the Defendant\ncommenced the work and the Plaintiff also released\nmobilisation advance of Rs.22,55,463/- in favour of Defendant\non 20.01.2005/-, that various works undertaken by the\nDefendant are part of record.\n\n(f) The Defendant has contended that failure of the\nPlaintiff to take steps in pursuance to letter dated 08.05.2006\nwas a material breach of the terms of the Work Order of\nAhmadabad project as the Defendant had undertaken work and\nwas ready and willing to do the project. According to the\nDefendant admittedly the Plaintiff failed to take any steps in\npursuance to Ex.C36/Letter and hence the unilateral action of\nnot taking any steps in pursuance to Ex.C36 is a material\nbreach of the terms, as Defendant had taken necessary steps to\nexecute the project and was ready and willing to do but was\nprevented due to breach of the Plaintiff.\n\n(g) On perusal of the findings of the Learned Arbitrator\nwith reference to the Ex.C36 and evidence adduced before him\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nand my observations, discussions and findings, while answering\nseventh ground and for the same reasons, the said findings are\nnot perverse. Hence, the said ground is not available for the\nPlaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge\nflanked by the Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral\nAward on this count is thwarted and rejected.\n\n32. The Nineteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nerred in holding that the Plaintiff is liable for non-grant of\npermission by the Ahmadabad Municipal Corporation, that\nsince the non-grant of permission was beyond the control of the\nPlaintiff, the Plaintiff could not be held liable for any\nconsequence arising there from.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n33. The Twentieth ground is that the Sole Arbitrator wrongly\nplaced reliance on\nA.T. Brij Paul Singh\n's case as\nin that case\n\nwhere the contractor had executed a part of the works contract\nand hence it was held that he would be entitled to damages by\nway of loss of profit and that in the present case the work had\nnot commenced and hence the same is not applicable to the\nfacts of the present case.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n34. The Twenty-first ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in holding that in the present case the facts would permit\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n10% loss of profit to be awarded and that there is no reasoning\nor finding given by the learned Arbitrator to support the said\ncomputation of percentage of loss of profit, which is totally\narbitrary and without any basis.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground , i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n35. The Twenty-second ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas erred in failing to appreciate that the Judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court clearly holds that the claim for loss of\nprofit ought to be proved by evidence.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n36. The Twenty-third ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nought to have appreciated the well established position of law\nthat in the absence of pleadings and/or evidence of any loss, a\nparty was not entitled to the compensatory relief purported to\nbe claimed.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n37. The Twenty-fourth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas erred in granting sums towards loss of profit, supervision\nfees and architectural charges without any evidence of actual\nloss having been caused to the Defendant and without any\ncomputation, pleadings or evidence to support the frivolous\nclaims.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground , i.e., Ground No. 18. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering Ground No. 18. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n38. The grounds mentioned at 25 to 28 are related to the\nsupervision fees and architectural consultancy fees. In order to\navoid repetition of facts I discuss the same jointly.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n39. The Twenty-fifth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has\nerred in awarding the Defendant a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- as and\nby way of supervision fees.\n\n40. The Twenty-sixth ground is that the grant of the so-called\nnominal sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- is admittedly not supported by\nany pleadings or proof, and the same constitutes an arbitrary\nand unsustainable exercise of jurisdiction by the learned\nArbitrator.\n\n41. The Twenty-seventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas erred in holding that the Defendant \"must have done some\nwork with regard to designing the drawings as an Architect\",\nwithout there being any material or documents on record to\nsupport the said findings.\n\n42. The Twenty-eighth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in granting architectural charges to the tune of\nRs.5,61,093/- without giving any reasoning, findings or\nexplanation as to the basis on which the measure of 2% was\ndetermined, which appears to be purely at the arbitrary\ndiscretion of the learned Arbitrator.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(a) The Defendant has contended that the Work Order\nstipulates for the supervision fees and the Council of the\nArchitecture (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 1989 provides\nfor architectural fees. The Claimant/Defendant has claimed a\ntotal sum of Rs. 4,89,61,730/- as damages payable to him,\nwhich includes the said supervision fees and architectural fees\nas could be seen from the calculations made at Para No. 12 of\nthe Claim statement. When such being the case, the contention\nof the Plaintiff that there are no pleadings about the same\ncannot be accepted. Further, at Para No. 13.10 of the Award,\nthe Learned Arbitrator has in detail discussed about supervision\nfees and has granted a nominal fee with regard to said aspect.\nSimilarly at Para No. 13.11 & 13.12 of the Award he has\ndiscussed about Architectural fees also. By considering the said\naspects, the said finding of the Learned Arbitrator is not\nperverse. Hence, the said ground is not available for the Plaintiff\nunder Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by\nthe Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this\ncount is thwarted and rejected.\n\n43. The grounds mentioned in 29 & 30 are co-related to\nPanvel Project and hence in order to avoid repetition of facts, I\ndiscuss the same jointly.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n44. The Twenty-ninth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in grating the claim relating to the Panvel Retail Outlet to\nthe tune of Rs.3,56,720/- by relying upon the evidence of\nDefendant No.1, while failing to appreciate that the Defendant\nhad furnished no basis for claiming the said amount.\n\n45. The Thirtieth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerroneously awarded the aforesaid sum of Rs.3,56,720/- merely\non the say-so of the Defendant, while failing to appreciate the\nfact that the only work done in respect of the Panvel Project for\nwhich a bill (Ex.C-20) has been raised by the Defendant was for\na sum of Rs.84,160/-, which has admittedly been received by\nthe Defendant.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued that\nthe Panvel Project is not the subject matter of L.O.I and it was\nalso not a subject matter of Arbitration, that among ten issues\nframed by the Learned Arbitrator did not include any issues\nabout Panvel Project, that the Impugned Award deals with\ndispute not contemplated by and not falling within the scope of\nthe submission to Arbitration and is totally a case of Arbitrator\nwandering beyond his jurisdiction, that Ex.C23/ Work Order in\nrespect of a two-storied building at Panvel was issued on\n08.06.2006 and the amount claimed is Rs. 1,68,360/-, that no\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nevidence has been produced to substantiate the claim of the\nDefendant or to prove the extent of work done on this, except\nthe say of CW.1 nothing is available on record, that it was\ncategorically stated by the Plaintiff that the Defendant was paid\nto the extent of work done by him, that the Defendant during\nhis cross-examination has admitted that the Plaintiff paid Rs.\n84,180/- for the said work, that after realizing that the\nDefendant totally failed to establish that he did any work in\ncommensuration of the said claim, that the Learned Arbitrator\nawarded an amount of Rs. 3,56,720/- and 18% interest thereon\nand the same is in contravention of Public Policy and\nfundamental policy of Indian Law.\n\n(b) The Defendant has contended that as per the\nevidence on record he had claimed consultancy fee for the\ndesigning work as per Ex.C19, that the professional consultancy\nwork entailed nineteen drawings as per Ex.C59, that the bill for\nthe professional service of RS 3,56,720/-, was raised at Ex.C31,\nthat there is no rebuttal to the work done for the Panvel project\nand accordingly the Learned Arbitrator was allowed the said\nclaim.\n\n(c) The learned Arbitrator has discussed about Panvel\nProject at Para No. 14.1 and after referring to Ex. C59, Ex.C31,\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nand Ex.C19 & Ex.C20 with the evidence of Sri. Ajay Kumar,\nEngineering charge as held that the Claimant/Defendant is\nentitled for a sum of Rs. 3,56,720/- for Panvel Project. He has\nalso observed that the Plaintiff has stated that he has paid the\nClaimant to the extent of work with respect to Panvel Project\nand there are no dues, but failed to prove the said aspects. The\nsaid findings cannot be considered as perverse and against to\nthe public policy as contended by the Plaintiff. Hence, the said\nground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2)\nand Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n46. The Grounds No. 31 to 35 and 39 & 40 are co-related in\nrespect of Award of Interest by the Learned Arbitrator and\nhence in order to avoid repetition of facts, I discuss the same\njointly.\n\n47. The Thirty-one ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred\nin holding that interest @ 18% per annum under\nSection 31(7)\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, would apply to both per-\nreference and also pendente lite interest, as the said\nSection\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nonly refers to post Award interest at 18% per annum and\ntherefore, the finding in this regard is contrary to law.\n\n48. The Thirty-two ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred\nin holding that because the Plaintiff had claimed interest @ 18%\nper annum, it is ipso facto implied that the Plaintiff accepted\n18% per annum to be reasonable rate.\n\n49. The Thirty-three ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in taking into account and/or awarding pre-reference\ninterest when admittedly no such prayer was made by the\nDefendant, the learned Arbitrator erroneously exercised\njurisdiction which is contrary to law and public policy.\n\n50. The Thirty-four ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred\nin failing to appreciate that the Defendant has held the\nPlaintiff's mobilisation advance paid towards the Ahmadabad\nproperty to the tune of Rs.22,55,460/- had has earned\nsignificant interest thereon till date and hence, the interest\nawarded to the Defendant should have been much lower than\n18% which has been granted by the Arbitrator.\n\n51. The Thirty-five ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred\nin holding that the Defendant had claimed interest for the pre-\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nreference period from April 2005 till November 2008, when the\nprayers and pleadings in the Statement of Claim nowhere\nreflect a claim for pre-reference interest and hence, the award\nof pre-reference interest is erroneous exercise of jurisdiction by\nthe learned Arbitrator, which is contrary to law as being beyond\nthe pleadings of the parties.\n\n52. The Thirty-Ninth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in awarding pre-reference interest when the same was not\nprayed for by the Defendant.\n\n53. The Forty ground is that the learned Arbitrator erred in\ndirecting the interest to be paid on the Works Contract Tax from\nthe date of Assessment Order dated 03.11.2006, when\nadmittedly the Assessment Order was produced for the first\ntime before the learned Arbitrator on 31.07.2010 and was not\nfurnished to the Plaintiff prior thereto, is unconscionable and\nopposed to the public policy.\n\n(a) The Learned Advocate for the Plaintiff has argued\nthat the grant of Interest which has not been prayed for is an\nerroneous exercise of jurisdiction by the Learned Arbitrator and\nis contrary to law and public policy that the Arbitrator has lost\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nsite of the fact that the Plaintiff is a Government Company and\nby any stretch of imagination awarding of 18% Interest or any\nInterest against it, it is highly unjustified in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, wherein no fault of the Plaintiff is\nfound by the Learned Arbitrator from the evidence adduced\nbefore him by both the parties. The Learned Advocate for the\nPlaintiff has further argued that while erroneously holding that\nthe Plaintiff has retained the money legally payable to the\nDefendant from 2005 till date, the Learned Arbitrator erred in\nfailing to appreciate that the Defendant has held the Plaintiff's\nmobilisation advance paid towards Ahmadabad property to the\ntune of Rs.22,55,460/- and he has earned significant interest\nthereon dill date, that in the said circumstances the award\ngranting such unconscionable and unimaginable interest is in\nconflict with the most basic motions of justice.\n\n(b) The Defendant has contended that even though\nunder\nSection 31(7)\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\ninterest at 18% per annum is to be imposed for pendente lite,\nthe same rate can also be imposed for the pre-reference period,\nthat in the Statement of Claim pre-reference interest at 18% per\nannum has been specifically prayed for from April 2005.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n54. In this case, there are no terms in the contract for the\npayment of interest. The Learned Arbitrator at Para No. 15.3 of\nthe Award has observed that since there is no quantification of\ninterest is available in terms of contract, interest at 18% per\nannum in terms of\nSection 31(7)\nof the Act is payable by the\nPlaintiff and that this interest at 18% per annum would apply to\nboth pre-reference and also pendente lite interest. At Para No.\n15.4 the Learned Arbitrator has observed that the Claimant has\nclaimed interest for pre-reference period from April 2005 till\nNovember 2008, pendente lite interest from December 2008 till\ndate of Award and future interest after award till realization.\n\n55. However, in the Statement of Claim filed by the\nClaimant/Defendant in Prayer Column, at Column No. (c), he\nhas claimed to award interest 18% per annum from December\n2008 till the date of recovery of all dues. However at Para No.\n12 the Claimant/Defendant has calculated the amount to be\nawarded and in the said calculation he has claimed interest at\n18% per annum from April 2005 to November 2008.\n\n56. Under\nSection 31 (7)\nof the 1996 Act, the power of the\nArbitral Tribunal to award interest has been clearly provided.\n\nSection 31(7)(a)\nof the 1996 Act deals with interest that the\nArbitral Tribunal can award \"for the whole or any part of the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nperiod between the date on which the cause of action arose and\nthe date on which the award is made\". This period thus includes\nthe entire period prior to making of the award which is, for case\nof reference referred to as pendente lite. The interest can\ntherefore be awarded by the Tribunal, for example from the\ndate when the first claim is raised by the contractor or when a\nlegal notice is issued or when the arbitration clause is invoked\nor the protest against the non- clearance of certain amounts as\npart of a bill. Thus, the entire period from the date when the\ncause of action arises till the date of award i.e., passing through\nall stages of correspondence, invocation of arbitration clause,\nreference is made, Arbitration Tribunal entering reference,\npendency of proceedings, and passing of the award is included\nin the scope of this clause.\n\n57.\nSection 31(7)(b)\nof the 1996 Act, however refers to\ninterest payable \"from the date of award to the date of\npayment\" i.e. the period after the passing of the award which is\nfor case of reference referred to as future interest.\n\n58.\nIn the decision reported in (2009) 12 - S.C.C. - 26\n(\nSayeed Ahmed & Company vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &\nOthers\n), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorically held that\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nby virtue of\nSection 31(7)\n, there exists no difference between\npre-reference period and the pendente lite period. The relevant\nportion of\nthe said decision\nis as follows:-\n\n\"13. The legislature while enacting the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n,\nincorporated a specific provision in regard to\naward of interest by arbitrators. Sub-section(7)\nof\nSection 31\nof the Act deals with the\narbitrator's power to award interest. Clause (a)\nrelates to the period between the date on which\nthe cause of action arose and the date on which\nthe award is made. Clause(b) relates to the\nperiod from the date of award to date of\npayment. The said sub- section (7) is extracted\nbelow :\n\n\"31. (7)(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the\nparties, where and insofar as an arbitral award is\nfor the payment of money, the Arbitral Tribunal\nmay include in the sum for which the award is\nmade interest, at such rate as it deems\nreasonable, on the whole or any part of the\nmoney, for the whole or any part of the period\nbetween the date on which the cause of action\narose and the date on which the award is made.\n\n(b) A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral\naward shall, unless the award otherwise directs,\ncarry interest at the rate of eighteen per cent per\nannum from the date of the award to the date of\npayment.\"\n\nHaving regard to sub-section (7) of\nSection\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n31 of the Act, the difference between pre-\n\nreference period and pendente lite period has\ndisappeared insofar as award of interest by\narbitrator. The said Section recognises only two\nperiods and makes the following provisions :\n\n(a) In regard to the period between the date\non which the cause of action arose and the date\non which the award is made (pre-reference\nperiod plus pendente lite), the Arbitral Tribunal\nmay award interest at such rate as it deems\nreasonable, for the whole or any part of the\nperiod, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\n(b) For the period from the date of award to\nthe date of payment the interest shall be 18%\nper annum if no specific order is made in regard\nto interest. The arbitrator may however award\ninterest at a different rate for the period\nbetween the date of award and date of payment.\n\n14. The decisions of this Court with\nreference to the awards under the old\nArbitration\nAct\nmaking a distinction between the pre-\n\nreference period and pendente lite period and\nthe observation therein that arbitrator has the\ndiscretion to award interest during pendente lite\nperiod in spite of any bar against interest\ncontained in the contract between the parties are\nnot applicable to arbitration governed by the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n1996.\"\n\n59. Thus, as per this decision, the difference between the\n\nArbitration Act, 1940\nand 1996 Act is clear insofar as it relates\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nto the periods for which the interest can be awarded prior to the\npassing of the award, no longer exists. In the decision reported\nin (2010) 8 - S.C.C. - 767 (Sree Kamatchi Amman\nConstructions vs. Divisional Railway Manager (Works),\nPalghat Ors). the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the\ndiscretion of the Arbitral Tribunal in refusing to award interest\nfor the pendente lite period.\nThereafter, in the decision reported\nin (2015) 9 - S.C.C. - 695 (\nUnion of India vs. Bright Power\nProjects (India) Private Limited\n), the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt considered Clause 13(3) of the contract therein. The said\nClause 13(3) is set out herein below:-\n\n\"No interest will be payable upon the\nearnest money and the security deposit or\namounts payable to the contractor under the\ncontract, but government securities deposited in\nterms of sub-clause (1) of this clause will be\nrepayable with interest accrued thereon\"\n\n60.\nIn the context of this clause, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nas distinguished the earlier decision reported in (1992) 1 -\nS.C.C. - 508 (\nSecretary, Irrigation Department,\nGovernment of Orissa & Others vs. G.C. Roy\n), which was\ndecided under the 1940 Act and observed in Para 13, 17 and 21\nwhich read as under:\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n\"13.\nSection 31(7)\nof the Act, by using the\nwords \"unless otherwise agreed by the parties\",\ncategorically specifies that the arbitrator is\nbound by the terms of the contract so far as\naward of interest from the date of cause of\naction to date of the award is concerned.\n\nTherefore, where the parties had agreed that no\ninterest shall be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal\ncannot award interest.\n\n...\n\n17. It is also pertinent to note that\nG.C.\nRoy\n's case had been decided on 12-12-1991 on\nthe basis of the provisions of the\nArbitration Act\n\n1940, which was not operative at the time when\nthe dispute on hand was decided by the Arbitral\nTribunal.\n\n...\n\n21. For the afore-stated reasons, we set\naside the impugned judgment and the award so\nfar as it pertains to payment of interest pendente\nlite and direct that no interest would be paid on\nthe amount payable under the contract to the\nrespondent from the date of the reference till the\ndate of the award.\"\n\n61.\nIn the decision reported in (2016) 6 - S.C.C. - 36 (\nUnion\nof India vs. Ambica Construction\n), which was rendered by a\nthree Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Court was\nconsidering the power of the Arbitrator to award pendente lite\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\ninterest when the contract contains a bar under the 1940 Act.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the above-mentioned\njudgments in (1992) 1 - S.C.C. - 508 (\nSecretary, Irrigation\nDepartment, Government of Orissa & Others vs. G.C.\nRoy\n), (2009) 12 - S.C.C. - 26 (\nSayeed Ahmed & Company\nvs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Others\n), (2010) 8 - S.C.C. -\n767 (Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions vs. Divisional\nRailway Manager (Works), Palghat Ors) and (2015) 9 -\nS.C.C. - 695 (\nUnion of India vs. Bright Power Projects\n(India) Private Limited\n), and observed as under:-\n\n\"22. In our opinion, it would depend upon\nthe nature of the ouster clause in each case. In\ncase there is express stipulation which debars\npendent lite interest, obviously, it cannot be\ngranted by the arbitrator. The award of pendent\nlite interest inter alia must depend upon the\noverall intention of the agreement and what is\nexpressly excluded.\n\n..............................\n\n25. ....\nSection 31(7)(a)\nof the 1996 Act\nconfers the power on the arbitrator to award\ninterest pendent lite, \"unless otherwise agreed\nby parties\". Thus, it is clear from the provisions\ncontained in\nSection 31(7)(a)\nthat the contract\nbetween the parties has been given importance\nand is binding on the arbitrator. The arbitration\nclause is also required to be looked into while\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\ndeciding the power of the arbitrator and in case\nthere is any bar contained in the contract on\naward of interest, it operates on which items and\nin the arbitration clause what are the powers\nconferred on the arbitrator and whether bar on\naward on interest has been confined to certain\nperiod or it relates to pendency of proceedings\nbefore the arbitrator.\n\n...\n\n28. ...It is apparent from various decisions\n\nreferred to above\nthat in G.C. Roy the\nConstitution Bench of this Court has laid down\nthat where the agreement expressly provides\nthat no interest pendente lite shall be payable on\namount due, the arbitrator has no power to\naward interest.\n\n...\n\n34. Thus, our answer to the reference is\nthat if the contract expressly bars the award of\ninterest pendent lite, the same cannot be\nawarded by the arbitrator. We also make it clear\nthat the bar to award interest on delayed\npayment by itself will not be readily inferred as\nexpress bar to award interest pendent lite by the\nArbitral Tribunal, as ouster of power of the\narbitrator has to be considered on various\nrelevant aspects referred to in the decisions of\nthis Court, it would be for the Division Bench to\nconsider the case on merits.\"\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n62. It is relevant to point out that the above-mentioned\ndecision reported in (2016) 6 - S.C.C. - 36 (\nUnion of India\nvs. Ambica Construction\n), was a case decided under the\n1940 Act but a reference in respect of the various decisions of\nthe two Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which had\ntaken varying views and only the reference was answered.\n\n63. Thereafter, the Hon'ble Supreme court in the decision\nreported in (2017) 9 - S.C.C. - 611 (\nSri Chittaranjan Maity\nvs. Union of India\n), considered a case where there were\nvarious claims which were raised and amounts awarded even\nbeyond security deposit and earnest money. This is evident\nfrom a perusal of the table in paragraph 10 of\nthe said\njudgment\n. On the issue of interest, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nconsidered\nSection 31(7)(a)\nof the 1996 Act and clause 16 of\nthe GCC. The relevant portion is as follows:-\n\n\"19.\nIn\nSayeed Ahmed and Co. vs. State of\nUttar Pradesh and Others\n(2009) 12 SCC 26, this\nCourt noted that the 1940 Act did not contain any\nprovision relating to the power of the Arbitrator\nto award interest. However, now a specific\nprovision has been created Under\nSection 31(7)\n\n(a) of the 1996 Act. As per this Section, if the\nagreement bars payment of interest, the\nArbitrator cannot award interest from the date of\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\ncause of action till the date of award. The Court\nhas observed that in regard to the provision in\nthe 1996 Act, the difference between pre-\n\nreference period and the pendente lite interest\nhas disappeared insofar as award of interest by\nthe Arbitrator is concerned.\nSection 31(7)(a)\n\nrecognizes only two periods, i.e. pre- award and\npost-award period.\n\n20. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions\nv. Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat\nand Ors. (2010) 8 SCC 767, this Court was dealing\nwith an identical case wherein Clause 16 of the\nGCC of Railways had required interpretation. This\nis the same Clause 16(2) of the GCC prohibiting\ngrant of interest which is also applicable in the\nfacts of the present case. The Court held that\nwhere the parties had agreed that the interest\nshall not be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot\naward interest between the date on which the\ncause of action arose to the date of the award.\n\n21.\nIn\nUnion of India vs. Bright Power\nProjects (India) Private Limited\n(2015) 9 SCC 695,\na three- Judge Bench of this Court, after referring\nto the provisions of\nSection 31(7)(a)\nof the 1996\nAct, held that when the terms of the agreement\nhad prohibited award of interest, the Arbitrator\ncould not award interest for the pendente lite\nperiod. It has been held thus:\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n\"10. Thus, it had been specifically\nunderstood between the parties that no interest\nwas to be paid on the earnest money, security\ndeposit and the amount payable to the\ncontractor under the contract. So far as payment\nof interest on government securities, which had\nbeen deposited by the Respondent contractor\nwith the Appellant is concerned, it was\nspecifically stated that the said amount was to\nbe returned to the contractor along with interest\naccrued thereon, but so far as payment of\ninterest on the amount payable to the contractor\nunder the contract was concerned, there was a\nspecific term that no interest was to be paid\nthereon.\n\n11. When parties to the contract had\nagreed to the fact that interest would not be\nawarded on the amount payable to the\ncontractor under the contract, in our opinion,\nthey were bound by their understanding. Having\nonce agreed that the contractor would not claim\nany interest on the amount to be paid under the\ncontract, he could not have claimed interest\neither before a civil court or before an Arbitral\nTribunal.\" Therefore, it is clear that the Appellant\nis not entitled for any interest on the amount\nawarded by the Arbitral Tribunal\"\n\n64. Thereafter, in the decision reported in (2018) 7- S.C.C.\n\n- 664 (\nRaveechee and Co. vs. Union of India\n), the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court was considering a case where the Arbitrator had\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nawarded interest @ 12% p.a. on the award excluding the\namount of security deposit. The relevant portion of\nthe said\ndecision\nis as follows:-\n\n\"8. In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal\ngiving effect to the purport of Clause 16(3) did\nnot award any interest on security deposits. The\nclause in terms states that no interest will be\npayable on earnest money, security deposits or\non any amounts payable to the contractor under\nthe contract.\n\nThe Arbitrators in their award have relied\non Clause 16(3) of the contract to deny interest\non the security deposit. The Arbitrators held that\nwhat was intended under Clause 16(3) barred the\ngrant of interest on earnest money, security\ndeposit and amounts payable to the appellant, it\ndoes not in any way bar grant of interest pendent\nlite.\"\n\n65. The legal position, upon a cumulative reading of all the\njudgments can be summarized as under:\n\ni) There is no distinction between the pre-\n\nreference and pendente lite period under the 1996 Act\nas held in (2009) 12 - S.C.C. - 26 (\nSayeed Ahmed &\nCompany vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Others\n).\n\nii) If the contract has a specific stipulation in\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nrespect of award of interest, the same would be\napplicable and the Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 31(7)\n\nwould be bound by the same as held in (2015) 9 -\nS.C.C. - 695 (\nUnion of India vs. Bright Power\nProjects (India) Private Limited\n).\n\niii) The express exclusion in a contract has to be\ndetermined after a reading of a clause and the overall\nintention of the agreement as also the exact exclusion\nas held in (2016) 6 - S.C.C. - 36 (\nUnion of India vs.\nAmbica Construction\n).\n\niv) In respect of security deposit, earnest money\ndeposit and other amounts payable under the contract,\nno interest is payable as held in (2017) 9 - S.C.C. -\n611 (\nSri Chittaranjan Maity vs. Union of India\n).\n\nv) Though in respect of security deposit, earnest\nmoney deposit and amounts payable under the\ncontract, no interest is payable, in respect of\nunascertained damages, the same would not be an\namount payable under the contract, hence interest\nwould be payable as held in (2018) 7- S.C.C. - 664\n(\nRaveechee and Co. vs. Union of India\n).\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n66. The above conclusions are arrived at after looking at the\nfactual background and the findings in the decisions of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court\nreferred to above\n.\n\n67. In view of\nSection 31(7)(a)\nof the 1996 Act, if there is an\nagreement between the parties, insofar as award of interest is\nconcerned, then the said agreement prevails. The power of\nArbitrator to award pendente lite interest is contemplated and\nrecognized, only \"where justified\". Under such circumstances,\non the amounts awarded, no pre-award interest is payable. The\narbitral award in the present case grants interest to the\nClaimant, pre-reference and pendente lite. The said amount of\ninterest is liable to be set aside.\n\n68. The Thirty-sixth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhaving come to a finding that the Defendant had not\ncommenced the Ahmadabad Project or done any work and\nhaving disallowed the deduction of mobilisation advance from\nthe amounts paid by the Plaintiff towards the Mangaluru Project,\nought to have granted the counter-claim of the Plaintiff thereby\nrefunding the balance sum from the mobilisation advance.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\ngrounds, i.e., Ground No. 6, 7, 9 & 11. I have already discussed\nin detail about the said facts while answering the said Grounds.\nHence for the same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding\nof the Learned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said\nground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2)\nand Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n69. The Thirty-seventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nhas erred in holding that the counter-claim was barred by\nlimitation, since the counter-claim had been filed within less\nthan 3 years from the date of assertion of the deductions.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\nground, i.e., Ground No. 9. I have already discussed in detail\nabout the said facts while answering the said Ground. Hence for\nthe same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding of the\nLearned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said ground is\nnot available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-\nSection (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.\nThus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff calling for the\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nsetting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and\nrejected.\n\n70. The Thirty-eighth ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nerred in failing to apply the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt which laid down the proposition that limitation would\ncommence from the date of assertion and denial of payment.\n\n71. On the entire reading of the Award passed by the learned\nArbitrator he has discussed about various decisions including\nA.I.R - 1984 - S.C. - 1703 (A.T. Brij Paul Singh & Others vs.\nState of Gujarath), 1986 (3) - S.C.C. - 522 (\nZodiac Electricals\nPrivate Limited vs. Union of India & Others\n), A.I.R. - 1988 - S.C.-\n107 (\nMajor(Retd) Inder Singh Rekhi vs. Delhi Development\nAuthority\n), A.I.R - 2009 - S.C. - 170 (\nNational Insurance\nCompany Limited vs. Boghara Polyfab Private Limited\n), and\nOther several decisions. Further he has discussed about\nlimitation to the Counter Claim of the Plaintiff in detail.\nTherefore, the said findings cannot be considered as perverse.\nHence, the said ground is not available for the Plaintiff under\nSub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by\nthe Plaintiff calling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this\ncount is thwarted and rejected.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n72. The Forty-first ground is that the learned Arbitrator\nexceeded his jurisdiction in purporting to reserve liberty for the\nDefendant to claim payment of tax arrears subsequent to the\nArbitration.\n\n(a) This ground is nothing but repetition of the earlier\ngrounds, i.e., Ground No. 12, 14 & 40. I have already discussed\nin detail about the said facts while answering the said Grounds.\nHence for the same reasons, I am of the opinion that the finding\nof the Learned Arbitrator is not perverse. Hence, the said\nground is not available for the Plaintiff under Sub-Section (2)\nand Sub-Section (2-A) of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration &\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Plaintiff\ncalling for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\nthwarted and rejected.\n\n73. Now, among the several grounds urged by the Plaintiff,\nonly on the grounds relating to the pre-reference and pendente\nlite interest, the Award is liable to be set-aside. When such\nbeing the case, whether the Award can be set-aside only for\nthe said portion or whether the Award can be modified about\nthe said aspect, is to be considered.\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n74.\nSection 34\nof Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996\nindicates that the power of the Courts is limited to setting aside\nthe arbitral awards, strictly in terms of the specific grounds\nurged before the Court.\nThe Act\ncontains no provision that\nallows the Courts to either modify the arbitral awards or grant\nadditional/alternative reliefs that the arbitral tribunal did not\ngrant.\nThe Act\nprovides only two mechanisms for making\nchanges in the arbitral award passed by the arbitral tribunal.\nThe first being provided under\nSection 33\n, whereby the arbitral\ntribunal is empowered to make clerical and technical\ncorrections in the arbitral award that it deems fit after receiving\nthe request for the same from the parties to the proceedings.\nThe second mechanism is under\nSection 34(4)\n, whereby the\nCourts can adjourn the proceedings for setting aside arbitral\nawards and provide an opportunity to the arbitral tribunal to\ntake appropriate actions to eliminate the grounds for setting\naside such arbitral awards. Thus, even during the pendency of\nthe proceedings under\nSection 34\n, the defects in the arbitral\naward can only be cured by the arbitral tribunal. In view of the\nabove, it is clear that that power to make changes in the\narbitral award only resides with the arbitral tribunal, and the\nCourts cannot make any such changes in the arbitral award\nunder any circumstance whatsoever. The Courts should\nrecognize that while opting to resolve disputes through\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\narbitration, the parties consciously choose to exclude the\nCourt's jurisdiction. Thus, the exercise of modifying or altering\nthe arbitral award by the Courts not only goes against the\nscheme of the Act but also defeats the objective of the\narbitration process. Therefore, after the dispute between the\nparties is resolved through arbitration, the Courts should\nrecognize that their role is limited to setting aside arbitral\nawards based on the specific grounds enshrined under\nSection\nand should refrain from making any modifications in the\narbitral awards.\n\n75. It is further to be noted that this court has no jurisdiction\nto remand the matter to the Arbitrator also. For the said aspect,\nI wish to refer a decision reported in I.L.R. - 2016 - KAR -\n4136 (DB) (\nBhaskar Industrial Development Limited vs.\nSouth Western Railways\n), wherein it is held that the power of\nthe Court under\nSection 34\nof the Act is not to remand the\nmatter to the Arbitral Tribunal after setting aside the Arbitral\nAward.\n\nThe said principle of law is upheld by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the decision reported in 2018 (11) - S.C.C. -\n328 (\nKinnari Mullick and another vs. Ghanshyam Das\nDamani\n), wherein it is held as follows:-\n\n\"The power of the Court to remand the matter to\nthe Arbitral Tribunal is only to adjourn the Proceedings\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nfor the limited purpose mentioned in\nSection 34 (4)\ni.e.,\nto give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume\nthe Arbitral Proceedings or to take such other action as\nin the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal, will eliminate the\ngrounds for setting aside the Arbitral Award. The\nconditions required to be satisfied for such remand\nare :-\n\n(i) There is a written request made by a party to the\nArbitration Proceedings;\n\n(ii) The Arbitral Award has not already been set\naside;\n\n(iii) The challenge to the Award has been set up\nunder\nSection 34\nabout the deficiencies in the Arbitral\nAward which may be curable by allowing the Arbitral\nTribunal to take such measures which can eliminate the\ngrounds for setting aside the Arbitral Award.\"\n\n76. Therefore, there is no scope to remand the matter to the\nArbitrator.\n\n77. Further, in view of the decisions reported in 2019 (15) -\nS.C.C. - 131 (\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co.\nLtd. vs. National Highways Authority of India Ltd.\n), and\n2020 (5) - S.C.C. - 164 (\nSouth East Asia Marine\nEngineering & Constructions Limited vs. Oil India\nLimited\n), this Court has no power to modify, revive or vary the\nArbitral Award under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\nAct, 1996.\n\nFurther, in a latest decision reported in 2021 -\nS.C.C. Online - S.C. - 473 (\nNational Highways vs. M.\nHakeem\n), decided on 20-07-2021, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nhas held that if one were to include the power to modify an\naward in\nSection 34\n, one would be crossing the Lakshman\nRekha.\n\n78. In view of my above discussions, observations and\nfindings, I am of the opinion that the Award of the Learned\nArbitrator is liable to be set aside on the ground that the same\nis contrary to the Public Policy and also there is patent illegality\nin the findings of the learned Arbitrator. Further, I make it clear\nthat I have discussed only about the findings given by the\nlearned Arbitrator in the light of the contentions taken by both\nparties without re-appreciating the oral or documentary\nevidence placed before the Learned Arbitrator. All my findings\nare based on the legal aspects and the development of case\nlaw on the said subject. When such being the case, I have no\nother option except to set aside the entire Award passed by the\nlearned Arbitrator. Therefore, I answer this Point in the\n\"Affirmative\".\nCom.AS.No.73/2011\n\n79. Point No. 2 :- Therefore, I proceed to pass the\nfollowing Order.\n\nORDER\nThe Petition filed under\nSection 34\nof\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,\nis allowed.\n\nThe Arbitral Award dated 18.06.2011 is\nhereby set-aside.\n\nThe 1st Defendant shall pay the cost of\nthis proceeding to the Plaintiff.\n\nThe Office is directed to send copy of\nthis judgment to both parties to their\nemail ID as required under Order XX Rule\n1 of the Civil Procedure Code read with\n\nSection 16\nof the Commercial Courts Act.\n\n(Dictated to the Stenographer typed by her, corrected and\nthen pronounced by me in open Court on this the 16th day\nof August 2021.).\n\n(DEVARAJA BHAT.M),\nLXXXII Addl.
