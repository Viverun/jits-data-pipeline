No. 294 of 2014\nWith\nCAN 5 of 2023\nWith\nCAN 7 of 24\nSikha Sarkar\nVersus\nAmitava Chowdhury & Ors.\n\nMr. Siva Prasad Ghosh,\nMs. Srijani Mukherjee\n...For the appellant.\n\n1. Despite notice the respondents are not represented.\n\nThere is an affidavit of service on record.\n\n2. The instant appeal is directed against the judgment\n\nand order dated 11th August, 2014 passed by the\n\nlearned Civil Judge (Senior Division), 2 nd Court at\n\nContai, Purba Medinipur. The said judgment was\n\npassed in four several suits that were heard\n\nanalogously. The said suits are as follows:-\n\nThe Suits\n\n(a) The first suit, is T.S. 14 of 2012 previously 178\n\nof 1998 filed by the appellant Sikha Sarkar\n\nagainst the aforesaid legal heirs of Late Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury respondents and the\n\nAdministrator of Digha Development Scheme\n\n(DDS). She prayed for decree seeking permanent\n\ninjunction against the respondents from\ntransferring the suit property to anyone except\n\nherself.\n\n(b) The second suit being T.S. 15 of 2012 previously\n\n(T.S. 26 of 1999) has been filed by the appellant\n\nSikha Sarkar for declaration against the legal\n\nheirs of the said Sushil Kr. Chowdhury and the\n\nDDS seeking a declaration that she has right\n\ntitle and interest on the whole suit property and\n\nthat the power of attorney dated 13.01.1997 was\n\nvoid and illegal and permanent injunction\n\nrestraining the legal heirs of Sushil Chowdhury\n\nfrom interfering with her peaceful possession of\n\nthe entire suit property and the hotel business.\n\n(c) T.S. 13 of 2012 (previously T.S. 32 of 1999) is\n\nthe third suit, filed by Amitava Chowdhury and\n\nfive others claiming to be the legal heirs of one\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury against the appellant\n\nSikha Sarkar. In the said suit, the\n\nplaintiffs/respondents have prayed for partition\n\nof the suit property and have sought accounts of\n\na hotel called \"Suman Hotel\" situated at the suit\n\nproperty (Land and Building) at Digha (a popular\n\nsea resort in the South Bengal).\n\n(d) The fourth suit being O.S. 16 of 2012 (previously\n\nT.S 134 of 2001) has been filed by Sikha Sarkar\n\nfor transfer of the share of Sushil Kr.\n\nChowdhury in the suit property, in her favour\nby the legal heirs of the said Sushil Kr\n\nChowdhury and the administrator of DDS. She\n\nsought specific performance of the agreement\n\ndated 08.10.1991 against the respondents.\n\nFacts of the Case:\n\n3. The case of the respondents/plaintiffs/legal heirs of\n\nlate Sushil Kumar Chowdhury in the plaint in T.S.\n\n13 of 2012 is, inter alia, as follows,\n\n(a) The father of the respondents Late Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury and Sikha Sarkar the appellant\n\njointly obtained a lease for 99 years, of 20.333\n\ncottahs of land on 24th January, 1985 in plot no.\n\n4 in the Economy Hotel Sector at Digha from the\n\nDigha Development Scheme, now known as\n\nDigha Sankarpur Development Scheme (DPS) for\n\na consideration of Rs. 41,866/- and an annual\n\nrent of Rs. 1/-. The said lease was to enable the\n\nsaid Sushil Kumar Chowdhury and Sikha\n\nSarkar to construct an economy hotel.\n\n(b) The said Sushil Kumar Chowdhury and Sikha\n\nSarkar allegedly jointly constructed the said\n\nhotel.\n\n(c) The said Sushil Kumar Chowdhury died\n\nintestate on 17th July, 1992 leaving behind the\n\nrespondents/ plaintiffs as his legal heirs. The\n\nsaid respondents/plaintiffs/legal heirs being\n\nresidents of Kharda District- 24 Parganas,\nentrusted Sikha Sarkar alone to run and\n\nmanage the affairs of the hotel, and pay their\n\nshare of profits after maintaining accounts, at\n\nthe end of each English calendar year.\n\n(d) Sikha Sarkar allegedly taking advantage of the\n\nabsence of the plaintiffs, constructed a second\n\nfloor at the hotel without knowledge or consent\n\nof the plaintiffs, or without obtaining proper\n\nsanction from the DDS.\n\n(e) The said Sikha Sarkar allegedly misappropriated\n\nthe share of profits of the plaintiffs and did not\n\nrender accounts of income and expenditure of\n\nthe said hotel to the plaintiffs/respondents.\n\n(f) On 13th January, 1997 the legal heirs executed a\n\npower of attorney in favour of one Sankar Sarkar\n\nto obtain their father, Sushil's share of the\n\nSouthern portion of the property and construct\n\nanother hotel there at.\n\n(g) The said legal heirs/plaintiffs/respondents\n\nprayed for accounts for six years preceding the\n\nsuit and have also prayed for partition of the\n\nsuit property. Partition was sought of the half\n\nshare of the suit property of their father from\n\nthat of Sikha's share.\n\n4. The defendant/appellant herein filed the written\n\nstatement and denied all the allegations in the\n\nplaint. In the three suits filed by Sikha Sarkar\nagainst the respondents/plaintiffs/legal heirs of\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury, she contended as\n\nfollows.\n\n(a) The said Sushil Kumar Chowdhury was only a\n\njoint applicant for the purpose of application of\n\nlease before the Digha Development Authority\n\n(DDS).\n\n(b) The premium/salami of Rs. 41,866/- for the\n\nlease was, however, paid in equal share by\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury and Sikha Sarkar to\n\nthe DDS.\n\n(c) Sikha Sarkar has been paying annual rent to\n\nDDS in her name since 1986.\n\n(d) The hotel and the property, namely, Hotel\n\nSuman, was constructed entirely by her from\n\nher own funds, sometime in 1985.\n\n(e) The construction plan for the hotel was prepared\n\nand the entire expenses for obtaining the\n\nestimate and engagement of workers and\n\npurchase of construction material was done\n\nexclusively by her from her own funds.\n\n(f) Sanction for the plan for construction of the\n\nhotel was applied jointly by herself and Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury and sanctioned 1988 as they\n\nwere joint lessees.\n(g) Sikha Sarkar obtained a Sarai licence for\n\nrunning the hotel in her name, albeit since the\n\nyear 1996.\n\n(h) The telephone and electricity bills of the said\n\nhotel were and are in her name.\n\n(i) The municipal/panchayat tax including the\n\ntrade license and other statutory compliances\n\nwere paid and/or obtained exclusively in the\n\nname of Sikha Sarkar.\n\n(j) The aforesaid construction and obtaining of\n\ndocuments and licenses above in the sole name\n\nof Sikha Sarkar was done with the knowledge,\n\nconsent and concurrence of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury.\n\n(k) Sushil Kumar Chowdhury had never\n\nparticipated nor was at all connected with\n\nestablishment and running of the hotel. He\n\nhardly ever visited the said hotel Suman except\n\non two occasions since 1986.\n\n(l) There was a mutual partition between Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury and Sikha Sarkar of the\n\nleasehold land and suit property. The hotel was\n\nconstructed exclusively on the portion of Sikha\n\nSarkar on the northern portion of the property,\n\nwhich fell into the share of Sikha Sarkar. Sushil\n\nwas to get the southern portion which is lying\nvacant but was in the exclusive possession of\n\nSikha Sarkar.\n\n(m) Sushil Kumar Chowdhury later agreed on\n\n08.10.1991 to surrender and/or sell his share of\n\nthe southern portion of the leasehold property in\n\nfavor of Sikha Sarkar on payment of Rs. 1 lakh.\n\n(n) Sikha Sarkar has paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- on\n\n08.10.1991 against a written money receipt in\n\nfurtherance of a deed of declaration and\n\nsettlement dated 08.10.1991 by Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury in the presence of witnesses.\n\n(o) A request for sanction of the sub-\n\ndivision/partition Clause 2(d) of the lease deed\n\ndated 24th January, 1985 was made for and\n\nreceived by the DDS.\n\n(p) A power of attorney dated 13.01.1997 executed\n\nby the legal heirs of Sushil Chowdhury in favour\n\nof one Sankar Sarkar would establish, partition\n\nand sub-division of the property and sub-\n\ndivision of suit property between Sushil and\n\nherself. The power of attorney to extent that it\n\nclaims the entire property and hotel is illegal.\n\n(q) Sikha Sarkar was and is still ready and willing\n\nto pay a balance sum of Rs. 90,000/- to Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury and/or his legal heirs\n\ntogether with interest, if necessary.\n5. Based on the pleadings the Court below framed the\n\nfollowing issues:\n\n(a) Whether the suits are maintainable in its\n\npresent form and prayer?\n\n(b) Whether the plaintiff/plaintiffs has/have\n\ncause of action to institute the respective\n\nsuits?\n\n(c) Whether the suits are barred by the\n\nprinciples of estoppel, waiver and\n\nacquiescence?\n\n(d) Whether the suits are barred by defect of\n\nparties?\n\n(e) Whether the parties have right, title and\n\ninterest in the suit property?\n\n(f) Whether the suit property was partitioned\n\nbetween Sushil Kumar Chowdhury and Sikha\n\nSarkar?\n\n(g) Whether Sushil Kumar Chowdhury executed\n\nany agreement for sale or surrender in\n\nrespect of the suit property in favour of Sikha\n\nSarkar?\n\n(h) Whether the plaintiff/plaintiffs is/are entitled\n\nto get the decree as prayed for?\n\n(i) To what other relief, if any, is/are the\n\nplaintiff/plaintiffs (parties) entitled to?\n\n6. On behalf of the legal heirs of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury, Amitava Chowdhury (PW1), the\nplaintiff no. 1 in T.S. 13 of 2012 deposed evidence.\n\nPW/2 was Devendranath Dolui who was a Upper\n\nDivision Clerk attached to the DDS. PW/3,\n\nKalipada Shome was an employee of the\n\nneighboring hotel, \"Samudra Villa\" at Digha.\n\n7. The defendant Sikha Sarkar deposed herself as\n\nDW/1. Madhab Sen, owner of an adjacent hotel\n\ncalled \"Holiday Home\", next door to the Hotel\n\nSuman was DW2. He was also a witness who\n\nsigned on the money receipt and a deed of mutual\n\npartition of the suit property dated 8 th October,\n\n1991. The deed of declaration was, however, not\n\nexhibited in the Court below. It was referred to in\n\ncourse of proceedings at the time of admission of\n\nthe instant appeal before a Division Bench of this\n\nCourt on 7th March, 2000.\n\n8. DW 3 was one Bijay Maisad who was an employee\n\nof the Hotel Suman. He stated that Sikha Sarkar\n\nconstructed the entire hotel and was in exclusive\n\npossession of the entire lease hold property\n\nincluding the vacant southern portion of the\n\nproperty. He assisted Sikha in the construction of\n\nthe hotel. He stated that Sushil and his legal heirs\n\nare not in possession of the suit property.\n\n9. There is no effective cross examination by the\n\nplaintiffs/ respondents, of any of the witnesses\n\nproduced on behalf of the appellant.\nFindings of the Court Below:\n\n10. The Court below found that it had jurisdiction\n\nto entertain all four suits and could be maintained\n\nby all the plaintiffs. The Court also found that the\n\nsuit was not barred by non-joinder of parties. The\n\nCourt also found that the partition of the suit\n\nproperty could not be affected as claimed by the\n\nlegal heirs as there was no proper registered\n\ndocument in this regard.\n\n11. In respect of the claim of Sikha Sarkar that she\n\nalone constructed the entire hotel by 1986 and was\n\nrunning the same to the exclusion of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury, the Court below did not find favour\n\nwith Sikha Sarkar. The Court below found that\n\nthere could not have been any construction on the\n\nland, in 1986 as the plan for construction of the\n\nhotel was sanctioned by the DDS in 1988.\n\n12. The Court below found contradiction in the\n\nstand of Sikha Sarkar, inasmuch, as she had\n\npleaded in T.S. 13 of 2012 and 15 of 2012 that\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury agreed to surrender his\n\nshare to her and yet in T.S. 14 of 2012 and O.S. 16\n\nof 2012 contended that Sushil Kumar Chowdhury\n\nagreed to sell his share to her. The prayer of\n\nspecific performance was held not maintainable.\n\n13. The Court below disbelieved the money receipt\n\nof Rs. 10,000/- was part payment by Sushil Kumar\nChowdhury towards any agreement of sale. There\n\nwas no agreement according to the Court below\n\nthat could be inferred from a money receipt alone.\n\n14. The alleged power of attorney dated 13.01.1997\n\nexecuted by the legal heirs of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury in favour of Sankar Sarkar was equally\n\nheld not proved by Sikha Sarkar as the original was\n\nnot produced.\n\n15. The Court below thereafter proceeded to hold that\n\nSikha Sarkar undertook unauthorized construction\n\non the second floor on the hotel. Based entirely on\n\na cash receipt of Rs. 1 issued by the DDS dated 2 nd\n\nMay, 2013 in the name of \"Smt. Sikha Sarkar and\n\nothers\", towards annual payment of lease rent the\n\nCourt below came to the conclusion that lease rent\n\nfor the entire plot was being paid in the joint names\n\nSushil and Sikha.\n\n16. The Court therefore found the rights of the legal\n\nheirs of Sushil in the suit property. The\n\nplaintiffs/respondents/legal heirs of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury were treated as joint lessees along with\n\nSikha Sarkar. The partition of the entire suit\n\nproperty including the hotel was, therefore, allowed\n\nbetween the plaintiff no. 1 to 6 in T.S.13 of 2012\n\nand the said Sikha Sarkar.\n\n17. The Court below also held that Sikha Sarkar\n\nwas liable to render accounts for the business of\nthe hotel Suman to the legal heirs of late Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury.\n\nAnalysis of this Court:\n\n18. This Court has carefully considered the oral\n\nevidence adduced by the parties and the\n\ndocumentary evidence brought on record through\n\ntheir respective witnesses.\n\n19. This Court finds that the Court below has\n\nmisdirected itself in analyzing the evidence and has\n\nnot therefore correctly applied the decisions of the\n\nSupreme and other court referred by it. The court\n\nbelow has ignored the vital evidence that has come\n\non record.\n\n20. There is ample evidence on record to suggest\n\nthat the hotel was constructed and was in operation\n\nsince 1986. It was for the DDS to have taken steps\n\nagainst Sikha for any construction or commencing\n\nbusiness without sanction. No evidence has been\n\nproduced by the parties that the DDS has taken any\n\nsuch action.\n\n21. In the absence of the same the Court below\n\ncould not have ignored the evidence on record and\n\ncome to any finding that there was no construction\n\nbefore 1988.\n\n22. This Court finds that the evidence of Amitava\n\nChowdhury could not have been given any credence\nwhatsoever by the Court below. The said evidence is\n\ncontradictory and self-defeating for the following\n\nreasons:-\n\n(a) While PW/1 has stated that his father had\n\nobtained a Serai licence in his favour until 1986,\n\nhe could not produce any document to that\n\neffect. On the contrary, in cross-examination, he\n\nhas admitted that it was not possible for him to\n\nsay that there was a ferrule connection or a\n\nSaraya licence obtained by his father.\n\n(b) PW 1 has stated in examination in chief that his\n\nfather had contributed to the construction of the\n\nhotel withdrawing the same from his post office\n\nat Digha. He could not produce any documents\n\nto that effect. In his examination he also stated\n\nthat his father paid a sum of Rs. 2.25 lakhs to\n\nSikha Sarkar for construction of the hotel.\n\n(c) In cross-examination, however, he could not\n\neven recollect the quantum of money allegedly\n\npaid by his father to Sikha Sarkar. He has also\n\nstated in cross-examination that he could not\n\nrecollect the source of money from where his\n\nfather had paid Sikha.\n\n(d) He did not have any documents as regards\n\nincome tax returns of his father. He also could\n\nnot produce any document to show that his\n\nfather ever demanded or received any share of\nprofits of the hotel from Sikha Sarkar during his\n\nlife time.\n\n(e) PW/1 chose to refer to the lease deed dated 24 th\n\nJanuary, 1985 as a partnership deed in his\n\ncross-examination whereas no such partnership\n\ndeed in fact exists.\n\n23. The case of the plaintiffs/legal heirs of late\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury for accounts ought to\n\nhave been thrown out on the basis of the aforesaid\n\ncontradictory evidence of PW/1. No decree for\n\naccounts of the hotel could have been given to the\n\nplaintiffs in T.S. 13 of 2012.\n\n24. PW/2 is an Upper Division Clerk who has\n\nstated that the share of Sushil Kumar Chowdhury\n\nand the share of Sikha Sarkar was divided equally\n\nby Digha Development Scheme. He also stated that\n\nthe request of partition and sub-division, in writing\n\nof Sikha and Sushil was received and acknowledged\n\nby the DDS by a separate letter in writing. The said\n\nevidence would lend credence to the claim of parties\n\nthat there was a partition/division, albeit private, of\n\nthe suit property between herself and Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury.\n\n25. Admittedly, the evidence on record clearly\n\nestablishes that the hotel in question is constructed\n\non the northern portion of the suit property, within\n\nthe share of Sikha Sarkar. The southern portion of\nthe property, in favour of Sushil Kumar Chowdhury\n\neven as on date, remains vacant.\n\n26. One must now notice the examination-in-chief\n\nand cross-examination and the documents brought\n\non record by Sikha Sarkar DW/1.\n\n(a) She obtained a Saraya licence in her name in\n\nthe year 1996.\n\n(b) The telephone and electricity bills for the hotel\n\nstanding in her name.\n\n(c) She paid annual rent until the year 2013 under\n\nthe lease agreement in her own name.\n\n(d) The telephone and electricity bills for the hotel\n\nwere in the name of Sikha Sarkar.\n\n(e) The estimate for construction of the hotel was\n\nobtained from an architect by Sikha Sarkar in\n\n1985 and purchased materials for construction\n\nin 1986. The hotel was constructed in 1986-86.\n\n(f) She has entered into a lease agreement with\n\nAllahabad bank on 20th February, 1992 for\n\nleasing the hotel to their employees.\n\n(g) She entered into further lease agreement on 22 nd\n\nSeptember, 1998 with M/s Indian Airlines to\n\nlease its hotel for their employees.\n\n(h) She has also brought on record a letter\n\naddressed to the Digha Development Authority\n\ndated 5th February, 1986 for division of the suit\n\nproperty between herself and Sushil Kumar\nChowdhury that is duly received by the DDS.\n\nThe DDS has acknowledge receipt of the same\n\nby a separate letter in writing.\n\n27. The above evidence demonstrates that Sikha\n\nSarkar is the one who paid the periodical rent, not\n\nSushil. The status of Sushil Chowdhury at best can\n\nbe termed as a one-time creditor who contributed 50\n\npercent of the one-time payment made towards the\n\nlease consideration. He, however, was never a lessee.\n\nThis court however cannot be unmindful of the fact\n\nthat there is a mutual partition between Sikha and\n\nSushil, which to a large extent vindicates the status\n\nof Sushil as a co-lessee in spite of non-payment of\n\nthe annual rent by him.\n\n28. The aforesaid evidence also clearly proves that\n\nSikha Sarkar had constructed the Hotel entirely on\n\nher own. She had managed the Hotel from 1986\n\nuntil 2013 and does so even today, exclusively on\n\nher own. Sushil Kumar Chowdhury was never ever\n\ninvolved in either construction of the Hotel or its\n\nrunning financially or otherwise. He, for all intents\n\nand purposes, in furtherance of the private\n\npartition of the suit property, allowed Sikha Sarkar\n\nnot only to construct the Hotel but also to run the\n\nsame, bear expenses and liabilities for the same\n\nand exclusively enjoy its profits, without any\n\ndemand or claim whatsoever.\n29. The legal heirs of Sushil having failed to establish\n\nany co-lesseeship between Sushil and Sikha, their\n\nsuit for partition should have been dismissed given\n\nthe dicta of the Supreme Court in\nH. Vasanthi v.\n\nA. Santha\n, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 998.\n\n30. However, since there is a mutual partition arrived\n\nat between Sikha and Sushil, there is an explicit\n\nacceptance of the fact by Sikha that Sushil indeed\n\nused to have an interest in the suit property.\nIn\nH.\n\nVasanthi\n(supra), the court held:\n\n14. The argument of learned Counsel for the\nplaintiff lays substantial emphasis on the statutory\nrecognition of status as a coparcener to an\nunmarried daughter by\nSection 29A\nof the Hindu\nSuccession Act and that the plaintiff is a non-\n\nexecutant and, therefore, the plaintiff's share in the\ncoparcenary is available for partition. Briefly\nstated, the applicability of Section 29A is not the\ndeciding factor but the deciding factor in the case\non hand is whether the suit property is available for\npartition. The crucial circumstance is whether\nthe plaint schedule has the status or standing\nof a coparcenary property and is available for\npartition. The High Court, having examined each\none of the relevant circumstances, found that the\nproperty is not available partition as of the date of\ncoming into force of Section 29A of the State\nAmendment and dismissed the appeal. We have\nperused the Judgment and concur with the\nfindings.\n\n16. Exhibit A3 is a partial partition deed containing\nthree schedules. Schedule-I covers the entire\nproperty, i.e., the total extent covered by premises\nbearing No. 68 corresponding to new No. 24, G.N.\nChetty Road, T. Nagar, Madras, has five grounds\nand 1185 square feet. The partial partition\nallocated the property in Schedule-A to Defendants\n1 and 2 and Schedule B to the parties of the second\npart, i.e., the plaintiff herein. The plaintiff accepted\nthe property given in the 'B' Schedule. In this\naspect, the plaintiff has admitted that the present\nsuit schedule property belongs to the first and\nsecond defendants and has taken separate\npossession of the 'B' Schedule in Exhibit-A3 partial\npartition. Plaintiff does not take steps to assail\nExhibit-A3 in the manner known to law but\nproceeds to assume contrary to a clear\nunderstanding and claims partition. We are\nconscious that the factum of division is decided by\nthe cumulative effect of all attending circumstances\nproved by the parties. Either the previous partition\nor separate ownership of any property is accepted\non the evidence placed on record by the parties. In\nthe case on hand, the plaintiff is legally obliged to\ndischarge the burden that the plaint schedule is not\nonly a coparcenary but continued to be so even as\nof 25.03.1989 and that the plaintiff is entitled to\nenforce the claim for partition. Let us examine\nwhether the plaintiff discharged the burden on the\nabove touchstone....\"\n\n31. Therefore, what is required to be examined is\n\nas to whether such mutual partition sans registration\n\nis valid or not. The need for registration of a partition\n\ndeed may be discerned from\nSection 17\nof the THE\n\nREGISTRATION ACT, 1908\nSec.17\nis set out\n\nhereunder:-\n\n17. Documents of which registration is\ncompulsory.--(1) The following documents shall\nbe registered, if the property to which they relate\nis situate in a district in which, and if they have\nbeen executed on or after the date on which, Act\nNo. XVI of 1864, or the\nIndian Registration Act,\n, or the\nIndian Registration Act, 1871\n, or\nthe\nIndian Registration Act, 1877\n, or this Act\ncame or comes into force, namely:--\n\n(a) ***********\n\n(b) other non-testamentary\ninstruments which purport or operate\nto create, declare, assign, limit or\nextinguish, whether in present or in\nfuture, any right, title or interest,\nwhether vested or contingent, of the\nvalue of one hundred rupees and\nupwards, to or in immovable\nproperty;\n\n(2) Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-\nsection (1) applies to--\n\n(v) [any document other than the\ndocuments specified in sub-section (1A)]\nnot itself creating, declaring, assigning,\nlimiting or extinguishing any right, title or\ninterest of the value of one hundred\nrupees and upwards to or in immovable\nproperty, but merely creating a right to\nobtain another document which will,\nwhen executed, create, declare, assign,\nlimit or extinguish any such right, title or\ninterest; or\n\n32. Therefore the question that falls for\n\nconsideration is whether the mutual partition\n\nbetween Sushil and Sikha has declared, limited, or\n\nextinguished any right in the suit property given the\n\nterms of\nSection 17(1)\n/(b). If the Mutual partition\n\nbetween the two created a right to obtain a further\n\ndocument for declaring and limiting any interest in\n\nimmovable property, then the same would not\n\nrequire registration given the terms of\nSection\n\n17(2)\n/(v) (supra).\n\n33.\nIn\nK. Arumuga Velaiah v. P.R. Ramasamy\n,\n\nreported in (2022) 3 SCC 757 on the need for\n\nregistering a partition deed, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld as follows:-\n\n\"30. Further, reliance was placed in Ram Lal\ncase [\nLachhman Dass v. Ram Lal\n, (1989) 3 SCC 99]\non a decision of the Division Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court in Ramaswamy Ayyar v. Thiru Athi\nNaik [Ramaswamy Ayyar v. Thiru Athi Naik, 1903\nSCC OnLine Mad 87 : ILR (1904) 27 Mad 43] ,\nwherein it was observed that it is necessary to read\na document in order to ascertain, not what the\ndocument intends to convey really but what it\npurports to convey.\n\nIn other words, it is necessary\nto examine not so much what it intends to do, but\nwhat it purports to do. It was further observed in\npara 14 as under : (\nRam Lal\ncase [\nLachhman\nDass v. Ram Lal\n, (1989) 3 SCC 99] , SCC p. 106)\n\n31.\nIn\nRam Lal\ncase [\nLachhman Dass v. Ram Lal\n,\n(1989) 3 SCC 99] , reliance was also placed\non\nRatan Lal Sharma v. Purshottam Harit [Ratan\nLal Sharma\nv. Purshottam Harit, (1974) 1 SCC 671]\nto hold that the arbitration award in the said case\ndid not just seek to assign a share of the\nrespondent to the appellant therein, but made an\nexclusive allotment of the partnership assets\nincluding the factory and liabilities to the appellant\ntherein. Therefore, the award in express words\npurported to create rights in immovable property\nworth a sum above Rs 100 in favour of the\nappellant therein. It was accordingly held that it\nwould mandatorily require registration under\n\nSection 17\nof the Act.\n\n45. Having regard to the aforesaid provisions of law\nit can be safely concluded that the said award was\na mere arrangement to divide the properties in\nfuture by metes and bounds as distinguished from\nan actual deed of partition under which there is not\nonly a severance of status but also division of joint\nfamily properties by metes and bounds in specific\nproperties. Hence it was exempted from registration\nunder\nSection 17(2)(v)\nof the Act. A document of\npartition which provides for effectuating a division\nof properties in future would be exempt from\nregistration under\nSection 17(2)(v)\n. The test in such\na case is whether the document itself creates an\ninterest in a specific immovable property or merely\ncreates a right to obtain another document of title. If\na document does not by itself create a right or\ninterest in immovable property, but merely creates a\nright to obtain another document, which will, when\nexecuted create a right in the person claiming relief,\nthe former document does not require registration\nand is accordingly admissible in evidence\nvide\nRajangam Ayyar v. Rajangam\nAyyar [Rajangam Ayyar\nv. Rajangam Ayyar, 1922\nSCC OnLine PC 52 : AIR 1922 PC 266] .\"\n\n34. It follows from the above that when a partition\n\nallots specific properties to a person then it must be\n\ncompulsorily registered. However, when it creates a\n\nmere right to obtain interest in immovable property\n\nin the future, such document need not be\n\nregistered.\n\n35. Notwithstanding non-registration, the deed\n\nassumes significance from a different point of view\n\nthat is, it records the intention of Sushil and Sikha.\n36. Such intention can be drawn by the court given the\n\nPara no. 25 of\nK Arumuga Velaiah\ncase (Supra):-\n\n\"25. In Siromani v. Hemkumar [Siromani v. Hemku\nmar, (1968) 3 SCR 639 : AIR 1968 SC 1299] , one of\nthe questions raised was whether the validity of a\npartition deed could be challenged as being\ninadmissible in evidence on the ground that it had\nnot been registered as mandated under\nSection\n17(1)(b)\nof the Act. In that case it was held that\nunder the recitals of Ext. D-4 considered therein,\nthere was allotment of specific properties to\nindividual coparceners and the document therefore\nfell within the mischief of\nSection 17(1)(b)\nof the Act\nas it required registration. Hence, the said\ndocument was not admissible in evidence to prove\nthe title of the coparceners to any particular\nproperty or to prove that any particular property\nhad ceased to be joint property. However, document\nExt.\nD-4 considered therein was held to be\nadmissible to prove an intention on the part of the\ncoparceners to become divided in status; in other\nwords, to prove that the parties ceased to be joint\nfrom the date of the instrument vide\nNani\nBai v. Gita Bai Kom Rama Gunge [Nani Bai\nv. Gita\nBai Kom Rama Gunge, 1959 SCR 479 : AIR 1958\nSC 706] . The said judgment is not applicable to the\nfacts of this case.\n\nIn\nH. Vasanthi v. A. Santha\n, 2023 SCC OnLine\nSC 998, it was held as follows:-\n\n15. We are alive to the principle that there\nis no prohibition to effect a partition\notherwise than through an instrument in\nwriting by duly complying with the\nrequirement of law. In other words, the\ndivision may also be effected under a\nsettlement or oral understanding. The\ncircumstances and manner of recognising\nDefendants 1 and 2 as exclusive owners\nare not disclosed by the plaintiff or\nDefendants 1 and 2.\"\n\n37. Therefore, this court can definitely come to a clear\n\nfinding of the intention of Sushil and Sikha to an\n\namicable and a mutual partition of the suit\n\nproperty. Non-registration of the agreement dated\n\n8th October, 1991 therefore cannot stand in the way\n\nfor decree for partition. Promissory estoppel would\n\nalso operate against Sikha in this regard.\n38. This Court notes from Clause 2(d) of the lease\n\ndeed that sub-division of the leasehold land, is\n\npermissible subject to the permission of the DDS.\n\nAn application to this effect has been made to\n\nDigha Development Authority, receipt whereof is\n\nconfirmed by PW-2.\n\n39. In so far Sushil's intension to sell his share in\n\nthe property to Sikha could be inferred from the\n\nfollowing evidence that has come on record.\n\n(a) The letter of partition dated 5 th February 1986\n\naddressed to the Administrator jointly by Sikha\n\nand Sushil and receipt of the same by the DDS\n\non 16th April 1986.\n\n(b) The Deed of Declaration and settlement dated\n\n8th October 1991 at Annexure - H Page 551 of\n\nPart-II of the Paper Book referred to by the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court.\n\n(c) Sikha constructed the hotel only in her portion\n\nof the property that is the northern part of the\n\nsuit land.\n\n(d) The portions of Sushil's part i.e. southern side\n\nof the property is lying vacant and in the\n\nexclusive possession of Sikha.\n\n(e) The legal heirs of Sushil have themselves\n\nclaimed partition of the property and have\n\ndemanded Sushil's share.\n(f) The power of attorney dated 13.01.1997 has\n\nbeen admitted by PW 1 in his cross\n\nexamination. The Court below therefore erred in\n\ndisbelieving or accepting the same.\n\n(g) By said POA dated 13.01.1997, PW 1 admitted\n\nhaving authorized Sankar Sarkar to take\n\npossession and effect construction of new hotel\n\nin the half share of their father in the southern\n\npart of the property.\n\n(h) The demarcation of the suit land may be\n\npending formal decision and acceptance by\n\nDDS.\n\n40. The money receipt and the evidence of DW-2\n\nMadhav Sen and DW 3 Bijay Maisad assumes\n\nsubstantial importance in the facts of the case. The\n\npayment of Rs.10,000/- and the intention of Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury to surrender his right, title and\n\ninterest in the suit premises against payment of\n\nRs.1,00,000/- would definitely support the stand of\n\nSikha Sarkar. Sushil Kumar Chowdhury had\n\nclearly intended to surrender/sell his\n\nshare/portion/right in the property (Southern half\n\nof the property which is lying vacant till date) to\n\nSikha Sarkar.\n\n41. The Court below has not even discussed and has\n\ncompletely ignored the evidence of DW2 Madhab\n\nSen and DW 3 Bijay Maisad. Madhab Sen has\nstated that he was present and signed as a witness\n\nto the money receipt of Rs.10,000/- paid by Sikha\n\nto Sushil on 08.10.1991. He has identified the\n\nsignatures of Sushil and the other witnesses and\n\nthat of Sikha on the said receipt.\n\n42. Indeed, it is unusual that there are witnesses on a\n\nmoney receipt. However, if this fact is read together\n\ncoupled with the deed of declaration and settlement\n\ndated 08.10.1991 (placed before a Division Bench\n\non 7th March 2000), the case of Sikha Sarkar that\n\nthere was an agreement to sell and/or surrender\n\nthe southern portion of the suit property by Sushil\n\nto Sikha is clearly established. The said fact is\n\nfurther supported by the power of attorney dated\n\n13th January 1997 admitted by PW1 Amitabha\n\nChowdhury in cross examination.\n\n43. DW 3 Bijay Maisad, an employee of the said\n\nhotel suman, has said that the hotel is constructed\n\non the Northern part of the suit plot and the vacant\n\nsouthern part is in the exclusive possession of\n\nSikha Sarkar. He also said that the Chowdhury\n\nfamily was not ever in possession of the property.\n\n44. This Court therefore orders that the agreement\n\ndated 08.10.1991 bearing the signatures of Sushil\n\nChowdhury, Madhab Sen, Sikha Sarkar and the\n\npower of attorney dated 13 th January, 1997 referred\n\nby Sikha Sarkar and admitted by Amitabha\nChowdhury should have been marked as exhibits\n\nby the court below. The said two documents are\n\nmarked as exhibits AA1 and AA2 respectively.\n\nThe Application of the Plaintiffs under Order XLI\n\nRule 27:\n\n45. It is at this juncture that this Court is inclined\n\nto deal with the application under\nOrder XLI Rule\n\n27 of the Code of Civil Procedure\nfiled by the\n\nappellant Sikha Sarkar being CAN 5 of 2023 to\n\nbring on records certain documents in the appeal\n\nthat were hitherto not produced in the trial Court.\n\n46. The said documents are as follows:-\n\n(a) a letter being Post Card dated 20 th April, 1987\n\naddressed by Sushil Kumar Chowdhury to Suman,\n\nson of Sikha Sarkar.\n\n(b) Another handwritten letter dated 21 st July, 1985\n\naddressed to Subrata Sarkar, Sikha Sarkar's\n\nhusband by Sushil Kumar Chowdhury.\n\n(c) Another letter dated 7 th February, 1992 written\n\nin the Bengali vernacular allegedly by Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury.\n\n(d) A deed of declaration and settlement dated 8 th\n\nOctober, 1991 between Sushil Kumar Chowdhury\n\nand Sikha Sarkar.\n\n(e) Although not annexed to the application is\n\nanother letter in original dated 7 th February, 1992\n\nstated to have been written by Sushil Kumar\nChowdhury in the Bengali vernacular addressed to\n\nSikha Sarkar and her husband Subrata Sarkar\n\naffectionately signed as Sushil Da. The said\n\ndocument has been identified by Sikha Sarkar who\n\nis personally present in Court today as to having\n\nbeen received by post and through an employee of\n\nHotel Samudra Villa, who was acting as agent of\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury.\n\n47. This Court is only inclined to take on record the\n\nletters dated 7th February, 1992, 21st May, 1985,\n\nPost Card dated 23rd March, 1992, inland letter in\n\ntwo parts dated 20th March, 1992 and another\n\nwriting of Sushil Kumar Chowdhury. The reasons\n\nfor taking the said documents and marking them as\n\nexhibits, under Order XLI, Rule 27 are, inter alia,\n\nas follows,\n\n(a) There is some evidence already on record in the\n\nCourt below and in the oral evidence of Sikha\n\nSarkar, the contents of the aforesaid documents.\n\nSushil appears to want Sikha to run hotel on\n\nher own and had no interest in the business or\n\nthe suit property.\n\n(b) The money receipt being Exhibit-A in the Court\n\nbelow constituted an earnest money and/or part\n\npayment of the said agreement between Sikha\n\nSarkar and Sushil Kumar Chowdhury. It\n\nsupports the oral evidence of Sikha Sarkar,\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury intended to,\n\nsurrender and/or sell his portion of the suit\n\nproperty (southern portion) in favour of Sikha\n\nSarkar against a consideration of Rs. 1 lakh.\n\n(c) Despite specific notice of mentioning and listing\n\nof this appeal before this Court and notice of\n\nservice of the application under Order XLI, Rule\n\n27 to the respondents, they have chosen not to\n\nrepresent themselves before this Court. The\n\nrespondents, therefore, had no objection to the\n\naforesaid application under Order XLI, Rule 27.\n\n(d) The nature and condition of the documents\n\nproduced in Court lend credence to the\n\nstatements in the application under Order XLI,\n\nRule 27 that Sikha Sarkar may not have had\n\naccess to these documents or could not produce\n\nthe same despite due diligence at the time of\n\ntrial of the four suits.\n\n48. In the aforesaid circumstances, CAN 5 of 2023\n\nshall stand allowed. Affidavit of service filed in\n\nCourt today is taken on record.\n\n49. The aforesaid documents shall be marked as\n\nExhibits AA3, AA4, AA5, AA6, AA7 and AA8\n\nrespectively.\n\n50. In the backdrop of the above evidence, the\n\nquestion of any business partnership between\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury and Sikha Sarkar, or\ncontribution by Sushil in constructing or running\n\nthe Hotel did not and could not have arisen. The\n\nlegal heirs of Sushil Kumar Chowdhury being the\n\nplaintiffs were, therefore, not entitled to any right or\n\nclaim any share in the Hotel business in the name\n\nand style as \"Hotel Suman\" run exclusively by\n\nSikha Sarkar. In fact, the legal heirs of Sushil\n\nKumar Chowdhury could not produce a shred of\n\nevidence to show that their father ever asked for\n\nany sum of money from Sikha Sarkar out of the\n\nHotel business.\n\n51. The question of any accounts or claim being\n\nmade by the legal heirs of Sushil Kumar\n\nChowdhury against Hotel Suman or the business of\n\nSikha Sarkar at the said Hotel, therefore, does not\n\nand cannot arise. The Court below completely erred\n\nin this regard. The decree passed by the Court\n\nbelow, directing Sikha Sarkar to render account of\n\nthe hotel Suman to the legal heirs of Sushil Kr\n\nChowdhury shall, therefore, stand set aside.\n\n52. Admittedly Sushil's share of the property is in\n\ncontinuous possession of Sikha since 1986. While\n\nthe right of the legal heirs of Sushil in the southern\n\nportion of the property may be existing it would be\n\ncontingent upon several factors.\n\n53. The claim for specific performance of agreement\n\ndated 8th October 1991 and a decree for sale of the\nbalance portion of the property of Sushil in favour\n\nof Sikha Sarkar, is barred by limitation. The\n\nagreement between Sikha and Sushil was in 8 th\n\nOctober, 1991. Sikha has filed the O.S. 134 of 2001\n\n(renumbered as 16 of 2012) more than six years\n\nafter expiry of the period of limitation.\n\n54. However, the law of limitation would not\n\nextinguish a right but only the remedy. Hence one need\n\nto answer as to whether Sikha Sarkar is entitled to a\n\ndeclaration of possession as regards the whole suit\n\nproperty inclusive of the southern portion of the suit\n\nproperty. (T.\nS. 15\nof 2012) The Supreme Court in\n\nGhanshyam v. Yogendra Rathi\n, reported in (2023) 7\n\nSCC 361 has held as follows :-\n\n\"16. Legally an agreement to sell may not be\nregarded as a transaction of sale or a document\ntransferring the proprietary rights in an immovable\nproperty but the prospective purchaser having\nperformed his part of the contract and lawfully in\npossession acquires possessory title which is liable\nto be protected in view of\nSection 53A\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The said\npossessory rights of the prospective purchaser\ncannot be invaded by the transferer or any person\nclaiming under him.\n\n17. Notwithstanding the above as the plaintiff-\nrespondent admittedly was settled with possessory\ntitle in part performance of the agreement to sell\ndated 10.04.2002 and that the defendant-appellant\nhas lost his possession over it and had acquired the\nright of possession under a licence simpliciter,\nexhausted his right to continue in possession after\nthe licence has been determined. Thus, the\ndefendant appellant parted with the possession of\nthe suit property by putting the plaintiff-respondent\nin possession of it under an agreement to sell. The\nplaintiff-respondent in this way came to acquire\npossessory title over the same. The\ndefendantappellant, as such, ceased to be in\npossession of it as an owner rather occupied it as a\nlicencee for a fixed period which stood determined by\nvalid notice, leaving the defendant-appellant with no\nsubsisting right to remain in possession of the suit\npremises.\"\n\n55.\nSection 53A\nof the Transfer of Property Act\nprescribes as follows :-\n\n53A. Part performance.--Where any person contracts\nto transfer for consideration any immoveable\nproperty by writing signed by him or on his behalf\nfrom which the terms necessary to constitute the\ntransfer can be ascertained with reasonable\ncertainty, and the transferee has, in part\nperformance of the contract, taken possession of the\nproperty or any part thereof, or the transferee, being\nalready in possession, continues in possession in\npart performance of the contract and has done some\nact in furtherance of the contract, and the transferee\nhas performed or is willing to perform his part of the\ncontract, then, notwithstanding that or, where there\nis an instrument of transfer, that the transfer has not\nbeen completed in the manner prescribed therefor by\nthe law for the time being in force, the transferor or\nany person claiming under him shall be debarred\nfrom enforcing against the transferee and persons\nclaiming under him any right in respect of the\nproperty of which the transferee has taken or\ncontinued in possession, other than a right expressly\nprovided by the terms of the contract:\n\nProvided that nothing in this section shall affect the\nrights of a transferee for consideration who has no\nnotice of the contract or of the part performance\nthereof.]\n\n56.\nSection 53A\npermits equitable relief provided the\n\nagreement to sell is in writing. This is to ascertain the\n\nterms of the contract with certainty. Therefore even, if\n\nthe agreement to sell cannot be enforced for the laws of\n\nLimitation, the terms of the contract, can be inferred by\n\na Court with certainty. The terms of the agreement can\n\nbe gathered from communication, conduct of the parties\n\nthe money receipt and the other evidence on record.\n\nSikha Sarkar is admittedly in possession of the\n\nimmovable property. Sikha would be entitled to the\n\nbenefit of the\nSection 53A\n.\n57.\nIn\nRanchhoddas Chhaganlal v. Devaji Supdu\n\nDorik\n, reported in (1977) 3 SCC 584 at page 587 the\n\nSupreme Court held as follows :-\n\n\"10. The principal hurdle in the way of the\nrespondent is that the respondent has never been\nready and willing to perform the agreement, as\nalleged by the appellant. The respondent alleged\nthat the consideration for purchase was Rs 12,000.\nThe respondent has never been ready and willing to\nperform the agreement alleged by the appellant.\nThe respondent relied on the doctrine of part-\nperformance. One of the limbs of part performance\nis that the transferee has in the part performance of\nthe contract taken possession of the property. The\nmost important consideration here is the contract.\nThe true principle of the operation of the acts of part\nperformance seems to require that the act in\nquestion must be referred to some contract and\nmust be referred to the alleged one; that they prove\nthe existence of some contract, and are consistent\nwith the contract alleged. The doctrine of part\nperformance is a defence. It is a shield and not a\nsword. It is a right to protect his possession against\nany challenge to it by the transferor contrary to the\nterms of the contract. The appellant is right in the\ncontention that there was never any performance in\npart by the respondent of the contract between the\nparties.\"\n\n58.\nIn\nD.S. Parvathamma v. A. Srinivasan\n, (2003)\n\n4 SCC 705 , the following was held :-\n\n\"6. The essential features of the equitable doctrine\nof part-performance as statutorily modified and\nincorporated in\nSection 53-A\nabovesaid, to the\nextent relevant for the purposes of this case, are : (i)\nthat the transferee has, in part-performance of the\ncontract, taken possession of the property or any\npart thereof, or the transferee, being already in\npossession, continues in possession in part-\nperformance of the contract and has done some act\nin furtherance of the contract, (ii) that the transferee\nhas performed or is willing to perform his part of the\ncontract, and (iii) that the plea of part-performance\nis not available to be raised against a transferee for\nconsideration who has no notice of the contract or of\nthe part-performance thereof.\n\n12. Strong reliance was placed by the learned\nSenior Counsel for the appellant on a recent\ndecision of this Court in\nShrimant Shamrao\nSuryavanshi v. Pralhad Bhairoba\nSuryavanshi\n[(2002) 3 SCC 676] wherein this Court\nhas held that a person obtaining possession of the\nproperty in part-performance of an agreement of\nsale, can defend his possession in a suit for\nrecovery of possession filed by the transferor or by\nthe subsequent transferee of the property claiming\nunder him, even if a suit for specific performance of\nthe agreement of sale has become barred by\nlimitation. (emphasis supplied) Clearly it was a\ncase where the person-in-possession was so\ninducted in part-performance of the agreement of\nsale. Excepting that his suit had gone barred by\nlimitation there was nothing else to deny the benefit\nof the plea to the person-in-possession. The Court\nproceeded on the reasoning that the law of\nlimitation barred the remedy but did not bar the\ndefence. The distinguishing features of that case\nare that : (i) it was admitted that the transferee had\ntaken possession over the property in part-\nperformance of the contract, (ii) that the transferee\nhad not brought any suit for specific performance of\nthe agreement to sell, and (iii) the transferee was\nalways and still ready and willing to perform his\npart of the contract.\n\nThese three significant factual\nfeatures are missing in the case before us and\ntherefore the appellant's effort to find support from\nthe authority of\nShrimant Shamrao Suryavanshi\n\ncase [(2002) 3 SCC 676] must fail. Bar of limitation\nalone does not bar the plea of part-performance\nbeing raised if all other requisites of\nSection 53-A\nof\nthe TP Act are available.\"\n\n59. Therefore the fact that her suit for specific\n\nperformance of contract is barred by limitation would\n\nnot disentitle Sikha Sarkar from equitable relief under\n\nSection 53A\n.\n\n60. This Court holds that there was a partition of the\n\nSuit property between Sushil and Sikha. The\n\nSouthern portion of the property belongs to Sushil and\n\nthe northern portion was that of Sikha. There shall be\n\na decree to that effect. However the Southern portion of\n\nthe suit portion being the share of the legal heirs of\n\nSushil Kumar Chowdhury shall be subject to\nSection\n\n53A\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.\n61. Hence there shall be a decree for declaration\n\nthat Sikha Sarkar is in possession of the share of\n\nSushil Chowdhury on the southern of the suit\n\nproperty.\n\n62. The impugned judgment and decree dated 11 th\n\nAugust, 2014 is set aside.\n\n63. The appeal is allowed to the extent and in the\n\nmanner indicated hereinabove.\n\n64. Let the LCRs and added exhibits be sent back to\n\nthe Court below.\n\n65. There shall be no order as to costs.\n\n66. Urgent photostat certified copy of this order, if\n\napplied for, be given to the parties upon compliance\n\nof all formalities.\n\n(Rajasekhar Mantha, J.)\n\n(Ajay Kumar Gupta, J.)",
