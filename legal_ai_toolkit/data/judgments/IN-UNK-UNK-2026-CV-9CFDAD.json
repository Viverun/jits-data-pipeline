AGRAWAL,A.K. MATHUR & DALVEER BHANDARI\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nDalveer Bhandari, J\n\n This appeal is directed against the judgment of the \nAllahabad High Court dated 07.07.2003 passed by the \nDivision Bench in First Appeal No.323 of 2003. \n\n The appellant and the respondent are husband and \nwife. The appellant has filed a petition under the \nHindu \nMarriage Act, 1955\n for divorce. The Family Court after \ncomprehensively dealing with the matter ordered \ncancellation of marriage between the parties under \n\nSection 13\n of the Hindu Marriage Act which was \nsolemnized on 20.11.1975 and directed the appellant to \npay Rs.5 lacs as her livelihood allowance. The appellant \ndeposited the amount as directed.\n\n The respondent aggrieved by the said judgment \npreferred First Appeal before the Division Bench of the \nAllahabad High Court. After hearing the parties the \nappeal was allowed and the decree passed by the Family \nCourt, Kanpur City seeking divorce and annulment of the \nmarriage was dismissed.\n\n The appellant aggrieved by the said judgment of the \nHigh Court had preferred special leave petition under \n\nArticle 136\n of the Constitution of India. This Court \ngranted special leave to appeal to the appellant. \n\n Brief facts which are necessary to dispose of this \nappeal are recapitulated. \n\n The appellant, Naveen Kohli got married to Neelu \nKohli on 20.11.1975. Three sons were born out of the \nwedlock of the parties. The appellant constructed three \nfactories with the intention of providing a separate \nfactory for his three sons. He also constructed bungalow \nno.7/36 A for their residence. The parties got all their \nthree sons admitted and educated in a public school in \nNanital. According to the appellant, the respondent is \nbad tempered and a woman of rude behaviour. After \nmarriage, she started quarrelling and misbehaving with \nthe appellant and his parents and ultimately, the \nappellant was compelled to leave the parental residence \nand started to reside in a rented premises from May \n1994. According to the version of the appellant, the \nrespondent in collusion with her parents got sufficient \nbusiness and property transferred in her name.\n\n The appellant alleged that in the month of May \n1994, when he along with the respondent and their \nchildren visited Bombay to attend the golden jubilee \nmarriage anniversary of his father-in-law, he noticed that \nthe respondent was indulging in an indecent manner and \nfound her in a compromising position with one Biswas \nRout. Immediately thereafter, the appellant started living \nseparately from the respondent since May 1994. The \nappellant suffered intense physical and mental torture.\n\n According to the appellant, the respondent had \nwithdrawn Rs.9,50,000/- from the Bank Account of the \nappellant and deposited the same in her account.\n\n The appellant alleged that the respondent got a false \nfirst information report registered against him under \n\nSections 420\n/\n467\n/\n468\n and \n471\n IPC which was registered \nas Case No.156 of 1995. According to him, the \nrespondent again got a case under \nSections 323\n/\n324\n \nI.P.C. registered in the police station Panki, Kanpur City \nand efforts were made to get the appellant arrested.\n\n The appellant filed a Civil Suit No. 1158/1996 \nagainst the respondent. It was also reported that the \nappellant was manhandled at the behest of the \nrespondent and an FIR No.156 of 1996 was filed by the \neldest son at the behest of the respondent against the \nappellant in police station, Panki complaining that the \nappellant had physically beaten her son, Nitin Kohli.\n\n The respondent in her statement before the Trial \nCourt had mentioned that she had filed an FIR against \nthe appellant under \nSection 420\n/\n468\n IPC at the Police \nStation, Kotwali and the respondent had gone to the \nextent of filing a caveat in the High Court in respect of \nthe said criminal case so that the appellant may not \nobtain an order from the High Court against her filing the \nsaid FIR.\n\n In the same statement, the respondent had \nadmitted that she had filed an FIR No.100/96 at the \nPolice Station, Kohna under \nSection 379\n/\n323\n IPC against \nthe appellant. \n\n The respondent had also filed a complaint against \nthe appellant and his mother under \nSections \n498A\n/\n323\n/\n504\n/\n506\n IPC at Police Station, Kohna. \n\n The respondent in her statement had admitted that \nshe had opposed the bail of the appellant in the criminal \ncase filed at the Police Station, Kotwali on the basis of \nlegal advice. In that very statement she further admitted \nthat after the police had filed final report in both the \ncriminal cases relating to Police Station, Kotwali and \nPolice Station, Kohna, she had filed protest petition in \nthose cases. \n\n This clearly demonstrates the respondent's deep \nand intense feeling of revenge. The respondent in her \nstatement had also admitted that she had filed a \ncomplaint in the Women Cell, Delhi in September 1997. \nAccording to the appellant, the respondent had filed a \ncomplaint no.125 of 1998 against the appellant's lawyer \nand friend alleging criminal intimidation which was \nfound to be false.\n\n According to the appellant, the respondent filed a \nforged complaint under \nsections 397\n/\n398\n of the \nCompanies Act before the Company Law Board, New \nDelhi and in the affidavit of the respondent she stated \nthat the appellant was immoral, alcoholic, and was \nhaving affairs with numerous girls since marriage. She \nalso called him a criminal, infidel, forger and her \nmanager to denigrate his position from the proprietor to \nan employee of her company.\n\n The appellant also mentioned that the respondent \nfiled a false complaint in Case No.1365 0f 1988 using all \nkinds of abuses against the appellant. \n\n On 8.7.1999, the respondent filed a complaint in \nthe Parliament Street Police Station, New Delhi and made \nall efforts to ensure the appellant's arrest with the object \nof sending him to jail. The appellant was called to the \npolice station repeatedly and was interrogated by the \npolice and only after he gave a written reply and the \nmatter on scrutiny was found to be false, the appellant \nwith great difficulty was able to save himself from \nimprisonment.\n\n On 31.3.1999 the respondent had sent notice for \nbreaking the Nucleus of the HUF, expressly stating that \nthe Family Nucleus had been broken with immediate \neffect and asking for partition of all the properties and \nassets of the HUF and stating that her share should be \ngiven to her within 15 days. According to the appellant, \nthis act of the respondent clearly broke all relations \nbetween the appellant and the respondent on 31.3.1999. \n\n The respondent had filed a complaint against the \nappellant under \nSection 24\n of the Hindu Marriage Act \ndirecting payment of maintenance during the pendency \nof the case. This was rejected by the Trial Court and she \nlater filed an appeal in the High Court. \n\n The appellant had deposited Rs.5 lacs on Court's \ndirections but that amount was not withdrawn by the \nrespondent. On 22.1.2001 the respondent gave an \naffidavit before the High Court and got non-bailable \nwarrants issued against the appellant. Consequently, \nthe appellant was harassed by the police and ultimately \nhe got the arrest order stayed by the High Court. The \nrespondent admitted in her statement that she got the \nadvertisement published in the English National \nNewspaper 'Pioneer'. The advertisement reads as under :\n\nPUBLIC NOTICE\nBe it known to all that Mr. Naveen \nKohli S/o Mr. Prem Kumar Kohli was \nworking with my Proprietorship firm \nas Manager. He has abandoned his \njob since May 1996 and has not \nresumed duties.\n\nHe is no more in the employment of \nthe firm. Any Body dealing with him \nshall be doing so at his own risk, his \nauthority to represent the firm has \nbeen revoked and none should deliver \nhim orders, cash cheques or drafts \npayable to the firm.\n\nNEELU KOHLI\nSole Proprietor\nM/s NITIN RUBBERS\n152-B, Udyog Nagar,\nKanpur\n\n The respondent in her statement before the Court \ndid not deny the contents of the affidavit but merely \nmentioned that she did not remember whether she called \nthe appellant a criminal, infidel and a forger in the \naffidavit filed before the Company Law Board. \n\n The respondent did not deny her using choicest \nabuses against the appellant but merely stated that she \ndid not remember. \n\n The respondent also filed a contempt petition in the \nCompany Law Board against its order of the Company \nLaw Board dated 25.9.2000 in order to try and get the \nappellant thrown out of the little apartment and urged \nthat the appellant be sent to jail.\n\n Before the Family Court, the respondent stated \nabout solemnization of the marriage with the appellant \non 20.11.1975. In her written statement she had denied \nthe fact that she was either a rude or a quarrelsome lady. \nThe respondent also denied that she had mentally, \nphysically and financially harassed and tortured the \nappellant. She also stated that she never refused \ncohabitation with the appellant. She also denied \nindulging in any immoral conduct. She averred in the \nwritten statement that the appellant has been immorally \nliving with a lady named 'Shivanagi'. \n\n The appellant and the respondent filed a number of \ndocuments in support of their respective cases. On the \nbasis of the pleadings and the documents, the Additional \nPrincipal Judge of Family Court framed the following \nissues :-\n\n\"1. Whether the respondent treated the \nplaintiff with cruelty by registering \nvarious criminal cases, getting the news \npublished and initiating civil \nproceedings?\n\n2. Whether the defendant treated the \nplaintiff with cruelty by her objectionable \nbehaviour as stated in the plaint?\n\n3. Whether respondent has made false \nallegation against the plaintiff? If yes, its \nimpact?\n\n Whether in the presence of plaintiff, the \ndefendant displayed her behaviour with \nDr. Viswas Rout which comes in the \ncategory of immorality as has been stated \nin para 11 of the plaint? If yes, its \nimpact?\n\n4. Whether the petition is not maintainable \non the basis of preliminary objections 1 \nto 3 of the written statement?\n\n5. Whether plaintiff has kept Smt. Shivanagi \nwith him as his concubine? If yes, its \nimpact?\n\n6. Whether suit of the plaintiff is barred by \nthe provisions of \nSection 11\n, C.P.C.?\n\n7. Whether plaintiff is entitled to get the \ndecree of dissolution of marriage against \ndefendant?\n\n8. Whether plaintiff is entitled to get any \nother relief?\"\n\n Issues number 1 & 2 relate to the term 'Cruelty' and \nIssue no. 3 is regarding impact of false allegations levelled \nby the respondent against the appellant. All these three \nissues were decided in favour of the appellant and against \nthe respondent. The learned Trial Court came to a definite \nconclusion that the respondent had filed a very large \nnumber of cases against the appellant and got him \nharassed and tortured by the police. It also declared him \nan employee of the factory of which the respondent is a \nproprietor by getting an advertisement issued in the \nnewspaper. According to findings of the Trial Court, the \nappellant was mentally, physically and financially \nharassed and tortured by the respondent. \n\n The Trial Court framed specific issue whether the \nappellant had kept Smt. Shivangi with him as his \nconcubine. This allegation has been denied by the \nappellant. The respondent had failed to produce any \nwitness in respect of the aforesaid allegation and was \nconsequently not able to prove the same. The Trial \nCourt stated that both parties have levelled allegations of \ncharacter assassination against each other but failed to \nprove them. \n\n The Trial Court stated that many a times efforts \nhave been made for an amicable settlement, but on the \nbasis of allegations which have been levelled by both the \nparties against each other, there is no cordiality left \nbetween the parties and there is no possibility of their \nliving together. According to the Trial court, there was no \npossibility to reconnect the chain of marital life between \nthe parties. Hence, the Trial Court found that there is no \nalternative but to dissolve the marriage between the \nparties. The Trial Court also stated that the respondent \nhad not filed any application for allowing permanent \nmaintenance and Stridhan but, in the interest of justice, \nthe Trial Court directed the appellant to deposit \nRs.5,00,000/- toward permanent maintenance of the \nrespondent. The Trial Court also ordered that a decree of \ndissolution of marriage shall be effective after depositing \nthe payment of Rs.5,00,000/- by the appellant. \nAdmittedly, the appellant had immediately deposited the \nsaid amount.\n\n The respondent, aggrieved by the judgment of the \nPrincipal Judge, Family Court, Kanpur City, preferred the \nfirst appeal before the High Court, which was disposed of \nby a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court.\n\n According to the High Court, the Trial Court had not \nproperly appreciated and evaluated the evidence on \nrecord. According to the High Court, the appellant had \nbeen living with one Shivangi. As per the High Court, the \nfact that on Trial Court's directions the appellant \ndeposited the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- within two days after \nthe judgment which demonstrated that the appellant was \nfinancially well off. The Division Bench of the High Court \nheld that actions of the appellant amounted to \nmisconduct, un-condonable for the purpose of \nSection \n13(1)(a)\n of the Hindu Marriage Act. The appeal was \nallowed and the Trial Court judgment has been set aside. \nThe suit filed by the appellant seeking a decree of divorce \nwas also dismissed. \n\n The appellant preferred a Special Leave Petition \nbefore this Court. We have carefully perused the \npleadings and documents on record and heard the \nlearned counsel appearing for the parties at length. \n\n Both the parties have levelled allegations against \neach other for not maintaining the sanctity of marriage \nand involvement with another person. According to the \nrespondent, the appellant is separately living with \nanother woman, 'Shivanagi'. According to the appellant, \nthe respondent was seen indulging in an indecent \nmanner and was found in compromising position with \none Biswas Rout. According to the findings of the Trial \nCourt both the parties failed to prove the allegations \nagainst each other. The High Court has of course \nreached the conclusion that the appellant was living with \none 'Shivanagi' for a considerable number of years. The \nfact of the matter is that both the parties have been living \nseparately for more than 10 years. Number of cases \nincluding criminal complaints have been filed by the \nrespondent against the appellant and every effort has \nbeen made to harass and torture him and even to put the \nappellant behind the bars by the respondent. The \nappellant has also filed cases against the respondent.\n\n We would like to examine the facts of the case in the \nlight of the settled position of law which has been \ncrystallized by a series of judgments.\n\n In the light of facts and circumstances of this case \nwe would also like to examine the concept of Irretrievable \nBreakdown of Marriage particularly with reference to \nrecently decided cases.\n\nImpact of Physical and Mental Cruelty in Matrimonial \nMatters.\n\n The petition for divorce was filed primarily on the \nground of cruelty. It may be pertinent to note that, prior \nto the 1976 amendment in the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n \ncruelty was not a ground for claiming divorce under the \n\nHindu Marriage Act\n. It was only a ground for claiming \njudicial separation under \nSection 10\n of the Act. By 1976 \nAmendment, the Cruelty was made ground for divorce. \nThe words which have been incorporated are \"as to cause \na reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner \nthat it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to \nlive with the other party\". Therefore, it is not necessary \nfor a party claiming divorce to prove that the cruelty \ntreatment is of such a nature as to cause an \napprehension \u0016 reasonable apprehension that it will be \nharmful or injurious for him or her to live with the other \nparty.\n\n \nThe Court had an occasion to examine the 1976 \namendment in the case of \nN.G. Dastane v. S. Dastane\n \n[(1975) 2 SCC 326: AIR 1975 SC 1534], The Court noted \nthat \"....whether the conduct charges as cruelty is of \nsuch a character as to cause in the mind of the petitioner \na reasonable apprehension that it will be harmful or \ninjurious for him to live with the respondent\".\n\n We deem it appropriate to examine the concept of \n'Cruelty' both in English and Indian Law, in order to \nevaluate whether the appellant's petition based on the \nground of cruelty deserves to be allowed or not.\n\n D. Tolstoy in his celebrate book \"The Law and \nPractice of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes\" (Sixth \nEdition, p. 61) defined cruelty in these words:\n\n \"Cruelty which is a ground for \ndissolution of marriage may be \ndefined as willful and unjustifiable \nconduct of such a character as to \ncause danger to life, limb or health, \nbodily or mental, or as to give rise to \na reasonable apprehension of such a \ndanger.\"\n\n The concept of cruelty in matrimonial matters was \naptly discussed in the English case in Bertram v. Bertram \n[(1944) 59, 60] per Scott, L.J. observed:\n\n \"Very slight fresh evidence is needed \nto show a resumption of the cruelty, \nfor cruelty of character is bound to \nshow itself in conduct and \nbehaviour. Day in and day out, \nnight in and night out.\"\n\nIn Cooper vs. Cooper [(1950) WN 200 (HL)], it was \nobserved as under:\n\n \"It is true that the more serious the \noriginal offence, the less grave need \nbe the subsequent acts to constitute \na revival.\"\n\n Lord Denning, L.J. in Kaslefsky v. Kaslefsky [(1950) \n2 All ER 398, 403] observed as under:\n\n \"If the door of cruelty were opened \ntoo wide, we should soon find \nourselves granting divorce for \nincompatibility of temperament. \nThis is an easy path to tread, \nespecially in undefended cases. The \ntemptation must be resisted lest we \nslip into a state of affairs where the \ninstitution of marriage itself is \nimperiled.\"\n\n \"In England, a view was at one time taken that the \npetitioner in a matrimonial petition must establish his \ncase beyond a reasonable doubt but in Blyth v. Blyth \n[(1966) 1 All ER 524, 536], the House of Lords held by a \nmajority that so far as the grounds of divorce or the bars \nto divorce like connivance or condonation are concerned, \n\"the case like any civil case, may be proved by a \npreponderance of probability\". \n\n \nThe High Court of Australia in \nWright v. Wright\n \n[(1948) 77 CLR 191, 210], has also taken the view that \n\"the civil and not the criminal standard of persuasion \napplies to matrimonial causes, including issues of \nadultery\". The High Court was therefore in error in \nholding that the petitioner must establish the charge of \ncruelty \"beyond reasonable doubt\". The High Court adds \nthat \"This must be in accordance with the law of \nevidence\", but we are not clear as to the implications of \nthis observation.\"\n\n Lord Pearce observed:\n\n\"It is impossible to give a \ncomprehensive definition of cruelty, \nbut when reprehensible conduct or \ndeparture from the normal \nstandards of conjugal kindness \ncauses injury to health or an \napprehension of it, it is, I think, \ncruelty if a reasonable person, after \ntaking due account of the \ntemperament and all the other \nparticular circumstances would \nconsider that the conduct \ncomplained of is such that this \nspouse should not be called on to \nendure it.\n\n * * *\n\n I agree with Lord Merriman \nwhose practice in cases of mental \ncruelty was always to make up his \nmind first whether there was injury \nor apprehended injury to health. In \nthe light of that vital fact the court \nhas then to decide whether the sum \ntotal of the reprehensible conduct \nwas cruel. That depends on \nwhether the cumulative conduct \nwas sufficiently weighty to say that \nfrom a reasonable person's point of \nview, after a consideration of any \nexcuse which this respondent might \nhave in the circumstances, the \nconduct is such that this petitioner \nought not to be called on to endure \nit.\n\n * * *\n The particular circumstances \nof the home, the temperaments and \nemotions of both the parties and \ntheir status and their way of life, \ntheir past relationship and almost \nevery circumstance that attends the \nact or conduct complained of may \nall be relevant.\"\n\n Lord Reid in Gollins v. Gollins [1964 AC 644 : (1963) \n2 All ER 966]:\n\n\"No one has ever attempted to give a \ncomprehensive definition of cruelty \nand I do not intend to try to do so. \nMuch must depend on the \nknowledge and intention of the \nrespondent, on the nature of his (or \nher) conduct, and on the character \nand physical or mental weaknesses \nof the spouses, and probably no \ngeneral statement is equally \napplicable in all cases except the \nrequirement that the party seeking \nrelief must show actual or probable \ninjury to life, limb or health.\n\n The principles of law which have been crystallized \nby a series of judgments of this Court are recapitulated \nas under :-\n\n \nIn the case of \nSirajmohmedkhan \nJanmohamadkhan vs. Harizunnisa Yasinkhan\n \nreported in (1981) 4 SCC 250, this Court stated that the \nconcept of legal cruelty changes according to the changes \nand advancement of social concept and standards of \nliving. With the advancement of our social conceptions, \nthis feature has obtained legislative recognition, that a \nsecond marriage is a sufficient ground for separate \nresidence and maintenance. Moreover, to establish legal \ncruelty, it is not necessary that physical violence should \nbe used. Continuous ill-treatment, cessation of marital \nintercourse, studied neglect, indifference on the part of \nthe husband, and an assertion on the part of the \nhusband that the wife is unchaste are all factors which \nlead to mental or legal cruelty.\n\n \nIn the case of \nSbhoba Rani vs. Madhukar Reddi\n \nreported in (1988) 1 SCC 105, this Court had an occasion \nto examine the concept of cruelty. The word 'cruelty' has \nnot been defined in the \nHindu Marriage Act\n. It has been \nused in \nSection 13(1)(i)(a)\n of the Act in the context of \nhuman conduct or behaviour in relation to or in respect \nof matrimonial duties or obligations. It is a course of \nconduct of one which is adversely affecting the other. \nThe cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or \nunintentional. If it is physical, it is a question of fact and \ndegree. If it is mental, the enquiry must begin as to the \nnature of the cruel treatment and then as to the impact \nof such treatment on the mind of the spouse. Whether it \ncaused reasonable apprehension that it would be \nharmful or injurious to live with the other, ultimately, is \na matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account \nthe nature of the conduct and its effect on the \ncomplaining spouse. There may, however, be cases \nwhere the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and \nper se unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the \ninjurious effect on the other spouse need not be enquired \ninto or considered. In such cases, the cruelty will be \nestablished if the conduct itself is proved or admitted. \nThe absence of intention should not make any difference \nin the case, if by ordinary sense in human affairs, the act \ncomplained of could otherwise be regarded as cruelty. \nIntention is not a necessary element in cruelty. The relief \nto the party cannot be denied on the ground that there \nhas been no deliberate or wilful ill-treatment.\n\n The cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the \ntype of life the parties are accustomed to or their \neconomic and social conditions and their culture and \nhuman values to which they attach importance. Each \ncase has to be decided on its own merits.\n\n The Court went on to observe as under :\n\n \"It will be necessary to bear in mind \nthat there has been marked \nchanged in the life around us. In \nmatrimonial duties and \nresponsibilities in particular, we find \na sea change. They are of varying \ndegrees from house to house or \nperson to person. Therefore, when a \nspouse makes complaint about the \ntreatment of cruelty by the partner \nin life or relations, the court should \nnot search for standard in life. A set \nof facts stigmatized as cruelty in one \ncase may not be so in another case. \nThe cruelty alleged may largely \ndepend upon the type of life the \nparties are accustomed to or their \neconomic and social conditions. It \nmay also depend upon their culture \nand human values to which they \nattach importance. We, the judges \nand lawyers, therefore, should not \nimport our own notions of life. We \nmay not go in parallel with them. \nThere may be a generation gap \nbetween us and the parties. It \nwould be better if we keep aside our \ncustoms and manners. It would be \nalso better if we less depend upon \nprecedents. \n\n Lord Denning said in Sheldon \nv. Sheldon, [1966] 2 All E.R. 257 \n(CA) 'the categories of cruelty are not \nclosed'. Each case may be different. \n\nWe deal with the conduct of human \nbeings who are no generally similar. \n\nAmong the human beings there is \nno limit to the kind of conduct \nwhich may constitute cruelty. New \ntype of cruelty may crop up in any \ncase depending upon the human \nbehaviour, capacity or incapability \nto tolerate the conduct complained \nof. Such is the wonderful (sic) realm \nof cruelty.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nV. Bhagat vs. D. Bhagat\n reported in \n(1994) 1 SCC 337, this Court had occasion to examine \nthe concept of 'mental cruelty'. This Court observed as \nunder:\n\n\"16. Mental cruelty in \nSection \n13(1)\n(i-a) can broadly be defined as \nthat conduct which inflicts upon the \nother party such mental pain and \nsuffering as would make it not \npossible for that party to live with \nthe other. In other words, mental \ncruelty must be of such a nature \nthat the parties cannot reasonably \nbe expected to live together. The \nsituation must be such that the \nwronged party cannot reasonably be \nasked to put up with such conduct \nand continue to live with the other \nparty. It is not necessary to prove \nthat the mental cruelty is such as to \ncause injury to the health of the \npetitioner. While arriving at such \nconclusion, regard must be had to \nthe social status, educational level \nof the parties, the society they move \nin, the possibility or otherwise of the \nparties ever living together in case \nthey are already living apart and all \nother relevant facts and \ncircumstances which it is neither \npossible nor desirable to set out \nexhaustively. What is cruelty in one \ncase may not amount to cruelty in \nanother case. It is a matter to be \ndecided in each case having regard \nto the facts and circumstances of \nthat case. If it is a case of \naccusations and allegations, regard \nmust also be had to the context in \nwhich they were made.\"\n\n \nThe word 'cruelty' has to be understood in the \nordinary sense of the term in matrimonial affairs. If the \nintention to harm, harass or hurt could be inferred by \nthe nature of the conduct or brutal act complained of, \ncruelty could be easily established. But the absence of \nintention should not make any difference in the case. \nThere may be instances of cruelty by unintentional but \ninexcusable conduct of any party. The cruel treatment \nmay also result from the cultural conflict between the \nparties. Mental cruelty can be caused by a party when \nthe other spouse levels an allegation that the petitioner is \na mental patient, or that he requires expert psychological \ntreatment to restore his mental health, that he is \nsuffering from paranoid disorder and mental \nhallucinations, and to crown it all, to allege that he and \nall the members of his family are a bunch of lunatics. \nThe allegation that members of the petitioner's family are \nlunatics and that a streak of insanity runs though his \nentire family is also an act of mental cruelty. \n This Court in the case of \nSavitri Pandey vs. Prem \nChandra Pandey\n reported in (2002) 2 SCC 73, stated \nthat mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse which \ncauses mental suffering or fear to the matrimonial life of \nthe other. \"Cruelty\", therefore, postulates a treatment of \nthe petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable \napprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful \nor injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party. \nCruelty, however, has to be distinguished from the \nordinary wear and tear of family life. It cannot be \ndecided on the basis of the sensitivity of the petitioner \nand has to be adjudged on the basis of the course of \nconduct which would, in general, be dangerous for a \nspouse to live with the other.\n\n In this case, this Court further stated as under:\n\n \n\"9. Following the decision in \nBipinchandra case [AIR 1957 SC \n176] this Court again reiterated the \nlegal position in \nLachman \nUtamchand Kirpalani v. Meena\n [AIR \n1964 SC 40] by holding that in its \nessence desertion means the \nintentional permanent forsaking and \nabandonment of one spouse by the \nother without that other's consent, \nand without reasonable cause. For \nthe offence of desertion so far as the \ndeserting spouse is concerned, two \nessential conditions must be there \n(1) the factum of separation, and (2) \nthe intention to bring cohabitation \npermanently to an end (animus \ndeserendi). Similarly two elements \nare essential so far as the deserted \nspouse is concerned: (1) the absence \nof consent, and (2) absence of \nconduct giving reasonable cause to \nthe spouse leaving the matrimonial \nhome to form the necessary \nintention aforesaid. For holding \ndesertion as proved the inference \nmay be drawn from certain facts \nwhich may not in another case be \ncapable of leading to the same \ninference; that is to say the facts \nhave to be viewed as to the purpose \nwhich is revealed by those acts or by \nconduct and expression of intention, \nboth anterior and subsequent to the \nactual acts of separation.\"\n\nIn this case, this Court further stated that cruelty \ncan be said to be an act committed with the intention to \ncause suffering to the opposite party.\n\nThis Court in the case of Gananth Pattnaik vs. \nState of Orissa reported in (2002) 2 SCC 619 observed \nas under:\n\n \"The concept of cruelty and its effect \nvaries from individual to individual, \nalso depending upon the social and \neconomic status to which such \nperson belongs. \"Cruelty\" for the \npurposes of constituting the offence \nunder the aforesaid section need not \nbe physical. Even mental torture or \nabnormal behaviour may amount to \ncruelty and harassment in a given \ncase.\" \n\n \nThis Court, in the case of \nParveen Mehta vs. \nInderjit Mehta\n reported in (2002) 5 SCC 706, defined \ncruelty as under:\n\n \"Cruelty for the purpose of \nSection \n13(1)\n(i-a) is to be taken as a \nbehaviour by one spouse towards \nthe other, which causes reasonable \napprehension in the mind of the \nlatter that it is not safe for him or \nher to continue the matrimonial \nrelationship with the other. Mental \ncruelty is a state of mind and feeling \nwith one of the spouses due to the \nbehaviour or behavioural pattern by \nthe other. Unlike the case of \nphysical cruelty, mental cruelty is \ndifficult to establish by direct \nevidence. It is necessarily a matter \nof inference to be drawn from the \nfacts and circumstances of the case. \nA feeling of anguish, disappointment \nand frustration in one spouse \ncaused by the conduct of the other \ncan only be appreciated on \nassessing the attending facts and \ncircumstances in which the two \npartners of matrimonial life have \nbeen living. The inference has to be \ndrawn from the attending facts and \ncircumstances taken cumulatively. \nIn case of mental cruelty it will not \nbe a correct approach to take an \ninstance of misbehaviour in \nisolation and then pose the question \nwhether such behaviour is sufficient \nby itself to cause mental cruelty. \nThe approach should be to take the \ncumulative effect of the facts and \ncircumstances emerging from the \nevidence on record and then draw a \nfair inference whether the petitioner \nin the divorce petition has been \nsubject to mental cruelty due to \nconduct of the other.\"\n\n In this case the Court also stated that so many \nyears have elapsed since the spouses parted company. \nIn these circumstances it can be reasonably inferred that \nthe marriage between the parties has broken down \nirretrievably. \n\n \nIn \nChetan Dass vs. Kamla Devi\n reported in (2001) \n4 SCC 250 , this Court observed that the matrimonial \nmatters have to be basically decided on its facts. In the \nwords of the Court:\n\n \"Matrimonial matters are matters of \ndelicate human and emotional \nrelationship. It demands mutual \ntrust, regard, respect, love and \naffection with sufficient play for \nreasonable adjustments with the \nspouse. The relationship has to \nconform to the social norms as well. \nThe matrimonial conduct has now \ncome to be governed by statute \nframed, keeping in view such norms \nand changed social order. It is \nsought to be controlled in the \ninterest of the individuals as well as \nin broader perspective, for \nregulating matrimonial norms for \nmaking of a well-knit, healthy and \nnot a disturbed and porous society. \nThe institution of marriage occupies \nan important place and role to play \nin the society, in general. Therefore, \nit would not be appropriate to apply \nany submission of \"irretrievably \nbroken marriage\" as a straitjacket \nformula for grant of relief of divorce. \nThis aspect has to be considered in \nthe background of the other facts \nand circumstances of the case.\"\n\n \nIn \nSandhya Rani vs. Kalyanram Narayanan\n \nreported in (1994) Supp. 2 SCC 588, this Court reiterated \nand took the view that since the parties are living \nseparately for the last more than three years, we have no \ndoubt in our mind that the marriage between the parties \nhas irretrievably broken down. There is no chance \nwhatsoever of their coming together. Therefore, the \nCourt granted the decree of divorce.\n\n \nIn the case of \nChandrakala Menon vs. Vipin \nMenon\n reported in (1993) 2 SCC 6, the parties had been \nliving separately for so many years. This Court came to \nthe conclusion that there is no scope of settlement \nbetween them because, according to the observation of \nthis Court, the marriage has irretrievably broken down \nand there is no chance of their coming together. This \nCourt granted decree of divorce.\n\n \nIn the case of \nKanchan Devi vs. Promod Kumar \nMittal\n reported in (1996) 8 SCC 90, the parties were \nliving separately for more than 10 years and the Court \ncame to the conclusion that the marriage between the \nparties had to be irretrievably broken down and there \nwas no possibility of reconciliation and therefore the \nCourt directed that the marriage between the parties \nstands dissolved by a decree of divorce.\n\n \nIn \nSwati Verma vs. Rajan Verma\n reported in \n(2004) 1 SCC 123, a large number of criminal cases had \nbeen filed by the petitioner against the respondent. This \nCourt observed that the marriage between the parties \nhad broken down irretrievably with a view to restore good \nrelationship and to put a quietus to all litigations \nbetween the parties and not to leave any room for future \nlitigation, so that they may live peacefully hereafter, and \non the request of the parties, in exercise of the power \nvested in this Court under \nArticle 142\n of the Constitution \nof India, the Court allowed the application for divorce by \nmutual consent filed before it under \nSection 13-B\n of the \nHindu Marriage Act and declared the marriage dissolved \nand granted decree of divorce by mutual consent.\n\n In Prakash Chand Sharma vs. Vimlesh [1995 \nSupp (4) SCC 642], the wife expressed her will to go and \nlive with the husband notwithstanding the presence of \nthe other woman but the husband was not in a position \nto agree presumably because he has changed his position \nby remarriage. Be that as it may, a reconciliation was \nnot possible.\n\n \nIn \nV. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat\n (supra), this Court \nwhile allowing the marriage to dissolve on ground of \nmental cruelty and in view of the irretrievable breakdown \nof marriage and the peculiar circumstances of the case, \nheld that the allegations of adultery against the wife were \nnot proved thereby vindicating her honour and character. \nThis Court while exploring the other alternative observed \nthat the divorce petition has been pending for more than \n8 years and a good part of the lives of both the parties \nhas been consumed in this litigation and yet, the end is \nnot in sight and that the allegations made against each \nother in the petition and the counter by the parties will \ngo to show that living together is out of question and \nrapprochement is not in the realm of possibility. This \nCourt also observed in the concluding part of the \njudgment that:\n\n \"Before parting with this case, we \nthink it necessary to append a \nclarification. Merely because there \nare allegations and counter \nallegations, a decree of divorce \ncannot follow. Nor is mere delay in \ndisposal of the divorce proceedings \nby itself a ground. There must be \nreally some extra- ordinary features \nto warrant grant of divorce on the \nbasis of pleading (and other \nadmitted material) without a full \ntrial. Irretrievable breakdown of the \nmarriage is not a ground by itself. \nBut while scrutinising the evidence \non record to determine whether the \nground(s) alleged is/are made out \nand in determining the relief to be \ngranted, the said circumstance can \ncertainly be borne in mind. The \nunusual step as the one taken by us \nherein can be resorted to only to \nclear up an insoluable mess, when \nthe Court finds it in the interest of \nboth parties.\"\n\n \nAgain in \nA. Jaychandra v. Aneel Kumar\n, (2005) 2 \nSCC 22, a 3 judge Bench of this Court observed that the \nexpression \"cruelty\" has not been defined in the Act. \nCruelty can be physical or mental cruelty which is a \nground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as \nwillful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to \ncause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or \nas to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a \ndanger. The question of mental cruelty has to be \nconsidered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the \nparticular society to which the parties belong, their social \nvalues, status, environment in which they live. Cruelty, \nas noted above, includes mental cruelty, which falls \nwithin the purview of a matrimonial wrong. Cruelty need \nnot be physical. If from the conduct of his spouse same is \nestablished and/or an inference can be legitimately \ndrawn that the treatment of the spouse is such that it \ncauses an apprehension in the mind of the other spouse, \nabout his or her mental welfare then this conduct \namounts to cruelty. In delicate human relationship like \nmatrimony, one has to see the probabilities of the case. \nThe concept, a proof beyond the shadow of doubt, is to be \napplied to criminal trials and not to civil matters and \ncertainly not to matters of such delicate personal \nrelationship as those of husband and wife. Therefore, one \nhas to see what are the probabilities in a case and legal \ncruelty has to be found out, not merely as a matter of \nfact, but as the effect on the mind of the complainant \nspouse because of the acts or omissions of the other. \nCruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be mental. \nIn physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct \nevidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not \nat the same time be direct evidence. In cases where there \nis no direct evidence, Courts are required to probe into \nthe mental process and mental effect of incidents that are \nbrought out in evidence. It is in this view that one has to \nconsider the evidence in matrimonial disputes.\n\n The expression 'cruelty' has been used in relation \nto human conduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct \nin relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties and \nobligations. Cruelty is a course or conduct of one, which \nis adversely affecting the other. The cruelty may be \nmental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is \nphysical, the Court will have no problem in determining \nit. It is a question of fact and degree. If it is mental, the \nproblem presents difficulties. First, the enquiry must \nbegin as to the nature of cruel treatment, second the \nimpact of such treatment in the mind of the spouse, \nwhether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would \nbe harmful or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, \nit is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into \naccount the nature of the conduct and its effect on the \ncomplaining spouse. However, there may be a case where \nthe conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se \nunlawful or illegal. Then the impact or injurious effect on \nthe other spouse need not be enquired into or \nconsidered. \nIn such cases, the cruelty will be established \nif the conduct itself is proved or admitted (See \nSobha \nRani v. Madhukar Reddi\n (1988) 1 SCC 105).\n To constitute cruelty, the conduct complained of \nshould be \"grave and weighty\" so as to come to the \nconclusion that the petitioner spouse cannot be \nreasonably expected to live with the other spouse. It must \nbe something more serious than \"ordinary wear and tear \nof married life\". The conduct taking into consideration \nthe circumstances and background has to be examined \nto reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained \nof amounts to cruelty in the matrimonial law. Conduct \nhas to be considered, as noted above, in the background \nof several factors such as social status of parties, their \neducation, physical and mental conditions, customs and \ntraditions. It is difficult to lay down a precise definition \nor to give exhaustive description of the circumstances, \nwhich would constitute cruelty. It must be of the type as \nto satisfy the conscience of the Court that the \nrelationship between the parties had deteriorated to such \nextent due to the conduct of the other spouse that it \nwould be impossible for them to live together without \nmental agony, torture or distress, to entitle the \ncomplaining spouse to secure divorce. Physical violence \nis not absolutely essential to constitute cruelty and a \nconsistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable \nmental agony and torture may well constitute cruelty \nwithin the meaning of \nSection 10\n of the Act. Mental \ncruelty may consist of verbal abuses and insults by using \nfilthy and abusive language leading to constant \ndisturbance of mental peace of the other party.\n\n The Court dealing with the petition for divorce on \nthe ground of cruelty has to bear in mind that the \nproblems before it are those of human beings and the \npsychological changes in a spouse's conduct have to be \nborne in mind before disposing of the petition for divorce. \nHowever, insignificant or trifling, such conduct may \ncause pain in the mind of another. But before the \nconduct can be called cruelty, it must touch a certain \npitch of severity. It is for the Court to weigh the gravity. It \nhas to be seen whether the conduct was such that no \nreasonable person would tolerate it. It has to be \nconsidered whether the complainant should be called \nupon to endure as a part of normal human life. Every \nmatrimonial conduct, which may cause annoyance to the \nother, may not amount to cruelty. Mere trivial irritations, \nquarrels between spouses, which happen in day-to-day \nmarried life, may also not amount to cruelty. Cruelty in \nmatrimonial life may be of unfounded variety, which can \nbe subtle or brutal. It may be words, gestures or by mere \nsilence, violent or non-violent.\n\n The foundation of a sound marriage is tolerance, \nadjustment and respecting one another. Tolerance to \neach other's fault to a certain bearable extent has to be \ninherent in every marriage. Petty quibbles, trifling \ndifferences should not be exaggerated and magnified to \ndestroy what is said to have been made in heaven. All \nquarrels must be weighed from that point of view in \ndetermining what constitutes cruelty in each particular \ncase and as noted above, always keeping in view the \nphysical and mental conditions of the parties, their \ncharacter and social status. A too technical and hyper-\nsensitive approach would be counter-productive to the \ninstitution of marriage. The Courts do not have to deal \nwith ideal husbands and ideal wives. It has to deal with \nparticular man and woman before it. The ideal couple or \na mere ideal one will probably have no occasion to go to \nMatrimonial Court.\n\n \nIn \nDurga P.Tripathy v. Arundhati Tripathy\n, \n(2005) 7 SCC 353, this Court further observed that \nMarriages are made in heaven. Both parties have crossed \nthe point of no return. A workable solution is certainly \nnot possible. Parties cannot at this stage reconcile \nthemselves and live together forgetting their past as a \nbad dream. We, therefore, have no other option except to \nallow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High \nCourt and affirming the order of the Family Court \ngranting decree for divorce.\n\n In Lalitha v. Manickswamy, I (2001) DMC 679 SC \nthat the had cautioned in that case that unusual step of \ngranting the divorce was being taken only to clear up the \ninsoluble mess when the Court finds it in the interests of \nboth the parties.\n\n Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage\n Irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground \nfor divorce under the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n. \nBecause of the change of circumstances and for covering \na large number of cases where the marriages are virtually \ndead and unless this concept is pressed into services, the \ndivorce cannot be granted. Ultimately, it is for the \nLegislature whether to include irretrievable breakdown of \nmarriage as a ground of divorce or not but in our \nconsidered opinion the Legislature must consider \nirretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for grant \nof divorce under the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n.\n The 71st Report of the Law Commission of India \nbriefly dealt with the concept of Irretrievable breakdown \nof marriage. This Report was submitted to the \nGovernment on 7th April, 1978. We deem it appropriate \nto recapitulate the recommendation extensively. In this \nReport, it is mentioned that during last 20 years or so, \nand now it would around 50 years, a very important \nquestion has engaged the attention of lawyers, social \nscientists and men of affairs, namely, should the grant of \ndivorce be based on the fault of the party, or should it be \nbased on the breakdown of the marriage? The former is \nknown as the matrimonial offence theory or fault theory. \nThe latter has come to be known as the breakdown \ntheory.\n\n In the Report, it is mentioned that the germ of the \nbreakdown theory, so far as Commonwealth countries \nare concerned, may be found in the legislative and \njudicial developments during a much earlier period. The \n(New Zealand) Divorce and Matrimonial Causes \nAmendment Act, 1920, included for the first time the \nprovision that a separation agreement for three years or \nmore was a ground for making a petition to the court for \ndivorce and the court was given a discretion (without \nguidelines) whether to grant the divorce or not. The \ndiscretion conferred by this statute was exercised in a \ncase in New Zealand reported in 1921. Salmond J., in a \npassage which has now become classic, enunciated the \nbreakdown principle in these word:\n\n \"The Legislature must, I think, be \ntaken to have intended that \nseparation for three years is to be \naccepted by this court, as prima \nfacie a good ground for divorce. \nWhen the matrimonial relation has \nfor that period ceased to exist de \nfacto, it should, unless there are \nspecial reasons to the contrary, \ncease to exist de jure also. In \ngeneral, it is not in the interests of \nthe parties or in the interest of the \npublic that a man and woman \nshould remain bound together as \nhusband and wife in law when for a \nlengthy period they have ceased to \nbe such in fact. In the case of such \na separation the essential purposes \nof marriage have been frustrated, \nand its further continuance is in \ngeneral not merely useless but \nmischievous.\"\n\n In the Report it is mentioned that restricting the \nground of divorce to a particular offence or matrimonial \ndisability, causes injustice in those cases where the \nsituation is such that although none of the parties is at \nfault, or the fault is of such a nature that the parties to \nthe marriage do not want to divulge it, yet there has \narisen a situation in which the marriage cannot be \nworked. The marriage has all the external appearances \nof marriage, but none of the reality. As is often put \npithily, the marriage is merely a shell out of which the \nsubstance is gone. In such circumstances, it is stated, \nthere is hardly any utility in maintaining the marriage as \na fagade, when the emotional and other bounds which \nare of the essence of marriage have disappeared. \n\n It is also mentioned in the Report that in case the \nmarriage has ceased to exist in substance and in reality, \nthere is no reason for denying divorce, then the parties \nalone can decide whether their mutual relationship \nprovides the fulfillment which they seek. Divorce should \nbe seen as a solution and an escape route out of a \ndifficult situation. Such divorce is unconcerned with the \nwrongs of the past, but is concerned with bringing the \nparties and the children to terms with the new situation \nand developments by working out the most satisfactory \nbasis upon which they may regulate their relationship in \nthe changed circumstances.\n\n On May 22, 1969, the General Assembly of the \nChurch of Scotland accepted the Report of their Moral \nand Social Welfare Board, which suggested the \nsubstitution of breakdown in place of matrimonial \noffences. It would be of interest to quote what they said \nin their basis proposals:\n\n \"Matrimonial offences are often the \noutcome rather than the cause of \nthe deteriorating marriage. An \naccusatorial principle of divorce \ntends to encourage matrimonial \noffences, increase bitterness and \nwiden the rift that is already there. \nSeparation for a continuous period \nof at least two years consequent \nupon a decision of at least one of the \nparties not to live with the other \nshould act as the sole evidence of \nmarriage breakdown.\"\n\nOnce the parties have separated and the separation has \ncontinued for a sufficient length of time and one of them \nhas presented a petition for divorce, it can well be \npresumed that the marriage has broken down. The court, \nno doubt, should seriously make an endeavour to \nreconcile the parties; yet, if it is found that the \nbreakdown is irreparable, then divorce should not be \nwithheld. The consequences of preservation in law of the \nunworkable marriage which has long ceased to be \neffective are bound to be a source of greater misery for \nthe parties.\n\n A law of divorce based mainly on fault is inadequate \nto deal with a broken marriage. Under the fault theory, \nguilt has to be proved; divorce courts are presented \nconcrete instances of human behaviour as bring the \ninstitution of marriage into disrepute. \n\n We have been principally impressed by the \nconsideration that once the marriage has broken down \nbeyond repair, it would be unrealistic for the law not to \ntake notice of that fact, and it would be harmful to \nsociety and injurious to the interests of the parties. \nWhere there has been a long period of continuous \nseparation, it may fairly be surmised that the \nmatrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage \nbecomes a fiction, though supported by a legal tie. By \nrefusing to sever that tie the law in such cases do not \nserve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows \nscant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties.\n\n Public interest demands not only that the married \nstatus should, as far as possible, as long as possible, and \nwhenever possible, be maintained, but where a marriage \nhas been wrecked beyond the hope of salvage, public \ninterest lies in the recognition of that fact. \n\n Since there is no acceptable way in which a spouse \ncan be compelled to resume life with the consort, nothing \nis gained by trying to keep the parties tied for ever to a \nmarriage that in fact has ceased to exist. \n\n Some jurists have also expressed their \napprehension for introduction of irretrievable breakdown \nof marriage as a ground for grant of the decree of divorce. \nIn their opinion, such an amendment in the Act would \nput human ingenuity at a premium and throw wide open \nthe doors to litigation, and will create more problems \nthen are sought to be solved.\n\n The other majority view, which is shared by most \njurists, according to the Law Commission Report, is that \nhuman life has a short span and situations causing \nmisery cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. A halt \nhas to be called at some stage. Law cannot turn a blind \neye to such situations, nor can it decline to give adequate \nresponse to the necessities arising therefrom.\n\n When we carefully evaluate the judgment of the \nHigh Court and scrutinize its findings in the background \nof the facts and circumstances of this case, then it \nbecomes obvious that the approach adopted by the High \nCourt in deciding this matter is far from satisfactory.\n\nThe High Court ought to have considered the \nrepercussions, consequences, impact and ramifications \nof all the criminal and other proceedings initiated by the \nparties against each other in proper perspective. For \nillustration, the High Court has mentioned that so far as \nthe publication of the news item is concerned, the status \nof husband in a registered company was only that of an \nemployee and if any news item is published, in such a \nsituation, it could not, by any stretch of imagination be \ntaken to have lowered the prestige of the husband. In \nthe next para 69 of the judgment that in one of the news \nitem what has been indicated was that in the company, \nNikhil Rubber (P) Ltd., the appellant was only a Director \nalong with Mrs. Neelu Kohli whom held 94.5% share of \nRs.100/- each in the company. The news item further \nindicated that Naveen Kohli was acting against the spirit \nof the Article of the Association of Nikhil Rubber (P) Ltd., \nhad caused immense loss of business and goodwill. He \nhas stealthily removed produce of the company, besides \ndiverted orders of foreign buyers to his proprietorship \nfirm M/s Navneet Elastomers. He had opened bank \naccount with forged signatures of Mrs. Neelu Kohli and \nfabricated resolution of the Board of Directors of the \ncompany. Statutory authority-\nCompanies Act\n had \nrefused to register documents filed by Mr. Naveen Kolhi \nand had issued show cause notice. All business \nassociates were cautioned to avoid dealing with him \nalone. Neither the company nor Mrs. Neelu Kohli shall \nbe liable for the acts of Mr. Naveen Kohli. Despite the \naforementioned finding that the news item was intended \nto caution business associates to avoid dealing with the \nappellant then to come to this finding in the next para \nthat it will by no stretch of imagination result in mental \ncruelty is wholly untenable. \n\nThe findings of the High Court that the respondent \nwife's cautioning the entire world not to deal with the \nappellant (her husband) would not lead to mental cruelty \nis also wholly unsustainable. \n\nThe High Court ought to have examined the facts of \nthe case and its impact. In the instant case, the \nfollowing cases were filed by the respondent against the \nappellant. \n\n1. The respondent filed FIR No. 100/96 at Police \n Station, Kohna under Sections 379/323 IPC\n\n2. The respondent got a case registered under Sections \n 323/324 registered in the police station Panki, \n Kanpur City.\n\n3. At the behest of the respondent FIR No.156 of 1996 \n was also filed in the police station, Panki.\n\n4. The respondent filed FIR under \nSection 420\n/\n468\n \n IPC at the Police Station, Kotwali.\n\n5. The respondent got a case registered under Section \n under \nSections 420\n/\n467\n/\n468\n and \n471\n IPC. \n\n6. The respondent filed a complaint against the \nappellant under \nSections 498A\n/\n323\n/\n504\n/\n506\n IPC \nat Police Station, Kohna. \n\n7. The respondent had even gone to the extent of \nopposing the bail application of the appellant in \ncriminal case filed at the police station, Kotwali\n\n8. When police filed final report in two criminal cases \n at police station, Kotwali and police station, Kohna, \n the respondent filed protest petition in these cases.\n\n9. The respondent filed complaint no.125 of 1998 in \nthe Women Cell, Delhi in September 1997 against \nthe appellant's lawyer and friend alleging criminal \nintimidation. \n\n10. The respondent filed a complaint under sections \n397/398 before the Company Law Board, New \nDelhi.\n\n11. The respondent filed a complaint in Case No.1365 \n0f 1988 against the appellant.\n\n12. Again on 8.7.1999, the respondent filed a complaint \nin the Parliament Street Police Station, New Delhi \nand made all efforts to get the appellant arrested. \n\n13. On 31.3.1999, the respondent have sent a notice \nfor breaking the Nucleus of the HUF.\n\n14. The respondent filed a complaint against the \nappellant under \nSection 24\n of the Hindu Marriage \nAct.\n\n15. The respondent had withdrawn Rs.9,50,000/- from \nthe bank account of the appellant in a clandestine \nmanner.\n\n16. On 22.1.01 the respondent gave affidavit before the \nHigh Court and got non-bailable warrants issued \nagainst the appellant.\n\n17. The respondent got an advertisement issued in a \nnational newspaper that the appellant was only her \nemployee. She got another news item issued \ncautioning the business associates to avoid dealing \nwith the appellant.\n\nThe findings of the High Court that these \nproceedings could not be taken to be such which may \nwarrant annulment of marriage is wholly unsustainable. \n\nEven at this stage, the respondent does not want \ndivorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and \nevaluation of the entire evidence, it is clear that the \nrespondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life \na miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of \nadamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts \nof this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that \nthe respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with \nmental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage \nbetween the parties had broken down irretrievably and \nthere is no chance of their coming together, or living \ntogether again. \n\nThe High Court ought to have appreciated that \nthere is no acceptable way in which the parties can be \ncompelled to resume life with the consort, nothing is \ngained by trying to keep the parties tied forever to a \nmarriage that in fact has ceased to exist. \n\nUndoubtedly, it is the obligation of the Court and all \nconcerned that the marriage status should, as far as \npossible, as long as possible and whenever possible, be \nmaintained, but when the marriage is totally dead, in \nthat event, nothing is gained by trying to keep the parties \ntied forever to a marriage which in fact has ceased to \nexist. In the instant case, there has been total \ndisappearance of emotional substratum in the marriage. \nThe course which has been adopted by the High Court \nwould encourage continuous bickering, perpetual \nbitterness and may lead to immorality.\n\nIn view of the fact that the parties have been living \nseparately for more than 10 years and a very large \nnumber of aforementioned criminal and civil proceedings \nhave been initiated by the respondent against the \nappellant and some proceedings have been initiated by \nthe appellant against the respondent, the matrimonial \nbond between the parties is beyond repair. A marriage \nbetween the parties is only in name. The marriage has \nbeen wrecked beyond the hope of salvage, public interest \nand interest of all concerned lies in the recognition of the \nfact and to declare defunct de jure what is already \ndefunct de facto. To keep the sham is obviously \nconducive to immorality and potentially more prejudicial \nto the public interest than a dissolution of the marriage \nbond.\n\nThe High Court ought to have visualized that \npreservation of such a marriage is totally unworkable \nwhich has ceased to be effective and would be greater \nsource of misery for the parties.\n\nThe High Court ought to have considered that a \nhuman problem can be properly resolved by adopting a \nhuman approach. In the instant case, not to grant a \ndecree of divorce would be disastrous for the parties. \nOtherwise, there may be a ray of hope for the parties that \nafter a passage of time (after obtaining a decree of \ndivorce) the parties may psychologically and emotionally \nsettle down and start a new chapter in life. \n\nIn our considered view, looking to the peculiar facts \nof the case, the High Court was not justified in setting \naside the order of the Trial Court. In our opinion, \nwisdom lies in accepting the pragmatic reality of life and \ntake a decision which would ultimately be conducive in \nthe interest of both the parties. \n\nConsequently, we set aside the impugned judgment \nof the High Court and direct that the marriage between \nthe parties should be dissolved according to the \nprovisions of the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n. In the \nextra-ordinary facts and circumstances of the case, to \nresolve the problem in the interest of all concerned, while \ndissolving the marriage between the parties, we direct the \nappellant to pay Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty five lacs) \nto the respondent towards permanent maintenance to be \npaid within eight weeks. This amount would include \nRs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lacs with interest) deposited \nby the appellant on the direction of the Trial Court. The \nrespondent would be at liberty to withdraw this amount \nwith interest. Therefore, now the appellant would pay \nonly Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty lacs) to the \nrespondent within the stipulated period. In case the \nappellant fails to pay the amount as indicated above \nwithin the stipulated period, the direction given by us \nwould be of no avail and the appeal shall stand \ndismissed. In awarding permanent maintenance we \nhave taken into consideration the financial standing of \nthe appellant.\n\n Before we part with this case, on the consideration \nof the totality of facts, this Court would like to \nrecommend the Union of India to seriously consider \nbringing an amendment in the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n \nto incorporate irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a \nground for the grant of divorce. A copy of this judgment \nbe sent to the Secretary, Ministry of Law & Justice, \nDepartment of Legal Affairs, Government of India for \ntaking appropriate steps.\n\nThe appeal is accordingly disposed of. In the facts \nand circumstances of the case we direct the parties to \nbear their own costs.",

Therefore, one \nhas to see what are the probabilities in a case and legal \ncruelty has to be found out, not merely as a matter of \nfact, but as the effect on the mind of the complainant \nspouse because of the acts or omissions of the other. \nCruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be mental. \nIn physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct \nevidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not \nat the same time be direct evidence. In cases where there \nis no direct evidence, Courts are required to probe into \nthe mental process and mental effect of incidents that are \nbrought out in evidence. It is in this view that one has to \nconsider the evidence in matrimonial disputes."

Cruelty is a course or conduct of one, which \nis adversely affecting the other. The cruelty may be \nmental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is \nphysical, the Court will have no problem in determining \nit. It is a question of fact and degree. If it is mental, the \nproblem presents difficulties. First, the enquiry must \nbegin as to the nature of cruel treatment, second the \nimpact of such treatment in the mind of the spouse, \nwhether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would \nbe harmful or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, \nit is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into \naccount the nature of the conduct and its effect on the \ncomplaining spouse. However, there may be a case where \nthe conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se \nunlawful or illegal. Then the impact or injurious effect on \nthe other spouse need not be enquired into or \nconsidered. \nIn such cases, the cruelty will be established \nif the conduct itself is proved or admitted (See \nSobha \nRani v. Madhukar Reddi\n (1988) 1 SCC 105).\n To constitute cruelty, the conduct complained of \nshould be \"grave and weighty\" so as to come to the \nconclusion that the petitioner spouse cannot be \nreasonably expected to live with the other spouse. It must \nbe something more serious than \"ordinary wear and tear \nof married life\". The conduct taking into consideration \nthe circumstances and background has to be examined \nto reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained \nof amounts to cruelty in the matrimonial law. Conduct \nhas to be considered, as noted above, in the background \nof several factors such as social status of parties, their \neducation, physical and mental conditions, customs and \ntraditions. It is difficult to lay down a precise definition \nor to give exhaustive description of the circumstances, \nwhich would constitute cruelty. It must be of the type as \nto satisfy the conscience of the Court that the \nrelationship between the parties had deteriorated to such \nextent due to the conduct of the other spouse that it \nwould be impossible for them to live together without \nmental agony, torture or distress, to entitle the \ncomplaining spouse to secure divorce. Physical violence \nis not absolutely essential to constitute cruelty and a \nconsistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable \nmental agony and torture may well constitute cruelty \nwithin the meaning of \nSection 10\n of the Act. Mental \ncruelty may consist of verbal abuses and insults by using \nfilthy and abusive language leading to constant \ndisturbance of mental peace of the other party."

But before the \nconduct can be called cruelty, it must touch a certain \npitch of severity. It is for the Court to weigh the gravity. It \nhas to be seen whether the conduct was such that no \nreasonable person would tolerate it. It has to be \nconsidered whether the complainant should be called \nupon to endure as a part of normal human life. Every \nmatrimonial conduct, which may cause annoyance to the \nother, may not amount to cruelty. Mere trivial irritations, \nquarrels between spouses, which happen in day-to-day \nmarried life, may also not amount to cruelty. Cruelty in \nmatrimonial life may be of unfounded variety, which can \nbe subtle or brutal. It may be words, gestures or by mere \nsilence, violent or non-violent."
