JYOTHSNA D.,)\n XVI Addl.City Civil Judge,B'lore\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n This is a suit filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants\n\nseeking the relief of declaration by declaring that the order passed\n\nby the 1st defendant in RD 197 LGB, 2003, dated 17-4-2003 as non-\n\nest in the eye of law, grant of perpetual injunction against the 3 rd\n\ndefendant restraining it, its agent, men or anybody under or\n\nthrough it from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the schedule\n\nproperty or in any way interfering with the plaintiffs lawful\n\n 9 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\npossession of schedule property and grant such other reliefs as\n\ndeemed fit under the circumstances of the case with costs.\n\n 2. The brief averments of the plaint are as under:-\n\n Plaintiffs submit that originally one Sri. Linga Reddy resident\n\nof Agara village, Begur Hobli, Bangalore South taluk, had four sons\n\nnamely Venkata Reddy, Gururva Reddy, Thimma Reddy and\n\nPasalappa Reddy and the plaintiffs herein are the grand sons and\n\nthe great grandsons of the above said Sri. Linga Reddy. Their\n\nentire joint family owned and possessed joint ancestral properties\n\nto an extent of 15 acres 11 guntas of land in Survey No. 31 of\n\nYellukunte village described as schedule property and 12 acres 31\n\nguntas of land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte village, both\n\nsituated at Agara Village, Begur Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk.\n\nSurvey No.31 consisting of 15 Acres 11 guntas of land i.e. schedule\n\nproperty was earlier comprised of 5 Survey Nos i.e. Survey No.\n\nNo.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 and similarly Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte\n\nvillage consisting of 12 Acres 31 guntas was earlier comprised in\n\nfour Survey No. 68, 70. 71. 72 and in the above survey numbers,\n\nthe great ancestor of the plaintiffs Sri.Pasalappa Reddy had\n\nconstructed a private tank during the year 1890 to be used as a\n\nwater resource for agricultural activities and during re-survey\n\n 10 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\noperations conducted by the State Government through Land\n\nRecords Department in the year 1937, Survey Nos. 7 to 10 and 13\n\nwere consolidated and total extent of 15 Acres 11 guntas was\n\nassigned new Survey No. 31 of Yellukunte village. During the year\n\n1934-35, the then Deputy Commissioner by his order dated 25-11-\n\n1935 in CL 1314/1934-35 ordered for merging of the above said\n\nfive Survey numbers in to Survey No.31 and in this order, the\n\nexistence of tank is mentioned and further the Department of Land\n\nRecords after the survey of the schedule property along with land\n\nin Survey No.69, of Haralakutne village, had prepared a report\n\nwherein it has been clearly mentioned that the great ancestor of\n\nplaintiffs Sri.Pasappa Reddy had constructed private tank in the\n\nschedule property as well as land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte.\n\nFrom the documents and recitals therein, it is clear that the great\n\nancestor of plaintiffs namely Sri.Pasalappa Reddy owned and\n\npossessed the schedule property as well as 12 acres 31 guntas of\n\nland in Survey No.69 of Haralakunte village and had constructed\n\nhis own private tank. The plaintiffs and their family members\n\nbelonging to the Joint Hindu family succeeded to the schedule\n\nproperty as well as the land comprised in Survey No.69 of\n\nHaralakunte village and exercised their rightful ownership and\n\npossession upon the same.\n\n 11 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 3. When this being the situation, to their shock and surprise, on\n\n31-12-1994, the Tahsildar Bangalore South taluk suo-moto passed\n\nan order thereby directing cancellation of names of the plaintiffs\n\nfamily from the relevant revenue records on the ground that the\n\nschedule property and the land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte\n\nvillage are Government Tank. Aggrieved by the said order, one of\n\nthe family members of the plaintiffs challenged the said order\n\nbefore the Asst. Commissioner in RA.No.127/1995-96 which came\n\nto be dismissed for default and further the order of Asst.\n\nCommissioner was challenged before the Hon'ble High Court of\n\nKarnataka in W.P.No.22420/97 and the High Court quashed the\n\norder passed by the Tahsildar and the Asst. Commissioner and\n\nremanded back the matter for fresh disposal before the Special\n\nTahsildar for adjudicating the dispute between the plaintiffs and\n\nthe State Government in RRT 43/1998-99 which is still pending.\n\nOwing to the orders passed by the Tahsildar cancelling the names\n\nof the plaintiffs family members from the RTC, they have filed two\n\nsuits in O.S.4830/96 in respect of 12 Acres 31 guntas of land in\n\nSurvey No. 69 and O.S.No.1265/96 which came to be decreed in\n\nfavour of the plaintiffs and the same has been challenged by the\n\nState Government before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in\n\nRFA No.1050/2000. With regard to property in O.S.4830/96, the\n\n 12 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nCity Civil Court has directed the state Government, Special\n\nTahsildar and the Deputy Commissioner to maintain status-quo\n\nand with regard to land in Survey No.69 of Haralukunte Village, the\n\nHon'ble High Court of Karnataka has passed an order of status-\n\nquo. The schedule property is the absolute property of the\n\nplaintiffs and their family members and neither the State\n\nGovernment nor the defendants have got any manner of right,\n\ntitle, interest or possession over the same and further the schedule\n\nproperty is not the subject matter of acquisition either by the State\n\nGovernment or by the 3rd defendant.\n\n 4. When this being the realities and when the plaintiffs are in\n\nexclusive peaceful possession and enjoyment of the schedule\n\nproperty, to their shock and surprise, the officials of the 3 rd\n\ndefendant appeared near the schedule property and threatened to\n\ndispossess the plaintiffs from the schedule property and also\n\nthreatened to dismantle the structures existing in the schedule\n\nproperty. The plaintiffs sent a legal notice to the 3 rd defendant on\n\n9-4-2003 as per \nsection 64\n of the BDA Act, and the 3rd defendant\n\nafter receiving the said notice kept quiet for some time, and again\n\nthey started to interfere with their peaceful possession and\n\nenjoyment over the schedule property and when the plaintiffs\n\nverified the defendants claim over the schedule property, to their\n\n 13 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nutter shock and dismay, they found that the 1st defendant has\n\nordered that all the legal proceedings between the plaintiffs and\n\nthe State Government have been decided against the plaintiffs and\n\nthe schedule property has been ordered to be transferred to the\n\n3rd defendant authority and the plaintiffs made a tough task to\n\nconvince the officials of the 3rd defendant that the order passed by\n\n3rd defendant is not only opposed to the real facts, but also\n\namounting to sub-judice and gross contempt of Court. Hence, the\n\nplaintiffs having left with no other alternative are constrained to\n\nseek the indulgence of this court seeking the reliefs as sought in\n\nthe plaint. Hence this suit.\n\n 5. In this case, the defendant No.1 is the State Government,\n\nwhile the defendants 2 and 3 are the Special Deputy Commissioner\n\nand the Commissioner of BDA. The defendants 4 to 24 are the\n\nallottees of sites formed in the schedule lands.\n\n 6. The defendants 1 and 2 have jointly filed their written\n\nstatement, while the defendant No.3 has separately filed his\n\nwritten statement.\n\n 7. The allottees of sites ie., defendants 11, 12, 14, 23 and 24\n\nhave filed their written statement separately while defendants 15 &\n\n16, and 18 to 21 have jointly filed their written statement.\n\n 14 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 8. The defendants 4 to 10, 13, 17 and 22 have not filed their\n\nwritten statement.\n\n 9. In their Written Statement, the defendant Nos.1 and 2\n\nhave contended that the suit filed by the plaintiffs' is misconceived\n\nand is liable to be dismissed in limine.\n\n 10. Order dated 17.04.2003 is not amenable to jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court. The Order dated 17.04.2003 is a communication from\n\nthe first defendant to the second defendant directing him to hand\n\nover 15 acres 11 guntas of land in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village,\n\nBegur Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk to the Bangalore Development\n\nAuthority. The said communication is in the nature of\n\ninterdepartmental communication. Hence, the prayer for\n\ndeclaration cannot be granted.\n\n 11. The suit filed by the plaintiffs is not preceded by a Notice\n\nunder Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code. Hence, the suit is not\n\nmaintainable and therefore, is liable to be dismissed.\n\n The relief of permanent injunction sought for by the plaintiff\n\ncannot be granted as the plaintiffs are not in possession of the\n\nland at any point of time. They were never in possession of the\n\nland in question. There is a lengthy narration of facts tracing the\n\ntitle to the property in question by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 1 to\n\n5 of the plaint. Property in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village did not\n\n 15 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nbelong to the family of the plaintiffs and the allegations made\n\ncontrary to this are denied as false. The genealogy as stated in\n\ndocument No.1 is not admitted. It is denied that the great ancestor\n\nof the plaintiffs Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank\n\ncomprised of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13. It is admitted that earlier\n\nsurvey numbers were changed to 31. But Pasalappa Reddy did not\n\nform a tank. Plaintiffs were never in possession of suit schedule\n\nproperty and also Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte Village.\n\n 12. Parts of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 of Yellukunte Village were\n\nwater logged. The total extent of this water logged land comprised\n\nin one boundary was 15 acres 11 guntas. They were clubbed into\n\none survey number and it was made into a tank. It was in fact a\n\ngovernment tank. Over the years, the tank dried up and the land\n\nlost the character of a tank though in the village map, it was being\n\nshown as a government tank. Survey No.13 was throughout a\n\ngovernment land and in the revenue records, it was shown as a\n\nmufat kaval land.\n\n 13. Certain lands in Yellukunte Village, Begur Hobli, Bengaluru\n\nSouth Taluk was acquired in favour of BDA for formation of HSR\n\nLayout. One of the lands which formed part of HSR Layout was\n\nSy.No.31 since the land had lost the character of a tank long ago,\n\nthe government decided to handover this land to the BDA for\n\n 16 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nbeing allotted in turn to various eligible persons. The land was\n\nduly handed over to BDA and the BDA after forming sites has\n\nallotted sites to various persons. As of now, number of houses\n\nhave been fully constructed and either allottees or transferees\n\nfrom allottees are residing there. About 7 to 8 houses are now\n\nunder construction.\n\n 14. Plaintiffs are making claim on the land in question on the\n\nbasis of certain wrong entries in the revenue records. In respect of\n\nthe lands in question, certain persons had made claim as\n\nunauthorized occupants. The BDA decided to set apart a sum of\n\nRs.9,90,310/- at the disposal of the Tahsildar, Bangalore South\n\nTaluk to facilitate him to disburse compensation as ex-gratia\n\ncompensation. A number of persons filed claim for award of\n\ncompensation and their claims are pending before the second\n\ndefendant.\n\n 15. The land in question was never a private tank. The plaintiffs\n\nhave misinterpreted some of the revenue records and on that\n\nbasis, they are claiming that Pasalappa Reddy owned and\n\npossessed the suit land, which is false and incorrect. Pasalappa\n\nReddy did not claim ownership and possession over the lands in\n\nSy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 which were clubbed together in Form\n\nNo.31. In fact, Pasalappa was not the owner of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10\n\n 17 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nand 13. Plaintiffs are not the successors in interest of Pasalappa\n\nReddy. The plaintiffs had never been in possession of the suit land\n\nat any point of time. They are not in possession of the suit land.\n\n 16. The defendants 1 & 2 have produced the Certified Copy of\n\nthe Village Map and Pakka Book, which clearly prove that the land\n\nwas throughout a government tank.\n\n 17. It is admitted that the Tahsildar, Bengaluru South Taluk in\n\nthe year 1994 deleted certain wrong entries in the record of rights.\n\nFiling of appeals by the plaintiffs and writ petitions before the\n\nHon'ble High Court is admitted. After remand, the matter is\n\npending before the Tahsildar. Filing of suit in respect of Sy.No.69 is\n\nadmitted. However, it is contended as false that the suit schedule\n\nproperty is the absolute property of the plaintiffs and their\n\nfamilies. There is no question of dispossessing the plaintiffs as\n\nthey were never in possession of the land. After passing of the\n\norder dated 17.04.2003, the property was handed over to the BDA\n\nand the BDA has formed layouts and also allotted sites to\n\nrespective allottees.\n\n 18. The threatened dispossession of the plaintiffs and actions\n\ntaken by them are false and make believe.\n\n 19. There is no cause of action for the suit and the one\n\nmentioned in paragraph 13 of the plaint is false. The plaintiffs are\n\n 18 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nnot entitled to reliefs sought for. The plaintiffs have filed a false\n\nand vexatious suit. Hence, prayed to dismiss the suit with costs.\n\n 20. The 3rd defendant has filed its written statement by denying\n\nthe averments taken up in the plaint and further contended that\n\nthis Court has no jurisdiction to decide the matter in dispute, and\n\nthe above suit is not maintainable either in law or on facts and\n\nsame is liable to be dismissed in limine. With regard to the\n\naverments made in para-2 of the plaint, the same is put to strict\n\nproof of the same. Further, the 3rd defendant denied the averments\n\nmade in para-3 of the plaint as false. In fact, the tank standing on\n\nthe schedule property and Survey No.69 was never a private tank\n\nand all along the same belonged to the Government of Karnataka.\n\nDefendant admitted the contents of para-4 of the plaint, but\n\ndenied the averments made in para-5 as false and plaintiffs are put\n\nto strict proof of the same. In fact, the copy of the document\n\nproduced at document No.5 clearly disclose that the same was\n\nforged to include the Survey No.31 in the plaint schedule property\n\nonly in order to facilitate the concerned. The 3rd defendant submit\n\nthat the plaintiffs were at no point of time in possession of the\n\nschedule property and all along the suit schedule property was a\n\nGovernment property and the Government of Karnataka having\n\nsanctioned an improvement scheme for the formation of layout\n\n 19 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ncalled \" Between Hosur Road and Sarjapura Road\", by virtue of its\n\nnotification No.HUD /444/MNX/86 dated 28-11-1986 and appointed\n\nthe Special Addl. Land Acquisition Officer as the Deputy\n\nCommissioner under the \nLand Acquisition Act\n, and in furtherance\n\nof the same, the suit schedule property being a Government\n\nproperty was transferred to the 3rd defendant by its order No. RD\n\n197-NGB/2003 dated 17-4-2003 and this defendant has taken the\n\npossession of the same. After taking possession of the suit\n\nschedule property, the 3rd defendant has also called for tenders by\n\nissuing paper publication and the work is already in progress. In\n\nthese circumstances, the contention of the plaintiffs that they are\n\nin possession of the suit schedule property and the defendant\n\ninterfered in their property is totally false and incorrect. Further\n\nthe allegations that in spite of notice and order of this court, they\n\ninterfered in the plaintiffs possession is also denied as false. It is\n\nfurther denied that the plaintiffs and their joint family at any point\n\nof time owned and possessed and were enjoying the suit schedule\n\nproperty and land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte village and\n\npendency of proceedings before the special Tahsildar in RRT\n\nNo.43/98-99 is in no way concerned to this suit. The filing of suits\n\nby the plaintiffs and the family members is admitted, but the fact\n\nof passing an order of status-quo is put to strict proof and further\n\n 20 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nthe averments relating to OS No.1265/1996 is in no way concerned\n\nwith the suit schedule property. While denying the averments\n\nmade in paras-9 & 10 of the plaint, it is contended that the same is\n\nput to strict proof of the same. The 3rd defendant submitted that\n\nplaintiffs with an intention to grab the valuable property belonging\n\nto the state Government are laying false claim one after another\n\nwithout producing any documents relating to their title. The relief\n\nof declaration cannot be granted, as the plaintiffs have no right,\n\ntitle or interest over the schedule property. There is no cause of\n\naction for the suit and the court fee paid is insufficient. Among\n\nthese grounds, the 3rd defendant prayed to dismiss the suit.\n\n 21. The defendants 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16, 18 to 21, 23 and 24 being\n\nthe allottees of sites formed in the schedule property by the BDA\n\nthe defendant No.3, have filed their written statement. Since the\n\ncontentions taken by them are similar, except the site numbers\n\nand measurement allotted to them is different, the gist of their\n\nwritten statement is extracted below:\n\n 22. They have contended that the suit is not maintainable in\n\nlaw, either on facts and circumstances of the case. The plaintiffs\n\nare not entitled to the relief sought as they are not the owners,\n\n 21 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\npossessory holders, cultivators and having any title documents in\n\nrespect of the suit schedule property bearing Sy.No.31 measuring\n\n15 acres 11 guntas situated at Yellukunte Village, Begur Hobli,\n\nBengaluru South Taluk and the property bearing Sy.No.69,\n\nmeasuring 12 acres 31 guntas situated at Yellukunte Village, Begur\n\nHobli, Bengaluru South Taluk. The said land is situated within the\n\ngovernment tank. Hence, the suit is liable to be dismissed in\n\nlimine.\n\n 23. It is denied that the schedule property has been acquired\n\nthrough their ancestors and subsequently the revenue documents\n\nhave been changed in the name of the plaintiffs. The documents\n\nfiled by the plaintiffs are created for the purpose of knocking off\n\nthe properties, which is also known as HSR Layout.\n\n 24. The plaintiffs have not filed any title documents such as\n\nGrant Orders, Grant Certificate, Katha Extract, Survey Sketch,\n\nVillage Sketch, Village Map etc. Plaintiffs though stated that the\n\nschedule properties were acquired through their ancestors, but to\n\nsubstantiate the same, no documents are produced.\n\n 25. It is contended that the schedule land is a government land,\n\nwherein the government formed a tank and subsequently, the suit\n\nland was acquired by the BDA for formation of Hosur Sarjapura\n\nLayout and the same was approved on 28.11.1986 in Notification\n\n 22 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nNo.HUD.444.MNX.86 and the said land was handed over to\n\nengineering section along with permission on 17.04.2003 in RD\n\n1977 NGB 2003 and possession was also taken on 26.05.2003.\n\nTherefore, the said land has been vested with the BDA. Therefore,\n\nthe plaintiffs have no right and title over the schedule property.\n\nEven the plaintiffs have not challenged the acquisition proceedings\n\nso far. Hence, the above suit is not maintainable after acquisition\n\nproceedings, which attained finality. Even the plaintiffs have not\n\nissued notice under \nSection 64\n of the BDA Act before filing the suit,\n\nwhich is mandatory.\n\n 26. After acquisition proceedings in accordance with rules,\n\nthe BDA formed the layout and allotted sites to its members ie.,\n\ndefendants mentioned above. Thereafter, they have made all\n\nrequisite payments and even paid tax of the property. The BDA\n\nalso executed the registered Sale Deed in their favour and the\n\ndefendants were also issued with Possession Certificate, Katha\n\nCertificate, Katha Endorsement and other registered title\n\ndocuments in respect of the schedule property. They also applied\n\nfor approval of the plan. They are lawfully in physical possession\n\nand enjoyment of their respective sites. Even the other allottees of\n\nthe sites have also obtained all the registered title documents\n\nincluding plans and put up their residential constructions.\n\n 23 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 27. It is contended that this Court has got power to call for all\n\nthe original records from the concerned revenue departments to\n\nknow the reality and to take action. Under these circumstances,\n\nthe suit is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed in limine.\n\n 28. As per plaint averments itself, a second suit claiming\n\ndeclaration of title is barred as per the provisions \nof Code of Civil\n\nProcedure\n as the prayer is hit by Res Judicata and is liable to be\n\ndismissed as such.\n\n 29. Prayer for declaration of the order passed by 1 st defendant\n\nas non-est in the eye of law, cannot be granted as an alternate and\n\nefficacious remedy to challenge the said order, is available and the\n\nplaintiffs having not availed such remedy known to law, cannot\n\nseek a declaration before this Court.\n\n 30. The defendants have put the plaintiffs to put to strict proof\n\nof the averments in para 2 of the plaint regarding their lineal\n\ndescendancy of one Linga Reddy and it is contended that the\n\ngenealogical tree produced is cooked up for the purpose of the\n\nsuit.\n\n 31. The plaintiffs have failed to aver how the said properties\n\ncame into possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs, as averred\n\nin para 3 of the plaint. The plaintiffs have not produced any title\n\n 24 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ndeeds evidencing their ownership claim over the properties\n\nmentioned in para 3 of the plaint.\n\n 32. The documents produced by the plaintiffs do not depict\n\nanywhere the names of any persons whatsoever and hence, as\n\naverred in para 4 of the plaint, the plaintiffs cannot claim anything\n\nthrough those documents.\n\n 33. As averred in plaint para 5 by the plaintiffs, these defendants\n\nput the plaintiffs to strict proof of the documents through which\n\nthey claim that their ancestors name is shown in the revenue\n\ndocuments and it has depicted that their ancestor had constructed\n\nthe tank and further put the plaintiffs to strict proof of the\n\naverment that their ancestors constructed the tank. It is well\n\nsettled law that revenue documents do not prove title. The\n\nplaintiffs with the connivance of certain officials have cooked up\n\nthese revenue documents and are claiming possession over the\n\nsaid lands.\n\n 34. The averments of the plaint paragraphs show that the\n\nplaintiffs are mischief mongers and are making all out efforts to\n\nknock off valuable property belonging to the State and acquired by\n\nthe BDA. The averments depict that the plaintiffs have availed all\n\nremedy available and are pursuing parallel remedies to somehow\n\nsucceed to knock off the suit schedule property.\n\n 25 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 35. As averred in plaint para 11, it is admitted that the first\n\ndefendant has issued the order and has also directed that the land\n\nbe transferred to 3rd defendant to facilitate formation of layout\n\nformed by the 3rd defendant. All the surrounding villages abutting\n\nthe schedule properties have been acquired by the BDA, the third\n\ndefendant and the ancestors as well as the plaintiffs have received\n\ncompensation for the acquisition of the land for formation of HSR\n\nLayout. When such being the case, the claim now put forward by\n\nthe plaintiffs are all false, hit by res judicata and they are also\n\nestopped from claiming ownership of the lands that are acquired\n\nby the first and third defendants.\n\n 36. As regards to para 12 of the plaint is concerned, the\n\nplaintiffs cannot question the order before this Court and a\n\nseparate remedy is available for the plaintiffs to challenge the\n\nsame. As the said order pertains to land acquisition by the State,\n\nthe Land Acquisition Act expressly bars the jurisdiction of Civil\n\nCourt. Hence, this Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the order\n\npassed by the first and third defendants. Hence, the suit is liable to\n\nbe dismissed as having no jurisdiction with costs.\n\n 37. There is no cause of action for instituting this suit and\n\nhence, the suit is liable to be dismissed.\n\n 26 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 38. As per the averments made in the subsequent applications\n\nfiled by the plaintiffs, it is clearly averred that the third defendant\n\nhas formed layout and sites have been allotted to various persons\n\nand absolute sale deeds have been executed. All the allottees and\n\npersons who have purchased the said sites in the suit schedule\n\nproperty have to be made parties to the suit for proper\n\nadjudication. The suit deserves to be dismissed for non-joinder of\n\nthe said persons. The plaintiffs though being aware that the sale\n\ndeeds have been executed by the BDA, the third defendant has not\n\nchallenged the execution of the sale deeds. In view of the same,\n\nthe suit has to be dismissed for non-seeking of prayer of setting\n\naside the sale deeds. The defendants have purchased sites formed\n\nin the suit schedule property and have obtained the khatha in their\n\nrespective names and have paid tax. The court fee paid on the\n\nplaint is grossly insufficient and the suit is liable to be dismissed for\n\nnon-payment of proper court fee.\n\n 39. The defendants have denied all other averments in the\n\nplaint, which are not specifically denied as false and prayed the\n\nCourt to dismiss the suit with costs.\n\n 40. The suit filed by the plaintiffs is false, frivolous, vexatious\n\nand not maintainable both in law and on facts. The suit is tainted\n\nwith malafides and the same is nothing but abuse of process of law\n\n 27 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\namounting to contempt of court within the meaning of \nSection 2(c)\n\nof the Contempt of Courts Act.\n\n 41. The relief of declaration sought in the plaint cannot be\n\ngranted in view of the bar provided under the proviso to \nSection 34\n\nof the Specific Relief Act. Hence, the suit is barred under \nSection 9\n\nof CPC and the plaintiff is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule\n\n11(d) \nof CPC\n.\n\n 42. The suit schedule property had been acquired and taken\n\npossession by the BDA by passing the final notification\n\nNo.HUD/444/MNX/86 dated 28.11.1986, which is conclusive\n\nevidence of acquisition under \nSection 6(3)\n of the Land Acquisition\n\nAct. Thus the plaintiffs have neither title nor possession over the\n\nschedule property.\n\n 43. The suit is barred under \nSection 3\n of the Limitation Act.\n\n 44. The suit is hit by delay and latches and on the principles of\n\nres-judicata. The acquisition of the land and the taking over the\n\npossession by the BDA had not been challenged by the plaintiffs.\n\nHence, the suit is hit by the principles of estoppel. Since the\n\nacquisition of the land by the BDA has reached its finality, the\n\nplaintiffs have no locus standi to challenge the notification No.RD\n\n197/LGB/2003, dated 17.04.2003.\n\n 28 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 45. The suit is unsustainable against the 1st and 2nd defendants\n\nfor want of notice under \nSection 52\n of the Land Acquisition Act and\n\nunder \nSection 80\n of CPC. Similarly, the suit is barred against 3rd\n\ndefendant under \nSection 64\n of CPC.\n\n 46. The BDA had acquired the land by passing the final\n\nnotification on 28.11.1986 and taken possession of the suit\n\nschedule property in furtherance of the developmental projects,\n\nthe layout was formed and the sites were allotted to various\n\npersons including these defendants and the allottees have\n\nconstructed their houses and are residing therein. The suit\n\nschedule land has been transformed into a residential layout\n\nthrough the operation of law and the schedule property has lost its\n\nidentity as an agricultural land. Hence, the suit for declaration and\n\npermanent injunction claiming the schedule property as an\n\nagricultural land cannot be maintained for want of cause of action\n\nand the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) \nof\n\nCPC\n.\n\n 47. The suit is not properly valued and the court fee paid is\n\ninsufficient and hence, the suit is liable to be rejected under Order\n\nVII Rule 11(b) and (c) \nof CPC\n.\n\n 48. The BDA has formed the layout and allotted sites to\n\nallottees and put them in possession by issuing Possession\n\n 29 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nCertificate and thereafter, executed the deeds of absolute sale and\n\nthe transfer has been effected in accordance with \nSection 54\n of the\n\nTransfer of Property Act and the sale deeds have been got\n\nregistered with the payment of the required stamp duty in\n\naccordance with law. The katha has been transferred into the\n\nnames of allottees and the property was was and is being collected\n\nby the BDA from the defendants. The plans are sanctioned by the\n\nBDA and the constructions were put up by the allottees and the\n\nsame has not been challenged by the plaintiffs. Hence, the present\n\nsuit is not maintainable and hence prayed to dismiss the suit with\n\ncosts.\n\n 49. In view of the above said pleadings, the following issues and\n\nAdditional Issues were framed:\n\nIssue No 1: Whether the plaintiffs prove that they are the\n absolute owners in lawful possession,\n peaceful and exclusive enjoyment of the suit\n schedule property with a given boundaries\n and measurements as on the date of filing of\n the suit?\n\nIssue No 2 : Whether the plaintiffs prove that the alleged\n order passed by the 1st defendant bearing No.\n RD 197 LGB 2003-dated 17-4-2003 is non-est\n in the eye of law?\n\n 30 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nIssue No 3 : Whether the defendant No.3 proves that the\n suit schedule property is a Government\n property and the same has been acquired for\n the formation of layout called \"Between Hosur\n Road and Sarjapur Road\" by virtue of its\n Notification No.HUD/444/MNX/86 dated 28-\n 11-1986 and acquisition proceedings having\n reached its finality, the suit schedule property\n was transferred to 3rd defendant by its order\n bearing No.RD 197-NGB-2003 dated 17-4-\n 2003 and possession has been taken on 26-5-\n 2003?\n\nIssue No 4 : Whether the plaintiffs prove that the officials\n of the 3rd defendant authority threatened to\n dispossess them and also to dismantle the\n existing structures in the suit schedule\n property?\n\nIssue No 5 : Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the\n reliefs as sought for in the plaint?\n\nIssue No 6 : What decree or order?\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUES dated 24-02-2011\n\nAddl.Issue No.1 : Whether the Defendant No.14 proves that he has\n constructed the house in Site No.1172, HSR Sector\n Ill, Bangalore, in the suit schedule premises?\n\nAddl.

Actually, this suit was once disposed off by decreeing the\n\nsuit on 22-11-2004. But aggrieved by the said judgment and de-\n\ncree, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 herein filed RFA No.416/2005 and\n\nthe defendant No.3 herein filed RFA No.67/2005 before Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court of Karnataka. RFA No 67/2005 was clubbed with RFA\n\nNo.416/2005 and the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka passed an\n\norder on 29-11-2006 by remitting the matter back to this court for\n\nfresh disposal in accordance with law within nine months from the\n\ndate of order by setting aside the judgment and decree. Though\n\nthe Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has directed to dispose off\n\nthis case within 9 months from the date of disposal of RFAs but till\n\n2025 it was pending for disposal for one or the other reasons of fil-\n\ning inter-locutary applications, impleading of more defendants,\n\namendments, framing of additional issues, further evidence etc.\n\n 51. To prove the case of the plaintiffs, one Mr. L. Shivarama\n\nReddy, S/o. Late Lakshmaih Reddy entered into witness box as\n\nPower of Attorney Holder of Plaintiffs and got examined by oath as\n\nPW 1 on their behalf and filed sworn affidavit of his examination in\n\nchief under which all the plaint averments are reiterated. To sub-\n\nstantiate the case of the plaintiffs, certain documents are got\n\nmarked through him as Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.22 and Ex.P.15(a), Ex.P.22(a).\n\nThe learned counsel for defendant Nos.1 and 2, the learned coun-\n\n 33 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nsel for defendant No 3, the learned counsel for defendant No.14,\n\nthe learned counsel for defendant No 15 and 16 and the learned\n\ncounsel for defendant No.23 cross examined him.

The learned counsel for defendant\n\nNo.3 cross examined him. Further, the learned counsel for plaintiff\n\nre-examined him after cross examination by the learned counsel\n\nfor defendant No.3. Further, Ex.D.21 is got marked through con-\n\nfrontation in his cross examination done by the learned counsel for\n\ndefendant No 3.\n\n 53. On the other hand, Sri E.Chennagangappa, S/o.

Perused the materials placed on\n\nrecord and accordingly this court answers the above Issues as un-\n\nder;\n\n Issues\n Issue No 1 : In the Negative;\n Issue No 2 : In the Negative;\n Issue No 3 : In the Affirmative;\n Issue No 4 : In the Negative;\n\n Addl.

Addl.Issue No.3 (24-02-2011), Addl.Issue Nos.2 and 3 (30-08-\n\n2018) and Addl.Issue Nos.4 and 5 (24-02-2016) :- These five Issues\n\nare regarding maintainability of suit in the viewpoints of defendant\n\nNo.14 and defendant No.24, in as much as, they are connected to\n\nGPA executed by plaintiffs in favour of Chandramouli Reddy and\n\nL.Shivarama Gowda and burden of proof of validity of GPA of plain-\n\ntiffs; proving that GPA is fabricated as has been contended by de-\n\nfendant No.24; non-maintainability of suit in the view point of de-\n\nfendant No.14; maintainability of suit having regard to the fact\n\nthat as on the date of the filing of this suit, the Plaintiff No.7 was no\n\nmore and validity of GPA executed by him, which are all inter-con-\n\nnected to each other. Hence, to avoid repeated discussions they\n\nare taken up together here under.\n\n 60. First of all, most important point to be noted here is the\n\nsame plaintiffs of this case along with some other plaintiffs, filed\n\ntwo other cases. They are OS No.1265/1996 and OS No.814/2005\n\nfiled against the same defendants with same set of facts in respect\n\nof Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte village and all these three (3) cases are\n\nremitted back to this court by the Hon'ble High Court for fresh dis-\n\nposal as same as in this case. Surprising point is in that cases, the\n\n 37 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nplaintiffs made similar set of facts that the deceased Pasalappa\n\nReddy constructed a private tank. Further, interesting point is in\n\neach cases is that they stated that said Pasalappa Reddy con-\n\nstructed private tank in the property of suit schedule property of\n\neach case. Such as in OS No.1296/1996 and in OS No 814/2005,\n\nthey stated that the said Pasalappa Reddy constructed private tank\n\nin Sy.No.69. In this OS No.3666/2003, they stated that the said\n\nPasalappa Reddy constructed private tank in Sy.No 31. But,\n\nnowhere in each cases stated that he constructed \"two separate\n\ntanks\" in Sy.No.31 and Sy.No.69 and in the evidence of this case, as\n\ndiscussed below, the witnesses failed to establish either construc-\n\ntion of separate tanks and even failed to establish construction of\n\ntank by Pasalappa Reddy. Moreover, all these three cases are con-\n\nnected to each other, but not clubbed. It is evident in the order of\n\nMisc.No 468/2007 dated 21-07-2007 filed by plaintiffs herein in\n\nwhich it is ordered as \" The Petition is allowed. OS No.1265/1996 and\n\nOS No.814/2005 pending on the file of CCH-10 and OS No.4830/1996\n\npending in the file of CCH-9 are withdrawn and transferred to CCH No\n\n12 where OS No.3666/2003 is pending for trial and disposal in accor-\n\ndance with law.\" Hence, these three cases OS No.3666/2003, OS\n\nNo.814/2005 and OS No.1265/1996 are taken up together for dis-\n\nposal to avoid ambiguities as since 1996 till date, there are bunch\n\n 38 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nof cases between same parties in respect of properties in Sy.No.69\n\nof Haralakunte village and property in Sy.No 31 of Yellukunte vil-\n\nlage, wherein the plaintiffs claimed through the root of their ances-\n\ntors without any title deeds and only on the basis of the contention\n\nthat Late Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank in the suit\n\nschedule properties. But, the contentions of the defendants are\n\nthat the said properties are government land with \"tank bed area\".\n\nThen question is whether the tank is private or government and\n\nwhether Pasalappa Reddy constructed tanks separately in both the\n\nproperties or how he can construct a single tank in both Sy.No.69\n\nand Sy.No.31 which situated in different villages such as Har-\n\nalakunte village and Yellukunte village, is the crucial point. If they\n\nare decided once in all cases, then definitely the question in contro-\n\nversy since 90's in respect of same subject matter of property and\n\nbetween same parties would attain finality without opening the\n\ndoors to multiplicity of proceedings and accordingly this court\n\nmade every endeavour to dispose off this matter which is directed\n\nby Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka to dispose within nine months\n\nas ordered in RFA No.416/2005 C/W 67/2005 dated 29-11-2006.\n\n61. Important point is in OS No.814/2005, wherein the plaintiff filed\n\nthat case against the Commissioner of BDA only and PW 1 himself\n\nstated in the affidavit of examination chief and plaintiffs in plaint as\n\n 39 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nthat case depends on judgment in OS No.1265/1996 and hence the\n\nparties have not lead evidence in that case and every proceeding is\n\nconducted in OS No 3666/2003. The GPA Holder/PW 1 in OS\n\nNo.814/2005 and OS No.1265/1996 is none other than S. Chandra\n\nMouli Reddy and in that regard discussed in detail here below.\n\n 62. Though the above cases are not clubbed, but on the basis\n\nof oral submissions of the respective sides, they are taken to the\n\nBoard together in every callings. Only, on going through the mate-\n\nrials on record together while preparing for judgment, it came to\n\nthe notice of the Court that they are not clubbed. But, this Court\n\nfinds there is no need to again reopen the stage for clubbing of the\n\nmatter in the suits which are posted for judgment which leads to\n\nreopening IAs which will lead to further procrastination of this age\n\nold suits, hence, by invoking inherent power under \nSection 151\n of\n\nCPC and considering the order in Misc.No.468/2007 dated 21-07-\n\n2007 filed by plaintiffs which is discussed supra, this court pro-\n\nceeded to pass judgment in these three cases without clubbing\n\nthem, which will not in any way adversely affect either technically\n\nor legally in respect of subject matter and parties to the suit. Fur-\n\nther, it will not cause any prejudice to the interest of justice. If it is\n\nagain reopened for clubbing the matter, then definitely it will lead\n\nto multiplicity of proceedings.\n\n 40 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 63. Admittedly and originally, this suit is filed against defen-\n\ndant Nos.1 to 3 and later defendant Nos.4 to 24 are added. The\n\nplaint prayers in this suit for declaration and perpetual injunction\n\nare reiterated here under;\n\n \"a) by declaring that the order passed by the first defen-\n\n dant in RD 197 LGB, 2003 dated: 17.04.2003 as non-est in the\n eye of law.\n\n b) Grant relief of perpetual injunction against the third\n defendant restraining him, his agent, men or anybody under or\n through him from dispossessing the Plaintiffs from the Sched-\n ule Property or in any way interfering with the Plaintiffs lawful\n possession of Schedule property; and\n\n c) Grant such other relief/reliefs as this Hon'ble Court\n deems fit in the circumstances of the case including the costs of\n the proceedings, in the ends of justice.\"\n\n 64. Before discussing facts and law in respect of circum-\n\nstances of this case, as they have direct bearing on the remaining\n\nIssues, here now, with regard to above five Issues, we have to look\n\ninto validity of GPA, validity of GPA after the death of person who\n\nexecuted GPA and other grounds of non-maintainability of suit in-\n\nvoked by the defendants.\n\n 65. Regarding, Addl.Issue No.3 dated 30-08-2018 is con-\n\ncerned, in paragraph 6 of page No.14 of the judgment of Hon'ble\n\n 41 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nHigh Court of Karnataka in RFA No 416/2005 C/W 67/2005, it is ob-\n\nserved and opined that the suit to the extent of dead plaintiff that\n\nis 7th plaintiff by the Power of Attorney may be bad in law and the\n\nsame paragraph is reproduced here under;\n\n \" 6. The plaintiffs 1 to 9 had prosecuted the suit through\n their Power of Attorney one Chandramara Reddy. As on the\n date of suit the 7th plaintiff was dead. The Power of Attorney\n instituted the suit on behalf of all the plaintiffs including the\n dead 7th plaintiff. The suit to the extent of dead plaintiff by the\n Power of Attorney may be bad in law, but the suit on behalf of\n the plaintiffs 1 to 6, 8 and 9 cannot be assailed as bad in law.\"\n\n66. Hence, further discussion on this Issue is just wasting of time\n\nas this Issue is directly connected to the maintainability of the suit\n\nto the extent of the Power of Attorney by a dead person that is\n\nplaintiff No.7 as to 'whether the defendant No.24 proves that as on\n\nthe date of the suit the plaintiff No.7 was no more, the plaintiffs\n\nfiled their suit filed by power of attorney holder is bad in law ?'.\n\n 67. Now, on perusal of order sheet, this suit is filed on 02-06-\n\n2003. In the cause title of original plaint, it is noted as \"all the plain-\n\ntiffs are represented by their attorney holder S.Chandra Mouli\n\nReddy. The verification portion of plaint shows that it is verified by\n\nGPA holder of plaintiff S.Chandra Mouli Reddy. Further, the verify-\n\n 42 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ning affidavit to the plaint is deposed by the same GPA S.Chandra\n\nMouli Reddy.\n\n 68. It is well known that as per \nOrder VI Rule 1 of the CPC\n,\n\n\"Pleading\" shall mean plaint or written statement. Further the said\n\npleadings shall be signed by the parties and his pleader and it is\n\nnot as \"signed by the party \"or\" pleader\". That means in the plaint\n\nand written statement, signature of both the parties and the coun-\n\nsels/pleaders shall be compulsory. To make it more clear the Rule\n\n14 of \nOrder VI of CPC\n is hereby reproduced;\n\n \"14. Pleading to be signed.--Every pleading shall be\n signed by the party and his pleader (if any):\n\n Provided that where a party pleading is, by reason of ab-\n sence or for other good cause, unable to sign the pleading, it\n may be signed by any person duly authorized by him to sign\n the same or to sue or defend on his behalf.\"\n\n 69. Further, the proviso gives opportunity to sign the plead-\n\ning in the absence of parties for cause, then by the duly authorized\n\nperson. Duly authorized person under law is \"power of attorney\n\nholder.\" as provided in Order III Rule 1 and 2 \nof CPC\n.\n\n 70. Why this Court is discussing these provision here because\n\nin this case, the original plaint is filed through GPA holder S. Chan-\n\ndra Mouli Reddy and as stated above in the original plaint filed, it\n\n 43 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ncontains signature of said GPA. But, all the subsequent \"amended\n\nplaint\" contain signature of neither parties nor GPA holders. They\n\nare signed by only the \"counsel/advocate for plaintiff\" which is not\n\ntenable under law.\n\n 71. Further, to make it more clear, \nOrder III Rule 4 of CPC\n is\n\nreproduced here under for better understanding of the pleader's\n\nauthority and duty towards the suit and he has no authority to file\n\npleadings independently without signature of either parties or\n\ntheir attorney.\n\n \"4. Appointment of pleader.--(1) No pleader shall act for\n any person in any Court, unless he has been appointed for the\n purpose by such person by a document in writing signed by\n such person or by his recognised agent or by some other per-\n son duly authorised by or under a power-of-attorney to make\n such appointment.\n\n (2) Every such appointment shall be 3[filed in Court and shall,\n for the purposes of sub-rule (1), be] deemed to be in force until\n determined with the leave of the Court by a writing signed by\n the client or the pleader, as the case may be, and filed in Court,\n or until the client or the pleader dies, or until all proceedings in\n the suit are ended so far as regards the client.\n\n Explanation. --For the purposes of this sub-rule, the following\n shall be deemed to be proceedings in the suit,--\n\n (a) an application for the review of decree or order in the\n suit,\n\n 44 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n (b) an application under section 144 or under section 152 of\nthis Code, in relation to any decree or order made in the suit,\n\n(c) an appeal from any decree or order in the suit, and\n\n (d) any application or act for the purpose of obtaining copies\nof documents or return of documents produced or filed in the\nsuit or of obtaining refund of moneys paid into the Court in\nconnection with the suit.\n\n (3) Nothing in sub-rule (2) shall be construed--\n\n (a) as extending, as between the pleader and his client, the\nduration for which the pleader is engaged, or\n\n (b) as authorising service on the pleader of any notice or doc-\nument issued by any Court other than the Court for which the\npleader was engaged, except where such service was expressly\nagreed to by the client in the document referred to in sub-rule\n(1).\n\n (4) The High Court may, by general order, direct that, where\nthe person by whom a pleader is appointed is unable to write\nhis name, his mark upon the document appointing the pleader\nshall be attested by such person and in such manner as may be\nspecified by the order.\n\n (5) No pleader who has been engaged for the purpose of\npleading only shall plead on behalf of any party, unless he has\nfiled in court a memorandum of appearance signed by himself\nand stating--\n\n (a) the names of the parties to the suit,\n\n (b) the name of the party for whom he appears, and\n\n (c) the name of the person by whom he is authorised to ap-\npear:\n\n 45 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n Provided that nothing in this sub-rule shall apply to any\n pleader engaged to plead on behalf of any party by any other\n pleader who has been duly appointed to act in Court on behalf\n of such party.\"\n\n 72. Then, filing of amended plaint without signature of\n\neither the plaintiffs or their attorneys is not permissible under law.\n\n 73. Further, in another way also, the amended plaints are de-\n\nfective as they are not accompanied with verifying affidavit by\n\nplaintiffs or their attorneys as it is main requirement under law.\n\nThe concerned provision \nof CPC\n is reproduced here under;\n\n \"Order III Rule 15. Verification of pleadings.--\n\n (1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being\n in force, every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the party\n or by one of the parties pleading or by some other person\n proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with\n the facts of the case.\n\n (2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the\n numbered paragraphs of the pleading, what he verifies of his\n own knowledge and what he verifies upon information received\n and believed to be true.\n\n (3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it\n and shall state the date on which and the place at which it was\n signed.\n\n (4) The person verifying the pleading shall also furnish an\n affidavit in support of his pleadings.\"\n\n 46 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 74. Here in this case, in both the amended plaints, there is no\n\nverification portion and no verification affidavit. If pleader has is\n\nacquainted with case, then why he has not verified the amended\n\nplaint has remained unanswered.\n\n 75. Further, the amended plaint is also treated as \"plead-\n\nings\" under Order VI Rule 1 as it adds/inserts something new\n\npleadings in the original plaint which shall have to be verified as\n\ntrue and correct. Further, Rule 3(2) in Chapter I of Karnataka Civil\n\nRules of Practice clearly gives meaning to the word \"Pleadings\" as;\n\n \"2) \"Pleadings\" shall include plaints, written statements,\n memoranda of appeals, cross-objections, original petitions,\n applications, counter statements, replies, rejoinders and ev-\n\n ery statement setting out the case of a party in the matter to\n which the pleadings relate.\"\n\n 76. Further, Chapter IV Rule 24 to 32 of Karnataka Civil Rules\n\nof Practice clearly say that the facts and pleadings shall be verified\n\nby the deponent and identified by a competent person.\n\n 77. Hence, the present amended plaints in this case which\n\nare the main source for adjudication of justice is not valid as per\n\nlaw because none of the plaintiffs, none of their attorneys and\n\nnone of their appointed pleaders verified the amended plaint as\n\ntrue and correct. Then, it gives presumption that the whole plaint\n\n 47 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nis bundle of non-existing facts as no one confirmed it as true and\n\ncorrect. In this viewpoint the suit is definitely not maintainable.\n\n 78. Moreover, as per Ex.P.1 the Special Power of Attorney\n\nexecuted by the plaintiff No 1 to 9 in favour of PW 1 hererin named\n\nL. Shivarama Reddy is executed on 25-10-2004. As per the dates\n\nnoted in the amended plaints and as on the date of order sheet on\n\nwhich they have produced are the subsequent dates from the date\n\nof execution of said SPA. One of the amended plaints is filed on 22-\n\n01-2008 and another amended plaint is filed on 04-08-2018, but\n\nboth does not contain signature of either plaintiffs or the SPA\n\nHolder anywhere in the amended plaint and they do not contain\n\nthe verification portion and verification affidavit. Then, as per their\n\nown default, the plaint filed by the plaintiffs itself is not maintain-\n\nable.\n\n 79. Now, in this regard, we have to go through the deposi-\n\ntion of PW 1 who is none other than alleged SPA holder of plain-\n\ntiffs. The said SPA is marked as Ex.P 1 as stated supra. Here it is im-\n\nportant to note that, though the suit is filed through GPA holder\n\nnamed S. Chandra Mouli Reddy, but the GPA executed in his favour\n\nis not produced by the plaintiffs. Further, the defendant No.24\n\nclaimed that the plaintiff No.7 died prior to filing of this suit and\n\n 48 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nthe said GPA has lost its validity on his death. But, the Hon'ble High\n\nCourt of Karnataka, as stated supra, opined that to the extent of\n\ndeceased defendant No.7 the said GPA is bad in law. That means\n\nwith regard to remaining plaintiffs, it will continue to be in force. If\n\nit is so, then while appointing another person as GPA/SPA, they\n\nought to cancel the previous GPA by due process of law or they\n\nought to give GPA combined with both the attorneys under single\n\nroof of a single GPA and whatever it may be they ought to\n\nrescind/revoke/cancel the previous GPA/SPA otherwise the present\n\nSPA is \"bad under law\" as both the SPA/GPA are executed for the\n\nsame purpose. If the earlier SPA holder/GPA holder died, then such\n\ncancellation does not arise. But in his cross examination PW 1 ad-\n\nmitted as the said S. Chandra Mouli is still alive as on cross exami-\n\nnation dated 25-07-2012 as:-\n\n \"7ನೇ ವಾದಿ ದಾವೆಯನ್ನು ಹೂಡಿದಾಗಲೇ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದರು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ 2\n ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ 9ನೇ ವಾದಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡರು. 9ನೇ ವಾದಿಗಳ ವಾರಸುದಾರರನ್ನು ಸೇರಿಸಲು\n ಮಾಹಿತಿಯನ್ನು ನನ್ನ ವಕೀಲರಿಗೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ಅವರು ಇನ್ನು ಮುಂದೆ ಅರ್ಜಿಯನ್ನು\n ಹಾಕಲಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ. ಮೊದಲು ದಾವಾ ಹಾಕಿದಾಗ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಪತ್ರ ಹೊ‍ಂದಿದ ಚಂದ್ರ ಮೌಳಿಯವರು\n ಇನ್ನು ಬದುಕಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ. ನಾನು ಸಹ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಪತ್ರವನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯನ್ನು\n ಕೊಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ.\"\n\n 80. Further as on cross examination dated 08-08-2012, he\n\nhas stated that:-\n\n 49 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n \" Chndramouli filed power of attorney to conduct the\n case. It is false to suggest that the said power of attorney\n given in favour of Chandramouli is not cancelled. It is false to\n suggest that without canceling the power of attorney given in\n favour of Chandramouli, I am giving evidence on the basis of\n power of attorney.\"\n\n 81. But, the plaintiffs neither produced the GPA executed in\n\nfavour of said S. Chandra Mouli Reddy nor produced deed of can-\n\ncellation of said GPA.\n\n 82. Further, in his cross examination dated 29-08-2012 made\n\nby the learned counsel for defendant No.1 and 2, PW 1 has stated\n\nas:-\n\n \"Ex.P 1 is my power of attorney. Ex.P.1 is signed by all\n the plaintiffs, ie., plaintiff Nos.1 to 9\".\n\n 83. On perusal of Ex.P 1, all the plaintiff Nos.1 to 9 put their\n\nsignature in the year 2004. But, the same PW 1, as stated supra, in\n\nhis cross examination dated 25-07-2012 stated that the plaintiff\n\nNo.7 died prior to filing of this suit and the plaintiff No.9 died 2\n\nyears prior to that date of evidence. As per cause title of the plaint,\n\nthe name of Plaintiff No.7 is \"A M Rami Reddy.\" According to PW 1\n\nhimself, he died prior to filing of this suit. On perusal of Ex.P 1 the\n\nname of Plaintiff No.7 is mentioned in the array of persons who ex-\n\necuted said SPA. In the signatures, the signature of A. M. Rami\n\n 50 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nReddy found in every pages of Ex.P 1. Then, how a dead person put\n\nhis signature on this SPA. Surprising point is one Advocate who\n\nhad enrollment number as KAR/1958/1995 has identified the par-\n\nties to Ex.P 1. Further, Notary public name M.G. Uthappa (Regd\n\n621) attested this document. In this regard, in page No.38 of his\n\ncross examination dated 16-11-2011 PW 1 has stated as:-\n\n \" I do not know how the signature of A.M. Rami Reddy came on\n Ex.P.1 dated 25.09.2004. I do not know when the said Rami\n Reddy died. I do not know the date of execution of Ex.P.1 before\n the Notary. I do not know before which Notary, Ex.P.1 was exe-\n cuted. It is false to suggest that we have fabricated the signa-\n ture of 7th plaintiff though he was not alive as on the date of\n Ex.P.1. It is false to suggest that the executants of Ex.P.1 not ap-\n peared before the Notary and not signed on Ex.P.1. On the last\n page of Ex.P.1, another date as 25.10.2004 is mentioned. It is\n false to suggest that Ex.P.1 is not a genuine document.\"\n\n 84. Another important false statement given by PW 1 in his\n\ncross examination is in page No.38, wherein he has stated as:-\n\n \" Myself also have give instruction to our Advocate for drafting\n the plaint. Entire family verified the Plaint averments. Sri\n Chandramouli, who has verified the Plaint averments, is not\n one of the plaintiff in OS No.3666/2003. It is false to suggest\n that Sri Chandramouli had no power to verify the plaint aver-\n ments in OS 3666/2003. I do not know regarding not produc-\n ing Power of Attorney of Chandramouli Reddy. It is false to\n\n 51 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n suggest that without power of attorney, Chandramouli Reddy\n has presented the suit in OS 3666/2003\".\n\n 85. But, as discussed supra, none of the plaintiffs verified the\n\nplaint and even not only them, this PW 1 has also not verified\n\namended plaint which are filed after execution of SPA in his favour.\n\n 86. Further, in page No.39, PW 1 stated as:-\n\n \" I do not know the date of death of Plaintiff No.9 - K. Ra-\n machandra Reddy. Plaintiff No.9 is my brother's son. Plaintiff\n No.9 died about 6-7 years back. It is false to suggest that\n plaintiffs are not in possession of the suit schedule property.\"\n\n 87. Then it is clear that this SPA is not maintainable in respect\n\nof plaintiff No 9 too. If the plaintiff No.9 died before 6-7 year prior\n\nto 16-11-2011, the date of that cross examination, then definitely\n\nplaintiff No.9 also died prior to execution of that SPA. If the signa-\n\nture of two persons are forged in a document, that means the\n\nwhole document is treated as fabricated, because, it shows either\n\ninvolvement of other plaintiffs to fabricate or fabrication by SPA\n\nholder himself by impersonation of other plaintiffs or SPA holders,\n\nwho is unduly influenced or misrepresented by remaining plaintiffs\n\nor remaining plaintiffs are unduly influenced by SPA holders as vis\n\na vis/ vise versa, finally the finding of this court is that Ex.P.1 and all\n\nthe GPAs executed in favour of S. Chandra Mouliu Reddy which are\n\n 52 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nmarked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19 are fabricated documents, because\n\nwithout describing their right, title and interest over the suit sched-\n\nule property and without mentioning as to through which title/\n\ndeeds they became absolute owners of that properties, the said\n\nGPAs are executed. Where there is no proper authority, right and\n\ntitle and power to be identified over the property, then no power\n\nor authority would be handed over to GPA Holder. To execute\n\npower through GPA, first of all the executant shall have power over\n\nthat properties.\n\n 88. The fact that a dead person signed a document, means\n\ndefinitely it is fabricated document as the death of defendant No.7\n\nprior to the date of G.P.A. is admitted by P.W.1.\n\n 89. On perusal of original plaint, only the GPA Holder S.\n\nChandra Mouli Reddy put his signature as discussed supra. The\n\nsuit is filed in the year 2003. Ex.P.1 is executed in the year 2004.\n\nEvidence of PW 1 has commenced on 26-10-2004. Then, not only\n\nthe GPA of Plaintiff No.7 but also GPA of Plaintiff No.9 is bad in law\n\nas he was no more as on the date of 25-07-2012 that is the date of\n\ncross examination PW 1 as he admitted that Plaintiff No.9 died two\n\nyears prior to that cross examination.\n\n 53 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 90. Importantly, in page No 26 of cross examination of PW 1,\n\nthe learned counsel for defendant confronted copies of GPAs\n\nexecuted by the plaintiffs in favour of S.Chandra Mouli Reddy con-\n\nfronted to PW 1 and they are got marked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19, he\n\nadmitted that documents and the portion of deposition at that\n\ncross examination is reproduced here under as it gives effect on\n\nthese Issues as the suit is not maintainable;\n\n \" It is true to say that one Chandramouli Reddy filed this suit\n as a General Power of Attorney holder of plaintiffs. It is true to\n say that there are Xerox copies of seven General Power of Attor-\n neys issued by seven plaintiffs in favour of the said Chan-\n dramouli Reddy. I admit that now I see the said xerox copies\n which are confronted to me and they are marked as Ex.D.13 to\n D.19. The said Chandramouli Reddy is my elder brother's son.\n I can produce the originals of Ex.D.13 to D.19 provided the said\n Chandramouli give them to me. It is true to say that myself\n and the said Chandramouli Reddy are in good terms. It is true\n that as the said Chandramouli Reddy was not keeping good\n health, I am deposing on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n Learned counsel for the 3rd defendant asked a question to\n the witness, that the plaintiffs have not empowered the said\n Chandramouli Reddy to file this suit. Learned counsel for the\n plaintiff submitted that as the said defence has not been taken\n by the defendants. It should not be allowed to ask the said\n question as it is a question of law. Heard. As the question in-\n volved is a question of law and the said question need not be\n pleaded and any defendant or adversary can raise the question\n\n 54 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nof law even without the writtens statement. Hence the question\nis allowed.\n\n It is not true to say that the plaintiffs have not authorised the\nsaid Chandramouli Reddy to file the plaint as such the plaint it-\nself is not maintainable.\"\n\n 91. Now, on perusal of Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19;\n\n Ex.D 13 is the copy of GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed by A.G\n\n Shivashankar Reddy (Plaintiff No 1) and A.G. Jayarama Reddy\n\n (not party in this case) executed in favour of favour of Chan-\n\n dra Mouli Reddy S/o.A.L. Subbaiah and in that document\n\n schedule II is the plaint schedule herein;\n\n Ex.D 14 is the copy of GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed by S.\n\n Ramachandra Reddy (Plaintiff No 2) and S. Gopala Reddy (not\n\n party in this case) , G. Srinivasa Reddy (Plaintiff No 5),\n\n Venkata Reddy ( plaintiff No 3), S. Shankar Reddy (not party\n\n to his case), executed in favour of favour of Chandra Mouli\n\n Reddy S/o. A.L. Subbaiah and in that document, schedule II is\n\n the plaint schedule herein. Surprising point in this document\n\n is after the name of second plaintiff herein, the names of his\n\n legal heirs are arrayed as 1(a) to 1(d). None of the legal heirs\n\n of other executors are mentioned. Then, the question will\n\n arise at the time of execution of that GPA whether plaintiff\n\n No.2 was also alive or not.\n\n 55 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n Ex.D.15 is the another GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed in re-\n\n spect of same property in Ex.D 12 and Ex.D 13 by M. Pasala\n\n Reddy S/o. Late Chikkamuniswamy, P.Munireddy S/o.\n\n Pasalareddy (not party here), Lakshmidevamma W/o. Late Ja-\n\n yaramareddy, M. Krishna Reddy, M. Srinivasa reddy, M. Muni\n\n Reddy Govinda Reddy, G. Nagaraja Reddy, Srinivasa Reddy,\n\n Kamalakshmma, (they are not parties to this case), Venkata\n\n Reddy (plaintiff No.3) , Pradeep Reddy (not party here) exe-\n\n cuted in favour of favour of Chandra Mouli Reddy S/o. A L\n\n Subbaiah. Surprising point in this document is this document\n\n is also executed on the same day that is 24-04-2004.\n\n Another surprising point is if we go through Ex.D 16 to Ex.D\n\n 19, all are the similar GPAs executed on the same date ie., on\n\n 24-04-2000 by different persons in favour of the very same S.\n\n Chandra Mouli Reddy in respect of same property which is\n\n suit schedule property herein. In all these documents, it is\n\n stated that they are owners of property in Sy.No. 69 of Har-\n\n alakunte village and Sy.No. 31 Yellukunte village, but there is\n\n no explanation about how they acquired that properties. Fur-\n\n ther, if we compare it with above reproduced portion of cross\n\n examination of PW 1, it creates cloud on the ownership of\n\n the plaintiffs over the suit schedule property. In such a junc-\n\n 56 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n ture, the plaintiffs ought to have brought this Chandra Mouli\n\n to witness box, but they have not taken any pain to do so\n\n which leads to presumption under Section 114 of Indian Evi-\n\n dence Act as all the GPAs are created for the purpose of this\n\n case or to grab the properties mentioned in this suit as nei-\n\n ther the parties put their signature in any of the plaints (in-\n\n cluding amended plaint).\n\n 92. Further, in page Nos.28 and 29 of his cross examination\n\nPW 1 has stated as;\n\n \" It is true that in Ex.P.2, it is mentioned that \"the genealogical\n tree is according our statement and we have signed admitting\n the contents thereof\". It is true that Ex.P.2 does not contain\n anybody's signatures. It is not true to say that, the persons\n shown in Ex.P.2 are not the members of the families as shown\n in it and that we have created Ex.P.2 for the purpose of this\n suit. Now I see one signature shown to me, but I cannot iden-\n tify the said signature. The said signature is of the vakalath of\n A.C.Sudarshana Reddy filed in LAC No.381/86-87 which is\n available in the records summoned from BDA. Now I see the\n claim petition filed in LAC 381/86-87 but I cannot identify the\n signatures forthcoming in the documents. Now I see claim pe-\n tition filed in LAC 378/1986-87, but I cannot say who had\n signed the said claim petition. Now I see claim petition shown\n to me of LAC No.381/86-87 but I cannot identify the signa-\n tures. It is true to say that in the said claim petition my name\n is shown as the 5th claimant but I have not signed it.\n\n 57 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n Now I am shown the claim petition of LAC No.379/86-87,\n but I cannot identify any of the signatures found in it. So also\n the signatures that are forthcoming in the possession taking\n mahazar of LAC No.376/87-88. Now I see the affidavit accom-\n panying I.A. filed under O.7 R14(d) \nof CPC\n the signature found\n on the said document is of mine. Now I see Ex.P.1 the Special\n Power of Attorney executed by the plaintiffs but I cannot iden-\n tify all the signatures on the said document. I only identify the\n signatures of A.L. Nanjunda Reddy.\"\n\n 93. Then, PW 1 himself failed to prove his own document that\n\nis Ex.P 1 as he is unable to identify the signatures of parties to Ex.P\n\n1.\n\n 94. Further, in page No 30 of his cross examination the PW 1\n\nhas stated as:-\n\n \" It is not true to say that, all the plaintiffs are hale and healthy.\n I do not know, is there any difficulty to some of the plaintiffs\n who are healthy to come over to the Court and to give evi-\n dence. It is not true to say that, myself colluding with the plain-\n tiff have filed this suit in order to knock off the valuable prop-\n erty of the 3rd defendant. It is not true to say that, though the\n 7th plaintiff is no more, we had filed this suit without having\n any right or title over the suit schedule property in order to\n grab the suit schedule property. It is not true to say that, with\n the apprehension that if the plaintiffs appear before the Court\n the truth will come out, I am deposing falsely pretending to be\n a General Power of Attorney holder of the plaintiffs. It is not\n true to say that myself and my family members are used to\n\n 58 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n knock off the Government properties by creating false docu-\n ments.\"\n\n 95. Moreover, in page No 13 of his cross examination con-\n\nducted by the learned counsel for defendant No.3 on 29-10-2004,\n\nPW 1 has stated and admitted on GPA as:-\n\n \"All the plaintiffs have executed Special Power of Attor-\n ney in my favour to prosecute the suit at Agara Village, Banga-\n lore. All the plaintiffs had joined in my house to execute the\n said Special Power of Attorney ie., Ex.P.1. On 24th and 25th of\n October the plaintiffs had executed the Special Power of Attor-\n ney. In the evenings of 24th and 24th of October the plaintiffs\n had executed the Special Power of Attorney but I cannot say\n now the exact time and day of the each plaintiff executed the\n said document and now I cannot say on which exact date I had\n obtained the signature of the notary on Ex.P.1. On that day, we\n took the notary to my house to get executed Ex.P.1. Now I see\n Ex.P.2, it is true to say that I cannot say on which date each of\n the deceased persons died. It is true to say that Ex.P.2 was ob-\n tained during the year 1999. It is true that in Ex.P.2 which was\n issued on 12.04.1999, A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy is\n shown as dead by that time. But I do not know when exactly\n A.M.Rama Reddy died. It is true that in Ex.P.1, it is shown that\n 7th plaintiff A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy has signed\n Ex.P.1 on October 24th or 25th 2004. It is true to say that in the\n plaint, it is shown that A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy\n as 7th plaintiff. It is not true to say that I do not have any\n knowledge about the contents of the plaint and about the facts\n\n 59 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n of this case. It is not true to say that 7 th plaintiff is a fictitious\n person created for the purpose of this suit.\"\n\n 96. But, as discussed supra, Ex.P 1 clearly shows that it is exe-\n\ncuted in respect of OS No.3666/2003. PW 1 admitted above that as\n\non the date of Ex.P.1, plaintiff No.7 was dead. As on the date of\n\ncross examination, plaintiff No.9 was dead. Plaintiffs have not\n\ntaken any pain to bring their legal representatives on record, which\n\nshows the attitude of power of attorneys of this case.\n\n 97. But, plaintiffs/PW 1 has not produced the documents\n\nwhich show the health condition of the plaintiffs who are alleged to\n\nbe facing health issues and they did not take any pain to come be-\n\nfore the court to tell the truth. Further, in such situations, to prove\n\ntheir case, they have not made any effort to appoint court commis-\n\nsioner to record evidence directly from the mouth of either of\n\nplaintiffs which shows they have utterly failed to prove that they\n\nhave duly executed and authenticated the Power of Attorney in\n\nfavour of Chandra Mouli Reddy to verify the plaint and to file the\n\npresent suit. Further they have failed to prove that they have duly\n\nexecuted and authenticated the power of attorney in favour of\n\nPW1/ L. Shivarama Reddy to give evidence on their behalf in this\n\nsuit. On the other hand, the defendant No.24 proved that as on the\n\n 60 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ndate of the suit, plaintiff No.7 was no more and the plaintiffs filed\n\ntheir suit through power of attorney holder, is bad in law. Further,\n\nnot only defendant No.24 but also all the defendants who cross ex-\n\namined PW 1 proved that the Power of Attorney produced by the\n\nplaintiffs belongs not only to Mr. Chandra Mouli Reddy, but also\n\nSPA executed in favour of PW 1/L. Shivarama Reddy are fabricated\n\ndocuments as a dead person signed on that documents, then\n\nwhole document will become void, since how the attesting and\n\nidentifying person put their signature on such power of attorneys.\n\nAs per above discussions and reasons, whole suit is not maintain-\n\nable accordingly, the defendants proved that the suit is not main-\n\ntainable.\n\n 98. Therefore, as per the facts and circumstances of the case\n\nand on the basis of above discussions, this court is of the consid-\n\nered opinion that Ex.P 1 and Ex.D 13 to Ex.P 19 are fabricated docu-\n\nment as PW 1 stated that the said S. Chandra Mouli Reddy still alive\n\nand if this court do not recognizes the fabrication of that docu-\n\nments here, though no Issues are framed in that regard, then\n\nthere is a chance of multiplicity of proceedings and further chance\n\nof filing false suit by using said GPAs. Here this court has every au-\n\nthority to recognize it as fabricated on the basis of above discus-\n\nsions as originally this suit was filed by the plaintiffs/GPA holder of\n\n 61 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nthe plaintiffs (S. Chandra Mouli Reddy) on the basis of either of\n\nEx.D 13 to Ex.D 19. Further, this court finds that this suit is not\n\nmaintainable as discussed supra as the suit is filed by dead person\n\nand the due procedure of law is not followed while filing the plaint\n\nand amended plaints are not signed by either parties or GPA\n\nholder and they have not verified them and they are not attached\n\nwith verifying affidavit. Only the learned counsel for plaintiffs put\n\nhis signature on the amended plaints which is not tenable under\n\nlaw. Accordingly, this Court answers Addl.Issue No.3 dated 24-02-\n\n2011, Addl.Issue No.2 and 3 dated 30-08-2018 in the Affirmative.\n\nAddl.Issue No 4 and 5 dated 24-02-2016 are answered in the Nega-\n\ntive.\n\n 99. Issue No 1 to 4, Addl.Issue No 1 and 2 dated 24-02-\n\n2011, Addl.Issue No 1 dated 30-08-2018 :\n\n Though as per above discussions, it is clear that the this suit\n\nis not maintainable and this case is a false case, the main docu-\n\nments through which the suits are filed are fabricated and the orig-\n\ninal plaintiffs anyway never-ever come before the court and further\n\nthe GPA holder through whom this suit is filed that is S. Chandra\n\nMouli Reddy also did not appear before the court and evidence\n\nlead by another GPA that is Shivarama Reddy, than the GPA holder\n\nwho filed this suit etc., are enough to dismiss this suit, but for full-\n\n 62 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nfledged judgment and to avoid third round litigation as this is sec-\n\nond round litigation as it is remitted case by Hon'ble High Court of\n\nKarnataka as stated above and hence to avoid all the above, this\n\nCourt gone through remaining Issues which are regarding facts\n\nand law connected to subject matter of this suit.\n\n 100. These, Seven Issues are inter-connected to each other,\n\nhence to avoid repeated discussions they are taken up together\n\nhere under;\n\n On perusal of plaint, the plaintiffs have filed this case without\n\nprayer for declaration of their ownership and title and they prayed\n\nfor declaration of the order passed by the 1 st defendant in RD 197\n\nLGB, 2003 dated 17-04-2003 as non est in the eye of law. Surprising\n\npoint is nowhere in the plaint they narrated about their title and\n\nownership of the property and they filed this suit by stating that as\n\na joint family they enjoyed and in possession of suit schedule prop-\n\nerty and their ancestor Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank\n\nin the suit schedule properties in 1890's and on that basis now,\n\nthey are claiming to declare the above stated order as non-est. In\n\nthe plaint, they narrated about the previous litigation and con-\n\nnected litigation in respect of property in Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte\n\nvillage which shows that these plaintiffs made separate similar liti-\n\ngation pertaining to this suit schedule property which is coming\n\n 63 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nunder properties in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte village and in respect of\n\nproperty in Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte village. Surprising point is in\n\nalleged GPAs which are marked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19, they inserted\n\nboth the properties in GPAs, but here in this Ex.P 1, just mentioned\n\nas to prosecute in OS No 3666/2003. Nowhere in the plaint, there is\n\npleading about their clear title and the contentions raised by the\n\ndefendants in the written statements create cloud about the title\n\nand possession of the plaintiffs, despite that, the plaintiffs have not\n\nprayed for declaration of their title which shows they are trying to\n\nget the fruit in the case by avoiding payment of court fee, by just\n\npaying Rs.75/- to the extent of 15 acre 11 guntas of land without\n\nmentioning whether it is agricultural or converted land in both\n\nbody of the plaint and also the plaint schedule and thus on the\n\nplain reading of the plaint itself, it shows clever drafting.\n\n 101. Next to that, the said alleged order dated 17-04-2003 is\n\npassed by defendant No.1 who is the Principal Secretary of\n\nRevenue Department which is marked as Ex.P 31.

Then, in that proceedings the concerned authority by\n\ndue process considered that the suit schedule properties are gov-\n\nernment tank bed area and there is no pending litigation on the\n\nsame. While filing of this case, the plaintiffs have clear knowledge\n\nabout this order as main prayer is to declare the said order as non-\n\nest, then definitely plaintiffs shall pray for declaration of their title\n\nas the said order tells that suit schedule property is government\n\nland. As per plaint pleadings itself, the plaintiffs relied upon ge-\n\nnealogical tree only with regard to their ownership over the prop-\n\nerty. They have not pleaded as to how their ancestors acquired the\n\nsaid property. There is no single piece of document of title of an-\n\ncestors of plaintiffs such as \"document of Government grant such\n\nas inams or in any other way of government grant or purchase\n\ndeeds/sale deeds\". Further, there is no narration about any ad-\n\nverse possession of plaintiffs which is hostile to the title of the de-\n\n 67 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nfendants which shows that plaintiffs themselves tied their hands\n\nto get relief in future by way of \"adverse possession\" as by filing of\n\nthis suit \"they surrendered their right of adverse possession if any\"\n\nover the suit schedule property for present and future in respect of\n\nthis suit schedule property.\n\n 106. Further Ex.P 31 and 31(a) clearly say the matter is con-\n\nnected to \"land acquisition\" for BDA, then, plaintiffs without taking\n\naction before competent authority filed this suit by invoking civil\n\nnature, which clearly shows the attitude of the plaintiffs, in which\n\nthey are trying to get \"multiple benefits by throwing a stone\" as\n\nwithout payment of court fee, knowing that their title is in cloud\n\nwithout making prayer for declaration of their title and and trying\n\nto get relief by filing in wrong Court though \nSection 5\n of CPC gives\n\nclear provision of bar to file such suits where the special law re-\n\ngarding revenue matter existed and bars the jurisdiction of civil\n\ncourt and \nSection 5\n of CPC reproduced here under as the plaintiffs\n\nhave clear knowledge that for their claim, the doors of Land Acqui-\n\nsition Act and connected revenue Acts are closed;\n\n \"5. Application of the Code to Revenue Courts.--(1)\n Where any Revenue Courts are governed by the provisions of\n this Code in those matters of procedure upon which any spe-\n cial enactment applicable to them is silent, the State Govern-\n ment 2*** may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare\n\n 68 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n that any portions of those provisions which are not expressly\n made applicable by this Code shall not apply to those Courts,\n or shall only apply to them with such modifications as the\n State Government 3*** may prescribe.\n\n (2) \"Revenue Court\" in sub-section (1) means a Court\n having jurisdiction under any local law to entertain suits or\n other proceedings relating to the rent, revenue or profits of\n land used for agricultural purposes, but does not include a\n Civil Court having original jurisdiction under this Code to try\n such suits or proceedings as being suits or proceedings of a\n civil nature.\"\n\n A \"Revenue Court\" as a Court with original jurisdiction\n under this Code to try suits or proceedings relating to the rent,\n revenue, or income of land used for agricultural purposes, it\n does not provide a Civil Court with original jurisdiction under\n this Code to try such suits or proceedings as civil suits or pro-\n ceedings.\n\n 107. Then, it is clear that plaintiffs, if they want to get relief\n\nthrough civil court with regard to cause of action of this suit, then\n\nthey have two options;\n\n  they ought to produce clear title deed;\n\n  they ought to make prayer of declaration of their title and\n\n ownership as without clear title they do not get relief of dec-\n\n laration of the order of revenue officer as non-est as prayed\n\n in prayer (a).\n\n 69 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 108. Further, PW 1 has produced Ex.P 36 and Ex.P 37 which are\n\nthe orders passed in LAC No.143/1988 and LAC No.144/1988 in re-\n\nspect of Sy.No.7 and Sy.No.8 of Yellakunte village and in Ex.P 31\n\nand Ex.P 31(a), it is stated that suit schedule properties are govern-\n\nment tank bed land, makes it clear that since 1988 itself, suit\n\nschedule property belongs to government as if these plaintiffs\n\nclaim their title then at that time itself they ought to file LAC case.\n\n 109. Further, after receiving of entire records in OS No 4830/96,\n\nPW 1 has stated in page No 33 as:-\n\n \" Now I see the entire records of OS 4830/96 called from\n CCH No.9. I admit that the plaintiffs herein had filed the said\n suit along with some other plaintiffs I admit it. Hence the en-\n tire records of OS 4830/96 is marked as Ex.D.20 I cannot iden-\n tify the signatures that are forthcoming on the plaint of OS\n 4830/96. So also about the signatures that are present in the\n vakalath. Now I see the withdrawal memo filed in OS 4830/96\n as I was not present when the said parties signed the said\n memo, I cannot identify who have signed the said memo. It is\n true to say that we do not have any other documents with re-\n gard to the suit schedule property other than the documents\n produced by us before the Court. N A RFA is pending before\n the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka with regard to the suit\n schedule property and re-survey No.69 of Haralukunte village.\n But I do not know the exact RFA number.\"\n\n 70 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 110. On perusal of Ex.D 20, it shows that the said suit was filed\n\nfor declaration and injunction by plaintiff No.8 and others herein\n\nagainst the defendant which shows that plaintiffs are trying to\n\navoid bar by res-judicata by filing suits on same cause of action and\n\nsubject matter by arraying different plaintiffs by mingling up and\n\njumbling up in different cases and different LAC proceedings.\n\n \n111. At this juncture, it is apt to refer to the guidelines laiddown\n\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nAnathula Sudhakar v/s Buchch Reddy\n\ncase as herein this case, there is no supporting document for their\n\ntitle, which creates cloud as there is no document of their posses-\n\nsion too over the suit schedule property which is mandatory under\n\nthe guidelines given by Hon'ble Apex Court in Anathula sudhakara\n\nvs Buchi Reddy and the relevant portion of the judgment is repro-\n\nduced here under;\n\n \n\"\nAnathula Sudhakar vs P Buchi Reddy\n (2008) 4 SCC 594) in\n which guidelines given by Hon'ble Apex Court as;\n \"17. To summarize, the position in regard to suits for\n prohibitory injunction relating to immovable property, is as\n under:\n\n (a) Where a cloud is raised over plaintiff's title and he does\n not have possession, a suit for declaration and possession, with\n or without a consequential injunction, is the remedy. Where the\n plaintiff's title is not in dispute or under a cloud, but he is out\n of possession, he has to sue for possession with a\n\n 71 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nconsequential injunction. Where there is merely an interference\nwith plaintiff's lawful possession or threat of dispossession, it is\nsufficient to sue for an injunction simpliciter.\n\n (b) As a suit for injunction simpliciter is concerned only with\npossession, normally the issue of title will not be directly and\nsubstantially in issue. The prayer for injunction will be decided\nwith reference to the finding on possession. But in cases where\nde jure possession has to be established on the basis of title to\nthe property, as in the case of vacant sites, the issue of title\nmay directly and substantially arise for consideration, as\nwithout a finding thereon, it will not be possible to decide the\nissue of possession.\n\n (c) But a finding on title cannot be recorded in a suit for\ninjunction, unless there are necessary pleadings and\nappropriate issue regarding title [either specific, or implied as\nnoticed in Annaimuthu Thevar (supra)]. Where the averments\nregarding title are absent in a plaint and where there is no\nissue relating to title, the court will not investigate or examine\nor render a finding on a question of title, in a suit for\ninjunction. Even where there are necessary pleadings and issue,\nif the matter involves complicated questions of fact and law\nrelating to title, the court will relegate the parties to the remedy\nby way of comprehensive suit for declaration of title, instead of\ndeciding the issue in a suit for mere injunction.\n\n (d) Where there are necessary pleadings regarding title, and\nappropriate issue relating to title on which parties lead\nevidence, if the matter involved is simple and straight-forward,\nthe court may decide upon the issue regarding title, even in a\nsuit for injunction. But such cases, are the exception to the\n\n 72 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n normal rule that question of title will not be decided in suits for\n injunction. But persons having clear title and possession suing\n for injunction, should not be driven to the costlier and more\n cumbersome remedy of a suit for declaration, merely because\n some meddler vexatiously or wrongfully makes a claim or tries\n to encroach upon his property. The court should use its\n discretion carefully to identify cases where it will enquire into\n title and cases where it will refer to plaintiff to a more\n comprehensive declaratory suit, depending upon the facts of\n the case.\"\n\n 112. Then, this suit is definitely not maintainable as there is no\n\nprayer for declaration of title.\n\n 113. Further, in the cross examination of PW 1, he admitted\n\nabout LAC proceedings which establishes bar of this suit for want\n\nof jurisdiction as PW 1 admitted that the suit claim is rooted with\n\nLAC proceedings. In page No 16 of cross examination of PW 1, he\n\nhas stated that :-\n\n \"It is not true to say that in the LAC proceedings we have\n\n stated that the said Sudarshan Reddy belongs to the branch of\n\n A.P. Ramaiah S/o. Pasalareddy.\"\n\n 114. Here important to note that PW 1 has not denied the LAC\n\nproceedings initiated by plaintiffs. In page Nos. 17 to 20 of his\n\ncross examination, he admitted and identified the documents\n\n 73 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\npertaining to different survey numbers mentioned in Ex.P 31 and\n\nEx.P 31(a) and also admitted LAC proceedings on Sy.No 13 and also\n\nadmitted that the said survey number renumbered as Sy.No 31\n\nwhich is suit schedule property and also admitted that in the said\n\ndocument, it is noted as government land and in this regard Ex.D 3\n\nto Ex.D 10 are got marked through confrontation and avoid\n\nambiguity the same portion of deposition are reproduced here\n\nunder though it is lengthy;\n\n \"I am not aware of the fact that LAC proceedings with\n regard to Survey No.7 of Yellukunte Village were held in LAC\n No.378/86-87 before the Land Acquisition Office, LAC\n No.379/86-87 with regard to Survey No.8, LAC No.380/86-87\n with regard to Survey No.9, LAC No.381/86-87 with regard to\n Survey No.10, LAC No.386/86-87 with regard to Survey No.30.\n Now, I see one document which is now marked as Ex.D.3. It is\n true to say that Ex.D.3 I with regard to LAC proceedings with\n regard to Survey No.7, so also Ex.D4 with regard to Survey\n No.8. Now, I see a document which is shown to me with\n regard to Survey No.9, but I am not aware of the said fact. I\n am not aware of the fact that the plaintiffs herein might have\n participated in the LAC proceedings with regard to Survey\n No.9. Now, I see a document which is shown to me with\n regard to Survey no.10 which is now marked as Ex.D.5. It is\n true to say that Ex.D5 is with regard to the LAC proceedings of\n Survey No.10/1 & 10/2. Now, I see one document shown to me\n which is now marked as Ex.D.6. It is true to say that Ex.D6 is\n\n 74 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nwith regard to the pahchayat Parikath entered within the\nfamily including the plaintiffs and myself. The said panchayat\nParikath is with regard to the family partition within our\nfamily of the property acquired by BDA and some of the\nproperties of our family which were acquired by BDA are not\nmentioned in the said Parikath. Now I see another document\nwhich is now marked as Ex.D.7. I admit that we had filed the\nsaid document before the LAC Officer, but he had not accepted\nthe same. It is not true to say that Ex.D.7 contains all the\nproperties of our joint family. Now I see one RTC ad one katha\ncertificate, but it is not true to say that the said documents are\nproduced by us in the LAC proceedings to show the division of\nthe entire property of our joint family. Without verifying the\nrecords, I cannot say the description of our joint family, which\nare not mentioned in Ex.D.7. It is not true to say that our joint\nfamily does not possess any property other than mentioned in\nEx.D.7 as such we have not mentioned about those properties\nin Ex.D.7. I do not now one Pasala Reddy of our family had\nfiled an application before the Special Tahsildar, Bangalore\nSouth Taluk on 26.12.1974 requesting for the grant of\noccupancy right with respect to Survey No.7 of Yellukunte\nVillage to an extent of one acre 24 guntas. As there are three\nto four Pasala Reddys in our family now I cannot say which of\nthe Pasala Reddy has filed the said Form No.7 with regard to\nSurvey no.7. It is not true to say that in the said Form No.7 the\nsaid Pasala Reddy has shown that the khathedar and owner of\nSurvey no.7 is Basavanna Devaru. It is not true to say that, in\nthe said Form No.7, in the khathedar and land lord column,\nthe name of Basavanna Devaru is shown.\n\n 75 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n Now I see one document shown to me which is now marked\n as Ex.D8. It is true to say that BDA has acquired an extent of\n 24 acres 7 guntas in Survey No.13 of Yellukunte Village\n according to the document. It is true to say that none of our\n family members including the plaintiffs and myself had filed\n any objections with regard to the acquisition of of any extent\n of land as shown in Ex.D.8. It is not true to say that, as we\n were not the owners of any part of land in Survey No.13, we\n had not filed any objections for the acquisition of the said\n survey numbers (the witness volunteers) as we are the owners\n of the lands of Survey No.13 which is now a part of re-survey\n number 31. Now I see one document shown to me and I\n admit it and marked as Ex.D.9. It is true to say that it is the\n Tippani Uthar of re-survey number 31. It is true to say that\n according to Ex.D.9, an extent of 25 guntas of land has been\n taken into Survey No.13 to form resurvey number 31. Now I\n see another document shown to me I admit it and it is marked\n as Ex.D.10. It is true that Ex.D.10 is an Index of land of Survey\n No.13. It is true that in Ex.D.10, it is shown that 25 guntas of\n land has been taken from survey No.13 for the purpose of\n tank, which is n ow a part of re-sruvey No.31. It is true to say\n that in Ex.D.10, it is shown that Sarkari Musathu Kaval.\"\n\n 115. Further, in his cross examination, he has stated that he and\n\nplaintiffs are relatives and they are owners of 25 guntas of land in\n\nSy.No.13, but no single document of ownership is produced.\n\nTherefore, suit is not maintainable without prayer for declaration\n\nof title.\n\n 76 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 116. Evidently, the suit is not maintainable and further, the\n\ngenealogy which is marked as Ex.P 2 is also not genuine as it is not\n\ncorresponding with paragraph 2 of the plaint and same is admitted\n\nin the cross examination of PW 1. Mainly, the plaintiffs based their\n\ncase on family tree stating in paragraph 3 of the plaint as their\n\nentire joint family as evidenced by the genealogical tree owned\n\nand possessed joint ancestral properties and they included\n\nproperty in Sy.No 69 of Haralakunte village which is not the subject\n\nmatter of this suit. The instant case may be first of its kind, wherein\n\nthe plaintiffs for filing a suit for declaration and perpetual\n\ninjunction regarding ancestral property, relying only upon family\n\ntree without producing a single document of title deed of their\n\nancestors.\n\n 117. As per paragraph 2 of the plaint, one can identify the\n\nrelationship of Linga Reddy and his sons only, but we cannot\n\nidentify the plaintiffs are children of whom as the main base of this\n\ncase is genealogy. On perusal of Ex.P 2, they have produced\n\ngenealagy of Thimma Reddy (deceased) S/o. Linga Reddy. But, in\n\nthe plaint, it is stated that their genealogy is routed with original\n\nperson Linga Reddy. As per this Ex.P 2 the said Thimma Reddy had\n\ntwo sons they are Linga Reddy and Chikk Nanda Reddy. The said\n\nLinga Reddy had 4 children namely, father of Smt, Nanjamma,\n\n 77 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nLinga Reddy, Ravindra and Ramesh (the name of first son of Linga\n\nReddy is not visible in the document), Dr.L Narayana Reddy, Dr. L.\n\nSrinivasa Reddy and L. Rama Reddy. But none of them are plaintiffs\n\nhere in. Chikka Nanda Reddy had a son by name Chikka Ramaiah\n\n(deceased). The children of this deceased Chikka Ramaiah is shown\n\nas Papamma, A. C. Sudarshana Reddy (defendant No. 6), A. C.\n\nPrakash and A. C. Srinivasa Reddy. No plaintiffs other than plaintiff\n\nNo.6 are found in this genealogy. Surprising point is in paragraph\n\n2 of the plaint, wherein it is specifically stated that plaintiffs have\n\nproduced this Ex.P 2 in proof of their case. But, in first sight itself,\n\nwithout going through cross examination of PW 1, as discussed\n\nsupra, the plaintiffs failed to prove their own genealogy. In Ex.P 2\n\nthe Ex.D 1 marked through confrontation and the portion of cross\n\nexamination of PW 1 in page No 15 in respect of genealogy/Ex.P 2\n\nis reproduced here under to show that PW 1 utterly failed to prove\n\ngenealogy as,;\n\n \" It is true to say that there are no other male co coparcener\n present in the family of late Linga Reddy other than the\n persons who were born later than 1999. The name of the 3 rd\n plaintiff Venkatareddy son of Narayana Reddy is shown in\n Ex.P.2. the relevant portion is marked as Ex.D.1. It is true to\n say that as per Ex.D.1, it is shown that Venkatareddy son of\n Narayanareddy aged about 37 years. It is also true to say that\n in the plaint, the age of the 3rd plaintiff is shown as 58 years. It\n\n 78 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n is not true to say that there is no relation between the 3 rd\n plaintiff and the remaining plaintiffs and that 3rd plaintiff does\n not belong to the family of late Linga Reddy. The name of 6 th\n plaintiff Sudarshan Reddy is also shown I Ex.P.2. The relevant\n portion is now marked as Ex.D.2. It is true to say that it is\n forthcoming in Ex.D.2 that the said Sudarshan Reddy is the son\n of Chikkaramaiah who belongs to the family of Thimmaredy.\"\n\n 118. Then, plaintiffs failed to establish their relationship and\n\ngenealogy and hence, even on this count also, this suit is not\n\nmaintainable as the main base for this suit invoked by the plaintiffs\n\nis their joint family relationship. When, the joint family relationship\n\nis not proved then, there is no locus standi to the plaintiffs to claim\n\nsuit schedule property as their family properties.\n\n 119. As per Ex.P.31, the plaintiffs had knowledge that suit\n\nschedule property is tank bed area and in the plaint, they have\n\nstated that the said tank is constructed in 1980s by Pasalappa\n\nReddy.\n\n 120. On perusal of Ex.P 3 to Ex.P 65, all are related to LAC\n\nproceedings, RTCs and endorsements. There are no documents\n\nproduced to show that plaintiffs are in possession of suit schedule\n\nproperty. All these exhibits are enlisted at the end of this\n\njudgment. Without documents of possession, plaintiffs made\n\n 79 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nprayer (b) ie., not to dispossess them from plaint schedule\n\nproperty. When, plaintiffs failed to prove their joint family\n\nrelationship as supra, then how they claim to be in joint possession\n\nover that larger extent of suit schedule property? They did not pray\n\nfor declaration of their title and did not pray for handing over of\n\npossession from defendants and in his own cross examination, PW\n\n1 without giving chance to defendants to prove their possession,\n\nadmitted the possession of defendants in the suit schedule\n\nproperty as the same is reproduced here under;\n\n In page No 30 of his cross examination PW 1 admitted as:-\n\n \" It is true that one person has constructed house in the suit\n schedule property (the witness volunteers) there is Police\n protection in the suit schedule property and if we try to enter\n the suit schedule premises the Police will chase us out. It is\n not true to say that neither myself nor the said\n Chendramoulireddy had no proper authority to represent the\n plaintiffs and to file this suit and to give evidence in this suit.\"\n\n 121. Prior to that PW 1 in page No 22 admitted the property in\n\nSy.No 31 as government land as:-\n\n \"I am not aware of the fact that in the said writ petition, the\n 3rd defendant BDA was also made as a party. Now I see Ex.P.6\n it is issued by survey department. Now I see one document\n filed by me earlier said to be the typed copy of Ex.P.6, which is\n now marked as Ex.D.11. But I am not aware of the fact that the\n\n 80 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n said typed version was also filed by the 1 st plaintiff in the said\n writ petition. It is true that in Ex.D.11, it is mentioned that\n resurvey number 31 is mentioned as \"Sarkari Karabinanteh\"\n\n (ಸರ್ಕಾರಿ ಖರಾಬಿನಂತೆ) I am aware of the fact that the plaintiffs herein\n\n and some others earlier, had filed OS No.4830/96 with regard\n to the suit schedule property. Now I see Xerox copy of the\n plaint filed in OS No.4830/96. I admit it and it is now marked\n as Ex.D.12. Now I see Ex.D.12 and now I see para 27 of the\n plaint which is now marked as Ex.D.12(a). It is true to say that\n in the said plaint, it is stated that the RTCs of the suit schedule\n property from the years 1968-69 to 1993-94 were standing in\n the name of the plaintiffs. It is true that according to us, the\n said entries in the RTCs were made basing on the orders\n passed by the then learned District Deputy Commissioner in CL\n 1314/34-35 dated 25.11.1935. It is true that in the said order,\n the learned District Deputy Commissioner has only formed a\n new survey number from taking lands from survey No.7 to 10\n and 13. Now I see Ex.P.4. It is true that in Ex.P.4, it is\n mentioned as \"Sarkari karabu kere.\"\n\n 122. And further in page No.29, he admitted that BDA\n\ndeveloped suit schedule property as:-\n\n \"It is true that plaintiffs had filed an application for the\n grant of Temporary Injunction against the 3rd defendant. It is\n true that in the said affidavit, it has been stated that the BDA is\n trying to develop the entire suit schedule property. It is true\n that BDA has developed the suit schedule property, but it is not\n true to say that the entire suit schedule property has been\n\n 81 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n allotted by the BDA in favour of the allottees. I am not aware\n of the fact that BDA has allotted the entire suit schedule\n property to the allottees\".\n\n 123. From the above admission of PW1, he is not aware about\n\nallotment, but does not deny the allotment.\n\n 124. Further, in page No 37 of his cross examination PW 1\nadmitted as:-\n\n \"In Sy.No.31 of Yellagunte Village, 3rd defendant has formed\n roads, drainage. I do not know regarding defendant No.14\n constructed the house and residing there in.\"\n\n 125. Further, in page No 41 and 42 of his cross examination\n\nconducted by learned counsel for defendant No 15 and 16, PW 1\n\nhas stated as:-\n\n \"Plaintiffs have filed suit for title and possession. Suit\n property is part and parcel of Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village\n measuring 15 acres 11 guntas, Sy.Nos.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13\n comprised in Sy.No.31. I am unable to say to what extent the\n plaintiffs are the owners of the land in Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and\n\n 13. Pasara Reddy was the original owner of the suit property.\n He acquired the suit property under Sale Deed. I do not know\n who executed the sale deed in favour of of whom, because\n that sale transaction was taken place about 150 years ago. I\n have seen the documents produced by the plaintiffs in this\n case. I do not know the date, month and year of to the sale\n\n 82 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n deed of Pasara Reddy. I do not know who is the vendor of\n Pasara Reddy.\"\n\n 126. Even though we invoke \nSection 90\n of Indian Evidence Act\n\nabout documents which are more than 30 years old but plaintiff\n\nfailed to prove it by producing revenue documents, and without\n\nproducing title deeds or documents pertaining to grant of land.\n\n 127. Moreover, in page No 42 of his cross examination PW 1\n\nadmitted as:-\n\n \"After the death of Pasara Reddy, rounded off the name of\n Pasara Reddy and entered the name of the Government. But, I\n do not know in which year, the name of the Government\n recorded in the revenue records.\"\n\n 128. Then, plaintiff admitted the suit schedule property as\n\ngovernment land.\n\n 129. Including the above in last paragraph of page No 42 the\n\nPW 1 admitted as:-\n\n \"After death of Pasara Reddy, the property of Pasara Reddy\n was not transferred to the names of L.Rs., of Pasara Reddy\n through documents.\"\n\n 130. Then, it is clear that plaintiffs and legal representatives\n\nof Pasala Reddy (who allegedly the predecessor of plaintiffs who\n\n 83 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nalleged to have built a tank in suit schedule property ) are not the\n\nowners in possession of suit schedule property.\n\n 131. In page No. 43 of his cross examination PW 1 stated\n\nthat:-\n\n \"On approximate basis, the boundaries of the suit schedule\n property are mentioned in the plaint. No documents in order\n to show the boundaries of the suit property.\"\n\n 132. Then PW 1/Plaintiffs themselves failed to identify the\n\nsuit schedule property which is main ingredient to prove their case.\n\n 133. Next to that, the PW 1 himself admitted in page 43 of his\n\ncross-examination that tank is not built in plaint schedule property\n\nas:-\n\n \"Pasara Reddy constructed the tank in the original\n Sy.No.69. It is false to suggest that I have not produced any\n documents to show that Pasara Reddy constructed the tank.\"\n\n 134. In pages 43 and 44 of his cross-examination, PW 1\n\nfurther stated that:-\n\n \"It is false to suggest that Exs.P.27 to P.30 are the Xerox\n copies and Exs.P.27 to P.30 are created by me. I do not kn ow\n the sale deeds are executed in favour of defendants 15 and 16\n in respect of the suit sites. It is false to suggest that though the\n defendants 15 and 16 are the owners and in possession of the\n suit sites, I am deposing false evidence. It is false to suggest\n\n 84 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n that the plaintiffs have no documents to show that their\n possession over the suit property as on the date of the suit. It\n is false to suggest that we have filed this false suit in order to\n knock off the off government property\" which is reflected in\n evidence of D.W.3.\n\n 135. Finally, in the cross examination of PW 1 dated 08-08-\n\n2012 by the learned counsel for defendant No.23, in page 46, PW 1\n\nclearly admitted that BDA acquired and formed layout by stating\n\nas:-\n\n \"The BDA, with the help of Police, had acquired the land in\n Sy.no.31 in the year 1986 and formed the sites. I do not know\n how many sites were formed by the B.D.A. I know that\n H.S.R.Layout name is given to the land of Sy.No.31 and\n surrounding layouts. It is false to suggest that the BDA has\n formed the sites in the land of Sy.No.31 in the year 1986.\n About 07 years ago, the BDA has formed the sites in the land\n of Sy.No.31 with the aid of Police. I have not challenged the\n acquisition proceedings before the Hon'ble High Court of\n Karnataka, except filing of this suit.\"\n\n 136. Again in page No.60, PW 1 has admitted as:-\n\n \"The drainage are formed and provided civic amenities in\n the suit lands illegally with the help of Police. Few people have\n constructed houses in the suit lands.\"\n\n 85 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 137. Then it is clear that plaintiffs are not in possession of\n\nsuit schedule property.\n\n 138. The evidence of PW 1 gone contra to plaint pleadings as\n\nin plaint pleadings, they are stating that Pasala Reddy built tank in\n\nSy.No 31 which is suit schedule property, but in his cross\n\nexamination, twice in page No 43 and cross examination dated 29-\n\n08-2012 by the learned counsel for defendant No 1 and 2, stated\n\nthat tank constructed by his grand father in Sy.No.69 and also\n\nstated in same page as \"there is no tank in suit land.\"\n\n 139. There is further admission by PW 1 in cross examination\n\ndated 06-09-2012 by learned counsel for defendant No 3 as:-\n\n \" It is false to suggest that Preliminary and Final\n Notifications were issued in respect of suit schedule property.\n It is true to suggest that in the total extent of land, H.S.R\n Layout is formed. Few of us received the compensation\n amount in respect of .few lands.\"\n\n 140. If in total extent HSR layout is formed, there denial of\n\nnotifications, assumes insignifance. Therefore, as per facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case and above discussions, without other\n\nchoice to defendants, he himself failed to prove not only\n\nmaintainability of this suit, but also he failed to prove route/root\n\ncause of this suit as failed to prove genealogy on the basis of which\n\n 86 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nhe alleged that suit schedule property is their ancestral property,\n\nand further failed to prove the suit schedule property as his\n\nancestral property as he admitted that it is property of government\n\nand his great great father did not construct tank in suit schedule\n\nproperty and admitted that the suit schedule property is acquired\n\nby BDA and BDA formed HSR layout in suit schedule property and\n\nfailed to prove the possession of plaintiffs over the suit schedule\n\nproperty as they received compensation for BDA acquisition and\n\nBDA formed drainage system and provided civic amenities and\n\nadmitted that some other persons constructed houses in suit\n\nschedule property.\n\n 141. It is important to note that by summoning Special\n\nThahsilar as witness PW 2, the plaintiffs further taken their case to\n\nthe stage of bad to worse situation for them in their way of proving\n\ntheir case as in page No 7 of his evidence there is a note that:-\n\n \"Question : According to you what is the nature of the\n lands in Survey No.31 of Yellukunte Village?\n Answer:- It is a Government Tank.\n\n (At this stage learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted\n that as this witness deposing against the interest of the\n plaintiffs, he may be permitted to cross-examine this witness\n by treating him as hostile and prayed time to file appropriate\n application. Hence, further examination of the witness is\n deferred at request.\"\n\n 87 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 142. These two sentences are enough to dismiss the suit as\n\nsuit schedule property is totally a government land not the land of\n\nfamily of plaintiffs as the witness who is concerned authority of\n\ngovernment to identify the property, has clearly admitted that the\n\nsuit schedule property is government land.\n\n 143. In page No 9 of cross examination of PW 2, he has stated\n\nas:-\n\n \" As I have not received any communication from the\n Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, I cannot say though the\n Xerox copy of the orders passed by the Hon'ble High Court of\n Karnataka in WP No.3912/2003 is shown to me and that I\n cannot say whether the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has\n stated the operation of the orders passed by the Tahsildar\n dated 26.05.2003 with regard to the suit schedule property in\n RRT 43/98-99. Now, I see 21 certified copies of the RTCs of\n Survey Nos.7, 8 and 10 of Yellukunte Village. I admit those\n RTCs. Hence, they are marked as Ex.P.38 to P.58 (the witness\n volunteers) as the above matter has been referred to COD\n investigation the entire records pertaining to the suit schedule\n property are with the COD Department since 7.11.1994. I\n cannot say that Ex.P.38 to P.58 and other RTCs marked in this\n suit are issued by our office according to procedure. It is true\n that other than the orders passed on 31.12.1994 cancelling\n the entries which the name of A.P. Rama Reddy and\n Pasalareddy with regard to the suit schedule property, no\n proceedings or orders has been passed by us with regard to\n\n 88 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n the said subject. I cannot say about the in action of the\n Government with regard to the suit schedule property since\n 1968 upto 1994. It is true that I our office and ADLR office, we\n have the documents relating to the ownership of the plaintiffs\n over the suit schedule property. I am not aware of the fact that\n in RRT 43/98-99 records showing that A.P.Ramaiah and\n Pasalareddy have contributed private tank in the suit schedule\n property were called from the ADLRs office.\"\n\n 144. There is clear admission in page Nos.15 and 16 of cross\n\nexamination of PW 2 as suit schedule property is government\n\nproperty which belongs to 3rd defendant, such as:-\n\n \" It may be true to say that as many of the records\n pertaining to the suit schedule property are with the\n Karnataka Lokayuktha, we do not have any records to show\n that during the year 1978 itself, it is learnt that the suit\n schedule property is a Government Tank as such the entries of\n column No.12/2 and column No.9 were discontinued. It is true\n to say that I say that it is learnt during the year 1978 itself,\n that the suit schedule property is a government tank basing\n on the office correspondence and office notes available in our\n office. It is true to say that basing upon our office\n correspondence, I say that since form the year 1978-79, the\n entries in the RTCs of the suit schedule property in column\n No.12/2 and 9 were discontinued and the said entries once\n again continued due to the passing of the orders as per\n Ex.D.21. Departmental proceedings were initiated against the\n said Tahsildar and he was punished with reducing of official\n\n 89 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n rank. It is true to say that as the Government knew that suit\n schedule property belongs to the Government it has been\n transferred in favour of the 3rd defendant BDA. It is true to say\n that after verifying the documents pertaining to the suit\n schedule property and knowing about the fact that the\n Government is the absolute owner of the suit schedule\n property and that no 3rd person has any right over the suit\n schedule property, the same has been transferred in favour of\n the 3rd defendant BDA.\"\n\n 145. Further he has stated in page No.17 as:-\n\n \" It is true to say that unless it is specifically shown as\n private tank, all tanks are deemed to be Government tanks.\"\n\n 146. Now, on perusal of Ex.D 22 to Ex.D 26, in the Tippani\n\nSketch it is shown as \"kere\". Ex.D 28, Ex.D 30, Ex.D 32, Ex.D 35 the\n\nofficial memorandum of BDA dated 19-08-1987 shows about\n\napproval of award and compensation towards Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10/1,\n\n10/2 of Yellukunte village. In cross examination of PW 1 in page No\n\n41 stated that \" suit property is part and parcel of Sy.No 31 of\n\nYellikunte village measuring 15 acre 11 guntas. Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13\n\ncomprised in Sy.No 31. I an unable to say to what extent plaintiffs are\n\nthe owners of the land in Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13.\" And in the cross\n\nexamination dated 29-08-2012 by the learned counsel for\n\ndefendant No 1 and 2, PW 1 has stated as, \" It is true to suggest that,\n\n 90 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nearlier suit land was given as Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13. Now the Survey\n\nnumber is assigned as Sy.No 31.\" And as discussed supra PW 1\n\nadmitted the formation of HSR layout in suit schedule property and\n\nabout receiving of compensation.\n\n 147. Then, as above, one thing is clear that plaintiffs have no\n\nright, title and interest to get reliefs as prayed in this case. Further,\n\nthere is no counter prayer from the defendants other than prayer\n\nfor dismissal of the suit with exemplary costs. But Issues are\n\nframed on the basis of pleadings regarding construction of house\n\nby defendant No 14, formation of layout by BDA and allotment of\n\nsite to defendant No 24. In this regard in the evidence of PW 1 and\n\nPW 2, as discussed supra, it is established that earlier suit schedule\n\nproperty is government land and it is acquired by BDA by due\n\nprocess of law by preliminary and final notifications and BDA\n\nformed HSR layout in the suit schedule property and formed\n\ndrainage and provided civic amenities and some persons have\n\nbuilt house in the sites of that layout.\n\n 148. In the evidence of DW1, the plaintiffs failed to elicit\n\nanything in their favour with corroboration. In the cross\n\nexamination of DW 1, no where it is elicited that the government\n\ntank is in Sy.No 9 and nowhere established tank as private tank.\n\n 91 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nFurther, in page No 11 though stated as property taken by Pasala\n\nReddy for formation of tank, but stated as not owner of four\n\nguntas of land as, \"not belongs to Pasala Reddy.\" On the other\n\nhand, the defendant No 14 as DW 2 produced the certified copy of\n\ngift deed dated 11-08-2004 to establish his title and photographs,\n\nnegatives of photos, water bill, electricity demand bill and\n\nelectricity receipts to establish his possession. In Ex.D 48, there is\n\nrecital about sale deed by GPA in favour of Donor and Ex.D 49 to 56\n\nshows the photos of building. Ex.D 58 to Ex.D 60 shows that the\n\nsaid bills are in respect to water supply and electricity supply to site\n\nNo 1172, 3rd sector, HSR layout, Bangalore. In this regard in page\n\nNo 6 of his cross examination DW 2 stated as:-\n\n \"ಸೈಟ್‍ ನಂ.1172 ನ್ನು ಬಿಡಿಎ ನಮ್ಮ ತಾಯಿಯ ಪರವಾಗಿ ಮಂಜೂರು ಮಾಡಿದೆ\n\n ಎಂದು ನನ್ನ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದೇನೆ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ವಾದ ಪತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾದಿಗಳು\n\n ಹೇಳಿರುವಂತೆ ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಅವರ ಮಾಲೀಕತ್ವವನ್ನು ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಪ್ರತಿವಾದಿ ಪತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ\n\n ಅಲ್ಲಗಳೆದಿರುತ್ತೇನೆ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಮಾಲೀಕರು ಯಾರಾಗಿರಬಹುದು ಎಂದು\n\n ನನಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಗೆ ಮಾಲೀಕರು ಯಾರು ಎಂದು ನಿಮಗೆ\n\n ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲದಿರುವಾಗ ವಾದಿಗಳು ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಮಾಲೀಕರಲ್ಲ ಎಂದು ಅಲ್ಲಗಳೆದಿದ್ದೀರಿ\n\n ಎಂದರೆ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಟೈಟಲ್‍ ಡೀಡ್‍ ಇಲ್ಲ ಬಿಡಿಎ ನಮ್ಮ ತಾಯಿಗೆ ಸೈಟನ್ನು ಮಂಜೂರು\n\n ಮಾಡಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿದಾರರು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾ ರೆ.\"\n\n 92 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n 149. When the learned counsel for plaintiffs put a question\n\nlike \"Site No 1172\" and failed to ask regarding total extent of land\n\nas pleaded in plaint which shows the awareness of the plaintiffs\n\nabout formation of sites by BDA in suit schedule property. Whether\n\nBDA can form layout in the place of tank is answerable by the\n\nauthorities of BDA that is DW 1 and putting question on that\n\nregard as in page No 7 and 8 of cross examination of DW 2 will not\n\nhelp the plaintiffs.\n\n 150. Though in page No 8 of cross examination of DW 2 it is\n\nstated as:-\n\n \"ದಿನಾಂಕ 20-05-2003 ಕ್ಕೆ ವಾದಿಗಳು ಈ ದಾವೆಯನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿ ಬಿಡಿಎ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಟಿಐ\n\n ಆರ್ಡರ್‍ ಪಡೆದಿದ್ದರು ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ಲೇ ಔಟ್‍ ಮಾಡಲು\n\n ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ಟಿಐ ಆರ್ಡರ್‍ ಇದ್ದ ಕಾರಣ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ನಮಗೆ\n\n ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಸೇಲ್‍ ಡೀಡ್, ಅಲಾಟ್ಮೆಂಟ್‍ ಲೆಟರ್‍ ಇತರೆ ದಾಖಲೆಗಳು\n\n ಸೃಷ್ಟಿಸಿದವುಗಳು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ನಮಗೆ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ಕೊಟ್ಟ ದಾಖಲೆಗಳು\n\n ನ್ಯಾ ಯಾಲಯದ ಆದೇಶದ ವಿರುದ್ದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ದಾಖಲಾತಿಗಳು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ.\"\n\n 151. On perusal of order sheet, this suit is filed on 02-06-2003\n\nand order sheet shows only emergent notice sent on IA No. III as\n\norder of staus quo is there in OS No 4830/1996. But, as in this case\n\nas above, the plaintiffs failed to prove their case and hence status\n\n 93 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nquo shall survive. Next to that in page No 9 of cross examination of\n\nDW 2 stated as:-\n\n \"ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆ ಕಟ್ಟಿದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಫೋಟೋಗಳನ್ನು ಹಾಜರುಪಡಿಸಿದ್ದೇನೆ.\"\n\n 152. Then, defendant No.14 established better title than the\n\nplaintiff and his possession over site No.1172 formed out of HSR\n\nlayout which is formed in the suit schedule property.\n\n 153. Next to him, the SPA holder of defendant No.10 who is\n\nexamined as DW 3 produced the SPA executed by defendant No.\n\n10 who is none other than his wife. Ex.D 62 is the certified copy of\n\nsale deed executed by BDA on 12-11-2003 in respect of Site No.\n\n1168 in Sector III of HSR layout. He has produced photographs\n\nwith CD, tax paid receipts and electricity and water bill which are\n\nmarked as Ex.D 62 to Ex.D 70 and in his cross examination he has\n\nstated that:-\n\n \" ಆ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಎಳ್ಳು ಕುಂಟೆ ಗ್ರಾ ಮದ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ಕೆರೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರ್ಕಾರಿ ಕೆರೆ ಎಂದು\n\n ಸಾಕ್ಷಿದಾರರು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾ ರೆ. ಕೆರೆ ಪ್ರದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಲೇ ಔಟ್‍ಮಾಡಬಾರದು ಎಂಬುದು ಕಾನೂನು\n\n ಎಂದರೆ ಇರಬಹುದು. ಸದರಿ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ರ ಕೆರೆಯನ್ನು ಬಿಡಿಎದವರು ಭೂ ಸ್ವಾ ಧೀನ\n\n ಮಾಡಿದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನಾನು ದಾಖಲೆಗಳನ್ನು ಹಾಜರುಪಡಿಸಿಲ್ಲ. ಸದರಿ ಆಸ್ತಿಯನ್ನು 1993 ರಲ್ಲಿ\n\n ನಾವು ಬಿಡಿಎದವರ ಸ್ವಾ ಧೀನಕ್ಕೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದೇವೆ ಎಂದು ಸರ್ಕಾರದವರು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ ಎಂದರೆ\n\n ನಿಜ. ಸದರಿ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ರ ಜಮಿಾನಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಬಿಡಿಎದವರಿಗೆ ಹಕ್ಕು ಮತ್ತು ಅಧಿಕಾರ\n\n 94 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n ಇಲ್ಲ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ತಮಗೆ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ ಸಹಾ ಬಿಡಿಎ ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಯ\n\n ಹೆಸರಿಗೆ ಸೈಟನ್ನು ಮಂಜೂರು ಮಾಡಿ ಕ್ರಯಪತ್ರ ಬರೆದುಕೊಟ್ಟಿದೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ.\"\n\n 154. There is no question about her possession and no\n\ncontra elicited about her title and possession and plaintiff ought to\n\nelicit about right and title of BDA with DW 1 only not with this\n\ndefendant.\n\n 155.Further the defendant No.12 is examined as DW 4 and\n\nEx.D 71 to 90 are got marked through him which are the certified\n\ncopy of sale deed dated 04-03-2004 which shows his vendor\n\npurchased property site No.1161 in HSR layout from BDA and other\n\ndocuments are tax paid receipt paid by him, ECs, photographs,\n\nwater bill, electricity bill and receipts pertaining to said site and\n\nsame cross examination it is elicited as same as cross examination\n\nof DW 3 where in plaintiffs failed to extract contra to title and\n\npossession of this defendant over the concerned site which is\n\nformed out of HSR layout.\n\n 156. Remaining documents are the documents marked\n\nthrough DW 1 which are revenue records listed at the end of this\n\njudgment which shows Sy.No 31 as Sarkari karabhu land and as\n\n\"Kerege ada jameenu\". Ex.D 43 is the notification of acquisition of\n\n 95 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\nlands for BDA which includes suit schedule property also shows\n\npodding of Sy.No 31 as 31/1 to 31/7. Further Ex.D 1 to Ex.D 19 are\n\nmarked through confrontation PW 1 to establish the suit filed by\n\nthe plaintiffs is not maintainable.\n\n 157. Now, the learned counsel for defendant No.3 relied\n\nupon following citations;\n\n \n1. AIR 2008 SC 2033 (\nAnathula Sudhakar vs Buchi Reddy\n)\n\n which is discussed supra;\n\n \n2.

Here in this case before\n\n this court plaintiff claiming this case through the root of\n\n ancestral rights without establishing their ancestors right over\n\n the suit schedule property and also failed to prove family\n\n relationship as per Ex.P 2.\n\n \n 2021 (3) KCCR 2639 ( \nSundrabai and Others vs R Ananthram\n\n Singh (Lrs\n), it is held as, \" \nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\n - \nSections 34\n and\n\n \n38\n - Suit for reliefs of declaration and perpetual injunction - Neither\n\n documents produced by plaintiff no report of Commissioner\n\n showing possession of or title to suit property - No other evidence\n\n showing claim of plaintiff - Plaintiff orally stating suit property lay\n\n adjacent to her house property and therefore she was in possession\n\n and enjoyment of suit property - Cannot be accepted - More so in\n\n face of fact that defendants had obtained perpetual injunction\n\n against sons of plaintiff - Dismissal of suit not interfered with.\"\n\n This suit is definitely replica of that suit as herein, the relief of\n\ndeclaration and perpetual injunction is prayed.

The defendants\n\n cannot be dispossessed unless the plaintiff has\n\n established a better title and rights over property. A\n\n person in possession of land in the assumed character\n\n as the owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary\n\n rights of ownership, has a legal right against the entire\n\n world except the rightful owner. A decree of possession\n\n cannot be passed in favour of the plaintiff on the\n\n ground that defendants have not been able to fully\n\n establish their fight, title and interest in the property.\n\n 103 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n The defendants, being in possession would be entitled\n\n to protect and save their possession, unless the person\n\n who seeks to dispossess them has a better legal right in\n\n the form of ownership or entitlement to possession.\n\n The burden of proof to establish a title lies upon the\n\n plaintiff as this burden lies on the party who asserts the\n\n existence of a particular state of things on the basis of\n\n which she claims relief. The onus of proof, no doubt\n\n shifts and the shifting is a continuous process in the\n\n evaluation of evidence, but this happens when a suit\n\n for title and possession, the plaintiff has been able to\n\n create a high degree of probability to shift the onus on\n\n the defendant. In the absence of such evidence, the\n\n burden of proof lies on the plaintiff and can be\n\n discharged only when he is able to prove title. The\n\n weakness of the defence cannot be a justification to\n\n decree the suit. (Paras 30-31)\"\n\n Here in this present case, there is no counter claim from the\n\ndefendants to declare their title and possession. But, they pleaded\n\nthe same and accordingly Addl.Issues are framed and answered as\n\nabove. A discussed supra plaintiffs themselves failed to establish\n\n 104 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\ntheir case by every corner of the case. Therefore this citation is\n\napplied here.\n\n 159. Therefore, as per the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase and above discussions, this court is of the considered opinion\n\nto dispose this case as under;\n\n  The plaintiffs have failed to prove that they are the absolute\n\n owners in lawful possession, peaceful possession and\n\n exclusive enjoyment of the suit schedule property with a\n\n given boundaries and measurements as on the date of filing\n\n of the suit as discussed supra in gist as not only suit is not\n\n maintainable but also failed to prove genealogy, admitted\n\n possession of defendants, failed to identify the suit schedule\n\n property, hence, Issue No 1 answered in the Negative;\n\n  Further, plaintiffs failed to prove that the alleged order\n\n passed by the 1st defendant bearing No.RD 197 LGB 2003\n\n dated 17-04-2003 is non-est in the eye of law as in the gist,\n\n plaintiffs have not produced any single document on it and\n\n defendant No.3 established the said order as genuine by\n\n confronting the connected documents and LAC proceedings\n\n with calling of Ex.D.20 and further defendants elicited\n\n contradiction to plaintiffs' case by the mouth of PW 1 himself\n\n 105 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n as discussed supra, hence, Issue No 2 answered in the\n\n Negative;\n\n On the other hand, defendant No 3, not only confronted and\n\n marked documents to establish that suit schedule property\n\n as government land but also succeeded in the cross\n\n examination of PW 1 by eliciting admission as suit schedule\n\n property is government land and the tank bed area belongs\n\n to government and also produced the documents in respect\n\n of suit schedule property and plaintiffs failed to elicit contra\n\n to contentions of defendants in the cross examination of DW\n\n 1 to DW 4 and PW 1 himself admitted the formation of HSR\n\n layout in the suit schedule property and distribution of\n\n compensation amount. Accordingly, defendant No.3 proved\n\n that the suit schedule property is a Government property\n\n and the same has been acquired for the formation of layout\n\n called \" Between Hosur Road and Sarjapura Road\" (which\n\n stands for (HSR) by virtue of its Notification\n\n No.HUD/444/MNX/86 dated 28-11-1986 and acquisition\n\n proceedings having reached its finality, the suit schedule\n\n property was transferred to 3rd defendant by its order\n\n bearing No.RD 197-NGB-2003 dated 17-4-2003 and\n\n 106 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n possession has been taken on 26-5-2003 and hence this\n\n court answers Issue No 3 in the Affirmative;\n\n The plaintiff has failed to prove his possession and\n\n construction and existence of tank formed by Palasappa\n\n Reddy and there are no documents produced about\n\n threatening by officials of defendant No.3 and where there is\n\n no possession, then such threatening for dispossession does\n\n not arise. Therefore, the plaintiffs failed to prove that the\n\n officials of the 3rd defendant authority threatened to\n\n dispossess them and also to dismantle the existing\n\n structures in the suit schedule property and accordingly,\n\n Issue No 4 answered in the Negative;\n\n The defendant No.14 established in the cross examination of\n\n PW 1 and by his own evidence as discussed supra as he has\n\n constructed the house in Site No.1172, HSR Sector III,\n\n Bangalore and accordingly Addl.Isue No 1 dated 24-02-2011\n\n answered in Affirmative;\n\n The Defendant No.14 further proved by eliciting admission\n\n by PW 1 as the B.D.A., has formed Layout in the suit schedule\n\n property and formed roads, drainage system and civic\n\n amenities is existing in the suit schedule premises, as\n\n contended in para 5 of the Written Statement, hence\n\n 107 O.S.No.3666/2003\n\n Addl.Issue No 2 dated 24-02-2011 is answered in the\n\n Affirmative.\n\n  Further, it is proved as above that after acquisition of land\n\n bearing Sy.No.31 of Yelukunte village, BDA formed layout\n\n and allotted sites and accordingly Additional Issue No 1\n\n dated 30-08-2018 is answered in the Affirmative.\n\n 160. Issue No.5 : As per the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case and above discussion, the plaintiffs failed to prove\n\ntheir case and plaintiffs are not entitled to get relief. Hence,\n\nthis Court answers Issue No 5 in the Negative.\n\n 161.
