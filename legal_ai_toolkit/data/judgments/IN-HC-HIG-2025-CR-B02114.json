LAKSHMANA RAO\n\nCRIMINAL REVISION CASE NO: 44 of 2011\n\nORDER:\n\nThe Criminal Revision Case has been preferred under\nSections 397\nand\nof Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for brevity 'the\nCr.P.C\n') challenging\n\nthe judgment dated 21.12.2010 in Crl.A.No.29 of 2009 passed by the learned\n\nVI Additional District and Sessions Judge (F.T.C) Krishna, Machilipatnam,\n\nconfirming the judgment dated 09.03.2009 in S.C.No.300 of 2008 passed by\n\nthe learned Assistant Sessions Judge, Nandigama finding the revisionists\n\nguilty of the offence punishable under\nSection 306\nof the Indian Penal Code,\n\n1860 (for short 'the\nI.P.C\n') and convicted the revisionists under\nSection 235 (2)\n\nof 'the\nCr.P.C\n.,' and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\n\nperiod of four years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- (Rupees Five Hundred Only)\n\neach and, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three\n\nmonths each.\n\n2. I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nand the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. Sri P. Prabhakara Rao, the learned counsel for the petitioners, while\n\nreiterating the grounds of the revision, submitted that the judgments of the\n\nlearned Courts below are contrary to law, weight of evidence and probabilities\n\nof the case; the learned Courts below erred in convicting the petitioners merely\n\nbased on Ex.P8 dying declaration without any support from independent\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nsources; the learned Courts below ought to have seen that there is no\n\ninvestigation or either direct or indirect participation of the petitioners for the\n\nalleged abetting of the offence of suicide within the contemplation of\nSection\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n'; the Courts below ought to have seen that non-examination\n\nof the doctor who attended the deceased was fatal to the prosecution case\n\ninasmuch as there was no evidence to show about the mental condition of the\n\ndeceased enabling her to make a statement as to the offence; the learned\n\nCourts below ought to have seen that as the post-mortem discloses that the\n\ndeceased sustained 100% burn injuries that it is impossible or highly\n\nimprobable to make a statement under Ex.A8; the learned Courts below ought\n\nto have seen that P.Ws.1 to 4, who are direct eye witnesses, did not support\n\nthe case of the prosecution and this itself creates any amount of doubt on the\n\ncase of the prosecution; the learned Courts below ought to have seen that\n\nthere are material contradictions between the evidence of P.W.6 and P.W.9 as\n\nto the recording of the statement of the deceased by the P.W.9; and that\n\neventually, requested to allow the criminal revision case by setting aside the\n\nimpugned judgments passed by the learned Appellate and Trial Courts.\n\n4. Per contra, Ms. P. Akila Naidu, learned Assistant Public Prosecutor\n\nvehemently argued that the learned Appellate Court having gone through the\n\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses and the judgment of the learned Trial\n\nCourt rightly passed the judgment confirming the conviction for the offence\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\ncharged and urged to dismiss the revision case as there are no material\n\nirregularities, miscarriage of justice and misreading of the evidence.\n\n5. Thoughtful consideration is bestowed on the arguments advanced by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Assistant Public\n\nProsecutor. I have perused the record.\n\n6. Now the point for consideration is:\n\n\"Whether the judgment in Crl.A.No.29 of 2009 dated 21.12.2010\npassed by the learned VI Additional District and Sessions Judge\n(F.T.C) Krishna, Machilipatnam, is correct, legal, and proper with\nrespect to its finding, sentence, or judgment, and there are any\nmaterial irregularities? And to what relief?\"\n\n7. It is apposite to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nBindeshwari Prasad Singh v State of Bihar1\nwherein at Paragraph Nos.12\n\n& 13 it is held as under:\n\n\"13.... In the absence of any legal infirmity either in the procedure or in\nthe conduct of the trial, there was no justification for the High Court to\ninterfere in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. It has repeatedly\nbeen held that the High Court should not re-appreciate the evidence to\nreach a finding different from the trial Court. In the absence of manifest\nillegality resulting in grave miscarriage of justice, exercise of revisional\njurisdiction in such cases is not warranted.\"\n\n8. This Court, while exercising its jurisdiction under\nSection 397\nread with\n\nSection 401\nof 'the\nCr.P.C\n.,' cannot invoke it's revisional power as a Second\n\nAppellate Court and re-appreciation of evidence is not possible in the revision\n\ncase as\nlaid down in\nthe decision in Bindeshwari Prasad Singh. However,\n\nthis Court is not denuded of its powers to examine whether judgments\n(2002) 6 SCC 650\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nimpugned are correct, legal and proper with respect to their findings, sentence\n\nor even judgment and there are any material irregularities. If there are\n\nmanifest illegalities and interest of public justice requires interference for the\n\ncorrection of those manifest illegalities or to prevent a great miscarriage of\n\njustice, this Court is empowered to evaluate the evidence and analyze it and\n\ncome to a just conclusion\n\n9. It is the case of the prosecution emanating from the charge sheet that\n\nthe deceased-Chilukuri Mariyamma is the wife of Petitioner No.1. Petitioner\n\nNo.2 is the younger brother of Petitioner No.1. Marriage of Petitioner No.1 was\n\nperformed with deceased about two decades ago. They were blessed with two\n\ndaughters and one son. From the very beginning of the marriage, Petitioner\n\nNo.1 had been harassing the deceased both physically and mentally\n\nsuspecting her fidelity. Frequent quarrels ensued between them. On the night\n\nof 14.02.2008, the Petitioners beat deceased due to suspicion of her fidelity.\n\nAs a result, she felt insulted, as she was beaten by Petitioner No.2 with a\n\nchappal, she poured kerosene on her body and set herself ablaze. The whole\n\nbody was burnt. On 15.02.2008 at about 09.00 a.m., Petitioner No.1 shifted\n\nthe body of the deceased to Government Hospital, Nandigama and from\n\nwhere to Government General Hospital, Vijayawada, wherein she succumbed\n\nto injuries on the same day at about 02.30 p.m.\n\n10. Based on Ex.P11 Hospital intimation on 15.02.2008 at about 10.30\n\na.m., P.W.9 Sub-Inspector of Police, Nandigama Police Station had come\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nposthaste to the Government Hospital, Nandigama, recorded the statement of\n\nthe deceased vide Ex.P12, basing on which a case in Cr.No.47 of 2008 under\n\nthe caption 'Woman Burns' was registered and took up investigation. P.W.9\n\nvisited the scene of offence, examined it in the presence of P.W.5 and L.W.15\n\nPallepogu China Anandam and seized M.O.1 - ten liters tin of kerosene under\n\nEx.P5 observation report. P.W.9 also drew Ex.P14 - sketch of scene of\n\noffence. On receipt of death intimation of Chilukuri Mariyamma from\n\nGovernment General Hospital, Vijayawada, P.W.8 altered the section of law\n\nfrom the caption 'Woman Burns' to\nSection 306\nread with 34 of 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' on\n\n16.02.2008 at about 09.30 a.m. An inquest was conducted over the cadaver of\n\ndeceased in the presence of P.W.5 and L.W.15 under Ex.P6 - Inquest Report\n\nand forwarded the body of Chilukuri Mariyamma to autopsy.\n\n11. P.W.6 - the Judicial Magistrate of I Class, Nandigama, on requisition\n\nunder Ex.P7 hospital intimation, had visited Government Hospital, Nandigama\n\nand recorded Ex.P8 dying declaration of Chilukuri Mariyamma. P.W.7\n\nconducted autopsy over the cadaver of deceased and issued Ex.P9 -\n\nPostmortem certificate, certifying that the cause of death of Chilukuri\n\nMariyamma was due to burns and its complications. P.W.9 arrested Petitioner\n\nNo.1 on 19.02.2008 and Petitioner No.2 on 22.08.2008 and forwarded them to\n\nthe learned jurisdictional magistrate for judicial remand. On completion of\n\ninvestigation, a charge sheet was filed.\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\n12. The learned Judicial Magistrate of I Class, Nandigama took cognizance\n\nof the offence under\nSection 306\nread with 34 of 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' against the\n\nPetitioners and registered the case as P.R.C.No.25 of 2008. In this case it is\n\nexpedient to examine whether there was any instigation either direct or\n\nindirect on the part of the Petitioners driving Chilukuri Mariyamma for taking\n\nextreme step of committing suicide by pouring kerosene on her body and set\n\nherself ablaze. The doctor, who attended the deceased, was not examined by\n\nthe prosecution to speak about the mental condition of the deceased while\n\ngiving her dying declaration. The deceased received 100% burn injuries as\n\nseen from the evidence of P.W.7, the doctor who conducted autopsy. P.Ws.1\n\nto 4 deposed ignorance about the case of the prosecution. The Trial Court\n\nbased on the evidence of panch witnesses, the Judicial Magistrate of I Class,\n\nNandigama, inquest report and the dying declaration of the deceased,\n\nconvicted and sentenced the Petitioners.\n\n13. P.W.6 the Judicial I Class Magistrate, Nandigama who recorded the\n\ndying declaration of the deceased deposed that he had commenced recording\n\nof dying declaration at 10.45 a.m., and concluded at 10.55 a.m. He admitted\n\nthat there were no other persons present at the time of recording of dying\n\ndeclaration expect the duty doctor and his attender. Whereas the evidence of\n\nP.W.9 - the Sub-Inspector of Police is that he recorded the statement of the\n\ndeceased at about 10.50 a.m., and 11.00 a.m., on the same day of recording\n\nof dying declaration by the learned Magistrate. The learned Magistrate\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nrecorded dying declaration of Chilukuri Mariyamma in her own words\n\n(translated into English) as under:\n\n\"My husband and his brother (my brother-in-law) Pitchayya\nbeat me yesternight. They stated that why should I lead this life\nand why should not I die. Hence I poured kerosene and set\nmyself fire. My mother-in-law brought me to the hospital.\"\n\n14. In this context, it is apposite to refer the landmark decisions of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court about the principles and ratios to decide whether there\n\nare adequate ingredients to determine about commission of abetment of\n\nsuicide by the petitioners.\n\n15.\nIn\nS.S. Chheena v. Vijay Kumar Mahajan2\n, at Paragraph No.25 it is\n\nheld as under:\n\n25. \"Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or\nintentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive\nact on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing\nsuicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The intention of the\nlegislature and the ratio of the cases decided by this Court is clear\nthat in order to convict a person under\nSection 306\nIPC there has\nto be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an\nactive act or direct act which led the deceased to commit suicide\nseeing no option and that act must have been intended to push\nthe deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.\"\n\n16.\nIn\nAmalendu Pal v. State of West Bengal3\n, at Paragraph No.12 it is\n\nheld as under:\n\n12. \"Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before\nholding an accused guilty of an offence under\nSection 306\nIPC,\nthe court must scrupulously examine the facts and circumstances\nof the case and also assess the evidence adduced before it in\norder to find out whether the cruelty and harassment meted out to\nthe victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to put an\nend to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of\n(2010) 12 SCC 190\n(2010) 1 SCC 707\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nalleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or\nindirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on\nthe allegation of harassment without there being any positive\naction proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the\naccused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide,\nconviction in terms of\nSection 306\nIPC is not sustainable.\"\n\n17.\nIn\nM. Mohan v. State4\n, at Paragraph Nos.44 and 45 it is held as under:\n\n\"44. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a\nperson or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without\na positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in\ncommitting suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.\n\n45. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases\ndecided by this Court are clear that in order to convict a person\nunder\nSection 306\nIPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit\nthe offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led\nthe deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must\nhave been intended to push the deceased into such a position that\nhe/she committed suicide.\"\n\n18.\nIn\nUde Singh v. State of Haryana5\n, at Paragraph Nos.15 and 16 it is\n\nheld as under:\n\n\"15. Thus, \"abetment\" involves a mental process of instigating\na person in doing something. A person abets the doing of a thing\nwhen:\n\n(i) he instigates any person to do that thing; or\n\n(ii) he engages with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the\ndoing of that thing; or\n\n(iii) he intentionally aids, by acts or illegal omission, the doing of that\nthing.\n\nThese are essential to complete the abetment as a crime. The word\n\"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about\nby persuasion to do anything.\n\n16. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be a\nproof of direct or indirect act(s) of incitement to the commission of\nsuicide. It could hardly be disputed that the question of cause of a\nsuicide, particularly in the context of an offence of abetment of\nsuicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted and complex\n(2011) 3 SCC 626\n(2019) 17 SCC 301\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nattributes of human behaviour and responses/reactions. In the case\nof accusation for abetment of suicide, the court would be looking for\ncogent and convincing proof of the act(s) of incitement to the\ncommission of suicide. In the case of suicide, mere allegation of\nharassment of the deceased by another person would not suffice\nunless there be such action on the part of the accused which\ncompels the person to commit suicide; and such an offending action\nought to be proximate to the time of occurrence. Whether a person\nhas abetted in the commission of suicide by another or not, could\nonly be gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\n16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted\ncommission of suicide by another, the consideration would be if the\naccused is guilty of the act of instigation of the act of suicide. As\nexplained and reiterated by this Court in the decisions above\nreferred, instigation means to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or\nencourage to do an act. If the persons who committed suicide had\nbeen hypersensitive and the action of the accused is otherwise not\nordinarily expected to induce a similarly circumstanced person to\ncommit suicide, it may not be safe to hold the accused guilty of\nabetment of suicide. But, on the other hand, if the accused by his\nacts and by his continuous course of conduct creates a situation\nwhich leads the deceased perceiving no other option except to\ncommit suicide, the case may fall within the four corners of\nSection\nIPC. If the accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-\nesteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually draws the\nvictim to commit suicide, the accused may be held guilty of\nabetment of suicide. The question of mens rea on the part of the\naccused in such cases would be examined with reference to the\nactual acts and deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds are\nonly of such nature where the accused intended nothing more than\nharassment or snap show of anger, a particular case may fall short\nof the offence of abetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept\non irritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds until the\ndeceased reacted or was provoked, a particular case may be that of\nabetment of suicide. Such being the matter of delicate analysis of\nhuman behaviour, each case is required to be examined on its own\nfacts, while taking note of all the surrounding factors having bearing\non the actions and psyche of the accused and the deceased.\n\n16.2. We may also observe that human mind could be\naffected and could react in myriad ways; and impact of one's action\non the mind of another carries several imponderables. Similar\nactions are dealt with differently by different persons; and so far a\nparticular person's reaction to any other human's action is\nconcerned, there is no specific theorem or yardstick to estimate or\nassess the same. Even in regard to the factors related with the\nquestion of harassment of a girl, many factors are to be considered\nlike age, personality, upbringing, rural or urban set-ups, education,\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\netc. Even the response to the ill action of eve teasing and its impact\non a young girl could also vary for a variety of factors, including\nthose of background, self-confidence and upbringing. Hence, each\ncase is required to be dealt with on its own facts and\ncircumstances.\"\n\n19. In Swamy Prahaladdas v. State of Madhya Pradesh6, at Paragraph\n\nNos.2 and 3 it is held as under:\n\n\"2. The impugned order of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh\nis in confirmation of the order of the Court of Session, whereby, the\nappellant herein, has been summoned to face trial for offence under\n\nSection 306\nIPC. The said order has been passed in this\nbackground:\n\nSushila Bai, respondent, a married woman, is alleged to have had\ntwo paramours, one was the deceased and the other is the\nappellant. It is alleged that there was sexual jealousy between the\ntwo. The deceased was a married man. The prosecution alleges\nthat Sushila Bai had completely bewitched him but her heart was\nwith the appellant. On the morning of 13-6-1992, all the three had a\nquarrel while sharing their morning tea. During that course, the\nappellant is said to have remarked for the deceased to go and die.\nThe prosecution alleges that thereafter the deceased went home in\na dejected mood, whereafter he committed suicide. The suicide has\nbeen termed as the direct cause for the treatment meted out to the\ndeceased by the appellant. It is Sushila Devi though, who alone\nstands committed to the Court of Session to face trial because of\nher preferential treatment to the appellant.\n\n3. At the time of framing of charge, the trial court thought it\nappropriate to associate the appellant herein as an accused\nbecause of the words he uttered to the deceased. We think that just\non the basis of that utterance the Court of Session was in error in\nsummoning the appellant to face trial. In the first place it is difficult,\nin the facts and circumstances, to come to even a prima facie view\nthat what was uttered by the appellant was enough to instigate the\ndeceased to commit suicide. Those words are casual in nature\nwhich are often employed in the heat of the moment between\nquarrelling people. Nothing serious is expected to follow thereafter.\n\nThe said act does not reflect the requisite mens rea on the\nassumption that these words would be carried out in all events.\nBesides the deceased had plenty of time to weigh the pros and\ncons of the act by which he ultimately ended his life. It cannot be\nsaid that the suicide by the deceased was the direct result of the\nwords uttered by the appellant. For these reasons, the error is\n1995 Supp (3) SCC 438\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\napparent requiring rectification. The appeal is accordingly allowed.\nThe orders of the High Court and that of the Court of Session are\nthus upset. The appellant need not face the charge.\"\n\n20.\nIn\nGurcharan Singh v. State of Punjab7\n, at Paragraph No.15 it is held\n\nas under:\n\n\"15. As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To\nprove the offence of abetment, as specified under\nSection 107\nIPC,\nthe state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to\ndetermine the culpability. In order to prove mens rea, there has to\nbe something on record to establish or show that the appellant\nherein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind,\nabetted the suicide of the deceased. The ingredient of mens rea\ncannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible\nand conspicuous. However, what transpires in the present matter is\nthat both the trial court as well as the High Court never examined\nwhether the appellant had the mens rea for the crime he is held to\nhave committed. The conviction of the appellant by the trial court as\nwell as the High Court on the theory that the woman with two young\nkids might have committed suicide possibly because of the\nharassment faced by her in the matrimonial house is not at all borne\nout by the evidence in the case. Testimonies of the PWs do not\nshow that the wife was unhappy because of the appellant and she\nwas forced to take such a step on his account.\"\n\n21. In Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (NCT of Delhi) 8, at Paragraph\n\nNo.13 it is held as under:\n\n\"13. As per the section, a person can be said to have\nabetted in doing a thing, if he, firstly, instigates any person to\ndo that thing; or secondly, engages with one or more other\nperson or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing,\nif an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that\nconspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or thirdly,\nintentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of\nthat thing. Explanation to\nSection 107\nstates that any wilful\nmisrepresentation or willful concealment of material fact which\nhe is bound to disclose, may also come within the contours of\n\"abetment\". It is manifest that under all the three situations,\ndirect involvement of the person or persons concerned in the\n1995 Supp (3) SCC 438\n(2009) 16 SCC 605\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\ncommission of offence of suicide is essential to bring home the\noffence under\nSection 306\nIPC.\"\n\n22.\nIn\nRajesh v. State of Haryana9\n, at Paragraph No.13 it is held as under:\n\n\"9. Conviction under\nSection 306\nIPC is not sustainable on the\nallegation of harassment without there being any positive action\nproximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused,\nwhich led or compelled the person to commit suicide. In order to\nbring a case within the purview of\nSection 306\nIPC, there must be a\ncase of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the\nperson who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must\nhave played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing\ncertain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act\nof abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be\nproved and established by the prosecution before he could be\nconvicted under\nSection 306\nIPC.\"\n\n23. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the judgment\n\nof the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nMahendra Awase v. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh10\nwherein at Paragraph Nos.18, 19 and 20 it is held as under:\n\n\"18...As has been held hereinabove, to satisfy the requirement\nof instigation the accused by his act or omission or by a\ncontinued course of conduct should have created such\ncircumstances that the deceased was left with no other option\nexcept to commit suicide. It was also held that a word uttered\nin a fit of anger and emotion without intending the\nconsequences to actually follow cannot be said to be\ninstigation.\n\n19. Applying the above principle to the facts of the present\ncase, we are convinced that there are no grounds to frame\ncharges under\nSection 306\nIPC against the appellant. This is\nso even if we take the prosecution's case on a demurrer and\nat its highest, a reading of the suicide note reveals that the\nappellant was asking the deceased to repay the loan\nguaranteed by the deceased and advanced to Ritesh Malakar.\n\n9 (2020) 15 SCC 359\n10 2025 SCC OnLine SC 107\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nIt could not be said that the appellant by performing his duty of\nrealising outstanding loans at the behest of his employer can\nbe said to have instigated the deceased to commit suicide.\nEqually so, with the transcripts, including the portions\nemphasised hereinabove. Even taken literally, it could not be\nsaid that the appellant intended to instigate the commission of\nsuicide. It could certainly not be said that the appellant by his\nacts created circumstances which left the deceased with no\nother option except to commit suicide. Viewed from the\narmchair of the appellant, the exchanges with the deceased,\nalbeit heated, are not with intent to leave the deceased with no\nother option but to commit suicide. This is the conclusion we\ndraw taking a realistic approach, keeping the context and the\nsituation in mind. Strangely, the FIR has also been lodged\nafter a delay of two months and twenty days.\n\n20. This Court has, over the last several decades, repeatedly\nreiterated the higher threshold, mandated by law for\nSection\nIPC [Now\nSection 108\nread with\nSection 45\nof the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023] to be attracted. They however\nseem to have followed more in the breach.\nSection 306\nIPC\nappears to be casually and too readily resorted to by the\npolice. While the persons involved in genuine cases where the\nthreshold is met should not be spared, the provision should\nnot be deployed against individuals, only to assuage the\nimmediate feelings of the distraught family of the deceased.\nThe conduct of the proposed accused and the deceased, their\ninteractions and conversations preceding the unfortunate\ndeath of the deceased should be approached from a practical\npoint of view and not divorced from day-to-day realities of life.\nHyperboles employed in exchanges should not, without\nanything more, be glorified as an instigation to commit suicide.\nIt is time the investigating agencies are sensitised to the law\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court under\nSection 306\nso that persons are\nnot subjected to the abuse of process of a totally untenable\nprosecution. The trial courts also should exercise great caution\nand circumspection and should not adopt a play it safe\nsyndrome by mechanically framing charges, even if the\ninvestigating agencies in a given case have shown utter\ndisregard for the ingredients of\nSection 306\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n'.\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\n24.\nIn\nMadan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat11\n, it is held that in order to\n\nbring out an offence under\nSection 306\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' specific abetment as\n\ncontemplated by\nSection 107\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' on the part of the accused with an\n\nintention to bring about the suicide of the person concerned as a result of that\n\nabetment is required. It was further held that the intention of the accused to\n\naid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide is a must for\n\nattracting\nSection 306\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n'.\n\n25.\nIn\nRamesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh12\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nwhile examining different shades of the meaning of \"instigation\" at Paragraph\n\nNo.20 reads as under:\n\n\"20... Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or\nencourage to do 'an act'. To satisfy the requirement of instigation\nthough it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that\neffect or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and\nspecifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable\ncertainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt\nout. The present one is not a case where the accused had by his\nacts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created such\ncircumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except\nto commit suicide in which case instigation may have been inferred.\nA word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without intending the\nconsequences to actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.\"\n\n26.\nIn\nAyyub v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n13 the Hon'ble Apex Court at\n\nParagraph Nos.19 and 21 held as under:\n\n\"19...By a long line of judgments, this Court has\nreiterated that in order to make out an offence under\nSection\nIPC, specific abetment as contemplated by\nSection 107\n(2010)\nSCC 628\n(2001) 9 SCC 618\n2025 INSC 168\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nIPC\non the part of the accused with an intention to bring about\nthe suicide of the person concerned as a result of that\nabetment is required. It has been further held that the intention\nof the accused to aid or instigate or to abet the deceased to\ncommit suicide is a must for attracting\nSection 306\nIPC [See\n\nMadan Mohan Singh vs. State of Gujarat and Another\n, (2010)\n8 SCC 628].\n\nFurther, the alleged harassment meted out\nshould have left the victim with no other alternative but to put\nan end to her life and that in cases of abetment of suicide\nthere must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to\ncommit suicide [See Amalendu Pal alias\nJhantu vs. State of\nWest Bengal\n, (2010) 1 SCC 707 and M. Mohan vs. State,\n(2011) 3 SCC 626 and Ramesh Kumar vs. State of\nChhattisgarh, (2001) 9 SCC 618].\n\n21. We find none of the ingredients required in law to make\nout a case under\nSection 306\nIPC to be even remotely\nmentioned in the charge-sheet or are being borne out from the\nmaterial on record. The utterance attributed to the appellants\nassuming it to be true cannot be said to be of such a nature as\nto leave the deceased Tanu with no other alternative but to put\nan end to her life. The surrounding circumstances, particularly\nthe prior lodgment of the FIR by the first appellant against the\nfamily of Tanu for the death of his son Ziaul Rahman, does\nindicate an element of desperation on the part of the\nrespondent no. 2 to somehow implicate the appellants.\nReliance of the statements recorded under\nSection 161\n\nCr.P.C. belatedly on 07.11.2022, 08.11.2022 and 22.11.2022,\nonly reinforces out suspicion viz. one-sided, partial and\ninimical investigation. Under these circumstances, proceeding\nwith the trial against the appellants in the charge-sheet as filed\nwill be a gross abuse of process.\"\n\n27.\nIn\nNipun Aneja v. State of Uttar Pradesh14\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court at\n\nParagraph Nos.19, 21, 22, 23, and 24 held as under:\n\n\"19...This Court in\nUde Singh v. State of Haryana\n, (2019) 17 SCC\n301, held that in order to convict an accused under\nSection 306\nof\nthe IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be\nvisible with regard to determining the culpability. It was observed as\nunder:-\n2024 SCC OnLine SC 4091\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\n\"16. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there must be\na proof of direct or indirect act(s) of incitement to the\ncommission of suicide. It could hardly be disputed that the\nquestion of cause of a suicide, particularly in the context of\nan offence of abetment of suicide, remains a vexed one,\ninvolving multifaceted and complex attributes of human\nbehaviour and responses/reactions. In the case of\naccusation for abetment of suicide, the Court would be\nlooking for cogent and convincing proof of the act(s) of\nincitement to the commission of suicide. In the case of\nsuicide, mere allegation of harassment of the deceased by\nanother person would not suffice unless there be such\naction on the part of the accused which compels the\nperson to commit suicide; and such an offending action\nought to be proximate to the time of occurrence. Whether a\nperson has abetted in the commission of suicide by\nanother or not, could only be gathered from the facts and\ncircumstances of each case.\n\n16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has abetted\ncommission of suicide by another; the consideration would\nbe if the accused is guilty of the act of instigation of the act\nof suicide. As explained and reiterated by this Court in the\ndecisions above referred, instigation means to goad, urge\nforward, provoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the\npersons who committed suicide had been hypersensitive\nand the action of accused is otherwise not ordinarily\nexpected to induce a similarly circumstanced person to\ncommit suicide, it may not be safe to hold the accused\nguilty of abetment of suicide. But, on the other hand, if the\naccused by his acts and by his continuous course of\nconduct creates a situation which leads the deceased\nperceiving no other option except to commit suicide, the\ncase may fall within the four-corners of\nSection 306\nIPC. If\nthe accused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-\n\nesteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually\ndraws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may be\nheld guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of mens\nrea on the part of the accused in such cases would be\nexamined with reference to the actual acts and deeds of\nthe accused and if the acts and deeds are only of such\nnature where the accused intended nothing more than\nharassment or snap show of anger, a particular case may\nfall short of the offence of abetment of suicide. However, if\nthe accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nwords or deeds until the deceased reacted or was\nprovoked, a particular case may be that of abetment of\nsuicide. Such being the matter of delicate analysis of\nhuman behaviour, each case is required to be examined\non its own facts, while taking note of all the surrounding\nfactors having bearing on the actions and psyche of the\naccused and the deceased.\"\n\n21. The ingredients to constitute an offence under\nSection 306\nof\nthe IPC (abetment of suicide) would stand fulfilled if the suicide is\ncommitted by the deceased due to direct and alarming\nencouragement/incitement by the accused leaving no option but to\ncommit suicide. Further, as the extreme action of committing\nsuicide is also on account of great disturbance to the psychological\nimbalance of the deceased such incitement can be divided into two\nbroad categories. First, where the deceased is having sentimental\nties or physical relations with the accused and the second category\nwould be where the deceased is having relations with the accused\nin his or her official capacity. In the case of former category\nsometimes a normal quarrel or the hot exchange of words may\nresult into immediate psychological imbalance, consequently\ncreating a situation of depression, loss of charm in life and if the\nperson is unable to control sentiments of expectations, it may give\ntemptations to the person to commit suicide, e.g., when there is\nrelation of husband and wife, mother and son, brother and sister,\nsister and sister and other relations of such type, where sentimental\ntie is by blood or due to physical relations. In the case of second\ncategory the tie is on account of official relations, where the\nexpectations would be to discharge the obligations as provided for\nsuch duty in law and to receive the considerations as provided in\nlaw. In normal circumstances, relationships by sentimental tie\ncannot be equated with the official relationship. The reason being\ndifferent nature of conduct to maintain that relationship. The former\ncategory leaves more expectations, whereas in the latter category,\nby and large, the expectations and obligations are prescribed by\nlaw, rules, policies and regulations.\n\n22. The test that the Court should adopt in this type of cases is to\nmake an endeavour to ascertain on the basis of the materials on\nrecord whether there is anything to indicate even prima facie that\nthe accused intended the consequences of the act, l.e., suicide.\nOver a period of time, the trend of the courts is that such intention\ncan be read into or gathered only after a full-fledged trial. The\nproblem is that the courts just look into the factum of suicide and\nnothing more. We believe that such understanding on the part of\nthe courts is wrong. It all depends on the nature of the offence &\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\naccusation. For example, whether the accused had the common\nintention under\nSection 34\nof the IPC could be gathered only after a\nfull-fledged trial on the basis of the depositions of the witnesses as\nregards the genesis of the occurrence, the manner of assault, the\nweapon used, the role played by the accused etc. However, in\ncases of abetment of suicide by and large the facts make things\nclear more particularly from the nature of the allegations itself. The\nCourts should know how to apply the correct principles of law\ngoverning abetment of suicide to the facts on record. It is the\ninability on the part of the courts to understand and apply the\ncorrect principles of law to the cases of abetment of suicide, which\nleads to unnecessary prosecutions. We do understand and\nappreciate the feelings and sentiments of the family members of\nthe deceased and we cannot find any fault on their part if they\ndecide to lodge a First Information Report with the police. However,\nit is ultimately for the police and the courts of law to look into the\nmatter and see that the persons against whom allegations have\nbeen levelled are not unnecessarily harassed or they are not put to\ntrial just for the sake of prosecuting them.\n\n23. (a) On the date of the meeting, l.e., 03.11.2006, did the\nappellants create a situation of unbearable harassment or torture,\nleading the deceased to see suicide as the only escape? To\nascertain this, the two statements of the colleagues of the\ndeceased referred to by us were sufficient.\n\n(b) Are the appellants accused of exploiting the emotional\nvulnerability of the deceased by making him feel worthless or\nunderserving of life leading him to commit suicide?\n\n(c) Is it a case of threatening the deceased with dire consequences,\nsuch as harm to his family or severe financial ruin to the extent that\nhe believed suicide was the only way out?\n\n(d) Is it a case of making false allegations that may have damaged\nthe reputation of the deceased & push him to commit suicide due to\npublic humiliation & loss of dignity.\n\n24. The aforesaid are just illustrations that could be considered as\nabetment under the law in the facts & circumstances of a given\ncase.\"\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\n28.\nIn\nArjunan v. State\n15 the Hon'ble Apex Court, while explaining the\n\nnecessary ingredients of\nSection 306\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' in detail, at Paragraph\n\nNo.7 it is held as under:\n\n\"7... The essential ingredients of the offence under\n\nSection 306\nI.P.C. are: (i) the abetment; (ii) the intention of the\naccused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to commit\nsuicide. The act of the accused, however, insulting the\ndeceased by using abusive language will not, by itself,\nconstitute the abetment of suicide. There should be evidence\ncapable of suggesting that the accused intended by such act\nto instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Unless the\ningredients of instigation/abetment to commit suicide are\nsatisfied, accused cannot be convicted under\nSection 306\n\nIPC.\"\n\n29.\nIn\nNetai Dutta v. State of West Bengal16\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court at\n\nParagraph Nos.5, 6, and 7 held as under:\n\n\"Where an employee of a company was transferred from one\nplace to another. However, he failed to join. Thereafter, he\nsent a letter of resignation expressing his grievance against\nstagnancy to salary and unpleasant situation. The company\naccepted the resignation. Thereafter, the said employee\ncommitted suicide. He left behind a suicide note, alleging\ntherein that Netai Dutta and, one Paramesh Chatterjee\nengaged him in several wrong doings. The same was alleged\nas, torture. The brother of the deceased filed complaint,\nagainst Netai Dutta and others under\nSection 306\nof the IPC.\nA learned Single Judge of the High Court of Calcutta declined\nto quash the complaint. In appeal, however, this Court while\nquashing the complaint, at paragraphs 5 and 6 observed as\nunder:\n\n\"5. There is absolutely no averment in the alleged suicide note\nthat the present appellant had caused any harm to him or was\nin any way responsible for delay in paying salary to deceased\nPranab Kumar Nag. It seems that the deceased was very\nmuch dissatisfied with the working conditions at the work\nplace. But, it may also be noticed that the deceased after his\n(2019) 3 SCC 315\n(2005) 2 SCC 659\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\ntransfer in 1999 had never joined the office at 160 B.L. Saha\nRoad, Kolkata and had absented himself for a period of two\nyears and that the suicide took place on 16-2-2001. It cannot\nbe said that the present appellant had in any way instigated\nthe deceased to commit suicide or he was responsible for the\nsuicide of Pranab Kumar Nag. An offence under\nSection 306\n.\n\nIPC\nwould stand only if there is an abetment for the\ncommission of the crime. The parameters of the \"abetment\"\nhave been stated in\nSection 107\nof the Penal Code, 1860.\n\nSection 107\nsays that a person abets the doing of a thing, who\ninstigates any person to do that thing: or engages with one or\nmore other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing\nof that thing, if an act or illegal omission taken place in\npursuance of that conspiracy, or the person should have\nintentionally aided any act or illegal omission. The explanation\nto.\nSection 107\nsays that any willful misrepresentation or willful\nconcealment of a material-fact which he is bound to disclose,\nmay also come within the contours of \"abetment\"\n\n6. In the suicide note, except referring to the name of the\nappellant at two places, there is no reference of any-act or\nincidence where by the appellant herein is alleged to have,\ncommitted any willful act or omission or intentionally aided or\ninstigated the deceased) Pranab Kumar Nag to committing the\nact of suicide. There is no case that the appellant has played\nany part or any role in any conspiracy, which ultimately\ninstigated or resulted in the commission of suicide by\ndeceased Pranab Kumar Nag.\"\n\n7. The prosecution initiated against the appellant would only\nresult in sheer harassment to the appellant without any fruitful\nresult. In our opinion, the learned single Judge seriously erred\nin holding that the first information report against the appellant\ndisclosed the elements of a cognizable offence. There was\nabsolutely no ground to proceed against the appellant herein.\"\n\n30.\nIn\nGeo Varghese v. State of Rajasthan17\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court at\n\nParagraph Nos.15 and 16 held as under:\n\n\"15...The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word 'instigate' is\nto bring about or initiate, incite someone to do something. This\nCourt in\nRamesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh\n, (2001) 9\nSCC 618, has defined the word 'instigate' as under:\"20.\n(2021) 19 SCC 144\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nInstigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or\nencourage to do \"an act\".\"\n\n16. The scope and ambit of\nSection 107\nIPC and its co-\nrelation with\nSection 306\nIPC has been discussed repeatedly\nby this Court.\nIn the case of\nS.S. Cheena v. Vijay Kumar\nMahajan\n(2010) 12 SCC 190, it was observed as under:-\n\n\"25. Abetment involves a mental process of\ninstigating a person or intentionally aiding a person\nin doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part\nof the accused to instigate or aid in committing\nsuicide, conviction cannot be sustained. The\nintention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases\ndecided by the Supreme Court is clear that in order\nto convict a person under\nSection 306\nIPC there has\nto be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also\nrequires an active act or direct act which led the\ndeceased to commit suicide seeing no option and\nthat act must have been intended to push the\ndeceased into such a position that he committed\nsuicide\".\n\n31.\nIn\nMariano Anto Bruno v. The Inspector of Police18\nthe Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt at Paragraph No.44 held as under:\n\n\"44... It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of alleged\nabetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect\nacts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the\nallegation of harassment without their being any positive\naction proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the\naccused which led or compelled the person to commit suicide,\nconviction in terms of\nSection 306\nIPC is not sustainable.\"\n\n32. On a careful analysis and scrutiny of the dying declaration of Chilukuri\n\nMariyamma, it can be easily discerned that there was no instigation done by\n\nany of the Petitioners goading Chilukuri Mariyamma to commit suicide. There\n\nis no evidence that they had intentionally aided her to commit suicide. There is\n2022 SCC OnLine SC 1387\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nno evidence that the Petitioners committed abetment of suicide by criminal\n\nconspiracy. On a scrupulous examination of the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, especially dying declaration of the deceased, there was no positive\n\naction proximate to the time of suicide on the part of the Petitioners which lead\n\nor compelled the deceased to take the extreme step of committing suicide.\n\nTherefore, the conviction under\nSection 306\nof 'the\nI.P.C\n.,' sustained by the\n\nlearned Trial Court and upheld by the learned Appellate Court are not valid\n\nand legally acceptable inasmuch as there was no positive act on the part of\n\nthe Petitioners to instigate or intentionally aided Chilukuri Mariyamma to\n\ncommit suicide.\n\n33. None of the witnesses of the prosecution had spoken that the\n\nPetitioners had entertained a clear mens rea to cause the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide. There was neither an active act of direct or indirect on the part of the\n\nPetitioners which lead the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option.\n\nBeating the deceased by the Petitioners on yester-night cannot be\n\npresumable that they intended to push the deceased into such position that\n\nshe should commit suicide. As the Petitioners suspected the fidelity of the\n\ndeceased, they beat her yester-night of the death of Chilukuri Mariyamma, but\n\nshe had felt insulted and resorted to the extreme step.\n\n34. There was no evidence that the Petitioners instigated Chilukuri\n\nMariyamma to commit suicide. There was no evidence to the effect that the\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\nPetitioners either goaded or provoked or instigated or encouraged her to\n\ncommit suicide. Therefore, it may not be right to hold that the Petitioners were\n\nguilty of abetment of suicide. The deceased felt insulted or humiliated as her\n\nbrother-in-law and husband beat her on the pretext that she had not kept her\n\nmatrimonial piousness. The action of the Petitioners is otherwise not ordinarily\n\nexpected to induce similarly circumstanced person to commit suicide, the\n\ndeceased was hypersensitive, as such, it would not be appropriate and proper\n\nto convict the Petitioners for abetment of suicide.\n\n35. The prosecution could not establish the guilty mind of the Petitioners\n\nand in furtherance of that state of mind they abetted Chilukuri Mariyamma to\n\ncommit suicide. There was no visible and conspicuous presence of element of\n\nmens rea in the case. The act and words of the petitioners, however, insulting\n\nor humiliating the deceased by stating that why should she live, as she was\n\nleading an immoral life, will not by itself constitute abetment of suicide. The\n\nwords of the petitioners spoken to the deceased only once, a single instance\n\ni.e., on the preceding night of committing suicide, cannot constitute the\n\npetitioners exploiting the vulnerability of the deceased, making her feel\n\nworthless or undeserving of life, leading her to commit suicide. The\n\npersecution failed to establish that the petitioners, by their acts and their\n\ncontinuous course of conduct, created a situation which led Chilukuri\n\nMariyamma to perceive no other option except committing suicide.\nDr.YLR, J\n\nCrl.R.C.No.44 of 2011\n\nDated 16.06.2025\n\n36. In the result, the Criminal Revision Petition is allowed, setting aside the\n\nimpugned judgment of the learned Appellate Court dated 21.12.2010 in\n\nCrl.A.No.29 of 2009 on the file of learned VI Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudge (F.T.C) Krishna, Machilipatnam. Consequently, the judgment of the\n\nlearned Trial Court in S.C.No.300 of 2008 dated 09.03.2009 on the file of the\n\nlearned Assistant Sessions Judge, Nandigama, is also set aside. There shall\n\nbe no order as to costs.\n\nAs a sequel, interlocutory applications, if any pending, shall stand\n\nclosed.\n\n_________________________\nDr. Y.
