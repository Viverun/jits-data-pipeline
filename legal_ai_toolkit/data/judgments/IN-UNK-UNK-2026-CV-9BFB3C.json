Thereafter, his services were\nregularized on 17.9.2003 as he had passing Typing Test.\nThereafter, on 28.10.2015, information was sought from\nthe petitioner with regard to regularization of his services\nand he was given 3 daysâ time to submit explanation.\nThe petitioner submitted his reply to letter dated\n28.10.2015. Thereafter, by impugned order dated\n19.11.2015 the order of regularization of services of the\npetitioner was cancelled.\n\n19. In Writ Petition No.1737/2016 were appointed on\ndaily wage basis on the post of Driver prior to 1988. The\nservices of the petitioners No.1 to 9 were regularized on\nthe post of Driver vide order dated 16.12.2003. The\nservices of petitioners No.10 & 11 were regularized on\nthe post of Driver vide order dated 19.1.2004. On\n 28.10.2015, information was sought from the petitioners\nwith regard to regularization of their services and they\nwere given 3 daysâ time to submit explanation. The\npetitioners submitted their reply to letter dated\n28.10.2015. Thereafter, by impugned order dated\n19.11.2015 the orders of regularization of services of the\npetitioners were cancelled.\n\n20. The petitioners in Writ Petition No.1813/2016 the\npetitioners were appointed on daily wage basis in the year\n1983. Thereafter, there services were regularized vide\norder dated 12.1.2004 on the post of Pump Operators. On\n28.10.2015, information was sought from the petitioners\nwith regard to regularization of their services and they\nwere given 3 daysâ time to submit explanation. The\npetitioners submitted their reply to letter dated\n28.10.2015. Thereafter, by impugned order dated\n19.11.2015 the orders of regularization of services of the\npetitioners were cancelled.\n\n21. The petitioner in Writ Petition No.1936/2016 the\npetitioner was appointed on daily wage basis on 31.1.1987\nin Fire Brigade Department. The services of the petitioner\nwere regularized vide order dated 28.1.2004. On\n28.10.2015, information was sought from the petitioner\nwith regard to regularization of their services and he was\ngiven 3 daysâ time to submit explanation. The petitioner\nsubmitted his reply to letter dated 28.10.2015. Thereafter,\n by impugned order dated 19.11.2015 the order of\nregularization of services of the petitioner was cancelled.\n\n22. Mrs.Shobha Menon, learned senior counsel for the\npetitioners submitted that impugned orders directing de-\nregularisation of services of petitioner have been passed in\ncontravention of the order dated 27.2.2003 passed in Writ\nPetition No.3460/1994 as well as order dated 01.9.2005\npassed in Writ Petition No.8359/2005. It is further\nsubmitted that seniority list was required to be prepared\nafter inviting objections, which has not been done. It has\nalso been submitted that cyclostyled orders have been\npassed which reflect non-application of mind. It is further\nsubmitted that while passing impugned orders the material\non the basis of which original orders of regularization were\npassed, has not been taken into account. It is also\ncontended that services of the petitioners, who are regular\nemployees of the respondent-Corporation, cannot be de-\nregularized without holding an enquiry. It is urged that\npetitioners, have put in more than 12 years of service as\nregular employees and, therefore, the Corporation\ncommitted manifest error in un-settling the settled things.\nIt is further submitted that reasons spelt out in the show-\ncause notice do not find place in the impugned orders,\ntherefore, the same have been passed in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice. While inviting the attention of\nthis Court to order dated 25.7.2012 passed in\nW.P.no.10263/2012 it is submitted that, in fact, no seniority\n list was prepared till 2012 and the action of respondents in\nde-regularising the services of the petitioners is\ncontemptuous. It is also submitted that respondents ought\nto have taken into account the principle of fair play while\nconsidering the qualification/eligibility while deciding the\nquestion of regularization of services of the petitioners. In\nsupport of her submissions, learned senior counsel has\nplaced reliance on order dated 30.8.1997 passed in Writ\nPetition No.2040/1997 [Prabhudayal Pandey vs. M.P.\nState Agricultural Marketing Board and another].\n\n23. Mr.D.K.Dixit, learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that impugned order of de-regualrisation of\nservices of petitioner is arbitrary as the Supreme Court in\nthe case of State of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi, (2006) 4\nSCC 1 has held that the services of persons who have been\nregularized, cannot be de-regularized. \nIt is further\nsubmitted that in the case of \nU.P. State Electricity Board\nvs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and others\n [Civil Appeal\nNo.3765/2001 decided on 09.10.2007] it has been held that\neven if Uma Deviâs case is to be applied, the protection\ncontained in \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India cannot\nbe overlooked and all the petitioners who have rendered\ntheir services for past about 10 years are entitled to the\nbenefit of regularization.\n\n24. Mr.Manoj Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that petitioner No.6 in W.P.No.20726/2015 was\n never served with the show-cause notice, but straight away\nthe impugned order dated 19.11.2015 has been passed.\nThus, the petitioner No.6, in the aforesaid writ petition has\nbeen condemned unheard. It is also submitted that show-\ncause notice does not fulfil the requirement of show-cause\nand no effective opportunity of hearing was afforded to\npetitioner as only 3 daysâ time is given by respondent to\nthe petitioner to show cause. It is further submitted that\naction of de-regularisation of services of the petitioners is\nvitiated on account of non-preparation of seniority list. It is\nalso urged that it is nobodyâs case that petitioners are\nnot entitled for regularization. The only issue which\nrequires to be adjudicated is, whether they have been\nregularized in the order of seniority against the posts\nwhich befit their qualification. It is also submitted that\nissue with regard to non-availability of posts, especially\nthat of not following the reservation and roster, cannot be\nmade a ground after a decade, as long experience has been\nacquired by the petitioners on the post on which they are\nregularized and the same takes care of qualification. \nIn this\nconnection reference has been made to the decision in the\ncase of \nBhagwati Prasad vs. Delhi Mineral\nDevelopment Corporation\n, (1990) 1 SCC 361. Lastly, it is\nurged that the impugned orders have the effect of\nunsettling the settled things after a decade by taking\nrecourse to casual process.\n\n25. Mr.Shashank Shekhar, learned counsel for the\n petitioner has submitted that action of respondent\ndemonstrates pre-determination and prejudice inasmuch as\nimpugned orders have been passed in utter contravention\nof the settled proposition of service jurisprudence. It is\nfurther submitted that administrative decisions are\nexpected to be taken reasonably and within reasonable\ntime. In the instant case, the impugned decision has been\ntaken after a period of 12 years.\n\n25. Mr.Vipin Yadav, learned counsel for the petitioners\nsubmitted that letter dated 28.10.2015 purported to be\nshow-cause notice cannot be termed as âshow-cause\nnoticeâ as it requires the grounds to be stated, according\nto which the action is necessitated, particularly the\npenalty/action which is proposed to be taken. \nIn support of\naforesaid submission he has placed reliance on the decision\nin the case of \nGorkha Security Services vs. Government\n(NCT of Delhi) and others\n, (2014) 9 SCC 105.\n While\nreferring to paragraph 44 of the decision in the case of\nUma Devi (supra) it is contended that if regularization is\nalready made and is not subjudice, the same need not be\nre-opened. Therefore, the impugned orders of de-\nregularisation are contrary to the decision in the case of\nUma Deviâs case. It is further submitted that since the\norder of regularization has been cancelled after 11 years,\ntherefore, the same is bad in law. \nIn support of aforesaid\nsubmission reliance has been placed on the decision in the\ncases of \nBuddhi Nath Chaudhary and others vs. Abahi\n Kumar and others\n, (2001) 3 SCC 328, Rajendra v. State\nof Maharashtra, \nAIR 2008 SCW 2877 and Radha Mohan\nGoswami vs. State of M.P.\n, (2004) 2 MPHT 49.\n\n26. Mr.Ashish Agrawal, learned counsel for the petitioner\nin Writ Petition No.1936/2016 and Mr.Deepak Singh,\nlearned counsel for petitioner in Writ Petition No.61/2016\nhave adopted the submissions made by learned counsel for\nthe petitioners in other writ petitions.\n\n27. On the other hand, Mr.Anshuman Singh, learned\ncounsel while opposing the submissions made on behalf of\nlearned counsel for the petitioners, has submitted that\nimpugned orders have been passed in compliance with\nprinciples of natural justice. It is further submitted that it is\nwell settled in law that principles of natural justice cannot\nbe put in straight jacket formula and non-observance does\nnot automatically result in setting aside any administrative\naction. It is also submitted that party alleging violation of\nprinciples of natural justice has to show prejudice and has\nto demonstrate how the action could have been different if\nopportunity would have been granted. \nIn support of\naforesaid submission reference has been made to decision\nof Supreme Court in the cases of \nManaging Director,\nECIL v. B. Karunakar\n, (\n1993) 4 SCC 727 and Dharampal\nSatyapal Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Central\nExcise\n, (2015) 8 SCC 519. It is contended that none of the\npetitioners have been able to demonstrate as to whether\n the post were, in fact, vacant or juniors to them have been\nregularized or they fulfil the qualification or that\nreservation roster was followed. It is urged that none of the\npetitioners have been able to demonstrate prejudice,\ntherefore, the submission with regard to non-compliance of\nprinciples of natural justice deserves to be rejected. It is\nargued by him that contention of petitioners that since\nseniority lists have not been prepared, therefore, the\norders with regard to de-regularisation cannot be passed,\nalso does not deserve acceptance as the respondents have\nprepared separate gradation lists for four categories,\nnamely, daily wagers of technical post engaged prior to\n31.12.1988; daily wagers of technical post engaged\nsubsequent to 01.1.1989; daily wager of non-technical post\nengaged prior to 31.12.1988 and daily wager of non-\ntechnical post engaged subsequent to 01.1.1989. It is also\nargued that aforesaid gradation lists were prepared as on\n01.1.2009. It is submitted that since petitioners were\ncontinuing in regular establishment, therefore, their names\nwere not mentioned in the aforesaid gradation lists and\nthey only contain the names of daily wage employees. It is\nalso urged that contention raised on behalf of petitioners\nthat even till 2012 the gradation list was not prepared\ndeserves to be rejected as gradation list was prepared in\nthe year 2009 itself. It was further argued that respondent-\nCorporation was not represented at the time when the\norder dated 25.7.2012 was passed, as the said fact could\nnot brought to the notice of the High Court. It is also\n submitted that even non-existence of names of petitioners\nin the gradation list is inconsequential as petitioners have\nfailed to demonstrate any prejudice to them.\nIt is urged that doctrine of severability applies in respect of\nadministrative orders as well and in case an order which\ncontains many reasons, and some reasons are severable\nfrom another, the order can be justified on the basis of\nsustainable reasons, notwithstanding that Court may not\nagree with the unsustainable reasons.\n \nIn this connection,\nreference is made to the decision of Supreme Court in the\ncases of \nP.D.Agrawal vs. State Bank of India\n, (\n2006) 8\nSCC 776 and Krishnakali Tea Estate vs. Akhil\nBharatiya Chah Majdoor Sangh\n, (2004) 8 SCC 200. It is\nalso contended that impugned order of de-regularisation\nhas been passed on the basis of non-fulfilment of\neducational qualification, non-availability of vacant post\nand non following of reservation roster and not following\nthe principle of seniority. The aforesaid grounds are\nsufficient to justice the orders of de-regularisation.\n It is\nfurther submitted that regularization of services of the\npetitioners falls in the category of illegal appointment as\nper law \nlaid down in\n the case of Uma Devi (supra) and,\ntherefore, the respondent is fully justified in de-\nregularising the services of the petitioners. \nIt is also urged\nthat submission of petitioners that long existing position\ncannot be unsettled runs contrary to recent decision of\nDivision Bench in the case of \nManukhlal Saraf vs. Arun\nKumar Tiwari and others\n [W.P.No.198/1999]. It is also\n argued that petitioner No.6 in W.P.No.20726/2015 has\nbeen transferred to Municipal Corporation, Satna,\ntherefore, he has not received any notice or order.\nHowever, aforesaid fact has not been mentioned in the writ\npetition. Lastly, it is urged that impugned orders have been\npassed on the basis of grounds which are mentioned in the\nshow-cause notice and in every case there are justifiable\nreasons which makes the appointment illegal and which\nhas its foundation in the show-cause notice. Therefore, the\nimpugned orders of deregularisation of services of the\npetitioners are justified and do not call for any interference\nof this Court.\n\n28. I have considered the respective submissions on both\nsides. The Supreme Court in the case of \nSwadeshi Cotton\nMills vs. Union of India\n, AIR 1981 SC 818, while\nrecognizing the rule of fair play as a necessary concomitant\nof principle of natural justice, has held that this rule of fair\nplay must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional\ncircumstances where compulsive necessity so demands.\nThe court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal\nrule to the maximum extent possible, with situational\nmodifications.\n \nIn \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n, AIR\n1978 SC 597 it was held that natural justice is a great\nhumanizing principle and the soul of natural justice is fair\nplay in action. It is further held that it is well established\nthat rules of natural justice are not rigid rules, they are\nflexible and their application depends upon the setting and\nbackground of statutory provisions, nature of right, which\n may be affected, and the consequences which may entail.\nIts application depends upon the facts and circumstances\nof each case. The necessary facet of principles of natural\njustice before the process of adjudication starts, is that the\nauthority concerned give to the affected a notice of the\ncase against him and action proposed to be taken against\nhim, so that he may adequately defend himself. A notice is\nregarded as the minimum obligatory condition. It is the\nsine qua non of fair hearing.\n [See: East India Commercial\nco. Vs. Collector of Customs, AIR 1962 SC 1893 and\nRaymond Woollen Mills Ltd. vs. D.G.(Investigation\nand Registration), (2008) 12 SCC 73]. It is equally well\nsettled principle that notice must be precise and\nunambiguous. It should apprise the party determinatively\nof the case he has to meet and should give adequate time.\nIn the absence of notice of any kind and reasonable\nopportunity, the order passed becomes wholly vitiated.\n\n[See: \nCanara Bank vs. Debasis Das\n, (\n2003) 4 SCC 557\nand Canara Bank vs. V.K.Awasthy\n, (2005) 6 SCC 321].\nThe notice must be effective and must be adequate as\nregards the details of the case, so that the noticee gets an\nadequate opportunity to represent against the impugned\naction. A notice in order to be valid has to fulfil following\ntwo attributes viz. (i) it must be adequate and (ii) it should\nfully mention all the grounds, on which, the action is\nproposed to be taken against the noticee. The grounds\ngiven in the notice, on which the action is proposed to be\ntaken, should be couched in clear, specific and\n unambiguous terms and not in vague or general terms.\n\n[See: Board of Technical Education, U.P. Vs.\nDhanwantare Kumar, AIR 1991 SC 271]. It is equally well\nsettled legal proposition that if notice mentions one ground\nand the action is taken on some other ground or action is\ntaken on some additional ground, which is not mentioned\nin notice, such notice suffers from vagueness and would\namount to violation of principles of natural justice. \n[See:\n\nJ.Vilanagandan v. Executive Engineer\n, \nAIR 1978 SC and\nNasir Ahmed v. Assistant Custodian-General, Evacuee\nProperty\n, AIR 1980 SC 1157]. A hearing to be fair must\nfulfil several conditions: (i) The adjudicating authority\nshould receive all the relevant material which the\nindividual wishes to produce. (ii) It should disclose all\ninformation, evidence or material which the authority\nwishes to use against the individual concerned in arriving\nat its decision. (iii) It should give to the individual\nconcerned an opportunity to rebut such information or\nmaterial. Reasonable time should be granted to submit\nreply to the show-cause notice. [See: (2008) 13 SCC 689].\nIt is equally well settled legal proposition that grounds in\nthe show-cause notice must be ones which are relied on in\nthe impugned order. Otherwise, the action would be held\nto be in violation of principles of natural justice.\n \n[See:\n\nTarlochan Dev Sharma vs. State of Punjab and others\n,\n(\n2001) 6 SCC 261 and CCE Vs. Sheetal International\n,\n(2011) 1 SCC 109]. The principles of natural justice are\ngrounded in procedural fairness which ensures taking of\n correct decisions and procedural fairness is fundamentally\nan instrumental good, in the sense that procedure should\nbe designed to ensure accurate and appropriate outcomes.\n\n[See: \nDharampal Satyapal Ltd.\n(supra)]\n\n29. In the backdrop of aforesaid well settled legal position,\nthe facts of the cases may be taken note of. Admittedly, the\npetitioners had filed writ petitions seeking their\nregularization which were disposed of by order dated\n27.2.2002 passed in Writ Petition No.1464/2001\n[Ramadhar Kushwaha vs. State of M.P. and others]. The\nrelevant extract of the said order reads as under:-\n\n â4. As the Corporation itself has decided to\n regularize the services of employees who are\n st\n working prior to 31 December, 1988, by which\n every employee will get his right according to\n his seniority on availability of post and on\n fulfilling the eligibility. In the circumstances,\n contention of the learned counsel appearing for\n the Corporation, that the Corporation is\n regularizing the services of employees as per\n policy decision which is in the uniform policy, is\n accepted and in respect of those employees who\n st\n are working prior to 31 December,1988,\n following directions are issued:-\n\n (a) Respondent Corporation who has already\n prepared the seniority list of daily rated\n st\n employees who are working prior to 31\n December, 1988 will regularize the services of\n daily rate employees strictly as per their\n seniority and eligibility subject to availability of\n post.\n\n (b) The respondent-Corporation has prepared\n aforesaid seniority list in two heads, technical\n and non-technical, will be at liberty to fill up the\n technical post on availability of technical post\nfrom daily rated worker who possesses requisite\nqualification. If the technical post is not\navailable and the employee comes in the\nseniority criteria then respondent Corporation\nwill be at liberty to regularize that person even\non non-technical post, if such employee so\nchooses or opts such regularization.\n\n(c ) So far as non-technical persons are\nconcerned, all the daily rated workmen will get\ntheir regularization as soon as the posts become\navailable as per his seniority and eligibility.\n\n(d) This order will not affect those employees\nwho have already been regularized because of\nthe order passed by the High court or by Labour\nCourt and the aforesaid order has reached its\nfinality. But so far as the other employees are\nconcerned, their services will be regularized as\nper the direction issued today including those\nwhose regularization are under challenge before\nthis Court.\n\n(e) As the employees are to be regularized or\nclassified on particular post on the availability of\nvacant post, as has been held in Full Bench\ndecision by this Court in \nSuperintending\nEngineer Vs. State of M.P. and others\n, [1999 (1)\nMPJR 1], in the circumstances, if any litigation\nin respect of employee who is working prior to\n31-12-1988 or after 1-1-1989 respondent-\n Corporation will place this order before the\nLabour Court \nin that case\n and labour courts will\nstrictly follow the decision of Full Bench\nJudgment and directions issued today in this\ncase.\n\n(f) In respect of those cases in which any junior\nperson has been regularized ignoring seniority\nof other daily rate employees and if presently\nthe order is under challenge before this Court,\nthe aforesaid order of regularization by the\nlabour court stand modified, as per this order.\n\n(g) Those employees who are not satisfied with\ntheir seniority in the seniority list will file fresh\nrepresentation before respondent Municipal\nCorporation within a period of sixty days from\ntoday and Municipal Corporation will decide the\nseniority of those unsatisfied employees within a\nperiod of ninety days thereafter.\n\n(h) So far as the regularization of the employees\nworking prior to 31-12-1988 are concerned, the\nrespondent will consider the cases for\nregularization as and when the posts are\navailable strictly according to their seniority.\n\n5. In respect of employees who are engaged\nafter 1-1-1989 is concerned, following directions\nare issued:-\n\n(a) Respondent will prepare a fresh seniority list\nof all those employees who are continuously\n working in the Corporation and have achieved\nthe status of permanent workman. This shall be\ndone within 90 days from today.\n\n(b) The aforesaid list will be duly published by\nthe Corporation and after considering objections\nof the employees, the aforesaid seniority list will\nbe finalized.\n\n(c ) The respondent Corporation on availability\nof post, after exhausting the list of employees\nworking prior to 31-12-88 will regularize the\nservices of all those employees strictly in\naccordance with their seniority and as per policy\nAnnexure-R-4.\n\n(d) The policy Annexure R-4 will also be\napplicable in respect of employees who are\nworking after 1.1.89 and have achieved a\npermanent status as per provisions of standing\norder.\n\n(e) For regularizing the services of workmen\nworking after 1-1-1989, respondent-Corporation\nwill also observe the reservation as has been\nmentioned in the Policy Annexure R-4 and in\ncase daily rated employees are available of\nreserved quota then respondent will fill up the\naforesaid quota by regularizing the services of\nthose employees who belongs to reserved\ncategory on priority basis and if any such post\nremains vacant then they will follow the\n provisions of reservation by the State of M.P.\n\n With the aforesaid directions, the petitions are\n finally disposed of.â\n\n30. Thereafter, the services of the petitioners were de-\nregularised by order dated 10.8.2005, which was assailed\nin a bunch of writ petition, which was disposed of by order\ndated 01.9.2005. The relevant extract of the order reads as\nunder:-\n\n â In these writ petitions an order dated\n 10.8.2005 has been assailed, by which\n regularization of the petitioners has been\n cancelled without giving them an opportunity of\n hearing. The services of the petitioners were\n regularized after they have rendered the service\n for consideration period. Order of regularization\n was passed after petitioners have rendered the\n services for long period, is not in dispute.\n\n Opportunity of hearing has not been afforded, is\n also not in dispute. The ground on which the\n order of regularization has been cancelled\n behind the back of the petitioners is that correct\n gradation list was not prepared, as such some of\n the incumbents may have been illegally\n regularized by the Municipal Corporation,\n Jabalpur.\n\n After hearing learned counsel for the parties at\n length, in my opinion, the Corporation is not\n sure at this stage which of the incumbents have\n been wrongly regularized. As the Corporation is\nstill preparing the gradation list, on the basis of\nwhich it has to be determined by the\nCorporation that which of the incumbents were\nnot entitled for regularization. May be that\nseniority list which was earlier prepared was\nincorrect, once regularization was made the\npetitioners were required to be heard by the\nMunicipal Corporation before passing order of\nderegularisation and in case their case was not\nin the seniority of the employees which is the\ncorrect seniority as per the Municipal\nCorporation, only \nin that case\n the order of\nregularization should have been cancelled only\nin consonance of principle of natural justice\nafter hearing the petitioners. \nThus, the order dt.\n10.8.2005 which has been passed without\nhearing the petitioners, without apprising them\nof the cause of de-regularisation cannot be\nallowed to sustain, once the order of\nregularization has been passed after serving for\nconsiderable period, order derogatory to the\ninterest of civil rights of the employees could\nnot have been passed without hearing them as\nper law \nlaid down by\n the Apex Corut in\n\nKu.Neelima Mishra v. Harinder Kaur Paintal and\nothers\n, AIR 1990 SC 1402. Thus, the order dt.\n10.8.2005 is hereby set aside with liberty to the\nMunicipal Corporation to prepare the seniority\nlist, to hear the petitioners and thereafter pass\norder of de-regularisation if warranted. There\nwere Contempt Petition No.70/04 filed, in which,\nin accordance with the direction given in the\n contempt petition, seniority list has to be\n prepared afresh. However, that does not absolve\n the Corporation from hearing the petitioners\n and passing appropriate order in accordance\n with law. Let the seniority list be prepared as\n directed in the Contempt Petition.\n\n Writ petitions are allowed to the extent\n indicated above. Parties to bear their own\n costs.â\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n31. Thereafter, in a bunch of writ petitions, in which\nchallenge was made to the validity of the show-cause\nnotice dated 27.8.2011, was disposed of with the following\ndirections:-\n\n âAs a result, without expressing any opinion\n on the merits of the controversy, we dispose of\n these petitions with direction to the\n Commissioner to decide the matter after\n considering the response given by the\n petitioners expeditiously by giving due\n opportunity to the writ petitioners, in any case,\n not later than four weeks from today and\n communicate the decision so taken to the\n petitioners within the same time. If the decision\n is adverse, the petitioners will be free to\n challenge the same by say of appropriate\n proceedings. That will be decided on its own\n merits.\n\n32. It is pertinent to note that Corporation itself had\nframed a scheme for regularisation of services of the daily\n wage employees and the orders of the regularisation of\nservices of the petitioners have been passed in the year\n2003 i.e. prior t decision in Umadevi'v case (supra). A\ncomparative chart to indicate the grounds mentioned in the\nshow-cause notices and in the impugned orders in order to\nascertain whether there is compliance with the principles\nof natural justice, is reproduced below:-\n\n Show-cause Impugned\nW.P.No. Petitioner Remark\n notice order\n\n a) The defence of the petitioner that\n services were regularized in clerical\n\n a) Did not cadre and he is

From perusal of the above chart, it is evident that\naction against the petitioners have been taken in violation\nof principles of natural justice for the following reasons:-\n\n(a) From perusal of order dated 01.9.2005 passed in Writ\nPetition No.8359/2005 it is axiomatic that respondent-\n\nCorporation was granted liberty to prepare the seniority\nlist after affording an opportunity of hearing to the\npetitioners and thereafter pass an orders of de-\nregularisation, if warranted.\n\n (b) From perusal of impugned orders it is evident that\nrespondent-Corporation has concluded that principle of\nseniority has not been violated on the basis of seniority list\nprepared in the year 2003, whereas in the return as well as\nin the written synopsis produced before this Court, a stand\nhas been taken that seniority list has been prepared in the\nyear 2009. In the seniority list prepared in the year 2009,\nthe names of petitioners do not find place, as the orders of\nregularization of services of petitioners were already\npassed.\n\n(c ) Thus, it is evident that a consolidated seniority list\nincluding the names of petitioners in compliance of order\ndated 01.9.2005 passed by this Court has not been\nprepared. Therefore, in the absence of the same it is not\npossible for the Corporation to conclude that the principle\nof seniority has not been followed.\n\n(d) The grounds mentioned in the show-cause notices in\nmost of the cases are different than the ones, on which, the\nimpugned orders have been passed, which is evident from\nthe chart reproduced above.\n\n(e) In the impugned orders it has been recorded that\npetitioners have failed to produce any document to show\ntheir educational qualification, whereas by way of show-\ncause notices the petitioners were never asked to submit\ndocument with regard to their educational qualifications\n alongwith the reply.\n\n(f) The defence set up by the petitioners in their replies has\nnot been considered while passing the impugned orders;\n\n(g) Since the case of the petitioners were considered with\nreference to the gradation list prepared on 09.12.2003 and\nnot with reference to the gradation list prepared in the\nyear 2009, in which the names of the petitioners do not\nappear, therefore, it is not possible to infer whether any\nvacant posts were available in the year 2003.\n\n(h) The petitioners were granted only three daysâ time to\nsubmit their replies, which was inadequate in the fact\nsituation of the case.\n\nThus, from the facts narrated supra, it is evident that\norders of de-regularisation have been passed in violation of\nprinciples of natural justice, which cannot be sustained in\nthe eye of law.\n\n34. The contention raised by learned counsel for\nrespondent-Corporation that impugned orders have been\npassed in compliance of principles of natural justice,\ntherefore, cannot be accepted in the fact situation of the\ncase. Similarly, the contention that petitioners have failed\nto demonstrate any prejudice also cannot be accepted, as\nthe prejudice is writ large in the fact situation of the case,\n as show-cause notices have been issued on one ground and\nimpugned orders have been passed on other grounds. The\npetitioners have not been given sufficient time to respond\nto the show-cause notice and the petitioners were not even\nasked to submit documents alongwith the reply. However,\nan adverse inference has been drawn on account of non-\nsubmission of documents. The defence of the petitioners\nhas also not been considered while passing the impugned\norders. The respondent-Corporation was under an\nobligation to prepare the seniority list containing the\nnames of the petitioners to ascertain whether or not the\nprinciple of seniority has been violated. From perusal of\nchart, it is evident that doctrine of severability does not\napply to the fact situation of the case.\n\n36. In view of preceding analysis, the impugned orders of\nde-regularisation of services of the petitioners dated\n19.11.2015 are hereby quashed. The Corporation may take\naction for de-regularisation of services of the petitioners, if\nso advised, in the light of law \nlaid down by\n the Supreme\nCourt in the case of Umadevi's (supra) particularly in the\nlight of observations made in paragraph 53 of the decision.\nNeedless to state, the respondent-Corporation shall first\nprepare the seniority list containing the names of\npetitioners as directed vide order dated 01.9.2005 passed\nby a Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.8359/2005,\nafter inviting objections, and thereafter may issue show-\ncause notices to the petitioners containing precise grounds,\n on which, action of de-regularisation of services of\npetitioners is sought to be taken. The show-cause notices\nshall clearly state the documents which the petitioners, in\nthe opinion of respondent, are required to produce in\nsupport of their claim. Needless to state, the respondent-\nCorporation shall pass speaking orders.\n\n37. With the aforesaid directions, the writ petitions stand\ndisposed of.\n\n(Alok Aradhe)\nJudge\nRM",

It is also submitted that party alleging violation of\nprinciples of natural justice has to show prejudice and has\nto demonstrate how the action could have been different if\nopportunity would have been granted. \nIn support of\naforesaid submission reference has been made to decision\nof Supreme Court in the cases of \nManaging Director,\nECIL v. B. Karunakar\n, (\n1993) 4 SCC 727 and Dharampal\nSatyapal Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Central\nExcise\n, (2015) 8 SCC 519. It is contended that none of the\npetitioners have been able to demonstrate as to whether\n the post were, in fact, vacant or juniors to them have been\nregularized or they fulfil the qualification or that\nreservation roster was followed. It is urged that none of the\npetitioners have been able to demonstrate prejudice,\ntherefore, the submission with regard to non-compliance of\nprinciples of natural justice deserves to be rejected. It is\nargued by him that contention of petitioners that since\nseniority lists have not been prepared, therefore, the\norders with regard to de-regularisation cannot be passed,\nalso does not deserve acceptance as the respondents have\nprepared separate gradation lists for four categories,\nnamely, daily wagers of technical post engaged prior to\n31.12.1988; daily wagers of technical post engaged\nsubsequent to 01.1.1989; daily wager of non-technical post\nengaged prior to 31.12.1988 and daily wager of non-\ntechnical post engaged subsequent to 01.1.1989. It is also\nargued that aforesaid gradation lists were prepared as on\n01.1.2009. It is submitted that since petitioners were\ncontinuing in regular establishment, therefore, their names\nwere not mentioned in the aforesaid gradation lists and\nthey only contain the names of daily wage employees. It is\nalso urged that contention raised on behalf of petitioners\nthat even till 2012 the gradation list was not prepared\ndeserves to be rejected as gradation list was prepared in\nthe year 2009 itself. It was further argued that respondent-\nCorporation was not represented at the time when the\norder dated 25.7.2012 was passed, as the said fact could\nnot brought to the notice of the High Court. It is also\n submitted that even non-existence of names of petitioners\nin the gradation list is inconsequential as petitioners have\nfailed to demonstrate any prejudice to them.\nIt is urged that doctrine of severability applies in respect of\nadministrative orders as well and in case an order which\ncontains many reasons, and some reasons are severable\nfrom another, the order can be justified on the basis of\nsustainable reasons, notwithstanding that Court may not\nagree with the unsustainable reasons.\n \nIn this connection,\nreference is made to the decision of Supreme Court in the\ncases of \nP.D.Agrawal vs. State Bank of India\n, (\n2006) 8\nSCC 776 and Krishnakali Tea Estate vs. Akhil\nBharatiya Chah Majdoor Sangh\n, (2004) 8 SCC 200. It is\nalso contended that impugned order of de-regularisation\nhas been passed on the basis of non-fulfilment of\neducational qualification, non-availability of vacant post\nand non following of reservation roster and not following\nthe principle of seniority. The aforesaid grounds are\nsufficient to justice the orders of de-regularisation.\n It is\nfurther submitted that regularization of services of the\npetitioners falls in the category of illegal appointment as\nper law \nlaid down in\n the case of Uma Devi (supra) and,\ntherefore, the respondent is fully justified in de-\nregularising the services of the petitioners. \nIt is also urged\nthat submission of petitioners that long existing position\ncannot be unsettled runs contrary to recent decision of\nDivision Bench in the case of \nManukhlal Saraf vs. Arun\nKumar Tiwari and others\n [W.P.No.198/1999]. It is also\n argued that petitioner No.6 in W.P.No.20726/2015 has\nbeen transferred to Municipal Corporation, Satna,\ntherefore, he has not received any notice or order.\nHowever, aforesaid fact has not been mentioned in the writ\npetition. Lastly, it is urged that impugned orders have been\npassed on the basis of grounds which are mentioned in the\nshow-cause notice and in every case there are justifiable\nreasons which makes the appointment illegal and which\nhas its foundation in the show-cause notice. Therefore, the\nimpugned orders of deregularisation of services of the\npetitioners are justified and do not call for any interference\nof this Court."
