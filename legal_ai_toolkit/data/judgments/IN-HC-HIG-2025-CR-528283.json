JUSTICE P.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\n\nTHURSDAY, THE 9TH DAY OF JANUARY 2025 / 19TH POUSHA, 1946\n\nBAIL APPL. NO. 287 OF 2025\n\nCRIME NO.1196/2024 OF PUDUKKAD POLICE STATION, THRISSUR\n\nAGAINST THE ORDER/JUDGMENT IN Bail Appl.\n\nNO.10592 OF 2024 OF HIGH COURT OF KERALA\n\nPETITIONER(S):\n\nMOHANAN\nAGED 70 YEARS, S/O KUMARAN PATTATHUPARAMBIL\nHOUSE, CHITTILASSERY DESOM, NENMANIKKARA\nVILLAGE, PUDUKAD P O, THRISSUR DISTRICT,\nPIN - 680 301\n\nBY ADVS.\nJITHIN BABU A\nARUN SAMUEL\nANOOD JALAL K.J.\nRESPONDENT(S):\nSTATE OF KERALA\nREPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA, PIN - 682031\nBY ADV.:\nADV.SRI.NOUSHAD K.A. - SR.PP\nTHIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2025, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE\nFOLLOWING:\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN, J.\n-------------------------------------------\nBA No.287 of 2025\n--------------------------------------------\nDated this the 09th day of January, 2025\n\nORDER\n\nThis Bail Application is filed under Section\n\n483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita\n\n(BNSS), 2023.\n\n2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime\n\nNo.1196/2024 of Pudukkad Police Station,\n\nThrissur. The above case is registered against the\n\npetitioner alleging offences punishable under\n\nSections 506\n,\nand\nof Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. The prosecution case is that, on\n\n10.11.2021 at about 09.00 PM, the petitioner\n\ncommitted rape on his own daughter-in-law and\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nthereby committed the above said offences.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The petitioner earlier filed a bail\n\napplication before this Court as BA\n\nNo.10592/2024. After hearing the counsel for the\n\npetitioner and the Public Prosecutor, this Court\n\nwas not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner\n\nbecause of the serious allegation against the\n\npetitioner. At that stage, the counsel for the\n\npetitioner seeks permission to withdraw the bail\n\napplication with liberty to move it again after two\n\nweeks and this Court granted liberty. Accordingly,\n\nthis second bail application is filed. Now, the\n\npetitioner is in custody for 45 days.\n\n6. It is true that the allegation against the\n\npetitioner is very serious. According to the\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\npetitioner, it is a false case foisted against the\n\npetitioner at the instance of the daughter-in-law\n\nof the petitioner. It is also submitted that the son\n\nof the petitioner filed a divorce petition against\n\nthe defacto complainant and because of the\n\nsame, the present complaint is filed. The\n\npetitioner also produced a disability certificate\n\nshowing that, he is having 40% disability.\n\nConsidering the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase and also considering the fact that the\n\npetitioner is in custody from 26.11.2024, I think,\n\nthe petitioner can be released on bail after\n\nimposing stringent conditions. There can be a\n\ndirection to the petitioner to appear before the\n\nInvestigating Officer on all Mondays at 10.00 AM,\n\ntill final report is filed.\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\n7. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle\n\nthat the bail is the rule and the jail is the\n\nexception. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nChidambaram.\nP v. Directorate of\n\nEnforcement\n[2019 (16) SCALE 870], after\n\nconsidering all the earlier judgments, observed\n\nthat, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail\n\nremains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is\n\nthe rule and refusal is the exception so as to\n\nensure that the accused has the opportunity of\n\nsecuring fair trial.\n\n8. Moreover, in\nJalaluddin Khan v. Union\n\nof India\n[2024 KHC 6431], the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt observed that:\n\n\"21. Before we part with the Judgment,\nwe must mention here that the Special\nCourt and the High Court did not\nconsider the material in the charge\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nsheet objectively. Perhaps the focus was\nmore on the activities of PFI, and\ntherefore, the appellant's case could not\nbe properly appreciated. When a case is\nmade out for a grant of bail, the Courts\nshould not have any hesitation in\ngranting bail. The allegations of the\nprosecution may be very serious. But,\nthe duty of the Courts is to consider the\ncase for grant of bail in accordance with\nthe law. \"Bail is the rule and jail is an\nexception\" is a settled law. Even in a\ncase like the present case where there\nare stringent conditions for the grant of\nbail in the relevant statutes, the same\nrule holds good with only modification\nthat the bail can be granted if the\nconditions in the statute are satisfied.\nThe rule also means that once a case is\nmade out for the grant of bail, the Court\ncannot decline to grant bail. If the Courts\nstart denying bail in deserving cases, it\nwill be a violation of the rights\nguaranteed under\nArt.21\nof our\nConstitution.\" (underline supplied)\n\n9.\nIn\nManish Sisodia v. Directorate\nof\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nEnforcement [2024 KHC 6426], also the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observed that:\n\n\"53. The Court further observed that, over\na period of time, the trial courts and the\nHigh Courts have forgotten a very well -\nsettled principle of law that bail is not to\nbe withheld as a punishment. From our\nexperience, we can say that it appears\nthat the trial courts and the High Courts\nattempt to play safe in matters of grant of\nbail. The principle that bail is a rule and\nrefusal is an exception is, at times,\nfollowed in breach. On account of non -\ngrant of bail even in straight forward open\nand shut cases, this Court is flooded with\nhuge number of bail petitions thereby\nadding to the huge pendency. It is high\ntime that the trial courts and the High\nCourts should recognize the principle that\n\"bail is rule and jail is exception\".\"\n\n10. Considering the dictum\nlaid down in\nthe\n\nabove decisions and considering the facts and\n\ncircumstances of this case, this Bail Application is\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nallowed with the following directions:\n\n1. Petitioner shall be released on bail\n\non executing a bond for Rs.50,000/-\n\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with\n\ntwo solvent sureties each for the\n\nlike sum to the satisfaction of the\n\njurisdictional Court.\n\n2. The petitioner shall appear before\n\nthe Investigating Officer for\n\ninterrogation as and when required.\n\nThe petitioner shall co-operate with\n\nthe investigation and shall not,\n\ndirectly or indirectly make any\n\ninducement, threat or promise to\n\nany person acquainted with the\n\nfacts of the case so as to dissuade\n\nhim from disclosing such facts to\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nthe Court or to any police officer.\n\n3. Petitioner shall not leave India\n\nwithout permission of the\n\njurisdictional Court.\n\n4. Petitioner shall not commit an\n\noffence similar to the offence of\n\nwhich he is accused, or suspected,\n\nof the commission of which he is\n\nsuspected.\n\n5. The petitioner shall appear before\n\nthe Investigating Officer on all\n\nMondays at 10.00 AM, till final\n\nreport is filed.\n\n6. If any of the above conditions are\n\nviolated by the petitioner, the\n\njurisdictional Court can cancel the\n\nbail in accordance with law, even\n\nBA No.287 of 2025\n2025:KER:1290\n\nthough the bail is granted by this\n\nCourt. The prosecution and the\n\nvictim are at liberty to approach the\n\njurisdictional court to cancel the\n\nbail, if there is any violation of the\n\nabove condition.\n\nSd/-\n\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\nnvj JUDGE",
