Deshmukh, JJ.\n\n Date : 21st March, 2012\n\n \n JUDGMENT (Per: Deshmukh, J.) . \n\n 1. This bunch of writ petitions arises out of judgment and order dated 22.11.2002 \n\n \n passed by the learned Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal [hereinafter referred to as \n \n \"the Tribunal\"] in Original Applications No. 254 and 256 of 2000, and subsequent orders \n\n passed in Contempt Petition No 89 of 2003 and other proceedings. [Petitioners herein \n \n are referred to as 'Petitioners' and original applicants before MAT as 'The applicants\" and \n\n the Governments Authorities either as 'Authorities' or 'Respondents no. 1 to 3' for \n\n convenience]\n \n\n 2. Original Application No. 254 of 2000 had been filed on 07-04-2000 by four \n \n\n applicants, who are direct recruits to the Maharashtra Development Service (\"MDS\") \n\n Class I cadre, against Respondents No. 1 to 3 - the government authorities and \n\n Respondents No. 4 to 24 in said original application, who are the promotees to MDS \n\n Class-I cadre, praying for placement of the applicants in seniority list of said cadre above \n\n said Respondents No. 2 to 24 and for consequential benefits. \n\n 3. On 10-04-2000, applicants in Original Application No. 254 of 2000 had filed \n\n Original Application No.256 of 2000 arraigning only aforesaid Respondents No. 1 to 3- \n\n the govt. authorities, seeking directions to work out and declare number of posts \n\n earmarked for direct recruits from 01-04-1982 and also to workout number of promotee \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:15 :::\n\n 15 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n candidates considering their promotions in excess of the recruitment/quota rules to be \n\n \n fortuitous in MDS Class-I cadre and to fill up the created posts of Additional Chief \n\n Executive Officers in Zilla Parishad in accordance with quota rule. \n\n 4. According to the applicants, MDS cadre has been an altogether new cadre formed in \n\n 1973, consisting of Class-I and Class-II posts pursuant to Maharashtra Development \n\n \n [Constitution, Classification and Recruitment] Rules, 1973 [hereinafter referred to as \n\n 'MDS Rules, 1973'] and the posts in said cadre were meant to be filled in by promotion as \n\n well as by nomination with prescription that appointments of direct recruits [nomination] \n\n \n shall be in the range of 35 to 50 per cent and the rest by promotion [departmental \n \n candidates]. The MDS Rules, 1973, have been framed in exercise of powers conferred \n\n upon the State of Maharashtra under proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India. \n\n According to them, in order to achieve proportion of 35 per cent of direct recruits till \n\n 1.4.1982 and 50 percent thereafter, and to maintain the proportion under the rules, the \n\n State Government ought to take proper steps and timely action.\n\n 5. The applicants have submitted that sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the MDS Rules, \n\n 1973, requires that appointment by nomination shall be through the Commission in \n\n accordance with the rules relating to recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collectors and \n\n that proviso thereunder requires the same to be effective from 1.4.1979 or thereafter in \n\n such a phased manner as would ensure that the total number of officers directly recruited \n\n in MDS Class-I cadre shall not at any time after 1.4.1982, be less than 35 per cent and \n\n more than 50 per cent of the total number of permanent posts in that cadre. \n\n 6. The applicants have alleged that respondent authorities did not take action on \n\n their representation in accordance with rules. According to them, direct recruitment \n\n was sought only in 1987 though it was expected immediately on enforcement of the \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 16 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n rules and alleged that initiation had been only in 1985. Government had been loath to \n\n \n take action which has given rise to promotion of in-service candidates from Class-II \n\n cadre. According to the applicants, all promotions of in-service candidates which are in \n\n \n excess of rules are to be regarded as fortuitous. The applicants purport to go back to \n\n August, 1973 and seek review of the situation and removal of disparity created due to \n\n \n alleged non observance of quota rule. According to them, there had been no situational \n\n constraints justifying listless approach of concerned authorities. Applicants cannot be \n\n made to suffer on account of negligence and absence of timely action by the authorities. \n\n According to the applicants, no explanation in this respect should be heard from the \n\n authorities and the authorities are required to be directed to work out the number posts \n \n which were and have been earmarked for direct recruitment and to work out their \n \n backlog and take suitable steps to remove disparity and to give deemed date to the direct \n\n recruits which they would have got in regular course. The applicants contend that \n\n seniority of the promotee candidates from MDS Class-II cadre cannot be reckoned from \n \n\n the date of their actual promotion to MDS Class-I cadre having regard to proportion of \n\n respective categories in MDS Class-I cadre to be maintained according to the rules, \n \n\n contending that promotions are not according to the rules. The applicants had \n\n requested Respondent No. 1 to look into the matter and make suitable alterations to the \n\n seniority list by properly following quota rule, to remove injustice caused to them. The \n\n applicants purport to place reliance on a few judicial pronouncements. The applicants \n\n contend that if suitable changes are not made to the seniority list, MDS Rules, 1973, \n\n would lose their sanctity. Apprehending a situation that the rules may not be followed in \n\n view of a news published about the Minister having declared that the creation of \n\n Additional Chief Executive Officers' posts in Zilla Parishad in the State is for providing a \n\n promotional avenue and thus justifying original applications praying for reliefs referred \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 17 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n to hereinabove.\n\n 7. The applicants have claimed that they are graduates and post graduates in various \n\n \n disciplines and are working in MDS Class-l cadre posts, and that MDS Class-I cadre \n\n comprises Deputy Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Parishad and its equivalent posts viz. \n\n Block Development Officers Class-I, Project Officers Class-I of various units under the \n\n \n Zilla Parishad.\n\n 8. Maharashtra Public Service Commission [hereinafter referred to as \"MPSC\" or \n\n \n \"Commission\" ] examination of the applicants had been held in March, 1988 and the final \n \n outcome had been declared on 11.7.1988. According to applicants such declaration is a \n\n recommendation to appoint them in MDS cadre of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer \n \n Class-I and Block Development Officer Class-I. The applicants refer to a circular dated \n\n 3.12.1971 issued by the General Administration Department of Maharashtra Government \n\n instructing appointments of the candidates selected and recommended by MPSC or by \n \n\n Regional Selection Board within a period of one month by completing requisite \n \n\n formalities and further refer to circular dated 4.4.1991 instructing expeditious \n\n appointments of MPSC recommended candidates and to speed up the process, wherever, \n\n delays in such appointments have been brought to notice by the Members of Legislative \n\n Assembly/Council.\n\n 9. The applicants make a grievance that though MPSC had recommended their \n\n candidature to the government for appointment on 11.7.1988 and though they were \n\n directed to undergo medical examination under communication dated 8.9.1988, yet the \n\n orders were issued to them only on 1.7.1989 i.e. almost after about twelve months. \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 18 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 10. The applicants' grievance is also that on 29.6.1989 i.e. just two days before their \n\n \n orders of appointment dated 1.7.1989, orders of promotion of in-service candidates from \n\n MDS Class-II cadre had been issued by which en-bloc ten persons were promoted. It has \n\n \n been alleged that intervening 23 promotions from the date of recommendation of the \n\n applicants to the date of their actual appointments had been calculated at giving \n\n \n precedence to the promotee candidates over the direct recruits. The promotee candidates \n\n who retired before the applications were filed, have been excluded from being arrayed as \n\n respondents. The applicants purport to allege that long distance in the appointments \n\n \n had been influenced by the promotee candidates. The applicants contend that not only \n\n the ten candidates referred to above, but respondents No. 4 to 26 have been promoted \n \n keeping the issue of appointment of the applicants in abeyance. \n\n 11. The applicants allege that even the constitution of the Departmental Promotion \n\n Committee [hereinafter referred to as the \"DPC\"] had been subsequent to the date on \n\n which applicants' names were recommended by MPSC and thus claim that the \n \n\n departmental candidates' selection is subsequent in point of time. The applicants have \n \n\n also contended that since the government had requisitioned direct recruits to the MPSC \n\n in 1987 pursuant to which their selection had been made, it has to be presumed that \n\n there were vacancies of direct recruits in MDS Class-I cadre. The applicants purported to \n\n urge the Tribunal to consider the aspect as to why the State Government had remained \n\n inactive and as to how it has issued orders of appointment of the applicants immediately \n\n after the date of promotion of the in-service candidates. Sum and substance is to allege \n\n that the deferred issuance of appointment orders to them has been malafide, with a view \n\n to favour the promotee candidates. The applicants contend that regularization of \n\n promotion of the departmental candidates had not taken place. Placing the departmental \n\n promotee candidates over the direct recruits in the seniority list dated 7.6.1996 is grossly \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 19 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n improper and that though they sought redressal of their grievance regarding said \n\n \n seniority list under a representation dated 15.1.1999, yet there has been no response. \n\n 12. The respondents-applicants claimed that there was no avenue available to those \n\n working in MDS Class I cadre till 1999. It is only in 1999 the government has given \n\n them opportunity of getting Selection Grade in MDS cadre and also promotional avenue \n\n \n in the form of Additional Chief Executive Officer and thus they have contended that \n\n creation of the cadre of Additional Chief Executive Officer shall have to be deemed to be \n\n a reckoning point for the applicants to ventilate their grievance about seniority as taking \n\n \n up such issue to judicial forum at other point of time would have generally been an \n \n academic exercise. The applicants this way justify their approach to the Tribunal \n\n questioning the seniority list dated 7.6.1996 and claimed that soon after declaration of \n \n policy of the State to provide opportunity of advancement to the candidates in MDS \n\n Class-I, they have agitated for correction in the seniority list and have requested the \n\n Tribunal to appreciate and consider their case favourably. The applicants allege that the \n \n\n promotee candidates were in excess of their quota. \n\n 13. Respondent No. 1 in its affidavit in reply dated 12.1.2001 has denied allegations \n\n of the applicants and has asserted that quota of direct recruits and promotees was and \n\n has been maintained according to the MDS rules. The objections against interim \n\n seniority list received, were considered properly and thereafter seniority list was \n\n finalized. It has been submitted that interim seniority list had been prepared on \n\n 2.8.1995 and after inviting and considering objections to the same, on 7.6.1996, \n\n seniority list has been finalized. It has been submitted that MDS Rules, 1973 have been \n\n made effective from July, 1981 and the MPSC had been requisitioned in 1984. \n\n Examination was held in 1985 and 14 and 16 candidates were appointed in 1986 and \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 20 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 1987 respectively through the Commission and as such, the respondent-authorities had \n\n \n fulfilled the quota of direct recruits. It has been specifically denied that the departmental \n\n candidates had been promoted against the nomination quota. The Rural Development \n\n \n Department had prepared seniority list according to the relevant rules and ratio of direct \n\n recruits and promotees had been maintained in accordance with the rules. It has been \n\n \n denied that the seniority list of the candidates of MDS Group-A requires any alteration. \n\n In support of said contention, reliance has been placed by Respondent No. 1 on various \n\n documents annexed to the reply, including MDS Rules, 1973 and amendments thereto \n\n \n from time to time.\n\n 14. \n \n The applicants had filed rejoinder on 13.2.2001 to the affidavit in reply \n\n submitted by Respondent No.1 and expressed their inability to give definitive figures of \n \n various posts in MDS Class-I cadre and tried to reason that out on various counts. It has \n\n been contended that since Class-I posts were en-bloc converted into Class-II and some of \n\n the Class-II posts had been up-graded as Class-I posts, referring to that about 200 posts \n \n\n of Child Development Programme Officer (CDPO) which were earlier Class I had been \n \n\n converted into Class II. According to them, certain number of posts had been increased \n\n and altogether new posts were created like Assistant Commissioner, Additional Chief \n\n Officer of Zilla Parishad and also submitted that in the absence of exact figures, effective \n\n adjudication of the issue would be difficult. It is further submitted that strength of the \n\n MDS Class-I cadre is about 397 or thereabout throughout the State. Till rejoinder, the \n\n posts of Assistant Commissioner from said cadre had been increased from 6 to 18 and \n\n the posts of Block Development Officer Class-I which were 32 had been increased to 202 \n\n and about 150 posts of CDPOs had been abolished by shifting them as Block \n\n Development Officer Class-II with conversion of CDPOs to MDS Class II from Class I \n\n cadre. According to the applicants, there were only 93 direct recruits among 397 posts \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 21 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n which is far too below the requirement of 50 per cent under the quota rule since \n\n \n 1.4.1982 and claimed a backlog of 105 posts of direct recruits. The applicants purport \n\n to dispute the date of application of rules as of 1979. The applicants have also contended \n\n \n that the objection to seniority list is a different issue altogether and does not have nexus \n\n to the controversy involved in Original Application No. 256 of 2000 and thus questioned \n\n \n importance being given to the issue of not availing an opportunity to object to the \n\n seniority list. The applicants further went on to submit that though the issues are inter-\n\n mixed, those are, in fact, independent of each other. It has been submitted that \n\n \n maintenance of quota can be considered independently from seniority. It has been \n\n contended that promotions in favour of the concerned respondents-departmental \n \n candidates had been temporary and by way of stop gap arrangement and relying upon \n \n judicial pronouncements of the Apex Court and the Tribunal further contended that \n\n promotions of the departmental candidates are fortuitous and apprehended that their \n\n long tenure would be legitimized. The applicants purport to claim that in their objections \n \n\n to the seniority list they had relied on Sanjay Thakre's case decided by the Tribunal and \n\n referred to that challenge to said decision of the Tribunal before the Apex Court had \n \n\n been unsuccessful. \n\n 15. An additional affidavit has been filed by Respondents No. 1 to 3 on 7.3.2001 to \n\n the rejoinder of the applicants, objecting to Original Application No. 256 of 2000 on \n\n various grounds, inter alia, that the same is barred by limitation, is misconceived, is not \n\n tenable, is on fancied cause of action, is stale, fixation of seniority and change in postings \n\n cannot be allowed after more than 12 years, etc. It has been contended that the original \n\n application has been filed far beyond expiry of period of one year from accrual of cause of \n\n action as per \nSection 21\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 and that too has been \n\n filed without any application for condonation of delay. It has further been submitted \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 22 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n that there is no compliance of requirement under \nsection 20\n of said Act, namely, making \n\n \n an appeal and in the absence of provision of appeal, a representation. According to the \n\n respondents, even though promotions have been given in 1989, no appeals had been \n\n \n filed then and even if it is considered that the applicants were aggrieved by fixation of \n\n seniority as on 7.6.1996, neither representation nor appeal has been filed within the \n\n \n stipulated period under said Act and the representation dated 15.1.1999 cannot be \n\n entertained as the same is not permissible. It has been submitted that applicants who \n\n have failed to avail of opportunity to object to seniority list at appropriate occasion, are \n\n \n now precluded from questioning the same. It has been submitted that permanent cadre \n\n is comprised of 54 permanent posts and considering the fact that with the second batch \n \n of direct recruits being introduced their total number in the cadre is 31 which is more \n \n than 50 per cent of the strength of the permanent cadre and hence, the government \n\n ought not to have called for third batch of the applicants from MPSC. According to the \n\n respondents, even calling of new candidates in 1987 had been contrary to the \n \n\n recruitment rules. Said respondents have given a table in their additional affidavit, \n\n wherein they have referred to that permanent posts during 1981 to 1985 which were 54, \n \n\n and temporarily sanctioned were 41 and in 1987 out of 54 permanent posts, 31 had been \n\n occupied by direct recruits and in 1989 with appointments of applicants' batch the same \n\n had been increased to 71. According to the table, during the period 1980 to 1990, there \n\n had been increase in permanent posts from 54 to 95 and temporary posts from 41 to 155. \n\n The respondents contended that the applicants and others had been appointed by \n\n usurping the posts of promotees. According to them, quota is to be counted with \n\n reference to permanent posts and as such, no injustice has been caused to the applicants. \n\n 16. A further rejoinder came to be filed on behalf of the applicants through one Dr \n\n N.B. Gite, on 4.4.2002. In the further rejoinder, the figures of permanent posts referred \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 23 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n to by Respondents No. 1 to 3 in their additional affidavit have been sought to be disputed \n\n \n by the applicants . According to the applicants, even going by the calculations made by \n\n the respondents, there had been in all 285 incumbents working in MDS Class-I cadre out \n\n \n of which 56 were appointed by direct recruitment and the rest by promotion of \n\n departmental candidates. Deponent, however, has also stated that the promotee \n\n \n candidates are not only continued to be in the seniority list, but have also been bestowed \n\n upon further benefits by treating them to be integral part of MDS Class-I cadre. \n\n According to him, had some candidates been on deputation, then their names could not \n\n \n be included in the seniority list of MDS Class-I. The respondents as such would not be \n\n able to claim that some of the persons had been working on deputation. It has been \n \n alleged that such claims have been put-forth only with a view to deprive the direct \n \n recruits of their progress in service career and proper placement in the seniority list and \n\n giving correct proportion of quota rule. He purports to rely on a chart annexed to the \n\n further rejoinder and alleges that it falsifies the claim of respondent-authorities and that \n \n\n the authorities have avoided to furnish the correct and exact factual information to the \n\n applicants and requests for proper directions to the respondents to place on record \n \n\n factual data of MDS Class-I cadre. According to the chart annexed to the further \n\n rejoinder, there were in all 507 promotions as against which there had been only 87 \n\n direct recruitments upto 1999.\n\n 17. The applicants also filed additional affidavit in July, 2002, contending that \n\n requisitions to MPSC by respondents pre-suppose assessment of posts after proper \n\n calculation of requirement of direct recruits as well as promotees and as such, the reply \n\n filed by Respondents No.1 to 3 is unsustainable. It is submitted that there had been no \n\n reference to excess appointments of direct recruits in the first affidavit, as, according to \n\n the applicants, there had been no scope for such excess appointments and claimed that it \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 24 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n is not such a trivial thing as has been considered by the respondents. The additional \n\n \n affidavit gives stress on creation of 31 posts of Block Development Officers Class-I \n\n pursuant to provisions of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samities Act, \n\n \n 1961 and as such claims that such posts cannot be termed as temporary posts and have \n\n been wrongly so claimed by the respondents. According to the applicants, under MDS \n\n \n Rules, 1973, in all 75 posts were created, comprising 25 each, of Deputy Chief Executive \n\n Officer (General) and (Village Panchayat) and Planning Officers since there were only 25 \n\n districts in the State. However, now the situation has undergone a change and there are \n\n \n about 35 districts in the State, requiring one Deputy Chief Executive Officer each for \n\n General, Village Panchayat and Planning, therefore, at least 62 posts of the Deputy Chief \n \n Executive Officer are in existence, in addition to 10 posts of CDPO under Integrated Child \n \n Development Scheme most of which have been of permanent nature since 1981. The \n\n applicants claim that the stand taken by the respondents is inconceivable. The nature of \n\n work performed by the incumbents holding a post in cadre is permanent. According to \n \n\n them, in addition, four more posts of Assistant Commissioner were created during the \n\n period from 1977 to 1980 and there were about 152 posts of MDS Class I cadre of \n \n\n permanent nature. The applicants claim that there were about 235 posts in MDS Class I \n\n cadre for more than three years which ought to have been treated as permanent posts \n\n and have sought clarification from Respondents No. 1 to 3 on the same. \n\n 18. The applicants rely on the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) \n\n Rules 1982 regarding general principles of seniority and fortuitous appointments referred \n\n to thereunder and submit that ad-hoc/stop gap arrangement would not be required to be \n\n reckoned for the purpose of seniority unless the appointment is according to the rules \n\n and as such, quota under the rules has to be taken into consideration. The applicants \n\n further rely on definitions of `temporary post' and `permanent post' which respectively \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 25 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n mean a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned for a limited time and a post \n\n \n carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without time limit. According to the \n\n applicants, it is not open to the respondent-authorities to contend that there existed only \n\n \n 95 posts in MDS Class I cadre in 1987 and that from the same, only 54 were permanent \n\n and the rest were temporary. The applicants by referring to various government \n\n \n resolutions and circulars from 1967 onwards, issued from time to time, claimed that it \n\n has been the consistent policy of the government to convert temporary posts into \n\n permanent ones. It has been alleged that the government is not coming forth with \n\n \n sincere and bonafide stand with regard to exact number of posts in MDS Class I cadre. \n\n According to them, though the post of Integrated Child Development Officer Class-I \n \n forms integral part of MDS Class I cadre, the government is refusing to accept the same. \n\n The applicants tried to support their said claim by making reference to a 1997 \n\n notification issued by MPSC which, inter alia, refers to the ICDO Class-I cadre and such \n\n clubbing, according to the applicants, is sufficient indication of ICDO Class I forming \n \n\n integral part of MDS Class-I cadre. \n\n 19. The applicants have also claimed that there is a policy of the government since \n\n March 1970 that fifty per cent of the total posts in the cadre should be filled in by direct \n\n recruitment which is exemplary part of the government resolution dated 7.3.1996. \n\n According to the applicants, when the rules have occupied the field, the same will have to \n\n scrupulously followed. However, it is contended by the applicants that the provision for \n\n quota for direct recruits under the rules is being given a go-bye and that ad-hoc/stop gap \n\n promotions are not required to be considered for the purpose of counting seniority. \n\n According to the applicants, though as per the Government Resolution dated 29.8.1979, \n\n the posts of CDPO are temporary addition to MDS Class-I cadre, by passage of time and \n\n by virtue of various government resolutions, circulars and policy, those have acquired the \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 26 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n status of substantive posts on expiry of period of three years. According to the applicants, \n\n \n there is no substance in the objection/contention that the original applications are \n\n without joining necessary parties, as according a decision of the Apex Court, in case of \n\n \n dispute over a particular principle or rule, the State is the only necessary party.\n\n 20. An additional rejoinder affidavit has been filed on 12.8.2002 by respondents No. \n\n \n 1 to 3 contending inter alia, that applications are fishing and roving in nature, that \n\n rejoinder of applicants are vague and camouflage void and null claims by irrelevant \n\n contentions and allegations, that applicants have no locus to seek reliefs and have \n\n \n disputed alleged mandate of immediate appointments of direct recruits on selection by \n \n MPSC making reference to the past events, have stated that promotions have been \n\n through DPC, have denied correctness of information of applicants and have alleged \n \n that rejoinders of applicants are intended to create confusion and have disputed claims \n\n under the same.\n\n 21. It appears that extensive hearing had taken place before the learned Tribunal and, \n \n\n by judgment and order dated 22. 11.2002, the Division Bench of the Tribunal had \n\n allowed Original Application No.256 of 2000, directing Respondent No. 2 therein to \n\n prepare a fresh seniority list by strictly following quota rule and to give appropriate \n\n treatment to the direct recruits and promotees in their respective posts, with a further \n\n direction to prepare seniority list of each year during which appointments by nomination \n\n were made as on 1st January or 1st April of the respective year with meticulous \n\n identification of all the posts having attributes of permanency and to complete the \n\n exercise within a time-frame of six months. It was also declared that till preparation of \n\n revised seniority list, the existing seniority list shall continue to be merely working one \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 27 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n and benefits flowing therefrom, if any, shall remain fortuitous. It was held by the learned \n\n \n Tribunal that the promotion orders were issued hastily. \n\n 22. Writ Petition No.2055 of 2003 has been filed by Abdul Rauf Shaikh against \n\n aforesaid decision of the Tribunal, who has entered the government service by selection \n\n through MPSC in 1980 and served as District Inspector of Land Records and had been \n\n \n promoted as Block Development Officer Class II since 1983. He was thereafter promoted \n\n to MDS Class I cadre by notification in 1989 having considered by the departmental \n\n promotion committee. Rule had been issued in the said petition, on 15th July, 2003 \n\n \n with a direction to place the same with Writ Petition No. 2178 of 2003, which writ \n \n petition had been filed by government authorities impugning the very same order of the \n\n Tribunal dated 22nd November, 2002 in which also rule had been issued by this Court. \n\n However, this Court had made the seniority that will be fixed, subject to outcome of the \n\n writ petition.\n\n 23. Writ Petition No.3469 of 2003 has been filed by Ankush Bagate and others, \n \n\n seeking quashing of the judgment and order dated 22nd November, 2002 passed by the \n\n Tribunal, in which rule had been issued on 7th December, 2003. By an order dated \n\n 6.2.2004 it had been made clear that seniority list fixed shall be subject to outcome of the \n\n Writ Petition.\n\n 24. To the aforesaid order of the Tribunal, as well as further orders passed by it in the \n\n contempt proceedings and other applications, exception has been taken in the present \n\n batch of writ petitions. \n\n 25. The applicants in original application No. 256 of 2000 had filed Contempt \n\n Petition No. 89 of 2003 before the Tribunal, alleging non-compliance of order dated \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 28 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 22.11.2002 of the Tribunal directing preparation of fresh seniority list. In the Contempt \n\n \n Petition, an order came to be passed by the learned Tribunal on 28-04-2004. Under the \n\n order, the Tribunal purported to explain to the respondents implications of non \n\n \n compliance of its order in original applications purporting to give concrete example \n\n requiring proportionate apportionment between direct recruits and promotees and \n\n \n conversion of posts into permanent ones and directing preparation of revised seniority \n\n list, for the period 1984 to 1990 in the first instance, within a period of six weeks and \n\n submit the same to it.\n\n 26. It appears that after the order dated 28-04-2004 was passed by the Tribunal, the \n \n Respondent-State had filed Miscellaneous Application No. 219 of 2004 before the \n\n Tribunal seeking stay to proceedings of contempt petition No. 89 of 2003. One of the \n \n petitioners in Writ Petition No. 3469 of 2003, namely, Namdeo Malhari Raskar had filed \n\n Miscellaneous Application No.126 of 2004 for intervention in the contempt petition. The \n\n Tribunal rejected both the miscellaneous applications, observing that petitioners should \n \n\n file appropriate proceedings to challenge order dated 28-04-2004. \n\n 27. Aforesaid order in contempt proceedings and the orders passed in miscellaneous \n\n applications were challenged before this court in a batch of writ petitions bearing No. \n\n 4650, 4661 and 4663 of 2004. Under order dated 22-07-2004 passed in said group of \n\n petitions, this Court had directed the Tribunal to hear the application for stay of the \n\n contempt proceedings, irrespective of rejection of such application on the ground of \n\n locus in the contempt petition. While passing said order dated 22.7.2004, this \n\n Court was alive to the fact that while dealing with the contempt proceedings, the \n\n Tribunal had given directions explaining its earlier order in the original applications \n\n which were likely to affect the parties to the original application. This Court, therefore, \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 29 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n felt it necessary to direct the Tribunal to independently consider the applications of the \n\n \n petitioners therein including for relief of stay of the contempt proceedings. \n\n 28. Accordingly, petitioners in Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005 had filed review \n\n application No.11 of 2004 and petitioners in Writ Petition No. 4650 of 2004 had filed \n\n review application No. 12 of 2004 before the Tribunal. By its judgment and order dated \n\n \n 3.11.2004, the Tribunal dismissed both the review applications, holding that the order \n\n dated 28.4.2004 passed in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 which was under review \n\n was calrificatory in nature and further that the contempt petitioners did not insist on \n\n \n giving effect to implementation of directions/observations of the Tribunal in its order \n \n dated 28.4.2004 because of the statement made on behalf of the government-respondent \n\n No. 2 as the cause of discontent had ceased to subsist.\n\n 29. Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005 has been preferred by petitioners in Writ Petition \n\n 3469 of 2003, challenging the order passed by the Tribunal on 3rd November, 2004 in \n \n\n Review Applications No.11 and 12 of 2004, and to have set aside, order dated 28th \n \n\n April, 2004 in contempt petition. It appears that in the interregnum, the contempt \n\n petition had been disposed of under order dated 21.1.2006 and the seniority list of MDS \n\n Class I cadre had been been published on 21.11.2005. Thus, it was prayed under \n\n amendment to writ petition no.2466 of 2005 that those orders as well as the seniority list \n\n be quashed and set aside and that no promotion orders pursuant to the same be issued. \n\n In this petition, this court passed an order on 8.4.2005 issuing \"Rule\" and granting \n\n interim relief in terms of prayer clause \"B\" which runs as under:\n\n \"B. That, pending final disposal of this Writ Petition as and by way of interim \n relief, stay may be given to the effect and operation and implementation of the \n order dated 28th April 2004 and particularly to the seniority list which has been \n prepared in the light of the so called clarificatory order given by the Honourable \n Tribunal dated 28th April 2004 in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003.\"\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 30 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n This relief, however, was granted without precluding implementation of the order of the \n\n \n Tribunal dated 22.11.2002 expecting that the matter would be heard peremptorily on \n\n 6.9.2005. The petitioners have further referred to that one more Writ Petition No. 6451 \n\n \n of 2004 had been filed in the High Court wherein this Court had declined to interfere on \n\n the count that it was a follow up action. \n\n 30. Writ Petition No.2980 of 2005 has been filed by one Sahebrao Waghmare, \n\n impugning final seniority list published on 21.11.2005, by the Deputy Secretary, Rural \n\n and Water Conservation Department of Government of Maharashtra. \n\n 31.\n \n Writ Petition No. 4023 of 2007 has been preferred by the Petitioners, \n\n against order passed by the Tribunal in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 in Original \n \n Application No.256 of 2000 and the final seniority list dated 22nd November, 2005 \n\n published by the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department of Government \n\n of Maharashtra, and seeking a mandamus to the Government to prepare provisional and \n \n\n final seniority lists on the basis of the MDS Class I cadre, excluding schematic / ex-cadre \n \n\n posts.\n\n 32. In all the aforesaid Writ Petitions, \"rule\" has been issued. Save granting of interim \n\n relief in terms of prayer clause (B) in Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005, in other writ \n\n petitions grant of interim relief had not been considered, expecting to take up those for \n\n final hearing sooner and expeditiously. \n\n 33. It has been referred to that the Respondent-State had published a revised interim \n\n seniority list of MDS Class I cadre, which has prejudicially affected the petitioner-\n\n promotees. Some of the Petitioners have raised objection to said revised interim seniority \n\n list. It has been alleged that though the contempt petition had been pending, the seniority \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 31 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n list dated 28.10.2004 has been prepared as if it is in faithful compliance of the order of \n\n \n the Tribunal dated 22.11.2002. \n\n 34. The Petitioners contend that order dated 28.4.2004 in Contempt Petition No.89 \n\n of 2003 is in excess of the jurisdiction of the proceedings under contempt and that said \n\n order substantially modifies the basic order dated 22.11.2002 passed in Original \n\n \n Application No.256 of 2000. The Petitioners purport to claim that although the order of \n\n this Court in Writ Petition No.4650, 4661 and 4663 of 2004 had been pointed out to the \n\n Tribunal, yet the Tribunal had rejected the review applications. Having regard to \n\n \n aforesaid, according to the petitioners, they had been left with no alternative but to \n \n invoke powers and jurisdiction of this Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of \n\n India against series of orders passed by the Tribunal, including order dated 3.11.2004 \n \n and the seniority lists published on 28.10.2004 and 21.11.2005.\n\n 35. Petitioners with specific reference to MDS Rules, 1973 have contended that under \n \n\n sub-rule (4) of Rule 3 thereof, composition of the MDS Class-I cadre has been referred \n \n\n to and have also referred to that sub-rule 6 provides mechanism and/or procedure for \n\n alteration in the number of posts by inclusion or exclusion of post and categories. It \n\n has been contended that from MDS Class-I cadre posts, 25 posts of Planning Officers \n\n have been removed and transferred to Finance and Statistics Department of the State.\n\n 36. The petitioners have contended that the Tribunal had been in gross error in \n\n directing the Authorities under its order dated 28.4.2004 in contempt proceedings to take \n\n into account such posts which do not form part of MDS Class-I cadre, and further that \n\n 29 posts of Project Director (DRDA), 8 of Programme Officer (DPAP) 29 of Planning \n\n Officer, 4 of Regional Nutrition Officer and 4 of Child Development Officer cannot be part \n\n and parcel of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 32 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 37. The petitioners have alleged that the State has been in gross error in taking of \n\n \n fluctuating stands in the matter, as on one hand on affidavit it has been contended that \n\n aforesaid 231 posts do not form part of MDS Class-I cadre and quota rule was not \n\n \n applicable to those and has yet referred to those in the chart of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\n 38. The petitioners contend that the District Rural Development Authority is a \n\n \n corporate body under the provisions of the \nMaharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960\n \n\n and is an independent establishment separate from Government of Maharashtra. The \n\n posts of Programme Officer are created by orders of the Central Government for the \n\n \n purpose of Water Share Development Programme. The posts of Deputy Chief Executive \n \n Officer (Child Welfare) are creation of Women and Child Development Department of the \n\n State Government. Posts of Child Development Officer have been created pursuant to \n \n the directions given by the Central Government from 1971 to 1992. It is submitted that \n\n all the posts referred to herein above are schematic/project/programme posts, which \n\n have been given extension from year to year, and their financing is shared by the State \n \n\n and Central Governments. It has been submitted that schematic/project/programme \n \n\n posts are inherently temporary in nature and the posts cannot be accorded status of MDS \n\n Class-I cadre and has not been so accorded by any notification or order. Most of the \n\n aforesaid posts have lapsed during 1999-2000 and were not part of regular \n\n establishment or for that matter MDS Class-I cadre and as such quota rule would not be \n\n applicable to them. \n\n 39. As regards posts of Planning Officer, it is submitted that 29 posts of Planning \n\n Officer had been en-bloc transferred to the Finance and Statistic Department of \n\n Government of Maharashtra resulting in reduction of strength of Class I cadre.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 33 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 40. It was thus contended that the Tribunal has been in absolute error in issuing \n\n \n directions on 28.04.2004 referring it to as clarification in nature whereunder it had been \n\n directed to confirm 80 percent of posts and subsequently the rest of 20 percent. \n\n According to applicants, the State under the circumstances was compelled to take into \n\n consideration said posts although they never formed MDS Class-I cadre .\n\n 41. The petitioners have objected to exercise of powers by Tribunal and the manner \n\n in which the orders have been passed in contempt proceedings, which according to them \n\n modify the original order, without taking into account distinction between jurisdiction in \n\n \n contempt and that in review. It has been contended that though the Tribunal refers to \n \n order dated 28.4.2004 as \"order in nature of clarification\", the order, in fact modifies and \n\n reviews order dated 22.11.2002. \n\n 42. According to applicants, while the final orders of the Tribunal passed in original \n\n applications no. 254 and 256 of 2004 were sub judice before the High Court, there was \n \n\n no propriety in passing further orders concerning order dated 22.11.2002, especially \n \n\n when the High Court had seisin over the matter. It is submitted that the High Court \n\n had therefore passed order in respect of the Tribunal's orders in subsequent proceedings. \n\n It has been submitted that none of the situations warranted invocation of jurisdiction for \n\n contempt or review of the order dated 22.11.2002 passed by the Tribunal and as such \n\n the Tribunal has been in gross error in passing further orders. \n\n 43. In paragraph 27 of the Writ Petition, the petitioners have reproduced observations \n\n of the Tribunal in the order dated 28.4.2004. It would be worthwhile to refer to those \n\n which are as under:\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 34 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n \"27. Shri Jagtap-Under Secretary to the Government in the Rural Development \n and the Water Conservation Department Mantralaya, Mumbai is present in the \n\n \n Tribunal. He has been explained what actually, are implications of the final order. \n\n We have also given a concrete example, for the purpose of illustruction. For \n instance, if there are posts in the year 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989, as \n the case may be continuously for the period, in excess of three years 140 slots will \n go to the share of the appointees by the nomination and 140 slots will go to the \n\n \n promotees. Further for instance, if there are 100 posts, in existence over the \n period of time, continuously, 80 of those posts would need to be converted into \n the permanent post in the fourth year 16 more post to be converted into fifth year, \n three more post to be converted into sixth year and the remaining one post is to \n be converted in the seventh year. In the process all 100 posts would need to be \n\n \n converted into permanent post subject to all posts those being continuously in \n existence for the period of seven years.\" \n\n 44.\n \n The Petitioners contend that there is no such point discussed at all in the order \n\n passed in Original Application nor any such arguments were advanced which is borne out \n \n from the original order of the Tribunal dated 22.11.2002. According to the petitioners, \n\n there is no question of clarification as has been stated by the Tribunal and as such even \n \n\n assuming the same for the sake of arguments, advisory role was not warranted, for, \n\n according to them, it is an otiose act as purported clarification is about a non subsisting \n \n\n thing. \n\n 45. According to the petitioners, afore-quoted paragraph proceeds on assumption \n\n that there is a government resolution according to which permanency can be granted to a \n\n temporary post on expiry of certain number of years, whereas the factual position is \n\n different. The petitioners contend that by giving directions as quoted above, there has \n\n been gross transgression of power by the Tribunal and, according to them, same \n\n amounts to assumption of jurisdiction for review in contempt proceedings which is illegal \n\n and untenable. The Tribunal could not make short work of the same by terming it to be \n\n clarification, instead of modification. According to the petitioners, the Tribunal had been \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 35 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n in absolute error since this point had been specifically raised and yet it had not been \n\n \n discussed. \n\n 46. The petitioners contend that in the absence of identification of posts having \n\n attributes of permanency as directed under paragraph 32 of the original order dated \n\n 22.11.2002, further exercise has been futile and plainly bad in law and illegal.\n\n 47. Making a reference to the data considered by the Tribunal in its original order, \n\n \n it is submitted by the petitioners that it was imperative to have considered the total \n \n strength of the MDS Class I cadre only as contained in MDS rules. \n\n 48. According to the petitioners, there has been mutual incompatibility in the \n \n observations in the original order passed on 22.11.2002 and those on 28.4.2004, for, in \n\n paragraph 32 of the original order, it has been stated that paragraph 9 of the said order \n \n\n should be read in paragraph 32 which, according to the petitioners, is by way of \n \n\n discussion and it does not form part of the operative order, while in the order dated \n\n 28.4.2004, the Tribunal observes that whatever has been stated in the body of the order \n\n amounts to mandatory directions whether it be expressed in the operative part of the \n\n order or otherwise. According to the petitioners, in such a case, the directions contained \n\n in paragraph 32 were redundant. According to them, even if it is assumed that the order \n\n dated 28.4.2004 has its genesis in the Government Resolution dated 7.3.1996, said \n\n resolution, however, applies to temporary occupancies beyond the period of three years \n\n in respect of the posts which are on permanent establishment and corollary of the same is \n\n that the government resolution would not help the posts on temporary establishment\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 36 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n and the State has given year wise total strength of MDS Class I cadre Officers working on \n\n \n various posts in the affidavit in reply.\n\n 49. The petitioners contend that the order dated 28.4.2004 causes enlargement of \n\n scope of observations under paragraph 9 of the order dated 22.11.2002 and the same is \n\n in modification not only of the original order but even the Government Resolution dated \n\n \n 7.3.1996 which relates and confines only to the posts on permanent establishment \n\n inasmuch as the order dated 28.4.2004 directs application of said Government Resolution \n\n \n to the posts not on the permanent establishment.\n\n 50.\n \n The petitioners intend to submit that in terming order dated 28.4.2004, \n\n as clarificatory, the Tribunal is under misconception and is absolutely a \n \n misnomer. \n\n 51. The petitioners have submitted that the Tribunal has committed error in \n \n\n approving the seniority list dated 21.11.2005 of MDS Group A, considering the same to \n\n be in conformity with the order passed by this Court in Civil Application No.7793 of \n \n\n 2005 in Writ Petition No.2466 of 2005, absolutely without considering that the interim \n\n relief in terms of prayer clause (B) granted by this Court was to the operation and \n\n implementation of the order dated 28.4.2004 since said seniority list has been prepared \n\n pursuant to order dated 28.4.2004 in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 and without \n\n realizing that this Court had not stalled the original order of the Tribunal dated \n\n 22.11.2002 in Original Applications No. 254 and 256 of 2000.\n\n 52. The petitioners submit that the Tribunal, in fact, defies the order of the High \n\n Court dated 08.04.2005 and ignores the effect of the order of this Court which has \n\n stayed effect, implementation and operation of the order passed by the Tribunal on \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 37 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 28.04.2004 in Contempt Petition No. 89 of 2003. According to the petitioners, \n\n \n the seniority list dated 21.11.2005 approval to which was purportedly granted by the \n\n Tribunal is practically the same as prepared on 28.10.2004. The petitioners have \n\n \n alleged that the Government has committed an error in inclusion of posts which were \n\n down graded, discontinued or transferred to other departments from the cadre of MDS \n\n \n Class-I group A. The petitioners have alleged that the Tribunal while approving the \n\n seniority list of MDS Group A dated 21.11.2005 for application of quota rule has ignored \n\n the recruitment rules and the directions issued by this Court. According to the \n\n \n petitioners, order dated 21.01.2006 of the Tribunal in Contempt Petition No. 89 of \n\n 2003 is contrary to the rules and directions of this Court. The petitioners submit that \n \n grave prejudice would be caused to them in implementation of aforesaid seniority list and \n \n not only that their position would be affected but also their pay scales would face \n\n downward motion. According to the petitioners, there has been no proper \n\n implementation of the original order of the tribunal dated 22.11.2002 and the \n \n\n Government has not yet taken any decision and as such, the directions of the Tribunal \n\n cannot be implemented and further that the directions, on factually incorrect \n \n\n assumption of a government resolution when there is no such one, are unsustainable.\n\n 53. In original applications No. 254 and 256 of 2010 the Tribunal appears to have \n\n considered that the question involved in the matter is of inter-se seniority between the \n\n direct recruits and promotees and application of quota rule (MDS Rules, 1973). It \n\n appears, the Tribunal purported to take into account historical background in creation \n\n of MDS.\n\n 54. According to the Tribunal, strength of class-I officers had been 110 and aforesaid \n\n were permanent posts, whether notified or otherwise. The Tribunal further purports to \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 38 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n say that the posts of Deputy Chief Executive Officers and Block Development Officers are \n\n \n statutory posts, being Secretaries to the Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis \n\n respectively in terms of the Maharashtra Zill Parishads and Panchayat Samities Act, 1961 \n\n \n and, therefore, cannot be said to have been sanctioned for a limited period of time and \n\n went on to observe that these posts are permanent posts, irrespective of whether any \n\n \n notifications making them permanent were issued or otherwise.\n\n 55. The Tribunal has purported to refer to meaning and definition of a few terms and \n\n expressions from Rule 9 of MCS (General Conditions of Service) Rules 1981, viz. \"cadre\" \n\n to mean a group of permanent as well as temporary posts, sanctioned from time to time, \n \n of a service or a part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. Then \"permanent post\" \n\n which is to mean a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of time, \n \n and \"temporary post\" meaning a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned for a \n\n limited time. Thereafter, the Tribunal has also referred to rule 3 of the Maharashtra Civil \n\n Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1982 and expressions thereunder, viz. \"direct \n \n\n recruit\" meaning in relation to any post, cadre or service, a person appointed by \n \n\n nomination, so also term \"fortuitous appointment\" meaning a temporary appointment \n\n made pending a regular appointment in accordance with the provisions of the relevant \n\n recruitment rules, as also \"promotee: which means, in relation to any post, cadre or \n\n service, a Government servant appointed thereto by promotion from a lower post, cadre \n\n or service. The Tribunal has also referred to Rule 4(1) of said Seniority Rules which \n\n speaks of seniority of a government servant in relation to any post, cadre or service being \n\n ordinarily determined on the length of his continuous service therein and further that \n\n service rendered under \"fortuitous appointment\" shall be excluded from computation of \n\n length of service and the incumbent shall be deemed to have been appointed from the \n\n date on which his regular appointment is made in accordance with relevant rules.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 39 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 56. The Tribunal clarifies that the events/developments narrated in paragraphs 3 and \n\n \n 4 of its judgment are for the period prior to the formation of Maharashtra Development \n\n Service and found that it is only in 1973 that the Maharashtra Development Service \n\n \n (Constitution, classification and recruitment) Rules 1973 have been framed for Zilla \n\n Parishads and that as per rules 3(2) and 3(4) of the Rules, the Development Service shall \n\n \n consist of classes, namely, \n\n (a) Maharashtra Development Service Class I (super time scale)\n\n (b) Maharashtra Development Service Class I, and \n\n \n\n (c) Maharashtra Development Service Class II.\n\n It has been noted by the Tribunal that as per sub rule (4) of Rule 3, the MDS Class I \n \n shall consist following posts:- \n\n (a) 25 posts of Deputy Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Parishads\n\n (b) 25 posts of Administrative Officers of Zilla Parishads\n \n\n (c) 25 posts of Planning Officers of Zilla Parishads and\n \n\n (d) 31 posts of Block Development Officers (Higher Grade) of Zilla Parishads.\n\n 57. According to the Tribunal, however, there is omission to add four posts of \n\n Assistant Commissioner (Development) under oversight and/or inadvertence in their \n\n inclusion in aforesaid Class I service and purported to hold that said four posts continue \n\n to to be MDS Class I. According to the Tribunal, the omission underwent corrective \n\n action from 1980. The Tribunal has then referred to that there has been transfer of 25 \n\n posts of Planning Officer from MDS Class I to Maharashtra Economics and Statistical \n\n Service Class I under the Directorate of Economics and Statistics. \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 40 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 58. Thereafter the Tribunal observes that around 1985, 25 posts of District Rural \n\n \n Development Agencies (DRDA)came into existence under \nSocieties Registration Act\n and \n\n under memorandum/Articles of Association, 25 posts of Project Director (i.e. Project \n\n \n Officers as were earlier termed) DRDA came into existence without prescription of time \n\n limit and according to the Tribunal, those posts too were manned by MDS Class I Officers \n\n \n irrespective whether those posts were notified as permanent or otherwise. The Tribunal \n\n then vaguely referred to that these posts acquired status of statutory posts that is to say \n\n permanent posts.\n\n 59. The Tribunal has then referred to Rule 5 of 1973 Rules and has purportedly \n \n considered that there were only two modes provided for recruitment/appointment in \n\n MDS Class I viz. (i) by promotion from among members of MDS Class II or by temporary \n \n transfer of Officers from Class I Service of the State.\n\n 60. Thereafter, the Tribunal refers to rule 7 of the 1973 Rules regarding absorption \n \n\n of certain officers. Sub rule (2) of Rule 7 specifically provides that, for the category of \n \n\n officers to be so absorbed, only 25 per cent posts in MDS Class I shall be reserved. \n\n 61. The Tribunal relies, on a government notification dated 11.7.1974 issued by Rural \n\n Development Department whereunder the government had declared a few posts \n\n involving duties comparable in importance and responsibilities attached to those in MDS \n\n Class I and on amended rule 5 referring to that appointment in MDS Class I would now \n\n be from three sources, namely, (i) nomination, (ii) promotion and (iii) transfer of officer. \n\n 62. The Tribunal, in paragraph 13 of its judgment, has observed that the respondents \n\n had specifically stated that these rules came into effect from 20.7.1981 and further that \n\n the same has little relevance to the decision on controversy involved in the matter. \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 41 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n According to the Tribunal, the amendments came into effect from 1.4.1979 and has \n\n \n further observed to that the proviso to the rule creates a first impression that the ratio \n\n with regard to quota of direct recruits and that of promotees is variable from 1.4.1982 i.e. \n\n 35 to 50 for direct recruits and 65 to 50 for promotees. According to the Tribunal, \n\n \n however, this was a result of \"clumsy articulation\" and, in fact, according to the Tribunal, \n\n \" the intent obviously was to transit from the minimum level to the maximum level in a \n\n phased manner after the minimum level was achieved by 1st April 1982.''\n\n \n\n 63.\n \n The Tribunal purports to say that the proviso will have to be read in harmony \n\n with the government circular of General Administration Department dated 26.3.1970 \n \n which, according to the Tribunal, as the Administrative Reorganization Committee had \n\n recommended to maintain proper balance between direct recruitment and promotion \n\n to posts in Class I Service and to raise direct recruitment to 50 per cent and accordingly \n \n\n to review the existing ratio, necessarily implies and mandates that, existing proviso \n \n\n ought to conform to the recommendations, therefore, the proviso ought to have been \n\n better articulated. The proviso as subsisting is as under:\n\n \" Provided that, appointment by nomination shall be made with effect from the 1st \n April 1979 or thereafter in such phased mannere as would ensure that the total \n number of officers directly recruited in Maharashtra Development Service, Class I, \n\n shall not at any time after the 1st April 1982, be less than 35 per cent and more \n than 50 per cent of the total number of posts in that cadre; or, \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 42 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 64. The Tribunal considered that instead of the existing one, the proviso shall be as \n\n \n suggested and drafted by the Tribunal in paragraph 22 of its order dated 22.11.2002. \n\n The text of proviso given by Tribunal is as hereinbelow.\n\n \" Provided that, appointment by nomination shall be made with \n effect form the 1st April, 1979 or there after in such phased \n manner as would ensure that the total number of officers directly \n\n \n recruited in Maharashtra Development Service, Class-I,shall not at \n any time after the 1st April, 1982, be less than35 percent of the \n total number of posts in that cadre, so however, that once the \n\n \n number of officers appointed by nomination reaches the level of 50 \n percent on or before the 1st April, 1985 that level at 50 percent \n \n shall be maintained thereafter\"\n\n 65. The Tribunal, therefore, went on to observe that on harmonious interpretation of \n\n relevant material, it has to be said that the ratio prescribed is not flexible/variable, but \n\n once minimum level transits to maximum level at 50 per cent the ratio between direct \n \n\n recruits and promotees shall stand fixed at 50:50. The Tribunal has held, Administrative \n \n\n Reforms Committee's recommendation no longer remains a mere recommendation. The \n\n government having accepted that recommendation, it stands transformed into a \n\n government decision. \n\n 66. The Tribunal has referred to requisitions and appointments year-wise from 1984 \n\n to 1989 in paragraph 16 of its order and had purportedly summed them up in a tabular \n\n form. The Tribunal, however, in the process has made a light work of the information \n\n and statistics submitted by the concerned respondents about there being no breach of \n\n quota rule and that there was no quota or vacant slot available within the quota of direct \n\n recruits by saying that there were lot of accounting errors in identifying the permanent \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 43 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n posts and \"also the posts which have attributes of permanent posts\". The Tribunal \n\n \n presumed that unless there were slots available for direct recruits there could not have \n\n been requisitions to the MPSC for recommendation of the candidates and according to \n\n \n the Tribunal, the respondents are estopped from contending that no slots were/are \n\n available for the direct recruits within their quota and the stand taken by the \n\n \n respondents, amounts to Government acting in an irresponsible manner. The Tribunal \n\n went on to observe that no relevant record had been produced as had been required. In \n\n the opinion of the Tribunal, the respondents were naive enough to believe that they can \n\n \n throw dust in the eyes of the Tribunal by presenting unsustainable statistics. \n\n 67. The Tribunal in paragraphs 24 to 30 of its order has discussed the case law cited \n\n on either side and in paragraph 31 , purported to hold that that the quota rule having \n \n not been maintained, there is continuing cause of action, though the final seniority list \n\n had been published way back in 1996 and that though quota rule has reflection on \n\n seniority, it is also an independent and substantive subject in itself and, therefore, bar of \n \n\n limitation under \nSection 21\n of the Administrative Tribunals Act cannot be attracted. The \n \n\n Tribunal, however, further stated that \" The text of the promotion order cries out loudly \n\n and clearly that it was issued in an ugly and unholy haste. No magnifying glass is needed \n\n to discern this \" .\n\n It would be appropriate to refer to the textual contents of paragraphs no. 32 and 33 \n\n of the order dated 22.11.2002 passed by the Tribunal.\n\n \"32 . In the forestalled circumstances the original Application no. 256 /2000 has to \n succeed. In point of fact, this case is on all fours with V. P. Shrivasava Vs. State of \n M.P.(AIR-1996-SCW-946). The respondent no.2 will, therefore, have to be directed \n to prepare fresh seniority lists strictly following the quota rule and by giving \n appropriate fitment both to the direct recruits and promotees within their respective \n quota. Such seniority lists will have to be prepared for each of the year during which \n appointment by nomination were made, as on the 1st January or 1st April of the \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 44 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n respective year as the practice may be. Such an exercise, including meticulous \n identification of all the posts having the attributes of permanent posts, will have to be \n\n \n carried out and completed within a given time frame of six months from receipt of a \n copy of this order. We direct the respondent no.2 accordingly. Till such fresh \n seniority list/lists are prepared the existing seniority lists shall be continue to be \n\n \n merely working seniority lists and the benefits flowing thereform, if any, shall \n remain fortuitous.\n\n 33. Once Original Application No. 256/2000 is decided in favour of the petitioners, \n it is inconsequential and immaterial, whether the promotee officers had indeed been \n\n \n pushed ahead. The strict implementation of the quota rule will take in its stride \n corrective action to set right such distortions if any. If they were not within their quot \n they will be pushed down. We have, however to observe that both the proposals were \n in the pipeline around the same time. We had required the respondent no.2 to \n produce the original record. However, the original record relating to promotion of \n\n \n promotee officers from MDS Class-II to MDS Class-I has not been produced in spite of \n repeated opportunities. An inference is, therefore, inescapable that there must be \n \n substance in the allegation. The text of the promotion order itself cries out loudly and \n clearly that it was issued in any ugly and unholy baste. No magnifying glass is \n needed to discern this. Ten Officers were promoted by the said order. The sentence \n below the order states that the detailed posting orders in respect of the rest of the \n \n officers other than Bagate and Shinde will be issued separately. The next sentence \n states that the detailed positing orders in respect of of Bagate and Shinde will be \n issued separately. If the detailed posting orders in respect of all the ten officers were \n to follow what was the pressing urgency in issuing promotion orders without postings \n has only to be imagined. We, have however, refrained from adjudicating this \n \n\n position. The said petition has stood rendered infructuous. \"\n\n It appears that Writ Petition No.2178 of 2003 filed by the State Government for quashing \n\n and setting aside the order of the Tribunal dated 22.11.2002 has been disposed of on \n\n 17.1.2012 on the statement made on behalf of the State Government that it would \n\n maintain 50 per cent quota each of direct recruits and promotees.\n\n 68. Learned Counsel appearing on either side advancing cause of promotees and of \n\n direct recruits have tried to buttress their submissions on the basis of various citations \n\n referred to and relied on by them.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 45 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 69. Mr. Anturkar and other learned Counsel supporting him on behalf of the petitioners \n\n \n have referred to and relied on following citations. \n\n 70. The first citation relied on by the Petitioners is V.B. Badami vs. State of Mysore \n\n AIR 1980 SC 1561, which was a case in respect of Karnataka Administrative Service \n\n (Recruitment) Rules 1957. Referring to said case, it is submitted that the Supreme Court \n\n \n has ruled that while working out quota rule between direct recruits and promotees, the \n\n general principles followed are where rules prescribe quota between direct recruits and \n\n promotees, confirmation or substantive appointment can only be in respect of clear \n\n \n vacancies in the permanent strength of the cadre. Secondly, confirmed persons are to be \n \n senior to those who are officiating and thirdly, as between persons appointed in \n\n officiating capacity, seniority is to be counted on the length of continuous service and \n \n fourthly, direct recruitment is possible only by competitive examination which is the \n\n prescribed procedure under the rules. It has further been ruled by the Supreme Court \n\n that there cannot be exchange of posts under the quota rules between direct recruits and \n \n\n promotees and vice versa. \n\n \n71. The other citation is the case of \nSonal Shimappa vs. State of Karnataka\n & ors., \n\n 1987 DGLS (Soft) 960 = 1987 AIR (SC) 2359 wherein the case of V.B. Badami \n\n \nreferred to above\n has been followed.\n\n 72. Petitioners further relied on A.R. Sircar vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1992 DGLS \n\n (Soft) 437=1993 (Supp.2) SCC 734, to support their case on de-facto doctrine. It has \n\n been held that the de-facto doctrine requires that, evenwhere an an act is declared ultra \n\n vires but prior to such declaration some act or decision was taken bonafide in accordance \n\n with the rules and provisions of the Act, such decision taken would be saved by de-facto \n\n doctrine. The Supreme Court was dealing with the U.P. State College Medical Teachers \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 46 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n Service Rules framed under Gandhi Memorial and Associated Hospital (Taking Over) Act, \n\n \n 1983. According to the petitioners, in the present case, factual situation is somewhat \n\n similar, as it has to be considered that the State Government had prepared a provisional \n\n \n list in 1995 wherein they were shown to be senior to the concerned respondents and \n\n final seniority list had been issued in 1996 wherein also the petitioners were senior to \n\n \n the concerned respondents and, therefore, contended that subsequent disturbance by the \n\n Tribunal should not affect the bonafide decision taken by the State Government having \n\n regard to the de-facto doctrine. \n\n 73. \nIn \nRana R. Singh vs. State of UP\n, 1989 SC 218= 1989 SCC Supp.1 615, again \n \n the issue was regarding seniority as between the direct recruits and promotees governed \n\n by Uttar Pradesh Police Service Rules, 1942 framed under \nSection 241\n of the Government \n \n of India Act, 1935. The Supreme Court had refrained from passing an order which would \n\n have resulted in re-opening the question of seniority causing serious prejudice to many \n\n officers and since many officers had obtained further promotions and few were retired \n \n\n and some officers were not before the court. Therefore, without disturbing the situation, \n \n\n it was directed that a seniority be refixed on the basis of the Rules from 1981 onwards \n\n and quota rule be applied.\n\n \n74. A Constitution Bench of the Apex Court, in \nDirect Recruit Class II Engineering \n\n Officers Association vs. State of Maharashtra\n, reported in 1990 AIR \n\n (SC)-0-1607=1990 SCC (2) 715, was once again dealing with rivalry for seniority in \n\n service between the direct recruits and the promotees. It would be appropriate to \n\n reproduce here paragraphs 11 and 13 of said judgment:-\n\n 11. Although the claim of the promotees to reckon the seniority according to the \n continuous officiation was accepted by this Court in Patwardhan's case in 1977, \n the State Government continued denying them the fruits of the litigation. The \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 47 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n High Court on a complaint made by Bagayat Patil, took note of the delay and \n issued directions for implementation of the judgment. Still nothing was done till \n\n \n 1984 and an application for starting proceedings in contempt was made before \n the High Court. In the meantime a fresh writ petition being W.P. No. 660 of 1984 \n was filed by the direct recruits before the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay \n\n \n High Court and stay was obtained. Thereafter a number of similar applications \n were filed one after another, either before the Nagpur Bench or the Aurangabad \n Bench of the Bombay High Court. When the promotees pointed out before this \n Court the game of the direct recruits, a direction was issued for hearing of all the \n cases at Bombay. Accordingly, all the 15 writ applications were transferred and \n\n \n heard together at Bombay. The High Court rejected the case of the direct recruits \n and dismissed the writ petitions. The petitioners in 9 of them have challenged the \n judgment in Civil Appeals No. 194-202 of 1986.\n\n 13. When the cases were taken up for hearing before us, it was faintly suggested \n\n \n that the principle laid down in Patwardhan's case (AIR 1977 SC 2051) was \n unsound and fit to be over-ruled, but no attempt was made to substantiate the \n plea. We were taken through the judgment by the learned counsel for the parties \n \n more than once and we are in complete agreement with the ratio decidendi, \n that the period of continuous officiation by a government servant, after his \n appointment by following the rules applicable for substantive appointments, has \n \n to be taken into account for determining his seniority; and seniority cannot be \n determined on the sole test of confirmation, for, as was pointed out, \n confirmation is one of the inglorious uncertainties of government services \n depending neither on efficiency of the incumbent nor on the availability of \n substantive vacancies. The principle for deciding inter se seniority has to conform \n \n\n to principles of equality spelt out by Arts. 14 and 16. If an appointment is made \n by way of stop-gap arrangement, without considering the claims of all the \n eligible available persons and without following the rules of appointment, the \n \n\n experience on such appointment cannot be equated with the experience of a \n regular appointee, because of the qualitative difference in the appointment. To \n equate the two would be to treat two unequals as equal which would violate the \n equality clause. But if the appointment is made after considering the claims of \n\n all eligible candidates and the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till \n the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules made for regular \n substantive appointments, there is no reason to exclude the officiating service for \n purpose of seniority. Same will be the position if the initial appointment itself is \n made in accordance with the rules applicable to substantive appointments as in \n the present case. To hold otherwise will be discriminatory and arbitrary. \nThis \n\n principle has been followed in innumerable cases and has been further \n elaborated by this Court in several judgments including those in \nBaleshwar Dass \n v. State of U.P. and others\n, [1981] 1 SCR 449 (AIR 1981 SC 41), and Delhi Water \n Supply and Sewage Disposal Committee and others v. R.K. Kashyap and others, \n (1989) Supp. 1 SCC 194 (AIR 1989 SC 278), with which we are in agreement.\n \nIn \n \nNarender Chadha and others v. Union of India and others\n, (1986) 1 SCR 211 \n (AIR 1986 SC 638), the officers were promoted although without following the \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 48 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n procedure prescribed under the rules, but they continuously worked for long \n periods of nearly 15-20 years on the posts without being reverted. The period of \n\n \n their continuous officiation was directed to be counted for seniority as it was \n held that any other view would be arbitrary and violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16.\n\n There is considerable force in this view also. We, therefore, confirm the \n\n \n principle of counting towards seniority the period of continuous officiation \n following an appointment made in accordance with the rules prescribed for \n regular substantive appointments in the service.\n\n The Supreme Court has summed up and held in paragraph 44 as under:-\n\n \"44. To sum up, we hold that:\n\n (A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority \n has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the \n\n \n date of his confirmation. The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial \n appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop-gap \n arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for \n \n considering the seniority.\n\n (B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure \nlaid down \n \n by\n the rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the \n regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules, the period of officiating \n service will be counted.\n\n (C) When appointments are made from more than one source, it is permissible \n \n\n to fix the ratio for recruitment from the different sources, and if rules are framed \n in this regard they must ordinarily be followed strictly.\n\n (D) If it becomes impossible to adhere to the existing quota rule, it should be \n substituted by an appropriate rule to meet the needs of the situation. In case, \n however, the quota rule is not followed continuously for a number of years \n because it was impossible to do so the inference is irresistible that the quota rule \n\n had broken down.\n\n (E) Where the quota rule has broken down and the appointments are made from \n one source in excess of the quota, but are made after following the procedure \n prescribed by the rules for the appointment, the appointees should not be \n pushed down below the appointees from the other source inducted in the \n\n service at a later date.\n\n (F) Where the rules permit the authorities to relax the provisions relating to the \n quota, ordinarily a presumption should be raised that there was such relaxation \n when there is a deviation from the quota rule.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 49 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n (G) The quota for recruitment from the different sources may be prescribed by \n executive instructions, if the rules are silent on the subject.\n\n (H) If the quota rule is prescribed by an executive instruction, and is not \n followed continuously for a number of years, the inference is that the executive \n\n \n instruction has ceased to remain operative.\n\n (I) The posts held by the permanent Deputy Engineers as well as the officiating \n Deputy Engineers under the State of Maharashtra belonged to the single cadre \n of Deputy Engineers.\n\n (J) The decision dealing with important questions concerning a particular service \n given after careful consideration should be respected rather than scrutinised for \n finding out any possible error. It is not in the interest of Service to unsettle a \n settled position. With respect to Writ Petition No. 1327 of 1982, we further hold:\n\n (K) That a dispute raised by an application under \nArt. 32\n of the Constitution must \n \n be held to be barred by principles of res judicata including the rule of \n constructive res judicata if the same has been earlier decided by a competent court \n by a judgment which became final.\n\n In view of the above and the other findings recorded earlier, we do not find \n any merit in any of the civil appeals, writ petitions and special leave petitions \n which are accordingly dismissed. There will be, however, no order as to costs. \n Order accordingly.\n\n \n75. The petitioners have also relied on \nKeshav Chandra Joshi vs. Union of India\n, \n \n\n 1990 DGLS (Soft) 638 = 1991 AIR (SC) 284, wherein it has been held that officiation \n\n by adhoc appointee would not be considered for computing seniority if the same is not \n\n according to the rules.\n\n \n76. Same principle has been reiterated in \nState of West Bengal vs. Aghore Nath Dey\n, \n\n 1993 DGLS (Soft) 324 = 1993 (3) SCC 371, that adhoc services cannot be upheld if \n\n same are in violation of rules.\n\n \n77. Similar ratio has been \nlaid down in\n \nState of Uttar Pradesh v. R.K. Tandon\n 1996 \n\n DGLS (Soft) 1096 = 1996 AIR (SC) 3505, so also in \nDinkar Anna Patil vs. State\n of \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 50 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n Maharashtra, 1999 AIR (SC) 152 =1999 SCC (1) 354, wherein in paragraph 20, it has \n\n \n been observed thus :\n\n \"20. The Tribunal upheld the contention raised on behalf of the Government of \n\n \n Maharashtra and the private respondents that the action of the appellants in \n challenging the seniority lists was belated one and the same deserved no \n consideration. This finding of the Tribunal, in our considered view, cannot be \n sustained. The seniority list prepared as on Ist April 1987 could not have been \n\n \n challenged by the appellants because at that point of time, they were not born in \n the cadre. But, however, the subsequent provisional list as on Ist January, 1991 \n which was published on 20th January, 1992, the appellants did make their \n representation against the same on 23rd September, 1992. Along with the said \n representation, they also annexed a copy of the judgment dated 2nd January, \n 1992 rendered by the Tribunal giving certain directions in respect of seniority list \n\n \n of Sales Tax Inspectors to be recast strictly in accordance with the quota rule as \n provided under the Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules. These Rules are \n \n similar to the Rules in question. The said representation was rejected and the list \n was finalised on Ist February, 1993. The third provisional seniority list as on Ist \n January, 1992 of Sales Tax Officers Class-I was published on 26th January, 1993 \n wherein quota rule was applied and the direct recruits of 1988 batch were placed \n \n above some 22 promotees who were shown in the earlier seniority list as senior to \n them. However, while preparing the final seniority list dated 29th December, \n 1993, the position as reflected in 1991 seniority list was again restored giving \n benefit of fortuitous service to the promotees and consequently, the appellants \n were shown below these promotees; The appellants did file their representation \n \n\n against the said seniority list on 30th March, 99 but, there was no response one \n way or the other from the Government of Maharashtra. Again, another provisional \n \n\n seniority list as on 1st January, 1993 was published on 13th June, 1994 and the \n said list was again prepared in violation of quota rule. It is true that the appellants \n did not file any representation against; this provisional seniority list because it was \n not in any way different than the one prepared on 29th December, 1993. Since, \n there was no purpose in filing further representation, the appellants approached \n\n the Tribunal for appropriate reliefs. Having regard to this background, we are of \n the firm opinion that the original petition of appellants could not have been \n branded as suffering from latches. The appellants did approach the Government of \n Maharashtra as well as the Tribunal vindicating their grievance as regards their \n placements in the seniority lists.\n\n \n78. The petitioners have relied on yet another decision of the Supreme Court in \n\n \nKeshav Chandra Joshi vs. Union of India\n, AIR 1991 SC 284=1992 SCC (Supp.1) 272, \n\n dealing with U. P. Forest Service Rules, 1952, giving rise to the dispute\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 51 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n regarding inter-se seniority between promotees and direct recruits. In paragraph 24 of the \n\n \n judgment, a reference has been made to the case of Direct Recruits' reported in 1990 \n\n (2) SCC 715 = AIR 1990 SC 1607, wherein it was held :\n\n \"(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority has \n\n \n to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of \n his confirmation. The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial \n appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as stop gap \n arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for \n considering the seniority.\n\n \n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure \nlaid down by\n \n the rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the \n regularization of his service in accordance with the rules, the period of officiating \n \n service will be counted.\"\n\n \n79. To support their contention, the petitioners have also relied on the case of \nA.N. \n \n\n Sehgal vs. Raje Ram Sheoran\n, 1991 AIR (SC) 1406 = 1992 SCC (Supp.1) 304.\n\n 80. On behalf of Respondents-direct recruits, Mr. Ajay Deshpande, learned Counsel \n\n has categorized the citations relied on by him in support of his submissions in three parts, \n\n viz. (i) limitation, (ii) consideration of temporary posts for application of quota rules and \n\n (iii) promotions not as per rules not to be taken into account for the purpose of seniority. \n\n \nOn limitation, he has referred to only one case \nM. Ramkotaiah and \n\n others vs. Union of India\n, 2007 AIR SCW 2204. In this case, the Supreme Court has \n\n ruled that regular appointment is relevant for computation of seniority and that on \n\n publication of new and valid seniority list, the old list stands superseded. Though the \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 52 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n citation is relied on for the purpose of \"limitation\", the case does not exactly deal with \n\n \n limitation. It appears to be the contention of the learned Counsel that it is \n\n implicit since it has been considered in the same that until publication of a new and \n\n \n valid seniority list, the old seniority list does not cease to operate. In the present case, \n\n seniority list has been finalized on 1.7.1996 and it is sought to be disputed long \n\n \n thereafter in 1999 and subsequently in original application. We do not think it \n\n appropriate to deal with the issue of limitation for it has been rendered of little \n\n significance in the present case.\n\n 81.\n \n In the citation A.K. Subraman & ors. vs. Union of India and ors. \n\n Reported in AIR 1975 SC 483, on the second point of \"consideration of temporary post \n \n for applying quota rule\", ratio appears to be that in the cases of appointments in \n\n accordance with rules, seniority of such appointees in service will be from the date of \n\n their initial officiating appointment, provided the same is within their quota and that the \n \n\n quota rule would be enforced at the time of initial recruitment in officiating capacity \n \n\n and would be applicable irrespective of permanent or temporary post. The ratio \nlaid \n\n down by\n the Supreme Court is in respect of Central Engineering Service Class I \n\n Recruitment Rules, 1954 which did not confine to promotee vacancies and/or specific \n\n number of posts. Similar does not appear to be the position in the present case which is \n\n governed MDS Rules. \n\n \n82. Another case relied on by learned Counsel for the respondents-applicants is \nD. \n\n Ganesh Rao Patnaik and others vs. State of Jharkhand and others\n, 2005 AIR SCW \n\n 5199, wherein the Apex Court has considered provisions of Bihar Superior Judicial \n\n Service Rules 1946, and particularly rule 6 thereof. The Supreme Court has ruled that \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 53 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n since the 'cadre' does not exclude consideration of temporary post, it would mean entire \n\n \n cadre without exclusion of temporary posts and in such a case, temporary and permanent \n\n posts would be taken into account and a promotee filling a post of direct recruit would \n\n \n not be able to claim seniority over the direct recruit.\n\n 83. \nIn \nFood\n Corporation of India vs. Thaneswar Kalita and others\n, 1995 AIR \n\n \n SCW 4659, the judgment proceeds on admitted position that the respondents were \n\n appointed on ad-hoc basis dehors the rules and, as such, it was considered that their \n\n continuance for a long time in promotional post would not be amenable to computation \n\n \n of seniority. The Supreme Court has disagreed with the directions of the High Court to \n \n treat entire service of the respondents therein to be on regular basis.\n\n 84. In yet another case, State of Maharashtra and anr. vs. Sanjay Thakre and \n\n ors. reported in 1995 Supp (2) SCC 407\n , the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed \n\n by the State as well as the promotees which dealt with the similar situation as in the \n \n\n previous citation and the Supreme Court ruled that any ad-hoc appointment or \n \n\n promotion dehors the rules would not be taken into account for computation of \n\n seniority. The Supreme Court observed, \"The State having made the rules, should \n\n implement them in letter and spirit; any justification for dereliction in implementation \n\n should not be countenanced; it should really be snubbed\".\n\n \n85. The next citation relied on by the respondents is \nM.S.L. Patil vs. State of \n\n Maharashtra\n, (1996) 11 SCC 361 which holds the same way as earlier citation that the \n\n persons promoted in excess of their quota are not entitled to count their length of service \n\n as promotees for the purpose of seniority and the same would be counted from the date \n\n of availability of their quota. These observations were with reference to the \n\n Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982. The Supreme Court \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 54 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n further stated that the general principle of law \nlaid down by\n it is applicable to every \n\n \n person including those who were not a party to that order.\n\n \n86. The other citation \nMadan Gopal Garg vs. State of Punjab and ors\n, 1996 AIR \n\n SCW 603, is in respect of Pubjab Good & Supplies Department (State Service Class II) \n\n Rules 1966. The Supreme Court while dealing with the promotion of the appellant from \n\n \n the post of Deputy Director to Controller involving 'inter se' seniority between direct \n\n recruit and promotee and held that a promotee cannot be given seniority over direct \n\n recruit on the basis only of his prior appointment.\n\n 87.\n \n \nIn \nMaharashtra Vikrikar Karmachari Sangathana v. State of Maharashtra\n \n\n and anr. 2000 AIR SCW 138, the seniority list as confirmed under the order of the court \n \n pursuant to litigation before the Tribunal, had been held to have been barred by \n\n constructive res-judicata and list of seniority prepared in violation of quota rule had not \n\n been approved irrespective of promotees remaining in office for seventeen years, \n \n\n ignoring date of selection of the appellant. Ratio has been with reference to \n \n\n Maharashtra Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules, 1971, finding that the State of \n\n Maharashtra had taken a definite stand that promotions in excess of quota were \n\n temporary, ad hoc and as a stop gap arrangement without reckoning the period of \n\n officiation by promotees for the purpose of fixing seniority.\n\n \n88. The next citation relied on by respondents-applicants is \nR.K. Mobisana Singh vs. \n\n Kh. Temba Singh\n and ors. 2008 AIR SCW 127 which lays down that retrospective \n\n regularization of ad-hoc appointees would confer other benefits to them, but same cannot \n\n be of any assistance in reckoning seniority with retrospective effect and on facts, it was \n\n held that since in some cases relevant procedure was not followed, question of their \n\n acquiring seniority over direct recruits does not arise.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n 55 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 89. \nIn yet another case, High Court of Judicature for \nRajasthan vs. Veena Verma\n \n\n \n and anr. 2009 AIR SCW 4685, the Supreme Court was dealing with altogether different \n\n set of facts. In the cited case, a mandate was sought which according to the original \n\n \n petitioner, was as per rules. The petitioner being 8th in the selected candidates and \n\n according to her as per rules vacancies for direct recruits being 10 and not 7, a mandate \n\n \n was sought for new appointment. Learned Single Judge had dismissed the writ petition, \n\n but the Division Bench had set aside the learned Single Judge's said order and directed \n\n the High Court to determine the number of vacancies and if the vacancies were more \n\n \n than seven, then consider petitioner Veena Verma for the post in Rajasthan Higher \n\n Judicial Service. The Supreme Court set aside the order of the Division Bench of \n \n Rajasthan High Court and restored the one passed by the learned Single Judge.\n\n 90. We quite see that in the present controversy, the MDS Rules, 1973 shall be at the \n\n core and would play a pivotal role for decision in the matter. From the MDS Rules,1973 \n\n and amendments thereto from time to time as have been placed on record, it emerges \n \n\n that the nomination channel for appointment to MDS Class-I cadre had been introduced \n \n\n by amendments to the rule.

It cannot be ignored that MDS class I cadre is a creature of MDS Rules, 1973 and \n\n the rules create specific number of MDS Class I cadre posts under sub rule 4 of Rule 3 \n \n\n and Rule 5 provides for recruitment to the same by nomination and promotion and also \n \n\n provides for interse proportion thereof and mechanism to bring about change in number \n\n of posts is referred to under sub rule 6 of Rule 3.\n\n 92. While it is nobody's case that there had occurred change to number of MDS Class I \n\n posts contained in the MDS Rules, 1973, it is also not the case of rival parties that the \n\n State Government by order in official Gazette has altered the number of MDS Class-I \n\n posts.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 65 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 93. The stand of the State Government in matter that quota of direct recruits being \n\n \n fulfilled cannot be lightly discarded and carries lot of credibility. Upon perusal of of rule \n\n that MDS Class-l comprised of 106 posts and with induction of applicants' batch of 40 the \n\n \n quota of direct recruits had been fulfilled. The applicants could not repel this position by \n\n convincingly dealing with the same with facts and figures though they tried to wrangle \n\n \n over it contending that the posts of project, programme, planning, regional nutrition, \n\n child development officers form part of MDS Class-I cadre and contending that cadre \n\n consists of much larger number. However, it will have to be observed that said contention \n\n \n is devoid of substance as said posts were never included MDS Class-l cadre by adopting \n \n the process referred to in sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of MDS Rules, 1973 nor those were \n\n considered to form part of the same by the State Government at any point of time. Said \n \n posts cannot be said to acquire that status under prolonged continuance unless and until \n\n the same is recognized and conferred by employing mechanism provided for bringing \n \n\n about the same as stipulated in the MDS Rules, 1973. Inclusion of said posts in MDS \n\n Class-l cadre is possible only through the mode of notification by the State Government in \n \n\n the official gazette not otherwise. The State Government has never accepted said posts as \n\n MDS Class-l cadre posts and have in no uncertain terms denied such claims time and \n\n again, repeatedly, in pleadings and on affidavits before the Tribunal and even by \n\n challenging the orders of Tribunal wherein directions are issued to consider those as such \n\n for quota and seniority. It has also to be considered that attributes of permanency of said \n\n posts or acquisition of permanent status by itself would not clothe the posts with the \n\n status of MDS Class-l cadre and would not be of any significance for birth in the said \n\n cadre and does not at all cause conversion to MDS Class-l cadre.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 66 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n\n 94. Perusal of the judgment and order of the Tribunal would reveal that the directions \n\n \n as given by the Tribunal are in total conflict with the rules governing the field. The \n\n Tribunal by the impugned order has purported to 're-enact' the rules under the garb of \n\n placing interpretation which, in our considered view, is not permissible in law.\n\n 95. The Government had very specifically stated that the ratio of direct recruits had \n\n been as per the quota rules and further that proportion of appointments of direct recruits \n\n \n has been in excess till 1990 specifically referring to figures of posts available in cadre \n \n and number of direct recruits in the same. Though applicants have tried to dispute the \n\n same, the situation cannot be ignored that there has been no increase or decrease in \n \n number of MDS Class-I cadre posts when the applicants were appointed. The applicants \n\n want to consider other posts to form MDS Class-l cadre which under law is not possible, \n\n without following the procedure contained in the MDS Rules, 1973. \n\n 96. There has been no declaration about there being any alteration, increasing or \n \n\n reducing number of MDS class-l cadre posts, as required under sub-rule 6 of Rule 3 of \n\n MDS Rules, 1973. Said MDS Rules of 1973 underwent various amendments from time \n\n to time, without alteration of the number of MDS Class-I cadre posts. The number of \n\n MDS Class-l cadre posts has not been touched by the amendments which have been \n\n placed on record by the authorities. Said position has not been disputed by applicants. \n\n The posts which the Tribunal has referred to as having attributes of permanency appear \n\n to be from pools out side MDS Class-I cadre. It appears that the creation of said posts had \n\n been with a specific purpose for implementation of schemes/programmes/projects under \n\n directions and orders of the Central/State Governments. \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 67 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 97. There had been no amalgamation of said posts with those in the MDS Class-I cadre \n\n \n at any point of time by following the procedure as prescribed and required under sub-\n\n rule 6 of rule 3 of MDS Rules of 1973. In absence of any such action by the Government \n\n \n for amendment or alteration to number of posts under the rules by amalgamation, the \n\n directions given by the Tribunal rewriting the rules are grossly ill-conceived. So long as \n\n \n the procedure for increase or decrease in number of Class-I cadre posts is not followed by \n\n State, such directions by the Tribunal would not be tenable.\n\n 98. Government Decision dated 07-03-1996 pressed into service by applicants has little \n \n efficacy in the present controversy and hardly has any application to the situation. The \n\n Government decision has been issued for application and maintenance of quota system \n \n where there are no rules, governing recruitments in government services. Perusal of the \n\n same would show that the stipulations thereunder would hold good wherever there are \n\n no provisions for quota system in the rules. Further, it provides for regular revisions and \n \n\n the conversion of temporary posts over three years into permanent, with the concurrence \n \n\n of finance department with view to facilitate maintaining proportion of quota. It also \n\n makes clear that the said Government decision would be applicable prospectively from \n\n 01-04-1996. In the present matter, no case has even been pleaded about conversion of \n\n posts, into permanent ones, taking place with the concurrence of finance department. It \n\n has also to be taken into account that application of said Government decision to the \n\n posts which the applicants want to be considered to be of MDS Class-I cadre has not been \n\n accepted by the respondent authorities. Having regard to aforesaid, it will have to be \n\n considered that Government Resolution hardly has any significance in present \n\n controversy and that apart the same would not cover the period before \n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 68 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 01-04-1996. As such, the directions with reference to the same issued by Tribunal in \n\n \n respect of period prior to 1996 would not be sustainable. The Tribunal has not dealt with \n\n said aspect of Government Resolution and altogether disregarded that it was operative \n\n \n from 01-04-1996.\n\n 99. It appears that without there being concrete material on record the Tribunal has \n\n inferred that there are lot of accounting errors in identifying permanent posts and that \n\n the respondents have proved that there were adequate slots available for direct recruits.\n\n 100. The position that clearly emerges is that pursuant to the rules and the position as \n\n stated in the affidavits in reply, the number of posts in MDS Class I cadre were 95 in \n \n 1988-89 comprising 54 permanent and 44 temporarily sanctioned. With the \n\n appointment of batch of 40 persons including the respondents-applicants, in 1990, \n\n position was that 71 posts were occupied and held by direct recruits. In fact, the \n \n\n authority had categorically submitted with figures indicating as stated by the \n \n\n respondents, the quota of appointments of the direct recruits had been fulfilled. The \n\n respondents-applicants had in clear terms expressed their inability to furnish \n\n proper/exact figures of the posts available for direct recruits in MDS Class I cadre. They \n\n were not in a position to discard the submission that the posts viz. Project Director \n\n (DRDA), Programme Officer, DPAP, Planning Officer, Regional Nutrition Officers and \n\n Child Development Officers which they have contended to form part of MDS Class I \n\n cadre, were not included in MDS Class I cadre or for that matter, there has been any \n\n government resolution in that respect. The respondents-applicants want that these posts \n\n should be deemed to be included in MDS Class I cadre in the absence of any notification\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 69 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n which, according to them, have attributes of permanent posts pursuant to the order of the \n\n \n Tribunal dated 22.11.2002 \n\n 101. In our considered view, the Tribunal has been in error in putting in a long arm, \n\n \n especially in the absence of any concrete material before it. The authorities which have \n\n been relied on by the respondents-applicants are of little help to them, having regard to \n\n the fact that the situation is occupied and governed by specific rules holding the field \n\n \n of operation and the respondents-applicants have to abide by the same from \n \n inception with their appointments. Quota rules and absence of observance of the same \n\n have been much harped about. However, the respondents-applicants have not been able \n \n to show as to how quota rule has not been followed, especially when they are not in a \n\n position to say that the posts which they want to be part of MDS Class I cadre had ever \n\n been amalgamated with MDS Class-I cadre by a notification under a government gazette \n \n\n as required by sub-rule 6 of Rule 3 of MDS Rules, 1973. The decision rendered by the \n \n\n Tribunal is on hypothetical basis, without any concrete material in support thereof, is \n\n based on assumptions and presumptions and surmises and conjectures. In our view, the \n\n Tribunal has grossly misdirected itself in allowing the Original Applications. \n\n 102. It is incomprehensible that the Tribunal assumes role of legislature and purports \n\n to legislate which the rules did not intend. There is no room for 'casus omissus' as the \n\n intention under the rules has been clear and unambiguous, to have variable ratio in \n\n appointments of direct recruits viz; 35 to 50 per cent.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 70 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 103. It is obvious that so long as there is no addition or reduction to MDS Class I posts \n\n \n referred to under sub rule (4) of Rule 3 of other posts over and above said MDS Class I \n\n cadre posts, such posts would not automatically form part of that cadre. It is apparent \n\n \n that unless and until the posts which the applicants wanted to form part of MDS cadre \n\n are actually included in that cadre by increasing number of posts of MDS Class I cadre by \n\n \n following procedure under sub-rule (6), the contention of the applicants would not hold \n\n water and would not be justified. There has been serious and gross error in rendering \n\n decision and issuing directions without reference to sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 and in being \n\n \n oblivious about the existence of the same. The discussion by the Tribunal, therefore, has \n\n to be considered as strayed one. Perusal of impugned order indicates that the Tribunal \n \n has practically rewritten the rules. The other considerations which have weighed with \n \n the Tribunal have little relevance so far as posts in MDS Class I cadre are concerned.\n\n 104. Perusal of sub-rule (6) of rule 3 would reveal that the State Government has been \n\n empowered either to increase or decrease the number of posts or to designate or include \n \n\n more categories of posts or exclude any category of post in the cadre. However, it is \n \n\n nobody's case that by exercise of such power vested in it, the State Government has, at \n\n any point of time, increased the number of posts in MDS Class-I cadre. It is, thus, clear \n\n that the directions given by the learned Tribunal are totally contrary to the statutory rules.\n\n 105. The Tribunal has been absolutely in error in placing an interpretation on the \n\n proviso to rule 5 the way in which it has been placed in the judgment and order on \n\n 22.11.2002. The same amounts to virtually rewriting text of the rule, particularly in \n\n absence of such intent reflected, submitted or advanced. Expansion of dispute beyond \n\n the scope of MDS Rules, 1973 is grossly misplaced. Wording in proviso to rule 5 does \n\n not in any way suggest or give allowance to interpretation as has been placed and in the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 71 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n process, proviso had been re-written by the Tribunal. The proviso to rule 5 of MDS \n\n \n Rules, 1973 on reading, plainly reveals that intention under the same is to have flexibility \n\n in the appointments to MDS Class-I cadre, taking pragmatic view of the situations those \n\n arise in making appointments. However, at the same time, the range within which \n\n \n flexibility is available has been specifically provided for. Having regard to this, it appears \n\n that the Tribunal has been influenced by considerations which are extraneous to the \n\n MDS Rules, 1973. \n\n 106. Posts which the Tribunal required the Government to consider having attributes \n\n of permanency and to be reckoned for MDS Class-I cadre, is without taking into account \n \n the provisions of the statutory rules. The Tribunal's directions and orders in such a \n\n scenario would be wholly misconceived. \n\n 107. The force of contention of the applicants that the appointments of the petitioners \n \n\n herein have been by way of stop gap arrangement and have not been regularized is \n \n\n watered down as it can be borne out from the applicants' pleading that the respondents' \n\n promotion have approval of Departmental Promotion Committee which is the proper \n\n channel. There appears to be no dispute about such assertions of the respondent-\n\n authorities. It would further be required to be taken into consideration that it has \n\n emerged that there is no change in the number of posts in Class I cadre under the MDS \n\n Rules, 1973 and there appears to be no dispute about figure of appointments of direct \n\n recruits in MDS cadre. As such, the appointments of promotees cannot be said to \n\n impinge on the quota of direct recruits in MDS Class I cadre. Having regard to the \n\n position that the quota rule has been followed and proper quota of direct\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 72 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n \n\n \n recruits finds place in the number of posts in MDS Class I cadre according to the rules, \n\n \n the authorities referred to and relied upon on behalf of the applicants have little role in \n\n the present controversy. \n\n 108. When the field is governed and occupied by specific rules, as in present case like \n\n MDS Rules 1973 which have been clear and unambiguous, there had been no room to \n\n place an interpretation on the same than its plain words. The Tribunal as such has erred \n\n \n in going beyond the spirit and letter of the proviso to clause (a) of sub rule (1) of Rule 5.\n\n 109. Though rival arguments have been advanced before us by petitioners so also by \n\n the respondents that the original application was beyond limitation and per contra that it \n \n is within limitation, we do not find it necessary to go into that aspect of the matter. The \n\n learned Tribunal after hearing the parties has decided the matter on merits. We have \n\n also considered the matter on merits and, as such, it would not be appropriate at this \n \n\n stage to go into that issue.\n\n 110. In our considered view, therefore, the Tribunal has wholly misconceived the \n\n scope of the matter before it had been in error all over. The impugned order cannot be \n\n justified with the aid of material on record. The Tribunal, thus, has erred in issuing \n\n impugned directions to prepare fresh seniority list. Looking at the matter in any way, \n\n the impugned order passed by the Tribunal dated 22-11-2002 and the one dated \n\n 28-04-2004 are wholly unsustainable and deserve to be quashed and set aside and as its \n\n incident, the impugned seniority list would not be able to stand.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n 73 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n 111. Therefore, the order dated 22-11-2002 of the Tribunal and all other orders \n\n \n including the orders in contempt petition and in the review applications deserve to be \n\n quashed and set aside. \n\n 112. In the result, writ petitions are allowed. The order dated 22.11.2002 passed by \n\n \n the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Aurangabad Bench, in Original Applications \n\n No. 254 and 256 of 2000 and the subsequent orders dated 28.4.2004 and 21.2.2006 in \n\n \n Contempt Petition No. 89 of 2003, so also order dated 3.11.2004 in Review Applications \n \n No. 11 and 12 of 2004, are set aside. Consequently, seniority lists prepared by the \n\n Department of Rural Development and Water Conservation of the State Government \n \n dated 21.11.2005 in pursuance of the directions under the aforesaid orders of the \n\n Tribunal, is also set aside. \n\n 113. Rule made absolute in aforesaid terms without there being any order as to costs.\n\n 114. In view disposal of writ petitions, civil applications are also disposed of.\n\n [ Sunil P.
