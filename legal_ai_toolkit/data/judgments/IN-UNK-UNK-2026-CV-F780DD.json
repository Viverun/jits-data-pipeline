NO. 3869 OF 2015)\n\nBHANUBEN AND ANR. ………APPELLANTS\n Versus\nSTATE OF GUJARAT ……RESPONDENT\n\n J U D G M E N T\n\nV.GOPALA GOWDA, J.\n\n Leave granted.\n\nThis appeal is filed by the appellants against the impugned judgment and\norder dated 23.02.2015, passed in Criminal Appeal No. 101 of 2010, by the\nHigh Court of Judicature of Gujarat at Ahmedabad, wherein the High Court\nhas dismissed the appeal of the appellants and upheld the order of\nconviction and sentence of the appellants under Sections 498A and 306 read\nwith \nSection 114\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short “\nI.P.C\n.”) passed\nby the Fast Track Court, Veraval, Camp Una, in Sessions Case No.9 of 2007\n(hereinafter “the trial court”) in its judgment and order dated 21.11.2009.\nThe appellants have prayed to set aside the same and quash the criminal\nproceedings initiated against them by the respondent-State, urging various\nlegal grounds.\n\nThe brief facts of the case are stated hereunder to appreciate the rival\nlegal contentions urged on behalf of the parties:\n\n The appellant nos. 1 and 2 are the mother-in-law and the sister-in-\nlaw of the deceased respectively. It is the case of the prosecution that\nthe deceased was residing with her husband and in-laws in a joint family at\nKodinar with a minor daughter. However, within 2 years of marriage, the\ndeceased was allegedly tortured by her husband and her in-laws for not\nbringing dowry and not working properly. The deceased was also allegedly\ndriven out of her matrimonial home and was forced to stay at Kanta Stri\nVikas Gruh at Rajkot.\n\nThe deceased informed the complainant, who is her paternal uncle about the\nharassment and that her husband and in-laws were demanding an amount of\nRs.20,000/- from her. The maternal uncle of the deceased persuaded her to\ncompromise with her in-laws and sent her back to her matrimonial home.\nThereafter, the deceased was kept well for a month but she was later\nallegedly beaten up and driven out of her matrimonial home. A case was\nregistered against them before the Amreli Nari Surakhsha Gruh. After 2\nmonths, the husband and the father-in-law of the deceased brought her back\nafter making a settlement. After a month of her return to her matrimonial\nhome, the deceased was again allegedly beaten up and thrown out of her\nhome. The deceased then filed a complaint against her in-laws before the\nBabra Police Station and a maintenance application was filed before the\nBabra Court. The husband of the deceased brought her back home again after\nmaking a settlement before the Court but she was again allegedly beaten up\nby her in-laws against which she filed a case before the Amreli Mahila\nVikas Gruh, where her maintenance was fixed at Rs.1,000/- p.m. but the same\nwas not paid by her husband.\n\nThe deceased then stayed at the Gondal Bala Ashram (orphanage) and from\nthere she again went back to her in-laws place at Kodinar to meet her\ndaughter whose custody was with her husband as part of a compromise between\nherself and the accused. It is further the case of the prosecution that on\n12.11.2006 at about 11.30 hours when the complainant was on his way to work\nhe received an information that the deceased had consumed poison and later\ncame to know through his daughter that the deceased had passed away.\n\nThe complainant then filed a complaint being I.C.R. No.172 of 2006 before\nthe Kodinar Police Station against the appellants and the husband of the\ndeceased. Thereafter, further investigation was carried out, the panchanama\nof the scene was drawn, the statements of the witnesses were recorded and\nthe accused were arrested.\n\nThe learned trial court after recording the evidence of prosecution\nwitnesses and on perusal of the dying declaration of the deceased and on\nconsideration of the same, convicted and sentenced the present appellants\nand the husband of the deceased for the offences punishable under \nSections\n498A\n and \n306\n read with \nSection 114\n of I.P.C. The accused were to undergo 3\nyears of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/- and in default,\nfurther simple imprisonment of six months for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 498A\n and \n114\n of the I.P.C. For offences punishable under \nSections\n306\n and \n114\n of the I.P.C. the accused were ordered to undergo 10 years\nrigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.12,000/-each and in default,\nfurther simple imprisonment of one year. The accused were acquitted for the\noffences punishable under \nSection 304B\n read with \nSection 114\n of the I.P.C.\nand \nSection 4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the same the accused filed an appeal before the High\nCourt of Gujarat which dismissed the same holding that it has been well\nestablished that the accused have instigated the deceased and thereby they\nabetted the deceased in committing suicide. The High Court further held\nthat the accused and his family members caused mental and physical cruelty\nand therefore, the deceased was put in a critical condition and consumed\npoison and ended her life. It further held that on perusal of the findings\nrecorded by the trial court it was impossible that the deceased could have\nconsumed poison by mistake and therefore, the learned trial court has\nrightly convicted the accused as they are guilty of the above mentioned\noffences. The High Court has thus upheld the order of conviction and\nsentence passed by the trial court against all the accused persons. It is\nstated that the husband of the deceased has already undergone the period of\nsentences passed against him and has been released from jail. The present\nappeal has been filed by the appellants-the mother-in-law and the sister-in-\nlaw of the deceased praying to set aside their conviction and sentence and\nfor their enlargement on bail.\n\nIt has been contended by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellants\nthat the guilt or even the involvement of the appellants in the commission\nof the offence has not been rightly pointed out by the courts below as\nthere are no independent evidence/witnesses against them. Thus, the case\nagainst the appellants has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIt has been further contended by him that the trial court did not find any\nincriminating material evidence against the accused so as to punish them\nunder the aforementioned offences. In the present matter, the only evidence\nadduced before the courts below was the deposition of the relatives of the\ndeceased and no independent witnesses were examined. He has further\nsubmitted that as per the provisions under \nSection 113(A)\n of the Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872, the abetment on the part of the accused has not been\nproved by the prosecution.\n\nHe has further contended that the courts below have not considered the\ndying declaration of the deceased and the deposition made by the doctor who\nhad examined her that were recorded by the Executive Magistrate do not\nmention any allegation against the accused.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been contended by Ms. Hemantika Wahi, the\nlearned counsel on behalf of the respondent that the trial court and the\nHigh Court after appreciating the evidence on record and the submissions\nmade on behalf of the parties have rightly convicted and sentenced the\naccused for the afore- mentioned offences.\n\nShe has submitted that the ingredients under \nSections 498A\n, \n306\n and \n304B\n of\nI.P.C. are established beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused. She\nhas further submitted that from the evidence of the witnesses, it has been\nclearly established that the appellants were mentally and physically\nharassing the deceased and even had driven her out of her matrimonial house\nseveral times.\n\n She has further submitted that the presumption as to the abetment of\nsuicide as per \nSection 113A\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has been\nclearly proved and the appellants are responsible for abetting her in the\ncommission of suicide which is the concurrent finding on fact and the\nappellants have not made out a case for interference of this Court.\n\nOn the basis of the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties\nand the evidence on record, the following questions would arise for our\nconsideration:\n\nWhether, the Courts below have rightly convicted and sentenced the accused\nfor the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 read with \nSection\n114\n of I.P.C.?\n\nWhat order?\n\nBefore arriving at an irrefutable conclusion, we have to first determine as\nto whether the deceased was tortured and meted with cruelty by the accused\nor not? To find out the same, we have perused the evidence placed on record\nby the prosecution viz., the deposition of witnesses and the dying\ndeclaration of the deceased.\n\nIt is an undisputed fact that the deceased was frequently taking refuge at\nKanta Stri Vikas Gruh, Rajkot, Mahila Vikas Gruh and Gondal Bala Ashram. It\nis also an undisputed fact that her paternal relatives had pacified her\nmany a times and she was sent back to her in laws’ home after compromise.\nThe same has been proved by the deposition of PW-6 paternal uncle of the\ndeceased at Exh.69 before the trial court and PW-7-the wife of PW-6 and PW-\n9-the brother of the deceased. The same has also been further corroborated\nby PW-19 who is a social worker at Amreli Mahila Vikas Gruh at Exh.135. It\nis also an undisputed fact that the deceased had filed a complaint against\nthe accused for maintenance, which was not paid to her by her husband. She\nhad also filed an FIR against the accused on 14.02.2006 under \nSections\n498A\n, \n506(2)\n \n114\n of I.P.C and \nSections 3\n and \n7\n of the Dowry Prohibition\nAct, 1961. On several occasions after the compromise, the deceased was\nagain thrown out of her matrimonial home. The abovementioned witnesses have\nalso stated that the deceased was regularly taunted and mentally and\nphysically harassed by the accused and she had complained about the same to\nthe above mentioned witnesses.\n\nIt has also been deposed before the trial court by several other\nindependent witnesses who are the neighbours of the accused and live in the\nsame vicinity that they had witnessed heated exchanges and quarrel between\nthe accused and the deceased which has been corroborated by Ravibhai Dodia\n(PW-8) in his testimony at Exh.80 before the trial court. Further, another\nindependent witness, Smt. Savitaben (PW-10), has also deposed before the\ntrial court at Exh.84 that the deceased had sat on “Otla” of her house for\n2 consecutive days as the accused had locked up their house and gone\nsomewhere and came back only when they received a call from their\nneighbours about the deceased sitting there. It has also been noticed that\nthe deceased had spent several days sleeping at odd places like, empty\nbuses, etc. as she had nowhere else to go.\n\nFurther, the deposition of the witness Hirakumar Kanabhai Gohil (PW-12) in\nhis testimony at Exh.95 had stated before the trial court that the deceased\nwas loitering outside his street and had asked for his help, thereby\nclaiming that her husband and in-laws were trying to kill her and that\nis why she had run away from their home. She also had burn marks branded on\nher hands. Therefore, he had helped her and paid her an amount of Rs.200/-\nfor the bus fare. We have also taken note of the fact that the mother-in-\nlaw ignored the pleas of the deceased by calling her act as “epileptic\nfits” when the deceased had come running out of her house and was calling\nout to her for help on the day of the unfortunate incidence.\n\nThere is no other material evidence or fact brought before this Court to\nshow that the deposition of the above mentioned witness is unreliable and\nthis Court has no reason to believe the same to annul the finding of\nconviction on the charge against the appellants. Therefore, in the light of\nthe above mentioned depositions made and based on the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, it has been aptly held by the courts below that\nthe prosecution has established by adducing cogent and convincing evidence\nthat the deceased had been tortured by her in-laws and her husband. The\nreason that the deceased kept coming back to her matrimonial home by way of\ncompromise in spite of all the cruelty and torture meted against her is\nbecause of her minor daughter who was living with her husband. Thus, the\ningredients to constitute the offence under the provision of \nSection 498A\n\nof I.P.C. have been fully satisfied in the present case against the\nappellants. The relevant provisions of Section 498A read thus:\n\n“498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to\ncruelty.—Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a\nwoman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment\nfor a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to\nfine. Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, “cruelty” means—\n\n(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\nhealth (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view to\ncoercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for\nany property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any\nperson related to her to meet such demand.”\n\nThe deceased was subjected to cruelty at the hands of her husband and her\nin-laws and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the\ncircumstantial evidence makes it amply clear that she was harassed beyond\nlimits by her in-laws, which had caused her grave mental and physical\ninjury. The same had made her run away from matrimonial home on several\ntimes and had ultimately resulted in her death. On the issue that the above\nmentioned witnesses are interested witnesses and their evidence cannot be\naccepted by this Court as contended by the learned counsel on behalf of the\nappellants is also rejected in the light of the decision of this Court in\nthe case of Vishwanath Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal[1], wherein this\nCourt has held thus:\n\n“39…….In a matrimonial dispute, it would be inappropriate to expect\noutsiders to come and depose. The family members and sometimes the\nrelatives, friends and neighbours are the most natural witnesses. The\nveracity of the testimony is to be tested on objective parameters and not\nto be thrown overboard on the ground that the witnesses are related to\neither of the spouse. Exception has been taken by the courts below that the\nservants of the house should have been examined and that amounts to\nsuppression of the best possible evidence…….”\n\nNow, coming to the point of determining whether the accused had abetted in\nthe commission of suicide of the deceased as provided under \nSection 306\n of\nI.P.C., the same cannot be proved with conclusive evidence in the light of\nthe fact that the deceased in her dying declaration had clearly stated that\nshe had consumed the poisonous tablets by mistake. The same was further\ncorroborated by the doctor who had examined her and had declared her as\nstable and conscious enough to give a reasonable statement. Reliance has\nalso been placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of \nBhola Turha\nv. State of Bihar\n[2], wherein this Court has held thus:\n“2. The conviction of the appellant is based solely upon the dying\ndeclaration. It has been found to be reliable. It was made by the deceased\nwithin about two hours from the incident and a few hours before his death.\nIn his dying declaration, he has clearly explained how he came to be\ninjured by the appellant. After carefully scrutinising the dying\ndeclaration, both the courts have come to the conclusion that it contains a\ntruthful version as regards the manner in which the injuries were caused to\nhim.”\n\nFurther, the accused were present inside the house at the time the deceased\nconsumed the poisonous tablet and they had taken her to the hospital as\nsoon as they realized that she was in a critical condition. Thus, even\nthough the cruelty aspect meted on the deceased has been proved beyond all\nreasonable doubt, it cannot be said that the same had lead her to commit\nsuicide or that the accused had abetted in the commission of the same, as\nis clear from the facts and circumstances of the present case. The\nappellant no.1 herein even though had behaved stoically in the beginning by\ncalling the act of the deceased as “epileptic fit”, but as soon as she\nrealized the gravity of the situation she called her son and they took her\nto the hospital for examination and treatment. This act of the accused\nclearly shows that they did not abet the deceased in the commission of the\nsuicide, if at all it was a suicide.\n\nFrom the facts and circumstances of the present case and upon the\nexamination of the body of deceased, it is clear that her death was a\nresult of an accident and she had mistakenly consumed the poisonous tablet\nas the same was kept with other medicines. Had the deceased wanted to\nimplicate the accused, she would have revealed their names in the final\nmoments before her death, as she had nothing to fear for and her antecedent\nshowed that she had previously filed a complaint against the accused when\nthey harassed her. If the accused had any hand in her death, the same would\nhave been revealed in the dying declaration of the deceased. Thus, the\nprosecution has failed to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the\naccused had abetted the deceased in the commission of suicide as provided\nunder the provision of Section 306, I.P.C.\n\nIn view of the above observations made, it is amply clear that even though\nthe accused had tortured and harassed the deceased because of which she was\nconstantly running away from her matrimonial home and had also filed a\nnumber of complaints against the accused, the same cannot be said to be the\nreason for her death in the light of the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case and the dying declaration made by her.\n\nThe learned counsel for the appellants has \nplaced reliance upon\n the\ndecision of this Court reported in the case of \nRamesh Kumar v. State of\nChhattisgarh\n[3] at paragraph 22 wherein it is held that \nSections 498A\n and\n\n306\n IPC are independent and constitute different offences. Merely because\nan accused has been held liable to be punished under \nSection 498A\n IPC, it\ndoes not follow that on the same evidence, he must also and necessarily be\nheld guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide by the women\nconcerned under 306 \nIPC\n. Therefore, the conviction and sentence for offence\npunishable under Section 306 read with \nSection 114\n of the IPC of the\npresent appellants is contrary to the legal evidence on record\nparticularly, the dying declaration of the deceased and the conduct of the\naccused who took the deceased to the hospital. This fact has been grossly\nignored by the courts below while convicting and sentencing the appellants\nfor the aforesaid offences. Therefore, the conviction and sentence for the\naforesaid offence is erroneous and accordingly it is liable to be set\naside.\n\nAfter evaluation of evidence on record and concurrent finding of fact\nrecorded by the trial court and the appellate court, the appellants were\nconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 498A and 306 read with\n\nSection 114\n of I.P.C. The accused were acquitted for the offences\npunishable under Section 304B read with \nSection 114\n of I.P.C. and \nSection 4\n\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 as they did not find any evidence on\nrecord to bring home the guilt of appellants for the offences punishable\nunder Section 306 as there is no cogent evidence in this regard in the\nfinding of fact. Therefore, the conviction and sentence for the offence\npunishable under \nSection 498A\n of I.P.C. with regard to cruelty is held to\nbe proved by the courts below. The same is accepted by us and they are\nrequired to be convicted and sentenced for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 498A\n, I.P.C. The conviction and sentence passed by the High Court\nfor the offence punishable under Section 306 read with \nSection 114\n of\nI.P.C. is liable to be set aside, accordingly, we set aside the same.\n\nSince, we have upheld the conviction for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 498A\n I.P.C., it is to be carefully examined by us taking into\nconsideration the facts and circumstances of the case as to what sentence\nis required to be imposed upon the appellants. Keeping in view the age of\nthe appellants i.e. the appellant No. 1-mother-in-law of the deceased who\nis said to be around 60 years of age and appellant No.2-sister-in-law of\nthe deceased who is more than 35 years of age and having a child to take\ncare of, we deem it fit and proper to limit the sentence to the period of\nimprisonment already undergone by them.\n\n We partly set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 23.02.2015 of\nthe High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Criminal Appeal No. 101 of\n2010.\n\n We confirm the conviction on the charge under \nSection 498A\n of I.P.C.\nand having regard to the facts and circumstances \nreferred to above\n we\ndirect that the period already undergone by the appellants in custody is\nthe sentence. We modify and reduce the sentence to the period of\nimprisonment already undergone by them.\n\n Since, we have stated that period already undergone is the sentence which\nwe have modified in this judgment for the conviction under \nSection 498A\n of\nthe I.P.C. and in pursuant to the impugned judgment and order of the High\nCourt, the appellants have surrendered to undergo the imprisonment.\nPresently, they are undergoing sentence imposed by the High Court and\ntherefore, we direct the Jail Superintendent, Rajkot Central Prison,\nRajkot, Gujarat to release them forthwith, if not required in connection\nwith any other criminal case.\n\n Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.\n\n ……………………………………………………………J.\n [T.S.THAKUR]\n\n ……………………………………………………………J.\n [V.GOPALA GOWDA]\n\nNew Delhi, September 14, 2015\n\n-----------------------\n[1] (2012) 7 SCC 288\n[2] (1998) 9 SCC 15\n[3] (2001)9 SCC 618",
