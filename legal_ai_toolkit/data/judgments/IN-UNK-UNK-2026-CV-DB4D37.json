Plaintiffs No.1 to 12 are legal heirs of\n\nlate Smt. Lingamma. The defendants No.1 to 6 are legal\n\nheirs of late Smt. Muniyamma. The defendants No.7 to\n\n 6 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n9 are legal heirs of late Smt. Nanjamma.\n\nMunishamappa had acquired suit 'A' schedule\n\nproperties. Munishamappa had no male children.\n\nMunishamappa died leaving behind his three daughters\n\nnamely Smt. Lingamma, late Smt. Muniyamma and late\n\nSmt. Nanjamma. After death of Munishamappa, all his\n\nthree daughters have succeeded to suit properties.\n\nEven though, khata of suit properties were standing in\n\nthe names of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma,\n\nSmt. Lingamma, was also in joint possession and\n\nenjoyment of suit properties along with his sisters.\n\nThere was no partition or division in suit properties\n\namong Smt. Lingamma, Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.\n\nNanjamma. The defendants No.1 to 9 have no exclusive\n\nright over suit properties. After death of Smt.\n\nNanjamma and Smt. Muniyamma, defendants No.1 to 4\n\nwithout knowledge and consent of plaintiffs got\n\ntransferred suit properties in their names and\n\nsubsequently they have sold portion of suit properties\n\nin the form of sites to 3rd parties. Suit 'B' schedule\n\nproperties purchased in the name of defendant No.1 out\n\nof joint family funds selling portion of suit 'A' schedule\n\n 7 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nproperties. The defendant No.10 has acquired suit 'A'\n\nschedule properties for formation of layout. After death\n\nof Smt. Lingamma, defendants have neglected the\n\nplaintiffs and stopped to give any share in crops and\n\nrevenue raised out of suit properties. The plaintiffs\n\nhave demanded their shares in suit properties. The\n\ndefendants making an attempt to get compensation\n\namount from defendant No.10 by colluding with each\n\nother without knowledge of plaintiffs. On these\n\npleadings, plaintiffs have prayed to decree suit as\n\nprayed in plaint.\n\n 3. In response to the service of suit summons,\n\ndefendants No.1, 3, 4, 7 and 10 have tendered their\n\nappearance before the court through their respective\n\ncounsels and contested the case. During pendency of\n\nsuit, original defendant No.2 died, by filing necessary\n\napplication his LR's are brought on record. The\n\ndefendant No.2(a) even after service of the summons,\n\nshe has tendered her appearance before the court\n\nthrough her respective counsel and contested the case.\n\nThe defendant No.4 filed his written statement, the\n\n 8 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\ndefendant No.1 and 3 adopted the written statement of\n\ndefendant No.4. The defendants No. 1, 2(a), 3, 4, 7 and\n\n10 have filed their written statement. Even after service\n\nof the summons, the defendant No.6, 8 and 9 have not\n\ntendered their appearance before the court through\n\ntheir counsels and contested the suit, consequently\n\nthey have placed ex-parte.\n\n 4. The contents of written statement of\n\ndefendant No.1, 3 and 4 in brief are as under:-\n\n The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law\n\nand on facts and same is liable to be dismissed.\n\nMunishamappa and Smt. Lingamma are unknown to\n\nfamily of defendants No.1 to 9. The plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants No.1 to 9 do not belong to same family.\n\nDefendants No.1 to 9 are claiming lineage from Sri\n\nVenkatappa and Smt. Gopamma. Smt. Nanjamma and\n\nSmt. Muniyamma are daughters of Venkatappa and\n\nSmt. Gopamma. Muniyappa, Chikkapaiah,\n\nVenkataramanappa and Narayanaswamy are children\n\nof Smt. Muniyamma. Narayanappa, Ramanna,\n\nMuniyappa and Smt. Parvathamm are children of Smt.\n\n 9 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nNanjamma. It is further specifically contended,\n\nSy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3, situated at Dasarahalli\n\nVillage were purchased by Sonnappa, who is husband\n\nof Smt. Muniyamma. Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.\n\nNanjamma purchased Sy.No.43/2. Smt. Muniyamma\n\nand Smt. Nanjamma are not related to plaintiffs. Suit\n\n'A' schedule properties acquired by defendant No.10 for\n\nformation of Arkavathi Layout. Suit 'B' schedule\n\nproperties acquired by defendant No.1 out of his own\n\nearning. Plaintiffs are not entitled for compensation\n\namount relating to properties acquired by BDA. Suit 'C'\n\nschedule properties were purchased by Sonnappa in the\n\nauction. Suit 'C' schedule properties exclusively\n\nbelonged to Sonnappa. The plaintiffs are not in joint\n\npossession and enjoyment of suit properties. The\n\nplaintiffs have not properly valued subject matter of suit\n\nand they have not paid proper court fees. On these\n\ngrounds, defendants have requested to dismiss suit\n\nfiled by plaintiff.\n\n 5. The contents of written statement of\n\ndefendant No.2(a) and 7 in brief are as under:-\n\n 10 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law\n\nand on facts and same is liable to be dismissed. Suit of\n\nplaintiffs is wholly misconceived, vexatious,\n\nunsustainable and liable to be dismissed. Neither\n\nplaintiffs, defendants No.11 and 12 nor late Smt.\n\nLingamma and Munishamappa are part of joint family\n\nof Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. Genealogical\n\ntree produced by plaintiffs is created for the purpose of\n\nfiling suit. late Munishamappa was not Kartha or\n\noriginal owner of suit 'A' schedule properties. Smt.\n\nLingamma and Sri Munishamappa are strangers to\n\nfamily of defendants No.1 to 9. Suit is bad for non-\n\njoinder of necessary parties and bad for mis-joinder of\n\nparties. Title deeds and revenue records indicates that,\n\nsuit schedule properties should in exclusive name of\n\ndefendants No.1 to 9 for more than 50 years prior to\n\nfiling present suit. As such, suit is barred by law of\n\nlimitation. Smt. Nanjamma and Smt. Muniyamma are\n\ndaughters of Venkatappa and Smt. Gopamma.\n\nSonnappa is husband of Smt. Muniyamma. Sonnappa\n\nduring his lifetime purchased Sy.No.43/1 and\n\nSy.No.43/3 out of his own income under registered sale\n\n 11 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\ndeed. Sy.No.43/2 was acquired by Smt.Nanjamma D/o.\n\nVenkatappa and Smt. Muniyamma under registered\n\nsale deed. Subsequently, there was deed of partition\n\ndated 30.06.1950 and Sy.No.43/2 divided between Smt.\n\nNanjamma and Smt.Muniyamma. Defendants No.1 to 9\n\nbecome owners of suit properties. Plaintiffs, defendants\n\nNo.11 and 12 do not any share in suit properties.\n\nPresent suit filed merely to harass defendants No.1 to 9\n\nand in order to make wrongful gain. The plaintiffs have\n\nnot properly valued subject matter of suit and they have\n\nnot paid proper court fees. On these grounds,\n\ndefendants have requested to dismiss suit filed by\n\nplaintiff.\n\n 6. The contents of written statement of\n\ndefendant No.10 in brief are as under:-\n\n The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law\n\nand on facts and same is liable to be dismissed. The\n\nplaintiffs have not issued notice to defendant No.10 as\n\ncontemplated under \nSection 64\n of BDA Act. The\n\ndefendant No.10 -BDA has issued preliminary\n\nnotification and final notification in respect of\n\n 12 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nacquisition of Sy.No.43/1, Sy.No.43/2 and Sy.No.43/3\n\nof Dasarahalli Village for formation of Arkavathi Layout.\n\nDefendant No.10 authority is in possession and\n\nenjoyment of acquired lands. There is no cause of\n\naction for the plaintiffs to file suit against defendant\n\nNo.10. On these grounds, defendant has requested to\n\ndismiss suit filed by plaintiff.\n\n 7. On the basis of above pleadings of both parties,\n\nthis court has framed the following :-\n\n ISSUES\n\n 1. Whether the plaintiffs prove that the\n Plaint Schedule Properties are the joint\n properties of the Plaintiffs and the\n Defendants No.1 to 9, 11 and 12?\n\n 2. Whether the plaintiffs prove that they\n are in joint possession of the plaint\n schedule properties along with the\n Defendant No.1 to 9, 11 and 12?\n\n 3. Whether the defendant No.10 proves\n that the suit of the plaintiff is bad for\n not issuing the notice as contemplated\n under \nSection 64\n of the BDA Act?\n\n 4. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for a\n share in the plaint schedule\n properties? If yes, what is their share?\n\n 13 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for\n mesne profits? If yes, at what rate and\n from what date?\n\n6. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for\n the reliefs claimed?\n\n7. What order or decree?\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUES DATED 03.03.2022\n\n1. Whether the defendant No.7 proves\n that the suit is not properly valued and\n the court fee paid is insufficient?\n\n2. Whether the defendant No.7 proves\n that defendant No.1 to 9 are the\n absolute owners of the Schedule 'A'\n and 'B' Properties?\n\n3. Whether the plaintiffs proves that suit\n 'B' schedule property was purchased\n on the income generated from the\n schedule 'A' property by the defendant\n No.1?\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUES DATED 15.10.2022\n\n1. Whether defendant No.2A proves that\n the valuation made and the court fee\n paid is insufficient?\n\n2.

To substantiate the case of plaintiffs, the\n\nplaintiff No.4 examined himself as PW1 and produced in\n\n90 documents as Exs.P1 to Ex.P.90. The defendant No.7\n\nexamined himself as D.W.1 and produced in 74\n\ndocuments as Exs.D.1 to D.74.\n\n 9. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel\n\nfor plaintiffs and learned counsel for defendant No.4\n\nand I have perused the case records.\n\n 10. My answers to the above issues are as under-\n\n ISSUE No.1 - In the negative;\n\n ISSUE No.2 - In the negative;\n\n ISSUE No.3 - In the affirmative;\n\n ISSUE No.4 - In the negative;\n\n ISSUE No.5 - In the negative;\n\n ISSUE No.6 - In the negative;\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.1\n DATED 03.03.2022 - In the negative;\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.2\n DATED 03.03.2022 - In the affirmative;\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.3\n DATED 03.03.2022 - In the negative;\n\n 15 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.1\n DATED 15.10.2022 - In the negative;\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.2\n DATED 15.10.2022 - In the negative;\n\n ADDITIONAL ISSUE No.3\n DATED 15.10.2022 - In the affirmative;\n\n ISSUE No.6 - As per final order,\n\n for the following -\n\n REASONS\n\n 11. ISSUES No.1, 2 AND ADDITIONAL ISSUE\n\nNO.2 :- As these issues are inter-related to each other\n\nand involves common appreciation of facts and evidence\n\non record, findings on one issue are bearing on other\n\nissue, in order to avoid repetition of facts and for\n\nconvenience sake, both issues are taken together for\n\ncommon discussion.\n\n 12. As per case of plaintiffs, late Smt. Lingamma,\n\nSmt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma are\n\ndaughters of late Munishamappa. It is specifically\n\nstated in plaint that, late Munishamappa had no male\n\nchildren. Munishamappa having acquired suit schedule\n\nproperties died leaving behind his three daughters who\n\nare Smt. Lingamma, Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt.\n\n 16 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nLate Nanjamma to succeeded to his estate. Further it is\n\ndefinite case of plaintiffs and same is deposed by\n\nplaintiff No.4, who examined as P.W.1 that, plaintiffs\n\nNo.1 to 12 are legal heirs of late Smt. Lingamma. The\n\ndefendants No.1 to 6 are legal heirs of late Smt.\n\nMuniyamma. The defendants No.7 to 9 are legal heirs of\n\nlate Smt. Nanjamma.\n\n 13. It is pertinent to note here that, the contesting\n\ndefendants have denied and disputed relationship of\n\nlate Smt. Lingamma with that of late Smt. Muniyamma\n\nand late Smt. Nanjamma. It is specifically contended by\n\ncontesting defendants, neither plaintiffs nor defendants\n\nNo.11 and 12, so also late Smt. Lingamma and\n\nMunishamappa were not part of joint family of Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. It is specific\n\ncontention of defendants and same is deposed by\n\ndefendant No.7, who examined as D.W.1 that, plaintiffs\n\nand defendants No.1 to 9 are not members of joint\n\nfamily. It is further contended and deposed by D.W.1\n\nthat, plaintiffs are claiming partition through late\n\nMunishamappa and late Smt. Lingamma. These\n\n 17 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nMunishamappa and Smt. Lingamma are unknown to\n\nthe family of defendants No.1 to 9.\n\n 14. According to defendants, Sri Venkatappa and\n\nhis wife Smt. Gopamma had two daughters namely Smt.\n\nNajamma and Smt. Muniyamma. Muniyappa, Chikka\n\nAppaiah, Venkataramanappa and Narayanaswamy are\n\nchildren of Smt Muniyamma. Narayanappa, Ramanna,\n\nMuniyappa and Smt. Parvathamma are children of Smt.\n\nNajamma.\n\n 15. On proper appreciation of pleadings of parties\n\nand evidence of P.W.1 and D.W.1, it is very much clear\n\nthat, plaintiffs have claimed late Smt. Lingamma and\n\nlate Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma are\n\ndaughters of late Munishamappa. On the other hand,\n\ncontesting defendants have denied and disputed\n\nrelationship of plaintiffs and late Smt. Lingamma with\n\nthat of late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma\n\nas well as relationship of plaintiffs and these defendants\n\nNo.1 to 9. The defendants have claimed late Smt.\n\nNanjamma and late Smt. Muniyamma are not\n\ndaughters of late Munishamappa. On the other hand,\n\n 18 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nthey are daughters of late Venkatappa and late Smt.\n\nGopamma.\n\n 16. When there is serious dispute with regard to\n\nrelationship of parties, it is heavy burden on plaintiffs to\n\nprove relationship of late Smt. Lingamma with that of\n\nlate Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma as per\n\nProvision under \nSection 50\n of Indian Evidence Act. It is\n\nwell settled proposition of law that, when relationship of\n\none person with another person is in dispute in Civil\n\nsuit, same has to be proved as per provisions of \nSec. 50\n\nof Indian Evidence Act. \nSec. 50\n of Indian Evidence Act\n\nis an exception to General rule that, hearsay evidence is\n\ninadmissible and opinion based on such evidence. As\n\nper \nSec.50\n of Evidence Act mere opinion expressed by\n\nconduct of a person, who is a member of a family or\n\notherwise has special means of knowledge as to\n\nexistence of relationship is admissible under this\n\nSection. Such person need not be a member of family.\n\nHe may be an outsider. It will suffice, if he has special\n\nmeans of knowledge. So, a person watching conduct of\n\nmembers has to be treated as a person with special\n\nmeans of knowledge.\n\n 19 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n 17. Further ingredients of \nSec.50\n of Evidence Act\n\nare as follows:- 1) There must be case, where court has\n\nto form an opinion as to the relationship of one person\n\nto another. 2) In such case, opinion expressed by\n\nconduct as to existence of such relationship is relevant\n\nfact. 3) But a person whose opinion is expressed by\n\nconduct is relevant must be person as member of family\n\nor otherwise has special means of knowledge on\n\nparticular subject of relationship.\n\n 18. Herein the case, genealogical tree of family of\n\nplaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 9 has been produced\n\nas per Ex.P.1. In said document, Smt. Lingamma, Smt.\n\nLate Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma shown as\n\ndaughters of late Munishamappa. Admittedly, Ex.P.1\n\ngenealogical tree not issued by competent authority. It\n\nis fact that, said document has been prepared based on\n\ninformation furnished by plaintiff No.4.\n\n 19. It is required to be noted here, just based on\n\noral contention of plaintiffs and contents of Ex.P.1\n\ngenealogy, which is prepared based on information of\n\nplaintiff No.4 it is very hard to come to conclusion the\n\n 20 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nplaintiffs have proved their relationship with that of\n\nSmt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma. \nIn\n\nthis regard, reference has to be made to decision of\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court reported in (1983) 3 SCC\n\n118 in case of \nState of Bihar Vs. Radha Krishna\n\nSingh and others\n, wherein it is held that, in cases\n\nwhere the plaint genealogy is the very basis of plaintiffs\n\ncase and since there is a tendency on the part of an\n\ninterested person or a party in order to grab, establish\n\nor prove an alleged crime to concoct, fabricate or\n\nprocure false genealogy to suit their ends, the court\n\nshould endeavor to do justice on the materials and\n\nrecords uninfluenced and undaunted by any extraneous\n\ncircumstances. It is further held that, genealogies\n\nadmitted or proved to be old and relied on in previous\n\ncases are doubtless relevant and in some cases may\n\neven be conclusive of the facts proved, but there are\n\nseveral considerations which must be kept in mind viz.:\n\n(a) Source of the genealogy and its dependability. (b)\n\nAdmissibility of the genealogy under the \nEvidence Act\n.\n\n(c) A proper use in decisions or judgments on which\n\nreliance is placed. (d) Age of genealogies. (e) Litigation\n\n 21 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nwhere such genealogies have been accepted or rejected.\n\nOn the question of admissibility the following tests must\n\nbe adopted: (a) The genealogies of the families\n\nconcerned must fall within the four-corners of \nSection\n\n32(5)\n or \nSection 13\n of the Evidence Act. (b) They must\n\nnot be hit by the doctrine of post litem motam. (c) The\n\ngenealogies or the claims cannot be proved by recitals,\n\ndepositions or facts narrated in the judgment which\n\nhave been held by a long course of decisions to be\n\ninadmissible. (d) Where genealogy is proved by oral\n\nevidence, the said evidence must clearly show special\n\nmeans of knowledge disclosing the exact source, time\n\nand the circumstances under which the knowledge is\n\nacquired, and this must be clearly and conclusively\n\nproved.\n\n 20. Herein the case, if principles \nlaid down in\n\nabove decision are press into service to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of case on hand, the contesting\n\ndefendants have seriously disputed relationship of\n\nplaintiffs with that of deceased Smt. Late Muniyamma\n\nand Smt. Late Nanjamma as claimed in the plaint and\n\nalso as mentioned in Ex.P1, Now it is bounden duty of\n\n 22 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nplaintiffs to prove their relationship with those persons\n\nby producing sufficient documentary and oral evidence\n\nbefore the court.\n\n 21. The P.W.1 in his cross-examination has\n\ndenied, late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma\n\nare daughters of late Venkatappa and late Smt.\n\nGopamma. It is specific say of P.W.1 that, except\n\ngenealogical tree/Ex.P.1, plaintiffs have not produced\n\nother documents to establish relationship of Smt.\n\nLingamma, Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late\n\nNanjamma. Further it is to be noted here, no persons\n\nwho being family members of plaintiffs or defendants or\n\npersons having special means of knowledge about\n\nrelationship of Smt. Lingamma with that of Smt. Late\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma have been\n\nexamined before court. The plaintiffs have not taken\n\nany steps to establish relationship of these plaintiffs\n\nNo.1 to 12 with that of defendants No.1 to 9 as well as\n\ntheir relationship with late Smt. Muniyamma and late\n\nSmt. Nanjamma.\n\n 22. As already discussed, P.W.1 has clearly\n\nadmitted except Ex.P.1 genealogical tree there is no\n\n 23 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nother documents or evidence of family members of\n\nplaintiffs and defendants to establish Smt. Lingamma\n\nbeing daughter of late Munishamappa is sister of Smt.\n\nLate Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma. Even in\n\ncross-examination of D.W.1, nothing worth elicited to\n\ncome to conclusion, Smt. Lingamma is own sisters of\n\nSmt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. Further it is\n\nnot elicited from mouth of D.W.1 that, ancestor of\n\nplaintiffs and Smt. Lingamma, ancestors of defendants\n\nNo.1 to 9 who are Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.\n\nNanjamma are daughters of late Munishamappa. The\n\nD.W.1 in his cross-examination has categorically stated,\n\nSmt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma are the\n\ndaughters of late Venkatappa and Smt. Gopamm.\n\nAbsolutely there is no documentary evidence issued by\n\ncompetent authority to say late Smt. Lingamma being\n\none of daughter of Munishamappa, she is sister of Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.\n\n 23. According to plaintiffs, Munishamappa during\n\nhis lifetime has acquired suit 'A' schedule properties.\n\nFurther it is specifically stated by plaintiffs that, suit 'B'\n\nschedule properties purchased in the name of defendant\n\n 24 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nNo.1 out of joint family funds by selling portion of suit\n\nproperties. Further it is definite case of plaintiffs that,\n\ndefendant No.10 has acquired suit 'A' schedule\n\nproperties for formation of residential layout. As such,\n\nplaintiffs being legal heirs of late Smt. Lingamma and\n\nthey have got their definite share in suit properties.\n\n 24. It is specifically contended by defendants and\n\nsame is deposed by D.W.1 that, Sonnappa, who is\n\nhusband of Smt. Muniyamma, during his lifetime, he\n\nacquired land bearing Sy.No.43/1 and 43/3 out of his\n\nown income. These Sy.No.43/1 and 43/3 are absolute\n\nproperties of late Sonnapp. In order to substantiate\n\nsame, defendants have produced certified copy of sale\n\ndeed dated 12.08.1960 as per Ex.D.4.\n\n 25. On perusal of contents of said document,\n\nSonnappa S/o. Muniyappa had purchased Sy.No.43/1\n\nto an extent of 2 acres 29 guntas and Sy.No.43/3 to an\n\nextent of 29 guntas from Nanjappa and his family\n\nmembers. The defendants have further produced sale\n\ndeeds of vendors of Nanjappa in respect of these\n\nproperties as per Exs.D.1 to D.3.\n\n 25 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n 26. On careful perusal of contents of Ex.D.1, K.V.\n\nByregowda had sold Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 of\n\nDasarahalli Vilalge, in favour of Nanjappa under\n\nregistered sale deed dated 01.05.1945. Later on\n\nNanjappa and his family members sold these properties\n\nunder Ex.D.2 dated 21.04.1956 in favour of Smt.\n\nMuthamma. Under Ex.D.3, Smt. Muthamma has sold\n\nthese properties in favour of Sri Nanjappa and his\n\nfamily members under registered sale deed dated\n\n07.09.1959. As already discussed, under Ex.D.4,\n\nSonnappa S/o. Muniyappa had purchased these\n\nSy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 of Dasarahalli Vilalge under\n\nregistered sale deed from Nanjappa and his family\n\nmembers.\n\n 27. The records of rights of Sy.No.43/1 to an\n\nextent of 2 acres 29 guntas from the year 1969 to 2013-\n\n14 have been produced as per Exs.P.1 to P.19. On\n\ncareful perusal of these documents, earlier name of\n\nSonnappa S/o. Muniyappa was shown as owner and\n\npossessor of properties. On perusal of Ex.P.5, name of\n\nSonnappa S/o. Muniyappa has been round off and\n\nnames of his sons Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,\n\n 26 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nChikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy entered to\n\nSy.No.43/1 in concerned revenue records based on IHC\n\nNo.2/1985-86. Thereafter, names of these persons\n\ncontinued in revenue records.\n\n 28. Likewise, records of rights of Sy.No.43/2 have\n\nbeen produced as per Exs.P.22 to P.36. On perusal of\n\nthese documents, earlier names of Smt. Najamma and\n\nSmt. Muniyamma jointly entered into said property as\n\nowners and possessors. As per Ex.P.23 names of Smt.\n\nNanjamma and Smt. Muniyamma round off and thereby\n\nnames of her sons Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,\n\nChikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy entered into an\n\nextent of property held by Smt. Muniyamma.\n\n 29. The records of rights of Sy.No.43/3 have been\n\nproduced as per Exs.P.37 to P.56. On careful perusal of\n\ncontents of these documents, earlier names of\n\nSonnappa S/o. Muniyappa entered as owner and\n\npossessor of property. As per Ex.P.40, names of\n\nSonnappa round off and names of Muniyappa,\n\nVenkataramanappa, Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy\n\nhave been entered into the property.\n\n 27 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n 30. Records of rights of Sy.No.33, Sy.No.32 have\n\nbeen produced as per Exs.P.58 to P.60. On careful\n\nperusal of these documents, name of defendant No.1\n\nshown as owner and possessor of these properties. As\n\nper Ex.P.69/ mutation registrar extract, it can be\n\ngathered that, name of defendants has been entered\n\ninto Sy.No.32/1, which is suit item No.1 of suit 'B'\n\nschedule properties in the name of defendant No.1 by\n\ndeleting name of H.B. Ramegowda S/o. Bettegowda.\n\n 31. The records of rights of suit item No. 1 to 3 of\n\nsuit 'C' schedule properties have been produced as per\n\nExs.P.71 to P.90. On careful perusal of contents of these\n\ndocuments, names of Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,\n\nChikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy jointly shown as\n\nowners and possessors of these properties.\n\n 32. As per documents \nreferred above\n, name of\n\nSonnappa and thereafter names of Muniyappa,\n\nVenkataramanappa, Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy\n\nhave been entered into suit schedule properties in\n\nconcerned revenue records. Plaintiffs have not\n\nproduced any documents to show, earlier to name of\n\n 28 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nSonnappa or Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,\n\nChikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy name of\n\nMunishamappa, who is father of Smt. Lingamma\n\nentered to these suit properties as owner and possessor\n\nof properties.\n\n 33. At one stretch, during cross-examination,\n\nP.W.1 has claimed, he can produce documents to show\n\nland bearing Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 were standing\n\nin the name of Munishamappa. In further cross-\n\nexamination, it is claimed by P.W.1 that, he has\n\nproduced documents to show all these suit properties\n\nwere standing in the name of Sonnappa.\n\n 34. On careful perusal of documents produced by\n\nplaintiffs before court no such registered deeds or\n\nrevenue records produced before court to show earlier\n\nthese suit properties were standing in the name of\n\nMunishamappa, who is father of late Smt. Lingamma.\n\nOn the other hand, there is registered sale deeds and\n\nlong standing revenue records from the year 1969 to\n\n2013-14 wherein name of Sonnappa and later names of\n\ndefendants No.1 to 3 and Narayanaswamy entered to\n\n 29 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nthese properties are owners and possessors of\n\nproperties.\n\n 35. On proper appreciation of oral evidence as\n\nwell as documentary evidence as \nreferred above\n,\n\nplaintiffs have failed to establish, their ancestor Smt.\n\nLingamma being daughter of late Munishamappa is\n\nsister of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.\n\nFurther, plaintiffs have failed to establish earlier suit 'A'\n\nschedule properties were acquired by Munishamappa\n\nand suit 'B' schedule properties purchased in the name\n\nof defendant No.1 out of joint family funds.\n\n 36. Once, plaintiffs have failed to establish their\n\nrelationship with that of Smt. Nanjamma and Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Sonnappa as well as these defendants\n\nNo.1 to 9, plaintiffs cannot claim they are in joint\n\npossession and enjoyment of suit properties along with\n\ndefendants No.1 to 9, 11 and 12. On the other hand, by\n\nvirtue of registered documents and long standing\n\nrevenue records which are remained unchallenged from\n\nthe year 1969, defendants No.1 to 9 have proved, they\n\nare absolute owners of suit schedule properties. Hence I\n\n 30 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nanswer Issue No.1 and 2 in the negative, Additional\n\nIssue No.2 dated 03.03.2022 in the affirmative.\n\n 37.ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.3 DATED\n\n03.03.2022 :-\n\n As these issues are inter-related to each other and\n\ninvolves common appreciation of facts and evidence on\n\nrecord, findings on one issue are bearing on other issue,\n\nin order to avoid repetition of facts and for convenience\n\nsake, both issues are taken together for common\n\ndiscussion.\n\n 38. It is specific contention of plaintiffs that, even\n\nthough suit 'B' schedule properties purchased in the\n\nname of defendant No.1, same are also joint family\n\nproperties of plaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 9. These\n\nproperties purchased from joint family funds by selling\n\nportion of suit 'A' schedule properties.\n\n 39. As already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to\n\nestablish they themselves and late Smt. Lingamma are\n\njoint family members of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.\n\nNanjamma. Plaintiffs further failed to establish, Smt.\n\nLingamma being one of daughters of late\n\n 31 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nMunishamappa become member of joint family of Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. Once, plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to establish relationship of late Smt. Lingamma as\n\nown sister of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma,\n\ncontention of plaintiffs that, suit 'A' schedule properties\n\nare joint family properties of themselves and defendants\n\nNo.1 to 9 and out of joint family funds, suit 'B' schedule\n\nproperties purchased in the name of defendant No.1 is\n\nnot at all sustainable.\n\n 40. The plaintiffs first of all have to establish suit\n\n'A' schedule properties are joint family properties of\n\nthemselves and defendants No.1 to 9 and there was\n\nsufficient nucleus from these suit 'A' schedule\n\nproperties. \nIn this regard, learned counsel for\n\ndefendants has rightly relied upon decision reported in\n\n(2003) 10 SCC 310 in case of \nB.S. Lakshmaiah and\n\nanother vs. L. Balasubramanyam and another\n and\n\nanother decision reported in (1969) 1 SCC 392 in\n\ncase of \nVallabbahi Nathabhai Vs. Baji Jivi and\n\nothers\n, wherein it is held that, the parties failed to\n\ndischarge initial burden of establishing that there was\n\nany nucleus in the form of any income whatsoever from\n\n 32 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\njoint family property. No presumption of property being\n\njoint family property only on account of existence of a\n\nHindu Joint Family. The one who asserts has to prove\n\nthe property is joint family property. Hence, I answer\n\nAdditional Issue No.3 dated 03.03.2022 in the\n\nnegative.\n\n 41. ISSUE NO.3 :- The defendant No.10 has\n\nspecifically contended, suit is not maintainable either in\n\nlaw or on facts without issuing prior notice to defendant\n\nauthority. It is further contended, already Sy.No.43/1,\n\n43/2 and 43/3 of Dasarahalli Village have been\n\nacquired by BDA for formation of Arkavathi Layout as\n\nper Notification issued in the year 2003 itself.\n\n 42. It is pertinent to note here that, as per Section\n\n64 of Bengaluru Development Authority Act, one month\n\nwritten notice be given to BDA before filing suit. It is\n\nalso pertinent to note here that, in case of urgent relief\n\nsuit can be filed without notice with court's leave.\n\n 43. Herein the case, plaintiffs have not issued any\n\nprior notice to defendant No.10 authority as required\n\nunder \nSection 64\n of BDA Act. Further, no application\n\n 33 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nseeking suspension of such notice filed along with\n\nplaint. As such, suit against defendant No.10 by\n\nplaintiffs is not maintainable. \nIn this regard, learned\n\ncounsel for defendants has rightly relied upon decision\n\nreported in ILR 1992 KAR 307 in case of \nK.P. Arvind\n\nVs. Government of Karnataka\n wherein it is held that,\n\nthe plaint must state in unequivocal terms that, notice\n\nin writing as required under \nSection 64\n of BDA Act has\n\nbeen served on BDA, one month prior to presentation of\n\nplaint. In instant case, no such averments is contained\n\nin plaint nor any such notice in writing was given to\n\nBDA. Therefore, plaint suffers from inherent defect\n\nnon-complying with \nSection 64\n of BDA Act. Hence, I\n\nanswer Issue No.3 in the affirmative.\n\n 44.ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.1 DATED\n\n03.03.2022 AND ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.1 DATED\n\n15.10.2022 :-\n\n As these issues are inter-related to each other and\n\ninvolves common appreciation of facts and evidence on\n\nrecord, findings on one issue are bearing on other issue,\n\nin order to avoid repetition of facts and for convenience\n\n 34 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nsake, both issues are taken together for common\n\ndiscussion.\n\n 45. It is specific contention of contesting\n\ndefendants that, plaintiffs have not properly valued\n\nsubject matter of suit and they have not paid proper\n\ncourt fees. The plaintiffs have valued subject matter of\n\nsuit at Rs.6 crores. The plaintiffs have valued their\n\n1/3rd share in suit properties at Rs.2 crores.\n\n 46. The learned counsel for defendants argued\n\nthat, suit properties though shown as Survey Numbers,\n\nthey are situated within Municipal Limits or City\n\nCorporation and for the purpose of court fees it is the\n\nmarket value which has to be taken into consideration\n\neven if land continues to be an agricultural land in\n\nrevenue records. \nIn this regard, learned counsel for\n\ndefendants has relied upon decision of Hon'ble High\n\nCourt in W.P.No.188/2016 in case of \nV.N. Manjunath\n\nVs. K.N. Thimmegowda and Others\n, wherein it is held\n\nthat, in respect of agricultural land which falls within\n\nMunicipal Limits or City Corporation and for the\n\npurpose of court fees it is the market value which has to\n\n 35 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nbe taken into consideration even if land continues to be\n\nan agricultural land in revenue records.\n\n 47. The plaintiffs having claimed they are in joint\n\npossession of suit properties and further claim they are\n\nentitled for share in suit properties have paid court fees\n\nunder \nSection 7(2)\n and \nSection 35(2)\n of Karnataka\n\nCourt Fees and Suits Valuation Acts. When, there is no\n\ncontra material placed by defendants and same is not\n\nextracted in cross of P.W.1 that, plaintiffs have not\n\nproperly valued subject matter of suit, valuation of suit\n\nproperties shown by plaintiffs has to be accepted.\n\nHence, I answer Additional Issue No.1 dated\n\n03.03.2022 in the negative and Additional Issue\n\nNo.1 dated 15.10.2022 in the negative.\n\n 48. ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.2 DATED\n\n15.10.2022 :- The contesting defendants in their\n\nwritten statement have contended, suit is bad for non-\n\njoinder of necessary parties. While cross-examining\n\nP.W.1 an attempt was made to suggest, daughter of\n\nSmt. Nanjamma by name Smt. Parvathamma not made\n\nas party to suit.\n\n 36 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\n 49. It is worth to note here that, in suit for\n\npartition all family members are not necessary parties.\n\nIf any person who is head of particular branch is made\n\nas party to suit, that is sufficient, he represents all\n\nmembers of that branch.\n\n 50. Further it is to be noted here, while cross-\n\nexamining P.W.1 it is suggested, there is no person by\n\nname Muniraju. It is well settled proposition of law\n\nthat, suit cannot be dismissed for mis-joinder of parties.\n\nHence, I answer Additional Issue No.2 dated\n\n15.10.2022 in the negative.\n\n 51.ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.3 DATED\n\n15.10.2022 :- It is specific contention of defendants\n\nthat, suit of the plaintiffs is hopelessly barred by law of\n\nlimitation. It is pertinent to note here that, it is not\n\nmentioned by plaintiffs when father of Smt. Lingamma\n\nby name Munishamappa died. No death certificate of\n\nMunishamappa has been produced before the court. If\n\nentire case of plaintiffs is accepted all properties\n\nbelonged to Munishamappa, immediately after death of\n\nMunishamappa, cause of action accrues to Smt.\n\n 37 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nLingamma or plaintiffs to claim share in suit properties.\n\nHerein the case, absolutely there is no material to show,\n\nsuit properties owned and possessed by\n\nMunishamappa.\n\n 52. It is evident from revenue records itself, since\n\n1969 itself name of Sonnappa, thereafter names\n\nMuniyappa, Chikkapaiah, Vekaramanappa, and\n\nNarayanaswamy and names of Smt. Muniyamma and\n\nSmt. Nanjamma have been continued in revenue\n\nrecords pertaining to suit properties. Suit filed in the\n\nyear 2014.\n\n 53. Even assuming for movement, plaintiffs or late\n\nSmt. Lingamma have got any right or interest over suit\n\nproperties, they would have challenged those revenue\n\nrecords within reasonable time. As such, suit is\n\nhopelessly barred by law of limitation. Hence I answer\n\nAdditional Issue No.3 dated 15.10.2022 in the\n\naffirmative.\n\n 54. ISSUES NO.4 TO 6 :- As these issues are\n\ninter-related to each other and involves common\n\nappreciation of facts and evidence on record, findings on\n\n 38 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\none issue are bearing on other issue, in order to avoid\n\nrepetition of facts and for convenience sake, both issues\n\nare taken together for common discussion.\n\n 55. As already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to\n\nestablish their relationship with defendants and\n\nrelationship of late Smt. Lingamma with that of Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma as claimed in plaint.\n\nFurther more, plaintiffs have failed to establish suit\n\nschedule properties were originally acquired by\n\nMunishamappa, who is father of late Smt. Lingamma.\n\nThe plaintiffs have failed to establish, they being joint\n\nowners of suit properties, they are in joint possession\n\nand enjoyment of suit properties along with defendants\n\nNo.1 to 9, 11 and 12. Further more, suit 'A' schedule\n\nproperties already acquired by BDA for formation of\n\nArkavathi Layout. When, plaintiffs are not entitled for\n\nany share in suit properties, question of mesne profits\n\nas prayed by plaintiffs does not arise.\n\n 56. Further it is to be noted here, the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves have pleaded, defendants have sold portion\n\nof schedule properties in the forms of sites to 3 rd parties.\n\n 39 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nThe defendants have specifically contended, Smt.\n\nMuniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma have entered into\n\npartition in respect of Sy.No.43/2 of Dasarhalli Village,\n\nIn this regard, there is no effective cross examination of\n\nD.W.1.\n\n \n57. The D.W.1 has specifically stated, in the year\n\n1950 Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma have\n\neffected partition. The learned counsel for defendants\n\nhas rightly relied upon decision reported in (2016) 12\n\nSCC 288 in case of \nMuddasani Venkata Narasiah\n\n(dead) by LRs Vs. Muddasani Sarojana\n, wherein it is\n\nheld that, cross-examination is a matter of substance\n\nnot of procedure one is required to put one's own\n\nversion in cross-examination of opponent. The effect of\n\nnon cross-examination is that, statement of witnesses\n\nhas not been disputed.\n\n 58. It is to be noted here, though plaintiffs have\n\npleaded, defendants have sold portion of suit properties\n\nin the form of sites but they have not sought for any\n\ndeclaration with regard those sale deeds. On this count\n\nalso, suit of plaintiffs is not maintainable. In this\n\n 40 O.S.No.26411/2014\n\nregard, learned counsel for defendants has relied upon\n\ndecision of Hon'ble High Court in MFA\n\nNO.100407/2021 in case of Sri Omkar S/o.\n\nSambhaji Yadav and Others S. Sambhaji S/o.\n\nMadhu Yadav, wherein it is held that, it is settled\n\nproposition that, even if plaintiffs contents that,\n\nregistered sale deed executed by defendant No.1 in\n\nfavour of defendant No.2 not for family necessity and\n\nthey are bound to ignore said sale deed, they have to\n\nseek a declaration to that effect. Off course, plaintiffs\n\nare not signatories to sale deed in question are not\n\nrequired to seek a decree for setting aside sale deed.\n\nBut, seeking declaration in respect of sale deed is very\n\nmuch necessary. Admittedly, there is no prayer by\n\nplaintiffs in respect of sale deeds executed by\n\ndefendants of sites in suit properties. Suit filed by\n\nplaintiffs is devoid of merits and liable to be dismissed.\n\nHence, I answer issues No.4 to 6 in the negative.\n\n 59.
