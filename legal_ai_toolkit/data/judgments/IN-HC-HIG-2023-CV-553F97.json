Proceedings\n\nunder the\nProtection Of Women from Domestic\n\nViolence Act, 2005\n(for short `the\nDomestic Violence\n\nAct\n') have been initiated by the petitioner wherein the\n\nPetitioner has also sought relief under\nSection 17\nof the\n\nDomestic Violence Act to reside in the shared\n\nhousehold.

Mr. Pratik Y. Jasani, learned advocate for the petitioner\n\nmade the following submissions:\n\n1). Inviting the Court's attention to the Memo of the\n\nApplication filed by the Respondent No.1, Mr Jasani\n\nwould submit that if the prayers of the Application are\n\nperused, the same would indicate that they are\n\nmisconceived. Reading the provisions of\nSection 2(b)\n\nwhich defines \"maintenance\" and also reading the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 23\nof the Senior Citizens Act, he\n\nwould submit that\nSection 23\nof the Act only provides\n\nfor the maintenance of a senior citizen or a parent and\n\nthere is no provision envisaging an order of eviction\n\nand therefore the orders directing eviction of the\n\nPage 4 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nPetitioner are without jurisdiction.\n\n2). Mr. Jasani would further submit that the house is a\n\n\"shared household\" and the petitioner has a right to\n\nreside in the said house. That a complaint is also filed\n\nunder the provisions of the\nDomestic Violence Act\nand\n\nby the order under the\nSenior Citizens Act\n, the right of\n\nthe Petitioner under the\nDomestic Violence Act\ngets\n\nfrustrated.\n\n3). Mr Jasani would submit that complaints have also\n\nbeen filed by the respondent No.1, mother-in-law. He\n\nwould invite the Court's attention to the prayers in the\n\nApplication under the\nDomestic Violence Act\nand\n\nsubmit that therein too a prayer has been made by the\n\nPetitioner that she may not be evicted from the shared\n\nhousehold. He would submit that it is evident from the\n\nperusal of the reply filed by the Petitioner to the\n\nApplication under the\nSenior Citizens Act\nwherein the\n\nPage 5 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nPetitioner has specifically stated that the provisions of\n\nSection 23\nof the Senior Citizens Act would not apply.\n\n4). Mr Jasani would further submit that it is\n\nspecifically pleaded in the Application filed by the\n\nPetitioner under the\nDomestic Violence Act\nthat the\n\nrespondent No.1 or her husband have multiple\n\nproperties at various places.\n\n5). Mr. Jasani inviting the Court's attention to the\n\nfindings of the original order and the appellate order\n\nwould submit that no reasons have been assigned by\n\nboth the authorities and none of the contentions raised\n\nby the Petitioner have been dealt with and therefore\n\nthe orders are non speaking orders and only on this\n\nground deserve to be quashed and set aside.\n\n6). Mr. Jasani would submit that the Petitioner lady is\n\nbeing unnecessarily harassed and as a result of a\n\nPage 6 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\ncomplaint filed by the Petitioner she was arrested and\n\nhad to apply for bail and was ultimately released. That\n\na Chapter case was lodged against her. That a Land\n\nGrabbing Case has been filed against the Petitioner\n\nwherein there was a negative opinion however after\n\nthe impugned orders there has been an attempt at\n\nreopening of the Land Grabbing Case against the\n\nPetitioner.\n\n4. In support of his submissions that the proceedings\n\nunder the Maintenance Act have been initiated purely\n\nwith a view to frustrate the proceedings under the\n\nDomestic Violence Act\n, Mr. Jasani would invite the\n\nCourt's attention to the provisions of\nSection 2(s)\nof the\n\nDomestic Violence Act which defines the term \"shared\n\nhousehold\" read with\nSection 17\nof the Act which deals\n\nwith the right to reside in the shared household. He\n\nwould also read the definition of \"respondent\" as\n\ndefined under\nSection 2(q)\nof the Act.\n\nPage 7 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n5. Mr Jasani would rely on a decision of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of S. Vanitha versus Deputy\n\nCommissioner, Bengaluru Urban District and\n\nOthers reported in 2020 SCC Online 1023 to\n\nsubmit that both the Acts i.e. the Senior Citizens Act\n\nand the Domestic Violence Act have to be read in\n\nharmony and the\nSenior Citizens Act\ncannot deny the\n\npetitioner, her right to reside in the shared household\n\nunder the\nDomestic Violence Act\n. Relying on Paras 1, 2,\n\n6, 9 and Paras 13-20, 22-23 and 38-40 of the\n\nJudgment, Mr. Jasani would submit that the order of\n\neviction made under the\nSenior Citizens Act\nwould\n\ncompletely displace the Petitioner from seeking\n\nrecourse to her remedies under the\nDomestic Violence\n\nAct\nwhich are provided under\nSection 12(1)\nand\nSection\nof the Domestic Violence Act in respect of her\n\npremises which is her shared household as defined\n\nunder\nSection 2(s)\nof the Act. He would submit that the\n\nPage 8 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nSupreme Court in the case has held that the right of a\n\nwoman to secure a residence order in respect of a\n\nshared household cannot be defeated by the simple\n\nexpeditious remedy of an eviction order adopting the\n\nsummary procedure under the\nSenior Citizens Act\n.\n\n6. Mr. Hriday Buch, learned counsel appearing with Mr.\n\nPinank J. Raiyani, learned advocate for the respondent\n\nNo.1 would make the following submissions:\n\n1). Mr. Buch would submit that the property in\n\nquestion which the Petitioner terms as a shared\n\nhousehold is a property purchased and owned by the\n\nMother-In-Law respondent No.1 herein. Mr.Buch would\n\ninvite the Court's attention to the statement made in\n\nthe proceedings under\nSection 498A\nof the Indian Penal\n\nCode that she was residing at Devagam after being\n\nreleased on bail.\n\nPage 9 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n2). Inviting the Court's attention to certain dates he\n\nwould submit that the Respondent No.1 had purchased\n\nthe house in the Year 2007. The Petitioner had left the\n\nmatrimonial house on 15.3.2020. Before the Petitioner\n\nhaving moved out, the husband had filed a complaint\n\nbefore the Gondal Police Station against the wife owing\n\nto her misbehavior. The Respondent No.1 and his\n\nhusband had shifted to a rented premises in December\n\n2019 at Rajkot. Another written complaint had been\n\nfiled by the husband against the Petitioner on\n\n15.3.2020 and pursuant to a Chapter case she was\n\narrested and subsequently released on Bail.\n\n3). Mr.Buch would further submit that on 16.3.2020\n\nthe Petitioner left her matrimonial home and went to\n\nstay with her parents at Vadiya District, Amreli. She\n\nthen lodged an FIR under Section 498A on\n\n20.3.2020.The husband shifted to Rajkot to reside with\n\nhis parents.\n\nPage 10 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n4). Mr Buch would submit that it is the specific case\n\nas is pleaded in the memo of the application that the\n\nPetitioner broke open the lock on 10.7.2020 and\n\nforcibly took over the possession of the property as a\n\nresult of which a complaint was made to the local\n\npolice station and the concerned police officer visited\n\nthe Police Station and when questioned she admitted\n\nthat as she was not having the keys she broke open\n\nthe lock.\n\n5). The Application therefore under\nSection 5\nof the\n\nSenior Citizens Act was filed on 19.7.2021 and the\n\nPetitioner filed the Application under the Domestic\n\nViolence Act on 8.09.2021. He would therefore submit\n\nthat it is incorrect to say that the authorities had\n\nexceeded the jurisdiction in passing the orders.\n\n6). Mr. Buch would distinguish the judgment in the\n\nPage 11 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\ncase of S. Vanitha (Supra) and submit that the\n\nconcept of shared household and the reading of the\n\nprovisions of the two Acts was made in light of the\n\ndistinguished facts where before the Supreme Court\n\nthe property in question was sold/transferred in favour\n\nof the in-law pending the matrimonial disputes\n\nbetween the spouses whereas in the present case the\n\nproperty in question was purchased by the Respondent\n\nNo.1 mother-in-law in the year 2006/2007, 14 years\n\nprior to the matrimonial dispute. The Petitioner has\n\nunauthorizedly broken the lock.\n\n7). Adverting to the provisions of Section 19 of the\n\nDomestic Violence Act and relying on the Additional\n\nAffidavit filed and the one tendered today in Court, Mr.\n\nBuch would submit that the Petitioner has been offered\n\na property and reading Section 19(f) of the Domestic\n\nViolence Act he would submit that the judgment on the\n\nfacts in the case of Vanitha (Supra) would not apply\n\nPage 12 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nas in that case the property was transferred to the in-\n\nlaws pending the matrimonial proceedings and\n\ntherefore the Acts had to be read harmoniously as held\n\nby the Supreme Court. He would read the relevant\n\nparas of the Judgment to satisfy the Court that on the\n\nfacts both the statutes had to be read harmoniously\n\nand therefore once an alternative residence had been\n\noffered, there was no frustration to the rights under\n\nthese provisions as submitted by the Learned Advocate\n\nfor the Petitioner. He would submit that the provisions\n\nof the\nDomestic Violence Act\nparticularly\nSection 19(f)\n\nthereof allows the grant of a relief and strike a balance\n\nbetween the two statutes.\n\n7. Mr. Jay Trivedi, learned AGP for the respondent - State\n\nwould support the Orders passed by the Authorities\n\nunder the Act. He would submit that the\nSenior Citizens\n\nAct\nhas now been amended with effect from the Year\n\n2019.\nSection 2(b)\nof the Act which defines the term\n\nPage 13 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\"maintenance\" includes provision of housing.\n\n8. Having considered the submissions made by the\n\nlearned advocates for the respective parties for the\n\npurposes of the consideration as suggested by the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the case of S.\n\nVanitha (Supra), the facts have to be considered in\n\norder to see that the harmony of the two legislations\n\ni.e. Senior Citizens Act and the Domestic Violence Act\n\nare maintained, especially in light of the concept of\n\n\"shared household\" in the premises in question.\n\n9. The prayers made in the application under the\nSenior\n\nCitizens Act\nhas to be read in the context of the\n\npleadings in the application and not in isolation.\n\n10. The application filed by respondent No.1 factually\n\nindicates that the Petitioner had married in the year\n\n2012. It was the case of the Respondent No.1 mother-\n\nin-law that the premises in question was her self-\n\nPage 14 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nacquired property purchased in the year 2007. The\n\nrespondent No.1 had been residing in the said property\n\nwith her husband. On 28.11.2019 the husband had to\n\nfile a police complaint against the Petitioner owing to\n\nher misbehavior in the matrimonial home. In\n\nDecember, 2019, the parents i.e the Respondent No.1\n\nwith her husband had to shift to a rented premises at\n\nRajkot from Gondal. On 15.3.2020 another written\n\ncomplaint had to be filed by the husband of the\n\nPetitioner regarding the Petitioner's misbehavior as\n\nwell as physical and mental cruelty. A Chapter case\n\nwas therefore filed and the Petitioner was arrested and\n\nthen released on bail. The Petitioner left her\n\nmatrimonial home and went to live with her parents on\n\nand from 16.3.2020.The Petitioner lodged an FIR on\n\n17.3.2020 against the in-laws and her husband under\n\nthe provisions of Section 498A and other provisions of\n\nthe\nIndian Penal Code\nwherein a charge sheet was filed\n\non 25.5.2020.\n\nPage 15 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n11. When these assertions are made by the Respondent\n\nNo.1 in the Application,the assertion of the Petitioner\n\nthat she was evicted from the shared household and\n\nneeded to be given the benefit of restoration of\n\npossession of the premises in question needs to be\n\ntaken with a pinch of salt. The assertion of the\n\nPetitioner's Counsel that there was no question of the\n\nallegation of the Respondent No.1 to have barged into\n\nthe premises of the parents has to be considered in\n\nlight of these facts and the subsequent behaviour of\n\nthe Petitioner which indicates that after the episode\n\nwhere the Parents had to shift out to a rented premises\n\nin Rajkot on 20.3.2020,on 10.7.2020 the Petitioner-wife\n\nbroke open the locks of the premises in question and\n\nforcibly took over the possession of the property of the\n\nRespondent No.1 situated at Gondal. A complaint was\n\nlodged on the same day with the local police station.\n\nWhat is evident from reading the version of the\n\nPage 16 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nstatement made by the Petitioner before the Police\n\nAuthority which has been read by the parties is that\n\nwhen the Petitioner was questioned on the same day\n\nshe stated that as she was not having the keys of the\n\nhouse and therefore she had no alternative but to\n\nbreak open the lock. This clearly proves the manner\n\nand the method in which the Petitioner, in absence of\n\nher in-laws, especially the Respondent No.1 who was\n\ncompelled to shift to a rented premises forcefully took\n\nover the possession of the premises which she asserts\n\nto be a \"shared household\" as comes out from the\n\nsubmissions of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner.\n\nThis has to be again viewed in light of considering the\n\nfact that it was undisputed between the parties that\n\nthe property was a self-acquired property of the\n\nRespondent No.1 herself.\n\n12. Keeping these rival claims in mind, the case whether\n\nthe Orders under challenge are without jurisdiction and\n\nPage 17 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nthe claim of the Petitioner that they are made de hors\n\nthe provisions of\nSection 23\nof the Senior Citizens Act\n\nand whether the relief that has been granted frustrates\n\nthe rights of a woman who has claimed a relief under\n\nthe\nDomestic Violence Act\nhas to be considered.\n\n13. The position of law as discussed in the case of S.\n\nVanitha (Supra) has to be appreciated in the light of\n\nthe facts of the present case and the facts before the\n\nSupreme Court in the decision that it rendered. Since\n\nthe contentions and the facts somewhat are similar\n\nexcept the question of the ownership of the premises\n\nin question the basic facts before the Supreme Court\n\nindicate that the appellant before the Supreme Court\n\nwas the daughter-in-law, who aggrieved by the Orders\n\nof the competent authorities under the\nSenior Citizens\n\nAct\nfiled by her parents-in-law, had approached the\n\nHigh Court challenging the orders of eviction,as is the\n\ncase in the present dispute. Both, the learned Single\n\nPage 18 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nJudge and the Division Bench of the High Court upheld\n\nthe Orders and directed that the appellant ought to\n\nvacate the premises in question. The appellant\n\ntherefore moved the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\n\nof the Constitution Of India.\n\n* The marriage between the Appellant therein and\n\nthe fourth respondent husband had taken place on\n\n30/5/2002, soon thereafter which matrimonial dispute\n\narose. The subject matter of the controversy was a\n\nresidential house. The facts (before the Supreme Court)\n\nindicate that it was that husband who had purchased\n\nthe land on 02/05/2002 a few months before the\n\nmarriage and the allegation of the appellant was the\n\nthe purchase was financed by her father. On\n\n05/10/2006 the husband sold the house to his father\n\nwhich was for the same consideration as was paid by\n\nthe husband at the time of his original purchase in the\n\nyear 2002. The father after constructing the house in\n\nPage 19 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nquestion gifted the house to his wife i.e. the appellant's\n\nmother-in-law on 19/7/2010. In the year 2015, the in-\n\nlaws invoked the provisions of the\nSenior Citizens Act\n\nand filed an Application before the Competent\n\nAuthorities. The appellant filed objections and having\n\nlost in the proceedings, before the Supreme Court\n\ncontended that the authorities had no jurisdiction to\n\norder eviction under\nSection 23\nof the Senior Citizens\n\nAct in view of the protection offered by\nSection 17\nof\n\nthe Protection Of Women from Domestic Violence\n\nAct,2005. It was submitted, as in the present case, that\n\nthe authorities constituted under the\nSenior Citizens\n\nAct\nhad no jurisdiction to secure eviction so as to deny\n\nher claim of a right to reside in the shared household\n\nunder the\nDomestic Violence Act\n. The contention of the\n\nin-laws,like in the case on hand was that the Tribunal\n\nconstituted under the\nSenior Citizens Act\nhad the\n\njurisdiction to pass orders including orders of eviction\n\nas the power has to be read within its jurisdiction.\n\nPage 20 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n14. Considering the scheme of the\nSenior Citizens Act\n, the\n\nSupreme Court found that in the event the senior\n\ncitizens are unable to maintain themselves out of their\n\nown property then they are entitled to make an\n\nApplication under\nSection 4\nof the Act. Considering the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 23\nof the Act, especially\n\nprovisions under sub-section (2) thereof, it held that\n\nthe Tribunal has powers to pass orders of eviction to\n\nensure maintenance as it would be an incident of\n\nenforcement of the right to maintenance. However this\n\nremedy can be granted only after adverting to the\n\ncompeting claims in the dispute. Then in the facts\n\nbefore the Supreme Court as discussed in Paragraph\n\nNo.20 thereof, it specifically found that the land where\n\nthe house had been constructed from which the\n\neviction was sought was originally purchased by the\n\nson of the applicants before the Tribunal. The son had\n\npurchased the property few months before the\n\nPage 21 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nmarriage and the property was subsequently\n\ntransferred by a registered sale deed to his father and\n\nthe fact that it was so transferred for the same\n\nconsideration after a lapse of several years is of\n\nsignificance. The father,in turn executed a deed of gift\n\nin favour of his spouse (mother-in-law of the appellant\n\nbefore the Supreme Court). The assertion of the\n\ndaughter-in-law was that she was living in the house\n\nand was evicted. The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed\n\nthat the transfer which took place cannot be viewed in\n\nisolation from the context of the on-going matrimonial\n\ndispute and the issue was whether she could have\n\nbeen ousted in the manner as from such facts.\n\n* The Supreme Court then went on to consider the\n\naspect of a woman's right to residence, as a safeguard\n\nagainst domestic violence and considering the\n\ndefinition of a \" shared household\" under\nSection 2(d)\n\nof the Domestic Violence Act read with\nSection 19\n\nPage 22 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nthereof considered the aspect of harmonizing the\n\ncompeting reliefs under the Domestic Violence Act and\n\nthe Senior Citizens Act and held that in the event of a\n\nconflict between the special acts, the dominant\n\npurpose of both the statutes would have to be\n\nanalyzed.\n\n* In paragraph No.38 of the decision, the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of S. Vanitha (Supra) observed that\n\nallowing the\nSenior Citizens Act\nto have an overriding\n\neffect in all situations,irrespective of the competing\n\nclaims of a woman to a right in the shared household\n\nwould defeat the purpose of the legislation. In\n\nparagraph No.39, the Supreme Court observed that in\n\nthe event composite dispute is alleged, and the suit\n\npremises is the contestation between the two groups it\n\nwould be appropriate for the Tribunal constituted under\n\nthe\nSenior Citizens Act\nto appropriately mould reliefs,\n\nafter noticing the competing claims of the parties\n\nPage 23 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nclaiming under the Domestic Violence Act and the\n\nSenior Citizens Act.

The\n\nappropriate forum to decide the claim of the appellant\n\nwas therefore under the\nDomestic Violence Act\n.\n\n17. The relevant paras of the decision of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of S. Vanitha (Supra) read as\n\nunder:\n\n\"1 The present dispute arises out of an application filed by\nthe Second and Third respondents against the appellant, who\nis their daughter-in-law. The Second and Third respondents\nare the parents of the Fourth respondent, who is the\nestranged spouse of the appellant. The Second and Third\nrespondents filed an application under the provisions of the\n\nMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act\n\n20071, and inter alia, sought the appellant and her daughter‟s\neviction from a residential house in North Bengaluru.\n\n2 The Assistant Commissioner, and the Deputy Commissioner\nin appeal, allowed the application under the\nSenior Citizens\nAct\n2007 and directed the appellant to vacate the suit\npremises. Aggrieved by this order, the appellant\nunsuccessfully pursued a writ proceeding under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution before a Single Judge, and in appeal before a\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Karnataka. The Division\nBench by its judgment dated 17 September 2019 held that the\n\nPage 27 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nsuit premises belonged to the mother-in-law (the Second\nrespondent) of the appellant and the remedy of the appellant\nfor maintenance and shelter lies only against her estranged\nhusband (the Fourth respondent). The Division Bench upheld\nthe Order of the Deputy Commissioner, and directed the\nappellant to vacate the suit premises before 31 December\n2019. Challenging the jurisdiction of the authorities3 \"\nSenior\nCitizens Act\n2007\" \"suit premises\" The Assistant\nCommissioner, Bengaluru North Sub-Division at Bengaluru and\nthe Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru District PART A to\ndecree her eviction under the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007, the\nappellant has moved this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n3 The appellant and the Fourth respondent were married on\n30 May 2002. Soon thereafter, a matrimonial dispute arose\nbetween the parties. The appellant alleges that she was\nharassed for dowry and even compelled to institute a suit for\npartition against her father in 2003 4 which she later\nwithdrew, after her spouse allegedly deserted her to be in a\nrelationship with another woman. The subject matter of the\ncontroversy is a residential house situated at\nGangondonahalli, Dasanapura, Hobli, Bengaluru North Taluk.\nThe land was purchased by the Fourth respondent on 2 May\n2002, a few months before the appellant married him. The\nappellant alleges that her father had financed a portion of this\npurchase.\n\n4 On 5 October 2006, the Fourth respondent sold the land to\nhis father - the Third respondent. The transaction of sale\nbetween the father and the son was for the same\nconsideration of Rs.1.19 lacs, as was paid by the Fourth\nrespondent for the original purchase of the property in 2002.\nBy then, the appellant and the Fourth respondent had a\ndaughter. In 2009, the Fourth respondent instituted a petition\nfor divorce 5 under\nSection 13(1)(ia)\nand (ib) of\nHindu\nMarriage Act\n1955 before the Senior Civil Judge and Judicial\nMagistrate, First Class, Nelamangala6. The Third respondent,\nfollowing the purchase of the property and after constructing a\nhouse, gifted it to his spouse - the Second respondent, on 19\nJuly 2010. Soon thereafter, on OS 211 of 2003 MC 22 of 2009\n\"Trial Judge\" PART A 17 August 2010, the Second respondent\ninstituted a suit against the appellant 7 before the JMFC,\nNelamangala seeking a permanent injunction restraining the\nappellant from interfering with the possession of the suit\nproperty. The suit is pending. On 5 December 2013, the\npetition for divorce was allowed by the Trial Judge and the\n\nPage 28 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nmarriage between the appellant and the Fourth respondent\nwas dissolved. On 19 March 2014, the appellant instituted a\nproceeding for maintenance. She also filed an appeal before\nthe High Court of Karnataka9 against the dissolution of her\nmarriage by the Trial Judge. The proceedings for divorce and\nmaintenance are also pending.\n\n5 In 2015, the Third and Fourth respondents invoked the\nprovisions of the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 by instituting an\napplication before the Assistant Commissioner, Bengaluru\nNorth Sub Division. Their son (the Fourth respondent) and the\nappellant were impleaded as respondents to the petition. The\nreliefs sought were:\n\n(i) Eviction of the appellant from the suit premises where she\nwas residing;\n\n(ii) A direction to the Fourth respondent to pay an amount of\nRs.15,000 to the parents by way of monthly maintenance; and\n\n(iii) A direction to the appellant and fourth respondent to pay\nan amount quantified at Rs. 25,000 towards legal expenses.\n\n6. The appellant filed an objection to the petition filed\nunder the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007, alleging it to be a\nmalicious proceeding that was instituted with the sole intent\nto evict her from the suit premises. The appellant also claimed\nthat the proceedings were collusive in nature and an attempt\nby the Second and Third respondents and her estranged\nspouse (the Fourth respondent) to evict her from her\nmatrimonial home. The appellant specifically raised an\nobjection to the jurisdiction of the authorities to entertain the\nproceedings seeking her eviction from the premises. She\nsubmitted that while the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 provides for\nthe maintenance of a senior citizen or a parent, there is no\nprovision envisaging an order of eviction, and that the\nauthorities had no jurisdiction to direct her removal from the\npremises.\n\n7. The Assistant Commissioner by an Order dated 25 June\n2015, held that the residential house was the self-acquired\nproperty of the Third respondent which he subsequently gifted\nto the Second Respondent. The appellant was residing in the\nproperty, but was held to have no right or authority. The\nappellant‟s plea for maintenance could (in the view of the\nAssistant Commissioner) only be raised against the Fourth\nrespondent. Therefore, the Assistant Commissioner allowed\n\nPage 29 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nthe petition by directing (i) the Fourth respondent to pay a\nmonthly maintenance of Rs.10,000 to his parents; and (ii) the\nappellant to vacate the premises.\n\n10. The appellant, aggrieved by the judgement of the\nDivision Bench of the High Court, has preferred the present\nspecial leave petition. Mr Yatish Mohan, learned Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that:\n\n(i) The appellant is residing in her matrimonial home as the\nlawfully wedded spouse of the Fourth respondent and she\ncannot be evicted from her shared household, in view of the\nprotection offered by\nSection 17\nof the Protection of Women\nfrom Domestic Violence Act 200511; \"\nPWDV Act\n2005\" PART\nB\n\n(ii) The proceeding under Sections 3 and 4 of the Senior\nCitizens Act 2007 was filed by her mother-in-law and father-in-\n\nlaw in connivance with her estranged spouse to deprive her of\nher matrimonial home;\n\n(iii) The finding of the Division Bench on the appellant‟s\ncurrent residential status was based on a fraudulent set up.\nThe alleged postal cover was dispatched on 21 June 2018,\nduring the pendency of the proceedings before the Single\nJudge, and merely indicated a postal endorsement (\"no such\nperson\") as it arrived when nobody was present at home to\nreceive it;\n\n(iv) The decree for the dissolution of marriage which was\npassed against the appellant by the Trial Judge on 5 December\n2013 has been set aside by the High Court on 14 January 2016\nand the proceedings have been remanded back to the\njurisdictional Family Court for a disposal afresh. Hence, as of\ndate, the appellant continues to be in a lawful relationship of\nmarriage with the Fourth respondent and she has no other\nplace to live except the suit premises, with her minor\ndaughter;\n\n(v) The provisions of the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 have been\nmanipulated to defeat the rights of the appellant. The manner\nin which the premises were transferred by the spouse of the\nappellant to his father and the gift deed thereafter to mother-\nin-law of the appellant are indicative of an attempt to misuse\nthe provisions of the Act, to defeat the claims of the appellant;\nand\n\nPage 30 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n(vi) In asserting her right under\nSection 17\nof the PWDV Act\n2005, the appellant relies on the decision of this Court in\n\nSatish Chander Ahuja vs Sneha Ahuja\n12 . In sum and\nsubstance, it has been urged that the authorities constituted\nunder the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 had no jurisdiction to order\nthe eviction of the appellant. Moreover, the proceedings have\nbeen utilized to secure the eviction of the appellant so as to\ndeny her claim of a right to reside in the shared household\nunder the\nPWDV Act\n2005.\"\n\n12 Dealing with the issue of jurisdiction, Mr Mahale submitted\nthat;\n\n(i) The Tribunal constituted under the\nSenior Citizens Act\nhas the jurisdiction to pass appropriate orders for protecting\nthe life and property of parents and senior citizens, including\norders of eviction;\n\n(ii) The intent and object of the Act is to provide for an\ninexpensive and speedy relief to parents and senior citizens;\n\n(iii) While Chapter II entitles parents and senior citizens to\napply for orders to provide monetary relief for sustenance and\nmaintenance, Chapter V contains provisions for protecting the\nlife and property of parents and senior citizens;\n\n(iv) The Tribunal constituted under the Act has been entrusted\nto issue orders after a summary enquiry, for effective\nmaintenance of parents and senior citizens including relief\nagainst neglect, harassment and protection of the property of\nsenior citizens;\n\n(v)\nSection 23\nconfers two separate and distinct rights:\n\n(a)\nSection 23(1)\nempowers the Tribunal to declare a transfer\nof property by a senior citizen void, where the transfer was\nconditioned upon providing basic amenities and physical\nneeds to a senior citizen, where the transferee fails to provide\nthem;\n\n(b)\nSection 23(2)\nrecognises a pre-existing right of a senior\ncitizen to receive maintenance out of an estate and secures\nthe right of making it enforceable against a transferee who\nhad notice of the right;\n\n(vi) The expression \"maintenance\" in Section 2(b) includes\n\nPage 31 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nprovision for residence and a right to reside can be enforced\nby a senior citizen, if the property is transferred without\nmaking a suitable provision for maintenance; and\n\n(vii) Though the Senior Citizens Act 2007 does not contain an\nexpress provision enabling the Tribunal to pass eviction\norders, the power has to be read within its jurisdiction by\nnecessary implication. Such an interpretation, it has been\nurged, would be purposive, in order to effectuate the\nprovisions of the Act. The contrary view would cause hardship\nto senior citizens who would be powerless, despite being\nforcibly dispossessed of their means of sustenance. Parliament\nhas empowered the State governments to authorize local\nauthorities to take remedial measures for protecting the life\nand property of senior citizens and it would be incorrect to\nlimit the relief that can be granted by a Tribunal only to\nmonetary relief. Relegating a senior citizen to a civil court for\nthe recovery of their property would result in defeating the\nprovisions of the Act. Hence, it has been urged that such an\ninterpretation should not be adopted.\n\n16. A senior citizen, including a parent, who is unable to\nmaintain themselves from their own earning or out of property\nowned by them, is entitled to make an application under\n\nSection 4(i)\n. A parent or grand-parent may make an\napplication against one or more of their children. A childless\nsenior citizen can make an application against a relative\nspecified in\nSection 2(g)\n.\nSection 4\nrecognises a corresponding\nobligation on the part of the children or relative to maintain a\nsenior citizen, extending to such needs as would enable them\nto lead a normal life. In the case of a relative, the obligation is\nif they are in possession of the property of the senior citizen or\nwould inherit property from them. Hence, in the case of the\nchildren of a senior citizen, the obligation to maintain a parent\nis not conditional on being in possession of property of the\nsenior citizen or upon a right of future inheritance.\n\n17 The procedure to be followed by a Maintenance Tribunal\n(constituted under\nSection 7\n) is of a summary nature as\nprovided in\nSection 8(1)\nand with all the powers of a Civil\nCourt, as provided in\nSection 8(2)\n. Under Sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 9\n, where a senior citizen is not able to maintain\nhimself or herself and the children or relatives, as the case\nmay be, neglect or refuse to maintain them, the Tribunal is\nempowered to order them to make a monthly allowance at\nsuch monthly rate for the maintenance of the senior citizen, as\nthe Tribunal may deem fit 18. The amount of the monthly\n\nPage 32 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nallowance can be altered inter alia upon a change in\ncircumstances, under\nSection 10\n.\n\n18 Of particular relevance to the facts of the case at hand\nis Chapter V, which enacts provisions for protecting the life\nand property of a senior citizen.\nSection 23\nproceeds in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\"23. Transfer of property to be void in certain circumstances.\n\n--(1) Where any senior citizen who, after the commencement\nof this Act, has transferred by way of gift or otherwise, his\nproperty, subject to the condition that the transferee shall\nprovide the basic amenities and basic physical needs to the\ntransferor and such transferee refuses or fails to provide such\namenities and physical needs, the said transfer of property\nshall be deemed to have been made by fraud or coercion or\nunder undue influence and shall at the option of the transferor\nbe declared void by the Tribunal.\n\n(2) Where any senior citizen has a right to receive\nmaintenance out of an estate and such estate or part thereof\nis transferred, the right to receive maintenance may be\nenforced against the transferee if the transferee has notice of\nthe right, or if the transfer is gratuitous; but not against the\ntransferee for consideration and without notice of right.\n\n(3) If, any senior citizen is incapable of enforcing the rights\nunder sub-sections (1) and (2), action may be taken on his\nbehalf by any of the organisation referred to in Explanation to\nsub-section (1) of\nsection 5\n.\"\n\n19. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 23\ncovers a situation where\nproperty has been transferred after the enactment of the\nlegislation by a senior citizen (by gift or otherwise) subject to\nthe condition that the transferee must provide the basic\namenities and physical needs to the transferor. In other words,\nSub-section (1) deals with a situation where the transfer of the\nproperty is accompanied by a specific condition to provide for\nthe maintenance and needs of a senior citizen. In such an\nevent, if the transferee fails to provide the maintenance and\nphysical needs, the transfer of the property is deemed to have\nbeen vitiated by fraud, coercion or under undue influence.\nSub-\nsection 1\n, in PART C other words, creates a deeming\nfiction of the law where the transfer of the property is subject\nto a condition and the condition of providing for maintenance\nand the basic needs of a senior citizen is not fulfilled by the\n\nPage 33 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nperson upon whom the obligation is imposed. Then, at the\noption of the transferor, the transfer can be declared as void\nby the Tribunal. On the other hand, Sub-section (2) of\nSection\nenvisages a situation where a senior citizen has a right to\nreceive maintenance out of an estate. Where such a right\nexists, the right of maintenance can be enforced where the\nestate or a portion of it, is transferred against a transferor who\nhas notice of the right; or if the transfer is gratuitous. The right\nhowever cannot be enforced against a transferee for\nconsideration and without notice of the right. Now, Sub-section\n(1) of\nSection 23\nenvisages a situation where the transfer of\nproperty is by the senior citizen. This is evident from the\nlanguage of sub-Section (1) namely \"where any senior citizen\nwho, after the commencement of this Act, has transferred by\nway of gift or otherwise, his property...\". On the other hand,\nsub-Section (2) of\nSection 23\ndoes not confine itself to a\ntransfer by a senior citizen, unlike sub-Section (1). Sub-\nSection (2) uses the expression \"such estate or part thereof is\ntransferred\". Where a senior citizen has a right to receive\nmaintenance out of the estate and any part of it is transferred,\nsub-\nsection 2\npermits the enforcement of the right to receive\nmaintenance out of the estate against a transferee with notice\nor against a gratuitous transferee. Sub-Section (2), in other\nwords, may cover a situation where the transfer of the estate\n(in which a senior citizen has a right to maintenance) is by a\nthird party, in which event, the provision provides the right to\nenforce the claim of maintenance against such transferee\n(other than those transferees for consideration PART C or\nwithout notice of the pre-existing right). Arguably, the\nlanguage of sub-section (2) is broad enough to also cover a\nsituation where the transfer is by the senior citizen, in which\nevent the transferee with notice of the right; or a gratuitous\ntransferee, can be made subject to the enforcement of the\nright against the transferred estate. Another distinction\nbetween sub-Section (1) and sub-Section (2) of\nSection 23\n\nmust also be noticed. Under sub-Section (1), where a transfer\nhas been made by a senior citizen subject to the condition\nthat the transferee will provided for basic amenities or\nphysical needs of the transferor and if there is a failure of the\ntransferee to fulfil the condition, two consequences follow: (i)\nthe transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made\nby fraud or coercion or under undue influence; and (ii) the\ntransfer shall, at the option of the transferor, be declared to be\nvoid by the Tribunal. The deeming consequence which is\nprovided for in sub-Section (1) is not incorporated in sub-\nSection (2). Sub-Section (2), in contradistinction, stipulates\nthat the right to receive maintenance can be enforced against\n\nPage 34 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\na gratuitous transferee or a transferee with notice of the pre-\nexisting right of a citizen to receive maintenance out of an\nestate notwithstanding who is the transferee of the estate. In\nkeeping with the salutary public purpose underlying the\nenactment of the legislation, the expression „transfer‟ would\ninclude not only the absolute transfer of property but also\ntransfer of a right or interest in the property. This would also\nbe in consonance with the provisions of\nSection 2(f)\nwhich\ndefines the expression property to include \"rights or interests\nin such property\". The expression „transfer‟ not having been\ndefined specifically by the legislation, it must receive an\ninterpretation which would advance the beneficent object and\npurpose of its provisions. Sub-section (2) of PART C\nsection 23\n\nspeaks of the enforcement of the \"right to receive\nmaintenance\" which is more comprehensive in its nature, than\nmerely enforcing an order for maintenance passed under\n\nSection 9\nof the Act.\n\n20 The substance of sub-Section (2) of\nsection 23\n, as\nsubmitted by the Second and Third respondents, is that the\nTribunal had the jurisdiction to pass an order directing the\neviction of the appellant who is their daughter-in-law.\nAccording to the submission, the power to order eviction is\nimplicit in the provision guaranteeing a „right to receive\nmaintenance out of an estate‟ and the enforcement of that\nright. In supporting the submission, they have referred to the\nview which has been taken by several High Courts, indicating\nthat the Tribunal may order the eviction of a child or a relative\nfrom the property of a senior citizen, where there has been a\nbreach of the obligation to maintain the senior citizen. The\nTribunal under the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 may have the\nauthority to order an eviction, if it is necessary and expedient\nto ensure the maintenance and protection of the senior citizen\nor parent. Eviction, in other words would be an incident of the\nenforcement of the right to maintenance and protection.\nHowever, this remedy can be granted only after adverting to\nthe competing claims in the dispute. It is necessary to\nrecapitulate that the situation in the present case is that the\neviction was sought of the daughter-in-law, i.e. the appellant.\nThe land, where the house has been constructed, was\noriginally purchased by the son of the applicants who are\nseeking eviction of their daughter-in- law. The son had\npurchased the property a few months before his marriage to\nthe appellant. He had subsequently transferred the property\nby a registered sale deed to PART D his father and the fact\nthat it was for the same consideration after the lapse of\nseveral years is of significance. The father, in turn, executed a\n\nPage 35 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\ngift deed in favor of his spouse. The appellant has asserted\nthat she had been living in the house, as her matrimonial\nresidence, until the application was filed. Her spouse has\n(according to her) deserted her and their minor daughter and\nleft them in the lurch. The electricity to the premises was\ndisconnected for non-payment of dues. Their daughter has\nsought admission to an engineering degree course however\nher father- Fourth respondent has not provided any financial\nsupport. The transfers which took place cannot be viewed in\nisolation from the context of the on-going matrimonial dispute\nwhich has taken place. The issue is whether the appellant as\nthe daughter-in-law and the minor daughter could have been\nousted in the above manner.\n\nD A woman's right of residence: safeguard against\ndomestic violence\n\n21 In arriving at a decision of this issue it becomes necessary\nto elucidate the right, which is asserted by the appellant. The\nappellant has submitted that the premises constitute a\n\"shared household\" within the meaning of\nSection 2(s)\nof the\nPWDV Act 2005.\nSection 2(s)\ndefines the expression \"shared\nhousehold\" in the following terms:\n\n\"(s) \"shared household\" means a household where the person\naggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic\nrelationship either singly or along with the respondent and\nincludes such a household whether owned or tenanted either\njointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent, or owned\nor tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the\naggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly\nhave any right, title, interest or equity and includes such a\nhousehold which may belong to the joint family of which the\nPART D respondent is a member, irrespective of whether the\nrespondent or the aggrieved person has any right, title or\ninterest in the shared household;\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n22.\nSection 19\ncontemplates the passing of a residence\norder by the Magistrate on an application under sub-Section\n(1) of\nSection 12\nof the PWDV Act 2005. The essence of the\nsubmission of the appellant is that the order of eviction which\nhas been made in the exercise of the summary powers\nentrusted by the\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 would completely\ndisplace the appellant from seeking recourse to her remedies\nunder\nSection 12(1)\nread with\nSection 19\nof the PWDV Act\n2005 in respect of the premises, which she claims to be her\nshared household. The definition of the expression \"shared\n\nPage 36 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nhousehold\" in\nSection 2(s)\nuses the familiar legislative formula\nof a \"means and includes\" definition. Where the definition of\nan expression in an enactment adopts a „means and includes‟\nstipulation, it is intended to be exhaustive. The „means‟ part\nof the definition indicates what would normally fall within the\nambit of the expression, while the „includes‟ element gives it\nan extended meaning. Together they indicate that the\nlegislature has provided for an exhaustive 19. Residence\norders- 1) While disposing of an application under sub-section\n(1) of\nsection 12\n, the Magistrate may, on being satisfied that\ndomestic violence has taken place, pass a residence order -\n\n(a) restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any\nother manner disturbing the possession of the aggrieved\nperson from the shared household, whether or not the\nrespondent has a legal or equitable interest in the shared\nhousehold; (b) directing the respondent to remove himself\nfrom the shared household; (c) restraining the respondent or\nany of his relatives from entering any portion of the shared\nhousehold in which the aggrieved person resides; (d)\nrestraining the respondent from alienating or disposing off the\nshared household or encumbering the same; (e) restraining\nthe respondent from renouncing his rights in the shared\nhousehold except with the leave of the Magistrate; or (f)\ndirecting the respondent to secure same level of alternate\naccommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in\nthe shared household or to pay rent for the same, if the\ncircumstances so require: Provided that no order under clause\n\n(b) shall be passed against any person who is a woman. PART\nD enumeration of what falls within the ambit of the definition.\nJustice G P Singh in his seminal treatise on the Principles of\nStatutory Interpretation21 observes:\n\n\"The Legislature has the power to define a word even\nartificially. So the definition of a word in the definitions section\nmay either be restrictive of its ordinary meaning or it may be\nextensive of the same. When a word is defined to „mean‟\nsuch and such, the definition is prima facie restrictive and\nexhaustive.\"\n\n30. The meaning which has been attributed above to the\nplain language of the definition is in consonance with the\njudgment of the three judge Bench in Satish Chandra where it\nhas been explained as follows:\n\n\"55...the definition can be divided in two parts, first, which\nfollows the word \"means\" and second which follows the word\n\"includes\". The second part which follows \"includes\" can be\n\nPage 37 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nfurther sub-divided in two parts. The first part reads \"shared\nhousehold means a household where the person aggrieved\nhas lived or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship\neither singly or along with the respondent\". Thus, first\ncondition to be fulfilled for a shared household is that person\naggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic\nrelationship. The second part subdivided in two parts is- (a)\nincludes such a household whether owned or tenanted either\njointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent and PART\nD owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which\neither the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly\nor singly have any right, title, interest or equity and\n\n(b)includes such a household which may belong to the joint\nfamily of which the respondent is a member, irrespective of\nwhether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any\nright, title or interest in the shared household. In the above\ndefinition, two expressions, namely, \"aggrieved person\" and\n\"respondent\" have occurred. From the above definition,\nfollowing is clear:- (i) it is not requirement of law that\naggrieved person may either own the premises jointly or\nsingly or by tenanting it jointly or singly; (ii) the household\nmay belong to a joint family of which the respondent is a\nmember irrespective of whether the respondent or the\naggrieved person has any right, title or interest in the shared\nhousehold; and (iii) the shared household may either be\nowned or tenanted by the respondent singly or jointly.\"\n\n31. After noticing the ambit of the definition of „shared\nhousehold‟ and the object and purpose of the\nPWDV Act\nof\n2005, Justice Ashok Bhushan noted: \"\nSection 2(s)\nread with\n\nSections 17\nand\nof Act, 2005 grants an entitlement in\nfavour of the woman of the right of residence under the\nshared household irrespective of her having any legal interest\nin the same or not.\"\n\n32. The expression „respondent‟ has been defined in\n\nsection 2 (q)\nof the PWDV Act of 2005 in the following terms:\n\n\"(q) \"respondent\" means any adult male person who is, or has\nbeen, in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved person\nand against whom the aggrieved person has sought any relief\nunder this Act:\"\n\n33. Noticing the above definition and the provisions of\n\nsection 2(s)\n, the Court in Satish Chandra held: \"64...The\ndefinition of shared household as noticed in\nSection 2(s)\ndoes\nnot indicate that a shared household shall be one which\nbelongs to or taken on rent by the husband. We have PART E\n\nPage 38 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nnoticed the definition of \"respondent\" under the Act. The\nrespondent in a proceeding under\nDomestic Violence Act\ncan\nbe any relative of the husband. In [the] event, the shared\nhousehold belongs to any relative of the husband with whom\nin a domestic relationship the woman has lived, the conditions\nmentioned in\nSection 2(s)\nare satisfied and the said house will\nbecome a shared household.\"\n\n34. The Bench concluded that:\n\n\"84...The definition of shared household given in\nSection 2(s)\n\ncannot be read to mean that shared household can only be\nthat household which is household of the joint family of which\nhusband is a member or in which husband of the aggrieved\nperson has a share.\"\n\nE Harmonising competing reliefs under the\nPWDV Act\n\n2005 and\nSenior Citizens Act\n35.\nSection 3623\nof the PWDV Act 2005 stipulates that the\nprovisions of the Act shall be in addition to, and not in\nderogation of, the provisions of any other law for the time\nbeing in force. This is intended to ensure that the remedies\nprovided under the enactment are in addition to other\nremedies and do not displace them.\nThe Maintenance and\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act\n2007 is\nundoubtedly a later Act and as we have noticed earlier,\n\nSection 3\nstipulates that its provisions will have effect,\nnotwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other\nenactment. However, the provisions of\nSection 3\nof the Senior\nCitizens Act 2007 giving it overriding force and effect, would\nnot by themselves be conclusive of an intent to deprive a\nwoman who claims a right in a shared household, as under the\n\nPWDV Act\n36-Act not in derogation of any other law- The\nprovisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in\nderogation of the provisions of any other law, for the time\nbeing in force PART E 2005. Principles of statutory\ninterpretation dictate that in the event of two special acts\ncontaining non obstante clauses, the later law shall typically\nprevail.\n24 In the present case, as we have seen, the Senior\nCitizen‟s Act 2007 contains a non obstante clause. However,\nin the event of a conflict between special acts, the dominant\npurpose of both statutes would have to be analyzed to\nascertain which one should prevail over the other. The primary\neffort of the interpreter must be to harmonize, not excise. A\ntwo-judge bench of this Court, in the case of\nBank of India v.\nKetan Parekh25\n, in examining a similar factual scenario,\n\nPage 39 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nobserved that:\n\n\"28. In the present case, both the two Acts i.e. the Act of 1992\nand the Act of 1993 start with the non obstante clause.\n\nSection 34\nof the Act of 1993 starts with non obstante clause,\nlikewise Section 9-A (sic 13) of the Act of 1992. But\nincidentally, in this case Section 9-A came subsequently i.e. it\ncame on 25-1- 1994. Therefore, it is a subsequent legislation\nwhich will have the overriding effect over the Act of 1993. But\ncases might arise where both the enactments have the non\nobstante clause then\nin that case\n, the proper perspective\nwould be that one has to see the subject and the dominant\npurpose for which the special enactment was made and in\ncase the dominant purpose is covered by that contingencies,\nthen notwithstanding that the Act might have come at a later\npoint of time still the intention can be ascertained by looking\nto the objects and reasons. However, so far as the present\ncase is concerned, it is more than clear that\nSection 9-A\nof the\nAct of 1992 was amended on 25-1-1994 whereas the Act of\n1993 came in 1993. Therefore, the Act of 1992 as amended to\ninclude Section 9-A in 1994 being subsequent legislation will\nprevail and not the provisions of the Act of 1993.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n38. The above extract indicates that a significant object of\nthe legislation is to provide for and recognize the rights of\nwomen to secure housing and to recognize the right of a\nwoman to reside in a matrimonial home or a shared\nhousehold, whether or not she has any title or right in the\nshared household. Allowing the Senior Citizens Act 2007 to\nhave an overriding force and effect in all situations,\nirrespective of competing entitlements of a woman to a right\nin a shared household within the meaning of the\nPWDV Act\n\n2005, would defeat the object and purpose which the\nParliament sought to achieve in enacting the latter legislation.\nThe law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to\nensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their\nPART E children or relatives. Equally, the purpose of the\nPWDV\nAct\n2005 cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory\ninterpretation. Both sets of legislations have to be\nharmoniously construed. Hence the right of a woman to\nsecure a residence order in respect of a shared household\ncannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an\norder of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under\nthe\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007.\n\n39. This Court is cognizant that the\nSenior Citizens Act\nPage 40 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nwas promulgated with a view to provide a speedy and\ninexpensive remedy to senior citizens. Accordingly, Tribunals\nwere constituted under\nSection 7\n. These Tribunals have the\npower to conduct summary procedures for inquiry, with all\npowers of the Civil Courts, under\nSection 8\n. The jurisdiction of\nthe Civil Courts has been explicitly barred under\nSection 27\nof\nthe Senior Citizens Act 2007. However, the over-riding effect\nfor remedies sought by the applicants under the\nSenior\nCitizens Act\n2007 under\nSection 3\n, cannot be interpreted to\npreclude all other competing remedies and protections that\nare sought to be conferred by the\nPWDV Act\n2005.\nThe PWDV\nAct\n2005 is also in the nature of a special legislation, that is\nenacted with the purpose of correcting gender discrimination\nthat pans out in the form of social and economic inequities in\na largely patriarchal society. In deference to the dominant\npurpose of both the legislations, it would be appropriate for a\nTribunal under the\nSenior Citizens Act, 2007\nto grant such\nremedies of maintenance, as envisaged under\nS.2(b)\nof the\nSenior Citizens Act 2007 that do not result in obviating\ncompeting remedies under PART E other special statutes, such\nas the\nPWDV Act\n2005.\nSection 2627\nof the PWDV Act\nempowers certain reliefs, including relief for a residence order,\nto be obtained from any civil court in any legal proceedings.\nTherefore, in the event that a composite dispute is alleged,\nsuch as in the present case where the suit premises are a site\nof contestation between two groups protected by the law, it\nwould be appropriate for the Tribunal constituted under the\n\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007 to appropriately mould reliefs, after\nnoticing the competing claims of the parties claiming under\nthe\nPWDV Act\n2005 and\nSenior Citizens Act\n2007.\nSection 3\nof\nthe Senior Citizens Act, 2007 cannot be deployed to over-ride\nand nullify other protections in law, particularly that of a\nwoman‟s right to a „shared household‟ under\nSection 17\nof\nthe PWDV Act 2005. In the event that the \"aggrieved woman\"\n\nobtains a relief from a Tribunal constituted under the\nSenior\nCitizens Act\n2007, she shall duty-bound to inform the\nMagistrate under the\nPWDV Act\n2005, as per Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 26\nof the PWDV Act 2005. This course of action would\nensure that the common intent of the\nSenior Citizens Act\nand the\nPWDV Act\n2005- of ensuring speedy relief to its\nprotected groups who are both vulnerable members of the\nsociety, is effectively realized. Rights in law can translate to\nrights in life, only if there is an equitable ease in obtaining\ntheir realization. 26. Relief in other suits and legal\nproceedings. --(1) Any relief available under\nsections 18\n,\n,\n,\nand\nmay also be sought in any legal proceeding,\nbefore a civil court, family court or a criminal court, affecting\n\nPage 41 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nthe aggrieved person and the respondent whether such\nproceeding was initiated before or after the commencement of\nthis Act. (2) Any relief referred to in sub-section (1) may be\nsought for in addition to and along with any other relief that\nthe aggrieved person may seek in such suit or legal\nproceeding before a civil or criminal court. (3) In case any\nrelief has been obtained by the aggrieved person in any\nproceedings other than a proceeding under this Act, she shall\nbe bound to inform the Magistrate of the grant of such relief.\nPART E\n\n40. Adverting to the factual situation at hand, on construing\nthe provisions of sub- Section (2) of section 23 of the Senior\nCitizen Act 2007, it is evident that it applies to a situation\nwhere a senior citizen has a right to receive maintenance out\nof an estate and such estate or part thereof is transferred. On\nthe other hand, the appellant‟s simple plea is that the suit\npremises constitute her „shared household‟ within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(s)\nof the PWDV Act 2005. We have also\nseen the series of transactions which took place in respect of\nthe property: the spouse of the appellant purchased it in his\nown name a few months before the marriage but\nsubsequently sold it, after a few years, under a registered sale\ndeed at the same price to his father (the father-in-law of the\nappellant), who in turn gifted it to his spouse i.e. the mother-\nin-law of the appellant after divorce proceedings were\ninstituted by the Fourth respondent. Parallel to this, the\nappellant had instituted proceedings of dowry harassment\nagainst her mother-in-law and her estranged spouse; and her\nspouse had instituted divorce proceedings. The appellant had\nalso filed proceedings for maintenance against the Fourth\nrespondent and the divorce proceedings are pending. It is\nsubsequent to these events, that the Second and Third\nrespondents instituted an application under the\nSenior Citizens\nAct\n2007. The fact that specific proceedings under the\nPWDV\nAct\n2005 had not been instituted when the application under\nthe\nSenior Citizens Act, 2007\nwas filed, should not lead to a\nsituation where the enforcement of an order of eviction\ndeprives her from pursuing her claim of entitlement under the\nlaw. The inability of a woman to access judicial remedies may,\nas this case exemplifies, be a consequence of destitution,\nignorance or lack of resources. Even otherwise, we are clearly\nof the view that recourse to the summary PART F procedure\ncontemplated by the Senior Citizen Act 2007 was not available\nfor the purpose of facilitating strategies that are designed to\ndefeat the claim of the appellant in respect of a shared\nhousehold. A shared household would have to be interpreted\n\nPage 42 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nto include the residence where the appellant had been jointly\nresiding with her husband. Merely because the ownership of\nthe property has been subsequently transferred to her in-laws\n(Second and Third Respondents) or that her estranged spouse\n(Fourth respondent) is now residing separately, is no ground to\ndeprive the appellant of the protection that was envisaged\nunder the\nPWDV Act\n\nF Summation\n\n41. For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion\nthat the claim of the appellant that the premises constitute a\nshared household within the meaning of the\nPWDV Act\nwould have to be determined by the appropriate forum. The\nclaim cannot simply be obviated by evicting the appellant in\nexercise of the summary powers entrusted by the\nSenior\nCitizens Act\n2007. The Second and Third Respondents are at\nliberty to make a subsequent application under\nSection 10\nof\nthe Senior Citizens Act 2007 for alteration of the maintenance\nallowance, before the appropriate forum. For the above\nreasons, while allowing the appeal, we issue the following\ndirections: (i) The impugned judgment and order of the\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Karnataka dated 17\nSeptember 2019 affirming the order of PART F eviction\nagainst the appellant shall stand set aside with the\nconsequence that the order of the Assistant Commissioner\nordering and directing the appellant to vacate the suit\npremises shall stand set aside; (ii) We leave it open to the\nappellant to pursue her remedies under the\nPWDV Act\n2005.\nFor that purpose, it would be open to the appellant to seek the\nhelp of the District Legal Services Authorities and if the\nappellant does so, all necessary aid and assistance shall be\nfurnished to her in pursuing her legal remedies and rights; (iii)\nIA 111352/2020 for restoration of the electricity connection is\nallowed by directing the Fourth respondent to take all\nnecessary steps for restoration of the electricity connection to\nthe premises within a period of two weeks from the receipt of\na certified copy of this judgment. The Fourth respondent shall\nalso continue to pay the electricity dues in future; and (iv) In\norder to enable the appellant to pursue her remedies under\nthe\nPWDV Act\n2005, there shall be an order and direction\nrestraining the respondents from forcibly dispossessing the\nappellant, disposing of the premises or from creating any\nright, title and interest in favor of any third party in any\nmanner whatsoever for a period of one year, to enable the\nappellant to pursue her remedies in accordance with law. The\nappellant is at liberty to move the Court to espouse her\n\nPage 43 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nremedies PART F under the\nPWDV Act\n2005 for appropriate\norders, including interim protections.\"\n\n18. On facts on hand what is indicative is that it is not\n\ndisputed that the site of the contestation that is the\n\npremises in question was purchased by the mother-in-\n\nlaw herself prior to the marriage entered into between\n\nthe Petitioner and her son. The property was purchased\n\nin the year 2006 whereas the marriage was solemnized\n\nin the year 2012.\n\n19. The Petitioner as a result of her misbehavior faced a\n\nChapter Case where she was arrested and\n\nsubsequently released on bail and then she moved out\n\nof the matrimonial house. The mother-in-law had\n\nalready been compelled to stay in a rented premises at\n\nRajkot before the Petitioner moved out of the property\n\nthat belonged to the mother-in-law. Therefore the\n\nPetitioner was not a part of the \"shared household\"\n\nwhen the Application under the\nDomestic Violence Act\n\nPage 44 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nor the\nSenior Citizens Act\nwere filed. In fact the mother-\n\nin-law had filed the Application under the\nSenior\n\nCitizens Act\non 19.7.2021 and thereafter the Petitioner\n\nfiled an Application under the\nDomestic Violence Act\non\n\n08.09.2021.\n\n20. What was also an undisputed fact that the husband had\n\nlocked the house on 15.3.2020 after filing a complaint\n\nwhere the Petitioner was arrested, released on bail and\n\nwent to reside at her parents' residence. On a\n\nsubsequent date, it has come on record that when the\n\nPetitioner filed a complaint before the Police\n\nAuthorities,she admitted that as she could not have the\n\nkeys of the household she broke open the lock and\n\nentered the suit premises. This was also corroborated\n\nby the statements given by the neighbours of the\n\nhousehold that belonged to the mother-in-law.\n\n21. The distinguishing feature that stares on the face of the\n\nPage 45 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nfacts that are distinct from the facts before the\n\nSupreme Court are as under:\n\na). The property was found in the ownership of the\n\nmother-in-law before the Hon'ble Supreme Court by \"a\n\nseries of transactions which took place in respect of the\n\nproperty: the spouse of the appellant having purchased\n\nit in his own name a few months before the marriage\n\nbut subsequently sold it, after a few years, under a\n\nregistered sale deed at the same price to this father\n\n(the father-in-law of the appellant), who in turn gifted it\n\nto his spouse i.e. the mother-in-law of the appellant\n\nafter the divorce proceedings were initiated\" by the\n\nhusband.\n\n(b) In the present case the property admittedly was\n\nowned by the mother-in-law before marriage and she\n\nhad to move out and shift to Rajkot before the\n\nPetitioner moved out of the shared household after a\n\nPage 46 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\npolice complaint was filed. The Petitioner therefore had\n\ndeprived the mother-in-law of the property owned by\n\nher and admittedly after having left too moved in after\n\nbreaking open the lock and therefore the eviction of\n\nthe Petitioner was necessary as she had moved in\n\ncontrary to law after breaking open the lock.\n\n22. The composite dispute therefore as observed by the\n\nSupreme Court has to be decided and the relief has to\n\nbe moulded accordingly considering the harmony\n\nbetween the two competing statutes. It is here that the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 19\nof the Domestic Violence Act\n\ncome into play.\n\n23. Apart from\nSection 17\n,\nSection 19(1)(f)\nprovides that\n\nwhile disposing of an application under\nSection 12\nof\n\nthe Domestic Violence Act the Magistrate may on being\n\nsatisfied that the domestic violence has taken place\n\npass a residence order directing that the respondent\n\nPage 47 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nsecure the same level of alternative accommodation\n\nfor the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the\n\nshared household or pay rent for the same, if the\n\ncircumstances so require. In the present proceedings,\n\nan Affidavit has been filed by the respondent that the\n\nhusband ,the \"respondent\" as defined, under the\n\nDomestic Violence Act\nhas offered to provide the wife,\n\n\"aggrieved person\" so defined a separate residence by\n\nrenting a property in the area of the Petitioner's choice\n\nwithin the Gondal Town which is an accommodation of\n\nthe same level. A further affidavit has been filed during\n\nthe course of the proceedings today that several open\n\nplots of land were purchased by the Petitioner and one\n\nSonal Savaliya holding 50% share over the said\n\nproperty. After purchasing the property, several\n\ntenements have been raised on the land four of which\n\nhave remained unsold which are in the ownership of\n\nthe petitioner and Sonal Savaliya. The Respondent\n\nNo.1 further states that with a view to put an end to\n\nPage 48 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nthe litigation,out of those 4 tenements on which the\n\npetitioner holds 50% of the share, Ms Sonal Savaliya is\n\nwilling to relinquish her right in favour of the Petitioner\n\nin respect of 2 tenements of the Petitioner's choice\n\nwithin a week from today and the husband of the\n\npetitioner is willing to provide all the suitable\n\nnecessities i.e. Bed, Sofa, Television, Refrigerator,\n\nWashing Machine, water heater as well as all necessary\n\nrequirements for functioning of the kitchen in one of\n\nthe said tenements of the Petitioner's choice, The case\n\nof moulding the relief in order to ensure that the\n\nremedies provided under the enactment are in addition\n\nto the other remedies and do not displace them has to\n\nbe considered.\n\n24. In the facts as before this Court it is not a case where\n\nthe right of the Petitioner is defeated by the mother-in-\n\nlaw in securing an order of eviction adopting the\n\nsummary procedure under the\nSenior Citizens Act\n.\n\nPage 49 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\nHere is a case where unlike the facts before the\n\nSupreme Court, the property belonged to the mother-\n\nin-law and she was compelled to move out to a\n\ntenanted premises and had to lock her own premises.\n\nThe Petitioner forcibly moved in to the premises in\n\nquestion after breaking the lock after having shifted to\n\nher parental home. This was therefore a clear case\n\nwhere the mother-in-law had a right to have her\n\npossession restored and a decree of eviction needed to\n\nbe passed in light of the provisions of\nSection 23\nof the\n\nSenior Citizens Act.\n\n25. The moulding of a relief in harmony of competing\n\ndisputes have to be viewed accordingly. The relief has\n\nto be accordingly moulded. It is clear that initially the\n\nhusband of the Petitioner had offered a rented\n\naccommodation. An affidavit is on record. Even during\n\nthe course of proceedings, a further affidavit of which\n\nthe offer has been narrated are put on record which is\n\nPage 50 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023\n\nC/SCA/6618/2022 JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\na sufficient compliance of\nSection 19(1)(f)\nof the\n\nDomestic Violence Act.\n\n26. Therefore the orders of the competent authority dated\n\n09.11.2021 and 21.03.2022 are hereby confirmed. The\n\npetition is dismissed. Rule is discharged. Interim relief\n\nstands vacated. No costs.\n\n27. Mr. Pratik Y. Jasani, learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nrequests that by virtue of the order dated 4.4.2020 by\n\nwhich parties were directed to maintain status-quo be\n\ncontinued for a period of four weeks. At the request of\n\nMr. Jasani, learned counsel for the petitioner, the order\n\nof status-quo shall continue till 03.02.2023.\n\nSd/-\n\n(BIREN VAISHNAV, J)\nVATSAL\n\nPage 51 of 51\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jan 17 20:41:25 IST 2023",
