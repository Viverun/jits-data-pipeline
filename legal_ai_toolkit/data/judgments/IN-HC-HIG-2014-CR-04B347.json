JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR MITTAL\nHON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE SNEH PRASHAR\n\nPresent: Mr. Vikas Kumar, Advocate for the appellant.\nMr. Shiv Kumar, Advocate for the respondent.\n\nAjay Kumar Mittal,J.\n\n1. This appeal has been preferred by the appellant - husband\n\nagainst the judgment and decree dated 3.10.2013 passed by the trial\n\ncourt, whereby the petition filed by him under\nsection 13\nof the Hindu\n\nMarriage Act, 1955 (in short, \"the Act\") for dissolution of marriage on the\n\ngrounds of cruelty and desertion has been dismissed.\n\n2. A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy\n\ninvolved as available on the record may be noticed. Marriage between\n\nthe parties was solemnized on 8.7.1992 according to Hindu rites and\n\nceremonies. The appellant was under JBT training from 28.9.1992 to\n\nJuly 1994 and came into government job on 14.10.1995. No issue was\n\nborn out of the said wedlock. The parties lastly resided together as\n\nhusband and wife at the house of the appellant at Aurangabad. The\n\nmarriage was simple. From the very beginning, behaviour of the\n\nrespondent was not good towards the appellant and his family members.\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -2-\n\nShe was interested to live in her parental house. The appellant is\n\nM.A.B.Ed and physically handicapped person. The respondent never\n\nliked him and disregarded him. She also wanted to live separately with\n\nthe appellant from his parents. The appellant even accepted her demand\n\nand started living at house No.756 w.e.f 22.10.1995. Despite that, her\n\nbehaviour did not change. She used to curse the appellant to be a\n\nhandicapped person. On 18.12.1997, she gave beating to the appellant\n\nwith lathi blows. A complaint dated 18.12.1997 was lodged by the\n\nappellant against the respondent. In 1999, the respondent left the\n\nmatrimonial home. On the request of the appellant and his family\n\nmembers, she came back. On 14.10.2000, she again left the\n\nmatrimonial home. The appellant felt shocked when he and his family\n\nmembers were got involved in a false criminal case by lodging FIR dated\n\n27.3.2001 by the respondent under\nSections 498A\n,\n,\nIPC. The\n\nappellant was arrested on 4.4.2001 and remained in jail for four days till\n\n8.4.2001 before getting bail. However, the appellant and his family\n\nmembers were acquitted vide order dated 28.7.2010 by the trial court.\n\nThe appeal filed by the respondent against acquittal was also dismissed.\n\nShe filed application under\nsection 125\nCr.PC for maintenance. She was\n\ngranted Rs.3000/- per month as maintenance which was paid by the\n\nappellant regularly. The respondent also filed complaint under\nsections\n/\nIPC against the appellant and his family members which was\n\nalso dismissed. Ultimately, the appellant filed petition under\nSection 13\n\nof the Act for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty and\n\ndesertion. Upon notice, the respondent appeared and filed written\n\nstatement controverting the averments made in the petition. The trial\n\ncourt after examining the entire evidence on record dismissed the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -3-\n\npetition vide impugned judgment and decree dated 3.10.2013. Hence\n\nthe instant appeal by the appellant husband.\n\n3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\nthe record.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the appellant husband submitted that\n\nthe trial court erred in law in dismissing the petition under\nsection 13\nof\n\nthe Act filed by the appellant. The respondent wife is living separately\n\nsince 14.10.2000. No issue was born out of the wedlock. Her behaviour\n\ntowards the appellant and his family members was not good from the\n\nvery beginning. She had no intention to live with the appellant. She used\n\nto curse the appellant being a handicapped person. The behaviour of the\n\nrespondent caused mental cruelty to the appellant. Reliance was placed\n\non judgments in\nVidhya Vishwanathan vs. Kartik Balakrishnan\n, 2014\n\n(4) RCR 563 and Vishwanath Agrawal vs. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal,\n\n(2012) 7 SCC 288.\n\nIn view of pronouncement of the Apex Court in\n\nK.Srinivas Rao vs. D.A.Deepa\n, (2013) 5 SCC 226, it was contended\n\nthat cruelty was caused by the respondent-wife as false criminal\n\ncomplaint filed by her against the appellant and his family members had\n\nresulted in their acquittal in proceedings under\nsection 406\n,\n498A\n,\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code and the appellant is entitled to the grant of\n\ndivorce.\n\n5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent\n\nsupported the impugned judgment and decree.\n\n6.\nSection 13(1)(ia)\nof the Act empowers the Court to dissolve\n\nthe matrimonial ties between the parties by a decree of divorce on a\n\npetition by either spouse where the said spouse has been treated with\n\ncruelty after the solemnization of the marriage. Cruelty has not been\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -4-\n\ndefined in the Act but various pronouncements of the Apex Court and\n\nother High Courts have outlined the scope of the term 'cruelty'. Cruelty\n\nis evident where one spouse treats the other and manifests such\n\nfeelings towards him or her as to cause reasonable apprehension that it\n\nwill be harmful or injurious to live with the other spouse. Cruelty may be\n\nphysical or mental. Whether a spouse is inflicted with physical cruelty or\n\nnot, it can be judged on the basis of direct evidence whereas mental\n\ncruelty is to be inferred on analyzing the factual matrix of each case and\n\ndrawing conclusion thereon.\n\n7. Further, in\nVidhya Vishwanathan\n's case (supra), it was\n\nheld by the Apex Court as under:-\n\n\"13.\nIn\nVinita Saxena vs. Pankaj Pandit\n(2006) 3\n\nSCC 778 regarding legal proposition on aspect of\n\ncruelty has made the following observations:\n\n\"31. It is settled by a catena of decisions that\n\nmental cruelty can cause even more serious\n\ninjury than the physical harm and create in the\n\nmind of the injured appellant such apprehension\n\nas is contemplated in the section. It is to be\n\ndetermined on whole facts of the case and the\n\nmatrimonial relations between the spouses. To\n\namount to cruelty, there must be such wilful\n\ntreatment of the party which caused suffering in\n\nbody or mind either as an actual fact or by way\n\nof apprehension in such a manner as to render\n\nthe continued living together of spouses harmful\n\nor injurious having regard to the circumstances\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -5-\n\nof the case.\n\n32. The word \"cruelty\" has not been defined\n\nand it has been used in relation to human\n\nconduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct in\n\nrelation to or in respect of matrimonial duties\n\nand obligations. It is a course of conduct and\n\none which is adversely affecting the other. The\n\ncruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or\n\nunintentional. There may be cases where the\n\nconduct complained of itself is bad enough and\n\nper se unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the\n\ninjurious effect on the other spouse need not be\n\nenquired into or considered. In such cases, the\n\ncruelty will be established if the conduct itself is\n\nproved or admitted.\"\n\n8. Still further, in Vishwanath Agrawal's case (supra), it was\n\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"24.\nIn\nShobha Rani v. Madhukar Reddi\n, while\n\ndealing with 'cruelty' under\nSection 13(1)(ia)\nof the\n\nAct, this Court observed that the said provision does\n\nnot define 'cruelty' and the same could not be defined.\n\nThe 'cruelty' may be mental or physical, intentional or\n\nunintentional. If it is physical, the court will have no\n\nproblem to determine it. It is a question of fact and\n\ndegree. If it is mental, the problem presents difficulty.\n\nThereafter, the Bench proceeded to state as follows:\n\n\"4.....First, the enquiry must begin as to the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -6-\n\nnature of the cruel treatment. Second, the\n\nimpact of such treatment on the mind of the\n\nspouse. Whether it caused reasonable\n\napprehension that it would be harmful or\n\ninjurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a\n\nmatter of inference to be drawn by taking into\n\naccount the nature of the conduct and its effect\n\non the complaining spouse. There may,\n\nhowever, be cases where the conduct\n\ncomplained of itself is bad enough and per se\n\nunlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the\n\ninjurious effect on the other spouse need not be\n\nenquired into or considered. In such cases, the\n\ncruelty will be established if the conduct itself is\n\nproved or admitted.\"\n\n25. After so stating, this Court observed in\nShobha\n\nRani\ncase about the marked change in life in modern\n\ntimes and the sea change in matrimonial duties and\n\nresponsibilities. It has been observed that:\n\n\"5.... when a spouse makes a complaint about\n\ntreatment of cruelty by the partner in life or\n\nrelations, the court should not search for\n\nstandard in life. A set of facts stigmatized as\n\ncruelty in one case may not be so in another\n\ncase. The cruelty alleged may largely depend\n\nupon the type of life the parties are accustomed\n\nto or their economic and social conditions. It\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -7-\n\nmay also depend upon their culture and human\n\nvalues to which they attach importance.\"\n\n26. Their Lordships in\nShobha Rani\ncase referred\n\nto the observations made in Sheldon v. Sheldon\n\n(1966) 2 WLR 993, wherein Lord Denning stated, \"the\n\ncategories of cruelty are not closed\".\n\nThereafter, the\n\nBench proceeded to state thus: (\nShobha Rani\ncase,\n\n(1988) 1 SCC 105) SCC p. 109, paras 5-6)-\n\n\"5. ......Each case may be different. We deal\n\nwith the conduct of human beings who are not\n\ngenerally similar. Among the human beings\n\nthere is no limit to the kind of conduct which\n\nmay constitute cruelty. New type of cruelty may\n\ncrop up in any case depending upon the human\n\nbehaviour, capacity or incapability to tolerate\n\nthe conduct complained of. Such is the\n\nwonderful (sic) realm of cruelty.\n\n6. These preliminary observations are\n\nintended to emphasise that the court in\n\nmatrimonial cases is not concerned with ideals\n\nin family life. The court has only to understand\n\nthe spouses concerned as nature made them,\n\nand consider their particular grievance. As Lord\n\nRied observed in Gollins v. Gollins, 1964 AC\n\n644:\n\n\"....In matrimonial affairs we are not dealing with\n\nobjective standards, it is not a matrimonial\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -8-\n\noffence to fall below the standard of the\n\nreasonable man (or the reasonable woman).\n\nWe are dealing with this man or this woman.\"\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n27.\nIn\nV. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat (Mrs.\n), (1994) 1 SCC\n\n337, a two-Judge Bench referred to the amendment\n\nthat had taken place in\nSections 10\nand\n13(1)(ia)\nafter\n\nthe Hindu Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 and\n\nproceeded to hold that the earlier requirement that\n\nsuch cruelty has caused a reasonable apprehension\n\nin the mind of a spouse that it would be harmful or\n\ninjurious for him/her to live with the other one is no\n\nlonger the requirement. Thereafter, this Court\n\nproceeded to deal with what constitutes mental cruelty\n\nas contemplated in\nSection 13(1)(ia)\nand observed\n\nthat mental cruelty in the said provision can broadly\n\nbe defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the\n\nother party such mental pain and suffering as would\n\nmake it not possible for that party to live with the\n\nother. To put it differently, the mental cruelty must be\n\nof such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be\n\nexpected to live together. The situation must be such\n\nthat the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to\n\nput up with such conduct and continue to live with the\n\nother party. It was further observed, while arriving at\n\nsuch conclusion, that regard must be had to the social\n\nstatus, educational level of the parties, the society\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -9-\n\nthey move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties\n\never living together in case they are already living\n\napart and all other relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nWhat is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty\n\nin another case and it has to be determined in each\n\ncase keeping in view the facts and circumstances of\n\nthat case. That apart, the accusations and allegations\n\nhave to be scrutinized in the context in which they are\n\nmade. Be it noted, in the said case, this Court quoted\n\nextensively from the allegations made in the written\n\nstatement and the evidence brought on record and\n\ncame to hold that the said allegations and counter\n\nallegations were not in the realm of ordinary plea of\n\ndefence and did amount to mental cruelty.\n\n28.\nIn\nPraveen Mehta v. Inderjit Mehta\n, (2002) 5\n\nSCC 706, it has been held that mental cruelty is a\n\nstate of mind and feeling with one of the spouses due\n\nto behaviour or behavioural pattern by the other.\n\nMental cruelty cannot be established by direct\n\nevidence and it is necessarily a matter of inference to\n\nbe drawn from the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase. A feeling of anguish, disappointment, and\n\nfrustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of the\n\nother can only be appreciated on assessing the\n\nattending facts and circumstances in which the two\n\npartners of matrimonial life have been living. The facts\n\nand circumstances are to be assessed emerging from\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -10-\n\nthe evidence on record and thereafter, a fair inference\n\nhas to be drawn whether the Petitioner in the divorce\n\npetition has been subjected to mental cruelty due to\n\nthe conduct of the other.\n\n29 In\nVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate v. Neela\n\nVijaykumar Bhate\n(2003) 6 SCC 334, it has been\n\nopined that a conscious and deliberate statement\n\nlevelled with pungency and that too placed on record,\n\nthrough the written statement, cannot be so lightly\n\nignored or brushed aside.\n\n30.\nIn\nA. Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur\n, (2005) 2 SCC\n\n22, it has been ruled that the question of mental\n\ncruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms\n\nof marital ties of the particular society to which the\n\nparties belong, their social values, status and\n\nenvironment in which they live. If from the conduct of\n\nthe spouse, it is established and/or an inference can\n\nlegitimately be drawn that the treatment of the spouse\n\nis such that it causes an apprehension in the mind of\n\nthe other spouse about his or her mental welfare, then\n\nthe same would amount to cruelty. While dealing with\n\nthe concept of mental cruelty, enquiry must begin as\n\nto the nature of cruel treatment and the impact of such\n\ntreatment in the mind of the spouse.\nIt has to be seen\n\nwhether the conduct is such that no reasonable\n\nperson would tolerate it.\n\n31.\nIn\nVinita Saxena v. Pankaj Pandit\n, (2006) 3\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -11-\n\nSCC 778, it has been ruled that as to what constitutes\n\nmental cruelty for the purposes of\nSection 13(1)(ia)\n\nwill not depend upon the numerical count of such\n\nincident or only on the continuous course of such\n\nconduct but one has to really go by the intensity,\n\ngravity and stigmatic impact of it when meted out\n\neven once and the deleterious effect of it on the\n\nmental attitude necessary for maintaining a conducive\n\nmatrimonial home.\n\n32.\nIn\nSamar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh\n, (2007) 4 SCC\n\n511, this Court, after surveying the previous decisions\n\nand referring to the concept of cruelty, which includes\n\nmental cruelty, in English, American, Canadian and\n\nAustralian cases, has observed that the human mind\n\nis extremely complex and human behaviour is equally\n\ncomplicated. Similarly, human ingenuity has no\n\nbound, therefore, to assimilate the entire human\n\nbehaviour in one definition is almost impossible. What\n\nis cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in the\n\nother case. The concept of cruelty differs from person\n\nto person depending upon his upbringing, level of\n\nsensitivity, educational, family and cultural\n\nbackground, financial position, social status, customs,\n\ntraditions, religious belief, human values and their\n\nvalue system. Apart from this, the concept of mental\n\ncruelty cannot remain static; it is bound to change with\n\nthe passage of time, impact of modern culture through\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -12-\n\nprint and electronic media and value system, etc. etc.\n\nWhat may be mental cruelty now may not remain\n\nmental cruelty after a passage of time or vice versa.\n\nThere can never be any straitjacket formula or fixed\n\nparameters for determining mental cruelty in\n\nmatrimonial matters. The prudent and appropriate\n\nway to adjudicate the case would be to evaluate it on\n\nits peculiar facts and circumstances.\n\n33.\nIn\nSuman Kapur v. Sudhir Kapur\n, (2009) 1 SCC\n\n422, after referring to various decisions in the field,\n\nthis Court took note of the fact that the wife had\n\nneglected to carry out the matrimonial obligations and\n\nfurther, during the pendency of the mediation\n\nproceeding, had sent a notice to the husband through\n\nher advocate alleging that he had another wife in USA\n\nwhose identity was concealed. The said allegation\n\nwas based on the fact that in his income-tax return,\n\nthe husband mentioned the \"Social Security Number\"\n\nof his wife which did not belong to the wife, but to an\n\nAmerican lady. The husband offered an explanation\n\nthat it was merely a typographical error and nothing\n\nelse. The High Court had observed that taking undue\n\nadvantage of the error in the \"Social Security\n\nNumber\", the wife had gone to the extent of making\n\nserious allegation that the husband had married an\n\nAmerican woman whose \"Social Security Number\"\n\nwas wrongly typed in the income-tax return of the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -13-\n\nhusband. This fact also weighed with this Court and\n\nwas treated that the entire conduct of the wife did\n\ntantamount to mental cruelty.\"\n\n9.\nIn\nK.Srinivas Rao\n's case (supra), similar view was taken.\n\n10. A perusal of the record shows that the marriage of the\n\nappellant with the respondent was solemnized in the year 1992. No\n\nissue was born out of the wedlock. The appellant being a physically\n\nhandicapped person, the respondent used to curse him. She never liked\n\nhim. She even gave beating to him with lathi. From the very beginning,\n\nher attitude was not good towards the appellant and his family members.\n\nShe always wanted to live in her parental house whenever the appellant\n\nwas on training. She left the matrimonial home several times and on the\n\nefforts made by the appellant and his family members, she used to come\n\nback. She finally left the matrimonial home on 14.10.2000 and had\n\ndeserted the husband. Further, her complaint under\nsections 498A\n,\n,\nIPC against the appellant and his family members was dismissed.\n\nEven appeal against the aforesaid order was also dismissed. Her\n\ncomplaint under\nsections 494\n/\nIPC remained unsuccessful. The trial\n\ncourt thus was not right in dismissing the petition filed by the appellant\n\nhusband. It has been authoritatively held by the Apex Court in\nK.\n\nSrinivas Rao\n's case (supra) and a Division Bench of this Court in\n\nImlesh v. Amit\n, AIR 2014 Punjab and Haryana 89 that where the wife\n\nfiles false criminal complaint against the husband and his family\n\nmembers under\nSections 406\n,\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code which\n\nresults in their acquittal, this act of the wife causes mental cruelty and\n\nthe husband is entitled to a decree of divorce under\nSection 13(1)(ia)\nof\n\nthe Act. Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, we\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\nFAO-M-347 of 2013 -14-\n\ndo not find any ground to uphold the findings recorded by the trial court.\n\nAs a result, we set aside the impugned judgment and decree dated\n\n3.10.2013. The appeal filed by the appellant stands allowed.
