The present petition is filed under\nSection 439\n\nof Cr.P.C after this court rejected the anticipatory bail of\n\nthe petitioners by order dated 08.03.2021 and on\n\n01.09.2021.\n\n3. The brief facts of the case are as under :-\n\nAccused/petitioners are the father-in-law and\n\nmother-in-law of victim-Mallamma. Mallamma was married\n\nto Bheemrayagouda on 24.05.2020 at Paramanand\n\nTemple, Hebbal Village as per Hindu rights and customs. It\nis contended in the complaint that a sum of `1.00 lakh\n\ncash and 6 tolas of gold and other household articles were\n\ngiven as dowry at the time of marriage by the parents of\n\nMallamma. Complaint averments further reveal that after\n\ntwo months of marriage there was a further demand of\n\ndowry and the same was not met by the parents of\n\nMallamma, the accused persons including the present\n\npetitioners started harassing Mallamma physically and\n\nmentally. When the same was noticed by the brother of\n\nMallamma, he visited the house of the accused and\n\nassured the petitioners and their son that after the cotton\n\ncrop is harvested, the demand would be met and\n\nrequested the petitioners and the husband of Mallamma to\n\ntreat Mallamma properly.\n\n4. When the matter stood thus, on 06.01.2021 at\n\nabout 1.00 p.m. Mallamma and her husband visited the\n\ncomplainant's house. In the evening there was a talk\n\nregarding further demand of cash and gold. After finishing\n\nthe dinner Mallamma and her husband were made to stay\nin another house belonging to the complainant wherein a\n\nshop is also situated. On 07.01.2021 as usual Mallamma\n\ngot up early and came back to the house of the\n\ncomplainant to attend the household work. Since her\n\nhusband did not visit the house of the complainant she\n\nwent back to the house where they stayed previous night.\n\nComplainant also reached the shop around 8.45 a.m. and\n\nnoticed that Mallamma's husband were in a hurry to move\n\nsomewhere in a car. Being suspicious about his unusual\n\nbehavior, complainant enquired his son-in- law\n\nBheemrayagouda as to where he is going. However, he\n\nreplied that he is going to Hebbal. Being suspicious about\n\nhis conduct, complainant went inside the house adjacent to\n\nthe shop and noticed that Mallamma had torn out her tali\n\nand feeling uncomfortable. On further enquiry Mallamma\n\nrevealed that her husband has again demanded additional\n\ndowry and also abused her and being frustrated in life she\n\nhas consumed pesticide. Immediately she was shifted to\n\nthe hospital with the help of others. However, despite the\n\nbest treatment she succumbed in the hospital at about\n10.30 a.m on 07.01.2021 and accordingly a complaint\n\ncame to be lodged against the Bheemrayagouda and his\n\nparents who are the petitioners in this case.\n\n5. Police after registering the case for the\n\noffences punishable under\nSection 498A\nand\n304B\nread\n\nwith\nSection 34\nof IPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry\n\nProhibition Act, completed the investigation and filed\n\ncharge sheet. The matter is now pending before the\n\njurisdictional court for adjudication. In the meantime, the\n\npetitioners approached the District Court for grant of bail.\n\nSame came to be rejected. Thereafter, the petitioners are\n\nbefore this court.\n\n6. In the petition, following grounds have been\n\nraised :-\n\nx That, Petitioners are innocent, they have been involved in\nthis case just to harassing them with the ill motive and with\npersonal vendetta.\n\nx That, looking into complaint averments and entire charge\nsheet materials, one month prior to the date of alleged\nincident, the deceased came to the parental house and\nafter three days husband being accused No.1 came to the\nparental house of the deceased, wherein deceased\ncommitted suicide by consuming insecticide in the parental\nhome itself making allegation against accused No.1\nhusband with regard to demand of dowry, cruelty and\nabetment to commit suicide. So, to attract the\nSec.304 (B)\n\nof IPC, the allegation of cruelty or harassment should be\ncaused \"soon before her death\". Hence, so for as\npetitioners are concerned absolutely there are no materials\nto attract the provisions of\nSec.304(B)\nof IPC.\n\nx That, looking into the complaint averments and entire\ncharge sheet materials absolutely there are no materials\nagainst the petitioners with regard to abetting to commit\nthe suicide. Since as on the date of alleged incident\npetitioners were in their village. So, to attract the provisions\nof Sec 306 of\nIPC\n, the intention of the accused to aid or\ninstigate or abet the deceased persons to commit suicide\nis must. Hence, thee benefit of bail may kindly be extended\nto the petitioners.\n\nx That, both the petitioners are suffering from old age\naliments and both are sick, petitioner No.2 further suffering\nwith knee problem and for that it is difficult for her to attend\nthe nature call. Hence, the benefit of bail as provided\nunder proviso to U/s 437 of\nCr.P.C\n. may kindly be\nextended to the petitioners. 12. That, presumptions with\nregard to\nSec.304 (B)\n&\nof IPC would come into\npicture only when, prosecution proved its case with regard\nto fact relating to dowry harassment and cruelty. Hence,\nwhile considering the bail application, the presumption of\nlaw with regard to dowry death and abetment while suicide\nwould not come in the way commit to considering the bail\napplication, the presumption of law with regard to dowry\ndeath and abetment while suicide would not come in the\nway commit to considering the bail application.\n\nx That, the alleged offences are not punishable with death or\nlife imprisonment.\n\nx That, investigation is completed and charge sheet is filed.\nthe in interference question of is Hence, there no\ninvestigation.\n\nx That, petitioners were voluntarily Surrendered on 15-12-\n2021. Since, then they are in judicial custody.\n\nx That, petitioners hails from respected family and they are\nhaving movable and immovable properties. Hence, there is\nno question of fleeing away from justice.\n\nx That, petitioners are ready and willing to abide by any\nstringent conditions, if imposed by this Hon'ble Court, while\nenlarging them on bail.\n\nx That, petitioners are ready to furnish the surety as directing\nby this Hon'ble Court.\n\n7. Reiterating the above grounds learned Senior\n\nCounsel Sri Ashok Haranahalli vehemently contended that\n\nthe petitioners had no role whatsoever in the incident\n\ninasmuch as the incident has occurred in the parental\nhouse. He also contended that the petitioners are aged\n\n59 and 48 years respectively and they had no role\n\nwhatsoever in the alleged incident of harassment and since\n\nthe investigation is completed, continuation of the accused\n\nin the judicial custody is no longer warranted.\n\n8. He also pointed out that further continuation of\n\nthe petitioners in the custody would amount to pre-trial\n\nconviction and sought for grant of bail. He also assured\n\nthat any conditions that would be imposed by this court for\n\nthe smooth trial would be adhered to by the petitioners\n\nand sought for grant of bail.\n\n9. Per contra, learned High Court Government\n\nPleader opposes the grant of bail by contending that\n\ndespite best efforts, the petitioners are not available to the\n\ninvestigating agency. He also contended that conduct and\n\nrole played by the petitioners have been stated by the\n\nprosecution witnesses with graphic details before the\n\ninvestigating agency in a clear and categorical terms which\n\nwould indicate their role in the incident. In view of the fact\nthat the charge sheet witnesses have consistently stated\n\nabout the additional demand of dowry and the present\n\npetitioners have joined hands with Bheemrayanagouda\n\nwho is the husband of the deceased in harassing\n\nMallamma which ultimately resulted in committing suicide\n\nby Mallamma and therefore, the prosecution prima facie\n\nenjoys the presumption available to the prosecution under\n\nSection 113A\nand\n113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act and\n\ntherefore, the petitioners are required to make out special\n\ngrounds to seek an order of grant of bail and from the\n\ngrounds urged in the bail petition, no such special grounds\n\nare made out and thus sought for dismissal of the bail\n\npetition.\n\n10. In the light of the arguments put-forth on\n\nbehalf of the parties, this court meticulously considered\n\nthe materials available on record.\n\n11. It is settled principles of law that at the time of\n\nconsidering the bail petition, this court cannot hold a mini\n\ntrial to find out the merits or demerits of the case as the\nsame may prejudice the case of the parties one way or the\n\nother. Suffice to say that the materials available on record\n\nclearly indicate that there was harassment to Mallamma in\n\nthe matrimonial house which ultimately resulted in\n\nMallamma visiting the house of her parents. There was a\n\ndiscussion a day earlier to the incident as to the additional\n\ndemand of dowry. The brother of Mallamma had also\n\nassured the Bheemrayagouda and his parents that\n\nadditional dowry amount would be met soon after the\n\nharvesting of the cotton crop. When the matter stood thus,\n\neven after assuring that the additional dowry amount\n\nwould be met by the complainant party, on 07.01.2021, in\n\nthe early hours of morning, Mallamma visited the parental\n\nhouse and again visited the place of incident. When\n\ncomplainant also visited the place of incident, he found\n\naccused in the place of incident and his behavior were\n\nsuspicion immediately complainant gone inside the place of\n\nincident and found that Mallamma had consumed\n\npesticides. The statement given by Mallamma to the\n\ncomplainant assumes a greater importance in deciding the\ncase of the parties. This court at this stage need not\n\nconsider the evidentiary value or probative value of such\n\nstatements as the same may prejudice the case of the\n\nparties. It is for the trial court to decide after full-fledged\n\ntrial whether the prosecution has made out a case to\n\nattract the offence under\nSection 498A\nand\n304B\nof IPC or\n\nnot.\n\n12. Suffice to say, in view of the presumption\n\navailable to the prosecution under\nSection 113A\nand\n113B\n\nof the Indian Evidence Act, this court is of the considered\n\nopinion that the grounds urged in the petition are not\n\nsufficient to classify them or special reasons for this court\n\nto exercise the discretionary power vested in it under\n\nSection 439\nof Cr.P.C so as to accept the request for grant\n\nof bail.\n\n13. For the forgoing discussions, this court pass\n\nthe following :\n\nORDER\n\nCriminal petition is rejected.\nHowever, taking note of the fact that the incident is\n\nof the year 2021 the trial court is directed to expedite the\n\ntrial.\n\nThe dismissal of the bail petition shall not come in\n\nthe way of the petitioners seeking grant of bail with\n\nsuccessive bail application if there are positive changed\n\ncircumstances in the case.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nsn",
