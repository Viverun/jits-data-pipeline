The order dated 22nd April, 2016 passed by this Court in Bail Appln.\nNo.1645/2015 reads as under:-\n\n\"Crl.M.A.No.19024/2015 (by the complainant for impleadment)\nVide this application, the complainant seeks her\nimpleadment in the bail application. Keeping in view the nature\nof the offence, the application is allowed. The complainant be\nimpleaded as respondent No.2 in the application.

However, interim order qua the husband of the\ncomplainant is subject to return of the passport.\"\n\n2. Facts leading to passing of the order dated 22nd April, 2016 by this\nCourt are that two FIRs were got registered by the complainant against the\napplicant Ajit Singh Sambhi and his family members being FIR Nos.\n15/2015 under\nSections 313\n/\nIPC registered at PS Sunlight Colony and\n799/2015 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nIPC registered at PS Hari Nagar.\n\n3. In FIR No.799/2015 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nIPC registered\nat PS Hari Nagar, anticipatory bail applications were filed by the family\nmembers of the applicant i.e. Gurinder Mohan Singh Sambhi, Ramanjeet\nSambhi, parents of the applicant and Gurmukh Singh Sambhi, brother of the\napplicant before the learned Additional Sessions Judge which were\ndismissed vide order dated 6th August, 2015. Hence the three of them filed\nbail application before this Court being Bail Appln. No.1645/2015 which\ncame up for hearing before this Court on 14 th August, 2015 wherein this\nCourt passed the following order:-\n\n\"BAIL APPLN. 1645/2015\n\nThe petitioners before this Court are father-in-law,\nmother-inlaw and brother-in-law of the complainant. The\ncomplainant had been married to the son of petitioner nos.1 and\n\n2. Parties had been married on 04.12.2013. Contention in the\ncomplaint besides harassment qua the petitioners and her\nhusband for dowry demand was that she was forced into an\nabortion for which she had filed a complaint pursuant to which\nFIR under\nSections 313\n/\nof the IPC. Learned senior counsel\nfor petitioners states that the petitioners have been granted bail\nin that matter. The present FIR has been registered under\n\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nof the IPC. It is stated that\ncomplainant is living separately from her husband since\n19.12.2014. This Court has been informed that her husband\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 3 of 15\n\n(Dr.Ajit Singh Sambhi) is a British citizen and is living in London\nand has taken up a job in London. He is a dentist by profession.\n\nIt is further submitted that the husband is ready to join\ninvestigation and the parties can work out an amicable\nsettlement. He is under coercive pressure and he is apprehending\narrest that he has not come to India.\n\nDr.Ajit Singh Sambhi will be present in Court on the next\ndate; he will appear before the Delhi High Court Mediation and\nConciliation Centre for mediation proceedings on 25.8.2015 and\nthereafter on all subsequent dates as and when summoned by the\nMediator. The petitioners shall also join investigation and the\nmediation proceedings.\n\nNeedless to state that the complainant shall also join the\nmediation proceedings on the aforesaid date and thereafter on all\nsubsequent dates as and when summoned by the Mediator.\n\nTill the next date no arrest.\n\nDr.Ajit Singh Sambhi shall also not be arrested. He shall\nappear before the Investigating Officer if so required.\n\nInvestigating Officer shall inform the concerned\nauthorities as the learned senior counsel for the petitioners states\nthat a LOC has been issued against Dr.Ajit Singh Sambhi.\"\n\n4. In FIR No.15/2015 under\nSections 313\n/\nIPC an application was\nfiled by Gurinder Mohan Singh, father of the applicant seeking directions to\nthe investigating officer to file status report depicting stage of investigation.\nOne more application was filed with the prayer that proceedings under\n\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. against the applicant Ajit Singh Sambhi be stayed. On\nthese two applications on 24th August, 2015 learned Metropolitan Magistrate\npassed the following order:-\n\n\"An application filed on behalf of the applicant-Dr. Gurinder\nMohan Singh Sambhi for seekingdirections to the IO and call for\nstatus report/ATR.\n\nReply filed.\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 4 of 15\n\nThe present application is filed with the prayer for directing\nthe IO to file his status report depicting the stage of investigation.\nAnother application has also been filed with a prayer that\nproceedings U/s 82\nCr.P.C\n. be stayed against applicant-Ajit Singh.\nHowever, orally the Ld. Counsel for applicant-Dr.G.M.S. Sambhi\nand Sh.A.S. Sambhi has also prayed that in the present case, the\nIO has to file a report against son of applicant-Sh. A.S. Sambhi for\nexecution of process U/S 82\nCr.P.C\n. on 30.09.2015 and that LOC\nof the accused in the present case has been issued and has prayed\nrelief on two counts:-\n\n1. Process U/s 82\nCr.P.C\n. be stayed against accused-A.S.\nSambhi.\n\n2. LOC against the accused be cancelled.\n\nIt is stated that LOC has been issued on intimation of the IO to\nthe concerned authority and the grounds prayed for the relief are\nas follows:-\n\n1. The accused has not received any notice to join the\ninvestigation as he has residing abroad and no steps have been\ntaken with the M.E.A. to serve the notice abroad in London\nwhere the accused is residing. Even the IO has not countered\nthis submission of the applicant and the father of the\ncomplainant has also not submitted on this point.\n\n2. The Hon'ble High Court has granted relief to the applicant\nthat he shall not be arrested and the IO will inform the\nconcerned authority as LOC has been issued against the\napplicant and the applicant needs to join the mediation\nproceedings which are slated for hearing in Hon'ble High\nCourt on 25.08.2015 and said order made in another FIR case\nlodged U/s 498A,406.506/34 PS: Hari Nagar lodged at the\ninstance of the complainant will be frustrated if the applicant\nis not allowed to depart by the immigration at the Airport.\n\nI agree with the submission of the Ld. Counsel if the same is\nverified on the record and I stayed the proceedings U/s 82\nCr.P.C\n.\nagainst the applicant and LOC against the applicant is cancelled,\nsubject to the following conditions:-\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 5 of 15\n\n1. The process U/s 82\nCr.P.C\n. is stayed for a period of two\nweeks and the LOC is cancelled so that the applicant may join the\nmediation proceedings. Process U/s 82\nCr.P.C\n. is stayed till\n07.09.2015.\n\n2. The IO is at liberty to impound the passport of the\napplicant in the interest of justice and smooth investigation.\n\nSeparate copy of the order be provided to the IO for the\nrecord and also to the applicant if so prayed.\"\n\n5. The order dated 24th August, 2015 was followed by order dated 14th\nSeptember, 2015 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate in FIR\nNo.15/2015 as under:-\n\n\"None for accused despite several calls even till 1.15 pm.\nCase was listed as a miscellaneous matter which are taken\nup at 12.30 pm and previous hearing i.e. on 24.08.2015,\n07.09.2015, 10.09.2015, 11.09.2015 were also done at 12.30 pm.\nVide order dated 24.08.2015 process\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. against\napplicant Ajit Sambhi was stayed on two conditions firstly that the\napplicant will join the mediation proceedings and that IO may\nimpound the passport. Today report was called from the IO\nwhether the passport has been impounded. It is pertinent to note\nthat LOC has been opened against the accused which was\ncancelled vide order dated 24.08.2015 and at the same time liberty\nwas granted to the IO to impound the passport. Now SI Sudhir\nSharma on behalf of IO SI Sanjay Kumar has filed the report that\nthe accused is avoiding deposit of passport with the Investigating\nAgency despite giving of notice\nu/s 91\nCr.P.C. and opportunity is\ngiven to him on 03.09.2015, 05.09.2015 and 07.09.2015 as well as\non 09.09.2015. As the accused is not cooperating with the\nInvestigating Agency, the order dated 24.08.2015 is automatically\nset aside which was conditional on the deposit of passport. The\nInvestigating Agency may proceed against the accused\nu/s 82\n\nCr.P.C. and the status of LOC of the accused which was opened\nmay again be reopened and separate copy of the order be given to\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 6 of 15\n\nthe SHO for his intimation and compliance. Date of execution of\nprocess\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. is 30.09.2015.\"\n\n6. As noted above, though the applicant had not filed any anticipatory\nbail application in FIR No.799/2015 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nIPC\nbut so that parties could negotiate a settlement and appear in mediation\nproceedings, the applicant was granted interim protection by this Court in\nBail Appln. No.1645/2015. The applicant herein filed an anticipatory bail\napplication before the learned Additional Sessions Judge in case FIR\nNo.15/2015 under\nSections 313\n/\nIPC which also came up for hearing on\n24th August, 2015 wherein on the opposition of the complainant and time\nsought to file the reply, the application was adjourned to 25th August, 2015\nwithout passing any interim order in favour of the applicant. Vide order\ndated 25th August, 2015, learned Additional Sessions Judge granted interim\nprotection noting as under:-\n\n\"Investigating agency has fairly conceded that they have no\nobjection, in case interim protection is granted to the applicant to\nenable him to participate in mediation proceedings.\n\nAs informed by the father of the complainant, the mediation\nproceedings are to be commenced from today itself at 3.30 PM\nbefore the Mediation Cell, High Court of Delhi.\n\nKeeping in view the aforesaid submissions, it is hereby\ndirected that no coercive action be taken against the applicant till\nnext date of hearing.\n\nPut up for arguments and disposal of present bail application\non 28.9.2015.\n\nCopy of the order be given \"dasti\" by bail section.\"\n\n7. On 28th September, 2015, in view of the order of the Metropolitan\nMagistrate giving discretion to the investigating officer that if need so arises,\nhe may impound the passport, the investigating officer in his reply submitted\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 7 of 15\n\nthat despite directions of the Court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate, the\npetitioner/applicant was not surrendering the passport on which the learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge passed the following order:-\n\n\"In his reply, IO has submitted that despite directions of the\ncourt of Ld. MM, the applicant is not surrendering his passport.\nCopy of the order dt. 24.8.2015 perused whereby the Ld. MM was\npleased to grant liberty to the IO to impound the passport of the\napplicant, if any need to do so arises.\n\nIO has failed to justify any reasons for impounding the\npassport of the applicant who is stated to be working in United\nKingdoms.\n\nFirst round for mediation is stated to have been over and now\nthe matter is further listed for negotiation between the parties on\nthe quantum of alimony.\n\nHence, put up for further proceedings on 3.11.2015.\nInterim order to continue till next date of hearing.\nCopy of the order be given dasti by bail section.\"\n\n8. The two applications were disposed off by the learned Metropolitan\nMagistrate vide order dated 30th September, 2015 noting that since the\nproceedings under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. were pending and an interim\nprotection by superior court was granted, thus the applicant should approach\nfor the reliefs before the superior court. The order dated 30th September,\n2015 reads as under:-\n\n\"Two applications are pending disposal, one application is\nfor the status report and the other application is for passing\nappropriate order in view of the reply of the IO and the submission\nof the counsel that the applicant is regularly joining the\ninvestigation. As far as the application for passing appropriate\norder is concerned the same was filed by the counsel after order\ndated 14.09.2015 of this court whereby the investigating agency\nwas given the liberty to proceed\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. and also liberty\nwas given to reopen the LOC after the same was directed to be\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 8 of 15\n\nclosed on 24.8.15. Basically in the said application the Ld.\nCounsel has prayed that process\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. which was stayed\non 24.08.2015 be finally dropped and adverse process against the\naccused be cancelled as he is regularly joining the investigation.\n\nAs far as the application for passing appropriate order is\nconcerned report was called from the IO regarding the issuance of\nnotice to the accused/applicant for joining investigation after\n\n09.09.2015 and his response thereto as the order on dropping of\nproceedings\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. hinges on the cooperation of accused\nin joining the investigation. The Ld. Counsel also submits that the\nIO may be directed not to impound the passport of the applicant.\nLd. Counsel has also shown copy of order dated 28.09.2015 of Ld.\nASJ Sh. Lokesh Kumar Sharma, wherein interim directions have\nbeen given that no coercive action be taken against the applicant\ntill 03.11.2015. Also it has been observed that the IO has failed to\njustify any reason for impounding the passport of the applicant\nwho is stated to be working at United Kingdom. As this court has\nalready passed the order dated 14.09.2015 wherein IO has been\ngiven liberty to proceed\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C and reopen the LOC against\nthe applicant and on the other hand it is apparent that a superior\ncourt has given interim protection to the applicant and made\nobservation relating to the passport, propriety demands that for\nthe final relief regarding process\nu/s 82\nCr.P.C. and retention of\npassport, the applicant may approach for the same in appropriate\nlegal proceedings in the superior court.\n\nNow as far as application for the status report is concerned,\nit is alleged by the counsel that the IO is not conducting\ninvestigating fairly and is not giving proper status of the\ncooperation of the applicant in joining the investigation. The IO\nhas remained silent on the notice given to the accused for\n05.09.2015 for joining the investigation and also no notice\nu/s 91\n\nCr.P.C. has been shown by the IO which he states to have been\ngiven to the applicant for impounding the passport. When this\ncourt asked the reasons for the same to the IO, he had no\nresponse. It seems that the IO is not working diligently on the\ncase and in future he is expected to give complete answers to the\nquery posed. The counsel for the applicant also states that if he\nfinds that the IO is not conducting investigation fairly, he would\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 9 of 15\n\nmove appropriate monitoring application regarding the\ninvestigation conducted by the IO. The counsel is given liberty for\nthe same. With these observation the two applications are\ndisposed of. Copy may be given dasti to the counsel, if so prayed,\nas per rules.\"\n\n9. Vide order dated 3rd November, 2015, learned Additional Sessions\nJudge granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner in case FIR No.15/2015\nunder\nSections 313\n/\nIPC and did not impose any condition that the\napplicant should deposit the passport. The conditions imposed were inter\nalia that he would not leave the territory of India without prior information\nto the investigating officer of the case as well as Ld. MM/ACMM/CMM\nconcerned. The order dated 3rd November, 2015 reads as under:-\n\n\"Today again, it has been submitted that no negotiation could\ntake place between the parties as exorbitant demand is being\nraised from the side of the complainant. FIR in this case has been\nregistered on 6.1.2015 and more than 10 months have elapsed\nsince then.\n\nIO when questioned about the pace of investigation, had\nstated that he was informed by the doctor concerned that it was\nowning to some medical complication that the complainant was\naborted. It has been stated further by the IO that as per the\ncomplainant's version, she was administered something by the\nfamily of the applicant due to which she had developed medical\ncomplications. However, no investigation has been conducted so\nfar in order to ascertain this fact.\n\nIt is also note worthy to mention here that same doctor who\nwas attending the complainant from the day one had caused her\nabortion and the said doctor had already made a statement in that\nregard to the IO.\n\nFrom the aforesaid facts of the case, I am of the considered\nopinion that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not\nrequired in the given set of facts and circumstances of the case.\nHence, it is hereby directed that in the event of his arrest,\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 10 of 15\n\napplicant/accused be admitted on bail on his furnishing a personal\nbond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with one surety in the like amount\nto the satisfaction of IO/Arresting Officer.\n\nApplicant/accused shall however join the investigation as and\nwhen required by the IO and he shall not make any attempt either\ndirectly or indirectly to intimidate the complainant or hamper the\ninvestigation. He is also directed to not to leave the territory of\nIndia without prior information to the IO of the case as well as Ld.\nMM/ACMM/CMM concerned.\n\nWith these observations, the application, as filed, stands\ndisposed of.\n\nCopy of the order be given \"dasti\" by bail section.\"\n\n10. It is evident from the above orders that in case FIR No.15/2015 under\n\nSections 313\n/\nIPC which was the subject matter of applications seeking\nprogress in investigation and quashing of proceedings under\nSection 82\n\nCr.P.C., there was no direction of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate\ndirecting deposit of passport to the investigation officer except that\ndiscretion was given to the investigation officer to impound the passport if\nthe need so arises. Learned Metropolitan Magistrate did not apply its\njudicial mind to the fact whether the investigating officer had the authority to\nimpound the passport or a case was made out for recommendation of\nimpounding the passport to the competent authority by the investigating\nofficer or the court concerned.\n\n11. As noted above, the applicant was granted interim protection by this\nCourt in Bail Appln. No.1645/2015. No further substantive order was\npassed in this bail petition and the interim order of protection was continued\ntill 14th January, 2016 when the complainant filed two applications for\nimpleadment and withdrawal of the interim protection. An application was\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 11 of 15\n\nalso filed by the applicant seeking permission to travel to United Kingdom\nwhich was withdrawn on 22nd March, 2016.\n\n12. The interim protection granted to the applicant in case FIR\nNo.799/2015 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nIPC continued by this Court\nin Bail Appln. No.205/2016. However, on 26th August, 2016 since none\nappeared on behalf of the applicant, the interim order in his favour was\nvacated. Pursuant thereto, the applicant was arrested and was granted\nregular bail by the learned Trial Court vide order dated 29 th August, 2016,\nthe relevant portion whereof is reproduced in para 15 hereinafter.\n\n13. It is in these applications that on 22nd April, 2016, learned counsel for\nthe complainant stated that despite directions given to the husband of the\ncomplainant, he has not deposited his passport. Thus, this Court passed\norder dated 22nd April, 2016 as noted above directing him to deposit the\npassport on or before 12 noon of 23rd April, 2016. A perusal of the order\nsheets as noted above clearly shows that no Court had directed the applicant\nAjit Singh Sambhi to deposit his passport. Only discretion was granted to\nthe investigating officer to impound the passport which it had no jurisdiction\nto do. It is not disputed that till date the investigating officer has sent no\nrecommendation to the competent authority for impounding of the passport\nof Ajit Singh Sambhi. Thus the observation of this Court on 22nd April,\n2016 that despite directions the petitioner/applicant has failed to deposit the\npassport was on the statement of the learned counsel for the complainant and\ndirections were issued to the applicant to deposit the passport. This Court in\nthe present proceedings is refraining from making any observation that the\nstatement of learned counsel for the complainant was in overreach of the\nproceedings of the Court however suffice it is to state that till date there is\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 12 of 15\n\nno order of any competent court directing the petitioner to deposit the\npassport and in the order granting bail in FIR No.799/2015 the condition\nimposed is that the applicant will seek permission from the Court before\nleaving the country and in FIR No.15/2015 that the applicant will inform the\ninvestigating officer of the case as well as the Trial Court/CMM/ACMM.\nThus, the order dated 22nd April, 2016 passed by this Court directing deposit\nof the passport was on erroneous statement made by learned counsel for the\ncomplainant.\n\n14. The Supreme Court in the decision reported as (\n2008) 3 SCC 674\nSuresh Nanda Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation\nnoting the distinction\nbetween \"seizure\" and \"impounding\" held that even the Court cannot\nimpound the passport. It was held-\n\n\"14. In our opinion, while the police may have the power\nto seize a passport under\nSection 102(1)\nCrPC, it does not have\nthe power to impound the same. Impounding of a passport can\nonly be done by the Passport Authority under\nSection 10(3)\nof the\nPassports Act, 1967.\n\n15. It may be mentioned that there is a difference\nbetween seizing of a document and impounding a document. A\nseizure is made at a particular moment when a person or authority\ntakes into his possession some property which was earlier not in\nhis possession. Thus, seizure is done at a particular moment of\ntime. However, if after seizing of a property or document the said\nproperty or document is retained for some period of time, then\nsuch retention amounts to impounding of the property or\ndocument. In Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar (2nd Edn.), the\nword \"impound\" has been defined to mean,\n\"to take possession of a document or the like for being held in\ncustody in accordance with law\".\n\nThus, the word \"impounding\" really means retention of\npossession of goods or a document which has been seized.\n\nBail Appln. 1645/2015 & 205/2016 Page 13 of 15\n\n16. Hence, while the police may have power to seize a passport\nunder\nSection 102\nCrPC if it is permissible within the authority\ngiven under\nSection 102\nCrPC, it does not have power to retain or\nimpound the same, because that can only be done by the Passport\nAuthority under\nSection 10(3)\nof the Passports Act. Hence, if the\npolice seizes a passport (which it has power to do under\nSection\nCrPC), thereafter the police must send it along with a letter to\nthe Passport Authority clearly stating that the seized passport\ndeserves to be impounded for one of the reasons mentioned in\n\nSection 10(3)\nof the Act. It is thereafter for the Passport Authority\nto decide whether to impound the passport or not. Since\nimpounding of a passport has civil consequences, the Passport\nAuthority must give an opportunity of hearing to the person\nconcerned before impounding his passport. It is well settled that\nany order which has civil consequences must be passed after\ngiving opportunity of hearing to a party (vide\nState of\nOrissa v. Binapani Dei\n[AIR 1967 SC 1269] ).\n\n17. In the present case, neither the Passport Authority passed\nany order of impounding nor was any opportunity of hearing given\nto the appellant by the Passport Authority for impounding the\ndocument. It was only the CBI authority which has retained\npossession of the passport (which in substance amounts to\nimpounding it) from October 2006. In our opinion, this was clearly\nillegal. Under\nSection 10-A\nof the Act retention by the Central\nGovernment can only be for four weeks. Thereafter it can only be\nretained by an order of the Passport Authority under\nSection\n10(3)\n.\n\n18. In our opinion, even the court cannot impound a passport.\nThough, no doubt,\nSection 104\nCrPC states that the court may, if it\nthinks fit, impound any document or thing produced before it, in\nour opinion, this provision will only enable the court to impound\nany document or thing other than a passport. This is because\nimpounding of a \"passport\" is provided for in\nSection 10(3)\nof the\nPassports Act.\nThe Passports Act\nis a special law while\nCrPC\nis a\ngeneral law. It is well settled that the special law prevails over the\ngeneral law vide G.P. Singh's Principles of Statutory\nInterpretation (9th Edn., p. 133). This principle is expressed in the\nmaxim generalia specialibus non derogant.
