The struggle for seniority between the direct\n\nrecruits and the promotees working in the Bruhat\n\nBengaluru Mahanagara Palike (\"the BBMP\", for short) in\n\nthe cadre of First Division Assistants, and their\n\nconsequential promotions and seniority in the promotional\n\ncadres is the subject matter of challenge, in this batch of\n\nwrit petitions.\n\n2. The following facts are not in dispute.\n\n3. The recruitment to various posts in the BBMP\n\nare governed by the City of Bangalore Municipal\n\nCorporation Services (General) Cadre and Recruitment\n\nRegulations, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the \"C & R\n\nRules\"), which were framed on 03.03.1971.\n\n4. Under these Rules, the posts of First Division\n\nAssistants (\"FDA\") are required to be filled up by direct\n\nrecruitment and by promotion from the post of Second\n\nDivision Assistant (\"SDA\"), in the ratio of 50:50.\n\n- 59 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n5. On 13.08.2012, a provisional gradation list of\n\nthe FDA appointed between the periods 01.01.1988 and\n\n01.08.2012 was published.\n\n6. After considering the objections filed by the\n\nFDAs who were aggrieved by their assigned rankings, a\n\nfinal gradation list was issued on 28.11.2013.\n\n7. In this final gradation list, the five petitioners in\n\nW.P. No.39961/2016 were assigned rankings from 256 to\n\n277. These petitioners had been initially appointed as\n\nSDAs between 31.12.1994 and 02.12.1995, and were\n\npromoted to the cadre of FDA on 18.01.2018.\n\n8. As the petitioners (who were the promotees)\n\nhad been promoted on 18.01.2008, which was about nine\n\nmonths before the private respondents had been directly\n\nrecruited under the notification dated 04.10.2008 and in\n\nthe final gradation list dated 28.01.2013, they (the\n\npromotees) were assigned rankings from 256 to 277,\n\nwhile the private respondents i.e., direct recruits were\n\n- 60 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nassigned rankings from 281 to 351. In other words, the\n\npromotees to the cadre of FDA were considered as seniors\n\nto the directly recruited FDAs.\n\n9. The direct recruits, being aggrieved by this\n\ngradation list, preferred writ petitions before this Court in\n\nW.P. Nos.7116-7117/2013.\n\n10. During the pendency of said writ petitions, the\n\nEstablishment and Administrative Reforms Standing\n\nCommittee of the BBMP (\"the Standing Committee\")\n\npassed a resolution on 04.02.2013, in which it was\n\nrecorded that there existed certain deficiencies in the final\n\ngradation list dated 28.01.2013. The Standing Committee,\n\nin light of the deficiencies and the objections raised by the\n\nemployees, ultimately resolved to consider the objections\n\nof the erstwhile employees of the Town Municipal Council,\n\nwho had been absorbed into the BBMP by keeping them\n\noutside the seniority and to finalise the seniority of the\n\nemployees of the BBMP afresh, and until then, their\n\npromotions were required to be withheld.\n\n- 61 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n11. This Court, thereafter, on 18.12.2014,\n\nproceeded to dispose of W.P. Nos.7116-7117/2013 holding\n\nthat the seniority list dated 28.01.2013 was not in\n\nconformity with the law and was required to be re-done,\n\nand there was a need to direct the BBMP to implement the\n\nresolution dated 04.02.2013 passed by the Standing\n\nCommittee. Accordingly, this Court allowed the writ\n\npetitions and directed the BBMP to give effect to the\n\nresolution dated 04.02.2013 passed by the Standing\n\nCommittee, immediately.\n\n12. It is also pertinent to state here that the 22\n\ndirect recruits had also preferred W.P. Nos.51-72/2014\n\nchallenging the seniority list dated 28.01.2013. However,\n\nthese petitions, by an order dated 03.07.2015, were\n\ndismissed as certain objections had not been complied\n\nwith.\n\n13. Pursuant to the orders passed by this Court on\n\n18.12.2014 in W.P. Nos.7116-7117/2013, the BBMP\n\n- 62 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nproceeded to issue a provisional seniority list of FDAs. This\n\nprovisional seniority list was in respect of all the FDAs who\n\nhad been appointed between 03.03.1971 and 01.01.2015.\n\n14. In this provisional seniority list, the BBMP\n\nsought to apply the guidelines stated in the Government\n\nOrder (\"GO\") dated 05.07.1976 (based on the decision\n\nrendered in V.B. Badami's1 case, by the Supreme Court)\n\nand the GO dated 14.12.1987 (based on the decision\n\nrendered in Gonal Bhimappa's2 case, by the Supreme\n\nCourt).\n\n15. This provisional seniority list sought to classify\n\nand calculate the vacancies between the direct recruits\n\nand promotees, as indicated in the 2 aforementioned GOs\n\ni.e., by defining Block Periods. As per the 2 GOs, the Block\n\nPeriods, were required be from the date on which the\n\nRules were promulgated and the dates on which direct\n\nrecruitments were first made, and the other Block Periods\nV.B. Badami and Ors. v. State of Mysore and Ors., 1980 AIR 1561.\nGonal Bhimappa v. State of Karnataka, AIR 1987 SC 2359.\n\n- 63 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nwere to be for the periods between the dates on which\n\ndirect recruitments were subsequently made.\n\n16. The BBMP classified and calculated the\n\nvacancies into eight Block Periods.\n\n17. The initial Block Period was the \"No Rule Period\"\n\ni.e., the period during which there were no statutory rules\n\ngoverning the recruitment, which was between 01.09.1966\n\nand 03.01.1971.\n\n18. The first Block Period was from the date on\n\nwhich the statutory rules were promulgated i.e.,\n\n03.03.1971, till the date on which the first direct\n\nrecruitment was made i.e., on 10.10.1971. Similarly,\n\nseven other Block Periods were classified, which were the\n\nperiods between which direct recruitments were made.\n\n19. In the provisional gradation list, the BBMP\n\nplaced all the promotees (the petitioners in the aforesaid\n\nwrit petitions i.e., W.P. No.39661/2016) below the direct\n\nrecruits. In other words, the direct recruits, who had been\n\n- 64 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nappointed as FDAs directly under the notification dated\n\n04.10.2008 i.e., 9 months after the petitioners were\n\npromoted on 18.01.2008 as FDAs, were considered as\n\nseniors to the promotees. This was on the ground that the\n\npromotees had occupied posts in excess of the posts\n\nearmarked under the 50% quota for promotees.\n\n20. The promotee-petitioners filed objections to the\n\nsaid gradation list contending that it was impermissible for\n\nthe BBMP to place them below the direct recruits, since it\n\nwas an admitted fact that they were all promoted on\n\n18.01.2008, whereas the direct recruits were recruited\n\nsubsequently on 04.10.2008 and onwards.\n\n21. Despite the objections raised by the petitioners,\n\nthe BBMP proceeded finalise the gradation list and\n\nproceeded to issue the final gradation list on 09.09.2015.\n\n22. In this final gradation list, the placement of the\n\npromotee-FDAs (such as petitioners) below the directly\n\nrecruited FDAs (private respondents) was maintained.\n\n- 65 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n23. This final gradation list was accompanied by\n\nseven explanations.\n\n24. The 2nd explanation stated that, the local\n\ncandidates, the erstwhile employees of the Town Municipal\n\nCouncil which were merged with the BBMP, the employees\n\nwho had sought for change of cadre and the employees\n\nappointed on compassionate appointment were considered\n\nas direct recruits in the respective Block Periods, and their\n\nappointment were finalized.\n\n25. Similarly, the 3rd explanation stated that the\n\ndaily wage employees who had been regularized were also\n\nconsidered under the direct recruitment quota.\n\n26. The fourth explanation stated that the GO dated\n\n05.07.1976 was applied in the matter of classifying and\n\ncalculating the vacancies between the direct recruits and\n\nthe promotees. The said explanation reads as follows:\n\n- 66 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n\"4. ¢£ÁAPÀ 05/07/1967gÀ ¸ÀPÁðgÀzÀ C¢üPÀÈvÀ eÁÕ¥À£À ¸ÀASÉå:r¦JDgï\n48 J¸ïJ¸ïDgï 75 gÀ°è ¨ÁèPï CªÀ¢üAiÀÄ£ÀÄß UÀÄgÀÄw¸ÀÄªÀ\nGzÉÝÃ±ÀPÁÌV F PÉ¼ÀPÀAqÀAvÉ ¸Àà¶ÖPÀgÀtªÀ£ÀÄß ¤ÃqÀ>ÁVgÀÄvÀÛzÉ.\n\n\"For purposes of classifying and calculating the\n\nvacancies between direct recruits and promotees on\nthe basis of the quota fixed in the cadre and\nRecruitment Rules, the period which will form a\nblock will be from the date of commencement of the\nCadre and Recruitment Rules to the dates on which\ndirect recruits were first appointed unless in the\nmean while, there was any amendment to the\nRules, in which case the block will be the period\ncommencing from the date of commencement of the\nrule to the date of amendment and thereafter from\nthe date of amendment to the date of recruitment\nof direct recruits and the vacancies in both the\nblocks will have to be taken into account\"\n\nCzÀgÀAvÉ ¥Á°PÉAiÀÄ ªÀÈAzÀ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ¤AiÀiÁªÀiÁªÀ½ eÁjUÉ\n§AzÀ ¢£ÁAPÀ : 03.03.1971 jAzÀ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ªÀiÁr DzÉÃ±À\nºÉÆgÀr¹zÀ ¢£ÁAPÀzÀªÀgÉ«UÉ, £ÀAvÀgÀ MAzÀÄ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw¬ÄAzÀ\nªÀÄvÉÆÛAzÀÄ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ªÀiÁr DzÉÃ±À ºÉÆgÀr¹zÀ\n¢£ÁAPÀzÀªÀgÉ«UÉ ¨ÁèPï CªÀ¢üUÀ¼À£ÀÄß UÀÄgÀÄw¹ F ¨ÁèPï CªÀ¢üAiÀÄ°è\n®¨sÀåªÁUÀÄªÀ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£ÀUÀ¼À£ÀÄß £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ¤AiÀÄªÀÄUÀ¼À°è\n¤UÀ¢¥Àr¹gÀÄªÀ PÉÆÃmÁzÀ£ÀéAiÀÄ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£ÀUÀ¼ÀÄ\nªÀÄvÀÄÛ ªÀÄÄA§rÛ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£ÀUÀ¼À£ÁßV ªÀVÃðPÀgÀt ªÀiÁr, ¨sÀwð\nªÀiÁqÀ>ÁzÀ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ªÀÄvÀÄÛ ªÀÄÄA§rÛ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£ÀUÀ¼À£ÀÄß,\nªÀVÃðPÀj¸À>ÁzÀ jPÀÛ ¸ÁÜ£ÀUÀ¼À «ÄwUÉ M¼À¥Àr¹ £ËPÀgÀgÀÄUÀ¼À\neÉÃµÀ×vÉAiÀÄ£ÀÄß ¤UÀ¢¥Àr¸À>ÁVzÉ. ºÁUÀÆ F »AzÉ ¢£ÁAPÀ:\n\n01/01/1990 PÉÌ EgÀÄªÀAvÉ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ºÁUÀÆ ªÀÄÄA§rÛ\nC£ÀÄ¸ÁgÀ ¥ÀæZÀÄgÀ ¥Àr¸À>ÁVgÀÄªÀ eÉÃµÀ×vÁ ¥ÀnÖAiÀÄ DzsÁgÀzÀ ªÉÄÃ>É\n\n- 67 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n¥ÀjUÀtÂ¸À>ÁVgÀÄªÀ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁwUÀ¼ÁzÀ ¢£ÁAPÀUÀ½UÉ ¨ÁèPï\nCªÀ¢üUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ±ÉÃ.50gÀµÀÖ£ÀÄß £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ªÀÄÆ®PÀ ºÁUÀÆ\n±ÉÃ.50gÀµÀÖ£ÀÄß ªÀÄÄA§rÛ ªÀÄÆ®PÀ ¥ÀjUÀtÂ¸À>ÁVzÉ.\n\n5. ¢£ÁAPÀ: 02/09/1994gÀAzÀÄ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw ªÀÄvÀÄÛ ªÀÄÄA§rÛ\nC£ÀÄ¸ÁgÀ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 01/01/1990PÉÌ EgÀÄªÀAvÉ ºÉÆgÀr¹gÀÄªÀ ¥ÀæxÀªÀÄ\nzÀeÉð ¸ÀºÁAiÀÄPÀgÀÄUÀ¼À ¸ÉÃªÁ eÉÃµÀ×vÁ ¥ÀnÖAiÀÄÄ\nHfðvÀªÁVgÀÄªÀÅzÀjAzÀ ¸ÀzÀj ¸ÉÃªÁ eÉµÀ×vÁ ¥ÀnÖAiÀÄ DzsÁgÀzÀ\nªÉÄÃ>É £ÉÃgÀ ªÉÃªÀÄPÁw ºÀÄzÉÝUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ºÁUÀÆ ªÀÄÄA§rÛ ºÀÄzÉÝUÀ¼À£ÀÄß\n¥ÀjUÀtÂ¸À>ÁVzÀÄÝ, CzÀgÀAvÉ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 21/06/1971 jAzÀ\n27/09/1971gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ, ¢£ÁAPÀ: 01/07/1972 jAzÀ\n07/08/1972gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ, ¢£ÁAPÀ: 02/05/1973 jAzÀ\n06/11/1973gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ, ¢£ÁAPÀ: 03/07/1974 jAzÀ\n27/08/1974gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ, ¢£ÁAPÀ: 24/01/1975 jAzÀ\n12/12/1975gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ ªÀÄvÀÄÛ ¢£ÁAPÀ: 20/06/1977 jAzÀ\n10/07/1977gÀ ªÀgÉ«UÉ ««zsÀ ¢£ÁAPÀUÀ¼À°è £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw\nDzÉÃ±ÀUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ºÉÆgÀr¸À>ÁVzÀÄÝ, F £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁwUÀ¼ÀÄ MAzÉÃ\n¸ÀAzÀ¨sÀðzÀ°è ªÀiÁrgÀÄªÀ £ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁwUÀ¼ÉÃ CxÀªÁ ¨ÉÃgÉ ¨ÉÃgÉ\n¸ÀAzÀ¨sÀðUÀ¼À°è ªÀiÁrgÀÄªÀ ºÀÄzÉÝUÀ¼É JA§ §UÉÎ ¤RgÀªÁzÀ ªÀiÁ»w\n®¨sÀå«®èzÉÃ EgÀÄªÀÅzÀjAzÀ ¸ÀzÀj ¸Á°£À°è ««zsÀ ¢£ÁAPÀUÀ¼À°è £ÉÃgÀ\n£ÉÃªÀÄPÁw DzÉÃ±ÀUÀ¼À£ÀÄß ºÉÆgÀr¹gÀÄªÀÅzÀjAzÀ D ¸Á°£À°è PÉÆ£ÉAiÀÄ\n£ÉÃgÀ £ÉÃªÀÄPÁw DzÉÃ±À ºÉÆgÀr¸À>ÁzÀ ¢£ÁAPÀªÀ£ÀÄß MAzÀÄ ¨ÁèPï\nCªÀ¢üUÉ ¥ÀjUÀtÂ¸À>ÁVzÉ.\"\n\n27.

It may also be pertinent to state here that the\n\nseventh Block Period spanned between 11.09.1977 and\n\n04.10.2008 i.e., for a period of more than thirty-one\n\nyears. This fundamentally indicated that for this period of\n\nthirty-one years, there had been no direct recruitments to\n\nthe post of FDAs at all and it was only on 04.10.2008 that\n\ndirect recruitment of the private respondents i.e.,\n\nrespondent Nos.3 to 112 had been made.\n\n31. The 6th explanation also stated that the 8th\n\nBlock Period was being treated as an Open Block Period,\n\nsince the 125 excess promotions that had been in the\n\nearlier Block Periods were to be adjusted and only after\n\nthe adjustment was completed by filling up the 125 posts\n\nin the DR quota could the 8th Block Period be closed.\n\n- 70 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n32.

As could be seen from said Annexure, there was\n\nno occupation of the promotees in excess of their quota in\n\nthe 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th Block Periods, and only in the 2nd, 5th,\n\n6th, 7th and 8th Block Periods was there an encroachment\n\nof the promotees into the direct recruitment quota to the\n\nextent of 3+15+85+45 i.e., a total of 148 posts.\n\n35. The seventh Block Period i.e., the period from\n\n1977 to 2008, during which no direct recruitments were\n\nmade, there was maximum encroachment of 85 direct\n\nrecruitment posts by the promotees.\n\n- 72 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n36. Since the promotee-petitioners had been\n\npromoted on 18.01.2008 i.e., in the 7th Block Period and\n\nthese promotions were in excess of their quota, they were\n\nplaced below the private-respondents who had been\n\ndirectly recruited on 4.10.2008.\n\n37. For the subsequent eighth Block Period, which\n\nis treated as an open Block Period, out of the 87 posts\n\nreserved for direct recruitment and 88 posts reserved for\n\npromotees, only 42 posts had been filled up by way of\n\ndirect recruitment and 133 posts were filled up by way of\n\npromotion. In other words, there was a shortfall in filling\n\nup the quota earmarked for direct recruitments to the\n\nextent of 45 posts and there was an encroachment of the\n\npromotees into the direct recruitment quota by the grant\n\nof 45 excess promotions to the promotees.\n\n38. The petitioners in W.P. Nos. 39961/2016 who\n\nhad been promoted on 18.01.2008 as FDAs much before\n\nthe private respondents had been recruited on\n\n04.10.2008, have challenged this final gradation list dated\n\n- 73 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n09.09.2015, principally on the ground that the Quota Rule\n\ncould not be applied by the BBMP, since it is glaringly\n\nobvious that the Quota Rule had broken down completely.\n\nIt is their contention that the Rules were promulgated in\n\nthe year 1971 and the Quota Rule was never operated\n\never since the promulgation of the Rules, and it is also an\n\nadmitted fact that there were no clear details regarding\n\nthe filling up of direct recruitment vacancies till 1977.\n\n39. It is contended that from 1977 till 2008 i.e., for\n\na period of thirty one years, there was admittedly no\n\ndirect recruitment undertaken by the BBMP for the posts\n\nof FDAs and it was, thus, obvious that the Quota Rule had\n\nirretrievably broken down and consequently, the BBMP\n\ncould not have been applied the GOs dated 5.7.1976 and\n\n14.12.1987 and prepare a gradation list by creating Block\n\nPeriods to classify and calculate the vacancies in order to\n\ndetermine the inter se seniority of the FDAs.\n\n40. The second batch of writ petitions i.e., W.P.\n\nNos.4296/2018 & 9775/2018 are also filed by the\n\n- 74 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\npromotees who have been working as Managers and who\n\nhad been promoted from the cadre of FDA.\n\n41. It is their case that they were appointed as\n\nSDAs between the period 01.09.1989 and 11.05.1994, and\n\nwere promoted as FDAs on 10.05.2007 and nearly a year\n\nthereafter, on 04.10.2008, the private respondents had\n\nbeen directly recruited as FDAs and therefore, they could\n\nnever be considered as seniors to them.\n\n42. They contend that they were also promoted to\n\nthe next higher cadre of Managers on 11.05.2010, which,\n\naccording to the C & R Rules, were required to be filled up\n\n100% by way of promotion from FDAs and a seniority list\n\nwas also published on 28.12.2013, in which they had been\n\nassigned seniority from the date on which they had been\n\naccorded promotions.\n\n43. They contend that on 25.07.2016 i.e., nearly\n\nsix years after they had been promoted, the private\n\nrespondents had been promoted as Managers and they\n\n- 75 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nwere therefore, without any doubt, juniors to them in the\n\ncadre of Manager.\n\n44. They are aggrieved by an order dated\n\n17.07.2017, by which the private respondents, i.e.,\n\npersons who had been recruited directly as FDAs and were\n\npromoted on 25.07.2016 as Managers, have been granted\n\nretrospective promotions with effect from 11.05.2010 on\n\nthe ground that their seniority had been refixed in the\n\nfeeder cadre of First Division Assistants (which is the\n\nsubject of the first batch of writ petitions) and they had\n\nbecome eligible for promotion two years thereafter.\n\n45. They are also aggrieved by the placement of\n\nthe said private respondents above them in the provisional\n\nas well as the final seniority list published in the cadre of\n\nManager on 04.01.2018.\n\n46. The direct recruits have also filed a petition in\n\nW.P.

They also contend that the private respondents\n\n(the promotees) were promoted as Assessors on\n\n25.02.2015 and in the seniority list dated 10.01.2018,\n\nthey had been placed at Sl. Nos.406 to 436 and the\n\npromotee-Assessors were placed at Sl. Nos.359 to 374,\n\nand since they were given the eligibility year as 2010 by\n\nvirtue of the resolution dated 04.02.2013, they were\n\nrequired to be considered as seniors to the promotee-\n\nAssessors and in order to get over an seniority, an attempt\n\nwas being made to place them in independent charge\n\nunder Rule 32, though they did not possess the requisite\n\nlength of service.\n\n48. The third batch of writ petitions i.e., W.P.\n\nNos.1130/2020, 3915/2020, 10879/2021 & 18471/2022\n\n- 77 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nare filed by the promotees challenging the seniority list of\n\nAssessors dated 08.11.2019.\n\n49. The petitioner in W.P. No.10739/2020 and the\n\npetitioner in W.P. No.1130/2020 are one and the same. In\n\nthe first writ petition i.e., in W.P. No. 1130/2020, he has\n\nchallenged the seniority list of Assessors dated 08.11.2019\n\nand has also sought a direction to the BBMP to prepare the\n\ngradation list in the ratio of 7:5:1 as per the C & R Rules.\n\n50. In the second writ petition, i.e., in W.P.\n\nNo.10739/2020, he has challenged the Departmental\n\nPromotion Committee (\"the DPC\") proceedings dated\n\n15.02.2010 and also the subsequent gradation list of\n\nAssessors which has been published on 11.06.2021.\n\n51. W.P. No.5188/2021 is filed by the petitioners\n\nwho had been appointed on compassionate grounds and\n\nwere considered as direct recruits, challenging the final\n\ngradation list of FDAs published (as on 01.01.2020),\n\ncontending that the DPC had resolved to promote them as\n\n- 78 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nAssessors on 01.08.2018 and they had been placed higher\n\nthan certain FDAs, but in the final gradation list dated\n\n04.02.2021, they had been placed blow and their ranking\n\nwas brought down at Sl. Nos.850 to 884.\n\n52. Learned counsel appearing for the promotees,\n\nas already stated above, contend that there has,\n\nadmittedly, been no direct recruitment virtually from the\n\ntime the C & R Rules were promulgated in 1971 and it was\n\nstrikingly clear that the Quota Rule had never been\n\noperated upon and had, thus, broken down since its very\n\ninception. They place reliance on the judgment rendered\n\nby the Supreme Court in the case of Direct Recruit Class-\n\nII Engineering Officers Association3 to contend that the\n\nBBMP had seriously erred in applying the GOs dated\n\n05.07.1976 and 14.12.1987, and applying the Block\n\nPeriods for the purposes of classifying and calculating the\n\nvacancies and to determine the inter se seniority between\n\nthe promotees and the direct recruits, in coming to the\nDirect Recruit Class-II Engineering Officers Association v. State of\nMaharastra and others, (1990) 13 SCC 715.\n\n- 79 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nconclusion that there was encroachment of the promotees\n\ninto the direct recruitment quota.\n\n53. They contend that since there was no direct\n\nrecruitment for more than thirty-one years, it will have to\n\nbe held that the promotions made in excess of the quota\n\nand by encroaching upon the direct recruitment quota\n\nwould have to considered as valid promotions and\n\nconsequently, the service rendered by such promotees\n\ncould not have been annulled by applying the Quota Rule\n\nand thereby, alter their seniority.\n\n54. Learned counsel appearing for the BBMP as well\n\nas the direct recruits contended that once the C & R Rules\n\nprescribed a quota for the direct recruits and the\n\npromotees, the same had to be adhered to. They contend\n\nthat merely because no direct recruitment was conducted\n\nfor more than thirty-one years, it cannot be held that the\n\nQuota Rule had broken down.\n\n- 80 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n55. They contend that the promotions granted to\n\nthe promotees in excess of their quota were only\n\nfortuitous promotions and therefore, they cannot claim\n\nany legal right on that basis for the proposed seniority.\n\nThey place reliance on the decision rendered by the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of Suraj Prakash Gupta4 to contend that\n\nthe promotions made in excess of their quota would only\n\nbe fortuitous promotion and on the basis of the service\n\nrendered by such fortuitous promotions, they cannot claim\n\nseniority if they have occupied the seats of direct recruits.\n\nThey contend that the promotees could claim seniority\n\nonly from the date the post became available to them in\n\ntheir quota and any services that they had rendered by\n\nvirtue of their promotion in excess of their quota cannot be\n\ncounted for the purpose of seniority.\n\n56. It is also stated that since the seniority of the\n\ndirectly recruited FDAs had been re-fixed by the final\n\ngradation list and they were seniors to the promoted\nSuraj Prakash Gupta & others v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & others\n, AIR\n2000 SC 2386.\n\n- 81 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nFDAs, it had become necessary under the provisions of the\n\nKCS (regulation of Promotion, Pay and Pension) Act, 1973\n\nand the Rules framed under the Act to grant them\n\nretrospective promotions.\n\n57. In light of the arguments advanced, the points\n\nthat arise for consideration in this batch of writ petitions\n\nare:\n\n(i) Whether the petitioners have established\nthat the Quota Rule had broken down as\nenvisaged in the decision rendered by the\nConstitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nthe case of Direct Recruit Class-II\nEngineering Officers Association (supra) and\nhave also consequentially established that\ntheir promotions were valid and they would\nthus be entitled to reckon their seniority from\nthe dates on which they were promoted; and\n\n(ii) Whether the private respondents (Directly\nRecruited FDAs) can be granted retrospective\npromotions as a result of the alteration of the\nseniority in the cadre of FDAs, and thereby,\nbe placed in seniority above the FDAs who\n\n- 82 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nhad been promoted earlier to them in the\npromotional cadres.\"\n\n58. As stated above, the C & R Rules which were\n\nframed in 1971 states that the post of FDAs would have to\n\nbe filled up by direct recruitment and by way of promotion\n\nfrom the cadre of SDAs, in the ratio of 50:50. This\n\nindicates that it was the intent of the Rules to ensure that\n\nthere was infusion of new talent in the FDA cadre and at\n\nthe same time, the cadre also contained SDAs whose\n\nexperience in the SDA cadre would benefit the FDA cadre,\n\nand this would result in the FDA cadre having an ideal\n\nblend of experience and youth.\n\n59. Ideally, the BBMP was required to ensure that\n\nthe 50% of the posts in the FDA cadre were to be filled up\n\nby way of direct recruitment and 50% of the posts were\n\nfilled up by promotion.

It is clear from the above that the direct\n\nrecruitments were not undertaken for this huge period of\n\n31 years and promotions were not done in adherence to\n\nthe quota specified in the C & R Rules and this was\n\nbecause of the Government instructions in that regard. It,\n\ntherefore, also follows that it was impossible for the BBMP\n\nto adhere to the Quota Rule in the matter of direct\n\nrecruitments.\n\n62. It may also be pertinent to notice here that it is\n\nnot the case of the BBMP that the promotions granted to\n\n- 85 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nthe petitioners i.e., the promotees were either ad hoc or\n\ntemporary. In fact, the BBMP, in the statement of\n\nobjections filed in W.P. No. 4296/2018, has stated in\n\nparagraph No.3 as follows:\n\n\"3. It is submitted that, it is true that the\npetitioners entered the service of erstwhile\nBengaluru Mahangara Palike now known as BBMP\nbetween 1/9/1989 and 11/05/1994 as Second\nDivision Clerks and it is also true that all the\npetitioners were promoted to the cadre of First\nDivision Clerk with effect from 10/05/2007. It is\nalso true that these respondents were appointed by\nway of Direct Recruitment to the services of the\nBBMP as First Division Clerks by the order dated\n4/10/2008. It is also true that the petitioners were\nfurther promoted to the cadre of managers with\neffect from 11/05/2010, without considering the\nvalid objections of these private respondents by\nBBMP. It is not true and correct that the promotion\nof the petitioners was on regular basis. It is not\ncorrect that even in the feeder cadre to the post of\nManager, the petitioners were seniors to the private\nrespondents. The petitioners with the malafide\nintention have suppressed the fact that they are\njuniors to these respondents in the feeder cadre to\nthe post of Managers and the petitioners have no\n\n- 86 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nwhere mentioned that they are juniors to the these\nrespondents as per the final gradation list dated\n09/09/2015.\"\n\n63. It is, therefore, clear from the above that the\n\npetitioners-promotees were granted regular promotions,\n\nthough they were in excess of the entitlement to the quota\n\npermissible for promotees.\n\n64. The Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of Direct Recruit Class-II Engineering Officers\n\nAssociation (supra) has, on consideration of the case law\n\nrelating the disputes between the direct recruits and the\n\npromotees in the matter of seniority, has declared as follows:\n\n\"47. To sum up, we hold that:\n\n(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post\naccording to rule, his seniority has to be counted\nfrom the date of his appointment and not according\nto the date of his confirmation.\n\nThe corollary of the above rule is that where the\ninitial appointment is only ad hoc and not according\nto rules and made as a stop-gap arrangement, the\n\n- 87 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nofficiation in such post cannot be taken into account\nfor considering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by\nfollowing the procedure laid down by the rules but\nthe appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly\ntill the regularisation of his service in accordance\nwith the rules, the period of officiating service will\nbe counted.\n\n(C) When appointments are made from more than\none source, it is permissible to fix the ratio for\nrecruitment from the different sources, and if rules\nare framed in this regard they must ordinarily be\nfollowed strictly.\n\n(D) If it becomes impossible to adhere to the\nexisting quota rule, it should be substituted by an\nappropriate rule to meet the needs of the situation.\nIn case, however, the quota rule is not\nfollowed continuously for a number of years\nbecause it was impossible to do so the\ninference is irresistible that the quota rule had\nbroken down.\n\n(E) Where the quota rule has broken down and\nthe appointments are made from one source\nin excess of the quota but are made after\nfollowing the procedure prescribed by the\nrules for the appointment, the appointees\n\n- 88 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nshould not be pushed down below the\n\nappointees from the other source inducted in\nthe service at a later date.\n\n(F) Where the rules permit the authorities to\nrelax the provisions relating to the quota,\nordinarily a presumption should be raised that\nthere was such relaxation when there is a\ndeviation from the quota rule.\n\n(G) The quota for recruitment from the different\nsources may be prescribed by executive\ninstructions, if the rules are silent on the subject.\n\n(H) If the quota rule is prescribed by an executive\ninstruction, and is not followed continuously for a\nnumber of years, the inference is that the executive\ninstruction has ceased to remain operative.\n\n(I) The posts held by the permanent Deputy\nEngineers as well as the officiating Deputy\nEngineers under the State of Maharashtra belonged\nto the single cadre of Deputy Engineers.\n\n(J) The decision dealing with important questions\nconcerning a particular service given after careful\nconsideration should be respected rather than\nscrutinised for finding out any possible error. It is\nnot in the interest of Service to unsettle a settled\nposition.\"\n\n- 89 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n65. As could be seen from the declaration of law\n\nrendered by the Constitutional Bench, it is settled law that\n\nwhere an initial appointment was only ad hoc and not\n\naccording to the Rules, and were also made as a stop-gap\n\narrangement, their officiation in such posts cannot be\n\ntaken into account while considering seniority.\n\n66. It is also held that where the initial appointment\n\nis not made by following the procedure laid down by the\n\nRules, but the appointee continues in the post\n\nuninterruptedly till the regularization of his services, the\n\nperiod of officiating service will be counted.\n\n67. The Apex Court has also stated that if it\n\nbecomes impossible to adhere to the existing Quota Rules,\n\nit should be substituted by an appropriate rule to meet the\n\nends of that situation. It has also declared that in case the\n\nQuota Rule is not followed continuously for number of\n\nyears for the reason that it was impossible to do so, the\n\n- 90 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nirresistible inference would be that the Quota Rule had\n\nbroken down.\n\n68. It has further held that if the Quota Rule has\n\nbroken down, the persons who were promoted in excess of\n\ntheir quota cannot be pushed below the direct recruits who\n\nhad been appointed subsequently.\n\n69. In light of this declaration of the Constitution\n\nBench, the issue to be examined is as to whether the\n\nQuota Rule was not followed continuously for a\n\nnumber of years because it was impossible to do so\n\nand consequently, hold the Quota Rule had broken\n\ndown.\n\n70. It would also have to be examined whether\n\nthe promotions made in favour of the petitioners\n\nwere ad hoc or a stop gap arrangement, or whether\n\nthey were in accordance with the Rules.\n\n71. As already noticed above, in the proceedings\n\nheld on 31.08.2015 for considering the objections to the\n\n- 91 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\ngradation list, it has been clearly recorded that the BBMP\n\nwas unable undertake direct recruitments and adhere to\n\nthe Quota Rule due to Government instructions in that\n\nregard. If, as a matter of fact, the Government has issued\n\ninstructions to the BBMP not to undertake direct\n\nrecruitments, it is obvious that it was impossible for the\n\nBBMP to undertake direct recruitment even if it so desired.\n\n72. It should also be noticed here that if the BBMP\n\nwas unable to undertake direct recruitment for more than\n\n3 decades, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that\n\nthe Quota Rule was not followed continuously for a\n\nconsiderable number of years. It should also be kept in\n\nmind that the C & R Rules were framed in 1971 and from\n\n1977 to 2008, i.e., for 31 years, the Quota Rule was not\n\nfollowed continuously. In other words, virtually, from the\n\ndate of framing the Rules, the Quota Rule was not followed\n\nat all and the inescapable conclusion that is required to be\n\ndrawn is that the Quota Rule had broken down.\n\n- 92 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n73. The BBMP, in its counter, has admitted that the\n\npromotees were promoted in excess of their quota in the\n\ncadre of FDA and these promotions were made prior to the\n\nrecruitment of the private respondents, by way of direct\n\nrecruitment in the cadre of FDA.\n\n74. It is also admitted that the promotees were\n\npromoted prior to the direct recruitment in the cadre of\n\nAssessor and also in the cadre of Manger.\n\n75. In light of the fact that the Quota Rule was not\n\nfollowed continuously for 31 years, it is absolutely clear\n\nthat the Quota Rule had broken down, as contemplated\n\nunder the decision rendered in the Direct Recruit's case\n\nreferred to above.\n\n76. As a consequence, the further dicta laid down in\n\nthe said case [Clause (e)] that when the Quota Rule had\n\nbroken down and appointments were made from one\n\nsource in excess of the quota and the same were made in\n\naccordance with the Rules, the rule that the appointees\n\n- 93 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nshould not be pushed below the appointees who had been\n\nappointed subsequently, would also stand attracted and\n\nwould be applicable in the present case.\n\n77. As already held above, the BBMP admitted that\n\npromotions had been given to the petitioners in excess of\n\ntheir quota and it only contends that these promotions\n\nwere irregular and illegal, since they contravened the\n\nquota. The fact that the petitioners were granted\n\npromotions in accordance with their seniority and in\n\naccordance with the Rules, though the promotions are in\n\nexcess of their entitled quota, is not in dispute.\n\nConsequently, the petitioners cannot be pushed below the\n\nprivate respondents-direct recruits in the seniority list.\n\n78. There is yet another factor to be considered in\n\nthis case, in the context of the dicta at Clause (f) of the\n\naforementioned judgment, which states that where the\n\nRules permit the authorities to relax the provisions relating\n\nto a quota, presumption should be drawn that here was\n\nrelaxation when there was deviation from the Quota Rule.\n\n- 94 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n79. Rule 10 of C & R Rules reads as follows:\n\n\"10. Appointment by direct recruitment\nor promotion in certain cases.- Notwithstanding\nanything contained in these Regulations for\nRecruitment specially made in respect of any post\nthe Commissioner or the Corporation may.-\n\n(a) Recruit by direct recruitment to a post\nreserved to be filled by promotion when he or it is\nsatisfied that the persons eligible to be considered\nfor appointment by promotion are in the immediate\nLower Grade not fit to be so appointed;\n\n(b) Fill up by promotion any vacancy relating\nto a post which is required to be filled by direct\nrecruitment provided an appointment under this\nsub-clause shall not be continued for a period of\nmore six months except with the concurrence of the\nKarnataka Public Service Commission.\"\n\n80. As could be seen from said Sub-rule (b) of Rule\n\n10, there is indeed a provision which permits relaxation of\n\nthe Quota Rule, though the relaxation in case of making\n\npromotions into the quota earmarked for the direct\n\nrecruits is to normally not exceed 6 months. This power to\n\n- 95 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nrelax, in the context of the present case wherein the\n\nGovernment had issued orders/directions not to undertake\n\ndirect recruitment for 31 long years, would have to be\n\nconsidered as an exercise of this power of relaxation by\n\nthe Government in relation to the deviation from the\n\nQuota Rule. Consequently, as laid down in Clause (f) of\n\nthe Direct Recruit's case (supra), it would become\n\nimperative to draw the presumption that the power of\n\nrelaxation had been exercised, and consequently, the\n\npromotions made in excess of the quota would have to be\n\nheld as valid promotions.\n\n81. Reliance placed by the BBMP on the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of\nSuraj Prakash Gupta\n\n(supra) would be of no avail, since the Apex Court was\n\ndealing with a case relating to posts held by the\n\npromotees therein on ad hoc basis or as a stop-gap\n\narrangement and the question of the Quota Rule having\n\nbroken down was not being considered.\n\n- 96 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n82. Resultantly, the 1st question would have to be\n\nanswered in favour of the petitioner-promotees and it will\n\nhave to be held that the Quota Rule had not been followed\n\ncontinuously for 31 long years and the Quota Rule had,\n\nthus, broken down.\n\n83. As a necessary consequence, it will also have to\n\nbe held that the promotions granted to the petitioners in\n\nexcess of their quota were valid and their seniority will\n\nhave to be counted from the dates on which they were\n\ngranted their respective promotions.\n\n84. As a result of the above, the gradation list of\n\nthe FDAs dated 09.09.2015 is quashed, and the BBMP is\n\ndirected to re-do the seniority list without applying the\n\nQuota Rule and assign seniority to the promotees from the\n\ndates on which they were promoted.\n\n85. As far as further promotions and the seniority\n\nlists in the promotional cadre of Manager (which are the\n\nsubject matter of W.P. No. 4296/2018 and W.P. No.\n\n- 97 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\n9778/2018) is concerned. It is to be stated here that the\n\npetitioners therein were promoted as Managers much prior\n\nto the directly recruited FDAs and only by virtue of the re-\n\nfixation of the seniority of these directly recruited FDAs in\n\nthe FDA cadre have they been given retrospective\n\npromotions from the date on which they became eligible to\n\nbe promoted as Managers.\n\n86. Since it has not been held that the seniority of\n\nthe promotee-FDAs is to be re-fixed from the date on\n\nwhich they were promoted, as their promotions were valid,\n\nthe directly recruited FDAs will have to be placed below\n\nthem and they would, thus, not be entitled to claim\n\nseniority on the basis of the applicability of the Quota\n\nRule. Consequently, the retrospective promotions granted\n\nto them under the order dated 10.07.2017 shall stand\n\nquashed. The promotions granted to them originally, shall\n\nhowever, subsist.\n\n87. The BBMP will have to thereby re-do the\n\nseniority list in the cadre of Manager without granting the\n\n- 98 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\ndirectly recruited FDAs retrospective seniority and grant\n\nthem seniority only from the date that they were initially\n\npromoted i.e., with effect from 25.07.2016.\n\n88. In respect of the writ petitions which have been\n\nfiled challenging the seniority list in the cadre of Assessor\n\ndated 08.11.2019, i.e., W.P. No. 1130/2020, W.P. No.\n\n3918/2020, W.P. No. 10879/2021 and W.P. No.\n\n18471/2022, it is to be stated here that the petitioners\n\nwere promoted as Assessors (re-designated post of Asst\n\nOctroi Superintendents) from the cadre of First Grade\n\nRevenue Inspectors, Revenue Inspectors and FDAs in the\n\nratio of 7:5:1, and as a consequence of the re-fixation of\n\nseniority in the cadre of FDAs by the gradation list dated\n\n09.09.2015, their respective seniority in the cadre of\n\nAssessor has been altered. In light of this judgment, by\n\nwhich the gradation list dated 09.09.2015 of FDAs,\n\nwherein the seniority assigned to the directly recruited\n\nFDAs has been quashed, the seniority of the petitioners\n\nwill have to be restored and they would have to be placed\n\n- 99 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\nabove the directly recruited FDAs. Consequently, the BBMP\n\nwill also have to re-do the seniority of the assessors, in\n\nlight of this judgment.\n\n89. W.P. No.56010/2018, which has been filed by\n\nthe direct recruits challenging the orders, by which the\n\npromotees were placed in independent charge under Rule\n\n32, will have to be dismissed, since it has now been held\n\nthat the promotions granted to the promotees in the cadre\n\nof FDA cannot be found fault with.\n\n90. W.P. No.5188/2021 filed by the direct recruits\n\ni.e., the persons who had been appointed on\n\ncompassionate grounds cannot be granted promotion on\n\nthe basis of the DPC decision dated 01.08.2018, since the\n\nright of the promotees to be placed above the direct\n\nrecruitees has been upheld by this order. Hence, said\n\npetition is also dismissed.\n\n91. Consequently, the second question is also\n\nanswered in favour of the promotees and it is held that the\n\n- 100 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:2508\n\nWP No. 1130 of 2020\n\nAnd Connected Matters\n\ndirectly recruited FDAs could not have been granted\n\nretrospective promotions and they could not also be\n\nassigned seniority over the persons who had been\n\npromoted from the promotee cadre.\n\n92. W.P. No.39961/2016, W.P. No.4296/2018, W.P.\n\nNo.9775/2018, W.P. No.1130/2020, W.P. No.3915/2020,\n\nW.P. No.10739/2020, W.P. No.10879/2021 & W.P. No.\n\n18471/2022 are allowed to the extent stated above.\n\n93. W.P. No.56010/2018 & W.P.No.5188/2021 are\n\ndismissed.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\nVnp*\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 3",
