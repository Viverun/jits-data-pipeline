This appeal by special leave is preferred against the\njudgment and order dated 14th September, 2004 of the High\nCourt of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench, whereby the\nHigh Court had quashed an FIR dated 31st December, 2001\nlodged at the instance of the appellant in the exercise of its\ninherent powers under\nSection 482\nof Code of Criminal\nProcedure (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code'). The said FIR\nwas registered by the complainant/appellant (in short \"the\nappellant\") against the accused/respondents (in short \"the\nrespondents\") for the alleged offences under\nSection 498-A\nand\nof IPC.\n\n3. Before we take up the questions that were posed before\nus by the learned counsel for the parties, it is necessary at this\nstage to state the facts giving rise to the filing of this appeal.\nAccordingly, the facts in a nutshell are stated below :\n\n4. The appellant had entered into wedlock with the\nrespondent No.2 on 25th January, 2000. The respondent Nos.1,\n3, 4 and 5 are the mother-in-law, brother-in-law, maternal\nfather-in-law and the father-in-law of the appellant respectively.\nThe appellant left her matrimonial home on 25th May, 2001\nwith her father and brother. In the FIR, the appellant alleged\nthat during her stay in her matrimonial home, she was subjected\nto harassment and cruelty by all the respondents as they were\ndissatisfied with the articles that the appellant had brought as\nstridhan. The respondents also forced her to bring Rs.5 lacs\nmore in dowry from her father which she could not bring from\nher parents nor could her parents afford to pay such a huge\namount. The respondents also did not allow the appellant to\ntake back her ornaments and other articles, which were gifted to\nher as stridhan when she left her matrimonial home. On 31st\nJuly, 2001, the husband, namely, respondent No.2 filed a\npetition before the Family Court praying for a decree for\ndivorce on the ground of mental cruelty. On 31st December,\n2001, the appellant lodged an FIR No.221 of 2001 against the\nrespondents for the alleged offences under\nSection 498A\nand\nof IPC. This FIR was challenged by way of a criminal\nmiscellaneous petition under\nSection 482\nof the Code in which\nthe respondents prayed for quashing of the said FIR. The\nrespondents had also obtained an order granting anticipatory\nbail from the Sessions Judge, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan on 8th\nFebruary, 2002. While the petition under\nSection 482\nof the\nCode was pending, a final investigation report was submitted\non 13th February, 2004 in the High Court. The High Court by\nthe impugned order had quashed the FIR No.221 of 2001 on the\nbasis of the report of the Investigating Officer submitted before\nit and concluded that no offence under\nSection 498A\nand\nof\nthe IPC was made out by the appellant against the respondents.\nThe High Court also observed that the FIR must be quashed to\navoid undue harassment and mental agony to the respondents,\nmore so when the divorce petition was still pending before the\nFamily Court. It is this order of the High Court, quashing the\nFIR in the exercise of its inherent power under\nSection 482\nof\nthe Code, which is now under challenge before us in this\nappeal.\n\n5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after\nconsidering the materials on record and the complaint filed by\nthe appellant under\nSections 498A\nand\nof the IPC, we are\nof the view that the High Court had exceeded its jurisdiction by\nquashing the FIR No.221 of 2001 in the exercise of its inherent\npowers under\nSection 482\nof the Code. Before we consider the\nscope and power of the High Court to quash an FIR in the\nexercise of its inherent powers under\nSection 482\nof the Code\neven before the parties are permitted to adduce evidence in\nrespect of the offences alleged to have been made under the\naforesaid two sections (namely,\nSections 498A\nand\nof IPC),\nwe may keep it on record that two questions merit our\ndetermination in the present case: - (i) whether the High Court\nwhile quashing the FIR in the exercise of its inherent powers\nunder\nSection 482\nof the Code was entitled to go beyond the\ncomplaint filed by the complainant; and (ii) whether the\nHigh Court was entitled to look into and consider the\ninvestigation report submitted by four officers of the rank of\nDy. Superintendent of Police for quashing the FIR even before\nthe same could be filed before the concerned Magistrate.\nBefore we do that, we may first consider how and when the\nHigh Court, in its inherent powers under\nSection 482\nof the\nCode, would be justified in quashing an FIR. It is at this stage\nappropriate to refer\nSection 482\nof the Code itself which runs as\nunder:\n\n\"482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court \u0016\nNothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or\naffect the inherent powers of the High Court to\nmake such orders as may be necessary to give\neffect to any order under this Code, or to prevent\nabuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to\nsecure the ends of justice.\"\n\nA bare look at this provision would show that while exercising\nsuch inherent powers, the High Court must be satisfied that\neither:-\n\n(i) An order passed under the Code would be rendered\nineffective; or\n\n(ii) The process of any court would be abused; or\n\n(iii) The ends of justice would not be secured.\n\nIn\nState of West Bengal Vs. Swapan Kumar Guha\n[1982 [1]\nSCC 561] Chandrachud, C.J. [as His Lordship then was] had\nobserved that if the FIR did not disclose the commission of a\ncognizable offence, the court would be justified in quashing the\ninvestigation on the basis of the information as laid or received.\nIn the same judgment, Justice A.N. Sen [as His Lordship then\nwas] who has written the main judgment, has laid down the\nlegal propositions as follows:\n\n\"...the legal position is well-settled. The legal position\nappears to be that if an offence is disclosed, the Court\nwill not normally interfere with an investigation into\nthe case and will permit investigation into the offence\nalleged to be completed; if, however, the materials do\nnot disclose an offence, no investigation should\nnormally be permitted.... Once an offence is disclosed,\nan investigation into the offence must necessarily\nfollow in the interests of justice. If, however, no\noffence is disclosed, an investigation cannot be\npermitted, as any investigation, in the absence of any\noffence being disclosed, will result in unnecessary\nharassment to a party, whose liberty and property\nmay be put to jeopardy for nothing. The liberty and\nproperty of any individual are sacred and sacrosanct\nand the court zealously guards them and protects\nthem. An investigation is carried on for the purpose of\ngathering necessary materials for establishing and\nproving an offence which is disclosed. When an\noffence is disclosed, a proper investigation in the\ninterests of justice becomes necessary to collect\nmaterials for establishing the offence, and for\nbringing the offender to book. In the absence of a\nproper investigation in a case where an offence is\ndisclosed, the offender may succeed in escaping from\nthe consequences and the offender may go unpunished\nto the detriment of the cause of justice and the society\nat large. Justice requires that a person who commits\nan offence has to be brought to book and must be\npunished for the same. If the court interferes with the\nproper investigation in a case where an offence has\nbeen disclosed, the offence will go unpunished to the\nserious detriment of the welfare of the society and the\ncause of justice suffers. It is on the basis of this\nprinciple that the court normally does not interfere\nwith the investigation of a case where an offence has\nbeen disclosed\u0005\u0005 Whether an offence has been\ndisclosed or not must necessarily depend on the facts\nand circumstances of each particular case.... If on a\nconsideration of the relevant materials, the court is\nsatisfied that an offence is disclosed, the court will\nnormally not interfere with the investigation into the\noffence and will generally allow the investigation into\nthe offence to be completed for collecting materials\nfor proving the offence\".\n\nIn\nPratibha Rani Vs. Suraj Kumar and Anr.\n[1985] 2 SCC\n370, this Court at page 395 observed as follows:\n\n\" It is well settled by a long course of decisions of this\nCourt that for the purpose of exercising its power\nunder\nSection 482\nCr PC to quash a FIR or a\ncomplaint the High Court would have to proceed\nentirely on the basis of the allegations made in the\ncomplaint or the documents accompanying the same\nper se. It has no jurisdiction to examine the\ncorrectness or otherwise of the allegations\".\n\n[emphasis supplied]\n\nIn\nMadhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia and Ors. v. Sambhajirao\nChandrojirao Angre and Ors.\n[1988 [1] SCC 692], this Court\nhas reiterated the same principle and laid down that when a\nprosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to\nbe applied by the court is as to whether the uncontroverted\nallegations as made prima facie establish the offence.\n\nAgain in the case of\nState of Bihar Vs. Murad Ali Khan &\nOrs.\n[1988 [4] SCC 655], Venkatachaliah, C.J. [as His\nLordship then was] has laid down that the jurisdiction under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code has to be exercised sparingly and with\ncircumspection and has observed that in exercising that\njurisdiction, the High Court should not embark upon an inquiry\nwhether the allegations in the complaint are likely to be\nestablished by evidence or not.\n\n6. From the principles\nlaid down in\nthe abovementioned\ndecisions, it is clear that the Court is entitled to exercise its\ninherent jurisdiction for quashing a criminal proceeding or an\nFIR when the allegations made in the same do not disclose the\ncommission of an offence and that it depends upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each particular case.\n\nWe also feel it just and\nproper to refer to a leading decision of this court reported in\n\nState of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal\n[1992 Suppl. {1} SCC 335]\nin which this court pointed out certain category of cases by way\nof illustrations wherein the inherent power under\nSection 482\nof\nthe Code can be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process\nof any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The\nsame are as follows :-\n\n(1) Where the allegations made in the first information\nreport or the complaint, even if they are taken at their\nface value and accepted in their entirety do not prima\nfacie constitute any offence or make out a case against\nthe accused.\n\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information\nreport and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR\ndo not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an\ninvestigation by police officers under\nSection 156(1)\nof\nthe Code except under an order of a Magistrate within\nthe purview of\nSection 155(2)\nof the Code.\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the\nFIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of\nthe same do not disclose the commission of any offence\nand make out a case against the accused.\n(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute\na cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable\noffence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer\nwithout an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under\n\nSection 155(2)\nof the Code.\n\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or\ncomplaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on\nthe basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a\njust conclusion that there is sufficient ground for\nproceeding against the accused.\n\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in\nany of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act\n(under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the\ninstitution and continuance of the proceedings and/or\nwhere there is a specific provision in the Code or the\nconcerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the\ngrievance of the aggrieved party.\n\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\nattended with malafide and/or where the proceeding is\nmaliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\nwreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to\nspite him due to private and personal grudge.\n\n7. Keeping the aforesaid principles in mind and considering\nthe decisions as referred to hereinearlier, let us now apply them\nin the facts of the present case. But before we do that, it would\nbe apt for us to consider the findings arrived at by the High\nCourt for quashing the FIR which are as under: -\n\n(i) The complainant-wife left the marital\nhouse with her father and brother on 25th\nMay, 2001. The Divorce Petition was\nfiled by the husband on the ground of\nmental cruelty on 31st July, 2001. It was\nonly on 31st December, 2001 that the\nFIR for offences under\nSections 498A\n\nand\nof IPC was lodged by the\ncomplainant-wife;\n\n(ii) A registered letter was sent to the\nappellant wife for receiving all her\narticles on 13th August, 2001 which was\nduly received by the father of the\nappellant;\n\n(iii) The family court also issued directions\nto the appellant to receive her articles on\n2nd February, 2002 and the same were\ndeclined by her;\n\n(iv) In view of the above and also in view of\nthe detailed report submitted by the\ninvestigating officer, even prima facie\nno offence under\nSection 498A\nand\nIPC is made out against the respondent;\n\n(v) The conduct of the appellant wife was\ndepreciable and there had been a\ncontinuing effort by her of avoiding the\nproceedings before the Court;\n\n(vi) The appellant wife leveled false\nallegations against the Court itself apart\nfrom adopting all sorts of unhealthy\ntactics by creating gimmicks and scenes\nin the Court;\n\n(vii) Merely because one of the respondents\nis a judicial officer and others being his\nfamily members, it did not preclude\nthem from seeking justice from a court\nof law;\n\n(viii) The High Court is empowered to quash\nthe FIR to avoid undue harassment and\nmental agony to the respondents, more\nso when the divorce petition is still\npending before the Family Court.\n\n8. From a plain reading of the findings arrived at by the\nHigh Court while quashing the FIR, it is apparent that the High\nCourt had relied on extraneous considerations and acted beyond\nthe allegations made in the FIR for quashing the same in the\nexercise of its inherent powers under\nSection 482\nof the Code.\nWe have already noted the illustrations enumerated in\nBhajan\nLal\n's case and from a careful reading of these illustrations, we\nare of the view that the allegations emerging from the FIR are\nnot covered by any of the illustrations as noted hereinabove.\nFor example, we may take up one of the findings of the High\nCourt as noted herein above. The High Court has drawn an\nadverse inference on account of the FIR being lodged on 31st\nDecember, 2001 while the appellant was forced out of the\nmatrimonial home on 25th May, 2001. In our view, in the facts\nand circumstance of the case, the High Court was not justified\nin drawing an adverse inference against the appellant- wife for\nlodging the FIR on 31st December, 2001 on the ground that she\nhad left the matrimonial home atleast six months before that.\nThis is because, in our view, the High Court had failed to\nappreciate that the appellant and her family members were,\nduring this period, making all possible efforts to enter into a\nsettlement so that the respondent No.2-husband would take her\nback to the matrimonial home. If any complaint was made\nduring this period, there was every possibility of not entering\ninto any settlement with the respondent No.2-husband. It is\npertinent to note that the complaint was filed only when all\nefforts to return to the matrimonial home had failed and the\nrespondent No.2-husband had filed a divorce petition under\n\nSection 13\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. That apart, in our\nview, filing of a divorce petition in a Civil Court cannot be a\nground to quash criminal proceedings under Section 482 of the\nCode as it is well settled that criminal and civil proceedings are\nseparate and independent and the pendency of a civil\nproceeding cannot bring to an end a criminal proceeding even if\nthey arise out of the same set of facts. Such being the position,\nwe are, therefore, of the view that the High Court while\nexercising its powers under Section 482 of the Code has gone\nbeyond the allegations made in the FIR and has acted in excess\nof its jurisdiction and, therefore, the High Court was not\njustified in quashing the FIR by going beyond the allegations\nmade in the FIR or by relying on extraneous considerations.\n\n9. This takes us to the second question which merits our\ndetermination, namely whether the High Court was entitled to\nconsider the investigation report submitted before it by four\nofficers of the rank of Dy. Superintendent of Police even before\nthe same could be filed before the concerned Magistrate. As\nnoted herein earlier, a bare perusal of the judgment of the High\nCourt would also show that the High Court had relied on the\ninvestigation report in quashing the FIR. Now, the question is\nwhether the High Court while exercising its powers under\nSection 482 of the Code was justified in relying on the\ninvestigation report which was neither filed before the\nMagistrate nor a copy of the same supplied to the appellant. In\nour view, the High Court has acted in excess of its jurisdiction\nby relying on the investigation report and the High Court was\nalso wrong in directing the report to be submitted before it. It is\nnow well settled that it is for the investigating agency to submit\nthe report to the Magistrate. In this connection, we may refer to\nsub-section (2) of Section 173 of the Code which runs as under\n\n:\n\n\"(i) As soon as it is completed the officer in charge\nof the police station shall forward to a Magistrate\nempowered to take cognizance of the offence on a\npolice report \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005(not necessary therefore\nomitted).\"\n\nFrom a bare reading of this provision, it cannot be\ndisputed that after completion of the investigation, the officer-\nin-charge of the police station shall forward the report not to the\nHigh Court where the proceedings under Section 482 of the\nCode is pending but to a Magistrate empowered to take\ncognizance of the offence on such police report. Therefore, the\nHigh Court had acted beyond its power to direct the\ninvestigating agency to file the said report before it in the\nexercise of power under Section 482 of the Code. The\nprocedure for submitting an investigation report has been\nconsidered by this Court in the case of\nM.C. Abraham and\nAnr. Vs. State of Maharashtra\n[ 2003] 2 SCC 649.\n\nWhile\nconsidering the law on the question as to when the report of the\ninvestigating agency shall be submitted before the Magistrate\nwhere the case is pending, an observation made in the case of\n\nAbhinandan Jha Vs. Dinesh Mishra\n[AIR 1968 SC117] was\nquoted with approval by B.P.Singh, J. in\nM.C. Abraham\n's case\n(supra) with which we are also in full agreement and which is\nas follows:\n\n\" Then the question is, what is the position, when the\nMagistrate is dealing with a report submitted by the\npolice, under Section 173, that no case is made out for\nsending up an accused for trial, which report, as we\nhave already indicated, is called, in the area in\nquestion, as a final report'? Even in those cases, if the\nMagistrate agrees with the said report, he may accept\nthe final report and close the proceedings. But there\nmay be instances when the Magistrate may take the\nview, on a consideration of the final report, that the\nopinion formed by the police is not based on a full\nand complete investigation, in which case, in our\nopinion, the Magistrate will have ample jurisdiction\nto give directions to the police, under Section 156(3),\nto make a further investigation. That is, if the\nMagistrate feels, after considering the final report,\nthat the investigation is unsatisfactory, or incomplete,\nor that there is scope for further investigation, it will\nbe open to the Magistrate to decline to accept the\nfinal report and direct the police to make further\ninvestigation under Section 156(3). The police, after\nsuch further investigation, may submit a charge-sheet,\nor, again submit a final report, depending upon the\nfurther investigation made by them. If ultimately, the\nMagistrate forms the opinion that the facts, set out in\nthe final report, constitute an offence, he can take\ncognizance of the offence, under Section 190(1)(b),\nnotwithstanding the contrary opinion of the police,\nexpressed in the final report.\n\nThe function of the Magistracy and the police, are\nentirely different, and though, in the circumstances\nmentioned earlier, the Magistrate may or may not\naccept the report, and take suitable action, according\nto law, he cannot certainly infringe (sic impinge)\nupon the jurisdiction of the police, by compelling them\nto change their opinion, so as to accord with his view.\n\nTherefore, to conclude, there is no power, expressly\nor impliedly conferred under the Code, on a\nMagistrate to call upon the police to submit a charge-\nsheet, when they have sent a report under Section 169\nof the Code, that there is no case made out for\nsending up an accused for trial.\"\n\nThis court in\nM.C. Abraham\n's case (supra) observed in para 17\nas under:\n\n\"The principle, therefore, is well settled that it is for\nthe investigating agency to submit a report to the\nMagistrate after full and complete investigation. The\ninvestigating agency may submit a report finding the\nallegations substantiated. It is also open to the\ninvestigating agency to submit a report finding no\nmaterial to support the allegations made in the first\ninformation report. It is open to the Magistrate\nconcerned to accept the report or to order further\nenquiry. But what is clear is that the Magistrate\ncannot direct the investigating agency to submit a\nreport that is in accord with his views. Even in a case\nwhere a report is submitted by the investigating\nagency finding that no case is made out for\nprosecution, it is open to the Magistrate to disagree\nwith the report and to take cognizance, but what he\ncannot do is to direct the investigating agency to\nsubmit a report to the effect that the allegations have\nbeen supported by the material collected during the\ncourse of investigation.\"\n\nIn our view, applying the principles\nlaid down in\nthe case of\n\nAbhinandan Jha\n(supra) and\nM.C.Abrahim\n(supra) as\nindicated herein above, using the report of the investigating\nagency for quashing the FIR or a criminal proceeding cannot be\nsustained. It was impermissible for the High Court to entertain\nthe report of the investigating agency before the same could be\nforwarded and filed before the concerned Magistrate in\ncompliance with Section 173(2) of the Code.\n\nIn\nUnion of India\nvs. Prakash P.Hinduja & Anr.\n[(2003) 6 SCC 195], this Court\nin para 20 observed as follows :\n\n\"Thus the legal position is absolutely clear and also\nsettled by judicial authorities that the court would not\ninterfere with the investigation or during the course of\ninvestigation which would mean from the time of the\nlodging of the First Information Report till the\nsubmission of the report by the officer-in-charge of\nthe police station in court under Section 173 (2) Code,\nthis field being exclusively reserved for the\ninvestigating agency.\"\n\nTherefore, in view of our discussions made herein above,\nwhile exercising power under Section 482 of the Code, it is not\nopen to the High Court to rely on the report of the investigating\nagency nor can it direct the report to be submitted before it as\nthe law is very clear that the report of the investigating agency\nmay be accepted by the Magistrate or the Magistrate may reject\nthe same on consideration of the material on record. Such\nbeing the position, the report of the investigating agency cannot\nbe relied on by the High Court while exercising powers under\nSection 482 of the Code. Accordingly, we are of the view that\nthe High Court has erred in quashing the FIR on consideration\nof the investigation report submitted before it even before the\nsame could be submitted before the Magistrate. For the reasons\naforesaid, we are inclined to interfere with the order of the High\nCourt and hold that the High Court in quashing the FIR in the\nexercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code\nby relying on the investigation report and the findings made\ntherein has acted beyond its jurisdiction. For the purpose of\nfinding out the commission of a cognizable offence, the High\nCourt was only required to look into the allegations made in the\ncomplaint or the FIR and to conclude whether a prima facie\noffence had been made out by the complainant in the FIR or the\ncomplaint or not.\n\n10. Before parting with this judgment, we may also remind\nourselves that the power under Section 482 of the Code has to\nbe exercised sparingly and in the rarest of rare cases. In our\nview, the present case did not warrant such exercise by the High\nCourt. For the reasons aforesaid, we are unable to sustain the\norder of the High Court and the impugned order is accordingly\nset aside. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.\nThe learned Magistrate is directed to proceed with the case in\naccordance with law. It is expected that the Magistrate shall\ndispose of the criminal proceedings as expeditiously as possible\npreferably within six months from the date of communication\nof this judgment.",

THIS APPEAL BY SPECIAL LEAVE IS PREFERRED AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER DATED 14TH SEPTEMBER, 2004 OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE FOR RAJASTHAN AT JAIPUR BENCH, WHEREBY THE HIGH COURT HAD QUASHED AN FIR DATED 31ST DECEMBER, 2001 LODGED AT THE INSTANCE OF THE APPELLANT IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS INHERENT POWERS UNDER SECTION 482 OF CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS 'THE CODE'). THE SAID FIR WAS REGISTERED BY THE COMPLAINANT/APPELLANT (IN SHORT \"THE APPELLANT\") AGAINST THE ACCUSED/RESPONDENTS (IN SHORT \"THE RESPONDENTS\") FOR THE ALLEGED OFFENCES UNDER SECTION 498-A AND OF IPC.  3. BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED BEFORE US BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES, IT IS NECESSARY AT THIS STAGE TO STATE THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE FILING OF THIS APPEAL. ACCORDINGLY, THE FACTS IN A NUTSHELL ARE STATED BELOW :  4. THE APPELLANT HAD ENTERED INTO WEDLOCK WITH THE RESPONDENT NO.2 ON 25TH JANUARY, 2000. THE RESPONDENT NOS.1, 3, 4 AND 5 ARE THE MOTHER-IN-LAW, BROTHER-IN-LAW, MATERNAL FATHER-IN-LAW AND THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF THE APPELLANT RESPECTIVELY. THE APPELLANT LEFT HER MATRIMONIAL HOME ON 25TH MAY, 2001 WITH HER FATHER AND BROTHER.
