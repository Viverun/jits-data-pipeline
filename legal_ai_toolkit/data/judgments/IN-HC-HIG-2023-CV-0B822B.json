Heard learned Senior Counsel Mr. Devang Nanavati\n\nassisted by learned counsel Mr. Tabish Samdani appearing\n\nfor the petitioner, and learned counsel Mr. Mohit Gupta\n\nappearing for the respondent.\n\n2. In the instant petition, seeking for appointment of\n\narbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act,\n\n1996', for short), two issues have been raised by the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent for consideration, raising an\n\nobjection with regard to appointment of Arbitrator on the\n\ndispute arising out of the Maintenance and Amenities\n\nAgreement (hereinafter referred to as 'M & E Agreement',\n\nfor short) dated 07.05.2018, and further with regard to the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the petition\n\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996.\n\n3. Contesting the claim of the petitioner to appoint\n\nArbitrator, to deal with the dispute arising out of the M & E\n\nAgreement, it is argued by the learned Senior Counsel for\n\nthe petitioner that M & E Agreement contains no arbitration\n\nPage 2 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nclause and the arbitration clause in the Lease Agreement\n\ndated 01.03.2018 cannot be invoked to refer the dispute to\n\nthe Arbitrator. Second submission is that, even if it is\n\nassumed for a moment without admitting that the arbitration\n\nclause under the Lease Agreement dated 01.03.2018 can be\n\ninvoked for appointment of Arbitrator to deal with the above\n\nnoted dispute, this Court does not have territorial jurisdiction\n\nto entertain the petition under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996,\n\ninasmuch as, the seat of the arbitration as agreed is at\n\nBangalore, as per Clause '25' of the agreement. It was\n\nargued that a bare reading of the Clause 25(ii) of the Lease\n\nAgreement indicates that the parties had agreed that the\n\narbitration proceedings will be conducted at Bangalore, and\n\nhence, the seat of the arbitration having been agreed, the\n\njurisdiction to entertain the petition under\nSection 11\nof the\n\nAct, 1996 can only be with the Karnataka High Court.\n\n4.

In reply to the objections raised by the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the respondent, it was argued by the\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner that the\n\npetitioner and the respondent had executed a Lease\n\nAgreement dated 01.03.2018 for leasing of the premises\n\nadmeasuring 68,890 sq. feet at Building No. 12, Jupiter\n\nIndustrial & Logiparks, Survey No. 607, Vadala Road, Village\n\nHariyala, District Kheda, Gujarat - 387120 for warehouses.\n\nAnother agreement named as M & E Agreement dated\n\n07.05.2018 was executed between the parties, whereunder\n\nthe respondent had agreed to maintain the premises under\n\nLease and provide various common services and amenities\n\nthere. Some dispute has arisen between the parties, as a\n\nresult of which, the petitioner had terminated the Lease\n\nPage 4 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nAgreement as also the Maintenance Agreement on\n\n07.07.2021, asking the respondent to take the possession of\n\nthe premises-in-question and also to refund the security\n\ndeposit paid by the petitioner under the M & E Agreement.\n\n6. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner that the respondent had failed to\n\nperform their contractual obligations and stopped the water\n\nsupply in the premises. The petitioner had issued pre-\n\narbitration notice dated 16.05.2022 disclosing its intention of\n\namicable settlement of disputes in terms of Clause '25' of the\n\nLease Agreement. By the reply dated 22.06.2022, the\n\nrespondent had denied the petitioner's stance mainly on the\n\nground that the Lease Agreement and M & E Agreement are\n\nseparate agreements and that though the disputes arising\n\nout of the Lase Agreement are subject to arbitration, the\n\narbitration proceedings with respect to the disputes arising\n\nout of the M & E Agreement, cannot be referred to the\n\narbitration by invoking Clause '25' of the Lease Agreement.\n\n7. It is argued by the learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nPage 5 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\npetitioner that M & E Agreement is an ancillary agreement,\n\nwhich is related to the principal agreement (which is Lease\n\nAgreement) and performance of one agreement was being\n\nintrinsically related to another agreement. Clause '25' of\n\nthe Lease Agreement can be invoked. The Clause 25 of the\n\nLease Agreement and the clauses of M & E Agreement\n\nplaced before the Court, are relevant to be noted\n\nhereinunder : -\n\n\"25. Dispute Resolution and Jurisdiction\n\ni. Disputes: The Parties shall attempt to amicably\nsettle any dispute arising out of this Agreement and\nthe obligations hereunder (\"Dispute\").

Arbitration: If any Dispute arising between the\nParties is not amicably settled within 10 days of\ncommencement of amicable attempts to settle the\nsame as provided above, such dispute shall be referred\nto, and be finally settled by arbitration proceedings.\nThe Parties agree that the arbitration proceedings will\nbe conducted at Bangalore and shall be governed by\nthe provisions of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act,\n. That the Dispute shall be adjudicated by a single\narbitrator mutually agreeable to, and appointed by,\nthe Parties. In the event the Parties fail to appoint a\nsingle arbitrator due to non-cooperation from the\nother Party, post due discussions, the other party shall\nbe free to appoint a sole arbitrator to conduct the\nProceedings.

Such\nArbitration will be conducted in Bangalore.\n\niii. Jurisdiction: Subject to the foregoing, the courts at\nAhmedabad only shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all\nmatters arising out of this Agreement.\n\nWITNESSETH\n\nA. WHEREAS on 1st March 2018 the Second party has\nentered into a Agreement to Lease a reprint with\nminor modifications was then registered with Sub\nRegistrar Kheda on 7th April 2018 with various owners\nof the building block No. A2, lying and situate in the\nproject named Jupiter Industrial & Logiparks, Survey\nNo 607p, Vadala Road, Village Hariyala, Distt. Kheda,\nGujarat together with right to use project's common\narea, passages along with four-wheeler parking\nfacilities, right of ingress to and egress from the said\nbuilding A2, water, sanitary and power amenities.\n\nB. The property that the Second Party have taken on\nlease under the Agreement to Lease mentioned in\nClause - 1 above, is more fully described in Schedule\n'A' annexed hereto and shall hereinafter be referred to\nas the 'Leased Premises'.\n\nC. The Second party has requested the First party to\nprovide certain services in the Project named Jupiter\nIndustrial & Logiparks required for business purpose\nof the second Party to enable the Second Party to start\nand conduct its business operations and more fruitfully\nenjoy the Leased Premises. First party has agreed to\nprovide the services on the Terms & Conditions\nhereinafter contained. This Agreement shall\nhereinafter be referred to as the Service Level\nAgreement.\n\nNOW THIS SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT\nWITNESSES AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1) GRANT:\n\nIn consideration of the payment of maintenance\ncharges and amenities charges reserved hereunder,\nthe First Party shall provide to the Second Party, the\n\nPage 7 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nservices and amenities as set out in this agreement at\nthe common area of the Jupiter Industrial & Logiparks.\n\n2) TERM:\n\nThis Agreement shall be operative & co-terminus from\nthe date of the operation of the Agreement to Lease dt.\n1st March 2018 (01.03.2018) and shall be operative\nuntil the term of the said Agreement ie 01.03.2018 to\n28.02.2027 to Lease and to be executed as registered\nLease Deed and renewal thereof as provided in the\nsaid Agreement to Lease or Registered Lease Deed, as\nthe case may be. Provided specifically that this\nagreement shall be co-terminus with the term of or\nearly termination of any of the said Agreements, as the\ncase may be.\"\n\n8. The submission of the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner is that the fact that the M & E\n\nAgreement has been made operative and co-terminus from\n\nthe date of operation of the agreement to lease dated\n\n01.03.2018, and further has been made operative only under\n\nthe terms of the Lease Agreement, makes it clear that M & E\n\nAgreement is an ancillary agreement, which was intrinsically\n\nrelated to principal agreement. In absence of M & E\n\nAgreement, the petitioner was not in position to enjoy the\n\npremises as the responsibilities of the respondent in carrying\n\nout the operation as contemplated by M & E Agreement were\n\nto be discharged with respect to the premises on lease. The\n\nLease Agreement being the Mother agreement, the\n\nPage 8 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\narbitration clause therein would have to be invoked for\n\ndeciding the disputes arising out of the ancillary agreement,\n\nwhich is M & E Agreement. The claims of the petitioner\n\ncannot be bifurcated in two different jurisdictions.\n\n9. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Apex Court\n\nin the case of\nChloro Controls India Private Ltd. vs.\n\nSevern Trent Water Purification Inc. & Ors.\nreported in\n\n(\n2013) 1 SCC 641, Ameet Lalchand Shah and Others\n\nversus Rishabh Enterprises and Another\nreported in\n\n(\n2018) 15 SCC 678, and Duro Felguera S.A. versus\n\nGangavaram Port Ltd.\nreported in (2017) 9 SCC 729, to\n\nsubmit that the question whether or not the arbitration\n\nclause contained in another document is incorporated in the\n\ncontract, is always a question of construction of document\n\nwith reference to the intention of the parties. In a case,\n\nwhere several parties are involved in a single transaction, or\n\ncommercial project, all the parties can be covered by the\n\narbitration clause in the main agreement. In cases involving\n\nexecution of multiple agreements between the same parties,\n\ntwo essential features are to be seen; firstly, that all ancillary\n\nPage 9 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nagreements are related to Mother agreement and, secondly,\n\nperformance of one is so intrinsically interlinked with the\n\nother agreement that they are incapable of being beneficially\n\nperformed without performance of the others or severed\n\nfrom the rest. The intention of the parties to refer all the\n\ndisputes of the parties to the Arbitral Tribunal is one of the\n\ndeterminative factor. Where agreements are consequential\n\nand in the nature of a follow-up to the principal or mother\n\nagreement, the latter containing the arbitration agreement\n\nand such agreement being so intrinsically intermingled or\n\ninterdependent that it is their composite performance which\n\nshall discharge the parties to their respective mutual\n\nobligations and performances, that would be a sufficient\n\nindicator of intent of the parties to refer signatory as well as\n\nnon-signatory parties to arbitration.\n\n10. On the question of territorial jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt, according to Clause '25' of the Lease Agreement, it is\n\nargued by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that\n\nthe statement in Clause '25' that \"the parties agree that the\n\narbitration proceedings will be conducted at Bangalore\", will\n\nPage 10 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\ngive only an indication that the parties had agreed to the\n\n'venue', and not the 'seat' of arbitration.\nSection 20(3)\nof the\n\nAct, 1996 gives freedom to the Arbitral Tribunal to meet at\n\nany place for conducting hearings at the place of\n\nconvenience in the matter, such as, consultation among its\n\nmembers, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties. It is\n\nfurther submitted that same clause '25' states with regard to\n\njurisdiction that \"Courts at Ahmedabad only shall have\n\nexclusive jurisdiction in all matters arising out of this\n\nagreement.\" If both the above statements in Clause 25 (ii)\n\nand (iii) are read together and analysed to ascertain the\n\nintention of the parties, it can be seen that Bangalore was\n\nchosen as the 'venue' and not the 'seat'. The arbitration\n\nagreement at Clause '25' provides that exclusive jurisdiction\n\nvests with Courts at Ahmedabad; the agreement was\n\nexecuted and stamped in Gujarat; the respondent is situated\n\nin Ahmedabad and the petitioner has its Corporate\n\nheadquarters in Ahmedabad; the premises in dispute is\n\nlocated in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. All these situation\n\ncumulatively establish that the seat of Arbitration is\n\nPage 11 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nAhmedabad.\n\n11. Reliance is placed on the decision of the High Court\n\nof Calcutta in the case of\nHomevista Decor and\n\nFurnishing Pvt. Ltd. and Another versus Connect\n\nResiduary Private Limited\nreported in 2023 SCC\n\nOnLine Cal 1405, decisions of High Court of Delhi in the\n\ncase of\nCravants Media Private Limited versus\n\nJharkhand State Co. Operative Milk Producers\n\nFederation Ltd. and Another\nreported in 2021 SCC\n\nOnLine Del 5350, and in the case of Mrs. Meenakshi\n\nNehra Bhat and Anr. Versus Wave Megacity Centre\n\nPrivate Limited passed in Arbitration Petition No.\n\n706/2020 and the latest decision of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of M/s.\nRavi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd. versus\n\nAditya Kumar Chatterjee\npassed in Civil Appeal arising\n\nout of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s). 17397-\n\n17398/2021, to submit that only in case where there is a\n\nstandalone clause in the agreement, which states that\n\narbitration is to be held at a particular place, then that place\n\nPage 12 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nwould be the 'seat' of arbitration. However, in cases, where\n\nthere are other clauses in the agreement and are contrary\n\nindicative that the stated place of arbitration is merely a\n\n'venue' and not the 'seat' of the arbitral proceedings, the\n\nCourts to the exclusive jurisdiction of which the parties have\n\nsubmitted for entertaining the disputes arising out of the\n\nagreement, would have exclusive jurisdiction even in the\n\nmatter of appointment of Arbitrator under\nSection 11\nof the\n\nAct, 1996.\n\n12. It is argued that the decisions relied upon the\n\nlearned Counsel for the respondent in the case of\nBGS SGS\n\nSoma JV versus NPHC Ltd.\nreported in (2020) 4 SCC\n\n234, will not be of benefit to the respondent, inasmuch as\n,\n\nthe said decision\npertains to international commercial\n\narbitration, and it was noted by the Apex Court therein that\n\nthere being no other significant contrary indica that the\n\nstated venue was merely a \"venue\" and not the \"seat\" of the\n\narbitral proceedings, it would conclusively show that such a\n\nclause designated \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings.\n\nHowever, it was held therein that other clauses of the\n\nPage 13 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nagreement must be read to ascertain whether a venue is\n\nactually the seat or simplicitor a place owing to there being a\n\ncontrary indica, in the form of further clauses or conduct of\n\nthe parties.\n\n13. The decision in the case of\nCinepolis India Pvt.\n\nLtd. versus Celebration City Projects Pvt. Ltd. and\n\nAnother\nreported in 2020 SCC Online Del 301, relied by\n\nthe Counsel for the respondents has been distinguished with\n\nthe submission that the same was taken note by the Delhi\n\nHigh Court in the subsequent decision in\nKush Raj Bhatia\n\nversus DLF Power and Services Limited\nthrough its\n\nDirector reported in 2022\nSCC OnLine Del 3309, Mrs.\n\nMeenakshi Nehra Bhat and Anr.

It\n\nwas, thus, submitted that in view of the above noted decision\n\nof the Delhi High Court, clear law laid down therein, the\n\ndecisions relied by the respondent Counsel will have no\n\napplication.\n\n14. Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused\n\nthe record. On the first question with respect to the\n\ninvocation of arbitration clause '25' of the Lease Agreement,\n\nto seek appointment of Arbitrator with respect to the\n\ndisputes arising out of M & E Agreement, the decision of the\n\nApex Court in the case of\nChloro Controls India Private\n\nLimited versus Seevern Trent Water Purification Inc.\n\nand Others\n(Supra), is relevant to be noted. Relevant\n\nparagraphs 73 and 74 of\nthe said decision\nare extracted\n\nPage 15 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nhereinunder : -\n\n\"73. A non-signatory or third party could be subjected\nto arbitration without their prior consent, but this\nwould only be in exceptional cases. The Court will\nexamine these exceptions from the touchstone of direct\nrelationship to the party signatory to the arbitration\nagreement, direct commonality of the subject matter\nand the agreement between the parties being a\ncomposite transaction. The transaction should be of a\ncomposite nature where performance of mother\nagreement may not be feasible without aid, execution\nand performance of the supplementary or ancillary\nagreements, for achieving the common object and\ncollectively having bearing on the dispute. Besides all\nthis, the Court would have to examine whether a\ncomposite reference of such parties would serve the\nends of justice. Once this exercise is completed and the\nCourt answers the same in the affirmative, the\nreference of even non-signatory parties would fall\nwithin the exception afore-discussed.\n\n74. In a case like the present one, where origin and\nend of all is with the Mother or the Principal\nAgreement, the fact that a party was non-signatory to\none or other agreement may not be of much\nsignificance. The performance of any one of such\nagreements may be quite irrelevant without the\nperformance and fulfillment of the Principal or the\nMother Agreement. Besides designing the corporate\nmanagement to successfully complete the joint\nventures, where the parties execute different\nagreements but all with one primary object in mind, the\nCourt would normally hold the parties to the bargain of\narbitration and not encourage its avoidance. In cases\ninvolving execution of such multiple agreements, two\nessential features exist; firstly, all ancillary agreements\nare relatable to the mother agreement and secondly,\nperformance of one is so intrinsically inter- linked with\nthe other agreements that they are incapable of being\nbeneficially performed without performance of the\nothers or severed from the rest. The intention of the\nparties to refer all the disputes between all the parties\nto the arbitral tribunal is one of the determinative\n\nPage 16 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nfactor.\"\n\n15.\nIn\nDuro Felguera S.A. versus Gangavaram Port\n\nLtd.\n(supra), it was held in paragraph 35 as under : -\n\n\"35.\nSection 7(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Act, 2015 reads as under:-\n\n\"7. Arbitration agreement.--(1)-(4)\n\n(5) The reference in a contract to a document\ncontaining an arbitration clause constitutes an\narbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and\nthe reference is such as to make that arbitration\nclause part of the contract.\"\n\nAs per\nSection 7 (5)\nof the Act, even though the\ncontract between the parties does not contain a\nprovision for arbitration, an arbitration clause\ncontained in an independent document will be\nimported and engrafted in the contract be- tween the\nparties, by reference to such independent document\nin the contract, if the reference is such as to make the\narbitration clause in such document, a part of the\ncontract. Section 7(5) requires a conscious\nacceptance of the arbitration clause from another\ndocument, as a part of their contract, before such\narbitration clause could be read as a part of the\ncontract between the parties. The question whether\nor not the arbitration clause contained in another\ndocument, is incorporated in the contract, is always a\nquestion of construction of document in reference to\nintention of the parties. The terms of a contract may\nhave to be ascertained by reference to more than one\ndocument.\"\n\n16.\nIn\nAmeet Lalchand Shah and Others versus\n\nRishabh Enterprises and Another\n(supra), it was held in\n\nPage 17 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nparagraphs 17, 21 and 22 as under : -\n\n\"17. xxxxxxxx........\n\nThrough the Sale and Purchase Agreement\n(05.03.2012) does not have any arbitration clause, by\nthe above clauses, it is clearly linked with the main\nagreement - Equipment Lease Agreement\n(14.03.2012). Sale and Purchase Agreement was\nentered into between Astonfield and Rishabh only for\nthe purpose of onward transmission of leasing of the\ngoods by Rishabh to Dante Energy. There is no merit\nin the contention that the Sale and Purchase\nAgreement is not connected with the Equipment\nLease Agreement with Dante Energy.\"\n\n21. Mr. Sibal, learned senior counsel for the\nrespondents submitted that the High Court rightly\nrelied upon Sukanya Holdings as it relates to\nPart-I of\nthe Act\nthat the parties who are not signatories to the\narbitration agreement (in this case, Astonfield under\nSale and Purchase Agreement) cannot be referred to\narbitration. It was further submitted that Chloro\nControls arises under\nPart-II of the Act\nand was\nrightly distinguished by the High Court and Sukanya\nHoldings was not overruled by Chloro Controls and\nhence, the appellants cannot rely upon Chloro\nControls. It was contended that the Sale and\nPurchase Agreement (05.03.2012) under which huge\nmoney was parted with, is the main agreement\nhaving no arbitration clause cannot be referred to\narbitration. It was submitted that the subject matter\nof the suit cannot be bifurcated between the parties\nto arbitration agreement and others.\n\n22. In Chloro Controls, this Court was dealing with\nthe scope and interpretation of\nSection 45\nof the Act -\n\nPart-II of the Act\nand in that context, discussed the\nscope of relevant principles on the basis of which a\nnon-signatory party also could be bound by the\narbitration agreement.

The other\n\ntwo agreements; (i) Equipment and Material Supply\n\nContract and (ii) Engineering, Installation and\n\nCommissioning Contract were ancillary agreements which\n\nled to the main purpose of commissioning the Photovoltaic\n\nSolar Plant. Even though, the sale and projects\n\nagreements did not contain arbitration clause, it being\n\nintegrally connected with the commissioning of the Solar\n\nPlant, even though the parties to the subsequent\n\nagreement are not signatories to the main agreement i.e.\n\nPage 19 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nEquipment Lease Agreement, the disputes between the\n\nparties to various agreements could be resolved only by\n\nreferring all the agreements and the parties thereon to\n\narbitration. In such a case, all the parties can be covered\n\nby the arbitration clause in the main agreement i.e.\n\nEquipment Lease Agreement.\n\n17. We may note further decision in the case of\nM.R.\n\nEngineers and Contractors Private Limited versus Som\n\nDatt Builders Limited\nreported in (2009) 7 SCC 696,\n\nrelied on by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner,\n\nreferring to the wordings of\nSection 7(5)\nof the Act, 1996,\n\nwherein it is held that : -\n\n\"15. Section 7(5) therefore requires a conscious\nacceptance of the arbitration clause from another\ndocument, by the parties, as a part of their contract,\nbefore such arbitration clause could be read as a part\nof the contract between the parties.\nBut the Act\ndoes\nnot contain any indication or guidelines as to the\nconditions to be fulfilled before a reference to a\ndocument in a contract, can be construed as a\nreference incorporating an arbitration clause\ncontained in such document, into the contract. In the\nabsence of such statutory guidelines, the normal\nrules of construction of contracts will have to be\nfollowed.\n\n16. There is a difference between reference to\n\nPage 20 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nanother document in a contract and incorporation of\nanother document in a contract, by reference. In the\nfirst case, the parties intend to adopt only specific\nportions or part of the referred document for the\npurposes of the contract. In the second case, the\nparties intend to incorporate the referred document\nin entirety, into the contract. Therefore when there is\na reference to a document in a contract, the court has\nto consider whether the reference to the document is\nwith the intention of incorporating the contents of\nthat document in entirety into the contract, or with\nthe intention of adopting or borrowing specific\nportions of the said document for application to the\ncontract.\n\n18. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has\n\nfurther relied upon the decision in the\nState of M.P. and\n\nanother versus Mahendra Kumar Saraf and Others\n\nreported in 2005 (3) M.P.L.J. 578, to submit the meaning\n\nof co-terminus as it should mean to imply two things or\n\nobjects having the same end, same finishing point or same\n\nterminating point. It is argued that both the agreements\n\nnamely Lease Agreement and M & E Agreement have 'co-\n\nterminus' and integrally related to each other, performance\n\nof Lease Agreement being dependent upon the M & E\n\nAgreement, both being part of the same transaction, the\n\narbitration clause '25' in the Lease Agreement will have to\n\nbe invoked to refer the dispute to the Arbitrator.\n\nPage 21 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\n19. From the above noted discussion, taking note of the\n\ndecisions of the Apex Court, this Court finds itself in\n\ncomplete agreement with the contention of the learned\n\nSenior Counsel for the petitioner that performance of the\n\nLease Agreement was not possible without performance of\n\nthe M & E Agreement. They being integrally related to each\n\nother, even if there is no separate arbitration clause in M &\n\nE Agreement, the intention of the parties can be ascertained\n\nfrom the Lease Agreement that they had agreed to refer the\n\ndisputes arising out of the transaction, which is lease of the\n\npremises-in-question to arbitration. The petitioner cannot be\n\nforced to submit to two different Forums to determine the\n\ndisputes arising out of one single transaction. The\n\narbitration clause '25' of the Lease Agreement is a conscious\n\nacceptance of the agreement clause as part of the M & E\n\nAgreement between the parties in view of the above noted\n\nfacts and the language employed in\nSection 7(5)\nof the Act,\n\n1996. The objections raised by the learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondent with regard to invocation of Clause '25' of the\n\nLease Agreement seeking to refer the disputes arising out of\n\nPage 22 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nthe M & E Agreement to the Arbitrator, therefore, is liable to\n\nbe turned down.\n\n20. Coming to the question of territorial jurisdiction of\n\nthis Court to entertain the application under\nSection 11\nof\n\nthe Act, 1996, the contention of the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent that this Court lacks jurisdiction to appoint\n\nArbitrator under Section 11, is based on the statement in the\n\nLease Agreement, noted above, which states that \"the parties\n\nagree that the arbitration proceedings will be conducted at\n\nBangalore\". The contention is that this statement in the\n\nLease Agreement not only decides the \"venue\" but also the\n\n\"seat\" of arbitration.\n\n21. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, however,\n\nrelied upon various judgments of the Apex Court and Delhi\n\nHigh Court as noted above to submit that reference to the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in\nBGS SGS Soma JV versus\n\nNPHC Ltd.\n(supra) and Delhi High Court in the case of\n\nCinepolis India Pvt. Ltd. versus Celebration City\n\nProjects Pvt. Ltd. and Another\n(supra), to assert that\n\nPage 23 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nplace of arbitration, the venue, is really the seat of\n\narbitration is misplaced. The submission is that these\n\njudgments are distinguishable in the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case as a result of misreading of the decision of the\n\nApex Court.\n\n22. To examine the issue, this Court is required to note\n\nthe decision of the Apex Court\nBGS SGS Soma JV versus\n\nNPHC Ltd.\n(\nsupra), Mankastu Impex Private Limited\n\nversus Airvisual Limited\nreported in (2020) 5 SCC 399,\n\nwherein the question of \"seat\" and \"venue\" with reference to\n\nthe arbitration proceedings has been decided.\n\nIn\nBGS SGS\n\nSoma JV versus NPHC Ltd.\n(supra), the issue was\n\npertaining to maintainability of appeal under\nSection 37\nof\n\nthe Act, 1996, on the premise that in view of the arbitration\n\nclause, whether the seat of arbitration proceedings was New\n\nDelhi or Faridabad, consequent upon which the petition\n\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Act, 1996 may be filed dependent on\n\nwhere the seat of arbitration was located.\n\n23. The Apex Court has noted therein that in the\n\nPage 24 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\njudgment impugned, the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\nreferred two earlier decisions of the Apex Court in\nBharat\n\nAluminum Co.(BALCO) vs. Kaiser Aluminum\nreported\n\nin (\n2012) 9 SCC 522 and Indus Mobile Distribution (P)\n\nLtd. versus Datawind Innovations (P) Ltd.\nreported in\n\n(2017) 7 SCC 678, along with other decisions to arrive at a\n\nconclusion that the arbitration clause\nin that case\ndid not\n\nrefer to the seat of arbitration, but only referred to the\n\n\"venue\" of arbitration. Consequently, since a part of the\n\ncause of action had arisen in Faridabad, the Faridabad\n\nCommercial Court alone would have jurisdiction over the\n\narbitral proceedings, and the Courts at New Delhi would\n\nhave no such jurisdiction. The correctness of the said\n\nproposition was assailed before the Apex Court. The Apex\n\nCourt has proceeded to lay down the law on what constitutes\n\nthe \"juridical seat\" of arbitration proceedings, and whether,\n\nonce the seat is delineated by the arbitration agreement,\n\ncourts at the place of the seat would alone, thereafter, have\n\nexclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.\n\n24. Considering the scheme of the old\nArbitration Act\n,\n\nPage 25 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\n1940, it was observed therein that it did not refer to the\n\njuridical seat of the arbitration proceedings at all. The\n\nUNCITRAL Model of International Commercial Courts as\n\nadopted by the United Nations Commission on International\n\nTrade Law on 21.06.1985, introduced the concept of \"place\"\n\nor \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, which has been adopted\n\nby our country.\nThe Arbitration Act, 1996\nwhich repealed\n\nthe\nArbitration Act, 1940\n, adopted provisions of UNCITRAL\n\nModel and refers to \"the place\" of arbitration and defines\n\n\"Courts\", and indicates which Courts have jurisdiction in\n\nrelation to arbitral proceedings. The provisions in Part - I in\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\n,\n2(2)\n, Section 20,\nSection 31(4)\nand\nof the\n\nAct, 1996, noted therein are relevant to be extracted as\n\nunder : -\n\n\"2.Definitions. -\n\n(1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise\nrequires,-\n\n(a) to (d) - xxxxxx...xxxxxx...xxxxxx\n\n(e)\"Court\" means-\n\n(i) in case of an arbitration other than international\n\nPage 26 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\ncommercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of\noriginal jurisdiction in a district, and includes the\nHigh Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\njurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the\nquestions forming the subject-matter of the\narbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of\na suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade\ninferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of\nSmall Causes;\n\n(ii) in the case of international commercial\narbitration, the High Court in exercise of its ordinary\noriginal civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide\nthe questions forming the subject-matter of a suit if\nthe same had been the subject-matter of a suit, and in\nother cases, a High Court having jurisdiction to hear\nappeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that\nHigh Court;\n\n(f) to (h) -xxxxxx...xxxxxx...xxxxxx\n\n(2) This part shall apply where the place of\narbitration is in India.\n\nProvided that subject to an agreement to the\ncontrary, the provisions of sections 9, 27 and clause\n\n(a) of sub-section (1) and sub-section (3) of Section 37\nshall also apply to international commercial\narbitration, even if the place of arbitration is outside\nIndia, and an arbitral award or to be made in such\nplace is enforceable and recognised under the\nprovisions of Part II of this Act.\"\n\n20.

It was further discussed in paragraph '31' and '32' in\n\nBGS SGS Soma JV versus NPHC Ltd.\n(supra) that from\n\nthe above noted provisions, the new concept of \"juridical\n\nseat\" of the arbitration proceedings has been given by the\n\nAct, 1996 and the arbitral award is now not only to state its\n\ndate, but also the place of arbitration as determined in\n\naccordance with Section 20. However, the definition of\n\nPage 28 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\n\"Court\" has been narrowed down to mean only principal civil\n\ncourt and the High Court in exercise of their original\n\nordinary civil jurisdiction. Thus, the concept of \"juridical\n\nseat\" of the arbitral proceedings, and its relationship to the\n\njurisdiction of the courts which are then to look into matters\n\nrelating to the arbitral proceedings including challenges to\n\narbitral awards had to be developed in accordance with\n\ninternational practice on a case by case basis by the Apex\n\nCourt.\n\nNoticing that in some of the earlier decisions of the\n\nApex Court, no proper distinction between the \"seat\" and\n\n\"venue\" of arbitral proceedings was made, the observations\n\nin the judgment in the case of\nUnion of India versus\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation\nreported in (1993) 2\n\nLloyd's Rep 48, were noted that the provisions of\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\nof the Act, 1996 had been considered therein to\n\nprovide jurisdiction of the original Civil Court and the High\n\nCourt to decide the question forming \"the subject matter of\n\nthe arbitration\", if the same had been the subject matter of a\n\nsuit. The term \"subject matter of the arbitration\" cannot be\n\nPage 29 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nconfused with \"subject matter of the suit\". The term \"subject\n\nmatter\" in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nis confined to\nPart I of the Act,\n. It has a reference and connection with the process of\n\ndispute resolution. It's purpose is to identify the courts\n\nhaving supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings.\n\nHence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court\n\nof the seat of the arbitration process. It was noted that the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 2(1)(e)\nhave to be construed keeping in\n\nview the provisions in Section 20, which give recognition to\n\nparty autonomy. It was further noted that the legislature has\n\nintentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court\n\nwhich would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is\n\nlocated and the courts where the arbitration takes place.\n\nTherefore, the Courts where the arbitration takes place,\n\nwould be required to exercise supervisory control over the\n\narbitral process. It was observed : -\n\n\"33. xxxxxxx ...........xxxxx\n\n96 xxxxxxxxx For example, if the arbitration is held\nin Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi,\n(Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as be-\ntween a party from Mumbai and the other from\nKolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an\n\nPage 30 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\ninterim order Under\nSection 17\nof the Arbitration\nAct, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order\nunder Section 37 must lie to the Courts of Delhi\nbeing the Courts having supervisory jurisdiction over\nthe arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This\nwould be irrespective of the fact that the obligations\nto be performed under the contract were to be\nperformed either at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only\narbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such\ncircumstances, both the Courts would have\njurisdiction, i.e., the Court within whose jurisdiction\nthe subject matter of the suit is situated and the\ncourts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute\nresolution, i.e., arbitration is located.\"\n\n26. It was further noted that a plain reading of the\n\nSection 20 leaves no room for doubt that where the place of\n\narbitration is in India, the parties are free to agree to any\n\n\"place\" or \"seat\" within India. In absence of the agreement\n\nof the parties thereto, Sub-section (2) of Section 20\n\nauthorizes the tribunal to determine the place / seat of such\n\narbitration. Section 20(3), however, enables the tribunal to\n\nmeet at any place for conducting hearings at a place of\n\nconvenience in matters such as consultations among its\n\nmembers for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties. The\n\nobservations in paragraph 99 in\nMcDonnell Douglas\n\nCorporation\n(supra), emphasis to which is supplied\n\ntherein, are relevant to be extracted hereinunder : -\n\nPage 31 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\n\"99. The fixation of the most convenient \"venue\" is taken\ncare of by Section 20(3). Section 20, has to be read in\nthe context of\nSection 2(2)\n, which places a threshold\nlimitation on the applicability of Part I, where the place\nof arbitration is in India. Therefore, Section 20 would\nalso not support the submission of the extra-territorial\napplicability of Part I, as canvassed by the Learned\nCounsel for the Appellants, so far as purely domestic\narbitration is concerned.\"\n\n(emphasis in original and supplied)\n\n27. While examining the concept of \"juridical seat\" of the\n\narbitral proceedings and the important test\nlaid down in\nthe\n\ndecision of the English Courts and the Apex Court, in order\n\nto determine whether the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings\n\nhas, in fact, been indicated in the agreement between the\n\nparties, it was observed by the Apex Court in BGS SGS\n\nSoma JV versus NPHC Ltd. (Supra), in paragraph '82' as\n\nunder : -\n\n\"82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it\nmay be concluded that whenever there is the\ndesignation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration\nclause as being the \"venue\" of the arbitration\nproceedings, the expression \"arbitration proceedings\"\n\nwould make it clear that the \"venue\" is really the\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid\nexpression does not include just one or more\nindividual or particular hearing, but the arbitration\nproceedings as a whole, including the making of an\naward at that place. This language has to be\ncontrasted with language such as \"tribunals are to\nmeet or have witnesses, experts or the parties\" where\nonly hearings are to take place in the \"venue\", which\n\nPage 32 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nmay lead to the conclusion, other things being equal,\nthat the venue so stated is not the \"seat\" of arbitral\nproceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting.\nFurther, the fact that the arbitral proceedings \"shall\nbe held\" at a particular venue would also indicate that\nthe parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to\na particular place, signifying thereby, that that place\nis the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled\nwith there being no other significant contrary indicia\nthat the stated venue is merely a \"venue\" and not the\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, would then\nconclusively show that such a clause designates a\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings. In an International\ncontext, if a supranational body of rules is to govern\nthe arbitration, this would further be an indicia that\n\"the venue\", so stated, would be the seat of the\narbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would\nbe replaced by the\nArbitration Act, 1996\nas applying\nto the \"stated venue\", which then becomes the \"seat\"\nfor the purposes of arbitration.\"\n\n28.\nIn\nMankastu Impex Private Limited versus\n\nAirvisual Limited\n(supra), the Apex Court was dealing with\n\nthe question of maintainability of the petition under\nSection\n\n11(6)\nof the Act, 1996 in the matter of international\n\ncommercial arbitration.\nThe decision in the case of BGS\n\nSGS Soma JV versus NPHC Ltd. (Supra), has been\n\nconsidered to note that it was held therein that in absence of\n\ncontrary expression expressed by the parties, the conclusion\n\nhas to be drawn that the parties have chosen the place where\n\narbitration proceedings were held as the seat of arbitration\n\nunder\nSection 20(1)\nof the Act. It was noted that as per\n\nPage 33 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nSection 2(2)\n, Part - I, shall apply where the place of\n\narbitration is in India. If the \"international commercial\n\narbitration\" is seated in India, then Part - I of the Act shall\n\napply. It was observed in paragraph '19' and '20' therein as\n\nunder : -\n\n\"19. The seat of arbitration is a vital aspect of any\narbitration proceedings. Significance of the seat of\narbitration is that it determines the applicable law\nwhen deciding the arbitration proceedings and\narbitration procedure as well as judicial review over\nthe arbitration award. The situs is not just about\nwhere an institution is based or where the hearings\nwill be held. But it is all about which court would\nhave the supervisory power over the arbitration\nproceedings.\nIn\nEnercon (India) Limited and others\nv. Enercon GMBH and another\n, (2014) 5 SCC 1, the\nSupreme Court held that\n\n\"The location of the Seat will determine the\ncourts that will have exclusive jurisdiction to\noversee the arbitration proceedings. It was further\nheld that the Seat normally carries with it the\nchoice of that country's arbitration/curial law\".\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n20. It is well-settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and\n\"venue of arbitration\" cannot be used inter-\nchangeably. It has also been established that mere\nexpression \"place of arbitration\" cannot be the\nbasis to determine the intention of the parties that\nthey have intended that place as the \"seat\" of\narbitration. The intention of the parties as to the\n\"seat\" should be determined from other clauses in\nthe agreement and the conduct of the parties.\"\n\n29. It was considered that though the arbitration\n\nPage 34 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nagreement entered into between the parties provided Hong\n\nKong as the place of arbitration, however that fact by itself\n\nwill not be lead to the conclusion that the parties have\n\nchosen Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration. However, by\n\nreading further clauses of the arbitration agreement, it was\n\nobserved that reference to Hong Kong as \"place of\n\narbitration\" is not a simple reference as the \"venue\" for the\n\narbitral proceedings; but a reference to Hong Kong is for\n\nfinal resolution by arbitration administered in Hong Kong.\n\nThe agreement between the parties that the dispute \"shall be\n\nreferred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in\n\nHong Kong\" clearly suggests that the parties have agreed\n\nthat the arbitration be seated at Hong Kong and that laws of\n\nHong Kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well\n\nas have power of judicial review over the arbitration award.\n\nHowever, in the context of domestic arbitration, the\n\nobservations of the Apex Court in\nIndus Mobile\n\nDistribution (P) Ltd. versus Datawind Innovations (P)\n\nLtd.\n(supra), (in paragraph 19) were noted therein as\n\nunder: -\n\nPage 35 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\n\"24. In the context of domestic arbitration, holding\nthat once the \"Seat\" is determined, only that\njurisdictional court would have exclusive\njurisdiction, in Indus Mobile Distribution (P) Ltd. v.\n\nDatawind Innovations (P) Ltd. and others, (2017) 7\nSCC 678, it was held as under:-\n\n\"19. A conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions\nshows that the moment the seat is designated, it\nis akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. On\nthe facts of the present case, it is clear that the\nseat of arbitration is Mumbai and Clause 19\nfurther makes it clear that jurisdiction\nexclusively vests in the Mumbai courts. Under\nthe Law of Arbitration, unlike\nthe Code of Civil\nProcedure\nwhich applies to suits filed in courts,\na reference to \"seat\" is a concept by which a\nneutral venue can be chosen by the parties to\nan arbitration clause. The neutral venue may\nnot in the classical sense have jurisdiction - that\nis, no part of the cause of action may have\narisen at the neutral venue and neither would\nany of the provisions of\nSections 16\nto\nof\nCPC be attracted. In arbitration law however, as\nhas been held above, the moment \"seat\" is\ndetermined, the fact that the seat is at Mumbai\nwould vest Mumbai courts with exclusive\njurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral\nproceedings arising out of the agreement\nbetween the parties.\"\n\n30. From the reading of the above noted decisions, it can\n\nbe seen that mere designation of a place of arbitration in\n\narbitration clause as being \"venue of the arbitration\n\nproceedings\", would not be determinative factor to decide\n\nthe \"seat of the arbitral proceedings\". The language of the\n\narbitral agreement has to be read on case by case basis to\n\nPage 36 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\ndetermine as to whether \"venue\" so stated is \"seat\" of\n\narbitral proceedings, or it is only convenient place of\n\nmeeting. The moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an\n\nexclusive jurisdiction clause for the purpose of regulating\n\narbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between\n\nthe parties.\n\n31. Taking note of the above, this Court is further\n\nrequired to go through the recent decision of the Apex Court\n\nin the case of M/s.\nRavi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd.\n\nversus Aditya Kumar Chatterjee\npassed in Civil Appeal\n\narising out of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s).\n\n17397-17398/2021 decided on 24.03.2022. The question\n\nbefore the Apex Court in\nthe said decision\nwas with respect\n\nto the maintainability of the application under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, 1996, for appointment of Arbitrator. The\n\nchallenge was to the order of the Calcutta High Court in\n\nrejecting the review application seeking for recall of the\n\norder of appointment of Arbitrator. In the context of the\n\narbitration clause therein, which stated that \"seat of the\n\narbitral tribunal shall be at Calcutta\", the dispute with\n\nPage 37 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nregard to the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High\n\nCourt examined. It was contended that the development\n\nagreement (in question therein) is in respect of the property\n\nsituated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar outside the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Calcutta High Court. The development agreement was\n\nexecuted and registered in the State of Bihar, outside the\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. The appellant\n\ntherein had its registered office at Patna, outside the\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, and has no\n\nestablishment or does not carry on any business within the\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. It was, thus, argued\n\nby the learned counsel for the appellant therein that no part\n\nof the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of\n\nCalcutta High Court.\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act, 1996 defines\n\nthe Court, in case of arbitration other than international\n\ncommercial arbitration, to mean Principal Civil Court of\n\nOriginal jurisdiction in a district and would include the High\n\nCourt in exercise of its ordinary original jurisdiction, having\n\njurisdiction to decide the question forming the subject matter\n\nof arbitration, if the same had been the subject matter of the\n\nPage 38 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nsuit. The contention, thus, was that subject to the pecuniary\n\nor other limitations prescribed by law, suits for recovery of\n\nimmovable property or determination of any other right to or\n\ninterest in any movable property or compensation for wrong\n\nto immovable property, is to be instituted in the Court, within\n\nthe local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated.\n\nCertain specific suits relating to immovable property can be\n\ninstituted either in the Court within the limits of whose\n\njurisdiction the property is situated, or in the Court within\n\nthe local limits of whose jurisdiction the Defendant actually\n\nor voluntarily resides or carries on business. All other suits\n\nare to be instituted in a Court, within the local limits of\n\nwhose jurisdiction the Defendant voluntarily resides or\n\ncarries on business. A suit may also be instituted in the Court\n\nwithin whose jurisdiction, the cause of action arises either\n\nwholly or in part. In the said case, no suit could have been\n\nfiled in any court over which the Calcutta High Court\n\nexercises jurisdiction, since the suit pertaining to immovable\n\nproperty situated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar, would be outside\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court.

It was, thus, argued\n\nthat an application for appointment of Arbitration under\n\nSection 11(6), necessarily has to be moved in the High Court,\n\nirrespective of whether the High Court has supervisory\n\njurisdiction to decide the suit in respect of the subject matter\n\nof arbitration situated and irrespective of whether the High\n\nCourt at all has Original jurisdiction to entertain and decide\n\nsuits. Dealing with this contention therein, it was observed\n\nin paragraph Nos. 26, 27 and 28 as under : -\n\n\"26. Of course, under Section 11(6), an application for\nappointment of an Arbitrator necessarily has to be moved\nin the High Court, irrespective of whether the High Court\nhas the jurisdiction to decide a suit in respect of the\nsubject matter of arbitration and irrespective of whether\nthe High Court at all has original jurisdiction to entertain\nand decide suits. As such, the definition of Court in\nSection\n2(1)(e)\nof the A&C Act would not be applicable in the case\nof a High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6)\nof the A&C Act to appoint an Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n27. At the same time, an application under Section 11(6)\nof the A&C Act for appointment of an Arbitrator/Arbitral\nTribunal cannot be moved in any High Court in India,\n\nPage 40 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nirrespective of its territorial jurisdiction. Section 11(6) of\nthe A&C Act has to be harmoniously read with\nSection 2(1)\n\n(e) of the A&C Act and construed to mean, a High Court\nwhich exercises superintendence/supervisory jurisdiction\nover a Court within the meaning of\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the\nA&C Act.\n\n28. It could never have been the intention of Section 11(6)\nof the A&C Act that arbitration proceedings should be\ninitiated in any High Court in India, irrespective of\nwhether the Respondent resided or carried on business\nwithin the jurisdiction of that High Court, and irrespective\nof whether any part of the cause of action arose within the\njurisdiction of that Court, to put an opponent at a\ndisadvantage and steal a march over the opponent.\"\n\n32. The judgment of the Apex Court in\nBGS SGS Soma\n\nJV versus NPHC Ltd.\n(supra), relied on by the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent therein was noted to record that\n\nthe said judgment\nwas rendered in the context of\nSection\n\n2(2)\nof the Act, 1996 and the applicability of Part I of the said\n\nAct to an international commercial arbitration, where the\n\nseat of arbitration was not in India.\n\nAnother decision of\n\nHindustan Construction Company Limited versus\n\nNHPC Limited and Anr.\nreported in (2020) 4 SCC 310,\n\nwas also noted therein to record in paragraph 40 as under : -\n\n\"40.\nIn\nHindustan Construction Company Limited\n\n(supra), this Court held that once the seat of\narbitration is designated, the same operates as an\nexclusive jurisdiction clause and only Courts within\nwhose jurisdiction the seat was located, would have\n\nPage 41 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\njurisdiction to the exclusion of all other Courts. In the\nfacts and circumstances of that case this Court found\nthat Courts at New Delhi alone would have jurisdiction\nfor the purpose of challenge to the Award.\"\n\n33. The decision of the Apex Court in the case of\n\nMankastu Impex Private Limited versus Airvisual\n\nLimited\n(supra), was also noted by the Apex Court therein\n\nto record that : -\n\n\"46. In this case, the Development Agreement provided\nthat the sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal would be\nconducted in Kolkata. As observed above, the parties\nnever agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Calcutta\nHigh Court in respect of disputes, nor did the parties 12\nagree upon Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. Kolkata\nwas only the venue for sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n47. It is well settled that, when two or more Courts have\njurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising out of an\narbitration agreement, the parties might, by agreement,\ndecide to refer all disputes to any one Court to the\nexclusion of all other Courts, which might otherwise\nhave had jurisdiction to decide the disputes. The parties\ncannot, however, by consent, confer jurisdiction on a\nCourt which inherently lacked jurisdiction, as argued by\nMr. Sinha.\n\n48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not\nagree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the\nCourts in Kolkata. It was not the intention of the parties\nthat Kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata\nwas only intended to be the venue for arbitration\nsittings. Accordingly, the Respondent himself\napproached the District Court at Muzaffarpur, and not a\nCourt in Kolkata for interim protection under Section 9\nof the A&C Act. The Respondent having himself invoked\nthe jurisdiction of the District Court at Muzaffarpur, is\nestopped from contending that the parties had agreed to\n\nPage 42 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nconfer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta High Court\nto the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the parties to\nthe agreement construed the arbitration clause to\ndesignate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are\nconstrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently\nlacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the\nRespondent under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act.\nThe High Court should have decided the objection raised\nby the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High\nCourt, to entertain the application under Section 11(6) of\nA&C Act, before appointing an Arbitrator.\"\n\n34. The appeal was ultimately allowed and the order of\n\nappointment of Arbitrator and dismissal of the review\n\napplication was set aside on the ground that the order of\n\nappointment of Arbitrator was without jurisdiction. It was\n\nheld that the parties did not agree to submit to the\n\njurisdiction of Calcutta High Court and they had only agreed\n\nthat the sitting of the Arbitral Tribunal would be in Kolkata.\n\n35. Further, this Court may note some other decisions of\n\nother High Courts relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel\n\nfor the petitioner.\n\nThe Calcutta High Court in\nHomevista Decor and\n\nFurnishing Pvt.

I find myself in consonance with the above\nview. In circumstances where a place is designated\nmerely as a 'venue' and courts of another place\nhave been granted the exclusive jurisdiction, the\nlatter is a clear 'contrary indicia'. It can be inferred\nfrom a comprehensive reading of such clauses, that\nthe 'venue' is a convenient place of arbitration and\nnot the seat.\n\n20. The Calcutta High Court's judgment in\nHeight\nInsurance Services Limited\n(supra) has been stayed\nby the same judge who passed the judgment and is\ntherefore not required to be dealt by me.\"\n\n36. Similarly, the view has been taken by the Delhi High\n\nCourt in the case of\nKush Raj Bhatia versus DLF Power\n\nand Services Limited\nthrough its Director (supra), in\n\nparagraph Nos. 28, 29, 30 and 31 as under : -\n\n\"28. Having discussed the distinct concepts of \"Seat\"\n\nand \"Venue‟, it may be examined how these two\nconcepts have been interpreted and applied in various\nsituations.

The parties have agreed for venue of\narbitration to be New Delhi, but in the other Clause, they\nhad agreed that all actions and proceedings arising out\nof/related to the Contract shall lie in the Courts of\ncompetent jurisdiction at Guwahati.\nThe Court held that\nsince the Clauses of the Agreement expressly provided\nthat the Courts at Guwahati would have exclusive\njurisdiction, it was a contrary indicator coming within\nthe exception as held by the Supreme Court in the case\nof DSG SGS Souma (supra).\n\n29. Similarly, in\nCravants Media Pvt. Ltd. vs. Jharkhand\nState Cooperative Milk Food Federation Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.\nArbitration\npetition No. 915/2021 decided on 06.12.2021\nby the Coordinate Bench, the Dispute Resolution Clause\nprovided that the venue of arbitration shall be Ranchi,\nbut any disputes arising out of this agreement shall be\nsubject to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of Courts in\nDelhi. It was held that the intention of the parties was\nclear that the seat would be in New Delhi and the Court\nat New Delhi was held to have the jurisdiction.\n\n30. In the facts in hand, the relevant Clause 48 and\nClause 49 read as under:\n\n48. All or any dispute arising out of touching upon\nor in relation to the terms of the Lease Deed\nincluding the interpretation and validity of the\nterms thereof and the respective rights and\nobligations of the parties shall be settled amicably\nby mutual discussion failing which the same shall\nbe settled through arbitration.

That the Civil Courts at Gurgaon and High\nCourt at Chandigarh alone shall have\njurisdiction.\"\n\n31. It is quite evident that there is a contraindication in\nthe registered Agreement that while the venue of\narbitration may be New Delhi, but the seat of arbitration\nshall be Gurgaon and High Court at Chandigarh. In the\ncircumstances, it has to be held that this Court has no\njurisdiction and it is the Courts at Gurgaon/High Court of\nChandigarh which have the exclusive jurisdiction for\nentertaining the disputes arising out of the registered\nLease Agreement.\"\n\n37. The view taken by the High Court of Delhi in\nIGSEC\n\nHeavy Engineering Ltd. versus Indian Oil Corporation\n\nLtd.\n(supra) in paragraph Nos. 8, 12, 13, 14, 15 is also\n\nrelevant to be noted as hereinunder : -\n\n\"8. There can be no doubt on the proposition that\nthe word 'seat' and 'venue' have different\nconnotations. They are not synonymous, in so far as\nthe arbitration proceedings are concerned, although,\nthey have often been used interchangeably. The law\non 'seat' and 'venue' of arbitration proceedings is\nfairly well-defined in view of several judgments of\nthe Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has clearly\nheld that where the parties have determined the\n'seat' in their agreement, the same is akin to\nconferring exclusive jurisdiction on the court(s)\n\nPage 46 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nthereof.5 The expression 'venue' and 'seat' do not\nfind any mention under the Act. The expression used\nunder the Act is 'place', which finds mention under\n\nSection 20\nof the Act. In BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium\nTechnical Services Inc., 6 the Apex Court made it\nclear that sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 20,\nwhere the word 'place' is used, refer to juridical\n'seat'; whereas, in sub-section (3) of Section 20, the\nword 'place' is equivalent to 'venue', i.e., the location\nof the meeting of arbitral proceedings.\n\n12. To answer the afore-mentioned question - What\nconstitutes the 'seat' of arbitral proceedings - the\nintention of the parties is germane and that can be\ngathered from the terms of the Contract. Let's have\na closer look at the clause. The clause provides a\ngeneral stipulation that the 'venue' so designated\ncan be changed by the Arbitrators, with the consent\nof the parties. This, prima facie, suggests that the\n'venue' specified is not really envisaged as the 'seat'\nof the proceedings, which should be specified in\ncertain terms. This interpretation is also in sync with\n\nSection 20(3)\nof the Act, which provides that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in Section 20(1)\nand (2) - the Arbitral Tribunal can meet at any place\nit considers appropriate for hearing witnesses,\nexperts, etc. In fact, the language used in the\npresent clause seems to be a replication of the\nlanguage used in Section 20(3). For this reason, as\nwell, the Court is inclined to agree that in the\npresent case, Clause 9.1.2.0 of the GCC specifies\nNew Delhi only as a geographically convenient place\nwhere Arbitral Tribunal can hold meetings.\n\n13. The above position gets reinforced upon a plain\nreading of\nArticle 4\nof the Contract. This clause vests\nexclusive jurisdiction at the civil court(s) at\nGuwahati for - all actions/proceedings, including\narbitration, and reads as under: -\n\n\"\nARTICLE 4 -\nJURISDICTION:\n\n4.1 Notwithstanding any other court or courts\nhaving jurisdiction to decide the question(s)\n\nPage 47 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\nforming the subject-matter of the reference if the\nsame had been the subject-matter of a suit, any\nand all actions and proceedings arising out of or\nrelative to the contract (including any arbitration\nin terms thereof) shall lie only in the Court of\nCompetent Civil Jurisdiction in this behalf at\nGUWAHATI (where this contract has been signed\non behalf of the Owner) and the said Court(s) shall\nhave jurisdiction to entertain and try such actions\nand/or proceeding(s) to the exclusion of all other\nCourts.\" [Emphasis supplied]\n\n14. As opposed to the general stipulation in Clause\n9.1.2.0,\nArticle 4\nis worded in clear, unambiguous,\nand directory terms. In fact, it serves as the\n'contrary indica', which further demonstrates that\nthe 'venue' in Clause 9.1.2.0 is only a physical place\nof meeting under\nSection 20(3)\nof the Act.\nArticle 4\n\n-leaves no room that all actions and proceedings\narising out of the Contract, including arbitration,\nshall have to necessarily be tried by the civil court(s)\nat Guwahati exclusively, and does not lead to\njurisdiction being vested in the court(s) at Delhi.\n\n15. For the reasons laid out above, this Court is of\nthe view that Clause 9.1.2.0 only provides a 'venue'\nof arbitration, and the juridical 'seat' shall vest with\nthe civil court(s) at Guwahati.\"\n\n38. The observations in\nCravants Media Private\n\nLimited versus Jharkhand State Co. Operative Milk\n\nProducers Federation Ltd. and Another\n(supra) in\n\nparagraph No. 11 is as under : -\n\n\"11. The question whether the intention of the\nparties in specifying a location for arbitral\nproceedings is merely to fix a convenient 'venue' or\n\nPage 48 of 54\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Oct 13 20:52:55 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/ARBI.P/159/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023\n\nundefined\n\na seat/place of arbitration has to be ascertained\nfrom the language of the arbitration agreement.\"\n\n39. In light of the above discussion, this Court may\n\nrecord that law on \"seat\" and \"venue\" of arbitration\n\nproceedings is fairly well settled. The cases, where the\n\nparties have determined \"seat\" in their agreements, the\n\nsame is akin to conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the\n\nCourt(s) thereof. The expression 'place' occurring in Sub-\n\nsection (1) and (2) of the Section 20, where the word 'place'\n\nis used, refers to \"juridical seat\"; whereas, expression\n\n\"place\" occurring in sub-section (3) of Section 20, is\n\nequivalent to 'venue', i.e., the location of the meeting of\n\narbitral proceedings, as per the convenience of the parties or\n\nthe arbitrators. The \"place\" mentioned in\nSection 20(3)\nof\n\nthe Act, 1996 is only a physical place of meeting and has no\n\nrelevance insofar as \"juridical seat\", which shall vests\n\nexclusive jurisdiction with the Court of competent civil\n\njurisdiction or High Court of original jurisdiction;\n\n(i) As has been held by the Apex Court in the case of M/s.\n\nRavi Ranjan Developers Pvt.

Coming to the facts of the instant case, Clause 25(iii)\n\nof the Lease Agreement exclusively confers jurisdiction to\n\nthe Courts at Ahmedabad in all matters arising out of the\n\nsaid agreement.
