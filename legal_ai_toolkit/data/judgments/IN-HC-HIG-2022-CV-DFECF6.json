With the consent of the learned advocates appearing\n\nfor the respective parties, the petitions were taken up\n\nfor its final disposal on 5.1.2022.\n\n3. In all these petitions, under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, the petitioners who were\n\nerstwhile employees of the State Government and\n\nultimately on retirement there-from were absorbed\n\nwith the Food and Civil Supplies Department, a Public\n\nSector undertaking, initially, prayed for a relief of\n\ngranting the benefit of medical allowance in their\n\nmonthly pension as well as family pension to the\n\nheirs. When the petitions have come up for hearing,\n\nthe learned counsels for the respective parties have\n\nmade a statement that as far as their grievance of\n\nfamily pension is concerned, the same has been\n\nresolved, inasmuch as, family pension is now being\n\npaid to them by virtue of the GR dated 10.7.2019. The\n\nonly controversy therefore that remains is that of\n\ngranting of the benefit of the medical allowance in\n\nPage 2 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\ntheir monthly pension.\n\n4. For the purposes of this judgment, facts of Special\n\nCivil Application No.3180 of 2019 are seen.\n\n4.1. The petitioners are senior citizens and they\n\nhave approached this Court inasmuch as, it is their\n\ncase that the State is not implementing the verdict\n\ngiven by this Court in cases of similarly situated\n\npensioners who are co-employees of the present\n\nemployers in respect of grant of medical allowance\n\nin their monthly pensions. The petitioners had joined\n\nthe Food and Civil Supplies department on different\n\ndates and, thereafter upon creation of the Gujarat\n\nState Civil Supplies Corporation on 2.10.1980, the\n\npetitioners are the employees of Civil Services\n\nDepartment and were sent on deputation to the\n\nCorporation. In the year 1986, the State Government\n\ndecided to absorb the employees sent on deputation\n\nto the Corporation and other employees like the\n\npetitioners were permanently absorbed. All those\n\nemployees had been treated to have retired from\n\nPage 3 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\ngovernment service with effect from 4.12.1998 and\n\nwere sanctioned pension from the State\n\nGovernment. Their pension is also commuted.\n\nThereafter, 1/3rd of commuted pension was restored\n\non completion of fifteen years and such pension\n\npayment orders are placed on record. The\n\npetitioners are also granted 50% of DA merger.\n\n5. Ms. Harshal Pandya, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners would submit that the petitioners are not\n\nbeing paid medical allowance which other pensioners\n\nare being receiving as monthly pension. A\n\nrepresentation was made, which, however has\n\nremained unanswered. Ms. Pandya for the petitioners\n\nwould place reliance on the decision of this Court\n\nrendered in SCA No.12918 / 2010 with SCA No.12929\n\n/ 2010 dated 5.4.2019, wherein, an identical issue of\n\nthe retired employees of the Gujarat State Civil\n\nSupplies Corporation in context of prayer to direct\n\nthem to pay medical allowance with the pension was\n\nconsidered. She would submit that following the\n\nearlier decision rendered in SCA No.16209 of 2013\n\nPage 4 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nthe Court allowed the petition with a direction to see\n\nthat the medical allowance is sanctioned to the\n\npetitioners and paid alongwith family pension. She\n\nwould therefore submit that the petitioners being\n\nsimilarly situated are entitled to the benefits of\n\nmedical allowance as it forms part of components of\n\npension as decided by this Court. The aforesaid\n\ndecision was even confirmed in appeal as the LPA\n\nagainst the said judgments have not been\n\nentertained.\n\n6. Learned AGP Mr. Thakkar appearing for the\n\nrespondent - State would draw the attention of the\n\nCourt to the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent-\n\nState and submit that the case of the petitioners does\n\nnot fall within the parameters of Rule 9(55) of the\n\nGujarat Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2002 and,\n\ntherefore, the petitioners are not entitled to seek the\n\nbenefits of medical allowance as a part of their\n\npension. Reliance is also placed on Rule 51(2)(c) of\n\nthe Rules which provides for retirement benefits and\n\nthe submission is made that the medical allowance\n\nPage 5 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nand medical reimbursement would not form part of\n\nthe retirement benefits and, therefore, the petitioners\n\naccordingly are not entitled to the benefits of medical\n\nallowance. The pension defined in Rule 9(55) is\n\nreferred to for the purposes of this submission.\n\n6.1. Reading the affidavit-in-reply, learned AGP\n\nwould further submit that the petition is barred by\n\ndelay and latches inasmuch as the petitioners have\n\nbeen fence-sitters. They have not approached this\n\nCourt within time and they have slept over their\n\nrights and chosen not to come to this Court. Fence-\n\nsitters cannot be given the benefit of identical order\n\nof the Court, merely, because such an order is\n\npassed in the case of other co-employees. Reliance is\n\nplaced on the decision in the case of\nState of Uttar\n\nPradesh v. Arvind Kumar Shrivastava\nreported\n\nin 2015(1) SCC 237. The relevant paragraphs of\n\nthat judgment are read before this Court to submit\n\nthat fence-sitters who have acquiescence cannot be\n\ngiven the benefit of a subsequent decision of the\n\nCourt.\n\nPage 6 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n7. Ms. Pandya on the other hand would rely on the\n\nfollowing decisions:\n\n(1) Vipulkumar Atmaram Parekh v. State\nof Gujarat reported in 2009(5) GLR 3914 -\n\nPara 9 and 10\n\n(2) Union of India v. Tarsem Singh\n\n2008(8) SCC 648 - Para 4 to 8\n\n(3) Lajja Ram & Others v. Union Territory\nreported in 2013(\n11) SCC 235 - Para 9 and\n11 &\n\n(4) Union of India v. Krishna Rao\nreported\nin 2018(18) SCC 107 - Para 12\n\n8. Considering the above submissions made by the\n\nlearned advocates for the respective parties, the issue\n\nneed not detain us for long.\n\n9. In an extensive consideration made by this Court in\n\nSCA No.16209 of 2013, a judgment which was\n\nrendered by this Court on 20.10.2015 which was\n\nsubsequently followed in the decision dated 5.4.2016\n\nin SCA No.12918 of 2010, the Court extensively\n\nconsidered the provisions in context of the prayer of\n\npayment of medical allowance to the petitioners who\n\nwere employees of the Industrial Research\n\nPage 7 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nLaboratory and the Court has in the decision dated\n\n5.4.2016 rendered in SCA No.12918 of 2010 in the\n\ncontext of the State Civil Supply Corporation, which\n\nwere the co-employees of the petitioners, held as\n\nunder extensively reproducing the decision. The\n\nCourt observed in para Nos.7 and 8 as under:\n\n\"7. In my view, this issue is no longer\nres-integra, after the pronouncement of the\njudgment and order of this Court dated\n30th October, 2015 passed in the Special Civil\nApplication No.16209 of 2013. The order reads\nthus:\n\n\"1 By this writ application under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution of India, the petitioners\nretired Government employees, have\nprayed for the following reliefs:\n\n7. The petitioners respectfully pray that, on the\nbasis of the facts and circumstances as\nmentioned hereinabove and which may be\nurged at the time of hearing, the Honourable\nCourt may be pleased to issue a writ of\nmandamus or any other appropriate writ, order\nor direction to the respondent authorities and\nmay be pleased to:\n\n(A) declare and hold that the petitioners are\nentitled and eligible for the benefit of medical\nallowance in monthly pension and the family\npension, and\n\n(B) direct the respondent authorities to\nextend the benefit of medical allowance\nin their monthly pension and the benefit\nof family pension to the petitioners, and\n\nPage 8 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n(C) award the cost of present petition, and\n\n(D) pension admissible and final disposal\nof this petition, this Honourable Court may\nbe pleased to direct the GIRDA, Res. No.4 to\nsent the proposal to the State Government in\nrespect of grant of benefit of medical allowance\nand family pension to the petitioners so as to\nenable the authorities of the State Government\nto consider the same, and\n\n(E) pending admissible and final disposal\nof this petition, this Honourable Court\nmay be pleased to direct the respondent\nauthorities to start paying medical allowance to\nthe petitioners in their monthly pension as\nbeing paid to other pensioners, and/or\n\n(F) grant any other relief or pass any\nother order which the Honourable Court\nmay consider as just and proper in the facts\nand circumstances of the case.\n\n2 The case of the petitioners may be\nsummarized as under;\n\n2.1 The petitioners joined the services of the\nState Government and were posted in the\nIndustrial Research Laboratory (I.R.L., for\nshort) under the Administrative Control of\nthe Commissioner of Industries. All the\npetitioners were holding the technical post.\n\n2.2 On 06.04.1981, the Gujarat Industrial\nResearch and Development Agency (GIRDA,\nfor short) was established.\n\n2.3 On 30.06.1982, the State\nGovernment accorded approval to the GIRDA\nto take over the Industrial Research Laboratory\nwith effect from 01.04.1982, and accordingly,\n\nPage 9 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nthe same was taken over by the GIRDA. All the\nemployees working in the I.R.L. were sent on\ndeputation in the GIRDA. In the year 1982, the\nquestion of permanent absorption of the\nemployees working in the I.R.L. cropped up in\nview of the merger of the I.R.L. with the\nGIRDA, In such circumstances, the State\nGovernment decided to call for an option from\nthe employees of the I.R.L. whether they\ndesired to be absorbed permanently in the\nGIRDA or not. While calling for such option, it\nwas made clear to the employees working on\nthe technical side that as everything was being\ntaken over by the GIRDA, no technical post\nwould continue, and therefore, upon giving\noption for being continued in the parent\ndepartment, their services would be\nterminated.\n\n2.4 In such circumstances\nreferred to above\n,\nthe petitioners were left with no other option,\nexcept being absorbed in the GIRDA, and\naccordingly, they were absorbed with effect\nfrom 01.10.1985 on permanent basis.\n\n2.5 After being absorbed in the GIRDA, all the\npetitioners were treated to have retired from\nthe services of the Government. The\npension was sanctioned in favour of the\npetitioners with effect from 01.10.1985 for that\nperiod and were permitted to commute full\npension. In the year 19981999, the State\nGovernment decided to grant the benefit of the\ncommuted portion of pension to all the\nGovernment employees who had been\nabsorbed in the Public Sector Undertaking /\nAutonomous Body. Since the authority delayed\nthe process, the petitioners Nos.1 and 2 herein\nfiled two Special Civil Applications\nNos.12436 and 12437 of 2009 respectively.\n\nBoth the writ applications were disposed of in\n\nPage 10 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nthe following terms:\n\n1. During the course of hearing, Mr.J.K.\nShah, learned Assistant Government Pleader,\nhas tendered the affidavit filed by Mr.Ramsing\nR. Parmar, whereby it is categorically stated\nthat his office has received the letter from the\noffice of the Pension and Provident Fund,\nGandinagar, and the same is under\nconsideration by his office. In pursuance of\nthe same, learned Assistant Government\nPleader has submitted that the grievance of the\npetitioners will be redressed by the respondent-\n\nauthority within the stipulated time.\n\n2. Mr.Paresh Upadhyay, learned advocate for\nthe petitioners, states that in view of the\naverments made in the said affidavit as well as\nthe statement made by the learned Assistant\nGovernment Pleader, he does not press both\nthe petitions.\n\n3. In view of aforesaid, both the petitions stand\ndisposed of as not pressed.

In the year\n201011, the sanction letters of restoration of\npension\nwere issued in favour of the petitioners with\nrevision pertaining to the 6th Pay Commission.\nSince the authorities did not sanction the\npension, after merging 50% D.A. in view\nof the policy of the State Government\nof granting the benefit of merger of D.A.\n\nPage 11 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nin pension with effect from 01.04.2004,\nseveral representations were made in\nthat regard. On 11.05.2011, the Finance\nDepartment clarified that since all the benefits\nwere granted to the absorbed employees at par\nwith the other pensioners, the benefit of\nmerger of 50% D.A. would be also\npayable to such employees.\n\n2.7 On 28.07.2011, the District Treasury Office\nwas instructed to pay pension after merging\n50% D.A.\n\n2.8 It is the case of the petitioners that in the\npension, which is being paid to them, the\nmedical allowance is not being paid. The other\npensioners are being paid the medical\nallowance. The two widows of the Government\nemployees also preferred representations for\ngrant of the family pension upon death of their\nrespective husbands who were absorbed and\ntreated as retired from the Government\nservices along with the present petitioners.\nHowever, the request was declined. On\n09.05.2012, the District Treasury Office,\nVadodara replied that as there was no clear\ndirection for payment of medical allowance, the\nsame was not being paid. On the issue of family\npension and medical allowance, the\nGIRDA informed the State Government that\nsuch benefits are not being paid to the\nemployees of the GIRDA and appropriate\ninstructions were sought in that regard by the\nGIRDA from the Government. The grievance of\nthe petitioners is that they have all retired\nand although are entitled for the benefit\nof medical allowance in their monthly pension,\nyet the same has been wrongly denied without\nthere being any legal basis for the same.\n\n3 Ms. Harshal Pandya, the learned advocate\nappearing for the petitioners submitted that\n\nPage 12 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nalthough the Commissioner of Industries\nhas issued appropriate directions as regards\nthe payment of medical allowance, the\nauthorities of GIRDA for some reasons or the\nother are not forwarding the proposal for the\ngrant of medical allowance and family pension.\n\n4 Ms. Pandya submitted that it is not proper on\nthe part of the State Government to harass\nhelpless widows. According to Ms.\nPandya, the benefit of family pension is\navailable to a widow / widower of a pensioner\nunder the statutory rules of the Gujarat Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules, but the same has\nbeen denied despite the fact that the\nemployees absorbed in other Boards /\nCorporations are being paid the same.\n\n5 Ms. Pandya submitted that her clients are all\nretired employees of the State Government and\nare claiming pension for the service rendered\nwith the State Government. For the service\nrendered with the GIRDA, benefits have\nalready been paid which do not include\npension.

Pensioner\nmeans a retired Government employee who\nhas been granted pension\n\n10.1 Rule 51 of the Gujarat Civil Service\n(Pension) Rules, 2002 provides benefit of family\npension to the families of absorbed employees,\nwhich reads as under:\n\nRule 51: Pension on absorption in or\nunder Public Sector undertaking:\n\n(2)(b)(i) The benefit of family pension under\nChapterX of these rules shall be admissible\nonly to the families of those who are actually\nin receipt of pension from the State\nGovernment, after their absorption in the\nPublic Sector undertaking referred to in this\nrule. This benefit shall not be admissible to the\nfamilies of those who got only the service\ngratuity.\n\n(ii) Family Pension shall not be admissible from\nonly one source either from the State\nGovernment or the public sector undertaking\nreferred to in this rule in case such public\nsector undertaking has a similar scheme for\npayment of family pension. The beneficiary\nshall be given option to choose either of the\ntwo scheme.\n\n(iii) Grant of family pension shall be subject to\nother conditions specified in Chapter X of these\n\nPage 20 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nrules.\n\n(iv) It shall be responsibility of pension\nsanctioning authority to process the claim of\nfamily pension. He shall forward the claim of\nfamily pension after verifying that there exists\nno scheme for grant of family pension to the\nfamilies of the Government employees\nalready absorbed in the public sector\nundertaking.\n\n11 It appears from the stance of the GIRDA\nthat the grant of benefit of restoration of\npension, merger of D.A. and three increments,\ndisentitle the pensioners to claim the family\npension and medical allowance, as they cannot\nbe treated as employees of the State\nGovernment. It also appears that the GIRDA\nproposes to rely upon a Government\nResolution dated 19.02.1974, by which, the\nState Government had declined to take the\nresponsibility of paying the family pension.\n\n12 However, it appears that the State\nGovernment, thereafter, issued another\nresolution dated 01.04.1989 modifying the\nearlier resolution/policy for bringing\nuniformity in the mater of pensionery\nbenefits. The relevant part of the resolution\ndated 01.04.1989 reads thus:\n\nAt present the cases of Government employees,\non deputation to Public Sector Undertaking\nof the State Government, who are\nabsorbed in the PSUs in public interest\npermanently, are regulated as per the\nprovisions contained in the G.Rs. F. D. referred\nto in the preamble. The question of\nestablishing parity in the matter of,\npensionary benefit to such State Government\nemployees, with the provisions in force in\n\nPage 21 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nGovernment of India had been under\nconsideration of Government. After careful\nconsideration, Government has decided\nthat in partial modification to the\nprovisions contained in the GRs referred to in\nthe preamble, the cases of the Government\nemployees who select to be absorbed in the\nAutonomous body/Public Sector Undertaking\nwill be regulated as under:\n\n(1) A Government employee on\nabsorption to Public Sector\n\nUndertaking/Autonomous body is eligible for\nprorata pension and DCRG based on the length\nof his qualifying services till the date of his\nabsorption in the PSU/Autonomous Body. The\npension will be calculated on the average\nemoluments for 3 years preceding the date of\nabsorption and DCRG will be calculated on the\nbasis of the emoluments immediately before\nabsorption.\n\n(2) Within 6 months of absorption, every\nsuch of Government employees, absorbed\nin PSUs/Autonomous bodies will exercise\noption for either of the two alternatives\nindicated below:\n\n(a) Receiving monthly pension and DCRG as\nper the rules or\n\n(b) Receiving DCTG and a lumpsum amount in\nlieu of pension worked out with reference to\nthe commutation table. Were no option is\nexercised, the absorbed employee will\nautomatically be governed under the option (b)\nabove. The option once exercised will be\nfinal. The person who chooses the alternative\nmentioned in Para1 and 2(b) above, 1/3 of the\nlumpsum amount will be treated as\ncommutation of pension and 2/3 of the\namount will be treated as retirement\n\nPage 22 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nbenefits.\n\n(3) In case the Government employee,\nabsorbed in PSU/Autonomous Bodies,\nresigns after receiving pensionery benefits,\nthe resignation will be treated as\nresignation from Government service and\nas a consequence of resignation, pensionary\nbenefits received under these orders will be\nforfeited.\n\n(4) The absorbed Government employee will\nreceive all the benefits admissible to other\ncorresponding employees of PSUs/Autonomous\nbodies. But in respect of gratuity the sum total\nof the gratuity received from Government at\nthe time of absorption and the gratuity\nreceived from the PSU/Autonomous body\nfor service rendered there should not exceed\nthe amount of gratuity that would have been\nreceived had he been continued in Government\nservice and retired on the same pay which be\ndrew on retirement from PSUs/Autonomous\nbodies.\n\n(5) Any further liberalisation of pension\nrule after permanent absorption will not be\nextended. However, if such liberalisation\ncomes into effect retrospectively i.e., with\neffect from the date prior to the date of\nabsorption, the benefit will be admissible.\n\n(6) In the case where the absorbed\nemployee elects to receive recurring pension\nand DCRG in terms of 1(2)(a) above, and\nwishes to commute some portion of his pension\nas per the rules, the same will be admissible.\n\n(7) These benefits will be admissible only if the\nabsorption is in public interest.\n\n(8) A permanent Government employee who\n\nPage 23 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nhas been appointed in an Autonomous Body/\nPSU wholly on substantially financed by\nGovernment, on his own application in\nresponse to a press advertisement etc.,\non his permanent absorption in such\norganisation will be entitled to get benefits of\nthese orders except carry forward of leave.\n\n(9) All the cases to be regulated under this\norder will have to be decided by the\nconcerned Administrative Departments in\nSachivalaya, who in turn will have to seek\napproval of Finance Department.\n\n(10) The pay of the Government\nemployee absorbed in PSUs/Autonomous\n\nbodies will be regulated as per the provisions of\nthe G.R.F.D. No.NVT3286GOI95P dated 178-\n\n1988 as amended from time time.\n\n(11) (i) The benefit of family pension will be\nadmissible to those who are in receipt of\npension after absorption in PSUs.\n\n(ii) The benefit is not admissible to those who\nhave not rendered requisite number of\nqualifying service to earn them pension.\nAccordingly the benefit of family, pension will\nnot be admissible to the families of those\nGovernment servants absorbed in PSUs, who\nhave not completed 10 years qualifying service.\n\n(iii) The family pension will also be\nadmissible to those Government servants\nabsorbed in PSUs who die before receiving\npensionery benefits admissible under these\norders subject to the fulfillment of conditions\nmentioned in para 1(11)(ii) above.\n\n(iv) The family pension will This benefit will be\nadmissible to the Government servant who\nis appointed to PSUs in the manner\n\nPage 24 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nindicated in para 1(8) above and has been\ngranted retirement benefits under these\norders.\n\n(v) The family pension to the eligible\nmembers of the PSU absorbed, Government\nservants will be given from one source only,\ni.e., either from the Government or from\nthe Public Sector Undertakings/ Autonomous\nbodies if such organization has any scheme for\ngrant of family pension. The eligible member\nmay be allowed to choose either of the two\nscheme.\n\n(vi) It will be responsibility of the pension\nsanctioning authority to process the claim for\nfamily pension. He should forward the claim for\nfamily pension after verifying that there exists\nno scheme for grant of family pension to\nthe families of Government servant already\nabsorbed in the PSUs/Autonomous bodies.\n\n(12) For actual payment of retired benefits as a\nconsequence of absorption, the procedure\nprescribed for a retired employee should be\nfollowed.\n\n13 The materials on record would\nindicate that the widows of the\n\nrespective employees, who were absorbed in\nthe Gujarat Water Resources Development\nCorporation and were receiving the pension\nfrom the State Government, are being\ngranted the benefit of family pension.\nThe G.W.R.D.C. is also a Public Sector\nUndertaking of the State Government. I see no\ngood reason for the respondents to deny the\nbenefit so far as the petitioners are concerned,\nincluding the widows. I also take notice of the\nGovernment resolution dated 03.10.2012\nsanctioning the medical allowance to the\nGovernment / Panchayat employees, etc, which\n\nPage 25 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nreads as under:\n\nRESOLUTION:\n\nUnder the Government Resolution Dated :\n22/01/98, mentioned in the preamble, the state\nGovernment has decided to grant Medical\nAllowance of Rs.100/ per month to\nemployees as well as pensioners of the\nState Government and Panchayat. The revision\nof the existing rate of Medical Allowance was\nunder consideration of the Government.\nAfter careful consideration the\nGovernment is pleased to revise the existing\nrate of Medical Allowance Rs.100/ per month to\nRs.300/ per month with following conditions.\n\n1) These orders shall be applicable to\nemployees and pensioners of the State\nGovernment, employees and pensioners of\npanchayat and Primary and Secondary School\nteachers as well as Work Charged employees\n(who have completed the service of one full\nyear without any break).\n\n(2) These orders shall be implemented with\neffect from dated 01102012.\n\n(3) Other provisions of the G.R.F,D.\nDated 22011998 shall continue to be\napplicable.\n\n(4) Accounting system and conditions\nregarding option shall be as it is.\n\n14 I also take notice of the Government\nresolution dated 09.03.1999 as regards the\nabsorption of the Government employees in the\nPublic Sector Undertaking / Autonomous Body\nof the State Government. The same reads as\nunder:\n\nPage 26 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nIn the Government Resolution Finance\nDepartment No.NVT1196 GOI10P, dated:\n\n23.4.1998, Para 3 of the said Resolution\nis substituted as follow:\n\n3. The Government, after careful\nconsiderations, has decided to grant benefit\nof restoration of one third commuted\nportion of pension of pension after 15 years\nfrom the date of commutation or 1.4.1985,\nwhichever is later notwithstanding the\nfact that having commuted the full pension\nthey were not in receipt of any monthly\npension.\n\n15 I find merit in the submissions of Ms.\nPandya that the confusion has been created by\nthe Treasury Office, Vadodara, so far as the\ngrant of family pension to the two widows is\nconcerned. Ms. Pandya is right in submitting\nthat the Treasury Office has no authority to\ntake any decision in the absence of any\ndirection or decision taken by the highest\nauthority i.e. the Finance Department. I find\nsubstance in the submissions of Ms. Pandya\nthat the petitioners are claiming the two\nbenefits in their capacity as retired employees\nof the State Government i.e. for the services\nrendered with the State Government and not\nfor the services rendered with the GIRDA. In\nfact, the GIRDA has nothing to do with this\nissue.\n\n16 In the result, this application is allowed. The\nState Government as well as the respondent\nNo.3 herein are directed to see that\nthe medical allowance is sanctioned and paid\nto the pensioners along with the monthly\npension as they are receiving, and at the same\ntime, the two widows are paid the family\npensions in accordance with the rules\ngoverning the same. This exercise shall be\n\nPage 27 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\ncompleted within a period of two months from\ntoday and the payment should be made with\narrears from the date of filing of this petition.\"\n\n8 In the result, both the writ applications are\nallowed. The State Government as well as the\nrespondents Nos.1 and 2 are directed to see\nthat the medical allowance is sanctioned and\npaid to the petitioners along with a monthly\npension as they are receiving. If any of\nthe petitioners have passed away, then the\nwidows shall be paid family pension in\naccordance with the rules governing the\nsame with the necessary benefits. Let this\nexercise be completed within a period of two\nmonths from today and the payment should be\nmade with the arrears from the date of filing of\nthese petitions. Direct service is permitted.\"\n\n10. Accordingly, the case of the present petitioners is\n\nsquarely covered by\nthe above decision\n.\n\n11. To the submission made by learned AGP that the\n\npetitioners being fence-sitters and, therefore, the\n\ndecision of\nState of Uttar Pradesh\n(Supra) should\n\nbe made applicable, it is needless to say that by the\n\ndecision in the case of Vipul Aatmaram Parekh\n\n(Supra), this Court observing as under (paragraph 9\n\nthereof) has held that if at any particular of point,\n\nthere is decision of this Court every authority of the\n\nState Government is bound to follow the same and\n\nPage 28 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\napply its mind and extended them to the employees\n\nrather than compel them to come to Court.\n\n\"9. At the outset, it is required to be noted that\nthe objection raised by the respondent No.3\nthat while granting the benefit of higher pay\nscale on completion of 9 years service/seniority\nprior to the request transfer is not required to\nbe counted is not sustainable in view of the\nmany decisions of the Division Bench as well as\nlearned Single Judges of this Court. Even, the\ncontroversy in question is now not res integra\nin view of the the decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the case of Uttam Vishun\nPawar (supra). All the decisions have been\nconsidered by this Court in the recent decision\nof this Court in the case of Naynaben Manubhai\nVyas & Others(supra) dated 12.3.2009 in\nSpecial Civil Application No. 1446 of 1994 and\nother allied matters. In spite of the above\ndecisions of this Court, since long the office of\nthe respondent No.3 is raising same and similar\nobjection driving the employee to the Court and\nto obtain the similar order. If, on a particular\npoint there is a decision of this Court every\nauthority of the State Government is bound to\nfollow the same unless it is upset by the higher\nforum. The authority has to apply its mind\nbefore raising objection and grant the benefit\naccordingly and shall not compel the employee\nto obtain similar order from the Court. To raise\nthe objections again and again which are\noverruled by the Court by decision would not\nonly compelling the employee to incur the\nexpenditure towards the legal proceedings but\nit will also increase the litigation and burden to\nthe Courts, which are otherwise today heavy\nburdened due to backlog of cases and Courts\nare trying their best to get out of the backlog.\nIn the case of (Smt) Dhanlakshmiben Liladhar\n\nPage 29 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nSuchak (supra) the learned Single Judge of this\nCourt as far as back in the year 1992 has\nobserved that the Government should be model\nemployer. The model employer is one who\nwould not deny just claim of his employee and\nemployees on any technical ground. Such\nmodel employer would not wait for any\ndirection to be given to accept just claim of the\nemployee/employees. It is further observed that\nonce it is found that an employee is similarly\nsituated the benefits flowing from a judgment\nin a case of other similarly situated employee,\nit should be given to other similarly situated\nemployee and employee should not be driven to\nthe Court for addressing just grievances. Even\nin the case of Secretary, Labour, Social Welfare\n& Tribunal Development Department & Anr.\n(Supra), the Full Bench of this Court in para 9\nand 10 has observed and held as under:\n\n\"9. The legal position regarding the\nbinding nature of judgments delivered by\nHigh Courts was clearly explained as far\nback as 1962 by the Supreme Court.\nIn\n\nEast India Commercial Co. Ltd. V.\nCollector of Customs, Calcuttam A.I.R.\n\n1962 S.C. 1893, Subba Rao.\nJ. (as he then\nwas) speaking for himself and Mudholkar\nJ., has explained though A.K. Sarkar J.\n\nwho was the legal position, the legal\nposition in paragraph 29 of the report as\nfollows:\n\nThis raises the question whether an\nadministrative tribunal can ignore\nthe law declared by the highest court\nin the State and initiate proceedings\nin direct violation of the law so\ndeclared. Under\nArt. 215\n, every High\nCourt shall be a court of record and\nshall have all the powers of such a\ncourt including the power to punish\nfor contempt of itself. Under Art:\n\nPage 30 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n226, it has a plenary power to issue\norders or writs for the enforcement\nof the fundamental rights and for any\nother purpose to any person or\nauthority, including in appropriate\ncases any Government, within its\nterritorial jurisdiction. Under\nArt.\nit has jurisdiction over all courts\nand tribunals throughout the\nterritories in relation to which it\nexercises jurisdiction. It would be\nanomalous to suggest that a tribunal\nover which the High Court has\nsuperintendence can ignore the law\ndeclared by that court and start\nproceedings in direct violation of it. If\na tribunal can do so, all the\nsubordinate courts can equally do so,\nfor there is no specific provision, just\nlike in the case of Supreme Court,\nmaking the law declared by the High\nCourt binding on subordinate courts.\n\nIt is implicit in the power of\nsupervision conferred on a superior\ntribunal that all the tribunals subject\nto its supervision should conform to\nthe law\nlaid down by\nit. Such\nobedience would also be conducive to\ntheir smooth working: otherwise,\nthere would be confusion in the\nadministration of law and respect for\nlaw would irretrievably suffer, We,\ntherefore, hold that the law declared\nby the highest court in the State is\nbinding on authorities or tribunals\nunder its superintendence, and that\nthey cannot ignore it either in\ninitiating a proceeding or deciding on\nthe rights involved in such a\nproceeding. If that be so, the notice\nissued by the authority, signifying the\nlaunching of proceedings contrary to\n\nPage 31 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nthe law\nlaid down by\nthe High Court\nwould be invalid and the proceedings\nthemselves would be without\njurisdiction.\"\n\nThe position was reiterated in\nMakhan Lal\nVs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, A.I.R.\n\n1971 S.C. 2206. It was the context of the\nlaw declared by the Supreme Court that\nthe decision laid down to that effect so far\nas\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution was\nconcerned, but what has been observed in\nparagraph 5 at page 2209 by Grover J.\nspeaking for the Supreme Court has equal\napplication so far as pronouncements by\nthe High Courts are concerned. Grover J.\nobserved at page 2209:\n\n\"The Judgment which was delivered\ndid not merely declare the\npromotions granted to the\nrespondents in the writ petition filed\nat the previous stage as\nunconstitutional but also\nlaid down in\n\nclear and unequivocal terms that the\ndistribution of appointments, posts or\npromotions made in implementation\nof the communal policy was contrary\nto the constitutional guarantee of\n\nArticle 16.\nThe law so declared by\nthis court was binding on the\nrespondent State and its officers and\nthey were bound to follow it whether\na majority of the present respondents\nwere parties or not to the previous\npetition.\"\n\nIt cannot, therefore, be contended by\nanyone, that since Acharya, the\npetitioner in Special Civil Application\nNo. 2215 of 1979, was not a party to\nSpecial Civil Application No. 806 of\n1975, that the law\nlaid down by\nD.A.\n\nPage 32 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nDesai, J. in his judgment\nin that case\n\non August 7, 1975 was not applicable\nto the case of Acharya.\nWhether the\nlaw is declared by the Supreme Court\nor whether the law is declared by the\nHigh Court, the legal position as\nregards authorities and tribunals\nsubordinate to the Supreme Court\nand High Courts respectively is the\nsame as pointed out by Subba Rao J.\n\nin\nEast India Commercial Co.s\ncase\n(supra).\n\n10.\nIn\nShri Baradakanta Mishtra V.\nShri Bhimsen Dixit, A.I.R.\n1972 S.C.\n2466, the legal position regarding\nbinding nature of the High Court's\ndecision was once again reiterated by\nthe Supreme Court and after quoting\nthe above passage which we have\nextracted from the judgment of\nSubba Rao J. in East India\nCommercial Co. s case (supra) in\nparagraphs 15 and 16 of the\njudgment, Dwiveid J. speaking for the\nSupreme Court observed at page\n2169:\n\n\"The conduct of the appellant in\nfollowing the previous decision of the\nHigh Court is calculated to create\nconfusion in the administration of\nlaw. It will undermine respect for law\n\nlaid down by\nthe High Court and\nimpair the constitutional authority of\nthe High Court. His conduct is\ntherefore comprehended by the\nprinciples underlying the law of\ncontempt. The analogy of the inferior\ncourt's disobedience to the specific\norder of a superior court also\nsuggests that his conduct falls within\nthe purview of the law of contempt.\n\nPage 33 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nJust as the disobedience to a specific\norder of the Court undermines the\nauthority and dignity of the court in a\nparticular case, similarly any\ndeliberate and mala fide conduct of\nnot following the law\nlaid down in\nthe\nprevious decision undermines the\nconstitutional authority and respect\nof the High Court. Indeed, while the\nformer conduct has repercussions on\nan individual case and on a limited\nnumber of persons, the later conduct\nhas a much wider and more\ndisastrous impact. It is calculated not\nonly to undermine the constitutional\nauthority and respect of the High\nCourt generally, but is also likely to\nsubvert the Rule of law and engender\nharassing uncertainty and confusion\nin the administration of law.\"\n\nIn\nHashmukhlal C. Shah V. State of\nGujarat\n, 19 G.L.R. 378, a Division\nBench of this High Court consisting\nof J.B. Mehta and P.D. Desai JJ. after\nexamining several decisions on the\npoint, observed: \"... in a Government\nwhich is ruled by laws, there must be\ncomplete awareness to carry out\nfaithfully and honestly lawful orders\npassed by a Court of law after\nimpartial adjudication. Then only will\nprivate individuals, organizations and\ninstitutions learn to respect the\ndecisions of Court. In absence of\nsuch attitude on the part of all\nconcerned, chaotic conditions might\narise and the function assigned to the\nCourts of law under the Constitution\nmight be rendered a futile exercise.\"\n\nFrom these four decisions, the\nfollowing propositions emerges:\n\nPage 34 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n(1).It is immaterial that in a previous\nlitigation the particular petitioner\nbefore the Court was or was not a\nparty, but if law on a particular point\nhas been\nlaid down by\nthe High\nCourt, it must be followed by all\nauthorities and tribunals in the State.\n\n(2).The law\nlaid down by\nthe High\nCourt must be followed by all\nauthorities and subordinate tribunals\nwhen it has been declared by the\nhighest Court in the State and they\ncannot ignore it either in initiating\nproceeding of deciding on the rights\ninvolved in such a proceeding.\n\n(3).If in spite of the earlier exposition\nof law by the High Court having been\npointed out and attention being\npointedly drawn to that legal position\nin utter disregard of that position\nproceedings are initiated, it must be\nheld to be a wilful disregard of the\nlaw\nlaid down by\nthe High Court and\nwould amount to civil contempt as\ndefined in\nsection 2(b)\nof the\nContempt Courts Act, 1971.\"\n\nThus, even the Division Bench has held\nthat not following the law\nlaid down by\nthe\nHigh Court and disregarding the same\nwould amount to Civil Contempt as\ndefined in\nSection 2(b)\nof the of the\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971. However,\nin view of the unconditional apology\ntendered by the concerned officer, which\nis accepted, no further order is passed.\"\n\n12. Even in the case of\nTarsem Singh\n(Supra), the\n\nPage 35 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nSupreme Court in paragraph Nos.4 to 8 has observed\n\nas under:\n\n\"4. The principles underlying continuing\nwrongs and recurring/ successive wrongs have\nbeen applied to service law disputes. A\n`continuing wrong' refers to a single wrongful\nact which causes a continuing injury.\n`Recurring/successive wrongs' are those which\noccur periodically, each wrong giving rise to a\ndistinct and separate cause of action. This\nCourt in Balakrishna S.P. Waghmare vs. Shree\nDhyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan - [AIR 1959 SC\n798], explained the concept of continuing\nwrong (in the context of Section 23 of\nLimitation Act, 1908 corresponding to\nSection 22\n\nof Limitation Act, 1963) :\n\n\"31. It is the very essence of a continuing\nwrong that it is an act which creates a\ncontinuing source of injury and renders the\ndoer of the act responsible and liable for the\ncontinuance of the said injury. If the wrongful\nact causes an injury which is complete, there is\nno continuing wrong even though the damage\nresulting from the act may continue. If,\nhowever, a wrongful act is of such a character\nthat the injury caused by it itself continues,\nthen the act constitutes a continuing wrong. In\nthis connection, it is necessary to draw a\ndistinction between the injury caused by the\nwrongful act and what may be described as the\neffect of the said injury.\"\n\n5.\nIn\nM. R. Gupta vs. Union of India\n[1995 (5)\nSCC 628], the appellant approached the High\nCourt in 1989 with a grievance in regard to his\ninitial pay fixation with effect from 1.8.1978.\nThe claim was rejected as it was raised after 11\nyears. This Court applied the principles of\n\nPage 36 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\ncontinuing wrong and recurring wrongs and\nreversed the decision. This Court held :\n\n\"5. ...The appellant's grievance that his\npay fixation was not in accordance with\nthe rules, was the assertion of a\ncontinuing wrong against him which gave\nrise to a recurring cause of action each\ntime he was paid a salary which was not\ncomputed in accordance with the rules. So\nlong as the appellant is in service, a fresh\ncause of action arises every month when\nhe is paid his monthly salary on the basis\nof a wrong computation made contrary to\nrules. It is no doubt true that if the\nappellant's claim is found correct on\nmerits, he would be entitled to be paid\naccording to the properly fixed pay scale\nin the future and the question of limitation\nwould arise for recovery of the arrears for\nthe past period. In other words, the\nappellant's claim, if any, for recovery of\narrears calculated on the basis of\ndifference in the pay which has become\ntime barred would not be recoverable, but\nhe would be entitled to proper fixation of\nhis pay in accordance with rules and to\ncessation of a continuing wrong if on\nmerits his claim is justified. Similarly, any\nother consequential relief claimed by him,\nsuch as, promotion etc., would also be\nsubject to the defence of latches etc. to\ndis-entitle him to those reliefs. The pay\nfixation can be made only on the basis of\nthe situation existing on 1.8.1978 without\ntaking into account any other\nconsequential relief which may be barred\nby his latches and the bar of limitation. It\nis to this limited extent of proper pay\nfixation, the application cannot be treated\nas time barred.........\"\n\nPage 37 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\n6.\nIn\nShiv Dass vs. Union of India\n- 2007 (9)\nSCC 277 Paras 8 & 10), this Court held:\n\n\"8... The High Court does not ordinarily\npermit a belated resort to the\nextraordinary remedy because it is likely\nto cause confusion and public\ninconvenience and bring in its train new\ninjustices, and if writ jurisdiction is\nexercised after unreasonable delay, it may\nhave the effect of inflicting not only\nhardship and inconvenience but also\ninjustice on third parties. It was pointed\nout that when writ jurisdiction is invoked,\nunexplained delay coupled with the\ncreation of third party rights in the\nmeantime is an important factor which\nalso weighs with the High Court in\ndeciding whether or not to exercise such\njurisdiction.\n\n10. In the case of pension the cause of\naction actually continues from month to\nmonth. That, however, cannot be a ground\nto overlook delay in filing the\npetition.......... If petition is filed beyond a\nreasonable period say three years\nnormally the Court would reject the same\nor restrict the relief which could be\ngranted to a reasonable period of about\nthree years.\"\n\n7. To summarise, normally, a belated service\nrelated claim will be rejected on the ground of\ndelay and latches (where remedy is sought by\nfiling a writ petition) or limitation (where\nremedy is sought by an application to the\nAdministrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions\nto the said rule is cases relating to a continuing\nwrong. Where a service related claim is based\non a continuing wrong, relief can be granted\neven if there is a long delay in seeking remedy,\n\nPage 38 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\nwith reference to the date on which the\ncontinuing wrong commenced, if such\ncontinuing wrong creates a continuing source\nof injury. But there is an exception to the\nexception. If the grievance is in respect of any\norder or administrative decision which related\nto or affected several others also, and if the re-\nopening of the issue would affect the settled\nrights of third parties, then the claim will not\nbe entertained. For example, if the issue relates\nto payment or re-fixation of pay or pension,\nrelief may be granted in spite of delay as it\ndoes not affect the rights of third parties. But if\nthe claim involved issues relating to seniority\nor promotion etc., affecting others, delay would\nrender the claim stale and doctrine of\nlaches/limitation will be applied. In so far as\nthe consequential relief of recovery of arrears\nfor a past period, the principles relating to\nrecurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a\nconsequence, High Courts will restrict the\nconsequential relief relating to arrears\nnormally to a period of three years prior to the\ndate of filing of the writ petition.\n\n8. In this case, the delay of 16 years would\naffect the consequential claim for arrears. The\nHigh Court was not justified in directing\npayment of arrears relating to 16 years, and\nthat too with interest. It ought to have\nrestricted the relief relating to arrears to only\nthree years before the date of writ petition, or\nfrom the date of demand to date of writ\npetition, whichever was lesser. It ought not to\nhave granted interest on arrears in such\ncircumstances.\"\n\n13. For the aforesaid reasons, all these petitions are\n\nallowed. The respondents are directed to see that the\n\nPage 39 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022\n\nC/SCA/3180/2019 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022\n\npetitioners are sanctioned medical allowance and the\n\nsame is paid to the petitioners alongwith monthly\n\npension in accordance with the directions issued by\n\nthis Court in the case of Special Civil Application\n\nNo.12918/2010. That exercise shall be completed\n\nwithin a period of two months from the date of receipt\n\nof copy of the order and the payment should be made\n\nwith arrears from the date of filing of the petition.\n\nRule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent. Direct\n\nService is permitted.\n\n(BIREN VAISHNAV, J)\nVATSAL S. KOTECHA\n\nPage 40 of 40\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022",
