This is a case where the dream of the Decree Holder to own a home\nbecame a reality when the Suit for Specific Performance of an Agreement\nto Sell was decreed with alacrity in less than two months. However, it\nturned into a mirage as she embarked on a long and arduous journey on\nthe path of execution since 1988, which continues even after 38 years.\nThe adage by an unknown Writer \"The Hurrier I Go, The Behinder I Get\"\naptly explains the dilemma of Decree Holder. The journey to realize the\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 1 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nfruits of the Decree may still not end with the determination of these\nObjections.\n2. This case reflects the archetype challenges of an adversarial\nlitigation system and urgently requires the attention of all the stakeholders\nto assume responsibility to work out a mechanism to ensure that the\nperson with a Decree is not left only with papers which do not materialize\ninto fruition.\n3. The Objections under\nSection 47\nread with\nSection 151\nof the Code\nof Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as \"\nCPC\n, 1908\") have\nbeen filed on behalf of Ms. Meena Rani Gupta and Ms. Nalini Gupta\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Objectors\") in the Execution Petition filed on\nbehalf of Ms. Veena Mahajan, Decree Holder (hereinafter referred to as\n\"DH\") for execution of the Judgment and Decree dated 29 th April, 1988 in\nSuit No. 553/1998 for Specific Performance of an Agreement to Sell\nwhich was decreed in favour of the plaintiff/DH.\n4. The suit property got subjected to chain transactions of Sale on the\nbasis of Agreements to Sell and other ancillary documents. Mr. V.N.\nVerma, Judgement Debtor (hereinafter referred to as \"JD\"), the original\nowner, sold his Property bearing Plot No. 40 situated at Chitra Vihar\nbehind Radhu Cinema in the Village Khreji Khas, Elaka Shahdara,\nDelhi-110092 (hereinafter referred to as \"suit property\") to the DH Ms.\nVeena Mahajan vide Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986. The\nJD again entered into a sale transaction in regard to this property on 21 st\nJanuary, 1988 by executing an Agreement to Sell, Undertaking/affidavit &\nRegistered Will in favour of Kamlesh Gupta and Registered Special\nPower of Attorney & General Power of Attorney in favour of her husband,\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 2 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nMr. Gagan Prasad Gupta. In part performance of the Agreement to Sell,\nthey were put in physical possession of the suit property by the JD, and\nunder the Agreement to Construction, they were fully authorized to raise\nor construct the building and further use the building for the residence of\nhimself/herself or his/her nominee or to let out the property to anybody in\npart or full, and collect the rent from such tenants.\n5. In the integrum, Civil Suit bearing No. 533/1988 titled Veena\nMahajan vs. V.N. Verma for Specific Performance and Possession and in\nthe alternative for Refund of the Part Payment and Damages was filed by\nthe DH on 07.03.1998 (i.e., after the execution of the Agreement to Sell\ndated 21st January 1988 in favour of Kamlesh Gupta).\n6. This Court vide Order dated 14th March, 1988 passed an interim\norder restraining the defendant i.e., V.N. Verma (JD) by way of temporary\ninjunction from selling or parting with the possession or creating any\nthird-party rights in the property.\n7. The Suit was decreed vide Judgement dated 29th April, 1998. The\noperative part of judgement reads as under:\n\"This suit on this coming day for final disposal before this\ncourt in the presence of the counsel for the parties as\naforesaid, it is ordered that a decree for specific performance\nof the Agreement to Sell dated 14.02.1986 with regard to plot\nNo, situated at village Khureji Khas, measuring 3602 sq. yards\nin Chitra Vihar, be and the same is hereby passed in favour of\nthe Plaintiff and against the defendant directing:\n(i) the plaintiff to deposit the sum of Rs. 70,000/- on\nor before 31.07.1998:\n(ii) on the plaintiff depositing the amount, the\ndefendant shall execute necessary document in\nfavour of the plaintiff within thirty days from the\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 3 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\ndate of deposit and in the event of the defendant\nnot executing the necessary document, the\nplaintiff shall be entitled to apply for a proper\ndirection for the appointment of an officer of this\nCourt for the purpose of executing the required\ndocuments in favour of the plaintiff and for\nregistering the same at the cost of the plaintiff\"\n8. While the Execution was pending, Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and Mr.\nGagan Prasad Gupta further sold the suit property to the Objectors by\nexecuting an Agreement to Sell, Registered Will, General /Special Power\nof Attorney and Receipt dated 26th November, 1990 and handed over the\nactual physical and vacant possession of the plot to them in part\nperformance thereof. The Objectors were given similar assurance at the\ntime of execution of Agreement to Sell that they shall be entitled to hold,\nenjoy and use the plot and put it to use as permissible under law without\nany hindrance either from Ms. Kamlesh Gupta or from the confirming\nparty or any other person claiming through or under them. In addition to\nthis, the Agreement to Sell also contained a clause that the plot in question\nwas absolutely free from any kind of encumbrances.\n9. An Agreement for Building Construction dated 11 th September,\n1990 was also executed by the JD acting through Attorney Ganga Parshad\nGupta in favour of Mr. Binod Kumar Gupta, husband of Ms. Meena Rani\nGupta, applicant No. 1 and Mr. Anant Kumar Gupta, husband of Ms.\nNalini Gupta, applicant No. 2.\n10. The JD challenged the Judgement and Decree by filing the\nRFA (OS) 86/1998. The Objectors came to know for the first time on\n07th December, 1998, about the pendency of the present Suit. They moved\nan application under\nOrder I Rule 10 of CPC\n, 1908 to be impleaded as a\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 4 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nparty in the said appeal but the application for impleadment was dismissed\nby observing that the Objectors were strangers to the suit. The application\nwas also dismissed by the Division Bench by its Judgement dated\n18th January, 2012.\n\n11. This led the Objectors to file an independent Appeal vide RFA (OS)\n125/1998 against the Judgement dated 18th January, 2012, but it met the\nsame fate of dismissal. However, while dismissing the Appeal, the\nDivision Bench observed that whatever defences are available to the\nappellants to seek possession of the suit property, may be raised at the\ntime of execution of the Decree.\n\n12. The Objectors, thereafter, filed a petition under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution of India seeking leave of the Hon'ble Apex Court, but the\npetition was dismissed vide Order dated 04th July, 2012.\n13. The Objectors have then filed a Suit bearing No. CS (OS) 779/2001\nfor Specific Performance and in the alternative for Damages which is\npending disposal.\n14. The DH filed the present Execution petition for execution of the\nJudgement and Decree dated 29thApril, 1998. The Objectors have filed\nagainst the Objections under\nSection 47\nof CPC, 1908 for protection of\ntheir possession as they are in physical possession of the suit property by\nway of part performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 26th November,\n1990 under\nSection 53A\nof Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"TPA, 1882\"). The Objectors have asserted that while\nentering into the transaction on 26th November, 1990, neither were they\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 5 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\naware that the JD had already entered into an Agreement to Sell with DH\nnor was the pendency of suit in their knowledge.\n15. It is further asserted that a fraud has been committed on the Court\non account of collusion between DH and JD. Despite the JD's admissions\nin the cross-examination as DW-1 during the trial that he had entered into\nan Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, no steps were taken either\nby JD or DH to implead Ms. Kamlesh Gupta as a party to the Suit.\n16. The JD was not in physical possession of the suit property at the\ntime of institution of the suit. The Agreement to Sell was executed by JD\nin favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta prior to filing of the suit and the doctrine\nof lis pendens enshrined under\nSection 52\nof the TPA, 1882 is not\napplicable. The Objectors have asserted that they have independent rights\nand are entitled to protection of their possession by virtue of\nSection 53A\n\nof TPA, 1882.\n17. The Objectors have stated that the question of law that has arisen is\nwhether the person having an Agreement to Sell, who may not be affected\nby\nSection 52\nof TPA, 1882, would have the protection of\nSection 53A\nof\nthe TPA, 1882 and if so, whether such person is bound by a Decree made\nin respect of the immovable property to which they were not made a party.\n18. It is submitted that this Court under\nOrder I Rule 10 of CPC\n, 1908\nmay add the Objectors as a party to the present proceedings as has been\nheld in Baster Transport and Trading Co. & Anr. vs. Court of Wards\nBaster and Anr AIR 1955 Nagpur 78. The Objectors have a locus standi\nto file the objections for which reliance is placed on Kancherla\nLakshminarayana vs. Mattararthi Syamala and Ors. 2008 (14) 258. A\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 6 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nprayer has, therefore, been made that the objections may be allowed, and\nthe execution proceedings be dismissed.\n19. The DH, VeenaMahajan in her Reply to the objections has taken\na preliminary objection that the Objectors have already availed all the\nremedies and all their applications and appeals have been dismissed. The\npresent Objections are frivolous and have been filed only with the\ndishonest intention to delay the proceedings.\n20. In response to the contention of part performance, it is asserted that\nthe Objectors cannot avail any protection under\nSection 53A\nof\nTPA, 1882 as the same is available only against the transferor and not a\nthird party for which reliance has been placed on Rambhau Namdeo Gajre\nvs. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra (2004) 8 SCC 614. The protection of part\nperformance could have been availed by the objectors from the alleged\nTransferor i.e., Ms Kamlesh Gupta who was not a party to the main suit.\n21. On merits, all the averments made in the application are denied by\nthe DH.\n22. Submissions heard.\n23. Admittedly, the JD who was the owner of the suit property, entered\ninto an Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 with the DH, but\nfailed to execute the Sale Deed. The DH filed a Suit for Specific\nPerformance in 1988 which was decreed vide Judgement/Decree dated\n29th April, 1988, the execution of which has been sought by way of\npresent Execution Petition.\n24. The Apex Court in Sanjeev Lal and Others vs. Commissioner of\nIncome Tax, Chandigarh and Another, (2015) 5 SCC 775 observed that\nwhen a right is created in favour of the Vendee, the Vendor is restrained\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 7 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nfrom selling the said property to someone else because the vendee, in\nwhose favour a right in personam is created, has a legitimate right to\nenforce specific performance of the Agreement, if the Vendor for some\nreason is not executing the sale deed. It can thus be extrapolated that the\nconsequence of execution of the Agreement to Sell is that the owner\ncannot sell the property to someone else and the Vendor's right to further\nsell the property stands extinguished.\n25. Undeterred and in defiance of the legal embargo as explained in\nSanjeev Lal (supra), the JD went ahead and executed the Agreement to\nSell, registered Will, registered General /Special Power of Attorney, all\ndated 21st January, 1988 in favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and her\nhusband, Gagan Parshad. Thereafter, the present suit was filed in March,\n1988 by the DH and Injunction order was granted on 14th March, 1988\nwhich is subsequent to the delivery of possession of the suit property by\nthe JD to Ms. Kamlesh Gupta.Ms. Kamlesh Gupta in turn executed the\nAgreement to Sell dated 26th November, 1990 in favour of the Objectors,\nwho were then put in possession of the suit property.\n\nDoctrine of Lis Pendis under\nSection 52\nof the Transfer of Property\nAct, 1882:\n\n26. The Objectors have claimed that the doctrine of lis pendis is not\napplicable to them since they derive their title, not from the JD, but from\nMs.Kamlesh Gupta, who was not a party to the suit.\n27. Significantly, the Objectors' claim to title is based on the\ntransaction entered into during the pendency of the Execution of the\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 8 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\ndecree made in the Suit i.e., they are the transferee pendent lite deriving\ntheir rights from the JD even though through Kamlesh Gupta.\n28. The Rule of lis pendisis based on the principles of justice, equity\nand good conscious, which is enshrined in\nSection 52\nof the TPA, 1882. It\nreads as under: -\n\"\nSection 52\n-Transfer of property pending suit relating\nthereto.--\nDuring the pendency in any Court having authority within the\nlimits of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir or\nestablished beyond such limits by the Central Government of\nany suit or proceedings which is not collusive and in which any\nright to immoveable property is directly and specifically in\nquestion, the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt\nwith by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the\nrights of any other party thereto under any decree or order\nwhich may be made therein, except under the authority of the\nCourt and on such terms as it may impose.\nExplanation.--For the purposes of this section, the pendency of\na suit or proceeding shall be deemed to commence from the\ndate of the presentation of the plaint or the institution of the\nproceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction, and to\ncontinue until the suit or proceeding has been disposed of by a\nfinal decree or order and complete satisfaction or discharge of\nsuch decree or order has been obtained, or has become\nunobtainable by reason of the expiration of any period of\nlimitation prescribed for the execution thereof by any law for\nthe time being in force.\"\n\n29. In Ballamy vs. Sabine,(1857) 1 DeG&J 566, Lord Cranworth, L.C.\nabout one and a half centuries back, explained that this doctrine is based\non the necessity of putting an end to litigation which otherwise would\ncontinue ad infinitum. The relevant paragraph reads thus:\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 9 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n\"...where a litigation is pending between a plaintiff and a\ndefendant as to the right to a particular estate, the necessities of\nmankind require that the decision of the Court in the suit shall\nbe binding not only on the litigating parties, but also on those\nwho derive title under them by way of alienations made during\nthe pendency of the suit, whether such alienees had or had not\nnotice of the pending proceedings. If this is not so, there could\nbe no certainty that the litigation would ever come to an end.\"\n\n30. In Amit Kumar Shaw vs. Farida Khatoon (2005) 11 SCC 403, the\nHon'ble Apex Court observed that the doctrine of lis pendens, therefore,\napplies only when the lis is pending before a Court. It enumerated the\nfollowing elements that should be present in order to constitute lis\npendens:\n\"1. There must be a suit or proceeding pending in a court of competent\njurisdiction.\n2. The suit or proceeding must not be collusive.\n3. The litigation must be one in which the right to immovable property\nis directly and specifically in question.\n4. There must be a transfer of or otherwise a dealing with the property\nin dispute by any party to the litigation.\n5. Such transfer must affect the rights of the other party that may\nultimately accrue under the terms of the decree or order.\"\n\n31. In Smt. Ram Peary vs. Gauri and Ors., AIR 1978 All 318, the Full\nBench of Allahabad High Court explained that this rule is based on the\nprinciples of public policy wherein a purchaser who purchases during the\npendency of a suit need not be impleaded as a party and shall have\nsubservient rights in comparison to the litigating parties. It expounded the\ndoctrine of lis pendens as follows:\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 10 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n\"...Ordinarily, it is true that the judgment of a court binds only the\nparties and their privies in representations or estate. But he who\npurchases during the pendency of an action, is held bound by the\njudgement that may be against the person from whom he derives\ntitle. The litigating parties are exempted from taking any notice of\nthe title so acquired; and such purchaser need not be made a party\nto the action. Where there is a real and fair purchase without any\nnotice, the rule may operate very hardly. But it is a rule founded\nupon a great public policy; for otherwise, alienations made during\nan action might defeat its whole purpose, and there would be no\nend to litigation. And hence arises the maxim pendente lite, nihil\ninnovetur; the effect of which is not to annul the conveyance, but\nonly to render it subservient to the rights of the parties in the\nlitigation. As to the rights of these parties, the conveyance is\ntreated as if it never had any existence; and it does not vary them.\"\n\n32. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Usha Sinha vs Dina Ram\n(2008) SCC 144 explained the rights of the transferee pendent lite by\nobserving that a transferee from a Judgment Debtor is presumed to be\naware of the proceedings before the Court of Law. Thus, he should be\ncareful before he purchases the property which is the subject matter of\nlitigation. Rule 102 of\nOrder XXI of CPC\n, 1908 thus takes into account\nthe ground reality and refuses to extend a helping hand to purchasers of a\nproperty in respect of which the litigation is pending. It recognizes the\ndoctrine lis pendens contained in\nSection 52\nof the TPA, 1882. Similar\nobservations were made by the Apex Court in Sarvinder Singh vs. Dalip\nSingh (1996) 5 SCC 539.\n33. In Sanjay Verma vs. Manik Roy and Ors. (2006) 13 SCC 608, in\naccordance with equity, good conscience and justice, applying the\nprinciples of public policy as contained in\nSection 52\nof TPA, 1882, it was\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 11 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nconcluded that it will be impossible to bring an action or suit to a\nsuccessful termination if alienations are permitted to prevail and no\nquestion of good faith or bona fide arises. A Transferee pendente lite is\nbound by the decree just as if he was a party to the Suit. The mere\npendency of a suit does not prevent one of the parties from dealing with\nthe property constituting the subject matter of the suit. The section only\npostulates a condition that the alienation will in no manner affect the\nrights of the other party under any decree which may be passed in a Suit,\nunless the property was alienated with the permission of the court. The\nview expressed in Ballamy (supra) were thus endorsed.\n34. Similarly, in M.S. Mansoor Deen and Ors. vs. Fathimuthu Bevy\n&Ors. (2009) 4 CTC 489, the Madras High Court observed that the\ntransferees pendente lite from the JD having no independent right in the\nteeth of\nSection 52\nof the TPA, 1882, cannot resist the execution since\nunder the doctrine of lis pendens a Decree passed in a suit during the\npendency of which a transfer is effected, makes the decree binding on the\ntransferee.\n35. In Silverline Forum Private Limited vs. Rajiv Trust (1998) 3 SCC\n723, while considering the resistance caused by the transferee pendente\nlite, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the scope of the adjudication is\nconfined to the question of whether he was a transferee during the\npendency of the suit in which the decree was passed. If such finding is in\naffirmative, the executing court must hold that he has no right to resist or\nobstruct the proceedings and such person cannot seek protection from the\nexecuting Court. The exclusion of such a third party Transferee from\nraising further contentions is based on the salutary principle adumbrated\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 12 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nin\nSection 52\nof TPA, 1882. For example, if the obstructer admits that he\nis the Transferee pendente lite, it is not necessary to determine a question\nraised by him that he was unaware of the litigation when he purchased the\nproperty. Similarly, a third-party who questions the validity of a transfer\nmade by a DH to an assignee, cannot claim that the question regarding its\nvalidity should be decided during the executing proceedings.\n36. Hence, the question for determination is whether the title of the\nObjectors is superior to that of the Decree Holder and whether they are\nentitled to remain in possession on the strength of the Agreement to Sell\ndated 26th November, 1990 executed in their favour by Ms. Kamlesh\nGupta.\n37. The Agreement to Sell was executed by the JD in favour of the DH\non 14th February, 1986. Subsequently, he entered into another Agreement\nto Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta on 21.01.1988, which is prior to the\ninstitution of this Suit. Once the Agreement to Sell had already been\nexecuted in favour of the DH on 14th February, 1986, any subsequent\nAgreement to Sell would obviously be subject to the earlier interest\nalready created by way of the Agreement to Sell dated 14th February,\n1986.\n38. Ms. Kamlesh Gupta could have sought execution of Agreement to\nSell only if she could establish that her title was superior to that of the\nDH. But in the absence of any Sale Deed in her favour, she could not have\nasserted any ownership rights. Thus, merely on the basis of an Agreement\nto Sell, she could not have transferred the ownership rights which she\nherself did not possess.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 13 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n39. The sole claim of the Objectors' rests on the Agreement to Sell\ndated 26th November, 1990 executed by Ms. Kamlesh Gupta during the\npendency of the present Suit. From the admitted facts, it is evident that\nMs. Kamlesh Gupta merely had an Agreement to Sell and other\ndocuments in her favour, but the big question is whether the mere\nexecution of an Agreement to Sell amounted to sale of the suit property as\ndefined under\nSection 54\nof TPA, 1882 or whether it was merely an\nAgreement subject to the rights of the owner i.e., the JD.\n40. Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and her husband Gagan Parshad are the\npredecessor-in-interest through whom the Objectors are claiming a right\nand title which cannot be better than that of the predecessor-in-interest\ni.e., Ms. Kamlesh Gupta. Rather, the rights of Ms. Kamlesh are\nsubservient to those of DH as held in the case of Ram Peary (supra). In\naddition to this, the JD, having entered into Agreement to Sell dated 14th\nFebruary, 1986 with the DH, was enjoined by law from entering into any\nfurther sale transaction with third party. The facts in hand get squarely\nanswered by the decision of the Apex Court in Sanjeev Lal (supra).\n41. The DH has already got a Decree dated 29th April, 1988 in her\nfavour and has been held to be entitled to specific performance on the\nbasis of Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 which is prior to the\ndocuments dated 21st January, 1988 executed in favour of Kamlesh\nthrough whom the Objectors are claiming a title.\n42. Though the Agreement to Sell between the JD and Kamlesh Gupta\nwas executed on 21st January, 1988 i.e., prior to the institution of the Suit\nby the DH, the Agreement to Sell dated 26th November, 1990 between\nKamlesh Gupta and the Objectors was executed subsequent to the Decree\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 14 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nfor Specific Performance dated 29th April, 1988 in favour of DH. Thus,\nKamlesh Gupta and Ganga Prasad Gupta, though not a party to the Suit,\nwere made party to the Execution Petition No 282/2012 for the execution\nof the Decree in CS (OS) 553/1988.\n43. The explanation to\nSection 52\nof TPA, 1882 provides that lis\npendens subsists until the decree is discharged. With the execution of the\ndecree yet to be effected, Suit No 553/1998 is still lis pendence for the\npurposes for\nsection 52\nof the TPA, 1882 making the transaction between\nKamlesh Gupta and the Objectors fall under the scope of\nSection 52\nof\nTPA, 1882. As observed in Sanjay Verma (supra), a Transferee pendente\nlite is bound by the decree, thus making the appellants, who were\ntransferees from Kamlesh Gupta, bound by the Decree.\n44. In Surjit Singh vs. Harbans Singh (1995) 6 SCC 50, the Hon'ble\nApex Court answered the question of whether a person to whom the suit\nproperty is alienated after passing of the preliminary decree by the trial\ncourt which had restrained the parties from alienating or otherwise\ntransferring the suit property, has the right to be impleaded as party, in the\nnegative. While rejecting the impleadment of the assignees, the Hon'ble\nApex Court had also observed that if alienation/assignment is allowed in\ndefiance of the restraint order, it would defeat the ends of justice and the\nprevalent public policy. When the Court intends a particular state of\naffairs to exist while it is in seisin of a lis, that state of affairs is not only\nrequired to be maintained but is presumed to exist till the Court orders\notherwise. The court in these circumstances has the duty, as also the right,\nto treat the alienation/assignment as having not taken place at all for its\npurposes.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 15 of 28\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:18:48\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n45. In Vidur Impex and Traders Private Limited vs. Tosh Apartments\nPrivate Limited and Others (2012) 8 SCC 384, while making a reference\nto Surjit Singh (supra), it was held that where an Agreement to Sell was\nmade and even the Sale Deed pursuant thereto was executed by\nrespondent No. 2 in favour of the appellants in a clandestine manner and\n\nin violation of the injunction granted by the High Court, it cannot be said\nthat any valid title or interest has been acquired by the appellants in the\nsuit property by virtue of such a Sale Deed.\n\n46. Thus, the transaction inter se between Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and the\napplicant dated 26.11.1990 is covered by doctrine of lis pendens as\nprovided in\nSection 52\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and the\nrights acquired, if any, by the applicant was subject to the outcome of the\npending suit. This suit has been decreed in favour of the DH, Veena\nMahajan and her rights have crystallized into a superior title and Ms.\nKamlesh Gupta cannot claim any right title merely on the basis of an\nAgreement to Sell. Ms. Kamlesh Gupta could not have transferred any\ntitle better than what she had in favour of the Objectors. Thus, even if she\nexecuted an Agreement to Sell, Will, Special Power of Attorney, General\nPower of Attorney and Receipt all dated 26th November, 1990 in favour of\nthe Objectors, their rights were not only hit by the doctrine of lis pendens,\nbut also were subject to the decree which has been given in favour of the\nDH Veena Mahajan.\n\n47. The Objectors do not have any valid independent right title in the\nproperty and thus, their objections are without merit and have no right to\nseek protection of their possession.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 16 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nProtection of possession under\nSection 53A\nof the Transfer of\nProperty Act, 1882:\n\n48. The Objectors may have been put in possession pursuant to the\nAgreement to Sell dated 26.11.1990 by Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, but the other\naspect is whether they can seek any protection under\nSection 53A\nof\nTPA, 1882.\n\n49. The essential conditions which are required to be fulfilled if a\ntransferee wants to defend or protect his possession under\nSection 53A\nof\nthe TPA, 1882 have been explained by the Apex Court in\nShrimant\nShamrao Suryavanshi vs. Pralhad Bhairoba Suryavanshi\n(2002) 3 SCC\n676 which are:\n\n\"1. There must be a contract to transfer for consideration of any\nimmovable property;\n\n2. The contract must be in writing, signed by the transferor, or by\nsomeone on his behalf;\n\n3. The writing must be in such words from which the terms\nnecessary to construe the transfer can be ascertained;\n\n4. The transferee must in part-performance of the contract take\npossession of the property, or of any part thereof;\n\n5. The transferee must have done some act in furtherance of the\ncontract;\n\n6. The transferee must have performed or be willing to perform his\npart of the contract.\"\n\n50. If these conditions are fulfilled, then the equitable doctrine of\npart-performance provided under\nSection 53A\nof TPA, 1882 comes into\nplay in favour of the proposed Transferee who can protect his possession\nagainst the proposed transferor, even though the Registered Deed\nconveying the title is not executed by the proposed Transferor. The\nprotection provided under\nSection 53A\nof TPA, 1882 is only against the\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 17 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nTransferor. It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the possession of\nthe proposed Transferee who is put in possession in pursuance of such an\nAgreement to Sell.\n\n51.\nIn\nState of U.P. vs. District Judge & Ors.\n1997 (1) SCC 496, it was\nobserved that the protection is available under the TPA, 1882 as a shield\nonly against the transferor and the proposed vendor who is disentitled\nfrom disturbing the possession of the proposed Transferees who are put in\npossession pursuant to such Agreement. But this has nothing to do with\nthe ownership of the proposed Transferor who remains the full owner of\nthe said land till it is legally conveyed by Sale Deed to the proposed\nTransferees. It was further observed that\nSection 53A\nof TPA, 1882 is\nmerely to protect the possession of the proposed vendee and may entitle\nhim to protection of the possession which they have acquired pursuant to\nan Agreement to Sell but such a right cannot be pressed against a third\nparty.\n\n52. The pertinent question which arises in the facts of this case is\nwhether the doctrine of part-performance can be availed by the Objectors\nwith whom the judgement debtor has never entered into an Agreement of\nSale.\nIn\nRambhau Namdeo Gajre vs. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra\n(2004)8\nSCC 614, similar facts as in hand came up for consideration. The owner\nexecuted an Agreement to Sell with one Pishorrilal who also took\npossession in part-performance thereof. Sale deed had never been\nexecuted. Within a period of two and a half months, the Pishorilal\nexecuted a similar agreement of sale in favour of the appellant and put\nthem in possession of the suit land. Pishorrilal who merely had an\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 18 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nAgreement to Sell in his favour, had no ownership right and thus was held\nto have no right to enter into an Agreement to Sell with the appellants.\n\n53. In the present facts as well the owner had executed an Agreement to\nSell in favour of one Ms. Kamlesh Gupta who in turn executed another\nAgreement to Sell in favour of the present Objectors vide Agreement to\nSell dated 26th November, 1990, and also put them in possession. Ms.\nKamlesh Gupta being merely having an Agreement to Sell was not the\nowner and could not have possibly entered into the Agreement to Sell in\nrespect of the suit property with the present Objectors.\n\n54.\nIn\nRambhau Namdeo Gajre\n(supra), it was observed that an\nAgreement to Sell does not create any interest of the proposed vendee in\nthe suit property. As per\nSection 54\nof TPA, 1882 the title in immovable\nproperty valued at more than Rs. 100 can be conveyed only by executing a\nregistered sale deed. This Section specifically provides that a contract for\nsale of immovable property is a contract evidencing the fact that the sale\nof such property shall take place on the terms settled between the parties\nbut does not by itself create any interest in or charge on such property.\nUnless a registered document of sale is executed pursuant to the\nAgreement to Sell in favour of the proposed transferee, the title of the suit\nland continues to vest in the original owner and the property remains in\nhis ownership. The doctrine of part performance can be availed by the\nproposed transferee against the Transferor or any person claiming under\nhim and not against the third party with whom he does not have any\nprivity of contract.\n\n55. The Scope of Agreement to Sell and the right, title and interest\nwhich are created under an Agreement to Sell was explained by the Apex\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 19 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nCourt in Suraj lamp and Industries private limited vs. State of Haryana\n(2012) 1 SCC 656. It was held that the Agreement to Sell coupled with\nother documents namely Special Power of Attorney, General Power of\nAttorney are not transactions of transfer or sale and cannot be treated as a\ncomplete sale or conveyance. They may continue to be treated as existing\nAgreement to Sell and nothing prevents the affected parties from getting\nregistered deeds of conveyance to complete their title. These documents\nmay even be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession\nunder\nSection 53A\nof the TPA, 1882 or may also be used to apply for\nregularization of allotments/leases by development authorities. However,\nthe Agreement to Sell independently continues to be only an agreement\nand does not create any valid transfer of ownership in the suit property.\n\n56.\nIn\nRekha Nankani vs. Kulwant Singh Sachdeva and Ors.\n(2009) 107\nDRJ 282, this Court observed that if a property was bound by the\nAgreement of the owner/vendor, then merely because the vendor had\ntransferred the property, the transferee shall not acquire rights better than\nthat of the vendor and shall be subject to the liability of the vendor.\n\nSimilar observations were made by the High Court of Allahabad in Smt.\nRam Peary (supra).\n\n57. Therefore, in view of the law as laid down in the afore-discussed\ncase law, it may be concluded that the Objectors are not entitled to any\nprotection of their possession under\nSection 53-A\nof TPA, 1882.\nAlleged Fraud and Collusion between the Decree Holder and the\nJudgement Debtor:\n\n58. A plea has been set up by the Objectors that the Judgement and\nDecree dated 29th April, 1988 is not executable as it has been obtained by\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 20 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nfraud and collusion between the decree holder and the judgement debtor\nwith the view to cause prejudice to the interest of Kamlesh Gupta in the\nproperty in question, who was having enforceable rights against the\nproperty in view of the Agreement to Sell dated 21st January, 1988 having\nbeen executed in her favour and she being put in physical possession of\nthe property in question.\n\n59. Though a plea of fraud has been taken on behalf of the applicant,\nbut aside from claiming a fraud and collusion between the decree holder\nand the judgement debtor, no further facts have been disclosed from\nwhere any inference of there being fraud and collusion can be inferred. In\nfact, the Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 executed in favour\nof the DH, Ms. Veena Mahajan was prior to the Agreement to Sell dated\n21st January, 1988 executed in favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta. No fraud or\ncollusion has been even prima facie disclosed by the applicant in its\nobjections.\n\n60. Moreover, the JD had filed an appeal by way of RFA (OS) 86/1998\nchallenging the Decree in favour of the DH which was dismissed on\nmerits on18th January, 2012.The conduct of the JD also does not reflect\nany collusion with the DH.\n\nCancellation of earlier Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986:\n\n61. The Objectors have further asserted their right over the suit\nproperty by claiming that there is no finding in the judgement that the JD\nhad entered into an Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta only after\ncancellation of the Agreement with the DH in respect of the suit premises.\nIn the absence of any such determination of the controversy about the\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 21 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nAgreement to Sell in favour of DH having been cancelled by the JD\nbefore entering into Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, the\nDecree of Specific Performance could not have been passed against the\nJD.\n\n62. This argument is completely fallacious because all the aspects\nsurrounding the Agreement to Sell had been specifically considered while\nallowing the decree of specific performance in favour of the DH. The\naspect of cancellation of the Agreement to Sell in favour of the DH was\nspecifically considered in the judgement dated 29th April, 1998. This\naspect of cancellation of the Agreement to Sell in favour of decree holder\nwas also specifically considered in RFA (OS) 86/1998 and the same was\nnegated. Moreover, it is not within the scope of the Objectors to challenge\nthe Decree dated 29th April, 1988 itself, which has already attained\nfinality.\n\nBona fide Purchase: Not Aware of the previous Agreement to Sell in\nfavour of DH:\n\n63. The Objectors have set up a defence that they were not aware of the\nSale Agreement between the DH and the JD.\nSection 19\nof the Specific\nRelief Act, 1963 provides for the relief to the parties claiming under them\nby subsequent title. It reads as under:\n\n\"\nSection 19\n:\n\nExcept as otherwise provided by this Chapter, specific\nperformance of a contract may be enforced against--\n\n(a) either party thereto;\n\n(b) any other person claiming under him by a title arising\nsubsequently to the contract, except a transferee for value\nwho has paid his money in good faith and without notice of\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 22 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nthe original contract;\n\n(c) any person claiming under a title which, though prior to\nthe contract and known to the plaintiff, might have been\ndisplaced by the defendant;\n\n(d) when a company has entered into a contract and\nsubsequently becomes amalgamated with another company,\nthe new company which arises out of the amalgamation;\n\n(e) when the promoters of a company have, before its\nincorporation, entered into a contract for the purpose of the\ncompany and such contract is warranted by the terms of the\nincorporation, the company: Provided that the company has\naccepted the contract and communicated such acceptance to\nthe other party to the contract.\"\n\n64. Lord Buckmaster speaking for a five judge bench in\nMt. Fatima\nBibi vs. Saadat Ali\n, AIR (1930) Privy Council while interpreting a\nparimateria provision of\nSection 27 (b)\nof the old\nSpecific Relief Act\nheld\nthat even though the title may be subsequent to the Agreement to Sell of\nwhich specific performance is claimed, but if that title was in pursuance to\nan Agreement of a date earlier to the date of the Agreement of which\nspecific performance was claimed, then the plaintiff is not entitled to the\nrelief of specific performance.\n\n65.\nIn\nR.K. Mohammed Ubaidullah & Ors. vs. Hajee C. Abdul Wahab\n(D) Ors.\n(2000) 6 SCC 402, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that the\nperson who purchases the property should have made necessary effort to\nfind out whether the title or interest of the person from whom he is\nmaking purchase of the property was in actual possession of such\nproperty. Considering the effect of\nSection 19\nof the Specific Relief Act,\n1963, and\nSection 52\nof TPA, 1882, it was held that subsequent\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 23 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\npurchasers have to be fairly informed before he purchases the suit\nproperty.\n\n66. Similar facts as in hand came for consideration in\nGuruswamy\nNadar vs P. Lakshmi Ammal\n(2008)5 SCC 796, wherein the during the\npendency of a suit for specific performance, the owner sold the property\nto another person and the contention of bonafide purchaser was examined.\nIt was held that the defence of bonafide purchase is not applicable during\nlis pendens.\n\n67. This plea of being unaware of the prior Agreement to Sell or of\nbona fide purchase does not come to the rescue of the Objectors.\nNo Relief of possession is claimed:\n\n68. The Objectors have taken the ground that the decree in the present\nsuit was for the Specific Performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 14th\nFebruary, 1986 in respect of the suit property in favour of the DH. The\nfundamental question which has arisen is whether the DH can claim\npossession when the JD himself was not in physical possession thereof. In\naddition to this, no relief with respect to delivery of possession was\ngranted even though it was one of the reliefs sought in the Suit. The DH\nis, therefore, not entitled to seek possession.\n\n69. There has been a divergence of opinion in various judgements as to\nwhether the possession can be delivered while executing a Decree for\nSpecific Performance, when no relief of possession is sought. To obviate\nthe confusion, the Law Commission in its 9 th Report submitted on 19th\nJuly, 1958 recommended introduction of\nSection 22\nof the Specific Relief\nAct, 1963 which provided that no relief in a Suit for Specific Performance\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 24 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nmay be granted unless it is specifically claimed.\nSection 22\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963 was thus introduced which reads as under:\n\n―\nSection 22\n. Power to grant relief for possession, partition,\nrefund of earnest money, etc.--(1) Notwithstanding anything to\nthe contrary contained in\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 (5 of\n1908), any person suing for the specific performance of a contract\nfor the transfer of immovable property may, in an appropriate\ncase, ask for--\n\n(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the\nproperty, in addition to such performance; or\n\n(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the\nrefund of any earnest money or deposit paid or made by him, in\ncase his claim for specific performance is refused.\n(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall\nbe granted by the court unless it has been specifically claimed:\n\nProvided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in\nthe plaint, the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow\nhim to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including\na claim for such relief.\n\n(3) The power of the court to grant relief under clause (b) of\nsubsection (1) shall be without prejudice to its powers to award\ncompensation under\nSection 21\n.\"\n\n70. There is no doubt that no specific relief of possession has been\ngranted despite a prayer being made for the same. This aspect was\nconsidered by the Madras High Court in\nS.S Rajabather vs. N.A. Sayeed\n\nAIR 1974 Mad 289, held that if the relief of Specific Performance of a\nContract for Sale was granted by a Decree, everything which was\nnecessary for the contract to be specifically performed, can be ordered and\ninformed in the execution.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 25 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n71.\nIn\nGyasa vs. Smt. Risalo\nAIR 1977 Allahabad 156, Allahabad High\ncourt held that it was not always incumbent on the plaintiff to claim\npossession of partition or separate possession in a suit for specific\nperformance of the contract for the transfer of immovable property. This\nis to be done where the circumstances so demand. The relief of specific\nperformance of the contract of sale embraces within its ambit not only\nexecution of sale deed but also possession of the property which is the\nsubject matter of the sale deed.\n\nSimilar observations were made in\n\nNarayana Pillai Krishna Pillai vs. Ponnuswami ChettiarSubbalekshmi\nAmmal\nAIR 1978 Kerala 236; by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High\nCourt in\nDebabrata Tarafder vs. Biraj Mohan Bardhan\nAIR 1983\nCalcutta 51, Sm. Dhiraj BalaKaria Vs. Jethia Estate Pvt. Ltd 1982 SCC\nOnLine Cal 152.\n\n72. A similar situation, as in hand, was discussed by the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in\nBabu Lal vs. Hazari Lal Kishori Lal & Ors.\n(1982) 1 SCC 525,\nwherein it was observed that the expression \"in an appropriate case\"\n\nappearing in Sub-Section (1) of\nSection 22\nof the Act implies that a relief\nof possession has to be sought against the third person as he is not bound\nby the Contract to be enforced. The Hon'ble Apex Court further observed\nthat the relief of possession can be granted to the Decree Holder where the\nproperty is agreed to be conveyed by virtue of an Agreement to Sell. The\nargument that the plaintiff must claim possession in a Suit for Specific\nPerformance of a Contract in all cases was also negated as\nSection 22\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963 talks of relief of possession in appropriate\ncases.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 26 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\n73. Supreme Court in\nS. Sampoornam Vs. P.V. Kuppuswamy\n2007 SCC\nOnLine Mad 365 reiterated the same principle and held that even in the\nabsence of prayer for possession, once the suit for specific performance is\ndecreed, the court has got every power to order delivery of possession as\nper the proviso to\nSection 22 (2)\nof the specific Relief Act.\n\n74. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nManickam Thandapani & Anr. vs.\nVasantha\n2022 Live Law (SC) 395 referred to the aforementioned\njudgements and emphasized that the phrase \"in an appropriate case\"\n\nstated in Sub-\nSection 1\nof\nSection 22\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 does\nnot mandatorily require that possession has to be claimed and granted in\nevery Suit for Specific Performance of Agreement to Sell. It is only\nwhere the plaintiff/third party acquires the title to the property alone in the\nSuit for Specific Performance and his claim for possession/partition is\nbased on independent rights, then in such case, the delivery of possession\ncannot be granted to the Decree Holder merely on execution of Sale Deed\nwhich is in consonance with\nSection 55(1)\nof Transfer of Property Act,\n1882. However, in cases where the Agreement to Sell itself envisages the\nhanding over of the possession to the Decree Holder, then it may not be\nnecessary for the Decree Holder to have specifically claimed possession\nover the property as provided in\nSection 22 (1)\nof the Specific Relief Act,\n1963. It was thus concluded that though\nSection 22 (2)\nof the Act, which\nis in negative language, states that \"no relief under clause (a) or clause\n\n(b) of Sub-Section (1) shall be granted by the court unless it has been\nspecifically claimed\", but the proviso thereto takes out the mandatory\nnature from the substantive provision and allows the plaintiff to amend the\nplaint \"at any stage of the proceeding\". The Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nEX.P. 282/2012 Page 27 of 28\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:PRIYANKA ANEJA\n\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n\n17:18:48\n\n2023/DHC/000740\n\nexplained that any \"stage of proceeding\" would include the proceedings\nin Suit, in appeal and also in execution. The proviso to\nSection 22(2)\n\nmakes the provision directory with no penal consequences.\nSection 22(2)\n\nof the Act only contains the rule of prudence to ask for possession \"in an\nappropriate case\". It cannot be said that it is a mandatory provision or\nthat the relief of possession cannot be granted in a Decree for Specific\nPerformance in the absence of there being a specific relief so granted.\n\n75. It may be thus concluded that even though the relief for possession\nhad not been granted in the Decree, but it is inherent in the Decree for\nSpecific Performance of the Agreement to Sell. The decree holder is,\ntherefore, entitled to the relief of possession.\n\n76. It is thus concluded that there is no merit in the present application\nunder\nSection 47\nof CPC, 1908 filed by the applicants, Ms. Meera Rani\nGupta and Ms. Nalini Gupta and the same is accordingly dismissed.\n\nEX.P. 282/2012& EX.
