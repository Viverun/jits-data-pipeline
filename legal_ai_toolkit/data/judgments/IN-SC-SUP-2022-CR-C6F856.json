In this batch of cases which emanates from Uttar Pradesh, five hundred and twelve\n\nconvicts who are undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for life seek premature\n\nrelease.\n2. On 1 August 2018, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a policy governing\n\npremature release of convicts with the approval of the Governor under\nArticle 161\n\nof the Constitution. The policy is described as a “Standing Policy regarding\n\npremature release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment on the occasion of\n\nevery Republic Day (26th January)”. The policy sets out categories of convicts\n\nentitled to premature release. Among those categories is para 2(b). The translation\n\nprovided by the Additional Advocate General is extracted below:\n\n“2(b). All male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life whose\ncrime is not covered by any of the sub-rule under prohibited category\ndefined in para-3 below and who have undergone, including undertrial\ncustody, sentence of 16 years without remission and 20 years with\nremission.”\n\n3. ‘Prohibited categories’ are spelt out in para 3 of the policy. Clause (vi) of the\n\nprohibited categories is set out below:\n\n“(vi) All such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life who\nhave been convicted for the crimes related to incidents of massacre\n(three or more than three murders).”\n\n4. Para 4 of the policy provided as follows:\n\n“4. All Senior Superintendent/Superintendent/ Superintendent In charge\nshall examine the eligibility of all such convicted prisoners sentenced\nto imprisonment for life detained in jails in terms of the prescribed\npolicy/directions contained in the aforesaid paras and shall make\navailable in the prescribed proforma enclosed herewith the proposal\nof premature release of all eligible prisoners to Zonal Deputy\nInspector General of Prisons by 31st October every year.”\n\n5. Each Zonal Deputy Inspector General of Prisons was required to examine all\nproposals in light of the policy so as to ensure that no eligible person is left out of\n\nconsideration. Each Zonal DIG had to submit the proposal to the Inspector General\n\nof Prisons annually by 15 November. The Inspector General of Prisons was further\n\nrequired to forward the proposal to the Government annually by 30 November. A\n\nCommittee was constituted in terms of para 8 of the policy for examining and\n\ndisposing all cases upon the receipt of the proposal. The Committee was required\n\nto submit its recommendations for premature release of convicted prisoners\n\nsentenced to imprisonment for life to the Government annually by 15 December\n\non which the Government was to take a decision in terms of the prescribed\n\nprocedure.\n\n6. On 28 July 2021, an amendment was brought about to the policy. Para 2(b) of the\n\nearlier policy document dated 1 August 2018 was modified so as to provide that a\n\nconvict undergoing imprisonment for life would not be released until the age of\n\nsixty years is attained. Para 2(b) as amended on 28 July 2021 was in the following\n\nterms:\n\n“2(b) Such male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and\nare incarcerated in prison, whose crime is not covered by any of the\nsub-rule under prohibited category defined in para-3 below and who\nhave completed age of 60 years and have undergone, including\nundertrial custody, sentence of 16 years without remission and 20\nyears with remission.”\n\n7. However, convicts falling within the prohibited category set out in para 3(vi) of the\n\noriginal policy document were granted a relaxation in the amended policy dated\n\n28 July 2021. Para 2(g) of the amended policy dated 28 July 2021 is as follows:\n“2(g) Such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and are\nincarcerated in prison, whose crime is covered by the sections\nmentioned in prohibited category in sub-rule-(vi), (viii) and (ix) of para-\n3 below, and who have completed age of 60 years and have\nundergone, including undertrial custody, sentence of 25 years without\nremission and 30 years with remission.”\n\n8. The imposition of the requirement that a convict undergoing imprisonment for life\n\nwould not be eligible for premature release until attaining the age of sixty years led\n\nto the institution of petitions under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution before this Court.\n\nThe challenge was inter alia on the ground that the plea for premature release\n\nmust be considered on the basis of the law as it stood on the date of conviction\n\nand that a subsequent policy which operates to restrict the ambit of a policy\n\nprevailing on the date of conviction must not be allowed to obstruct the plea for\n\nrelease. Moreover, it was urged that the requirement that a convict cannot be\n\nconsidered for premature release before the age of sixty would violate the right to\n\nlife under\nArticle 21\nby subjecting a convict to long years of incarceration.\nIn several\n\njudgments of this Court, including\nState of Haryana v Jagdish,1\nit has been held\n\nthat an application for premature release has to be considered on the basis of the\n\npolicy as it stood on the date when the accused was convicted of the offence by\n\nthe trial court.\nA similar view was taken in State of Haryana v Raj Kumar @ Bitu.2\n\n9. Subsequently, on 27 May 2022, the policy dated 1 August 2018 (as amended on\n\n28 July 2021) was further amended. The amendments are specific to paras 1, 2(b),\n\n2(f) and 2(g) and by the insertion of para 12 in the policy dated 1 August 2018, as\n\n1 (2010) 4 SCC 216\n2 (2021) 9 SCC 292\namended. For the present purpose, it would suffice to note that the requirement\n\nthat a convict undergoing life imprisonment could be considered for release only\n\nafter attaining the age of sixty has been deleted. The amended clause in terms of\n\nthe amendment dated 27 May 2022 reads as follows:\n\n“2(b) All such male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life\nand are incarcerated in prison, whose crime is not covered by any of\nthe sub-rule under prohibited category defined in para-3 below and\nwho have undergone, including undertrial custody, sentence of 16\nyears excluding remission and 20 years including remission.”\n\n10. Moreover, as regards prisoners who fall in the prohibited category contained in\n\npara 3(vi), the relevant clause reads as follows:\n\n“2(g) All such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and\nare incarcerated in prison, whose crime is covered by the sections\nmentioned in prohibited category in sub-rule–(vi), (viii) and (ix) of\npara-3 below, and who have undergone, including undertrial custody,\nsentence of 25 years with excluding remission and 30 years including\nremission.”\n\n11. Following the amendment, counter affidavits were filed before this Court in several\n\npending proceedings, including among them the following:\n\n(\ni) Dev Nath Singh v State of U P\n;3\n\n(\nii) Rajkumar v The State of Uttar Pradesh\n;4 and\n\n(iii) Brij Bhushan v The State of Uttar Pradesh.5\n\n3 Writ Petition (Crl) No 528 of 2021 decided on 21 February 2022\n4 Writ Petition (Crl) No 36 of 2022 decided on 11 March 2022\n5 Writ Petition (Crl) No 75 of 2022 decided on 14 March 2022\n12. The orders of this court in above petitions under\nArticle 32\nnoted that the cases of\n\nthe convicts undergoing life imprisonment would be dealt with in accordance with\n\nthe policy as it existed prior to the amendment which was brought about on 28 July\n\n2021.\n\n13. In order to facilitate the disposal of this batch of cases, an order was passed by\n\nthis Court on 24 August 2022 requiring a tabulated statement to be prepared\n\ndealing with:\n\n(i) The offence for which the petitioners were convicted;\n\n(ii) The date of the judgment of the trial court;\n\n(iii) The year of the filing of the criminal appeal before the High Court;\n\n(iv) The period of imprisonment undergone:\n\n(a) Without remission; and\n\n(b) With remission;\n\n(v) Whether the petitioners are on bail; and\n\n(vi) The current status of the application for premature release.\n\n14. Such a statement has been shared by counsel for the petitioners and has been\n\nshared with Ms Garima Prashad, AAG appearing on behalf of the State of Uttar\n\nPradesh. The AAG has facilitated a due verification and submitted a statement\n\ncontaining the details of 512 prisoners covered by the present batch of cases,\n\nwhose cases would require to be considered in terms of the policy. The statement\n\nis annexed to this order.6\n\n6 Annexure-A\n15. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners in the\n\nproceedings under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution and Ms Garima Prashad, AAG.\n\n16. The implementation of the policy for premature release has to be carried out in an\n\nobjective and transparent manner as otherwise it would impinge on the\n\nconstitutional guarantees under\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nMany of these life convicts who\n\nhave suffered long years of incarceration have few or no resources. Lack of\n\nliteracy, education and social support structures impede their right to access legal\n\nremedies. Once the state has formulated its policy defining the terms for premature\n\nrelease, due consideration in terms of the policy must be given to all eligible\n\nconvicts. The constitutional guarantees against arbitrary treatment and of the right\n\nto secure life and personal liberty must not be foreclosed by an unfair process of\n\nconsidering applications for premature release in terms of the policy.\n\n17. Significantly, the policy has been amended to remove the requirement of convicts\n\nsubmitting an application for premature release and instead places the\n\nresponsibility on the officers of the state to consider eligible prisoners. The prison\n\nadministration, legal services authorities at the district and state level and officers\n\nof the police department and the state must diligently ensure that cases of eligible\n\nprisoners are considered on the basis of policy parameters. We have gained a\n\ndistinct impression, based on the cases which have come before the court here\n\nand even earlier that there is a general apathy towards ensuring that the rights\n\nwhich have been made available to convicts who have served out their sentences\n\nin terms of the policy are realized. This results in the deprivation of liberty of those\nwho are entitled to be released. They languish in overcrowded jails. Their poverty,\n\nilliteracy and disabilities occasioned by long years of incarceration are\n\ncompounded by the absence of supportive social and legal structures. The\n\npromise of equality in our Constitution would not be fulfilled if liberty were to be\n\nconditional on an individual’s resources, which unfortunately many of these cases\n\nprovide hard evidence of. This situation must change and hence this court has had\n\nto step in. We now proceed to formulate peremptory directions.\n\n18. We direct that:\n\n(i) All cases for premature release of convicts undergoing imprisonment for life\n\nin the present batch of cases shall be considered in terms of the policy dated\n\n1 August 2018, as amended, subject to the observations which are\n\ncontained herein. The restriction that a life convict is not eligible for\n\npremature release until attaining the age of sixty years, which was\n\nintroduced by the policy of 28 July 2021, stands deleted by the amendment\n\ndated 27 May 2022. Hence, no case for premature release shall be rejected\n\non that ground;\n\n(ii) In the event that any convict is entitled to more liberal benefits by any of the\n\namendments which have been brought about subsequent to the policy dated\n\n1 August 2018, the case for the grant of premature release would be\n\nconsidered by granting benefit in terms of more liberal amended para/clause\n\nof the policies. All decisions of premature release of convicts, including\n\nthose, beyond the present batch of cases would be entitled to such a\nbeneficial reading of the policy;\n\n(iii) In terms of para 4 of the policy dated 1 August 2018, no application is\n\nrequired to be submitted by a convict undergoing life imprisonment for\n\npremature release. Further, through amendment dated 28 July 2021, para\n\n3(i), which included convicts undergoing life imprisonment who have not filed\n\napplication for pre-mature release in the prohibited category, has specifically\n\nbeen deleted. Accordingly, all cases of convicts undergoing life sentence in\n\nthe State of Uttar Pradesh who are eligible for being considered for\n\npremature release in terms of the policy, including but not confined to the\n\nfive hundred and twelve prisoners involved in the present batch of cases,\n\nshall be considered in terms of the procedure for premature release\n\nstipulated in the policy;\n\n(iv) The District Legal Services Authorities in the State of Uttar Pradesh shall\n\ntake necessary steps in coordination with the jail authorities to ensure that\n\nall eligible cases of prisoners who would be entitled to premature release in\n\nterms of the applicable policies, as noticed above, would be duly considered\n\nand no prisoner, who is otherwise eligible for being considered, shall be\n\nexcluded from consideration.\n\n(v) These steps to be taken by DLSAs would, include but not be limited to,\n\nSecretaries of DLSAs seeking status report on all prisoners undergoing life\n\nimprisonment in the prisons falling under their jurisdiction in terms of the\n\nformat of table prepared in Annexure-A covering the details mentioned in\npara 13 of this judgment and ensuring its submission by relevant authorities\n\nwithin eight weeks of this order as well as on an annual basis. Further,\n\nDLSAs would utilize this status report to monitor and engage with respective\n\nauthorities to ensure the implementation of our directions to ensure\n\npremature release in terms of applicable policies in all eligible cases of\n\nconvicts undergoing life sentence on a continuous basis;\n\n(vi) The applications for premature release shall be considered expeditiously.\n\nThose cases which have already been processed and in respect of which\n\nreports have been submitted shall be concluded and final decisions\n\nintimated to the convict no later than within a period of one month from the\n\ndate of this order. Cases of eligible life convicts who are (i) above the age of\n\nseventy years; or (ii) suffering from terminal ailments shall be taken up on\n\npriority and would be disposed of within a period of two months. The Uttar\n\nPradesh State Legal Services Authority shall, within a period of two weeks,\n\nlay down the priorities according to which all other pending cases shall be\n\ndisposed of. All other cases shall, in any event, be disposed of within a\n\nperiod of four months from the date of this order; and\n\n(vii) Where any convict undergoing life imprisonment has already been released\n\non bail by the orders of this Court, the order granting interim bail shall\n\ncontinue to remain in operation until the disposal of the application for\n\npremature release.\n19. The petitions are accordingly disposed of. A copy of the present judgment shall be\n\ntransmitted also to the Secretary of the UP State Legal Services Authority.\n\n20. In view of the disposal of the petitions, pending applications stand disposed of.\n\n…..…..…....…........……………….…........J.\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\n…..…..…....…........……………….…........J.\n[Hima Kohli]\nNew Delhi;\n\nSeptember 06, 2022\n\n-S-\n\nAnnexure- A\nSr. Item Cause Title Name of Prisoner ST/Cr.
