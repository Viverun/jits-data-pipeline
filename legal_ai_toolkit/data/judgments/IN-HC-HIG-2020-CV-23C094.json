The question that arises for consideration in these\n\nwrit petitions is, as to whether the contesting respondents\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n3 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\n(respondent No.2 in both the writ petitions) are entitled to\n\npayment of gratuity under the provisions of\nPayment of Gratuity\n\nAct, 1972\n(hereinafter referred to as the 'Act of 1972') or under\n\nthe Vidarbha Gramin Bank, Officers and Employees Service\n\nRegulations, 2013, issued by the Board of Directors of the said\n\nBank under\nsection 30\nof the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976.\n\nWhile the petitioner Bank claims that the contesting respondents\n\nare entitled to payment of gratuity under the provisions of the Act\n\nof 1972 with an upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-, the contesting\n\nrespondents have claimed that they are entitled to gratuity under\n\nthe said Regulations without any such ceiling. The contesting\n\nrespondents further claim that even under the said Regulations,\n\nfor calculating the amount of gratuity payable, dearness allowance\n\nand other allowances are required to be included in the expression\n\n\"Pay\" as defined in the said Regulations.\n\n3. The brief facts leading to filing of the present writ\n\npetitions by the petitioner Bank are that the contesting\n\nrespondents retired as Senior Managers from the petitioner Bank\n\non 31/05/2017. Respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018\n\nhad completed 33 years before superannuation and respondent\n\nNo.2 in Writ Petition No.8273/2018 had completed 29 years of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n4 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nservice. The petitioner Bank calculated the amount of gratuity\n\npayable to the said respondents on the basis of the provisions of\n\nthe Act, 1971 and also in accordance with the said Regulations.\n\nThe petitioner Bank found that the amount of gratuity payable to\n\nthe said respondents as per the Act of 1972 came to a higher\n\nfigure of Rs.10,00,000/- and therefore, the said amount was\n\ndisbursed to the respondents upon their attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation.\n\n4. The contesting respondents sent applications to the\n\npetitioner Bank after having received the amount of\n\nRs.10,00,000/- each towards gratuity, claiming that the cap or\n\nupper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/- under the provisions of the Act of\n\n1972, was wrongly applied in their cases, because they were\n\nentitled to gratuity in terms of Regulation 72 of the said\n\nRegulations. The said Regulation specifically provided that an\n\nofficer or an employee of the petitioner Bank shall be eligible for\n\npayment of gratuity either under the Act of 1972 or Regulations,\n\nwhichever was higher. It was submitted that therefore, the\n\npetitioner Bank ought to have paid total amount of gratuity\n\nwithout applying the upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-, as provided\n\nunder the Act of 1972.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n5 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\n5. As the petitioner Bank refused to accept the claims\n\nmade by the said respondents, they filed applications under\n\nsection 7(4)\nof the Act of 1972, for direction to the petitioner bank\n\nto make payment of the balance amount due to them. In the case\n\nof respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, demand of\n\nfurther amount of Rs.5,61,472.16, was made and in case of\n\nrespondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8273/2018, claim of further\n\namount of Rs.3,37,261.78, was made before the Controlling\n\nAuthority under the Act of 1972 i.e. Assistant Labour\n\nCommissioner.\n\n6. By orders passed on 28/03/2018, the Controlling\n\nAuthority rejected the applications filed by the contesting\n\nrespondents, holding that the petitioner Bank had correctly\n\napplied provisions of the Act of 1972, thereby disbursing an\n\namount of Rs.10,00,000/- each, towards gratuity in favour of the\n\nsaid respondents. It was held that the said respondents were not\n\neligible for the additional amount of gratuity claimed by them.\n\n7. Aggrieved by the said orders passed by the\n\nControlling Authority, the contesting respondents filed appeals\n\nbefore the Appellate Authority i.e. Deputy Chief Labour\n\nCommissioner. By orders dated 04/10/2018, the Appellate\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n6 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nAuthority allowed the appeals filed by the contesting respondents\n\nand directed the petitioner bank to pay the additional amount of\n\ngratuity claimed by them alongwith interest @10% per annum for\n\ndelayed period till the date of actual payment. The petitioner\n\nbank filed instant writ petitions challenging the said orders passed\n\nby the Appellate Authority.\n\n8. Mr. Anand Jaiswal, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner Bank in both the writ petitions\n\nsubmitted that the Appellate Authority failed to appreciate the real\n\ncontroversy in the present case. It was submitted that Regulation\n\n72 of the said Regulations clearly specified that an officer or\n\nemployee would be entitled to gratuity as per the provisions of the\n\nAct of 1972 or the said Regulations, whichever is higher.\n\nAccording to the learned senior counsel, calculation of gratuity\n\npayable to the contesting respondents was undertaken by the\n\npetitioner Bank under both the Act of 1972, as well as the said\n\nRegulations. It was submitted that the amount payable to the\n\ncontesting respondents under the Regulations came to a figure\n\nwhich was less than the amount payable to them under the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1972. It was pointed out that as per the\n\naforesaid Regulation 72 of the said Regulations, the gratuity\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n7 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\npayable to the respondents was to be calculated on their last pay\n\ndrawn, which as per the definitions in the Regulations did not\n\ninclude the component of dearness allowance, while under the\n\nprovisions of Act of 1972, the last drawn wage of the respondents\n\nincluded the last pay and dearness allowance.\n\n9. It was submitted that therefore, the petitioner bank\n\nhad calculated the amount of gratuity payable to the contesting\n\nrespondents under the Act of 1972 and in the case of respondent\n\nNo.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, it came to Rs.15,61,472.16\n\nand in the case of respondent No.2 in Writ Petition\n\nNo.8273/2018, it came to Rs.13,37,261.78. It was further\n\nsubmitted that since at the relevant time the amount of gratuity\n\npayable to an employee under\nsection 4(3)\nof the Act of 1972,\n\ncould not exceed Rs.10,00,000/-, the said amount was paid to the\n\ncontesting respondents. On this basis, it was pointed out that the\n\nhigher amount of gratuity payable to the contesting respondents\n\nwas disbursed to them, because on a proper application of the\n\nRegulations, respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, was\n\nentitled to gratuity amount of Rs.8,93,920/- and respondent No.2\n\nin Writ Petition No.8273/2018 was entitled to gratuity amount of\n\nRs.7,61,740/-. On this basis, it was submitted that the appellate\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n8 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nCourt had committed a grave error in passing the impugned\n\norders in favour of the contesting respondents.\n\n10. On the other hand, Mr. R. M. Tahaliyani, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for respondent No.2 in both the writ petitions\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner Bank had wrongly calculated amount\n\nof gratuity payable to the said contesting respondents under the\n\naforesaid Regulations by refusing to include the component of\n\ndearness allowance in the last pay drawn by the respondents. It\n\nwas submitted that a perusal of the said Regulations would show\n\nthat dearness allowance could not have been excluded by the\n\npetitioner bank, while calculating the amount of gratuity payable\n\nto the contesting respondents. It was submitted that inclusion of\n\ndearness allowance in \"pay\" as defined under\nRegulation 2(m)\nof\n\nthe Regulations would show that the respondents were clearly\n\nentitled to the higher amounts which they had claimed and since\n\nthere was no upper ceiling or cap to the amount payable under the\n\nRegulations, the Appellate Authority had correctly directed\n\npayment of the additional amounts to the respondents alongwith\n\ninterest.\n\n11. The learned counsel for the contesting respondents\n\nplaced reliance on judgment of the learned Single Judge of the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n9 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court in the case of\nAll India Gramin\n\nPensioners Organization Unit Rewa vs. Madhyanchal Gramin\n\nBank and another\n[ W. P. 9182/2017 with W. P. 2299/2017 and\n\nW. P. 2877/2018 decided on 06/09/2018 ] and Division Bench of\n\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of\nMadhyanchal\n\nGramin Bank and another vs. All India Gramin Pensioners\n\nOrganization Unit [W.A.1318/2018\nwith W.A. Nos. 1316 and\n\n1317/2018 decided on 26/02/2019], wherein pari materia\n\nprovisions to the said Regulations were considered and it was\n\nfound by the High Court that the expression \"pay\" under the\n\nRegulations included dearness allowance. It was further held in\n\nthe said judgment\nthat since there was no upper ceiling for the\n\namount of gratuity payable to the employees of the Bank under\n\nRegulation 72, the higher amount payable was to be disbursed.\n\nThe learned counsel pointed out that Special Leave Petitions filed\n\nby the\nMadhyanchal Gramin Bank\n(supra) before the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court challenging the judgment of the Division Bench of\n\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court, were dismissed. It was further\n\npointed out that a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court\n\nhad also followed the said view taken by the Madhya Pradesh\n\nHigh Court and that therefore, the present writ petitions deserved\n\nto be dismissed.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n10 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\n12. In rejoinder the learned senior counsel appearing\n\nfor the petitioner bank submitted that the Madhya Pradesh High\n\nCourt had erred in interpreting the Regulations, particularly\n\nRegulation (2) providing for definitions of the expressions \"Pay\",\n\n\"Salary\", and \"Emoluments\". It was submitted that Regulation 72\n\nwas also not properly appreciated in\nthe said judgment\nand that\n\ntherefore, reliance placed on the same by the contesting\n\nrespondents was misplaced. It was submitted that the Appellate\n\nAuthority had committed a grave error and that therefore, the\n\nimpugned order deserved to be set aside.\n\n13. There is no dispute amongst rival parties that\n\nhigher amount of gratuity would be payable to the contesting\n\nrespondents either under the Act of 1972 or the aforesaid\n\nRegulations. The real controversy between the parties in these\n\nwrit petitions is, as to the basis of calculation of the amount of\n\ngratuity payable to the contesting respondents under the aforesaid\n\nRegulations. It is only because there is no upper ceiling or cap in\n\nthe Regulations that the contesting respondents insist that they be\n\npaid gratuity under the said Regulations, by including dearness\n\nallowance as a component under the expression \"Pay\" under the\n\nsaid Regulations so that they are found to be entitled to receive\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n11 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nentire amount without any cap or upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-.\n\nThe petitioner Bank has claimed that, on a proper reading of the\n\nRegulations, calculation of gratuity under its provisions has to be\n\nmade by taking only the pay i.e. basic pay drawn by the contesting\n\nrespondents including stagnation increments, without adding the\n\ncomponent of dearness allowance. On such a calculation the\n\namount of gratuity payable to the contesting respondents is much\n\nless and even less than Rs.10,00,000/-. As a result, the petitioner\n\nBank has calculated gratuity amount under the Act, 1972, wherein\n\n\"Wage\" includes dearness allowance and then the cap or upper\n\nceiling of Rs.10,00,000/- has been applied.\n\n14. In order to resolve the conflict between the parties,\n\nit is necessary to refer to the relevant portions of the aforesaid\n\nRegulations.\n\nRegulation 2\n, Definitions :- (1) In these regulations,\nunless the context otherwise requires -\n\n(a) to (h) ............\n\n(i) \"Emoluments\" means the aggregate of salary and\nallowances, if any.\n\n(j) to (l) ............\n\n(m) \"Pay\" means basic pay drawn per month by\nthe officer or employee in a pay-scale including\nstagnation increments and any part of the\nemoluments which may specifically be classified as\npay under these regulations;\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n12 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\n(n) ...............\n\n(o) \"Salary\" means aggregate of pay and dearness\nallowance;\n\nRegulation 72. Gratuity.-(1) An officer or employee\nshall be eligible for payment of gratuity either as\nper the provisions of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act,\n(39 of 1972) or as per sub-regulation (2),\nwhichever is higher.\n\n(2) Every officer or employee shall be eligible for\ngratuity or\n\n(a) retirement\n\n(b) death\n\n(c) disablement rendering him unfit for further\nservice as certified by a medical officer approved by\nthe Bank, or\n\n(d) resignation after completing 10 years of\ncontinuous service, or\n\n(e) termination of service in any other way except\nby way of punishment after completion of 10 years\nof service :\n\nProvided that in respect of an employee there\nshall be no forfeiture of gratuity for dismissal on\naccount of misconduct except in cases where such\nmisconduct causes financial loss to the bank and\nin\nthat case\nto that extent only.\n\n(3) The amount of gratuity payable to an officer or\nemployee shall be one months pay for every\ncompleted year of service or part thereof in excess\nof six months subject to a maximum of 15 month's\npay :\n\nProvided that where an officer or employee has\ncompleted more than 30 years of service, he shall\nbe eligible by way of gratuity for an additional\namount at the rate of one half of a month's pay for\neach completed year of service beyond 30 years :\n\nProvided further that in respect of an officer the\ngratuity is payable based on the last pay drawn.\n\nProvided also that in respect of an employee pay\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n13 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nfor the purposes of calculation of the gratuity shall\nbe the average of the basic pay (100%) dearness\nallowance and special allowance and officiating\nallowance payable during the 12 months preceding\ndeath, disability, retirement, resignation or\ntermination of service, as the case may be.\n\n15. The relevant provisions of the Act, 1972 are as\n\nfollows :-\n\nSection 2(s)\n\"wages\" means all emoluments which\nare earned by an employee while on duty or on\nleave in accordance with the terms and conditions of\nhis employment and which are paid or are payable\nto him in cash and includes dearness allowance but\ndoes not include any bonus, commission, house rent\nallowance, overtime wages and any other allowance.\n\nSection 4(3)\nThe amount of gratuity payable to an\nemployee shall not exceed [such amount as may be\nnotified by the Central Government from time to\ntime].\n\n16. The rival parties have not disputed the formulae of\n\ncalculation under the Regulations as well as the Act of 1972 and\n\nthe only area of dispute is with regard to inclusion or exclusion of\n\ndearness allowance while calculating amount of gratuity under the\n\nsaid Regulations. A perusal of Regulation 72 shows that after\n\nstating the manner of calculating the amount of gratuity under\n\nClause (3), there are 03 provisos appended to the said clause. The\n\n2nd and 3rd proviso are relevant for the present controversy. The\n\n2nd proviso states that in respect of an officer, the gratuity is\n\npayable based on last pay drawn while the 3 rd proviso states that\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n14 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nin respect of an employee, for the purposes of calculation of\n\ngratuity, pay shall be the average of basic pay, dearness allowance\n\nand special allowance and officiating allowance. The expression\n\n\"Pay\" has been specifically defined under\nRegulation 2(m)\nquoted\n\nabove. It specifically states that \"Pay\" means basic pay including\n\nstagnation increments and any part of emoluments, which may\n\nspecifically be classified as pay under the Regulations. It is\n\nsignificant that the expression \"Salary\" is specifically separately\n\ndefined under\nRegulation 2(o)\nas aggregate of pay and dearness\n\nallowance, while the expression \"Emoluments\" is also separately\n\ndefined under\nRegulation 2(i)\nas the aggregate of salary and\n\nallowances. The three expressions \"Pay\", \"Salary\" and\n\n\"Emoluments\" are distinctly and separately defined under the said\n\nRegulations.\n\n17. The 2nd proviso to Clause (3) of Regulation 72 uses\n\nthe expression \"last pay drawn\". Since \"Pay\" as defined under\n\nRegulation 2(m)\ndoes not include dearness allowance , the same\n\ncannot be read into the expression \"Pay\", as sought to be claimed\n\nby the contesting respondents. Since the expression \"Salary\"\n\nunder\nRegulation 2(o)\nincludes pay and dearness allowance, if the\n\ncontention raised on behalf of the contesting respondents is\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n15 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\naccepted, instead of the expression \"Pay\", the expression \"Salary\"\n\nwill have to be read into 2 nd proviso to Clause (3) of Regulation\n\n72. In this situation, the learned counsel appearing for the\n\ncontesting respondents submitted that the words used in\n\nRegulation 2(m)\nto the effect that \" and any part of the emoluments\n\nwhich may specifically be classified as pay under these regulations \"\n\nwould be rendered meaningless, if the contention raised on behalf\n\nof the petitioner Bank was to be accepted. It was submitted that\n\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court and Calcutta High Court in the\n\naforementioned judgment concerning\nMadhyanchal Gramin Bank\n\n(supra) had therefore, read the definitions of \"Pay\" under\n\nRegulation 2(m)\n, \"Salary\" under 2(o) and \"Emoluments\" under\n\n2(i), as interwoven and interlinked to each other, to give a proper\n\nmeaning to the said definitions, read with Regulation 72 of the\n\nsaid Regulations. It was submitted that dearness allowance was\n\nalways part of pay and this was further clear from definition of\n\nwages as defined in\nsection 2(s)\nof the Act of 1972. On this basis,\n\nit was submitted that the expression \"Pay\" used in the 2 nd proviso\n\nto Clause (3) of the Regulation 72, had to be read to mean that it\n\nincluded basic pay and dearness allowance.\n\n18. But, the said contentions raised on behalf of the\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n16 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\ncontesting respondents cannot be accepted, because as noted\n\nabove it would amount to reading something that is not\n\nspecifically stated in the 2nd proviso to Clause (3) of the\n\nRegulation 72 of the Regulations. The words used in\nRegulation\n\n2(m)\nare to the effect that \"Pay\" would include any part of the\n\nemoluments which may specifically be classified as pay. These\n\nwords do have meaning, because if the 3 rd proviso to Clause (3) of\n\nRegulation 72 of the Regulations is perused, it shows that when\n\ngratuity of an \"employee\" is to be calculated, as opposed to that of\n\nan \"officer\", \"Pay\" for the purposes of calculation of gratuity is to\n\ninclude basic pay, dearness allowance and officiating allowances.\n\nThus, in the case of an employee, the said allowances have been\n\nspecifically classified as pay and therefore, while calculating\n\ngratuity amount payable to an \"employee\" under the 3rd proviso,\n\nsuch allowances have to be included before calculating the\n\nquantum. This distinction in the 2nd and 3rd provisos to Regulation\n\n72(3) of the Regulations, in the light of definitions under\n\nRegulation 2\n, was not brought to the notice of the High Courts of\n\nMadhya Pradesh and Calcutta when it was held that calculation of\n\ngratuity in the case of officers under the said Regulations ought to\n\nbe based on inclusion of dearness allowance in the expression\n\n\"Pay\".\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n17 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\n19. As regards the dismissal of Special Leave Petition of\n\nthe Madhyanchal Gramin Bank against judgment and order of the\n\nDivision Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, it would not\n\nresult in the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court being\n\nbinding on this Court, because as per settled position of law there\n\nis no merger when a Special Leave Petition is dismissed and the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court refuses to grant leave by a speaking or\n\nnon-speaking order. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated\n\nthe said position of law in a recent judgment in the case of\nKhoday\n\nDistilleries Ltd. vs. Shri. Mahadeshwara Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane\n\nLtd.\n(2019) 4 SCC 376. Therefore, dismissal of the Special Leave\n\nPetition against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of\n\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court would not detain this Court from\n\nconsidering the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner Bank\n\non interpretation of the aforesaid Regulations.\n\n20. Thus, the petitioner Bank is justified in raising a\n\ngrievance as regards the impugned orders passed by the Appellate\n\nAuthority. In fact, the Appellate Authority did not discuss this\n\nmain controversy between the parties at all and it proceeded on\n\nthe basis that calculation of gratuity under the Act of 1972, as well\n\nas the Regulations resulted in the same quantum of amount and\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n18 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nthat since the Regulations did not have a cap or upper ceiling, the\n\nsame would apply and not the Act of 1972. Therefore, the\n\nimpugned orders passed by the Appellate Authority are rendered\n\nunsustainable.\n\n21. Once it is found that while calculating the amount\n\nof gratuity payable to the contesting respondents under the\n\nRegulations, only pay could be made the basis without adding\n\ndearness allowance, the quantum of gratuity payable to the\n\ncontesting respondents comes to Rs.8,93,920/- in the case of\n\nrespondent No.2 in Writ Petition No. 8272/2018 and\n\nRs.7,61,740/- in the case of respondent No.2 in Writ Petition\n\nNo.8273/2018, which is much less than the amount of\n\nRs.10,00,000/- each disbursed by the petitioner Bank to the said\n\ncontesting respondents. Thus, the petitioner Bank applied the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1972, while calculating the amount of\n\ngratuity payable to the contesting respondents, because by\n\napplying the provisions of the said Act higher gratuity was payable\n\nto the contesting respondents, despite the cap or upper ceiling of\n\nRs.10,00,000/-. This amount for disbursal of gratuity amount was\n\ncorrectly approved by the Controlling Authority, while rejecting\n\nthe applications filed by the contesting respondents for claim of\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::\n\n19 / 19 wp8272 & 8273.18.odt\n\nadditional amount of gratuity. But, the Appellate Authority failed\n\nto appreciate the contentions of the petitioner Bank.\n\n22. In view of the above, the writ petitions are allowed.\n\nThe impugned orders passed by the Appellate Authority are\n\nquashed and set aside and the orders passed by the Controlling\n\nAuthority in the case of the contesting respondents are restored.\n\nAccordingly, the petitioner Bank is found not liable to pay any\n\nfurther amount towards gratuity to the contesting respondents as\n\nthey admittedly received the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- from the\n\npetitioner Bank immediately upon their superannuation.\n\n23. Writ petitions are disposed of in above terms with\n\nno order as to costs.\n\nJUDGE\n\nKOLHE/P.A.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 06/01/2020 ::: Downloaded on - 07/01/2020 03:44:26 :::",
