MANINDRA MOHAN SHRIVASTAVA\n(Through V.C.)\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (2 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nOrder\nReportable\n\nPronounced on: 25/04/2024\n\n1. Applicant has filed this application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\n\nAct of 1996') for appointment of an arbitrator in the matter of alleged\n\ndispute between the parties to a contract providing for adjudication of\n\ndisputes through the process of arbitration.\n\n2. As pleaded by the applicant, M/s. Verma & Company, 214, Jaipur\n\nRoad, Ajmer is a registered firm under the provisions of\nIndian\n\nPartnership Act, 1932\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1932').\n\nAfter the death of one of the two partners namely; Dinesh Kumar\n\nVerma, his son Akshay Verma was admitted as partner w.e.f.\n\n24.12.2013 and new partnership was constituted which came into\n\nexistence vide partnership deed executed on 24.12.2013 between\n\nSita Devi Verma and Akshay Verma, which is duly signed by each of\n\nthem. Clause-9 of the partnership deed provided that all the disputes\n\nshall be settled by the arbitration according to the provisions of the\n\nAct of 1996.\n\n3. On 14.03.2022, one of the partners Sita Devi Verma addressed\n\na communication to the Branch Manager, Bank of Baroda stating\n\ntherein that the accounts in the name of the firm be stopped/closed\n\nand she also informed that she had executed a Power of Attorney in\n\nthe name of her son-in-law Atul Karel. The Branch Manager of the\n\nBank informed the other partner Akshay Verma regrading letter of\n\nSita Devi Verma for freezing of the accounts of the firm. On\n\n21.03.2022, Akshay Verma replied that the firm had been a very old\n\ncustomer of the bank, therefore, no action or cognizance should be\n\ntaken on the basis of the communication sent by the other partner\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (3 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nSita Devi Verma. This was followed by another communication dated\n\n26.03.2022 through the advocate repeating request not to initiate any\n\naction or take cognizance of the communication sent to the bank by\n\nSita Devi Verma. Sita Devi Verma again sent a letter on 21.04.2022\n\nto the Branch Manager of the bank with a request to restart overdraft\n\naccount of the firm in the name of M/s. Verma & Company.\n\nIt is further averred that Akshay Verma had submitted an\n\naffidavit stating therein that misunderstanding between the parties\n\nhad been cleared and, therefore, consent was given to operate the\n\noverdraft account. It was also stated in the application that Sita Devi\n\nVerma vide communication dated 29.06.2022, addressed to the\n\nMarketing Division, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., stated that she was an\n\nilliterate lady of 89 years, thus, she had forwarded the nomination of\n\nher daughter Shakuntala Karel for partnership. In the meanwhile,\n\nSita Devi Verma expired on 12.07.2022.\n\n4. In the aforesaid background, Bank of Baroda sent a legal notice\n\non 04.08.2022 to the firm M/s. Verma & Company, Akshay Verma,\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma and legal\n\nrepresentatives of deceased Rajendar Verma for execution of\n\nnecessary documents in favour of the firm by reconstituting the firm\n\nor repay outstanding amount of Rs.1,75,33,186/- along with interest\n\nand other expenses, failing which appropriate legal action would be\n\ntaken.\n\n5. As dispute had already arisen between applicant-Akshay Verma\n\nand Sita Devi Verma (since deceased), the applicant requested the\n\nnon-applicants, i.e., legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma to settle the dispute, but despite repeated requests, non-\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (4 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\napplicants have not taken any step for settlement, therefore,\n\napplication has been filed for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\n6. By filing reply to the application, the legal representative of\n\ndeceased Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma, daughter of\n\ndeceased partner Sita Devi Verma, while denying all the allegations,\n\nopposed the application as misconceived and not maintainable. In\n\nreply, it has been stated that present is not a case of any financial\n\ndispute or any other kind of dispute between the partners of the firm\n\nas one of the partners had died. Legal representatives of Sita Devi\n\nVerma are being pressurized to become partners. As they are not\n\npartners either by operation of law or the act of parties, the dispute, if\n\nany, cannot be said to be a dispute between the partners of the firm.\n\nThe terms of the partnership deed regarding appointment of an\n\narbitrator in case of dispute have no legal existence as the\n\npartnership itself stands dissolved on account of death of one of the\n\ntwo partners. Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma is not even a\n\npartner in the firm, nor has ever been associated with the firm. She\n\ncannot be forced to enter into a contract or become a partner in the\n\nfirm against her will, therefore, there is no dispute between the\n\nparties to a contract containing an arbitration clause. The applicant\n\nhas no cause of action against Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma,\n\nwho is nowhere concerned with day-to-day operation of the\n\npartnership firm. Once one of the partners out of the two partners of\n\na partnership firm dies, the firm stands automatically dissolved under\n\nthe law and there is no partnership in existence. The partnership\n\ndeed, as existed between the applicant and deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma, did not have any clause that upon death of one of the\n\npartners, the legal representatives of the deceased shall be inducted\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (5 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nas partners in the firm. Therefore, there is no automatic induction of\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma in the partnership\n\nfirm, as existed between the applicant and Sita Devi Verma, while\n\nSita Devi Verma was alive. The arbitration clause in the partnership\n\ndeed between applicant-Akshay Verma and Sita Devi Verma can no\n\nlonger be invoked against legal representative of deceased Smt. Sita\n\nDevi Verma. Answering Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma,\n\ndaughter of Sita Devi Verma was neither a partner, nor has\n\nconstituted any new partnership with applicant-Akshay Verma, nor\n\nshe has any intention of getting inducted as partner. The applicant is\n\nforcing the answering Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma to enter\n\ninto a partnership firm and forestall recovery of bank dues by\n\nliquidating security in the form of equitable mortgage of a residential\n\nproperty. It is further stated that not only Sita Devi Verma gave her\n\nconsent while she was alive, to the bank to liquidate the security and\n\nrecover the amount due, but later on Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala\n\nVerma has also given similar consent. The consent also states that if\n\nexcess money realises, the same be given to Respondent No.1/1-\n\nShakuntala Verma. As the liability of the firm was increasing day by\n\nday due to overdraft facility, Sita Devi Verma wrote to the bank to\n\nstop overdraft facility.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the applicant would submit that\n\nnotwithstanding death of one of the partners Sita Devi Verma, dispute\n\nwhich existed as between the applicant, one of the partners in the\n\nfirm, with the deceased partner, is an arbitrable dispute in view of\n\narbitration clause contained in the partnership deed between the\n\napplicant and deceased Sita Devi Verma. Even after death of Sita Devi\n\nVerma, the dispute between the partners of the firm may be referred\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (6 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nto arbitration as the legal representative of deceased partner Smt.\n\nSita Devi Verma represents the estate of the deceased, which is a\n\nsecured asset against loan advanced by the bank to the firm. He\n\nwould further submit that vide communication dated 29.06.2022, Sita\n\nDevi Verma had forwarded nomination of her daughter Shakuntala\n\n(Respondent No.1/1) to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. in respect of\n\ndealership of M/s Verma & Company. He would further submit that\n\ndeath of one of the partners does not necessarily follow that the firm\n\nis also dissolved. Dissolution of firm in such a contingency subject to\n\ncontract between the parties and intention to continue business in\n\npartnership with legal representatives may be gathered from the\n\ncontract of the parties. He would further submit that the rule that the\n\npartnership would be dissolved by the death of one of the partners, is\n\nsubject to a contract between the parties, which may be expressed or\n\nimplied. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, share of\n\ndeceased partner in assets including goodwill devolves upon his/her\n\nlegal representatives, therefore, the dispute is clearly arbitrable and\n\nan arbitrator may be appointed to adjudicate the dispute between the\n\napplicant and the legal representative of the deceased partner.\n\n8. Per-contra, leaned counsel appearing for the respondents would\n\nsubmit that the partnership firm in the name of M/s Verma &\n\nCompany consisted of only two partners namely; the applicant and\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma. Though partnership deed as between the\n\napplicant and deceased Sita Devi Verma contained an arbitration\n\nclause to the effect that the dispute shall be referred to arbitrator\n\nunder the Act of 1996, upon death of one of the two partners, the\n\nfirm stood automatically dissolved by operation of law. Neither before\n\ndeath of Sita Devi Verma, Respondent No.1/1-Shakuntala Verma was\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (7 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\ninducted as partner in the then existed firm, nor thereafter, any new\n\npartnership firm had been reconstituted between applicant-Akshay\n\nVerma and Shakuntala Verma, or any other legal representatives of\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma. There is no agreement between the\n\nparties, i.e., between the applicant and Shakuntala Verma, or other\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma to resolve their\n\ndispute through the process of arbitration. The agreement between\n\napplicant-Akshay Verma and Sita Devi Verma to resolve their dispute\n\nthrough the process of arbitration attained its natural demise upon\n\ndeath of Sita Devi Verma on account of automatic dissolution of the\n\npartnership firm. The said agreement cannot be enforced against the\n\nlegal representatives of deceased Sita Devi Verma. Even if it is\n\nassumed, though not admitted that there existed a dispute between\n\npresent applicant-Akshay Verma with the legal representatives of\n\ndeceased Sita Devi Verma, insofar as liquidation of secured assets\n\ntowards realisation of the bank loan and respective claims qua the\n\nsecured assets and in the absence of there being any agreement, to\n\nrefer the dispute through the process of arbitration as between the\n\npresent applicant and the legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma, no recourse could be availed to arbitration proceeding at the\n\ninstance of the applicant. Leaned counsel for the respondents would\n\nfurther submit that even if it is assumed that Sita Devi Verma, when\n\nshe was alive, had sent a letter to the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. on\n\n29.06.2022 expressing her intention to induct non-applicant\n\nRespondent No. 1/1 namely; Shakuntala Verma as one of the\n\npartners, the fact remains that Shakuntala Verma was never inducted\n\nas partner in the firm during life time of Sita Devi Verma. It is not the\n\ncase of the applicant that after death of Sita Devi Verma, a new\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (8 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\npartnership had been constituted between present applicant- Akshy\n\nVerma and Shakuntala Verma, the daughter of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma. Therefore, it is contended, the dispute is non arbitrable.\n\n9. The non-applicants, opposing the application for reference of\n\ndispute by appointing an arbitrator, has denied existence of an\n\nagreement between the parties mainly on the ground that upon death\n\nof one of the partners, the partnership firm stood dissolved and there\n\nexists no agreement between the parties containing a clause that in\n\nthe event of any dispute between the parties, it shall be referred to\n\narbitration. Secondly, respondents have raised an issue regarding non\n\narbitrability of the dispute sought to be raised by the applicant.\n\nTherefore, the two aforesaid issues are required to be decided before\n\ngranting applicant's application.\n\n10. Before I deal with the factual aspects of the case, it is apposite\n\nto refer to recent judicial pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt both on the aspects of existence of arbitration agreement and\n\nnon-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n11. A Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nVidya Drolia & Others Versus Durga Trading Corporation,\n\n(2021) 2 Supreme Court Cases 1, while deciding a reference made\n\nto it, has examined in great details the legal position with regard to\n\nscope of judicial review at the referral stage both on the aspects of\n\nexistence of agreement and non arbitrability. Navigating through\n\nvarious provisions of the Act of 1996, amendments made from time\n\nto time and survey of earlier decisions dealing with the aforesaid\n\naspects, the Hon'ble Supreme Court examined legal position as\n\nbelow:-\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (9 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n\"26. Questions as to the existence of an arbitration\nagreement also arise when a party opposing the reference\nraises plea of novation of contract by entering into a new\ncontract in substitution of the original or 'accord and\nsatisfaction' by acceptance of modified obligations in\ndischarge of the contract by performance or simple\ntermination by express or implied consent. Similar plea of\ndischarge can be raised opposing an application for\nreference on the ground that the claim is long barred and\ndead or there are no outstanding disputes as the parties\nhave accepted part performance or have absolved the other\nside from performance, fully or partly, on account of\nfrustration or otherwise. The contention is that once the\noriginal contract stands extinguished, abandoned,\nrepudiated or substituted, the arbitration clause in the\nunderlying/original contract perishes with it.\n\n27. ................\n\n31. We are clearly bound by the dictum of the\nConstitutional Bench judgment in Patel Engineering Ltd. that\nthe scope and ambit of court's jurisdiction under\nSections 8\n\nor 11 of the\nArbitration Act\nis similar. An application under\n\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act need not set out in detail\nthe disputes or the claims and may briefly refer to the\nsubject matter or broad contours of the dispute. However,\nwhere judicial proceedings are initiated and pending,\nspecific details of the claims and disputes are normally\npleaded and, therefore, the court or the judicial authority\nhas the advantage of these details. There is a difference\nbetween a non-arbitrable claim and non-arbitrable subject\nmatter. Former may arise on account of scope of the\narbitration agreement and also when the claim is not\ncapable of being resolved through arbitration. Generally\nnon-arbitrability of the subject matter would relate to non-\n\narbitrability in law. Further, the decision in Sukanya\nHoldings (P) Ltd. has to be read along with subsequent\njudgment of this Court in\nChloro Controls India Private\nLimited v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc.\n(2013) 1\nSCC 641.\n\n32. ............\n\n71. Complexity is not sufficient to ward off arbitration. In\nterms of the mandate of Section 89 of the Civil Procedure\nCode and the object and purpose behind the\nArbitration Act\n\nand the mandatory language of\nSections 8\nand\n, the\nmutually agreed arbitration clauses must be enforced. The\nlanguage of\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act are\nperemptory in nature.\nArbitration Act\nhas been enacted to\npromote arbitration as a transparent, fair, and just\nalternative to court adjudication. Public policy is to\nencourage and strengthen arbitration to resolve and settle\neconomic, commercial and civil disputes. Amendments from\ntime to time have addressed the issues and corrected the\ninadequacies and flaws in the arbitration procedure. It is for\nthe stakeholders, including the arbitrators, to assure that\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:31 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (10 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nthe arbitration is as impartial, just, and fair as court\nadjudication. It is also the duty of the courts at the post-\naward stage to selectively yet effectively exercise the\nlimited jurisdiction, within the four corners of\nSection 34(2)\n\n(b)(ii) read with Explanations 1 and 2 and check any conflict\nwith the fundamental policy of the applicable law. We would\nsubsequently refer to the 'second look' principle which is\napplicable in three specific situations dealing with\narbitrability as per the mandate of\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act.\n\n72. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada in TELUS\nCommunications Inc. v. Avraham Wellman, (2019) SCC 19\nwhile conceding that arbitration as a method of dispute\nresolution was met with \"overt hostility\" for a long time on\npublic policy grounds as it ousts jurisdiction of courts,\nobserved that the new legislation, the\nArbitration Act\nof\n1991, marks a departure as it encourages parties to adopt\narbitration in commercial and other matters. By putting\nparty autonomy on a high pedestal, the Act mandates that\nthe parties to a valid arbitration agreement must abide by\nthe consensual and agreed mode of dispute resolution. The\ncourts must show due respect to arbitration agreements\nparticularly in commercial settings by staying the court\nproceedings, unless the legislative language is to the\ncontrary. The principle of party autonomy goes hand in\nhand with the principle of limited court intervention, this\nbeing the fundamental principle underlying modern\narbitration law. Party autonomy is weaker in non-negotiated\n\"take it or leave it\" contracts and, therefore, the legislature\ncan through statutes shield the weakest and vulnerable\ncontracting parties like consumers. This is not so in\nnegotiated agreements or even in adhesion contracts having\nan arbitration clause in commercial settings. Virtues of\ncommercial and civil arbitration have been recognised and\naccepted and the courts even encourage the use of\narbitration.\n\n73 ...............\n\n76. In view of the above discussion, we would like to\npropound a four-fold test for determining when the subject\nmatter of a dispute in an arbitration agreement is not\narbitrable:\n\n76.1 (1) when cause of action and subject matter of the\ndispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to\nsubordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in\nrem.\n\n76.2 (2) when cause of action and subject matter of the\ndispute affects third party rights; have erga omnes effect;\n\nrequire centralized adjudication, and mutual adjudication\nwould not be appropriate and enforceable.\n\n76.3 (3) when cause of action and subject matter of the\ndispute relates to inalienable sovereign and public interest\nfunctions of the State and hence mutual adjudication would\nbe unenforceable.\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (11 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n76.4 (4) when the subject-matter of the dispute is expressly\nor by necessary implication non-arbitrable as per mandatory\nstatute(s).\n\n76.5 These tests are not watertight compartments; they\ndovetail and overlap, albeit when applied holistically and\npragmatically will help and assist in determining and\nascertaining with great degree of certainty when as per law\nin India, a dispute or subject matter is non-arbitrable. Only\nwhen the answer is affirmative that the subject matter of\nthe dispute would be non-arbitrable.\n\n76.6. However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied\nwith care and caution as observed in Olympus\nSuperstructures (P) Ltd.: (SCC p.669, para 35)\n\"35...Reference is made there to certain disputes\nlike criminal offences of a public nature, disputes\narising out of illegal agreements and disputes\nrelating to status, such as divorce, which cannot be\nreferred to arbitration. It has, however, been held\nthat if in respect of fats relating to a criminal matter,\nsay, physical injury, if there is a right to damages\nfor personal injury, then such a dispute can be\nreferred to arbitration (Keir v. Leeman).\nSimilarly, it\nhas been held that a husband and a wife may refer\nto arbitration the terms on which they shall\nseparate, because they can make a valid agreement\nbetween themselves on that matter (Soilleux v.\nHerbst,\nWilson v. Wilson\nand Cahill v. Cahill).\"\n\n77. Applying the above principles to determine non-\narbitrability, it is apparent that insolvency or intracompany\ndisputes have to be addressed by a centralized forum, be\nthe court or a special forum, which would be more efficient\nand has complete jurisdiction to efficaciously and fully\ndispose of the entire matter. They are also actions in rem.\nSimilarly, grant and issue of patents and registration of\ntrademarks are exclusive matters falling within the\nsovereign or government functions and have erga omnes\neffect. Such grants confer monopoly rights. They are non-\narbitrable. Criminal cases again are not arbitrable as they\nrelate to sovereign functions of the State. Further,\nviolations of criminal law are offenses against the State and\nnot just against the victim. Matrimonial disputes relating to\nthe dissolution of marriage, restitution of conjugal rights\netc. are not arbitrable as they fall within the ambit of\nsovereign functions and do not have any commercial and\neconomic value. The decisions have erga omnes effect.\nMatters relating to probate, testamentary matter etc. are\nactions in rem and are a declaration to the world at large\nand hence are non-arbitrable.\n\n78. ............\n\n82. Issue of non-arbitrability can be raised at three\nstages. First, before the court on an application for\nreference under\nSection 11\nor for stay of pending judicial\nproceedings and reference under\nSection 8\nof the\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (12 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nArbitration Act\n; secondly, before the arbitral tribunal during\nthe course of the arbitration proceedings; or thirdly, before\nthe court at the stage of the challenge to the award or its\nenforcement. Therefore, the question - 'Who decides non-\narbitrability?' and, in particular, the jurisdiction of the court\nat the first look stage, that is, the referral stage.\n\n83. .............\n\n84.\nUnder the Arbitration Act, 1940\n, the jurisdiction to\nsettle and decide non-arbitrability issues relating to\nexistence, validity, scope as well as whether the subject\nmatter was capable of arbitration, with possible exception\nin case of termination, novation, frustration and 'accord\nand satisfaction' when contested on facts, was determined\nand decided at the first or at the reference stage by the\ncourts. The principle being that the court should be\nsatisfied about the existence of a valid arbitration\nagreement and that the disputes have arisen with regard to\nthe subject matter of the arbitration agreement. At this\nstage, the court would be, however, not concerned with the\nmerits or sustainability of the disputes. Despite best efforts\nto contain obstructive tactics, adjudication and final\ndecision of non-arbitrability issues at the reference stage\nwould invariably stop, derail and thwart the proceedings in\nthe courts for years.\n\n85. ...............\n\n103. On the ambit of the Court's jurisdiction at the\nreference stage, it was observed in\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co.\nLtd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd. and Another\n(2005) 7 SCC 234\nthat the correct approach to the review of the arbitration\nagreement would be restricted to prima facie finding that\nthere exists an arbitration agreement that is not null and\nvoid, inoperative or incapable of being performed. The key\nrationale for holding that the courts' review of the\narbitration agreement should be limited to a prima facie\nstandard is the principle of competence- competence.\nFurther, were the courts are to be empowered to fully\nscrutinize the arbitration agreement an arbitral proceeding\nwould have to be stayed until such time that the court\nseized of the matter renders a decision on the arbitration\nagreement. If the finding of the courts would be a final and\ndeterminative conclusion, then it is obvious that, until such\na pronouncement is made, the arbitral proceedings would\nhave to hang in abeyance. This evidently would defeat the\ncredo and ethos of the\nArbitration Act\n, which is to enable\nexpeditious arbitration without avoidable intervention by\nthe judicial authorities. As a result, the approach to be\nadopted at the reference stage is whether it is 'plainly\narguable' that the arbitration agreement is in existence.\nThe judgment laid emphasis on the fact that the rule of\npriority in favour of the arbitrators is counter-balanced by\nthe courts' power to review the existence and validity of\nthe arbitration agreement at the end of the arbitral\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (13 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nprocess.\n\nIt was elucidated: (\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd\n,\nSupra).\n\n\"74..... Even if the court takes the view that the\narbitral agreement is not vitiated or that it is not\ninvalid, inoperative or unenforceable, based upon\npurely a prima facie view, nothing prevents the\narbitrator from trying the issue fully and rendering a\nfinal decision thereupon ....\n\n75..... Even after the court takes a prima facie view\nthat the arbitration agreement is not vitiated on\naccount of factors enumerated in\nSection 45\n, and the\narbitrator upon a full trial holds that there is no\nvitiating factor in the arbitration agreement and\nmakes an award, such an award can be challenged\nunder\nSection 48(1)(a)\n. The award will be set aside if\nthe party against whom it is invoked satisfies the\ncourt inter alia that the agreement was not valid\nunder the law to which the parties had subjected it or\nunder the law of the country where the award was\nmade. The two basic requirements, namely,\nexpedition at the pre-reference stage, and a fair\nopportunity to contest the award after full trial,\nwould be fully satisfied by the interpreting\nSection 45\n\nas enabling the court to act on a prima facie view.\n\n* * *\n\n105. ..... [T]he object of the Act would be defeated if\nthe proceedings remain pending in the court even\nafter commencing of the arbitration. It is precisely\nfor this reason that I am inclined to the view that at\nthe pre-reference stage contemplated by\nSection 45\n,\nthe court is required to take only a prima facie view\nfor making the reference, leaving the parties to a full\ntrial either before the Arbitral Tribunal or before the\ncourt at the post-award stage.\"\n\n104. ...........\n\n132. The courts at the referral stage do not perform\nministerial functions. They exercise and perform judicial\nfunctions when they decide objections in terms of\nSections\nand\nof the Arbitration Act.\nSection 8\nprescribes the\ncourts to refer the parties to arbitration, if the action\nbrought is the subject of an arbitration agreement, unless it\nfinds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists.\nExamining the term 'prima facie', in\nNirmala J. Jhala v.\nState of Gujarat\n, (2013) 4 SCC 301, this Court had noted:\n\n(SCC p.320, para 48)\n\"48. '27.... A prima facie case does not mean a case\nproved to the hilt but a case which can be said to be\nestablished if the evidence which is led in support of\nthe case were [to be] believed. While determining\nwhether a prima facie case had been made out or not\nthe relevant consideration is whether on the evidence\nled it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in\nquestion and not whether that was the only\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (14 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nconclusion which could be arrived at on that\nevidence.' \"\n\n133. Prima facie case in the context of\nSection 8\nis not to\nbe confused with the merits of the case put up by the\nparties which has to be established before the arbitral\ntribunal. It is restricted to the subject matter of the suit\nbeing prima facie arbitrable under a valid arbitration\nagreement. Prima facie case means that the assertions on\nthese aspects are bona fide. When read with the principles\nof separation and competence-competence and\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting\nbogged-down would compel the parties to abide unless\nthere are good and substantial reasons to the contrary.\n\n134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a\nprimary first review to weed out manifestly and ex facie\nnon-existent and invalid arbitration agreements and non-\narbitrable disputes. The prima facie review at the reference\nstage is to cut the deadwood and trim off the side branches\nin straight forward cases where dismissal is barefaced and\npellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation must\nstop at the first stage. Only when the court is certain that\nno valid arbitration agreement exists or the\ndisputes/subject matter are not arbitrable, the application\nunder\nSection 8\nwould be rejected. At this stage, the court\nshould not get lost in thickets and decide debatable\nquestions of facts. Referral proceedings are preliminary and\nsummary and not a mini trial. This necessarily reflects on\nthe nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the court and in\nthis context, the observations of B.N. Srikrishna, J. of\n\"plainly arguable\" case in\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd.\n\n(Supra) are of importance and relevance.\n\nSimilar views are\nexpressed by this Court in\nVimal Kishor Shah v. Jayesh\nDinesh Shah\n(2016) 8 SCC 788 wherein the test applied at\nthe pre-arbitration stage was whether there is a \"good\narguable case\" for the existence of an arbitration\nagreement.\n\n135. ..........\n\n139. We would not like be too prescriptive, albeit observe\nthat the court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent\nwastage of public and private resources, can exercise\njudicial discretion to conduct an intense yet summary prima\nfacie review while remaining conscious that it is to assist\nthe arbitration procedure and not usurp jurisdiction of the\narbitral tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full review or a\nlong-drawn review at the referral stage would obstruct and\ncause delay undermining the integrity and efficacy of\narbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Conversely,\nif the court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may\nundermine effectiveness of both the arbitration and the\ncourt. There are certain cases where the prima facie\nexamination may require a deeper consideration. The\ncourt's challenge is to find the right amount of and the\ncontext when it would examine the prima facie case or\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (15 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nexercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance\nbetween avoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral\nstage and protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate\nwhen the matter is clearly non-arbitrable.\n\n140. ............\n\n143. We would now examine\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration\nAct. As noticed above sub-section (6-A) was inserted by\nthe Act 3 of 2016 with retrospective effect from 23-10-\n2015 and omitted by Act 33 of 2019.\nSection 11 (6)\n\nrequires the court to appoint an arbitrator on an application\nmade by a party. Section (6-A) to\nSection 11\nstipulates\nthat the court shall, at the stage of appointment under sub-\nsections (4), (5) or (6), confine itself to the examination of\nthe existence of an arbitration agreement. Sub-section (6-\nA) was omitted by Act 33 of 2019, but the omission is in\nview of the introduction of a new regime of institutionalised\narbitration as per the report of the committee headed by\nJustice B. N. Srikrishna, dated 30-07-2017 which records\nfor the reason of recommending the omission as:\n\n\"Thus, it can be seen that after the Amendment Act of\n2019,\nSection 11\n(6-A) has been omitted because\nappointment of arbitrators is to be done\ninstitutionally, in which case the Supreme Court or\nthe High Court under the old statutory regime are no\nlonger required to appoint arbitrators and\nconsequently to determine whether an arbitration\nagreement exists.\"\n\n144. As observed earlier, SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering\nLtd. (2005) 8 SCC 618 explains and holds that\nSections 8\n\nand\nare complementary in nature as both relate to\nreference to arbitration.\nSection 8\napplies when judicial\nproceeding is pending and an application is filed for stay of\njudicial proceeding and for reference to arbitration.\nAmendments to\nSection 8\nvide Act 3 of 2016 have not been\nomitted.\nSection 11\ncovers the situation where the parties\napproach a court for appointment of an arbitrator.\nMayavati\nTrading Private Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman\n, (2019) 8\nSCC 714 in our humble opinion, rightly holds that Patel\nEngineering Ltd. (Supra) has been legislatively overruled\nand hence would not apply even post omission of Sub-\nsection (6-A) to\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nMayavati\nTrading Private Ltd.\n(Supra) has elaborated upon the object\nand purposes and history of the amendment to\nSection 11\n,\nwith reference to Sub-section (6-A) to elucidate that the\nSection, as originally enacted, was facsimile with\nArticle 11\n\nof the UNCITRAL Model of law of arbitration on which the\n\nArbitration Act\nwas drafted and enacted. Referring to the\nlegislative scheme of\nSection 11\n, different interpretations,\nand the Law Commission's Reports, it has been held that\nthe omitted Sub-section (6-A) to\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration Act would continue to apply and guide the\ncourts on its scope of jurisdiction at stage one, that is, the\npre-arbitration stage.\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (16 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n145. Omission of Sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was\nwith the specific object and purpose and is relatable to by\nsubstitution of Sub-sections (12), (13) and (14) to\nSection\nof the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide\nSub-section (3A) stipulates that the High Court and this\ncourt shall have the power to designate the arbitral\ninstitutions which have been so graded by the Council\nunder Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral\ninstitution is not available, the concerned High Court shall\nmaintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging the function\nand thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an\narbitral institution for reference to the arbitral tribunal.\nTherefore, it would be wrong to accept that post omission\nof Sub-section (6-A) to\nSection 11\nthe ratio in Patel\nEngineering Ltd. (Supra) would become applicable.\n\n146. We now proceed to examine the question, whether\nthe word 'existence' in\nSection 11\nmerely refers to contract\nformation (whether there is an arbitration agreement) and\nexcludes the question of enforcement (validity) and\ntherefore the latter falls outside the jurisdiction of the court\nat the referral stage. On jurisprudentially and textualism it\nis possible to differentiate between existence of an\narbitration agreement and validity of an arbitration\nagreement. Such interpretation can draw support from the\nplain meaning of the word \"existence'. However, it is\nequally possible, jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to\nhold that an agreement has no existence if it is not\nenforceable and not binding. Existence of an arbitration\nagreement presupposes a valid agreement which would be\nenforced by the court by relegating the parties to\narbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation\nwould be contrary to the contextual background including\nthe definition clause and would result in unpalatable\nconsequences. A reasonable and just interpretation of\n'existence' requires understanding the context, the purpose\nand the relevant legal norms applicable for a binding and\nenforceable arbitration agreement. An agreement\nevidenced in writing has no meaning unless the parties can\nbe compelled to adhere and abide by the terms. A party\ncannot sue and claim rights based on an unenforceable\ndocument. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that an\narbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal.\nA void and unenforceable understanding is no agreement to\ndo anything. Existence of an arbitration agreement means\nan arbitration agreement that meets and satisfies the\nstatutory requirements of both the Arbitration Act and the\nContract Act and when it is enforceable in law.\n\n147. We would proceed to elaborate and give further\nreasons:\n\n147.1.\nIn\nGarware Wall Ropes Ltd. v. Coastal Marine\nConstructions & Engg. Ltd.\n(2019) 9 SCC 209, this Court\nhad examined the question of stamp duty in an underlying\ncontract with an arbitration clause and in the context had\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (17 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\ndrawn a distinction between the first and second part of\n\nSection 7(2)\nof the Arbitration Act, albeit the observations\nmade and quoted above with reference to 'existence' and\n'validity' of the arbitration agreement being apposite and\nextremely important, we would repeat the same by\nreproducing para 29 thereof: (SCC p.238)\n\"29. This judgment in United India Insurance Co.\n\nLtd. v. Hyundai Engg. & Constructions Co. Ltd.\n\n(2018) 17 SCC 607 is important in that what was\nspecifically under consideration was an arbitration\nclause which would get activated only if an insurer\nadmits or accepts liability. Since on facts it was\nfound that the insurer repudiated the claim, though\nan arbitration clause did \"exist\", so to speak, in the\npolicy, it would not exist in law, as was held in that\njudgment, when one important fact is introduced,\nnamely, that the insurer has not admitted or\naccepted liability. Likewise, in the facts of the\npresent case, it is clear that the arbitration clause\nthat is contained in the sub-contract would not\n\"exist\" as a matter of law until the sub-contract is\nduly stamped, as has been held by us above.\n\nThe\nargument that\nSection 11\n(6-A) deals with\n\"existence\", as opposed to\nSection 8\n,\nSection 16\nand\n\nSection 45\n, which deal with \"validity\" of an\narbitration agreement is answered by this Court's\nunderstanding of the expression \"existence\" in\n\nUnited India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Hyundai Engg. &\nConstruction Co. Ltd., (Supra\n), as followed by us.\"\nExistence and validity are intertwined, and arbitration\nagreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy\nmandatory legal requirements. Invalid agreement is no\nagreement.\n\n147.2. The court at the reference stage exercises judicial\npowers. 'Examination', as an ordinary expression in\ncommon parlance, refers to an act of looking or considering\nsomething carefully in order to discover something (as per\nCambridge Dictionary). It requires the person to inspect\nclosely, to test the condition of, or to inquire into carefully\n(as per Merriam-Webster Dictionary). It would be rather\nodd for the court to hold and say that the arbitration\nagreement exists, though ex facie and manifestly the\narbitration agreement is invalid in law and the dispute in\nquestion is non-arbitrable. The court is not powerless and\nwould not act beyond jurisdiction, if it rejects an application\nfor reference, when the arbitration clause is admittedly or\nwithout doubt is with a minor, lunatic or the only claim\nseeks a probate of a will.\n\n147.3. Most scholars and jurists accept and agree that the\nexistence and validity of an arbitration agreement are the\nsame. Even Starvos Brekoulakis accepts that validity, in\nterms of substantive and formal validity, are questions of\ncontract and hence for the court to examine.\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (18 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n147.4. Most jurisdictions accept and require prima facie\nreview by the court on non-arbitrability aspects at the\nreferral stage.\n\n147.5.\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act are\ncomplementary provisions as was held in Patel Engineering\nLtd.(Supra). The object and purpose behind the two\nprovisions is identical to compel and force parties to abide\nby their contractual understanding. This being so, the two\nprovisions should be read as laying down similar standard\nand not as laying down different and separate parameters.\n\nSection 11\ndoes not prescribe any standard of judicial\nreview by the court for determining whether an arbitration\nagreement is in existence.\nSection 8\nstates that the judicial\nreview at the stage of reference is prima facie and not final.\nPrima facie standard equally applies when the power of\njudicial review is exercised by the court under\nSection 11\nof\nthe Arbitration Act. Therefore, we can read the mandate of\nvalid arbitration agreement in\nSection 8\ninto mandate of\n\nSection 11\n, that is, 'existence of an arbitration agreement'.\n147.6. Exercise of power of prima facie judicial review of\nexistence as including validity is justified as a court is the\nfirst forum that examines and decides the request for the\nreferral. Absolute \"hands off\" approach would be\ncounterproductive and harm arbitration, as an alternative\ndispute resolution mechanism. Limited, yet effective\nintervention is acceptable as it does not obstruct but\neffectuates arbitration.\n\n147.7. Exercise of the limited prima facie review does not\nin any way interfere with the principle of competence-\ncompetence and separation as to obstruct arbitration\nproceedings but ensures that vexatious and frivolous\nmatters get over at the initial stage.\n\n147.8. Exercise of prima facie power of judicial review as to\nthe validity of the arbitration agreement would save costs\nand check harassment of objecting parties when there is\nclearly no justification and a good reason not to accept plea\nof non-arbitrability.\nIn\nSubrata Roy Sahara v. Union of\nIndia\n, (2014) 8 SCC 470, this Court has observed: (SCC\np.642, para 191)\n\"191. The Indian judicial system is grossly afflicted\nwith frivolous litigation. Ways and means need to be\nevolved to deter litigants from their compulsive\nobsession towards senseless and ill-considered claims.\nOne needs to keep in mind that in the process of\nlitigation, there is an innocent sufferer on the other\nside of every irresponsible and senseless claim. He\nsuffers long-drawn anxious periods of nervousness and\nrestlessness, whilst the litigation is pending without\nany fault on his part. He pays for the litigation from\nout of his savings (or out of his borrowings) worrying\nthat the other side may trick him into defeat for no\nfault of his. He spends invaluable time briefing counsel\nand preparing them for his claim. Time which he\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (19 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nshould have spent at work, or with his family, is lost,\nfor no fault of his. Should a litigant not be\ncompensated for what he has lost for no fault? The\nsuggestion to the legislature is that a litigant who has\nsucceeded must be compensated by the one who has\nlost. The suggestion to the legislature is to formulate a\nmechanism that anyone who initiates and continues a\nlitigation senselessly pays for the same. It is\nsuggested that the legislature should consider the\nintroduction of a \"Code of Compulsory Costs\".\"\n\n147.9 Even in\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n\n(2017) 9 SCC 729, Kurian Joseph, J., in para 52, had\nreferred to\nSection 7(5)\nand thereafter in para 53 referred\nto a judgment of this Court in\nM.R. Engineers and\nContractors (P) Limited v. Som Datt Builders Limited\n,\n(2009) 7 SCC 696 to observe that the analysis in the said\ncase supports the final conclusion that the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding in the said case did not incorporate an\narbitration clause.\n\nThereafter, reference was specifically\nmade to SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd. (Supra) and\n\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab (P) Limited\n\n(2009) 1 SCC 267 to observe that the legislative policy is\nessential to minimise court's interference at the pre-arbitral\nstage and this was the intention of sub-section (6) to\n\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nParagraph 48 in\nDuro\nFelguera, S.A.\n(Supra) specifically states that the resolution\nhas to exist in the arbitration agreement, and it is for the\ncourt to see if the agreement contains a clause which\nprovides for arbitration of disputes which have arisen\nbetween the parties. Para 59 is more restrictive and\nrequires the court to see whether an arbitration agreement\nexists - nothing more, nothing less. Read with the other\nfindings, it would be appropriate to read the two\nparagraphs as laying down the legal ratio that the court is\nrequired to see if the underlying contract contains an\narbitration clause for arbitration of the disputes which have\narisen between the parties - nothing more, nothing less.\n\nReference to decisions in Patel Engineering Ltd. (Supra)\nand\nBoghara Polyfab Private Limited\n(Supra) was to\nhighlight that at the reference stage, post the amendments\nvide Act 3 of 2016, the court would not go into and finally\ndecide different aspects that were highlighted in the two\ndecisions.\n\n147.10.\nIn addition to\nGarware Wall Ropes Ltd.\n(Supra),\nthis Court in\nOriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Narbheram\nPower & Steel (P) Ltd.\n(2018) 6\nSCC 534 and Hyundai\nEngg. & Construction Co. Ltd.\n(Supra), both decisions of\nthree Judges, has rejected the application for reference in\nthe insurance contracts holding that the claim was beyond\nand not covered by the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe court\nfelt that the legal position was beyond doubt as the scope\nof the arbitration clause was fully covered by the dictum in\n\nVulcan Insurance Co. Ltd v. Maharaj Singh\n(1976) 1 SCC\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (20 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n943. Similarly, in M/s. PSA Mumbai Investments PTE.\n\nLimited v. Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust\n, (2018) 10 SCC 525,\nthis Court at the referral stage came to the conclusion that\nthe arbitration clause would not be applicable and govern\nthe disputes. Accordingly, the reference to the arbitral\ntribunal was set aside leaving the respondent to pursue its\nclaim before an appropriate forum.\n\n147.11. The interpretation appropriately balances the\nallocation of the decision-making authority between the\ncourt at the referral stage and the arbitrators' primary\njurisdiction to decide disputes on merits. The court as the\njudicial forum of the first instance can exercise prima facie\ntest jurisdiction to screen and knockdown ex facie\nmeritless, frivolous and dishonest litigation. Limited\njurisdiction of the courts ensures expeditious, alacritous\nand efficient disposal when required at the referral stage.\n\n148. ............\n\n153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression 'existence of\nan arbitration agreement' in\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration\nAct, would include aspect of validity of an arbitration\nagreement, albeit the court at the referral stage would\napply the prima facie test on the basis of principles set out\nin this judgment. In cases of debatable and disputable\nfacts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the court\nwould force the parties to abide by the arbitration\nagreement as the arbitral tribunal has primary jurisdiction\nand authority to decide the disputes including the question\nof jurisdiction and non-arbitrability.\n\n154. Discussion under the heading \"Who decides\nArbitrability?\" can be crystallized as under:\n\n154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engineering Ltd.\n\n(Supra) on the scope of judicial review by the court while\ndeciding an application under\nSections 8\nor 11 of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016\n(with retrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post\nthe amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 09-\n08-2019), is no longer applicable.\n\n154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the court\nunder\nSection 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act is identical\nbut extremely limited and restricted.\n\n154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the\nlegislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of\n2019, and the principle of severability and competence-\ncompetence, is that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred\nfirst authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\narbitrability. The court has been conferred power of\n\"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post the award\nin terms of sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of\nSection 34(2)(a)\n\nor sub-clause (i) of\nSection 34(2)(b)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at the\n\nSections 8\nor 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie\ncertain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,\ninvalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (21 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nnature and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent,\ndetermine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The\nrestricted and limited review is to check and protect parties\nfrom being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\ndemonstrably 'non-arbitrable' and to cut off the deadwood.\nThe court by default would refer the matter when\ncontentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly\narguable; when consideration in summary proceedings\nwould be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are\ncontested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts\ndelaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration\nproceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into\na mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal but to affirm and uphold\nintegrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative\ndispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\nIn the case of Indian Oil Corporation Limited Versus NCC\n\nLimited, (2023) 2 Supreme Court Cases 539, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, after survey of its earlier judicial pronouncements,\n\nparticularly the decision in the case of Vidya Drolia & Others\n\n(Supra), observed as below:-\n\n\"73.\nIn the recent decision of this Court in\nDLF Home\nDevelopers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd\n(2021) 16 SCC\n\n743) in which this Court also had an occasion to consider\n\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of the Arbitration Act\nand ultimately has\nobserved, after referring to and considering the decision of\nthe three-Judge Bench of this Court in Vidya Drolia (supra)\nthat the jurisdiction of the Court under\nSection 11\nof the\nArbitration Act is primarily to find out whether there existed\na written agreement between the parties for resolution of\nthe dispute and whether the aggrieved party has made out\na prima facie arguable case, it is further observed that\nlimited jurisdiction, however, does not denude the Court of\nits judicial function to look beyond the bare existence of an\narbitration clause to cut the deadwood. In the said decision,\nthis Court had taken note of the observations made in the\ncase of Vidya Drolia (supra) that with a view to prevent\nwastage of public and private resources, the Court may\nconduct 'prima facie review' at the stage of reference to\nweed out any frivolous or vexatious claims.\"\n\n12. In another decision in the case of NTPC Limited Versus\n\nSPML Infra Limited, (2023) 9 Supreme Court Cases 385,\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the legal position with\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (22 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nregard to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. It was explained\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court as below:-\n\n\"Position of Law\n\n16. In the present case, we are concerned with the pre-\nreferral jurisdiction of the High Court under\nSection 11\nof\nthe Act and would like to underscore the limited scope\nwithin which an application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has to be considered.\n\n17. The position of law with respect to the pre-referral\njurisdiction, as it existed before the advent of\nSection 11\n(6-\n\nA) in the Act\n, was based on a well-articulated principle\nformulated by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v.\n\nBoghara Polyfab (P) Ltd (2009) 1 SCC 267. In Boghara\nPolyfab, this Court held that the issue of non-arbitrability of\na dispute will have to be examined by the Court in cases\nwhere accord and discharge of the contract is alleged.\nFollowing the principle in Boghara Polyfab, this Court in\n\nUnion of India v. Master Construction Co.\n(2011) 12 SCC\n349 observed that when the validity of a discharge\nvoucher, no-claim certificate or a settlement agreement is\nin dispute, the Court must prima facie examine the\ncredibility of the allegations before referring the parties to\narbitration.\n\nYet again in\nNew India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.\nGenus Power Infrastructure Ltd.\n(2015) 2 SCC 424, this\nCourt observed that allegations of fraud, coercion, duress\nor undue influence must be prima facie substantiated\nthrough evidence by the party raising the allegations.\n\n18. In a legislative response to these precedents, through\nthe\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act\n2015,\nsub-section (6-A) was added to\nSection 11\nof the Act,\nwhich reads as follows:\n\n11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may\nbe, the High Court, while considering any application\nunder sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\n\nsection (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment,\ndecree or order of any Court, confine to the\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n19. Taking cognizance of the legislative change, this Court\nin Duro Felguera, SA Versus Gangavaram Port Ltd., (2017)\n9 SCC 729 noted that post the 2015 Amendments, the\njurisdiction of the Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is\nlimited to examining whether an arbitration agreement\nexists between the parties-\"nothing more, nothing less\"\n\n20. However, in the year 2019, in\nUnited India Insurance\nCo. Ltd. v. Antique Art Exports (P) Ltd.\n(2019) 5 SCC 362,\nthis Court had nevertheless accepted an objection of\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (23 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n\"accord and satisfaction\" in opposition to an application for\nreference to arbitration.\n\n21. It did not take much time for this Court to reverse the\napproach in\nAntique Art Exports (P) Ltd.\n(Supra).\n\nA three-\nJudge Bench in Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. Versus Pradyuat\nDeb Burman (2019) 8 SCC 714 expressly overruled the\nabovereferred decision in Antique Art Exports, observing\nthat: (\nMayavati Trading\ncase, SCC pp. 724-25, Para-10)\n\n\"10. This being the position, it is clear that the law\nprior to the 2015 Amendment that has been\nlaid down\nby\nthis Court, which would have included going into\nwhether accord and satisfaction has taken place, has\nnow been legislatively overruled. This being the\nposition, it is difficult to agree with the reasoning\ncontained in the aforesaid judgment, as\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) is confined to the examination of the existence of an\narbitration agreement and is to be understood in the\nnarrow sense as has been\nlaid down in\nthe judgment in\nDuro Felguera, SA.\"\n\n(emphasis in original)\n\nHaving navigated through various judicial pronouncements\n\nand the common thread of prima-facie test, it was\n\nauthoritatively held as below:-\n\n\"24. Following the general rule and the principle\nlaid down\nin\nVidya Drolia (Supra) this Court has consistently been\nholding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\nauthority to determine and decide all questions of non-\narbitrability. In Pravin Electricals (P).\nLtd. v. Galaxy Infra\nand Engg. (P\n).\n\nLtd. (2021) 5 SCC 671, Sanjiv Prakash v.\nSeema Kukreja\n(\n2021) 9 SCC 732 and Indian Oil\nCorporation Ltd. v. NCC Ltd\n(2023) 2 SCC 539., the parties\nwere referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in\neach of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability\nwas found to be inconclusive.\nFollowing the exception to\nthe general principle that the Court may not refer parties to\narbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and\nex facie non-arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India)\n(P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 738 (hereinafter \"Nortel Networks\")\nand Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B.\nRamachandraiah & Sons (2021) 5 SCC 705, arbitration was\nrefused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably\ntime-barred.\n\nEye of the needle\n\n25. The above-referred precedents crystallise the position\nof law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of the courts under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is very narrow and inheres two\ninquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and\nthe validity of an arbitration agreement, which also\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (24 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nincludes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and\nthe applicant's privity to the said agreement. These are\nmatters which require a thorough examination by the\nreferral court. The secondary inquiry that may arise at the\nreference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability\nof the dispute.\n\n26. As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral Tribunal is\nthe preferred first authority to determine and decide all\nquestions of non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule,\nand rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject\nclaims which are manifestly and ex-facie non-arbitrable.\nExplaining this position, flowing from the principles laid\ndown in Vidya Drolia & Others (supra), this Court in a\nsubsequent decision in Nortel Networks (Supra) held:\n\n(Nortel Networks case, SCC p.764, para 45)\n\"45. ..45.1. ... While exercising jurisdiction under\n\nSection 11\nas the judicial forum, the court may exercise\nthe prima facie test to screen and knockdown ex facie\nmeritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited\njurisdiction of the courts would ensure expeditious and\nefficient disposal at the referral stage. At the referral\nstage, the Court can interfere \"only\" when it is\n\"manifest\" that the claims are ex facie time-barred and\ndead, or there is no subsisting dispute.\"\n\n27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-\narbitrability of a claim is only prima facie. Referral courts\nmust not undertake a full review of the contested facts;\nthey must only be confined to a primary first review and let\nfacts speak for themselves. This also requires the Courts to\nexamine whether the assertion on arbitrability is bona fide\nor not. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead to a\nclear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt\nthat the claim is non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if\nthere is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute\nto arbitration.\"\n\n13. In yet another recent judicial pronouncement in the case of\n\nMagic Eye Developers Private Limited Versus M/s. Green\n\nEdge Infrastructure Private Limited & Others, (2023) 8\n\nSupreme Court Cases 50, following pertinent observations\n\nwere made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court:-\n\n\"8. While considering the aforesaid issue,\nSection 11\n(6-\nA)\nof the Arbitration Act\nwhich has been added through the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act, 2015\nis\nrequired to be read, which reads as follows:\n\n\"11. (6-A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may\nbe, the High Court, while considering any application\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (25 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nunder sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\nsection (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment,\ndecree or order of any court, confine to the\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration\nagreement\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n9. Thus, post\nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act,\n, the jurisdiction of the court under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act is limited to examining whether an arbitration\nagreement exists between the parties- \"nothing more,\nnothing less\". Thus, as per\nSection 11\n(6-\nA) of the Act\n, it is\nthe duty cast upon the Referral Court to consider the\ndispute/issue with respect to the existence of an arbitration\nagreement.\n\n10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the\nsettled position of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act is very narrow\nand inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the\nexistence and the validity of an arbitration agreement,\nwhich also includes an inquiry as to the parties to the\nagreement and the applicant's privity to the said\nagreement. The said matter requires a thorough\nexamination by the Referral Court. (para 25 of the decision\nin NTPC). The Secondary inquiry that may arise at the\nreference stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability\nof the dispute. Both are different and distinct.\"\n\n14. Keeping in forefront the above settled legal position with\n\nregard to existence of an arbitration agreement, non-\n\narbitrability and the scope of judicial review at the referral\n\nstage while dealing with the application under\nSection 11 (6)\nof\n\nthe Act of 1996 seeking appointment of an arbitrator, I shall\n\nnow deal with the issues raised in the present application.\n\n15. The pleadings of the parties reveal an admitted position to\n\nthe effect that M/s Verma & Company was a registered firm\n\nunder the Act of 1932 and after the death of one of the two\n\npartners namely; Dinesh Kumar Verma, his son Akshay Verma\n\n(applicant herein) was admitted as partner w.e.f. 24.12.2013\n\nand new partnership was constituted which came into existence\n\nvide partnership deed executed on 24.12.2013 between Sita\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (26 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nDevi Verma and Akshay Verma, which is duly signed by each of\n\nthem. It is not in dispute that Clause-9 of the partnership deed\n\nprovided that all the disputes shall be settled by the arbitration\n\naccording to the provisions of the Act of 1996. Clause-9 of the\n\nPartnership deed reads as under:-\n\n\"9. All disputes shall be settled by arbitration according\nto the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act.\"\n\n16. However, a dispute arose when Sita Devi Verma addressed\n\na communication to the Bank on 14.03.2022 requesting closer\n\nof the accounts in the name of the firm. When Bank informed\n\nthe other partner Akshay Verma regrading request of Sita Devi\n\nVerma for freezing of the accounts of the firm, the other\n\npartner requested the bank not to proceed with the request. It\n\nis also the case of the applicant that later on Sita Devi Verma\n\nsent a letter on 21.04.2022 to the Branch Manager of the bank\n\nwith a request to restart overdraft account of the firm followed\n\nby a letter of applicant-Akshay Verma that misunderstanding\n\nbetween the parties has been cleared. In the meanwhile, Sita\n\nDevi Verma expired on 12.07.2022. The bank, however, sent a\n\nlegal notice on 04.08.2022 to the firm M/s. Verma & Company,\n\nAkshay Verma, legal representatives of deceased Sita Devi\n\nVerma and legal representatives of deceased Rajendar Verma\n\nfor execution of necessary documents in favour of the bank by\n\nreconstituting the firm or repay outstanding amount of\n\nRs.1,75,33,186/- along with interest and other expenses, failing\n\nwhich appropriate legal action would be taken.\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (27 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n17. A legal issue, therefore, which arises for consideration is\n\nas to whether the firm stood dissolved, there being only two\n\npartners and one partner having died.\n\nThe legal position in this regard was examined by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Laiquiddin &\n\nAnr. Versus Kamla Devi Mishra (Dead) By L.Rs & Ors.\n\n(2010) 2 Supreme Court Cases 407. One of the issues\n\nwhich arose for consideration was whether the partnership firm\n\nstood dissolved by virtue of\nSection 42(c)\nof the Act of 1932 on\n\naccount of the death of one of the partners, on facts, that being\n\na case where partnership consisted of only two partners and\n\none of them died.\n\n18. In the light of the provisions contained in\nSection 42\nof\n\nthe Act of 1932 and despite there being a clause in the\n\npartnership deed to keep the same alive despite death of any\n\npartner, legal position was examined as below:-\n\n\"22. The sole issue raised by the Respondents in this\nappeal, who are the appellants in Appeal No. 4411-12 of\n2002, is whether the finding of the Courts below that the\nPartnership firm stood dissolved on account of death of\none of the partners was correct in the light of the express\nprovisions of the\nPartnership Act\n, namely,\nSection 42 (c)\n\nof the same.\n\n23. Before we proceed to examine the correctness of this\nconcurrent findings arrived at by the Courts below, it is\nnecessary to examine the relevant provisions of the\n\nPartnership Act, 1923\nand the relevant clauses of the\npartnership deed entered between the original plaintiff and\nthe original defendant. \"Partnership\" is defined under\n\nSection 4\nof the Act which reads as under:\n\n\"4. Definition of 'partnership', 'partner', 'firm' and\n'firm name.- \"Partnership is the relation between\npersons who have agreed to share the profits of a\nbusiness carried on by all or any of them acting for\nall.\"\n\n24.\nSection 42\nof the Act reads as under:\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (28 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n\"42. Dissolution on the happening of certain\ncontingencies:- Subject to contract between the\npartners a firm is dissolved-\n\n(a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the\nexpiry of the term;\n\n(b) if constituted to carry out one or more\nadventures or undertakings, by the\ncompletion thereof;\n(c) by the death of a partner; and\n(d) by the adjudication of a partner as an\ninsolvent.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n25. Dissolution of a partnership firm on account of death\nof one of the partners is subject to the contract entered\ninto by the parties. In this context, it is pertinent to refer\nto the terms of the deed of partnership. Clause 22 of the\nPartnership deed reads as follows:\n\n\"The partnership shall be in force for a period of\n42 years certain from this date and the death of any\npartner shall not have the effect of dissolving the\nfirm.\"\n\nThis clause clearly states that death of any partner shall\nnot have the effect of dissolving the firm. However, in the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, we are not in a\nposition to give absolute effect to this clause of the deed of\npartnership.\n\n26. The learned counsel for the Respondents contended\nthat since the parties agreed that in spite of the death of\nany of the partners, the firm shall continue for 42 years\nirrespective of the death of the original plaintiff (since\ndeceased). They further, argued that it clearly\ncontemplates that the legal representative of the partner,\nwho dies, would be under a duty to enter into a fresh deed\nof partnership. The legal representatives were precluded\nfrom claiming benefits if they deny entering into a fresh\npartnership agreement.\n\n27.\nIn order to arrive at the conclusion that the\npartnership firm stood dissolved on account of death of\none of the partners, the High Court had rightly placed\nreliance on\nSmt. S. Parvathammal v. CIT\n(1987) 163 ITR\n161 (Mad.), wherein this Court held that in a firm\nconsisting of two partners on account of death of one of\nthe partners, the firm automatically dissolved and\nobserved as follows: (ITR pp.161-62)\n\".... a partnership normally dissolves on the death of\nthe partner unless there was an agreement in the\noriginal partnership deed. Even assuming that there\nwas such an agreement in a partnership consisting of\ntwo partners, on the death of one of them the\npartnership automatically comes to an end and there\nis no partnership which survives and into which a third\nparty can be introduced. Hence on the death of S, the\noriginal partnership was dissolved. The subsequent\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (29 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\ntaking in of the assessee as a partner was only as a\nresult of entering into of a new partnership between R\nand the assessee. Partnership was not a matter of\nheritable status but purely one of contract.\"\nIn the light of aforementioned case, it is clear that when\nthere are only two partners constituting the partnership\nfirm, on the death of one of them, the firm is deemed to\nbe dissolved despite the existence of a clause which says\notherwise. A partnership is a contract between the\npartners. There cannot be any contract unilaterally without\nthe acceptance by the other partner.\n\n28. The Appellants, the legal representatives of original\nplaintiff (since deceased) was not at all interested in\ncontinuing the firm or constitute a fresh firm and they\ncannot be asked to continue the partnership, as there is no\nlegal obligation upon them to do so as partnership is not a\nmatter of heritable status but purely one of contract,\nwhich is also clear from the definition of partnership under\n\nSection 4\n. Therefore, the trial court was justified in holding\nthat the firm dissolved by virtue of death of one of the\npartners and the first appellate court as well as the High\nCourt have taken the correct view in upholding the same.\"\n\n19. In view of the aforesaid decision, the legal position is\n\ncrystal clear that irrespective of any clause in the partnership\n\ndeed between the two partners, to keep alive the partnership\n\neven after death of one of the partners, upon death of one of the\n\npartners, the partnership stands dissolved by operation of law.\n\n20. However, the crucial question for determination would be\n\nwhether despite dissolution of the firm, the arbitration clause\n\ncontained in the partnership deed would still survive and binding\n\non the legal representatives of the deceased partner, for the\n\npurposes of the Act of 1996. The legal position in this regard is\n\nfully explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ravi\n\nPrakash Goel Versus Chandra Prakash Goel & Another,\n\n(2008) 13 Supreme Court Cases 667. The issues which arose\n\nfor consideration and answered, were as below:-\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (30 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n\"16. On the above pleadings, the following questions of law\nemerge for our consideration:\n\n(a) Where right to sue for rendition of accounts survives\non the legal legal representative of a deceased partner,\nare the legal representatives not entitled to invoke\narbitration clause contained in the Partnership Deed?\n\n(b) Whether the arbitration can be commenced by the\nheirs after the death of partner especially where the\ndispute had arisen already during the life time of the\npartner?\n\n(c) Whether in view of\nsection 46\nread with\nsection 48\nof\nthe Indian Partnership Act as well as\nsection 40\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1999, the petitioner is entitled to claim\nappointment of arbitrator under the arbitration clause of\nthe Partnership Deed and the Hon'ble Chief Justice of the\nAllahabad High Court has erred in overlooking these\nprovisions?\"\n\nThe legal position with reference to provisions contained\n\nboth in the Act of 1932 and the Act of 1996 was examined by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court which reads as below:-\n\n\"17. Before we proceed further, it is useful to reproduce\n\nSection 40\nof the Arbitration Act and\nSections 46\n,\nand\nof the Indian Partnership Act:\n\n\"40. Arbitration agreement not to be discharged by death\nof party thereto.- (1) An arbitration agreement shall not\nbe discharged by the death of any party thereto either as\nrespects the deceased or as respects any other party, but\nshall in such event be enforceable by or against the legal\nrepresentative of the deceased.\n\n(2) The mandate of an arbitrator shall not be terminated\nby the death of any party by whom he was appointed.\n(3) Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of\nany law by virtue of which any right of action is\nextinguished by the death of a person.\"\n\n* * * *\n\"46. Right of partners to have business wound up after\ndissolution.- On the dissolution of a firm every partner or\nhis representative is entitled, as against all the other\npartners or their representatives, to have the property of\nthe firm applied in payment of the debts and liabilities of\nthe firm, and to have the surplus distributed among the\npartners or their representatives according to their rights.\n\n47. Continuing authority of partners for purposes of\nwinding up.- After the dissolution of a firm the authority\nof each partner to bind the firm, and the other mutual\nrights and obligations of the partners, continue\nnotwithstanding the dissolution, so far as may be\nnecessary to wind up the affairs of the firm and to\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (31 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\ncomplete transactions begun but unfinished at the time of\nthe dissolution, but not otherwise:\n\nProvided that the firm is in no case bound by the\nacts of a partner who has been adjudicated insolvent; but\nthis proviso does not affect the liability of any person\nwho has after the adjudication represented himself or\nknowingly permitted himself to be represented as a\npartner of the insolvent.\n\n48. Mode of settlement of accounts between partners.- In\nsettling the accounts of a firm after dissolution, the\nfollowing rules shall, subject to agreement by the\npartners, be observed :-\n\n(a) losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be\npaid first out of profits, next out of capital, and\nlastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in\nthe proportions in which they were entitled to share\nprofits;\n\n(b) the assets of the firm, including any sums\ncontributed by the partners to make up deficiencies\nof capital, shall be applied in the following manner\nand order-\n\n(i) in paying the debts of the firm to third parties;\n\n(ii) in paying to each partner rateably what is due\nto him from the firm for advances as\ndistinguished from capital;\n\n(iii) in paying to each partner rateably what is due\nto him on account of capital; and\n\n(iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among\nthe partners in the proportions in which they were\nentitled to share profits.\"\n\n18. It is clear from\nSection 40\nof the Arbitration Act that an\narbitration agreement is not discharged by the death of any\nparty thereto and on such death it is enforceable by or\nagainst the legal representatives of the deceased, nor is the\nauthority of the arbitrator revoked by the death of the party\nappointing him, subject to the operation of any law by virtue\nof which the death of a person extinguishes the right of\naction of that person.\n\n19.\nSection 2(1)(g)\ndefines \"legal representative\" which\nreads thus:\n\n\"2. (1)(g) \"Legal Representative\" means a person who\nin law represents the estate of a deceased person, and\nincludes any person who intermeddles with the estate\nof the deceased person, and, where a party acts in a\nrepresentative character, the person on whom the\nestate develops on the death of the party so acting;\"\n\n20. The definition of 'legal representative' became necessary\nbecause such representatives are bound by and also entitled\nto enforce an arbitration agreement.\nSection 40\nclearly says\nthat an arbitration agreement is not discharged by the death\nof a party. The agreement remains enforceable by or against\nthe legal representatives of the deceased. In our opinion, a\nperson who has the right to represent the estate of deceased\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (32 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nperson occupies the status of a legal person (sic\nrepresentative).\nSection 35\nof the 1996 Act which imparts the\ntouch of finality to an arbitral award says that the award shall\nhave binding effect on the \"parties and persons claiming\nunder them\". Persons claiming under the rights of a deceased\nperson are the personal representative of the deceased party\nand they have the right to enforce the award and are also\nbound by it. The arbitration agreement is enforceable by or\nagainst the legal representative of a deceased party provided\nthe right to sue in respect of the cause of action survives.\n\n21. We have already extracted\nSections 46\n,\n&\nof the\nPartnership Act.\nSection 46\nprovides two things, namely, first\nis to realize the assets of the business and then to apply the\nsame for discharge of liabilities and finally to distribute the\nsurplus, if any, among the partners. All that\nSection 46\n\nempowers is that every partner shall claim that this is to be\ndone for ultimate distribution of the surplus to the partners\naccording to their shares. A suit to enforce the latter right\nrelating to the distribution of surplus is generally called a suit\nfor an account which means account taken up accordingly.\nThis right to a partner to file a suit for account is not affected\nby the fact that the retiring partner has already inspected the\naccounts of the firm.\nSection 46\nis, however, merely\ndeclaratory of the rights of the partners or their legal\nrepresentatives in the surplus and does not set out the mode\nof calculating the surplus. The share of a partner upon the\nwinding up of a dissolved firm, is only in the residue which is\nleft after the liabilities mentioned in the various clauses of\n\nSection 48\nhave been paid out. Payment of capital and\nadvances to partners is not out of the residue. The amount\npaid as capital investment to a partner will have to be\ndeducted in order to find the value of the residue, because the\nvalue of a partner's share is only his proportion of the residue.\n\n22. \"Right of Representative of a Partner.- The right of a\nrepresentative of a partner is really a claim against the\nsurplus assets on realisation-whether the surplus consists\nentirely of the proceeds of realisation or whether they\ninclude some specific items of property, which existed on\nthe death of the partner. The proper remedy of a partner\nin the circumstances is to have accounts taken to\nascertain his share and if the right to sue for accounts is\nbarred by limitation, the partner cannot sue any partner\nin possession of the assets for a share therein, and the\nlimitation will be governed by\nArt.5\nof the Limitation Act.\"\n\n23. On the dissolution of the firm, the arbitration clause\ndoes not come to an end and so if a dispute had arisen\nduring the lifetime of the deceased partner, his legal\nrepresentatives would be entitled to take proceedings under\n\nSection 20\nof the Arbitration Act, 1940.\n\n24. When a partner dies and the partnership comes to an\nend it is not only right but also the duty of the surviving\npartner to realize the assets for the purpose of winding up of\nthe partnership affairs including the payment of the\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (33 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\npartnership debts. However, it is true that in a general sense\nthe executors or administrators of the deceased partner may\nbe said to have a lien upon the partnership assets in respect\nof his interest in the partnership and taking the partnership\naccount.\n\n25.\nSection 47\n: It is clear that the commencement of the\ndissolution does not at once terminate the authority of the\npartners. Such authority continues at least for 2 purposes,\nnamely, (1) so far as necessary to wind up the affairs of the\nfirm; and (2) to complete the transaction begun but had not\nyet been completed.\n\n26.\nSection 48\n: It lays down two fundamental propositions\nwhich are in line of the provisions of\nSection 46\nof the\nPartnership Act, namely, (1) as to the payment of the losses;\nand (2) as to the application of the assets. It is to be noted\nthat the provisions of\nSection 48\nare the culmination of the\nprovisions of\nSection 46\nof the Partnership Act. Therefore,\nboth the sections have to be harmoniously read together and\ninterpreted.\n\n27. We are of the opinion that in view of the provisions of\n\nSection 46\nread with\nSection 48\nof the Indian Partnership Act\nas well as\nSection 40\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996, the application for appointment of an arbitrator under\nthe arbitration clause of the partnership deed was liable to be\nallowed and the learned Chief Justice has erred in overlooking\nthe said provisions. While right to sue for rendition of\naccounts of partnership firm survives on the legal\nrepresentative of a deceased partner, he is also entitled to\ninvoke the arbitration clause contained in the partnership\ndeed.\"\n\n21. Though decisions of various High Courts on this aspect have\n\nalso been cited before this Court, it is not necessary to burden\n\nthe view of this Court with other authorities in view of\n\nauthoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of\nRavi Prakash Goel\n(Supra). Therefore, the submissions\n\nof learned counsel for the respondents that after the death of Sita\n\nDevi Verma, there does not exist any arbitration agreement so as\n\nto entitle the applicant to seek appointment of an arbitrator in the\n\nmatter of dispute fails and is hereby rejected, particularly when\n\nno other ground to assail existence and/or validity of the\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (34 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nagreement has been put forth by the respondent except death of\n\nSita Devi Verma.\n\n22. The next issue arising for consideration would be whether the\n\ndispute is non-arbitrable. Contents of the application seeking\n\nappointment of arbitrator and the notice for appointment of\n\narbitrator reveal that even while Sita Devi Verma was alive, a\n\ndispute in relation to operation of the accounts of the firm M/s.\n\nVerma & Company had arisen on account of letter sent by Sita\n\nDevi Verma to the bank to freeze the accounts of the firm though\n\naccording to the applicant later on, she had withdrawn such a\n\nrequest and consented for operation of the accounts. It is also\n\nrevealed that the bank has also given legal notice to the firm and\n\nthe legal representatives of the deceased Sita Devi Verma. The\n\napplicant seeks adjudication on mutual rights and duties of the\n\npartnership firm and determination thereof as the bank has sent a\n\nlegal notice for realisation of the loan advanced to the bank. The\n\napplicant's claim is that all the partners are entitled to equal\n\nshare in the loss and profit in the absence of there being any\n\nagreement in that regard and partners are jointly and severely\n\nliable for all acts of the firm done. According to the applicant, all\n\nthe disputes with regard to the rights and liabilities are required\n\nto be determined through appropriate proceedings and, therefore,\n\nlegal notice was given seeking appointment of an arbitrator. The\n\nlegal representatives of the deceased are in possession of the\n\nestate of the deceased Sita Devi Verma.\n\n23. Applying test of non-arbitrability as laid down succinctly by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in plethora of decisions referred to\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (35 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nherein above, and applying \"Eye of the needle\" test, it cannot be\n\nheld that the present case is classifiable as \"non-arbitrable\n\ndispute\".\n\n24. In a recent judicial pronouncement in the case of VGP\n\nMarine Kingdom Private Limited and Another Versus Kay\n\nEllen Arnold, (2023) 1 Supreme Court Cases 597, the legal\n\nposition, as discussed in detailed herein above was reiterated as\n\nbelow:-\n\n\"11. ...............As per the decision of this Court in the case of\nVidya Drolia & Others (supra) unless on the facet it is found\nthat the dispute is not arbitrable and if it requires\nfurther/deeper consideration, the dispute with respect to the\narbitrability should be left to the arbitrator. The decision of\nthis Court in the case of Vidya Drolia & Others (supra) is a\nthree judges' bench subsequent decision in which the entire\nlaw on the scope and ambit of the Court at the stage of\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, 1996 has been\ndealt with and considered by the Court.\"\n\nIn another recent judicial pronouncement in the case of\n\nMeenakshi Solar Power Pvt. Ltd. Versus Abhyudaya Green\n\nEconomic Zones Pvt. Ltd, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1616, the\n\nlegal position, relying upon dictum in Vidya Drolia & Others\n\n(Supra), was reaffirmed as below:-\n\n\"17. Further, this Court observed that the court at the\nreferral stage can interfere only when it is manifest that the\nclaims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no\nsubsisting dispute. In the context of issue of limitation\nperiod, it should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for\ndecision on merits. Similar would be the position in case of\ndisputed \"no-claim certificate\" or defence on the plea of\nnovation and \"accord and satisfaction\"\n\n25. The legal position that when contention relating to non-\n\narbitrability are plainly arguable or when facts are contested,\n\nCourt would prefer to refer the matter for arbitration while\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (36 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\nconsidering an application for appointment of an arbitrator under\n\nSection 11\nof he Act of 1996 has been authoritatively settled in\n\nnot only Vidya Drolia & Others (Supra), but also many other\n\ndecisions including Mohammed Masroor Shaikh Versus\n\nBharat Bhushan Gupta & Others, (2022) 4 Supreme Court\n\nCases 156 wherein, following pertinent observations were\n\nmade:-\n\n\"19. Thus, this Court held that while dealing with petition\nunder\nSection 11\n, the Court by default would refer the\nmatter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are\nplainly arguable. In such case, the issue of non-arbitrability\nis left open to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. On perusal\nof the impugned order, we find that the issues of non-\narbitrability and the claim being time barred have not been\nconcluded by the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High\nCourt. In fact, in clause (vii) of the operative part of the\nimpugned Order, the learned Single Judge has observed that\nthe contentions of the parties have been kept open. The\npetitions filed by the appellant under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act, challenging the Order dated 25-5-2021 are\npending before the High Court in which the appellant can\nraise all permissible contentions.\"\n\nSimilar are the observations made in plethora of decisions\n\nwhich were quoted with approval in the case of Sanjiv Prakash\n\nVersus Seema Kukreja and Others, (2021) 9 Supreme\n\nCourt Cases 732, which reads as below:-\n\n\"20. The Court in Vidya Drolia & Others (supra) then\nconcluded, on the facts of that case, that it would be unsafe\nto conclude one way or the other that an arbitration\nagreement exists between the parties on a prima facie\nreview of facts of that case, and that a deeper consideration\nmust be left to an arbitrator, who is to examine the\ndocumentary and oral evidence and then arrive at a\nconclusion.\n\n21. Likewise, in\nBharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Nortel\nNetworks India Pvt. Ltd.\n, (2021) 5 SCC 738, another Division\nBench of this Court referred to Vidya Drolia & Others (supra)\nand concluded:(BSNL) (Supra), SCC pp. 765-66, paras 46-\n\n47)\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\n[2023:RJ-JP:41479] (37 of 37) [ARBAP-104/2022]\n\n\"46.The upshot of the judgment in\nVidya Drolia &\nOthers v. Durga Trading Corporation\n, (2021) 2 SCC 1 is\naffirmation of the position of law expounded in\nDuro\nFelguera, S.A.\n(Supra) and\nMayavati Trading (P) Ltd.\n\n(Supra), which continue to hold the field.\n\nIt must be\nunderstood clearly that\nVidya Drolia & Others\n(Supra)\nhas not resurrected the pre-amendment position on the\nscope of power as held in SBP & Co. v. Patel\nEngineering SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (Supra).\n\n47. It is only in the very limited category of cases,\nwhere there is not even a vestige of doubt that the\nclaim is ex facie time- barred, or that the dispute is\nnon-arbitrable, that the court may decline to make the\nreference. However, if there is even the slightest doubt,\nthe rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise\nit would encroach upon what is essentially a matter to\nbe determined by the tribunal.\"\n\n22. On the contrary, a\nSection 11\ncourt would refer the\nmatter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are\nplainly arguable, or when facts are contested. The court\ncannot, at this stage, enter into a mini trial or elaborate\nreview of the facts and law which would usurp the\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.\"\n\n26. Resultantly, the application seeking appointment of an\n\narbitrator is required to be allowed and the same is, accordingly,\n\nallowed. Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.K. Agarwal (Retd.), C-82, Ram\n\nNagar, Shastri Nagar, Jaipur is appointed as the Sole Arbitrator to\n\nadjudicate upon the dispute between the parties and pass an\n\naward. The Sole Arbitrator shall be entitled to fee, as provided\n\nunder Fourth Schedule appended to the Act of 1996.\n\n27. The Registry is directed to intimate Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.K.\n\nAgarwal (Retd.) regarding his appointment as Sole Arbitrator. The\n\nparties are also directed to intimate the Sole Arbitrator towards\n\ncommencement of arbitral proceedings in accordance with law.\n\n(MANINDRA MOHAN SHRIVASTAVA),CJ\n\nSANJAY KUMAWAT-15\n\n(Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:32 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
