Case set up by Learned Counsel for the\n\npetitioner is that her husband, Late Shri Jagat Ram\n\nwas engaged as Beldar in Irrigation & Public Health\n\nDepartment, Division Arki, District Solan, Himachal\n\nPradesh in the year 1994 and he continued as such\n\nunder the Respondents. Though late husband of\n\nthe petitioner became eligible and entitled for conferment\n\nof work charge status on completion of eight years\n\nof continuous service but, the said benefit was denied\n\nto her late husband, who ultimately expired while serving\n\non daily wage basis on 17.03.2007.\n\n2(i). After the death of her late husband\n\nShri Jagat Ram on 17.03.2007, the present petitioner,\n\nfiled an Original Application No.4699 of 2015, titled as\n\nSatya Devi Versus State of Himachal Pradesh and others,\n\npraying for conferment of work charge status in terms\n\nof the mandate of this Court in CWP No.2735 of 2010,\n\ntitled as Rakesh Kumar Versus State of H.P. &\n\nors. alongwith connected matters, decided on\n\n28.07.2010. In terms of order dated 10.05.2016\n\n -3- [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n[Annexure R-1], the work charge status was granted to\n\nthe petitioner's husband, late Shri Jagat Ram,\n\nposthumously w.e.f. 01.01.2002, as Beldar, in the pay\n\nscale of Rs.2520-4140 by the Respondents. After\n\nconferment of regularization/work charge status, the\n\npetitioner had filed the instant petition, on 21.09.2016,\n\npraying for grant of family pension to the petitioner,\n\nbeing widow of late Shri Jagat Ram [supra], with all\n\nconsequential benefits incidental thereof.\n\n PROCEEDINGS BEFORE STATE\n ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL AND BEFORE THIS\n COURT:\n\n2(ii). Petitioner had filed an Original Application\n\nNo.4828 of 2016 before the State Administrative\n\nTribunal in which notices were issued on 22.09.2016\n\ndirecting the respondents to file reply.\n\n STAND OF STATE AUTHORITIES IN REPLY-\n AFFIDAVIT:\n\n3. Pursuant to issuance of notice, Respondents\n\nNo.1 to 4 have filed Reply dated 26.11.2016 on the\n\naffidavit of Superintending Engineer, Irrigation &\n\nPublic Health Department, Circle, Shimla-9.\n\n3(i). A perusal of Reply-Affidavit admits the\n\n -4- [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nfactual matrix of the case that the husband of the\n\npetitioner, late Shri Jagat Ram was engaged as\n\nBeldar in the year 1994 and he expired during service\n\non 17.03.2007. Reply-Affidavit further indicates that\n\npursuant to filing of a petition by present petitioner,\n\nthe case of late Shri Jagat Ram, husband of petitioner\n\nwas considered and found eligible for grant of work\n\ncharge status w.e.f. 01.01.2002, on completion of\n\neight years of continuous service from 1994 to\n\n30.12.2001. Reply-Affidavit further indicated that as\n\nper orders dated 10.05.2016, Annexure R-1, husband of\n\nthe petitioner, late Shri Jagat Ram was regularized as\n\nwork charge Beldar w.e.f. 01.01.2002, in the pay scale\n\nof Rs.2520-4140 posthumously [having expired on\n\n17.03.2007]. Reply-Affidavit further indicates that\n\nafter having been conferred regular/work charge\n\nstatus w.e.f. 01.01.2002 as per orders dated 10.05.2016,\n\nAnnexure R-1, petitioner, who was governed by\n\nFundamental Rule [FR]-56 had a right to continue in\n\nservice upto the age of superannuation of 58 years\n\non 30.06.2006 and accordingly since the petitioner\n\n -5- [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nhad continued in service as daily wager, till his death on\n\n17.03.2007, therefore, the respondents issued order\n\non 02.06.2016, Annexure R-2, treating the petitioner's\n\nhusband to have been deemed retired from service\n\nw.e.f. 30.06.2006. The Executive Engineer, Irrigation\n\n& Public Health Department, Division issued another\n\norder dated 07.11.2016, Annexure R-3, whereby, the\n\nperiod beyond the deemed date of retirement on\n\n30.06.2006 till his death on 17.03.2007 was treated\n\nas period of re-employment on daily wage basis. This\n\norder further indicated that this period [i.e. 30.06.2006\n\nto 17.03.2007] shall not be counted for pensionary\n\nor other retiral benefits.\n\n3(ii). So far as the claim of the present petitioner,\n\nSatya Devi, for family pension is concerned, Reply-\n\nAffidavit indicated that petitioner is not entitled for\n\ngrant of pension/family pension as her husband had\n\nrendered 4 years and 6 months service on work\n\ncharge basis which was short of 10 years of regular\n\nservice and, therefore, the petitioner was not eligible\n\nfor family pension under the Central Civil Services\n\n -6- [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n[Pension] Rules, {in short 'CCS [Pension] Rules'} In\n\nPara 6(i) of Reply-Affidavit, Respondents had stated that\n\nfamily pension was admissible only in two cases,\n\nwhen, a Government official is drawing a pension after\n\nhis death and then, his family becomes eligible for family\n\npension and, secondly, when the person is working\n\non regular basis and he dies while in service. In this\n\nbackground, a prayer has been made for dismissing the\n\ninstant writ petition.\n\n REBUTTAL BY PETITIONER:\n\n4. Petitioner, Satya Devi, had filed a rejoinder\n\non 29.04.2024 stating that petitioner's husband\n\nhad rendered more than six years' service till\n\nhis death on 17.03.2007. Rejoinder-Affidavit indicates\n\nthat as per Family Pension Rules, if a Government\n\nservant has rendered more than one year's service on the\n\ndate of death, without being medically examined then,\n\nthe family pension was admissible to legal heirs/eligible\n\nfamily members. It is further averred in the rejoinder,\n\nthat based on similar fact situation, benefit of family\n\npension has been given to another widow, namely,\n\n -7- [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nKalawati, in CWP(T) No.8894 of 2008 and the aforesaid\n\njudgment has attained finality.\n\n EARLIER ROUND OF LITIGATION IN INSTANT\n CASE:\n\n5. Material on record indicates that instant\n\nCWPOA No.267 of 2020 [originating from OA\n\nNo.4828 of 2016] was decided by this Court on\n\n16.10.2020 but, the State Authorities filed a Review\n\nPetition No.239 of 2022, titled as State of Himachal\n\nPradesh and others Versus Smt. Satya Devi and\n\nanother, which was decided by a Division Bench of\n\nthis Court on 28.11.2022, whereby the judgment dated\n\n16.10.2020 was reviewed and CWPOA No.267 of 2020\n\nwas restored to file and was directed to be listed\n\nafter three weeks.\n\n6. Heard, Mr. A.K. Gupta, Advocate for the\n\npetitioner and Mr. Anup Rattan, Learned Advocate\n\nGeneral assisted by Mr. Manoj Chauhan, Learned\n\nAdditional Advocate General, for the Respondents.\n\n STATUTORY PROVISIONS:\n\n7.

Taking into account the entirety of facts\n\nand circumstances, this Court is of the considered\n\nview that claim of present petitioner, Satya Devi, for\n\nfamily pension on account of death of her late\n\nhusband, Shri Jagat Ram on 17.03.2007 during service\n\ncarries weight; entitling the petitioner for family pension\n\nw.e.f. 17.03.2007, for the following reasons:-\n\n8(i). Petitioner's husband, late Shri Jagat\n\nRam, was engaged as daily wage Beldar in 1994\n\nand he served as such with continuous service\n\nupto 31.12.2001. He completed eight years of continuous\n\nservice and became eligible for regularization/conferment\n\nof work charge status, on completion of eight years of\n\nservice w.e.f. 01.01.2002. This benefit was denied to the\n\npetitioner's husband till his death on 17.03.2007.\n\nHowever, after filing of a petition by the present\n\npetitioner i.e. OA No.4699 of 2015 and in compliance\n\nthereto, the Executive Engineer, Irrigation and Public\n\nHealth Department, Division Arki, District Solan,\n\nHimachal Pradesh, passed order dated 10.05.2016,\n\nAnnexure R-1, regularizing and giving the work charge\n\n - 13 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nstatus to petitioner's husband posthumously w.e.f.\n\n01.01.2002 till 17.03.2007 [i.e. the date he expired].\n\nRespondent-Executive Engineer issued an order on\n\n02.06.2016, Annexure R-2, whereby, the petitioner's\n\nhusband, late Shri Jagat Ram, was deemed to have\n\nretired from service on 30.06.2006 i.e. the date on\n\nwhich he attained the age of fifty-eight years. Another\n\norder was issued on 07.11.2016, Annexure R-3, whereby,\n\nthe period from 30.06.2006 till 17.03.2007 was\n\ndirected not to be counted for any pensionary or other\n\nretiral benefits. At this stage, it is important to note\n\nthat since petitioner's husband was engaged in service\n\non daily wage basis prior to 10.05.2001 then, in\n\nterms of Full Bench mandate of this Court, in CWP\n\nNo.2711 of 2017, titled as Baldev Versus State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh and others, the petitioner's\n\nhusband, late Shri Jagat Ram, had a right to continue\n\nupto the age of sixty years or in this case till his death\n\non 17.03.2007 [i.e. beyond the age of 58 years on\n\n30.06.2006 to 17.03.2007] and such, the entire\n\nperiod was countable as service period for extending\n\n - 14 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nbenefit of pension/family pension as the case may be. In\n\nthis background, the service rendered by the petitioner's\n\nhusband, Late Shri Jagat Ram, is to be treated as\n\nregular/work charge employee [w.e.f. 01.01.2002 till\n\nhis death on 17.03.2007] comes to five years and three\n\nmonths.\n\n8(ii). Indisputably, once the petitioner's\n\nhusband, late Shri Jagat Ram, had rendered five\n\nyears and three months of service from 01.01.2002\n\ntill his death on 17.03.2007, therefore, in terms of\n\nFR-56 and the mandate of Full Bench judgment of this\n\nCourt, in the case of Baldev [supra], the present\n\npetitioner widow is eligible, for family pension\n\nin terms of FR-54 (2) (a) of CCS [Pension] Rules by\n\ntaking into account that the petitioner's husband had\n\ndied \"after completion of one year's continuous service.\"\n\nMoreover, as per Rule 54 (14) of CCS [Pension]\n\nRules, expression \"continuous service\", means the\n\nservice rendered in temporary capacity in a pensionable\n\nestablishment. An exception has been carved out, to\n\nRule 54 (14) of CCS [Pension] Rules, even if the\n\n - 15 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nemployees had died after one year's continuous\n\nservice yet the family pension can be denied if,\n\nsuch continuous service is not in a pensionable\n\nestablishment; and during such service the deceased\n\nemployee was not under suspension; and such\n\ncontinuous service was rendered before attaining the\n\nage of eighteen years. Similar ineligibility is carved\n\nout in Rule 54 (13-B), denying family pension, in\n\ncase, the person claiming family pension is already\n\nin receipt of family pension or is eligible therefor\n\nunder any other Rules of Central/State Government\n\nand/or PSU or Autonomous body/Local Body under\n\nCentral/State Government.\n\n In this backdrop, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered view, that once the petitioner's husband,\n\nlate Shri Jagat Ram, had died after rendering one\n\nyear's continuous service [from 01.01.2002 till his\n\ndeath on 17.03.2007]; coupled with the fact that\n\nduring such service, petitioner's husband was neither\n\nunder suspension nor such service was rendered\n\nbefore attaining the age of eighteen and the petitioner\n\n - 16 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nis neither in receipt of nor is she eligible for family\n\npension under any other Rules [under Rule 54 (14)\n\nor 54 (13-B) of CCS Pension Rules] but the service\n\nwas rendered by the petitioner's husband in a\n\npensionable establishment; then, the present petitioner\n\nwho does not fall under any of the ineligibility\n\nor disqualifying conditions; and therefore, in these\n\ncircumstances, the petitioner-widow widow is eligible\n\nand is held entitled for family pension from the\n\ndate of death of her husband on 17.03.2007.\n\n8(iii). The admissibility of family pension under\n\nRule 54 of CCS [Pension] Rules has merit, in view\n\nof the fact that petitioner being the widow of late\n\nShri Jagat Ram falls within the ambit of family\n\nunder Rule 54 (2) of CCS [Pension] Rules read\n\nwith Rule 54 (14) (b) of said Rules; coupled with the\n\nfact that the petitioner's husband had rendered more\n\nthan one year's continuous service, as referred to\n\nabove [from 01.01.2002 till his death on 17.03.2007]\n\nthen, the petitioner being the widow, is eligible\n\nand entitled for family pension w.e.f. date of death\n\n - 17 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nof her husband on 17.03.2007.\n\n8(iv). Eligibility and entitlement of family pension\n\nand the admissibility of family pension is a legal\n\nentitlement constituting property of family member\n\nof deceased including the present petitioner. Once\n\nRule 54 of CCS [Pension] Rules mandates for grant\n\nof family pension to eligible member of a family of\n\ndeceased employee, who dies after completion of one\n\nyear's continuous service and such the continuous\n\nservice is rendered in a temporary capacity in a\n\npensionable establishment and such service does not\n\nprecedes any stigma of suspension or such service\n\nwas not rendered before attaining the age of eighteen\n\nyears and there is no other provision in Rule 54\n\nof CCS [Pension] Rules, disentitling the present\n\npetitioner- widow for family pension, therefore, in these\n\ncircumstances, the denial of family pension, which\n\nis a property, within the meaning of \nArticle 300-A\n of\n\nthe Constitution of India being without authority of\n\nlaw cannot sustain. Moreover, the deprivation of family\n\npension without issuing prior notice, without affording\n\n - 18 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nan opportunity of personal hearing has visited\n\nthe petitioner with civil consequences resulting in\n\ndepriving the petitioner of her legal entitlement of\n\nfamily pension was 17.03.2007 till day, and the\n\nState action is not sustainable, in the eyes of law.\n\nAccordingly, denial of family pension to widow of\n\nlate Shri Jagat Ram on w.e.f. 17.03.2007, is quashed\n\nand set-aside.\n\n8(v). While dealing with similar situation,\n\nCo-ordinate Bench of this Court has allowed the\n\nfamily pension to one Kalawati being widow of late\n\nShri Roop Singh, work charge Beldar upon completion\n\nof one year's continuous service in CWP(T) No. 8894\n\nof 2008, titled as Smt. Kalawati Versus The State\n\nof Himachal Pradesh and others in the following\n\nterms:-\n\n \"The petitioner is the wife of deceased Roop\n Singh, who was working with the\n respondents. It is undisputed before me\n that deceased Roop Singh was offered a\n temporary post of Work-charged Beldar\n w.e.f. 1.1.1994 in the pay scale of Rs.770-\n 1410 vide Annexure R2 on the terms and\n conditions as submitted therein. It is also\n undisputed before me that deceased Roop\n Singh died on 25.2.1995 and that he joined\n his services as daily waged Beldar in\n\n - 19 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n H.P.PWD, Rajgarh on 1.1.1994. Learned\n counsel for the petitioner relies upon\n Rule 54 sub-rule (2) (a) of the CCS\n (Pension) Rules 1972 to urge that since\n the deceased has put more than one year\n service with the State Government, he\n was entitled to family pension.\n\n 2. This prayer is opposed by the learned\n Assistant Advocate General primarily on the\n ground that there is nothing on the record\n to establish that after issuance of Annexure\n R2, the deceased had actually joined service\n or not. I cannot accept this submission\n made on behalf of the respondents.\n According to the man-days chart (Annexure:\n\n R1) prepared by the respondents, the\n deceased reported for duty on January,\n 1994. There is nothing on the record placed\n by the respondents to show that the\n deceased Roop Singh had voluntarily\n abandoned services with the respondents.\n\n 3. In these circumstances, this writ petition\n is allowed. I direct that the petitioner be\n granted the family pension in accordance\n with the Rules applicable. Petition is\n disposed of. No order as to costs.\"\n\n In backdrop of the mandate of law in the\n\ncase of Kalawati [supra], once the petitioner, Satya\n\nDevi, being the widow of late Shri Jagat Ram is\n\nsimilarly placed and is eligible and entitled for family\n\npension under Rule 54 (2) (a) of CCS (Pension) Rules\n\nby taking into account one year's continuous service\n\nrendered by her deceased husband, then, the present\n\npetitioner being similarly placed, is entitled for the\n\n - 20 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nbenefit of said judgment in the instant case also.\n\n8(vi). The intent and object of family pension is\n\nto give breather to the family members of deceased,\n\nso as to enable the distressed family to eke out a\n\nliving due to demise of a government servant. Grant\n\nof family pension being socio-economic schemes is\n\naimed at ensuring decent standard of life in the\n\ndecember of life needs to be given a purposive and\n\nliberal interpretation, in favour of family members\n\nwho seek family pension in a case.\n\n8(vii). The intent and object of a family pension has\n\nbeen outlined by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nBhagwanti Versus Union of India and connected\n\nmatter, (1989) 4 SCC 397, in the following terms:-\n\n \"9. Pension is payable, as pointed out in\n several judgments of this Court, on the\n consideration of past service rendered\n by the Government servant. Payability of\n the family pension is basically on the\n self same consideration. Since pension\n is linked with past service and the\n avowed purpose of the Pension Rules is\n to provide sustenance in old age,\n distinction between marriage during service\n and marriage after retirement appears to be\n indeed arbitrary. There are instances where\n a Government servant contracts his first\n marriage after retirement. In these two cases\n before us, retirement had been at an early\n age. In the Subedar's case, he had retired\n\n - 21 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n after putting in 18 years of service and the\n Railway employee had retired prematurely\n at the age of 44. Premature or early\n retirement has indeed no relevance for\n deciding the point at issue. It is not the case\n of the Union of India and, perhaps there\n would have been no force in such contention\n if raised, that family pension is admissible\n on account of the fact that the spouse\n contributed to the efficiency of the\n Government servant during his service\n career. In most cases, marriage after\n retirement is done to provide protection,\n secure companionship and to secure support\n in old age. The consideration upon which\n pension proper is admissible or the benefit of\n the family pension has been extended do not\n justify the distinction envisaged in the\n definition of 'family' by keeping the post-\n retiral spouse out of it.\"\n\n8(viii). Claim for pension, including family pension\n\noriginating from Rules/OM not a bounty but is a\n\nsocial welfare measure payable to the distressed\n\nfamily member of the family of the deceased so\n\nas to maintain the family has been outlined by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court, in V. Sukumaran Versus\n\nState of Kerala and another, (2020) SCC 106, in\n\nthe following terms:-\n\n 1. Pension is succour for post-retirement\n period. It is not a bounty payable at will,\n but a social welfare measure as a post-\n\n retirement entitlement to maintain the\n dignity of the employee. The appellant\n has been claiming his entitlement for the\n last almost 13 years but unsuccessfully,\n despite having worked with Government\n\n - 22 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n departments in various capacities for about\n 32 years.\n\n \n18. Learned counsel for the appellant also\n sought to emphasise that pension is a\n right vested in a Government servant\n and is not a bounty payable at the will\n and pleasure of the Government as also\n that pension is a social welfare measure\n and a post retirement entitlement;\n something with which we began our\n order. (D.S. Nakara v.Union of \nIndia, U.P.\n Raghavendra Acharya v. State of Karnataka\n,\n \nDeokinandan Prasad v. The State of Bihar\n.}\n\n 22. We begin by, once again, emphasising that\n the pensionary provisions must be given\n a liberal construction as a social welfare\n measure. This does not imply that\n something can be given contrary to rules,\n but the very basis for grant of such\n pension must be kept in mind, i.e., to\n facilitate a retired Government employee\n to live with dignity in his winter of life\n and, thus, such benefit should not be\n unreasonably denied to an employee,\n more so on technicalities.\"\n\n9. Plea of the State Authorities in Reply-\n\nAffidavit is that petitioner's husband had died on\n\n17.03.2007 as a work charge Beldar and, therefore,\n\nfamily pension was not admissible to the present\n\npetitioner.\n\n9(i). Above plea of the State Authorities is\n\nnegativated in view of the provision of Rule 54 (2) (a)\n\nread with Rule 54 (14) (a) of CCS [Pension] Rules,\n\nwhich entitles a widow, including the petitioner for\n\n - 23 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nfamily pension, in case the employee had died after\n\nrendering one year's continuous service and such\n\ncontinuous service means service rendered in a\n\ntemporary capacity in pensionable establishment. In\n\nthese circumstances, once the petitioner's husband\n\nwas granted regularization/work charge status on\n\n10.05.2016 [Annexure R-1] posthumously; then, the\n\nservice w.e.f. 01.01.2002 till death on 17.03.2007\n\nby petitioner's husband, in a temporary capacity, in\n\na pensionable establishment makes present petitioner\n\n-widow as eligible and entitled for family pension.\n\nThe artificial classification sought to be invoked by\n\nState Authorities, by taking the plea that the work\n\ncharge service [from 01.01.2002 till death of her\n\nhusband on 17.03.2007] is not to be counted for\n\npension/family pension, is misconceived and devoid\n\nof any merit, for the following reason, that such work\n\ncharge service, is in a time scale of Rs.2520-4140,\n\nand is a service rendered or taken to be rendered in\n\na temporary capacity in a pensionable establishment.\n\nMoreover, pursuant to judgment passed by this Court\n\n \n- 24 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nin \nSukru Ram Vs. The State of H.P. and others\n\n[CWP No.6167 of 2012] decided on 06.03.2012 and\n\nin State of Himachal Pradesh & Others Versus\n\nSh. Matwar Singh & Another [CWP No.2384 of\n\n2018] decided on 18.12.2018, the service rendered\n\non work charge basis is held to be countable\n\nfor pension/family pension.\n The operative part of the\n\njudgment in case of Matwar Singh [supra] reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n \n\"The challenge laid in this writ petition is to\n the order dated 31st July, 2017, passed by\n the H.P. State Administrative Tribunal in\n O.A. No.6681 of 2016, titled as \nMatwar\n Singh versus State of Himachal Pradesh\n and Others\n, whereby the respondent's claim\n to count the work charge service towards\n qualifying service for the purpose of pension\n and other retiral benefits has been\n accepted.\n\n 2. The facts are not in dispute. The private\n respondent joined the petitioners'\n Department as daily waged worker in the\n year 1992 at Saraswati Nagar Range under\n the jurisdiction of the Divisional Forest\n Officer, Forest Division, Rohru, Distt.\n Shimla. He was subsequently conferred\n status of work charge employee w.e.f.\n 01.05.2002. His services were later on\n regularized as Forest Worker w.e.f.\n 06.09.2007 as per the policy of the\n State Government. It appears that the\n respondent's claim for grant of pension\n was declined on the ground that he did\n not possess the requisite qualifying\n service. It is in this backdrop that the\n\n - 25 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n respondent approached the Tribunal and\n his claim has been accepted.\n\n \n3. It is by now well settled that the work\n charge status followed by regular\n appointment has to be counted as a\n component of qualifying service for the\n purpose of pension and other retiral\n benefits. Executive instructions, if any,\n issued by the Finance Department to the\n contrary, are liable to be ignored/struck\n down, in the light of view taken by this\n Court in CWP No.6167 of 2017, titled\n \nSukru Ram vs. State of H.P. & others\n,\n decided on 6th March, 2013.\n \nA Full Bench\n of Punjab and Haryana High Court in\n \nKeshar Chand vs. State of Punjab\n\n through the Secretary P.W.D. B & R\n Chandigarh and others, (1988) 94(2) PLR\n 223, also dealt with an identical issue\n where Rule 3.17(ii) of the Punjab Civil\n Services Rules excluded the work charge\n service for the purpose of qualifying service.\n Setting aside the said Rule being violative of\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of\n India, it was held that the work charge\n service followed by regular appointment\n will count towards qualifying service for\n the purpose of pension and other retiral\n benefits. The aforesaid view was also\n confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\n 4. For the afore-stated reasons, we do not\n find any error in the impugned order passed\n by the Tribunal. Accordingly, the writ\n petition is dismissed alongwith pending\n application(s), if any.\"\n\n10. Learned State Counsel submits that the\n\nfamily pension cannot be granted as the service was\n\nrendered by petitioner's husband Late Shri Jagat Ram\n\nin a temporary-work charge capacity.\n\n10(i). For better analysis, a perusal of the\n - 26 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\ncommunication dated 25.11.1975 issued by Finance\n\nDepartment, which forms part of judgment, in case\n\nof Beli Ram Versus State of H.P. and another\n\n[CWPOA No.52 of 2019] decided on 10.09.2020, reads\n\nas under:-\n\n \"27. At this stage, a communication dated\n 25.11.1975 sent from the Secretary (PW)\n to the Government of Himachal Pradesh,\n to the Chief Engineers, HPPWD, is also\n relevant for reference, whereby with\n concurrence of Finance Department, it\n has been clarified that all work-charged\n employees, including temporary\n industrial workers, are to be treated to\n be part of pensionable establishment. The\n said communication is reproduced as\n under, for convenience:\n\n From\n\n The Secretary (PW) to the\n Government of Himachal Pradesh\n\n To\n\n The Chief Engineers,\n H.P.P.W.D. , Shimla-171001.\n\n Dated Shimla-171002, the 25th\n November, 1975.\n\n Subject: Extension of Family Pension\n Scheme 1964 to the temporary\n work charged staff.\n\n Sir,\n\n I am directed to refer to your\n letter No.PWD-133-(Pension)/75-10844, dated\n 30/8/75 and this Department Office Order\n No.1-18/69-PWD(Part), dated 4/4/1973 and to\n say that in C.P.W.D., the temporary Work\n Charge staff having been given option either to\n\n - 27 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\njoin the pensionary establishment or to be\nadmitted to or retain W.C Provident Fund, w.e.f.\n21-5-71, a question was raised that the\nbenefits of Family pension scheme, 1964\nmay be extended to all the temporary W.C.\nstaff of H.P.P.W.D. as admissible to their\ncounterparts in C.P.W.D.\n In this connection, the matter has\nbeen carefully considered. There was and is no\nC.P.F. Scheme in operation in Himachal\nPradesh. The Permanent W.C. staff under\nH.P.P.W.D. was extended the benefits of\nliberalized pension rules/gratuity, and family\npension Scheme, w.e.f. 18.11.60 and 1.1.64\nrespectively. This was in accordance with the\ndecision contained in. Government of India,\nMinistry of Finance (Department of Expenditure)\noffice memo. No. 17(5)-EV(A)/60, dated 18.1.60.\nThe Government of India vide their office\nmemorandum No.8.43(4)-EV(B)/71, dated\n1.5.71, in modification of the orders dated\n18.11.60 have extended the benefits to the\ntemporary W.C. staff to join the pensionable\nestablishment or be admitted to or retain\nContributory Provide Fund benefits \nreferred to\nabove\n.\n\n Since in Himachal Pradesh, the\ntemporary W.C. employees, falling in the\ncategory of industrial were not enjoying\nconcession of C.P.F benefits, and permanent\nW.C. employees were already entitled to\npensionary/family pension benefits which were\nextended to them with retrospective effect w.e.f.\n18.11 60 and 1.1.64 respectively. It is clarified\nthat all W.C. employees including temporary\nindustrial workers are to be treated to be\npart of the pensionable establishment.\n\n This issue with the concurrence\nof the Finance Department obtained vide\ntheir U.O. No.FIN(C)-A(9)-6/75-2703, dated\n21.10.75.\n\n Sd/-\n\n Under Secretary (PW)\n Government of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n29. Once work-charged status has been\nconferred upon an employee by the Department,\n\n - 28 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nwhich is a limb of Government of Himachal\nPradesh, then after doing so, the Department\ncannot take U-turn to deny the benefit of such\nstatus conferred upon the employee by the\nDepartment itself. Work-charged employee, in\neither of the Departments of Government of\nHimachal Pradesh, whether it is Public Works\nDepartment or Irrigation and Public Health\nDepartment or any other Department, like\npresent one. constitutes same class, i.e.\nwork-charged employee under the\nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh and when,\nas evident from the communication dated\n25.11.1975, work-charged employees in\nPublic Works Department, now bifurcated\ninto Public Works Department and Irrigation\n& Public Health Department, are treated to\nbe part of pensionary, establishments, the\nrespondents-Department cannot deny such\nbenefit to employees conferred work-charged\nstatus by the department itself. Therefore, it\ndoes not lie in the mouth of respondents that\nwork-charged employees in Department of\nRural Development are not to be treated as\npart of pensionary establishment. Such a\ndiscriminatory treatment to its similarly\nsituated employees, forming identical class, is\nnot expected from a democratic welfare State,\nbeing custodian or protector of Fundamental\nRights of its citizens, as such any\ndiscrimination, on this count, would be violated\nof \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n31. In the light of aforesaid discussion,\nparticularly pronouncements as well as\ncommunication dated 25.11.1975, referred\nsupra, it is held that the period of service\nrendered by a person as work charged\nemployee with any establishment of State of\nHimachal Pradesh is to be counted, as\nqualifying service for pensionary benefits,\nirrespective of the fact that the Department\nis having work charged establishment or not.\n\nIn addition, in terms of pronouncement of\nSupreme Court in \nSunder Singh\n's case. daily\nwaged service of 5 years will be treated\nequal to one year of regular service for pension\nand if on that basis. service is more than\n\n - 29 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n 8 years but less than 10 years, the service will\n be reckoned as ten years.\"\n\n \nEven the judgement in \nBeli Ram\n [supra]\n\nby Learned Single Judge, was assailed by State\n\nAuthorities, in LPA No.151 of 2021 and the same was\n\ndismissed on 09.08.2023, by the Co-ordinate Division\n\nBench of this Court.\n\n The above contention of Learned State\n\nCounsel is misconceived for the reason, that firstly\n\nas per the communication dated 25.11.1975, issued\n\nby Finance Department all work charge employees\n\nincluding temporary industrial workers are to be\n\ntreated to be part of pensionable establishment ; and\n\nsecondly, in terms of this communication once the\n\nservice rendered in work charge temporary capacity\n\nis countable for retiral benefits in Public Works\n\nDepartment therefore, similarly placed work charge\n\nemployees, who have rendered service in temporary\n\ncapacity in other Departments, including Irrigation\n\n& Public Health Departments are entitled to similar\n\ntreatment; and thirdly, an artificial distinction cannot\n\nbe permitted to be carved out by State Authorities,\n\n - 30 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nby extending benefit of work charge service rendered\n\nin temporary capacity for pensionable benefits in one\n\nDepartment but in denying it to similar or incumbents\n\nin the Irrigation and Public Health Department; and\n\nfourthly, this artificial distinction has no rationale\n\nwith the object sought to be achieved; and fifthly, the\n\nartificial distinction sought to be carved out amongst\n\none homogenous class of work charge incumbents\n\nwho have rendered service in temporary capacity,\n\nwithout any rationale, amounts to treating 'equals\n\nas unequal', results in defeating the Constitutional\n\nmandate of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n also; and lastly, on\n\nfacts of instant case, the service/deemed service of\n\nLate Shri Jagat Ram, the petitioner's husband as\n\nwork charge in temporary capacity, is to be counted\n\nfor pensionary benefits.\n\n11. Plea of the State Authorities in Para 6(i)\n\nof the Reply-Affidavit on merits, that family pension\n\nis admissible to a person when, a government servant\n\ndraws pension and after his death, family members\n\nbecomes eligible for family pension.\n\n \n- 31 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n The above plea set up in Reply-Affidavit,\n\nonly deals with the provision of Rule 54 (2) (6) of\n\nCCS [Pension] Rules, by ignoring the eligibility and\n\nentitlement of the petitioner for family pension under\n\nRule 54 (2) (a) and 54 (14) of the said Rules, on\n\naccount of the death of petitioner's husband during\n\nservice, after completion of one year's continuous\n\nservice. Thus, the stand of State Authorities, is not\n\ntenable and is therefore rejected.\n\n11(i). The Bombay High Court, while dealing with\n\nsimilar fact situation, has granted family pension\n\nto the widow of deceased, upon completion of one\n\nyear's continuous service, in \nUnion of India (UOI)\n\nVs. Smt. M.I. Solkar [Writ Petition No.7960\n of\n\n2003] [(2004) 02 BOM CK 0120 [(2004) 102 FLR\n\n591] decided on 09.02.2004, in the following terms:-\n\n \"7. A conjoint reading of these Rules makes\n it clear that whereas the other retiring\n employees have to put in at least 10\n years of service, in the case of a person\n suffering from invalidity, there is no such\n requirement under Rule 49(2)(c). It is also\n material to note that under Rule 54(2)\n when it comes to death of a government\n servant, it is provided in Sub-rule 2(a)\n that even where a government servant\n dies after completion of one year\n\n \n- 32 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n service, the family of the deceased is\n entitled to family pension as \nlaid down\n in\n the Rules, Even where a person dies\n before completion of one year, Sub-rule\n 2(aa) provides that his family may as\n well receive family pension provided of\n course a fitness certificate had been\n issued by the medical authority\n immediately prior to his appointment to\n the service.\n\n8. Mr. Karnik, learned counsel for the\n petitioner, submitted that there is no\n specific qualifying period of service provided\n for pension on validity. However, the\n concept of \"qualifying service\" as defined\n under Rule 3(q) provides that it means\n service rendered while on duty or otherwise\n which shall be taken into account for the\n purpose of pensions and gratuities\n admissible under these rules. As seen\n above, under Rule 49, which provides for\n amount of pension, Sub-rule (2) provides for\n three situations and as far as pension on\n invalidity is concerned, the Rule 49(2)(c)\n begins with the non-obstante clause and\n clearly provides that it shall not be less\n than the amount of family pension\n admissible under Rule 54(2). This being\n the position, since the deceased\n husband of the petitioner in the present\n case had suffered invalidity, may be\n before completion of 10 years of service,\n that cannot disentitle her from receiving\n the family pension. It is a welfare\n provision and it is a provision similar to\n a situation where a person dies after\n completion of one year service or even\n before that. These provisions are in\n consonance with the spirit of the\n directive principles of the Constitution\n and have to be read as such.\n\n9. Mr. Walia, learned counsel for the\n respondent, referred to a judgment of a\n Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in the\n case of Ex. Coost. \nBadan Singh v. Union of\n India\n, reported in III 2003(1) All India\n Services Law Journal 329, where a similar\n\n - 33 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n view has been taken by a Single Judge of\n the Delhi High Court to grant invalid\n pension where the service rendered was less\n than ten years and the petitioner had\n suffered from Aids. The Administrative\n Tribunal was, therefore, right in interpreting\n the relevant provisions in that light and has\n correctly come to the conclusion that the\n Original Application had to be allowed. We\n therefore do not find any error in the\n approach of the Administrative Tribunal.\n Petition is dismissed.\"\n\n11(ii). The Punjab and Haryana High Court, while\n\ndealing with similar fact-situation granted family\n\npension to a widow for one year's continuous\n\nservice rendered by her deceased husband, in \nNeeraj\n\nYadav and another vs. State of Haryana and\n\nothers\n [CWP No.8183 of 2009] decided on 12.10.2009\n\nin the following terms:-\n\n \"It is noticed that having been\n recommended for appointment on\n\n 18.9.2008, the petitioner was medically\n examined on 7.10.2008 and on the same\n date he joined the service. He died on\n 21.3.2009 and, thus, the petitioners are\n denied the compassionate assistance.\n\n Learned counsel for the petitioners\n would submit that the petitioners are\n entitled to the grant of family pension\n and the condition of completing one\n year continuous service can not be\n pressed in view of Rule 4 of Family\n Pension Rules. The counsel would refer\n to note under the Rules, as per which\n Family Pension can be granted before\n completion of one year continuous\n service, if the Government employee\n\n - 34 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nconcerned immediately prior to\nrecruitment to the service or post was\nexamined by the appropriate medical\nauthority and declared fit for the\nGovernment service. \nIn support, he has\nalso drawn my attention to the case\nof \nSmt.Savitri Devi Vs. the State of\nHaryana and others\n, 1996 (2) RSJ 854.\nThe Division Bench of this Court has\nclearly held that even if the deceased\ngovernment employee does not complete\none year of continuous service, his\ndependent would nevertheless be\nentitled to the grant of family pension\nprovided the deceased was medically\nexamined and found fit and medical\ncertificate of fitness was produced before\nentering into Government service. The right\nof the petitioner to make a claim for family\npension, thus, is apparently covered by the\nratio of law \nlaid down in\n Smt. Savitri Devi's\ncase (supra).\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has\ndrawn my attention to another Division\nBench judgment passed by this Court in\nthe case of \nSharmila Devi Vs. Uttar\nHaryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited\n,\n2002 (4) SCT 178. Similar view has been\ntaken by the Division Bench of this Court so\nfar as eligibility of completing qualifying\nservice of one year for grant of family\npension is concerned. It is held that even if\nthe deceased Government employee does not\ncomplete one year continuous service, his\ndependent would still be entitled to grant of\nfamily pension provided he was found\nmedically fit at the time of appointment. The\nRule does not envisage any such condition of\none year qualifying service.\n \nWhile taking\nthis view, the \nratio \nlaid down in\n \nSavitri\nDevi\n's case (supra) has been followed.\n\nTaking the similar view, Civil Writ Petition\nNo.3515 of CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.8183\nOF 2009 :{ 6 }: 2009 \nMahender Kaur Vs.\nState of Haryana and others\n), was allowed\nby this Court on 5.10.2009.\n\n \n- 35 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n Following the \nratio \nlaid down in\n the\n above-noted cases, it is held that the\n petitioners would be entitled to the\n grant of family pension even when\n husband of petitioner No.1 had not\n completed one year continuous service\n as prior to his joining, her husband had\n appeared for medical examination and had\n been offered appointment only on having\n been found fit. Order Annexure P-2 would\n show that the petitioner was appointed after\n having been declared medically fit. Once the\n petitioners are held entitled to grant of\n family pension, they would be eligible for\n grant of compassionate financial assistance\n in terms of the Rules as they would be\n eligible under Rule 3, which reads as\n under:-\n\n \"Eligibility. 3. The eligibility to receive\n financial assistance, these rules shall\n be as per the provision in pension/\n family pension scheme 1964.\"\n\n The writ petition is accordingly allowed.\n Direction is issued to the respondent-State\n to grant compassionate financial assistance\n to the petitioners under the Rules. Needless\n to mention that the petitioners would\n also be entitled to the family pension\n though in terms of the Rules.\"\n\n11(iii). While dealing with the claim for pension,\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court held in \nUnion of India\n\nand others Vs. Meena Devi [CWP No.34\n of 2014]\n\ndecided on 23.07.2018 that it would be travesty of\n\njustice to deny family pension/retirement benefits\n\nsimply on the ground, that deceased employee was\n\nnot a permanent employee of the Department, in\n\n - 36 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nthe following terms:-\n\n \n\"12. There is also on record a judgment, dated\n 3rd October, 2013, passed by the Division\n Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court\n in CWP No. 10597-CAT of 202 [O&M],\n titled as \nUnion of India and others Vs.\n B.N. Jaggi and others\n, which reads as\n under:-\n\n \"The respondent served the petitioner-\n Department w.e.f. 24.01.1963 till he was\n retired from service w.e.f. 10.09.1975. In\n this manner, he served the Department for\n 12 years, 7 months and 17 days. The\n question was whether the respondent is\n entitled to be paid pension for the above\n stated service ?\n\n \nThe Tribunal has relied upon a decision of\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSLP No.\n 6365 of 1988 [Yashwant Hari Katakkar\n Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n], decided on\n 19.09.1994 where the employee had served\n for 18 ½ years but denied pension on the\n ground that he was not a permanent\n employee. The Supreme Court held that\n it would be travesty of justice if the\n retiree was denied pensionary benefits\n simply on the ground that he was not a\n permanent employee of the Department\n even after serving for 18½ years.\n\n It is not in dispute that in the instant case\n also, the respondent was denied pension\n only on the ground that he did not hold the\n post on permanent basis. The Tribunal has,\n thus, rightly relied upon the cited\n decision rendered in somewhat similar\n circumstances and accepted the claim of\n the respondent.\n\n It is informed by learned counsel for the\n respondent that the order passed by the\n Tribunal has already been implemented\n even before filing of the writ petition and\n pension stands granted to him.\n\n - 37 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n For the reasons afore-stated and also\n keeping in view the fact that the\n respondent retired way back in the year\n 1975, we decline to interfere with the\n impugned order.\n\n Dismissed.\n\n Learned counsel for the respondent informs\n us that this judgment has attained finality.\"\n\n CONCLUSION:\n\n12. Pension including family pension is payable\n\non the consideration of past service rendered by\n\na government servant. The object, intent and purpose\n\nof pension/family pension is to provide sustenance\n\nin old-age and provide protection and to secure\n\nsupport in old-age which would have flown upon\n\nretirement of a companion in normal course but for\n\nunforeseen death during service or post-retirement\n\nalso. Rule 54 (2) (a) (i) read with Rule 54 (14)\n\nof CCS [Pension] Rules, entitles an eligible member\n\nof family, including widow for family pension in\n\ncase, deceased employee-Government servant dies after\n\none year's continuous service in temporary capacity\n\nand in a pensionable establishment. An eligible family\n\nmember, could only be disentitled for family pension,\n\n - 38 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nin case the deceased Government servant was under\n\nsuspension prior to death or such Government servant\n\nhad rendered continuous service before attaining the\n\nage of eighteen years or was receiving family pension\n\nor was entitled for family pension under any other\n\nRules of Central/State Government/PSU/Autonomous\n\nbody/Local Body of Central/State Government [under\n\nRules 54 (14) (a) read with Rule 54 (13-B) of\n\nthe CCS [Pension] Rules. No other disqualification\n\nclause in CCS [Pension] has been shown, disentitling\n\nthe petitioner-widow, for family pension despite the\n\ndeceased granted service having rendered more than\n\nfive years and three months of service [as work\n\ncharge-temporary capacity]. In fact-situation of the\n\ninstant case, once none of these disqualifications\n\nare applicable, then, petitioner, Satya Devi, being\n\nwidow of late Shri Jagat Ram, who had died after\n\nhaving rendered more than five years three months\n\nservice from 01.01.2002 till death on 17.03.2007, i.e.\n\nmore than one year's continuous service is eligible\n\nand entitled for grant of family pension, on the basis\n\n - 39 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nof work charge service rendered in temporary capacity\n\nin a pensionable establishment, as per the mandate\n\nof Law in Sukru Ram and Matwar Singh, which\n\nwere upheld in SLP's and were implemented also.\n\nFurther, the entitlement of the petitioner for family\n\npension, could neither be taken away nor curtailed\n\nor restricted without any authority of law; when, the\n\nright to family pension comes within the ambit of\n\nproperty under \nArticle 300-A\n of the Constitution of\n\nIndia and such a right could neither be curtailed\n\nnor taken away, or denied or deprived, without any\n\nauthority of law. Further, no statutory provision [Act\n\nor Rules] has been brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt, which disentitles, the present petitioner for\n\nfamily pension, in facts of this case. Moreover, once\n\nthe petitioner's deceased husband has performed\n\nthe same work job, functions, duties which was\n\nperformed by other regular employees in all respects,\n\ncoupled with the fact that the petitioner's husband\n\nhad died as a daily wager and was accorded\n\nwork charge status posthumously vide order dated\n\n - 40 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n10.05.2016 [Annexure R-1] w.e.f. 01.01.2002 and\n\nin such an eventuality, the requirement of substantive\n\nappointment if any, did not apply due to untimely\n\nand belated action of State Authorities in extending\n\nthis benefit then, the claim for family pension has\n\nmerit. Moreover, the distinction between temporary\n\nand permanent employees for grant of pension, including\n\nfamily pension and other pecuniary benefits ceases to\n\nexist as per OM dated 28.03.1988 [Government of\n\nIndia decision No.2 under Rule 3 of CCS [Pension]\n\nRules and therefore, the denial of family pension is\n\nuncalled for and is accordingly quashed and set-\n\naside. The claim by the petitioner's widow for family\n\npension carries weight in view of the mandate of\n\nlaw, outlined in cases of \nKalawati, Meena Devi, M.I.\n\nSolkar and Neeraj Yadav\n [supra].\n\n13. Further, the stand taken by State Authorities\n\nis that the petitioner has not rendered ten years\n\nof regular service and the family pension cannot\n\nbe granted. The above plea of Learned State Counsel\n\ncannot be permitted to operate so as to defeat the\n\n - 41 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nintent and object of Rule 54 (2) (a) read with Rule\n\n54 (14) of CCS [Pension] Rules, which entitles an\n\neligible family member for pension after one year's\n\ncontinuous service, whereas in facts of this case,\n\nthe petitioner's husband late Shri Jagat Ram, had\n\nrendered more than 5 years and 3 months service.\n\nThus, deprivation of family pension arbitrarily and\n\nwithout authority of law cannot sustain. Denial of\n\nfamily pension despite being eligible as per provisions\n\nof Rule 54 of CCS [Pension] Rules, without prior\n\nnotice, without affording an opportunity of personal\n\nhearing is just to defeat the rights under the Rules,\n\nwhich cannot be permitted, resulting in malice in\n\nlaw in instant case. In addition, the claim for family\n\npension became due and payable to the petitioner\n\nw.e.f. 17.03.2007 i.e. date of death of her deceased\n\nhusband but these benefits have been denied till\n\ninstitution of OA No.4828 of 2016 [renumbered as\n\nCWPOA No. 267 of 2020], therefore, the petitioner\n\nherein is held entitled for family pension w.e.f.\n\n17.03.2007 i.e. date of death of her Late husband,\n\n \n- 42 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\nShri Jagat Ram notionally but actual arrears shall\n\naccrue for three years preceding the filing of first\n\npetition OA No.4699 of 2015, In re; \nSatya Devi versus\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh\n and even in view of\n\nsubsequent-present petition [OA No.4828 of 2016,\n\nre-numbered as CWPOA No 267 of 2020 on 21.09.2016]\n\nwith fixation of family pension, from due date as\n\nrevised and enhanced from time to time.\n\n DIRECTIONS:\n\n14. In view of the above discussion and for\n\nreasons recorded hereinabove, the instant petition, is\n\nallowed, in the following terms:-\n\n (i) Petitioner, Satya Devi, is held entitled\n for Family Pension, upon death of her\n Late husband, Shri Jagat Ram w.e.f.\n\n 17.03.2007 with all consequential benefits;\n\n (ii) Action of the State Authorities in denying\n Family Pension to the petitioner w.e.f.\n 17.03.2007; without any authority of law\n and dehors the intent; object of Rule 54\n of CCS [Pension] Rules, as applicable\n in the instant case, is quashed and set-\n aside;\n\n (iii) State Authorities are mandated to process\n the case and to ensure the sanction\n and release of Family Pension to the\n petitioner in accordance with Rule 54 of\n CCS [Pension] Rules and/or the law in\n Sukru Ram and Matwar Singh; and/or\n\n - 43 - [2020:HHC:10518-DB]\n\n the communication dated 25.11.1975\n {[OM dated 28.03.1988 Government of\n India decision No.2 under Rule 3 of CCS\n [Pension] Rules [supra]}; with all admissible\n monetary benefits notionally from due\n date [17.03.2007] and to release actual\n monetary benefits for three years preceding\n filing of the writ petition, OA No. 4699 of\n 2015 in accordance with law on or before\n 31st July, 2025;\n\n (iv) Failure to release Family Pension and\n admissible benefits accruing therefrom\n shall mandate the Respondents to give\n interest at the rate of 7% per annum, beyond\n 31.07.2025 till realization; and\n\n (v) Parties to bear their own costs.\n\n In aforesaid terms, the instant petition\n\nis allowed and pending miscellaneous application(s), if\n\nany, shall stand disposed of accordingly.\n\n (Vivek Singh Thakur)\n Judge\n\n (Ranjan Sharma)\n Judge\nJune 04, 2025\n [Bhardwaj/tm]",
