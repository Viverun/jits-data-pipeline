The background of the case is that on 3rd June 1997, the respondent\nwas allotted land in Plot No. 1, Sector 18, Electronic City, Gurgaon,\nHaryana admeasuring 1000 sq. meters by Haryana Urban Development\nAuthority (HUDA) and the petitioner on 17th March 1999 issued a letter\noffering the plot on lease to the petitioner. Between 20 th February 1999\nto 6th December 1999 various letters/mails were sent by the respondent to\nthe petitioner for letting out the plot with entitlement to the petitioner to\nconstruct a building thereon, and with an option to purchase the plot\nsubject to permission of law and on 14th February 2000, Power of\nAttorney was granted by the respondent to the petitioner and the Lease\nDeed was executed between the parties for a period of 20 years.\n\n3. On 28th August 2000, the respondent obtained a Conveyance Deed\ndated 28th August 2000 from HUDA for 1000 sq. metres plot and later\nobtained a Conveyance Deed dated 24th March 2003 for an additional\narea of 200 sq. metres and on 10th December 2000, the respondent\nsecured possession of the said plot measuring 1200 sq. metres from\nHUDA. The parties entered into an Agreement dated 23rd March 2001 as\nper the terms offered by the respondent and became effective from 1 st\nJune 2000.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 2 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n4. In year 2002, the petitioner, having taken possession of the plot,\nconstructed and completed building over the said plot and HUDA upon\ninspection of building in the year 2003 and after raising the receipt of\ndemand with respect to compounding for deviation from sanctioned plans\nand FAR, granted and issued Occupation Certificate dated 1 st September\n2003.\n\n5. On 27th July, 2006, upon expiry of six years of the term, the\npetitioner in writing elected and exercised the option vested and granted\nto it to purchase the property and offered to pay the agreed pre-\ndetermined sale consideration.\n\n6. The petitioner on 2nd January 2007, asked the respondent to\ndischarge its obligation to convey the title. The same was asked by the\npetitioner again vide e-mails dated 29th March 2007, 3rd April 2007, 15th\nMay 2007 and subsequently vide Notice dated 21st December 2007,\nnotified that upon failure to discharge its obligation, Arbitration shall be\ninvoked.\n\n7. On 8th February 2008, the petitioner invoked Arbitration and called\nupon the named Arbitrator. The named Arbitrator, on 3 rd April 2008,\nentered upon reference and first Arbitral hearing was held on 28 th April\n2008 wherein schedule for filing of pleadings and other directions were\nissued by the Learned Arbitrator.\n\n8. On 28th May 2008, the petitioner filed a Statement of Claim\nseeking specific performance and enforcement of Agreement to Sell to\nwhich the respondent on 11th July 2009, filed its Statement of Defence\nand subsequently, rejoinder was filed by the petitioner on 24 th September\n2008.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 3 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n9. The respondent on 19th July 2011 filed an application before the\nLearned ADJ, Gurgaon for termination of the mandate of the Learned\nArbitrator under\nSection 14\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nwhich was dismissed by the Learned ADJ vide Order dated 2 nd December\n2011. The Order of the Learned ADJ was set aside by the High Court of\nPunjab and Haryana in Civil Revision Petition no. 7687/2011. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court vide Order dated 14th December 2012 in SLP (C)\nno. 36603/2012 appointed a new arbitrator. The Learned Sole Arbitrator\nvide Order dated 4th August 2018 made and published the impugned\nAward. Aggrieved by the same, the instant petition has been filed.\nSUBMISSIONS\n(On behalf of the petitioner)\n\n10. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Learned Sole\nArbitrator went beyond the scope of reference and the jurisdiction while\nascertaining that the agreement is determinable in nature and therefore\nnot enforceable.\n\n11. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Learned Sole\nArbitrator rejected the claim of the petitioner for specific performance of\nsale of immovable property by applying\nSection 14(1)(c)\nof Specific\nRelief Act, 1963 and concept of per se determinability of the Contract. It\nis further submitted that the dispute was not even referred to the\nArbitration in the Statement of Defence and that the Learned Sole\nArbitrator committed error of jurisdiction by going beyond the scope of\nContract.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 4 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n12. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned\nAward suffers from patent illegality and is liable to be set aside to the\nextent it has been challenged for being in clear contravention of\nSection\n28(3)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation, 1996. Learned counsel for the\npetitioner submitted that option to terminate was only with the petitioner\nunder Clause 9 but the Contract was neither terminated by the petitioner\nand nor by the respondent either before or after the Contract was put to\nenforcement.\n\n13. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that impugned Award\nsuffers from inherent contradictions because on one hand it was held that\non exercise of option to purchase the agreement transforms into an\nagreement to sell, which as per Clause 6 is enforceable and on the other\nhand even upon an option vested with the petitioner to terminate having\nnot being exercised in terms of clause 9, on hypothetical and academic\nbasis it has been held that contract is determinable therefore not\nenforceable.\n\n14. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that\nSection 14(1)(c)\n\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not applicable in the facts of the case\nand instead\nSection 10\nis applicable. It is further submitted that all the\njudgments relied upon by the Learned Arbitrator to hold that\nSection\n14(1) (c)\nis applicable pertained to movable goods or contract of services\nin which the contract had been terminated and party aggrieved was\nseeking injunction or performance. Thus, in these circumstances it was\nheld that determinable contracts cannot be enforced. These are\ninapplicable to the terms of contract in present case and facts of present\ncase.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 5 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n15. In view of the aforesaid, the impugned Award dated 4th October\n2018 to the extent that the registered Agreement dated 23rd March 2001\nfor sale of immovable property has been held to be determinable in nature\nand therefore not enforceable, be set aside.\n\n(On behalf of the respondent)\n\n16. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent\nthrough various communications had categorically intimated the\npetitioner that the property could not be transferred. It further submitted\nthat the Contract became unenforceable and determinable due to various\nbreaches committed by the petitioner. Moreover, it is submitted that the\nLearned Sole Arbitrator went beyond the terms of the Contract by\ngranting compensation which was never sought by the petitioner.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Lease Deed\nbecame revocable and determinable under the law as well as\nSection\n28(3)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and by violating the\nterms of the Deed, the petitioner cannot seek recourse to the Clauses of\nthe Deed. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the\nimpugned Award is completely based on the interpretation of the Lease\nDeed.\n\n18. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Award to the\nextent it has been impugned in question, is neither patently illegal or in\ncontravention of fundamental policy of India because it has held the Deed\nto be determinable, revocable and unenforceable. Moreover, it is also\nsubmitted that the same is well reasoned on substantive law.

Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the judgments\nrelied by the Learned Sole Arbitrator are relevant to the case at hand and\nthat every judgment is different but the ratio is what is to be gathered\nfrom the judgment.\n\n20. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the whole of the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\nis applicable to the case and that the Deed was\ndeterminable and unenforceable from inception.\n\n21. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no rights or\ninterest could have vested in the petitioner and the building can be bought\nback by the respondent under the buyback Clause in the Deed and the\nrespondent is ready and willing to do so.\n\n22. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent\nhad the right to terminate the Agreement and the same was rightly done\nso and no right could have been vested in favour of petitioner as no right\ncould be transferred under the prevailing and current HUDA laws.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no Agreement\ncan be irrevocable, non-determinable even if either party commits a\nbreach of the Contract, and such a Contract would itself be void ab initio.\n\n24. Learned counsel for respondent submitted that the Lease Deed has\nbeen terminated by the respondent and struck down by the Learned\nArbitral Tribunal. It is also submitted that the Lease Deed has not become\nAgreement to Sell due to illegal acts and ill deeds of the petitioner.\n\n25.

Therefore, in view of the aforesaid it is submitted that the instant\npetition being devoid of merits is liable to be dismissed.\n\nQUESTION FOR ADJUDICATION\n\n27. Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the record.\n\n28. The present petition filed under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, seeks to challenge the impugned Award dated 4 th\nOctober 2018 to the extent that registered agreement dated 23.03.2001 for\nsale of immovable property has been held to be \"determinable in nature\ntherefore not enforceable\". It is the petitioner's averment that only on that\nbasis the claim of the petitioner for specific enforcement of agreement of\nsale of immovable property has been rejected.\n\n29. Therefore, the only question before this Court is to adjudicate that\nwhether the registered agreement dated 23.03.2001 for sale of immovable\nproperty has rightly been held to be \"determinable in nature therefore not\nenforceable\", and hence the dismissal of claim of the petitioner for\nspecific enforcement of agreement of sale of immovable property was\njust and proper.\n\nSpirit of the Arbitration Act\n\n30. Before adjudicating upon the merits of the case, it is essential to\nrecapitulate the idea, purpose, goal and objective of the\nArbitration Act\nas\nwell as\nSection 34\nof the Act to understand the implications the\nprovisions therein have on the powers and jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 8 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n31.\nThe Arbitration Act\nwas enacted for providing a mechanism to the\npublic to resolve their disputes in a process less rigorous, technical and\nformal than that of a litigation. It has proven to be easier, more accessible,\nefficient and even cost effective for the parties involved, whether at an\nindividual level or at the level of a business or corporation. The\nalternative dispute mechanism is not only advantageous for the people\ninvolved in disputes but has also been aiding the effective disposal and\nrelease of burden on the Courts of the Country. The parties have a more\nhands-on involvement in an Arbitration process and play an active role in\nthe adjudication process.\n\n32. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion of India vs. Varindera\nConstructions Ltd.\n, (2018) 7 SCC 794, while discussing the object of\narbitration held as under:-\n\n―12. The primary object of the arbitration is to reach a final\ndisposition in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious\nmanner. In order to regulate the law regarding arbitration,\nlegislature came up with legislation which is known as\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n. In order to make\narbitration process more effective, the legislature restricted\nthe role of courts in case where matter is subject to the\narbitration.\nSection 5\nof the Act specifically restricted the\ninterference of the courts to some extent. In other words, it is\nonly in exceptional circumstances, as provided by this Act,\nthe court is entitled to intervene in the dispute which is the\nsubject-matter of arbitration. Such intervention may be\nbefore, at or after the arbitration proceeding, as the case\nmay be. In short, court shall not intervene with the subject-\nmatter of arbitration unless injustice is caused to either of the\nparties.‖\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 9 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n33. Therefore, expeditious and effective disposal of matters are most\ncertainly considered the primary objectives of the enactment of the\n\nArbitration Act\n. To fulfil the objective of introducing the\nArbitration Act\n,\nit has been deemed necessary by the legislature as well as the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court to limit interference by the Courts in the process of\narbitration, whether before, during or after the conclusion of the\nproceedings.\n\n34. The petitioner before this Court has invoked\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act to challenge the impugned Award. The relevant portion\nof the said provision is reproduced hereunder for perusal and\nconsideration:-\n\n―34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--\n\n(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be\nmade only by an application for setting aside such award in\naccordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).\n(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if--\n\n(a) the party making the application establishes on the\nbasis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that--\n\n(i) a party was under some incapacity, or\n\n(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under\nthe law to which the parties have subjected it or,\nfailing any indication thereon, under the law for\nthe time being in force; or\n\n(iii) the party making the application was not\ngiven proper notice of the appointment of an\narbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was\notherwise unable to present his case; or\n\n(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not\ncontemplated by or not falling within the terms\nof the submission to arbitration, or it contains\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 10 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\ndecisions on matters beyond the scope of the\nsubmission to arbitration:\n\nProvided that, if the decisions on matters\nsubmitted to arbitration can be separated from those\nnot so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award\nwhich contains decisions on matters not submitted to\narbitration may be set aside; or\narbitral award which contains decisions on\nmatters not submitted to arbitration may be set\naside; or\n\n(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or\nthe arbitral procedure was not in accordance\nwith the agreement of the parties, unless such\nagreement was in conflict with a provision of\nthis Part from which the parties cannot\nderogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in\naccordance with this Part; or\n\n(b) the Court finds that--\n\n(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not\ncapable of settlement by arbitration under the\nlaw for the time being in force, or\n\n(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the\npublic policy of India.\n\n[Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is\nclarified that an award is in conflict with the public\npolicy of India, only if,--\n\n(i) the making of the award was induced or\naffected by fraud or corruption or was in\nviolation of section 75 or section 81; or\n\n(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental\npolicy of Indian law; or\n\n(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions\nof morality or justice.\n\nExplanation 2.--For the avoidance of doubt, the test as\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 11 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nto whether there is a contravention with the\nfundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a\nreview on the merits of the dispute.]\n[(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than\ninternational commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside\nby the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by\npatent illegality appearing on the face of the award:\n\nProvided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the\nground of an erroneous application of the law or by\nreappreciation of evidence.] ...‖\n\n35. The contents of the provision clearly show that the intention of\nlegislature while enacting the\nArbitration Act\n, as well as while carrying\nout amendments to the same, was that there should be limited\nintervention of the Courts in arbitral proceedings, especially after the\nproceedings have been concluded and an Award thereto has been made\nby the concerned Arbitral Tribunal. Any claim brought forth a Court of\nlaw under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act shall be in accordance with\nthe principle of the provisions laid down under the\nArbitration Act\nas well\nas interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n36. The Law Commission of India in its 246 th Report has also\nelaborated upon the background of introducing\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act and laid down as under:-\n\n―3.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter\n\"the Act\") is based on the UNCITRAL Model law on\nInternational Commercial Arbitration, 1985 and the\nUNCITRAL Conciliation Rules, 1980.\nThe Act\nhas now been\nin force for almost two decades, and in this period of time,\nalthough arbitration has fast emerged as a frequently chosen\nalternative to litigation, it has come to be afflicted with\nvarious problems including those of high costs and delays,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 12 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nmaking it no better than either the earlier regime which it\nwas intended to replace; or to litigation, to which it intends\nto provide an alternative. Delays are inherent in the\narbitration process, and costs of arbitration can be\ntremendous. Even though courts play a pivotal role in giving\nfinality to certain issues which arise before, after and even\nduring an arbitration, there exists a serious threat of\narbitration related litigation getting caught up in the huge\nlist of pending cases before the courts. After the award, a\nchallenge under\nSection 34\nmakes the award inexecutable\nand such petitions remain pending for several years. The\nobject of quick alternative disputes resolution frequently\nstands frustrated.\n\n4. There is, therefore, an urgent need to revise certain\nprovisions of the Act to deal with these problems that\nfrequently arise in the arbitral process. The purpose of this\nChapter is to lay down the foundation for the changes\nsuggested in the Report of the Commission. The suggested\namendments address a variety of issues that plague the\npresent regime of arbitration in India and, therefore, before\nsetting out the amendments, it would be useful to identify the\nproblems that the suggested amendments are intended to\nremedy and the context in which the said problems arise and\nhence the context in which their solutions must be seen.\n\n25. Similarly, the Commission has found that challenges to\narbitration awards under\nSections 34\nand\nare similarly\nkept pending for many years. In this context, the Commission\nproposes the addition of\nSections 34(5)\nand\n48(4)\nwhich\nwould require that an application under those sections shall\nbe disposed of expeditiously and in any event within a period\nof one year from the date of service of notice. In the case of\napplications under\nSection 48\nof the Act, the Commission has\nfurther provided a time-limit under\nSection 48(3)\n, which\nmirrors the time-limits set out in\nSection 34(3)\n, and is aimed\nat ensuring that parties take their remedies under this section\nseriously and approach a judicial forum expeditiously, and\nnot by way of an afterthought.‖\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 13 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n37. With the repeal of\nArbitration Act\nof 1940 by way of\nArbitration\nAct, 1996\n, the legislature sought to achieve the objective of reducing the\nsupervisory role of courts in arbitration proceedings. The amendment of\n\nSection 34\nwas also to have the Courts readily and expeditiously\nadjudicate upon any proceedings arising out of arbitration proceedings.\nThe challenge to an Award also must be disposed of as expeditiously\npossible by the Courts.\n\n38. It is clear that the speed and efficiency of disposal of disputes\nbetween parties are few of the substantial and key purposes of the\nintroduction, development and promotion of resolving disputes by way of\nalternate mechanisms of dispute resolution.\n\n39. Hence, the objective, goal and purpose of the Act as well as the\nintention of the legislature have to be given due consideration while\nadjudicating a petition under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nScope of Powers of Arbitrator & Intervention of Courts\n\n40. The Arbitrator, who in his wisdom, passes an Award, upon\nconducting the arbitration proceedings with the participation of parties to\nthe dispute, considering the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence\npresented by and on behalf of the parties, the relevant documents placed\non record by the parties, is considered a Court for the purposes of\nadjudicating the dispute before him. An unfettered intervention in his\nfunctioning would defeat the spirit and purpose of the\nArbitration Act\n, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\n41. An Arbitrator has wide powers while adjudicating arbitration\nproceedings.

However, there is a deemed privilege of limited intervention from\nthe Courts which the Arbitrators have. The same has been reiterated by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court time and again.\n\n42. There is an extent to the accountability put upon an Arbitrator\nwhile passing an Award. This is evident from the fact that with the\nenforcement of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, an Arbitrator\nneeds only to adhere to and fulfil the requirements under\nSection 31\nof\nthe Act. The limited requirements under\nSection 31\nare reproduced\nhereunder:-\n\n―Form and contents of arbitral award. -\n\n(1) An arbitral award shall be made in writing and shall be\nsigned by the members of the arbitral tribunal.\n(2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), in arbitral\nproceedings with more than one arbitrator, the signatures of\nthe majority of all the members of the arbitral tribunal shall\nbe sufficient so long as the reason for any omitted signature\nis stated.\n\n(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it\nis based, unless--\n\n(a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be\ngiven, or\n\n(b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms\nunder\nsection 30\n(4)\nThe arbitral award shall state its date and the place of\narbitration as determined in accordance with\nsection 20\nand\nthe award shall be deemed to have been made at that place.\n(5) After the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be\ndelivered to each party.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 15 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n(6) The arbitral tribunal may, at any time during the arbitral\nproceedings, make an interim arbitral award on any matter\nwith respect to which it may make a final arbitral award. ...‖\n\n43. In addition to the requirements laid down under the provision, an\nArbitrator, although acting in accordance with the requirements of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, need not act as a formal Court while adjudicating a\ndispute and pass an Award which is lengthy, detailed or speaking. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated that an Award which is not\nspeaking shall be set aside by the Court only in exceptional cases.\n\n44.\nIn\nAnand Brothers (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors.\n, (2014) 9\nSCC 212, the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the question of a reasoned or\nspeaking Award observed and held as under:-\n\n―7. Before we examine whether the expression ''finding\"\n\nappearing in Clause 70 would include reasons in support of\nthe conclusion drawn by the arbitrator, we consider it\nappropriate to refer to the Constitution Bench decision of this\nCourt in\nRaipur Development Authority v. Chokhamal\nContractors\nwherein this Court was examining whether an\naward without giving reasons can be remitted or set aside by\nthe Court in the absence of any stipulation in the arbitral\nagreement obliging the arbitrator to record his reasons.\nAnswering the question in the negative, this Court held that a\nnonspeaking award cannot be set aside except in cases where\nthe parties stipulate that the arbitrator shall furnish reasons\nfor his award. This Court held: (SCC pp. 750-51, para 33)\n―33 . ... When the parties to the dispute insist upon\nreasons being given, the arbitrator is, as already\nobserved earlier, under an obligation to give reasons.\nBut there may be many arbitrations in which parties to\nthe dispute may not relish the disclosure of the reasons\nfor the awards. In the circumstances and particularly\nhaving regard to the various reasons given by the\nIndian Law Commission for not recommending to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 16 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nGovernment to introduce an amendment in the Act\nrequiring the arbitrators to give reasons for their\nawards we feel that it may not be appropriate to take\nthe view that all awards which do not contain reasons\nshould either be remitted or set aside.‖\nHaving said that, this Court declared that the Government\nand their instrumentalities should-as a matter of policy and\npublic interest-if not as a compulsion of law, ensure that\nwhenever they enter into an agreement for resolution of\ndisputes by way of private arbitrations, the requirement of\nspeaking awards is expressly stipulated and ensured. Any\nlaxity in that behalf might lend itself to and, perhaps justify\nthe legitimate criticism, that the Government failed to\nprovide against possible prejudice to public interest.\n\n8. The following passage is in this regard apposite: (\nRaipur\nDevelopment Authority\ncase, SCC pp. 752-53, para 37)\n―37. There is, however, one aspect of non-speaking\nawards in non-statutory arbitrations to which\nGovernment and governmental authorities are parties\nthat compel attention. The trappings of a body which\ndischarges judicial functions and is required to act in\naccordance with law with their concomitant\nobligations for reasoned decisions, are not attracted to\na private adjudication of the nature of arbitration as\nthe latter, as we have noticed earlier, is not supposed\nto exert the State's sovereign judicial power. But\narbitral awards in disputes to which the State and its\ninstrumentalities are parties affect public interest and\nthe matter of the manner in which Government and its\ninstrumentalities allow their interest to be affected by\nsuch arbitral adjudications involve larger questions of\npolicy and public interest. Government and its\ninstrumentalities cannot simply allow large financial\ninterests of the State to be prejudicially affected by\nnon-reviewable---except in the limited way allowed by\nthe statute-non-speaking arbitral awards. Indeed, this\nbranch of the system of dispute resolution has, of late,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 17 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nacquired a certain degree of notoriety by the manner\nin which in many cases the financial interests of\nGovernment have come to suffer by awards which\nhave raised eyebrows by doubts as to their rectitude\nand propriety. It will not be justifiable for\nGovernments or their instrumentalities to enter into\narbitration agreements which do not expressly\nstipulate the rendering of reasoned and speaking\nawards. Governments and their instrumentalities\nshould, as a matter of policy and public interest-if not\nas a compulsion of law-ensure that wherever they\nenter into agreements for resolution of disputes by\nresort to private arbitrations, the requirement of\nspeaking awards is expressly stipulated and ensured. It\nis for Governments and their instrumentalities to\nensure in future this requirement as a matter of policy\nin the larger public interest. Any lapse in that behalf\nmight lend itself to and perhaps justify, the legitimate\ncriticism that Government failed to provide against\npossible prejudice to public interest.‖\n\n9. Reference may also be made to the\nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\nwhich has repealed the\nArbitration\nAct, 1940\nand which seeks to achieve the twin objectives of\nobliging the Arbitral Tribunal to give reasons for its arbitral\naward and reducing the supervisory role of courts in\narbitration proceedings.\nSection 31(3)\nof the said Act obliges\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to state the reasons upon which it is\nbased unless the parties have agreed that no reasons be\ngiven or the arbitral award is based on consent of the\nparties. There is, therefore, a paradigm shift in the legal\nposition under the new Act which prescribes a uniform\nrequirement for the arbitrators to give reasons except in the\ntwo situations mentioned above. The change in the legal\napproach towards arbitration as an alternative dispute\nresolution mechanism is perceptible both in regard to the\nrequirement of giving reasons and the scope of interference\nby the court with arbitral awards.

We are referring to these developments\nfor it is one of the well-known canons of interpretation of\nstatutes that when an earlier enactment is truly ambiguous in\nthat it is equally open to diverse meanings, the later\nenactment may in certain circumstances serve as the\nparliamentary exposition of the former.\n\n14. It is trite that a finding can be both: a finding of fact or a\nfinding of law. It may even be a finding on a mixed question\nof law and fact. In the case of a finding on a legal issue the\narbitrator may on facts that are proved or admitted explore\nhis options and lay bare the process by which he arrives at\nany such finding. It is only when the conclusion is supported\nby reasons on which it is based that one can logically\ndescribe the process as tantamount to recording a finding. It\nis immaterial whether the reasons given in support of the\nconclusion are sound or erroneous. That is because a\nconclusion supported by reasons would constitute a \"finding\"\n\nno matter the conclusion or the reasons in support of the\nsame may themselves be erroneous on facts or in law. It may\nthen be an erroneous finding but it would nonetheless be a\nfinding. What is important is that a finding presupposes\napplication of mind. Application of mind is best\ndemonstrated by disclosure of the mind; mind in turn is best\ndisclosed by recording reasons. That is the soul of every\nadjudicatory process which affects the rights of the\nparties....‖\n\n45. Therefore, while considering a challenge to an Arbitral Award\nwhere private parties are involved, the Court need not examine the\nvalidity of the findings or the reasoning behind the findings given by an\nArbitrator.

It has also been reiterated that, while adjudicating a challenge\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, the Courts must limit themselves\nto examining the Award itself and not the facts of the case. A Court shall\nnot conduct a roving enquiry into the facts and evidence of the matter and\nneither shall the Court sit in appeal against the Award of the Arbitrator.\n\n47.\nIn\nUHL Power Co. Ltd. vs. State of Himachal Pradesh\n, (2022) 4\nSCC 116, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the narrow scope under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act and held as under:-\n\n―16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when it\ncomes to the scope of an appeal under\nSection 37\nof the\nArbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court in\nexamining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an\naward, is all the more circumscribed.\nIn\nMMTC Ltd. v.\nVedanta Ltd.\n5, the reasons for vesting such a limited\njurisdiction on the High Court in exercise of powers under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act have been explained in the\nfollowing words: (SCC pp. 166-67, para 11)\n―11. As far as\nSection 34\nis concerned, the position is\nwell-settled by now that the Court does not sit in\nappeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on\nmerits on the limited ground provided under\nSection\n34(2)(b)(ii)\ni.e. if the award is against the public policy\nof India. As per the legal position clarified through\ndecisions of this Court prior to the amendments to the\n1996 Act in 2015, a violation of Indian public policy,\nin turn, includes a violation of the fundamental policy\nof Indian law, a violation of the interest of India,\nconflict with justice or morality, and the existence of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 20 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\npatent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the\nconcept of the \"fundamental policy of Indian law\"\n\nwould cover compliance with statutes and judicial\nprecedents, adopting a judicial approach, compliance\nwith the principles of natural justice, and\nWednesbury6 reasonableness. Furthermore, \"patent\nillegality\" itself has been held to mean contravention\nof the substantive law of India, contravention of the\n1996 Act, and contravention of the terms of the\ncontract.‖\n\n17. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this\nCourt in\nK. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.\n7,\nwherein it has been observed as follows: (SCC p. 540, para\n\n2)\n―2. The contours of the power of the Court under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act are too well established to\nrequire any reiteration. Even a bare reading of\nSection\nof the Act indicates the highly constricted power of\nthe civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. The\nreason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to\navail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution,\nthey must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom\nof the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the\ncourt should be restricted to the bare minimum.\n\nInterference will be justified only in cases of\ncommission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can\nfind manifestation in different forms including exercise\nof legal perversity by the arbitrator.‖\n\n48.\nIn\nDelhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd vs. Delhi Metro Rail\nCorporation\n, (2022) 1 SCC 131, the Hon'ble Supreme Court to this\naspect held as under:-\n\n―28.

There is a disturbing tendency of Courts\nof setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and\nreassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a\nconclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter,\ndubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or\npatent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for\nannulment of the award.‖\n\n49. Further, in\nState of Jharkhand vs. HSS Integrated DSN\n, (2019) 9\nSCC 798, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even when there are more\nthan one plausible views and the Arbitrator, in his wisdom, adopts one of\nthem, having given reasons for his findings, the Courts shall not interfere\nwith such an Award. It was observed as under:-\n\n―6.1. In Progressive-MVR3, after considering the catena of\ndecisions of this Court on the scope and ambit of the\nproceedings under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, this\nCourt has observed and held that even when the view taken\nby the arbitrator is a plausible view, and/or when two views\nare possible, a particular view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal\nwhich is also reasonable should not be interfered with in a\nproceeding under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n6.2. In Datar Switchgear Ltd., this Court has observed and\nheld that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and\nthe findings of fact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on\nthe basis of the evidence on record are not to be scrutinised\nas if the Court was sitting in appeal. In para 51 of the\njudgment, it is observed and held as under: (SCC pp. 169-70)\n―51. ..... The proposition of law that the Arbitral\nTribunal is the master of evidence and the findings of\nfact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on the\nbasis of evidence on record are not to be scrutinised as\nif the Court was sitting in appeal now stands settled by\na catena of judgments pronounced by this Court\nwithout any exception thereto.‖\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 22 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n50. Hence, the law which has been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt is that the scope of interference with an Arbitral Award under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is fairly limited and narrow. The Courts\nshall not sit in an appeal while adjudicating a challenge to an Award\nwhich is passed by an Arbitrator, the master of evidence, after due\nconsideration after facts, circumstances, evidence and material before\nhim. Therefore, it is clear that this Court shall also limit itself to the\nAward in question and not re-appreciate evidence and all material before\nthe Arbitrator.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n51. Upon perusal of the pleadings and hearing the parties at length, this\nCourt opines that the controversy between the parties qua the impugned\nAward may be narrowed down to adjudicate the following issues:\n\ni. Whether the Learned Sole Arbitrator went beyond its\njurisdiction by holding that the Agreement dated 23rd March\n2001 is a Determinable Agreement.\n\nii. Whether the impugned Award is patently illegal and in\nconflict with the Public Policy of India.\nIssue no. 1\n\n52. The impugned findings of Arbitrator on the question of agreement\nbeing determinable while declaring the Arbitral Award are enclosed\nbelow:\n\n―47. I will first deal with the contention of the learned counsel\nfor the Respondent that agreement being determinable under\nClauses 9 thereof, is not capable of being specifically enforced\nunder\nSection 14(1)(c)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 23 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nplea of the learned counsel for the Claimant that\nSection\n14(1)(c)\nis not at all attracted to the facts of the case.\n\n48. In order to appreciate the contentions of learned counsel for\nthe parties, it will be necessary to extract clauses 9.1 and 9.2 of\nthe agreement:\n\n9.1 At the Option of the Lessee\n\nThe Lessee may any time during the term hereof\nterminate this agreement at its sole option by a 60-day\nwritten notice.\n\nThe Lessee shall not be liable to pay or incur any\ncharges, costs or expenses or for any incidental,\nconsequential, direct. or indirect damages including\nloss of opportunity or anticipated profits.\n\n9.2 Termination due to default of Lessor\n\nThe Lessee may terminate this agreement by a 30 day\nwritten notice due to failure of the Lessor to adhere to\nany of its obligations under this Agreement. In such an\nevent the Lessee shall not be liable to pay or incur any\npayment; compensation charges, costs of expenses or\nfor any incidental, consequential, direct or indirect\ndamages including loss of opportunity of anticipated\nprofits.\n\nIn the event this Agreement is terminated in terms of\neither clauses 9.1. or 9.2 the Lessor undertakes to\nbuyback the Building at the book value from the\nLessee.\n\n49. As is evident from the aforesaid clauses the agreement is\nterminable at the option of the Lessee. Question that arises for\nconsideration is whether such an agreement which is\ndeterminable can be enforced. The answer to the question lies\nin\nSection 14\nof the Act...\n\n50. According to sub-\nsection 1\nof\nSection 14\n, agreements that\nfall within the ambit of any of its sub-clauses cannot be\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 24 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nenforced. In the instant proceeding the Claimant seeks an\naward in its favour and against the Respondent for specific\nperformance of the agreement to sell land admeasuring 1200\nSq. Meters and a three storied Building standing thereon shorn\nof details the Claimant seeks specific performance of a\ndeterminable contract. Since the agreement is determinable it\nattracts clause c of sub\nsection 1\nof\nsection 14\n. This being so, as\nper the mandate of the provision, the agreement cannot be\nspecifically enforced.‖\n\n53. Upon a bare perusal of the impugned Arbitral Award, this Court is\nof the opinion that the Learned Sole Arbitrator has correctly deduced its\nfindings while passing the Arbitral Award and has correctly interpreted\nthe terms of Agreement dated 23rd March 2001.\n\n54. In any case,\nSection 14(1)\nof the Act prior to amendment and as\napplicable to the instant case, clearly delineates the contracts which\ncannot be specifically enforced, and under\nSection 14(1)(c)\n, specific\nperformance cannot be granted in a contract which is determinable in\nnature.\n\n55. As rightly observed by the Learned Arbitrator and in view of\nclauses 9.1 and 9.2 of the Agreement, the same is determinable at the\noption of the lessee. Therefore, the findings of the learned arbitrator on\nthe question of agreement being determinable do not suffer from any\nillegality whatsoever.\n\n56. Issue No. 1 stands adjudicated accordingly.\n\nIssue No. 2\n\n57.

The law regarding patent illegality and public policy of India is no\nmore res integra and has been authoritatively clarified by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in a number of judicial pronouncements.\n\n58. Since, it has been settled that the scope of interference under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is limited, it is now pertinent to see the\nconsiderations that are to be considered while adjudicating upon a\nchallenge and in what circumstances may an Award may be set aside.\n\n59. On a bare reading of the invoked provision\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act as quoted above, it has become evident the words used\ntherein are that \"An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if\",\nwhich signifies the intent of limiting the scope of interference by Courts\nin an Arbitral Award, passed after thorough procedure, involvement of\nparties, and appreciation of facts, evidence and law, \"only\" in the event of\nthe circumstances delineated in the provision being met. The limited\ngrounds which may invite the intervention and action thereupon by the\nCourts are explicitly laid down under the provision. What is to be seen by\na Court exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is\nthat an Award passed by an Arbitral Tribunal may only be set aside if it is\npatently illegal, against the public policy of India, based on no evidence\nand delineates no reason for passing the Award.\n\n60. The petitioner has raised the ground of patent illegality as well as\ncontravention to public policy while impugning the Award dated 4th\nOctober 2018.\n\n61. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in BCCI vs. Cricket Association &\nOrs.

The validity of Rule 6.2.4 as amended can be examined\nalso from the standpoint of its being opposed to \"public\npolicy\". But for doing so we need to first examine what is\nmeant by \"public policy\" as it is understood in legal\nparlance. The expression has been used in\nSection 23\nof the\nContract Act, 1872 and in\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 and host of other statutes but has not\nbeen given any precise definition primarily because the\nexpression represents a dynamic concept and is, therefore,\nincapable of any straitjacket definition, meaning or\nexplanation. That has not, however, deterred jurists and\ncourts from explaining the expression from very early times.\n\n91. Mathew, J. speaking for the Court in\nMurlidhar\nAggarwal v. State of U.P.\n27 referred to Winfield's definition\nin Public Policy in English Common Law 42 Harvard Law\nReview 76 to declare that: (SCC p. 482, para 31)\n―31. Public policy does not remain static in any given\ncommunity. It may vary from generation to generation\nand even in the same generation. Public policy would\nbe almost useless if it were to remain in fixed moulds\nfor all time.‖\n\n92. The Court then grappled with the problem of ascertaining\npublic policy if the same is variable and depends on the\nwelfare of the community and observed: (Murlidhar\nAggarwal case27 , SCC pp. 482-83, para 32)\n―3 2. If it is variable, if it depends on the welfare of the\ncommunity at any given time, how are the courts to\nascertain it? The Judges are more to be trusted as\ninterpreters of the law than as expounders of public\npolicy. However, there is no alternative under our\nsystem but to vest this power with Judges. The\ndifficulty of discovering what public policy is at any\ngiven moment certainly does not absolve the Judges\nfrom the duty of doing so. In conducting an enquiry, as\nalready stated, Judges are not hidebound by\nprecedent.

The Judges are to base their decisions on the\nopinions of men of the world, as distinguished from\nopinions based on legal learning. In other words, the\nJudges will have to look beyond the jurisprudence and\nthat in so doing, they must consult not their own\npersonal standards or predilections but those of the\ndominant opinion at a given moment, or what has been\ntermed customary morality. The Judges must consider\nthe social consequences of the rule propounded,\nespecially in the light of the factual evidence available\nas to its probable results. Of course, it is not to be\nexpected that men of the world are to be subpoenaed\nas expert witnesses in the trial of every action raising\na question of public policy. It is not open to the Judges\nto make a sort of referendum or hear evidence or\nconduct an inquiry as to the prevailing moral concept.\n\nSuch an extended extra-judicial enquiry is wholly\noutside the tradition of courts where the tendency is to\n'trust the Judge to be a typical representative of his\nday and generation'. Our law relies, on the implied\ninsight of the Judge on such matters. It is the Judges\nthemselves, assisted by the Bar, who here represent the\nhighest common factor of public sentiment and\nintelligence. No doubt, there is no assurance that\nJudges will interpret the mores* of their day more\nwisely and truly than other men. But this is beside the\npoint. The point is rather that this power must be\nlodged somewhere and under our Constitution and\nlaws, it has been lodged in the Judges and if they have\nto fulfil their function as Judges, it could hardly be\nlodged elsewhere.‖\n\n93.

Public policy, however, is not the policy of a\nparticular Government. It connotes some matter which\nconcerns the public good and the public interest. The\nconcept of what is for the public good or in the public\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the\npublic good or the public interest has varied from time\nto time. As new concepts take the place of old,\ntransactions which were once considered against\npublic policy are now being upheld by the courts and\nsimilarly where there has been a well recognised head\nof public policy, the courts have not shirked from\nextending it to new transactions and changed\ncircumstances and have at times not even flinched\nfrom inventing a new head of public policy ....\nIt is thus clear that the principles governing public\npolicy must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of\nexpansion or modification. Practices which were\nconsidered perfectly normal at one time have today\nbecome obnoxious and oppressive to public\nconscience. If there is no head of public policy which\ncovers a case, then the court must in consonance with\npublic conscience and in keeping with public good and\npublic interest declare such practice to be opposed to\npublic policy. Above all, in deciding any case which\nmay not be covered by authority our courts have\nbefore them the beacon light of the Preamble to the\nConstitution. Lacking precedent, the court can always\nbe guided by that light and the principles underlying\nthe fundamental rights and the directive principles\nenshrined in our Constitution.‖\n\n94. We may also refer to the decision of this Court in ONGC\nLtd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd., wherein this Court was considering\nthe meaning and import of the expression \"public policy of\nIndia\" as a ground for setting aside an arbitral award.\nSpeaking for the Court M.B. Shah, J. held that the expression\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 29 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n\"public policy of India\" appearing in the Act aforementioned\nmust be given a liberal meaning for otherwise resolution of\ndisputes by resort to arbitration proceedings will get\nfrustrated because patently illegal awards would remain\nimmune to court's interference. This Court declared that\nwhat was against public good and public interest cannot be\nheld to be consistent with public policy. The following\npassage aptly summed up the approach to be adopted in the\nmatter: (Saw Pipes Ltd. case, SCC pp. 727-28, para 31)\n―31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'public policy\nof India' used in\nSection 34\nin context is required to be\ngiven a wider meaning. It can be stated that the\nconcept of public policy connotes some matter which\nconcerns public good and the public interest. What is\nfor public good or in public interest or what would be\ninjurious or harmful to the public good or public\ninterest has varied from time to time. However, the\naward which is, on the face of it, patently in violation\nof statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public\ninterest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to\nadversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in\nour view in addition to narrower meaning given to the\nterm 'public policy' in Renusagar case it is required to\nbe held that the award could be set aside if it is\npatently illegal. The result would be-award could be\nset aside if it is contrary to:\n\n(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or\n\n(b) the interest of India; or\n\n(c) justice or morality, or\n\n(d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.\n\nIllegality must go to the root of the matter and if the\nillegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that\naward is against the public policy. Award could also\nbe set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it\nshocks the conscience of the court. Such award is\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 30 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nopposed to public policy and is required to be\nadjudged void.‖\n\n95. In ONGC Ltd. v. Western GECO International Ltd., this\nCourt was examining the meaning of \"fundamental policy of\nIndian law\", an expression used by this Court in Saw Pipes\ncase. Extending the frontiers of what will constitute \"public\npolicy of India\" this Court observed: (Western GECO\nInternational Ltd. case , SCC pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-39)\n―35. What then would constitute the 'fundamental\npolicy of Indian law' is the question. The decision in\nONGC does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the\nexpression must, in our opinion, include all such\nfundamental principles as providing a basis for\nadministration of justice a and enforcement of law in\nthis country. Without meaning to exhaustively\nenumerate the purport of the expression 'fundamental\npolicy of Indian law', we may refer to three distinct\nand fundamental juristic principles that must\nnecessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the\nfundamental policy of Indian law. The first and\nforemost is the principle that in every determination\nwhether by a court or other authority that affects the\nrights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences,\nthe court or authority concerned is bound to adopt\nwhat is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach'\nin the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach\narises from the very nature of the power exercised by\nthe court or the authority does not have to be\nseparately or additionally enjoined upon the fora\nconcerned. What must be remembered is that the\nimportance of a judicial approach in judicial and\nquasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so\nlong as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising\npowers that affect the rights or obligations of the\nparties before them shows fidelity to judicial\napproach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious\nor whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that\nthe authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 31 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nin a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its\ndecision is not actuated by any extraneous\nconsideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as\na check against flaws and faults that can render the\ndecision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to\nchallenge.\n\n38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the\npolicy of Indian law is the principle that a court and so\nalso a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining\nthe rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in\naccordance with the principles of natural justice.\nBesides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of\nthe facets of the principles of natural justice is that the\ncourt/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind\nto the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a\nview one way or the other. Non-application of mind is\na defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application\nof mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind\nand disclosure of mind is best done by recording\nreasons in support of the decision which the court or\nauthority is taking. The requirement that an\nadjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that\nview, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it\ncan be described as a fundamental policy of Indian\nlaw.\n\n39. No less important is the principle now recognised\nas a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative\nlaw that a decision which is perverse or so irrational\nthat no reasonable person would have arrived at the\nsame will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity\nor irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone\nof Wednesbury Principle of reasonableness. Decisions\nthat fall short of the standards of reasonableness are\nopen to challenge in a court of law often in writ\njurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in\nstatutory processes wherever the same are available.‖\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 32 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n96. To sum up: public policy is not a static concept. It varies\nwith times and from generation to generation. But what is in\npublic good and public interest cannot be opposed to public\npolicy and vice versa. Fundamental Policy of Law would also\nconstitute a facet of public policy. This would imply that all\nthose principles of law that ensure justice, fair play and\nbring transparency and objectivity and promote probity in\nthe discharge of public functions would also constitute public\npolicy. Conversely, any deviation, abrogation, frustration or\nnegation of the salutary principles of justice, fairness, good\nconscience, equity and objectivity will be opposed to public\npolicy. It follows that any rule, contract or arrangement that\nactually defeats or tends to defeat the high ideals of fairness\nand objectivity in the discharge of public functions no matter\nby a private non-governmental body will be opposed to\npublic policy. ....‖\n\n62. While discussing the fundamentals of patent illegality, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in\nState of Chhattisgarh vs. Sal Udyog (P) Ltd.\n, (2022) 2\nSCC 275 held as under:-\n\n―14. The law on interference in matters of awards under the\n1996 Act has been circumscribed with the object of\nminimising interference by courts in arbitration matters. One\nof the grounds on which an award may be set aside is \"patent\nillegality\". What would constitute \"patent illegality\" has been\nelaborated in\nAssociate Builders v. DDA\n, where \"patent\nillegality\" that broadly falls under the head of \"Public\nPolicy\", has been divided into three sub-heads in the\nfollowing words: (SCC p. 81, para 42)\n―42. In the 1996 Act, this principle is substituted by\nthe \"patent illegality\" principle which, in turn,\ncontains three sub-heads:\n\n42.1. (a) A contravention of the substantive law of\nIndia would result in the death knell of an arbitral\naward. This must be understood in the sense that such\nillegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 33 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nbe of a trivial nature. This again is really a\ncontravention of\nSection 28\n(1 )(a) of the Act, which\nreads as under:\n\n'28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-(])\nWhere the place of arbitration is situated in\nlndia,-\n\n(a) in an arbitration other than an international\ncommercial arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal\nshall decide the dispute submitted to arbitration\nin accordance with the substantive law for the\ntime being in force in India;'\n42.2. (b) A contravention of the\nArbitration Act\nitself\nwould be regarded as a patent illegality - for example\nif an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in\ncontravention of\nSection 31 (3)\nof the Act, such award\nwill be liable to be set aside.\n\n42.3. (c) Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality\nis really a contravention of\nSection 28\n( 3) of the\n\nArbitration Act\n, which reads as under:\n\n'28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-\n\n(1)-(2) * * *\n(3) In all cases, the Arbitral Tribunal shall\ndecide in accordance with the terms of the\ncontract and shall take into account the usages\nof the trade applicable to the transaction.'\n\n15. In Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAJ9,\nspeaking for the Bench, R.F. Nariman, J. has spelt out the\ncontours of the limited scope of judicial interference in\nreviewing the arbitral awards under the 1996 Act and\nobserved thus: (SCC pp. 169-71, paras 34-41)\n\"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression\n\"public policy of India\", whether contained in\nSection\nor in\nSection 48\n, would now mean the \"fundamental\npolicy of Indian law\" as explained in paras 18 and 27\nof Associate Builders8 i.e. the fundamental policy of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 34 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nIndian law would be relegated to \"Renusagar\"\n\nunderstanding of this expression. This would\nnecessarily mean that Western Geco expansion has\nbeen done away with. In short, Western Geco, as\nexplained in paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders,\nwould no longer obtain, as under the guise of\ninterfering with an award on the ground that the\narbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the\nCourt's intervention would be on the merits of the\naward, which cannot be permitted post amendment.\nHowever, insofar as principles of natural justice are\nconcerned, as contained in\nSections 18\nand\n\n34(2)(a)(iii)\nof the 1996 Act, these continue to be\ngrounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in\npara 30 of Associate Builders.\n\n35. It is important to notice that the ground for\ninterference insofar as it concerns \"interest of India\"\n\nhas since been deleted, and therefore, no longer\nobtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the\nbasis that the award is in conflict with justice or\nmorality is now to be understood as a conflict with the\n\"most basic notions of morality or justice\". This again\nwould be in line with paras 36 to 39 of Associate\nBuilders , as it is only such arbitral awards that shock\nthe conscience of the court that can be set aside on this\nground.\n\n36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now\nconstricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is\ncontrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as\nunderstood in paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders,\nor secondly, that such award is against basic notions\nof justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to 39\nof Associate Builders8. Explanation 2 to\nSection\n34(2)\n(b )(ii) and Explanation 2 to\nSection 48(2)\n(b )(ii)\nwas added by the Amendment Act only so that Western\nGeco, as understood in Associate Builders8, and paras\n28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 35 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are\nconcerned, an additional ground is now available\nunder sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act,\n2015, to\nSection 34\n. Here, there must be patent\nillegality appearing on the face of the award, which\nrefers to such illegality as goes to the root of the\nmatter but which does not amount to mere erroneous\napplication of the law. In short, what is not subsumed\nwithin \"the fundamental policy of Indian law\", namely,\nthe contravention of a statute not linked to public\npolicy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the\nbackdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on\nthe ground of patent illegality.\n\n38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation\nof evidence, which is what an appellate court is\npermitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground\nof patent illegality appearing on the face of the award.\n\n39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders,\nnamely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of\nIndia, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set\naside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate\nBuilders8, however, would remain, for if an arbitrator\ngives no reasons for an award and contravenes\nSection\n31(3)\nof the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a\npatent illegality on the face of the award.\n\n40. The change made in\nSection 28\n( 3) by the\nAmendment Act really follows what is stated in paras\n42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders, namely, that the\nconstruction of the terms of a contract is primarily for\nan arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes\nthe contract in a manner that no fair-minded or\nreasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's\nview is not even a possible view to take. Also, if the\narbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with\nmatters not allotted to him, he commits an error of\njurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall\nwithin the new ground added under\nSection 34\n(2-A).\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 36 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n41. What is important to note is that a decision which\nis perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32 of\nAssociate Builders8, while no longer being a ground\nfor challenge under \"public policy of India\", would\ncertainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on\nthe face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no\nevidence at all or an award which ignores vital\nevidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse\nand liable to be set aside on the ground of patent\nillegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents\ntaken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator\nwould also qualify as a decision based on no evidence\ninasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led\nby the parties, and therefore, would also have to be\ncharacterised as perverse.\"\n\n16. In Delhi Airport Metro Express (P) Ltd. referring to the\nfacets of patent illegality, this Court has held as under: (SCC\np. 150, para 29)\n\"29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to\nthe root of the matter. In other words, every error of\nlaw committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall\nwithin the expression \"patent illegality\". Likewise,\nerroneous application of law cannot be categorised as\npatent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not\nlinked to public policy or public interest is beyond the\nscope of the expression \"patent illegality\". What is\nprohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to\nconclude that the award suffers from patent illegality\nappearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not\nsit in appeal against the arbitral award. The\npermissible grounds for interference with a domestic\naward under\nSection 34\n(2-A) on the ground of patent\nillegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is\nnot even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the\ncontract in such a manner which no fair-minded or\nreasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits\nan error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the\ncontract and dealing with matters not allotted to them.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 37 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nAn arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings\nwould make itself susceptible to challenge on this\naccount. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are\nbased on no evidence or have been arrived at by\nignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set\naside on the ground of patent illegality. Also,\nconsideration of documents which are not supplied to\nthe other party is a facet of perversity falling within the\nexpression \"patent illegality\".‖\n\n63. The abovementioned precedents have settled the position of a\nchallenge to an Arbitral Award. The facets under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act, specifically under Sub-\nsection 2\n, provide the limited\npurview of such a challenge.\n\n64. In order to set aside an Award under\nSection 34\nthe petitioner must\nshow that illegality which has been alleged goes to the root of the matter\nand is not an illegality of trivial nature. In failure of the same the\nimpugned Award cannot be held to be against the public policy. Award\ncould also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the\nconscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is\nrequired to be adjudged void.\n\n65. To argue that the impugned Award before this Court is liable to set\naside in the instant petition it has been argued that the findings of the\nlearned Arbitrator are patently illegal and against the fundamental policy\nof India. As stipulated by the aforementioned precedents, the words are\nnot to be construed in their plain meaning, but the essence to be\nappreciated while adjudicating a challenge under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act is that the illegalities or deficiencies are such that they are\napparent on the face of record and/or shock the conscience of the Court\nand can in no manner be sustained. In the case at hand, the petitioner has\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 38 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nnot been able to show that the impugned Award suffers from such\nillegality that is apparent on the face of record and upholding the same\nwould be against the law.\n\n66. A clear reading of the precedents cited proves that under the\nlimited scope of\nSection 34\n, the present case does not warrant the\ninterference of this Court, as the grounds stated by the petitioner in the\ninstant petition do not meet the scope of this section. Accordingly, with\nreference to the aforesaid judgments and the impugned Arbitral Award,\nthe Petitioner cannot have the benefit of the \"ground of patent illegality\"\n\nto assail the impugned Arbitral Award under\nSection 34\nof the Act, 1996.\n\n67. Reiterating as previously observed, \"patent illegality\" is an\nillegality that goes to the root of the matter but excludes the erroneous\napplication of the law by an arbitral tribunal or re-appreciation of\nevidence by an appellate court. In this instant case, the Arbitral Award\nwas a well-reasoned award, with the findings being clearly arrived at\nbased on all the documents/evidence on record.\n\n68. The learned Arbitrator has clearly considered Statement of Claim\nrelevant Clauses of the Terms of the Agreement to Sell dated 23 rd March\n2001 and the ground that the Learned Sole Arbitrator has passed the\nArbitral Award which is beyond the scope of its jurisdiction does not\nstand validated as per the submissions of the Petitioner and under the\nobservation of the Court. The impugned Award is in no way in\ncontravention of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, to reason\nthat the Award is patently illegal.\n\n69. Therefore, as regards to Issue No. II, this Court is of the considered\nview that the petitioner has not been able to show that the grounds laid\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 39 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act for setting aside the impugned\nAward are made out on behalf of the petitioner. None of the impugned\nfindings of the learned Arbitrator is such that it shows that the impugned\nAward is patently illegal to shock the conscience of the Court, against\npublic policy or fundamental policy of India or falls under the grounds\nlaid down in\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\nCONCLUSION\n\n70. In the lights of facts, submissions and contentions in the pleadings,\nthis Court find that the petitioner has failed to substantiate its grounds for\nsetting aside the impugned Arbitral Award on the ground that the Learned\nSole Arbitrator went beyond its jurisdiction by holding that the\nAgreement is a Determinable Agreement and is patently illegal. The\nCourt is of the view that the Learned Sole Arbitrator was well within its\njurisdiction to declare the Agreement dated 23rd March 2001 as\nDeterminable Agreement in the view of Statement of Claim of the\nrespondent and Terms of the said Agreement.\n\n71. It is settled law that the ground of Patent illegality gives way to\nsetting aside an Arbitral Award with a very minimal scope of\nintervention. A party cannot simply raise an objection on the ground of\npatent illegality if the Award is simply against them. Patent illegality\nrequires a distinct transgression of law, the clear lack of which thereof\nmakes the petition simply a pointless effort of objection towards an\nAward made by a competent Arbitral Tribunal. Further, the petitioner has\nnot been able to prove that the impugned Arbitral Award is patently\nillegal, and contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law, and hence\nis liable to be set aside.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nO.M.P.(COMM) 28/2019 Page 40 of 41\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:26.04.2023\n\n19:14:42\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023:DHC:2814\n\n72.
