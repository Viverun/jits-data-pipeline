It is alleged that on 05.07.2023, at around 10:00 p.m., the\ndeceased was beaten and was confined in a room. Thereafter,\nwhen her health deteriorated, she was taken to GTB Hospital on\nthe same day.\n\n5. The deceased succumbed to her injuries on 07.07.2023.\n\n6. It is alleged that the deceased was threatened on a regular\nbasis by her husband and his family members. On 08.07.2023,\nthe complainant was informed by his other sister that the\ndeceased was beaten by her husband and his family members.\n\n7. The postmortem of the deceased was conducted on\n09.07.2023 which revealed fifteen external and various internal\ninjuries that had been inflicted on the deceased. The opinion in\nthe postmortem report stipulated that the death of the deceased\noccurred due to coma as a result of antemortem cerebral damage\nconsequent upon blunt force impact to the head and all injuries\nwere antemortem in nature and produced by blunt force.\n\n8. During the course of investigation, subsequent opinion\nfrom the autopsy surgeon on the postmortem report was also\nobtained, which showed that various injuries were caused three\nto four days prior to the death and these injuries were inflicted by\nhitting the head of the deceased on the wall and by slapping her.\n\n9. The charge sheet in the present case has already been filed.\n\n10. On the receipt of the present complaint, enquiry under\n\nSection 176\nof the CrPC was initiated and the statement of the\ncomplainant was recorded. In the said statement, it was stated\nthat the deceased was 8 months' pregnant and was constantly\nbeaten by her husband under the influence of alcohol. It was also\nstated that on 05.07.2023, the other sister of the complainant had\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 2 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:02\nreceived a video-call from the deceased at around 12 midnight, in\nwhich she was crying a lot and told her that her husband had\nbeaten her and she was in a lot of pain and was also vomiting.\n\n11. The learned counsel for the applicant submits that the\napplicant has been falsely implicated in the present case. He\nsubmits that the applicant is the Father-in-Law of the deceased\nand the allegations are primarily against the husband of the\ndeceased (son of the applicant).\n\n12. He submits that since the beginning of the marriage, the\ndeceased was living separately on the first floor with her husband\nand the applicant used to reside on the ground floor.\n\n13. He further submits that the FIR was initially registered\nunder\nSections 323\n/\n/\n/\nof the IPC and it was only upon\nthe unfortunate death of the deceased that,\nSections 304(B)\nand\nof the IPC were added in the chargesheet.\n\n14. He submits that from the bare perusal of the chargesheet,\neven if the allegations are prima facie taken to be correct, the\napplicant can be tried only under\nSection 498A\nof the IPC. He\nsubmits that the applicant had readily surrendered and cooperated\nwith the investigation.\n\n15. He submits that the charge sheet in the present case has\nalready been filed and the applicant is in custody since\n10.07.2023 and no purpose would be served by keeping the\napplicant in further incarceration.\n\n16. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has\nopposed the grant of bail on the ground that the allegations are\nvery heinous in nature and there are specific allegations against\nthe applicant.\n\n17. He submits that the postmortem report indicated that the\ndeceased was beaten and was not provided any medical help at\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 3 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:02\nthe most needed time.\n\n18. I have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n19.\nSection 304B\nof IPC reads as under:\n\n\"304B. Dowry death\n(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or\nbodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is\nshown that soon before her death she was subjected to\ncruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of\nher husband for, or in connection with, any demand for\ndowry, such death shall be called \"dowry death\", and\nsuch husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused\nher death. Explanation.--For the purpose of this sub-\n\nsection, \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in\n\nsection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with\nImprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven\nyears but which may extend to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n20. The presumption in law of a 'dowry death' is meant to act\nas a deterrent to the demand of dowry and to ensure that there is\nno victimization because of that. The basic ingredient to attract\nthe provisions of\nSection 304B\n, IPC, is, firstly, that the death of\nthe woman should have occurred under circumstances which are\nnot normal. The conviction, by applying the provisions of\n\nSection 304B\n, IPC, is essentially based on the presumption that\nwould necessarily mean that circumstances which are not normal\nor essentially the one where the reason of death is not\nascertained.\n\n21. The interpretation of\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC came\nup for consideration in\nBaijnath v. State of M.P\n: (2017 1 SCC\n\n101). The relevant paras are extracted below:-\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 4 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:02\n\n25. Whereas in the offence of dowry death defined by Section\n304-B of the Code, the ingredients thereof are:\n\n(i) death of the woman concerned is by any burns or bodily\ninjury or by any cause other than in normal circumstances,\nand\n\n(ii) is within seven years of her marriage, and\n\n(iii) that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of the husband for,\nor in connection with, any demand for dowry.\n\nThe offence under Section 498-A of the Code is attracted qua\nthe husband or his relative if she is subjected to cruelty. The\nExplanation to this Section exposits \"cruelty\" as:\n\n(i) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to\ndrive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or\ndanger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical), or\n\n(ii) harassment of the woman, where such harassment is with a\nview to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any\nunlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on\naccount of failure by her or any person related to her to meet\nsuch demand.\n\n26.Patently thus, cruelty or harassment of the lady by her\nhusband or his relative for or in connection with any demand\nfor any property or valuable security as a demand for dowry\nor in connection therewith is the common constituent of both\nthe offences.\n\n27. The expression \"dowry\" is ordained to have the same\nmeaning as in\nSection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.\nThe expression \"cruelty\", as explained, contains in its\nexpanse, apart from the conduct of the tormentor, the\nconsequences precipitated thereby qua the lady subjected\nthereto. Be that as it may, cruelty or harassment by the\nhusband or any relative of his for or in connection with any\ndemand of dowry, to reiterate, is the gravamen of the two\noffences.\n\n22. The law presumes that deaths which are not normal, if had\nhappened within seven years of the date of marriage and the\nvictim was subjected to cruelty in connection with demand of\ndowry made before her death would be termed as dowry death.\nThe allegations of cruelty levelled against the applicant will be\ntested in trial and at this stage considering an application for bail\nonly the parameters enshrined in that regard are to be considered.\n\n23. In the present case there are no specific allegations against\nthe applicant in regard to the demand of dowry soon before the\ndeath of the victim. It is true that general allegations have been\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 5 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:02\nlevelled of the victim being subjected to cruelty and physical\nassault by her husband and his family members, however, no\nspecific allegation has been made against the applicant in regard\nto the cruelty in connection with any demand of dowry soon\nbefore the death of the victim.\n\n24. It has specifically been alleged that the victim was\nsubjected to physical assault by her husband soon before her\ndeath. It is alleged that the victim had made a phone call to her\nsister two days before her death complaining that her husband\nhad beaten her and she was in lot of pain and was also vomiting.\nIt is not alleged that the victim was physically assaulted by the\napplicant.\n\n25. It was contended that the applicant was also responsible\nsince he did not provide the timely medical help to the victim.\nThe learned counsel for the applicant, however, pointed out that\nthe applicant has been staying on a separate floor and was,\ntherefore, not aware of the victim being physically assaulted by\nhis son. The allegation and the defence in this regard would be\ntested during the course of the trial.\n\n26. The object of jail is to secure the appearance of the\naccused persons during the trial. The object is neither punitive\nnor preventive and the deprivation of liberty has been considered\nas a punishment. The applicant cannot be made to spend the\nentire period of trial in custody especially when the trial is likely\nto take considerable time. The presence of the accused can be\nsecured at the time of trial by putting appropriate conditions.\n\n27. Without commenting further on the merits of the case,\nkeeping the facts and circumstances in mind and the fact that the\ntrial is likely to take some time, I am satisfied that the applicant\nhas made out a case for grant of regular bail.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 6 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:03\n\n28. The applicant is, therefore, directed to be released on bail\non furnishing a bail bond for a sum of ₹50,000/- with one surety\nof the like amount, subject to the satisfaction of learned Trial\nCourt / Duty Metropolitan Magistrate on the following\nconditions:\n\na. He shall under not leave the country without the\npermission of the learned Trial Court;\n\nb. He shall appear before the learned Trial Court on\nevery date of hearing;\n\nc. He shall not, in any manner, try to contact any of the\nwitnesses;\n\nd. He shall upon his release provide his mobile number\nto the investigating officer/SHO which shall be kept\nin working condition at all times.\n\n29. In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/ complaint\nlodged against the applicant, it would be open to the State to seek\nredressal by filing an appropriate application for cancellation of\nbail.\n\n30. It is clarified that the observations made in the present\norder are for the purpose of deciding the present bail application,\nand should not influence the outcome of the Trial. The said\nobservations should not be taken as an expression of opinion on\nthe merits of the case.\n\n31. The present application is allowed in aforementioned\nterms.\n\nAMIT MAHAJAN, J\nMARCH 7, 2024\n'KDK'/HK\n\nBAIL APPLN. 304/2024 Page 7 of 7\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 29/03/2024 at 21:15:03",
