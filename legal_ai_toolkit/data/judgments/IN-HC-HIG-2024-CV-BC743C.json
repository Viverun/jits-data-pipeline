Further, the State issued the impugned decision in the\n\nshape of order dated 26.08.2021 to grant notional promotion\n\nto the teachers [private respondents], to Grade-III, IV and VII,\n\n- 12 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nwho were appointed in the year 1993 onwards, in terms of\n\nResolution No. 1145 dated 18.07.2019.\n\n14. The petitioners contended that the same is illegal,\n\narbitrary and without application of mind. It has been\n\npleaded that promotion takes effect only with effect from the\n\ndate an employee joins on such post and not with\n\nretrospective effect. In this context, reference has been made\n\nto Resolution No. 2074 dated 04.04.1985 to fortify that\n\npromotion takes effect from the date of joining and no\n\nnotional or retrospective promotion is permissible.\n\n15. Further, reference has been made to letter as contained\n\nin Memo No. 1985 dated 20.11.2016, as also Circular No.\n\n151 of the year 2006 issued by Finance Department. Letter\n\ndated 17.01.2019 issued by the School Education and\n\nLiteracy Department, Govt. of Jharkhand to fortify the stand\n\nof the petitioners.\n\n16. Referring to Rule 58 of Jharkhand Service Code and\n\nRule 74 of the Jharkhand Finance Rules, it has been pleaded\n\nthat it provides that promotion takes effect from the date on\n\nwhich the employee assumes the charge of higher regular\n\npost.\n\n17. In the light of the above, the petitioners being aggrieved\n\nwith the promotion orders as contained in different memos\n\nvide order dated 28.12.2016 with retrospective effect from\n\n- 13 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n01.04.2015; and Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, has\n\napproached this Court by filing writ petitions, which were\n\ndismissed. Hence, the present intra-court appeals.\n\n18. It is evident from the factual aspect that for\n\nappointment of primary teachers, the erstwhile State of Bihar\n\nframed a rule vide notification dated 30.09.1991 known as\n\n„Bihar Prarambhik Vidyalaya Niyukti Niyamavali, 1991‟ [Bihar\n\nPrimary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991] in exercise of power\n\nconferred under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India,\n\nwherein provision of appointment of teachers, both trained\n\nand untrained, was there. But untrained teachers were to\n\nobtain Teachers Training Certificate by way of in-service\n\ntraining and till then they will be entitled to get only\n\nuntrained matric pay-scale.\n\n19. The State of Bihar further framed a rule, under the\n\npower conferred under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, for promotion of the teachers of\n\nelementary schools taken over by the Government in the\n\nname of \"Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers‟\n\nPromotion Rules, 1993\" to be effective from 01.01.1986. After\n\nbifurcation, it has been adopted by the State of Jharkhand.\n\n20. The private respondents herein are the teachers\n\nappointed under Rules, 1991 and governed by the promotion\n\nRules of 1993.\n\n- 14 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n21. Thereafter, the Human Resource Development\n\nDepartment of the State of Jharkhand under proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India, vide notification no.\n\n1632 dated 05.09.2012, framed a rule, Jharkhand Primary\n\nSchool Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 (in short referred to\n\nas 'Rule, 2012').\n\n22. Accordingly, the State of Jharkhand issued Notification\n\ncontained in Memo No. 1533 dated 31.7.2014, whereby a\n\ndecision was taken to appoint teachers for classes 6 to 8 in\n\nterms of\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education\n\nAct, 2009\n. It was clarified that 50% of the said posts would be\n\nfilled up by direct recruitment and rest by way of promotion\n\nfrom elementary school teachers.\n\n23. Pursuant thereto, an advertisement was issued for\n\nappointment of such teachers and the members of petitioner\n\nno.1 and petitioner no.2 in W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021, as also\n\npetitioners of W.P.(S) No.3365 of 2020 were appointed in\n\ndifferent districts in the year 2015 onwards in the quota\n\nfixed for direct recruitment.\n\n24. At this juncture, it is admitted fact that private\n\nrespondents were initially appointed on Grade I pay-scale\n\nwhereas the petitioners herein are the direct appointees on\n\nGrade IV in the year December, 2015 onwards.\n\n- 15 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n25. It is the case of the petitioners that after their\n\nappointment in the month of December, 2015 and January,\n\n2016, the respondents-authorities vide office order as\n\ncontained in memo dated 28.12.2016 granted promotion to\n\nlarge number of teachers, the private respondents herein,\n\nwith retrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the\n\npromotes have been made senior to the direct recruits, the\n\nappellants herein, who were appointed in December, 2015.\n\n26. Later on, a decision has been taken by the State-\n\nauthority, as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated\n\n26.8.2021 issued under the signature of Joint Secretary to\n\nthe Government, School Education and Literacy Department,\n\nGovt. of Jharkhand, for giving promotion to the teachers, who\n\nare working in Grade-3, 4 and 7, on notional basis and\n\nfurther decision has been taken to grant promotion with\n\nretrospective effect from the date of availability of vacancy.\n\n27. The writ petitioners, being aggrieved with the promotion\n\norders as contained in different memos vide order dated\n\n28.12.2016 and Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, has\n\napproached this Court by filing writ petitions.\n\n28. Before the writ Court, the petitioners have taken the\n\nground that the writ petitioners/appellants were appointed in\n\nthe month of December, 2015 and January, 2016 but\n\nalthough the impugned order of promotion was issued on\n\n- 16 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n28.12.2016 i.e., much later point of time i.e., about more\n\nthan a year of their initial appointment, but surprisingly the\n\nimpugned office order of promotion dated 28.12.2016 has\n\nbeen issued granting promotion to teachers under Science,\n\nArts and Language stream to Grade IV with retrospective\n\neffect from 01.04.2015 only with a purpose to rank the\n\npetitioners, who are the direct recruits, below the interveners-\n\nrespondents by granting notional promotion, which is in\n\nviolation of the Promotion Rules, 1993 as also the various\n\ncirculars of Finance Department and the parent Education\n\nDepartment.\n\n29. The writ petitioners-appellants further took the ground\n\nthat Rule 2 of Promotion Rules, 1993 provides altogether 8\n\n(eight) hierarchy i.e., from Grade I to Grade VIII for promotion\n\nof teachers in different pay-scales. It has further been stated\n\nthat Grade I means Matric Trained Pay-scale and Grade II\n\nand Grade III are the senior scale and selection grade scale of\n\nMatric Trained Scale. Grade IV means Graduate Trained Pay-\n\nScale with two Grade V and Grade VI, which are senior scale\n\nand Selection Grade Scale of Graduate Pay Scale. Further,\n\nGrade VII means Headmaster basic pay scale and Grade VIII\n\nis senior scale of Headmaster pay-scale.\n\n30. It is further case of the petitioner in Grade IV i.e., entry\n\ngrade of Graduate Pay-Scale, the petitioners were appointed\n\n- 17 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nin the year December, 2015 and January, 2016 whereas the\n\nprivate respondents were granted Graduate Pay-scale [Grade-\n\nIV] by way of promotion vide impugned order dated\n\n28.12.2016, as contained in different Memos.\n\n31. It is the specific case of the writ petitioners-appellants\n\nthat they have borne in the cadre [Graduate Pay-scale] first\n\ntherefore, the impugned order dated 28.12.2016, by which\n\nthe respondents-authorities granted promotion to large\n\nnumber of teachers including the private respondents, with\n\nretrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the promotees\n\nhave been made senior to the direct recruits, is bad in law.\n\n32. The writ petitioners although initially had not impleaded\n\nthe promotes as party but during pendency of the writ\n\npetitions the promotes have entered into the proceeding by\n\nway of filing intervention petition, which was allowed by the\n\nwrit court to cut short the multiplicity of proceeding and\n\nbased upon they were provided opportunity of hearing.\n\n33. In the writ proceeding, the State has appeared and\n\ncontested the case by filing counter affidavits.\n\n34. The grounds have been taken by the respondents in the\n\ncounter affidavit that the promotion which has been granted\n\nin favour of private respondents with retrospective effect\n\ncannot be said to suffer from error, reason being that the said\n\npromotion order was issued in consonance with the statutory\n\n- 18 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nprovision as contained under Promotion Rules, 1993 wherein\n\nthere is no bar to grant retrospective promotion/notional\n\npromotion. The relevant Promotion Rules, 1993 provides that\n\nthe promotion is to be granted to one or other incumbent\n\nsubject to availability of vacancy and vacancy was there but\n\nfor one or the other reason, the private respondents could not\n\nget promotion, hence, the promotion was granted with\n\nretrospective effect i.e., from the date of their entitlement and\n\nvacancy being available.\n\n35. It has further been stated that the State of Jharkhand,\n\ntherefore, has taken a uniform decision to grant\n\nretrospective/notional promotion with effect from the date of\n\nentitlement of one or the other teachers vide notification as\n\ncontained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, to grant\n\nretrospective/notional promotion with effect from the date of\n\nentitlement of one or the other teachers. It has further been\n\naverred that such decision was taken in compliance of\n\nvarious judgment including the judgment rendered in the\n\ncase of\nState of Jharkhand & Ors Vs. Arun Sinha [LPA\n\nNo.\n214 of 2008 with analogous cases], which ha sbeen\n\naffirmed by Hon‟ble Apex Court in S.L.A. (Civil) No. 5520-\n\n5522 of 2013.\n\n36. In addition to that the interveners-private respondents\n\nhave submitted that writ petitioners have been appointed\n\n- 19 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nmuch after the appointment of private respondents-\n\ninterveners, as such the seniority of the private respondents-\n\ninterveners has to be counted from the date of initial\n\nappointment. It has further been submitted that the\n\nmembers of petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 2 were not\n\neven born in the service/cadre, when the interveners were\n\nappointed. It has further been submitted that once a person\n\nbecame eligible and there is vacancy, he has a right to get\n\npromotion and merely for the fault lies on the part of the\n\nState no one can made to suffer and the State taking into\n\nconsideration these facts since has granted promotion to\n\ninterveners vide notification/order dated 28.12.2016 by\n\nwhich the respondents-authorities granted promotion with\n\nretrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015 cannot be said to suffer\n\nfrom error.\n\n37. Learned Single Judge, taking into consideration the\n\naforesaid fact and considering the fact that earlier there was\n\nno concept of direct appointment of teachers in Grade-IV\n\nwhen the interveners were appointed and the concept of\n\nappointment of teachers for classes 6 to 8 (i.e. Grade-IV)\n\ncame only after enactment of\nRight of Children to Free and\n\nCompulsory Education Act, 2009\n. As such merely because\n\nthe appointment of teachers in the year 2015 onwards, the\n\ncase of those who were already in service right from 1994\n\n- 20 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nonwards cannot be allowed to suffer. Accordingly, the writ\n\npetitions was dismissed with an observation that the State is\n\nfree to abide by the impugned decision and grant promotion\n\nto the teachers entitled under the law, which is the subject\n\nmatter of instant intra-court appeals.\n\nArgument on behalf of appellants-writ petitioners:\n\n38. Mr. Bhanu Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants-writ petitioners has challenged the order passed\n\nby learned writ Court on the following grounds:\n\nI. That the learned Single Judge has not appreciated\n\nthe factual aspect in right prospective that by\n\ngranting promotion with retrospective effect to the\n\nprivate respondents-promotees, they have also been\n\ngranted benefit in the seniority list while fixing the\n\ninter se seniority of the direct recruits and the\n\npromotes and without taking into consideration the\n\nfact that the writ petitioners [direct appointees] have\n\ntaken birth in the cadre i.e., Grade IV [Graduate\n\nTrained Pay-Scale] way back in the month of\n\nDecember, 2015 and the interveners-private\n\nrespondents have been granted promotion in Grade\n\nIV vide notification dated 28.12.2016 i.e., after about\n\na year entering into the cadre by the writ petitioners-\n\ndirect appointees but by granting such promotion\n\n- 21 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nwith retrospective effect from 01.04.2015, the inter se\n\nseniority has been disturbed. As such the promotees\n\neven though had not taken birth in the cadre have\n\nbeen shown to be senior, which cannot be said to be\n\njust and proper. But the aforesaid fact has not been\n\ntaken into consideration by the learned Single Judge\n\nin the impugned order.\n\nII. The learned Single Judge has also erred in passing\n\nthe impugned order while taken into consideration\n\nthe long length of service of the interveners, which led\n\nthe learned Single Judge in coming to the conclusion\n\nthat the private respondents are treated to be senior\n\nto that of direct recruits, who have come in the\n\nservice/cadre by virtue of enactment of the provision\n\nof Jharkhand Primary School Teacher Appointment\n\nRules, 2012.\n\nIII. It has been submitted that aforesaid finding\n\narrived at learned Single Judge cannot be said to be\n\njust and proper reason being that in the matter of\n\npromotion and for the aforesaid purpose, the fixation\n\nof inter-se seniority amongst promotees and direct\n\nrecruits i.e., the entry in the feeder cadre is to be\n\nconsidered and not date of the entry in the service.\n\nHere, admittedly, the writ petitioners-appellants\n\n- 22 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nentered in the feeder cadre of Grade IV much prior to\n\nthe private respondents. But the learned Single Judge\n\nhas considered the basis of seniority on the ground of\n\nentry made in initial service in the different cadres i.e,\n\nMatric trained scale, even though the private\n\nrespondents at the time of their initial appointment\n\nwere not having teachers training certificate, but\n\nsubsequently they got training and by virtue of order\n\npassed by this Court, they have been given benefit of\n\nmatric trained scale from the date of their initial\n\nappointment. But the aforesaid issue of granting\n\nmatric trained scale is having no adverse effect on\n\nanybody.\n\nIV. But while putting the private respondents\n\nand alike senior to that of direct recruits by granting\n\nretrospective promotion, merely on the ground that\n\nthe private respondents have been inducted in service\n\nway back to that of direct recruits cannot be a ground\n\nto put the private respondents [promotees] senior to\n\nthat of direct recruits/appointees [writ petitioners]\n\notherwise all time to come the direct recruits will\n\nsuffer and the same cannot be said to be the principle\n\nfor deciding the inter se seniority between the private\n\nrespondents [promotees] and the petitioners. But the\n\n- 23 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nlearned Single Judge did not appreciate these facts\n\ninto consideration while passing the impugned order.\n\nV. It has been contended that crux of the matter\n\nrevolves around the inter se seniority between the\n\nwrit petitioners-appellants and the private\n\nrespondents, who have been impleaded in\n\nrepresentative capacity, but the learned Single Judge\n\nwithout taking into consideration the settled principle\n\nof law that seniority cannot be given on retrospective\n\nbasis when an employee was not even born in the\n\ncadre and by doing so, it may adversely affect the\n\nemployees who have been appointed validly in the\n\nmeantime.\n\nVI. It has further been submitted that judgment\n\nrendered in the case of\nArun Sinha & Ors Vs. State\n\nof Jharkhand [W.P.(S) No.\n638 of 2006] affirmed in\n\nL.P.A. No. 214 of 2008 and the matter travelled up-to\n\nHon‟ble Apex Court as also in W.P.(S) No.2547 of 2014\n\n(\nSunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. The State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors.\n], upon which reliance has been\n\nplaced, is not applicable in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case reason being that\n\nboth the judgments are individual claim of petitioners\n\nwhich pertains to grant of Grade-I Matric Trained\n\n- 24 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nScale from the date of initial appointment and it does\n\nnot in any way deals with the issue of granting\n\npromotion to Grade IV [Graduate Trained Scale] with\n\nretrospective effect or in particular dealing with the\n\nissue of inter se seniority. Therefore, the judgments\n\nrendered in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra) and\nSunil\n\nKumar Bhagat\n(supra), are of no help to the private\n\nrespondents [promotees] but the learned Single Judge\n\nrelying upon the same has passed the impugned\n\njudgment, therefore, the same requires interference\n\nby this Court.\n\nVII. Ground has also been taken that the\n\npromotion was granted on the basis of Bihar Taken\n\nOver Elementary School Teachers‟ Promotion Rules,\n\n1993 but after coming into effect of\nRight of Children\n\nto Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\nin\n\nterms of which the Jharkhand Primary School\n\nTeacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was framed for\n\nmaking direct recruitment on the post of Graduate\n\nTrained Teacher in Grade IV, the issue of inter se\n\nseniority of the direct recruits vis-à-vis the promotees\n\n[private respondents], was also required to be\n\nconsidered by making out a policy decision to protect\n\nthe right of the parties. However, in absence of any\n\n- 25 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nsuch policy decision/rule, consideration ought to\n\nhave been given by learned Single Judge that the\n\nprivate respondents, who have been granted\n\npromotion with retrospective promotion may have no\n\nadverse effect on the seniority of the direct recruits on\n\nthe principle that the day when the direct recruits\n\nwere appointed in view of provisions of Rule, 2012 the\n\npromotees were not even taken birth in the cadre but\n\nby virtue of granting retrospective promotion they\n\nhave been shown to be taken birth in the cadre\n\nwithout discharging the duty in the cadre.\n\nVIII. Therefore, the impugned Memo dated\n\n28.12.2016, whereby many teachers including private\n\nrespondents were granted promotion to Grade-IV with\n\nretrospective effect from 01.04.2015 is fit to be\n\nquashed and set aside.\n\nIX. Further ground has been taken that in the\n\nimpugned order there is no whisper about the\n\ndetermination of inter se seniority of the appellants\n\n[direct recruits] and the private respondents\n\n[promotes[ which is the main crux of the matter and\n\nsimilarly the impugned order as contained in Memo\n\nNo. 619 dated 26.08.2021 which was issued\n\nsubsequent to the appointment of the\n\n- 26 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\npetitioners/appellants is completely silent regarding\n\nthe inter se seniority between the direct recruits and\n\nthe promotes on the post of Graduate Trained Pay\n\nScale, as such finding recorded by the learned Single\n\nJudge is wholly erroneous and requires interference\n\nby this Court.\n\nX. Learned counsel for the writ petitioners,\n\nquestioning the order/decision of the State as\n\ncontained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021, has\n\nsubmitted that the said order was passed by the\n\nState on the strength of direction passed by learned\n\nwrit Court in\nW.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor\n\nNayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors\n] disposed of\n\nvide order dated 26.09.2018, wherein prayer has\n\nbeen made for direction upon the respondents-State\n\nto pay them monetary benefits upon grant of Grade-I\n\nfrom the date of appointment and further Grade-II, as\n\nper the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in\n\nW.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the\n\nState of Jharkhand & ors.) and the direction was\n\npassed upon the State to take a uniform decision for\n\nextending the actual benefits of promotion to the\n\npetitioners.\n\n- 27 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nXI. It has been submitted that in the said\n\njudgments since there is no issue of granting Grade\n\nIV promotion taking into consideration inter se\n\nseniority, as in the instant case, but the State based\n\nupon the finding so given in\nW.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017\n\n[Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors\n],\n\nissued the impugned order/decision of the State as\n\ncontained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021 which\n\nrequires to be quashed and set aside.\n\n39. Learned counsel for the writ petitioners-appellants\n\nbased on the aforesaid ground has submitted that the order\n\npassed by learned Single Judge needs interference by this\n\nCourt.\n\nSubmission on behalf of respondents:\n\n40. Learned counsel for the State and the respondents-\n\npromotees have jointly defended the order passed by learned\n\nSingle Judge by raising the following grounds:\n\nI. It has been contended that the contesting private\n\nrespondents have been appointed in the year 1993-\n\n1994 and since then they were working in the scale of\n\nmatric trained scale however without any training\n\nand subsequent to training, by virtue of order passed\n\nby this Court they have been treated to be appointed\n\non Matric Trained Scale from the initial date of\n\n- 28 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\njoining and in consequence thereof, they have been\n\nentitled for matric trained scale from the date of their\n\ninitial appointment.\n\nII. It has further been contended that vacancies were\n\nthere but due to laches committed on the part of the\n\nState-authorities, the private respondents were not\n\ngranted promotion to higher Grades, as such they\n\ncome to this Court by filing writ petition being W.P.\n\n(S) No. 638 of 2006 [Arun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors], which was disposed of directing\n\nthe State to grant Grade-I pay scale from the date of\n\ninitial appointment and to consider for further\n\npromotion to Grade-IV i.e., Graduate Trained pay\n\nscale after 8/12 years of completion of service. The\n\norder passed by writ Court attained its finality up-to\n\nHon‟ble Supreme Court.\n\nIII. It has been submitted that in compliance\n\nthereof, many teachers were promoted with\n\nretrospective effect to one or other grades treating\n\nthem in Grade-I from the date of their\n\nappointments/joining. In compliance of the aforesaid\n\njudgments, the State of Jharkhand took a policy\n\ndecision vide Memo No. 3027 dated 14.12.2015 for\n\ngrant of Grade-I from the date of joining of the\n\n- 29 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nrespective teachers. The issue relating to grant of\n\nGrade-I from the date of joining/appointment,\n\ntherefore, attained its finality. Once they were treated\n\nin Grade-I from the date of appointment/joining, their\n\nseniority has to be fixed accordingly with their\n\nentitlement for promotion to respective Grades.\n\nIV. It has further been submitted that once the\n\nteachers attained the eligibility, they are entitled for\n\npromotion with effect from the date they were eligible\n\nand as such the State authority taking into\n\nconsideration these aspects of the matter has granted\n\npromotion with retrospective effect i.e., from the date\n\nof availability of vacancy i.e., 01.04.2015, which\n\ncannot be faulted with.\n\nV. It has been contended that the writ\n\npetitioners/appellants have been appointed\n\nsubsequent to the date of promotion and as such at\n\nthe time of preparing the seniority list of private\n\nrespondents and the writ petitioners, based upon the\n\nentry in the cadre the private respondents since have\n\nentered in the cadre prior to writ petitioner by way of\n\ngranting retrospective promotion, they have rightly\n\nbeen treated senior to that of writ petitioners.\n\n- 30 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nVI. It has been contended that the private\n\nrespondents have been promoted taking into\n\nconsideration the relevant rules of promotion i.e.,\n\nPromotion Rules, 1993 wherein specific provision has\n\nbeen made that promotion as also the inter se\n\nseniority, shall be determined on the basis of date of\n\nentry in the cadre and admittedly by virtue of\n\npromotion granted in favour of private respondents\n\nwith retrospective effect they have entered in the\n\ncadre prior to that of writ petitioners, the direct\n\nrecruits, and as such based upon Rule 8 of Rules,\n\n1993, the private respondents have been treated to be\n\nsenior to that of writ petitioners, the direct recruits.\n\nVII. It has further been argued that there is no\n\nfault on the part of the private respondents or\n\nsimilarly situated teachers, as they were appointed as\n\nuntrained in terms of the appointment rules\n\napplicable at the relevant point of time, which was\n\nframed under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. The promotions of teachers\n\nwere granted in terms of the said Promotion Rules,\n\n1993, in which, there is no bar to grant retrospective\n\npromotion/notional promotion, particularly in a case\n\nwhere delay is caused at the instance of the State.\n\n- 31 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nOnce a person became eligible and there is vacancy\n\navailable, he/she has a right to get promotion with all\n\nconsequential benefits. Merely for the fault on the\n\npart of the State, no one can be denied promotion\n\nfrom retrospective date.\n\nVIII. The ground has also been taken that the\n\nlearned Single Judge has passed the order taking into\n\nconsideration the order passed by this Court in the\n\ncase of\nArun Sinha & ors\n(Supra) and\nSunil\n\nKumar Bhagat\n(supra) wherein the issue of\n\nretrospectivity has been taken into consideration and\n\nbased upon the same the respondents-authorities\n\nhave been directed to pay all back wages of arrears of\n\nsalary. Meaning thereby this Court has come to the\n\nconclusive finding by holding the petitioners therein\n\nentitled for the back wages with retrospective\n\npromotion, which itself suggests the retrospective\n\npromotion is permissible.\n\nIX. Learned counsel further submits that there is\n\nnothing wrong in granting retrospective promotion\n\nwith effect from the date of entitlement and the\n\nvacancy being available. Taking these facts into\n\nconsideration, the State of Jharkhand since has\n\ntaken a uniform decision to grant retrospective/\n\n- 32 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nnotional promotion with effect from the date of\n\nentitlement of one or the other teachers vide decision\n\ndated 26.08.2021, that cannot be faulted with.\n\n41. Learned counsel for the respondents on the aforesaid\n\npretext has submitted that order passed by the learned Single\n\nJudge suffers from no error and requires no interference by\n\nthis Court.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n42. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, gone\n\nacross the finding recorded by learned Single Judge in the\n\nimpugned orders as also the relevant rules.\n\n43. The writ petitioners herein are mainly aggrieved with\n\npromotion order dated 28.12.2016, whereby many teachers\n\nincluding private respondents have been granted promotion\n\nto Grade-IV with retrospective effect from 01.04.2015, which\n\nallegedly involves dispute of inter se seniority between two\n\nsets of teachers.\n\n44. First set of teachers are the private respondents who\n\nwere initially appointed in the year 1993-94 in Grade I Scale,\n\nunder Bihar Primary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991, though\n\ninitially on untrained Trained Matric Pay-Scale but later on\n\ncompletion of required Teachers‟ Training and the order\n\npassed by this Court in different writ petitions they have been\n\n- 33 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nmade entitled for Grade I pay-scale since the date of their\n\nappointment.\n\n45. Whereas, the second set of teachers, the writ\n\npetitioners-appellants herein, are the direct recruits\n\nappointed under the Jharkhand Primary School Teacher\n\nAppointment Rules, 2012 in Grade IV, i.e., the entry level of\n\nGraduate Trained Scale appointed in the year December,\n\n2015.\n\n46. Meaning thereby the dispute is in between the inter se\n\nseniority between the direct recruits and the promotees.\n\n47. This Court, in order to come to adjudicate the dispute\n\nbetween the parties, requires to refer the admitted fact\n\ninvolved in the case.\n\nFactual aspect with respect to promotees:\n\n48. The erstwhile State of Bihar, for appointment of primary\n\nteachers, framed a rule vide notification dated 30.09.1991\n\nknown as „Bihar Prarambhik Vidyalaya Niyukti Niyamavali,\n\n1991‟ [Bihar Primary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991]\n\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Rules, 1991\") in exercise of\n\npower conferred under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia, wherein there was provision of appointment of\n\nteachers, both trained and untrained. But untrained teachers\n\nwere to obtain Teachers Training Certificate by way of in-\n\n- 34 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nservice training and till then they will be entitled to get only\n\nuntrained matric pay-scale.\n\n49. The State of Bihar further framed a rule, under the\n\npower conferred under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, for promotion of the teachers of\n\nelementary schools taken over by the Government in the\n\nname of \"Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers‟\n\nPromotion Rules, 1993\" (hereinafter referred to as \"the Rules,\n\n1993\") to be effective from 01.01.1986. After bifurcation, it\n\nhas been adopted by the State of Jharkhand. Rules 7 and 8\n\nthereof deals with „draft of seniority list for promotion‟ and\n\n„inter-se seniority in the same grade‟.\n\n50. The private respondents herein are the teachers\n\nappointed under Rules, 1991 and governed by the promotion\n\nRules of 1993.\n\n51. However, some disputes arose with regard to\n\nappointment of Elementary Teachers as to whether they\n\nshould be treated district-wise appointees or State wise\n\nbecause their appointment were conducted by Bihar Public\n\nService Commission. The matter ultimately went up-to the\n\nHon‟ble Apex Court in the case of\nRam Vijay Kumar & Ors.\n\nVs. State of Bihar & Ors\n[(1998) 9 SCC 227], wherein at\n\nparagraph 5, the Hon‟ble Apex Court took serious view of the\n\nmatter that no steps were taken by the State Government for\n\n- 35 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nimparting training to the untrained teachers, as such\n\ndirection was given to take immediate steps to finalize\n\nsyllabus and commence the training of untrained teachers\n\nw.e.f. 01.10.1997.\n\n52. Pursuant thereto though training was completed but\n\nbenefit of Grade I was not given from the initial date of\n\nappointment, as such the aggrieved teachers approached this\n\nCourt invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court, one of the\n\nleading case is\nArun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of Jharkhand\n\n& Ors\n[W.P. (S) No. 638 of 2006], in which direction was\n\npassed to grant Grade-I pay scale from the date of initial\n\nappointment and to consider for further promotion to Grade-\n\nIV i.e., Graduate Trained pay scale after 8/12 years of\n\ncompletion of service. Against that order, the State of\n\nJharkhand preferred appeal being LPA No. 214 of 2008 with\n\nanalogous cases, which was dismissed vide order dated\n\n06.11.2012. The matter went up-to Hon‟ble Apex Court in\n\nSLP(C) No. 5520-5522 of 2013, which was also dismissed\n\nvide order dated 08.03.2011.\n\n53. Similarly, in the case of Sunil Kumar Bhagat and ors.\n\nVs. State of Jharkhand & Ors with analogous cases, in\n\nW.P. (S) No. 2547 of 2014, this Court directed the\n\nrespondents-State to grant Grade I scale to the teachers from\n\nthe initial date of appointment.\n\n- 36 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n54. In view of the judgments passed by this Court, the State\n\nGovernment has come out with a decision as contained in\n\nResolution No. 3027 dated 14.12.2015, in which, a decision\n\nwas taken by the State Government to grant Grade I Matric\n\nTrained Scale from the initial date of appointment of such\n\nteachers in whose case there was delay in imparting training\n\nand publication of results. However, in the aforesaid\n\nresolution, it was clearly mentioned that it will not be treated\n\nas precedent.\n\nFactual aspect with respect to recruits (writ petitioners):\n\n55. The Human Resource Development Department of the\n\nState of Jharkhand under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, vide notification no. 1632 dated\n\n05.09.2012, framed a rule, Jharkhand Primary School Teacher\n\nAppointment Rules, 2012 (in short referred to as 'Rule, 2012').\n\n56. Accordingly, the State of Jharkhand issued Notification\n\ncontained in Memo No. 1533 dated 31.7.2014, whereby a\n\ndecision was taken to appoint teachers for classes 6 to 8 in\n\nterms of\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education\n\nAct, 2009\n. It was clarified that 50% of the said posts would be\n\nfilled up by direct recruitment and rest by way of promotion\n\nfrom elementary school teachers.\n\n57. Pursuant thereto, an advertisement was issued for\n\nappointment of such teachers and the members of petitioner\n\n- 37 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nno.1 and petitioner no.2 in W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021, as also\n\npetitioners of W.P.(S) No.3365 of 2020 were appointed in\n\ndifferent districts in the year 2015 onwards in the quota\n\nfixed for direct recruitment.\n\n58. Admittedly, herein the private respondents were initially\n\nappointed on Grade I pay-scale whereas the petitioners\n\nherein are the direct appointees on Grade IV in the year\n\nDecember, 2015 onwards.\n\n59. Further admitted fact herein is that after the\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners in the month of\n\nDecember, 2015 and January, 2016 on the post of Graduate\n\nTrained Teacher in Grade IV and while discharging duty as\n\nsuch, the respondents-authorities vide office order as\n\ncontained in memo dated 28.12.2016 granted promotion to\n\nlarge number of teachers, who were appointed as per the\n\nPromotion Rules, 1993, in Graduate Trained Pay Scale of\n\nGrade -IV [in Science, Arts and Language Stream] with\n\nretrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the promotes\n\nhave been made senior to the direct recruits, the appellants\n\nherein, who were appointed in December, 2015 and January,\n\n2016.\n\n60. Later on, decision has been taken by the State-\n\nauthority, as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated\n\n26.08.2021 issued under the signature of Joint Secretary to\n\n- 38 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nthe Government, School Education and Literacy Department,\n\nGovt. of Jharkhand, for giving promotion to the teachers, who\n\nare working in Grade-3, 4 and 7, on notional basis and\n\nfurther decision has been taken to grant promotion with\n\nretrospective effect from the date of availability of vacancy.\n\n61. The writ petitioners, being aggrieved with the promotion\n\norders as contained in different memos vide order dated\n\n28.12.2016 as also Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021,\n\nhas approached this Court by filing writ petitions on the\n\nground that though their appointment on the post of Trained\n\nGraduate Teachers in the stream of Science, Arts and\n\nLanguage in Grade IV have been made in December, 2015\n\nand January, 2016 but the respondents-authorities granted\n\npromotion to the private respondents vide office order dated\n\n28.12.2016 in Graduate Trained Pay Scale with retrospective\n\neffect from 01.04.2015 i.e., much prior to the date of\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners-appellants, which would\n\nadversely affect the future promotion of the direct recruits\n\nlike that of writ petitioners and disturb the inter se seniority\n\nof the writ petitioners/appellants and they would be ranked\n\nlower to such teachers who have been granted promotion\n\nwith retrospective effect.\n\n62. The learned Single Judge, taking into consideration the\n\nrelevant provisions of Appointment Rules, 1991; Promotion\n\n- 39 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nRules, 1993 and Appointment Rules, 2012 and other\n\nprovisions of law as also the law\nlaid down by\nCourt of law in\n\nthe case of\nSunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors.\n(supra) and\nArun Sinha\n(supra)\n\ndismissed the writ petitions being W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021\n\nand W.P. (S) No. 3365 of 2020, which is the subject matter\n\nof instant intra-court appeals.\n\n63. Therefore, this Court deems it fit and proper to now go\n\nthrough the relevant provision of Rules, 1991; Rules, 1993\n\nand Rules, 2012 as also the case laws on which reliance has\n\nbeen placed by the parties as also by learned Single Judge.\n\n64. The private respondents were appointed on the basis of\n\nappointment Rules of 1991, namely, Bihar Primary School\n\nTeachers‟ Rules, 1991] wherein there was provision of\n\nappointment of teachers, both trained and untrained. But\n\nuntrained teachers were to obtain Teachers Training\n\nCertificate by way of in-service training and till then they will\n\nbe entitled to get only untrained matric pay-scale.\n\n65. As per the provisions contained under Rule 11 of Rules,\n\n1991, the private respondents without having Teachers\n\nTraining were appointed as such they were initially granted\n\nMatric Untrained Scale.\n\n66. The Rule 11 of Rules, 1991 speaks that the candidate\n\nwho possesses teachers training certificate shall be entitled\n\n- 40 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nfor matric trained scale and who does not have teachers\n\ntraining certificate, at the time of appointment, will be\n\nappointed on matric untrained scale. It was further averred\n\nthat immediately after passing of Teachers Training\n\nExamination, the said untrained teachers will be entitled to\n\nget the pay-scale and benefit as Matric Trained Scale.\n\n67. For ready reference, Rule 11 of Rules, 1991 is quoted as\n\nunder:\n\n11- ojh;rk lwph esa vkj{k.k fu;eksa dk vuqikyu djrs gq, fjfDr;ksa dks Hkjus ds fy,\nfuEu izdkj dkjZokbZ dh tk;xh\n¼1½ tks mEehnokj izf\"kf{kr gSa] mUgsa eSfVªd izf\"kf{kr osrueku esa fu;qDr\nfd;k tk;sxkA\n¼2½ tks mEehnokj vizf\"kf{kr gSa] mUgsa eSfVªd vizf\"kf{kr osrueku ds\nizkjfEHkd osrueku esa fuEu \"kÙkksZa ds lkFk fu;qDr fd;k tk;sxk%\n¼d½ izf\"k{k.k ds fy, izfrfu;qDr fd;s tkus ij mlesa i;kZIr dkj.k\nds Hkkx u ysus ij lsok lekIr dj nh tk;sxhA\n¼[k½ izf\"k{k.k mijkUr ijh{kk yh tk;sxh mlesa mEehnokj ;fn\nlQy ugha gksrk gS rks mls ,d ekSdk vkSj fn;k tk;sxk ;fn\nnwljh ckj Hkh og vuqÙkh.kZ jgrk gS rks mldh lsok lekIr dj nh\ntk;xhA\n¼x½ izf\"k{k.k dh vof/k esa le;&le; ij fu/kkZfjr nj ij o`fÙkdk\nek= ns; gksxhA izf\"k{k.k vof/k ds fy, osru ns; ugha gksxkA\n¼?k½ dafMdk ¼[k½ esa fufnZ\"V ijh{kk esa mÙkh.kZ gksus ds mijkUr\neSfVªd izf\"kf{kr osrueku fn;k tk;sxkA\n\n68. But when no in-service Teachers‟ Training was\n\nconducted, the aggrieved teachers approached this Court by\n\nfiling number of writ petitions. Further, the dispute with\n\nregard to appointment of Elementary Teachers as to whether\n\nthey should be treated district-wise appointees or State wise\n\n- 41 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nbecause their appointment were conducted by Bihar Public\n\nService Commission, the matter ultimately went up-to the\n\nHon‟ble Apex Court in the case of\nRam Vijay Kumar & Ors.\n\nVs. State of Bihar & Ors\n[(1998) 9 SCC 227], wherein at\n\nparagraph 5, the Hon‟ble Apex Court took serious view of the\n\nmatter that no steps were taken by the State Government for\n\nimparting training to the untrained teachers, as such a\n\ndirection was given to take immediate steps to finalize\n\nsyllabus and commence the training of untrained teachers\n\nw.e.f. 01.10.1997.\n\n69. For ready reference, the factual aspect and finding given\n\nby Hon‟ble Apex Court at paragraph 1 and 5 respectively are\n\nquoted as under:\n\n\"1. This special leave petition relates to recruitment of\nAssistant Teachers in Elementary/Primary Schools in\nthe State of Bihar. The said recruitment was made on\nthe basis of an advertisement issued on 8-10-1991. The\npetitioners in this special leave petition are persons who\npossess teaching qualifications obtained from\nGovernment/Private Teachers' Training Institutions. They\nhad filed a writ petition in the High Court assailing the\nprocess of selection by the Bihar Public Service Commission\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Commission\"). The grievance\nwas that the selection was made on districtwise basis and\nthe persons who had applied from a particular district were\ntreated as applicants and aspirants for appointment to the\nposts in that particular district only. The said writ petition\nhas been disposed of by the High Court by the impugned\njudgment dated 26-9-1996. The High Court has held that the\neligible candidates have a right of consideration for their\n\n- 42 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nappointment in any one or other district cadre of Assistant\nTeachers and the State could not force a person to confine\nhis application for a particular district cadre at the time of\napplication. But keeping in view the facts and circumstances,\nthe High Court has not set aside the impugned selection and\nthe appointments made on the basis of such selection.\n\n5. From the affidavit of Shri Deepak Kumar it appears that\nalthough appointment of Assistant Teachers on the\nbasis of the impugned selection was made in August\n1994 no steps have been taken so far by the State\nGovernment for imparting training to the untrained\nteachers. All that has been said in the affidavit of Shri\nDeepak Kumar is that the training period of two years is\nbeing reduced to one year and the syllabus for the one-year\ncourse is yet to be prepared. This lackadaisical approach\nin the matter of imparting training to persons who are\nrequired to teach students is indefensible. It is,\ntherefore, directed that the State Government shall\ntake immediate steps to finalise the syllabus and that\nthe training courses for training of the untrained\nteachers should commence from 1-10-1997. It must be\nensured that all the untrained teachers who have been\nappointed as per the aforementioned selection are duly\ntrained within two years' time.\"\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n70. It needs to refer herein that the some of the teachers\n\nappointed in the year 1993-94 since at the time of entering\n\ninto service were a simple matriculate as such they were\n\ninducted in service in the untrained matric scale.\n\n71. Since, there was delay in deputing the untrained\n\nteachers for in-service training, because of which they were\n\nnot getting Grade-I pay scale, as a result of which various\n\nwrit petitions were filed before the High Court and further\n\n- 43 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nuntrained teachers remained stagnant in the same scale for\n\nlong period of time without any up-gradation, the aggrieved\n\nsubmitted representation before the respondents-authority,\n\nwhich was rejected vide office order dated 03.05.2003 stating\n\nthat the untrained teachers would be entitled to Grade I only\n\nfrom the date of attaining training.\n\n72. Aggrieved thereof, similarly situated persons approached\n\nthis Court by filing writ petition being W.P. (S) No. 5465 of\n\n2007 in the case of\nAwadh Bihari Mishra & Ors. Vs. The\n\nState of Jharkhand & Ors\nseeking therein prayer for grant\n\nof Grade I scale from the date of appointment and seniority\n\nfrom the date of appointment with a further prayer to grant\n\npromotion to Grade I to Grade VII. The said writ petition was\n\nallowed vide order 18.06.2008 directing the State to grant\n\nGrade I from the date of joining and not from the date of\n\ncompletion of Teachers Training.\n\n73. For ready reference, the relevant paragraph of the\n\njudgment is quoted as under:\n\n\"In this writ petition the petitioners have prayed for\nquashing the letter dated 3.5.03 (Annexure-13) whereby the\nrepresentation of the petitioners has been rejected holding\nthat the untrained teachers would not be entitled for\npromotion from Grade-I scale onwards and that they would\nbe entitled for promotion to Grade-I scale only from the date\nof obtaining the Teachers' Training.\n\nThe petitioners were appointed as untrained teachers by the\nHuman Resources Development Department, Government of Bihar\n\n- 44 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nin accordance with its policy decision and resolution dated\n5.3.1991. The Government of Bihar had also framed the Rules\nknown as the Bihar Primary School Teachers' Rule, 1991 In\nexercise of its power under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India\nwherein there was a provision for appointing the in-service\nuntrained teachers and after appointment, for sending the said\nteachers for in-service Teachers Training in the Government\nColleges.\n\nThe petitioners were untrained Graduate and were\nappointed in the year 1994 on the basis of the merit list prepared\nafter completing all the legal formalities. The Director, Primary\nEducation, Government of Bihar by Letter No.-998/95 dated 7.6.95\ntook a decision to grant Grade-1 scale of the Matric Trained to the\nuntrained teachers who ware Graduate. However, after the\nappointment of teachers, they were not sent for training. The\nappointment procedure was also challenged before the Patna High\nCourt. The matter went up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.LP\n(Civil) No. 23187/1996 (Ram Vinay Kumar & Ors: Vs. State of\nBihar & Ors.). In the said S.LP, the Supreme Court gave certain\ndirection on the State of Bihar for sending the petitioners for service\ntraining. The Finance Department, Government of Jharkhand by\nletter No. 4568 dated 5.7.02 granted Grade-1 Matric Trained scale\nto such untrained teachers w.e.f 1.1.1996. It was also decided that\nthe seniority position of the petitioners shall be maintained as per\nthe merit list prepared at the time of their appointment. However,\nthe petitioners have been stagnated in the same scale for more\nthan 12 years without any up-gradation. In the scale. Although the\npersons appointed with the petitioners have been promoted from\nGrade-1 scale to Grade-IV scale, the petitioners have not been\ngiven even Grade-11 scale. They made representation though their\nAssociation which was rejected by the Government of Jharkhand\nIndicating that the untrained teachers would not be entitled for\npromotion from Grade-1 scale to Grade-VIII scale and that they\nwould be entitled to Grade-1 scale only from the date of attaining\nthe Teachers Training. The petitioners are aggrieved by the said\norder.\n\n- 45 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nToday when the case is taken up for hearing, It has been\nsubmitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that in the similar\nfact situation, other writ petitions have been disposed of by this\nCourt holding that the petitioners' seniority is to be counted from\nthe date-of-their appointment and that the petitioners are entitled\nfor consideration of fixing their seniority from the date of their\nappointment and also for consideration of giving the benefit of\nGrade-IV scale after completion of 8/12 years of their service. Such\ndirections have already been given by this Court in W.P(S)\nNo.4235/2004 (\nBalwant Sahay Vs. The State of Jharkhand & Ors.\n)\nand W.P(S) No. 638/2006 (\nArun Sinha Vs. The State of Jharkhand\n& Ors.\n).\n\nThe said legal position has hot been disputed by learned\ncounsel for the respondents.\n\nI have perused the decisions/directions given by this Court\nin the said cases. This case is squarely covered by the sald\ndecisions of this Court. In view thereof, the impugned order/letter\ndated 3.5.2003 contained in Anenxure-13 is, herby, quashed. It is\nheld that the respondents are entitled to get Grade-I scale\nfrom the date of their joining from i.e., on 29.10.1994 and\nnot from the date of completion of the Teachers' Training.\n\nThis writ petition is allowed in the said terms.\"\n\n74. Similar issue was raised in the case of\nArun Sinha &\n\nOrs. Vs. The State of Jharkhand & Ors\n[W.P. (S) No. 638\n\nof 2006] which was disposed of vide order dated 04.04.2008,\n\nwherein also, it has been held that the petitioners‟ case\n\nshould be considered for holding their seniority from the date\n\nof their appointment and it was further held that their case\n\nshould be considered for giving benefit of Grade IV scales\n\nafter completion of 8/12 years of their service.\n\n75. For ready reference, the entire order passed by learned\n\nSingle Judge is quoted hereunder as since, much emphasis\n\n- 46 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nhas been laid on this judgment by the private respondents as\n\nalso the State:\n\n\"Heard the parties finally.\n\n2. Mr. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,\nsubmitted as follows. The petitioner's were appointed in\nSeptember/October, 1994 as Assistant Primary Teachers on\nthe recommendation of the BPSC and on the basis of merit. The\nminimum qualification for appointment of such teachers was matric\nand weightage was to be given to trained, but as the petitioners\nhad higher qualifications namely graduation and above they were\ngiven matric trained scale since their appointment, in the light of\nthe government circulars. They were given replacement scales\nsubsequently of Grade-1. Petitioners repeatedly requested for\nsending them for training but they were sent only in 1998,\nand that too only after the orders passed by the Supreme\nCourt on 5.9.1997. They completed the training in the year\n1999 but the result was published in the year 2002 only\nafter the intervention of the Court. In the circumstances,\npetitioners were not at fault in not acquiring training.\nTherefore, the petitioners should be given grade IV scale as\nthey have also completed the requisite period Le. 8/12 years\nin service. He also relied on clause 3 (Kha) of the Circular dated\n25.6.1909, issued by the Finance Department, Government of\nBihar, in which, it is said that the seniority of the untrained\nprimary teachers will remain intact, in any case, even if they do not\npass the training examination or if they do not get training. He also\nrelied on the order dated 5.1.2007 passed in WPS No. 6264 of\n2005 Jharkhand Police Association etc. and submitted that\npetitioners cannot be made to suffer if they were not sent for\ntraining and there was delay in completing the training.\n\n3.Counsel for the State on the other hand submitted as follows. It\nis true that on the basis of merit list and ranking list of the\npetitioners, they were appointed against matric trained pay-scale\nin accordance with different orders/directions of the State\nGovernment, and that as per the said Circular dated 25.6.1999,\nthe seniority is to be counted from the date of appointment, but in\n\n- 47 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nview of paragraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993, petitioners are\nentitled for, grade 1 pay-scale from the date of passing Teachers\nTraining Examination ic. 3.5.2002. He lastly submitted that\nseniority list is yet to be finalized.\n\n4. It is not disputed that petitioners were appointed in\nSeptember/October 1994 in the matric trained scale and were\nsubsequently, given replacement scale of Grade-1 as per the\ncurrent Circular. It is also not disputed that only after the\nintervention of the Court, petitioners were sent for training in 1998,\nand the result was published only in 2002 on the intervention of\nthe Court. Therefore, it, cannot be said that petitioners were at fault\nin not getting training.\nIn these circumstances\n,\nthe said judgment\nof\n\nJharkhand Police Association\n(Supra) supports the case of the\npetitioner. It is also not disputed that as per the Circular dated\n25.6.1999, which is subsequent to the Circular dated 9.7.1993,\npetitioner's seniority is to be counted from their dates of\nappointment.\n\n5. In the facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed\nabove, petitioners' case should be considered for having\ntheir seniority from the date of their appointment. They\nshould also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV\nscales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.\n\nAccordingly, the petitioners will be at liberty to file\nindividual representations, on which, the Director, Human\nResources Development Department ( Primary Education),\nGovernment of Jharkhand, Ranchi ( respondent no. 2) will\npass necessary orders in terms of this order within four weeks\nfrom the date of receipt/production of the representations.\n\nWith these observations and directions, this writ petition is\ndisposed of. No costs.\"\n\n76. The State preferred intra-court appeal against the\n\norder passed by learned Single Judge by filing L.P.A. No. 214\n\nof 2008 and analogous cases [\nThe State of Jharkhand &\n\nOrs. Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors.\n], which was dismissed vide\n\ncommon order dated 6th November, 2012.\n\n- 48 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n77. For ready reference, the judgment passed in L.P.A. No.\n\n214 of 2008 and analogous cases [\nThe State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors. Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors.\n], is quoted as\n\nunder:\n\n\"Heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\nThese Letters Patent Appeals are decided by this common\norder since identical question is involved in these appeals.\n\nThe writ petitioners-respondents are the appointees of the\nyear 1993-94. When they were appointed, they were untrained\nteachers. The petitioners' contention is that they requested the\nappellant-State to send them for training so that they may not be\nput in the category of untrained teachers. However, they were sent\nfor training in the year 1998, and that too only in view of the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 05.9.1997. The\npetitioners completed the training in the year 1999 but the result\nwas published in the year 2002 only and that too after intervention\nof the Court. The petitioners, therefore, claimed that they should be\ngiven Grade IV scale as they have also completed the requisite\nperiod i.e., 8/12 years in service from the date of their\nappointment. The petitioners also submitted that in view of the\nCircular of the Government dated 25.6.1999 of Finance\nDepartment, Government of Bihar, it has been specifically clarified\nthat the seniority of the untrained primary teachers will remain\nintact, in any case, even if they do not pass the training\nexamination or if they do not get training.\n\nLearned Single Judge accepted the contention of the writ\npetitioners in toto and observed that though they were initially\nappointed as untrained teachers and they were entitled to training\nwhich were provided to them by the Government in the year 1998\nand that too in view of the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt. The petitioners took and completed the training in the year\n1999 but their result was published in the year 2002 and that too\nwhen the Court intervened. In these facts and circumstances of the\ncase, the petitioners were not at fault in not getting the training but\nit was the fault of the State Government. In view of the above\n\n- 49 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nreasons, the writ petition filed by the petitioners was allowed,\nhence, the present L.P.As have been preferred by the State.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the\nCircular dated 25.6.1999 though provided that seniority will not be\naffected by training or nontraining as provided under Clause\n3(Kha) of the said Circular, that Circular has been withdrawn\nretrospectively by the decision of the Cabinet of Government, dated\n16.9.2000 and, therefore, petitioners are entitled to any relief of\nbeing untrained teachers at the time of appointment.\n\nLearned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that so is\nthe position in Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers\nPromotion Rules, 1993 and relied upon Rule 13 of the said Rules\nwherein it has been provided that untrained teachers shall not be\neligible for promotion to any of the Grade i.e. 1 to 8 and as per the\nsaid sub-rule (3) of Rule 13, an untrained teacher may be given\nGrade 1 from the date on which he becomes trained.\n\nWe have considered the submission of the learned counsel\nfor the parties and perused the reasons given in the impugned\nJudgment.\n\nLearned Single Judge has carefully considered all the issues\ninvolved in the petition and found that the petitioners were though\nappointed in the year 1993-94 but they were not provided training\nby the fault of the State only and even the training was provided\nonly after passing of the order by Hon'ble Supreme Court on\n05.9.1997. Even when the petitioners completed training in the\nyear 1999, their result was not published and after intervention of\nthe Court, that result was published in the year 2002. Therefore, in\nthat fact situation the petitioners are not at fault in obtaining\ntraining. Not only this, but in our considered opinion also, once\nseniority is required to be determined in view of the Circular dated\n25.6.1999 and that stands determined because of that Circular\nand the same could not be made ineffective by the subsequent\nwithdrawal of the said Circular by the State Cabinet with\nretrospective effect. However, that was not the issue decided by\nthe learned Single Judge as it has been raised by the petitioners\nbut effect of that Circular, which has already been given, cannot be\ntaken away and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are\n\n- 50 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nof the considered opinion that there is no merit in these L.P.As.\nwhich are, accordingly, dismissed.\"\n\n78. Against the order passed in the said intra-court appeals\n\nthe State went to the Hon‟ble Apex Court by filing S.L.A.\n\n(Civil) No. 5520-5522 of 2013 in the case of\nState of\n\nJharkhand & Ors Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors\nwhich was also\n\ndismissed.\n\n79. Similarly, the series of writ petitions, leading case is\n\nSunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &\n\nOrs\n[WPS No. 2547 of 2014] was filed with respect of claim\n\nof individual petitioners for grant of Grade-I Scale and\n\nseniority from the date of their initial joining as Assistant\n\nTeachers in Elementary Schools within the State. These\n\npetitioners have relied upon the judgment rendered by this\n\nCourt in the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs. State of\n\nJharkhand & others passed in W.P.S. No. 638 of 2006 vide\n\norder dated 4.4.2008. The batch of writ petitions was\n\ndisposed of vide order dated 17.12.2015. The relevant portion\n\nof the judgment is quoted as under:\n\n9. This issue relating to seniority from the date of initial joining and\ngrant of Grade-I scale to the Assistant Teacher in Primary school\nhas engaged the attention of this Court in several matters. The\nrespondent- State has in due deference to the\nratio\nlaid down in\nthe\ncase of\nArun Sinha & others\n(supra) now taken a policy decision\nto grant the said benefit as per the terms of the said resolution\nquoted herein above to individual incumbents. It would now be\nproper that the cases of individual petitioners who fall within the\nterms of the resolution dated 14.12.2015, quoted herein above, be\n\n- 51 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nconsidered by the respondents- District authorities. The District\nSuperintendent of Education of authority‟s respective districts\nwould examine the individual cases as per the procedure\nlaid\ndown by\nplacing the matter before the District Education\nEstablishment Committee for taking an informed decision in respect\nof individual claims in accordance with law and the aforesaid\npolicy decision within a reasonable time, preferably 16 weeks from\nthe date of receipt of copy of this order.\n\n10. It would not be out of place to record appreciation for the\nefforts taken by the State counsels and the respondent-\n\nDepartment in coming out with the policy resolution, which may\npossibly reduce institution of large number of cases with similar\ngrievances in this Court.\n\n11.

I is concerned, in my view and\nopinion the said issue may be treated to be conclusively\ndecided upto the level of the Hon'ble Apex Court and not only\nthe writ petitioners but all other similarly situated teachers\nmay be directed to be granted Grade-1 Scale from the date of\ntheir appointment and not from the date of completion of their\ntraining.\n\nSo for the issue no. Il is concerned, the Hon'ble High\nCourt had in the case of Arun Sinha and ors. directed\nthe State Government to consider for giving benefit of\nGrade-4 Scale after completion of 8/12 years of their\nservice. The Hon'ble Division Bench did not although\ndiscuss that issue and concentrated mainly on first\nissue itself but in view of the dismissal of the LPA and SLP\nthat direction/judgment has attained finality.\n\nIt does not transpire from the records as to what\ndecision has been taken after the concerned order of the\nHon'ble Court dated 04.04.08 passed in the case of Arun\nSinha and ors in the matter of grant of Grade 4 Scale to\nthem.\n\nHowever, I must point out that with respect to the\nmatter of grant of Grade-4 Scale to the writ petitioners\nor other similarly situated teachers, the department\nmay very well consider all the aspects including the\nvarious provisions i.e. Rule 5,6&7 of the concerned\n1993 Rules, (except the condition no. 2 of Rule-4) and\nfind out as to whether the writ petitioners or other\nsimilar situated teachers will be entitled to get Grade -\n4 Scale after completion of their service of 8/12 years\n\n- 53 - L.P.A.

Rule 6 deals with the provision of availability of post‟s\n\nfor promotion, wherein provision has been made that the\n\nEstablishment Committee shall calculate for each year the\n\nvacant posts as on 1st April of that year for promotion.\n\n89. Rule 7 deals with the provision of draft of seniority list\n\nfor promotion, wherein it has been provided that by the end\n\nof the month of January of each year, the draft of the\n\nseniority list, based on the position that existed on 31st of\n\nDecember of the previous year, shall be prepared according to\n\nthe standard\nlaid down in\nRule 8 by the District\n\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\n90. Rule 8 provides inter-se seniority in the same grade,\n\nupon which much emphasis has been laid down. It has been\n\nstated as under Rule 8 Inter se seniority of teachers working\n\n- 61 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nin the same grade shall be decided in the manner that - (1)\n\nthe date of getting the said grade shall be the basis for\n\ndetermining the seniority. If the date of getting the grade is\n\nthe same, then date of getting lower grade shall be the basis\n\nand accordingly date of getting lowest grade, whereever\n\nrequired, shall be the basis; (2) In case of the date of getting\n\nthe grade is the same, date of birth shall be the basis; (3) In\n\ncase of date of birth being the same\n,\nin that case\ninter-\n\nse seniority shall be determined according to the alphabetical\n\norder of their names in Roman script.‟\n\n91. This Court needs to refer herein that the provision of\n\nRule 8 is with respect to inter se seniority in a Grade of the\n\npromotes having no nexus of preparation of seniority list of\n\nthe „Direct Recruits‟ and the „Promotees‟, as the case herein.\n\nSuch observation is being made by this Court due to the\n\nreason that when the Promotion Rule, 1993 was enacted\n\nthere was no mode of direct recruitment to the post of\n\n„Trained Graduate Teacher‟ in Grade IV rather the decision\n\nhas been taken for fulfilling the post through direct\n\nrecruitment only after coming into effect of\nRight of Children\n\nto Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\nand in order to\n\nachieve the intent and object of the said Act, the Jharkhand\n\nPrimary School Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was enacted\n\n- 62 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nfor making direct recruitment on the post of Graduate\n\nTrained Teacher in Grade IV.\n\n92. Rule 9 of Rules, 2012 thereof stipulates that all the\n\nvacancies of Class 1 to 5 will be filled amongst Intermediate\n\nTrained and for classed 6 to 8, 50% vacancies will be filled up\n\nby Graduate Trained Teachers through direct recruitment\n\nprocess.\n\n93. The basic purpose of\nRight of Children to Free and\n\nCompulsory Education Act, 2009\n, was of ensuring every\n\nchild‟s access to quality education. It is a legislative initiative\n\nthat seeks to make education a fundamental right for every\n\nchild aged 6 to 14 years in India.\nThe Act\nemphasizes the\n\nimportance of free and compulsory education, focusing on\n\ninclusivity, equity, and quality.\n\n94. It is admitted case that the writ petitioners-appellants\n\nhave been appointed on the post of Graduate Trained Teacher\n\nin Grade IV to fulfill the object and intent of\nRight of Children\n\nto Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009\npursuant to\n\nwhich Jharkhand Primary School Teacher Appointment\n\nRules, 2012 was framed.\n\n95. The private respondents have been inducted in the\n\nservice and thereafter, according to them, they are entitled to\n\nbe granted to promotion to different Grades from the date of\n\ntheir entitlement, but the same has not been granted.\n\n- 63 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n96. While on the other hand, the case of the appellants-writ\n\npetitioners, is that they have been appointed through direct\n\nmode of recruitment on the basis of 50% quota, in December,\n\n2015 and January, 2016, as provided under the provisions of\n\nRule, 2012, as Graduate Trained Teacher in Grade IV.\n\n97. We have already noted above that posts of primary\n\nteachers are in three Cadres. At the cost of repetition, it is\n\nagain being referred herein that first cadre is of - Matric\n\nTrained teachers; second cadre i.e., Grade IV to VI are of\n\nGraduate Trained Teachers whereas third Cadre i.e., Grade\n\nVII and VIII are said to be post of the Headmasters. All the\n\nhierarchy of posts carries different pay-scales.\n\n98. In Matric Trained Scale, Grade I is the basic cadre\n\nMatric Trained Pay-scale whereas Grade II and Grade III are\n\nthe senior scale and selection grade scale respectively.\n\n99. In Graduate Trained Scale, Grade IV is the basic cadre\n\nwhereas two Grade V and Grade VI, are senior scale and\n\nSelection Grade Scale respectively of Graduate Pay Scale.\n\n100. In Headmaster Cadre, Grade VII is the basic Grade\n\nwhereas Grade VIII is senior scale of Headmaster pay-scale.\n\n101. Meaning thereby, entry Grade for Matric Trained Scale\n\nis Grade I, for Graduate Trained Scale Grade IV is the basic\n\nGrade whereas for Headmaster Cade Grade VII is the basic\n\nGrade.\n\n- 64 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n102. Prior to coming into effect of Rules, 2012, primary\n\nteachers were to be appointed in Grade I and as per Rules,\n\n1993 they were supposed to be granted promotion from\n\nGrade I to Grade VIII, as per their entitlement and there was\n\nno issue of inter se seniority between the promotes and direct\n\nrecruits. But after coming into effect of Rules, 2012, there\n\nwas direct appointment on the basic cadre of „Graduate\n\nTrained Teacher‟ in Grade IV.\n\n103. Admittedly, the private respondents were not promoted\n\nthe day when the writ petitioners were appointed and\n\ninducted in service in Grade IV through direct mode i.e., in\n\nDecember, 2015 and January, 2016, the basic post of\n\nGraduate Trained Teacher. But, the private respondents have\n\nbeen promoted vide order dated 28.12.2016 but with\n\nretrospective effect from 01.04.2015.\n\n104. Being aggrieved with such promotion of granting\n\npromotion with retrospective effect, the writ petitioners have\n\napproached this Court taking the ground that promotion with\n\nretrospective effect has been granted to the private\n\nrespondents only with a purpose to make the directs recruits\n\nlike petitioners junior in the cadre though they borne in the\n\ncadre prior to private respondents and have been inducted in\n\nservice when the private respondents did not borne in service.\n\n- 65 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n105. But, the learned Single Judge taking into consideration\n\nthe long length of service of the interveners-private\n\nrespondents, came to the conclusion that the private\n\nrespondents are treated to be senior to that of direct recruits\n\nand further learned Single Judge took note of the law\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthe case of\nArun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of\n\nJharkhand\n(supra) and Sunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs.\n\nThe State of Jharkhand & Ors. (supra) and did not\n\ninterfere with the order of promotion which was given with\n\nretrospective effect to the private respondents.\n\n106. This Court, on the basis of aforesaid facts, submissions\n\nand law laid down by Court of law, is of the view that\n\nfollowing issues are required to be answered for adjudication\n\nof lis:\n\n\"(I).Whether grant of retrospective promotion w.e.f.\n\n01.04.2015 vide office order dated 28.12.2016 to the private\n\nrespondents in Grade IV, based upon the provision of Rules,\n\n1993, after appointment of direct recruits in December, 2015\n\nin Grade IV, under Rules, 2012, can be said to be justified\n\nwhich allegedly have adverse impact to the interest in\n\nparticular inter se seniority, on the direct recruits?\"\n\n(II).Whether merely because the private respondents have\n\nbeen inducted in service in the year 1993-94, and as such by\n\ntaking their long length of service can they be extended the\n\nbenefit of retrospective promotion to Grade IV by treating them\n\n- 66 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nto be senior, over and above, the direct recruits, who have\n\nbeen appointed by virtue of enactment of new Rules, 2012\n\ndirectly on Grade IV?\n\n(III).Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, after\n\ncoming into effect of Rules, 2012, the retrospective promotion\n\ngranted under provisions of Rule 8 of Rules, 1993 to the\n\nprivate respondents can be said to be justified without taking\n\ncare of inter se seniority of the direct recruits?\n\n(IV).Whether grant of promotion in view of provision of Rule 8\n\nof Rules, 1993 can be a rider upon the direct recruits for\n\nconsidering them junior to that of promotees, the private\n\nrespondents?\n\n(V).Whether the judgments rendered by this Court in the case\n\nof the\nArun Sinha\n(supra) and\nSunil Kumar Bhagat\n\n(supra), reliance upon which has been placed by learned\n\nSingle Judge also while dismissing the writ petition, are\n\napplicable in the facts and circumstances of the case, where\n\nthe core issue is of inter se seniority between the writ\n\npetitioners [direct recruits] and the private respondents\n\n[promotees]?\n\n(VI).Whether the policy decision taken by the State vide\n\nresolution 26.08.2021, without taking into consideration the\n\nadverse impact of the same upon the direct recruits after\n\ncoming into effect of Rules, 2012, can be said to be justified\n\nand sustainable in the eye of law?\"\n\n- 67 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n107. Since all the issues are inter-linked, and as such they\n\nare taken up together to be answered.\n\n108. The core issue involved in the lis is the retrospective\n\npromotion granted to the private respondents without taking\n\ncare of the inter se seniority of the direct recruits.\n\n109. So far the issue of grant of retrospective\n\npromotion/notional promotion is concerned, there is no bar\n\nto grant retrospective promotion/notional promotion with\n\neffect from the date of one‟s entitlement and the vacancy\n\nbeing available and particularly the fact when delay is caused\n\nat the instance of the State. There is nothing wrong in\n\ngranting retrospective promotion. Therefore, the issue of\n\ngranting retrospective promotion, if such occasion arises, is\n\nno more res integra.\n\n110. But if the retrospective promotion is granted causing\n\nany adversity to other similarly situated persons, then such\n\nretrospective promotion cannot be said to be justified.\n\n111. Here, the situation is otherwise as because of grant of\n\nretrospective promotion to private respondents who have\n\nbeen promoted by virtue of the Rules, 1993 is causing\n\nadverse interest upon the inter se seniority of the direct\n\nrecruits, the writ petitioners herein, who have been appointed\n\nas per new Rules, 2012.\n\n- 68 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n112. At this juncture, the judgments rendered by this Court\n\nrendered in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra),\nSunil Kumar\n\nBhagat\n(supra) and\nNand Kishor Nayak\n(supra) are\n\nrequired to be referred herein, as much reliance have been\n\nplaced by the parties upon these judgments and even while\n\nframing the policy decision dated 26.08.2021, which is under\n\nchallenge also, the State has taken reference of judgment\n\nrendered in the case of\nNand Kishor Nayak\n(supra) and the\n\nlearned Single Judge while passing the judgment in\nNand\n\nKishor Nayak\n(supra) has put reliance upon the judgment\n\nrendered in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra), which has been\n\naffirmed up-to Hon‟ble Apex Court.\n\n113. Therefore, this Court first deems it fit and proper to\n\nagain go to the judgment rendered in the case of\nArun Sinha\n\n(supra), wherefrom it is evident that prayer has been made\n\nfor grant of Grade IV as they have also completed the\n\nrequisite/minimum period of 8/12 years in service.\n\nSubmission was made therein that since the petitioners were\n\nnot at fault in not acquiring training, therefore, the\n\npetitioners should be given grade IV scale.\n\n114. Learned counsel for the State on the other hand taken\n\nthe ground that it is true that on the basis of merit list and\n\nranking list of the petitioners, they were appointed against\n\nmatric trained pay-scale in accordance with different\n\n- 69 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\norders/directions of the State Government, and that as per\n\nthe said Circular dated 25.6.1999, the seniority is to be\n\ncounted from the date of appointment, but in view of\n\nparagraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993, petitioners are\n\nentitled for, grade 1 pay-scale from the date of passing\n\nTeachers Training Examination i.c. 3.5.2002.\n\n115. The learned Single judge taking note of the fact that\n\npetitioners were appointed in September/October 1994 under\n\nthe matric trained scale and were subsequently, sent for\n\ntraining in 1998, and the result was published only in 2002\n\non the intervention of the Court, therefore, the petitioners\n\nwere not at fault in not getting training. Therefore, it was held\n\nthat the petitioners' case should be considered for having\n\ntheir seniority from the date of their appointment. They\n\nshould also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV\n\nscales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.\n\nAccordingly, the petitioners were granted liberty to file\n\nindividual representations, on which, the Director, Human\n\nResources Development Department (Primary Education),\n\nGovernment of Jharkhand, Ranchi was directed to pass\n\nnecessary orders in terms of the order passed by writ Court.\n\n116. The order passed by writ Court in the case of\nArun\n\nSinha\n(supra) attained finality up-to Hon‟ble Supreme Court.\n\n- 70 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n117. From perusal of judgment passed in\nArun Sinha\n\n(supra), it is evident that learned Court has held that case of\n\nthe petitioners, who were appointed sometimes in the year\n\n1993-94, may be considered for having their seniority from\n\nthe date of their initial appointment and not from the date of\n\ncompletion of training, as it is the State because of which the\n\nteachers training of the petitioners could not be completed in\n\ntime and result of which was also published after much\n\ndelay. It was further directed to consider the case of the\n\npetitioners for giving benefit of. Grade-IV scales after\n\ncompletion of 8/12 years of their service.\n\n118. Similar prayer was made in batch of writ petitions\n\nleading case is\nSunil Kumar Bhagat\n(supra), wherein\n\nallegedly the petitioners were appointed in the year\n\n1987/1988/1994 or 1999-2000 and prayed for grant of\n\nGrade-I Scale and seniority from the date of their initial\n\njoining as Assistant Teachers in Elementary Schools within\n\nthe State relying upon the judgment rendered by this Court\n\nin the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs. State of\n\nJharkhand & others passed in W.P.S. No. 638 of 2006\n\ndated 04.04.2008 on the ground that delay in obtaining the\n\nTeachers' Training qualification was not on account of their\n\nfault.\n\n- 71 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n119. During pendency of the writ petition, the respondent-\n\nSecretary, Human Resources Development Department,\n\nGovernment of Jharkhand was also asked to take a call on\n\nthe necessity to issue general executive instructions/circulars\n\nto all the District authorities laying down clear-cut guidelines\n\nto deal with the matters, which are covered by the\nratio\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthe case of\nArun Sinha & others\n(Supra).\n\n120.\nIn terms thereof, the resolution bearing memo no. 3027\n\ndated 14.12.2015 containing the policy decision of the State\n\non the aforesaid issue in terms of the\nratio\nlaid down in\nthe\n\ncase of\nArun Sinha & others\n(Supra) was brought on\n\nrecord, wherein taking note of the fact that\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nthe case of\nArun Sinha & others\n(Supra) has been affirmed\n\nup-to the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, laid down guidelines,\n\nwherein it is decided that teachers appointed in the year\n\n1987 and 1988 shall be entitled to Grade I from the date of\n\ntheir initial appointment and inter se seniority shall be\n\ncounted from the date of their initial appointment. Further,\n\nthe teachers appointed in the year 1991, 1994, 1999-2000\n\nshall be entitled to Grade I from the date of their initial\n\nappointment and inter se seniority shall be counted from the\n\ndate of their initial appointment. It was further decided that\n\nthe inter se seniority amongst above category of teachers will\n\nbe decided on basis of the date of their initial appointment\n\n- 72 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nand further promotion shall be granted on the basis of\n\nPromotion Rules, 1993.\n\n121. In terms of the aforesaid circular/resolution, the writ\n\npetition was disposed of holding that the cases of individual\n\npetitioners who fall within the terms of the resolution dated\n\n14.12.2015 be considered by the respondents- District\n\nauthorities. The District Superintendent of Education of\n\nrespective districts would examine the individual cases as per\n\nthe procedure\nlaid down by\nplacing the matter before the\n\nDistrict Education Establishment Committee for taking an\n\ninformed decision in respect of individual claims in\n\naccordance with law and the aforesaid policy decision within\n\na reasonable time, preferably 16 weeks from the date of\n\nreceipt of copy of this order.\n\n122. There is no dispute about the aforesaid proposition of\n\nlaw\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra),\nSunil\n\nKumar Bhagat\n(supra) since no issue of adversity being\n\ncaused to the direct recruits was there, rather, the in the case\n\nof\nArun Sinha\n(supra) prayer was made to grant Grade IV as\n\nthey have also completed the requisite period 8/12 years in\n\nservice on the ground that petitioners were not at fault in not\n\nacquiring training. State had taken the ground that the\n\nseniority is to be counted from the date of appointment, but\n\nin view of paragraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993,\n\n- 73 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\npetitioners are entitled for Grade 1 pay-scale from the date of\n\npassing Teachers Training Examination i.c. 3.5.2002.\n\nHowever, the learned Single judge considering the fact that\n\nthe petitioners were not at fault in not getting training held\n\nthat the petitioners' case should be considered for having\n\ntheir seniority from the date of their appointment. They\n\nshould also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV\n\nscales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.\n\n123. Similar prayer was made in batch of writ petitions\n\nleading case is\nSunil Kumar Bhagat\n(supra), wherein the\n\npetitioners, who were appointed in the year 1987/1988/1994\n\nor 1999-2000, made prayed for grant of Grade-I Scale and\n\nseniority from the date of their initial joining as Assistant\n\nTeachers by relying upon the judgment rendered by this\n\nCourt in the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs.\n\nState of\n\nJharkhand & others\n(supra). During pendency of the case,\n\non the direction of the Court, resolution dated 14.12.2015\n\nwas brought on record by the State, wherein it has been\n\ndecided that teachers appointed in the year 1987 and 1988\n\nshall be entitled to Grade I from the date of their initial\n\nappointment and inter se seniority shall be counted from the\n\ndate of their initial appointment. In terms of the aforesaid\n\ncircular/resolution, the writ petition was disposed of.\n\n- 74 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n124. Admittedly, the day when the judgment was passed, in\n\nthe case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra) there was no existence of\n\nRules, 2012 carving out a provision for direct recruitment in\n\nGrade IV on the post of Graduate Trained Teacher.\n\n125. This Court, therefore, is of the view that the reliance\n\nwhich has been placed and taken note of by the learned\n\nSingle Judge in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra) stating that\n\nthe issue of retrospectivity has been dealt with in those cases,\n\nand on the principle laid down therein the private\n\nrespondents have been granted retrospective promotion, is\n\nnot acceptable and we are not in agreement with such stand\n\nreason being that either in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra) or\n\nin the case of\nSunil Kumar Bhagat\n(supra) there was no\n\nissue of adverse interest of the party concerned or the issue\n\nof adverse interest of direct recruits, as the case herein.\n\n126. But the authority concerned without taking note of\n\nthese facts granted promotion to private respondents vide\n\nmemo dated 28.12.2016 with retrospective effect from\n\n01.04.2015.\n\n127. It is settled position of law that the retrospective\n\npromotion without taking into consideration the predicament\n\nof the others is not permissible reason being that when a\n\nthird party interest is being jeopardized then the\n\n- 75 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ncircumspection is to be made so as not to infringe the right of\n\nothers.\n\n128. While granting retrospective promotion, the matter\n\nwould have different if the right of none of the parties is being\n\ninfringed, then the retrospective promotion can be granted.\n\n129. So far as the argument of emphasizing Rule 8 of the\n\nRules, 1993 is concerned the same has already been\nreferred\n\nabove\n, which deals with the inter se seniority in the same\n\nGrade, which speaks that date of getting the said grade shall\n\nbe the basis for determining the seniority. If the date of\n\ngetting the Grade is the same, then date of getting lower\n\nGrade shall be the basis and accordingly date of getting\n\nlowest grade, where-ever required, shall be the basis.\n\n130. It is evident therefrom that the Rule 8 of Rules, 1993\n\nonly speaks with respect of interest of the promotes of inter se\n\nseniority of same cadre and same is not related with the inter\n\nse seniority of „promotees‟ from I to Grade IV vis-à-vis direct\n\nrecruits under Grade IV appointed on the post of „Graduate\n\nTrained Teacher‟, since at the time when the Rules, 1993 was\n\nformulated, there was no concept of direct recruits on the\n\npost of Trained Graduate Teacher in Grade IV directly rather\n\nthe concept of direct appointment of Trained Graduate\n\nTeacher in Grade IV comes only after coming into effect of\n\nRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act\n,\n\n- 76 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n2009 in terms of which the Jharkhand Primary School\n\nTeacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was framed by the State of\n\nJharkhand for making direct recruitment on the post of\n\nGraduate Trained Teacher in Grade IV.\n\n131. Therefore, the contention which has been raised that\n\nwhatever submission has been made that in terms of Rule 8\n\nis having no bearing with respect to the present issue.\n\n132. Furthermore, the Rule 8 of Rules, 1993 cannot be read\n\nto be in isolation without taking into consideration the\n\ninterest of direct recruits, who have been appointed in terms\n\nof provisions of Rules, 2012.\n\n133. The issue of infirmity in Rules, 1993, in particular Rule\n\n8 is also not there and based upon that if the promotion has\n\nbeen granted is also not the issue but the concerned of this\n\nCourt is that while granting such promotion can it said to be\n\njustified action on the part of the State in depriving the right\n\nof the seniority of direct recruits, who admittedly have come\n\nin the Cadre prior to that of promotes, and by giving\n\nretrospective promotion the direct recruits [writ petitioners]\n\nhave been lowered down in seniority list which certainly\n\nhamper the future promotion of direct recruits.\n\n134. The law is also well settled with retrospective seniority\n\ncannot be granted to an employee from a date when the\n\nemployee was not borne on a cadre. Seniority amongst\n\n- 77 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nmembers of the same grade has to be counted from the date\n\nof initial entry into the grade, reference in this regard be\n\nmade to the judgment rendered in the case of\nGanga Vishan\n\nGujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n[(2019) 16\n\nSCC 28], wherein the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the background\n\nof the factual aspect has laid down following proposition of\n\nlaw, as under paragraph 45 which reads as under:\n\n45. A consistent line of precedent of this Court follows the\nprinciple that retrospective seniority cannot be granted to\nan employee from a date when the employee was not\nborne on a cadre. Seniority amongst members of the same\ngrade has to be counted from the date of initial entry into\nthe grade. This principle emerges from the decision of the\nConstitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II\nEngg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra [Direct\nRecruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of\nMaharashtra, (1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 339] .\nThe\nprinciple was reiterated by this Court in\nState of\nBihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath [State of Bihar\nv. Akhouri\nSachindra Nath, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S)\n1070] and State of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma [State\nof Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, (2007) 1 SCC 683 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] .\nIn\nPawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan\nSingh [Pawan Pratap Singh\nv. Reevan Singh, (2011) 3 SCC 267 :\n(2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 481] , this Court revisited the precedents on\nthe subject and observed : (SCC pp. 281-82, para 45)\n\"45. ... (i) The effective date of selection has to be understood in\nthe context of the Service Rules under which the appointment is\nmade. It may mean the date on which the process of selection\nstarts with the issuance of advertisement or the factum of\npreparation of the select list, as the case may be.\n\n(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be\ndetermined as per the Service Rules. The date of entry in\n\n- 78 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\na particular service or the date of substantive\nappointment is the safest criterion for fixing seniority\ninter se between one officer or the other or between one\ngroup of officers and the other recruited from different\nsources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory rules,\nexecutive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from\nthe backdate and if it is done, it must be based on\nobjective considerations and on a valid classification and\nmust be traceable to the statutory rules.\n\n(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of\noccurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given\nretrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the\nrelevant Service Rules. It is so because seniority cannot\nbe given on retrospective basis when an employee has not\neven been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may\nadversely affect the employees who have been appointed\nvalidly in the meantime.\"\n\nThis view has been re-affirmed by a Bench of three Judges of\nthis Court in\nP. Sudhakar Rao v. U. Govinda Rao [P. Sudhakar\nRao\nv. U. Govinda Rao, (2013) 8 SCC 693 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S)\n690] .\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n135. The Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of\nGanga Vishan\n\nGujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n(supra)\n\ntaking reference of the judgment rendered by Constitution\n\nBench of Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of Direct Recruit\n\nClass II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of\n\nMaharashtra [Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers'\n\nAssn. v. State of Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990\n\nSCC (L&S) 339], in which, it has been held that inter se\n\n- 79 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nseniority in a particular service has to be determined as per\n\nthe Service Rules. The date of entry in a particular service or\n\nthe date of substantive appointment is the safest criterion for\n\nfixing seniority inter se between one officer or the other or\n\nbetween one group of officers and the other recruited from\n\ndifferent sources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory\n\nrules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent\n\nwith the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution. Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be\n\ngranted from the backdate and if it is done, it must be based\n\non objective considerations and on a valid classification and\n\nmust be traceable to the statutory rules.\n\n136. The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of\n\noccurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given retrospectively\n\nunless it is so expressly provided by the relevant Service\n\nRules. It is so because seniority cannot be given on\n\nretrospective basis when an employee has not even been\n\nborne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely affect the\n\nemployees who have been appointed validly in the meantime.\n\n137. Further reference in this regard be made to the\n\njudgment rendered in the case of\nNani Sha & Ors. Vs. State\n\nof Arunachal Pradesh & Ors.\n[(2007) 15 SCC 406],\n\nwherein in the similar fact situation, the appellants were\n\npromoted from the post of Forest Rangers to Assistant\n\n- 80 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nConservator of Forests in the year 2002 in accordance with\n\nArunachal Pradesh Forest Service Rules, but they were given\n\nseniority retrospectively from 1994 which made them senior\n\nto direct recruits who had been appointed in the year 1996.\n\nLegal issue involved was whether the Rules prescribed any\n\nquota for promotees, under which the promotees should get\n\nretrospective seniority according to their quota. Rule 5(α)\n\nprovided that 50% of substantive \"vacancies\" which occur\n\nfrom time to time in the authorised permanent strength of the\n\nservice shall be filled by direct recruitment. Similarly, Rule\n\n5(b) provided that the remaining substantive \"vacancies\"\n\nshould be filled by promotion. Besides, Rule 25(c) provided\n\nthat \"... relative seniority of direct recruits and of promotees\n\nshall be determined according to rotation of vacancies\n\nbetween direct recruits and promotees which shall be based\n\non the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct recruitment\n\nand promotion under Rule 5.\n\n138. From the above provision, the High Court inferred that\n\nthere was no quota between the promotes and direct recruits\n\nin the un-amended Rule 5. The High Court therefore held\n\nthat promotes who were promoted in 2002, could not be\n\ngiven seniority retrospectively from 1994 when they were still\n\nworking on the feeder post of Forest Ranger. Aggrieved\n\nthereof, the appellant moved the Supreme Court. The Hon‟ble\n\n- 81 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nSupreme Court held that the High Court was right in holding\n\nthat promote appellants could not be given seniority from the\n\ndate they were not even borne in the cadre. The appellants\n\nwere working under the direct recruits right from 1996 till\n\n2002. It would therefore, be unfair to allow appellants to steal\n\na march over direct appointees under whom they worked\n\npractically for eight years. There is no justification in\n\nupsetting the whole balance at this point of time.\n\n139. For ready reference, the relevant paragraphs of the\n\njudgment is quoted as under:\n\n3. The appeal has been filed by five appellants challenging\nthe judgment of the Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court\nwhereby the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High\nCourt was confirmed. The learned Single Judge had allowed\nthe writ petition filed by the respondents herein. In the writ\npetition the respondents herein, who are the directly\nappointed Assistant Conservator of Forests (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"ACF\", for short) had challenged an Order\npassed by the State of Arunachal Pradesh dated 8-6-2004\nvide No. FOR 376/E(A)/2001/4901-61 granting retrospective\neffect promotions to the appellants herein with effect from 2-\n\n11-1994. With that retrospective effect Respondents 3 to 7\nherein became junior to the appellants since they were all\nappointed in the year 1996 after direct examination to the\npost of ACF. The learned Judge found that giving such\nretrospective effect would be illegal and on the date\nconcerned they were not even borne on the cadre of ACF\nand were only serving as Range Forest Officer. He also\nfound that in the unamended Rule 5 which provided for\nmethod of recruitment, there was no 50:50 quota for the direct\nrecruits and the promotees, which quota came to be\nintroduced only by way of an amendment effected to the\n\n- 82 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nArunachal Pradesh Forest Rules vide Notification No.\nFOR.391/E-A/90/32343 dated 24-9-1999 and as such even\nif the respondents herein were given more than 50% posts in\nthe cadre of ACF, it was permissible and as such the\npromotions made of the appellants herein for the first time in\nthe year 2001 could not be dated back by giving retrospective\neffect from the year 1994.\n\n4. In order to understand the controversy some facts would\nbe necessary. All the present appellants herein started their\ncareer in the post of Forest Rangers and after their training in\nthe Forest Rangers College, Kurseong, they were appointed\nas Forest Rangers with effect from 7-7-1984. The post of\nForest Rangers is the feeder post for the post of ACF. There\nare service rules for governing the service conditions called\nthe Arunachal Pradesh Forest Service Rules. These Rules\nprovide, inter alia, that a Forest Ranger would have to put in\nfive years of service before being promoted to the post of ACF.\nIn that way the appellants herein had become entitled for\nbeing considered for promotion by 1989. They were, however,\nnot promoted in the year 1989 and were in fact promoted on\n10-6-2002. However, in the meantime the respondents herein\nwere selected after the competitive examination and were\nappointed in the year 1996. Naturally, the respondents herein\nwere senior to the appellants in the cadre of ACF. The\nGovernment on account of the representations made\nconstituted another Departmental Promotion Committee\n(hereinafter referred to as \"DPC\", for short) and the present\nappellants were awarded the notional promotion with\nretrospective effect i.e. from December 1994. This Order was\npassed on 20-5-2004. Because of this Order all the\nappellants would become senior to all the directly appointed\nrespondents and for this precise reason the said Order came\nto be challenged before the Gauhati High Court which\nchallenge was accepted by the learned Single Judge and the\njudgment of the learned Single Judge was confirmed by the\nDivision Bench which has necessitated the present appellants\nto come before us.\n\n- 83 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n13. Reverting back to the effect of the proviso, we do not find\nanywhere any such intention to apply the proviso with\nretrospective effect. In order to make a provision\napplicable with retrospective effect, it has to be\nspecifically expressed in the provision. We do not find\nsuch an expression in the said proviso. Nothing had\nstopped the Government before amending the Rule to\nword it specifically, making it retrospective. That was\nnot done and we are not prepared to hold that the Rule\nis retrospective. Secondly, we cannot countenance the\nargument that the Rule has a clarificatory nature. The Rule,\nfor the first time, creates a quota and thus crystallises the\nrights of the direct appointees and the promotees which was\nnot there earlier. It, therefore, cannot be viewed as a\nclarificatory amendment. Again whether the amendment is\nclarificatory or not would depend upon the language of the\nprovision as also the other Rules. We have examined the\nRules which did not suggest that there was any quota\nexisting as such. On the other hand we see Rule 25 which is\na Rule regarding seniority and more particularly Rule 25(c). It\nis apparent from the language of the Rule that the\nGovernment thought otherwise. Rule 25(c) is as under:\n\n\"25. (c) The relative seniority of direct recruits and of\npromotees shall be determined according to the rotation of\nvacancies between direct recruits and promotees which shall\nbe based on the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct\nrecruitment and promotion under Rule 5.\"\n\nThis language suggests that the only quota that was\ncontemplated was as per Rule 5 which we have already\nexplained in the earlier part of the judgment which suggests\nthe 50% quota only in the \"substantive vacancies which\noccurred from time to time\" and not the whole vacancies in\nthe cadre. We are, therefore, unable to accept the argument of\nthe learned counsel for the appellants.\n\n14. Therefore, one thing is certain that the appellants did not\nhave right to claim a retrospective seniority, particularly over\n\n- 84 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nand above the respondents who had been working in the post\nof ACF right from July 1996.\n\n15. This Court in a reported judgment in\nState of\nUttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 683 :\n\n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] has clearly held that the seniority is\nto be reckoned not from the day when the vacancy arose but\nfrom the date on which the appointment is made to the post.\n\nThere this Court was interpreting Rules 17 and 21 of the U.P.\nAgriculture Group B Service Rules, 1995 and Rule 8 of the\nU.P. Government Servants' Seniority Rules, 1991. This Court\ndisapproved the stance taken by the High Court that the\ndirections should have been given not from the date of\nappointment but with retrospective effect when the vacancy\narose. The following observations in para 34 are speaking\nand would close the issue: (SCC pp. 691-92)\n\"34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether the\nyear in which the vacancy accrues can have any relevance\nfor the purpose of determining the seniority irrespective of the\nfact when the persons are recruited. Here the respondent's\ncontention is that since the vacancy arose in 1995-1996 he\nshould be given promotion and seniority from that year and\nnot from 1999, when his actual appointment letter was\nissued by the appellant. This cannot be allowed as no\nretrospective effect can be given to the order of appointment\norder under the Rules nor is such contention reasonable to\nnormal parlance. This was the view taken by this Court\nin\nJagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of Orissa\n[(1998) 4 SCC 456 :\n\n1998 SCC (L&S) 1156] .\"\n\n16. Lastly, the High Court has specifically rejected the claim\nof the appellants on another ground, namely, that the\nappellants were not borne in the cadre of ACF on the date\nfrom which they have been given the seniority. We are in\ncomplete agreement with the High Court, particularly in view\nof the decision of this Court in\nState of Bihar v. Akhouri\nSachindra Nath\n[1991 Supp (1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S)\n1070 : (1991) 16 ATC 936] which decision was reiterated\nin\nState of Bihar v. Bateshwar Sharma\n[(1997) 4 SCC 424 :\n\n- 85 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n1997 SCC (L&S) 975] . We do not want to burden this\njudgment with further reported decisions. However, the same\nview has been taken in another reported decision of this\nCourt in\nUttaranchal Forest Rangers' Assn. (Direct\nRecruit) v. State of U.P.\n[(2006) 10 SCC 346 : (2007) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 116 : JT (2006) 12 SC 513] where in para 18 this Court\nhas taken a view that no retrospective promotion or\nseniority can be granted from a date when an employee\nhas not even been borne in the cadre so as to be\nadversely affecting those who were appointed validly in\nthe meantime.\n\n17. There is still one another reason for our concurring with\nthe High Court's judgments. There cannot be any dispute that\nall through right from 1996 when the respondents were\nappointed till 2002, the appellants were working under them\nin capacity of the Range Forest Officers; the appellants came\nin those posts and started exercising the powers and duties\nof the post of ACF only from 2002. It would be, therefore,\nvery unfair to allow the appellants to steal a march\nover the direct appointees under whom they worked\npractically for eight years. On this ground we concur with\nthe High Court that at this point of time there would be no\njustification in upsetting the whole balance.\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n140.\nIn the case of\nSk. Abdul Rashid & Ors. Vs. State of\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n[(2008) 1 SCC 722], the Hon‟ble Apex\n\nCourt taking note of catena of judgments passed by Hon‟ble\n\nApex Court held that retrospective promotion in this case\n\nhaving effect of conferring higher seniority on private\n\nrespondents vis-à-vis appellants, such retrospective\n\npromotion was against the statutory rules, therefore, set\n\naside the impugned judgment.\n\n- 86 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\n\n141. For ready reference, the relevant paragraphs of the\n\njudgment is quoted as under:\n\n16.\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath\n[1991 Supp\n(1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 1070 : (1991) 16 ATC 936] this\nCourt held : (SCC p. 342, para 12)\n\"12. ... It is well settled that no person can be promoted\nwith retrospective effect from a date when he was not\nborn in the cadre so as to adversely affect others. It is\nwell settled by several decisions of this Court that amongst\nmembers of the same grade seniority is reckoned from the\ndate of their initial entry into the service.\n\n17.\nIn\nKaushal Kishore Singh v. Dy. Director of\nEducation\n[(2002) 9 SCC 634 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 1090] this Court\nstated the law, thus : (SCC p. 635, para 5)\n\"5. The claim of seniority of the employee is always\ndetermined in any particular grade or cadre and it is not the\nlaw that seniority in one grade or cadre would be dependent\non the seniority in another grade or cadre.\"\n\n18.\nIn\nState of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar\nSharma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 683 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] it was\nopined : (SCC pp. 691-92, para 34)\n\"34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether\nthe year in which the vacancy accrues can have any\nrelevance for the purpose of determining the seniority\nirrespective of the fact when the persons are recruited. Here\nthe respondent's contention is that since the vacancy arose\nin 1995-1996 he should be given promotion and seniority\nfrom that year and not from 1999, when his actual\nappointment letter was issued by the appellant. This cannot\nbe allowed as no retrospective effect can be given to the\nappointment order under the Rules nor is such contention\nreasonable to normal parlance.\n\nThis was the view taken by\nthis Court in\nJagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of Orissa\n[(1998) 4\nSCC 456 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1156] .\"\n\n19. Similarly, although the statute provides for grant of\nofficiating promotion, but the same is not conducive in the sense\n\n- 87 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nthat even after getting officiating promotion, one may be reverted\nto the original post held by him. We do not mean to say that the\nseniority would be reckoned from the date of confirmation but we\nonly intend to point out that the Rules having been provided for\nofficiating promotion, the learned Single Judge was correct in\ntaking that factor also into consideration for the purpose of\ndetermining the validity of the impugned order before the High\nCourt. The said order dated 3-12-1985 even otherwise appears\nto be mala fide having been passed for unauthorised purpose. If\nthe said order dated 3-12-1985 is read with the earlier one being\ndated 1-8-1985, the intention of the Government to favour the\nprivate respondents herein becomes explicit. It is not expected of\na Government to brazenly favour one set of employees so as to\ndefeat the bona fide claim of the other set of employees. We,\ntherefore, are of the opinion, that the impugned judgment cannot\nbe sustained which is set aside accordingly. The appeals are\nallowed.\n\n142. It is, thus, evident by going through the aforesaid\n\njudgment that retrospective promotion is permissible but if\n\nthe same is causing adverse impact upon the others, the\n\nsame is not permissible and further the retrospective\n\npromotion cannot be granted from the date when the\n\nconcerned employee has not taken birth in the cadre.\n\n143. Adverting to the factual aspect of the present case, it is\n\nadmitted case of the private respondents that they have been\n\npromoted vide issuance of notification dated 28.12.2016 with\n\nretrospective effect from 01.04.2015 but in the meanwhile,\n\nthe writ petitioners-appellants have been appointed through\n\ndirect mode in pursuance to the advertisement floated under\n\nthe Rules, 2012. They have been inducted in the cadre\n\n- 88 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nthrough direct mode of recruitment w.e.f. December, 2015\n\nand January, 2016 but by granting retrospective promotion\n\nw.e.f. 01.04.2015, the private respondents have been made\n\nsenior to that of direct recruits; meaning thereby they have\n\nbeen inducted in service the day when the private\n\nrespondents did not born in the cadre.\n\n144. Therefore, the law\nlaid down by\nHon‟ble Apex Court in\n\nthe judgment rendered hereinabove in the case of\nGanga\n\nVishan Gujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n\n(supra); Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers'\n\nAssn. v. State of Maharashtra [Direct Recruit Class II\n\nEngg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra (supra);\n\nNani Sha & Ors. Vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh &\n\nOrs.\n(supra) and Sk. Abdul Rashid & Ors. Vs. State of\n\nJammu & Kashmir (supra), the retrospective promotion\n\ngranted in favour of the private respondents vide order dated\n\n28.12.2016 w.e.f. 01.04.2015 causing adverse impact upon\n\nthe direct recruits cannot be said to be justified and requires\n\ninterference by this Court.\n\n145. The writ petitioners have also challenged the policy\n\ndecision as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated\n\n26.08.2021 issued by Joint Secretary to the Government,\n\nSchool Education and Literacy Department, Govt. of\n\nJharkhand, whereby a decision has been taken for giving\n\n- 89 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\npromotion to the teachers, who are working in Grade-3, 4\n\nand 7, on notional basis and further decision has been taken\n\nto grant promotion with retrospective effect from the date of\n\navailability of vacancy.\n\n146. The said policy decision has been taken by the State on\n\nthe strength of direction passed by learned writ Court in\n\nW.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors\n] disposed of vide order dated 26.09.2018,\n\nwherein prayer has been made for direction upon the\n\nrespondents-State to pay them monetary benefits upon grant\n\nof Grade-I from the date of appointment and further grade-II,\n\nas per the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in\n\nW.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the State of\n\nJharkhand & ors.). The learned Single Judge after hearing\n\nthe parties directed the State to take a uniform decision for\n\nextending the actual benefits of promotion to the petitioners.\n\n147. For ready reference, the relevant portion of order passed\n\nin\nNand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors\n\n(supra) is quoted as under:\n\n\"The petitioners have approached this Hon'ble\nCourt with a prayer for direction upon the respondents\nto pay them monetary benefits upon grant of Grade-I\nfrom the date of appointment and further grade-II, as\nper the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in\nW.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the State\nof Jharkhand & ors.) which has been affirmed in\nL.P.A.No.214 of 2008 and analogous cases and also up to\n\n- 90 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court and in compliance of said\njudgment, the circular of the Govt. 2 vide memo No.3027\ndated 14.12.2015 issued by the Directorate of School\nEducation & Literacy, Govt. of Jharkhand, as the promotion\nin Grade II has already been granted vide Memo No.1683\ndated 15.05.2017.\n\n2. The factual exposition as has been delineated in the writ\npetition is that the petitioners are working as Assistant\nTeachers in the district of Bokaro and they have joined their\nrespective posts on the different dates in 1994 & 1999 but\nthey have been denied the monetary benefits and even the\nnotional benefits, though they were entitled for the same in\nview of resolution of the State Govt. dated 14.12.2015. The\nissue regarding grant of monetary benefits to the\ntrained/untrained teachers fell for consideration before this\nHon'ble Court in W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 and this Hon'ble\nCourt vide its order dated 04.04.2008 had observed that in\nview of earlier decisions of this Hon'ble Court in other cases\nparticularly, in W.P.(S)No.6264 of 2005 (\nJharkhand Police\nAssociation Vs. State of Jharkhand\n), the matric\ntrained/untrained teachers are also entitled for Grade-I scale\nfrom the date of their initial appointment. The order passed\nin W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 was affirmed by the Hon'ble\nDivision Bench of this Court in LPA No.214 of 2008 and the\nsame was also affirmed upto the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP\nNo.5520- 5522 of 2013. In view of the fact that the order\npassed in W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 was affirmed upto the\nHon'ble Apex Court, the State of Jharkhand came-out with a\nresolution dated 14.12.2015, issued under the pen and\nsignature of the Secretary, School Education & Literacy\nDepartment, Govt. of Jharkhand granting therein the matric\ntrained scale to the teachers from date of their initial\nappointment in case of their promotion to Grade-I and II.\nThough the issue is set at rest and it is no more res-integra,\nthe same was not implemented by the State Govt. in true\nletter and spirit. Though the petitioners were granted Grade-I\nand II from the date of their initial appointment but they were\n\n- 91 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ndenied the monetary benefits, which is dehors the rules.\nAggrieved by the same, the petitioners represented before\nthe respondent No.4 but no orders have been passed till date\nand as such, petitioners have been constrained to knock the\ndoor of this Hon'ble Court.\n\n3. Mr. Amit Kumar Tiwari, learned Counsel appearing for\nthe petitioners strenuously urges that issue involved in this\ncase is no more resintegra and the same is set at rest by the\nHon'ble Apex Court. In view of the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court, the State has also come out with a resolution\ndated 14.12.2015 but the same has not been implemented in\ntrue letter and spirit and as such, a direction be given to the\nrespondents, particularly, respondent No.3 to implement its\nown resolution dated 14.12.2015, in view of which\npetitioners are entitled for notional benefits 3 from the date of\ntheir initial appointment and monetary benefits from\n15.11.2000 as they have already been placed in Grade-I\nscale from the date of appointment.\n\n4. Though no counter-affidavit has been filed. However, Mr.\nSumir Prasad, S.C. I very fairly submits that the State is fully\naware that issue is no more res-integra and the matter has\nbeen set at rest by the Hon'ble Apex Court and in view of\nthat, State has come-out with a resolution for granting\nmonetary benefits/notional benefits to the matric trained\nteachers from the date of their initial appointment but\nbecause of some unavoidable reasons, the same could not be\nimplemented and several representations are pending before\nthe respondents and as such, a decision is going to be taken\nin this regard taking into consideration the direction of the\nHon'ble Apex Court as well as their own resolution dated\n14.12.2015.\n\n5.Be that as it may, having gone through the submissions of\nthe parties and after perusing the relevant records, this\nCourt is of the view that issue regarding giving benefits of\nGrade-I pay scale fell for consideration before this Hon'ble\nCourt and the Hon'ble Court had observed that teachers are\n\n- 92 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nentitled for benefits from the date of their initial appointment\nand the same was affirmed upto the Hon'ble Apex Court and\nhence, the issue is no more res-integra. The State Govt. has\nalso come-out with a resolution No.3027 dated 14.12.2015\nfor implementing the same regarding grant of benefits from\nthe date of initial appointment but unfortunately, the same is\nnot implemented so far. The teachers are suffering as they\nare not getting their benefits though the issue has been set at\nrest by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Thereafter, several writ\npetitions have been filed for the same relief and several\norders have been passed by the Hon'ble Court for granting\nthe benefits of Grade-I from the date of initial appointment.\n\nA very fair submission has been made by the learned\nCounsel that if the petitioners are not entitled for monetary\nbenefits from the date of their initial appointment, they are at\nleast entitled for notional benefits from the date of their initial\nappointment and monetary benefits from 15.11.2000, as\ncontained in para-15(iv) of the resolution dated 14.12.2015\nand also in view of settled principles of law. This submission\nof learned Counsel is appreciated by this Court.\n\nAs such, respondent No.4 is directed to take a\nuniform decision in case of teachers for granting the\nbenefits of Grade-I Scale keeping into account the\ndecision of this Hon'ble Court in case of \"\nArun Sinha &\nOrs. vs. the State of Jharkhand & Ors.\n, passed in\nW.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 which was affirmed upto the\nHon'ble Apex Court and in view of the fact 4 that State has\nalready come-out with a resolution No.3027 dated\n14.12.2015. Needless to say that if the petitioners are\ngranted promotion and thus entitled for monetary benefits\nalso and accordingly are entitled for the benefits as prayed\nfor, in view of decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court and in view\nof resolution dated 14.12.2015.\n\n6. It was brought to the notice of the Court that in view\nof several orders passed by this Court taking into\nconsideration the orders passed by the Division Bench\n\n- 93 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nas well as Supreme Court, the State of Jharkhand has\ngiven actual monetary benefits to Assistant Teachers\nof all the districts of the State of Jharkhand save and\nexcept Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dumka and Chaibasa. The\ninstant case relates to Bokaro. Earlier also the order was\npassed by this Court in W.P.(S)No.2128/2018 relating to\nJamshedpur i.e. East Singhbhum.\n\n7. It appears that respondents have adopted method of\npick and choose. The Assistant Teachers of\nJamshedpur, Bokaro, Dumka and Chaibasa have been\ndiscriminated whereas the ratio of the Supreme Court\napplies in each and every case. If the teachers have been\nconsidered for granting promotion and have been granted,\nthey are very much entitled for the monetary benefits also as\nper the settled proposition of law as it has been held in the\ncase of \"\nDr. Paras Nath Singh Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n1990(2) PLJR 248;\nMd. Hafiz vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n2003 (2) PLJR 44;\nSuryadeo Prasad vs. the State of\nJharkhand\n, reported in 2010 (3) JCR 238 and in case of\nW.P.(S) No.1932 of 2005 (\nRajeshwar Prasad Vs. the State of\nJharkhand\n) wherein this Court has held that promotion\nshould be granted with all consequential benefits from the\ndate it fallen due and as such, the respondents cannot be\nallowed to proceed against the orders passed by the Hon'ble\nCourts. Time and again it has been held that seniority will be\ncounted from the date of initial appointment. The Assistant\nTeachers are entitled for monetary benefits from the date of\npromotion though a decision has been taken by the\nrespondent-State that Assistant Teachers are not entitled for\nmonetary benefits prior to the State of Jharkhand came into\nexistence but admittedly they are entitled for monetary\nbenefits from the date the State of Jharkhand came into\nexistence or from the date a decision to that effect was taken\nby the State i.e. 05.07.2002. Surprisingly the benefits\nhave been extended to all the teachers except the\nteachers of Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dumka and\nChaibasa. The stand of the respondent is\n\n- 94 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ndiscriminatory and in complete violation of\nArticle 14\n,\nI hereby direct the respondents, particularly,\nrespondent No.1 to take a uniform decision for\nextending the actual benefits of promotion to the 5\npetitioners within a period of 12 weeks from the date\nof receipt of a copy of this order.\n\nLet a copy of this order be circulated to the\ndepartmental heads of all the districts of Jharkhand.\n\nThe Secretary of the Education Department is directed\nto circulate the order to all concerned authorities, who are\nresponsible for making payment. The entire exercise of such\ncirculation of order shall be completed within a period of 4\nweeks. 8. Accordingly, the writ petition stands disposed of.\"\n\n148. It is evident from\nthe said judgment\nthat neither there\n\nwas prayer for grant of Grade IV promotion with retrospective\n\npromotion nor there was consideration of Rules, 2012 though\n\nthe decision has been taken by the State much after framing\n\nof Rules, 2012 and appointment of direct recruits in the year\n\nDecember, 2015. The State in the said policy decision as\n\ncontained in order dated 26.08.2021 also did not taken care\n\nof inter se seniority of direct recruits on the post of Trained\n\nGraduate Teachers in Grade IV vis-à-vis promotes from Grade\n\nI onwards.\n\n149. Therefore, since in\nthe said judgment\nthere is no issue\n\nof granting Grade IV promotion taking into consideration inter\n\nse seniority between „direct recruits appointed as per Rule\n\n2012‟ and promotes appointed as per Rules, 1991, as in the\n\ninstant case, but the State based upon the finding so given in\n\n- 95 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nW.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of\n\nJharkhand & Ors], the impugned order/decision of the state\n\nas contained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021 cannot be\n\nsaid to be justified.\n\n150. Though, generally policy decision is not to be interfered\n\nwith by the High Court in exercise of power of judicial review\n\nbut it is also settled that that if the policy decision suffers\n\nfrom error or irrational then it is to be interfered with.\n\n151. This Court, in order to examine the aforesaid\n\nargument/ground, first deems it fit and proper to refer the\n\nposition of law regarding the power of judicial review to be\n\nexercised in the matter of policy decision taken by the State.\n\n152. This Court is aware of the settled law that the policy\n\ndecision of the State are not to be disturbed unless they are\n\nfound to be grossly arbitrary or irrational.\nIn this context,\n\nreference may be made to the judgment rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in\nFederation of Railway Officers\n\nAssociation and Ors. vs. Union of India\n, (2003) 4 SCC\n\n289 wherein at paragraph-12, it has been held as follows:\n\n\"12. In examining a question of this nature where a policy is\nevolved by the Government judicial review thereof is limited.\nWhen policy according to which or the purpose for which\ndiscretion is to be exercised is clearly expressed in the\nstatute, it cannot be said to be an unrestricted discretion. On\nmatters affecting policy and requiring technical expertise the\ncourt would leave the matter for decision of those who are\nqualified to address the issues. Unless the policy or action is\n\n- 96 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ninconsistent with the Constitution and the laws or arbitrary\nor irrational or abuse of power, the court will not interfere with\nsuch matters.\"\n\n153. Reference may also be made to the judgment rendered\n\nin\nDirectorate of Film Festivals and Ors. vs. Gaurav\n\nAshwin Jain and Ors.\n, (2007) 4 SCC 737, wherein the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to hold as under\n\nparagraph-16 which reads as under:\n\n\"16. The scope of judicial review of governmental policy is\nnow well defined. Courts do not and cannot act as Appellate\nAuthorities examining the correctness, suitability and\nappropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the\nexecutive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled\nto formulate. The scope of judicial review when examining a\npolicy of the Government is to check whether it violates the\nfundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the\nprovisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory\nprovision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere\nwith policy either on the ground that it is erroneous or on the\nground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is available.\nLegality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of\nthe policy, is the subject of judicial review.\"\n\n154. Further, in\nUgar Sugar Works Ltd. Vs. Delhi\n\nAdministration and Ors.\n, (2001) 3 SCC 635, the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court has been pleased to hold that \"The challenge,\n\nthus, in effect, is to the executive policy regulating trade in\n\nliquor in Delhi. It is well settled that the courts, in exercise of\n\ntheir power of judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with\n\nthe policy decisions of the executive unless the policy can be\n\nfaulted on grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness,\n\n- 97 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\narbitrariness or unfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness,\n\nirrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the policy\n\nunconstitutional. However, if the policy 11 L.P.A. No. 86 of\n\n2018 cannot be faulted on any of these grounds, the mere fact\n\nthat it would hurt business interests of a party, does not justify\n\ninvalidating the policy. In tax and economic regulation cases,\n\nthere are good reasons for judicial restraint\".\n\n155.\nIn\nParisons Agrotech Private Limited and Anr. Vs.\n\nUnion of India and Ors.\n, (2015) 9 SCC 657, the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court has observed as under paragraph-14 which reads\n\nas under:\n\n\"14. No doubt, the writ court has adequate power of judicial\nreview in respect of such decisions. However, once it is found\nthat there is sufficient material for taking a particular policy\ndecision, bringing it within the four corners of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution, power of judicial review would not extend to\ndetermine the correctness of such a policy decision or to indulge\ninto the exercise of finding out whether there could be more\nappropriate or better alternatives. Once we find that parameters\nof\nArticle 14\nare satisfied; there was due application of mind in\narriving at the decision which is backed by cogent material; the\ndecision is not arbitrary or irrational and; it is taken in public\ninterest, the Court has to respect such a decision of the executive\nas the policy making is the domain of the executive and the\ndecision in question has passed the test of the judicial review.\"\n\n156.\nIn\nJacob Puliyel vs Union of India and Others\nSCC OnLine SC 533 wherein at paragraphs-21 & 23, it has\n\nbeen observed which reads as under:\n\n\"21. ... It is well settled that the Courts, in exercise of their power\nof judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with the policy\n\n- 98 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ndecisions of the executive unless the policy can be faulted\non grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or\nunfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness, irrationality,\nperversity and mala fide will render the policy\nunconstitutional. It is neither within the domain of the courts\nnor the scope of judicial review to embark upon an enquiry\nas to whether a particular public policy is wise or whether\nbetter public policy can be evolved. Nor are the courts\ninclined to strike down a policy at the behest of a petitioner\nmerely because it has been urged that a different policy\nwould have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or more\nlogical. Courts do not and cannot act as appellate\nauthorities examining the correctness, suitability and\nappropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the\nexecutive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled\nto formulate. The scope of judicial review when examining a\npolicy of the Government is to check whether it violates the\nfundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the\nprovisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory\nprovision or manifestly arbitrary. 23. There is no doubt that\nthis Court has held in more than one judgment that where\nthe decision of the authority is in regard to a policy matter,\nthis Court will not ordinarily interfere since decisions on\npolicy matters are taken based on expert knowledge of the\npersons concerned and courts are normally not equipped to\nquestion the correctness of a policy decision. However, this\ndoes not mean that courts have to abdicate their right to\nscrutinize whether the policy in question is formulated\nkeeping in mind all the relevant facts and the said policy\ncan be held to be beyond the pale of discrimination or\nunreasonableness, bearing in mind the material on record.\n\nIn\nDelhi Development Authority\n(supra), this Court held that\nan executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond\nthe pale of judicial review. Whereas the superior courts may\nnot interfere with the nitty-gritty of the policy, or substitute\none by the other but it will not be correct to contend that the\n\n- 99 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\ncourt shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is raised\nthat the impugned decision is a policy decision. Interference\ntherewith on the part of the superior court would not be\nwithout jurisdiction as it is subject to judicial review. It was\nfurther held therein that the policy decision is subject to\njudicial review on the following grounds:\n\na) if it is unconstitutional;\n\nb) if it is dehors the provisions of the Act and the\nregulations; c) if the delegatee has acted beyond its power\nof delegation;\n\nd) if the executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a\nlarger policy.\n\n157. Further, in\nUnion of India and Others vs. Bharat\n\nForge Ltd. and Another\n, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1018, the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court at paragraph-20 has observed as under:\n\n\"20. This Court also laid down paragraph 46 as follows:\n\n\"46.\nIn\nCensus Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy [Census\nCommr.\nv. R. Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 ], a three-\nJudge Bench of this Court, after noting several decisions,\nheld that (SCC p. 809, para 33) it is not within the domain\nof the courts to embark upon an enquiry as to whether a\nparticular public policy is wise and acceptable or whether a\nbetter policy could be evolved and the courts can only\ninterfere if the policy framed is absolutely capricious or not\ninformed by reasons or totally arbitrary and founded on\nipse dixit offending the basic requirement of\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution. It further observed that in certain matters,\nas often said, there can be opinions but the court is not\nexpected to sit as an appellate authority on an opinion.\"\n\n158. Thus, it is evident that the interference by way of\n\nexercise of power under judicial review is only to the extent if\n\n- 100 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nit has been found that the action of the State is arbitrary and\n\nsuffers from the vice or malice.\n\n159. It is evident from the aforesaid judgment that the scope\n\nof judicial review in the matter of showing interference with\n\nthe policy decision is in a case where the decision is arbitrary\n\nand suffers from the vice of malice and is in the teeth of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n160. This Court in the light of the aforesaid proposition and\n\ndiscussions made hereinabove, is of the view since in the\n\npolicy decision there was non-consideration of the inter se\n\nseniority of direct recruits, who were appointed under Rules,\n\n2012 in the year December, 2015 vis-à-vis private\n\nrespondents, who were appointed in the year 1993-94, rather\n\nwas only consideration of the teachers appointed in the year\n\n1987, 1988, 1999-2000 in Matric Trained Scale, as would\n\nappear from paragraph 1 of the policy decision dated\n\n26.08.2021, the said policy decision cannot be said to be just\n\nand proper causing adverse impact upon the direct recruits.\n\n161. This Court has failed to understand that though the\n\nsaid policy decision was taken in the year 2021 and the\n\nrecruitment rule was made in the year 2012, based upon\n\nwhich appointment was made in December, 2015 on the post\n\nof Trained Graduate Teacher in Grade IV which the State did\n\nnot take care regarding policy decision for fixing the inter-se\n\n- 101 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nseniority between the private respondents [promotes] and the\n\nwrit petitioners [direct recruits].\n\n162. Therefore, this Court is of the view that while making\n\nout a policy decision the authority ought to have taken into\n\nconsideration the fact the direct recruits have been inducted\n\nin service on the basis of the Rules, 2012.\n\n163. But, it is evident from the consideration so made in the\n\nsaid policy decision that there is no consideration of the\n\ndirect recruits, who have been appointed in the year\n\nDecember, 2015 and January, 2016, and have been inducted\n\nin service in terms of Rules, 2012 and it appears that as if\n\nsaid policy decision has been prepared on the basis of\n\nconception that there is no rule for making entry through\n\ndirect recruitment by way of Rules, 2012.\n\n164. The moment the State has come out with a rule in the\n\nyear 2012 to make direct recruitment under proviso to\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India, then it is the bounden duty\n\nof the State authority to make a balance in between the direct\n\nrecruits and the promotes.\n\n165. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the said policy\n\ndecision for grant of retrospective promotion is contrary to\n\nthe law down by the Hon‟ble Apex Court on the pretext of the\n\nfact that retrospective promotion granted in the context of the\n\npresent case causing impediment to the future prospect by\n\n- 102 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nputting the promotes above the direct recruits even though\n\nthey did not take birth, the day when the direct recruits\n\nentered into service, as such it cannot be said to be just and\n\nproper and is not sustainable in the eye of law.\n\n166. This Court, after having discussed the aforesaid fact and\n\ncoming to the order passed by the learned Single Judge,\n\nwherefrom it is evident that the learned Single Judge has not\n\nappreciated the factual aspect in right prospective by taking\n\ninto consideration the factual aspect of the judgment\n\nrendered in the case of\nArun Sinha\n(supra) or\nSunil Kumar\n\nBhagat\n(supra) was passed by this Court.\n\n167. The learned Single Judge has also not taken into\n\nconsideration the factual aspect and the propriety of the\n\npolicy decision, as has been discussed in the preceding\n\nparagraphs.\n\n168. The learned Single Judge has further not appreciated\n\nthat merely the date of entry the consideration has been given\n\nfor promotion with retrospective effect which is only on the\n\ncompassion since the learned Single Judge has used the\n\nword that „merely because the appointment of teachers in the\n\nyear 2015 onwards, the case of those who were already in\n\nservice right from 1994 onwards cannot be allowed to suffer.‟\n\n169. The law is well settled that the issue of seniority cannot\n\nbe adjudged on the basis of compassion rather it is based\n\n- 103 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nupon the settled position of law, as per the discussion made\n\nhereinabove.\n\n170. This Court, in view of the entirety of facts and\n\ndiscussions made hereinabove, is of the view that the order\n\npassed by learned Single Judge requires interference.\n\n171. Accordingly, the order dated 26.07.2023 passed by\n\nlearned Single Judge is hereby quashed and set aside.\n\n172. Resultantly, impugned order dated 28.12.2016, whereby\n\nthe private respondents were granted promotion to Grade-IV\n\nwith retrospective effect from 01.04.2015 on notional basis, is\n\nhereby quashed and set aside only to the effect that it would\n\nnot have retrospective effect causing adverse effect upon the\n\ndirect recruits [writ petitioners].\n\n173. Since, in the policy decision dated 26.08.2021 there is\n\nnon-consideration of the inter se seniority of direct recruits,\n\nwho were appointed under Rules, 2012 in the year December,\n\nrather there is only consideration of the teachers appointed in\n\nthe year 1987, 1988, 1999-2000 in initial Matric Trained\n\nScale, as would appear from paragraph 1 of the policy\n\ndecision dated 26.08.2021, and further the State did not take\n\ncare in the said policy decision for fixing the inter-se seniority\n\nbetween the private respondents [promotes] and the writ\n\npetitioners [direct recruits], causing adverse effect upon the\n\ndirect recruits [writ petitioners], even after coming out of new\n\n- 104 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023\nrecruitment Rules, 2012 and pursuant thereto appointment\n\nmade thereunder in the year December, 2015, therefore, the\n\npolicy decision dated 28.06.2021 is hereby quashed and set\n\naside.\n\n174. Resultantly, the State is directed to prepare a fresh\n\npolicy decision taking into consideration the inter-se seniority\n\nbetween the private respondents [promotes] and the writ\n\npetitioners [direct recruits].\n\n175. Accordingly, the State is directed to prepare and publish\n\nfresh seniority list of teachers.\n\n176. With the aforesaid observations and directions, both the\n\nintra-court appeals stand disposed of.\n\n177. Pending Interlocutory Application, if any, stands\n\ndisposed of.\n\nI Agree (Sujit Narayan Prasad, A.C.J.)\n\n(Arun Kumar Rai, J.) (Arun Kumar Rai, J.)\nAlankar/\nA.F.R\n\n- 105 - L.P.A.
