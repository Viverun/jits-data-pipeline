On\nOctober 8, he tendered his resignation which was accepted on\nOctober 21, with effect from the latter date. On October\n23, he accepted employment with another Newspaper and\nthereafter claimed compensation for leave due to him. On\nNovember 11, the respondent received a letter from the\nappellant that the appellant company's rules did not permit\nany such compensation where an employee had resigned, that\nin the absence of a proper notice by the respondent there\nwas no termination of his employment and that therefore his\nacceptance of other employment was in contravention of his\nconditions of service. On November 21, therefore, the\nrespondent went to the appellant's office, received the\nletter dated October 21 accepting his resignation, the\nstatement of his account and a cheque for Rs. 2810.47 P. in\n'full and final settlement of his claim. The statement of\naccount showed that no compensation for leave due to him was\npaid and further that in calculating the gratuity payable to\nhim, the, monetary value of free telephone, free newspapers\nand car allowance were not included as part of his wages.\nThe respondent wrote immediately, on the same day, to the\nappellant setting out the circumstances in which he received\nthe cheque and acceptance of his resignation. According to\nhim he wanted to specify that the full and final settlement\ndid not include compensation for one month's leave; and that\nthe acceptance of his letter 'of resignation was withheld\nand given to him only after he accepted the cheque for Rs.\n2810.47 P. 'in full and final settlement of his claims'. On\nDecember 5, the appellant replied stating that the\nrespondent's claim for leave compensation was not admissible\nunder the company's rules and in view of the final\nsettlement the matter may be closed. The respondent's claim\nwas thereafter referred to the Labour Court. In his\nstatement of claim, the respondent claimed, (a) gratuity on\nthe basis that his monthly wages included the car allowance\nand Rs. 50, being the estimated value of the benefit of a\nfree telephone and newspapers and (b) one month's wages as\ncompensation for the month's leave, in all Rs. 6000.34 P. He\ndid not deduct the amount of Rs. 2810.47 P. as he had not\nencashed the cheque for that amount. The Labour Court\ndecreed part of the respondent's claim.\nIn appeal to this Court, on the question : (1) Whether the\nrespondent, not being in the appellant's employment at the\ntime he filed his claim in the Labour Court, was not\nentitled to avail himself of the provisions of the Working\nJournalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Pro-\nvision Act, 1955; (2) Whether the respondent, having signed\nthe receipt in full settlement of his claim was estopped\nfrom making claims in respect of his leave for one month,\nthe car allowance, and the estimated benefit of the free\ntelephone and newspapers; and (3) Whether the monetary value\nof the free telephone and newspapers and the car allowance\nwould be\n182\nincluded as part of his wages for calculating gratuity,\nHELD : (1) Since the definition of 'an employes in the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n and the C.P. & Berar\nIndustrial Disputes Settlement Act (23 of 1947), were, in\nlanguage, similar to the one used in \nWorking Journalists\n(Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act\n,\nthe decision in Western India Automobile Association v.\nIndustrial Tribunal, [1949] F.C.R. 321 and Central Provinces\nTransport Services Ltd. v. Raghunath, [1956] S.C.R. 956,\ninterpreting the word 'employee,' in those two Acts, would\nbe authorities for the view that an ex-employee would 'also\nbe a working journalist. There is no conflict of opinion\nbetween these two decisions and the decision in\nDharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra,\n[1957] S.C.R. 152 and Workmen v. The Management of Dimakuchi\nTea Estate, [1958] S.C.R. 1156. Even assuming there is some\nconflict the definitions of a 'newspaper employee' and\n'working journalist' being subject to a context to the\ncontrary, the, benefit of ss. 5 and 17 of the Working\nJournalists Act is available to an ex-employee, though he\nhas ceased to be in the employment of the particular\nnewspaper establishment at the time of his application for\ngratuity. The only requirement is that the claim in dispute\nmust be one which has arisen or accrued whilst the claimant\nwas in the employment of the person against whom it is made.\nTherefore, the respondent was entitled to maintain his\napplication. [189 E-F; 192 B-H]\nDharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra,\n[1957] S.C.R. 152 and Workmen v. The Management of Dimakuchi\nTea Estate, [1958] S.C.R. 1156, explained.\n(2)(a) Assuming the technical rule of estoppel set out in\n\ns. 115\n of the Evidence Act is applicable to industrial\nadjudication, the rule could not be invoked against the\nclaim for compensation for the leave period. The letter of\nthe respondent dated 21st November and the appellant's reply\ndated 5th December show that the respondent was always\nmaking the claim and never gave it up and that the company's\ncase was also not that the respondent gave, up the claim,\nbut that the appellant company's rules did not permit such\ncompensation. The appellant did not produce any such rules\nbefore the Labour Court and a belated referernce to any such\nrule in this Court could not be permitted without\nopportunity to the respondent to controvert it. [193 D; 194\nE]\n(b)Under s. 115 of the \nEvidence Act\n, the representation\nwhich estops a person making it from acting contrary to it\nis one on the belief of which the, other person acts in a\nmanner he would not have done but for it and on believing it\nto be true,. But such a conclusion could not be drawn in\nface of the uncontradicted statements in the letter of the\nrespondent dated 21st November that the management would not\ngive him the letter of acceptance of his resignation unless\nhe signed the receipt in full settlement of all his claims.\nWhen he received the letter dated November 19, the\nrespondent could not rest content without jeopardizing his\ninterests on the mere oral intimation of acceptance of his\nresignation and so be went to the appellant's Office to\nsecure the written acceptance. He was then told that it\nwould not be given unless he passed a receipt in full\nsettlement of his claim and he signed the receipt under the\nstress of circumstances. [195 H-196 B]\n(3)Under s. 2(rr) of the Act, 'wages' means all\nremuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money\npayable to a workman in respect of his employment or work\ndone in such employment and includes, inter alia, such\nallowance as the workmen is for the time being entitled to.\nThe car allowance and benefit of free telephone and\nnewspaper cannot be said\n 183\nto be remuneration payable in respect of employment or work\ndone in, such employment. Neither the car allowance nor the\nbenefit of the telephone was given to the respondent in\nrespect of his employment or work done in such employment as\nthey were not restricted to the employment or the, work done\nby him as special correspondent. He was entitled to them\nwhether he used them or not in connection with his\nemployment or his work as a special correspondent. They\nwould however fall under the inclusive part of the\ndefinition as 'allowances'. Since they were allowed to him\nto directly reduce the expenditure which would otherwise\nhave gone into his family budget, they were items relevant\nin the fixation of fair wages and were properly regarded as\npart of the respondent's wages. Therefore, they should be\ntaken into consideration for the calculation of gratuity\npayable to him. [196 H; 197 F-H]\nHindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v. Workmen, [1967] 1 S.C.R. 652\n674-675, followed.\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1702 of\n1966.\n\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated February 28,\n1966 of the Labour Court, Delhi in W.J. No. 2 of 1964.\nG.B. Pal, O. C. Mathur and J. B. Dadachanji, for the\nappellant.\n\n M. K. Ramamurthi, Shyamala Pappu, J. Ramamurthi, M. Mohan,\nP. S. Khera, B. Thakur and Vineet Kumar, for the respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nShelat, J. This appeal, by special leave, is directed\nagainst the award of the Labour Court, Delhi in a reference\nmade to it under\n S. 17 (2)\n of the Working Journalists\n(Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act,\n1955 (referred to hereinafter as the Act. )\nThe relevant facts leading to the said reference may first\nbe stated.\n\nBy its letter dated January 16, 1953 the appellant-company\nappointed the respondent as a staff correspondent at Gauhati\non a basic salary of Rs. 300 and dearness allowance at 40%\nthereof in addition to a fixed conveyance allowance of Rs.\n100 per month. Sometime thereafter the respondent was\ntransferred to the company's branch office at Delhi where he\nworked as a special correspondent. By 1963 the remuneration\npayable to him came to Rs. 700 as basic pay, Rs. 497 as\ndearness allowance, Rs. 200 per month as car allowance in\naddition to a free telephone and free newspapers. On\nOctober 8, 1963, while he was on leave, the respondent\ntendered his resignation. On October 14, 1963 P. K. Roy,\nthe company's General Manager, informed the respondent that\nhis letter of October 8, 1963 could not be considered\n\n184\n\nas one of resignation as under the company's rules he would\nhave first to report on duty and then to give a notice. On\nOctober 21, 1963, however, the company accepted the\nresignation with effect from that date and thereupon the\nrespondent joined the Indian Express on October 23, 1963.\nMeanwhile, one V. G. Karnik, on behalf of the company,\ninformed the respondent by his letter dated November 19,\n1963 that in the absence of a proper notice by him there\ncould be no termination of employment and that \"your\nreported acceptance of another employment in the circum-\nstances is in contravention of the terms and conditions of\nservice of this company\". The respondent had, in the\nmeantime, claimed compensation for leave due to him, to\nwhich claim the said letter of Karnik replied that the\ncompany's rules did not permit any such compensation where\nan employee had resigned. On November 21, 1963 the\nrespondent wrote to the said Roy (Ex. W/4) that (1) after\nhe had tendered his resignation there was a discussion\nbetween them when the matter of acceptance of his resigna-\ntion was amicably settled and that it was thereafter that he\njoined the Indian Express, (2) the letter of Karnik that\nthere was no termination of his employment was not correct,\n(3) after October 21, 1963 he had gone to the company's\noffice to settle his accounts and collect the dues payable\nto him as'also the letter of acceptance of his resignation\nbut he was told that the accounts were not yet ready and he\nwas not then paid even his salary and dearness allowance due\nupto October 20, 1965 although \"I bad asked for these\namounts at least\", (4) the letter accepting his resignation\nwas held back until he was prepared to sign a document\n\"purporting to waive all my rights to leave salary\" which he\nhad first refused to sign, (5) on receiving the said letter\nof Kamik he had thought necessary to get a written\nacceptance of resignation, that, as apprehended by him, that\nletter was handed over to him on that day only after he\naccepted a cheque for Rs. 2810.47 P. and had given receipt\ntherefor \"in full and final settlement of all my claims\"\n\nand that he wanted to specify in that receipt that full and\nfinal settlement on his side did not include compensation\nfor one month's leave due to him but the accountant did not\nallow him to do SO. The statement of account which was\ngiven to the respondent on November 21, 1963 and on which he\nsigned the said receipt stated that he had received the said\ncheque \"in full and final settlement of all my claims\nagainst the company subject to the bonus for 1963 if\ndeclared and payable to me\". The statement of -account\nmentioned Rs. 901-34 P. only as remuneration for 20 days of\nOctober 1963 on the basis of his monthly remuneration being\nRs. 1,397, comprised of Rs. 700 as basic salary, Rs. 497 as\ndearness allowance and Rs. 200 as car allowance. The\nstatement of account thus shows that though he was on leave\nin\n\n 185\n\nOctober 1963, the company included the car allowance while\ncalculating his wages due for these 20 days. But it also\nshows that no compensation for leave due to him was paid and\nfurther that in calculating the gratuity payable to him the\nmonetary value of free telephone and free newspapers and the\ncar allowance were not included as part of his wages. In\nreply to the respondent's letter of November 21, 1963, the\nsaid Roy, by his letter of December 5, 1963, wrote that as\nthe respondent had not taken away the company's letter of\nacceptance of resignation by the time Karnik addressed the\nsaid letter, Kamik was \"right on facts\" but, in view of the\nsettlement of his affairs and the subsequent settlement of\naccounts, \"it was better to forget the past and part\namicably\". He also made it clear that the respondent's\nclaim for leave compensation was not admissible under the\ncoinpany's rules.\n\nThe respondent thereafter applied to the Delhi\nAdministration and the latter, as aforesaid, referred his\nclaim to the Labour Court for adjudication. In his\nstatement of claim before the Labour Court, the respondent\nclaimed that the monthly wages payable to him were Rs. 700\nbasic, Rs. 497 as dearness allowance, Rs. 200 conveyance\nallowance and Rs. 50 being the estimated value of the\nbenefit of a free telephone and newspapers, aggregating Rs.\n1,447 per month. He claimed gratuity computable on the\nbasis of Rs. 1,447 as being his monthly wages, Rs. 1,447 as\ncompensation for the month's leave, in all, Rs. 6,000.34 P.\nHe did not deduct from the said claim the said amount of Rs.\n2,810.47 P. as he had not encashed the cheque given to him\nagainst the receipt dated November 21, 1963. The company in\nits written statement denied the claim relying on the said\nreceipt and further denied that the car allowance and the\nmonetary value for the free telephone and newspapers could\nbe included in the wages payable to the respondent either as\ndue to him or for calculating gratuity. Before the Labour\nCourt the company did not dispute the value of the benefit\nof the free telephone and newspapers estimated by the\nrespondent, but it raised the question whether the said\nvalue and the car allowance formed part of the respondent's\nwages and whether the amount of gratuity payable to him\ncould be ascertained on the footing of their being part of\nhis wages. The Labour Court held that there was no evidence\nthat the car allowance was not payable to the respondent\nwhile he was on leave as was the case in respect of another\nworking journalist, C. V. Vishwanath, whose claim also the\nLabour Court was trying along with that of the respondent.\nThe Labour Court found this difference a significant one and\nheld that the car allowance had to be taken as part of the\nwages. The Labour Court also held that the car allowance\nand the free telephone and newspapers were an allowance and\nan amenity respectively falling under the definition L 12\nSup CI/69-13\n\n186\n\nof s. 2 (rr) of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, both\nforming the component parts of monthly wages payable to the\nrespondent,. As regards the leave, the respondent was\nundoubtedly entitled to 30 days leave. But the company's\nplea was, firstly, that its rules did not permit\ncompensation for such leave and secondly, that it was set\noff against the period of notice which the respondent was\nrequired to give. No rules, however, were produced to show\nthat they contained any provision disallowing such\ncompensation. As regards the notice period of one month,\nthe Labour Court held that as the resignation dated October\n8, 1963 was accepted with effect from October 21, 1963 there\nwas compliance of 13 days only and therefore the management\nwas not liable to pay for the balance of 17 days leave. The\nLabour Court rejected the company's plea that the receipt\ngiven by the respondent in full settlement of all his claims\nestopped him from making these claims on the ground that as\nthese items were claimable under the Act there could be no\nestoppel against law. In the result, the Labour Court held\nthat the respondent was entitled to claim car allowance at\nRs. 200 per month, Rs. 50 per month for telephone and news-\npapers and compensation for 13 days leave, that the first\ntwo were parts of his wages, that his monthly remuneration\nwas, therefore, Rs. 1,447 and gratuity equivalent to 51\nmonths wages would have to be calculated on the basis of Rs.\n1,447 being his wages per month and directed the company to\npay on the aforesaid calculations Rs. 2,002 over and above\nRs. 2,810.47 P. for which the company had issued the said\ncheque.\n\nThe first contention raised by counsel for the company\nagainst the award was that the respondent, not being in the\ncompany's employment at the time he filed his claim in the\nLabour Court, was not a working journalist, and therefore,\nwas not entitled to avail himself of the provisions of the\nAct. \nSection 2(c)\n provides that \"unless the context\notherwise requires\" a newspaper employee \"means any working\njournalist, and includes any other person employed to do any\nwork in, or in relation to, any newspaper establishment\".\n\nClause (f) of that section defines a \"working journalist\" to\nmean a person whose principal avocation is that of a\njournalist and \"who is employed as such in, or in relation\nto any newspaper establishment\". Clause (g) provides that\nall words and expressions used but not defined in this Act\nand defined in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n shall have\nthe -meanings respectively assigned to them in that Act.\nCounsel strenuously relied on the words \"who is employed\" as\na journalist in, or in relation to, any newspaper\nestablishment in cl. (f) of\n S. 2\n, his contention being that\nit is only a newspaper employee who is presently employed in\na newspaper establishment who can resort to the Act and not\nan ex-employee whose employment has come to an end\n\n 187\n\nas a result of acceptance of his resignation. A question,\nsimilar to that raised by counsel, also arose in \nWestern\nIndia Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal\n(1). The\ncontention there was that in the light of the definitions of\n'industrial dispute' and 'an employee' as they stood in the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n before the \nAmending Act\n 36 of\n1956 was passed, a dispute as to reinstatement of a\ndischarged or dismissed workman could not fall within the\nscope of an industrial dispute. The contention was\nrejected. The Court observed that the definition of\n'industrial dispute' used the words \"employment or\nnonemployment\", that whereas one was a positive, the other\nwas a negative act of an employer, that such an act related\nto an existing employment or to an existing non-employment.\nAfter giving certain examples to illustrate the four stages\nwhen a dispute could arise, the Court at page 330 concluded\nthus :\n\n \"The failure to employ or the refusal to\n employ are actions on the part of the employer\n which would be covered by the term \"employment\n or non-employment\". Reinstatement is\n connected with non-employment and is therefore\n within the words of the definition. It will\n be a curious result if the view is taken that\n though a person discharged during a dispute is\n within the meaning of the word \"workman\", yet\n if he raises a dispute about dismissal and\n reinstatement, it would be outside the words\n of the definition \"in connection with\n employment or non-employment \"\n\nA similar question was canvassed in \nCentral Provinces\nTransport Services Ltd. vs. Raghunath\n(2) in connection with\nthe C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, XXIII\nof 1947. \nSection 2\n (1 0) of that Act defined an 'employee'\nin terms identical with those in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n\nas it stood before the amendment in 1956, i.e., as meaning\n\"any person employed by an employer to do any skilled or\nunskilled manual or clerical work for contract or hire or\nreward in any industry and includes an employee discharged\non account of any dispute relating to a change-whether\nbefore or after the discharge\". \nSection 2(12)\n defined an\n'industrial dispute to mean \"any dispute or difference\nconnected with an industrial matter arising between employer\nand employee or between employers or employees\". It was not\ndisputed that the question of reinstatement was an\nindustrial dispute but the controversy was as to whether it\nwas an industrial dispute as defined by\n s. 2 (12)\n of that\nAct. The argument was that as the workman concerned was\nalready dismissed and his employment had thereby come to an\nend, he could not be termed an employee\n(1) [1949] F.C.R. 321.\n\n(2) 11956] S.C.R. 956.\n\n188\n\nas the intention of the legislature could not be to include\nin the definition of an employee even those who had ceased\nto be in service as otherwise there was no need for the\nfurther provision in\n S. 2(10)\n which included those who were\ndischarged from service on account of the dispute. The\nCourt dismissed this contention following the decision in\nWestern India Automobile Association(1) and held that a\ndispute between an employer and an employee regarding the\nlatter's dismissal and reinstatement would be an industrial\ndispute within s. 2(12) of that Act, that the inclusive\nclause in\n S. 2(10)\n was not an indication that dismissed em-\nployees would not fall within the meaning of 'employee' or\nthat the question of their reinstatement would not be an\nindustrial dispute and that that clause was inserted ex\nabundanti cauiela to repel a possible contention that\nemployees discharged under\n ss. 31\n and \n32\n of the Act would\nnot fall within the meaning of s. 2(10) Since the\ndefinitions of \"ex employee\" in these two Acts were in\nlanguage similar to the one used in the present Act, these\ndecisions would be authorities for the view that an ex-\nemployee would for the purposes of the present controversy\nbe a working journalist.\n\nIt was, however, argued that though these two decisions con-\nsidered a dismissed employee as a workman as defined by the\nIndustrial Disputes Act and the C.P. & Berar Act, there are\ntwo decisions of this Court which express contrary views and\nthat, therefore, there is a conflict of opinion which should\nbe resolved by a larger bench. The two decisions relied on\nin this connection are: \nDharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v.\nState of Saurashtra\n(\n2) and Workmen v. The Management of\nDimakuchi Tea Estate\n(3). In Dharangadhara Chemical Works\nLtd., the appellants were lessees holding a licence for\nmanufacturing salt on the demised lands. The salt was\nmanufactured by a class of professional labourers, known as\nagarias, from rain water that got mixed up with saline\nmatter in the soil. The work was seasonal and commenced\nafter the rains and continued till June when the agarias\nleft for their villages. The demised lands were divided\ninto plots which were allotted to the agarias with a sum of\nRs. 400 for each plot to meet the initial expenses.\nGenerally the same plot would be allotted to the same agaria\nevery year, but if the plot was extensive in area it would\nbe allotted to two agarias in partnership.\n After the\nmanufacture of salt these agarias were paid at the rate of\n\n-1516 per maund. Accounts would be settled at the end of\neach season and the agarias would be paid the balance due to\nthem. These agarias worked together with the members of\n(1) [1949] F.C.R. 321.\n\n(2) [1957] S.C.R. 152.\n\n(3) [1958] S.C.R. 1156.\n\n 189\n\ntheir families and were also free to engage extra labour on\ntheir own account, the appellant company having no concern\ntherewith. No hours of work were prescribed, no muster\nrolls were maintained nor were working hours controlled by\nthe appellant company. There were also no rules as regards\nleave or holidays and the agarias were free to go out of the\nfactory after making arrangements for the manufacture of\nsalt. On these facts the question was whether the agarias\nwere workmen as defined by s. 2(s) or independent\ncontractors. Bhagwati, J. speaking for the Court, after\nquoting\n s. 2(s)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, as it stood\nprior to its amendment, in 1956, said thus :\n\n \"The essential condition of a person being a\n workman within the terms of this definition is\n that he should be employed to do the work in\n that industry, that there should be, in other\n words, an employment of his by the employer\n and that there should be the relationship\n between the employer and him as between\n employer and employee or master and servant.\n Unless a person is thus employed there can be\n no question of his being a workman within the\n definition of the term as contained in the\n Act.\"\n\nRelying in particular on the words \"unless a person is thus\nemployed\" counsel argued that this decision was at variance\nwith what was said in the Central Provinces Transport\nServices Ltd.(1) and was, besides, an authority for the\nproposition that as the definition of a workman then stood,\nan ex-employee would not be a workman within the meaning of\nthe Act. We are of the view that this decision does not\nwarrant such a contention or that there is any conflict\nbetween this decision and the two earlier decisions. The\nquestion before the Court was the distinction between an\nemployee and an independent contractor and it was only while\ndescribing the characteristics of the two relationships that\nthe learned Judge observed that unless there was a\nrelationship of master and servant and the person concerned\n\"is employed\" he could not be regarded as \"a work-man\" as\ndefined by the Act. The Court was not concerned \nin that\ncase\n with the question posited in the Central Provinces\nTransport Services Ltd.(1) whether an employee who has been\ndischarged or dismissed and who claims a relief such as\nreinstatement is a workman or not. Not having to consider\nsuch a question and being only concerned with the\ndistinction between an employee and an independent\ncontractor, the observations made by the Court to delineate\nthe features of the two relationships cannot be regarded\neither as laying down that an ex-employee is not a workman\nor as being in conflict with the two earlier decisions which\nare specific decisions on the defini-\n\n(1) [1956] S.C.R. 956.\n\n190\n\ntion of \"a workman\" in the Act. In the case of Workmen of\nDimakuchi Tea Estate(1), the dispute related to the\ndismissal of one Dr. K. P. Bannerjee. The management in the\nwritten statement pleaded that Dr. Bannerjee was not a\nworkman as defined by\n S. 2(s)\n of the Industrial Disputes\nAct, that therefore his dismissal could not be an industrial\ndispute as defined in\n s. 2(k)\n and the Tribunal could have no\njurisdiction to decide whether the management were justified\nor not in dismissing the Doctor. The Tribunal as also the\nLabour Appellate Tribunal held, presumably because Dr.\nBannerjee, was not in the words of\n s. 2(s)\n a person employed\nin any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual ,or\nclerical work, that he was not a workman within the meaning\nof \nS. 2(s)\n, that the question of his dismissal was not an\nindustrial dispute, and that therefore, his case was beyond\nthe Tribunal's jurisdiction. The workman thereupon applied\nfor special leave under \nArt. 136\n and though leave was\ngranted, it was limited to the question whether a dispute in\nrelation to a person who is not a workman was an industrial\ndispute as defined by\n s. 2(k)\n of the Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947. In view of the special leave being so limited,\nthe Court proceeded on the assumption that Dr. Bannerjee was\nnot \"a workman\" under the definition of that word as it then\nstood. The problem was, whether even so, the dispute\nregarding his dismissal could still be an industrial\ndispute, the contention of the workmen being that it would\nbe so as by the use of the expression 'of any person' in the\nthird part of\n s. 2(k)\n a dispute relating to a person, though\nnot a workman, would 'be an industrial dispute. In\nanswering this problem the Court entered into an elaborate\ndiscussion of the several provisions and the scheme of the\nAct and came to the conclusion that though the clause\ndefining 'industrial dispute' had used the expression \"of\nany person\", that expression must be given a restricted\nmeaning, namely, that the dispute must be a real dispute\nbetween the parties thereto so as to be capable of\nsettlement or adjudication by one party to the dispute\ngiving necessary relief to the other and the person\nregarding whom the dispute was raised must be one in whose\nemployment, non-employment, terms of employment or\nconditions of labour the parties to the dispute had a direct\nor substantial interest. In the absence of such an interest\nthe dispute ,could not be said to be a real dispute between\nthe parties. At page 1172 of the Report, the Court,\nhowever, has made certain observations which apparently\nappear to be in variance with the Western India Automobile\nAssociation(2) and in the Central Provinces Transport\nServices Ltd.(3). The observations relied on by counsel are\nas follows\n(1) [1958] S.C.R. 11 56. (2) [1949]\nF.C.R. 321.\n\n(3) [1956] S.C.R. 956.\n\n 191\n\n \"It is clear enough that prior to 1956 when\n the definition of 'workman' in the Act was\n further widened to include a person dismissed,\n discharged or retrenched in connection with,\n or as a consequence of the dispute or whose\n dismissal, discharge or retrenchment led to\n the dispute, a workman who had been discharged\n earlier and not during the dispute was not a\n workman within the meaning of the Act. If the\n expression \"any person\" in the third part of\n the definition clause were to be strictly\n equated with 'any workman', then there could\n be no industrial dispute, prior to 1956, with\n regard to a workman who had been discharged\n earlier than the dispute. That seems to be\n the reason why the Legislature used the\n expression 'any person' in the third part of\n the definition clause so as to put it beyond\n any doubt that the non-employment of such a\n dismissed workman was also within the ambit of\n an industrial dispute.\"\n\nThese observations, however, were made to show that as the\ndefinition of the workman stood before the 1956 amendment\nthere was a gap between a workman and an employee, that\nthough all workmen would be employees, the vice versa would\nnot be correct as the supervisory staff would not fall\nwithin the definition of workman and that that gap, was\nreduced to a certain extent by the Amendment Act of 1956 and\nthat it would not be always correct to say that the workmen\nwould have a direct and substantial interest in questions\nrelating to all kinds of employees. At page 1173 S. K. Das\nJ. observed\n \"The expression 'any person' in the\n definition clause means, in our opinion, a\n person in whose employment, or non-employment,\n or terms of employment, or conditions of\n labour the workmen as a class have a direct or\n substantial interest-with whom they have,\n under the scheme of the Act, a community of\n interest.\"\n\nWhile dealing with the decisions in Western India Automobile\nAssociation(1) and Central Provinces Transport Services\nLtd.(2), the learned Judge clearly stated at page 1176 that\nthe problem in those cases was whether an industrial dispute\nincluded within its ambit a dispute with regard to\nreinstatement of certain dismissed workmen, a problem quite\ndifferent from the one before them and that the\nillustrations given by Mahajan J. (as he then was) in the\nWestern India Automobile Association(1), \"to elucidate a\ndifferent problem\", could not be taken as determinative of a\nproblem which was not before the Court \nin that case\n. The\nproblem in each of these decisions being different and in\nview particularly\n(1) [1949] F.C.R. 321. (2) [1956] S.C.R.\n\n956.\n\n192\n\nof the fact that the case proceeded on the assumption that\nDr. Banerjee was not \"a workman\", it becomes difficult to\nagree that the observations relied on by counsel were meant\nto be or are in fact in variance with those in the two\nearlier decisions, or that therefore, there is any conflict,\nof opinion on the question that a workman whose services are\nterminated would still be a workman as defined by \nS. 2(s)\n\nbefore it was amended in 1956.\n\nBut assuming that there is such a conflict as contended, we\ndo not have to resolve that conflict for the purposes of the\nproblem before us. The definition\n s. 2\n of the present Act\ncommences with the words \"In this Act unless the context\notherwise requires' and provides that the definitions of the\nvarious expressions will be those that are given there.\nSimilar qualifying expressions are also to be found in the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, the \nMinimum Wages Act, 1948\n,\nthe C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes Settlement Act, 1947\nand certain other statutes dealing with industrial\nquestions. It is, therefore, clear that the definitions of\n\"a newspaper employee\" and \"a working journalist\" have to be\nconstrued in the light of and subject to the context\nrequiring otherwise. \nSection 5\n of the Act, which confers\nthe right to gratuity, itself contemplates in cl. (d) of\nsub-s. 1 a case of payment of gratuity to the nominee or\nthe family of a working journalist who dies while he is in\nthe service of a newspaper establishment. \nSection 17(1)\n\nprovides that where any amount is due under the Act to a\nnewspaper employee from an employer, such an employee\nhimself or a person authorised by him or, in case of his\ndeath, any member of his family can apply to the State\nGovernment or other specified authority for the recovery\nthereof. Similar provisions are also to be found in \nS.\n33C(1)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act. Claims under that\nsection include those for compensation in cases of retrench-\nment, transfer of an undertaking and closure under Ch. VA\nof that Act, all of which would necessarily be claims\narising after termination of service and the claimant would\nobviously be one in all ,hose cases who would not be\npresently employed in the establishment of the employer\nagainst whom such claims are made. Likewise, the claim for\ngratuity under\n s. 17\n read with\n s. 5\n of the Act would itself\nbe one which accrues after the termination of employment.\nThese provisions, therefore, clearly indicate that it is not\nonly a newspaper employee presently employed in a particular\nnewspaper establishment who can maintain an application for\ngratuity. The scheme of all these acts dealing with\nindustrial questions is to permit an ex-employee to avail of\nthe benefits of their provisions, the only requirement being\nthat the claim in dispute must be one which has arisen or\naccrued whilst the claimant was in the employment of the\nperson against whom it is made. There can, therefore, be no\ndoubt that the definitions of a \"newspaper em-\n\n194\n\nmade therein. The reason for not doing so seems to be that\nthe respondent had made the claim before one Mitra, the\naccountant in the Delhi office, and that claim was a matter\nof dispute. This position emerges from Roy's reply dated\nDecember 5, 1963 to the respondents said letter of November\n21, 1963 wherein the stand taken by Roy was that the\nrespondent was, not entitled to compensation for leave, not\nbecause he had given up that claim when he had signed the\nsaid receipt, but because the company's rules did not permit\nsuch compensation, It is, therefore, manifest that the\nrespondent did not make any representation when he signed\nthe said receipt that he had waived his claim for leave\nperiod or that the company did any act on any such\nrepresentation which otherwise it would not have done. In\nspite of the letter Ex. W/4, the company failed to produce\nbefore the Labour Court its rules under which it was said\nthat such a claim was not permissible. In its special leave\npetition in this Court, the company, however, cited a rule\nbut we could take no notice of it as no application for\nproducing the rules or proving them as additional evidence\nwas made and it was hardly fair or just to take notice of it\nit such a late stage without an opportunity to the\nrespondent to verify or controvert it. Roy's reply also\nindicates that the company's case, that the respondent's\nclaim for compensation for leave was at the time of\npreparing his statement of account adjusted or set-off\nagainst its claim for the notice period, could not be\ncorrect. For, if that was so, Roy would have straightway\nsaid so in his said reply, or in any event the company would\nhave led evidence of its accountant to that effect before\nthe Labour Court. The rule of estoppel thus could not be\ninvoked against the claim for compensation for leave period.\nWe next examine the question whether the respondent was\nprecluded from making the rest of his claim. The burden of\nproving the ingredients of\n s. 115\n of the Evidence Act lies\non the party claiming estoppel. The representation which is\nthe basis for the rule must be clear and unambiguous and not\nindefinite, upon which the party relying on it is said to\nhave, in good faith and in belief of it, acted. The\nstatement of account prepared at the time when the\nrespondent gave the said receipt appears to indicate that\nthe benefit of the free telephone and newspapers and the car\narowance were not taken into account and gratuity due to the\nrespondent was calculated on the amount of pay being\ncomprised of basic wages and dearness allowance only. But\nthe inference that the respondent had given up his aforesaid\nclaims when he passed the said receipt appears to be\nrebutted by the following facts : (1) though the resignation\nwas accepted on October 21, 1963 the letter of acceptance\nwas not communicated to the respondent till November 21,\n1963 when the company obtained from the res-\n\n 195\n\npondent the said receipt; (2) in the meantime, the\nrespondent received Karnik's said letter of November 19,\n1963 to the effect that there was no termination of the\nrespondent's service in the absence of a month's notice, and\non receipt of which, according to the respondent, he\nconsidered it necessary to secure the letter of acceptance\nof his resignation from the company. If the termination of\nhis service depended on the giving of a month's notice, how\nwas it that the company's Manager, D'Souza, had accepted the\nresignation and signed the letter of acceptance Ex. W/1 on\nOctober 21, 1963; (3) the company was aware, as Karnik's\nsaid letter shows, that on the basis that his resignation\nwas accepted with effect from October 21, 1963 the\nrespondent had joined the Indian Express on October 23,\n1963. The respondent's case was that it was after he was\ntold that his resignation had been accepted that he joined\nthe Indian Express. But when he received Karnik's said\nletter he decided that he could not rest content without\njeopardizing his interests on the mere oral intimation of\nacceptance of his resignation, and therefore, went to the\ncompany's office to secure a written acceptance when he was\ntold that unless he passed a receipt in full settlement of\nhis claims, the letter of acceptance would not be issued to\nhim. There appear to be two good reasons why the\nrespondent's case cannot be easily discarded. Firstly,\nsince his resignation was accepted with effect from October\n21, 1963 and even a letter to that effect was made ready and\nsigned by the company's manager, it would ordinarily have\nbeen communicated to him. If the company had any claim\nagainst him or if it wanted that his account should be\nsettled before the letter was issued to him, surely an\nintimation to that effect would have been given to him.\nSecondly, though the respondent had put on record his\nversion as to how the said receipt was obtained from him as\nearly as November 21, 1963, i.e., on the very day that the\nsaid receipt was secured from him, no refutation of any of\nthe allegations in that letter is to be found in Roy's reply\nto it dated December 5, 1963 save that the respondent's\nclaim for compensation for leave period was not admissible\nunder the company's rules. It is significant that there was\nno denial in that reply that he receipt was obtained from\nthe respondent in the manner alleged in the said letter\ndated November 21, 1963. Even at the later stages the\ncompany did not examine its accountant before the Labour\nCourt to refute the said allegations. The statements of the\nrespondent in that letter having thus remained unchallenged,\nthe Labour Court could not reject them. In these\ncircumstances it becomes doubtful whether he could be said\nto have- been estopped from making the said claim-, on the\nground only of the said receipt, if that receipt was\nobtained, as alleged by him, under the stress of\ncircumstances. In this connection the fact that he kept the\nsaid cheque uncashed is not totally without relevance.\n\n196\n\nUnder \nS. 115\n of the Evidence Act the representation which\nestops a person making it from acting contrary to it is one\non the belief of which the other person acts in a manner he\nwould not have done but for it and on believing it to be\ntrue. Such a conclusion is difficult in face of the\nuncontradicted statements in the letter Ex. W/4 that the\nmanagement would not give him the letter of acceptance of\nhis resignation unless he signed the said receipt in full\nsettlement of all his claims. The plea of estoppel made on\nbehalf of the company, therefore, cannot be accepted.\nThe third contention was that the monetary value of the free\ntelephone and newspapers and the car allowance could not be\nincluded as part of his wages for calculating gratuity. The\nvalue in terms of money of the benefit of free telephone and\nfree newspapers, as estimated by the respondent, was not in\nquestion. But the argument was that this benefit as also\nthe car allowance were given to the respondent by way of\nreimbursement for expenses which as a special correspondent\nhe would otherwise have had to incur for the proper and\nefficient discharge of his duties. The two items,\ntherefore, were neither an allowance nor an amenity. The\nfacts, however, are that the telephone was installed by the\ncompany at the respondent's residence and stood in his and\nnot in the company's name. All payments connected with it,\nincluding charges for calls, were made by the company.\nThere was no restriction that he could use the telephone\nonly for his official work or that he could not use it for\npersonal calls. He was not called upon to keep an account\nof personal calls, the payment of which he would be called\nupon to make. Nor was any estimated amount for such\npersonal calls either demanded or deducted from his wages.\nThe newspapers were subscribed by the respondent but the\nbills for them were paid by the company. It was not the\ncase of the company that the bills for them would be paid by\nit provided they were made use of by the respondent for his\nwork as a special correspondent. As regards the car\nallowance, the car belonged to and stood registered in his\nname but the company paid him a monthly allowance of Rs.\n200/-. There was nonevidence whatsoever, not even a\nsuggestion in the correspondence that that amount was\nestimated as being equivalent to the expenses of conveyance\nwhich the respondent would incur in the discharge of his\nduties. No such indication is to be found in the company's\nevidence, nor was such a suggestion put to the respondent\nwhen he examined himself before the Labour Court.\nSince wages has not been defined in the Act, its meaning is\nthe same as assigned to it in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n.\nUnder s. 2(rr) of that Act, 'wages' means all remuneration\ncapable of being expressed in terms of money, which would,\nif the terms of\n\n 197\n\nemployment, expressed or implied, were fulfilled, be payable\nto a workman in respect of his employment or of work done in\nsuch employment, and includes (i) such allowances (including\ndearness allowance) as the workman is for the time being\nentitled to; (ii) the value of any house accommodation, or\nof supply of light, water, medical attendance or other\namenity or of any service or of any concessional supply of\nfood-grains or other articles; (iii) any travelling\nconcession; but does not include any bonus and other items\nmentioned therein Mr. Ramamurthi's argument was that the\ncar allowance as. also the benefit of the free telephone and\nnewspapers would fall under the first part of the definition\nas hey are remuneration capable of being expressed in terms\nof money. The argument, however, cannot be accepted as\nneither of them can be said to be remuneration payable in\nrespect of employment or work done in such employment.\nNeither the car allowance nor the benefit of the free\ntelephone was given to the respondent in respect of his\nemployment work done in such employment as the use of the\ncar and the telephone was not restricted to the employment,\nor the work of the respondent as the special correspondent.\nThere was no evidence that the car allowance was fixed after\ntaking into consideration the expenses which he would have\nordinarily to incur in connection with his employment or the\nwork done in such employment. Even if the respondent had\nnot sed the car for conveying himself to the office or to\nother places connected with his employment and had used\nother alternative r cheaper means of conveyances or none at\nall, the car allowance would still have had to be paid. So\ntoo, the, bills for the telephone and the newspapers whether\nhe used them or not in connection with his employment or his\nwork as the special correspondent therefore, we have to turn\nto the latter part of the definition and the if the two\nitems properly fall thereunder. So, far as the car\nallowance is concerned, there was, as aforesaid, nothing to\nsuggest at it was paid to reimburse him of the expenses of\nconveyance which he would have to incur for discharging his\nduties as the special correspondent, or that it was anything\nelse than an allowance within the meaning of\n s. 2(rr)\n of\nthat Act. It would, thereaee, fall under the inclusive part\n(1) of the definition. Likewise, the benefit of the\ntelephone and newspapers was allowed to the respondent not\nmerely for the use thereof in connection with his employment\nor duties connected with it. Both the car allowance and the\nbenefit of the free telephone and newspapers appear to have\nbeen allowed to him to directly reduce the expenditure which\nwould otherwise have gone into his family budget and were\ntherefore items relevant in fixation of fair wages. (see\nHindustan anyibiotics Ltd.v.Workmen(1). That being the\nposition, the two\n[1967] 1.S.C.R. 652 at 674, 675.\n\n198\n\nitems could on the facts and circumstances of the present\ncase be properly regarded as part of the respondent's wages\nand -had to be taken into calculations of the gratuity\npayable to him.\n\nThese were the only points raised before us and since in our\njudgment none of them can be upheld the appeal must fail and\nhas to be dismissed with costs.\n\nY.P. Appeal dismissed.\n\n199",

On\nOctober 8, he tendered his resignation which was accepted on\nOctober 21, with effect from the latter date. On October\n23, he accepted employment with another Newspaper and\nthereafter claimed compensation for leave due to him. On\nNovember 11, the respondent received a letter from the\nappellant that the appellant company's rules did not permit\nany such compensation where an employee had resigned, that\nin the absence of a proper notice by the respondent there\nwas no termination of his employment and that therefore his\nacceptance of other employment was in contravention of his\nconditions of service. On November 21, therefore, the\nrespondent went to the appellant's office, received the\nletter dated October 21 accepting his resignation, the\nstatement of his account and a cheque for Rs. 2810.47 P. in\n'full and final settlement of his claim. The statement of\naccount showed that no compensation for leave due to him was\npaid and further that in calculating the gratuity payable to\nhim, the, monetary value of free telephone, free newspapers\nand car allowance were not included as part of his wages.\nThe respondent wrote immediately, on the same day, to the\nappellant setting out the circumstances in which he received\nthe cheque and acceptance of his resignation. According to\nhim he wanted to specify that the full and final settlement\ndid not include compensation for one month's leave; and that\nthe acceptance of his letter 'of resignation was withheld\nand given to him only after he accepted the cheque for Rs.\n2810.47 P. 'in full and final settlement of his claims'. On\nDecember 5, the appellant replied stating that the\nrespondent's claim for leave compensation was not admissible\nunder the company's rules and in view of the final\nsettlement the matter may be closed. The respondent's claim\nwas thereafter referred to the Labour Court. In his\nstatement of claim, the respondent claimed, (a) gratuity on\nthe basis that his monthly wages included the car allowance\nand Rs. 50, being the estimated value of the benefit of a\nfree telephone and newspapers and (b) one month's wages as\ncompensation for the month's leave, in all Rs. 6000.34 P. He\ndid not deduct the amount of Rs. 2810.47 P. as he had not\nencashed the cheque for that amount. The Labour Court\ndecreed part of the respondent's claim.\nIn appeal to this Court, on the question : (1) Whether the\nrespondent, not being in the appellant's employment at the\ntime he filed his claim in the Labour Court, was not\nentitled to avail himself of the provisions of the Working\nJournalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Pro-\nvision Act, 1955; (2) Whether the respondent, having signed\nthe receipt in full settlement of his claim was estopped\nfrom making claims in respect of his leave for one month,\nthe car allowance, and the estimated benefit of the free\ntelephone and newspapers; and (3) Whether the monetary value\nof the free telephone and newspapers and the car allowance\nwould be\n182\nincluded as part of his wages for calculating gratuity,\nHELD : (1) Since the definition of 'an employes in the"

He was then told that it\nwould not be given unless he passed a receipt in full\nsettlement of his claim and he signed the receipt under the\nstress of circumstances.

Neither the car allowance nor the\nbenefit of the telephone was given to the respondent in\nrespect of his employment or work done in such employment as\nthey were not restricted to the employment or the, work done\nby him as special correspondent. He was entitled to them\nwhether he used them or not in connection with his\nemployment or his work as a special correspondent. They\nwould however fall under the inclusive part of the\ndefinition as 'allowances'. Since they were allowed to him\nto directly reduce the expenditure which would otherwise\nhave gone into his family budget, they were items relevant\nin the fixation of fair wages and were properly regarded as\npart of the respondent's wages. Therefore, they should be\ntaken into consideration for the calculation of gratuity\npayable to him. [196 H; 197 F-H]\nHindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v. Workmen, [1967] 1 S.C.R. 652\n674-675, followed."

The management in the\nwritten statement pleaded that Dr. Bannerjee was not a\nworkman as defined by\n S. 2(s)\n of the Industrial Disputes\nAct, that therefore his dismissal could not be an industrial\ndispute as defined in\n s. 2(k)\n and the Tribunal could have no\njurisdiction to decide whether the management were justified\nor not in dismissing the Doctor. The Tribunal as also the\nLabour Appellate Tribunal held, presumably because Dr.\nBannerjee, was not in the words of\n s. 2(s)\n a person employed\nin any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual ,or\nclerical work, that he was not a workman within the meaning\nof \nS. 2(s)\n, that the question of his dismissal was not an\nindustrial dispute, and that therefore, his case was beyond\nthe Tribunal's jurisdiction. The workman thereupon applied\nfor special leave under \nArt. 136\n and though leave was\ngranted, it was limited to the question whether a dispute in\nrelation to a person who is not a workman was an industrial\ndispute as defined by\n s. 2(k)\n of the Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947. In view of the special leave being so limited,\nthe Court proceeded on the assumption that Dr. Bannerjee was\nnot \"a workman\" under the definition of that word as it then\nstood. The problem was, whether even so, the dispute\nregarding his dismissal could still be an industrial\ndispute, the contention of the workmen being that it would\nbe so as by the use of the expression 'of any person' in the\nthird part of\n s. 2(k)\n a dispute relating to a person, though\nnot a workman, would 'be an industrial dispute. In\nanswering this problem the Court entered into an elaborate\ndiscussion of the several provisions and the scheme of the\nAct and came to the conclusion that though the clause\ndefining 'industrial dispute' had used the expression \"of\nany person\", that expression must be given a restricted\nmeaning, namely, that the dispute must be a real dispute\nbetween the parties thereto so as to be capable of\nsettlement or adjudication by one party to the dispute\ngiving necessary relief to the other and the person\nregarding whom the dispute was raised must be one in whose\nemployment, non-employment, terms of employment or\nconditions of labour the parties to the dispute had a direct\nor substantial interest. In the absence of such an interest\nthe dispute ,could not be said to be a real dispute between\nthe parties. At page 1172 of the Report, the Court,\nhowever, has made certain observations which apparently\nappear to be in variance with the Western India Automobile\nAssociation(2) and in the Central Provinces Transport\nServices Ltd.(3). The observations relied on by counsel are\nas follows\n(1) [1958] S.C.R. 11 56. (2) [1949]\nF.C.R. 321."

The reason for not doing so seems to be that\nthe respondent had made the claim before one Mitra, the\naccountant in the Delhi office, and that claim was a matter\nof dispute. This position emerges from Roy's reply dated\nDecember 5, 1963 to the respondents said letter of November\n21, 1963 wherein the stand taken by Roy was that the\nrespondent was, not entitled to compensation for leave, not\nbecause he had given up that claim when he had signed the\nsaid receipt, but because the company's rules did not permit\nsuch compensation, It is, therefore, manifest that the\nrespondent did not make any representation when he signed\nthe said receipt that he had waived his claim for leave\nperiod or that the company did any act on any such\nrepresentation which otherwise it would not have done. In\nspite of the letter Ex. W/4, the company failed to produce\nbefore the Labour Court its rules under which it was said\nthat such a claim was not permissible. In its special leave\npetition in this Court, the company, however, cited a rule\nbut we could take no notice of it as no application for\nproducing the rules or proving them as additional evidence\nwas made and it was hardly fair or just to take notice of it\nit such a late stage without an opportunity to the\nrespondent to verify or controvert it. Roy's reply also\nindicates that the company's case, that the respondent's\nclaim for compensation for leave was at the time of\npreparing his statement of account adjusted or set-off\nagainst its claim for the notice period, could not be\ncorrect. For, if that was so, Roy would have straightway\nsaid so in his said reply, or in any event the company would\nhave led evidence of its accountant to that effect before\nthe Labour Court. The rule of estoppel thus could not be\ninvoked against the claim for compensation for leave period.\nWe next examine the question whether the respondent was\nprecluded from making the rest of his claim. The burden of\nproving the ingredients of\n s. 115\n of the Evidence Act lies\non the party claiming estoppel. The representation which is\nthe basis for the rule must be clear and unambiguous and not\nindefinite, upon which the party relying on it is said to\nhave, in good faith and in belief of it, acted. The\nstatement of account prepared at the time when the\nrespondent gave the said receipt appears to indicate that\nthe benefit of the free telephone and newspapers and the car\narowance were not taken into account and gratuity due to the\nrespondent was calculated on the amount of pay being\ncomprised of basic wages and dearness allowance only. But\nthe inference that the respondent had given up his aforesaid\nclaims when he passed the said receipt appears to be\nrebutted by the following facts : (1) though the resignation\nwas accepted on October 21, 1963 the letter of acceptance\nwas not communicated to the respondent till November 21,\n1963 when the company obtained from the res-"

If the termination of\nhis service depended on the giving of a month's notice, how\nwas it that the company's Manager, D'Souza, had accepted the\nresignation and signed the letter of acceptance Ex. W/1 on\nOctober 21, 1963; (3) the company was aware, as Karnik's\nsaid letter shows, that on the basis that his resignation\nwas accepted with effect from October 21, 1963 the\nrespondent had joined the Indian Express on October 23,\n1963. The respondent's case was that it was after he was\ntold that his resignation had been accepted that he joined\nthe Indian Express. But when he received Karnik's said\nletter he decided that he could not rest content without\njeopardizing his interests on the mere oral intimation of\nacceptance of his resignation, and therefore, went to the\ncompany's office to secure a written acceptance when he was\ntold that unless he passed a receipt in full settlement of\nhis claims, the letter of acceptance would not be issued to\nhim. There appear to be two good reasons why the\nrespondent's case cannot be easily discarded. Firstly,\nsince his resignation was accepted with effect from October\n21, 1963 and even a letter to that effect was made ready and\nsigned by the company's manager, it would ordinarily have\nbeen communicated to him. If the company had any claim\nagainst him or if it wanted that his account should be\nsettled before the letter was issued to him, surely an\nintimation to that effect would have been given to him.\nSecondly, though the respondent had put on record his\nversion as to how the said receipt was obtained from him as\nearly as November 21, 1963, i.e., on the very day that the\nsaid receipt was secured from him, no refutation of any of\nthe allegations in that letter is to be found in Roy's reply\nto it dated December 5, 1963 save that the respondent's\nclaim for compensation for leave period was not admissible\nunder the company's rules. It is significant that there was\nno denial in that reply that he receipt was obtained from\nthe respondent in the manner alleged in the said letter\ndated November 21, 1963. Even at the later stages the\ncompany did not examine its accountant before the Labour\nCourt to refute the said allegations. The statements of the\nrespondent in that letter having thus remained unchallenged,\nthe Labour Court could not reject them. In these\ncircumstances it becomes doubtful whether he could be said\nto have- been estopped from making the said claim-, on the\nground only of the said receipt, if that receipt was\nobtained, as alleged by him, under the stress of\ncircumstances. In this connection the fact that he kept the\nsaid cheque uncashed is not totally without relevance."

Such a conclusion is difficult in face of the\nuncontradicted statements in the letter Ex. W/4 that the\nmanagement would not give him the letter of acceptance of\nhis resignation unless he signed the said receipt in full\nsettlement of all his claims. The plea of estoppel made on\nbehalf of the company, therefore, cannot be accepted.\nThe third contention was that the monetary value of the free\ntelephone and newspapers and the car allowance could not be\nincluded as part of his wages for calculating gratuity. The\nvalue in terms of money of the benefit of free telephone and\nfree newspapers, as estimated by the respondent, was not in\nquestion. But the argument was that this benefit as also\nthe car allowance were given to the respondent by way of\nreimbursement for expenses which as a special correspondent\nhe would otherwise have had to incur for the proper and\nefficient discharge of his duties. The two items,\ntherefore, were neither an allowance nor an amenity. The\nfacts, however, are that the telephone was installed by the\ncompany at the respondent's residence and stood in his and\nnot in the company's name. All payments connected with it,\nincluding charges for calls, were made by the company.\nThere was no restriction that he could use the telephone\nonly for his official work or that he could not use it for\npersonal calls. He was not called upon to keep an account\nof personal calls, the payment of which he would be called\nupon to make. Nor was any estimated amount for such\npersonal calls either demanded or deducted from his wages.\nThe newspapers were subscribed by the respondent but the\nbills for them were paid by the company. It was not the\ncase of the company that the bills for them would be paid by\nit provided they were made use of by the respondent for his\nwork as a special correspondent. As regards the car\nallowance, the car belonged to and stood registered in his\nname but the company paid him a monthly allowance of Rs.\n200/-. There was nonevidence whatsoever, not even a\nsuggestion in the correspondence that that amount was\nestimated as being equivalent to the expenses of conveyance\nwhich the respondent would incur in the discharge of his\nduties. No such indication is to be found in the company's\nevidence, nor was such a suggestion put to the respondent\nwhen he examined himself before the Labour Court.\nSince wages has not been defined in the Act, its meaning is\nthe same as assigned to it in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n.\nUnder s. 2(rr) of that Act, 'wages' means all remuneration\ncapable of being expressed in terms of money, which would,\nif the terms of"

The argument, however, cannot be accepted as\nneither of them can be said to be remuneration payable in\nrespect of employment or work done in such employment.\nNeither the car allowance nor the benefit of the free\ntelephone was given to the respondent in respect of his\nemployment work done in such employment as the use of the\ncar and the telephone was not restricted to the employment,\nor the work of the respondent as the special correspondent.\nThere was no evidence that the car allowance was fixed after\ntaking into consideration the expenses which he would have\nordinarily to incur in connection with his employment or the\nwork done in such employment. Even if the respondent had\nnot sed the car for conveying himself to the office or to\nother places connected with his employment and had used\nother alternative r cheaper means of conveyances or none at\nall, the car allowance would still have had to be paid.

It would, thereaee, fall under the inclusive part\n(1) of the definition. Likewise, the benefit of the\ntelephone and newspapers was allowed to the respondent not\nmerely for the use thereof in connection with his employment\nor duties connected with it. Both the car allowance and the\nbenefit of the free telephone and newspapers appear to have\nbeen allowed to him to directly reduce the expenditure which\nwould otherwise have gone into his family budget and were\ntherefore items relevant in fixation of fair wages.
