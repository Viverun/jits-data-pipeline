Brief facts of the case are that the appellant-plaintiff entered\n\ninto an agreement for sale on 06.09.1983 which was registered in\n\nBook No.1 at Serial No. 1497 before the Sub-Registrar, Amreli. The\n\nagreement to sale was made by one Babubhai Karshanbhai Senjaliya\n\nin favour of the President Manohardas Karsandas Singada in respect\n\nof the proposed Kalyannagar Co-operative Housing Society.\n\nPage 2 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n3.1 The appellant- Kalyannagar Cooperative Housing Society was\n\nregistered under\nsection 9\nof the Gujarat Co-operative Societies\n\nAct,1961, by the Registration Officer, Amreli vide Registration No.\n\nGJ-9234.\n\n3.2 As per the terms recorded in the agreement for sale the\n\ndefendant-respondent herein agreed to sale the land admeasuring 9\n\nAcres i.e. 36422 sq.mtrs of Survey No. 120/2 Paiki which is\n\nestimated to 15 Vighas 06 vasa for consideration of Rs. 20,000/- per\n\nvigha.

Accordingly, the\n\napplication was made before the Deputy Collector who by order\n\ndated 10.06.1984, granted permission to the plaintiff-society to\n\npurchase the land and a permission was also granted to the original\n\nowners to sell their land i.e. total area of 11 Acres 17 Gunthas\n\ncomprising of 9Acre of Revenue Survey No. 122/2 and 2 Acres 17\n\nGunthas of Survey No. 120/4 with certain terms and conditions.\n\n3.5 Thereafter, it appears that the sale deed dated 16.07.1984 was\n\nexecuted by Babubhai Karsanbhai Senjaliya in favour of\n\nManohardas Karsandas Singada, President of the plaintiff-society\n\nwith consideration of Rs. 1,31,000/- by registered sale deed for land\n\nadmeasuring 3 Acre and 33 Gunthas of Survey No. 120/2 i.e.\n\n6 vighas and 11 vasa, 15479 sq.mtrs situated on Varsada road of\n\nAmreli and possession of the said land was handed over to the\n\nPresident of the plaintiff-society.\n\nPage 4 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n3.6 It appears that thereafter, on 29.06.1984, the Special Land\n\nAcquisition Officer, Amreli, wrote a letter to the Executive\n\nEngineer, Gujarat Housing Board, intimating him to remain present\n\nfor acquisition of the land including the land of Survey Nos. 120/2\n\nand 120/4 comprising land admeasuring 9 Acres was agreed to be\n\nsold to plaintiff-society.\n\n3.7 Revenue Entries No. 504 was mutated in village Form No. 6\n\nwith regard to registered sale deed executed on 16.07.1984 for land\n\nadmeasuring 3 Acres 33 Gunthas in favour of the plaintiff-society of\n\nSurvey No. 120/2.\n\n3.8 It is pertinent to note that another suit being No. 37/1999 was\n\nfiled before the same Court for enforcement of Agreement of Sale\n\nfor 2 Acres and 17 Gunthas of Survey No. 120/4 which was running\n\nin the name of son of the defendant-original owner by the plaintiff\n\nsociety. The defendant preferred application under Order VII Rule\n\n11 of the Code which was also rejected by the Court below against\n\nwhich the appeal is pending before the District Court as the suit\n\nvalue was less than the prescribed limit.\n\nPage 5 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n3.9 It appears that thereafter, the plaintiff as well as the defendant\n\nchallenged acquisition of the land including the land in question\n\nbefore this Court wherein a compromise was arrived at between the\n\nplaintiff and the original owner-defendant that the Gujarat Housing\n\nBoard and the plaintiff-society paid and deposited Rs. 67,000/-\n\ntowards establishment and miscellaneous expenses of Rs. 6,000/-\n\ntowards legal expenses in Current Account No. 3981 of Executive\n\nEngineer of Gujarat Housing Board, Bhavnagar as a condition\n\nprecedent to withdraw the acquisition proceedings.\n\n3.10 By letter dated 19.06.1996 written by the Housing\n\nCommissioner, Gujarat Housing Board to Special Land Acquisition\n\nOfficer, it was informed that the Board in its meeting dated\n\n11.10.1990 vide Resolution No. 2214 has resolved to exempt the\n\nland of Survey No. 120 Paiki from the acquisition with any other\n\nGovernment land available at Amreli.\n\n3.11 The Land Acquisition Officer, by letter dated 30.06.1994\n\naddressed to defendant informed that the land of Survey No. 120\n\nPage 6 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nPaiki is exempted from acquisition as per order dated 21.03.1994 of\n\nthe Revenue Department.\n\n3.12 It appears that thereafter the Collector, Amreli, by order dated\n\n10.10.1994 ordered to convert the land situated Survey Nos. 120/2\n\nand 120/4 into non-agriculture land for residential purpose and\n\npermission was granted to construct the residential house on the\n\napplication dated 24.11.1993 filed by the President of the plaintiff-\n\nsociety for land admeasuring 5 Acres 4 Gunthas.\n\n3.13 It appears that thereafter, the suit was filed in the year 1999 for\n\nspecific performance of the Agreement to Sale executed on\n\n06.09.1983 along with the documents which are referred to here-in-\n\nabove by the plaintiff.\n\n3.14 It also emerges from the record that the plaintiff thereafter\n\namended the plaint twice, once in the year 2000 and thereafter in the\n\nyear 2007 which was allowed by the Court below by passing a\n\nreasoned order at the relevant time. The issues were framed by the\n\nCourt below on 15.01.2010.\n\nPage 7 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n3.15 It appears that application Exh 205 preferred by the\n\nrespondent-defendant under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the\n\nCode was rejected by the Court below initially on the ground that\n\nreadable copy of the amended plaint was not provided by the\n\ndefendant. However, thereafter, an application was made under\n\nOrder 47 read with\nsection 151\nof the Code being application Exh.\n\n243 which was considered without disturbing the order passed below\n\nExh. 2057 and application Exhibits 205 and 243 were again heard\n\nand disposed of by the impugned order by allowing the same by\n\nrejecting the suit under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the Code.\n\n4. Learned advocate Mr. S.P.Majmudar appearing for the\n\nappellant- original plaintiff submitted that the learned Judge has\n\ncommitted a grave error in allowing the application Exhibits 205 and\n\n243 together by depriving the appellant from challenging the order\n\nof recall before the appropriate forum as originally the application\n\nunder Order VII Rule 11 of the Code was already dismissed by the\n\nCourt below and without recalling that order, the Court could not\n\nhave again passed the order allowing such applications nor a\n\nPage 8 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\ncommon order could have been passed and therefore, the impugned\n\norder suffers from vice of procedural lapses on the part of the Courts\n\nbelow.\n\n4.1 It was further submitted that even on merits of the case for\n\nrejecting the suit, provisions of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the\n\nCode would not apply in the facts of the case as the suit cannot be\n\nsaid to be barred by law more particularly, when on bare perusal of\n\nthe plaint as well as the documents in connection therewith raises a\n\nmixed question of fact and law with regard to enforceability of the\n\nAgreement for Sale which was alleged to have been executed by a\n\nproposed society coupled with other documents produced on record\n\nwhich ratified such agreement for sale by subsequent conduct of the\n\ndefendant permitting the appellant-society to make an application for\n\npermission under\nsection 63\nbefore the Deputy Collector for\n\nconversion of the land into non-agriculture the land in question\n\nwhich was already granted after arriving at compromise with the\n\nGujarat Housing Board to get the land exempted from the\n\nacquisition etc.\n\nPage 9 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n4.2 It was therefore submitted that the Court below could not have\n\nrejected the suit at threshold after more than 20 years by not giving\n\nliberty to the plaintiff to lead the evidence to prove its case, more\n\nparticularly, when the issues are already framed by the Court.\n\n4.3 It was also pointed out that the made by the Court below is\n\narbitrary and contrary to the documents produced on record by the\n\nplaintiff in support of the averments made in the plaint. It was\n\nsubmitted that even if the amendments made in the plaint are not\n\ntaken into consideration, the original plaint itself would be sufficient\n\nas averments made in the original draft of the plaint along with the\n\ndocuments produced therewith would go to show that the plaintiff\n\nhas a very good arguable case before the amendment also which can\n\nbe proved by leading oral and documentary evidence.\n\n4.4 In support of his submissions he has relied upon the following\n\njudgements:\n\n\nSalim D.

On the other hand, learned Senior Advocate Mr. Mihir Thakore\n\nwith the learned advocate Mr. Kanabar submitted that the\n\napplication under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code can be preferred at\n\nany stage of the trial and therefore the contention raised on behalf of\n\nthe appellant herein that it was filed after more than 20 years is of no\n\nconsequence. It was further submitted that the plaint is covered\n\nPage 11 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nunder the provision of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the Code and\n\ntherefore, the same can be rejected by the Court at any stage.\n\n5.1 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore invited attention of the\n\nCourt to the amendments made in the plaint in the year 2000 as well\n\nas in year 2007 by the plaintiff to point out that the such\n\namendments were made so as to wriggle out of the settled legal\n\nposition that no agreement for sale could have been made by the\n\nproposed society and such Agreement for Sale is void ab initio and\n\ntherefore, the same cannot be enforced by way of specific\n\nperformance. It was further submitted that amendments in paras 1A,\n\n1B and 1C when read together, the stand taken by the plaintiff is\n\ncontradictory to each other. In para 1A it was averred that the\n\nplaintiff relied upon the contract between the parties which was\n\ncarried out in the year 2000 and thereafter wisdom has prevailed\n\nupon the plaintiff by further amendment of the plaint by inserting\n\npara 1B which is again taking a stand that there was a deemed\n\nregistration of the society when the application for registration was\n\nmade by the society in the month of June 1983, prior to the date of\n\nPage 12 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nAgreement for Sale on 06.09.1983 whereas further contradictory\n\nstand is taken in para 1C raising contention of oral agreement\n\nbetween the parties. It was therefore submitted that the plaintiffs\n\nhave from time-to-time changed their standby amending the plaint\n\nand therefore, the entire plaint is distorted and no decree of specific\n\nperformance can be passed on the basis of the bare perusal of the\n\naverments made in the plaint.\n\n5.2 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore also referred to\n\naverments made in para 4 of the plaint to point out that vague\n\naverments are made by the plaintiff with regard to refusal on part of\n\nthe defendants to execute the sale deed in the year 1999 so as to\n\novercome the question of limitation. It was submitted that it is\n\nnothing but a piece of clever drafting by the plaintiff and as per the\n\nsettled legal position, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of such\n\nclever drafting so as to avoid the action by the Court under Order\n\nVII Rule 11 of the Code.\n\nPage 13 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n5.3 It was also submitted by learned advocate Mr. Thakore that the\n\ndocuments produced along with plaint clearly shows that the\n\nplaintiff has played a mischief with the Court by producing only\n\nfirst page of the registered Sale Deed dated 16.07.2019 at Mark 4/5\n\nwhereas the entire sale deed was produced by the defendant later on\n\nat Exh 22. It was submitted that as such sale deed produced by the\n\ndefendant cannot be looked by the Court for deciding the\n\napplication under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the same is not\n\nreferred to however, suffice is to say that the plaintiff, for the\n\nreasons best known to it, did not produce entire sale deed on record\n\nas it may be possible that there was only sale of 03 Acres and 33\n\nGunthas and not 9 Acres of Survey No. 120/2 for which the\n\nregistered Agreement to Sale was executed with the proposed\n\nsociety which cannot be enforced as per the settled legal position.\n\n5.4 It was further pointed out by learned Senior Advocate Mr.\n\nThakore that the Court below has therefore rightly came to the\n\nconclusion that the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11(d)\n\nof the Code as no decree of specific performance can be granted in\n\nPage 14 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nfavour of the plaintiff on the basis of the Agreement to Sale in\n\nfavour of the proposed society by relying upon the various decisions\n\nof this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n5.5 In support of his submissions, Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore\n\nreferred to and relied upon the following decisions:\n\n\nCanara Bank vs. P. Selathal and ors\nreported in (2020) 13\n\nSCC 143:\n\n\"8. Therefore, the short question which is posed for\nconsideration of this Court is, whether the suits filed by the\nplaintiffs were liable to be rejected in exercise of powers\nunder Order 7 Rule 11(d)\nof the CPC\nor not?\n\n9. While considering the aforesaid issue/question, few\ndecisions of this Court on exercise of powers under Order 7\nRule 11(d)\nof the CPC\nare required to be referred to and\nconsidered.\n\n9.1 In the case of T. Arivandandam (supra), while\nconsidering the very same provision i.e.\nOrder 7 Rule 11 of\nthe CPC\nand the decree of the trial Court in considering\nsuch application, this Court in para 5 has observed and held\nas under:\n\nPage 15 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n\"5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning\nthe petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the\ncourt repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the\nstatement of the facts found in the judgment of the High\nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending\nbefore the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant\nmisuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints.\nThe learned Munsif must remember that if on a\nmeaningful - not formal - reading of the plaint it is\nmanifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not\ndisclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his\npower under\nOrder 7, Rule 11 CPC\ntaking care to see\nthat the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if\nclever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of\naction, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining\nthe party searchingly under\nOrder 10, CPC\n. An activist\nJudge is the answer to irresponsible law suits....\"\n\n9.2 In the case of\nChurch of Christ Charitable Trust and\nEducational Charitable Society v. Ponniamman\nEducational Trust\n(2012) 8 SCC 706, this Court in paras 13\nhas observed and held as under:\n\n\"13. While scrutinizing the plaint averments, it is the\nbounden duty of the trial Court to ascertain the materials\nfor cause of action. The cause of action is a bundle of\nfacts which taken with the law applicable to them gives\nthe plaintiff the right to relief against the defendant.\nEvery fact which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove to\nenable him to get a decree should be set out in clear\nterms. It is worthwhile to find out the meaning of the\nwords \"cause of action\". A cause of action must include\nsome act done by the Defendant since in the absence of\nsuch an act no cause of action can possible accrue.\"\n\nPage 16 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n9.3 In\nA.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies,\nSalem\n(supra), this Court explained the meaning of \"cause\nof action\" as follows:\n\n\"12.A cause of action means every fact, which if\ntraversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove\nin order to support his right to a judgment of the court.\nIn other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with\nthe law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to\nrelief against the defendant. It must include some act\ndone by the defendant since in the absence of such an\nact no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not\nlimited to the actual infringement of the right sued on\nbut includes all the material facts on which it is founded.\nIt does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such\nfacts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove\nto enable him to obtain a decree. Everything which is\nnot proved would give the defendant a right to\nimmediate judgment must be part of the cause of action.\nBut it has no relation whatever to the defence which\nmay be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon\nthe character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff.\"\n\n9.4 In the case of Sopan Sukhdeo Sable (supra) in paras 11\nand 12, this Court has observed as under:\n\n\"11.\nIn\nI.T.C. Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate\nTribunal\n[(1998) 2 SCC 70] it was held that the basic\nquestion to be decided while dealing with an application\nfiled under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real\ncause of action has been set out in the plaint or\nsomething purely illusory has been stated with a view to\nget out of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code.\n\nPage 17 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n12. The trial Court must remember that if on a\nmeaningful and not formal reading of the plaint it is\nmanifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not\ndisclosing a clear right to sue, it should exercise the\npower under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code taking care to\nsee that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If\nclever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of\naction, it has to be nipped in the bud at the first hearing\nby examining the party searchingly under Order 10 of\nthe Code. (See T. Arivandandam (supra).\"\n\n9.5 In the case of Madanuri Sri Rama Chandra Murthy\n(supra), this Court has observed and held as under:\n\n\"7. The plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if\nconditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled.\nIt is needless to observe that the power under\nOrder 7\nRule 11 CPC\ncan be exercised by the Court at any stage\nof the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked\ninto for deciding the application are the averments of the\nplaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the\nplaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious\nand meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to\nsue, the court should exercise power under\nOrder 7 Rule\n11 CPC\n. Since the power conferred on the court to\nterminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the\nconditions enumerated under\nOrder 7 Rule 11 CPC\nto\nthe exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be\nstrictly adhered to. The averments of the plaint have to\nbe read as a whole to find out whether the suit is barred\nby any law.

Even when the allegations made\nin the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their\nface value, if they show that the suit is barred by any\nlaw, or do not disclose cause of action, the application\nfor rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power\nunder\nOrder 7 Rule 11 CPC\ncan be exercised. If clever\ndrafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause\nof action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so\nthat bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage.\"\n\n9.6 In the case of\nRam Singh v. Gram Panchayat Mehal\nKalan\n(1986) 4 SCC 364, this Court has observed and held\nthat when the suit is barred by any law, the plaintiff cannot\nbe allowed to circumvent that provision by means of clever\ndrafting so as to avoid mention of those circumstances, by\nwhich the suit is barred by law of limitation.\"\n\n\nDahiben vs. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali (Gajra\n) dead\n\nthrough Legal representatives and ors reported in (2020) 7\n\nSCC 366:\n\n\"23.1 We will first briefly touch upon the law applicable for\ndeciding an application under\nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\n,\nwhich reads as under:\n\n\"11.

In such a case, it would be\nnecessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that\nfurther judicial time is not wasted.\n\n23.4 In\nAzhar Hussain v.

The sword of Damocles need not be kept\nhanging over his head unnecessarily without point or\npurpose. Even if an ordinary civil litigation, the Court\nreadily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does\nnot disclose any cause of action.\"\n\n23.5 The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil\naction is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions\nenumerated in Order VII Rule 11 are required to be strictly\nadhered to.\n\n23.6 Under Order VII Rule 11, a duty is cast on the Court\nto determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action\n\nPage 21 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nby scrutinizing the averments in the plaint2, read in\nconjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether the\nsuit is barred by any law.\n\n23.7 Order VII Rule 14(1) provides for production of\ndocuments, on which the plaintiff places reliance in his\nsuit, which reads as under :\n\n\" 14: Production of document on which plaintiff sues or\nrelies.- (1)Where a plaintiff sues upon a document or\nrelies upon document in his possession or power in\nsupport of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a\nlist, and shall produce it in Court when the plaint is\npresented by him and shall, at the same time deliver the\ndocument and a copy thereof, to be filed with the plaint.\n\n(2)Where any such document is not in the possession or\npower of the plaintiff, he shall, wherever possible, state\nin whose possession or power it is.\n\n(3)A document which ought to be produced in Court by\nthe plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered\nin the list to be added or annexed to the plaint but is not\nproduced or entered accordingly, shall not, without the\nleave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf\nat the hearing of the suit.\n\n(4)Nothing in this rule shall apply to document produced\nfor the cross examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or,\nhanded over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.\"\n\n23.8 Having regard to\nOrder VII Rule 14 CPC\n, the\ndocuments filed alongwith the plaint, are required to be\ntaken into consideration for deciding the application under\nOrder VII Rule 11 (a).

This test\nwas laid down in\nLiverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd.\nv. M.V.Sea Success I & Anr.,4\nwhich reads as :\n\n\"139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not\nis essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or\ndoes not must be found out from reading the plaint itself.\nFor the said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in\ntheir entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to\nwhether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to\nbe correct in their entirety, a decree would be passed.\"\n\n23.12 In Hardesh Ores (P.)\nLtd. v.

The plaint has to be construed as it stands, without\naddition or subtraction of words. If the allegations in the\nplaint prima facie show a cause of action, the court cannot\nembark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are true in\nfact.\n\n23.13 If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found\nthat the suit is manifestly vexatious and without any merit,\nand does not disclose a right to sue, the court would be\njustified in exercising the power under\nOrder VII Rule 11\nCPC\n.\n\n23.14 The power under\nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\nmay be\nexercised by the Court at any stage of the suit, either before\nregistering the plaint, or after issuing summons to the\ndefendant, or before conclusion of the trial, as held by this\nCourt in the judgment of\nSaleem Bhai v. State of\nMaharashtra\n.\n\nThe plea that once issues are framed, the\nmatter must necessarily go to trial was repelled by this\nCourt in\nAzhar Hussain\n(supra).\n\n23.15 The provision of Order VII Rule 11 is mandatory in\nnature. It states that the plaint \"shall\" be rejected if any of\nthe grounds specified in clause (a) to (e) are made out. If\nthe Court finds that the plaint does not disclose a cause of\naction, or that the suit is barred by any law, the Court has\nno option, but to reject the plaint.\n\n24.1 In\nSwamy Atmanand v.

A cause of action, thus, means every fact, which if\ntraversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove\nan order to support his right to a judgment of the court.\n\nIn other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with\nthe law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to\nrelief against the defendant. It must include some act\ndone by the defendant since in the absence of such an\nact, no cause of action can possibly accrue.

In order to make good his\ncontention that such a contract is valid and\nenforceable at law, Mr. Vyas has invited our\nattention to some provisions of the\nGujarat\nCooperative Societies Act, 1961\n.\nS. 2(13)\ndefines\n\"member\" as a person joining in an application for\nthe registration of a co-operative society which is\nsubsequently registered, or a person duly admitted to\nmembership of a society after registration and\nincludes a nominal, associate or sympathiser\nmember.\nS. 2(19)\ndefines \"society\" which means a\nco-operative society registered or deemed to be\nregistered, under this Act. A reference to a society\n\"deemed to be registered \" appears to be in the\ncontext of sub-see. (2) of\nS. 169\n. Sub-section (2) of\n\nS. 169\nprovides as follows:-\n\n\"All societies registered or deemed to be registered\nunder the said Act the registration of which was in\nforce immediately before the commencement of\nthis Act, shall on such commencement be deemed\nto be registered under this Act; and all proceedings\npending immediately before such commencement\nbefore any Registrar, Arbitrator, liquidator or\ntribunal or other officer, authority or person under\nthe provisions of the said Act shall stand\ntransferred where necessary, to the Registrar,\narbitrator, liquidator or tribunal or other\ncorresponding officer, authority or person under\nthis Act, and if no such officer, authority or person\nexists or if there be a doubt as to the corresponding\nofficer, authority or person to such officer,\nauthority or person as the State Govt. may\ndesignate and shall be continued and disposed of\n\nPage 27 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nby such officer, authority or person in accordance\nwith the provisions of this Act.\"\n\nThese three provisions to which Mr. Vyas has invited\nour attention do not warrant the conclusion that the\nsociety before it is registered and comes into existence\ncan act through its promoter.\nSec. 37\nthrows light on\nthis aspect. It reads as follows:-\n\n\"A society on its registration shall be a body\ncorporate by the name under which it is registered,\n\n-w1th perpetual succession and a common seal, and\nwith power to acquire, hold and dispose of\nproperty, to enter into contracts, to institute and\ndefend suits and other legal proceedings and to do\nall such things as are necessary for the purpose for\nwhich it is constituted.\"\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that a co-operative society becomes\na legal person after it is registered and it is after its\nregistration that it acquires the capacity to enter into\ncontracts.

As the agreement to sell dated July 10,\n1980 is nullity, it cannot be specifically enforced and,\ntherefore, even a suit for specific performance of the\nsaid agreement cannot be brought by the petitioners in a\ncompetent Court. In view of this legal position, it is\nevident that it cannot be said that the petitioners are\nadversely affected by consent decree dated November\n18, 1993 passed in Regular Civil Suit No. 740 of 1986\nso as to entitle them to get permission to file an appeal\nagainst the said decree.\"\n\n6.

It is pertinent to note that the application under Exh 205 was\n\nfiled by the defendant-respondent on 12.08.2018 i.e. almost after 19\n\nyears from the date of filing of the suit.

The learned Judge after considering the documents produced\n\nalong with plaint while again disposing application Exh 205 along\n\nwith Exh 243 held that admittedly Agreement to Sale is of 1983 and\n\nwhen it was executed the plaintiff-Co-operative Society was only\n\nproposed society and was not registered under\nsection 9\nof the\n\nGujarat Co-operative Societies Act, at the same time it is observed\n\nthat thereafter the proceedings in respect of the land acquisition\n\nprocedure one of which lasted up to 1994 and thereafter the suit was\n\nfiled in 1999. However, the learned Judge has failed to consider the\n\nfact that the documents produced along with the plaint together with\n\nthe averments made in the plaint prima facie shows that both the\n\nparties in effect has proceeded with the terms of the Agreement for\n\nSale that is to say applying for permission before the Deputy\n\nCollector to purchase the land and thereafter even NA permission\n\nwas granted on the application made by the plaintiff-society.\n\nTherefore, as per the settled legal position as analyzed here-in-below\n\nPage 31 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nthe question which arises for consideration is as to whether the suit\n\ncan be said to be barred by law as per clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order\n\nVII of the Code would be a mixed question of fact or law or pure\n\nquestion of law arising from the averments made in the plaint\n\ntogether with the documents produced therewith.\n\n10. The Trial Court has recorded the conclusion in paras 17 to 20 as\n\nunder:\n\n\"17. Though, it is strongly argued by the Ld. Advocate of\nplaintiffs that issue of limitation is a mixed question of law\n& fact and it cannot be decided at this stage without\nrecording the entire evidences, but this Court is firmly of\nthe opinion that generally issue of 1\\limitation is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact, but when facts and circumstances\nthemselves clear, it is a pure question of law only, it\ndeserves to be rejected. And facts and circumstances of\npresent suit are such, which clear that issue of limitation is\na pure question of law. When the suit and plaint itself\nclears that it is barred by the law and specifically the\nLaw\nof Limitation and the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act,\n, it cannot be allowed to remain the present suit for\nfurther years in the Court.\n\n18. No new fact is brought on record by the present\napplication. At the stage of deciding the application of 0.7\nR.11, Court has to see the plaint and documentary\nevidences produced along with it only. Plaint and the\nevidences produced by the plaintiff along with the plaint\nand afterwards, clear that present suit is barred by the\nprovisions of Law of Limitation, the Gujarat Co- operative\n\nPage 32 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nSocieties Act\n.1961 and for the want of legal cause of\naction. Cause of action mentioned in the present suit is\nillusory, false, vexatious and artificial. Hence, present suit\ndeserves to be rejected under 0.7 R.11 (a) and (d).\n\n19. Arguments led by the Ld. Advocate of the\ndefendant are tenable and arguments led the Ld. Advocate\nof plaintiff are not tenable for the above mentioned\nreasons. Though, this Court had dismissed the Exh.205\nearlier for want of legible copy of the plaint on record but\nif defendant was not producing that and failed to produce\nthat before this Court then plaintiff could produce that but\nit was no followed so. Hence, it was not only the fault of\ndefendant who move present applications but also fault on\nthe part of the plaintiff. Because, Exh.205 was not decided\non merits, then this Court finds no infirmity in allowing the\napplication moved at Exh.243 under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w\n\nSection 151\nof the Code. The scheme of the said provision\ndoes not violate in any manner, if the said application is\nallowed. And accordingly Exh.205 too, as discussed above.\n\n20. In view of the above discussion, this Court is\nstrongly of the opinion that present suit deserves to be\nrejected under the provisions of 0.7 R.11 (a) & (d) of the\nCode and hence, applications under Order 7, Rule 11(a) &\n\n(d) and under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w.\nSection 151\nof the\nCode deserves to be allowed. Hence, following order is\npassed under Exhs.205, 243 and Exh. 1:-\n\n::ORDER::\n\n(1) Application at Exh.243 moved under Order-47, Rule-1\nr/w\nSection 151\nof the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is\nhereby allowed.\n\nPage 33 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n(2) Application at Exh.205 moved under Order 7, Rule\n11(a) & (d) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 is also\nallowed.\n\n(3) Present suit bearing Special Civil Suit No. 36/1999 is\nhereby rejected under Order 7. Rule 11 (a) & (d) of the\nCivil Procedure Code, 1908. (4) Copy of this order shall be\nkept along with the plaint of the suit.\"\n\n11. On perusal of the above conclusion the only observation made\n\nby the Trial Court is that when the suit and plaint itself declares that\n\nit is barred by law and specifically by law of limitation and provision\n\nof the\nGujarat Co-operative Societies Act\n, it cannot be allowed to\n\ncontinue. However, while arriving at such conclusion the Trial Court\n\nhas failed to consider the facts emerging from the plaint and the\n\ndocuments annexed therewith to the effect that the subsequent\n\nevents from 1983 till the date of filing of the suit reflected from the\n\naverments and documents annexed with the plaint clearly shows\n\nthat Agreement for Sale which is sought to be enforced under the\n\nprovisions of the\nSpecific Relief Act\nand the issue as to whether the\n\nsuit is barred by limitation requires leading of evidence as it involves\n\nthe mixed question of facts as well as law inasmuch as merely on\n\nbare perusal of the averments made in the plaint and the documents\n\nPage 34 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nannexed therewith, the Court could not have come to the conclusion\n\nthat the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of\n\nthe Code.\n\n12.

Agboatwala and ors vs.\n\nShamalji Oddhavji Thakkar\nreported in 2021 SCC online SC 735\n\nwherein the Apex Court, after considering the provisions of\nsections\nand\n25A\nof the Maharashtra and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 as\n\nwell the question of limitation has held as under:\n\n\"25. But the above contention of Shri Joshi overlooks an\nimportant facet of the case set up by the plaintiffs.\nAccording to the plaintiffs, the Estate was in the\nadministration of the Court Receiver and that in collusion\nbetween the Court Receiver and the Revenue authorities,\nthe sale as well as mutation took place without any notice\nto any of the interested parties. Collusion and fraud are the\nmain planks on which the plaintiffs have built up their\ncase. The question whether the order of the ALT and the\nsale certificate issued thereafter are the product of fraud\nand collusion, cannot be determined by the appellate or\nrevisional authority under the Act. In any case it is\ncontended by the learned counsel for the appellants that by\nvirtue of\nSection 88B(1)(d)\nof the Act, none of the\nprovisions of the Act, except a few, are applicable, \"to\nlands taken under management temporarily by the Civil,\nRevenue or Criminal Courts by themselves, or through\n\nPage 35 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nreceivers appointed by them, till the decision of the title of\nthe rightful owners\". The 7 AIR 1972 Bombay 122\nveracity of such argument has not been tested before the\nTrial Court or the High Court. We do not know whether the\nexemption under Section 88B was raised at all by the\nappellants/plaintiffs. But it is a legal issue which goes to\nthe root of the matter. Therefore, the Civil Court's\njurisdiction cannot be said to have been ousted completely.\nThe Civil Court was obliged to see at least whether the\nappointment of a Receiver for the administration of the\nEstate of a deceased person would actually fall within the\nmandate of Clause(d) of Subsection(1) of Section 88B.\n\n26. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Trial\nCourt as well as the High Court were clearly in error in\nrejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d). Hence, the\nappeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the Trial\nCourt as well as the High Court are set aside and the suit is\nrestored to file. There will be no order as to costs.\"\n\n13. The Division Bench of this Court in First Appeal No. 884 of\n\n2020 in case of\nPushpaben Yogendraprasad Mahant vs.\n\nRavirajsingh Kiritsingh Jhala\ndecided on 19.07.2021 held as\n\nunder:\n\n\"14.1 The Court has to read the entire plaint as a whole to\nfind out whether it discloses a cause of action and if it\ndoes, then the plaint cannot be rejected by the Court\nexercising the powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the\nCode. Essentially, whether the plaint discloses a cause of\naction, is a question of fact which has to be gathered on the\nbasis of the averments made in the plaint in its entirety\ntaking those averments to be correct. A cause of action is a\n\nPage 36 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nbundle of facts which are required to be proved for\nobtaining relief and for the said purpose, the material facts\nare required to be stated but not the evidence except in\ncertain cases where the pleadings relied on are in regard to\nmisrepresentation, fraud, wilful default, undue influence or\nof the same nature. So long as the plaint discloses some\ncause of action which requires determination by the court,\nmere fact that in the opinion of the Judge the plaintiff may\nnot succeed cannot be a ground for rejection of the plaint.\n\n14.2 In the present case, the averments made in the plaint,\nas has been noticed by us, do disclose the cause of action\nand, therefore, the High Court has rightly said that the\npowers under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code cannot be\nexercised for rejection of the suit filed by the plaintiff-\nappellants.\n\n14.3 The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nHardesh Ores (P) Ltd.,\nvs. Hade and Company\n(2007) 5 SCC 614 in Para 25\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"25. The language of\nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\nis quite clear\nand unambiguous. The plaint can be rejected on the ground\nof limitation only where the suit appears from the\nstatement in the plaint to be barred by any law. Mr.\nNariman did not dispute that \"law\" within the meaning of\nClause (d) of Order VII Rule 11 must include the law of\nlimitation as well. It is well settled that whether a plaint\ndiscloses a cause of action is essentially a question of fact,\nbut whether it does or does not must be found out from\nreading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments\nmade in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be\ncorrect. The test is whether the averments made in the\nplaint if taken to be correct in their entirety a decree would\nbe passed.\nThe averments made in the plaint as a whole\nhave to be seen to find out whether Clause (d) of Rule 11\n\nPage 37 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nof Order VII is applicable. It is not permissible to cull out\na sentence or a passage and to read it out of the context in\nisolation. Although it is the substance and not merely the\nform that has to be looked into, the pleading has to be\nconstrued as it stands without addition or subtraction of\nwords or change of its apparent grammatical sense. As\nobserved earlier, the language of Clause (d) is quite clear\nbut if any authority is required, one may usefully refer to\nthe judgments of this Court in\nLiverpool and London S.P.\nand I Association Ltd. v. M.V. Sea Success I and Anr.\n\n(\n2004)9SCC512 and Popat and Kotecha Property v. State\nBank of India Staff Association\n(2005)7SCC510. \"\n\n14.4 It appears that the Court below has not been able to\nunderstand the fine distinction between the plea that there\nwas no cause of action for the suit and the plea that the\nplaint does not disclose a cause of of action. In the case on\nhand, on a fair reading of the application Ex.18 filed by the\ndefendants under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure\nCode it is clear that the case of the defendants is that the\nplaintiffs have no cause of action to file the suit. It is not\nspecifically pleaded by the defendants that the plaint does\nnot disclose any cause of action. The trial Judge has also\nnot recorded any specified finding to this effect. It could\nbe said that while adjudicating the application for rejection\nof plaint the trial Judge has actually adjudicated the entire\nsuit, in other words the right, title and interest of the\nplaintiffs in the suit property. It is very unfortunate to note\nthat the trial Court proceeds on the footing that the\nplaintiffs have not been able to establish their right, title or\ninterest in the suit properties on the basis of or on the\nstrength of the revenue records i.e. the entries in the\nrevenue records. The trial Judge seems to be oblivious of\nthe fact that the entries in the revenue records even\notherwise do not confer any right, title or interest. How\ndoes the trial Judge expect the plaintiff to make good his\ncase or establish his title on the basis of the revenue\n\nPage 38 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nrecords while deciding the application for rejection of the\nplaint at the instance of the defendants.\n\n14.5 From the averments made in the plaint, it is clear that\nthe plaintiffs have pleaded a cause of action for filing the\nsuit seeking the reliefs stated in it i.e. not to say that the\nplaintiffs have cause of action to file the suit for the reliefs\nsought, that question is to be determined on the basis of\nmaterials (other than the plaint) which may be produced by\nthe parties at appropriate stage in the suit. For the limited\npurpose of determining the question whether the plaint is\nto be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 or not the\naverments in the plaint are only to be looked into.\n\n14.6 The Court below observed that in absence of further\nrevenue record prima facie title to the property cannot be\naccepted to be established. According to the Court below,\nthe plaint does not disclose that Mahant Narandas was\nancestor of Yogendraprasadji and the sale deed cannot be\nchallenged on the ground that plaintiffs were successors by\ninheritance to the property. It is important to note that the\nissue for adjudication of rights in connection to the said\nplaint will be with regards to the original transfer of rights\nby Yogendraprasadji, Ramdasguru Bhagwandas, Mahant\nNarandas to the plaintiffs. The said issue for adjudication\nof rights flowing from the Will dated 1937 cannot be shut\nmerely on the ground that there are no further revenue\nrecords reflecting the rights of the plaintiffs.\n\n14.7 The suit is yet to go for trial and plaintiffs will have to\nprove by producing evidence to establish that they are\nsuccessors of the subject property. The original entry no.\n253 will be relevant for the plaintiffs to establish their right\nto the property by succession.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nShaukathussain\n\nMohammad Patel vs. Khatunben Mohmmedbhai Polara\nreported\n\nin (2019) 10 SCC 226 has held that the averment in the plaint have\n\nto be taken into account in their entirety and considering such\n\nevidence if the case is required to be considered on merits, rejection\n\nof plaint is not justified as it is well settled that for the purposes of\n\nthe provision of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the entirety of the\n\naverments in the plaint is to be taken into account and going by the\n\nversion of the appellant as detailed in the plaint, there was element\n\nof deception and fraud which was practiced upon him as a result of\n\nwhich the document concerned got entered into. In the facts of the\n\nsaid case and considering such averments made in the plaint and the\n\nfact that the plaintiff-appellant was always in possession of the\n\nproperty in question the issue raised in the matter was required to be\n\nconsidered on merits.\n\nPage 40 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n15.\nIn case of\nSejal Glass Ltd vs. Navilan Merchants Pvt. Ltd\n\nreported in 2018 11 SCC 780 while examining the relative scope\n\nand applicability of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code read with Order\n\nVI Rule 16 of the Code it was held that if the condition mentioned in\n\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the Code are fulfilled entire plaint is to be\n\nrejected. However, where it appears that plaint cannot be proceeded\n\nwith in some part but it can be proceeded in another part, Order VII\n\nRule 11 of the Code has no application and then suit as a whole must\n\nproceed to trial.\n\n\"20.\nIn the case of\nAhmed Hossein vs. Mt. Chembelli\nand others\nreported in AIR 1951 Cal 262, a decision\nrelied upon by Mr. Thakore, the suit was on a\ndishonoured cheque. The plaint did not state that any\nnotice of dishonour had been given or that any\ncircumstances existed which rendered it unnecessary to\ngive such notice. The plaintiff subsequently sought to\nintroduce these statements in the plaint by an\namendment. The application was opposed by the\ndefendants on the ground that by reason of the absence\nof these allegations, the plaint as it stood then, disclosed\nno cause of action and hence it must be rejected under O.\n7, R. 11 (a) of the Code and the Court had no power to\nallow the amendment. The plaintiff's answer was two\nfold : First the plaint disclosed a cause of action in spite\nof the omission to state anything with regard to the\nnotice of dishonour and secondly, that O. 7, R. 11, does\nnot take away the Court's power to order amendment of\n\nPage 41 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nthe plaint. With regard to the first point, the plaintiff's\ncontention was that the facts relating to the notice of\ndishonour were not part of the cause of action on a\ndishonoured cheque but were mere conditions precedent\nnecessary for the case on the cheque, the performance or\noccurrence of which is to be implied in the plaint under\nO. 6, R. 6 of the Code. Sarkar J (as His Lordship then\nwas) did not accept this contention. His Lordship made\nthe following observations in this connection:\n\n\"A cause of action is that bundle of facts which would,\nif left to itself, create in law a right or obligation, while a\ncondition precedent is something which prevents the\nright or obligation which would have otherwise sprung\nout from those facts from springing out. A condition\nprecedent has thus been described in the notes to O. 19,\nR. 14 in the White Book:\n\n\"Cases constantly occur in which, although everything\nhas happened which would at common law prima facie\nentitle a man to a certain sum of money, or vest in him a\ncertain right of action there is yet something more which\nmust be done or something more which must happen in\nthe particular case before he is entitled to sue either by\nreason of the provisions of some statute, or because the\nparties have expressly so agreed; this something more is\ncalled a condition precedent. It is not of the essence of\nsuch a cause of action, but it has been made essential. It\nis an additional formality superimposed on the common\nlaw.\"\n\nI would in the above quotation add to the words\n\"common law\" the words \"or statute.\" Now the liability\nof the drawer of a cheque arises under\nS. 30\n, Negotiable\nInstruments Act, and except as\nlaid down in\nthat section\nthe drawer of a dishonoured cheque has no liability. This\n\nPage 42 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\nis because the whole law as to cheques is contained in\nthat Act and the only section dealing with the liability of\nthe drawer of a cheque is\nS. 30\n. The section provides\nthat the drawer of a cheque shall be liable to compensate\nthe holder in case of dishonour \"provided due notice of\ndishonour has been given to, or received by, the drawer\nas hereinafter provided.\"\nSections 91\nto\nof the Act lay\ndown the provisions relating to the manner of the giving\nof the notice of dishonour and the cases where the\ngiving of the notice is excused. The only way therefore\nin which liability on a cheque may arise is when (1) the\ncheque is dishonoured and (2) notice of such dishonour\nhas been given or circumstances exist which render it\nunnecessary to give such notice. It is not a case where if\nno provisions as to notice of dishonour had been laid\ndown, a right would have arisen in the holder on the\ndishonour of the cheque and where the only effect of\nthose provisions is to prevent such right from springing\nup. The notice of dishonour as the law as to cheques\nstands is a part of the cause of action on a dishonoured\ncheque.\nIn Fruhauf v. Grosvenor and Co., (1892) 67 I. T.\n350: (61 L. J. Q. B. 717), Lord Coleridge C. J.,\nexpressed himself in these words:\n\n\"The obligation upon the drawer of a cheque to pay does\nnot arise until notice of dishonour thereof has been\ngiven to him, and therefore the statement of the case\nagainst the defendant here is not full and complete\nwithout either an allegation of notice of dishonour of the\ncheque having been given to the defendant the drawer of\nit, or of facts excusing the plaintiff from giving such\nnotice.\"\n\nIt was decided in this case that in the absence of the\nallegations as to the notice of dishonour, the plaint on a\ndishonoured cheque would not disclose a cause of\naction.\"\n\nPage 43 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n21. We respectfully agree with the above view. In the\ncase before us, if we apply the above principles, the\npermission of the Charity Commissioner is not of the\nessence of a cause of action, but it has been made\nessential. It is an additional formality superimposed\nwhich prevents the right or obligation which would have\notherwise sprung out from those facts from springing\nout. Thus, by taking aid of the above decision it cannot\nbe legitimately contended that grant of permission is the\ncause of action like dishonour of a cheque in an action\nfor dishonour of cheque; on the other hand, it is a\ncondition precedent for enforcement of the right which\nis the subject-matter of the suit and thus, Order 6 Rule 6\nclearly applies.\"\n\n16. From the above conspectus of law, it emerges that while\n\nconsidering the Order VII Rule 11 of the Code only the averment\n\nmade in the plaint is required to be considered along with the\n\ndocuments produced with the plaint and it has to be borne out from\n\nthe facts of the case that the entire suit is barred by law including the\n\nlimitation and no cause of action could be disclosed from the\n\naverments made in the plaint.\n\n17. In the facts of the case however it is difficult to come to the\n\nconclusion that there is no cause of action averred in the plaint, more\n\nparticularly, in view of the events which have taken place from 1983\n\nPage 44 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\ntill 1999 before filing the suit i.e. from the date of Agreement for\n\nSale till date of filing of the suit as it is reflected from the averments\n\nas well as the documents annexed with the plaint which requires\n\nscrutiny on merits after giving opportunity to the both the sides to\n\nlead the evidence.\nIn such circumstances, reliance placed by learned\n\nSenior Advocate Mr. Thakore on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in case of\nDahiben vs. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali\n(\nsupra)\n\nand Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal\n(supra) and the decision of this\n\nCourt in case of\nShri Ramji Mandir Narsinhji vs. Narsinh Nagar Co-\n\noperative\nHousing Society Ltd.\n(supra) would not be applicable.\n\nIn\n\ncase of\nDahiben vs Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali\n(supra), the Apex\n\nCourt has held that it was a case of a classic clever drafting of the\n\nplaint attempted to make out an illusionary cause of action and bring\n\nthe suit within the period of limitation whereas in the facts of the\n\ncase, even if the subsequent amendments are not taken into\n\nconsideration, it cannot be said that it is case of clever drafting\n\ninasmuch as the averments made in the plaint requires to be\n\nconsidered after providing an opportunity to both the sides to lead\n\nthe evidence.\nSimilarly, in case of Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal\n\nPage 45 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\n(supra) considering the facts of the case and the averments made in\n\nthe plaint as the specific remedy was provided under the provisions\n\nof the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 and there was\n\ninordinate delay of 15 years in challenging the action of the bank, in\n\nsuch circumstances, it was held by the Apex Court that the suit was\n\nbarred by law under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Whereas in the\n\npresent case, merely because it is alleged by the defendant that the\n\nsuit is barred by law as the Agreement for Sale is prior to the date of\n\nregistration of the plaintiff-society, the suit could not have been\n\nrejected as such contention is required to be tested by leading\n\nevidence.\n\n18. In view of the foregoing reasons, the impugned order passed by\n\nthe Principal Senior Civil Judge, Amreli dated 05.08.2021 below\n\nExhibit 205 is hereby quashed and set aside without adjudicating as\n\nto whether the Court below could have re-decided Exh 205\n\nsimultaneously, while considering the review application filed under\n\nOrder 47 read with\nsection 151\nof the Code and allowing the\n\napplication Exh 243 and dismissing the suit by allowing the\n\nPage 46 of 47\n\nDownloaded on : Sat Sep 16 21:00:08 IST 2023\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/FA/4234/2021 JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023\n\nundefined\n\napplication Exh 205 which was already dismissed earlier.
