While the order of the Appellate Authority confirming the order\n\npassed by the Controlling Authority, is under challenge in W.P.No.21456 of\n\n2013, the order passed by the Controlling Authority is directly under\n\nchallenge in W.P.No.23449 of 2013.\n\n3. Since the issue involved in these Writ Petitions is one and the\n\nsame, the cases are taken up for disposal by a common order.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.4 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n4. According to the Petitioner-Bank, Respondents 3 to 11 in\n\nW.P.No.21456 of 2013 and Respondents 2 to 42 in W.P.No.23449 of 2013 were\n\nemployees of the Petitioner-Bank and they had retired from service on\n\nattaining superannuation on various dates. It is further stated that the\n\nretired employees received entire gratuity due to them, as per the\n\nSettlement dated 26.02.1997, without any limitation, either fixed by the Act\n\nor under the Group Gratuity Scheme. However, they filed Applications\n\nbefore the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Coimbatore, claiming that,\n\nthey are entitled to receive further amount of gratuity, notwithstanding the\n\nclaim made already, as per the Settlement dated 26.02.1997.\n\n5. It is the case of the Petitioner-Bank that, in both Writ Petitions,\n\nthe Controlling Authority, without considering the Settlement dated\n\n26.02.1997 in a proper perspective, accepted the claim of the retired\n\nemployees, as also the method adopted by them in calculating the length of\n\nservice, and ordered to pay the difference of gratuity amount, with interest\n\nat the rate of 10% from the date of Applications.\n\n6. According to the learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank, in\n\nterms of\nSection 4(5)\nof the Gratuity Act, workmen cannot be permitted to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.5 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nadjudicate their remedy before the Controlling Authority, and their rights are\n\nelsewhere. Having signed the Settlement with open eyes, and having\n\nenjoyed the benefits of the linked Insurance Scheme and received the\n\ngratuity amount, retired employees herein cannot adjudicate the issue, more\n\nparticularly, before the Authority under the\nGratuity Act\n.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank went on to state that,\n\nas per the linked Gratuity Scheme adopted by virtue of the Settlement dated\n\n26.02.1997, an employee is entitled to get 15 days' wages for every\n\ncompleted year, as gratuity, subject to a maximum of the amount equalling\n\nto 20 months' salary. Further, as per the terms of the Settlement, for the\n\npurpose of calculation of Gratuity, 26 days will be reckoned as a month not\n\nonly for arriving at pay, but also for calculation of length of service.\n\n8. Learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to the\n\nExplanation clause inserted in\nSection 4\nof the Gratuity Act, which reads\n\nthat \"In case of a monthly-rated employee, the 15 days' wages shall be\n\ncalculated by dividing the monthly rate of wages last drawn by him by\n\ndividing 26 and multiplying the quotient by 15.” Thus, according to the\n\nlearned counsel, the terms of the Settlement dated 26.02.1997 were\n\nincorporated, in conformity with the Explanation inserted in\nSection 4\nof the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.6 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nGratuity Act\n, for the purpose of calculating one day salary, and 20 months'\n\nsalary, which is the maximum ceiling during the relevant period.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank pointed out that, the\n\nemployees herein misconstrued the terms of the Settlement, as if, every 26\n\ndays will form a month and as such, the calculation of length of service\n\nwould be long than the actual working years. According to him, if such\n\nmethod is adopted, then, a year with 365 days would have 14 months, and\n\nthe same would lead to absurdity.\n\n10. In support of his stand, learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank\n\nhas relied on the following:\n\n(i) an Apex Court decision in the case of\nAllahabad Bank vs. All\n\nIndia Allahabad Bank Retired Employees Association\n, 2010 (2) SCC 44\n\n“43. The scheme envisaged under\nSection 7\nof\nthe Act is that in case of any dispute as to the amount of\ngratuity payable to an employee under the Act or as to the\nadmissibility of any claim of, or in relation to, an\nemployee payable to gratuity, etc. the employer is\nrequired to deposit with the Controlling Authority the\nadmitted amount payable as gratuity. In case of any\ndispute, the parties may make an application to the\nControlling Authority for deciding the dispute who after\ndue inquiry and after giving the parties to the dispute, a\nreasonable opportunity of being heard, determine the\nmatter or matters in dispute and if, as a result of such\ninquiry any amount is found to be payable to the\nemployee, the Controlling Authority shall direct the\nemployer to pay such amount to the employee.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.7 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n44. Sub-section (7) of\nSection 7\nprovides for an\nappeal against the order of the Controlling Authority.\nThe\nAct\nnowhere confers any jurisdiction upon the Controlling\nAuthority to deal with any issue under sub-section (5) of\n\nSection 4\nas to whether the terms of gratuity payable\nunder any award or agreement or contract is more\nbeneficial to employees than the one provided for\npayment of gratuity under the Act. This Court's order could\nnot have conferred any such jurisdiction upon the\nControlling Authority to decide any matter under sub-\nsection (5) of\nSection 4\n, since Parliament in its wisdom had\nchosen to confer such jurisdiction only upon the\nappropriate Government and that too for the purposes of\nconsidering to grant exemption from the operation of the\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n45. Even on merits the conclusions drawn by the\nControlling Authority that the Pension Scheme (Old)\noffered by the Bank is more beneficial since the amount of\nmoney the pensioners got under the pension scheme is\nmore than the amount that could have been received in\nthe form of gratuity under the provisions of the Act is\nunsustainable. The Controlling Authority failed to\nappreciate that sub-section (5) of\nSection 4\nof the Act\nprotects the right of an employee to receive better terms\nof gratuity under any award or agreement or contract with\nthe employer than the benefits conferred under the Act.\nThe comparison, if any, could be only between the terms\nof gratuity under any award or agreement or contract and\npayment of gratuity payable to an employee under\nSection\nof the Act. There can be no comparison between a\npension scheme which does not provide for payment of any\ngratuity and right of an employee to receive payment of\ngratuity under the provisions of the Act.”\n\n(ii) a decision of this Court in the case of\nVenugopal vs. The Joint\n\nCommissioner of Labour, Appellate Authority\nunder the\nPayment of\n\nGratuity Act\n, Madurai, (2012) (IV) LLJ 625\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.8 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n“10.\n\nHe further relied on the judgment of the\nCalcutta High Court reported in 1982 (\nII LLJ 324 [Eastern\nCoal Fields Ltd., v. Regional Labour Commissioner\n]. In\nparagraph 6, it was observed as follows:-\n\n\"6. ...It also appears to me the\nPayment\nof Gratuity Act\nin a beneficial legislation\nintended to give benefits to the employees and\nthe provisions of the Act should be construed\nliberally in a way so that the beneficial intention\nis not frustrated by any strict and narrow\ninterpretation but the benefit under the Act\nreaches the maximum possible employees. In my\nview, the provisions of\nSection 4(5)\nof the act has\nauthorised the Controlling Authority to grant a\nhigher quantum than quantum of gratuity under\nthe Act in view of favourable conditions of\nservice, although in the absence of such\nfavourable conditions, such higher quantum could\nnot have been decided by the Controlling\nAuthority. In my view, it will not be proper\nconstruction in keeping with the beneficial\npurpose of the legislation, that although under\n\nSection 4(5)\nof the Act an employee may be\nentitled to a higher payment of gratuity but for\nenforcing such favourable terms of service for\nhigher gratuity, he should move a different forum\nand the authority under the\nGratuity Act\ncannot\nentertain such claim of higher amount of\ngratuity. In the facts of the case, it does not\nappear that the Tribunals below have acted\nbeyond the jurisdiction and/or have made\nadjudications not warranted in law. Hence no\ninterference is called for in the constitutional\nwrit jurisdiction and the writ petition is dismissed\nwithout any order as to costs.\"\n\n(iii) another decision of this Court in the case of the\nManagement,\n\nVirudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank vs. The Assistant\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.9 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nCommissioner of Labour, Virudhunagar, (2013 (1) LLJ 745)\n\n“11. According to the petitioner Bank, the first\nrespondent, authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n,\nhas no jurisdiction to decide the disputes, on the\ninterpretation of 12(3) settlement, in view of\nSection 36(A)\n\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, which contemplates that if\nany difficulty or doubt arises as to interpretation any\nprovision or any award or settlement, the appropriate\nGovernment shall refer the question to such Labour Court,\nTribunal or National Industrial Tribunal, as it may think fit.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, the petitioner bank has sought\nfor quashment of the common order, dated 22.04.2009.\n\n16. Though several contentions have been raised on\nmerits, for and against the impugned order, this Court\ndeems it fit to address the preliminary issue, raised in this\nwrit petition, as to whether the Assistant Commissioner of\nLabour, Madurai, has jurisdiction to entertain the dispute,\nunder the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nThe factual dispute as\ncould be deduced from the pleadings is whether the\ncomputation of the period for calculating gratuity should\nbe on the basis of wages for 26 days in a month, though\nthe number of days in a month is 30. Whether such\ndispute attracts the provision under\nSection 7 (4)\nof the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, empowering the controlling\nauthority to adjudicate the dispute, and whether the\nterms of the settlement under\nSection 12(3)\nof the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, can be subject matter of a\ndispute, falling under\nSection 7(4)\nof the Payment of\nGratuity Act.”\n\n(iv) a Gujarat High Court decision in the case of\nGujarat State\n\nRoad Transport Corporation vs. Chandrakant Tapubhai Vyas\n, 2004 (3) LLJ\n“9. However, the peculiar circumstance has arisen\nin the present group of cases inasmuch as it was required\nunder the law pending the appeals, the amount as ordered\nby the Controlling Authority is already deposited by the\npetitioner-Corporation with the authority, and the said\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.10 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\namount is of course including the interest. Pending the\npetitions, the said amount has remained with the\ncontrolling authority, and pursuant to the interim order\npassed by this Court in the petition concerned, withdrawal\nwas stayed. However, in view of the aforesaid statement\nmade by Mr. Rawal during the course of the hearing, when\nthe Corporation has also taken a decision for admissibility\nof the gratuity and its payment thereof by instalment, as\non today, it cannot be said that the gratuity to the\nemployees concerned would not be admissible. Since the\nmatter is pertaining to payment of gratuity by way of\nretiral dues to the employees and when the payment has\nalready been deposited with the controlling authority\nunder the Act and in view of the declaration made by Mr.\nPrajapati for the employees concerned that they are not\ninsisting for the interest if the principal amount deposited\nwith the controlling authority is permitted to be\nwithdrawn by the employees concerned, I find that no\nuseful purpose would be served in remanding the matters\nto the appellate authority and/or controlling authority for\nthe purpose of reconsidering the issue again. As such on\naccount of the above referred subsequent change in the\ncircumstances, the admissibility of gratuity amount is\nadmitted on account of subsequent decision of the\nCorporation itself. Further, if the matters are remanded to\nthe appellate authority for reconsideration of the issue\nand to render a decision afresh in view of the aforesaid\nchange in the circumstances, the only consequence would\nbe that the Corporation may get back the amount which\nthereafter will be required to be paid by installments as\nper its decision. Had it been a case where the liability to\npay the gratuity were not in existence, the matter would\nhave been viewed differently, but when the Corporation\nitself has taken a decision to pay gratuity but by\ninstallments, I find that considering the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances, no serious prejudice will be caused to the\nCorporation if the employees concerned is allowed to\nwithdraw the principle amount of gratuity lying with the\ncontrolling authority and the amount forming interest can\nbe ordered to be refunded to the Corporation.\"\n\n(v) yet another Gujarat High Court decision in the case of\nGujarat\n\nState Export Corporation Ltd. vs. Madhusudan L.Khandwala\n, 2004 (II) LLJ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.11 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n“13. In the present case the Controlling Authority\ncould have directed the petitioner corporation to grant\nbenefit to the extent the same was flowing from the\nprovisions of the Act and should have restrained itself from\nordering payment on the basis of private scheme. When\nthe private scheme provides for payment of one month\nsalary for each completed year of service it has reason to\nprovide for maximum limit also. If the provisions of the\nprivate scheme are less beneficial, then under the\nprovisions of the Act an employee can approach the\nControlling Authority and the Controlling Authority can\norder enforcement of rights flowing from the Act. In the\npresent case the respondent in Special Civil Application\nNo.8285 of 2001 is concerned he has put in 32 years of\nservice. Under the provisions of the Act he is entitled to\nget 16 months' salary. To that extent his claim for payment\nof 16 months' salary deserves to be allowed.\n\n14. In the result, petitions succeed. The\njudgements and orders of the Controlling Authority as\nconfirmed by the appellate authority in all these petitions\nare hereby quashed and set aside. However, the petitioner\ncorporation is directed to pay the amount of gratuity to\nthe respondents on the basis of private scheme as it stood\non the day when the right accrued in favour of the\nemployees or on the basis of\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\nwhichever is more beneficial to the employee. Rule is\nmade absolute to the aforesaid extent only. No order as to\ncosts.”\n\n(vi) a Kerala High Court decision in the case of\nAyyappan vs. Joint\n\nLabour Commissioner\n, 1999 (2) LLJ 1351\n\n“4.\nSection 7\nof the Act enables an employee to\napproach the controlling authority for determination of\nthe amount towards gratuity.\nSection 7\ncan be invoked\nonly by \"a person who is eligible for payment of gratuity\nunder this Act.\" The gratuity claimed by the petitioner is\nnot under this Act but under Ext. P2.\nUnder the Act\nthe\npetitioner is entitled only to the rate as mentioned in Sub-\n\nsection 2\nof\nSection 4\nThe amount granted in Ext. P4 is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.12 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nequal to that rate. Therefore, limiting of the gratuity\npayable to the petitioner under the Act to 15 days' wages\nfor every completed year as contained in Ext. P4 is\njustified though on a different ground. On that basis, the\npetitioner cannot challenge the quantum of gratuity\ndirected to be paid in Ext. P4. Therefore, Ext P4 to that\nextent alone is upheld. But the finding that Ext. P2 is not\napplicable to the petitioner is set aside and left open.”\n\n(vii) another Kerala High Court decision in the case of\nSivaraman\n\nNair vs. The Plantation Corporation\n, 2005 (1) KLT 1\n\n“13. Therefore, the Controlling Authority could\nhave determined a claim as exclusively coming under the\nAct alone. Of course, a claim for gratuity other than that\ncoming within the purview of the Act could have been\nadjudicated under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, by a Labour Court. In such a case also,\npossibly the adjudication could have been only as\nprescribed by the settlement, and simultaneously taking\nnotice of the ceiling as it always was to operate as a\npackage deal. In short, the petitioners had to face\nrestrictions at one point or another, viz., at the rate\nprescribed by the Government Orders, and with a ceiling\nprescribed by the order, or purely under the Act. The\nclaims as presented therefore were ambitious, but without\nlegal backing.”\n\n(viii) yet another Kerala High Court decision in the case of\nThomas\n\nKurian vs. Idukki District Co-operative Bank Ltd.\n, (2003) III LLJ 1026\n\n“6. ... The petitioner filed objections contending\nthat he was entitled to furthermore amount in view of the\nprovisions in the revised service regulations. As the\npetitioner was not ready to repay the excess amount\ncollected by him, the bank filed arbitration proceedings\nbefore the arbitrator and thereafter the petitioner filed\nexhibit P-12 application before the Controlling Authority\nconstituted under\nSection 3\nof the Gratuity Act claiming\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.13 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nfurther amount. Learned counsel for the first respondent\nsubmitted that the maximum amount payable under Sub-\nsection (3) of\nSection 4\nof the Gratuity Act is Rs. 3.5 lakhs\nand the bank is not disputing the petitioner's claim for Rs.\n3.5 lakhs. The Controlling Authority constituted under the\n\nGratuity Act\ncan consider the claim of an employee in\naccordance with the provisions of the\nGratuity Act\nand can\nsanction me maximum amount or Rs. 3.5 lakhs prescribed\nunder Sub-section (3). In view of\nSection 5\nof the Act, the\nControlling Authority can allow in excess of the maximum\nprescribed under Sub-section (3), if there, was any\nprovision in the bye-law or any agreement with the\nemployer entitling for higher amount. But in the present\ncase, by exhibit P-1 circular, the gratuity payable to an\nemployee was limited to the amount payable under the\n\nGratuity Act\n. The Controlling Authority constituted under\nthe\nGratuity Act\nis incompetent to consider the legality or\npropriety of exhibit P-1 circular as he does not have any\nauthority or jurisdiction to consider the same. When the\nright to get the maximum amount of gratuity under the\n\nGratuity Act\nis not disputed by the bank, the Controlling\nAuthority has no jurisdiction in adjudicating the dispute\nregarding the excess amount paid to the employee. As the\ndispute is relating to the payment of an amount in excess\nof the amount prescribed under Sub-section (3) of\nSection\nof the Gratuity Act and that being a dispute between the\nemployer and employee, it has to be adjudicated by the\narbitrator under\nSection 69\nof the Co-operative Societies\nAct.\nThe Co-operative Societies Act\nenvisages a dispute\nbetween the employer and the former employee also to be\ndecided by arbitration. Hence, exhibit P-8 proceedings\ninitiated by the bank before the arbitrator is in accordance\nwith law and has to be proceeded with. In the present\ncase, the Controlling Authority cannot have any\njurisdiction in the matter, as the dispute relates to the\nclaim regarding the excess amount paid which is beyond\nthe purview of the\nGratuity Act\n. Hence, the reliefs prayed\nfor in this original petition cannot be allowed.”\n\n(ix) another Apex Court decision in the case of\nShri Digvijay\n\nWoollen Mills Ltd. vs. Shri Mahendra Prataprai Buch\n, (1980 (4) SCC 106)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.14 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n“5. The view expressed in the extract quoted\nabove appears to be legitimate and reasonable. Ordinarily\nof course a month is understood to mean 30 days, but the\nmanner of calculating gratuity payable under the Act to\nthe employees who work for 26 days a month followed by\nthe Gujarat High Court cannot be called perverse. It is not\nnecessary to consider whether another view is possible.\nThe High Court summarily dismissed the petition of the\nappellant in both the appeals before us and upheld the\ndecision of the authorities under the Act. We are not\ninclined to interfere with the decision of the High Court\nbecause it seems to us that the view taken by the\nauthorities is not in any way unreasonable or perverse.\n\nIncidentally, to indicate that treating monthly wages as\nwages for 26 working days is not anything unique or\nunknown, we may refer to a passage from the judgment of\nthis Court in\nDelhi Cloth and General Mills Company Ltd.\nv. Workmen\n[AIR 1970 SC 919 : (1969) 2 SCR 307 : (1969) 2\nLLJ 755 : 36 FJR 247] which disposed of several appeals\narising out of an award made by the Industrial Tribunal,\nDelhi. In the award, schemes were framed relating to the\npayment of gratuity. The expression “average of the basic\nwage” occurring in the schemes was explained by this\nCourt as follows:\n\n“It was also urged by Mr Ramamurthi\nthat the expression ‘average of the basic\nwage’, in the definition of ‘wages’ in clause 4\nof the schemes is likely to create complications\nin the implementation of the schemes. He\nurged that if the wages earned by a workman\nduring a month are divided by the total number\nof working days, the expression ‘wages’ will\nhave an artificial meaning and especially where\nthe workman is old or disabled or incapacitated\nfrom rendering service, gratuity payable to him\nwill be substantially reduced. We do not think\nthat there is any cause for such apprehension.\nThe expression ‘average of the basic wages’\ncan only mean the wage earned by a workman\nduring a month divided by the number of days\nfor which he has worked and multiplied by 26\nin order to arrive at the monthly wage for the\ncomputation of gratuity payable. Counsel for\nthe employers agree to this interpretation.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.15 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n(x) yet another Apex Court decision in the case of Jeewanlal Ltd.\n\nvs. Appellate Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1984\n(4) SCC\n“11. In construing a social welfare legislation, the\ncourt should adopt a beneficent rule of construction; and\nif a section is capable of two constructions, that\nconstruction should be preferred which fulfils the policy of\nthe Act, and is more beneficial to the persons in whose\ninterest the Act has been passed. When, however, the\nlanguage is plain and unambiguous, the Court must give\neffect to it whatever may be the consequence, for\n,\nin that\ncase\n, the words of the statute speak the intention of the\nLegislature. When the language is explicit, its\nconsequences are for the Legislature and not for the\ncourts to consider. The argument of inconvenience and\nhardship is a dangerous one and is only admissible in\nconstruction where the meaning of the statute is obscure\nand there are two methods of construction. In their\nanxiety to advance beneficent purpose of legislation, the\ncourts must not yield to the temptation of seeking\nambiguity when there is none.\n\n13. ...The quantum of gratuity payable under\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 4\nof the Act has to be fifteen\ndays' wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the\nemployee concerned for every completed year of service\nor more in excess of six months' subject to the maximum\nof 20 months' wages as provided by sub-section (3)\nthereof. The whole object is to ensure that the employee\nconcerned must be paid gratuity at the rate of fifteen\ndays' wages for 365 days in a year of service. The total\namount of gratuity payable to such employee at that rate\nhas to be multiplied by the number of years of his service\nsubject to the ceiling imposed by sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 4\nof the Act viz. that such amount shall not exceed\n20 months' wages. The construction of sub-section (2) of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.16 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nSection 4\nof the Act adopted by the learned Single Judge\nof the Andhra Pradesh High Court in\nAssociated Cement\nCompany\ncase [(1976) 1 LLJ 222 (AP)] and later approved\nby a Division Bench of that Court in Swamy case [(1978) 52\nFJR 138 (AP)] would make it utterly unworkable. If the\ndetermination of the amount of gratuity payable under\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 4\ndepends on the number of\ncalendar days in a month in which the services of the\nemployee concerned terminates, the quantum of gratuity\npayable would necessarily vary between an employee and\nan employee, belonging to the same class, drawing the\nsame scale of wages, with like service for the same\nnumber of years. Obviously, this could not have been the\nlegislative intention.\n\n14. The next question is: whether a month cannot\nmean 26 working days for purposes of sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 4\nof the Act and 30 days for purposes of sub-\nsection (3) thereof. It is said that if a month under sub-\nsection (2) connotes 26 working days in a month for\npurposes of calculating the amount of gratuity, then the\nrule of harmonious construction requires that the words\n“20 months' wages” in sub-section (3) thereof must mean\nwages for 520 working days taking the actual working days\nin 20 months and not 600 days taking that a month consists\nof 30 days. The contention is wholly misconceived. Sub-\nsections (2) and (3) of\nSection 4\nof the Act are designed to\nachieve two separate and distinct objects and they\noperate at two different stages. While sub-section (2)\nprovides for the mode of calculation of the amount of\ngratuity, sub-section (3) seeks to impose a ceiling on the\namount of gratuity payable at 20 months' wages. It is\nmeant to provide an incentive to employees to serve for\nthe period of 30 years or more. By no rule of construction,\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 4\nof the Act which uses the\nwords “fifteen days' wages” and not half a months wages,\nbe called in aid for construction of the words “20 months'\nwages” appearing in sub-section (3) of\nSection 4\nof the\nAct.” ”\n\n(xi) yet another Apex Court decision in the case of\nBeed District\n\nCentral Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra\n, (2006 (8) SCC\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.17 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n“13. We, however, are of the opinion that the said\ndoctrine cannot be said to have any application\nwhatsoever in the instant case. Undoubtedly, the Payment\nof Gratuity Act is a beneficial statute. When two views are\npossible, having regard to the purpose the Act seeks to\nachieve being a social welfare legislation, it may be\nconstrued in favour of the workman. However, it is also\ntrite that only because a statute is beneficent in nature,\nthe same would not mean that it should be construed in\nfavour of the workmen only although they are not entitled\nto benefits thereof.\n\n(See\nRegional Director, ESI Corpn. v.\nRamanuja Match Industries\n[(1985) 1 SCC 218 : 1985 SCC\n(L&S) 213 : AIR 1985 SC 278] .)\n\n14. Applying the “golden rule of interpretation\nof statute”, to us it appears that the question should be\nconsidered from the point of view of the nature of the\nscheme as also the fact that the parties agreed to the\nterms thereof. When better terms are offered, a workman\ntakes it as a part of the package. He may volunteer\ntherefor, he may not. Sub-section (5) of\nSection 4\nof the\n1972 Act provides for a right in favour of the workman.\nSuch a right may be exercised by the workman concerned.\nHe need not necessarily do it. It is the right of individual\nworkman and not all the workmen. When the expression\n“terms” has been used, ordinarily it must mean “all the\nterms of the contract”. While interpreting even a\nbeneficent statute, like, the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, we\nare of the opinion that either contract has to be given\neffect to or the statute. The provisions of the Act envisage\nfor one scheme. It could not be segregated. Sub-section\n(5) of\nSection 4\nof the 1972 Act does not contemplate that\nthe workman would be at liberty to opt for better terms of\nthe contract, while keeping the option open in respect of a\npart of the statute. While reserving his right to opt for the\nbeneficent provisions of the statute or the agreement, he\nhas to opt for either of them and not the best of the terms\nof the statute as well as those of the contract. He cannot\nhave both. If such an interpretation is given, the spirit of\nthe Act shall be lost. ...”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.18 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n12.

Of course, as rightly pointed\nout by the learned counsel appearing for the employees,\nthe employer can always confer better terms of gratuity\nunder any Award or Agreement. The question is whether\nthe Controlling Authority was right in entertaining the\nApplications filed by the Petitioners herein.\n\n3. The issue is no longer res integra. The\nlearned counsel for the Management has filed number of\ncase laws in his compilation set. One is the case reported\nin 2012 (IV) LLJ 625 (\nVenugopal vs. Joint Commissioner\nof Labour\n), wherein, it was held that the jurisdiction of\nthe controlling authority would be attracted only if there\nis statutory liability to pay the amount of gratuity.

There is Group Gratuity (Cash\nAccumulation) Scheme linked with Life Insurance\nCorporation of India in the Appellant Bank. As per the\nScheme, an employee is entitled to get 15 days wages as\ngratuity for every year of service, subject to a maximum\nof the amount equivalent to 20 months salary. According\nto Appellant Bank, since the gratuity amount was more\nbeneficial to the employees than the Act, in the\nSettlement dated 17.02.1997 under\nSection 12(3)\nof\nIndustrial Disputes Act, in the Settlement dated\n17.02.1997 under\nSection 12(3)\nof Industrial Disputes\nAct, it was agreed to continue the Group Gratuity\nScheme. So the existing practice of payment of Gratuity\nunder Group Gratuity Scheme has been continued as per\nthe Settlement. In the subsequent\nSection 12(3)\n,\nSettlement dated 05.12.2003 also, it has been reiterated\nthat the existing benefit of payment of gratuity as per\nthe Group Gratuity Scheme would continue.\n\n16.\nSection 4(A)\nof Payment of Gratuity Act is\nmandatory in nature, which prescribes that every year\nemployer shall obtain insurance in the manner\nprescribed for his liability for payment towards gratuity\nunder the Act from the Life Insurance Corporation of\nIndia.\nSection 4(A)\nof Payment of Gratuity Act, reads as\nunder:\n\n“4A.

After hearing the arguments of the\ncounsel for the petitioner, we find that there are no\ngrounds to review the impugned judgment. A Review\nApplication is not an appeal in disguise.

Though, according to the employees herein, in terms of clause\n\n30 of the Settlement dated 26.02.1997, one year period is about 14 months'\n\nand not 12 months', the period of 14 months' is taken into account for\n\narriving at a year and thereafter, gratuity demanded for the excess year has\n\nbeen granted by the Controlling Authority, which, according to the learned\n\ncounsel for the Petitioner, is illegal.\n\n15. Learned counsel for the Petitioner-Bank, drawing reference to\n\nthe Apex Court decision in Jeewanlal's case (cited supra), submitted that the\n\nApex Court has considered as to how gratuity has to be payable to an\n\nemployee, based on the number of working days in a month. According to\n\nhim, even assuming for the sake of argument that the calculation arrived at\n\nby the employees in the case on hand, is 14 months' a year, and that, the\n\nnumber of years is more than what the employee had actually served, it\n\ncannot be beyond 20 months, in terms of the linked Insurance Scheme.\n\n16. In reply, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nRespondents/employees herein submitted that, the Petitioner-Bank paid\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.22 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nlesser gratuity to the employees at the time of their retirement, and hence,\n\non the basis of clause 30 of the Settlement, dated 26.02.1997, employees\n\nfiled Petitions before the Controlling Authority under the\nGratuity Act\n, for\n\npayment of the balance gratuity amount.\n\n17. Learned counsel for the Respondents/employees drew the\n\nattention of this Court to clause 30 of the Settlement dated 26.02.1997,\n\nwhich reads as under:\n\n“The present system of linked Insurance\nScheme in collaboration with the Life Insurance\nCorporation of India, will continue. Arrears of\nGratuity, if any, payable to the employees arising\nout of this Settlement, shall be paid by the Bank.\n\nIt is mutually agreed that for the purpose\nof calculation of gratuity, 26 days will be\nreckoned as a month not only for arriving at pay,\nbut also for calculation of length of service. The\nexisting benefit of gratuity without any limitation\nwill be continued.”\n\n18. In view of clause 30 of the Settlement, learned counsel\n\nappearing for the Respondents/employees submitted that, for the purpose of\n\ncalculation of gratuity, 26 days will be reckoned as a month, not only for\n\narriving at pay, but also for calculation of length of service, and that the\n\nexisting benefit of gratuity without any limitation has to be continued.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.23 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n19. It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nRespondents/employees that the Controlling Authority was perfectly justified\n\nin arriving at a different length of service, based on the Settlement and that,\n\nthe\nGratuity Act\nhas to be read in toto, without excluding\nSection 4(5)\nof the\n\nAct, as the said provision deprives the authorities concerned, from trying the\n\nissue with regard to better benefits to the employees.\n\n20. According to the learned counsel for the\n\nRespondents/employees, it is admitted by the Petitioner-Bank that there is a\n\nlinked Insurance Scheme in collaboration with LIC based on which, gratuity is\n\npayable for a period of 20 months, and it is mandatory on the part of the\n\nPetitioner-Bank to pay premium to the Scheme, and pay the gratuity amount\n\nas claimed by the employees.\n\n21. To substantiate his stand, Mr.C.Murugesan, learned counsel\n\nappearing for the employees in both Writ Petitions, has relied on the\n\nfollowing decisions of the Apex Court.\n\n(\ni) Chief Officer vs. State of Gujarat\n, (2008) III LLJ 206\n\n\"16.2 The Delhi High Court in case of\nMunicipal\nCorporation of Delhi v.

The word 'establishment'\nin the\nGratuity Act\nis not controlled by any type of\nestablishment and it will include commercial, public\nsector establishment.' Relevant observations in the\naforesaid decisions are in Para.6 and 7 which are\nquoted as under:\n\n7. ... If the scheme framed by the\nCorporation gives higher benefit to the\nextent the employee obtains benefit under\nthe '\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, to that\nextent those benefits will be adjusted\nwhile claiming benefit under the Scheme of\nRegulations/pensions framed by the\nCorporation. The employee cannot have\ncomplete benefit under both the\nPayment\nof Gratuity Act\nas well as under the\nScheme of regulations/pensions. To the\nextent the benefit has been granted to him\nunder the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, only to\nthat extent the benefit will be adjusted\nwhile enforcing the scheme of\nregulations/pension framed by the\nCorporation. Similarly, if under a Scheme\nframed by the Corporation the benefit is\nless than that which is available in the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, the employee will\nbe entitled to claim difference under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. No other point\nwas argued. The petition, therefore, fails\nand is dismissed. Since nobody has put in\nappearance on behalf of the respondent,\nparties are left to bear their own costs.\"\n\n(\nii) Y.K.Singla vs. Punjab National Bank\n, (2013) 3 SCC 472\n\n\"16. Sub-Section (5) of\nsection 4\nof the Gratuity\nAct permits an employee to be regulated for purpose of\ngratuity, under an alternative provision/arrangement\n(award or agreement or contract), other than\nthe\nGratuity Act\n. In such an eventuality, sub-section (5)\naforesaid, assures the concerned employee, “…to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.25 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nreceive better terms of gratuity under any award or\nagreement or contract with the employer…” Since the\nappellant’s claim for gratuity is regulated, under the\n1995, Regulations, it is evident, that his claim for\ngratuity is liable to be determined by ensuring his right\nto better terms than those contemplated under\nthe\nGratuity Act\n. In the instant process of\nconsideration, the aforesaid conclusion, namely, that\nan employee who receives gratuity under a provision,\nother than the\nGratuity Act\n, would be entitled to better\nterms of gratuity, will constitute one of the\nfoundational basis, of determination. Having\nexamined\nsection 4\nof the Gratuity Act, we may\nunhesitatingly record, that none of the other sub-\nsections of\nsection 4\nof the Gratuity Act, as well as, the\nother provisions of the\nGratuity Act\n, have the effect of\nnegating the conclusion drawn hereinabove.”\n\n(\niii) State of Punjab vs. Labour\nCourt, Jullunder, (1980) 1 SCC 4\n\n\"6. The third contention raised by the appellant\nis that the employee-respondents were not entitled to\napply under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947 for payment of the gratuity, and should have,\nif at all, applied under the provisions of the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n. It is urged that the\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct\nis a self-contained code incorporating all the\nessential provisions relating to payment of gratuity\nwhich can be claimed under that Act, and its provisions\nimpliedly exclude recourse to any other statute for that\npurpose. The contention has force and must be\naccepted. A careful perusal of the relevant provisions\nof the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nshows that Parliament\nhas enacted a closely knit scheme providing for\npayment of gratuity. A controlling authority is\nappointed by the appropriate Government under\n\nSection 3\n, and Parliament has made him responsible for\nthe administration of the entire Act. In what event\ngratuity will become payable and how it will be\nquantified are detailed in\nSection 4\n.\nSection 7(1)\n\nentitles a person eligible for payment of gratuity to\napply in that behalf to the employer. Under\nSection\n7(2)\n, the employer is obliged, as soon as gratuity\nbecomes payable and whether an application has or has\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.26 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nnot been made for payment of gratuity, to determine\nthe amount of gratuity and inform the person to whom\nthe gratuity is payable specifying the amount of\ngratuity so determined. He is obliged, by virtue of the\nsame provision, to inform the controlling authority\nalso, thus ensuring that the controlling authority is\nseized at all times of information in regard to gratuity\nas it becomes payable. ...\n\n9. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to\nnotice the further submission on behalf of the\nappellant that where a serious dispute exists in regard\nto the basis of a claim for payment of gratuity, no\nproceedings will lie under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the\nIndustrial Disputes Act. \"\n\n(\niv) Allahabad Bank vs. All India Allahabad Bank Retired\n\nEmployees Association\n, (2010) 2 SCC 44\n\n“42.\nSection 7\ndeals with procedure for\ndetermination of the amount of gratuity. Every person\nwho is eligible for payment of gratuity under the Act is\nrequired to send a written application to the employer in\nthe prescribed form for payment of such gratuity. Sub-\n\nsection (2) of\nSection 7\nprovides that once the gratuity\nbecomes payable, the employer shall, whether an\napplication has been made or not, determine the amount\nof gratuity and give notice in writing to the person to\nwhom the gratuity is payable and also to the Controlling\nAuthority specifying the amount of gratuity so\ndetermined and arrange to pay the amount of gratuity to\nthe person to whom the gratuity is payable.\n\n43. The scheme envisaged under\nSection 7\nof the\nAct is that in case of any dispute as to the amount of\ngratuity payable to an employee under the Act or as to\nthe admissibility of any claim of, or in relation to, an\nemployee payable to gratuity, etc. the employer is\nrequired to deposit with the Controlling Authority the\nadmitted amount payable as gratuity. In case of any\ndispute the parties may make an application to the\nControlling Authority for deciding the dispute who after\ndue inquiry and after giving the parties to the dispute, a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.27 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nreasonable opportunity of being heard, determine the\nmatter or matters in dispute and if, as a result of such\ninquiry any amount is found to be payable to the\nemployee, the Controlling Authority shall direct the\nemployer to pay such amount to the employee.”\n\n(\nv) Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. vs. Workmen\n, AIR 1970 SC 919\n\n\"35. Determination of gratuity is not based on\nany definite rules. In each case it must depend upon the\nprosperity of the concern, needs of the workmen and the\nprevailing economic conditions, examined in the light of\nthe auxiliary benefits which the workmen may get on\ndetermination of employment. If all over the country in\nthe textile centres payment of gratuity is related to the\nbasic wages and not on consolidated wages, any\ninnovation in the Delhi region is likely to give rise to\nserious industrial disputes in other centres all over the\ncountry. The award if confirmed would not ensure\nindustrial peace: it is likely to foment serious unrest in\nother centres. If maintenance of industrial peace is a\ngoverning principle of industrial adjudication, it would be\nwise to maintain a reasonable degree of uniformity in the\ndiverse units all over the country and not to make a\nfundamental departure from the prevailing pattern. We\nare, therefore, of the view that the Tribunal's award\ngranting gratuity on the basis of consolidated wage cannot\nbe upheld. This modification will not, however, affect the\nexisting benefits which are available under the schemes\nframed by the D.C.M. and S.B.M. insofar as those two\nunits are concerned.\n\n36. Mr Ramamurthi for the workmen also\ncontended that in the matter of relating gratuity to\nwages--consolidated or basic the principle of region-cum-\nindustry should be applied and an “overall view of similar\nand uniform conditions in the industry in different\ncentres” should not be adopted. It was also urged that the\nbasic wage is very low and the class of wage to which\ngratuity was related played a very important part in the\ndetermination of gratuity. The basic wage is however low\nin all the centres and if it does not play an important part\nin other centres, we see no reason why it should play only\nin the Delhi region a decisive part so as to make vital\ndeparture from the scheme in operation in the other\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.28 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\ncentres in the country. We are strongly impressed by the\ncircumstance that acceptance of the award of the\nTribunal in the present case is likely to create conditions\nof great instability all over the country in the textile\nindustry. In that view, we decline to uphold the order of\nthe Tribunal fixing gratuity on the basis of consolidated\nwages inclusive of dearness allowance.\n\n38. A similar view was expressed in\nRemington\nRand of India Ltd.\ncase [(1968) 1 LLJ 542] .\n\nIn\nCalcutta\nInsurance Company Ltd.\ncase [(1967) 11 LLJ 1] however\nprotest was raised against acceptance of this rule without\nqualification.\nMitter, J., observed at p. 9 that it was\ndifficult to concur in principle with the opinion expressed\nin the Garment Cleaning Works case [(1961) 1 LLJ 513] .\nMitter, J., observed:\n\n“We are inclined to think that it\n(gratuity) is paid to a workman to ensure good\nconduct throughout the period he serves the\nemployer. Long and meritorious service, must\nmean long and unbroken period of service\nmeritorious to the end. As the period of\nservice must be unbroken, so must the\ncontinuity of meritorious service be a\ncondition for entitling the workman to\ngratuity. If a workman commits such\nmisconduct as causes financial loss to his\nemployer, the employer would, under the\ngeneral law, have a right of action against the\nemployee for the loss caused, and making a\nprovision for withholding payment of gratuity\nwhere such loss was caused to the employer\ndoes not seem to aid to the harmonious\nemployment of labourers or workmen. Further,\nthe misconduct may be such as to undermine\nthe discipline in the workers — a case in which\nit would be extremely difficult to assess the\nfinancial loss to the employer.”\n\n22. Learned counsel for the Respondents/employees has further\n\nrelied on the following unreported judgments of this Court:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.29 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n(i) The Management of the Coimbatore District Central Co-\n\noperative\nDistrict Central Co-operative Bank Limited vs. Joint\n\nCommissioner of Labour (W.P.Nos.38830\nof 2003, dated 30.03.2010)\n\n“12. ... The fact remains that no mutual\nsettlement was arrived at between the Management and\nthe workmen under\nSection 12(3)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, varying or modifying clause 30 of the\nerstwhile Settlement arrived at between the parties.\n\n13.\nIn this context, it is relevant to refer to\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the\nLife Insurance\nCorporation of India vs. D.J.Bahadur and others\n, AIR\n1980 SC 2181, wherein, it has been held that even\nafter notice under\nSection 9A\nof the Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947, was issued putting the employees on notice,\nthe intention of the Management to terminate a\nparticular clause found in the erstwhile Settlement, the\nSettlement remains operative till the same is replaced\nby a fresh Settlement.”\n\n(ii) a Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of the\n\nManagement of Coimbatore District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. The\n\nJoint Commissioner of Labour, Coimbatore (W.A.Nos.1200 to 1202 of 2010,\n\ndated 29.07.2011)\n\n“7. Admittedly, there was a Settlement under\n\nSection 12(3)\non 26 February, 1997, giving certain\nbenefits to the employees. Though the appellant has\nissued a notice under Section 9-A proposing variation of\nthe said Settlement, the fact remains that there was no\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.30 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nsuch variation and as such, the 12(3) Settlement still\nholds good. Unless and until the said Settlement is\nmodified by another Settlement, the Appellant cannot\ndeny the benefits to the employees. This issue was\nconsidered by the original authority as well as the\nappellate authority, being the fact finding authorities\nand ultimately by the writ Court and answered the issue\nagainst the appellant. Therefore, it is not open to the\nappellant to maintain these appeals on a totally new\nground. We do not find any merit in the contention\nraised by the appellant.”\n\n(iii) The Management, Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative\n\nBank Ltd. vs. The Joint Commissioner of Labour, (W.P.(MD) No.14097 of\n\n2014, dated 06.02.2018)\n\n\"4. In the present case, the third respondent\nclaimed gratuity on the basis of settlement under\nSection\n12(3)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This Court is of\nthe view that the orders impugned in the writ petition\ndeserves to be sustained. The learned counsel appearing\nfor the third respondent drew the attention of this Court\nto the order dated 25.11.2009 passed by this Court in\nWP.Nos.2069 of 2005 and 2364 of 2009. In the said case\nalso, the Court was concerned with the expression ?for\npurposes of calculation of gratuity, 26 days will be\nreckoned as a month not only for arriving at pay, but also\nfor calculation for length of service. It is similar to the\ncase on hand. This Court allowed the writ petition filed by\nthe workman and dismissed the writ petition filed by the\nmanagement. The Management namely, Erode District\nCentral Co-operative Bank filed WA.Nos.1200 & 1221 of\n2010. But, the Hon'ble Division Bench by order dated\n29.10.2013 dismissed the appeals. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt also dismissed the SLPs filed by the Erode District\nCentral Cooperative Bank by order dated 05.05.2014.\n\n5.\nSection 4(5)\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act,\n1972 states that nothing in\nSection 4\nshall affect the right\nof an employee to receive better terms of gratuity under\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.31 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nany award or agreement or contract with the employer. In\nthis case, the settlement entered into between the\nmanagement and the workman provides for better terms.\nThis Court can only observe that the object in\nincorporating such a clause is intended to reward a long\nlength of service. It is clear and categorical that the\nsettlement states that 26 days will be reckoned as a month\nnot only for arriving at pay, but also for calculation for\nlength of service.\n\n6. This expression will have to be understood in its\nplain meaning. By applying the said clause, even though\nthe third respondent has put in only 36 years of service, his\ntotal length of service will be reckoned for the purpose of\ncomputing gratuity as 42 years. It may sound illogical. But,\nthen when such a beneficial consequence flows out of the\nplain meaning of the terms of the Group Gratuity Scheme,\nit is not for this Court to hold otherwise.\"\n\n23. According to the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nRespondents/employees, though the Madurai Bench of this Court in the case\n\nof T.Rajarajan vs. The Appellate Authority, Joint Commissioner of Labour,\n\nTrichy, in W.P.(MD) Nos.5794 of 2018, batch of cases, by an order dated\n\n12.12.2018, has held that the Controlling Authority has no jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate the issue, if the relief is sought under\nSection 4(5)\nof the Gratuity\n\nAct, the very same Court, in a decision rendered in the case of the\n\nManagement, Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs.\n\nThe Joint Commissioner of Labour, Madurai\n, vide order dated 06.02.2018\n\nmade in W.P.(MD) No.14097 of 2014, has categorically held that, as per the\n\n12(3) Settlement, 26 days will be reckoned as a month not only for arriving at\n\npay, but also for calculation of length of service.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.32 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n24. In Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd (cited\n\nsupra), it was observed that, when such a beneficial consequence flows out\n\nof the plain meaning of the terms of the Group Gratuity Scheme, it is not for\n\nthis Court to hold otherwise. In the said case, though the employee had put\n\nin 36 years of service, his total length of service will be reckoned, for the\n\npurpose of computing gratuity as 42 years.\n\n25. In view of the same, learned counsel for the\n\nRespondents/employees submitted that the Controlling Authority has got\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate the issue on hand, and it is open to the Petitioner-\n\nBank to deposit the gratuity amount before the Controlling Authority, in\n\ncases, where no appeal has been filed, provided, it is within 120 days, and\n\nthe employee can canvass the issue before the authority concerned on\n\nmerits, but, not on jurisdiction. Thus, according to the learned counsel, the\n\nWrit Petitions are liable to be dismissed.\n\n26. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\nmaterial documents available on record.\n\n27. Two issues arise for consideration in the case on hand. The\n\nfirst issue is, whether the Controlling Authority has jurisdiction to entertain\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.33 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\na dispute falling under\nSection 4(5)\nof the Gratuity Act and the second issue\n\nis, whether the interpretation given by the Controlling Authority with\n\nregard to the length of service of an employee, for the purpose of\n\ncomputation of gratuity, based on Clause 30 of the Settlement entered into\n\nbetween the parties, is correct.\n\n28. Even though this Court has dictated the order in the open\n\nCourt, dismissing the above Writ Petitions as regards the first issue, and\n\nreferring the matter to the Division Bench with regard to the second issue,\n\nthis Court recalls the same, as this Court has taken a different view on both\n\nthe issues. Any order passed in the open Court is not final before signing, in\n\nthe light of the Apex Court decision rendered in\nKushalbhai Ratanbhai Rohit\n\nand others vs. State of Gujarat\nreported in (2014) 9 SCC 124. Relevant\n\nportion of\nthe said decision\n, as regards recalling a judgment before\n\nsignature, is extracted below:\n\n10.\nIn\nSangam Lal v. Rent Control and Eviction\nOfficer\n[AIR 1966 All 221] , while dealing with the rent\ncontrol matter, the Court came to the conclusion that until\na judgment is signed and sealed after delivering in court, it\nis not a judgment and it can be changed or altered at any\ntime before it is signed and sealed.\n\n11. This Court has also dealt with the issue\nin\nSurendra Singh v. State of U.P.[Surendra Singh\nv. State\nof U.P., AIR 1954 SC 194 : 1954 Cri LJ 475], observing as\nunder: (AIR pp. 196-97, para 12)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.34 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\n“12. Now up to the moment the judgment\nis delivered Judges have the right to change\ntheir mind. There is a sort of ‘locus\npaenitentiae’ and indeed last minute alterations\noften do occur. Therefore, however much a\ndraft judgment may have been signed\nbeforehand, it is nothing but a draft till formally\ndelivered as the judgment of the Court. Only\nthen does it crystallise into a full-fledged\njudgment and become operative. It follows that\nthe Judge who ‘delivers’ the judgment, or\ncauses it to be delivered by a Brother Judge,\nmust be in existence as a member of the Court\nat the moment of delivery so that he can, if\nnecessary, stop delivery and say that he has\nchanged his mind. There is no need for him to\nbe physically present in court but he must be in\nexistence as a member of the Court and be in a\nposition to stop delivery and effect an alteration\nshould there be any last minute change of mind\non his part. If he hands in a draft and signs it\nand indicates that he intends that to be the\nfinal expository of his views it can be assumed\nthat those are still his views at the moment of\ndelivery if he is alive and in a position to change\nhis mind but takes no steps to arrest delivery.\n\nBut one cannot assume that he would not\nhave changed his mind if he is no longer in a\nposition to do so. A Judge's responsibility is\nheavy and when a man's life and liberty hang\nupon his decision nothing can be left to chance\nor doubt or conjecture; also, a question of\npublic policy is involved. As we have indicated,\nit is frequently the practice to send a draft,\nsometimes a signed draft, to a Brother Judge\nwho also heard the case. This may be merely for\nhis information, or for consideration and\ncriticism. The mere signing of the draft does not\nnecessarily indicate a closed mind. We feel it\nwould be against public policy to leave the door\nopen for an investigation whether a draft sent\nby a Judge was intended to embody his final and\nunalterable opinion or was only intended to be a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.35 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\ntentative draft sent with an unwritten\nunderstanding that he is free to change his mind\nshould fresh light dawn upon him before the\ndelivery of judgment.”\n\n29. Admittedly, the private Respondents in the above Writ\n\nPetitions, were employees of the Petitioner-Bank and they received gratuity\n\nat the time of their retirement. It is not in dispute that the private\n\nRespondents herein are employees, as defined under\nSection 2(e)\nof the\n\nGratuity Act.\n\n30. As regards the first issue, it is seen that the purpose of the\n\nenactment of\nGratuity Act, 1972\n, more particularly, in the light of\nSection\n\n4(5)\n, is to ensure that the employees are entitled to better benefits. The\n\nApex Court in\nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), has held that the\n\nControlling Authority cannot deal with any issue under sub-section (5) of\n\nSection 4\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act.\n\n31. This Court has no other option except to follow the dictum\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Supreme Court in\nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), and it is\n\nfor the employees to agitate before the Apex Court, in view of the ratio\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Apex Court in the case of\nGeneral Manager, Telecom vs.\n\nA.Srinivasa Rao\n, reported in (1997) 8 SCC 767, that, judicial discipline\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.36 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nrequires a Bench of lesser strength to follow the judgment of the Larger\n\nBench, unless the same is distinguishable on facts. This Court is bound by the\n\nsaid dictum.\n\n32. In Padma Sundara Rao Vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in\n\n2002 (3) SCC 533, the Apex Court has held that 'Courts should not place\n\nreliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation\n\nfits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed'.\n\nBut, in the case on hand, the legal issue with regard to\nSection 4(5)\nof the\n\nGratuity Act, has been considered and decided, and this Court cannot give a\n\nhelping hand to the employees herein, unless a Larger Bench of the Apex\n\nCourt takes a different view than the one rendered in\nAllahabad Bank\n's case.\n\n33. Thus, in view of the decision rendered by the Apex Court in\n\nAllahabad Bank\n's case (cited supra), this Court has no other option except\n\nto allow the Writ Petitions as regards the first issue, on the principle that\n\nthe remedy lies elsewhere and not before the authority under the\nGratuity\n\nAct\n.\n\n33a. This Court is not inclined to render any finding on the\n\ncontention that this Court can direct the Management to pay its employees\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.37 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nthe gratuity amount, as Co-operative Society is amenable to the Writ\n\njurisdiction of this Court, in view of the 97th amendment to the Constitution\n\nof India. The maintainability of the Writ Petitions by an employee against a\n\nCo-operative Society is left open, as no Writ Petition has been filed by the\n\nemployees before this Court, seeking gratuity.\n\n34. Insofar as the second issue is concerned, the interpretation\n\ngiven by the Madurai Bench of this Court in Virudhunagar District Central\n\nCo-operative Bank Limited (cited supra), as regards the length of service, is\n\ncorrect. It has been categorically held therein that, the total length of\n\nservice will have to be reckoned for the purpose of computing gratuity as 42\n\nyears, for those employees who have completed 36 years of service. But, the\n\nemployee will have to claim the amount before the appropriate forum and\n\nnot before the Controlling Authority, unless the Larger Bench of the Apex\n\nCourt takes a different view to that of the view taken in Allahabad Bank's\n\ncase (cited supra).\n\n35. Normally, no Writ Petition would lie against the order passed by\n\nthe Controlling Authority, as the workman has got an appellate remedy. It is\n\nthe duty cast upon the employer to deposit the amount before the\n\nControlling Authority and file an Appeal, in the light of the decision of this\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.38 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\nCourt rendered in the case of Onward Trading Company vs. Deputy\n\nCommissioner of Labour, Madras, reported in (1989) II LLN 672, which has\n\nbeen confirmed by the Division Bench of this Court, reported in (1989) II LLN\n\n673 (DB), failing which, Appeal will not be entertained. But, in this case, as\n\nthe Controlling Authority and Appellate Authority have no jurisdiction, this\n\nCourt has to entertain the Writ Petitions against the order of the Controlling\n\nAuthority, with regard to the length of service of the employees. The second\n\nissue is answered accordingly.\n\n36. Thus, in the light of the decision rendered by the Madurai\n\nBench of this Court in Virudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank\n\nLimited (cited supra), as regards calculation of length of service and also\n\ntaking into account that the 12(3) Settlement, dated 26.02.1997 has not been\n\nsuperseded, it is open to the employees herein to file a complaint under\n\nSection 29\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, for prosecuting the Officials falling\n\nunder\nSection 32\nof the Act, for violation of Settlement. The authorities shall\n\nalso take into account, the decision rendered by the Apex Court in the case\n\nof\nRaj Kumar Gupta vs. Lieutenant Governor, Delhi\nreported in 1997 (1)\n\nLLJ 994, for sanctioning prosecution, so that the issue is brought to a logical\n\nend. Once this case lands up in the jurisdictional Court, the Court shall\n\nproceed with the matter without adjourning the same beyond 15 working\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nPage No.39 / 42\n\nW.P.Nos.21456 and 23449 of 2013\n\ndays at any point of time, so as to bring the issue to a logical end, on merits,\n\nas the total length of service have to be reckoned as 42 years, for the\n\npurpose of determination of gratuity, and that, there is violation of 12(3)\n\nSettlement, as mentioned supra.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, both Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs.\n\nConsequently, connected M.P.Nos.1 and 1 of 2013 in both Writ Petitions are\n\nclosed.\n\n25.07.2019\nIndex : Yes\nSpeaking Order : Yes\n(aeb)\n\nNote to Registry: Issue copy of this order on or before 25.10.2019.\n\nTo:\n\n1.
