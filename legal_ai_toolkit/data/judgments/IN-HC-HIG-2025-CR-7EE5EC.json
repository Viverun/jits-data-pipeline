The Brief Facts:\n\n2. The case of the prosecution is that between 2013 and 2016, all the\n\naccused conspired to cheat the Indian Overseas Bank. They applied for and\n\nreceived a Rs.30 Crores term loan by making false representations to the\n\nBank, leading it to believe that the 1st accused, M/s Truedome EPC India Pvt.\n\nLtd., was engaged in genuine wind energy projects. As a result, the loan was\n\napproved on 28.03.2013, and the amount was disbursed on 30.03.2013 into\n\nthe loan account No. 0060 0327 1300 007 of the 1st accused company.\n\n2.1. On the same day, the 4th accused, representing the 1st accused,\n\nsubmitted a letter to the Chief Manager of Indian Overseas Bank, requesting\n\n4/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nthe transfer of funds to three different firms: M/s Ecodome Power Pvt. Ltd.,\n\nM/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., and M/s Sri Balaji Traders, amounting\n\nto Rs.13.5 Crores, Rs.12.5 Crores, and Rs.4 Crores respectively. Accordingly,\n\nthe funds were transferred to these entities. The Director of M/s Ecodome\n\nPower Pvt. Ltd. is the 4th accused, and another Director, Mr. Arun Nehru, is\n\nthe elder brother's son of the 6th accused, N. Ravichandran, who is the\n\nManaging Director of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. The company M/s\n\nEcodome Power Pvt. Ltd. did not conduct any business or utilize the funds in\n\nrelation to the wind turbine generator project with M/s Trishe Renewable\n\nEnergy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. However, the entire amount was transferred to the\n\naccount of the 7th accused, M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd.\n\n2.2. Similarly, M/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., in whose favour\n\nRs.12.5 Crores was transferred, did not have any proper business and\n\ntransferred this amount to the account of the 7th accused - M/s True Value\n\nHomes Pvt. Ltd. M/s Sri Balaji Traders also transferred Rs.2 Crores into the\n\naccounts of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. and another Rs.2 Crores to M/s\n\nTVH Energy Resources Pvt. Ltd. The majority of the funds pooled into the\n\naccount of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. was used on the same day, i.e.,\n\n5/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n30.03.2013, to settle its term loan with M/s Punjab National Bank.\n\nAdditionally, Rs.28.08 Crores, out of the loan amount sanctioned by Indian\n\nOverseas Bank, was used for this purpose.\n\n2.3. Thereafter, even though the original sanction terms were amended\n\nand the initial holiday period of one year was extended to two years, in 2016,\n\nthe loan account became a Non-Performing Asset. Subsequently, by a\n\ncommunication dated 18.11.2019, the 1st accused – Company was required to\n\npay Rs. 31.5 Crores as a one-time settlement. The settlement amount was to be\n\npaid in two installments: Rs. 21.50 Crores on or before 15.12.2019 and Rs. 10\n\nCrores on or before 15.01.2020. The One Time Settlement sanction letter was\n\nissued on 29.11.2019. The 1st accused did not adhere to this, and\n\nconsequently, after receiving another request letter from the 2nd accused – T.\n\nElayaraja, the bank issued a revised OTS proposal for a full and final\n\nsettlement of Rs. 33.42 Crores, including the delayed period interest of Rs.\n\n1.91 Crores, to be paid on or before 30.09.2021. After obtaining an extension,\n\na sum of Rs. 8.34 Crores of the OTS amount was paid on time, but the\n\nremaining amounts were not paid within the stipulated period.\n\n6/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n2.4. At this juncture, a complaint was forwarded by the Bank on\n\n24.12.2021, based on which a case was registered in R.C.No.032/2021 A 0022\n\nfor alleged offences under Section 420, and 120B read with\nSection 420\nof\n\nIPC. During the investigation of the complaint, the Indian Overseas Bank\n\nagreed to accept a further delayed period interest of Rs.2,67,68,876.75/- over\n\nand above the amount already due, and the 1st accused paid the sum of\n\nRs.25.08 Crores on 11.05.2022. Thereafter, the Indian Overseas Bank\n\ncalculated an additional Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, which was\n\npaid and accepted as full and final settlement on 23.02.2023, and a no-\n\nobjection certificate was issued by the Bank stating that the loan account was\n\nentirely cleared. It is at this stage, on 22.08.2024, that the present final report\n\nwas laid and taken on file as C.C.N.2358 of 2024 before the Additional Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Chennai, and summons were issued to the accused.\n\nAll the accused except the accused No. 5 are before this Court.\n\nC.The Submissions:\n\n3. Heard M r . V i j a y a Na r a y a n , Mr.Sankaran ar ay an an, and M r . O m\n\nPr ak a s h , the learned Senior Counsel, who argued the matter in detail. Since\n\ntheir arguments overlap, they are summarized point wise.\n\n7/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n3.1. First, they would submit that on a perusal of the transactions and\n\neven as per the final report, except\nSection 120-B\nIPC for which no specific\n\nmaterial was placed on record, the only other offence being under\nSection 420\n\nof IPC, is compoundable in nature. The alleged transactions does not make out\n\nan offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC, in as much as for a term loan of Rs.30\n\nCrores, a property ad-measuring 53,540 sq.ft in Old No.15 & 16, New Door\n\nNo.55 at Dr.Muthulakshmi Salai, also known as Lattice Bridge Road, Adyar,\n\nChennai – 600 020 was given as security by the guarantor, viz., M/s Vicoans\n\nInfrastructure and Environment Engineering Pvt. Ltd., which is the owner of\n\nthe property and the accepted valuation report of the valuers approved by the\n\nbankers, estimated the fair market value of the property as Rs.128.30 Crores,\n\neven as on 23.03.2013. A mortgage deed was duly executed. Therefore, in this\n\ncase, it can never be argued by the prosecution that there was an intention to\n\ncheat the bank, at the inception. Like every other default loan account, after\n\nthe loan was serviced for some time, thereupon, it became a Non Performing\n\nAsset and the proceedings were pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal.\n\n8/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n3.2. In the year 2019, an OTS proposal has been granted and had the\n\nCompany paid the OTS within the first deadline itself, even the compliant\n\nwould not have emanated from the Bank. Even after extension of time, the 1 st\n\naccused – Company was able to make only a part payment, the complaint\n\nemanated from the Bank. But once the Bank extended the time and the entire\n\nOTS amount was settled amicably, which included the belated payment of\n\ninterest, absolutely no offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC ever made out and\n\ntherefore, the transactions firstly are completely civil in nature. Criminal\n\ncolour was sought to be given by mentioning the purpose for which the loan\n\nwas sought and the purpose of which the loan was used. Even then, it is the\n\ncontention of the learned Senior Counsel that the loan itself was granted under\n\nthe insta fund scheme, which is based more on the security rather than the\n\npurpose of business.\n\n3.3. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that the further\n\ninvestigation does not reveal that the Company had never entered into any\n\nagreement with the concerned entities, nor does it suggest that the Company\n\nwas not engaged in the business of wind energy. The only allegation, which\n\n9/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nhas been raised belatedly, appears to be that the part payment under the One-\n\nTime Settlement (OTS) was not made, and that the funds were allegedly\n\ndiverted to the group concern, namely, the 7 accused. Thus, the action, though\nth\n\npotentially questionable as 'fraud' within the meaning of the circular issued by\n\nthe Reserve Bank of India for the purpose of classifying the account as\n\nfraudulent, does not, by itself, constitute a criminal offence, as fraud under\n\nsuch circulars is not synonymous with cheating as defined under criminal law.\n\nThus, either at the inception of the transaction or when the transactions\n\nconcluded by a memorandum of understanding by way of OTS finally, by\n\npaying the interest on belated payment, no offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC\n\nwas made out and therefore, the complaint is liable to be quashed.\n\n3.4. The learned Senior Counsel would further submit that when the\n\nbank has received the amount towards full and final settlement and the matter\n\namicably settled between the parties and the bank is not claiming any further\n\namount due, by the dicta of the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in this regard, this Court should exercise the power under\nSection 482\nof\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the case, as the proceedings are\n\npredominantly civil in nature, and considering the commercial wisdom, the\n\nbank has settled the transactions and it would be oppressive on the accused to\n\n10/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\ncontinue the prosecution. In any event, when the cause of action itself has\n\narisen on account of the part non-payment of the OTS amount, the same\n\nsubsequently being paid and the bank accepting the same as full quit by\n\nadding another Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, the possibility of\n\nfurther prosecution is very bleak, and therefore, on that score also, the case is\n\nliable to be quashed.\n\n3.5.\nIn support of their submissions for the proposition that the\n\nclassification of the fraudulent account is violative of principles of natural\n\njustice, and the consequential FIR should be quashed, the Judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nState Bank of India and Others Vs.\n\nRajesh Agarwal and Others1\n, is relied upon. To contend that the ingredients\n\nof\nSection 420\nof IPC are not made out in the instant case, the following four\n\nJudgments are relied upon:\n\nSl. Citation Case Name\nNo.\n1. (2021) 18 SCC 70 N.Radhavender Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh,\nCBI\n2. (2024) SCCOnLine SC 339 A.M.Mohan Vs. State represented by SHO &\nAnr.\n3.\n(\n2024) SCCOnLine SC 726 Sharif Ahmed & Anr. Vs.

Citation Case Name\nNo.\n3.6. For the proposition that in view of the amicable settlement of the\n\nloan amount, this Court should exercise the power under\nSection 482\nof the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings, the following\n\nJudgments were relied upon:\n\nSl. Citation Case Name\nNo.\n1.\n(\n2014) 5 SCC 364 CBI Vs. Narendra Lal Jain & Ors\n.\n\n2. (\n2024) SCCOnLine SC 2696 Tarina Sen Vs. Union of India & Anr\n.\n\n3. (\n2024) SCCOnLine Del Lalit Kishore & Ors. Vs. CBI & Anr\n.\n4. (2025) SCCOnLine SC 788 Suresh V. Singal & Ors Vs. State of Gujarat &\nOrs.\n\n5. (\n2025) SCCOnLine SC 1257 N.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police &\nAnr\n.\n\n3.7. Per contr a, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on\n\nbehalf of the 1 respondent - CBI would submit that the proposition that once\nst\n\nthe loan amount is subsequently settled, this Court should quash the case is\n\nincorrect in law. Even though in some individual cases the proceedings are\n\nquashed, the law\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Gian\n\n12/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nSingh's case (cited supra) and in other Judgments have been followed till\n\ndate. Therefore, if the transactions are such amounting to grave fraud,\n\nespecially in financial matters, when the loan amount is as large as Rs.30\n\nCrores in the instant case, the Court should not interfere with the matter.\n\n3.8. In the instant case, the facts are alarming. After representing to the\n\nbank that they are going to conduct a business relating to wind energy, on the\n\nsame day, within hours, the entire loan amount has been siphoned off to other\n\nshell entities and ultimately transferred to the 7 accused, for the purpose of\nth\n\nrepayment of loan to another bank. The said conduct has to be taken into\n\naccount by this Court. Further, the loan was not repaid, thus the account\n\nbecame NPA. When a false representation is made, inducing the bank to part\n\naway with a loan amount of Rs.30 Crores and subsequently when the accused\n\ndid not repay the same and cheated, the offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC was\n\nmade out, and merely because subsequently the amount has been repaid will\n\nnot undo the offence and considering the nature of transactions, this is not a fit\n\ncase for interference by this Court.\n\n3.9. In this case, on a perusal of the memorandum of understanding\n\nentered into at the time of OTS, it can be seen that the bank has specifically\n\n13/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nstated that the existing criminal cases will continue and therefore, there is no\n\nquestion of quashing this case on compromise. In support of his submissions,\n\nthe learned Special Public Prosecutor would rely upon the following\n\nJudgments:\n\nSl. Citation Case Name\nNo.\n1.\n(\n2013) 10 SCC 686 Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Jagjit Singh\n\n2.\n\n(2014) 15 SCC 29 State of Maharashtra through\nCBI Vs. Vikram\nAnantrai Doshi & Ors.\n\n3.\n\n(\n2016) 1 SCC 389 Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Maninder\nSingh\n\n4.\n(2016) 1 SCC 376 State of Tamil Nadu Vs. R.Vasanthi Stanley &\nAnr.\n\n5.

Vs.\nDeputy Superintendent of Police and Ors.\n\n3.10. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would also rely upon the\n\nJudgment in\nKothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI2\nto contend that\n\neven if the case is to be quashed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had\n\nimposed appropriate costs, so as to cover the possible expenses.\n\n3.11. M s . V . R a j e s w a r i , the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\n\nrespondent – Bank, at the outset would submit that it is true that pursuant to\n\n2 (2022) SCC Online SC 2078\n\n14/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nthe OTS the entire amount was settled and that no further amount is claimed\n\nby the Bank. However, while entering into the OTS amount, since the bank\n\nhad to forego a portion of the notional amount due, even though the Bank had\n\nrealised the book amount due and the belated payment interest, the Bank had\n\nnot expressly undertaken to withdraw the criminal complaint, and therefore,\n\nthough there is a settlement of the account with reference to the loan\n\ntransaction, there is no express clause for compromise regarding the criminal\n\ncase. The Bank thus takes a position to that extent.\n\n3.12. Mr.N.Ramesh, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Enforcement Directorate would submit that the Enforcement\n\nDirectorate has also registered an ECIR under the\nMoney Laundering Act,\n, based on the present predicate offences and would take the same stand\n\nas the CBI.\n\n4. I have considered the rival submissions made on either side and\n\nperused the material records of the case.\n\nD.The Questions:\n\n5. The following questions arise for consideration in the instant case:-\n\n15/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n(i) Whether the final report filed in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be\n\nquashed as no offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC is ever made out ?\n\n(ii) Whether the final report in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be\n\nquashed on account of the fact that subsequently the entire loan amount was\n\nsettled through OTS scheme with the Bank ?\n\nE.Question No.(i):\n\n6. On a plain reading of\nSection 420\nof IPC and the Judgments that are\n\nrelied upon, which are cited supra on the propositions it would be clear that,\n\n(a) the primary ingredient is that there must be a deception of a person.\n\n(b) The person should have been fraudulently or dishonestly induced to\n\ndeliver any property belonging to him.\n\n(c) The same should have been done with an intention to cheat that a\n\nperson, at the time of inducement itself.\n\n6.1. In this case, the letter dated 11.03.2013 of the 1 st accused is stated\n\nto be the application for sanction of the loan of Rs.30 Crores. It is a three-page\n\ncommunication. It first details about the 1st accused – Company and its\n\nDirectors. Thereafter, it details about the business that it is engaged in,\n\n16/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nwindmill, turbines and towers. Further, it details about the project executed by\n\nthe company with an organization, viz., M/s. Liatenat Sriram. It further states\n\nthat they have availed credit facilities from Indian Bank for the 49.50 MW\n\nproject being a overdraft facility of Rs.26.80 Crores, by offering collateral\n\nsecurity with a market value of Rs.44.73 Crores. Though, the project is\n\ncompleted by making investments and the other approvals were also in place,\n\nthere was a problem with reference to the grid connectivity by the Tamil Nadu\n\nElectricity Board, as otherwise, they would have earned a profit of more than\n\nRs.30 Crores. But the profit is restricted to only Rs.1.15 Crores in the said\n\nproject. They have also completed another 30 MW project.\n\n6.2. It is further stated that they have now bagged two more contracts\n\nworth about Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions\n\nPvt. Ltd. for setting up 100.80 MW project at Moolanur in Tiruppur District.\n\nThey have already infused a sum of Rs.13.67 Crores to execute the said works\n\nand for servicing the overall facility with Indian Overseas Bank.

The profits earned on these\ncontracts were retained in the business and are used to service the\nexisting loan and a part of the profit was utilized for executing the\n49.50 MW of Shriram Lietner contract. The promoters have\nbagged a further two contracts worth Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s\nTrishe Renewable Energy Solutions Private Limited for setting up\n100.80 MW comprising of 48 nos. at Moolanoor, Tirupur\nDistrict.\n\nThe promoters have already infused Rs.13.67 Crores to\nexecute the works and for servicing the facility with Indian Bank.\nAs explained they have bagged the referred two contracts, which\nshall infuse some cashflow to the system. Further the present\nlimit is sought for execution of the two fresh contracts. In the past\nfor executing the 30 MW contracts (2 nos), all the transactions\nwere routed through the current account maintained with Indian\nOverseas Bank, which goes to speak about our efficiency of\nexecuting the contract.\n\nAs our growth in business and prospects look very bright,\nwe need to go in for bank support to augment our working capital\nposition.\n\nWe enclose our Balance sheet as also financial\nprojections. We request you to sanction us a MCC limit of Rs.30\nCrores to meet the mismatch in our cash flows.

Though it can be seen from the above that there was no categorical\n\nstatement as if they were going to use the funds only to the transactions with\n\nM/s Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions Pvt.

But the entire amount was transferred to\n\ntheir three group Concerns, within hours, who in-turn again, transferred\n\nalmost the entire amount, to 7th accused, for the purpose of repaying the loan.\n\nFrom the materials, it is clear that a false representation was made to the Bank,\n\nwith reference to the purpose for which the funds will be used. Therefore,\n\nthere is a deception.\n\n6.4. It can be contended on behalf of the Bank that only on the\n\nrepresentation that the 1st accused will utilise the funds for its own purposes,\n\nthe loan amount was parted. It is true that a security of almost four times of\n\nthe loan amount was given and a mortgage deed was also executed. But at the\n\nsame time, it has to be seen that after making a representation and taking away\n\nthe money, the loan amount was not repaid in time. The Bank took action\n\nunder the\nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\n\nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002\n(\"\nSARFAESI Act\n\") to auction the\n\nsecured asset, but it is stated before this Court that in spite of five attempts, the\n\nproperty could not be sold, as there were no bidders. It is stated that on\n\naccount of the same, an OTS settlement was entered into considering the\n\ncommercial prudence.

Even after the second extension of time, only the\n\npart-payment of Rs.8.34 Crores was made and the major amount remained\n\nunpaid and once the deception was made and the amounts were parted and the\n\nsame was not paid and the security not being sold; the OTS amount has not\n\nbeen realized; on the day of forwarding the complaint, the Bank was at a loss.\n\nTherefore, the offence under\nSection 420\nof IPC was prima facie made out.\n\n6.5. The contention on behalf of the accused that there was no other\n\nimpediment to the sale of the secured asset, and regarding the circumstances\n\nunder which the mortgaged property was not sold, and whether the Bank had\n\nactually reduced the upset price of the property in accordance with the rules if\n\nthere were no bidders, are to be further examined. It is also submitted that\n\nthere was a dispute regarding the portion of the property. On the face of it, the\n\noffence under\nSection 420\nof IPC is made out, and to contend that no offence\n\nis made out would require an exercise of appreciating and further evaluating\n\nthe evidence that would come on record, including the defence version;\n\ntherefore, this question is answered in favour of the prosecution and against\n\nthe petitioners. It cannot be said that there are not materials at all to proceed\n\nfor the offences under Section 120-B read with 420 of\nIPC\nand Section 420\n/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nIPC\n.\n\nF.Question No.(ii)\n\n7.

Vs.

Thus, from the detailed analysis of numerous decisions, it is evident\n\n32/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nthat the law regarding the quashing of criminal cases involving non-\n\ncompoundable offences, where parties allege settlement, has been clearly laid\n\ndown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nGian Singh\n's case (cited\n\nsupra). It is essential to refer to paragraph Nos. 58 and 61 of that judgment:\n\n“58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding\nhaving regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender\nand the victim has been settled although the offences are not\ncompoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of\ncriminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in\nthe case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an\nend and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the\nultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\nharmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that\nseriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society\nand it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the\nvictim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has\nbeen paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made\ncompoundable in law, with or without the permission of the\ncourt. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc., or other offences of mental depravity under\nIPC\nor offences\nof moral turpitude under special statutes, like the\nPrevention of\nCorruption Act\nor the offences committed by public servants\nwhile working in that capacity, the settlement between the\noffender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all.\nHowever, certain offences which overwhelmingly and\npredominantly bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,\nmercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like\ntransactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly\nrelating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is\nbasically to the victim and the offender and the victim have\nsettled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the\nfact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the\nHigh Court may within the framework of its inherent power,\nquash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it\nis satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any\nlikelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing\nthe criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of\njustice shall be defeated. The above list is illustrative and not\nexhaustive. Each case will depend on its own facts and no hard-\n\n33/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nand-fast category can be prescribed.\n\n......\n\n......\n\n61. The position that emerges from the above discussion\ncan be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise\nof its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a criminal court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude\nwith no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the\nends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\ncourt. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\ncomplaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the\nvictim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.\n\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the High Court must\nhave due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous\nand serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\nrape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender have settled the\ndispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a\nserious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between\nthe victim and the offender in relation to the offences under\nspecial statutes like the\nPrevention of Corruption Act\nor the\noffences committed by public servants while working in that\ncapacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal\nproceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases\nhaving overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand\non a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly\nthe offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\npartnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\nthe wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties\nhave resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the\nHigh Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\nthe possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation\nof the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression\nand prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by\nnot quashing the criminal case despite full and complete\nsettlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the\nHigh Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary\nto the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding\n\n34/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nor continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to\nabuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise\nbetween the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the\nends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an\nend and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the\naffirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n7.3. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the High Court will be\n\nwell within its jurisdiction to quash the proceedings on compromise, if the\n\noffence is predominantly civil in nature, private in nature, completely settled\n\nbetween the parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the\n\nproceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would be oppressive\n\non the accused to be continued, even after settlement. The power is to be\n\nexercised with a great amount of prudence and responsibility, to secure the\n\nends of justice.\n\n7.4. However, the question regarding the instances of various frauds\n\ncommitted by parties concerning banking transactions, obtaining loans, and\n\ndefaulting on and subsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with\n\nthe bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\ncases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were quashed, while in others,\n\nthey were not. But a proper and combined reading of all the judgments cited\n\nabove related to this subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion\n\n35/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nreached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the particular offence,\n\nsuch as 468, 471 of\nIPC\n, or offences under Section 120 B read with 420 of\n\nIPC\nwhich is paramount. Instead, it is the nature of the allegations that the\n\nCourt must examine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each case,\n\none has to determine whether the case involves a purely commercial or private\n\ntransaction between the bank and the borrower, or if it has broader\n\nimplications affecting society or the financial system as a whole.\n\n7.5. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances must be\n\nexamined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the case is primarily\n\ncommercial or civil in nature and that the criminal aspects are not of utmost\n\ndepravity and seriousness, which could have a likely impact on society as a\n\nwhole or the country's financial system. The second step involves assessing\n\nwhether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank has any\n\nremaining claims. If the case has reached a complete and final settlement and\n\nthe bank has no pending claims, then the Court moves to the third step to\n\nevaluate whether continuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed\n\nin prosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider whether\n\ncontinuing the proceedings would be unfair, oppressive, or constitute an abuse\n\n36/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nof the legal process, considering the nature of the settlement or compromise,\n\nthe circumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the accused, the time\n\nelapsed, and the stage at which quashing is requested. In the interest of justice,\n\nthe Court may, in fit cases, decide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate\n\ncases, costs can also be imposed.\n\nG.The consideration and findings:\n\n8. Now, addressing the facts of this case, the following are relevant for\n\nconsideration:\n\n(i) The loan amount was Rs. 30 Crores, which was quite a high amount\n\nin 2013 when the borrowing took place.\n\n(ii) Before the default in payment, the primary wrongful act of the\n\naccused was that when they needed funds to immediately repay a loan taken\n\nby the seventh accused company from Punjab National Bank, they dishonestly\n\nobtained a loan in the name of the first accused company, falsely claiming it\n\nwas for working capital. They used the money to repay the loan on the same\n\nday, routing it through three entities controlled by them, which had no actual\n\nbusiness.\n\n(iii) The loan was granted without adhering to certain norms. After\n\ndisbursal, no inspection was carried out to verify the purpose for which the\n\n37/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nfunds were used, even though the bank officials transferred the funds in three\n\ntranches within hours of disbursement, leading to the loan being repaid to\n\nanother bank. Following a default, an original application was filed for\n\nrecovery of the amount due, and SARFAESI action was initiated. Although\n\nthe secured asset is a property in a prime location in Chennai, it is stated that\n\nthere were no bidders five times due to a dispute over a minor part of the\n\nproperty. It is unclear if the upset price was lowered for subsequent auctions.\n\nWhen a one-time settlement was offered despite the default, the bank did not\n\ntreat the offer as withdrawn, unlike in other cases, but granted two extensions\n\nafter payment of revised amounts. Despite the valuable security, a One-Time\n\nSettlement (OTS) was approved due to an expected delay of about a year in\n\nrecovering the amount through auction. From the collected materials, it\n\nappears that Regional Office officials (LW-2 & 3) blame the Branch Managers\n\nfor norm violations during the loan approval, while the Branch Official (LW-\n\n21) claims that the Regional Office handled the entire process because of the\n\nhigh value of the application.\n\n(iv) There is no evidence that the petitioners conspired with or paid any\n\nquid pro quo to any of the bank's officials, and the bank did not file any\n\ncomplaint against its officers. Nor did the CBI uncover any evidence against\n\n38/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\npublic servants; only the companies and their directors are prosecuted for\n\noffences under Section 120(B) read with 420 and 420 of\nIPC\n, with the only\n\nnon-compoundable offence being 120(B)of\nIPC\n.\n\n(v) The matter was amicably resolved between the parties through the\n\nmemorandum of settlement, and the relevant portions read as follows:\n\n“9. A n y Suit/ C l a i m/ C o m p l a i n t filed by the\nB o r r o w e r s/ G u a r a n t o r s again st the Ba n k sho ul d be withd r a w n\nbefo r e rele a s e of the secu r iti e s.\n\n10. This co m p r o m i s e settle m e n t will not have any beari n g\nwhat s o e v e r on the ong o i n g crim i n a l case s/pr o c e e d i n g s , if any\npen di n g the court s again st the B o r r o w e r/ G u a r a n t o r s .\n\n11. Br a n c h sho ul d ensu r e that all the secu r itie s are insur e d\nfor full value till the full realis ati o n of the O T S am o u n t.\n\n12. This settle m e n t will not affect our Ba n k ’ s right and\noblig a ti o n to shar e any infor m a t i o n in the cou r s e of any crim i n a l\npro c e e d i n g s (if any), or to provi d e con s e n t for crim i n a l\npro c e e d i n g s in case so dire ct e d by any statut o r y auth o r it y. ”\n\nThus, it can be observed that a cumulative reading of the above, along with\n\nother clauses in the memorandum of settlement, indicates there will be no\n\nfurther complaints; however, if any ongoing prosecution exists, it will not be\n\nwithdrawn. Clearly, it can be seen that the bankers, although able to settle the\n\nmatter amicably, cannot withdraw the complaint or promise to do so, since the\n\noffences are non-compoundable; hence, such clauses are included. But at that\n\ntime, no prosecution was pending. Time was extended, and the amount was\n\nrevised on the same terms. However, before the final amount was paid, the\n\n39/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\nBank filed the complaint in view of the default in payment within the time\n\nextended.\n\n(vi) Before this Court, the bank is not outrightly admitting that the issue\n\nhas been compromised with reference to the criminal case. It states that it had\n\nto forgo a portion of its notional outstanding when it settled the issue with the\n\npetitioners. It is observed that the original borrowal as on 28/03/2013 was 30\n\ncrores. When the account became NPA on 30/06/2016, the outstanding,\n\nincluding interest and penal interest, was Rs. 27,12,79,620/-. On 27/12/2018,\n\nthe DRT-II passed a decree for Rs . 37,96,49,463/-. The original OTS was\n\nsanctioned for Rs. 31.50 crores. Since it was not paid in time, the OTS was\n\naccepted again with delayed period interest. It is stated that the Book\n\noutstanding as on 31/12/2020 is Rs. 24,98,39,153/-. Against the Notional\n\nDues up to Rs. 31/03/2021, amounting to Rs. 38,88,89,946/-, the OTS was\n\naccepted at Rs. 33,41,58,904/-. After this offer, Rs. 8.34 crores was paid in\n\ntime, but the remaining balance was not paid, leading to the lodging of this\n\nFirst Information report. The balance was paid on 11/05/2022, including\n\nfurther delayed interest of Rs. 37 Lakhs, which the bank accepted, and a NOC\n\nwas issued on 23/02/2023. Subsequently, on 22/08/2024, the instant final\n\nreport was filed.\n\n40/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n(vii) The bank agrees that no additional amount is due and payable on\n\nbehalf of the petitioners/accused and NOC has already been issued.\n\n(viii) In the absence of any other material, the complaint itself was\n\ntriggered only due to partial payment and non-payment of the balance amount\n\naccepted during one-time settlement, and as such, it would be a challenge for\n\nthe prosecution to prove the intention to cause loss to the bank, especially at\n\nthe inception of the transaction.\n\n8.1. Thus, after weighing all the facts, the balance would tilt in favour\n\nof accepting the petitioners' prayer by quashing the case based on an amicable\n\nsettlement of the dues to the bank. The enforcement directorate also did not\n\nrecord any other allegations, and the learned counsel adopted only the\n\nobjections raised by the prosecution. Since the entire loan amount was used to\n\nrepay the loan of the group company to another bank on the same day, and it is\n\nclear that bank officials were aware of this from the start, with another bank\n\nrealising the amount due, this tilts the case more towards a commercial\n\nconsideration and does not demonstrate a serious offence against society.\n\n8.2. At the same time, considering the amount involved and the time\n\n41/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\nCrl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\ntaken for the petitioners to settle the amount, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India i n\nKothari Polymers\n' case (cited supra), I am of the view that a\n\nsum of Rs.30 Lakhs be imposed as costs on the petitioners, of which\n\nRs.15 Lakhs be paid to the Central Bureau of Investigation towards\n\ninvestigation and prosecution costs, and Rs.15 Lakhs be paid towards the costs\n\nof the Court.
