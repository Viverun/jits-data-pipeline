JUSTICE BADAR DURREZ AHMED\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K.JAIN\n\nV.K. JAIN, J.\n\n1. This writ petition is directed against the order dated 08.03.1999 passed by\n\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as \"the Tribunal), whereby O.A. No. 2980/1997 filed by the private\n\nrespondents was allowed. The facts giving rise to filing of the writ petition can be\n\nsummarized as under:-\n\n The petitioner as well as the private respondents are Group „C‟ Inspectors in\n\nCentral Excise and Customs. The next promotional post for the Inspectors in\n\nCentral Excise and Customs is Superintendent (Group „B‟) which is a Gazetted\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 1 of 32\n\n post. The recruitment rules for the post of Superintendent in Central Excise and\n\nCustoms provide for 95% of the posts to be filled by promotion from the feeder\n\ngrade of Inspectors and remaining 5% are to be filled up by direct recruitment.\n\nInspectors with eight years of regular service in the grade are eligible to be\n\nconsidered for promotion, on the basis of selection. Reservations for the SC/ST\n\nofficers are available in the promotional posts, as per the policy of the Government\n\nof India on reservations. The Departmental Promotion Committee, for making\n\nrecommendations for promotion to the posts of Superintendent, met on\n\n23/24.06.1997 and recommended promotion of 160 Inspectors to the post of\n\nSuperintendent Grade „B‟. The select list included 29 Scheduled Castes and 12\n\nScheduled Tribes officers. Respondent No.3 issued orders dated 30.09.1997,\n\npromoting 134 Inspectors, including 23 Scheduled Castes and 9 Scheduled Tribes\n\nofficers to the grade of Superintendent, besides regularizing five ad-hoc\n\npromotions. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes officers were adjusted\n\nagainst the reserved posts in the cadre of the Superintendent. The plea taken by the\n\napplicants before the Tribunal was that since these SC/ST officers had been\n\npromoted/appointed on the basis of their merit and seniority and not on the basis of\n\nreservation, they should be adjusted against the general posts in terms of the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in \nR.K.Sabharwal & Others vs. State of Punjab &\n\nOthers\n : 1995 (1) SLR SC 791. Their contention was that had these SC/ST\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 2 of 32\n\n officers been adjusted against general posts, they (applicants before the Tribunal)\n\nwould have been appointed against the reserved posts, they being SC/ST\n\ncandidates. In support of their contention, the applicants before the Tribunal also\n\nplaced reliance on OM dated 02.07.1997 issued by DoPT. The plea taken by the\n\nrespondents before the Tribunal was that SC/ST candidates appointed on their own\n\nmerit are to be adjusted against general category posts only in case of direct\n\nappointment and not in the case of promotions. They also contended that some of\n\nthe reserved category officers had obtained benefit of reservation at the time of\n\nconfirmation in the grade of Inspectors and consequently had become senior in the\n\ngrade, thereby taking advantage of being from reserved categories. The plea taken\n\nby them was that having taken benefit of early confirmation and thereby gaining\n\nseniority over general category officers, they are not entitled to be adjusted against\n\ngeneral category posts in the promotional cadre of Superintendent („B‟ Grade).\n\n2. The Tribunal vide impugned order 08.03.1999 allowed the OA and set aside\n\nthe order dated 30.09.1997 to the extent of promotions granted to respondents 5 to\n\n13 in violation of „law on reservations‟. The official respondents were directed to\n\nadjust 23 Scheduled Castes and 9 Scheduled Tribes Officers against general\n\ncategory posts and thereafter determine the number of reserved posts, which were\n\nto be filled-up by SC/ST Officers as per rules of reservations and make\n\nappointments in terms of rules and regulations on the subject. They were also\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 3 of 32\n\n directed to consider those of the applicants and other eligible SC/ST officers, who\n\nwere in the zone of consideration for promotion against reserved posts for\n\nappointment in the manner directed by the Tribunal and if found suitable, promote\n\nthem with effect from 30.09.1997 with all consequential benefits as regards\n\nseniority in the grade of Superintendent. No backwages, however, were to be paid\n\nto them. They were also directed to hold review DPC to consider the cases of\n\napplicants and other eligible SC/ST officers, for promotion against reserved\n\nvacancies, which at the time of order of the Tribunal were occupied by respondents\n\n5 to 34 in the OA.\n\n3. We may note at the very outset that the constitutional validity of the OM\n\ndated 2.7.1997, issued by DoP&T has not been challenged in this petition. A\n\nnumber of OMs were issued during the pendency of this petition. Most of them\n\nform part of the compilation submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\nThe constitutional validity of none of these OMs has been challenged before us.\n\nThis is also not the contention of the petitioner before us, that reservation in\n\npromotions to the cadre of Superintendent is unconstitutional.\n\n4. Admittedly, rules for appointment by promotion to the post of\n\nSuperintendent (Grade „B‟) in Central Excise and Customs provide for promotion\n\non the basis of seniority-cum-merit. A perusal of the letter C.No.II/39/229/2007-\n\nCF(CCA) dated 6.9.2007 from the office of Commissioner of Central Excise would\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 4 of 32\n\n show that the post of Superintendent Group „B‟ is a selection post and the\n\nbenchmark prescribed for promotion to Superintendent Group „B‟ is „good‟. It was\n\nan admitted position before us that under the method of selection applicable for\n\npromotion to the post of Superintendent (Group „B‟), all those irrespective of\n\nwhether they belonged to general category or to the reserved categories, who are\n\ngraded „good‟ or above, are arranged in the order of seniority in the feeder cadre\n\nand there is no supersession amongst them.\n\n5. Primarily, the following two issues arise for our consideration in this writ\n\npetition:-\n\n a) Whether SC/ST officers „promoted to a higher post\n on their own merit‟ are to be adjusted against\n general category posts or against reserved posts, in\n cases where the promotions are made on the basis\n of seniority-cum-merit, or is this benefit available\n only in the case of direct recruitments?\n\n b) Whether SC/ST candidates, having merit equal to\n the general category candidates and possessing the\n prescribed benchmark of „Good‟, can be said to\n have been promoted on the basis of their own\n merit, in a selection based on the norm of\n „seniority-cum-merit?\n\n6. It was contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that since\n\nno element of merit is involved in promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit/seniority-cum-fitness/seniority-cum-suitability which according to him are\n\nidentical terms, the principle of \"promotion on his own merit\" does not apply to\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 5 of 32\n\n such promotions. His contention was that this principle, would apply only in cases\n\nof promotion on the basis of merit, where comparative merit of the candidates\n\ncoming in the zone of consideration are evaluated and possibly in the cases of\n\npromotions on the basis of Limited Departmental Examination. \nIn support of his\n\ncontention he has relied primarily upon \nAjit Singh Januja and Others v. State of\n\nPunjab and Others\n (1996) 2 SCC 715 and K.Manorama v. Union of India\n\n2010(10) Scale 304.\n\n7. \nIn \nR.K. Sabharwal\n (supra), reservation policy of Punjab Government was\n\nchallenged on two grounds. The first contention of the petitioner was that for\n\nworking out the percentage of reservation, the promotees/appointees belonging to\n\nthe Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, whether appointed against the general\n\ncategory posts or against the reserved posts are to be counted, meaning thereby that\n\nif the reservation is 14% for Scheduled Castes candidates and more than 14% of\n\nsuch candidates are appointed/promoted in a cadre on their own merit/seniority by\n\ncompeting with the general category candidates, then the purpose of reservation in\n\nthe said cadre having been achieved, the Government instructions providing\n\nreservations would become inoperative. The second contention of the petitioners\n\nwas that once the posts earmarked for Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward\n\nClasses on the roster are filled, the reservation is complete and the roster cannot\n\noperate any further. Any posts falling vacant in a cadre thereafter, are to be filled\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 6 of 32\n\n from the categories, „reserved‟ or general, due to retirement etc. of whose member\n\nthe post fell vacant. Repelling the first contention, the Supreme Court inter-alia\n\nheld as under:-\n\n \"When a percentage of reservation is fixed in\n respect of a particular cadre and the roster indicates\n the reserve points, it has to be taken that the posts\n shown at the reserve points are to be filled from\n amongst the members of reserve categories and the\n candidates belonging to the general category are\n not entitled to be considered for the reserve posts.\n On the other hand the reserve category candidates\n can compete for the non-reserve posts and in the\n event of their appointment to the said posts their\n number cannot be added and taken into\n consideration for working out the percentage of\n reservation. When the State Government after\n doing the necessary exercise makes the reservation\n and provides the extent of percentage of posts to be\n reserved for the said backward class then the\n percentage has to be followed strictly. The\n prescribed percentage cannot be varied or charged\n simply because some of the members of the\n backward class have already been\n appointed/promoted against the general seats. As\n mentioned above the roster point which is reserved\n for a backward class has to be filled by way of\n appointment/promotion of the member of the said\n class. No general category candidate can be\n appointed against a slot in the roster which is\n reserved for the backward class. The fact that\n considerable number of members of a backward\n class have been appointed/promoted against\n general seats in the State Services may be a\n relevant factor for the State Government to review\n the question of continuing Reservation for the said\n class but so long as the instructions/Rules\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 7 of 32\n\n providing certain percentage of reservations for the\n backward classes are operative the same have to be\n followed. Despite any number of\n appointees/promotes belonging to the backward\n classes against the general category posts the given\n percentage has to be provided in addition.........\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n The view taken on the second contention of the petitioner before Supreme\n\nCourt is not relevant for our purpose.\n\n \nIn \nUnion of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n: (1995) 6 SCC 684, the\n\nSupreme Court was concerned with the nature of rule of reservation in promotions\n\nobtaining in the Railway Service and the rule concerning the determination of\n\nseniority between general candidates and the candidates belonging to the reserved\n\nclasses in the promoted category.\n\n In para 29 of the judgment, the Supreme Court iner-alia observed as under:-\n\n \"Be that as it may, as a result of the decision in\n R.K. Sabharwal and the views/findings recorded by\n us hereinabove, the following position emerges:\n\n (i) Once the number of posts reserved for being\n filled by reserved category candidates in a cadre,\n category or grade (unit for application of rule of\n reservation) are filled by the operation of roster,\n the object of rule of reservation should be deemed\n to have been achieved and thereafter the roster\n cannot be followed except to the extent indicated in\n Para 5 of R.K. Sabharwal. While determining the\n said number, the candidates belonging to the\n reserved category but selected/promoted on their\n own merit (and not by virtue of rule of reservation)\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 8 of 32\n\n shall not be counted as reserved category\n candidates.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n8. The use of the expression „appointed/promoted‟ in para 4 of the judgment in\n\nR.K.Sabharwal\n (supra), coupled with the fact that the case before the Supreme\n\nCourt was a case of reservation in promotions, in Punjab Service of Engineers\n\n(Class-1), we have no hesitation in holding that the decision of the Supreme Court\n\nin this case applies not only to direct recruitments but also to the appointments by\n\nway of promotion.\n \nThis view gets support from the use of the expression\n\n„promoted/appointed‟ in \nVeer Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra) as well as in \nAjit Singh\n\nJanuja\n (supra).\n \nIn any case, even the expression „appointment‟, in the absence of\n\nany indication to the contrary, includes appointment by promotion, as rightly held\n\nby the Tribunal relying upon the decision of 09 members‟ Bench of the Supreme\n\nCourt in \nIndra Sawhney v. Union of India\n: (1992) Supp (3) SCC 217.\n\n9. By the OM No. 36012/2/96-Estt.(Res.) dated 2.7.1997, DoP&T, inter alia,\n\nstated as under:\n\n \n\"The undersigned is directed to say that under the\n existing instructions, vacancy-based rosters have been\n prescribed in order to implement the Government‟s\n policy relating to reservation of jobs for the Scheduled\n Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the other backward\n classes. The application of reservation on the basis of\n these rosters was called into question before Courts. The\n Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in case of \nR.K.\n Sabharwal vs. State of Punjab\n as well as \nJ.C. Mallick Vs.\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 9 of 32\n\n Ministry of Railways\n has held that the reservation of jobs\n for backward classes SC/ST/OBC should apply to posts\n and not to vacancies. The court further held that the\n vacancy based rosters can operate only till such time as\n the representation of person belonging to the reserved\n categories, in a cadre reaches the prescribed percentages\n of reservations. Thereafter, the rosters cannot operate\n and vacancies released by retirement, resignation,\n promotion etc. of the person belonging to the general and\n the reserved categories are to be filled by appointment of\n persons from the respective category so that the\n prescribed percentage of reservation is maintained.\n With a view to bringing the policy of reservation in line\n with the law \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court, it has been\n decided that the existing 200 point, 40 point and 120-\n point vacancy-based rosters shall be replaced by post\n based rosters. All Ministries/Departments and concerned\n Authorities are requested to prepare the respective rosters\n based on the principles elaborated in the explanatory\n notes given in Annexure-1 to this O.M. and illustrated in\n the model Rosters annexed to this O.M. as Annexure-II,\n III and IV. Similarly, the concerned authorities may\n prepare rosters to replace the existing 100-point rosters in\n respect of local recruitment to group C & D posts on the\n basis of the same principles.\n\n x x x x\n At the stage of initial operation of a roster, it will be\n necessary to adjust the existing appointments in the\n roster. This will also help in identifying the\n excesses/shortage, if any, in the respective categories in\n the cadre. This may be done starting from the earliest\n appointment and making an appropriate remark-\"utilized\n by SC/ST/OBC/GEN\" as the case may be against each\n point in the rosters as explained in the explanatory notes\n appended to the model rosters. In making these\n adjustment, appointment of candidates belonging to\n SC/ST/OBCs which were made on merit (and not due to\n reservation) are not to be counted towards reservation so\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 10 of 32\n\n far as direct recruitment is concerned. In other words,\n they are to be treated as general category appointments.\"\n\n \nVide OM No. 36038/17/2001-Estt.(Res.) dated 11.7.2002, DoP&T issued the\n\nfollowing clarifications regarding its earlier OM dated 2.7.1997, which it had\n\nissued in implementation of the decision of Supreme Court in \nR.K.Sabharwal\n\n(supra). The OM, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:\n\n \"Subject: Reservation in promotion - Treatment of\n SC/ST candidates promoted on their own merit\n\n The undersigned is directed to say that this Department\n has been receiving references from various Ministries\n etc. regarding adjustment of SC/ST candidates promoted\n on their own merit in the reservation rosters introduced\n vide DoPT‟s OM No. 36012/2/96-Estt.(Res.) dated\n 2.7.1997. While it is clear from the OM dated 2.7.1997\n that the SC/ST/OBC candidates appointed by direct\n recruitment on their own merit and not owing to\n reservation will be adjusted against unreserved points of\n the reservation roster, doubts have been raised about\n SC/ST candidates promoted on their own merit. It is\n hereby clarified that:-\n\n (i) The SC/ST candidates appointed by\n promotion on their own merit and not owing to\n reservation or relaxation of qualifications will not be\n adjusted against the reserved points of the reservation\n roster. They will be adjusted against unreserved\n points.\n\n (ii) If an unreserved vacancy arises in a cadre\n and there is any SC/ST grade, such SC/ST candidate\n cannot be denied promotion on the plea that the post\n is not reserved. Such a candidate will be considered\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 11 of 32\n\n for promotion along with other candidates treating\n him as if he belongs to general category. In case he\n is selected he will be appointed to the post and will\n be adjusted against the unreserved point.\n\n (iii) SC/ST candidates appointed on their own\n merit (by direct recruitment or promotion) and\n adjusted against unreserved points will retain their\n status of SC/ST and will be eligible to get benefit of\n reservation in future/further promotions, if any.\"\n\n \nBy the OM No. 36028/17/2001-Estt.(Res.) dated 31.1.2005 DoP&T clarified\n\nthat since in case of promotions by non-selection, promotions are made on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-fitness and the concept of merit is not involved, the OM dated\n\n11.7.2002 does not apply to the promotions made by non-selection method.\n\nHowever, vide OM No. 36012/45/2005-Estt. (Res.) dated 10.8.2010, DoP&T after\n\nexamining the matter in the light of the decision of Madras High Court in \nUnion of\n\nIndia v. S.Kalugasalamoorthy WP No.15926/2007\n withdrew the OM\n\nNo.36028/17/201-Estt. (Res.) dated 31.1.2005 and clarified that SC/ST candidates\n\nappointed by promotion on their own merit and seniority and not owing to\n\nreservation or relaxation of qualifications will be adjusted against unreserved\n\npoints of reservation roster, irrespective of the fact that whether the promotion is\n\nmade by selection method or non-selection method. These instructions took effect\n\nfrom 2.7.1997, the date on which post based reservation was introduced.\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 12 of 32\n\n \n10. From a combined reading of the aforesaid OMs it becomes evident that the\n\nOM dated 2.7.1997, issued towards implementation of the decision of Supreme\n\nCourt in \nR.K.Sabharwal\n (supra) for not counting appointments made on the basis\n\nof merit, in the quota meant for reserved categories, applies not only to direct\n\nappointments but also to promotions, including the promotions on the basis of\n\nseniority-cum-merit (non-selection method). The OM dated 31.1.2005 having been\n\nset aside by the Madras Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal in OA No.\n\n900/2005, the order of the Tribunal having been upheld by the Madras High Court\n\nand the decision of the High Court having been accepted by Government of India,\n\nno reliance can be placed by the petitioner on the said OM dated 31.1.2005, to\n\ninterpret the OM dated 2.7.1997 issued by DoP&T since the OM No.\n\n36012/45/2005-Estt. (Res.) dated 10.8.2010 is clarificatory in nature and not in its\n\nmodification/supersession.\n It is a settled proposition of law that an explanation or a\n\nclarification has a retrospective effect (see S.B. Chattarjee v. S.D. Majumdar &\n\nOrs, (2007) 10 SCC 513 and Ashok Lenka v. Rishi Dikshit and Ors. (2006) 9 SCC\n\n90). It would mean that on issue of OM dated 2.7.1997, the principle of not\n\ncounting of SC/ST candidates promoted/appointed \"on their own merit\" against\n\nreserved vacancies had become applicable to all promotions, including the\n\npromotions on the basis of seniority-cum-merit (non selection method).\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 13 of 32\n\n Even otherwise, the Supreme Court did not use the expression \"comparative\n\nmerit\" or \"superior merit\", but used the expression \"on their own merit\".\n\n11. We also note that vide OM No. 36011/1/98-Estt. (Res.) dated 1.7.1998\n\nDoP&T clarified that only such SC/ST/OBC candidates who are selected on the\n\nsame standards as is applied to general categories shall not be adjusted against\n\nreserved vacancies. It was further stated that when a relaxed standard is applied in\n\nselecting an SC/ST/OBC candidate, for example in the age limit, experience,\n\nqualification, permitted number of chances in written examination, extended zone\n\nof consideration larger than what is provided for general category candidates etc.\n\nthe SC/ST/OBC candidates are to be counted against reserved vacancies. The\n\nbenefit of the relaxed standard should have been taken by the reserved category\n\ncandidate, in promotion, if his promotion is to be counted against reserved vacancy.\n\nWe also take note of the fact that this OM was issued by way of clarification of\n\ninstructions contained in the OM dated 2.7.1997 which provided that the\n\nSC/ST/OBC candidates selected on their own merit will be adjusted against\n\nreserved vacancies. This OM clearly indicates that while issuing the OM dated\n\n2.7.1997 Government of India was of the view that if the standard applied in\n\nselection of SC/ST/OBC candidate is equal to the standard applied in selection of\n\ngeneral category candidates, the appointment of reserved category candidates\n\nwould not be counted against reserved vacancies.\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 14 of 32\n\n In the case before us, admittedly, general category candidates as well as\n\nreserved category candidates were subjected to the same standard for promotion to\n\nthe post of Superintendent (Group „B‟) in Central Excise and Customs. This is not\n\nthe case of the petitioner before us that while making promotions to the post of\n\nSuperintendent (Group „B‟) amongst reserved category candidates, any relaxation\n\nwas granted in age, experience, qualification etc. or that any extended zone of\n\nconsideration was applied in promotion of those, whom the Tribunal has directed to\n\nbe considered for appointment against general vacancies. As noted earlier by us,\n\nthe OM dated 2.7.1997 in view of subsequent clarification issued by DoP&T\n\napplied not only to direct appointments but also to promotions, including\n\npromotion by way of seniority-cum-fitness, as is evident from the clarification\n\ndated 10.8.2010 issued by DoP&T. Therefore, in our opinion, OMs issued by\n\nDoP&T envisaged that the SC/ST candidates, promoted on the basis of standards\n\nequal to those prescribed for general category candidates will be considered to have\n\nbeen promoted on their own merit and seniority and not owing to reservation.\n\n12. The issue involved in this petition also came up for consideration before\n\nanother Division Bench of this Court in WP(C) No. 11371-73/2005 decided on\n\n15.2.2008. That was a case of promotion of Inspectors of Central Excise to the\n\npost of Superintendent Grade „B‟. The Recruitment Rules for the promotional post\n\nprovided that an Inspector with 8 years‟ service on regular basis would be eligible\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 15 of 32\n\n for consideration for promotion to the next grade of Superintendent Grade B which\n\nwas a selection post. There were a total of 282 vacancies in the cadre of\n\nSuperintendent Grade B, out of which 39 were reserved for SC candidates, 24 for\n\nST candidates, the remaining 219 vacancies being unreserved. While making\n\npromotions some of the persons belonging to SC/ST categories were adjusted\n\nagainst unreserved posts meant for general category candidates. This was\n\nchallenged before the Tribunal which directed the respondents in the OA to apply\n\nthe principles, which it had evolved in its earlier decision in the case of\n\nB.C.K.Ralu v. Chief Commissioner of Central Excise Andhra Pradesh Zone\n\nand Anr. (decided by Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal dated 31.7.2003). The\n\norder of the Tribunal was challenged by the Government before this Court. On\n\nexamination of various OMs issued by DoP&T, this Court inter alia observed as\n\nunder:\n\n \"Conjoint reading of the aforesaid four clarifications\n would make it abundantly clear that when SC/ST\n candidates are appointed even by promotion on their\n merit and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\n qualifications will be adjusted against unreserved points\n and not against reserved points. They would still retain\n their status of SC/ST and will be eligible to get benefit of\n reservation in future/further promotions. Once such\n SC/ST candidates getting promotion on their own merit\n and not due to reserved points, even while calculating\n 50% points on reservation such persons would be\n excluded meaning thereby they would not be treated as\n promoted against reserved category.\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 16 of 32\n\n For promotion to grades below the revised pay-scale of\n Rs. 12,000-16,500 where the mode of promotion is\n 'selection', the bench-mark prescribed is 'good'. Thus,\n those officers who qualify the bench-mark of good will\n be graded by the DPC as fit or unfit. Those who are\n graded as fit shall be included in the select panel\n prepared by the DPC in order of their inter-se seniority in\n the feeder grade and there shall be no supersession in\n promotion among those who are found fit by the DPC in\n terms of the prescribed bench mark of 'good'.\"\n\n The respondents in that case contended that since as per OM dated 8.2.2002,\n\nthe mode of promotion was selection, and all the candidates who achieved the\n\nbenchmark of „good‟ were to be classified as fit and there being no supersession in\n\npromotion, there was no element of merit as visualized in the OM dated 11.7.2002.\n\nDealing with the contention this Court inter alia observed and held as under:\n\n \"After considering the respective submissions and the\n position contained in various office memoranda, we are\n of the opinion that having regard to the recruitment rules,\n it cannot be said that the promotion to the post of\n Superintendent Grade B is merely on the basis of\n seniority. It is treated as selection post. The procedure to\n be observed by the DPC when the mode of promotion is\n selection as prescribed in OM dated 8.2.2002. As per this\n OM the bench mark 'good' is provided. No doubt, the\n persons are to be ultimately rated as 'fit' or 'unfit'.\n However, only those candidates would be eligible for\n promotion who are declared fit and to get the declaration\n of fit, DPC has to consider and arrive at a conclusion, on\n the basis of ACRs and other material provided to it, as to\n whether they are to be graded as good. There is an\n element of selection here and unless a candidate achieves\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 17 of 32\n\n this bench mark, he would be treated as unfit. Fit or unfit\n Therefore has relevance to achieving the prescribed\n bench mark and does not have the same connotation as\n seniority-cum-fitness. The bench mark 'good' has the\n element of merit.\n\n Therefore, what is relevant for us to note as to whether\n SC/ST candidates are selected for promotion to this post\n on the same standard as applied to general candidates. If\n that is so, they would not be adjusted against reserved\n vacancies. On the other hand, if relaxed standards are\n applied in making their promotions, for example lesser\n Bench Mark, lesser period of qualifying service, bringing\n them in zone of consideration because of the reason of\n their being SC/ST, comparatively lesser ACRs etc., then\n they would be deemed as promoted against reserved\n vacancies. The bench mark for general category\n candidates is good. It is not known and nothing has come\n on record to show as to what was the bench mark\n provided for those Inspectors who belonged to the\n categories of SC/ST. In the absence of such material\n provided before us or before the Tribunal it is not\n possible to come to a definite conclusion. At the same\n time, we find that without focusing on this aspect which\n was relevant, the Tribunal simply followed B.C.K. Ralu\n (supra) and directed the petitioners to pass a detailed and\n speaking order on the representation of the respondents\n herein. In these circumstances, having regard to the\n aforesaid legal position, we modify the directions\n contained in the order of the Tribunal and dispose of the\n writ petition by substituting the following directions:\n\n Those candidates belonging to SC/ST category who were\n recommended for promotions applying the same bench\n mark of 'good' as applicable to the general candidates\n such SC/ST candidates would be adjusted against\n unreserved points. On the other hand such SC/ST\n candidates who are given promotion on the basis of\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 18 of 32\n\n relaxed standards would be treated as promoted against\n reserved vacancies.\"\n\n This Court, during the course of the judgment, noted that vide OM dated\n\n11.7.2002 it had been clarified that those SC/ST candidates who were selected on\n\ntheir own merit were to be adjusted against unreserved slots. This judgment\n\nsquarely applies to the case before us, as the rules for promotion for the feeder\n\ncadre of Inspectors in Central Excise and Customs to Superintendent Grade B are\n\nidentical to the rules for promotion from cadre of Inspector in Central Excise to\n\nSuperintendent Grade B in Central Excise, which were subject matter of Bharat\n\nBhushan & Anr (supra). The benchmark prescribed is „good‟ in both the cadres.\n\nThose, who achieved the prescribed benchmark are to be rated fit and those who\n\nare declared fit are to be promoted in order of their seniority. As noted by this\n\nCourt, there is an element of selection in the benchmark „good‟ since those who\n\nhad not achieved the prescribed benchmark of „good‟ are required to be treated as\n\nunfit and consequently are not to be promoted.\n\n13. \nIn \nUnion of India v. Central Administrative Tribunal, Writ Petition No.\n\n1311/1999, decided by Madras High Court on 28.1.2003 the decision of which was\n\naffirmed by Supreme Court in K.Manorama (supra), Rule 204.8 of the relevant\n\nrules provided that the candidates securing 80 marks and above would be graded as\n\n\"Outstanding\" and candidates who were securing between 60% marks and 79%\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 19 of 32\n\n marks would be graded as \"Good\". Rule 204.9 provided that employees securing\n\nthe gradation \"Outstanding\" were to be placed on top, followed by those securing\n\nthe gradation \"Good\", inter se seniority within each group being maintained. The\n\nHigh Court noted that the selection of „outstanding‟ candidates was placed purely\n\non merit, without any other consideration, but, as far as rest of the candidates were\n\nconcerned, seniority was to prevail, irrespective of variation in their qualifying\n\nmarks. The „outstanding‟ candidates were to have a march over all other\n\ncandidates, irrespective of seniority, but, when it came to candidates coming in the\n\ncategory of „Good‟, seniority alone was to prevail, irrespective of the qualifying\n\nmarks secured by them. Of the two vacancies notified, one was reserved and other\n\nwas unreserved. No candidate had secured 80 marks or more in the written\n\nexamination and therefore all the successful candidates were arrayed in accordance\n\nwith their seniority in the feeder cadre. The 03rd respondent who was a scheduled\n\ncaste candidate and was also the seniormost, was placed at sl. No. 1 while the 04th\n\nrespondent, who was a general category candidate, was placed at sl. No. 2. The\n\nsecond respondent an SC candidate was placed at sl. No. 5 in the order of seniority.\n\nAdmittedly, in the roster, SC point had to be filled in at the first instance and the\n\nunreserved post had to be filled next. Since between 2 nd and 3rd respondents, who\n\nbelonged to reserved category, the 3rd respondent was the seniormost, having\n\nachieved the first place in the gradation list, by virtue of minimum qualifying\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 20 of 32\n\n marks scored by him his selection to the post of Assistant Law Officer at SC point\n\nwas imperative, the High Court was of the view that once the post in the reserved\n\ncategory got filled up, there was no scope for the claim of the second respondent in\n\nthe reserved category. In unreserved category, since the fourth respondent was the\n\nsenior most as per the gradation list, he having secured the required marks for\n\ngetting a placement at the second level by virtue of his seniority, his selection\n\nunder unreserved category was also held to be correct. The contention raised on\n\nbehalf of the second respondent was that though the third respondent belonged to a\n\nreserved category, on account of his position as No.1 in the gradation list, he ought\n\nto have been selected against unreserved post, excluding the claim of the other\n\nselected candidates. The High Court found no merit in the contention, the same\n\nbeing applicable only to „outstanding‟ candidates and not to „good‟ candidates.\n\nThe High Court also held that the third respondent, who was a scheduled caste\n\ncandidate could not have been selected against unreserved category inasmuch as\n\nonce he stood first in the gradation list, by virtue of his „good performance‟ along\n\nwith others by virtue of his seniority, he had to be considered for selection in the\n\n„SC category‟, which was the roster point in that selection and when once his\n\nselection in that „SC category‟ was rightly made, there was no scope for\n\nconsidering the claim of the second respondent in that category. It would thus be\n\nseen that in the case before the High Court, it was the reserved point in the roster\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 21 of 32\n\n which was to be filled up first. Respondent No.3 who was a reserved category\n\ncandidate, who on account of his having secured the qualifying marks and graded\n\nas „good‟ and also being seniormost amongst the qualified candidates was required\n\nto be considered against the reserved vacancy. It was not open to the Selection\n\nCommittee not to consider him against the reserved post, which was to be filled\n\nbefore filling the unreserved post. Once respondent No.3 was selected against the\n\nreserved post, there was no question of considering him again against the\n\nunreserved post. It would thus be seen that the High Court upheld the selection of\n\nrespondent No.3 against the reserved post on account of the reserved post being the\n\nfirst one in the roster to be filled up by promotion and respondent No.3 besides\n\nbeing a reserved category candidate was also the seniormost qualified candidate.\n\n When the matter was taken to Supreme Court, the appellant before the\n\nSupreme Court who also belonged to a scheduled caste took the plea that\n\nrespondent No.3 Mr. M. Siddiah had been promoted on his own merit and not\n\nbecause of his being a SC candidate and therefore he should have been adjusted\n\nagainst the general category vacancy, whereas she should have been promoted\n\nagainst the reserved post, on account of her being a scheduled caste. On\n\nexamination of the matter, Supreme Court found that, in fact, respondent No. 3 had\n\nnot obtained highest marks. He had obtained 124 marks, whereas respondent No. 4\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 22 of 32\n\n obtained 128 marks. Two more candidates, who were not selected, had obtained\n\nmarks higher than the marks obtained by respondent No.3.\n\n The Supreme Court noted that the Tribunal had observed in para 14 of its\n\norder that respondent No.3 had obtained the highest number of marks in the\n\nselection and therefore the question of his being the SC candidate had evaporated\n\non account of his being the most meritorious candidate in the entire selection. The\n\nTribunal had also observed that had respondent No.4 come up in the marks over\n\nthat of respondent No.3 and the question of the respondent No.3 being the senior in\n\nthe SC candidates, then respondent No.3 would have been justified in being\n\nempanelled in the reserved category. The Supreme Court noted from the chart\n\nquoted in the judgment that respondent No.4 had actually obtained the highest\n\nmarks i.e. 128, whereas respondent No.3 Mr. Siddaiah had obtained 124 marks.\n\nThere were two other candidates between respondent No.4 and respondent No.3,\n\none of them having obtained 127 marks and other having obtained 125 marks. The\n\nSupreme Court observed that Mr. Siddaiah (respondent No.3) had been selected out\n\nof them essentially because it was a scheduled caste vacancy, which came to be\n\nallotted to him, keeping aside other candidates. The Court was of the view that\n\nthere was no occasion to apply the instruction contained in Railway Board‟s letter\n\ndated 29.7.1993 nor the propositions in R.K.Sabharwal‟s case (supra). The\n\nobservations made by the Supreme Court in this regard are as under:\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 23 of 32\n\n \"In view of this position, there is no occasion to apply the\n instruction contained in Railway Board's letter dated\n 29.7.1993 nor the propositions in R.K. Sabharwal's\n judgment (supra) to the present case. Even otherwise, the\n principle that when a member belonging to a Scheduled\n Caste gets selected in the open competition field on the\n basis of his own merit, he will not be counted against the\n quota reserved for Scheduled Castes, but will be treated\n as open candidate, will apply only in regard to\n recruitment by open competition and not to the\n promotions effected on the basis of seniority-cum-\n suitability.\"\n\n14. The learned counsel for the private respondents submitted that the decision\n\nof Supreme Court in K.Manorama (supra) would not apply to the case before this\n\nCourt for the reasons that (i) respondent No. 3, in that case, who was promoted\n\nagainst the reserved post had obtained lesser marks (124) than the general category\n\ncandidate who had obtained 128 marks and, therefore, did not have equal merit (ii)\n\nthe first vacancy to be filled up by promotion was a reserved vacancy and the SC\n\ncandidate having already been selected against that vacancy could not have been\n\nconsidered against the general category vacancy and (iii) no office order or circular\n\nsimilar to clarificatory OMs dated 11.7.2002 and 10.8.2010 had been issued. \nHe\n\nalso submitted that in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench of Supreme\n\nCourt in \nR.K.Sabharwal\n (supra), it is no more res integra that not only those who\n\nare appointed by way of direct recruitment, but also those who are promoted on the\n\nbasis of their own merit are to be adjusted against the general vacancies and not\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 24 of 32\n\n against the reserved vacancies.\n We take note of the fact that in case of\n\nK.Manorama (supra), it were rules 204.8 & 204.9 of the relevant rules which\n\napplied to the case before the Court. Neither OM dated 2.4.1997 nor the OMs\n\ndated 11.7.2002 & 10.8.2010 issued by DoP&T were applicable to the case before\n\nthe Supreme Court. Therefore, the observations made by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncontext of the rules of Railways, would not ipso facto apply to the case before us,\n\nwhere the promotions were to be made in terms of various OMs issued by DoP&T\n\nfrom time to time.\n\n15. Relying upon the decision of Supreme Court in \nAjit Singh Januja\n (supra)\n\nas well as the view taken by this Court in Bharat Bhushan (supra), it was\n\ncontended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that since some of the reserved\n\ncategory candidates had, on account of reservation available in confirmation at the\n\nrelevant time, been granted earlier confirmation and consequently had become\n\nsenior to the petitioner, who was appointed earlier to them in point of time,\n\npromotion of such candidates cannot be counted against general vacancies.\n\n16. \nIn \nAjit Singh Januja\n (supra), the Government of Punjab had issued a\n\ncircular stating therein that those Scheduled Castes/Backward Classes employees\n\nwho get appointed/promoted against reserved points on the basis of their\n\nmerit/seniority could not be counted for the purpose of reservation but that reserve\n\npoint should be carried over to the next point on the roster and filled by a\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 25 of 32\n\n candidate/employee belonging to Scheduled Castes/Backward Classes, so that the\n\ndeficiency of representation in service is made up. The issue which Supreme\n\nCourt was called upon to consider \nin that case\n was as to whether, the members of\n\nScheduled Casts/Tribes/Backward Classes, for whom specific percentage of posts\n\nhad been reserved and roster had been provided and who had been promoted\n\nagainst those posts on the basis of \"accelerated promotion\", because of reservation\n\nof posts and applicability of the roster system can claim promotion against general\n\ncategory posts, in still higher grade, on the basis of their seniority, which itself was\n\nthe result of „accelerated promotion‟ on the basis of reservation in roster. Allowing\n\nthe appeal and setting aside the judgment of the Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana\n\nHigh Court, Supreme Court observed and held as under:-\n\n \n\"In \nR.K. Sabharwal\n's case, this Court has treated the\n members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes\n in two categories i.e. those who are appointed or\n promoted having competed with general category\n candidates on merit and those who are\n appointed/promoted on basis of reservation and roster.\n For those who have competed on merit it has been held\n that their number is not to be taken into consideration\n while working out the percentage of reservation. In\n respect of those members of Scheduled Castes and\n Backward Classes, who have been appointed/promoted\n on the basis of reservation and roster, it has been said in\n clear and unequivocal terms that the \"running account\"\n\n shall stop after the quota provided under the instructions\n is reached and the roster cannot be operated thereafter. In\n other words, there is no question of promoting further\n number of such candidates, who have been\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 26 of 32\n\n appointed/promoted on the basis of reservation and\n roster.\n\nIf the contention of the respondents is accepted as has\n been done by the High Court that such\n appointees/promotees can be considered against posts\n meant for general category candidates merely because\n they have become senior on basis of accelerated\n promotions then, according to us, that exercise shall\n amount to circumventing the judgment of the\n Constitution Bench of this Court in the \nSabharwal\n case,\n because for all practical purposes the promotions of such\n candidates are being continued like a running account\n although the percentage of reservation provided for them\n has been reached and achieved. Once such reserved\n percentage has been achieved and even the operation of\n the roster has stopped, then how it will be permissible to\n consider such candidates for being promoted against the\n general category posts on the basis of their accelerated\n promotion, which has been achieved by reservation and\n roster.\n\n Once the quota is full and roster has stopped for members\n of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes in respect\n of whom reservation has been made and roster has been\n prescribed then their case for promotion to still higher\n grade against general category posts has to be considered\n not treating them as members of the Scheduled Castes or\n Backward Classes \"on any crutch\". They cannot be\n promoted only on basis of their 'accelerated seniority'\n against the general category posts. In R.K. Sabharwal's\n case it was said that the candidates belonging to\n Scheduled Castes who compete on their own merit along\n with general category candidates then they are not to be\n counted within the percentage of reservation made for\n such candidates in the service, because they have\n competed with the general category candidates on their\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 27 of 32\n\n own merit. The same principle which has been\n enunciated by the Constitution Bench in the aforesaid\n case shall be applicable whenever a member of\n Scheduled Castes or Backward Classes has got\n accelerated promotion to a higher grade and is to be\n considered for further promotion to a still higher grade\n against general category posts. The accelerated\n promotions are to be made only against the posts\n reserved or roster prescribed. There is no question of that\n benefit being available when a member of Scheduled\n Castes or Backward Classes claims promotion against\n general category posts in the higher grade.\n\n If a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\n promoted earlier because of the rule of reservation/roster\n and his senior belonging to the general category\n candidate is promoted later to that higher grade the\n general category candidate shall regain his seniority over\n such earlier promoted scheduled caste/tribe candidate. As\n already pointed out above that when a scheduled\n caste/tribe candidate is promoted earlier by applying the\n rule of reservation/roster against a post reserved for such\n scheduled caste/tribe candidate, in this process he does\n not supersede his seniors belonging to the general\n category. In this process there was no occasion to\n examine the merit of such scheduled caste/tribe candidate\n vis-a-vis his seniors belonging to the general category.\n As such it will be only rational, just and proper to hold\n that when the general category candidate is promoted\n later from the lower grade to the higher grade, he will be\n considered senior to candidate belonging to the scheduled\n caste/tribe who had been given accelerated promotion\n against the post reserved for him. Whenever a question\n arises for filling up a post reserved for scheduled\n caste/tribe candidate in still higher grade then such\n candidate belonging to scheduled caste/tribe shall be\n promoted first but when the consideration is in respect of\n promotion against the general category post in a still\n higher grade then the general category candidate who has\n been promoted later shall be considered senior and his\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 28 of 32\n\n case shall be considered first for promotion applying\n either principle of seniority cum merit or merit cum\n seniority. If this rule and procedure is not applied then\n result will be that majority of the posts in the higher\n grade shall be held at one stage by persons who have not\n only entered in service on basis of reservation and roster\n but have excluded the general category candidates from\n being promoted to be posts reserved for general category\n candidates merely on the ground of their initial\n accelerated promotions. This will not be consistent with\n the requirement or the spirit of \nArticle 16(4)\n or\n \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n The case before us is not a case of second or subsequent promotion. We are\n\nconcerned with promotion to the cadre of Superintendent Grade „B‟ from the cadre\n\nof Inspectors, who were directly appointed in that cadre. The case before us is not\n\na case of further promotion of those SC/ST candidates, who had already obtained\n\n„accelerated promotion‟ in the feeder cadre. This was for the first time, they were\n\nbeing considered against a promotional post. The principle \nlaid down by\n Supreme\n\nCourt in \nAjit Singh Januja\n (supra) is known as „catch up principle‟.\n \nHowever, a\n\ncontrary view was taken by a Three-Judge Bench of Supreme Court in \nJagdish Lal\n\nv. State of Haryana\n (1997) 6 SCC 538.\n \nThat view was overruled by the\n\nConstitution Bench in Ajit Singh (II) vs. State of Punjab (\n1999) 7 SCC 209 and\n\nRam Prasad v. D.K. Vijay\n, (1999) 7 SCC 251.\n \nThe Constitution Bench re-affirmed\n\nthe view taken in \nVeer Pal Singh Chauhan\n (supra) and \nAjit Singh Januja\n\n(supra). The issue became alive again on enactment of Constitution (Eighty-fifth\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 29 of 32\n\nAmendment) Act, 2001\n which was aimed at restoring the benefit of consequential\n\nseniority to the reserved categories w.e.f. 17.06.1995.\n \nThe 77 th and 85th\n\nAmendment to the Constitution were challenged before Supreme Court and the\n\nmatter was decided by a Constitution Bench in \nM. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n\n(2006) 8 SCC 212. The Constitution Bench upheld the 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th\n\nAmendments to the Constitution as well as their retrospective effect. Certain\n\nconditions were, however, imposed by the Constitution Bench.\n \nThe view taken in\n\nM. Nagraj\n (supra) was affirmed in \nSuraj Bhan v. State of Rajasthan\n, (2011) 1\n\nSCC 467 as well as in a recent decision in \nU.P. Power Corporation Limited v.\n\nRajesh Kumar & Ors.\n 2012 (4) Scale 687.\n In the case before us, we are not\n\nconcerned with those conditions since the validity of the OMs issued by DOP&T\n\nfrom time to time has not been challenged before us.\n\n This decision, therefore, does not apply to the issues which we are called\n\nupon to decide in this petition.\n\n17. This Court in Bharat Bhushan (supra) gave certain examples of relaxed\n\nstandards in obtaining promotions, for example lesser benchmark, lesser qualifying\n\nservice, extended zones of consideration on account of being from reserved\n\ncategories, lesser number of ACRs etc. to be considered for promotion. Obtaining\n\nearly confirmation was not one of the examples of relaxed standard given by this\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 30 of 32\n\n Court in the case of Bharat Bhusahn (supra). The learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner has not drawn our attention to any judicial pronouncement holding that\n\nobtaining early confirmation by a reserved category candidate would amount to\n\nobtaining promotion on the basis of relaxed standards. More importantly, the\n\npetitioner ought to have challenged the earlier confirmation granted to those\n\nreserved category candidates who were junior to him in the feeder cadre of\n\nInspectors at the time when the confirmation leading to their becoming senior to\n\nhim in that cadre was granted. By not challenging their early confirmation, the\n\npetitioner accepted the seniority granted to them by the department. Having\n\naccepted the seniority by not challenging the same before an appropriate forum, the\n\npetitioner cannot now rake up that issue in the form of the argument advanced by\n\nhim. \nIt would be appropriate for us to note at this stage that in \nThe Direct Recruit\n\nClass-II Engineering Officers' Association and Others v. State of Maharashtra\n\nand Others\n: (1990) 2 SCC 715, a Constitutional Bench of Supreme Court clearly\n\nheld that once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority\n\nhas to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of\n\nhis confirmation. The petitioner therefore ought to have challenged, at the\n\nappropriate time, the early confirmation and consequent seniority granted to those\n\nreserved category Inspectors who were junior to him in the cadre of Inspectors. No\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 31 of 32\n\n such course of action was however taken by the petitioner. We, therefore, find no\n\nmerit in this submission.\n\n18. For reasons stated hereinabove we find no legal infirmity in the impugned\n\norder. The writ petition is devoid of any merit and is hereby dismissed without any\n\norder as to costs.\n\n V.K.JAIN, J\n\n BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J\nMAY 14, 2012\nsn/rb/bg\n\nW.P(C) 3646/1999 Page 32 of 32",
