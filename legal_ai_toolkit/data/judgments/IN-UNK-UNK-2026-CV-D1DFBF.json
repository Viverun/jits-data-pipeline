Talukdar\n\n W.P. No. 574 of 2008\n\n Sri Sukriti Bhushan Roy\n Vs.\n The Union of India & Ors.\n\nFor the Petitioner: Mr. Subhojit Ghosh.\n\nFor the Respondents: Mr. Shyamal Chakraborty.\n\nJudgment on : 31.07.2009.\n\n S.P. Talukdar, J.: Alleging inaction and indifference on the part of the respondent\n\nauthority by way of denying the writ petitioner the benefit under the Central Civil Service\n\nPension Rules and Central Civil Service Commutation of Pension Rules, the petitioner\n\napproached this Court with an application under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution.\n\n Grievances of the petitioner may briefly be stated as follows:-\n\n The petitioner was an employee of the Export Inspection Agency, Calcutta. Prior to\n\nhis retirement, he was in the post of Laboratory Assistant (LA), GR-I(Spl), in Export\n\nInspection Agency (EIA), Calcutta. During the tenure of his service, he appropriately opted\n\nfor being guided under the Family Pension Scheme/GPF and Family Pension under the\n\nCentral Civil Service Pension Rules and Central Civil Service Commutation of Pension\n Rules, hereinafter referred to as the 'Pension Rules'. During his service tenure, appropriate\n\ndeduction used to be made from his monthly salary, which was added to the appropriate\n\naccounts particularly on account of retirement benefit of the petitioner. The scheme for\n\nvoluntary retirement of the employee of Export Inspection Council and Export Inspection\n\nAgency was floated in the year 1994. As would appear on perusal of the said scheme, it\n\nhad the approval of the Government of India. The salient features of the said VRS were :\n\n i) Half a month's Gratuity per year of service subject to a ceiling of Rs. 1 Lakh as\n\n admissible under the Gratuity Rules of EIC/EIAs.\n\n ii) Full matching CPF contribution from the Export Inspection Council/Agency side\n\n irrespective of whether such employees have completed five years service.\n\n (Applicable to such employees, if any, who have not opted for the pension\n\n scheme).\n\n iii) Full commutation of pension.\n\n iv) This offer will remain valid for a period of 60 days only from the date of issued\n\n of the letter.\n\n v) The payment under the scheme is subject to employees agreeing to adjust or\n\n clearing the advances against him or her such as House Building Advance,\n\n Conveyance Advance, LTC Advance, Festival Advance etc., and any other\n\n outstanding dues. The employees are to either pay the amount of advance first or\n\n agree for its adjustment in full against payments that will be made under\n\n EIC/EIAs Voluntary Retirement Scheme.\n\n vi) The option once exercised is final and cannot be withdrawn under any\n\n circumstances.\n\n There was terrible uncertainty regarding continuation of the establishment of the\n\nrespondent authority and consequent apprehension of loss of employment at the relevant\n\ntime. Immediately after floating of the VRS Scheme, full payment of monthly salary to the\n\nemployees of EIA was stopped and it used to be paid by instalments. This gave rise to\n\nfurther apprehension about the future of the employment. The petitioner like many other\n\nwere literally under the threat of retrenchment. The VRS on the face of the record did not\n\nspeak of taking away the accrued right of the petitioner under the Pension Rules. Such\n\nbeing the position, faced with the imminent danger of winding up of the entire EIA,\n\nCalcutta, the petitioner opted for VRS. He voluntarily retired w.e.f. 19th July, 1994. He\n\nwas given retirement benefit vide communication bearing No. EIA/CAL/VRS/2/94/3919\n\ndated 4/6th October, 1994 issued by Smt. Sunanda Dutta, the then Joint Director of Export\n\nInspection Agency, Government of India. The petitioner opted for VRS with an\n\nunderstanding that the full commutation of pension means 1/3rd of the total pension that\n\nwould be paid as per CCS Pension Rules. The petitioner was surprised to receive the entire\n\npension amount as commuted value of pension. Under the said Pension Rules, there was no\n\nscope for making payment of the entire pension amount as commuted value of pensions.\n\nOn enquiry, the petitioner could learn that the payment of 100% commuted value of\n\npension denotes the payment of entire Pensionery Benefit and no monthly pension would be\n\npaid to the petitioner as per the said Pension Rules. The petitioner intended to revert to the\n\nold scheme and was informed that VRS is a Government approved scheme and there is no\n scope for opting out of the same. The petitioner was, thus, subjected to discrimination since\n\nhe had been deprived of better benefits and was compelled to take inferior benefits. The\n\npetitioner claimed that his accrued rights and benefits under the Pension Rules cannot be\n\njeopardized on the basis of a mere scheme of the Government, which is in the nature of the\n\nadministrative action. It cannot be permitted to supersede the Pension Rules having the\n\nlegislative sanction.\n\n Under the VRS, 100% commutation of the pension was given. According to the\n\nPension Rules, only 1/3rd of the entire pension of a person can be commuted. The said\n\nPension Rules provide commutation of only 1/3rd of the pension. It, thus, appears that VRS\n\nis in direct conflict so far as the commutation of pension is concerned. The VRS Scheme\n\ncould not suppress and supersede the said Pension Rules and any attempt in that regard\n\nwould amount to gross illegality. The petitioner along with many others similarly\n\ncircumstanced or identically placed took up the matter with the concerned authority. The\n\nsaid authority despite being repeatedly approached did not choose to respond. Such\n\ninaction on the part of the respondent authority is in violation of the principle of legitimate\n\nexpectation and promissory estoppel. The VRS Scheme was never published in the official\n\ngazette and it cannot have any legal effect and that too, in supersession of the Pension\n\nRules.\n\n One Mr. Saxena took up the issue and in response to the same, he was informed that\n\nthe Ministry of Commerce, New Delhi by letter dated 21st May, 1994 had conveyed the\n\napproval of the Government of such scheme. Thus, such purported approval was merely\n\nconveyed by the communication as has been referred to in the reply to the notice under the\n \nRight to Information Act\n. An appeal under \nSection 6(3)\n of the Right to Information Act,\n\n2005 was preferred by said Mr. Saxena before the Appellate Authority seeking disclosure\n\nof material on record to show formal approval of the VRS by the Government of India.\n\nThere had been no change in complexion whatsoever. The matter was, thereafter, taken up\n\nbefore the Central Information Commission but the order passed by the Information\n\nAuthority as well as First Appellate Authority were confirmed. The petitioner claimed that\n\nVRS Scheme could never have a superseding effect over and above the appropriately\n\nsanctioned Pension Rules, which is having an appropriate legislative sanction. The\n\npetitioner claimed that he cannot be denied his legitimate dues under the said Pension\n\nRules, which provide for commutation of maximum 1/3rd of pension available to an\n\nemployee. It was a matter of great surprise and shock to the petitioner that the entire\n\npension available to the petitioner was commuted. He was given to understand that it was\n\ndone as an additional benefit to the employees like the petitioner who opted for VRS and\n\npremature retirement at the relevant point of time. The stand that 100% commutation was a\n\nspecial measure in supersession of the provisions of the Pension Rules, is illegal, nugatory,\n\nnon-est in the eye of law.\n\n The petitioner claimed that opting for VRS can never be equated to give away his\n\nright accrued under the Central Civil Service Pension Rules (CCSPR). Since the grievance\n\nof the writ petitioner despite being ventilated before the respondent authority time and\n\nagain, did not receive the care and attention, the same deserved, the petitioner, in such\n\ncircumstances, being left with no choice approached this Court with the said application\n\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. Under the Pension Rules, the petitioner is entitled to\n restoration of commuted value of pension after a gap of 15 years. Near about 15\n\nyears have passed since the payment of commuted value of pension under the said scheme\n\nand the least the petitioner is entitled to is restoration of pension that was commuted. The\n\npetitioner also stated that he was ready and willing to return 2/3rd of the commuted value of\n\npension for availing the benefit of monthly pension along with all the accrued benefits and\n\nincrements with retrospective effect, which he is entitled to from the date of his retirement\n\nin the year 1994 or as an alternative measure, the authorities may pay all the D.A. with\n\nnecessary revision as has been allowed from time to time on the Basic Scale of Pay with\n\neffect from the date of retirement of the petitioner. After expiry of 15 years from the date\n\nof voluntary retirement, the petitioner has an accrued right of restoration of commuted\n\nvalue of pension.\n\n Hence, by filing the present application the petitioner sought for benefit under the\n\nCentral Civil Service Pension Rules and the Central Civil Service Commutation of Pension\n\nRules.\n\n The crux of the controversy, thus, seems to be whether the VRS Scheme can be said\n\nto have a superseding effect over the Pension Rules.\n\n On behalf of the respondent attention of the Court was invited to the Voluntary\n\nRetirement Scheme for the employees of the Export Inspection Council/Export Inspection\n\nAgencies dated 21st May, 1994. It was specifically mentioned therein that such scheme\n\nprovided for 'full commutation of pension'. It was also laid down that \"Government is not\n\nobliged to formulate or approve any such Scheme but it has been done so only as a special\n gesture to the EIC/EIAs. The Scheme is a one-time offer and is not to be treated as a\n\nprecedent.\"\n\n In course of submission, reference was made to the decision of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase between Chief Settlement Commissioner, Punjab & Ors. Vs. Ajit Singh Kalha, as\n\nreported in AIR 1969 SC 33. This was in support of the contention that the statutory\n\nprovisions must prevail over executive instructions.\n\n \nIn the aforesaid context, reference was further made to the decision in the case\n\nbetween \nUnion of India Vs. Naveen Jindal & Anr.\n, as reported in (2004) 2 SCC 510.\n \nIn\n\nthe said judgment\n, the Apex Court sought to derive inspiration from an earlier decision in\n\nthe case between the Supreme Court \nAdvocates-on-Record Association Vs. Union of India\n,\n\n1993 4 SCC 441, wherein it was held :\n\n \"Constitution is the 'will' of the people whereas the statutory laws are the creation of\n\nthe legislators who are the elected representatives of the people. Where the will of the\n\nlegislature - declared in the statutes - stands in opposition to that of the people - declared\n\nin the Constitution - the will of the people must prevail.\"\n\n On behalf of the petitioner, it was categorically mentioned that an executive\n\ninstruction can any time be replaced by another set of executive instructions. But when it is\n\nin conflict with a statutory provision, it must give in.\n\n \nIn \nDDA & Ors. Vs. Joginder S. Monga & Ors.\n, as reported in (2004) 2 SCC 297,\n\nthe Apex court clearly laid down that in case of any conflict with statutory provisions, the\n\nlatter will prevail. But in absence of any conflict both will prevail.\n\n \nInviting attention of the Court to the decision in the case between \nState of Kerala &\n\nAnr. Vs. Chandra Mohanan\n, as reported in (2004) 3 SCC 429, it was submitted by\n\nlearned Counsel for the petitioner that the Apex Court in the factual backdrop of the case\n\nbefore it held that circulars being not law within the meaning of \nArticle 13\n of the\n\nConstitution would be of no assistance.\n\n Deriving support and strength from all the aforesaid decisions, it was emphatically\n\nsubmitted on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner's right to pension was essentially\n\ngoverned under the Pension Rules. The Voluntary Retirement Scheme, which did not take\n\nthe shape of any statutory provision could not substitute the Pension Rules. The authority\n\ncan not deny the benefit of the Pension Rules on the ground that the petitioner opted for\n\nV.R.S. On the other hand, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent authority that\n\nnobody compelled the petitioner to accept the Voluntary Retirement Scheme.\n\n \nReference was made to the decision of the Apex Court in the case between \nA. K.\n\nBindal & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors.\n, as reported in (2003) 5 SCC 163 in support of\n\nthe contention that the petitioner in his wisdom must have thought that in the fact situation\n\nVRS was a better option available and he chose the same. After having applied for VRS\n\nand taken the money, it is not open to contend that he exercised the option under any kind\n\nof compulsion.\n\n The Apex Court in the said case held that the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)\n\nwhich is sometimes called Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) is introduced by companies\n\nand industrial establishments in order to reduce the surplus staff and to bring in financial\n\nefficiency. Analyzing the different aspects of the said scheme which was for consideration\n before the Hon'ble Court, it was held that a considerable amount is to be paid to an\n\nemployee ex gratia besides the terminal benefits in case he opts for voluntary retirement\n\nunder the scheme and his option is accepted. It was held that \"the amount is paid not for\n\ndoing any work or rendering any service. It is paid in lieu of the employee himself leaving\n\nthe services of the company or the industrial establishment and foregoing all his claims or\n\nrights in the same. It is a package deal of give and take. That is why in the business world\n\nit is known as 'golden handshake'. The main purpose of paying this amount is to bring\n\nabout a complete cessation of the jural relationship between the employer and the\n\nemployee. After the amount is paid and the employee ceases to be under the employment\n\nof the company or the undertaking, he leaves with all his rights and there is no question of\n\nhis again agitating for any kind of his past rights with his erstwhile employer including\n\nmaking any claim with regard to enhancement of pay scale for an earlier period.\"\n\n \nIn the case between HEC Voluntary Retd. \nEmployees Welfare Society & Anr.\n\nVs. Heavy Engineering Corpn. Ltd. & Ors.\n, as reported in (2006) 3 SCC 708, the Apex\n\nCourt categorically held that the effect of a VRS is cessation of the jural relationship\n\nbetween employer and employee.\n\n It is well settled that a Voluntary Retirement Scheme is a special scheme as\n\ncontrasted with the general scheme of employment governing the terms and conditions of\n\nservice or which is a part of the statutory rules governing the service of the employees. A\n\nvoluntary retirement scheme is only an invitation of offer floated. When pursuant to or in\n\nfurtherance of such a voluntary retirement scheme an employee opts therefor, he makes an\n\noffer which upon acceptance by the employer gives rise to a concluded contract between the\n employer and the employee. In terms of voluntary retirement scheme, an employee has an\n\noption either to accept or not to opt therefor. Such a scheme is ordinarily floated with a\n\npurpose of downsizing the employees. It is beneficial both to the employees as well as to\n\nthe employer. Such a scheme is issued for effective functioning of the industrial\n\nundertakings.\n\n \nIt cannot be disputed that different formulas are laid down for computation of\n\npension having correlationship with the classes of pension. (Ref: \nUCO Bank & Ors. Vs.\n\nSanwar Mal\n, (2004) 4 SCC 412).\n\n In response to the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner regarding the\n\nimpact of executive instruction, learned Counsel for the respondent, referring to the\n\ndecision in the case between Sisir Kumar Mitra Vs. Commissioner, Presidency Division\n\n& Ors., as reported in 1980 CWN 697, submitted that executive instruction can be issued\n\nto supplement the rule of service.\n\n Be that as it may, in the factual backdrop of the present case, it cannot be disputed\n\nthat the scheme for voluntary retirement of the employees of Export Inspection Council and\n\nExport Inspection Agency was floated in the year 1994. One of the salient features was that\n\nthe option once exercised was final and could not be withdrawn under any circumstance.\n\nNo employee, who once opted for the same scheme, could, thus, be permitted to opt out of\n\nthe same and seek benefit elsewhere. Grievances of the writ petitioner rather indicate that\n\nthe petitioner sought to have butter on both sides of the bread.\n\n I find it difficult to appreciate the grievances, as ventilated on behalf of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n The instant case being W.P. No. 574 of 2008 accordingly fails and be dismissed.\n\n There is no order as to costs.\n\n Xerox certified copy of the judgment and order be supplied to the parties, if applied\n\nfor, as expeditiously as possible.\n\n (S.P. Talukdar, J.)",
