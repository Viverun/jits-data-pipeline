These criminal appeals filed under\nsection 374 (2)\nof the Cr.P.C\n\nare linked together as these are arisen out of the same occurrence\n\nwherefrom case and counter-case were instituted by the parties against\n\neach other.\n\n2. At the outset, it needs to mention here that one of the appellants,\n\nnamely, Raj Kumar Choubey in Criminal Appeal No.190 of 1994 (R), had\n\ndied during the pendency of the appeal and vide order dated 27.02.2023\n\nCriminal Appeal No.190 of 1994 (R) qua the appellant, namely, Raj\n\nKumar Choubey stands abated.\n\n3. Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 is directed against the\n\njudgment of conviction and the order of sentence both dated 30.11.1994\n\npassed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Palamu, Daltonganj in\n\nSessions Trial No. 228 of 1991 whereby and whereunder the appellants,\n\nabove-named, have been convicted under\nsections 452\n,\n,\n/\n,\n/\nof the IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life under\n\nsection 302\n/\nof the IPC. They are further sentenced to undergo RI for 7\n\nyears each under\nsection 307\n/\nIPC. They are further sentenced to\n\nundergo RI for 3 years each for other offence under\nsection 452\nIPC. The\n\nappellant, namely, Satyendra Choubey has also been convicted under\n\nsection 27\nof the Arms Act and sentenced to undergo RI for 3 years for\n\nthe offence under\nsection 27\nof the Arms Act. All the sentences shall run\n\nconcurrently.\n\n4. Criminal Appeal (DB) Nos.114 of 2013 and 483 of 2013 are\n\ndirected against the conviction dated 13.02.2013 and the order of sentence\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\ndated 19.02.2013 passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-1st, Garhwa\n\nin S.T. No. 32 of 1999 whereby and whereunder the appellants, above-\n\nnamed, have been convicted under\nsections 323\nIPC. The convict-\n\nappellant, namely, Deo Kumar Chaubey in Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 114\n\nof 2013 has also been convicted under\nsection 304(1)\nIPC.\n\n5. While convicting the appellants of the Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 483\n\nof 2013, the learned trial Court has opined that since the appellants,\n\nnamely, Sumant Kumar Chaubey and Rajendra Kumar Chaubey are first\n\noffenders as not previous conviction has been proved on record against\n\nthem, as such, they have been granted benefit of the\nProbation of\n\nOffenders Act\nand they were directed to be released on furnishing a\n\nprobation bond of Rs.5000/- with two sureties which will be for\n\nmaintaining good conduct for two years.\n\n6. While sentencing the sole appellant of the Cr. Appeal (DB) No.\n\n114 of 2013, namely, Deo Kumar Chaubey the learned trial Court has\n\nawarded sentence to undergo RI for 10 years under\nsection 304(1)\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code with a fine of Rs.5,000/- under\nsection 323\nIPC and in\n\ndefault of payment of fine, he is directed to undergo SI for 1 month.\n\n7. Before adverting to the merit of the instant appeal, it would be apt to\n\nrefer herein that this Court is conscious with the settled position of law\n\nthat the fair procedure to adopt in a matter like the present case where\n\nthere are cross cases and in the such type of cases, the same learned Judge\n\nmust try both the cross cases one after the another and after the recording\n\nof evidence in one case is completed, he must hear the arguments but he\n\nmust reserve the judgment. Thereafter he must proceed to hear the cross\n\ncase and after recording all the evidence he must hear the arguments but\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nreserve the judgment in that case. The same learned Judge must thereafter\n\ndispose of the matters by two separate judgments. In deciding each of the\n\ncases, he can rely only on the evidence recorded in that particular case.\n\nThe evidence recorded in the cross case cannot be looked into. Nor can\n\nthe judge be influenced by whatever is argued in the cross case. Each case\n\nmust be decided on the basis of the evidence which has been placed on\n\nrecord in that particular case without being influenced in any manner by\n\nthe evidence or arguments urged in the cross case. But both the judgments\n\nmust be pronounced by the same learned Judge one after the other.\n\nReference in this regard may be taken from the judgment rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nNathi Lal v. State of U.P.\n, 1990 Supp\n\nSCC 145.\n\n8. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nSudhir v. State of M.P.\n,\n\n(2001) 2 SCC 688 had reiterated the same view as aforesaid and has\n\nobserved that \"it is a salutary practice, when two criminal cases relate to\n\nthe same incident, they are tried and disposed of by the same court by\n\npronouncing judgments on the same day. Such two different versions of\n\nthe same incident resulting in two criminal cases are compendiously called\n\n\"case and counter-case\" by some High Courts and \"cross-cases\" by some\n\nother High Courts. Way back in the nineteen hundred and twenties a\n\nDivision Bench of the Madras High Court (Waller and Cornish, JJ.) made\n\na suggestion (Goriparthi Krishtamma, In re [1929 MWN 881] that \"a case\n\nand counter-case arising out of the same affair should always, if\n\npracticable, be tried by the same court; and each party would represent\n\nthemselves as having been the innocent victims of the aggression of the\n\nother\".\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n9. Thus, it is settled connotation of law that each case must be\n\ndecided on the evidence recorded in it and evidence recorded in another\n\ncase cannot be taken into account in arriving at the decision. The Court\n\nought to have decided the appeal before it only on the basis of the evidence\n\nrecorded in the present case and ought not to have allowed itself to be\n\ninfluenced by the evidence recorded in the cross-case.\n\n10. It is apparent from record that there was a running feud between\n\ntwo groups of the family which resulted in clash between these groups on\n\nthe same day in the same transaction culminating in filing of FIR and\n\ncomplaint by the respective groups.\n\n11. These two cases based upon FIR and complaint were\n\ninvestigated separately leading to two separate criminal trials. The trials\n\nproceeded separately though the two incidents were interconnected.\n\nOrdinarily, these two trials ought to have been tried by the same Judge or\n\nCourt for better appreciation of the evidence and consistency in the\n\ndecisions in the trials as observed by this Court in\nSudhir v. State of\n\nM.P.\n(supra) and Nathi Lal v. State of U.P. (supra).\n\n12. However, the trial proceeded separately resulting in two different\n\noutcomes in which one group of accused were convicted for committing\n\nmurder of the deceased (daughter of the appellant namely Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey, appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013) and in the other\n\ncase, the other group of accused were convicted under Section 323 and\n\nfurther one of the accused namely Deo Kumar Chaubey, appellant in Cr.\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013 has been convicted for the culpable\n\nhomicide not amounting to murder for his own daughter (deceased) and\n\naccordingly, sentenced under\nsection 304(1)\nof the IPC.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n13. Thus, it is evident from the record that herein FIR and complaint\n\nwere lodged by the two disputing groups of the family relating to the same\n\ntransaction on the same day giving their own versions of the incident .\n\nTherefore, we must proceed to consider whether, on the evidence recorded\n\nin each case, the conviction and sentence recorded against the appellants\n\ncan be sustained.\n\n14. This Court taking in to consideration the peculiar fact and\n\ncircumstances of the instant appeals is of the considered view that in the\n\nends of the justice it would be apt to consider the merit of these appeals\n\nseparately one by one.\n\nFactual Matrix (in Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R)\n\n15. The prosecution story of Criminal Appeal (DB) 190 of 1994(R)\n\nin brief as per the allegation made in the fardbayan by the informant-Deo\n\nKumar Chaubey reads as under:\n\n16. The prosecution case was instituted on the fardbayan of Deo\n\nKumar Chuabey recorded on 21.02.91 at 6.30 PM in the house of the\n\ninformant at village Sulsuliya is that on the same day at 12 o'clock the\n\ninformant was going to village Sonpurwa where a Yagya was being\n\nperformed. However, when he reached near his wheat field (plot no.1\n\nsituated towards east of his house, he saw his two nephews namely\n\naccused Binod Kumar Chaubey and Birendra Kunar Chaubey son of\n\naccused Raj Kumar Chaubey getting his wheat crops grazed through their\n\nbuffalo. The informant protested to it, but they did not listen and extended\n\nthreat to assault him.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n17. It has further been alleged that in the meantime, accused\n\nRajkumar Chaubey who is elder brother of the informant also came out\n\nof his house and instigated his two sons to assault the informant. The\n\nInformant, thereafter, fled away and took shelter in the house of\n\nKameshwar Chaubey, a co-villager. However, accused Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey, Binod Kumar Chaubey and Birendra Chaubey chased him and\n\nreached at the darwaja of Kameshwar Choubey. There was no male\n\nmember in the house of Kameshwar Chaubey. The wife of Kameshwar\n\nChaubey requested them with folded hands to get away.\n\n18. In the meantime, co-villager Uday Chaubey (P.W.9) also\n\nreached there and he also requested the accused persons to go away.\n\nThereafter, the aforesaid three accused persons returned back to their\n\nhouse. After two hours, the informant came out of the house of\n\nKameshwar Chaubey and went to his house. It is stated that after 10 to 15\n\nminutes when he was sitting on a khatiya (cot), in the main entrance of his\n\nhouse, at about 2.30 to 3 P.M., all the four accused, namely, Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey and his three sons namely Binod Chaubey, Satyendra Chaubey\n\nand Birendra Chaubey entered into his house through the main door.\n\n19. Accused Satyendra Chaubey was armed with a revolver whereas\n\nremaining three accused were armed with lathi. Seeing the accused\n\npersons, the informant went in the Angan of the house. However, all the\n\nfour accused also followed him and came in the Angan whereas accused\n\nRaj Kumar Chaubey caught him and accused Satyendra Kumar Chaubey\n\nand Binod Chaubey began assaulting him with fists and slaps. Accused\n\nRaj Kumar Chaubey ordered other accused to enter into northern room of\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nthe house and to see the valuables. Thereupon, accused Birendra Chaubey\n\nentered into the northern room of the house and took out Rs.5000/-which\n\nwas kept in a tin box in the said room. It is stated that thereafter the accused\n\npersons dragged him and brought him in the main entrance dhaba of the\n\nhouse where accused Birendra Chaubey and Binod Chaubey tried to\n\nassault him with lathi, but the blow of lathi was obstructed by the roof of\n\nthe house. The informant, therefore, did not sustain lathi injury.\n\n20. In the meantime, accused Raj Kumar Chaubey gave order to kill\n\nthe informant with the revolver. Thereupon, Satyendra Chaubey opened\n\nfire from his country made revolver with intent to kill the informant. But,\n\nthe fire missed the target and hit Nirmala Kumari near her left ear. She fell\n\ndown and died instantly. The accused persons, thereafter took to their\n\nheels and while fleeing away, accused Rajkumar Chaubey @ Khokhan\n\nChaubey left his wooden slipper of left leg and spectacle at the place of\n\noccurrence. Accused Satyendra Chaubey also fled away living his pink\n\ncolour lungi and accused Binod Chaubey left sky colour hawai slipper.\n\n21. On the basis of the aforesaid fardbeyan, a case being Nagar\n\nUntari PS Case No.24/91 dated 21.2.91was instituted under\nsections 452\n,\n,\n,\n,\n/\nof the IPC and 27\nArms Act\n.\n\n22. After investigation, the police submitted the charge sheet against\n\nthe appellants for the offences under\nsections 452\n,\n,\n,\n,\n/\nIPC and under\nSection 27\nArms Act, thereafter, the case was committed\n\nto the court of Sessions. The statements of the appellants were recorded\n\nunder\nSection 313\nof Cr.P.C.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n23. Accordingly, the trial proceeded and the appellants were found\n\nguilty by the learned trial Court for committing murder of the daughter of\n\nthe informant (appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013) namely\n\nNirmala Kumari and has been convicted for the offence under\nSection 452\n,\n,\n/\n,\n/\nof the IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment\n\nfor life under\nsection 302\n/\nof the IPC. They are further sentenced to\n\nundergo RI for 7 years each under\nsection 307\n/\nIPC. They are further\n\nsentenced to undergo RI for 3 years each for other offence under\nsection\nIPC. The appellant, namely, Satyendra Choubey has also been\n\nconvicted under\nsection 27\nof the Arms Act and sentenced to undergo RI\n\nfor 3 years for the offence under\nsection 27\nof the Arms Act. The aforesaid\n\norder of conviction and sentence is under challenge herein.\n\nFactual Matrix [in Criminal Appeal (DB) No.114 of 2013 with\n\nCriminal Appeal (SJ) No.483 of 2013\n\n24. As mentioned above, since these criminal appeals are arising out\n\nof case and counter-case and, as such, the facts in brief are similar to the\n\nfacts of Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R) as the instant case has\n\nbeen lodged after filing of protest complaint petition(Ext.B) in the Court\n\nof ACJM, Garhwa by the informant Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey(appellant/accused in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 190 of 1994).\n\n25. In the complaint-cum-protest petition, it is alleged that on\n\n21.02.91 at about 01.30 PM bullock of the complainant (accused/appellant\n\nin Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R)) had grazed the wheat crops\n\nof the accused Deo Kumar Chaubey (appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No.\n\n114 of 2013) from his field. Deo Kumar Chaubey @ Onkar Chaubey,\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\narmed with Licence gun, went to the wheat field and started to abuse. The\n\ncomplainant came out of his house and told him that what loss has been\n\ncaused to him, he is ready to pay or he may produce the ox in the Kanji\n\nhouse, The accused became furious and went to his house abusing the\n\ncomplainant.\n\n26. On the same day at about 02.00 P.M., the accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey @ Onkar Chaubey, his son Rajendra Chaubey @ Susu Chaubey,\n\nSumant Chaubey and his wife Shardha Devi came at the door of the\n\ncomplainant and started to abuse him. when the complainant came out of\n\nhis house and tried to get understand them, the accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey pointed the gun upon him.\n\n27. In the meantime, one of the sons of Deo Kumar Chaubey\n\nassaulted him from the back side on his head and he fell down. All three\n\naccused persons brought the complainant on their door and after pulling\n\nhim. When Binod Chaubey, Birendra Chaubey (sons of the complainant)\n\nsaw him they came there and tried to save their father.\n\n28. In the meantime, a fire took place from the gun of Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey, which hit Nirmala Kumari, the daughter of the accused Deo\n\nKumar Chaubey. The accused persons started to see Nirmala Kumari. In\n\nthe meantime, both the sons of the complainant brought him to their house.\n\nThe complainant in the injured condition went to the P.S. Nagar Untari.\n\nHe got his treatment in the Hospital.\n\n29. The accused had lodged the case against complainant and his two\n\nsons of which G.R. No. 136/91. The complainant and his sons were\n\nremanded to jail custody. The licence gun of, accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey was examined and it was found that recent fire was done from\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nthe gun. The police did not register the F.I.R., when the complainant\n\nreached Nagar Untari Police station at 03.00 PM, his statement was\n\nrecorded in the night at about 11.00 PM which was not correct.\n\n30. In this case on the basis of the fardbeyan recorded by police at\n\nabout 23 hours on 21.02.91 on the statement of Raj Kumar Chaubey, G.R.\n\nCase No. 137/91 was instituted\nu/s 341\nand\nI.P.C. and 27\nArms Act\n.\n\nBut when the informant Raj Kumar Chaubey found that his case has been\n\nnot been written correctly by the police, he filed protest petition on which\n\ncognizance of the offence was taken. Arter issuance or the summons to\n\nthe accused persons and after appearance of the accused persons, the case\n\nwas committed to the court of sessions.\n\n31. Accordingly, the trial proceeded and the appellants were found\n\nguilty by the learned trial Court and the appellants, above-named, have\n\nbeen convicted under\nsections 323\nIPC. Further, the convict-appellant,\n\nnamely, Deo Kumar Chaubey in Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013\n\nhas also been convicted under\nsection 304(1)\nIPC and sentenced\n\naccordingly. The aforesaid order of conviction and sentence is under\n\nchallenge herein.\n\nSubmission of the learned senior counsel for the appellants [in Cr.\nAppeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R):\n\n32. Mr. B.M. Tripathi, the learned senior counsel for the appellants\n\nhas taken the following grounds for interfering with the finding recorded\n\nby the learned trial Court in the impugned judgment:\n\n(i) There is no specific attributability, as per the evidence adduced on\n\nbehalf of the prosecution, brought on record so far as the appellants,\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nnamely, Satyendra Choubey, Vinod Kumar Choubey and Virendra\n\nKumar Choubey are concerned.\n\n(ii) The conviction is based upon the consideration of the testimony of\n\nall the witnesses together and the learned trial Court has found the\n\nprosecution version to be in corroboration by taking the testimony of all\n\nthe witnesses, but while doing so the testimony of the doctor who has\n\nbeen examined as PW10, as also the Investigating Officer who has not\n\nsupported the ballistic report has not been taken into consideration, as\n\nP.W.10 doctor has specifically stated that the material recovered from\n\nthe wounds of deceased were constituent of 12 bore cartridges which\n\nis used in gun firing and they are not used in revolver or pistols. Further\n\nthe bullet has said to be fired from the country made pistol but there is\n\nno reference of recovery of any country made pistol in the seizure memo\n\nrather one licensee gun has been recovered.\n\n(iii) It has been submitted that the pellet which has been found from\n\nthe body of the deceased has not been fired from the country made pistol\n\nthus, the entire prosecution version as recorded in the FIR wherein it\n\nhas been reported that the pellet has been fired from the country made\n\npistol itself vitiate the entire prosecution version.\n\n(iv) Further, P.W.7 Gopal Mishra have not been believed by the trial\n\ncourt and Rajendra Choubey (P.W.6) who is the son of the informant,\n\nhas been tendered, as such in the aforesaid circumstances the\n\nprosecution story is not fit to be acceptable.\n\n(v) From the deposition of Investigating Officer (P.W.15) his\n\ndescription of the place of occurrence and the manner of occurrence\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nalleged by informant are not consistent with the story of the Informant\n\ngiven in the fardbeyan wherein it has been alleged that the shot fired,\n\nhit on the temple of Nirmala Kumari, no pellet or marks of firing was\n\nfound on the wall or the door in which direction of the firing is said to\n\nhave been done.\n\n(vi) Further, the prosecution has failed to explain the injuries on the\n\nappellant namely Raj Kumar Choubey which casts grave doubt on the\n\nprosecution story specially when the said appellant was examined on\n\npolice requisition at 4 P.M on 21.02.1991.\n\n(vii) Further on perusal of entire evidence it will be evident that none\n\nof the prosecution witness has stated about the premeditation among the\n\naccused/appellants and further no evidence has been brought on record\n\nin order to establish the common intention among the accused\n\nappellants, therefore the application of\nSection 34\nIPC against all the\n\nappellants amounts miscarriage of justice.\n\n(viii) The learned senior counsel has taken the ground that when there\n\nis a case and counter-case for the same transaction and there is two\n\ndifferent trial and in one trial conviction under\nsection 302\nof the IPC\n\nand in other under\nsection 304 (1)\nof the IPC and since it is a case of\n\nsingle murder and as such the conviction is either would be under\n\nsection 302\nIPC or section 304 (1) and both cannot go together reason\n\nbeing that if the accusation is against the present appellants based upon\n\nthat the conviction is there under\nsection 302\n/\nof IPC then what\n\npurpose the conviction is there under\nsection 304 (1)\nIPC against Deo\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nKumar Choubey, the appellant in Criminal Appeal (DB) No.114 of\n\n2013.\n\n(ix) The learned senior counsel based upon the aforesaid grounds has\n\nsubmitted that the prosecution has primarily failed in establish the\n\ncharge said to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt and, as such, the\n\njudgment of conviction passed by the learned trial Court convicting the\n\nappellants, namely, Satyendra Choubey, Vinod Kumar Choubey and\n\nVirendra Kumar Choubey under\nsections 302\n/\nand\n/\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code and under other section of\nIPC\n, therefore, is fit to be\n\nquashed and set aside.\n\nSubmission of the learned counsel for the appellants [in Criminal\n\nAppeal (DB) No.114 of 2013 with Criminal Appeal (SJ) No.483 of\n\n2013]:\n\n33. While assailing the judgment of conviction and sentence, Mr.\n\nJai Shankar Tripathi, the learned counsel appearing in both the appeals has\n\ntaken up the ground that the prosecution version as recorded in the FIR,\n\nsubject matter of Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R) is also\n\nrequired to be taken into consideration wherein the prosecution version is\n\nthat the pellet has been fired from the country made pistol while the\n\nrecovery is of a licensee gun belongs to Deo Kumar Chaudhary, one of the\n\nappellants in these appeals, but admittedly the pellet which has been\n\nrecovered from the body of the deceased has not been fired from the said\n\nlicensee gun.\n\n34. Learned trial Court has failed to take into consideration that this\n\nvery occurrence the father of the deceased namely, Deo Kumar Choubey\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nhas been convicted by the learned trial Court, which is apparently a\n\nmechanical order and judgment because for one murder there cannot be\n\ntwo different accused when there is case and counter case as such this case\n\nis nothing but abuse of the process of the court.\n\nSubmission of the learned APP for the State\n\n35. The learned APP for the state has refereed factual aspects of the\n\ninvolved in the instant appeals that FIR and complaint were lodged by\n\nthe two disputing groups of the family relating to the same transaction on\n\nthe same day giving their own versions of the incident and the trial\n\nproceeded separately being Sessions Trial No. 228 of 1991 and Sessions\n\nTrial No. 32 of 1999 resulting in two different outcomes in which one\n\ngroup of accused (appellants in Criminal appeal (DB) No.190 of\n\n1994)were convicted for committing murder of the deceased (daughter of\n\nthe appellant namely Deo Kumar Chaubey, appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB)\n\nNo. 114 of 2013) and in the other case, the other group of accused\n\n(appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013 and appellants Cr. Appeal\n\n(SJ) No. 483 of 2013) convicted under Section 323 and further one of the\n\naccused namely Deo Kumar Chaubey [informant in the Cr. appeal (DB)\n\nNo. 190 of 1994 (R)] has been convicted for the culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder for his own daughter (deceased) and accordingly,\n\nsentenced under\nsection 304(1)\nof the IPC, has fairly submitted that since\n\nherein case and counter case and for one murder there is two different\n\naccused as such the instant appeals should be decided as per the wisdom\n\nof the Court.\n\nAnalysis\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n36. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the\n\ndocuments available on record as also the finding recorded by the trial\n\nCourt in the impugned judgment.\n\n37. We have also gone through the testimonies of the witnesses as\n\navailable in the Trial Court Records as also the exhibits appended\n\ntherewith.\n\n38. This Court, before considering the argument advanced on behalf\n\nof the parties would like to discussed the settled connotation of law.\n\n39. It needs to refer herein that the Hon'ble Apex Court in catena of\n\ndecision has propounded the proposition that in the criminal trial, there\n\ncannot be any conviction if the charge is not being proved beyond all\n\nreasonable doubts, as has been held in the case of Rang Bahadur Singh\n\n& Ors. Vrs. State of U.P., reported in (2000) 3 SCC 454, wherein, at\n\nparagraph-22, it has been held as under:-\n\n\"22. The amount of doubt which the Court would entertain\nregarding the complicity of the appellants in this case is much\nmore than the level of reasonable doubt. We are aware that\nacquitting the accused in a case of this nature is not a matter of\nsatisfaction for all concerned. At the same time we remind\nourselves of the time-tested rule that acquittal of a guilty person\nshould be preferred to conviction of an innocent person. Unless\nthe prosecution establishes the guilt of the accused beyond\nreasonable doubt a conviction cannot be passed on the accused.\nA criminal court cannot afford to deprive liberty of the appellants,\nlifelong liberty, without having at least a reasonable level of\ncertainty that the appellants were the real culprits. We really\nentertain doubt about the involvement of the appellants in the\ncrime.\"\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n40. Likewise, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Krishnegowda\n\n& Ors. Vrs. State of Karnataka, reported in (2017) 13 SCC 98, has held\n\nat paragraph-26 as under:-\n\n\"26. Having gone through the evidence of the prosecution\nwitnesses and the findings recorded by the High Court we feel\nthat the High Court has failed to understand the fact that the guilt\nof the accused has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and this\nis a classic case where at each and every stage of the trial, there\nwere lapses on the part of the investigating agency and the\nevidence of the witnesses is not trustworthy which can never be a\nbasis for conviction. The basic principle of criminal\njurisprudence is that the accused is presumed to be innocent until\nhis guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\n41. Further, the principle of 'benefit of doubt' belongs exclusively to\n\ncriminal jurisprudence. The pristine doctrine of 'benefit of doubt' can be\n\ninvoked when there is reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused,\n\nreference in this regard may be made to the judgment rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana Vrs. Bhagirath &\n\nOrs., reported in (1999) 5 SCC 96, wherein, it has been held at paragraph-\n\n7 as under: -\n\n\"7. The High Court had failed to consider the implication of the\nevidence of the two eyewitnesses on the complicity of Bhagirath\nparticularly when the High Court found their evidence reliable.\nThe benefit of doubt was given to Bhagirath \"as a matter of\nabundant caution\". Unfortunately, the High Court did not point\nout the area where there is such a doubt. Any restraint by way of\nabundant caution need not be entangled with the concept of the\nbenefit of doubt. Abundant caution is always desirable in all\nspheres of human activity. But the principle of benefit of doubt\nbelongs exclusively to criminal jurisprudence. The pristine\ndoctrine of benefit of doubt can be invoked when there is\nreasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused. It is the\nreasonable doubt which a conscientious judicial mind entertains\non a conspectus of the entire evidence that the accused might not\nhave committed the offence, which affords the benefit to the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\naccused at the end of the criminal trial. Benefit of doubt is not a\nlegal dosage to be administered at every segment of the evidence,\nbut an advantage to be afforded to the accused at the final end\nafter consideration of the entire evidence, if the Judge\nconscientiously and reasonably entertains doubt regarding the\nguilt of the accused.\"\n\n42. Likewise, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Krishnegowda\n\nv. State of Karnataka (Supra) at paragraph32 and 33 has held as under:-\n\n\"32. --- --- The minor variations and contradictions in the\nevidence of the eyewitnesses will not tilt the benefit of doubt in\nfavour of the accused but when the contradictions in the evidence\nof the prosecution witnesses proves to be fatal to the prosecution\ncase then those contradictions go to the root of the matter and in\nsuch cases the accused gets the benefit of doubt. 33. It is the duty\nof the Court to consider the trustworthiness of evidence on\nrecord. As said by Bentham, \"witnesses are the eyes and ears of\njustice.--- -\n\n43. It needs to refer herein that The Hon'ble Apex Court, in the case\n\nof\nAllarakha K. Mansuri v. State of Gujarat\nreported in (2002) 3 SCC 57\n\nhas laid down the principle that the golden thread which runs through the\n\nweb of administration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\n\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of\n\nthe accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable\n\nto the accused should be adopted, for reference, paragraph 6 thereof\n\nrequires to be referred herein which reads hereunder as :-\n\n\"6. ------The golden thread which runs through the web of\n\nadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are\n\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the\n\nguilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which\n\nis favourable to the accused should be adopted. --\"\n\n44. It needs to refer herein before laying down the aforesaid view,\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nof Maharashtra reported in (1984) 4 SCC 116 has already laid down the\n\nsame view at paragraph 163 which is required to be referred which read\n\nhereunder as\n\n\"163. We then pass on to another important point which seems to\n\nhave been completely missed by the High Court. It is well settled\n\nthat where on the evidence two possibilities are available or open,\n\none which goes in favour of the prosecution and the other which\n\nbenefits an accused, the accused is undoubtedly entitled to the\n\nbenefit of doubt.---\"\n\n45. In the backdrop of the aforesaid settled legal position this Court\n\nis now proceeding to consider the testimonies of witnesses which have\n\nbeen recorded by the learned trial Court.\n\nCriminal appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994\n\n46. It is evident from record that in order to substantiate the case, the\n\nprosecution had altogether examined 15 witnesses and they were PW1-\n\nSumant Kumar Chaubey, PW2-Shardha Devi, PW3-Ramgati Chaubey,\n\nPW4- Parma Singh, PW5- Ramdeo Singh, PW6-Rajendra Kumar\n\nChaubey, PW7- Gopal Misir (claimed to be an eye witness), PW8-Ram\n\nCharitra Choubey, PW9-Uday Shankar Choubey, PW10- Dr. Indreshwar\n\nTiwary (who conducted postmorotem over the body of the deceased),\n\nPW11-Hawildar Mauleshwar Singh, PW12-Deo Kumar Choubey, PW13-\n\nDr. Sita Ram Gupta (who examined PW-12, the injured witness Deo\n\nKumar Choubey), PW14-Biswas Topno and PW15-Iswari Dayal (the\n\nInvestigating Officer).\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n47. At this juncture it would be purposeful to discuss the testimony\n\nof prosecution witnesses in order to answer the issues as referred in the\n\npreceding paragraphs.\n\n48. PW1 Sumant Kumar Choubey has deposed that on 21.2.91 at\n\nabout 2.30 P.M. he was sitting inside his house in the dhawa. His father\n\nwas sitting in the southern dhawa. His brother Rajendra Chaubey,\n\ndeceased sister Nirmala and mother Shardha Devi were also with him. He\n\nsupported the fact that all the accused persons entered into his house.\n\nSeeing them, his father ran into his angan. However, they chased his father\n\nand also went into the angan. Accused Satyendra\n\nChaubey was armed with a country made pistol whereas other three\n\naccused were armed with lathi. Accused Raj Kumar Chaubey caught his\n\nfather and rest three accused began assaulting him with fists and slaps. He\n\nhas, thereafter, deposed on the point of theft of Rs.5000/-. Accused\n\npersons, thereafter, dragged his father to the outer dhawa. However, all\n\nthe inmates also followed them. The accused persons assaulted his father\n\nwith lathi. He has also asserted that Nirmala Kumari had put her arm\n\naround the body of his father. Thereafter, at the instance of accused Raj\n\nKumar Chaubey, Satyendra Chaubey opened fire with his country made\n\nrevolver. His father took a turn giving a jolt and the fire hit Nirmala\n\nKumari near her left ear as a result of which she died. The accused persons,\n\nthereafter, fled away. He has also stated that the accused persons went\n\naway leaving some of their belongings.\n\n49. Attention of this witness has been drawn towards his earlier\n\nstatement before the police in his cross-examination. It appears from para\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n56 of the cross-examination of the Investigating Officer (P.W.15) that this\n\nwitness had not stated before the police that Rajendra Chaubey, Nirmala\n\nKumari and Sharda Devi were also sitting with him. She had also not\n\nstated that on seeing the accused, his father rushed into the angan. He had\n\nalso not stated that accused Raj Kumar Chaubey caught his father and rest\n\naccused assaulted him with fists and slaps. However, he has states that all\n\nthe four accused were assaulting his father in the angan. As stated earlier,\n\nthis witness has not stated about the factum of theft before the\n\nInvestigating Officer. However, in paragraph 16 of his cross-examination,\n\nthis witness asserted that when the accused persons entered into his house,\n\nhe along with his mother, brother and sister were present in the inner\n\nwestern dhawa of the house. In para 17 of the cross-examination, he stated\n\nthat on hearing the foot-steps he came in the southern portion of the\n\nwestern dhawa where his father was sitting. In para 19 of the cross-\n\nexamination, he asserted that after seeing the accused persons, his father\n\nran into the angan. The accused persons also followed his father. In para-\n\n21 of the cross-examination, he has again stated that Satyendra Choubey\n\nwas armed with a country made revolver whereas others were armed with\n\nlathi. This witness has, thereafter, supported the entire prosecution story\n\nin his cross-examination, he has supported the fact that his father sustained\n\nlathi injuries and he was taken in the northern portion of the western dhawa\n\nby the accused persons. In para 26 and 27 of the cross-examination, he\n\nagain asserted that when accused Raj Kumar Chaubey gave order to open\n\nfire, his father was standing inside the main entrance door with his face\n\ntowards south. His sister Nirmala had put her arms around informant's\n\nwaist and was standing left to her father. This witness, his mother and\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nbrothers were also standing in the same dhawa. In para 30 of the cross-\n\nexamination, he has stated that accused Satyendra Chaubey pressed his\n\nrevolver of the chest of his father, but his father took a turn towards west\n\nand deceased Nirmala, came in front of the accused and sustained the fire\n\narm injury near her left ear. In paragraph- 32 of the cross-examination he\n\nhas stated that firing was made from point blank range.\n\n50. PW2 Sardha Devi is wife of the informant (the mother of the\n\ndeceased) who is said to be an eye witness and at the time of occurrence\n\nshe was standing there. She has fully supported the prosecution version.\n\nShe has deposed that on 21.2.91 at 2 PM her husband (informant) was\n\nsitting in the southern portion of the western dhawa when all the four\n\naccused persona entered into her house. Her husband went inside the\n\nangan but the accused persons also chased him. Accused Satyendra\n\nChoubey was armed with a revolver whereas other were armed with lathi.\n\nThey assaulted her husband with fists and slaps. She tried to pacify them,\n\nbut she was also pushed. She has also narrated the story of theft of cash.\n\nShe has further deposed that the accused persons thereafter dragged her\n\nhusband to the southern portion of the western dhawa. The accused\n\npersons were also assaulting him with lathi, but the blow of lathi was\n\nobstructed by the celling of the roof. The accused persons, thereafter, took\n\nher husband to the northern portion of the western dhawa where Raj\n\nKumar Chaubey ordered Satyendra Chaubey to shoot her husband. she has\n\nalso stated that when Satyendra Choubey pointed his country made\n\nrevolver towards her husband, her husband turned towards right and\n\ndeceased Nirmala came in front and sustained fire arm injury near her left\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\near. She fell down and died. Thereafter, the accused persona fled away\n\nleaving some of their belongings. I\n\n51.

In the cross-examination, P.W.2 has asserted that she had raised\n\nhulla, but nobody turned up at the place of occurrence. In para 30 of the\n\ncross-examination, she has stated that there was a chauki towards south of\n\nthe dead body and there was a khatiya adjacent south of the chauki over\n\nwhich cover of Tosak was kept. She has denied the suggestion that at the\n\ntime of occurrence, deceased was standing about 4 to 5 ft. north east from\n\nher father. In para 32 she has also denied a suggestion that her husband\n\nbrought accused Raj Kumar Chaubey from his house and at that time she\n\nand her sons were also accompanying her husband. She has further denied\n\nthat subsequently accused Birendra Chaubey and Binod Chaubey also\n\ncame to rescue their father when the informant stood over the chauki (bed)\n\nwhich was kept in the northern dhawa and pressed his licencee gun\n\ntowards accused Raj Kumar, but in the meantime accused Birendra\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nChoubey turned the barrel of the gun towards east as a result of which the\n\nfire hit Nirmala, who was standing at à distance of 4 to 5 ft. north east\n\nfrom her father.\n\n53.

In\n\nthe meantime, his accused Raj Kumar Chaubey also came out of their\n\nhouse and instigated accused Binod Chaubey and Birendra Chaubey to\n\nassault the informant. In order to save his life, the informant ran away and\n\ntook shelter in the house of Kameshwar in his village.

In para 21, the Investigating Officer stated that he\n\nrecorded the fardbeyan of accused Raj Kumar Chaubey at Referal Hospital\n\non 21.2.91 at 11 PM and on the basis of which he registered a case against\n\nthe informant Deo Kumar Chaubey and others. The Investigating Officer\n\nhas, however, denied that he had met accused Raj Kumar Chaubey at\n\nReferal Hospital on 21.2.91 before 4 PM and had issued requisition for his\n\nmedical examination. He also denied that he had learnt about the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\noccurrence through Raj Kumar Chaubey at that time. The I.O has further\n\nadmitted that he had obtained injury report of Raj Kumar Chaubey from\n\nthe doctor and the doctor has mentioned the time of examination as 4 PM.\n\nThe Investigating Officer has, however, denied that he had learnt about\n\nthe occurrence at Nagar Untari itself through accused Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey, but he did not record the statement of accused Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey. However, the Investigating Officer has admitted that he\n\nregistered Nagar Untari P.S.

However, he has also admitted that\n\nhe did not take trial of the articles seized from the place of occurrence\n\nfrom the accused persons.\n\n72. The Investigating Officer has admitted that he recorded the\n\nstatement of witness Sumant Kumar Chaubey and witness Gopal Mishra\n\non 13.3.91 at the police station. He further admitted that he seized the\n\nlicencee gun of the informant on 22.2.91 in connection with the counter\n\ncase and sent the same to Sargeant Major, Daltonganj for examination. He\n\nalso received the report of the Sargeant Major on 9.3.91.\n\n73. The defence has, also examined five witnesses.\n\n74. DW1 Ashok Singh has proved the fardbeyan and formal FIR of\n\nthe counter-case which have been proved as Ext. B and C respectively.\n\n75. DW2-Raj Kumar Prasad is an advocate's clerk of Garhwa Court.\n\nHe had drafted the protest complaint petition at the instance of accused\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nRaj Kumar Chaubey and gave the same to the typist. After being typed, he\n\ncompared the same with the draft. Accused-Raj Kumar Chaubey put his\n\nsignature on the said complaint petition in his presence.

He has\n\nproved his report as Ext.F. He has asserted that he is a ballistic expert\n\nthough he did not have any diploma or degree in that science however he\n\nhas obtained a certificate in this regard from the Department. He has\n\nhowever, also admitted that only chemical expert could say as to in how\n\nmany days smell evaporates from the gun. He had examined the gun on\n\n9.3.91 i.e. after 16 days of the occurrence. However, he has also stated that\n\nthe gun might have been fired about a week or ten days ago. He has,\n\nhowever, admitted that the gun was not sent to chemical expert for\n\nchemical examination.\n\n78. DW5-Havaldar Awadhes Kumar Singh is a formal witness. He\n\nhas proved the carbon copy of requisition (Ext-G) sent by PW15 to the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nSergeant Major. Police Line, Daltonganj to examine the gun which was\n\nseized in connection with Nagar Untarii PS Case No.25/91 and carbon\n\ncopy of a petition (Ext-H) submitted by PW15 before the Court of the\n\nlearned ACJM, Garhwa, seeking a direction to Sergeant Major, Police\n\nLine, Daltonganj to examine the gun.\n\n79. In the backdrop of the aforesaid settled proposition of law and\n\nafter discussion of testimony of prosecution witnesses this Court in the\n\ninstant appeal is to consider following issues: -\n\n(i)Whether the material as has come in course of trial is\n\nsufficient to attract the ingredients of offence committed under\n\nSection 302\n/\nand\n/\nof the Indian Penal Code against the\n\nappellants? or\n\n(ii) Whether the appellants are entitled for acquittal in absence\n\nof cogent evidences?\n\n80. Since, all the aforesaid issues are inextricably interlinked,\n\ntherefore, the same are being discussed and decided hereinbelow together.\n\n81. The learned senior counsel for the appellant has contended that\n\nthe doctor who has been examined as PW10, as also the Investigating\n\nOfficer has not supported the prosecution story as P.W.10 doctor has\n\nspecifically stated that the material recovered from the wounds of\n\ndeceased were constituent of 12 bore cartridges which is used in gun firing\n\nand they are not used in revolver or pistols. Further the bullet has said to\n\nbe fired from the country made pistol but there is no reference of recovery\n\nof any country made pistol in the seizure memo rather one licensee gun\n\nhas been recovered. It has further been contended that the pellet which\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nhas been found from the body of the deceased has not been fired from the\n\ncountry made pistol thus, the entire prosecution version as recorded in the\n\nFIR wherein it has been reported that the pellet has been fired from the\n\ncountry made pistol itself vitiate the entire prosecution version.\n\n82. The learned senior counsel for the appellant has canvassed that\n\nthe prosecution has failed to explain the injuries on the appellant namely\n\nRaj Kumar Choubey which casts grave doubt on the prosecution story\n\nspecially when the said appellant was examined on police requisition at 4\n\nP.M on 21.02.1991. The learned senior counsel has further emphasized\n\nthat if entire evidence will be taken into consideration it will be apparent\n\nthat none of the prosecution witness has stated about the premeditation\n\namong the accused/appellants and further no evidence has been brought\n\non record in order to establish the common intention among the accused\n\nappellants, therefore the application of\nSection 34\nIPC against all the\n\nappellants amounts miscarriage of justice.\n\n83. At this juncture it would be purposeful to discuss the relevant\n\npart of the testimony of prosecution witnesses as well as FIR in order to\n\nanswer the issues as referred in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n84. From perusal of the FIR, it is evident that on the trivial issue of\n\ngrazing of wheat crops of informant by the buffalo of accused/appellants\n\nalleged occurrence was happened. As per the fardbeyan of the informant\n\nDeo Kumar Chaubey, the appellant Rajkumar Chaubey ((since dead) who\n\nis elder brother of the informant has to his house and instigated his two\n\nsons to assault the informant. The Informant, thereafter, fled away and\n\ntook shelter in the house of Kameshwar Chaubey, a co-villager.\n\nThereafter, the aforesaid three accused persons returned back to their\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nhouse. After two hours, the informant came out of the house of\n\nKameshwar Chaubey and went to his house.\n\n85. It has further been alleged that after 10 to 15 minutes when he\n\nwas sitting on a khatiya (cot), in the main entrance of his house, at about\n\n2.30 to 3 P.M., all the four accused, namely, Raj Kumar Chaubey and his\n\nthree sons namely Binod Chaubey, Satyendra Chaubey and Birendra\n\nChaubey entered into his house through the main door. Accused Satyendra\n\nChaubey was armed with a country made pistol whereas remaining three\n\naccused were armed with lathi. Seeing the accused persons, the informant\n\nwent in the Angan of the house but all the four accused also followed him\n\nand came in the Angan whereas accused Raj Kumar Chaubey caught him\n\nand accused Satyendra Kumar Chaubey and Binod Chaubey began\n\nassaulting him with fists and slaps. and thereafter the accused persons\n\ndragged him and brought him in the main entrance dhaba of the house\n\nwhere accused Birendra Chaubey and Binod Chaudhary tried to assault\n\nhim with lathi, and in the meantime, accused Raj Kumar Chaubey gave\n\norder to kill the informant with the said country made pistol. Thereupon,\n\nSatyendra Chaubey opened fire from his country made revolver with\n\nintent to kill the informant. But the fire missed the target and hit Nirmala\n\nKumari (daughter of the deceased) near her left ear due to this she fell\n\ndown and died instantly.\n\n86. Thus, from the recital of the fardbeyan it is evident that the\n\nalleged occurrence of murder of the deceased daughter was caused by\n\nappellant by firing from country made pistol.\n\n87. At this juncture it will be purposeful to reiterate the testimony of\n\nthe doctor who had conducted post-mortem on the dead body of the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\ndeceased, wherein he has opined that weapon used was fire arms may be\n\ncountry made pistol, in which the 12-bore cartridge was used. But at the\n\nsame time in his cross-examination, he had stated that Cartridges used in\n\nGun and Revolver are different. He had further stated that the material\n\nrecovered from the wound of the deceased while conducting Postmortem\n\nexamination are the constituents of 12 bore cartridges usually used in gun\n\nfiring and these constituents are not found in the cartridges used in\n\nRevolver or Pistol.\n\n88. At this juncture it needs to refer herein that this Court is\n\nconscious with the settled legal position that where there is a contradiction\n\nbetween medical evidence and ocular evidence, the ocular testimony of a\n\nwitness has greater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence, but at\n\nthe same time it is equally settled position that when medical evidence\n\nmakes the ocular testimony improbable, then it becomes a relevant factor\n\nin the process of the evaluation of evidence and when the medical\n\nevidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular\n\nevidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved. Reference in\n\nthis regard may be made to the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of\nBhajan Singh v. State of Haryana\n, (2011) 7 SCC\n\n421 , the relevant paragraph of the aforesaid judgment is being quoted as\n\nunder:\n\n38. Thus, the position of law in such a case of contradiction between\nmedical and ocular evidence can be crystallised to the effect that\nthough the ocular testimony of a witness has greater evidentiary value\nvis-à-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence makes the ocular\ntestimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the process\nof the evaluation of evidence. However, where the medical evidence\ngoes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular\nevidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n89. The aforesaid same view has been reiterated by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of\nCBI v. Mohd. Parvez Abdul Kayuum\n, (2019)\n\n12 SCC 1 wherein it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court which\n\nreads as under:\n\n57. ----It is not a case where medical evidence completely\nimprobabilises the ocular evidence; only\nin that case\nthe ocular\nevidence has to be discarded, not otherwise.\n\nReliance has been placed\non behalf of the accused on\nAbdul Sayeed v. State of M.P. [Abdul\nSayeed\nv. State of M.P., (2010) 10 SCC 259 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1262]\nthus: (SCC p. 274, para 39)\n\"39. Thus, the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction\nbetween medical evidence and ocular evidence can be crystallised to\nthe effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater\nevidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence\nmakes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor\nin the process of the evaluation of evidence. However, where the\nmedical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility\nof the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be\ndisbelieved.\"\n\n90. In the instant case, it has come on record that there is no recovery\n\nof any country made pistol or revolver from the place of occurrence or\n\nfrom conscious possession of the appellants herein. Further herein the\n\nmedical evidence completely rules out all possibility of the ocular\n\nevidence being true as such the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.\n\n91. Thus, from the aforesaid it is evident that the aforesaid factum\n\nof firing from the country made pistol has not been proved by the\n\nprosecution against the present appellants beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n92. Further, since the learned trial court by taking aid of the\nSection\nof the IPC has convicted the present appellants for the alleged offence,\n\ntherefore at this juncture it would be apt to discuss the ingredients of\n\nSection 34\nof the IPC.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n93. It needs to refer herein that under the provisions of\nSection 34\n\nthe essence of the liability is to be found in the existence of a common\n\nintention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in\n\nfurtherance of such intention. As a result of the application of principles\n\nenunciated in\nSection 34\n, when an accused is convicted under Section\n\n302 read with\nSection 34\n, in law it means that the accused is liable for\n\nthe act which caused death of the deceased in the same manner as if it\n\nwas done by him alone. The provision is intended to meet a case in\n\nwhich it may be difficult to distinguish between acts of individual\n\nmembers of a party who act in furtherance of the common intention of\n\nall or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them.\n\n94. Thus, from the aforesaid settled position of law it is evident that\n\nSection 34\nhas been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the doing\n\nof a criminal act. The section is only a rule of evidence and does not\n\ncreate a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the section is the\n\nelement of participation in action. The liability of one person for an\n\noffence committed by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated\n\nby several persons arises under\nSection 34\nif such criminal act is done\n\nin furtherance of a common intention of the persons who join in\n\ncommitting the crime.\n\n95. In order to bring home the charge of common intention, the\n\nprosecution has to establish by evidence, whether direct or\n\ncircumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of minds of all the accused\n\npersons to commit the offence for which they are charged with the aid\n\nof\nSection 34\n, be it prearranged or on the spur of the moment; but it must\n\nnecessarily be before the commission of the crime.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n96. The true contents of the section are that if two or more persons\n\nintentionally do an act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if\n\neach of them has done it individually by himself. The existence of a\n\ncommon intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential\n\nelement for application of this section. It is not necessary that the acts of\n\nthe several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must\n\nbe the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character,\n\nbut must have been actuated by one and the same common intention in\n\norder to attract the provision.\n\n97. Further, the burden lies on the prosecution to prove that actual\n\nparticipation of more than one person for commission of criminal act\n\nwas done in furtherance of common intention of all at a prior concert.\n\nHowever, it is not required for the prosecution to establish that there was\n\na prior conspiracy or premeditation; common intention can be found in\n\nthe course of occurrence.\n\n98. To apply\nSection 34\napart from the fact that there should be two\n\nor more accused, two factors must be established: (i) common intention,\n\nand (ii) participation of the accused in the commission of an offence. If\n\ncommon intention is proved but no overt act is attributed to the\n\nindividual accused,\nSection 34\nwill be attracted as essentially it involves\n\nvicarious liability. But if participation of the accused in the crime is\n\nproved and common intention is absent,\nSection 34\ncannot be invoked\n\nreference in this regard may be taken from the judgment rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nJai Bhagwan v. State of\n\nHaryana\n(1999) 3 SCC 102.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n99. As held by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nin\nMohan Singh v. State of Punjab\nAIR 1963 SC 174, common\n\nintention denotes action in concert, and a prior meeting of minds--the\n\nacts may be different, and may vary in their character, but they are all\n\nactuated by the same common intention. However, prior concert in the\n\nsense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved. The\n\ncommon intention to bring about a particular result may well develop on\n\nthe spot as between a number of persons. Thus, the question as to\n\nwhether there is any common intention or not depends upon the\n\ninference to be drawn from the proven facts and circumstances of each\n\ncase. The totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration\n\nin arriving at the conclusion whether the accused persons had the\n\ncommon intention to commit the offence with which they could be\n\nconvicted.\n\n100. In the aforesaid backdrop of the settled position of law that, this\n\nCourt has revisited the entire testimony including the material available\n\non record wherefrom it is evident that none of the witnesses had stated\n\nin their examination-in-chief that the present appellant having common\n\nintention to kill the deceased. Therefore, in the aforesaid settled position\n\nof law as discussed in preceding paragraph this Court is of the view that\n\nthe presents appellants having no common intention or premeditation of\n\nmind before the commission of alleged crime.\n\n101. Further it is evident from the record that the persons of both sides\n\ni.e. informant as well as appellant Raj Kumar Choubey (since dead) have\n\nsustained injuries and both have been medically examined on the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nrequisition of the police and their injuries report have marked as\n\nannexure. From the aforesaid factual aspect, inference may be\n\nwithdrawn that it is case of free fight on the trivial issue i.e. grazing of\n\nwheat crop of the informant by the animal of the appellants and it is\n\nsettled position of law that in the case of free fight, the ingredients of\n\nSection 34\nof the IPC have no application.\n\n102. Since this Court has come with the finding in the preceding\n\nparagraph that the factum of firing by the appellant namely Satyendra\n\nChoubey by the alleged country made pistol has not been established\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt, therefore it is of the considered view of this\n\nCourt that appellants cannot be convicted for the offence under\nSection\n/\nIPC.\n\n103. So far as the conviction under\nsection 307\n/\nof the IPC is\n\nconcerned, it needs to refer herein that the persons of both sides i.e.\n\ninformant as well as appellant Raj Kumar Choubey (since dead) have\n\nsustained injuries and both have been medically examined on the\n\nrequisition of the police and their injuries report have been marked as\n\nannexure before the learned trial court.\n\n104. At this juncture it would be apt to referred herein the\nSection 307\n\nIPC which reads as under:\n\n\"307. Attempt to murder.--Whoever does any act with such intention\nor knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act\ncaused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten\nyears, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person\nby such act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life,\nor to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nAttempts by life convicts. --When any person offending under this\nsection is under sentence of imprisonment for life, he may, if hurt is\ncaused, be punished with death.\n\n105. The first part of Section 307 refers to \"an act with such intention\n\nor knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused\n\ndeath, he would be guilty of murder\". The second part of Section 307,\n\nwhich carries a heavier punishment, refers to \"hurt\" caused in pursuance\n\nof such an \"act\".\n\n106.\nIn\nState of Maharashtra v. Balram Bama Patil [State of\n\nMaharashtra\nv. Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has observed that it is not necessary that a bodily injury sufficient\n\nunder normal circumstances to cause death should have been inflicted, for\n\nready reference the relevant paragraph is being quoted as under:\n\n\"9. ... To justify a conviction under this section it is not essential that\nbodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted.\nAlthough the nature of injury actually caused may often give\nconsiderable assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the\naccused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances,\nand may even, in some cases, be ascertained without any reference at\nall to actual wounds. The section makes a distinction between an act of\nthe accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be attended by\nany result so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but still there\nmay be cases in which the culprit would be liable under this section. It\nis not necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of the\nassault should be sufficient under ordinary circumstances to cause the\ndeath of the person assaulted. What the Court has to see is whether the\nact, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge\nand under circumstances mentioned in this section. An attempt in order\nto be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if\nthere is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution\nthereof.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n107.\nIn\nState of M.P. v. Saleem\n, (2005) 5 SCC 554, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has held which reads as under:\n\n\"13. It is sufficient to justify a conviction under Section 307 if there is\npresent an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof. It is\nnot essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have\nbeen inflicted. The section makes a distinction between the act of the\naccused and its result, if any. The court has to see whether the act,\nirrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and\nunder circumstances mentioned in the section. Therefore, an accused\ncharged under\nSection 307\nIPC cannot be acquitted merely because the\ninjuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.\"\n\n108.\nIn\nJage Ram v. State of Haryana\n(2015) 11 SCC 366, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has held that to establish the commission of an\n\noffence under Section 307, it is not essential that a fatal injury capable of\n\ncausing death should have been inflicted, for ready reference the relevant\n\nparagraph is being quoted as under:\n\n\"12. For the purpose of conviction under\nSection 307\nIPC, the\nprosecution has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder; and (ii)\nthe act done by the accused. The burden is on the prosecution that the\naccused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness.\nWhether the accused person intended to commit murder of another\nperson would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\nTo justify a conviction under\nSection 307\nIPC, it is not essential that\nfatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused.\nAlthough the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in\ncoming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention\nmay also be adduced from other circumstances. The intention of the\naccused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the\nweapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident,\nmotive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused\nand the nature of injury and severity of the blows given, etc.\"\n\n109. It is evident from the aforesaid settled proposition of law that\n\nproof of grievous or life-threatening hurt is not a sine qua non for the\n\noffence under Section 307 of the Penal Code and the intention of the\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\naccused can be ascertained from the actual injury, if any, as well as from\n\nsurrounding circumstances. Among other things, the nature of the weapon\n\nused and the severity of the blows inflicted can be considered to infer\n\nintent.\n\n110. Thus, it is apparent that whoever does any act, with the intention\n\nor knowledge, which may cause death and in furtherance to the said\n\nintention and knowledge, he was doing an act towards it. However, it is\n\nrequired to be seen by the evidence brought on record by the prosecution\n\nwhether the ingredients to prove, the case of prosecution beyond\n\nreasonable doubt, the charge under\nSections 307\nIPC have been\n\nestablished.\n\n111. The essential difference between the offence punishable under\n\nSection 307\nIPC and\nSection 302\nIPC is that the offence under\nsection 307\n\nIPC is not culpable homicide; the victim finally survives. What is required\n\nby the prosecution to establish is that the accused had necessary intention\n\nor knowledge that if successfully effected the alleged act would have\n\ncaused death.\nIn \"\nState of Maharashtra v. Kashirao\n\" reported in (2003)\n\n10 SCC 434, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under;\n\n\"20. ....... \"The essential ingredients required to be proved in the case\nof an offence under section 307 are:\n\n(i) that the death of a human being was attempted;\n\n(ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence\nof the act of the accused; and\n\n(iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death; or that\nit was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as: (a) the\naccused knew to be likely to cause death; or (b) was sufficient in the\nordinary course of nature to cause death, or that the accused attempted\nto cause death by doing an act known to him to be so imminently\ndangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or (b) such\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nbodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no excuse\nfor incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.\"\n\n112. In the backdrop of the aforesaid settled proposition of law, now\n\nwe are adverting to the facts of the case in hand in order to find out\n\nwhether the alleged acts of the appellants come under the purview of\n\nattempt to murder or not.\n\n113. In the aforesaid context it would be purposeful to reiterate the\n\ntestimony of the doctor (PW13) who had examined the injured\n\ninformant which has been referred as under:\n\n(i) one abrasion 1\" x ½\" / subcutaneous thickness on the lower\npart of the right knee joint.\n\n(ii) Abrasion ½ \" x ½\" x subcutaneous thickness on the lower part\nof the left knee joint.\n\n(iii) Bruise 1\" x 1 \" x on the lower part of the left nipple.\n\niv) Bruise 1\" x 1\" x on the dorsal aspect of right foot.\n\n114. This witness has categorically opined that all the injuries were\n\nsimple in nature caused by hard and blunt substance such as lathi. Thus\n\nfrom the aforesaid it is evident that injuries which was caused by the\n\nappellants upon the injured informant was simple in nature and caused by\n\nthe lathi, therefore it can be safely inferred that in the alleged commission\n\nof crime the requisite ingredients of Section 307 as discussed hereinabove\n\nis not available as such the conviction of the present appellants under\n\nsection 307\nof IPC is also not sustainable herein.\n\n115. However, it has come one record that the appellants namely\n\nVinod Kumar Choubey and Virendra Kumar Choubey having lathi at the\n\ntime of alleged commission of crime and all the prosecution witnesses had\n\nspecifically stated that assault by lathi was made by the aforesaid son of\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nthe Raj Kumar Choubey. Thus, the aforesaid statement of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses particularly informant on this point i.e. assault made with lathi\n\nby the aforesaid appellants Vinod Kumar Choubey and Virendra Kumar\n\nChoubey upon him, has fully corroborated by the testimony of P.W.13 i.e.\n\nDoctor who had examined the injured informant.\n\n116. On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, it is considered view of\n\nthis Court that appellants namely Vinod Kumar Choubey and Virendra\n\nKumar Choubey has committed the offence under\nsection 321\nof the IPC\n\npunishable under\nSection 323\nof the IPC.\n\n117. The present appellants have been convicted under\nSection 452\n\nand\nIPC by the learned trial Court. In the aforesaid context it requires\n\nto refer herein the\nSection 452\nand\nIPC, which has been quoted as\n\nunder:\n\n\"452.Whoever commits house-trespass, having made\npreparation for causing hurt to any person or for assaulting any\nperson, or for wrongfully restraining any person, or for putting\nand person in fear of hurt, or of assault, or of wrongful restraint,\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a\nterm which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to\nfine.\n\n341. Whoever wrongfully restrains any person shall be punished\nwith simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one\nmonth, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or\nwith both.\"\n\n118. Thus from the perusal of the aforesaid sections it is evident that\n\nWhoever commits house-trespass, having made preparation for causing\n\nhurt to any person or for assaulting any person, or for wrongfully\n\nrestraining any person, or for putting and person in fear of hurt, or of\n\nassault, or of wrongful restraint shall be punished with imprisonment of\n\neither description for a term which may extend to seven years.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n119. From perusal of the entire evidence on record it is the evident\n\nthat it the case of free fight between the close cognate and for same\n\ntransaction case and counter case was instituted. Further none of witnesses\n\nhas stated that they were wrongfully restrain by the present appellants,\n\ntherefore it is considered view of this Court the conviction of the present\n\nappellants under the\nSection 452\nof the IPC is not sustainable herein.\n\n120. Further it has come on record that there is no recovery of the\n\nalleged country made pistol which has been alleged to be used in the said\n\noffence and in the preceding paragraph this Court has categorically held\n\nthat the use of said country made pistol in alleged commission of crime is\n\ndoubtful, as such it is considered view of this Court that the conviction of\n\nthe present appellants under\nSection 27\nArms Act is also not sustainable\n\nherein.\n\nCriminal appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013 and Criminal appeal (SJ) No.\n\n483 of 2013.\n\n121. As referred hereinabove the aforesaid appeals have been\n\npreferred against the conviction dated 13.02.2013 and the order of\n\nsentence dated 19.02.2013 passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-1st,\n\nGarhwa in S.T. No. 32 of 1999 whereby and whereunder the appellants,\n\nabove-named, have been convicted under\nsections 323\nIPC. The convict-\n\nappellant, namely, Deo Kumar Chaubey in Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 114\n\nof 2013 has also been convicted under\nsection 304(1)\nIPC.\n\n122. While convicting the appellants of the Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 483\n\nof 2013, the learned trial Court has opined that since the appellants,\n\nnamely, Sumant Kumar Chaubey and Rajendra Kumar Chaubey are first\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\noffenders as not previous conviction has been proved on record against\n\nthem, as such, they have been granted benefit of the\nProbation of\n\nOffenders Act\nand they were directed to be released on furnishing a\n\nprobation bond of Rs.5000/- with two sureties which will be for\n\nmaintaining good conduct for two years.\n\n123. While sentencing the sole appellant of the Cr. Appeal (DB) No.\n\n114 of 2013, namely, Deo Kumar Chaubey the learned trial Court has\n\nawarded sentence to undergo RI for 10 years under\nsection 304(1)\nof the\n\nIndian Penal Code with a fine of Rs.5,000/- and sentenced to fine of Rs.\n\n5,000/- under\nsection 323\nIPC and in default of payment of fine, he is\n\ndirected to undergo SI for 1 month.\n\n124. At this juncture it would be purposeful to discuss the testimony\n\nof prosecution witnesses in order to answer the issues as referred in the\n\npreceding paragraphs.\n\n125. It is evident from record that in order to substantiate the case, the\n\nprosecution had altogether examined 09 witnesses and they were PW.1\n\nRamdhyan Pal, PW.2 Binod Kumar Chaubey, who is the son of the\n\ncomplainant Raj Kumar Chaubey, PW.3 Ramcharitar Chaubey, PW4-\n\nDinesh Kumar Chaubey, PW.5 Raj Kishor Chaubey, PW.6 Virendra\n\nChaubey, PW.7 Raj Kumar Chaubey (complainant/informant), PW.8\n\nKrishna Tiwary has proved the report of Sergeant Major Rajdeo Rai, Ext.6\n\nand PW.9 Mirtunjay Dubey has stated that he did not know about the\n\noccurrence and he has been declared hostile.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n126. PW.1 Ramdhyan Pal has proved the signature of Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey on the protest petition, Ext. 1. He has further proved the signature\n\nof the counsel of the Raj Kumar Chaubey Ext.1/1 also.\n\n127. PW.2 Binod Kumar Chaubey, who is the son of the complainant\n\nRaj Kumar Chaubey, has stated that the occurrence took place on\n\n21.02.91, Thursday, at about 2 to 2.30 P.M. He was in his village. He heard\n\nhallah of his father, who was saying for saving him, he came near his\n\nhouse and saw that Dev Kumar Chaubey, Sumant Chaubey, Rajendra\n\nChaubey and Shardha Devi were bringing his father towards their house,\n\nbeating him. Deo Kumar Chaubey was armed with gun and Sumant and\n\nRajendra were armed with lathi. He tried to save his father. In the\n\nmeantime, his younger brother also came and he also tried to save his\n\nfather. Accused Deo Kumar Chaubey went his Varan dah and fired the\n\ngun for killing Raj Kumar Chaubey. In the meantime, Nirmala Kumari\n\naged about 11-12 years, the daughter of the accused Deo Kumar Chaubey,\n\ncame there and the cartridge shoot her and she died at the spot. If Nirmala\n\nwould have not come, the cartridge would have hit Raj Kumar Chaubey.\n\nHe and his brother brought his father to his house. His father had got head\n\ninjury. They went to the police station thereafter.\n\n128. PW.3 Ramcharitar Chaubey has stated that occurrence took place\n\non 21.02.91 at about 2 to 2.30 P.M. It was Thursday, on that day, he was\n\ngoing to Sonpura to see nee the 'yajna'. When he reached near the door of\n\nSunil Tiwary, he saw that there was abusing at the door of Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey. Deo Kumar Chaubey, Sumant Chaubey, Rajendra Chaubey and\n\nShardha Devi were abusing. Deo Kumar Chaubey was armed with gun\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nand Sumant Chaubey and Rajendra Chaubey were armed with lathi. When\n\nRaj Kamar Chaubey came out of his house, Sumant Chaubey and Rajendra\n\nbeat him by lathi and he got head injury. Deo Kumar Chaubey told them\n\nto bring Raj Kumar Chaubey and he would kill him. Thereafter, they were\n\nbringing Raj Kumar Chaubey in their dhaba. Raj Kumar Chaubey raised\n\nhallah to save him, In the meantime, both sons of Raj Kumar Chaubey\n\nnamely Vinod Chaubey and Birendra Chaubey, he and other persons came\n\nthere. Both the sons caught his father. Thereafter, Deo Kumar Chaubey\n\nwent in his dhaba with his gun. In the meantime, Vimla, the daughter of\n\nDev Kumar Chaubey, came after seeing the yajana and she reached\n\nbetween Dev Kimar Chaubey and Raj Kumar Chaubey. In the meantime,\n\nDeo Kumar Chaubey fired the gun which hit the girl and she died.\n\n129. PW.4 Dinesh Kumar Chaubey has stated that occurrence took\n\nplace on 21.02.91 at about 2 to 2.30 P.M. It was Thursday. He was in\n\nSonpurwa 'yajna'. He came to know that there was quarrel between both\n\nthe brothers namely Deo Kumar Chaubey and Raj Kumar Chaubey and\n\nfire was also done. Thereafter, he came to the place of occurrence. When\n\nhe reached, the occurrence had taken place. He saw that on the door of\n\nDeo Kumar Chaubey, the dead body of his daughter Nirmala Kumari was\n\nlying. The cartridge has pierced in the left kanpatti. He had heard that\n\ncartridge from gun of Deo Kumar Chaubey hit the girl.\n\n130. PW.5 Raj Kishor Chaubey has stated that the occurrence took\n\nplace on 21.02.91 at about 2 to 2.30 P.M. At that time, he was going to\n\nbazzar. At the door of Deo Kumar Chaubey, there was halla Gulla. He\n\nreached there and saw that Dev Kumar Chaubey, Rajendra Chaubey and\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nSumant Chaubey were pulling Raj Kumar Chaubey and were telling that\n\nkill him after carrying. Deo Kumar Chaubey was armed with double barrel\n\ngun. Sumant and Rajendra were armed with lathi. They carried away Raj\n\nKumar Chaubey at their door.

The cattle of Raj\n\nKumar Chaubey had entered in the field of Deo Kumar Chaubey. due to\n\nit, they were pulling Raj Kumar Chaubey at their door. Raj Kumar\n\nChaubey had got injury. Therefore, he had also gone to the P.S. with him,\n\nDinesh Chaubey had gone later on. Raj Kumar Chaubey had given\n\nstatement to the Daroga.\n\n131. PW.6 Virendra Chaubey is another son of the complainant Raj\n\nKumar Chaubey, He has stated that the occurrence took place on 21.02.91.\n\nIt was Thursday. It was 2 to 2.30 P.M. He was in his village. He heard the\n\nvoice of his father, who was telling to save him. He went towards his house\n\nand saw that Deo Kumar Chaubey, Sumant Kumar Chaubey and Rajendra\n\nKumar Chaubey @ Susu and Shardha Devi were bringing his father\n\ntowards their house beating him. He tried to save him. The head of his\n\nfather had injured. There were abrasions on his entire body. Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey became angry and fired from his gun, which hit his own daughter\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nNirmala Kumari in place of his father. The daughter died there. He brought\n\nhis father to his house. Thereafter they went to Nagar Untari Police\n\nStation. His father gave statement at the police station, thereafter he sent\n\nHospital where his treatment was done.\n\n132. PW.7 Raj Kumar Chaubey is the complainant/injured himself.\n\nHe has stated that occurrence took place on 21.02.91 at about 2 to 2.30\n\nP.M. On that day at about 10 to 11 P.M. one of his cattle had an entered\n\nin the field of wheat crop of the accused Deo Kumar Chaubey. Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey, with his double barrel gun, went to his field and started to abuse\n\nhim taking his name. He went there and forbade him from abusing. He\n\ntold him as to what loss has been caused to him, he may take the same or\n\nto carry the cattle to kani house. Both of them return to their house.\n\n133. He had further deposed that on that day at about 2 to 2.30 P.M.\n\naccused Deo Kumar Chaubey armed with his double barrel gun and his\n\nson Sumant Chaubey and Susu Chaubey @ Rajendra Chaubey armed with\n\nlathi and Shardha Devi came to his door and started to abuse him. He came\n\nafter hearing the abuse and forbade them from abusing. On it, he pointed\n\nthe gun towards him. In the meantime, one of the sons of Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey beat him from the back side on his head and he fell down.\n\nThereafter, Rajendra Chaubey and Sumant Chaubey caught him and were\n\ntrying to pull him towards their door. On his hallah, his sons Birendra\n\nChaubey and Vinod Chaubey reached there and they tried to pull him and\n\nboth the sons of Deo Kumar Chaubey pulling him towards them. Due to\n\nit, Deo Kamar Chaubey became angry and from some distance fired the\n\ngun towards him with intent to kill him. In the meantime, his daughter\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nNirmala Kamari came there and the gun hit her. She fell there. On it, the\n\naccused persons started to see the girl leaving him. His sons brought him\n\nto his house. He went to P.S. where; he gave his statement at about 03.30\n\nΡ.Μ. and told him the entire occurrence. The police issued a memo and\n\nsent him to the Referal Hospital for treatment. The police had written his\n\nstatement but what was written by him, he could not know. Later on, he\n\ncame to know that police have written the entire statement. His statement\n\nwas done in the in Hospital. His statement was written at 03.30 P.M.\n\nThereafter he said that his statement was written at 10.30 P.M. also in the\n\nHospital, which was written wrongly. He was arrested by the police\nu/s\nI.P.C. and remanded to jail custody. It was a false case by Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey. He was in jail till one and a half month\nin that case\n. When he\n\ncame out from the jail and he got copy of the case, he came to know that\n\ncase was weakened. Thereafter, he filed complaint case.\n\n134. The learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the\n\nprosecution version as recorded in the FIR, subject matter of Criminal\n\nAppeal (DB) No.190 of 1994 (R) is also required to be taken into\n\nconsideration wherein the prosecution version is that the pellet has been\n\nfired from the country made pistol while the recovery is of a licensee gun\n\nbelongs to Deo Kumar Chaudhary, one of the appellants in these appeals,\n\nbut admittedly the pellet which has been recovered from the body of the\n\ndeceased has not been fired from the said licensee gun.\n\n135. It has further been contended that learned trial Court has failed\n\nto take into consideration that this very occurrence the father of the\n\ndeceased namely, Deo Kumar Choubey has been convicted by the learned\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\ntrial Court, which is apparently a mechanical judgment because for one\n\nmurder there cannot be two different accused when there is case and\n\ncounter case as such this case is nothing but abuse of the process of the\n\ncourt.\n\n136. In the backdrop of the aforesaid settled proposition of law and\n\nafter discussion of testimony of prosecution witnesses as well as\n\ncontention of the learned counsel for the appellants this Court in these\n\nappeals is to consider following issues: -\n\n(i)Whether the material as has come in course of trial is\n\nsufficient to attract the ingredients of offence committed under\n\nSection 304(1)\nof the Indian Penal Code against the appellants\n\nnamely Deo Kumar Chaubey? or\n\n(ii) Whether the appellants are entitled for acquittal in absence\n\nof cogent evidences?\n\n137. Since, all the aforesaid issues are inextricably interlinked,\n\ntherefore, the same are being discussed and decided hereinbelow together.\n\n138. Herein as per the complaint-cum-protest petition, wherein it has\n\nbeen alleged that on 21.02.91 at about 01.30 PM bullock of the\n\ncomplainant (accused/appellant in Criminal Appeal (DB) No.190 of 1994\n\n(R)) had grazed the wheat crops of the accused Deo Kumar Chaubey\n\n(appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013) from his field. Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey @ Onkar Chaubey, armed with Licence gun, went to the wheat\n\nfield and started to abuse.\n\n139. On the same day at about 02.00 P.M., the accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey @ Onkar Chaubey, his son Rajendra Chaubey @ Susu Chaubey,\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nSumant Chaubey and his wife Shardha Devi came at the door of the\n\ncomplainant and started to abuse him and when the complainant came out\n\nof his house and tried to get understand them, the accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey pointed the gun upon him.\n\n140. In the meantime, one of the sons of Deo Kumar Chaubey assaulted him\n\nfrom the back side on his head and he fell down. and When Binod\n\nChaubey, Birendra Chaubey (sons of the complainant) saw him they came\n\nthere and tried to save their father.\n\n141. In the meantime, a fire took place from the gun of Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey, which hit Nirmala Kumari, the daughter of the accused Deo\n\nKumar Chaubey. The accused persons started to see Nirmala Kumari. In\n\nthe meantime, both the sons of the complainant brought him to their house.\n\n142. Thus, from the factual aspect it is evident that there is allegation\n\nagainst the Deo Kumar Choubey that he had fired his gun during the said\n\nfeud which hit Nirmala Kumari, the daughter of the accused Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey and the said Nirmala Kumari, died on the spot instantly.\n\n143. It has further come on the investigation that the gun of the\n\nappellant Deo Kumar Chaubey has been sent for the examination to the\n\nballistic expert. Further, PW.8 Krishna Tiwary has proved the report of\n\nSergeant Major Rajdeo Rai which has been marked as Ext.6.\n\n144. From perusal of the report of Sergeant Major, it is evident that he\n\nhad examined one regular D.B.B.L. gun which was seized in connection\n\nwith Nagar Untari P.S.Case No.24/91 (Session Trial No. 228 of 1991)\n\nand he found that firing was done from both barrels, of the gun in the\n\nrecent past. He has however, also admitted that only chemical expert could\n\nsay as to in how many days smell evaporates from the gun. He had\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nexamined the gun on 9.3.91 i.e. after 16 days of the occurrence. However,\n\nhe has also stated that the gun might have been fired about a week or ten\n\ndays ago. He has, however, admitted that the gun was not sent to chemical\n\nexpert for chemical examination.\n\n145. Thus, from the aforesaid factual aspect it is evident that one\n\nregular D.B.B.L. gun which was seized in connection with Nagar Untari\n\nP.S.Case No.24/91 (Session Trial No. 228 of 1991), but in the said report\n\nit has not come that the material i.e. one plastic piece and 44 metalic\n\npieces, which has been found from the brain matter and the cavity , has\n\nactually been fired from the said gun, therefore in absence of such finding\n\nit cannot be stated that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge.\n\nunder\nsection 304(1)\nof the IPC against the appellant Deo kumar Chaubey\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n\n146. At this juncture it needs to refer herein that the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has categorically held in the case of\nRavi Sharma v. State (NCT of\n\nDelhi\n), (2022) 8 SCC 536 that the report of the ballistic expert is\n\nobviously scientific evidence in the nature of an opinion. It is required to\n\nuse this evidence along with the other substantive piece of evidence\n\navailable on record, for ready reference the relevant paragraph of the\n\naforesaid judgment is being quoted as under:\n\n\"19. The report of the ballistic expert is obviously a scientific evidence\nin the nature of an opinion. It is required to use this evidence along with\nthe other substantive piece of evidence available. The report is\ninconclusive with respect to the firearm belonging to the appellant\nbeing used for committing the offence.\"\n\n147. Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the almost similar\n\ncircumstances which is available herein has observed in the case of\n\nSukhwant Singh v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 3 SCC 367 that where injuries\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nare caused by firearms, the opinion of the ballistic expert is of a\n\nconsiderable importance where both the firearm and the crime cartridge\n\nare recovered during the investigation to connect an accused with the\n\ncrime. Failure to produce the expert opinion before the trial court in such\n\ncases affects the creditworthiness of the prosecution case to a great extent.\n\nFor ready reference the relevant paragraph of the aforesaid judgment is\n\nbeing quoted as under:\n\n21. There is yet another infirmity in this case. We find that whereas an\nempty had been recovered by PW 6, ASI Raghubir Singh from the spot\nand a pistol along with some cartridges were seized from the possession\nof the appellant at the time of his arrest, yet the prosecution, for reasons\nbest known to it, did not send the recovered empty and the seized pistol\nto the ballistic expert for examination and expert opinion. Comparison\ncould have provided link evidence between the crime and the accused.\n\nThis again is an omission on the part of the prosecution for which no\nexplanation has been furnished either in the trial court or before us. It\nhardly needs to be emphasised that in cases where injuries are caused\nby firearms, the opinion of the ballistic expert is of a considerable\nimportance where both the firearm and the crime cartridge are\nrecovered during the investigation to connect an accused with the\ncrime. Failure to produce the expert opinion before the trial court in\nsuch cases affects the creditworthiness of the prosecution case to a\ngreat extent.\n\n148. Now re-adverting to fact of the instant case it is evident that there\n\nis no cogent evidence available on record to prove that the appellant\n\nnamely Deo Kumar Chaubey was the author of the gunshot which killed\n\nNirmala Kumari (daughter of appellant/accused namely Deo Kumar\n\nChaubey). Further, the ballistic report did not support the prosecution case\n\nsubstantially as there is no finding in the said report regarding the pellets\n\n(metallic ball) found in the brain matter of deceased, has been fired from\n\nthe said Gun belonging to the appellant.\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n149. Thus, even at the cost of repetition, this Court is of considered\n\nview that there was no evidence on record suggestive of the inference\n\nwhich was drawn by the learned trial Judge against the present appellant\n\nnamely Deo Kumar Chaubey (appellant in Criminal Appeal (DB)No. 114\n\nof 2013) that he was author of the shot that hit and killed the deceased\n\nNirmala Kumari, therefore the conviction of the appellant namely Deo\n\nKumar Chaubey under Section 304 (1) is not sustainable herein.\n\n150. So far as the conviction of the appellants (Cr. Appeal (DB) No.\n\n114 of 2013 and Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 483 of 2013) under\nSection 323\nof\n\nthe IPC is concerned it is evident that the persons of both sides i.e.\n\ncomplainant Raj Kumar Choubey (since dead) and the appellant Deo\n\nKumar Chaubey have sustained simple injuries and both have been\n\nmedically examined on the requisition of the police and their injuries\n\nreport have been marked as annexure before the learned trial court.\n\n151. Therefore, on the basis of discussion made hereinabove, this\n\nCourt is of the considered view that the conviction of the appellants (Cr.\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013 and Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 483 of 2013) by\n\nthe learned trial Court under\nSection 323\nof the IPC requires no\n\ninterference.\n\nConclusion\n\nCr. Appeal (DB) No. 190 of 1994(R)\n\n152. Thus, on the basis of discussion made hereinabove it is\n\nconsidered view of this Court that the conviction of the appellants of the\n\nCr. Appeal (DB) No. 190 of 1994 (R) under\nsections 452\n,\n,\n/\n,\n/\nof the IPC is not sustainable in the fact and circumstances of the\n\ninstant case, therefore the appellants of Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 190 of 1994\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\n(R) are hereby acquitted from all the charges. Further the appellant,\n\nnamely, Satyendra Choubey has also been acquitted from the charge under\n\nsection 27\nof the Arms Act.\n\n153. Since, this Court has found that the appellants of Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 190 of 1994 (R), namely, Vinod Kumar Choubey and Virendra\n\nKumar Choubey guilty for the offence under\nsection 321\nof the IPC\n\npunishable under\nSection 323\nof the IPC, accordingly they have been\n\nsentenced for the period already undergone by them.\n\n154. This Court, therefore, is of the view based upon the discussions\n\nmade hereinabove, that the impugned judgment (assailed in Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 190 of 1994) needs interference, accordingly, the judgment of\n\nconviction and the order of sentence both dated 30.11.1994 passed by the\n\nlearned 4th Addl. Sessions Judge, Palamu, Daltonganj in Sessions Trial\n\nNo. 228 of 1991 is hereby quashed and set aside.\n\n155. Since from the record it is evident that appellants of Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 190 of 1994 (R) are on bail, therefore they are discharged from\n\nthe liability of their bail bond.\n\n156. In view of the above, Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 190 of 1994 (R) is\n\nhereby partly allowed.\n\nCr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013 and Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 483 of 2013\n\n157. Thus, on the basis of discussion made hereinabove it is\n\nconsidered view of this Court that the conviction of the appellant namely\n\nDeo Kumar Chaubey (appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 114 of 2013)\n\nunder\nSection 304 (1)\nof the IPC is not sustainable in the fact and\n\ncircumstances of the instant case, therefore the appellant namely Deo\n2025:JHHC:19134-DB\n\n2023:JHHC:44469-DB\n\nKumar Chaubey are hereby acquitted from the charge under\nSection 304\n\n(1)\nof the IPC.\n\n158. Further this Court is of the considered view that the conviction\n\nof the present appellants by the learned trial court under\nSection 323\nof\n\nthe IPC requires no interference by this Court.\n\n159. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction dated 13.02.2013\n\npassed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge-1st, Garhwa in S.T. No. 32 of\n\n1999 are modified to the extent as discussed above.\n\n160. With the aforesaid observations/directions, the Cr. Appeal (DB)\n\nNo. 114 of 2013 is hereby partly allowed and Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 483 of\n\n2013 stands dismissed.\n\n161. Since from the record it is evident that appellant of Cr. Appeal\n\n(DB) No. 114 of 2013, namely, Deo Kumar Choubey is on bail, therefore\n\nhe is discharged from the liability of his bail bond.\n\n162. Pending I.As, if any, stands disposed of.\n\n163. Let lower Court records be transmitted to the Court concerned,\n\nforthwith.\n\n(Sujit Narayan Prasad, J.)\n\nI Agree.\n\n(Rajesh Kumar, J.)\n\n(Rajesh Kumar, J.)\nSudhir\nJharkhand High Court,\nDated:08/07/2025\nAFR",
