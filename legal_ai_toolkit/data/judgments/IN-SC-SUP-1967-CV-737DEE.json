K. Sen, R. V. Pillai and B. K. Seshu, for the\nappellant (in C.A. No. 971 of 1965) and the respondent (in\nC.A. No. 972 of 1965)\nM. K. Ramamurthi, for the respondent (in C.A. No. 971 of\n1965) and the appellant (in C.A. No. 972 of 1965).\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMitter, J. This is an appeal against an award dated December\n21, 1963 in Industrial Dispute No. 28 of 1963 of the\nIndustrial Tribunal, Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad on special\nleave granted by this Court.\n\nThe dispute which was referred to the Industrial Tribunal\nrelated to the question of payment of bonus for the years\n1960-61 and 1961-62 demanded by the workers of Azam Jahi\nMills, Warrangal. The Tribunal found that there was an\navailable surplus for the first year but none for the\nsecond. It directed payment of bonus of one week's wages to\nall the workmen over and above the two weeks' bonus which\nthe employers had agreed to pay irrespective of any profits\nmade by the company. In appeal before us the appellants\ncontend that as there was no available 'Surplus, if properly\nquantified, the question of payment of bonus in addition to\nthat for the two weeks already agreed upon, does not arise.\nIt is to be noted that the parties had entered into a\nsettlement on February 22,1960 which was to be operative for\na period of five years commencing on October 1, 1958 and\nending on September 30, 1963. By that settlement, it was\nprovided that the claim for bonus would only arise if there\nshould be an available surplus after making a provision for\nall the prior charges including a fair return on paid-up\ncapital, and on reserves utilised towards the working\ncapital in terms of the Full Bench formula laid down by the\nLabour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners' Association v.\nRashtriya Mills Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay. The agreement also\nprovided that prior charges would include (a) statutory\ndepreciation and development rebate, (b) taxes, (c)\nreserve for rehabilitation, replacement and modernisation of\nBlock as calculated by the Industrial Court (basic year\n1947) and (d) a fair return at 6% on paid up capital in cash\nor otherwise including bonus shares and 2% on reserves\nemployed as working capital. It was also a term or the\nagreement that the amount of the total gross profits of the\nmill for the year shall be the amount of profits as\ndisclosed in published balance sheets of the company without\nmaking a provision for depreciation and for bonus, but after\ndeducting from it the amount of extraneous income (like\ninterest from investments, rent from property) which is\n'unrelated to the efforts of the workers. With regard to\nstatutory depreciation and development rebate, the parties\nagreed that if in any year the total of these two exceed the\namount of reserve for rehabilitation, the full ;amount of\nstatutory depreciation and development rebate would be\nadopted as a prior charge and no extra provision would be\nmade for rehabilitation in that year. Further, in terms of\nthe agreement, the workers would be entitled to an amount\nequivalent to 1/24th of the basic wages if the mill had an\navailable surplus of profits after providing for all prior\ncharges on the basis of the Full Bench formula as described\nabove, up to an amount equivalent to 25 % of the total basic\nwages earned during the year.\n\nThe contention of the appellants before us is that in\nworking out the available surplus the Tribunal went beyond\nthe Full Bench formula and the settlement between the\nparties. Our task was considerably lightened by counsel for\nthe appellants handing over a table showing the figures for\nthe working out of the Full Bench formula, as found by the\nTribunal compared to those propounded by the Management and\nthe workers. There is no dispute that the net profits as\ndisclosed by the balance sheet for the year 1960-61 was Rs.\n9,03,378/-. The only difference between the management and\nthe Tribunal with regard to the calculation of gross profits\nrelates to the figure Rs. 5,39,963/- for gratuity and\nretrenchment compensation paid by the company during the\nyear in question. According to the Tribunal, this sum\nshould be spread over five years while according to, the\ncompany, this sum should not be included at all as it had to\nbe paid out of the profits of the company during the\nrelevant year.\n\nMr. Sen, counsel for the appellants, relied on\ns. 37(1)\nof\nthe Income-tax Act, 1961 for the purpose of showing that any\nexpenditure (not being expenditure of the nature described\nin\nsections 30\nto\nand not being in the nature of capital\nexpenditure or personal ,expenses of the assessee) laid out\nor expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the\nbusiness or profession of the assessee has to be allowed in\ncomputing the income chargeable under the head 'profits and\ngains of business or profession'. He argued that gratuity\nis to be paid every year to the workmen who retire and\nretrenchment compensation has to be paid'-as and when\nworkmen are retrenched and that there could be little doubt\nthat\nthese expenses were incurred exclusively for the purpose of\nthe business of the company. He also drew our attention to\na judgment of this Court in\nBritannia Engineering Co. v.\nTheir Workmen\n( ) where it was laid down that the amount of\nprovident fund contribution and gratuity payments were not\nto be added back to the net profits disclosed by the balance\nsheet of the company for fixing the amount of gross profits\nin working out the Full Bench formula. The Tribunal\napparently recognised the force of the contention of the\nemployers but observed that the amount should be distributed\nover a number of years which it fixed as five in this case.\nThis. finding of the Tribunal is erroneous inasmuch as\ngratuity will have to be paid year after year to workmen who\nretire or leave the company's services in terms of the\nscheme of gratuity and retrenchment, compensation may have\nto be paid in any year if there be modernisation of the\nplant, or for any other reason which renders any workmen\nsuperfluous. It seems to us, therefore, that the gross\nprofits as calculated by the employers at Rs. 19,05,496/- is\nthe correct figure.\n\nComing next to the ascertainment of prior charges, the\nmaterial discrepancy between the figures adopted by the\ncompany and those by the Tribunal arises thus-we find that\nthe notional normal depreciation has been taken to be Rs.\n6,44,351/- in both sets of charts but the Tribunal has\ndeducted therefrom a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/in respect of idle\nmachinery. We are unable to accept this view of the\nTribunal. It is well settled that depreciation allowed\nunder the\nIncome-tax Act\nafter 1948 was to consist of the\nstatutory normal depreciation as well as initial\ndepreciation and additional depreciation. The Full Bench\nformula of the Labour Appellate Tribunal decided in\nU.P.\nElectric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen\n(2) that the\ndepreciation which should be deducted from the gross profits\nin working the formula was normal depreciation including the\nmultiple shift depreciation but excluding the initial\ndepreciation and additional depreciation allowable tinder\nthe\nIncome-tax Act\n.\nThis decision was followed by another\nLabour Appellate Tribunal of India in Surat Electricity\nCompany's Staff Union v. Surat Electricity Co. Ltd.(3).There\nit was pointed out that the deduction allowed under the\nhead of depreciation in the early years of the use of the\nmachinery was rather heavy under the provisions of the\n\nIndian Income-tax Act\nwhich would have the effect of unduly\nlessening the available surplus under the bonus formula to\nthe prejudice of workers even in a year of prosperity and\nthat is why the Full Bench postulated for a more even\ndistribution of depreciation over a period of years. This\naccounted for the ignoring of the initial and additional\ndepreciation in working out the bonus formula. The net\nresult was that the depreciation to be taken into account\nfor working out the bonus formula was a notional amount of\nnormal\n(1) [1965] II L.L.J. 144.\n\n(3) [1957] 11 L.L.J. 648.\n\n(2) [1955] 11 L.L.J. 431.\ndepreciation. No objection can be taken to this because the\nbonus formula itself is theoretical one. Both these\ndecisions were referred to in\nThe Associated Cement\nCompanies Ltd. v. Its Workmen\n(1), and the latter decision\nwas approved of by this Court (see at page 960).\nWe find by referring to Schedule E of the accounts of the\ncompany for the year 1960-61 that depreciation for the year\nwas calculated at Rs. 16,03,149/-. This is also referred to\nin the Director's Report. Deducting therefrom the sum of\nRs. 9,58,798/- which is referred to in the profit and loss\naccount for the year ended 30th September 1961 as balance\nprovision for depreciation to comply with\ns. 205\nof the\nCompanies Act of 1956, we get the figure of Rs. 6,44,351/-\nwhich is to be found in the chart both under the table of\nfigures adopted by the management as also by the Tribunal.\nThe figure being a notional figure for working out the bonus\nformula, the Tribunal was not justified in deducting\ntherefrom a further sum of Rs. 1,50,0001- in respect of\nmachinery which was said to be idle.\n\nIn terms of the agreement between the parties, the prior\ncharges must include the development rebate as well unless\nthe statutory depreciation and development rebate added up\nto a higher figure than the figure for reserve and\nrehabilitation. It therefore appears to us that the\nTribunal was not justified in excluding the amount of the\ndevelopment rebate reserve. There is no dispute that the\nfigure for income-tax should be Rs. 4,74,020/- or that for\nthe return on paid-up capital should be Rs. 4,32,000/-. The\nworkmen in their chart have calculated the return at 4 % on\nRs. 72 lakhs which is not justified. Both the Tribunal and\nthe company calculated return on reserves used as working\ncapital at Rs. 49,678/-. This, in our view, is not\njustified as we find from a reference to schedule E, (fixed\nassets of the company for the year 1960-61) that a sum of\nRs. 14,49,664/- was spent for addition of new plant and\nmachinery. On a reference to schedules A, B, C and D for\nthe year in question and the corresponding figures for the\nprevious year, we find that the figure of reserves and\nsurplus in schedule A has gone down by Rs. 1,00,000/-. The\nfigure for secured loans in schedule C remains the same\nwhile the current liabilities at shown in schedule D has\ngone up by Rs. 3,50,000/- in the year in question as\ncompared to the previous year and loans secured from banks\nshow a reduction of Rs. 13,22,000/-. Thus the liability in\nrespect of the loans has been reduced approximately by Rs.\n10 lakhs. Setting off the diminution the overall liability\nwas diminished by Rs. 9 lakhs. We also find from a\nreference to Schedules F, G, H and 1 (of investments,\ncurrent assets and loans by the company) that the total\nthereof has gone down by Rs. 8 lakhs from the figure of the\nprevious year. The net\n(1) [1959] S. C. R. 925.\nresult seems to be that the reduction of liability when set\noff against the reduction in the value of the assets and\ninvestments gives a deficit of Rs. 1,00,000/- approximately.\nAs the company has not incurred any fresh loans for the\npurpose of buying plant and machinery we can proceed on the\nbasis that Rs. 14,49,664/- and Rs. 1 lakh have come out of\nthe working capital. Consequently, the reserves used as\nworking capital should be approximately Rs. 24,83,000/- as\nshown by the company less Rs. 15,49,664/- i.e. Rs.\n8,34,000/- and the return thereon at 2% would be\napproximately Rs. 16,000/- in place of Rs. 49,678/-.\nFurther, we find that the Tribunal was not right in\nincluding Rs. 1,07,992/- as gratuity and retrenchment\ncompensation among its list of prior charges.\nOn the basis of the above, it seems to us that deducting the\nprior charges from the gross profits irrespective of the\nquestion of the amount to be deducted for rehabilitation,\nmodernization etc., comes to the figure arrived at is Rs.\n80,000/- or there about only.\n\nThere was a good deal of controversy between the parties\nwith regard to the correct amount of the figure for\nrehabilitation. In this connection, our attention was drawn\nto the evidence on record. The Chief Engineer of the Company\nstated before the Tribunal that the machinery had been\npurchased in 1932, that its condition was bad due to fatigue\nand that it was costing more and more every year for repairs\neven up to Rs. 21 lakhs. According to him, it required\nreplacement, the average life of a textile mill being no\nmore than 25 years. The witness also said that one half of\nthe entire machinery had been purchased and installed\nbetween 1948 and 1952 and the cost in 1952 was five times\nthat of the 1932 figure. The other witness examined on\nbehalf of the employers was the Secretary of the mill. He\nstated that the provision for rehabilitation was Rs.\n93,30,000/-, the working capital being Rs. 24,83,904/-. He\ngave certain figures to show how the figure of Rs.\n93,30,000/was arrived at. He stated further that the\ncompany had approached the Government for a loan of Rs. 56\nlakhs for replacement of the spinning machinery and part of\nthe weaving machines. The application for loan is not in\ndispute before us. As a matter of fact, the Tribunal\naccepted the evidence that the age of the' textile mill\nmachinery was about 25 years and more than half the\nmachinery had passed that age. This justified the need for\nrehabilitation. The Tribunal referred to a letter of the\ncompany to the Government dated October 10, 1963 according\nto which several experts had opined that the amount required\nfor replacement of the old machinery was Rs. 56 lakhs. The\nTribunal added thereto the sum of Rs. 2 lakhs for\nreplacement of the buildings and thus arrived at the total\nfigure of rehabilitation of Rs. 58 lakhs. In our opinion,\nthe figures arrived at by the Tribunal are acceptable but we\nhave to deduct therefrom the amount of the reserves of the\ncompany. According to us, as already shown,\nthe reserves which could be used as working capital were no\nmore than Rs. 8,34,000/-. Thus the total for rehabilitation\ncomes to Rs. 50 lakhs approximately. The Tribunal accepted\nthe divisior 5 to give effect to the bonus formula on the\nbasis that the cost of rehabilitation should be spread over\nfive years. In our opinion. the Tribunal proceeded on the\nright basis except on the figure of reserves which has to be\ndeducted. Dividing Rs. 50 lakhs by five, we get a figure of\nRs. 10 lakhs. In terms of the bonus formula therefore,\nthere was no available surplus for the year 1960-61 but\nthere was a deficit.\n\nWe were not impressed by the argument on behalf of the res-\npondents that as no experts were examined before the\nTribunal, there was no basis for calculation of the provison\nfor rehabilitation.\nIn this connection our attention was\ndrawn to a judgment of this Court in M/s\nPeirce Leslie Co.\nLtd. Kohzikode v. Their Workmen\n(1). It appears that in\nsupport of its claim\nin that case\nthe company produced a\nnumber of statements prepared by witnesses who claimed to be\nexperts showing the replacement value of buildings,\nmachinery, furniture etc.\n\nWe were also referred to the\njudgment of this Court in\nAluminium Corporation of India,\nLtd. v. Their Workmen\n(2). On the facts of that case, it was\nobserved by this Court that as there was no evidence adduced\nby the employer to substantiate its claim for the amount of\nrehabilitation, the same must be rejected. In our view, the\nTribunal must consider a11 the evidence before it and then\nproceed to ascertain the figure to 'be adopted for\nrehabilitation purposes. If the company had no scheme for\nrehabilitation, then of -course its claim on that head must\nbe rejected. Again, the claim made by the company cannot be\naccepted unless substantiated by evidence. In this case, we\nfind that half the machinery was over 25 years old, that it\nrequired over Rs. 2 lakhs every year for repairs according\nto the evidence of the Chief Engineer and that its effi-\nciency had dwindled considerably. We also see no reason to\nreject the evidence adduced before the Tribunal that the\ncompany had applied for a loan of Rs. 56 lakhs from the\nGovernment for rebabilitation purposes and we accordingly\nare of the view that the Tribunal proceeded on the correct\nbasis so far as rehabilitation ,charges are concerned.\nThere remains the point about the working capital of the\ncompany. No case is here made that the reserves of the\ncompany were being used for any purpose other than the\nbusiness of the company. The accounts of the company show\nthat its secured liability exceeded Rs. 1,16,00,000/- and\nits unsecured loans exceed Rs. 28,00,000/-. Unless\ntherefore there is evidence to show that the reserves were\nnon-existent or they were being utilised for a purpose other\nthan\n(1) [1960] 3 S.C.R. 194.\n\n(2) [1963] 11 L.L.J. 629.\nthe business of the company, it is reasonable to assume that\nthe reserves were being utilised as working capital of the\ncompany.\n\nIn our view, therefore, the Tribunal was not right in\nfinding that there was available surplus for calculation of\nbonus for the year 1960-61 and the appeal No. 971 of 1965\nmust be allowed and the award set aside.\n\nThe other appeal No. 972 of 1965 which is by the workmen for\nenhancement of the bonus consequently must be dismissed.\nThe first appeal is therefore allowed with costs and the\nsecond appeal is, dismissed but, without any order as to\ncosts.\n\nR.K.P.S. Appeal 972 of '65 dismissed.\n\nAppeal 971 of '65 allowed.",
