Golegaonkar, learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent.\n\n2 AA 26.2023\n\n2. The present arbitration application is filed under\nsection 11\n\n(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short \"the\n\nArbitration Act\n\") for appointment of an arbitrator in a dispute that arose\n\nout of an agreement dated 23.09.2019. The said agreement provides for\n\nthe arbitration, at clause no.64(3)(b)(ii) of the Indian Railways Standard\n\nGeneral Conditions of Contract - November, 2018 (hereinafter referred\n\nas \"General Conditions of Contract\").\n\n3. The facts stated in the application for invocation of power of\n\nthis court under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act are as under:-\n\n\"1. The applicant S. N. Naik & Brothers is a sole\nproprietary concern having its office at the address specified\nin the cause title.\n\n2. The respondent is the Union of India, through its\nSenior Divisional Engineer (Coord) Nanded Division, South\nCentral Railway having its office at the address specified in\nthe cause title.\n\n3. The respondent had published e-tender No. T-201819-\n1-117 dated 12.03.2019 for the work of \"Nanded Division,\nParli - Parbhani Section :- Provision of limited height subway\nin lieu of manned Level Crossing No. 18, 19, 21 and 22\"\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Work\" or as the \"said Work\").\nThe applicant had submitted its offer for the work.\n\n4. On 05.07.2019, the respondent awarded the said work\nto the applicant vide Letter of Acceptance dated 05.07.2019,\nfor an amount of Rs.10,37,78,548.23/- (Rupees Ten Crore\nThirty-Seven Lakhs Seventy-Eight Thousand Five Hundred\nFourty-Eight and Paisa Twenty-Three only).\n\n3 AA 26.2023\n\n5. On 23.09.2019, that thereafter, formal contract\nagreement bearing even date, was also entered into by and\nbetween the applicant and the respondent.\n\n6. Respondent contended that as there was constant\ndelay in completing the work and work was relating to\npublic safety at large as such a 7 day notice and 48 hours\nnotice was served upon petitioner by the respondent.\n\n7. On 17.12.2022, the applicant was therefore\napproached the Hon'ble District Judge at Nanded by filing an\nApplication under\nsection 9\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act bearing Miscellaneous Civil Application\nNo.489/2022 for interim protection against Termination of\nContract by the Respondent. The Hon'ble Court was pleased\nto pass ad-interim order of status-quo in favour of the\napplicant. On the same day the applicant vide letter dated\n17.12.2022, invoked arbitration in respect of the disputes\nand differences between the parties.\n\n8. The respondent further directed the applicant to\nsubmit forms towards waiver of\nSection 12(5)\n(ineligibility\nof serving or retired officers of the respondent to act a an\narbitrator) and 31(A)(5) (payments of costs) of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, as amended in 2015.\n\n9. On 11.05.2023, as the applicant was not desirous of\ndeviating from the dispute resolution mechanism agreed\nbetween the parties, to the extent of the procedure being in\nconsonance with the settled law, in response to the\nRespondent's letter dated 26.04.2023, the applicant\naddressed a letter to the respondent and clarified that in\naccordance with the dispute resolution mechanism agreed\nbetween the parties, the applicant had already referred the\ndisputes to the General Manager, Railways and that despite\nsufficient time being passed since submission of said\ndisputes, the General Manager, respondent has failed to\nrender his decision in writing. The applicant further clarified\n4 AA 26.2023\n\nthat, respondent is not entitled to appoint the arbitrator in\nthe matter despite the existence of any term to the contrary\nin the contract. The applicant unequivocally refused to waive\nthe applicability of\nSections 12(5)\nand\n31(A)(5)\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended in 2015.\n\n10. On 01.06.2023, the respondent addressed a letter\nwherein, the respondent suggested four names of retired\nofficers of the respondent and directed the applicant to\nselect any two names therefrom to act as the nominee\narbitrator on behalf of the applicant in terms of request for\nappointment of arbitrator dated 17.12.2022.\n\n11. On 22.07.2023, the applicant nominated its arbitrator\nand called upon the respondent to nominate its arbitrator\nwithin the statutory period of 30 days.\n\n12. On 18.08.2023, the respondent however failed to\neither appoint its nominee arbitrator within the statutory\nperiod of 30 days or prepare a panel of more than three\narbitrators within 60 days from invocation of arbitration by\nthe applicant vide letter dated 22.07.2023. The respondent\nconstituted an arbitral tribunal (including the nominee\narbitrator of the applicant) to decide the disputes and\ndifferences between the parties.\n\n13. On 13.09.2023, the applicant took objection to the act\nof respondent to constitute an arbitral tribunal (including\nthe nominee arbitrator of the applicant) to decide the\ndisputes and differences between the parties in view of the\nalleged request for appointment dated 17.12.2022.\n\n14. On 01.08.2023, in furtherance to the respondent's\nletter dated 27.07.2023, one of the arbitrators accepted his\nappointment.\n\n5 AA 26.2023\n\n15. On 29.08.2023, in the meanwhile, the arbitral tribunal\nentered into the reference and issued a letter to the\napplicant and respondent.\n\n16. On 19.10.2023, the respondent thereafter vide a letter,\ndirected the applicants to raise the objections it has before\nthe Arbitral Tribunal appointed by the respondent.\n\n17. On 02.11.2023, the Hon'ble District Judge No.2 at\nNanded vide an order bearing even date was pleased to\npartly allow the Miscellaneous Civil Application\nNo.489/2022 and grant status-quo for a period of 2 months\nor till the first hearing before the arbitral tribunal constituted\nin accordance with their agreement, whichever is earlier.\n\n18. On 09.11.2023, as the respondent failed to appoint\ntheir nominee arbitrator within the statutory period of 30\ndays, the applicant is left with no other alternative but to\napproach this Hon'ble Court under\nSection 11\nand other\nrelevant provisions of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act,\nfor the appointment of a sole arbitrator.\"\n\n4. It is the case of the applicant that clause\n\n64(3)(b)(ii) of the Indian Railways Standard General Conditions of\n\nContract - November, 2018, is applicable to the agreement dated\n\n23.09.2019. Mr. Namit Sunil Muthiyan, learned counsel for the\n\napplicant submits that the above clause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General\n\nConditions of Contract, provides for a unilateral appointment of\n\narbitration tribunal and the same cannot be sustained in view of\nsection\n\n12 (5)\nread with Schedule 5 and 7 of the\nArbitration Act\n. The\n\nappointment of the arbitral tribunal in terms of clause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the\n6 AA 26.2023\n\nGeneral Conditions of Contract is in violation of the law laid down in the\n\ncase of\nTRF Ltd. Vs. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd.\nreported in (2017)\n\n8 SCC 377 and in the case of\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC and\n\nanother Vs. HSCC (India) Ltd.\nreported in (2020) 20 SCC 760.\n\n5. The learned counsel has also submitted that clause 64(3)(b)\n\n(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract are in violation of law\nlaid\n\ndown in\nthe case of M/s.\nVoestalpine Schienen GMBH Vs. Delhi Metro\n\nRail Corporation Ltd.\n, (2017) 4 SCC 665.\n\n6. The learned counsel has also placed reliance in the\n\njudgments of the Delhi High Court in the case of\nGangotri Enterprises\n\nLtd. Vs. General Manager Northern Railways, Arbitration Petition No.366\n\nof 2020, dated 31.10.2022 and in the case of M/s.\nGanesh Engineering\n\nWorks Vs. Northern Raiway and another\n, Arbitration Petition NO.609 of\n\n20023, dated 29.11.2023, to contend that application under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act was allowed while interpreting the above\n\nclause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract.\n\n7. In response to the notice the respondent has objected to the\n\nappointment of the arbitrator under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nThe objections raised to the appointment to the arbitrator under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act are as under:-\n\n7 AA 26.2023\n\n[I - Issue of Maintainability]\n\nMr. Madhur A. Golegaonkar, learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent - Union of India, Through, Senior Divisonal Engineer\n\n(Co-ord), Nanded Division, South Central Railway, submits that\n\narbitration application under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act cannot\n\nbe preferred after obtaining order under\nsection 9\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nand the party concerned has to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal\n\nin accordance with the agreement and that there would be a deemed\n\nwaiver to challenge to the appointment of the arbitrator as stipulated\n\nunder the contract duly signed by both the parties.\n\n[II] Once the court while exercising powers under\nsection 9(2)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act provides both the parties to constitute an arbitral tribunal\n\nin accordance with the agreement and directed both the parties to appear\n\nbefore them, the parties are bound by it and the same cannot be\n\nchallenged under application 11 (6) of the\nArbitration Act\nand the\n\nHon'ble High Court cannot sit as an appellate authority to the order\n\npassed by the District Court under\nsection 9\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nSection 9(2)\nof the Arbitration Act would prevail and order dated\n\n02.11.2023, passed by the District Court would be binding upon the\n\nparties.\n\n8 AA 26.2023\n\n[III] The similar arbitration clause has already been upheld in the case\n\nof Central Organization for\nRailway Electrification Vs. ECI-SPIC-SMO-\n\nMCML (JV) a Joint Venture company reported in (2020) 14 SCC 712\n\n(hereinafter referred as \"CORE\") and, although, the law\nlaid down in\n\nthe\n\nsaid judgment\nis referred to a larger bench yet the judgment is still\n\nholding the field and this court is bound by it.\n\n8. From the submissions as canvassed by the petitioner the\n\nfollowing issues arise for consideration:-\n\n{1} Whether clauses 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General\n\nConditions of Contract is in violation of\nsection 12(5)\nread\n\nwith Schedule 5 and 7 of the\nArbitration Act\nand also the\n\nmandate of\nTRF\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra) ?\n\n{2} Whether the arbitration application under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act can be preferred after obtaining\n\nan interim order under\nsection 9\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nwithout following the process available for appointment of\n\nArbitral Tribunal as provided in the contract and as directed\n\nby the court passing interim order under\nsection 9(2)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act?\n\n9 AA 26.2023\n\n{3} In the fact situation, whether, this court can exercise\n\npowers under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act to appoint\n\nan arbitrator ?\n\nCONSIDERATION\n\n9. On considering the rival submissions at the outset it is\n\nnecessary to quote the relevant clause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the Indian Railways\n\nStandard General Conditions of Contract - November, 2018, as applicable\n\nto the parties. The relevant clause reads as under:-\n\n\"64.(3)(b): Appointment of Arbitrator where applicability of\n\nSection 12 (5)\nof Arbitration and Conciliation Act has not\nbeen waived off:\n\n(i) ...\n\n(ii) In cases where the total value of all claims in question\nadded together exceed Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakh),\nthe Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of a Panel of three (3)\nretired Railway Officer, retired not below the rank of Senior\nAdministrative Grade Officer, as the arbitrators. For this\npurpose, the Railway will send a panel of at least four (4)\nnames of retired Railway Officer(s) empanelled to work as\nRailway Arbitrator duly indicating their retirement date to\nthe Contractor within 60 days from the day when a written\nand valid demand for arbitration is received by the General\nManager.\n\nContractor will be asked to suggest to General Manager at\nlest 2 names out of the panel for appointment as\nContractor's nominee within 30 days from the date of\ndispatch of the request by Railway. The General Manager\nshall appoint at least one out of them as the Contractor's\nnominee and will, also simultaneously appoint the balance\nnumber of arbitrators either from the panel or from outside\nthe panel, duly indicating the 'Presiding Arbitrator' from\n10 AA 26.2023\n\namongst the 3 arbitrators so appointed. General Manager\nshall complete this exercise of appointing the Arbitral\nTribunal within 30 days from the receipt of the names of\nContractor's nominees. While nominating the arbitrators, it\nwill be necessary to ensure that one of them has served in\nthe Accounts Department.\"\n\nA. The analysis of the above clause would indicate that the\n\narbitral tribunal would consist of panel of 3 retired railway officers\n\nnot below the rank of senior administrative grade officer, as\n\narbitrators.\n\nB. For this purpose, the railway will send a panel of at least 4\n\nnames of retired railway officers empanelled to work as railway\n\narbitrator duly indicating their retirement date to the contractor\n\nwithin 60 days from the day when a written and valid demand for\n\narbitration is received by the General Manager.\n\nC. The contractor is asked to select at least 2 names out of\n\nthe 4 names suggested by the General Manager for appointment as\n\nContractor's nominee within 30 days.\n\nD. The General Manager shall appoint at least 1 out of the 2\n\nnames suggested by the contractor as the Contractor's nominee.\n\nE. And will also simultaneously appoint the balance number of\n\narbitrators either from the panel or from outside the panel, duly\n11 AA 26.2023\n\nindicating the 'Presiding Arbitrator' from amongst the 3 arbitrators\n\nso appointed.\n\n10. Thus, from the above, it is clear that from the 3 arbitrators, 2 will\n\nbe appointed including the presiding arbitrator by the General Manager\n\nand even in the case of third arbitrator, the General Manager will have a\n\nfinal word, as 4 names are suggested by him of which the contractor is\n\nrequired to choose 2 and even amongst the 2 chosen by the contractor\n\nthe General Manager will select one. Thus, in entirety, the entire tribunal\n\nis constituted by the General Manager. The contractor having virtually\n\nvery little say, even as regards the contractor's nominee.\n\n11. The law on the subject of appointment of arbitrators, i.e.\n\nappointment of sole arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal by one of party to the\n\ncontract notwithstanding the contract to the contrary, is evolved in the\n\njudgment of\nVoestalpine\n(supra),\nTRF\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra) etc, wherein\n\nthe independence and impartiality of the sole arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal\n\nis held sacrosanct. The law enunciated is that there cannot be unilateral\n\nappointment of sole arbitrator or the majority members of the arbitral tribunal\n\nby one of the party to the dispute notwithstanding the prior contract to the\n\ncontrary. This is to ensure impartiality and independence of the arbitrators. The\n\nlaw as developed is discussed as under:-\n\n12 AA 26.2023\n\n12.\nIn the case of\nVoestalpine\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in paras 21 to 23, 30 and 31 has held as under:-\n\n\"21) Similarly, Cour de cassation, France, in a judgment\ndelivered in 1972 in the case of Consorts Ury, underlined\nthat \"an independent mind is indispensable in the exercise of\njudicial power, whatever the source of that power may be,\nand it is one of the essential qualities of an arbitrator.\"\n\n22) Independence and impartiality are two different\nconcepts. An arbitrator may be independent and yet, lack\nimpartiality, or vice versa. Impartiality, as is well accepted, is\na more subjective concept as compared to independence.\nIndependence, which is more an objective concept, may,\nthus, be more straightforwardly ascertained by the parties at\nthe outset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the\ncircumstances disclosed by the arbitrator, while partiality\nwill more likely surface during the arbitration proceedings.\n\n23) It also cannot be denied that the Seventh Schedule is\nbased on IBA guidelines which are clearly regarded as a\nrepresentation of international based practices and are based\non statutes, case law and juristic opinion from a cross-\nsection on jurisdiction. It is so mentioned in the guidelines\nitself.\n\n30) Time has come to send positive signals to the\ninternational business community, in order to create healthy\narbitration environment and conducive arbitration culture in\nthis country. Further, as highlighted by the Law Commission\nalso in its report, duty becomes more onerous in\nGovernment contracts, where one of the parties to dispute is\nthe Government or public sector undertaking itself and the\nauthority to appoint the arbitrator rests with it. In the instant\ncase also, though choice is given by DMRC to the opposite\nparty but it is limited to choose an arbitrator from the panel\nprepared by the DMRC. It, therefore, becomes imperative to\nhave a much broad based panel, so that there is no\n13 AA 26.2023\n\nmisapprehension that principle of impartiality and\nindependence would be discarded at any stage of the\nproceedings, specially at the stage of constitution of the\narbitral tribunal. We, therefore, direct that DMRC shall\nprepare a broad based panel on the aforesaid lines, within a\nperiod of two months from today.\n\n31) Subject to the above, insofar as present petition is\nconcerned, we dismiss the same, giving two weeks' time to\nthe petitioner to nominate its arbitrator from the list of 31\narbitrators given by the respondent to the petitioner.\nNo costs.\"\n\n13. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nPerkins Eastman\n\nArchitects DPC and another Vs. HSCC (India) Ltd.\n(supra), considered\n\nTRF\n(supra).\n\nIn\nPerkins\n(supra), the issues that arose for consideration\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court are as under:-\n\n\"(i) ...\n\n(ii) Whether a case was made out for exercise of power by\nthe Court to make an appointment of an arbitrator i.e.:\n\n(a) Whether Chairman and Managing Director failed to\nappoint the sole arbitrator within 30 days of the requisition\ndated 28-6-2019 and if so its consequences ?\n\n(b) Whether Chairman and Managing Director was\nineligible to nominate an arbitrator i.e. whether a person\nhaving an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or\ndecision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an\narbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint anyone\nelse as an arbitrator ?\n\n(c) Whether power can be exercised by the Supreme\nCourt under\nSection 11\nof the Act when the appointment of\nan arbitrator has already been made by the respondent ?\"\n\n14 AA 26.2023\n\nWhile answering the issue the Hon'ble Supreme Court at\n\nparas 18, 20 and 21 has held as under:-\n\n\"18. The issue was discussed and decided by this Court as\nunder: (\nTRF\ncase, SCC pp.403-04, paras 50-54)\n\n50. First, we shall deal with Clause (d). There is no\nquarrel that by virtue of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act, if\nany person who falls under any of the categories\nspecified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to\nbe appointed as the arbitrator. There is no doubt and\ncannot be, for the language employed in the Seventh\nSchedule, the Managing Director of the Corporation\nhas become ineligible by operation of law. It is the\nstand of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nthat once the Managing Director becomes ineligible,\nhe also becomes ineligible to nominate. Refuting the\nsaid stand, it is canvassed by the learned Senior\nCounsel for the respondent that the ineligibility cannot\nextend to a nominee if he is not from the Corporation\nand more so when there is apposite and requisite\ndisclosure. We think it appropriate to make it clear\nthat in the case at hand we are neither concerned with\nthe disclosure nor objectivity nor impartiality nor any\nsuch other circumstance. We are singularly concerned\nwith the issue, whether the Managing Director, after\nbecoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still\neligible to nominate an arbitrator. At the cost of\nrepetition, we may state that when there are two\nparties, one may nominate an arbitrator and the other\nmay appoint another. That is altogether a different\nsituation. If there is a clause requiring the parties to\nnominate their respective arbitrator, their authority to\nnominate cannot be questioned. What really in that\ncircumstance can be called in question is the\nprocedural compliance and the eligibility of their\narbitrator depending upon the norms provided under\nthe Act and the Schedules appended thereto. But, here\nis a case where the Managing Director is the \"named\n\n15 AA 26.2023\n\nsole arbitrator\" and he has also been conferred with\nthe power to nominate one who can be the arbitrator\nin his place. Thus, there is subtle distinction.\nIn this\nregard, our attention has been drawn to a two-Judge\nBench decision in\nState of Orissa v. Commr. of Land\nRecords & Settlement7\n. In the said case, the question\narose, can the Board of Revenue revise the order\npassed by its delegate. Dwelling upon the said\nproposition, the Court held: (SCC p. 173, para 25)\n...\n\n53. The aforesaid authorities have been commended\nto us to establish the proposition that if the\nnomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator\nis allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the\nproceeding of arbitration by himself. According to the\nlearned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes\nat the root of his power to arbitrate or get it arbitrated\nupon by a nominee.\n\n54. In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy\nwould be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the\nManaging Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may\nbe otherwise eligible and a respectable person. As\nstated earlier, we are neither concerned with the\nobjectivity nor the individual respectability. We are\nonly concerned with the authority or the power of the\nManaging Director. By our analysis, we are obligated\nto arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has\nbecome ineligible by operation of law, he cannot\nnominate another as an arbitrator. The arbitrator\nbecomes ineligible as per prescription contained in\n\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act. It is inconceivable in law that\nperson who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a\nperson. Needless to say, once the infrastructure\ncollapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse. One\ncannot have a building without the plinth. Or to put it\ndifferently, once the identity of the Managing Director\n16 AA 26.2023\n\nas the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate\nsomeone else as an arbitrator is obliterated. Therefore,\nthe view expressed by the High Court is not\nsustainable and we say so.\"\n\n\"20. We thus have two categories of cases. The first, similar\nto the one dealt with in TRF Limited4 where the Managing\nDirector himself is named as an arbitrator with an additional\npower to appoint any other person as an arbitrator. In the\nsecond category, the Managing Director is not to act as an\narbitrator himself but is empowered or authorised to appoint\nany other person of his choice or discretion as an arbitrator.\nIf, in the first category of cases, the Managing Director was\nfound incompetent, it was because of the interest that he\nwould be said to be having in the outcome or result of the\ndispute. The element of invalidity would thus be directly\nrelatable to and arise from the interest that he would be\nhaving in such outcome or decision. If that be the test,\nsimilar invalidity would always arise and spring even in the\nsecond category of cases. If the interest that he has in the\noutcome of the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the\npossibility of bias, it will always be present irrespective of\nwhether the matter stands under the first or second category\nof cases. We are conscious that if such deduction is drawn\nfrom the decision of this Court in TRF Limited, all cases\nhaving clauses similar to that with which we are presently\nconcerned, a party to the agreement would be disentitled to\nmake any appointment of an Arbitrator on its own and it\nwould always be available to argue that a party or an official\nor an authority having interest in the dispute would be\ndisentitled to make appointment of an Arbitrator.\"\n\n\"21. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction\nfrom TRF Limited. Paragraph 50 of the decision shows that\nthis Court was concerned with the issue, \"whether the\nManaging Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of\nlaw, is he still eligible to nominate an Arbitrator\" The\nineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of operation\n\n17 AA 26.2023\n\nof law, in that a person having an interest in the dispute or in\nthe outcome or decision thereof, must not only be ineligible\nto act as an arbitrator but must also not be eligible to\nappoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person\ncannot and should not have any role in charting out any\ncourse to the dispute resolution by having the power to\nappoint an arbitrator. The next sentences in the paragraph,\nfurther show that cases where both the parties could\nnominate respective arbitrators of their choice were found to\nbe completely a different situation. The reason is clear that\nwhatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an\narbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal\npower with the other party. But, in a case where only one\nparty has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will\nalways have an element of exclusivity in determining or\ncharting the course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the\nperson who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the\ndispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator.\nThat has to be taken as the essence of the amendments\nbrought in by the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)\nAct, 2015\n(Act 3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of\nthis Court in TRF Limited.\"\n\n14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nLombard\n\nEngineering Limited Vs. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited\n, dated\n\n06.11.2023, Arbitration Petition No.43 of 2022, considered whether\n\nclause 55 of the GCC containing condition of 7% deposit of the total\n\namount of claim and second relating to the stipulation empowering the\n\nPrincipal Secretary (Irrigation) Government of Uttarakhand to appoint a\n\nsole arbitrator was considered and was striked out and the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme court held that the appointment of arbitrator notwithstanding\n\nthe contract to the contrary would be void and that the one of the parties\n18 AA 26.2023\n\ndid not have a bargaining power to modify the contract. The arbitration\n\nagreement has to be in confirmity with the\nContract Act\nand should\n\nsatisfy core contractual requirements.\n\n15.\nIn the case of\nLombard Engineering Limited Vs. Uttarakhand\n\nJal Vidyut Nigam Limited\n, dated 06.11.2023, Arbitration Petition No.43\n\nof 2022, the 3 Judges bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has at paras\n\n81, 82, 83, 84, 88, 93 and 102 has observed as under:-\n\n\"81. Thus, in the context of the Arbitration Agreement, the\nlayers of the Grundnorm as per Kelsen's theory would be in\nthe following hierarchy:\n\n(i) Constitution of India, 1950;\n\n(ii)\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n& any other\nCentral/State Law;\n\n(iii) Arbitration Agreement entered into by the parties in\nlight of\ns. 7\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n82. Thus, the Arbitration Agreement, has to comply with the\nrequirements of the following and cannot fall foul of:\n\n(i)\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act;\n\n(ii) any other provisions of the\nArbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996\n& Central/State Law;\n\n(iii) Constitution of India, 1950.\n\n83. The observations of this Court in para 236 of Vidya\nDrolia (supra) should clinch the issue. Para 236 reads thus:\n\n\"236. Having established the threshold standard for the\ncourt to examine the extent of validity of the arbitration\nagreement, as a starting point, it is necessary to go back to\n\nDuro Felguera [Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n,\n(2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764], which laid\ndown : (SCC p. 759, para 48)\n19 AA 26.2023\n\n\"48. ... From a reading of\nSection 11\n(6-A), the intention of\nthe legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need\nonly look into one aspect--the existence of an arbitration\nagreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether\nthere is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The\nresolution to that is simple--it needs to be seen if the\nagreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration\npertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the\nparties to the agreement.\" At first blush, the Court seems to\nhave read the existence of the arbitration agreement by\nlimiting the examination to an examination of its factual\nexistence. However, that is not so, as the existence of\narbitration agreement does not mean anything unless such\nagreement is contractually valid.\n\nThis view is confirmed by\n\nDuro Felguera\ncase [\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port\nLtd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764], wherein\nthe reference to the contractual aspect of arbitration\nagreement is ingrained under\nSection 7\nanalysis. A mere\nagreement is not legally binding, unless it satisfies the core\ncontractual requirements, concerning consent, consideration,\nlegal relationship, etc.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n84. The concept of \"party autonomy\" as pressed into service\nby the respondent cannot be stretched to an extent where it\nviolates the fundamental rights under the Constitution. For\nan arbitration clause to be legally binding it has to be in\nconsonance with the \"operation of law\" which includes the\nGrundnorm i.e. the Constitution. It is the rule of law which\nis supreme and forms parts of the basic structure. The\nargument canvassed on behalf of the respondent that the\npetitioner having consented to the pre-deposit clause at the\ntime of execution of the agreement, cannot turn around and\ntell the court in a\nSection 11(6)\npetition that the same is\narbitrary and falling foul of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution is\nwithout any merit.\n\n88. In the aforesaid context, we must look into the amended\n\nSection 12\nof the 1996 Act.\nSection 12\nreads thus:\n\n20 AA 26.2023\n\n\"12. Grounds for challenge.\n\n(1) When a person is approached in connection with his\npossible appointment as an arbitrator, he shall disclose in\nwriting any circumstances,--\n\n(a) such as the existence either direct or indirect, of any past\nor present relationship with or interest in any of the parties\nor in relation to the subject-matter in dispute, whether\nfinancial, business, professional or other kind, which is likely\nto give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or\nimpartiality; and\n\n(b) which are likely to affect his ability to devote sufficient\ntime to the arbitration and in particular his ability to\ncomplete the entire arbitration within a period of twelve\nmonths.\n\nExplanation 1.--The grounds stated in the Fifth Schedule\nshall guide in determining whether circumstances exist\nwhich give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence\nor impartiality of an arbitrator.\n\nExplanation 2.--The disclosure shall be made by such person\nin the form specified in the Sixth Schedule.]\n(3) An arbitrator may be challenged only if--\n\n(a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as\nto his independence or impartiality, or\n\n(b) he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the\nparties.\n\n(4) A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him, or\nin whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons\nof which he becomes aware after the appointment has been\nmade.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary,\nany person whose relationship, with the parties or counsel or\nthe subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the\ncategories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator:\n\nProvided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having\narisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-\nsection by an express agreement in writing.\"\n\n21 AA 26.2023\n\n89. The Amendment 2015 is also based on the\nrecommendation of the Law Commission which specifically\ndealt with the issue of \"Neutrality of Arbitrators\" and a\ndiscussion in this behalf is contained in paras 53 to 60 of the\nLaw Commission's Report No. 246 published in the August\n2004. We reproduce the entire discussion hereinbelow:\n\n\"NEUTRALITY OF ARBITRATORS\n\n53. It is universally accepted that any quasi-judicial process,\nincluding the arbitration process, must be in accordance with\nprinciples of natural justice. In the context of arbitration,\nneutrality of arbitrators viz. their independence and\nimpartiality, is critical to the entire process.\n\n54.\nIn the Act\n, the test for neutrality is set out in\nSection\n12(3)\nwhich provides--\n\n'12. (3) An arbitrator may be challenged only if--\n\n(a) circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as\nto his independence or impartiality....'\n\n55.\nThe Act\ndoes not lay down any other conditions to\nidentify the \"circumstances\" which give rise to \"justifiable\ndoubts\", and it is clear that there can be many such\ncircumstances and situations. The test is not whether, given\nthe circumstances, there is any actual bias for that is setting\nthe bar too high; but, whether the circumstances in question\ngive rise to any justifiable apprehensions of bias.\n\n56. The limits of this provision has been tested in the Indian\nSupreme Court in the context of contracts with State entities\nnaming particular persons/designations (associated with\nthat entity) as a potential arbitrator. It appears to be settled\nby a series of decisions of the Supreme Court (see\nExecutive\nEngineer, Irrigation Division v. Gangaram Chhapolia\n[Executive Engineer\n,\nIrrigation Division v. Gangaram\nChhapolia\n, (1984) 3 SCC 627] , Transport Deptt. v.\n\nMunuswamy Mudaliar [Transport Deptt. v. Munuswamy\nMudaliar, 1988 Supp SCC 651] , International Airports\nAuthority v. K.D. Bali [International Airports Authority v.\nK.D. Bali, (1988) 2 SCC 360] , S. Rajan v. State of Kerala [S.\nRajan v. State of Kerala, (1992) 3 SCC 608] , Indian Drugs &\n22 AA 26.2023\n\nPharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Indo Swiss Synthetics Gem Mfg. Co.\nLtd. [Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nv. Indo Swiss\nSynthetics Gem Mfg. Co. Ltd., (1996) 1 SCC 54] , Union of\nIndia v. M.P. Gupta [Union of India v. M.P. Gupta, (2004) 10\nSCC 504] and ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. v. Bharat\nPetroleum Corpn. Ltd. [ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. v.\nBharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., (2007) 5 SCC 304] that\narbitration agreements in government contracts which\nprovide for arbitration by a serving employee of the\ndepartment, are valid and enforceable.\n\nWhile the Supreme\nCourt, in\nIndian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. Raja Transport (P) Ltd.\n[Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd.\nv. Raja Transport (P) Ltd., (2009) 8\nSCC 520 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 460], carved out a minor\nexception in situations when the arbitrator 'was the\ncontrolling or dealing authority in regard to the subject\ncontract or if he is a direct subordinate (as contrasted from\nan officer of an inferior rank in some other department) to\nthe officer whose decision is the subject-matter of the\ndispute' (SCC p. 533, para 34) and this exception was used\nby the Supreme Court in Denel (Proprietary) Ltd. v. Ministry\nof Defence [Denel (Proprietary) Ltd. v. Ministry of Defence,\n(2012) 2 SCC 759 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 37 : AIR 2012 SC\n817] and Bipromasz Bipron Trading Sa v. Bharat Electronics\nLtd. [Bipromasz Bipron Trading Sa v. Bharat Electronics Ltd.,\n(2012) 6 SCC 384 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 702] , to appoint an\nindependent arbitrator under\nSection 11\n, this is not enough.\n\n57. The balance between procedural fairness and binding\nnature of these contracts, appears to have been tilted in\nfavour of the latter by the Supreme Court, and the\nCommission believes the present position of law is far from\nsatisfactory. Since the principles of impartiality and\nindependence cannot be discarded at any stage of the\nproceedings, specifically at the stage of constitution of the\nArbitral Tribunal, it would be incongruous to say that party\nautonomy can be exercised in complete disregard of these\nprinciples -- even if the same has been agreed prior to the\ndisputes having arisen between the parties. There are certain\n23 AA 26.2023\n\nminimum levels of independence and impartiality that\nshould be required of the arbitral process regardless of the\nparties' apparent agreement. A sensible law cannot, for\ninstance, permit appointment of an arbitrator who is himself\na party to the dispute, or who is employed by (or similarly\ndependent on) one party, even if this is what the parties\nagreed. The Commission hastens to add that Mr P.K.\nMalhotra, the ex officio member of the Law Commission\nsuggested having an exception for the State, and allow State\nparties to appoint employee arbitrators. The Commission is\nof the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be any\ndistinction between State and non-State parties. The concept\nof party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point where it\nnegates the very basis of having impartial and independent\nadjudicators for resolution of disputes. In fact, when the\nparty appointing an adjudicator is the State, the duty to\nappoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is that\nmuch more onerous -- and the right to natural justice\ncannot be said to have been waived only on the basis of a\n\"prior\" agreement between the parties at the time of the\ncontract and before arising of the disputes.\n\n58. Large-scale amendments have been suggested to address\nthis fundamental issue of neutrality of arbitrators, which the\nCommission believes is critical to the functioning of the\narbitration process in India. In particular, amendments have\nbeen proposed to\nSections 11\n,\nand\nof the Act.\n\n59. The Commission has proposed the requirement of having\nspecific disclosures by the arbitrator, at the stage of his\npossible appointment, regarding existence of any\nrelationship or interest of any kind which is likely to give rise\nto justifiable doubts. The Commission has proposed the\nincorporation of the Fourth Schedule, which has drawn from\nthe red and orange lists of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of\nInterest in International Arbitration, and which would be\ntreated as a \"guide\" to determine whether circumstances\nexist which give rise to such justifiable doubts. On the other\nhand, in terms of the proposed\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act and\nthe Fifth Schedule which incorporates the categories from\n24 AA 26.2023\n\nthe red list of the IBA Guidelines (as above), the person\nproposed to be appointed as an arbitrator shall be ineligible\nto be so appointed, notwithstanding any prior agreement to\nthe contrary. In the event such an ineligible person is\npurported to be appointed as an arbitrator, he shall be de\njure deemed to be unable to perform his functions, in terms\nof the proposed Explanation to\nSection 14\n. Therefore, while\nthe disclosure is required with respect to a broader list of\ncategories (as set out in the Fourth Schedule, and as based\non the red and orange lists of the IBA Guidelines), the\nineligibility to be appointed as an arbitrator (and the\nconsequent de jure inability to so act) follows from a smaller\nand more serious sub-set of situations (as set out in the Fifth\nSchedule, and as based on the red list of the IBA Guidelines).\n\n60. The Commission, however, feels that real and genuine\nparty autonomy must be respected, and, in certain\nsituations, parties should be allowed to waive even the\ncategories of ineligibility as set in the proposed Fifth\nSchedule. This could be in situations of family arbitrations or\nother arbitrations where a person commands the blind faith\nand trust of the parties to the dispute, despite the existence\nof objective \"justifiable doubts\" regarding his independence\nand impartiality. To deal with such situations, the\nCommission has proposed the proviso to\nSection 12(5)\n,\nwhere parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen\nbetween them, waive the applicability of the proposed\n\nSection 12(5)\nby an express agreement in writing. In all\nother cases, the general rule in the proposed\nSection 12(5)\n\nmust be followed. In the event the High Court is approached\nin connection with appointment of an arbitrator, the\nCommission has proposed seeking the disclosure in terms of\n\nSection 12(1)\nand in which context the High Court or the\ndesignate is to have \"due regard\" to the contents of such\ndisclosure in appointing the arbitrator.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n93. There was clearly inequality of bargaining power\nbetween Uber and Mr. Heller. The arbitration agreement was\npart of a standard form contract. Mr. Heller was powerless to\n25 AA 26.2023\n\nnegotiate any of its terms. His only contractual option was to\naccept or reject it...\"\n\n\"102. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we have reached\nto the conclusion that we should ignore the two conditions\ncontained in Clause 55 of the GCC, one relating to 7%\ndeposit of the total amount claimed and the second one\nrelating to the stipulation empowering the Principle\nSecretary (Irrigation) Government of Uttarakhand to appoint\na sole arbitrator and proceed to appoint an independent\narbitrator.\"\n\n16. Before I apply the law enunciated in the case of\nVoestalpine\n\n(supra), TRF (surpa),\nPerkins\n(supra) and\nLombard\n(supra) to the facts of\n\nthis case it is necessary to consider the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Central Organization for\nRailway Electrification Vs.\n\nECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV\n) a Joint Venture company reported in (2020)\n\n14 SCC 712, [CORE], where the application of the above clause 64(3)(b)\n\n(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract came for consideration. The\n\nissues before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra)\n\nwere as under:-\n\n\"The issues involved in this appeal were:\n\n1. Whether the High Court could have appointed an\nindependent arbitrator without reference to the Clauses of\nGeneral Conditions of Contract (GCC) ?\n\n2. Whether retired railway officers are not eligible to be\nappointed as arbitrators under\nSection 12(5)\nread with\n\nSchedule VII of the Act\n[as amended w.e.f. 23-10-2015] ?\n\n3. Whether General Manager was not eligible to\nnominate the arbitrator ?\n\n26 AA 26.2023\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra), at\n\nparas 26 and 27 observed as under:\n\n\"26. The same view was reiterated in\nGovernment of Haryana PWD\nHaryana (B and R) Branch v. G.F. Toll Road Private Limited and\nOthers\n(2019) 3 SCC 505 wherein, the Supreme Court held that\nthe appointment of a retired employee of a party to the agreement\ncannot be assailed on the ground that he is a retired/former\nemployee of one of the parties to the agreement. Absolutely, there\nis no bar under\nSection 12(5)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Act, 2015 for appointment of a retired employee to\nact as an arbitrator.\n\n27. By the letter dated 25.10.2018, the appellant has forwarded a\nlist of four retired railway officers on its panel thereby giving a\nwide choice to the respondent to suggest any two names to be\nnominated as arbitrators out of which, one will be nominated as\nthe arbitrator representing the respondent-Contractor. As held in\nVoestalpine Schienen Gmbh (2017) 4 SCC 665, the very reason for\nempanelling the retired railway officers is to ensure that the\ntechnical aspects of the dispute are suitably resolved by utilising\ntheir expertise when they act as arbitrators. Merely because the\npanel of the arbitrators are the retired employees who have\nworked in the Railways, it does not make them ineligible to act as\nthe arbitrators.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra) at\n\nparas 36, 37, 38 and 39 further observed as under:\n\n\" 36. As discussed earlier, after\nArbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Act, 2015\n, the Railway Board vide notification\ndated 16.11.2016 has amended and notified Clause 64 of\nthe General Conditions of Contract. As per Clause 64(3)(a)\n\n(ii) [where applicability of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act has been\nwaived off], in a case not covered by Clause 64(3)(a)(i), the\nArbitral Tribunal shall consist of a panel of three Gazetted\nRailway Officers not below the rank of Junior Administrative\n27 AA 26.2023\n\nGrade or two Railway Gazetted Officers not below the rank\nof Junior Administrative Grade and a retired Railway Officer\nretired not below the rank of Senior Administrative Grade\nOfficer, as the arbitrators. For this purpose, the General\nManager, Railway will send a panel of at least four names of\nGazetted Railway Officers of one or more departments of the\nRailway within sixty days from the date when a written and\nvalid demand for arbitration is received by the General\nManager. The contractor will be asked to suggest to General\nManager at least two names out of the panel for\nappointment as contractor's nominees within thirty days\nfrom the date of dispatch of the request from the Railway.\n\nThe General Manager shall appoint at least one out of them\nas the contractor's nominee and will also simultaneously\nappoint balance number of arbitrators from the panel or\nfrom outside the panel duly indicating the \"Presiding\nOfficer\" from amongst the three arbitrators so appointed.\nThe General Manager shall complete the exercise of\nappointing the Arbitral Tribunal within thirty days from the\ndate of the receipt of the names of contractor's nominees.\n\n37. Clause 64(3)(b) of GCC deals with appointment of\narbitrator where applicability of\nSection 12(5)\nof the Act has\nnot been waived off. In terms of Clause 64(3)(b) of GCC, the\nArbitral Tribunal shall consist of a panel of three retired\nRailway Officers retired not below the rank of Senior\nAdministrative Grade Officers as the arbitrators. For this\npurpose, the Railway will send a panel of at least four names\nof retired Railway Officers empanelled to work as arbitrators\nindicating their retirement date to the contractor within sixty\ndays from the date when a written and valid demand for\narbitration is received by the General Manager. The\ncontractor will be asked to suggest the General Manger at\nleast two names out of the panel for appointment of\ncontractor's nominees within thirty days from the date of\ndispatch of the request of the Railway. The General Manager\nshall appoint at least one out of them as the contractor's\nnominee and will simultaneously appoint the remaining\n28 AA 26.2023\n\narbitrators from the panel or from outside the panel, duly\nindicating the \"Presiding Officer\" from amongst the three\narbitrators. The exercise of appointing Arbitral Tribunal shall\nbe completed within thirty days from the receipt of names of\ncontractor's nominees. Thus, the right of the General\nManager in formation of Arbitral Tribunal is counter-\nbalanced by respondent's power to choose any two from out\nof the four names and the General Manager shall appoint at\nleast one out of them as the contractor's nominee.\n\n38. In the present matter, after the respondent had sent the\nletter dated 27.07.2018 calling upon the appellant to\nconstitute Arbitral Tribunal, the appellant sent the\ncommunication dated 24.09.2018 nominating the panel of\nserving officers of Junior Administrative Grade to act as\narbitrators and asked the respondent to select any two from\nthe list and communicate to the office of the General\nManager. By the letter dated 26.09.2018, the respondent\nconveyed their disagreement in waiving the applicability of\nSection 12(5) of the Amendment Act, 2015. In response to\nthe respondent's letter dated 26.09.2018, the appellant has\nsent a panel of four retired Railway Officers to act as\narbitrators giving the details of those retired officers and\nrequesting the respondent to select any two from the list and\ncommunicate to the office of the General Manager. Since the\nrespondent has been given the power to select two names\nfrom out of the four names of the panel, the power of the\nappellant nominating its arbitrator gets counter-balanced by\nthe power of choice given to the respondent. Thus, the\npower of the General Manager to nominate the arbitrator is\ncounter-balanced by the power of the respondent to select\nany of the two nominees from out of the four names\nsuggested from the panel of the retired officers. In view of\nthe modified Clauses 64(3)(a)(ii) and 64(3)(b) of GCC, it\ncannot therefore be said that the General Manager has\nbecome ineligible to act as the arbitrator. We do not find any\nmerit in the contrary contention of the respondent. The\ndecision in TRF Limited is not applicable to the present case.\n\n29 AA 26.2023\n\n39. There is an express provision in the modified clauses of\nGeneral Conditions of Contract, as per Clauses 64(3)(a)(ii)\nand 64(3)(b), the Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of a panel of\nthree Gazetted Railway Officers [Clause 64(3)(a)(ii)] and\nthree retired Railway Officers retired not below the rank of\nSenior Administrative Grade Officers [Clause 64(3)(b)].\nWhen the agreement specifically provides for appointment of\nArbitral Tribunal consisting of three arbitrators from out of\nthe panel serving or retired Railway Officers, the\nappointment of the arbitrators should be in terms of the\nagreement as agreed by the parties. That being the\nconditions in the agreement between the parties and the\nGeneral Conditions of the Contract, the High Court was not\njustified in appointing an independent sole arbitrator\nignoring Clauses 64(3)(a)(ii) and 64(3) (b) of the General\nConditions of Contract and the impugned orders cannot be\nsustained.\"\n\n17. The view taken in the case of CORE (supra) is subsequently\n\ndoubted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs.\n\nM/s. Tantia Constructions Limited, SLP No.12670/2010, vide order dated\n\n11.01.2021 and is referred to the larger bench, the order of reference is\n\nquoted below:-\n\n\"Having heard Mr. K. M. Nataraj, learned ASG for sometime,\nit is clear that on the facts of this case, the judgment of the\nHigh Court cannot be faulted with. Accordingly, the Special\nLeave Petition is dismissed. However, reliance has been\nplaced upon a recent three-Judge Bench decision of this\ncourt delivered on 17.12.2019 in Central Organisation for\nRailway Electrification vs. M/s ECI-SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV) A\nJoint Ventrure Company, 2019 SCC OnLine 1635. We have\nperused the aforesaid Judgment and prima facie disagree\nwith it for the basic reason that once the appointing\nauthority itself is incapacitated from referring the matter to\n30 AA 26.2023\n\narbitration, it does not then follow that notwithstanding this\nyet appointments may be valid depending on the facts of the\ncase.\n\nWe therefore request the Hon'ble Chief Justice to\nconstitute a larger Bench to look into the correctness of this\njudgment.\n\nPending application stands disposed of.\"\n\n18. Thus, in the case of CORE (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt has applied the above clause 64(3)(b)(ii) and held that the High\n\nCourt could have not appointed independent sole arbitrator.\nHowever, in\n\nthe case of CORE (supra)as discussed hereinafter, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt was not called upon to decide whether clause 64(3)(b)(ii) is in\n\nconfirmity of principles laid down in\nTRF\n(supra) i.e. whether the arbitral\n\npanel is broad based and in\nPerkins\n(supra), more particularly, whether\n\nthe counter balance is achieved in appointing the arbitral panel.\n\nThe\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra) has not whittled\n\ndown the principles laid down in\nTRF and Perkins\n(supra).\nThe issues\n\nanswered in the judgment of CORE (supra) are, whether the retired\n\nrailway officers are eligible to be appointed as arbitrators and whether\n\nthe General Manager is eligible to nominate the arbitrators.\n\n19 In Tantia Constructions (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n\ndoubted the view taken in the case of CORE (supra) observing that once\n\nthe appointing authority itself is incapcity from referring the matter to\n\narbitrator it does not follow that notwithstanding this yet appointments\n31 AA 26.2023\n\nmay be valid depending upon the facts of the case.\nHowever, CORE\n\n(supra), has not dealt with the issue of counter balance achieved in terms\n\nof\nPerkins\n(supra).\nAs such, the law\nlaid down in\nthe judgment of CORE\n\n(supra) is limited to the issues answered in CORE (supra). The same is\n\nthe view taken by the Delhi High Court in the below discussed\n\njudgments.\n\n20. The Delhi High Court in the case of\nGangotri Enterprises\n\n(supra) has considered the judgment of the CORE (supra) at para 23, 24\n\nand 25, as under:-\n\n\"23. Judgment in the case of Central Organisation for\n\nRailways Electrification\n(supra), as relied upon by\nrespondent, cannot come to the aid of respondent. It is\npertinent to note here that\nthe said judgment\nhas been\nreferred to larger Bench in order to look into the correctness\nof\nthe said judgment\nin the case of Union of India vs. M/s\nTantia Constructions Ltd., SLP (Civil) No. 12670/2020. ....\"\n\n24. Perusal of the aforesaid order dated 11.01.2021 passed\nby the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India vs. M/s\nTantia Constructions Ltd., (2021) SCC Online SC 271, shows\nthat Supreme Court has given a prima facie view, wherein it\nhas disagreed with the judgment in the case of Central\nOrganisation for\nRailways Electrification\n(supra).\n\n25. Similarly, in a recent case, in the case of\nSteel Ltd. vs.\nSouth Western Railway and Anr., Special Leave to Appeal\n(C)No.\n9462/2022, by order dated 16.08.2022, Supreme\nCourt by a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India directed\nfor constitution of a larger Bench to consider the correctness\nof the judgment in the case of Central Organisation for\n32 AA 26.2023\n\nRailways Electrification\n(supra). Thus, Supreme Court held\nas follows:\n\n\"1. The basic issue involved in the instant matter is whether\nthe appointment of the Arbitrator was in conformity with the\nlaw\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\nTRF Ltd. V. Energo\nEngineering Projects Ltd\n, (2017) 8 SCC 377; and,\nPerkins\nEastman Architects DPC v. HSCC (India) Ltd.\n, (2020) 20 SCC\n\n760.\n\n2. The High Court has gone by the decision rendered by a\nBench of three-judges of this Court in\nCentral Organisation\nFor Railway Electrification v. ECL- SPIC-SMO-MCML (JV), A\nJoint Venture Company\n, (2020) 14 SCC 712, which decision\nhad distinguished the applicability of\nTRF Ltd.\n(supra) and\n\nPerkins Eastman Architects DPC\n(supra) to the fact situation\ninvolved therein.\n\n3. It has been brought to our notice that subsequently, a\nBench of three-Judges of this Court in Union of India v. M/s.\nTantia Constructions Ltd., [SLP (Civil) No. 12670 of 2020],\nvide its order dated 11.01.2021, prima facie expressed its\ndisagreement with the view taken in\nCentral Organisation\nFor Railway Electrification\n(supra) and requested the\nHon'ble the Chief Justice of India to constitute a larger\nBench to look into the correctness of the decision in\nCentral\nOrganisation For Railway Electrification\n(supra).\n\n4. ...\n\n5. ...\n\n6. ...It is however, quite clear that the correctness of the\ndecision in\nCentral Organisation For Railway Electrification\n\n(supra), based on which the appointment of the Arbitrator\nwas made and the matter had proceeded before the\nArbitrator, was doubted by a subsequent Bench of three\nJudges.\n\n33 AA 26.2023\n\n7. In the circumstances, we direct that the papers of the\npresent matter be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice\nof India for constituting a larger Bench.\n\n8. Since the issue has been re-occurring, we may observe\nthat it would be in the fitness of things that the question is\nresolved at an early date.\n\n9. Pending such consideration, the effect and operation of\nthe Award dated 30.03.2022 shall remain stayed.\"\n\n21. The Delhi High Court in the case of\nGangotri Enterprises\n\n(supra) at para 31 has further held as under:-\n\n\"31. In the present cases, it is seen that the panel of\narbitrators as sent by the respondent contained only four\nnames, which cannot be considered to be broad based by\nany extent of imagination. Thus, the said panel as given by\nthe respondent does not satisfy the concept of neutrality of\narbitrators as held by Supreme Court in the case of\n\nVoestalpine Schienen GMBH\n(supra).\n\nFurther, as already\nnoted, Supreme Court has already given a prima facie view\nwith respect to correctness of the judgment in the case of\nCentral Organisation for\nRailway Electrification\n(supra),\nwherein a similar clause was considered and has passed\nreference order for constituting a larger Bench to look into\nthe correctness of\nthe said judgment\n. In view thereof, it is\nheld that the petitioner herein was within its right to\nnominate its Arbitrator.\"\n\n22. The Delhi High Court in the case of M/s.\nGanesh\n\nEngineering Works Vs. Northern Raiway and another\n, Arbitration Petition\n\nNO.609 of 2023, dated 29.11.2023, considering the same clause 64(3)(b)\n\nand after considering the judgment of\nTRF\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra)\n34 AA 26.2023\n\nand also the judgment of CORE (supra), held at paras 21 and 22 as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"21. Question No.(iv), as noted above, i.e. eligibility of the\nGeneral Manager to nominate an arbitrator is really the\nheart of the dispute in the present case. Having noted the\nquestions arising in CORE, the Co-ordinate Bench in Margo\n(supra), observed that although the CORE judgment has\nbeen referred to a Larger Bench of the Supreme Court, but\nthe operation of the judgment has not been stayed and\ncontinues to hold the field but observed further that the\njudgment in CORE is an authority only in respect of the\npropositions identified and carved out therein and its\napplicability cannot ipso facto be extended for the purpose\nof adjudication of other aspects which have not been\npurported to be answered in CORE. Two fundamental issues\narising for its consideration were flagged by the Court and\nanswered as follows:-\n\n\"20. Two fundamental issues which fall for consideration in\nthis case and which were not specifically answered in CORE,\nare as under:--\n\ni. When appointment of arbitrator/s is to be made out of a\npanel prepared by one of the parties, whether the said panel\nis required to be \"broad- based\", in conformity with the\nprinciple laid down in\nVoestalpine\n(supra), and if so, what is\nthe consequence where the panel is not sufficiently \"broad\nbased\"?\n\nii. Whether \"counter balancing\" [as contemplated in\nPerkins\n\n(supra)] is achieved in a situation where one of the parties\nhas a right to choose an arbitrator from a panel whereas the\nremaining (2 out of 3) members of the arbitral tribunal are\nappointed by the other party?\n\nxxxx xxxx xxxx\n\n25. Thus, it was held by the Supreme Court in\nVoestalpine\n\n(supra) that:\n\ni. Affording a panel of five names to the petitioner from\nwhich the petitioner was required to nominate its nominee\n\n35 AA 26.2023\n\narbitrator, was restrictive in nature; the same created room\nfor suspicion that DMRC may have picked up its own\nfavourite;\n\nii. Choice should be given to the concerned party to\nnominate any person from the entire panel of arbitrators;\niii. The two arbitrators nominated by the parties should be\ngiven full freedom to choose the third arbitrator;\niv. The panel ought not to be restricted/limited to retired\nengineers and/or retired employees but should be broad\nbased and apart from serving or retired employees of\ngovernment departments and public sector undertakings, the\npanel should include lawyers, judges, engineers of\nprominence from the private sector etc.\n\n26. CORE does not in any manner overrule\nVoestalpine\n\n(supra) or narrow down the scope thereof, although it does\nnot deal specifically with the issue as to whether the panel\nafforded by the Railways\nin that case\nwas in conformance\nwith the principles\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra).\n\n27. The difficulties which were found to have inflicted the\npanel afforded to the petitioner in\nVoestalpine\n(supra) also\nsquarely apply to the present case.\n\n29. The principle\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra) has been\nfollowed in a large number of cases to adjudge upon validity\nof appointment procedure involving appointment from a\npanel.\n\nThus, In\nSMS Ltd. v. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited\n, out a\npanel of 37 names, only eight names had no connection with\nthe Railways. It was held that even though the panel\ncomprised as many as 37 names, it was not sufficiently\nbroadbased.\n\nIn that case, a previous judgment in the case of\n\nSimplex Infrastructures Ltd. v. Rail Vikas Nigam Limited\nwas\nalso taken note of, in which a panel of 26 names (out of\nwhich only 9 were unconnected with the Railways) was held\nto be not sufficiently broad based inasmuch as the same did\nnot comprise independent persons such as judges, lawyers,\nengineers of prominence from the private sector etc.\n\nThe\nsaid judgments were relied upon in the case of Overnite\n36 AA 26.2023\n\nExpress Limited v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation\n, this court\nwent to the extent of holding that \"the procedure of\nforwarding a panel of five names to the other contracting\nparty to choose its nominee Arbitrator is now held to be no\nlonger a valid procedure.\"\n\n...\n\n35. Thus, in an appointment procedure involving\nappointment from a panel made by one of the contracting\nparties, it is mandatory for the panel to be sufficiently broad\nbased, in conformity with the principle\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra), failing which, it would be incumbent on\nthe Court, while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11\n, to\nconstitute an independent and impartial Arbitral Tribunal as\nmandated in\nTRF\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra). The judgment\nof the Supreme Court in CORE does not alter the position in\nthis regard.\n\n...\n\n37. This brings us to the next issue that arises in the context\nof the arbitration clause in the present case, viz. whether\n\"counter balancing\" is achieved in a situation where one of\nthe parties has a right to choose an arbitrator from a panel\nwhereas 2/3rd of the members of the arbitral tribunal are\nappointed by the other party.\n\n41. The fulcrum of CORE is that the right of one of the\nparties to prescribe a panel of persons from which the parties\nwould appoint their nominee arbitrators is counter balanced\nby the power of other contracting party to choose therefrom.\nHowever, whether counter balancing can be achieved in a\nsituation where one of the contracting parties has a right to\nappoint the remaining 2/3rd of the members of the arbitral\ntribunal, was not specifically considered in CORE....\n\n\"........\n\n21. The other anomaly which merits consideration is that the\nManaging Director of the Respondent, who has a direct\ninterest in the outcome of the case, is directly appointing\n2/3rd of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal. And also\nplays a role in the appointment of the 3rd arbitrator i.e., the\n37 AA 26.2023\n\ncontractor's nominee. This is against the spirit of the\njudgment in\nPerkins Eastman\n(supra).\nThis argument was\nperhaps not raised in CORE (supra).\n\n22. In cases where the arbitration clause provides a genuine\ncounterbalancing of power of appointment between the two\nparties i.e., when one party appoints its nominee and the\nother party does the same and the two nominees together\ndecide the presiding arbitrator the Court would not find any\nimbalance impinging upon the concept of party autonomy.\nThis was the sentiment expressed by the Supreme Court in\n\nTRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Limited\n,\nparticularly para 50 which reads as under:--\n\n\"50....................We are singularly concerned with the issue,\nwhether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by\noperation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator.\nAt the cost of repetition, we may state that when there are\ntwo parties, one may nominate an arbitrator and the other\nmay appoint another. That is altogether a different situation.\nIf there is a clause requiring the parties to nominate their\nrespective arbitrator, their authority to nominate cannot be\nquestioned. What really in that circumstance can be called in\nquestion is the procedural compliance and the eligibility of\ntheir arbitrator depending upon the norms provided under\nthe Act and the Schedules appended thereto.\"\n\n...\n\nThe clause in the present case does not provide for any\neffective counter balancing. The process starts with selection\nof a panel by the Respondent and this restricts the element\nof choice that the contractor may exercise in choosing its\nnominee. Nonetheless, it allows the Respondent to\nultimately choose the contractor's nominee from the two\nnames suggested by the contractor. However, the clause also\nentitles the Respondent to choose the balance two\narbitrators from the panel or even outside. This undeniably\nindicates that the scales are tipped in favour of the\nRespondent when it comes to the appointment process. In\n38 AA 26.2023\n\neffect, 2/3rd strength of the Arbitral Tribunal is nominated\nby the Respondent. This leads to the inexorable conclusion\nthat the clause in its current state may not be workable.\nThus, the reliance of the Respondent upon the judgment in\nCORE (supra) is misplaced.\n\n...............\"\n\n42. The reasoning and the conclusion in CMM (supra) on the\nabove aspect was followed by this court in\nPankaj Mittal v.\nUnion of India, Order\ndated 16.12.2021 in ARB.P. 607/2021\nwhere in it was observed as under:\n\n\"..........\n\n4. This Court has considered the afore-noted clause in a\nrecent judgment passed in ARB.P. 407/2020 dated 23rd\nAugust, 2021 titled -\n'CMM Infraprojects Ltd. v. IRCON\nInternational Ltd.\n', wherein an identical clause has been\nconsidered by this Court. The clause herein as worded,\npermits the Respondent to make nomination of 2/3rd\nstrength of the Arbitral Tribunal, which tilts the scales in\nfavour of the Respondent in the appointment process.\n\nFor\nthis reason and others as noted in the afore-noted judgment,\nthe Court found the case of Central Organisation for\nRailway\nElectrification\n(supra) distinguishable. The said reasons\napply to this case as well.\n\n..............\"\n\n22. Therefore, from a reading of the aforementioned\njudgments, it palpably emerges that the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in CORE, did not deal with two specific\nquestions i.e. (a) when appointment of an Arbitrator(s) is\nmade out of a panel prepared by one of the parties, whether\nthe said panel is required to be 'broad-based' in conformity\nwith the principles\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra) and if\nso, what is the consequence where the panel is not\nsufficiently 'broad-based'; and (b) whether counter\nbalancing, as contemplated in\nPerkins\n(supra) is achieved in\na situation where one of the parties has a right to choose an\narbitrator from a panel where 2/3rd members of the Arbitral\nTribunal are appointed by the other party and these\n39 AA 26.2023\n\nquestions have been answered in Margo (supra), relying on\nthe judgments of the Supreme Court in\nVoestalpine\n(supra),\n\nTRF Limited\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra), by holding that the\nsaid appointment procedure fails to pass muster.\n\nIt was held\nthat the 'counter balancing' contemplated in\nPerkins\n(supra)\ncannot be said to be achieved in a situation where one of the\nparties has a right to choose an arbitrator from a panel\nwhere the remaining 2 out of 3 arbitrators are appointed by\nthe other party.\n\nTo come to this conclusion, Court referred to\nthe judgments of this Court in\nSMS Limited v. Rail Vikas\nNigam Limited\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Del 77;\nBVSR-KVR (Joint\nVentures) v. Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd.\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Del\n456;\nConsortium of Autometers Alliance Ltd. and Canny\nElevators Co. Ltd. v. Chief Electrical Engineer/Planning,\nDelhi Metro Rail Corporation and Others\n, 2021 SCC OnLine\nDel 4042 and Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. (supra).\"\n\n23. I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the\n\nDelhi High Court in the case of\nGangotri\n(supra) and\nGanesh Engineering\n\n(supra) that the judgment of CORE (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\ndoes not deal with the issue, whether the arbitral panel appointed is\n\nbroad based in confirmity with voelstapine (supra) and whether the\n\ncounter balancing is achieved as laid down in\nPerkins\n(supra). Coming to\n\nthe facts of the present case, 2/3 arbitral panel is appointed by the\n\nrespondent so also for the 3rd member of the arbitral tribunal 4 names are\n\nsuggested by the respondent from which the petitioner is required to\n\nchoose 2 names and from the 2 names chosen by the petitioner, the\n\nrespondent will appoint one. Thus, the respondent has a complete say in\n\nthe appointment of the tribunal.\n\n40 AA 26.2023\n\n24. Having considered the law on the subject the question as\n\nraised at para 8(1) can be answered as under:-\n\nClause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract\n\nprovides for unilateral appointment of arbitral tribunal at the hands of\n\none of the parties and, thus, is in violation of the principles\nlaid down in\n\nVoestalpine\n(supra),\nTRF\n(supra) and\nPerkins\n(supra) and also in\n\nviolation of the law\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nLombard\n(supra) and the\n\nsaid clause is ex-faice invalid and the tribunal constituted thereunder is\n\nnon-est and void ab initio.\n\n25. Coming to the next question, whether in arbitration\n\napplication under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act can be granted\n\nafter the party has obtained an interim order under\nsection 9\nof the\n\nArbitration Act without following the process available for appointment\n\nof arbitral tribunal as provided in the contract and as directed by the\n\ncourt granting interim order under\nSection 9(2)\nof the Arbitration Act. As\n\ndiscussed above, the arbitral tribunal appointed under clause 64 (3)(b)\n\n(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract would be ineligible to conduct\n\narbitration. Clause 64 (3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract\n\nbeing invalid, whether this court can invoke the powers under\nsection\n\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act to appoint an arbitrator.\n\n41 AA 26.2023\n\n26.\nIn the case of\nPerkins\n(supra) at para 21, 22 and 23, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under:-\n\n\"21. The further question that arises is whether the power\ncan be exercised by this Court under\nSection 11\nof the Act\nwhen the appointment of an arbitrator has already been\nmade by the respondent and whether the appellant should\nbe left to raise challenge at an appropriate stage in terms of\nremedies available in law. Similar controversy was gone into\nby a Designated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG3 and\nthe discussion on the point was as under:-\n\n\"9. While it is correct that in Antrix16 and Pricol Ltd.17, it\nwas opined by this Court that after appointment of an\narbitrator is made, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nbut such remedy lies elsewhere and\nunder different provisions of the\nArbitration Act\n(\nSections 12\n\nand\n), the context in which the aforesaid view was\nexpressed cannot be lost sight of. In Antrix16, appointment\nof the arbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the\nalternative procedure agreed upon, whereas in Pricol\nLtd.17., the party which had filed the application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act had already submitted\nto the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. In the present case, the\nsituation is otherwise.\n\n10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid\nand such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\nacceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be countenanced\nin law. In the present case, the agreed upon procedure\nbetween the parties contemplated the appointment of the\narbitrator by the second party within 30 days of receipt of a\nnotice from the first party. While the decision in Datar\nSwitchgears Ltd.18 may have introduced some flexibility in\nthe time frame agreed upon by the parties by extending it till\na point of time anterior to the filing of the application under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act, it cannot be lost sight of\nthat in the present case the appointment of Shri Justice A.D.\n42 AA 26.2023\n\nMane is clearly contrary to the provisions of the Rules\ngoverning the appointment of arbitrators by ICADR, which\nthe parties had agreed to abide by in the matter of such\nappointment. The option given to the respondent\nCorporation to go beyond the panel submitted by ICADR and\nto appoint any person of its choice was clearly not in the\ncontemplation of the parties. If that be so, obviously, the\nappointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is non est in law.\nSuch an appointment, therefore, will not inhibit the exercise\nof jurisdiction by this Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act. It cannot, therefore, be held that the present\nproceeding is not maintainable in law. The appointment of\nShri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30 days of the receipt\nof notice by the petitioner, though may appear to be in\nconformity with the law\nlaid down in\nDatar Switchgears\nLtd18., is clearly contrary to the agreed procedure which\nrequired the appointment made by the respondent\nCorporation to be from the panel submitted by ICADR. The\nsaid appointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in law.\"\n\n22. It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the\nDesignated Judge in Walter Bau AG3 was pressed into\nservice on behalf of the appellant in TRF Limited4 and the\nopinion expressed by the Designated Judge was found to be\nin consonance with the binding authorities of this Court. It\nwas observed:-\n\n\"32. Mr Sundaram, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nhas also drawn inspiration from the judgment passed by the\nDesignated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG3, where\nthe learned Judge, after referring to Antrix Corpn. Ltd16. ,\ndistinguished the same and also distinguished the authority\nin\nPricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd.17\nand came\nto hold that: (Walter Bau AG case3, SCC p. 806, para 10)\n\"10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid\nand such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\nacceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\n43 AA 26.2023\n\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be countenanced\nin law. ...\"\n\n33. We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in\nthe aforesaid case is in consonance with the binding\nauthorities we have referred to hereinbefore.\"\n\n23. In TRF Limited4, the Managing Director of the\nrespondent had nominated a former Judge of this Court as\nsole arbitrator in terms of aforesaid Clause 33(d), after\nwhich the appellant had preferred an application under\n\nSection 11(5)\nread with\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. The plea\nwas rejected by the High Court and the appeal therefrom on\nthe issue whether the Managing Director could nominate an\narbitrator was decided in favour of the appellant as stated\nhereinabove. As regards the issue about fresh appointment,\nthis Court remanded the matter to the High Court for fresh\nconsideration as is discernible from para 55 of the\nJudgment. In the light of these authorities there is no\nhindrance in entertaining the instant application preferred\nby the Applicants.\"\n\n27. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nPerkins\n(supra)\n\nhas considered the argument, whether it can exercise jurisdiction\n\nunder\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act, when the clause providing for\n\nappointment of arbitrator is ex-facie invalid or direct the parties to invoke\n\nthe remedies available within the\nArbitration Act\nby raising the\n\nappropriate defense as available in the\nArbitration Act\n. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that prima facie when the court is safisfied that\n\nthe clauses for appointment of arbitrator are ex-facie invalid, the court\n\ncan exercise powers under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act and\n\nappoint an arbitrator.\n\n44 AA 26.2023\n\n28. In the instant case, I have held that the agreement 64(3)(b)\n\n(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract is in violation of the principles\n\nlaid down in\n\nTRF\n(supra),\nPerkins\n(supra) and\nLombard Engineering\n\n(supra) and that clause 64 (3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of\n\nContract provides for unilateral appointment of arbitrator at the hands of\n\none party and it breaches the principle of impartiality and neutrality of\n\nthe arbitrators. Thus, this court under\nsection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act\n\ncan exercise it's powers of appointment of arbitrator and need not\n\nrelegate the parties to raise such defences before the arbitral tribunal\n\nconstituted under the aforesaid clause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General\n\nConditions of Contract.\n\n29. In view of this, in exercise of the powers under\nsection 11(6)\n\nof the Arbitration Act, I appoints Hon'ble Shri Naresh H. Patil (Retired\n\nChief Justice, Bombay High Court) as sole arbitrator in the matter to\n\ndecide the disputes arising between the parties in terms of agreement\n\ndated 23.09.2019. The sole arbitrator's fees shall be governed by the\n\nBombay High Court (Fee Payable to Arbitrators) Rules, 2018.\n\n30. The Arbitration Application stands allowed and disposed of\n\naccordingly.\n\n[ARUN R. PEDNEKER, J.]\nmarathe",
