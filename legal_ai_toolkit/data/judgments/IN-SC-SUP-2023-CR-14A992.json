Gavai\n,\nVikram Nath\n,\nSanjay Karol\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO.108 OF 2012\n\nGUNA MAHTO ...APPELLANT\n\nVERSUS\n\nSTATE OF JHARKHAND ...RESPONDENT\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nSANJAY KAROL, J.\n\n1. The present criminal appeal is filed by appellant Guna Mahto,\n\nfound guilty of murdering his wife Smt. Deomatiya Devi under\n\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860 by the Ld. Trial\n\nCourt, Daltonganj in Sessions Trial Case No. 50 of 1989 titled as\n\nState vs. Guna Mahto\nvide judgement dated 10.05.2001. The Ld.\n\nTrial Court sentenced the appellant to a term of life\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nimprisonment under\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code and\n\nNarendra Prasad\n\nDate: 2023.03.17\n\n16:15:18 IST\n\nReason:\n\ntwo years rigorous imprisonment in relation to the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 201\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n2. On appeal, in the impugned judgment delivered by the High\n\nCourt of Jharkhand in Criminal Appeal No. 214 of 2001 dated\n\n23.07.2004 titled as\nGuna Mahto v. State of Jharkhand\nand\n\nfindings in respect to the conviction and sentencing arrived at by\n\nthe Ld. Trial Court were affirmed, despite observing that the\n\nInvestigation Officer was not examined by the prosecution. Be\n\nthat as it may, the High Court solely relied upon the ocular\n\nevidence of Banaudhi Mahto (PW-2), Samodhi Yadav (PW-9) and\n\nNandish Yadav (PW-10).\n\n3. Hence the present appeal filed by the appellant Guna Mahto.\n\n4. It is the case of the prosecution that the accused had committed\n\nthe murder of his wife and thereafter dumped her dead body in\n\nthe well of the village with an intent to cause disappearance of\n\nthe evidence related to the crime. Later, the accused approached\n\nthe Police with unclean hands by fabricating a false story,\n\nwherein he reported his wife to be ‘missing’.\n\n5. On 13.8.1988, the dead body of the deceased was found in the\n\nwell of the village pursuant to which the matter was brought to\n\nthe notice of the police and P.S. Case No. 35/1988 (Ex.P-3)\nregistered at Manika Police Station, Jharkhand. Accordingly, the\n\ninvestigation was conducted and challan presented before the\n\nCourt for Trial. The prosecution examined ten witnesses out of\n\nwhom, testimonies of Murari Ram (PW-1), Mithu Pd. Sahu (PW-\n\n4), Musafir Yadav (PW-5), Munni Mistry (PW-6), Chitranjan\n\nPandey (PW-8) and Sukhru Mahto (PW-7) are merely formal in\n\nnature. We find their testimonies, when considered\n\nindependently or even collectively, not to point anything towards\n\nthe guilt of the accused.\n\n6. Before we deal with the merits of the case, we deem it\n\nappropriate, at this stage, to state the facts that are not in\n\ndispute: (a) the identity of the deceased, (b) the body of the\n\ndeceased recovered from the well of the village, (c) the Post\n\nMortem Report prepared by Dr. Narendra Kumar Misar (PW-3)\n\nstating the cause of the death being haemorrhage and shock\n\nwith injuries on the neck of the deceased.\n\n7. It is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that in a case\n\nrevolving around circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must\n\nprove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the\n\ncircumstances relied upon must point out only towards one\nhypothesis, that is, the guilt of the accused alone and none else.\n\nOn various occasions, this Court has stated essential conditions\n\nthat must be fulfilled before conviction of an accused can take\n\nplace based on circumstantial evidence. In the landmark case of\n\nSharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Mahrashtra, (1984) 4\n\nSCC 116 it has been held as under:\n\n“153. A close analysis of this decision would show that\nthe following conditions must be fulfilled before a case\nagainst an accused can be said to be fully established:\n\n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt\nis to be drawn should be fully established.\n\nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that the\ncircumstances concerned “must or should” and not “may\nbe” established. There is not only a grammatical but a\nlegal distinction between “may be proved” and “must be\nor should be proved” as was held by this Court in\nShivaji\nSahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra\n[(1973) 2 SCC\n793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the\nobservations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC (Cri)\np. 1047]\n“Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must\nbe and not merely may be guilty before a court can\nconvict and the mental distance between ‘may be’ and\n‘must be’ is long and divides vague conjectures from sure\nconclusions.”\n(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with\nthe hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say,\nthey should not be explainable on any other hypothesis\nexcept that the accused is guilty,\n(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature\nand tendency,\n(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except\nthe one to be proved, and\n(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not\nto leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must\nshow that in all human probability the act must have\nbeen done by the accused.”\n8. In the instant case, as we have noted earlier, the Investigation\n\nOfficer was not examined. We find that there is no evidence,\n\nocular or documentary, relating to the factum of the accused\n\nhaving caused the disappearance of evidence by giving\n\ninformation to the police in order to prevent himself from being\n\nprosecuted in relation to the murder of his own wife.\n\n9. When we examine the testimony of Banaudhi Mahto (PW-2),\n\nfather of the deceased, we notice him not to have stated anything\n\nagainst the accused in relation to the crime. He states that two\n\ndays prior to the recovery of the dead body, father of the accused\n\nhad informed him that the deceased had eloped with someone.\n\nBut with whom? He does not mention. He admits that the\n\ndeceased and the accused were living together and when he\n\ndiscovered that his daughter had not returned home, he lodged\n\nthe report with the Police.\n\n10.Samodhi Yadav (PW-9), uncle of the deceased, residing in village\n\nMaran, only states that Ram Brijesh Yadav (co-villager) informed\n\nhim that his daughter-in-law (the deceased) had eloped with\n\nsomeone residing in village i.e. Maran. Since he doubted such\n\nstatement, he went to village Janho, the place of the matrimonial\n\nhouse of the deceased and was informed that since previous\nevening, none had seen the deceased. The body of the deceased\n\nwas found only on the date of recovery from the well of the\n\nvillage. He expressed his doubt, “…that accused had killed his\n\nwife and had thereafter thrown her into the well”. This being the\n\nonly statement that he made against the accused. But what is\n\nhis source of such information, he does not disclose. In any\n\nevent such a deposition is only in the nature of hearsay and no\n\nmore, which is also uncorroborated. However, significantly, he\n\nadmits that the accused had already reported the matter to the\n\nPolice and that no case of ill-treatment of the deceased was ever\n\nregistered against the appellant.\n\n11.Perusal of the testimony given by Nandish Yadav (PW-10), son of\n\nthe maternal brother of PW-2, in our considered view, is also of\n\nno consequence in advancing or establishing the case of the\n\nprosecution. He only states that, “we suspected” the role of the\n\naccused “for he used to beat her often”. Elaborating further, he\n\nstates that such fact was disclosed to him by the villagers. We\n\nfind that this statement, apart from being in the nature of\n\nhearsay, is vague and unspecific with regard to time, place and\n\nmanner of alleged cruelty. It is on such counts that he suspected\n\nthe accused to have murdered the deceased. Significantly, in the\ncross-examination part of his testimony, we notice all these facts\n\nto have been deposed for the first time in the Court and as we\n\nhave noticed in the testimony of PW-9 that no complaint of ill-\n\ntreatment was ever reported to anyone. Hence, therefore, the\n\ncase of the prosecution stands unproven.\n\n12.The Trial Court in its judgment, while convicting the accused,\n\nheavily relied upon the statement of PW-9 and the purported\n\nstatement of the Investigating Officer which is termed as UD\n\nExhibit marked as Exhibit 3/1. The relevant findings in the\n\njudgment is extracted as under :\n\n“The deceased’s death as the post mortem\nreport discloses was not due to drowning.\nFrom the evidence of P.W.9 and I.O. it\nappears that while the deceased was found\nmissing then on the next day the villagers\ntried to search her dead body in the said\nwell by means of Jhagar but it was not\nfound and on the next day the dead body\nwas found in the same well. So, these facts\nindicate that the deceased did not commit\nsuicide rather she was murdered and her\ndead body was thrown in the well and the\nfardbeyan of the accused regarding the\ndeath of the deceased is due to suicide does\nnot appear to be probable.”\n\n13.Similarly, the High Court, based its findings primarily on the\n\nUD, in arriving at the factum of guilt of the accused. The Court\n\nproceeded to add that:\n“The medical evidence suggests that the death\ntook place 48 to 96 hours prior to post mortem.\nAutopsy on the body of the deceased was done\non 14th August, 1988 at about 3 P.M. as per\nmedical evidence, if calculation is made, the\ndeceased died sometime between 12th August,\n1988 (about 3 P.M.) and 10th August, 1988\n(about 3 P.M.) that is why the I.O. suspected\nthat the deceased was murdered at least two\ndays before the post mortem. At least one day\nprior to the date of recovery of body, she was\nmurdered and her body was thrown in the well.”\n\n14. It is in this backdrop, that non-examination of the Investigating\n\nOfficer attains significance. It is not that the Investigating Officer\n\nwas not available or that the factum and manner of investigation\n\nwas deposed by his colleague who was also associated with the\n\nsame. Non-examination of the Investigation Officer has, in the\n\nattending circumstances rendered the prosecution case to be\n\ndoubtful if not false. The offence under\nSection 201\nIPC could\n\nnot have been proven without his examination.\n\n15.The Courts below presumptively, proceeded with the acquired\n\nassumption of the guilt of the accused for the reason that he was\n\nlastly seen with the deceased, and lodged a false report,\n\nforgetting that as per the version of the father of the deceased,\n\nfather of the accused had himself apprised him of his missing\n\ndaughter, at least two days prior to the incident. Doubt and\n\nsuspicion cannot form basis of guilt of the accused. The\ncircumstances linking the accused to the crime are not proven at\n\nall, much less beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n16.We may reiterate that, suspicion howsoever grave it may be,\n\nremains only a doubtful pigment in the story canvassed by the\n\nprosecution for establishing its case beyond any reasonable\n\ndoubt. [\nVenkatesh v. State of Karnataka\n, 2022 SCC OnLine\n\nSC 765;\nShatrughna Baban Meshram v. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n, (2021) 1 SCC 596;\nPappu v. State of Uttar\n\nPradesh\n, (2022) 10 SCC 321]. Save and except for the above,\n\nthere is no evidence: ocular, circumstantial or otherwise, which\n\ncould establish the guilt of the accused. There is no discovery of\n\nany fact linking the accused to the crime sought to be proved,\n\nmuch less, established by the prosecution beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n17.It is our bounden duty to ensure that miscarriage of justice is\n\navoided at all costs and the benefit of doubt, if any, given to the\n\naccused. [Hanumant Govind Nargundkar v. State of M.P.\n\n(1952) 2 SCC 71].\n18.In normal course of proceedings, this Court does not interfere\n\nwith the concurrent finding of facts reached by both the courts\n\nbelow. It is only in exceptional cases where we find the\n\nconcurrent findings to be absurd, leading to travesty of justice, it\n\nis our duty to rectify miscarriage of justice. [\nRamaphupala\n\nReddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n, (1970) 3 SCC 474, Balak\n\nRam v. State of U.P., (\n1975) 3 SCC 219, Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai\n\nV. State of Gujarat\n, (1983) 3 SCC 217].\n\n19.Hence, in our considered view, the courts below have seriously\n\nerred in passing the order of conviction based on incorrect and\n\nincomplete appreciation of evidence, causing serious prejudice to\n\nthe accused, also resulting into travesty of justice.\n\n20.In view of aforesaid, we find that the order of conviction and\n\nsentence passed by 5th Additional Sessions Judge, Palamau,\n\nDaltonganj in Sessions Trial Case No.50 of 1989 dated\n\n10.05.2001 as affirmed by the High Court of Jharkhand at\n\nRanchi in Criminal Appeal No.214 of 2001 dated 23.7.2004\n\ntitled as\nGuna Mahto v. State of Jharkhand\nneeds to be\n\ninterfered with.\n21.We set-aside the orders passed by both the courts below. Since\n\nthe appellant is already on bail, his bail bond shall stand\n\ndischarged.\n\n22.Appeal stands allowed.\n\n………………J.\n(B.R.
