No.13542 of 2019.\n\n2. The brief facts of the case are that on 06.07.2006,\n\nthe appellants notified contractual appointment. Pursuant to the\n\nadvertisement, members of the Employees Association-\n\nRespondents submitted their application and they were selected\n\nand appointed on 13.12.2006. Such a contract appointment was\n\nfor a period of one year and it was extendable from time to time\n\nand they were appointed on consolidated pay of Rs.5000/- per\n\nmonth.

In this backdrop, the members of the\n\nRespondents-Association filed C.W.J.C. No.5532 of 2019 in\n\nseeking a direction to extend A.C.P., M.A.C.P. and other service\n\nbenefits while counting the service rendered on contract basis\n\nduring the intervening period from 13.12.2006 till 31.03.2015.\n\nThe aforementioned writ petition was disposed of on 09.04.2019\n\nwith a direction to the Respondent-Association to consider\n\nrepresentation to the appellants. The Respondent-Association\n\nhad submitted representation on 03.04.2018 and it was rejected\n\non 29.04.2019. Rejection of the members of the respondents'\n\nclaim is the subject matter of C.W.J.C. No.13542 of 2019 and it\n\nwas decided in favour of the respondents-members of the\n\nAssociation to the extent that they are entitled to count the\n\ncontract service during the intervening period from 13.12.2006\n\nto 31.03.2015 for the purpose of service benefits towards grant\n\nof A.C.P. and M.A.C.P. and other service benefits.\n\n5. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n\norder of the learned Single Judge, the present L.P.A. is presented\n\nby the Appellants-Company.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted\n\nthat the service rendered by the members of the respondents are\n\nnot entitled to count the service of intervening period\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n7/28\n\nfrom13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 for the purpose of service\n\nbenefits like M.A.C.P. and other benefits for the reasons that\n\nthey have entered into the respective cadre on regular basis on\n\n31.03.2015\nvide Annexure-P7 to C.W.J.C. Such regularization\n\nof the members of the respondents are not with retrospective\n\neffect so as to claim any service benefits for contractual service.\n\nThe respondents have not questioned the validity of order dated\n\n31.03.2015 related to regularization to the effect that they are\n\nentitled to have the benefit of regularization with retrospective\n\neffect from the date they were initially appointed on contractual\n\nbasis, i.e., with effect from 13.12.2006. It is also submitted that\n\nconditions stipulated in the order dated 31.03.2015 insofar as\n\ncondition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix)a have not been questioned. In\n\nother words they have accepted the terms and conditions\n\nstipulated in the order of regularization dated 31.03.2015. It is\n\nfurther submitted that M.A.C.P. Rules/Schemes is applicable to\n\nonly regular holder of the post and not in respect of\n\nadhoc/contract employees during the intervening period from\n\nthe inception of M.A.C.P. Rules issued in the year 2010\n\n(M.A.C.P. Scheme dated 07.10.2010). No doubt, M.A.C.P.\n\nScheme 2010 was modified in respect of paragaph-9 while\n\nsubstituting the word \"adhoc/contract employee\" was\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n8/28\n\nsubstituted as only \"adhoc\" In other words, from the inception\n\nof the M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules issued in the year 2010 insofar\n\nas paragraph-9, the word \"contractual employee\" has been\n\nsubstituted to the extent of only \"adhoc employees\". Since the\n\nmembers of the respondents are not adhoc employees and they\n\ncannot claim any service benefits towards the M.A.C.P. benefits.\n\n7. In support of the aforementioned contentions,\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellants relied on two decisions of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court, namely, (2022) 2 Supreme Court\n\nCases 25 {Union of India and others Versus N. Murugesan\n\nand others (paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2)} and (2018) 9\n\nSupreme Court Cases 293 {K. Anbazhagan and another\n\nVersus Registrar General, High Court of Madras and\n\nanother (paragraphs-32, 34 and 36)}.\n\n8. It is further submitted that the learned Single\n\nJudge has not appreciated to the extent that the members of the\n\nrespondents have not questioned the validity of certain\n\nconditions stipulated in the order of the regularization dated\n\n31.03.2015 and so also has not apprised applicability of\n\nM.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010 read with modified on\n\n27.05.2013 to the extent of replacing of certain words in\n\nparagraph-9 of M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010. It is also\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n9/28\n\nsubmitted that the learned Single Judge has taken note of the\n\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Central\n\nInland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another\n\nVersus Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another {(1986) 3 SCC 156}\n\nto extend benefits to the respondents. The cited decision has no\n\nassistance to the respondents in the backdrop of regularization\n\norder and its condition read with eligibility clause in the\n\nM.A.C.P. Scheme. There is no challenge to the conditions\n\nstipulated in the order of regularization and so also Para-9 to the\n\nM.A.C.P. It is further submitted that the factual aspect of the\n\nmatter is required to be taken note of read with the decision of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court. To that effect, the learned Single\n\nJudge has committed error in extending relief to the members of\n\nthe respondents.\n\n9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents\n\nsubmitted that there is no error committed by the learned Single\n\nJudge. He has relied on clause-9 of the regularization order\n\ndated 31.03.2015. It is further submitted that modified M.A.C.P.\n\nnotification or letter dated 27.05.2013 which is restricted to the\n\nword \"adhoc\" while substituting \"adhoc and contractual\n\nemployee\". Contractual employees would also fall under the\n\ndefinition of adhoc employees. Therefore, the members of the\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n10/28\n\nrespondents are entitled to have the benefit of counting their\n\ncontractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 towards\n\ngrant of M.A.C.P. benefits. Hence, there is no infirmity in the\n\norder of the learned Single Judge so as to interfere and L.P.A. is\n\nliable to be rejected while affirming the order of the learned\n\nSingle Judge.\n\n10. Heard the learned counsels for the respective\n\nparties.\n\n11. Members of the respondents were appointed\n\non contract basis to various posts on 13.12.2006 and their\n\nservices were regularized on 31.03.2015 with the conditions\n\nstipulated cited supra. The respondents have not questioned the\n\nvalidity of certain conditions imposed in the order of the\n\nregularization in particularly condition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix) a\n\nand so also their regularization is prospective in nature, i.e., with\n\neffect from 31.03.2015 and they were regular holder of the\n\nvarious posts only with effect from 31.03.2015. In other words,\n\nthey were holders of substantive post w.e.f. 31.03.2015. For the\n\npurpose of extending M.A.C.P. benefits or any other service\n\nbenefits, such service is required to be taken only in respect of\n\nregular service rendered by an employee. In the present case,\n\ncontractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 cannot be\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n11/28\n\ncounted for the purpose of extending any service benefits. In the\n\nlight of conditions imposed in the order of regularization and\n\nPara-9 of M.A.C.P. Scheme. It is to be noted that service\n\nconditions ordinarily notified under\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India and eligibility clause invariably it is for\n\nregular employee unless and until regularization order is with\n\nretrospective effect. The respondents have not questioned the\n\nterms and conditions stipulated in the order of regularization,\n\n12. Paragraph-9 of the M.A.C.P.

Rules 2010, M.A.C.P. benefits\n\nwere not extended to adhoc employees and contractual\n\nemployees. By virtue of decision dated 27.05.2013, the State\n\nGovernment took a policy decision to the effect that such of\n\nthose adhoc employees and their services could be counted for\n\nthe purpose of extending M.A.C.P. under 2010 M.A.C.P.\n\nSchemes and it is crystal clear contractual employee have been\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n14/28\n\nexcluded.\n\n14. It is necessary to extract the relevant portion\n\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court decisions cited on behalf of the\n\nappellants. Paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2 of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt decision in the case of Union of India and others\n\nVersus N. Murugesan and others {(2022) 2 Supreme Court\n\nCases 25} read as under:\n\n\"25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit\nor passive acceptance. It is implied\nand reluctant consent to an act. In\nother words, such an action would\nqualify a passive assent. Thus, when\nacquiescence takes place, it\npresupposes knowledge against a\nparticular act. From the knowledge\ncomes passive acceptance, therefore\ninstead of taking any action against\nany alleged refusal to perform the\noriginal contract, despite adequate\nknowledge of its terms, and instead\nbeing allowed to continue by\nconsciously ignoring it and thereafter\nproceeding further, acquiescence does\ntake place. As a consequence, it\nreintroduces a new implied agreement\nbetween the parties. Once such a\nsituation arises, it is not open to the\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n15/28\n\nparty that acquiesced itself to insist\nupon the compliance of the original\nterms. Hence, what is essential, is the\nconduct of the parties. We only dealt\nwith the distinction involving a mere\nacquiescence. When acquiescence is\nfollowed by delay, it may become\nlaches. Here again, we are inclined to\nhold that the concept of acquiescence\nis to be seen on a case-to-case basis.\"\n\nApprobate and reprobate\n\n26. These phrases are borrowed from\nthe Scots law. They would only\nmean that no party can be allowed to\naccept and reject the same thing, and\nthus one cannot blow hot and cold.\n\nThe principle behind the doctrine of\nelection is inbuilt in the concept of\napprobate and reprobate. Once\nagain, it is a principle of equity\ncoming under the contours of\ncommon law. Therefore, he who\nknows that if he objects to an\ninstrument, he will not get the\nbenefit he wants cannot be allowed\nto do so while enjoying the fruits.\n\nOne cannot take advantage of one\npart while rejecting the rest. A\nperson cannot be allowed to have\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n16/28\n\nthe benefit of an instrument while\nquestioning the same. Such a party\neither has to affirm or disaffirm the\ntransaction. This principle has to be\napplied with more vigour as a\ncommon law principle, if such a\nparty actually enjoys the one part\nfully and on near completion of the\nsaid enjoyment, thereafter questions\nthe other part. An element of fair\nplay is inbuilt in this principle. It is\nalso a species of estoppel dealing\nwith the conduct of a party. We have\nalready dealt with the provisions of\nthe\nContract Act\nconcerning the\nconduct of a party, and his\npresumption of knowledge while\nconfirming an offer through his\nacceptance unconditionally.\n\n27.2.\nState of Punjab v. Dhanjit\nSingh Sandhu\n(2014) 15 SCC 144] :\n\n(SCC pp. 153-54, paras 22-23 &\n25-26)\n\n\"22. The doctrine of \"approbate\nand reprobate\" is only a species of\nestoppel, it implies only to the\nconduct of parties. As in the case of\nestoppel it cannot operate against\nthe provisions of a statute. (Vide\nCIT v. MR. P. Firm Muar [CIT v.\n\nMR. P.

It is settled proposition of law\nthat once an order has been passed,\nit is complied with, accepted by\nthe other party and derived the\nbenefit out of it, he cannot\nchallenge it on any ground. (Vide\nMaharashtra SRTC v. Balwant\nRegular Motor Service\n[Maharashtra SRTC v. Balwant\nRegular Motor Service, AIR 1969\nSC 329] .) In R.N. Gosain v.\n\nYashpal Dhir [R.N. Gosain v.\n\nYashpal Dhir, (1992) 4 SCC 683]\nthis Court has observed as under :\n\n(R.N. Gosain case [\nR.N. Gosain v.\nYashpal Dhir\n, (1992) 4 SCC 683] ,\nSCC pp. 687-88, para 10)\n'10. Law does not permit a person\nto both approbate and reprobate.\nThis principle is based on the\ndoctrine of election which\npostulates that no party can accept\nand reject the same instrument and\nthat 'a person cannot say at one\ntime that a transaction is valid and\nthereby obtain some advantage, to\nwhich he could only be entitled on\nthe footing that it is valid, and then\nturn round and say it is void for the\npurpose of securing some other\nadvantage'.'\n* * *\n\n25. The Supreme Court in\nRajasthan State Industrial\nDevelopment & Investment\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n18/28\n\nCorpn. v. Diamond & Gem\nDevelopment Corpn. Ltd\n.\n\n[\nRajasthan State Industrial\nDevelopment & Investment\nCorpn. v. Diamond & Gem\nDevelopment Corpn. Ltd.\n, (2013)\n5 SCC 470 : (2013) 3 SCC (Civ)\n153] , made an observation that a\nparty cannot be permitted to\n\"blow hot and cold\", \"fast and\nloose\" or \"approbate and\nreprobate\". Where one knowingly\naccepts the benefits of a contract\nor conveyance or an order, is\nestopped to deny the validity or\nbinding effect on him of such\ncontract or conveyance or order.\nThis rule is applied to do equity,\nhowever, it must not be applied in\na manner as to violate the\nprinciples of right and good\nconscience.\n\n26. It is evident that the doctrine\nof election is based on the rule of\nestoppel, the principle that one\ncannot approbate and reprobate is\ninherent in it. The doctrine of\nestoppel by election is one among\nthe species of estoppel in pais (or\nequitable estoppel), which is a\nrule of equity. By this law, a\nperson may be precluded, by way\nof his actions, or conduct, or\nsilence when he has to speak,\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n19/28\n\nfrom asserting a right which he\nwould have otherwise had.\"\n\n15. Paragraphs 32, 34 and 36 of the Supreme\n\nCourt decision in the case of K. Anbazhagan and another\n\nVersus Registrar General, High Court of Madras and\n\nanother {(2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 293} read as under:\n\n\"32. By Direction 10(16), this\nCourt had directed the State\nGovernments to ensure\ncompliance, hence, the terms and\nconditions of service of the\nappellants were same as those\nother judicial officers of the State\nas per order of this Court. The\nHigh Court in its judgment\nalthough observed that Fast Track\nCourts cannot be said to have\nbeen created in \"pensionable\nestablishment\" but the said\nconclusion has been arrived at\nwithout considering relevant\nmaterials and without giving any\ncogent reasons. We thus are of the\nview that appointment of the\nappellants was in \"pensionable\nestablishment\".\n\n34. In service jurisprudence, the\nappointments are made by the\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n20/28\n\nemployer with different\nnomenclature/characteristics.\n\nAppointments are made both on\npermanent or temporary basis\nagainst permanent post or\ntemporary post. The appointment\ncan also be made on ad hoc basis\non permanent or temporary post.\n\nThere is one common feature of\nappointments of permanent,\ntemporary or ad hoc appointment\ni.e. those appointments are made\nagainst the post whether\npermanent or temporary. On the\ncontrary, for contractual\nappointment, there is no\nrequirement of existence of any\npost. A contractual appointment\nis not normally made against a\npost. Further, contractual\nappointments are also not\nnormally on pay scale. On the\nmere fact that the advertisement\nas well as the appointment was\nmade initially for a period of five\nyears, the nature of appointment\nof the appellants cannot be\ntermed as contractual\nappointment. When a\ngovernment servant is\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n21/28\n\ncontemplated to hold a certain\npost for a limited period it is a\ntenure post.\n\n36. The fact that the\nadvertisement limited the\nappointment for a period of five\nyears only because the posts were\ncontemplated for five years only,\nthe appointment of the appellants\nat best can be said as \"tenure\nappointment\". Although\ntemporary, ad hoc and\ncontractual appointments are\nused in contradiction to a regular\nand permanent appointment but\nbetween ad hoc appointment and\ncontract appointment, distinction\nis there in service jurisprudence\nand both the expressions cannot\nbe interchangeably used. When\nthe advertisement against which\nthe appellants were appointed\nand the appointment order\nmentions the appointment as ad\nhoc appointment, we cannot\napprove the view of the High\nCourt that the nature of the\nappointment of the appellants\nwas only a contractual\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n22/28\n\nappointment.\n\n16. (2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 293 {K.\n\nAnbazhagan and another Versus Registrar General, High\n\nCourt of Madras and another} decision has some bearing and\n\nits supports the argument of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants insofar as distinguishing contractual employee and\n\nregular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court distinguished\n\nadhoc employee and regular employee in the case of\nState of\n\nKarnataka and Others vs. Uma Devi\nreported in (2006) 4\n\nSCC 1 read with full bench decision of this Court in the case of\n\nRam Sevak Yadav and Another vs. The State of Bihar and\n\nOthers\nin C.W.J.C. Nos. 267 and 472 reported in 2013 (1)\n\nPLJR 964. Therefore, the contentions of the respondents to the\n\neffect that contractual employee could be treated as adhoc\n\nemployee is impermissible.\n\n17. The learned Single Judge proceeded to allow\n\nthe petition of the respondents with reference to decision in the\n\ncase of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation\n\nLimited and another Versus Brojo Nath Ganguly and\n\nAnother {(1986) 3 SCC 156}. The aforementioned decision is\n\ndistinguishable to the extent that for the purpose of claim of the\n\nrespondents are entitled to M.A.C.P. while counting service of\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n23/28\n\ncontractual service during the intervening period from\n\n13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 read with the conditions stipulated in\n\nthe order of regularization and in not questioning Para-9 of the\n\nmodified M.A.C.P. dated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing the\n\ncertain words \"adhoc and contractual employee\" in 2010\n\nM.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules and restricted only to the extent of\n\nadhoc employees. The cited decision is not applicable in view\n\nof the of Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in the case of\nNair\n\nService Society vs. Dr. T. Beermasthan\nreported in (2009) 5\n\nSCC 545. Paragraph No. 48 thereof reads as under:\n\n\"48. Several decisions have\nbeen cited before us by the\nrespondents, but it is well\nestablished that judgments\nin service jurisprudence\nshould be understood with\nreference to the particular\nservice rules in the State\ngoverning that field.\n\nReservation provisions are\nenabling provisions, and\ndifferent State Governments\ncan have different methods\nof reservation. There is no\n\n(Underline supplied)\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n24/28\n\nchallenge to the Rules, and\nwhat is challenged is in the\nmatter of application alone.\n\nIn our opinion the\ncommunal rotation has to be\napplied taking 20 vacancies\nas a block.\"\n\n18. The principle\nlaid down in\nthe\n\naforementioned case is that before taking note of any judicial\n\npronouncement it is for the Court to analyze the factual aspects\n\nof the matter read with the relevant rules or executive order\n\ngoverning particular post. In the present case, service\n\nconditions have been stipulated in the order of regularization. If\n\nthere are any arbitrariness in the condition stipulated in the order\n\nof regularization, the respondents have failed to question the\n\nsame. Further, they have failed to question modified M.A.C.P.\n\ndated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing certain words in\n\nparagraph-9 of M.A.C.P. 2010 Schemes and it is beneficial to\n\nonly ad hoc employee and not to contractual employee.\n\n19. Taking note of these factual aspects as well\n\nas the principle\nlaid down by\nthe various judicial\n\npronouncements that at no point of time, contractual employees\n\nservices could be counted for service benefits unless and until\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n25/28\n\nregularization order stipulates that regular employees is entitled\n\nto count contractual service towards other service benefits.\n\nWhereas in terms of conditions in the regularization order dated\n\n31.03.2015, Respondents are not entitled to count contractual\n\nservice towards M.A.C.P. benefits.\n\n20. In the present case, in fact, conditions\n\nstipulated in the order of the regularization is disadvantage to\n\nthe respondents' members. In other words, whatever the service\n\nbenefits which were to be given to the regular employee like the\n\nmembers of the respondents are with prospective effect, namely,\n\nwith effect from 31.03.2015, the date on which their services\n\nwere regularized.\n\n21. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nDirector General, Doordarshan Prasar Bharti Corporation\n\nof India and Anr. Vs. Smt. Magi H Desai-2023 Live Law\n\n(SC\n) 248 in paragraphs-5 and 9 it is held as under:\n\n\"5. We have heard learned counsel for the\nrespective parties at length.\n\nAt the outset, it is required to be noted and it\nis an admitted position that for the period\nbetween 1985 till 31.03.1995 the respondent\nserved as a casual/contractual employee and\nher services came to be regularised as per the\nScheme w.e.f. 31.03.1995. As such, under\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n26/28\n\nthe Scheme of Regularisation, there is no\nmention that the casual services shall be\ncounted towards service benefits/ pensionary\nbenefits. Even as per the clarification issued\nby the DOPT in the year 2009, it was\nclarified that such appointee is not entitled to\nclaim any benefit out of the services\nrendered by him/her on contractual basis\nbefore he/she was appointed on regular basis\non a government post.\n\n9. Now so far as the submission on behalf of\nthe respondent that in other departments\nunder the scheme the employees of such\ndepartments are entitled to their services\nrendered as casual/contractual counted for\nqualifying service for pensionary/service\nbenefits is concerned, merely because some\nother departments might have such schemes,\nthe respondent shall not be entitled to the\nsame benefit in absence of any scheme in the\nappellants' department/ department in which\nthe respondent rendered her services. The\nappellant - Doordarshan Prasar Bharti\nCorporation of India is an autonomous\nindependent department/body. As observed\nhereinabove, neither the rule nor the\nregularisation scheme provide that services\nrendered as casual/contractual shall be\ntreated as temporary service and/or the same\nshall be counted for the purposes of\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n27/28\n\npensionary/ service benefits.\"\n\nIn the case of K. Anbazhagan and another cited\n\nSupra in paragraph 34 aptly applicable to the present case.\n\n22. Adhoc/contractual employee means an\n\nemployee, whose services have been engaged for specific\n\npurpose and for specific period or for work essentially\n\ntemporarily in nature. Further, adhoc means appointment for a\n\nparticular job for adhoc or temporarily employee. The adhoc\n\nappointments are not contractual. Such a distinction has been\n\nmade by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.\n\nAnbazhagan and another cited Supra decided on 13.08.2018.\n\nIn the cited decision, it is observed that although temporary,\n\nadhoc and contractual appointment are used in contradiction to a\n\nregular and permanent appointment but between adhoc and\n\ncontract appointment, distinction is there in service\n\njurisprudence and both the expressions cannot be\n\ninterchangeably used.\n\n23. Contractual employees whose services are\n\nregularized on the basis of past temporary service, shall not be\n\nentitled to any other benefits from the original date of his\n\njoining on contractual basis or from any other retrospective date\n\nas is evident from the conditions stipulated in the order of\nPatna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024\n\n28/28\n\nregularization dated 31.05.2015. As long as those conditions are\n\nnot questioned before competent forum and such conditions are\n\nset aside in such an event only the respondents are entitled to\n\nhave certain benefits with reference to past contractual service.\n\nAs on this day whatever the terms and conditions stipulated in\n\nthe order of regularization dated 31.03.2015 are intact,\n\ntherefore, the learned Single Judge has committed error in\n\nallowing the writ petition.\n\n24. Accordingly, the appellants have made out a\n\ncase so as to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge\n\ndated 07.08.2019 and it is set aside while rejecting C.W.J.C.\n\nNo.13542 of 2019.\n\n25. The present L.P.A. stands allowed.\n\n(P. B. Bajanthri, J)\n\n( Ramesh Chand Malviya, J)\n\nP.S./-\n\nAFR/NAFR A.F.R\nCAV DATE N.A\nUploading Date 20.02.2024\nTransmission Date N.A",
