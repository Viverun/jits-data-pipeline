The following course of events have culminated into the present\ndispute between the parties and has also led to the filing of the instant\npetition:-\n\ni. The petitioner is a limited liability Partnership\nincorporated under the\nLimited Liability Partnership Act,\n, having LLP Identification No. AAM-4745 and\nhaving its registered office at 477/4 Basai Road, Ram\nNagar, Gurugram-122001.

Under the terms of the\nCollaboration Agreement, the petitioner was, inter alia,\nobliged to apply for licence/ approvals/ permits/\ncertification etc. for the development of the property in a\ntimely and orderly manner.\n\niv. In the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, an\nirrevocable General Power of Attorney dated 15th May,\n2018 was also executed in favour of the petitioner for the\npetitioner, amongst others, to apply and obtain\nlicence/sanction for converting the property from its\nagricultural use to any other suitable use and as also to\nget the plan sanctioned from the concerned authority for\ndeveloping a residential complex at the said property.\n\nv.

On 3rd June, 2019, the petitioner and the respondent No.1\nexecuted a First Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement whereby:\n\na. The land for development was reduced\nfrom 119 Kanal & 6 Marla to 94 Kanal &\n7 Marla equivalent to 11.79375 acres;\n\nb. The non-refundable earnest money was\nreduced to at INR.4,21,62,656/- as also the\narea to be allocated to the respondent No.1\nwas reduced to a piece of land\nadmeasuring 12,973 square yards.\n\nvii. In view of the First Supplementary Agreement, the\nrespondent No.1 issued a fresh General Power of\nAttorney dated 3rd June, 2019. But no specific reason\nhad been assigned for execution of the First\nSupplementary Agreement by the petitioner. On 20th\nApril, 2019, the petitioner‟s cheque bearing No. 000049\ndated 15.3.2019 for Rs.1,46,50,000/- drawn on HDFC\nBank in favour of respondent No.1 for the part payment\nof the above mentioned security amount was\ndishonoured due to \" insufficient funds\".\n\nviii. It is the respondents‟ case that it was to help the\npetitioner and to cure the default of Rs.1,46,50,000/-, the\nrespondent No.1 agreed to reduce the development area\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 5 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nas a result of which First Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement was executed.\n\nix. The Collaboration Agreement stood terminated by the\nrespondent No.1 by way of a letter dated 29th September,\n2021. However, it is the petitioner‟s case that the\npetitioner never received any communication from the\nrespondent No.1 seeking to terminate the Collaboration\nAgreement and it was only during the hearing of the\npresent petition, the petitioner came to know about the\npurported termination letter.\n\nx. In the interregnum a Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement dated 17.8.2020 was executed\nwhich is vehemently disputed by the petitioner as being a\nforged and fabricated document.\n\nxi. It is the petitioner‟s case that on 14.12.2022 on receipt of\na phone call regarding the said property for being put for\nsale, the petitioner made enquiry on 15.12.2022, when it\nwas confronted with the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement. As per the petitioner, there\nwas no such Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement nor was there any authorization granted to the\nrespondent No.2 to execute such agreement on behalf of\nthe petitioner in respect of the said property. It is also the\ncase of the petitioner that on 19.12.2022, it was further\nconfronted with the deed of cancellation dated 29.9.2021\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 6 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ncancelling the General Power of Attorney dated 3.6.2019\nissued by the respondent No.1 in terms of the\nCollaboration Agreement.\n\nxii. Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court seeking\ninterim protection qua the Collaboration Property\nsubmitting to the effect that there is a serious and\ngenuine apprehension that the respondent No.1 and 2\nwould create third party rights in the Collaboration\nProperty to defeat the rights of the petitioner.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\nOn behalf of the Petitioner\n\n3. Mr.Rajiv Nayar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the\npetitioner submitted that the respondent No.1 and the respondent No.2\nhave been acting in collusion and attempting to defeat the rights of the\npetitioner in the Collaboration Property. It is submitted that the\nCollaboration Agreement dated 15th May, 2018 was an indeterminable\ncontract, therefore, created indefensible rights in favour of the petitioner.\nHowever, the respondents have sought to terminate the contract by way\nof entering into a Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement\ndespite the fact that, by way of the Collaboration Agreement, indefeasible\nrights had been created in favour of the petitioner and the petitioner was\nin physical possession of the Collaboration Property.\n\n4. It is further submitted that the petitioner has paid an amount of\nRs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No.1 and for its possession of the\nCollaboration Property, the petitioner has fulfilled its obligations under\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 7 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nthe Collaboration Agreement. Even otherwise, the petitioner has always\nbeen ready and willing to perform its part under the Collaboration\nAgreement and has been taking all necessary steps to obtain the required\nlicence. However, it is the respondent No.1 who in connivance with\nrespondent No.2 is attempting to come out of the Collaboration\nAgreement by relying on false and fabricated documents. Therefore, the\npetitioner having a strong prima facie case in its favour is entitled to the\nrelief of Specific Performance of the Collaboration Agreement and\npreservation of the Collaboration Property being the subject matter of the\ndispute between the parties.\n\n5. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner further\nsubmitted that the petitioner and even the respondent No. 1 were working\ntowards achieving the development of the Collaboration Property and\nobtaining all statutory permissions, licenses and regulatory approvals\nrequired thereof. Acting upon the said Collaboration Agreement, a license\nfor the development of the said land had been applied for on 16 th May,\n2018 by the petitioner vide License No. CTP/12558/2018. However, the\npetitioner came to know only on 14th December, 2022 that the respondent\nNo. 1 had put up the Collaboration Property for sale in the market.\n\n6. It is also argued on behalf of the petitioner that the Second\nSupplementary Collaboration Agreement is a forged and fabricated\ndocument created by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 as an excuse to wriggle\nout of the binding Collaboration Agreement and defraud the petitioner. In\nthis regard it was contended that no such agreement was executed by the\npetitioner nor any permission/authorization was granted by the petitioner\nto the respondent No.2 to execute any such so called Second\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 8 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nSupplementary Collaboration Agreement in respect of the Collaboration\nProperty. Further, the clauses in the Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement are unconscionable and virtually efface the understanding,\nrights and obligations under the original Collaboration Agreement dated\n15th May, 2018. It was argued that the said Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement seeks to change the very nature of the\nCollaboration Agreement from an indeterminable to a determinable\ncontract.\n\n7. It was further submitted that the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement is supported by a false resolution dated 3rd June,\n2019 which is also a fabricated document created by the respondents in\ncahoots with each other, i.e., respondent Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n8. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted\nthat on 15th December, 2022, the petitioner made an enquiry at the office\nof the Sub-Registrar, District Sohna. The petitioner attempted to confront\nthe respondent No.2, however, no communication could be made with the\nrespondent No.1. It is further submitted that immediately upon coming to\nknow of the fraudulent acts of the respondent No. 2, the petitioner\nremoved the respondent No.2 as a partner on 20th December, 2022.\n\n9. The learned senior counsel submitted that Clause 1.3 of the\nCollaboration Agreement specifically provided that the respondent No. 1\nshall hand over the physical possession of the Collaboration Property to\nthe petitioner and the entire area to be developed and constructed on the\nCollaboration Property shall exclusively belong to the petitioner for the\nbenefit of the petitioner. It is further stipulated that the respondent no. 1\nshall not in any way interfere with or obstruct the development of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 9 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nCollaboration Property. As per the updated Clause 2 of the Collaboration\nAgreement, the non-refundable earnest money to be paid by the petitioner\nto the respondent no. 1, which was reduced to Rs. 4,21,62,656/-, was also\nduly paid by the petitioner to the respondent no. 1. Yet the respondent, in\nblatant violation of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, entered\ninto a Supplementary Agreement.\n\n10. It is submitted that the petitioner had filed the instant petition\nseeking the reliefs as aforementioned, the reliefs qua the Collaboration\nProperty so as to restrain the respondents from creating any third party\ninterest in the said Property.\n\n11. It is submitted that the Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement changes the very edifice and nature of the Collaboration\nAgreement dated 15th May 2018 by introduction of certain clauses which\nare unconscionable and allow the respondent no. 1 to exit the\nCollaboration Agreement while at the same time forfeiting a huge\nconsideration of more than Rs.4.21 Crores paid, without having invested\na single penny. The said Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement\nalso seeks to change the very nature of the Collaboration Agreement from\nindeterminable to a determinable contract at the option of the respondent\nno. 1, on events which are not within the control of the petitioner.\n\n12. The learned senior counsel submitted that it is ex-facie apparent\nthat the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in collusion with each other have, with\nill intention, devised a stratagem to cheat and defraud the petitioner by,\non the one hand, executing a Collaboration Agreement with the petitioner\nand taking a huge consideration of Rs.4.21 Crores and, on the other hand,\nby seeking to create third party rights in the Collaboration Property by\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 10 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\noffering it for sale in the market. This action of the respondents is in the\nteeth of the Collaboration Agreement which creates indefensible rights in\nfavour of the petitioner and is inherently a contract which is\nindeterminable in nature.\n\n13. It is further submitted that the petitioner is entitled to specific\nperformance of the Collaboration Agreement dated 15th May 2018 since it\nhas performed all its obligations under the Agreement and has also paid a\nconsideration of Rs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No. 1. Moreover, the\nCollaboration Property ought to be preserved in favour of the petitioner.\n\n14. Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that\nirreparable harm and injury would be caused to the petitioner inasmuch as\nthe Collaboration Property is a unique parcel of land and has huge\npotential for development and the petitioner is already in physical\npossession of the land and has taken various steps in order to obtain\nlicenses for the development of the Collaboration Property. The petitioner\nhas, for the last 4 years, spent a huge amount of time, money and efforts\nin furtherance of the Collaboration Agreement including having paid a\nsum of approximately Rs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No. 1. It is further\nsubmitted that no prejudice whatsoever would be caused to the\nrespondents in the event the respondents are directed to maintain status\nquo as to the right, title, interest, and possession of the Collaboration\nProperty pending Arbitration proceedings. It is further submitted that the\nbalance of convenience is also entirely in favour of the petitioner and\nagainst the respondent No. 1 who has with open eyes executed the\nCollaboration Agreement and already received a valuable consideration\nfor the same.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 11 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\n15. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner further\nargued that under\nSection 10\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963, (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"\nSpecific Relief Act\n\") the respondent No.1 cannot run away\nfrom the Collaboration Agreement through any device or artifice as the\ngrant-cum-relief of specific performance is mandatory, if the readiness\nand willingness on the part of the petitioner is proved. It is further\nsubmitted that in the present case the conduct of the petitioner has been\nblemish free and the petitioner has expressed its readiness and willingness\nat each stage of the transaction. Thus, the respondent No.1 cannot be\nallowed to frustrate the Collaboration Agreement by alienating the\nCollaboration Property and reducing the petitioner‟s claim to only\ndamages.\n\n16.\nIn support of its contentions, reliance has been placed on behalf of\nthe petitioner on the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nB.\nSantoshamma V. D. Sarala\n; 2020 (\n19) SCC 80, N. Srinivasa V.\nKuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd.\n; (2009) 5 SCC 182 and the judgment of\nthis Court in\nDLF Home Developers Ltd. V. Shipra Estate Ltd. & Ors.\n;\n2021 SCC OnLine Del 4902.\n\n17. Therefore, it is prayed that the instant petition be allowed and the\nreliefs sought be granted in favour of the petitioner.\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents\n(RESPONDENT No.1)\n\n18. Mr.Neeraj Malhotra, the learned senior counsel appearing for the\nrespondent No.1 at the first instance raised objection to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 12 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nmaintainability of the petition on the grounds of concealment and\nsuppression of material facts.\n\n19. It is submitted that the petitioner has suppressed the fact that the\nCollaboration Agreement stands terminated and the petitioner itself has\nfiled on record the Deed of Cancellation dated 29th September 2021 as\nAnnexure P-10 to the petition.\n\n20. It is submitted that the petitioner has wrongly stated that it has\nfulfilled its obligations as per the Collaboration Agreement. It is further\nsubmitted that as per Clause 2.14 of the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement dated 17th August 2020, the petitioner was to\nobtain license of the project to be developed on the Collaboration\nProperty by 15th December 2020, however, the petitioner failed to do so.\nIt is further submitted that the petitioner even failed to obtain the required\nlicense for the project for almost 40 months, i.e., till the termination of\nthe Collaboration Agreement and that even till the filing of the instant\npetition, the said license was not obtained. It is further submitted that\nsince, the license was not obtained by the petitioner, the respondent no. 1\nwas left with no other option but to terminate the Collaboration\nAgreement and the General Power of Attorney vide a Legal Notice dated\n29th September 2021.\n\n21. It is also submitted that there were consistent defaults on the part\nof the petitioner submitting to the effect that after execution of the\npetitioner failed to pay towards the part payment of the security amount\nas ITS cheque was dishonoured due to \" Insufficient Funds\" . It is further\nsubmitted that the petitioner never had any financial capacity to perform\nits commitments. It is further submitted that to help the petitioner and to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 13 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ncure the default of Rs.1.465 Crores the respondent no.1 agreed to reduce\nthe development area and resultantly the First Supplement Collaboration\nAgreement was executed. It is further submitted that on account of the\ndelays on the part of the petitioner, when the licence was not forth\ncoming, after waiting for two years the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement dated 17th August, 2020 was executed so as to\nput a long stop date on obtaining the licence. It is further submitted that\nwhen the long stop date also got crossed without the receipt of licence\nand after further wait of nine months, the respondent No.1 had no choice\nbut to terminate the agreement which was in the knowledge of the\npetitioner.\n\n22. It was argued that it is only when the DTCP, vide its order dated\n16th March, 2021 finally returned the application of the petitioner for\ngrant of licence for the project, and when the respondent No.1 came to\nknow about it, the respondent No.1 terminated the Collaboration\nAgreement and cancelled the General Power of Attorney vide notice\ndated 29th September, 2021, whereafter the possession of the\nCollaboration Property was to be restored in the name of the respondent\nNo.1 which fact was well within the knowledge of the petitioner and its\npartners.\n\n23. It is further submitted on behalf of the respondent No.1 that\npetitioner has been siting over the land of the respondent No.1 for more\nthan five years even without obtaining the required licence and that an\namount of Rs.4.21 Crores can never be a sufficient consideration for the\nland now worth Rs.120 Crores.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 14 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\n24. It is further submitted on behalf of the respondent that upon the\ntermination of the Collaboration Agreement the arbitration clause\nprovided for therein no longer remained in existence. It is further\nsubmitted that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate even a single\narbitral dispute giving rise to any cause of action for filing the instant\npetition.\n\n25. It is further submitted that petitioner has falsely stated that the\nrespondent No.1 and the respondent No.2 conspired to deceive the\npetitioner by creating a falsified Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent No.1 that the\nrespondent no.2 was the designated partner of the petitioner at the time of\nexecution of the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement.\nMoreover, the petitioner has not disputed the veracity of the First\nSupplementary Collaboration Agreement dated 3rd June, 2019 executed\nby the petitioner through its designated partner, i.e., respondent No.2 with\nthe respondent No.1. The said agreement was signed by the respondent\nNo.2 based on the authority granted in his favour by the petitioner vide a\nResolution dated 3rd June, 2019.\n\n26.

It is further submitted that even after\nwithdrawal of the authority on 2nd March, 2021, the Minutes of Meeting\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 15 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nof the subsequent calendar does not even whisper anything of sort and\nrespondent No.2 continued to attend such meetings.\n\n27. It is submitted that as per Clause 2 of the Collaboration Agreement\ndated 15th May, 2018, the petitioner was required to pay a non-refundable\nsecurity deposit of Rs.5,96,50,000/- to the respondent No.1. However,\nthe petitioner failed to pay the entire amount of the security deposit and\non 20th April, 2019, cheque No. No.000049 dated 15th March, 2019 for\nRs.1,46,50,000/- drawn on HDFC Bank issued by the petitioner in favour\nof the respondent No.1 for the part payment of the above said security\ndeposit was dishonoured due to \"Insufficient Funds\" . It is submitted that\nthis clearly establishes that the petitioner never had any financial capacity\nto complete its part of obligations.\n\n28. It is further submitted that the petitioner in this petition has alleged\nfraud and fabrication, however, the said issues cannot be decided by this\nCourt in the proceedings arising under the Act.\n\n29. The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.1\nsubmitted that the petitioner by way of present petition is seeking to sit\ntight on the Collaboration Property which exclusively belongs to the\nrespondent No. l, by distorting and misrepresenting the facts before this\nCourt and thus the respondent no. 1 is made to suffer hardship due to\nfailures and inactions of the petitioner. It is submitted that the\nCollaboration Property is worth more than Rs.100 Crores and the\npetitioner is trying to grab the property by paying a paltry security deposit\nof Rs.4.21 Crores.\n\n30. It is further argued that in case as the present one in view of the\n\nSection 14(1)(c)\nread with\nSection 16\nand\nSection 14(1)(d)\nof the Specific\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 16 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nRelief Act, an injunction cannot be granted in favour of the petitioner.\nIn\nsupport of this contention, reliance has been placed on behalf of the\nrespondent No.1 upon the judgments in\nRajasthan Breweries Limited V.\nthe Stroh Brewery Company\n; 2000 SCC OnLine Del 481 and\nD.R.Sondhi V. Hella Kg Hueck & Co.; 2001 SCC OnLine Del 1273.\n\n31. To buttress the argument that the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement is not a forged and fabricated document, it was\nsubmitted by the respondent No.1 that respondent No.2 (who signed the\nSecond Supplementary Collaboration Agreement on behalf of the\npetitioner) was a designated partner of the petitioner at the time of\nexecution of the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement. The\nrespondent No.2 till the date of the execution of the Second\nSupplementary Collaboration Agreement was the designated partner of\nthe petitioner. The authority granted in favour of the respondent No.2 by\nthe petitioner vide a Board Resolution dated 3rd June 2019 was not\nwithdrawn by the petitioner, no earlier than 2nd March, 2021 which was\ndone much after the execution of the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement. The respondent No.1 has vehemently disputed\nthat the Board Resolution dated 3rd June 2019 is forged and fabricated.\n\n32. Therefore, it is submitted that the instant petition being devoid of\nmerit is liable to be dismissed.\n\n(RESPONDENT No.2)\n\n33. Ms. Radhika Bishwajit Dubey, learned counsel for the respondent\nNo. 2 also submitted that the present petition filed by the petitioner\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 17 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ndeserves to be dismissed summarily on the sole ground of concealment\nand suppression of material facts and various false and misleading\nstatements have been made by the petitioner in the present petition. It is\nsubmitted that the petitioner was well aware of the termination of the\nCollaboration Agreement.\n\n34. It is argued that the Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement is a validly executed agreement. So far as the Board\nResolution dated 3rd June, 2019 is concerned, it is submitted that the\npetitioner has not disputed or denied the issuance of authority or\nquestioned its validity or authenticity in favour of respondent No.2 in its\npetition. In fact, on the contrary, the petitioner has filed a set of\ndocuments in support of its petition which contains and refers to the said\nBoard Resolution.\n\n35. It is submitted that as per the Minutes of the Meeting dated 2nd\nMarch, 2021, the old Resolutions were terminated from 2nd March, 2021\nonwards. Assuming without admitting that no authority was given in\nfavour of the respondent No.2 by the petitioner vide Resolution dated 3rd\nJune, 2019, then the First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement\nshould also not be a valid document. However, the petitioner has not\ndisputed or denied the existence of the First Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement.\n\n36. Ms.Dubey further submitted that it was also in the knowledge of\nthe petitioner that the Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 was a document\nfiled along with the First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement with\nthe Sub-Registrar‟s office in Gurgaon. It is only through the rejoinder to\nthe short reply filed on behalf of the respondent No.2 that the petitioner\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 18 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nfor the first time questioned the said Board Resolution dated 3 rd June,\n2019 filed by the petitioner itself and introduced new facts and\ndocuments which the respondent No.2 vehemently denies.\n\n37. It is further submitted that the documents filed along with the\nrejoinder by the petitioner are false, forged and fabricated and Resolution\ndated 3rd June, 2019, sought to be challenged in the rejoinder, has been in\nexistence prior to the filing of the petition. It is submitted that nothing\nprecluded the petitioner to file the same with the petition. It is only after\nthe respondent No.2‟s reply that petitioner through its rejoinder sought to\nchallenge the purported Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 which was in\nexistence earlier.\n\n38. It is the case of the respondent No.2 that when the petitioner raised\na question as to the authenticity of the document for the first time\nthrough its rejoinder, the respondent No.2 approached the Sub-Registrar‟s\noffice to get a certified copy of the First Collaboration Agreement, the\nrespondent No.2 was shocked to discover that the petitioner in collusion\nwith the staff at the Sub-Registrar‟s office tried to replace the original\nResolution dated 3rd June, 2019 with the purported Resolution dated 3 rd\nJune, 2019. The respondent No.2 immediately complained to the\nTehsildar Sohna about the same who in turn got an FIR bearing 0065\ndated 7th February, 2023 lodged with the Haryana Police, City Sohna\nPolice Station.\n\n39. It is further submitted that the copy of the Minutes of the Meeting\ndated 27th June, 2019 and 29th June, 2019 are fabricated for they bear the\nsignatures of Mr.Deepak Kumar Agarwal alone despite the Minutes of\nMeetings noting the presence of other persons including respondent No.2.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 19 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nIt is further submitted that a bare comparison of the Minutes of Meetings\nfiled along with petition with the purported Minutes of Meetings filed\nwith petition bear the signatures of all present in those meetings as\nopposed to the purported Minutes of Meetings filed along with the\nrejoinder would show that the Minutes of Meetings filed with the petition\nbear the signatures of all present in those meetings as opposed to the\npurported Minutes of Meetings filed with the rejoinder which bears the\nsignature of only Mr.Deepak Kumar Agarwal.\n\n40. It was also argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that the\npurported reports issued by the Forensics questioning the authenticity of\nthe Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement cannot be relied on\nfor the same are procured from a private party.\n\n41. Therefore, it is submitted that the instant petition is nothing but an\nabuse of process of law and warrants dismissal from this Court.\n\n42. Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties and\nperused the record.\n\nFINDINGS AND ANALYSIS\n\n43. In the instant case, the petitioner has invoked\nSection 10\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963 to submit that it was entitled to specific\nperformance of the contract, that is, the Collaboration Agreement dated\n15th May 2018. For a proper adjudication of this claim raised by the\npetitioner, it is pertinent to examine the provision and the bearing it may\nhave on the facts and circumstances of the instant case.\n\n44.\nSection 10\nof the Specific Relief Act is reproduced hereunder:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 20 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\n\"CONTRACTS WHICH CAN BE SPECIFICALLY\nENFORCED\n\n10. Specific performance in respect of contracts.--The\nspecific performance of a contract shall be enforced by\nthe court subject to the provisions contained in sub-\n\nsection (2) of\nsection 11\n,\nsection 14\nand\nsection 16\n.\"\n\n45.\nSection 10\nof the Specific Relief Act, which provides for specific\nperformance of a contract, acts as an enabling provision which a party to\na contract may invoke to seek its enforcement with the intervention of the\ncourts. The provision is to be read with\nSections 11(2)\n,\nand\nof the\nsaid Act which provide for situations in which specific performance of a\ncontract may not be invoked or is barred.\n\n46. The relief of specific performance is an equitable relief. As per the\namended Act, the courts no longer have discretionary powers under the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\nwhile granting such a relief. The court may be\nrequired to be satisfied on certain tests before granting the relief of\nspecific performance, however, upon fulfilment of the ingredients and\nsatisfaction of the court, a relief of specific performance may mandatorily\nbe granted. To this effect, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nKatta Sujatha\nReddy v. Siddamsetty Infra Projects (P) Ltd.\n, (2023) 1 SCC 355 while\nholding that the amendments brought to the\nSpecific Relief Act\nin the\nyear 2018 are prospective and not retrospective in nature, observed as\nunder:-\n\n\"44. We may note that the\nSpecific Relief Act,\nis the second legislation, replacing the\nearlier 1877 enactment of the\nSpecific Relief\nAct\n.

In Common\nLaw, the remedy of specific performance was\nunknown in the initial days and courts only\ngranted damages for the value of goods if there\nwas any breach of contract. Accordingly\nEnglish courts, in the early years, granted\nmonetary relief. In order to rectify the harsh\nstance of law, Courts of Equity in England\nstarted granting relief of specific performance if\nthe Court of Equity found that granting\ndamages would be inadequate or some special\nequitable rights of the plaintiff under a trust\nhave been breached.\n\n45. In any case, grant of such relief, which\nemanated from equitable principles, remained\ndiscretionary. This principle is clearly\nexplained by Swinfen Eady M.R., in Whiteley\nLtd. v. Hilt [Whiteley Ltd. v. Hilt, (1918) 2 KB\n808 (CA)] , in the following manner : (KB p.\n\n819)\n\"... the power vested in the Court to order\nthe delivery up of a particular chattel is\ndiscretionary, and ought not to be\nexercised when the chattel is an ordinary\narticle of commerce and of no special\nvalue or interest, and not alleged to be of\nany special value to the plaintiff, and\nwhere the damages would fully\ncompensate.\"\n\n46. However, this was not the position under the\nCivil Law. Under the Civil Law of contracts,\nadherence to the sanctity of contract is enforced\nwith greater rigour by inversing the situation.\nThe reason for choice of damages and specific\nperformance range from legal to economic. It is\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 22 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nin this context that the courts cannot engage on\nthe merits of having damages or specific\nperformance or a hybrid. It is best left to the\nlegislature to choose the course best-suited to\nthe economy without sheepishly following the\ntypecast approach in England or Civil Law\nsystems.\n\n48. We do not subscribe to the aforesaid\nreasoning provided by the High Court for the\nsimple reason that after the 2018 Amendment,\nspecific performance, which stood as a\ndiscretionary remedy, is not (sic now) codified\nas an enforceable right which is not dependent\nanymore on equitable principles expounded by\nJudges, rather it is founded on satisfaction of\nthe requisite ingredients as provided under the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\n. For determination of\nwhether a substituted law is procedural or\nsubstantive, reference to the nature of the\nparent enactment may not be material. Instead,\nit is the nature of the amendments which\ndetermine whether they are in the realm of\nprocedural or substantive law.\n\n51. In any case, the amendment carried out in\n2018 was enacted to further bolster adherence\nto the sanctity of contracts. This approach was\nradical and created new rights and obligations\nwhich did not exist prior to such an amendment.\n\nSection 10\n, after amendment, reads as under:\n\n\"10. Specific performance in respect of\ncontracts.--The specific performance of a\ncontract shall be enforced by the court\nsubject to the provisions contained in sub-\nsection (2) of\nSection 11\n,\nSection 14\nand\n\nSection 16\n.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 23 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\n52. This provision, which remained in the realm\nof the courts' discretion, was converted into a\nmandatory provision, prescribing a power the\ncourts had to exercise when the ingredients\nwere fulfilled. This was a significant step in the\ngrowth of commercial law as the sanctity of\ncontracts was reinforced with parties having to\ncomply with contracts and thereby reducing\nefficient breaches.\n\n53. Under the pre-amended\nSpecific Relief Act\n,\none of the major considerations for grant of\nspecific performance was the adequacy of\ndamages under\nSection 14(1)(a)\n. However, this\nconsideration has now been completely done\naway with, in order to provide better\ncompensation to the aggrieved party in the form\nof specific performance.\n\n54. Having come to the conclusion that the\n2018 Amendment was not a mere procedural\nenactment, rather it had substantive principles\nbuilt into its working, this Court cannot hold\nthat such amendments would apply\nretrospectively.\"\n\n47. However, the question before this Court is substantially different.\nIn the instant matter, the Collaboration Agreement between the parties\nalready stands terminated. The said termination has not been challenged\nby either the petitioner or even the respondent No. 2 (former designated\npartner of the petitioner). Therefore, the issue which remains is whether\nthe petitioner can seek specific performance of a contract which no\nlonger remains in existence. It is the petitioner‟s case that it was always\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 24 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nready and willing to perform its part of the obligations under the contract,\nhowever, the facts of the present case speak to the contrary.\n\n48. The cases cited on behalf of the petitioner, i.e.,\nB. Santoshamma\n\n(Supra),\nN. Srinivasa\n(Supra) and\nDLF Home Developers Ltd. V.\nShipra Estate Ltd. & Ors.\n; (Supra) in support of its arguments deal with\nfacts different from the present one and hence, are not applicable to the\ninstant dispute between the parties.\n\n49. It is trite law that continuous readiness and willingness on the part\nof the petitioner is a condition precedent for the grant of relief of Specific\nPerformance. It is the bounden duty of the petitioner to prove its\nreadiness and willingness by way of adducing evidence. The crucial facet\nhas to be determined by considering all the circumstances including\navailability of funds and mere statements or averment in the present\npetition of readiness and willingness would not suffice. Under\nSection\n16(c)\nof the Specific Relief Act, a distinction can be drawn between\nreadiness and willingness to perform the contract. Both ingredients are\nnecessary to be established for the grant of relief of the specific\nperformance.\n\n50. While readiness means the capacity of the petitioner to perform\nthe contract, willingness relates to the conduct of the petitioner. It is not\ndisputed that under the Collaboration Agreement (amended by the First\nSupplementary Agreement), the petitioner was required to get a licence\nfrom DTCP in a timely manner which it failed to get even after 5 years.\n\n51. Though this Court knows that the contract did not stipulate a\nparticular time period within which this licence was to be obtained, it\nought to have been obtained within a reasonable time period. Thus, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 25 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ntime period cannot be completely ignored. It is also not disputed that the\npetitioner was unable to make payment towards the earnest money as was\ninitially agreed between the parties, which was one of the crucial factors\nwhile executing the First Supplementary Agreement. It is also not\ndisputed that one of the post dated cheques handed over at the time of the\nCollaboration Agreement was dishonoured for \"Insufficient Funds\".\n\n52. In the present case, the petitioner through the Minutes of the\nMeeting filed has itself admitted about the worsen condition of the LLP\nand how the LLP has been observing serious financial crunch and losses\nwhich is effecting its state of affairs and market status. I am, thus, of the\nprima facie view that owing to failure to obtain the licence within\nreasonable time period and its adversely affected and worsening financial\ncondition, the petitioner has failed to prove its readiness and willingness\nto perform the essential terms of the Collaboration Agreement.\n\n53. The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent\nNo.1 argued that the petitioner had only paid an amount of Rs.4.21\nCrores as earnest money while the price of the land is about at INR 120\nCrores. Having paid an amount insignificant in comparison to the value\nof the property, the petitioner is not entitled to discretionary equitable\nrelief of specific performance. This Court finds weight in the argument as\nwas also observed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\nSaradamani\nKandappan vs S. Rajalakshmi & Ors\n; (2011) 12 SCC 18 in context of\nthe sale of an immoveable property. The relevant paragraphs of the\njudgment is set out herein below:\n\n\"37. The reality arising from this economic\nchange cannot continue to be ignored in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 26 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ndeciding cases relating to specific performance.\nThe steep increase in prices is a circumstance\nwhich makes it inequitable to grant the relief of\nspecific performance where the purchaser does\nnot take steps to complete the sale within the\nagreed period, and the vendor has not been\nresponsible for any delay or non-performance.\nA purchaser can no longer take shelter under\nthe principle that time is not of essence in\nperformance of contracts relating to immovable\nproperty, to cover his delays, laches, breaches\nand \"non-readiness\". The precedents from an\nera, when high inflation was unknown, holding\nthat time is not of the essence of the contract in\nregard to immovable properties, may no longer\napply, not because the principle laid down\ntherein is unsound or erroneous, but the\ncircumstances that existed when the said\nprinciple was evolved, no longer exist. In these\ndays of galloping increases in prices of\nimmovable properties, to hold that a vendor\nwho took an earnest money of say about 10% of\nthe sale price and agreed for three months or\nfour months as the period for performance, did\nnot intend that time should be the essence, will\nbe a cruel joke on him, and will result in\ninjustice. Adding to the misery is the delay in\ndisposal of cases relating to specific\nperformance, as suits and appeals therefrom\nroutinely take two to three decades to attain\nfinality. As a result, an owner agreeing to sell a\nproperty for rupees one lakh and received\nrupees ten thousand as advance may be\nrequired to execute a sale deed a quarter\ncentury later by receiving the remaining rupees\nninety thousand, when the property value has\nrisen to a crore of rupees.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 27 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nTherefore, it cannot be overlooked that, in fact, the Court is\nobliged to take initial notice of the phenomenal rise in the price of real\nestate.\n\n54. It has been contended on behalf of the petitioner that the\nCollaboration Agreement dated 15th May, 2018 was not a determinable\ncontract. To address this argument it is pertinent to refer to\nSection 14\nof\nthe Act which deals with the contracts which are not specifically\nenforceable by a Court and which reads as under:\n\n\"14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.--\nThe following contracts cannot be specifically\nenforced, namely:--\n\n(a) where a party to the contract has obtained\nsubstituted performance of contract in\naccordance with the provisions of\nsection 20\n;\n\n(b) a contract, the performance of which\ninvolves the performance of a continuous duty\nwhich the court cannot supervise;\n\n(c) a contract which is so dependent on the\npersonal qualifications of the parties that the\ncourt cannot enforce specific performance of its\nmaterial terms; and\n\n(d) a contract which is in its nature\ndeterminable.\"\n\nTherefore, upon a bare reading of the provision, the\nargument/contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is rejected.\n\n55. This also has bearing on injunctions which may be sought by the\nparties, as\nSection 41(e)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides that an\ninjunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a contract, the\nperformance of which would not be specifically enforced.

The records show that the Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement was executed between the parties which gives a right to the\nrespondent No.1 to terminate the agreement, in case the licence is not\nobtained by the particular days/date. It is an admitted fact that the\nrequired licence was not obtained by the petitioner within the stipulated\ntime period and respondent No.1 had executed a deed of cancellation\ndated 29th September, 2021 subsequently.\n\n57. It also cannot be ignored that respondent No.2 (a designated\npartner of the petitioner at that time), who had been authorized to sign the\nFirst Supplementary Collaboration Agreement, had executed the Second\nSupplementary Collaboration Agreement. The Board Resolution on the\nbasis of which the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement was\nsigned, which the petitioner now disputes, was the document produced by\nthe petitioner itself through its petition without challenge to the said\nBoard Resolution.\n\n58. The contention of the petitioner that the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement as also the Board Resolution is a forged and\nfabricated document is really a controversy between the petitioner and the\nrespondent No.2.

Further, this Court on the\ncontention of the petitioner that the clauses of the Second Supplementary\nCollaboration Agreement are unconscionable and virtually efface the\nunderstandings, rights and obligations of the petitioner under the original\nCollaboration Agreement also does not find force for it is only reasonable\nfor any prudent mind to protect its right having waited for years for a\nlicence to see the light of the day.\n\n59. Having said that since both the parties have made contentions\nregarding forgery and fabrication of the documents against each other,\nwithout going into the controversy and contemplating on the same even\notherwise to complete ignore the Second Supplementary Collaboration\nAgreement, it would not be out of place to state that the Collaboration\nAgreement being a private corner of the transaction, from the very nature\nof the agreement could be terminated. The Collaboration Agreement\nexecuted between the parties is qua development agreement. This is a\ncommercial transaction between the private parties and hence the same by\nits very nature is determinable, even if there is termination clause in the\nCollaboration Agreement.\n\n60. Reference in this behalf may be made to the case of\nRajasthan\nBreweries Limited V. the Stroh Brewery Company\n; 2000 SCC OnLine\nDel 481, wherein this Court has held as follows:\n\n\"In view of long catena of decisions and\nconsistent view of the Supreme Court, I hold\nthat in private commercial transaction the\nparties could terminate a contract even without\nassigning any reason with a reasonable period\nof notice in terms of such a Clause in the\nagreement.

At the most, in case ultimately it is found\nthat termination was bad in law or contrary to\nthe terms of the agreement or of any\nunderstanding between the parties or for any\nother reason, the remedy of the appellants\nwould be to seek compensation for wrongful\ntermination but not a claim for specific\nperformance of the agreements and for that\nview of the matter learned Single Judge was\njustified in coming to the conclusion that the\nappellant had sought for an injunction seeking\nto specifically enforce the agreement.

However, this Court does not find force\nin the arguments advanced. In the present case both respondent No.1 and\nthe petitioner claimed to be in the possession of the said property. Be that\nas it may, Clause 3.1 of the Collaboration Agreement (as amended by the\nFirst Supplementary Collaboration Agreement) provides as under:\n\n\" Consideration & Area Allocation\nThe SECOND PARTY hereby transfer all the\ndevelopment/ all other rights of the Scheduled\nProperty along with physical possession thereof\nto the FIRST PARTY for carrying out the\ndevelopment and construction of residential\nplotted colony and/or any other project on the\nScheduled Property, as may be decided by the\nFIRST PARTY, at its own cost and expenses by\nthe FIRST PARTY, in consideration of payment\nof Non-Refundable Earnest Money and\nallocation of the plotted area to the SECOND\nPARTY as set out in this Agreement. The FIRST\nPARTY shall develop the Scheduled Property as\nit may deem fit and proper at its sole\ndiscretion.\"\n\n62. From reading of the above clause it is clear that for transfer of all\ndevelopment/all other rights of the scheduled property along with\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 32 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nphysical possession to the petitioner, two conditions had to be met.\nFirstly, the payment of the non-refundable earnest money by the\npetitioner and secondly, the allocation of plotted area to respondent No.1.\nClause 3.4 provides that the petitioner shall allot the said property area to\nthe respondent No.1 after issuance of a licence and other approvals of the\nproject which are necessary prior to the allotment of any plot in the\nproject. Thus, while the first condition was fulfilled by the petitioner, the\nsecond condition was not fulfilled for lack of licence, thus, the question\nof any transfer of rights or physical possession does not arise.\n\n63. The Collaboration Agreement being determinable in nature in\nview of the above said discussion is not applicable in specific\nperformance in view of the statutory bar contained in\nSection 14 (d)\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963. Further, there is such no negative covenant\nin the Collaboration Agreement to make out a case for an injunction.\n\n64. Thus, in terms of\nSection 14(d)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963,\nno injunction can be granted to prevent breach of the contract, the\nperformance of which can not enforced. As noted above, the respondent\nNo.1 has already terminated the Collaboration Agreement vide its notice\ndated 29th September, 2021, which is not questioned by the petitioner,\nhence, the remaining relief which may be sought by the petitioner is to\nseek damages, if any. Thus, where the petitioner is statutorily barred from\nseeking specific performance of the Collaboration Agreement, the\npetitioner cannot be held entitled to claim interim relief under\nSection 9\n\nof the Act.\nIn this regard, reference is made to the case of\nBharat\nCatering Corporation V.

If the petitioner is aggrieved by the letter of termination of the\ncontract and is advised to challenge the validity thereof the petitioner can\nalways invoke the arbitration clause to claim damages, if any, suffered by\nthe petitioner. It is not open to this Court to restore the contract under\n\nSection 9\nwhich is meant only for the sole purpose of preserving and\nmaintaining the property in dispute and cannot be used to enforce the\nspecific performance of a contract.\n\n66. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of\nAdhunik\nSteels Ltd. v.

There was considerable debate before us on\nthe scope of\nSection 9\nof the Act. According to\nlearned counsel for Adhunik Steels,\nSection 9\nof\nthe Act stood independent of Section 94 and\n\nOrder 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure\nand\nthe exercise of power thereunder was also not\ntrammelled by anything contained in the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\n. Learned counsel contended\nthat by way of an interim measure, the court\ncould pass an order for the preservation or\ncustody of the subject-matter of the arbitration\nagreement irrespective of whether the order\nthat may be passed was in a mandatory form or\nwas in a prohibitory form.

Learned counsel emphasised that\nwhat was liable to be protected in an\nappropriate case was the subject-matter of the\narbitration agreement. Learned counsel\nreferred to The Law and Practice of\nCommercial Arbitration in England by Mustill\nand Boyd and relied on the following passage\ntherefrom:\n\n\"(b) Safeguarding the subject-matter of the\ndispute\nThe existence of a dispute may put at risk the\nproperty which forms the subject of the\nreference, or the rights of a party in respect of\nthat property. Thus, the dispute may prevent\nperishable goods from being put to their\nintended use, or may impede the proper\nexploitation of a profit-earning article, such as\na ship. If the disposition of the property has to\nwait until after the award has resolved the\ndispute, unnecessary hardship may be caused to\nthe parties. Again, there may be a risk that if the\nproperty is left in the custody or control of one\nof the parties, pending the hearing, he may\nabuse his position in such a way that even if the\nother party ultimately succeeds in the\narbitration, he will not obtain the full benefit of\nthe award. In cases such as this, the court (and\nin some instances the arbitrator) has power to\nintervene, for the purpose of maintaining the\nstatus quo until the award is made. The\nremedies available under the Act are as\nfollows:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 35 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\n(i) The grant of an interlocutory injunction.\n\n(ii) The appointment of a receiver.\n\n(iii) The making of an order for the\npreservation, custody or sale of the property.\n\n(iv) The securing of the amount in dispute.\"\n\n11. It is true that\nSection 9\nof the Act speaks of\nthe court by way of an interim measure passing\nan order for protection, for the preservation,\ninterim custody or sale of any goods, which are\nthe subject-matter of the arbitration agreement\nand such interim measure of protection as may\nappear to the court to be just and convenient.\nThe grant of an interim prohibitory injunction\nor an interim mandatory injunction are\ngoverned by well-known rules and it is difficult\nto imagine that the legislature while enacting\n\nSection 9\nof the Act intended to make a\nprovision which was dehors the accepted\nprinciples that governed the grant of an interim\ninjunction. Same is the position regarding the\nappointment of a receiver since the section itself\nbrings in the concept of \"just and convenient\"\n\nwhile speaking of passing any interim measure\nof protection. The concluding words of the\nsection, \"and the court shall have the same\npower for making orders as it has for the\npurpose and in relation to any proceedings\nbefore it\" also suggest that the normal rules\nthat govern the court in the grant of interim\norders is not sought to be jettisoned by the\nprovision. Moreover, when a party is given a\nright to approach an ordinary court of the\ncountry without providing a special procedure\nor a special set of rules in that behalf, the\nordinary rules followed by that court would\ngovern the exercise of power conferred by the\nAct.

Injunction is a form of specific relief. It is an\norder of a court requiring a party either to do a\nspecific act or acts or to refrain from doing a\nspecific act or acts either for a limited period or\nwithout limit of time. In relation to a breach of\ncontract, the proper remedy against a defendant\nwho acts in breach of his obligations under a\ncontract, is either damages or specific relief.\nThe two principal varieties of specific relief are,\ndecree of specific performance and the\ninjunction (See David Bean on Injunctions).\nThe\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\nwas intended to be \"an\nAct to define and amend the law relating to\ncertain kinds of specific reliefs\". Specific relief\nis relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims at\nthe exact fulfilment of an obligation. According\nto Dr. Banerjee in his Tagore Law Lectures on\nSpecific Relief, the remedy for the non-\nperformance of a duty are (1) compensatory, (2)\nspecific. In the former, the court awards\ndamages for breach of the obligation. In the\nlatter, it directs the party in default to do or\nforbear from doing the very thing, which he is\nbound to do or forbear from doing. The law of\nspecific relief is said to be, in its essence, a part\nof the law of procedure, for, specific relief is a\nform of judicial redress. Thus, the Specific\nRelief Act, 1963 purports to define and amend\nthe law relating to certain kinds of specific\nreliefs obtainable in civil courts. It does not\ndeal with the remedies connected with\ncompensatory reliefs except as incidental and to\na limited extent.

Thus, the power\nto grant injunctions by way of specific relief is\ncovered by the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963\n.\n\n17.\nIn\nNepa Ltd. v. Manoj Kumar Agrawal\n[AIR\n1999 MP 57] a learned Judge of the Madhya\nPradesh High Court has suggested that when\nmoved under\nSection 9\nof the Act for interim\nprotection, the provisions of the\nSpecific Relief\nAct\ncannot be made applicable since in taking\ninterim measures under\nSection 9\nof the Act, the\ncourt does not decide on the merits of the case\nor the rights of parties and considers only the\nquestion of existence of an arbitration clause\nand the necessity of taking interim measures for\nissuing necessary directions or orders. When\nthe grant of relief by way of injunction is, in\ngeneral, governed by the\nSpecific Relief Act\n,\nand\nSection 9\nof the Act provides for an\napproach to the court for an interim injunction,\nwe wonder how the relevant provisions of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 38 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nSpecific Relief Act\ncan be kept out of\nconsideration. For, the grant of that interim\ninjunction has necessarily to be based on the\nprinciples governing its grant emanating out of\nthe relevant provisions of the\nSpecific Relief Act\n\nand the law bearing on the subject. Under\n\nSection 28\nof the Act of 1996, even the Arbitral\nTribunal is enjoined to decide the dispute\nsubmitted to it, in accordance with the\nsubstantive law for the time being in force in\nIndia, if it is not an international commercial\narbitration. So, it cannot certainly be inferred\nthat\nSection 9\nkeeps out the substantive law\nrelating to interim reliefs.\n\n18. The approach that at the initial stage, only\nthe existence of an arbitration clause need be\nconsidered is not justified. In Siskina (Cargo\nOwners) v. Distos Compania Navieria SA (The\nSiskina) [1979 AC 210 : (1977) 3 WLR 818 :\n\n(1977) 3 All ER 803 (HL)] Lord Diplock\nexplained the position : (All ER p. 824f-g)\n\"A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is\nnot a cause of action. It cannot stand on its\nown. It is dependant on there being a pre-\n\nexisting cause of action against the defendant\narising out of an invasion, actual or threatened,\nby him of a legal or equitable right of the\nplaintiff for the enforcement of which the\ndefendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the\ncourt. The right to obtain an interlocutory\ninjunction is merely ancillary and incidental to\nthe pre-existing cause of action. It is granted to\npreserve the status quo pending the\nascertainment by the court of the rights of the\nparties and the grant to the plaintiff of the relief\nto which his cause of action entitles him, which\nmay or may not include a final injunction.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 39 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nHe concluded : (All ER p. 825a-b)\n\n\"To come within the sub-paragraph the\ninjunction sought in the action must be part of\nthe substantive relief to which the plaintiff's\ncause of action entitles him; and the thing that\nit is sought to restrain the foreign defendant\nfrom doing in England must amount to an\ninvasion of some legal or equitable right\nbelonging to the plaintiff in this country and\nenforceable here by the final judgment for an\ninjunction.\"\n\n21. It is true that the intention behind\nSection 9\n\nof the Act is the issuance of an order for\npreservation of the subject-matter of an\narbitration agreement. According to learned\ncounsel for Adhunik Steels, the subject-matter\nof the arbitration agreement in the case on\nhand, is the mining and lifting of ore by it from\nthe mines leased to OMM Private Limited for a\nperiod of 10 years and its attempted abrupt\ntermination by OMM Private Limited and the\ndispute before the arbitrator would be the effect\nof the agreement and the right of OMM Private\nLimited to terminate it prematurely in the\ncircumstances of the case. So viewed, it was\nopen to the court to pass an order by way of an\ninterim measure of protection that the existing\narrangement under the contract should be\ncontinued pending the resolution of the dispute\nby the arbitrator. May be, there is some force in\nthis submission made on behalf of Adhunik\nSteels. But, at the same time, whether an interim\nmeasure permitting Adhunik Steels to carry on\nthe mining operations, an extraordinary\nmeasure in itself in the face of the attempted\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 40 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ntermination of the contract by OMM Private\nLimited or the termination of the contract by\nOMM Private Limited, could be granted or not,\nwould again lead the court to a consideration of\nthe classical rules for the grant of such an\ninterim measure. Whether an interim mandatory\ninjunction could be granted directing the\ncontinuance of the working of the contract, had\nto be considered in the light of the well-settled\nprinciples in that behalf. Similarly, whether the\nattempted termination could be restrained\nleaving the consequences thereof vague would\nalso be a question that might have to be\nconsidered in the context of well-settled\nprinciples for the grant of an injunction.\n\nTherefore, on the whole, we feel that it would\nnot be correct to say that the power under\n\nSection 9\nof the Act is totally independent of the\nwell-known principles governing the grant of an\ninterim injunction that generally govern the\ncourts in this connection. So viewed, we have\nnecessarily to see whether the High Court was\njustified in refusing the interim injunction on\nthe facts and in the circumstances of the case.\n\n24. But, in that context, we cannot brush aside\nthe contention of the learned counsel for\nAdhunik Steels that if OMM Private Limited is\npermitted to enter into other agreements with\nothers for the same purpose, it would be unjust\nwhen the stand of OMM Private Limited is that\nit was cancelling the agreement mainly because\nit was hit by Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession\nRules, 1960. Going by the stand adopted by\nOMM Private Limited, it is clear that OMM\nPrivate Limited cannot enter into a similar\ntransaction with any other entity since that\nwould also entail the apprehended violation of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 41 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nRule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960,\nas put forward by it. It therefore appears to be\njust and proper to direct OMM Private Limited\nnot to enter into a contract for mining and\nlifting of minerals with any other entity until the\nconclusion of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n25. At the same time, we see no justification in\npreventing OMM Private Limited from carrying\non the mining operations by itself. It has got a\nmining lease and subject to any award that may\nbe passed by the arbitrator on the effect of the\ncontract it had entered into with Adhunik Steels,\nit has the right to mine and lift the minerals\ntherefrom. The carrying on of that activity by\nOMM Private Limited cannot prejudice\nAdhunik Steels, since ultimately Adhunik Steels,\nif it succeeds, would be entitled to get, if not the\nmain relief, compensation for the termination of\nthe contract on the principles well settled in that\nbehalf. Therefore, it is not possible to accede to\nthe contention of learned counsel for Adhunik\nSteels that in any event OMM Private Limited\nmust be restrained from carrying on any mining\noperation in the mines concerned pending the\narbitral proceedings.\n\n26. We think that we should refrain from\ndiscussing the various issues at great length\nsince we feel that any discussion by us in that\nbehalf could prejudice either of the parties\nbefore the arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal.\nWe have therefore confined ourselves to making\nsuch general observations as are necessary in\nthe context of the elaborate arguments raised\nbefore us by learned counsel.\n\n27.

In the background, facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is\nalso deemed relevant to look into the matters wherein the closely related\nissues were considered. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court while adjudicating a\nsimilar issue in\nYusuf Khan v. Prajita Developers (P) Ltd.\n, (2018) 12\nSCC 683 observed as under:-\n\n\"4.

It appears from the record that\nthere is some single venture partnership\nagreement between the two companies\n(Developers). From the huge mass of\ndocuments filed in these appeals, it appears that\nthere are two documents witnessing such\npartnership agreement. They are dated 16-6-\n2006 and 10-12-2008.

The provisions\ncontained in Clauses 1-A, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13-A,\n8c(B), 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24(a) to (c) 25, 26,\n27, 28, 29, 31, 32-A and 32-B, 34, 35, 35(B),\n8(c), 37 hereof the basic and essential terms of\nthis agreement and in case of any breach of the\nsame it shall be referred to arbitration as\nprovided in Clause 40 before termination of this\nagreement on account of such breach.

It is further provided that any\ndispute arising out of the termination of the\nagreement invoking Clause 32-A, shall not be\nthe subject-matter of any arbitration.\n\n10. A number of complicated arrangements\nwere entered into in different combinations at\ndifferent points of time between the appellant,\nthe Developers and some third parties to the\nagreement, who are otherwise said to be related\nto the appellant, the details of which we do not\npropose to mention in this order.\n\n11. The first respondent filed an application\n(No. 829 of 2015) under\nSection 9\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(hereafter referred to as \"the\nArbitration Act\n\")\nfor an injunction restraining the appellant from\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 47 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ndispossessing Respondent 1 and also an\ninjunction restraining the appellant from\ncreating any third party right, title or interest in\nthe said property.\nInitially some ad interim\norders were passed in the said application, but\nthe application itself was eventually dismissed\non 14-1-2016 [\nPrajita Developers (P)\nLtd. v. Yusuf Khan\n, 2016 SCC OnLine Bom\n604] .\n\n15. On 8-10-2015, the appellant terminated the\nagreement and informed the same to Prajita by\nissuing a notice through his lawyer. Relevant\npart of the notice is as follows:\n\n\"In view of the above, we hereby\nterminate the development agreement\ndated 23-6-2006. And we call upon you\nto remove yourself from the said\nproperty, with immediate effect,\notherwise, our client will be taking\nappropriate action against you.\n\nOur client reserves his right to claim\ndamages for not carrying out the activity\nof the construction on the said property\nand/or completing the work of\nconstruction within the stipulated time\nand causing severe hardship to our\nclient.\"\n\n18.1. The appellant granted to the Developers\nunder the agreement of 23-6-2006 the \"right to\ndevelop\" the property in question.\n\n22. We do not also see any justification for the\ndemand of Prajita for the specific performance\nof the agreement dated 23-6-2006. In the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 48 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\ncircumstances of the case, we are of the opinion\nthat permitting the continuance of the suit for\nspecific performance of the agreement which is\nmore than a decade old against a person from\nwhom Prajita secured the development rights of\nthe property in dispute which ultimately would\nenable Prajita to 25% of the monetary value of\nthe development potential as against the right of\nthe appellant who is entitled for 75% of the\nmonetary value of the development potential\nwould be unjust.\n\n23. The background of the facts and\ncircumstances of the case whether Prajita\nwould be entitled for any damages apart from\nreceiving the abovementioned amount of Rs 20\ncrores from the appellant is a matter which\nrequires some examination. We therefore, deem\nit appropriate to refer the said question for\nresolution by arbitration between the appellant\nand Prajita. We, therefore, direct that the\nparties shall submit the abovementioned dispute\nfor arbitration by Hon'ble Shri Justice P.\nVenkatarama Reddy, former Judge of this Court\nin accordance with law. The Registry is directed\nto communicate this order to Hon'ble Shri\nJustice P. Venkatarama Reddy.\"\n\n70. In the case S. Rajeswari v. C. Parimala, 2020 SCC OnLine Mad\n13061, the Madras High Court, while adjudicating a similar issue, held as\nunder:-\n\n\"35. The plaintiff has not proved that she was\nready and willing to perform her\npart of contract. The defendant, by notice dated\n24.06.2006 terminated the contract and also\nsent back the amounts already paid by the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 49 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nplaintiff. Even though the plaintiff sent a reply,\ndated 29.09.2006, she has not proved that on\nthe date of sending reply she was having\nsufficient means to pay the balance sale\nconsideration and the defendant has also stated\nthat since the plaintiff has failed to clear the\ndues, the defendant made alternative\narrangements with private financiers and\ncleared the dues to the bank and therefore, the\ndefendant cancelled the agreement and sent the\nlegal notice to the plaintiff along with the pay\norder. From the oral and document evidence,\nthis Court finds that the plaintiff has failed and\nneglected to pay the balance sale consideration\nwithin the time stipulated in the agreement\ndated 28.10.2005 and therefore, issue numbers\n1 to 5 are answered against the plaintiff.\n\n39. As already held that the plaintiff has not\nproved the readiness and willingness to perform\nher part of the contract, she is not entitled for\nthe relief of specific performance and the\ndefendant sent a notice dated 24.06.2006\nand terminated the agreement dated 28.10.2005\nby sending the advance amount received by the\ndefendant from the plaintiff. Though it is settled\npreposition that unilateral cancellation is not\npermissible, but after the expiry of the terms\nand conditions mentioned in the agreement, and\nfurther since the plaintiff did not make the\npayment to clear the bank dues, the defendant\nmade private arrangements to clear the dues\nand therefore the purpose has been completed\nwithout the help of the plaintiff and hence, the\ndefendant has cancelled the agreement. As per\nthe agreement, the balance sale consideration\nwould be paid at the time of execution of the\nsale deed. But the plaintiff very well know that\nthe defendant received the possession notice\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 50 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nfrom the bank and unless the defendant paid the\nbank dues and redeemed the property he cannot\nexecute the sale deed. Therefore, the plaintiff\nhas not proved that she made the payment to\nclear the bank dues, except she made\npayment of Rs. 13,30000 on several dataes. But\nthe plaintiff has not proved that she along with\nthe defendant approached the bank to settle the\ndues. Therefore, under the circumstances, the\nplaintiff is not entitled to get the declaration\nthat the agreement dated 28.10.2005 has been\nduly rescinded and terminated by the defendant\non 24.06.2006 and this issue is answered\naccordingly.\"\n\n71. Therefore, it is evident that where the Agreement already stood\nterminated, without a challenge to the same, there remains no scope for\nintervention of this Court, specifically under\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration\nAct or\nSection 10\nof the Specific Relief Act.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n72. Keeping in view the facts, circumstances, contentions raised in the\npleadings, arguments advanced on behalf of the parties, as well as the\ndiscussion in the foregoing paragraphs, this Court is of the considered\nview that the petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought for.\n\n73. The Collaboration Agreement between the parties already stands\nterminated, therefore, there is an impossibility for this Court to direct its\nspecific performance in a proceedings under\nSection 9\nof the Act.\nFurther, as decided by this Court as well as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nOMP(I) (COMM) 401/2022 Page 51 of 52\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:DAMINI YADAV\n\nSigning Date:14.03.2023\n\n12:31:35\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001809\n\nspecific performance of a contract may not be granted in proceedings\nunder\nSection 9\nof the Act. Moreover, the petitioner has failed to show its\nreadiness and willingness to perform the Agreement.\n\n74. The contentions of the parties as regards the arbitrary breach of the\nterms of the Collaboration Agreement on account of fraud are issues that\nmay be decided by the relevant Forum and shall not be adjudicated by\nway of the instant proceedings.\n\n75. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on\nthe merits of the case and all kinds of contentions of the parties are left\nopen for consideration by the competent Court or Forum.\n\n76. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.\n\n77. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\n\n78.
