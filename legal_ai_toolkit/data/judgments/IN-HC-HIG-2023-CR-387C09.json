The aforesaid incident had caused mental harassment to\n\nthe deceased to such an extent that on 21.05.2021 at around\n\n10:00 p.m., the deceased had committed suicide at her parent's\n\nhouse by hanging herself. The deceased was taken to the hospital,\n\nwhere she was declared dead by the Doctor. With such\n\nallegations, the FIR in question came to be registered on\n\n23.05.2021 with the Sole High Court Police Station for the offences\n\nunder Sections 498(A), 306, 294(B) read with\nSection 114\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code and\nSection 4\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act\n\nagainst the present respondent No.2 and five others.\n\n3.5 The respondent No.2 had preferred application\nu/s. 439\nof\n\nthe Cr.P.C seeking regular bail in connection with the aforesaid\n\nFIR before the Court of learned 8 th Additional District and Sessions\n\nCourt, Ahmedabad (Rural) at Mirzapur, Ahmedabad. The aforesaid\n\nbail application of respondent No.2 was opposed by the present\n\napplicant. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, after hearing\n\nPage 5 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nlearned counsel of respective parties and having gone through the\n\npapers related to investigation, was pleased to enlarge the\n\nrespondent No.2 on regular bail vide order dated 08.06.2021\n\npassed in Criminal Misc. Application No. 1700 of 2021. The\n\noriginal informant - father of the deceased being aggrieved by the\n\nsame has approached this Court by filing present application\n\nseeking cancellation of bail of respondent No.2.\n\n4. Mr. Hemant B. Raval, learned advocate for the applicant has\n\ninvited attention of this Court to the reasons assigned by the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge while granting regular bail and\n\nhas submitted that the learned Sessions Judge has totally\n\noverlooked the facts that the incident relates to\nSection 304-B\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code by not appreciating the fact that the marriage\n\nlife span of the deceased was hardly two years and the demand of\n\ndowry alleged in the complaint. Such allegation of demand of\n\ndowry was accompanied by the allegations of cruelty and\n\nharassment being made to the deceased. He further submitted\n\nthat if a woman dies, as a result of such circumstances narrated in\n\nthe complaint, the Sessions Judge ought to have treated it as a\n\ncase of dowry death. He therefore, submitted that respondent No.2\n\nwho is the husband of deceased was required to be made\n\nPage 6 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\naccountable for such offence and the trial Court ought not to have\n\nexercised the discretion of granting him bail. He relied upon\n\ndecision of this Court in the case of\nVallabhbhai Naranbhai\n\nParmer Vs. State of Gujarat and Ors.\nreported in 2002 (2) GLR\n\n1731 and has submitted that in similar set of facts, the learned\n\nSingle Judge of this Court has taken into consideration the\n\nprinciples\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\n\nBhagirathsing Jadeja Vs. State of Gujarat\nreported in 1983(1)\n\nGLR 133 Supreme Court as well as in the case of Dolatram and\n\nOrs. Vs. State of Haryana reported in 1995 SCC Cri. 237. The\n\nlearned Single Judge of this Court in the facts of the case noticed\n\nthat the learned Judge below had totally overlooked the fact that it\n\nwas the offence under\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code where\n\nthe duty was caste upon the trial Judge to raise presumption\n\nagainst the accused under\nSection 113 B\nof the Indian Evidence\n\nAct. The learned Judge noted that the trial Court had failed to\n\nexercise its discretion in judicial manner and therefore, had\n\nproceeded to quash and set aside the order of grant of bail\n\nwhereby directed the accused to surrender to the police forthwith.\n\n5. Mr. Raval, learned advocate had further invited attention of\n\nPage 7 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nthis Court to the order dated 08.06.2021 passed by the learned 8 th\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad Rural in\n\nCriminal Misc. Application No.1700 of 2021, whereby the same\n\nlearned Judge had proceeded to grant bail to accused Nos.2 to 5\n\npending the investigation, however, had refused the bail\n\napplication qua present respondent no.2 - original accused. Mr.\n\nRaval, further referred the reasons assigned by the learned Judge\n\nand submitted that the Court below at relevant stage, had taken\n\ninto consideration the gravity of offence, more particularly noticing\n\nthe allegations made against present respondent No.2 husband,\n\nwho had forced the deceased to give divorce and had further\n\nthreatened to get remarried on 10 th June, forcing the deceased to\n\ntake such extreme steps. He further submitted that the respondent\n\nNo.2 had approached this Court seeking regular bail pending\n\ninvestigation being Criminal Misc. Application No.10130 of 2021\n\nwhich was withdrawn vide dated 29.06.2021. He therefore,\n\nsubmitted that the application seeking bail which was not\n\nentertained and was disposed of as withdrawn, the trial Court\n\nought not to have subsequently passed the order of enlarging the\n\nrespondent No.2 on regular bail.\n\n6. By making aforesaid submissions, Mr. Raval, learned\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nadvocate has urged this Court that impugned order be quashed\n\nand set aside as the same is perverse and illegal.\n\n7. The aforesaid submissions of the learned advocate of the\n\napplication have been vehemently objected by Mr. P.P. Majmudar,\n\nlearned advocate of respondent No.2. He has invited attention of\n\nthis Court to the affidavit filed by the respondent No.2. He\n\nsupported the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge by\n\nsubmitting that after taking into consideration the investigation\n\ncase papers, the learned Sessions Judge has assigned the\n\nreasons while exercising its discretion. He further submitted that\n\nthe investigation has culminated into charge-sheet against the\n\nrespondent No.2, for the offence punishable under Sections 306,\n\n498(A), 294-B read with 114 of the\nIndian Penal Code\nand\nSection\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act. He has placed on record the\n\ncharge-sheet counter and relevant statements of the witnesses\n\nand the copy of P.M. report and Panchnama of the scene of\n\noffence. By referring to the aforesaid investigation case papers, he\n\nhas submitted that considering the nature of allegations made, the\n\nsame would be subject matter of evidence, which may come on\n\nrecord during the course of trial.\nIn such circumstances, the trial\n\nCourt considering the principle of \"Bail is Rule and Jail is an\n\nPage 9 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nexception\" and following the principles of the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nas laid down in the case of\nSanjay Chandra Vs. CBI\n, reported in\n\nAIR 2012 SC 830 had proceeded to grant regular bail. He\n\ntherefore, submitted that such exercise of discretion by the Court\n\nbelow is within the purview of grant of bail, which cannot be termed\n\nas perverse or illegal. He further relied upon decision of this Court\n\norder 10.06.2022 passed in Criminal Misc.\n\nApplication\n\nNo.19704 of 2017 in the case of\nDivyaben Jashwantsinh\n\nRathod Vs. State of Gujarat\nand order dated 29.04.2022 passed\n\nin Criminal Misc. Application No.24873 of 2017 and allied matters\n\nand has submitted that cogent and overwhelming circumstances\n\nare necessary for an order directing the cancellation of bail, which\n\nis already granted. He further submitted that the application for\n\ncancellation of bail is generally examined on the anvil of existence\n\nof supervening circumstances or violation of condition of bail by a\n\nperson to whom bail has been granted. By relying upon aforesaid\n\nproposition of law, he submitted that in absence of any\n\nsupervening circumstances or allegations being made with regard\n\nto breach of condition, the present application may be rejected.\n\n8. Ms. Monali Bhatt, learned APP has appeared for the\n\nPage 10 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nrespondent No.1 State. This Court had directed the learned APP to\n\ncall for investigation case papers and to verify status of trial, more\n\nparticularly, the submission being made by the learned advocate\n\nwith regard to framing of charge of alleged offence was concerned.\n\nMs. Bhatt, learned APP had placed on record the report along with\n\ncertified copy of the order passed by the learned trial Court framing\n\ncharge, which was permitted to be taken on record by order dated\n\n24.01.2023. Responding to the query of this Court, learned APP\n\nhas submitted that no separate application has been filed by State\n\nseeking cancellation of bail granted to the respondent No.2.\n\nHowever, by inviting attention to the reasons assigned by the\n\nlearned Sessions and report of Investigating Officer, she supported\n\nthe case of the complainant and prayed for cancellation of bail\n\ngranted to respondent No.2.\n\n9. Considering the submissions made by the learned advocates\n\nappearing for the respective parties and having perused the\n\nrelevant documents placed on record, along with the documents\n\nplaced with the present application, the only question which falls\n\nfor consideration of this Court seeking cancellation of bail is as to\n\nwhether the trial Court committed error in enlarging the respondent\n\nNo.2 on regular bail by impugned order and as to whether this\n\nPage 11 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nCourt is required to invoke power\nu/s. 439(A)\nof Cr.P.C. cancelling\n\nthe regular bail of respondent No.2.\n\n10. At the outset, this Court notices that charge sheet has been\n\nfiled for the offence punishable under\nSection 306\n,\n498A\n,\n294-B\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code read with 114 of\nIndian Penal Code\nand\n\nSection 4\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act. It further transpires from\n\nthe report of Investigating Officer that filing of the aforesaid charge\n\nsheet has resulted into criminal case being Sessions Case No.191\n\nof 2021, which is tried before the Court of 9th Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, Ahmedabad (Rural) Ahmedabad. It is reported that charge\n\nhas been framed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge by\n\norder 09.11.2022 for the offences punishable u/s. 306, 498(A),\n\n294B read with\nSection 114\nof Indian Penal Code and\nSection 4\nof\n\nDowry Prohibition Act. A bare reading of the allegations made in\n\nthe complaint, which has resulted into charge-sheet being filed\n\nagainst accused Nos.1 to 5 including present respondent No.2,\n\nprima facie this Court is of the opinion that charge\nu/s. 304B\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code is made out. The Court cannot ignore the fact\n\nthat indisputably the marriage span was of two years i.e. less than\n\n7 years and very specific allegations have been made by the father\n\nof the deceased original informant with regard to demand of dowry.\n\nPage 12 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nThe Court cannot overlook by treating it as an absurd claim since\n\nsuch allegations have ultimately drawn the deceased to commit\n\nsuicide. The manner in which the incident is narrated in the FIR, it\n\ntranspires that she was physically and emotionally abused. Initially\n\nat the matrimonial home, which had further aggravated by the\n\nsubsequent incident of 23.05.2021 which forced her to the extreme\n\nstep to commit suicide in the house of her parents. The allegations\n\nwith regard to threatening and abusive behaviour, including\n\nphysical, emotional meted to the deceased falls in the category of\n\ncruelty and can also be termed as \"abatement\" of suicide at the\n\nhands of present respondent No.2. The trail Court ought to have\n\nappreciated the aforesaid factors and prima facie the offence\nu/s.\n\n304B\nof Indian Penal Code was attracted in the facts of the case.\n\n11. The offence\nu/s. 304B\nof Indian Penal Code is a cognizable\n\nand non-bailable and non-compoundable offence. The sentence of\n\nterm of imprisonment of not less than 7 years, which may extend\n\nto life imprisonment, has been proved\nu/s. 304B(2)\nof Indian Penal\n\nCode. In fact,\nSection 113 B\nof Indian Evidence Act, 1872,\n\nprovides for presumption with regard to dowry death and the Court\n\nnotices that woman was exposed to cruelty or harassment by\n\nperson soon before her death, or in connection with dowry\n\nPage 13 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\ndemand.\n\n12. Three different decisions have illustrated various instances in\n\nsuch type of cases. In the case of Kansraj Vs. State of Punjab\n\nreported in (2000) 5 SCC 207 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n\ndiscussed the relevancy of the word \"soon before death\" appears\n\nto indicate that it was not a natural death and the cruelty or\n\nharassment to deceased have persisted over a period of time.\n\nAgain in the case of\nRameshwar Dass Vs. State of Punjab\n\nreported in AIR 2008 SC 890, where the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\ndecided that a pregnant woman would not commit suicide with her\n\nhusband deteriorated to the point, where she felt oblige to do so\n\nand that the accused was liable to be convicted.\n\nIn the case of\n\nShersingh @ Partapa Vs. State of Haryana\nreported in 2015(3)\n\nSCC 124 where the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the\n\nword \"Soon\" appearing in\nSection 304B\nof Indian Penal Code,\n\nopined that the word \"soon\" finds place in Section 304B would not\n\nbe interpreted literally in terms of days or month or years, but\n\nnecessarily indicating the demand for dowry was not stale or an\n\naberration of the past, but should be continuing cause for death\n\nunder Section 304 or suicide under\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal\n\nCode. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that with aid of Section\n\nPage 14 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\n113B of the Evidence Act, even by preponderance of the\n\nevidence, the prosecution can discharge the initial burden of\n\nproving the element of\nSection 304 B\nof Indian Penal Code.\n\nThus, the preliminary presumptions are supplant by an assumption\n\nof the guilt of the accused who has to prove his innocence by\n\nestablishing the fact that there never existed a demand for dowry.\n\n13. In light of aforesaid legal position, where the specific\n\nallegations have been made by the informant against the\n\nrespondent No.2 being husband of deceased, this Court finds that\n\nthe deceased had taken extreme step of committing suicide\n\npursuant to the telephonic conversations which had taken between\n\naccused and deceased hardly few hours before the incident.\n\nPrima facie, the Court is of the opinion that the respondent No.2\n\nbeing husband had subjected the deceased to cruelty and had\n\ncoerced her in a manner resulting into her death thereby attracting\n\nthe offences punishable\nu/s. 304B\nof Indian Penal Code along with\n\noffences punishable u/s. 306, 498A, 294B read with\nSection 114\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code and\nSection 4\nof Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\n14. Now, in light of the aforesaid role of the respondent No.2, the\n\nnext question arises for consideration of this Court is as to whether\n\ntrial Court committed error in enlarging the respondent No.2 on\n\nPage 15 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nbail. The order granting regular bail to respondent No.2 passed by\n\ntrial Court is mainly challenged on the ground of perversity and\n\nillegality. For the reasons stated above, this Court is of the view\n\nthat the trial Court committed error by not closely examining the\n\nfacts of the case, more particularly with regard to\nSection 304B\nof\n\nIndian Penal Code. Indisputably, this was not a case of natural\n\ndeath. The investigation has culminated in the charge-sheet for the\n\noffence of\nSection 498A\nof Indian Penal Code and\nSection 4\nof\n\nDowry Prohibition Act. Thus, prima facie, the material has come on\n\nrecord to suggest that the deceased was subjected to cruelty in\n\nrespect to dowry. The very threat of remarrying given by the\n\nhusband in such circumstances was a crucial element to force the\n\ndeceased to commit suicide. However, the aforesaid aspect would\n\nbe subject to the evidence which may come on record during the\n\ncourse of trial.\n\n15. So far as the scope of this court while exercising jurisdiction\n\nu/s. 439(2) of\nCr.P.C\n. with regard to cancellation of bail order is\n\nconcerned any serious infirmity, which may have resulted into\n\nmiscarriage of justice, while granting bail is required to be looked\n\ninto. If the Court granting bail, ignore the relevant material and has\n\ntaken into consideration irrelevant factors, which are secondary\n\nPage 16 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nfactors to grant the bail to the accused then\nin that case\n, this Court\n\ncan certainly invoked its power us. 439(2) of\nCr.P.C\n. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has on number of occasions laid down Guidelines\n\nto be followed by the Courts while granting bail the most relevant\n\nfactors to be considered at the stage of grant of bail, which\n\nincludes gravity of crime, character of evidence, position and\n\nstatus of accused with reference to victim and witnesses, repeating\n\nof the offence, the possibility of his tampering with the evidence\n\nand witnesses and obstructing the course of justice. Thus, the\n\nCourt is expected to examine overall to take into consideration the\n\naforesaid factors vis-à-vis the allegations made in the complaint,\n\nthe material produced by the Investigating Officer during the\n\ninvestigation to ascertain the aforesaid factors. The Court below at\n\nthe first instance while examining the application seeking regular\n\nbail, having noticed that the prosecution had made out prima facie\n\nagainst the present respondent No.2 - husband, also noted the\n\nfact that the investigation was pending and respondent no.2 was in\n\ncustody since 30.05.2021 and had therefore, refused to grant\n\nregular bail at the stage of pending investigation. As against the\n\nearlier order, upon completion of the investigation and filing of the\n\ncharges-sheet the Court below thought it fit to not to discuss the\n\nPage 17 of 19\n\nDownloaded on : Fri Feb 24 20:38:11 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/16729/2021 CAV ORDER DATED: 20/02/2023\n\nmerits of the case more particularly on the issue of abetment.\n\nTaking into consideration the factors like the respondent No.2\n\nbeing a local resident, his presence to be secured by bail bond and\n\nsurety and considering the principles\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of\nSanjay Chandra\n(Supra) held that the\n\npersonal liberty of an individual was equally important in\n\ncomparison to the social interest and there should not any pre trial\n\npunishment. The Court below proceeded to exercise discretion in\n\nfavour of the respondent No.2 by enlarging him on bail without\n\ntaking consideration of the role of the accused and the charge\n\nalleged. In the opinion of this Court, as against role of the accused\n\n- respondent No.2, the aforesaid factors if given weightage\n\nbecomes insignificant.
