Briefly stated, circumstances relevant for present purposes are as\nfollows. On complaint dated 27.04.2023 of one Mr. Suresh Kumar, FIR No.\n79/2023 for offence under\nSection 304B\n/\n498A\n/\nIPC was registered by PS\nJaffarpur Kalan. After completion of investigation, chargesheet for offences\nunder\nSection 304B\n/\n498A\n/\nIPC was filed against the accused/applicant,\nhis parents and sister. Currently, the matter is pending trial and six out of\nforty prosecution witnesses stand examined.\n\n2.1 In his complaint, which was registered as FIR, Shri Suresh Kumar\nalleged that he got his daughter Raveena married on 22.02.2023 with Vinay\n(the accused/applicant), but the very next day of marriage, the\naccused/applicant told Raveena that she was not his choice and he had\nmarried her under pressure of his family; that after marriage, 2-3 times\nRaveena went to her matrimonial home where she was harassed by all the\naccused persons, demanding money and stating that the amount of Rs.\n7,00,000/- given by her parents would fetch only a small car, so she must\nbring more money from her parents; that about one and a half months\nearlier, Raveena had called him up to apprise him of the abovesaid\nallegations, so he brought her to her parental home; that after shifting to her\nparental home, she used to remain depressed; that on the day of incident\n(27.04.2023), he was in his room while Raveena was watching TV in the\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 2 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07\n14:50:52 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\nother room and when she did not respond to his call, he went to the other\nroom where he found Raveena hanging with a dupatta from ventilator; and\nthat he immediately extricated Raveena and called PCR.\n\n3. It is in the above backdrop that the accused/applicant has filed the\npresent application seeking to be released on bail.\n\n3.1 Learned counsel for accused/applicant took me through the above\nmentioned FIR statement of complainant de facto and contended that since\nthe deceased Raveena committed suicide admittedly at her parental home\nand not at her matrimonial home, offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC is not\nattracted. It was also argued on behalf of accused/applicant that even\naccording to the FIR, there was no harassment or dowry demand during the\nperiod between 15.03.2023 when the deceased was shifted to her parental\nhome and 27.04.2023 when she committed suicide, so even if the allegation\nof dowry demand till 15.03.2023 is believed, there is no material to show\nthat soon before her death Raveena was subjected to cruelty or dowry\nharassment. Lastly, learned counsel for accused/applicant also argued that\ngoing by its stage, trial would take long time to conclude, so\naccused/applicant deserves to be released on bail. In support of his\narguments, learned counsel for accused/applicant placed reliance on the\njudgments in the cases titled Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh vs State of\n\nBAIL APPLN.\n4627/2024 Page 3 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07\n14:51:17 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\nMaharashtra and Ors., 2024 SCC OnLine 1693 SC;\nNitish Chauhan vs\nState of UP\n, AIR 2023 SC 2149; and\nAmarkant Mahto vs State\n, 2020 SCC\nOnLine 726 Del.\n\n3.2 On the other hand, learned counsel for complainant de facto also took\nme through record and contended that the deceased was consistently\nharassed and mentally tortured by the accused/applicant and his family\nmembers not just till she shifted to her parental home, but even thereafter till\nshe committed suicide. Learned counsel for complainant de facto also\nreferred to institution of judicial separation proceedings by the\naccused/applicant on 19.04.2023, which followed a long telephonic\nconversation between the accused/applicant and the deceased on 23.04.2023,\ntriggering her suicide on 27.04.2023. So, according to learned counsel for\ncomplainant de facto, the accused deserves no relief.\n\n3.3 Learned Additional Public Prosecutor strongly opposed the bail\napplication in view of heinous nature of crime. Learned prosecutor took me\nthrough chargesheet to point out continuity of communication between the\naccused/applicant and the deceased, especially the Call Detail Records\nreflecting last conversation which took place for 584 seconds between the\naccused/applicant and the deceased on 23.04.2023, after which on\n27.04.2023 the deceased committed suicide. Learned prosecutor also\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 4 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by GIRISH\nKATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07 14:51:45\n\n-07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\nsubmitted that one crucial witness related to the efforts of the complainant\nde facto to resolve the issue amicably prior to death of the deceased is yet to\nbe examined. Therefore, according to prosecution this is not a fit case to\ngrant bail.\nIn support of his arguments, learned prosecutor placed reliance\non the judgment dated 03.03.2025 of the Supreme Court in the case titled\n\nShabeen Ahmad vs The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.\n, 2025 INSC 307.\n\n4. To begin with, having perused the judicial precedents cited on behalf\nof the accused/applicant, I am of the opinion that none of the same would\nsupport his case. In the case of Javed Gulam (supra), the Supreme Court\nrecapitulated the principles of speedy trial and bail, holding that if the State,\nincluding the Court, cannot provide fundamental right of speedy trial, the\nprosecution should not oppose the bail plea on the ground of seriousness of\nthe crime, as the object of bail is to secure attendance of the accused at the\ntrial and bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. In the said case, the\nSupreme Court was faced with a situation where the accused was in jail for\nfour years but the trial court had not been able to even frame charges and the\nprosecution intended to examine not less than eighty witnesses. That is not\nso in the present case, as mentioned above.\nThe judgment in the case of\n\nNitish Chauhan\n(supra) is basically a short order without any discussion on\nthe legal issues.\n\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Mahto\n(supra), only official\nwitnesses remained to be examined as all public witnesses had already\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 5 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by GIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA\nDate: 2025.04.07 14:52:07 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\ntestified and a crucial aspect was the statements of the parents of the\ndeceased showing it to be not a case of dowry death.\n\n5. The Supreme Court judgment in the case of\nShabeen Ahmad\n(supra)\nreferred to by the learned prosecutor is the latest analysis carried out by the\napex court on the issue hardly one month ago. In the said case, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court dealt with the challenge to grant of bail to the parents-in-law\nand sisters-in-law of the deceased in case for offence under\nSection\n498A\n/\n304B\nIPC. After elaborate discussion on law and facts, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court cancelled the bail granted to the parents-in-law of the\ndeceased, observing thus:\n\n\"11. At the outset, it is crucial to underscore the seriousness of an\nalleged dowry death under\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof the IPC, read\nwith\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act..... Stricter judicial\nscrutiny is necessary in matters where a young woman loses her life\nin her matrimonial home so soon after marriage, particularly where\nthe record points to persistent harassment over unmet dowry\ndemands.\n\n12. ..... In dowry-death cases, courts must be mindful of the broader\nsocietal impact, given that the offence strikes at the very root of social\njustice and equality. Allowing alleged prime perpetrators of such\nheinous acts to remain on bail, where the evidence indicates they\nactively inflicted physical, as well as mental, torment, could undermine\nnot only the fairness of the trial but also public confidence in the\ncriminal justice system.\n\n13. ... Moreover,\nSection 304B\nIPC (dowry death) prescribes a\nstringent standard because of the grave nature of the offence and the\nsystemic harm it perpetuates. Where the facts clearly indicate direct\ninvolvement in the fatal events, courts must act with an abundance of\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 6 of 13 pages\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07 14:52:30\n\n-07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\ncaution. Thus, permitting the father-in-law and mother-in-law to\nremain at large would run counter to the ends of justice, especially\nwhen the evidence reflects a probable nexus between their persistent\ndowry demands, physical cruelty, and the deceased's death.\nConsequently, their bail warrants cancellation so that a fair and\nunimpeded trial may take place, in keeping with the legislative intent\nbehind anti- dowry laws.\n\n....\n\n15. We also find it necessary to express our concern over the\nseemingly mechanical approach adopted by the High Court in\ngranting bail to the Respondent accused. While the Court did note the\nabsence of prior criminal records, it failed to fully consider the stark\nrealities of the allegations. It is unfortunate that in today's society,\ndowry deaths remain a grave social concern, and in our opinion, the\ncourts are duty- bound to undertake deeper scrutiny of the\ncircumstances under which bail is granted in these cases. The social\nmessage emanating from judicial orders in such cases cannot be\noverstated: when a young bride dies under suspicious circumstances\nwithin barely two years of marriage, the judiciary must reflect\nheightened vigilance and seriousness. A superficial application of bail\nparameters not only undermines the gravity of the offence itself but\nalso risks weakening public faith in the judiciary's resolve to combat\nthe menace of dowry deaths. It is this very perception of justice, both\nwithin and outside the courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we\nrisk normalizing a crime that continues to claim numerous innocent\nlives. These observations regarding grant of bail in grievous crimes\nwere thoroughly dealt with by this Court in\nAjwar v. Waseem\n[(2024)\n10 SCC 768] ....\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n6. To recapitulate, in the present case, according to the\naccused/applicant, offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC is not made out because\nthe deceased died at her parental and not matrimonial home; and that there\nbeing no allegation of dowry harassment during the period between\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 7 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07\n14:52:54 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\n15.03.2023 when the deceased shifted to her parental home and 27.04.2023\nwhen she committed suicide, the period is too large a period to be taken as a\nperiod contemplated by the phrase \"soon before her death\" used in the said\nprovision.\n\n7. I am unable to convince myself that merely because the deceased\ncommitted suicide in her parental home and not in her matrimonial home, it\nis not a case of dowry death. Place where a tormented lady gets compelled\nto kill herself has no bearing. For purposive interpretation of the provision\nunder\nSection 304B\nIPC, it is the existence and continuance of matrimony\nwhich has to be kept in mind and not the place(s) to which the deceased\nshifts herself before taking her life.\n\n8. Section 304B was inserted in the\nIndian Penal Code\nby way of an\namendment in the year 1986 with the object of dealing with the cases of\ndowry death, which apart from killing of a hapless lady surrounded by\nadverse alien ecosystem, entail grave social ramifications. As contemplated\nby\nSection 304B\nIPC, the dowry death is death of a woman caused by burns\nor bodily injury or under abnormal circumstances within seven years of her\nmarriage, where she had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any of his relative, which harassment or cruelty was for or in\nconnection with demand of dowry and had occurred soon before her death.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 8 of 13 pages\nGIRISH Digitally signed by GIRISH\nKATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07 14:53:18\n-07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\n8.1 The expression \"soon before her death\", as used in\nSection 304B\nIPC\n\nhas to be construed keeping in mind the scope and purpose behind the\nenactment. Doing so, this expression has to be read as an expression of\ncontinuity of time and not an expression of mere length of time. Plethora of\njudicial pronouncements flowing from the apex court and different High\nCourts across the country reiterate that the expression \"soon before\" is a\nrelative term, which has to be considered under specific factual matrix of the\ncase in hand and no straitjacket formula can be laid down fixing any time\nlimit. One has to keep in mind that the legislature in its wisdom used the\nphrase in question as \"soon before\" and not \"immediately before\". What is\ncontemplated by\nSection 304B\nIPC is \"soon before death\" and not\n\"immediately before death\".\n\n8.2 In the case of\nSatbir Singh & Anr. vs State of Haryana\n, (2021) 6\nSCC 1, the Supreme Court held thus:\n\n\"10. Section 304­B,\nIPC\nis one among many legislative initiatives\nundertaken by Parliament to remedy a long­standing social evil. The\npestiferous nature of dowry harassment, wherein married women are\nbeing subjected to cruelty because of covetous demands by husband\nand his relatives has not gone unnoticed. The Parliament enacted the\n\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\nas a first step to eradicate this social\nevil. Further, as the measures were found to be insufficient, the\nCriminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983) was\npassed wherein Chapter XX­A was introduced in the\nIPC\n, containing\nSection 498­A.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 9 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07 14:53:42\n\n-07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\n11. However, despite the above measures, the issue of dowry\nharassment was still prevalent. Additionally, there was a growing\ntrend of deaths of young brides in suspicious circumstances\nfollowing demands of dowry. The need for a stringent law to curb\ndowry deaths was suo motu taken up by the Law Commission in its\n91st Law Commission Report. The Law Commission recognized that\nthe\nIPC\n, as it existed at that relevant time, was insufficient to tackle\nthe issue of dowry deaths due to the nature and modus of the crime.\nThey observed as under:\n\n\"1.3 If, in a particular incident of dowry death, the facts are\nsuch as to satisfy the legal ingredients of an offence already\nknown to the law, and if those facts can be proved without\nmuch difficulty, the existing criminal law can be resorted to\nfor bringing the offender to book. IN practice, however, two\nmain impediments arise ­\n\n(i) either the facts do not fully fit into the\npigeon­hole of any known offence; or\n\n(ii) the peculiarities of the situation are such that\nproof of directly incriminating facts is thereby\nrendered difficult.\"\n\n12. Taking into consideration the aforesaid Law Commission Report,\nand the continuing issues relating to dowry related offences, the\nParliament introduced amendments to the\nDowry Prohibition Act\n, as\nwell as the\nIPC\nby enacting\nDowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act,\n(Act 43 of 1986). By way of this amendment, Section 304­B,\n\nIPC\nwas specifically introduced in the\nIPC\n, as a stringent provision\nto curb the menace of dowry death in India.\n\n.....\n\n15. Considering the significance of such a legislation, a strict\ninterpretation would defeat the very object for which it was enacted.\nTherefore, it is safe to deduce that when the legislature used the\nwords, \"soon before\" they did not mean \"immediately before\".\nRather, they left its determination in the hands of the courts. The\nfactum of cruelty or harassment differs from case to case. Even the\nspectrum of cruelty is quite varied, as it can range from physical,\nverbal or even emotional. This list is certainly not exhaustive. No\nstraitjacket formulae can therefore be\nlaid down by\nthis Court to\ndefine what exacts the phrase \"soon before\" entails\".\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 10 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by GIRISH\nKATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07 14:54:06\n-07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\n8.3 In the case of\nKans Raj vs State of Punjab\n, (2000) 5 SCC 207, the\n\nSupreme Court analysed the provision under\nSection 304B\nIPC and after\ntraversing through various judicial precedents, held thus:\n\n\"15. It is further contended on behalf of the respondents that the\nstatements of the deceased referred to the instances could not be\ntermed to be cruelty or harassment by the husband soon before her\ndeath. \"Soon before\" is a relative term which is required to be\nconsidered under specific circumstances of each case and no\nstraight jacket formula can be\nlaid down by\nfixing any time limit.\nThis expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity test. The term\n\"soon before\" is not synonymous with the term \"immediately before\"\n\nand is opposite of the expression \"soon after\" as used and\nunderstood in Section 114, Illustration (a) of the\nEvidence Act\n. These\nwords would imply that the interval should not be too long between\nthe time of making the statement and the death. It contemplates the\nreasonable time which, as earlier noticed, has to be understood and\ndetermined under the peculiar circumstances of each case. In\nrelation to dowry deaths, the circumstances showing the existence\nof cruelty or harassment to the deceased are not restricted to a\nparticular instance but normally refer to a course of conduct. Such\nconduct may be spread over a period of time. If the cruelty or\nharassment or demand for dowry is shown to have persisted, it\nshall be deemed to be 'soon before death' if any other intervening\ncircumstance showing the non existence of such treatment is not\nbrought on record, before the alleged such treatment and the date\nof death. It does not, however, mean that such time can be\nstretched to any period. Proximate and live link between the effect\nof cruelty based on dowry demand and the consequential death is\nrequired to be proved by the prosecution. The demand of dowry,\ncruelty or harassment based upon such demand and the date of\ndeath should not be too remote in time which, under the\ncircumstances, be treated as having become stale enough.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 11 of 13 pages\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nGIRISH KATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07\n\n14:54:31 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\n16. No presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act\nwould be drawn against the accused if it is shown that after the\nalleged demand, cruelty or harassment the dispute stood resolved\nand there was no evidence of cruelty, and harassment thereafter.\nMere lapse of some time by itself would not provide to an accused a\ndefence, if the course of conduct relating to cruelty or harassment in\nconnection with the dowry demand is shown to have existed earlier\nin time not too late and not too stale before the date of death of the\nwoman\".\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n9. Falling back to the present case, as mentioned above, in the FIR there\nare specific allegations of dowry harassment. As also mentioned above, the\naccused/applicant got married with the deceased on 22.02.2023; on the very\nnext day of marriage, the accused/applicant and his family members started\nharassing the deceased over dowry, stating that the deposit of Rs. 7,00,000/-\nbrought by her from her parental home would fetch only a small car; on\n15.03.2023, the deceased shifted to her parental home, after which she\ncontinued to remain in communication with the accused/applicant over\ntelephone, the last telephone call being of 584 seconds on 23.04.2023, which\nfollowed her suicide on 27.04.2023. In view of these circumstances, though\nyet to be tested in trial, I am unable to accept the contention of learned\ncounsel for the accused/applicant that the offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC\nwould not be made out because there is no allegation of harassment soon\nbefore death of the deceased. However, I must cautiously reiterate the rider\nthat the above analysis is only for examining the bail plea of the accused/\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4627/2024 Page 12 of 13 pages\n\nGIRISH Digitally signed by\nGIRISH KATHPALIA\n\nKATHPALIA Date: 2025.04.07\n14:54:56 -07'00'\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:NEETU N NAIR\n\nSigning Date:07.04.2025\n\n18:22:56\n\napplicant, so shall have no bearing on the ultimate appreciation of evidence\nby the learned trial court.\n\n10.
