Criminal Misc. 2nd Bail Application No. 2422/2025\n\nMagan Singh S/o Late Shri Dhan Singh, Aged About 46 Years,\nR/o Khatipura, Police Station Rudawal, District Bharatpur.\n(Currently In Sub Jail Bayana).\n ----Petitioner\n Versus\nState of Rajasthan, through PP\n ----Respondent\n\nFor Petitioner(s) : Mr. Biri Singh, Sr. Adv. with\n Mr. Harendra Singh\nFor Respondent(s) : Mr. Naresh Kumar Gupta, PP\n Mr. Rajneesh Gupta for complainant\n\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE GANESH RAM MEENA\n\n Order\n\n19/02/2025\n\n1. This second bail application has been filed by the accused-\n\npetitioner under Section 483 of BNSS in connection with FIR\n\nNo.281/2024 registered at Police Station Rudawal, District\n\nBharatpur for the offences punishable under \nSections 498A\n, \n302\n,\n\n201\n & \n34\n of IPC.\n\n2. The first bail application bearing No. 11539/2024 was\n\ndismissed as withdrawn by this Court vide order dated 09.12.2024\n\nwith liberty to file fresh bail application after examination of\n\nwitnesses namely; Khubiram S/o Soniya Ram, Bhagwan Dei wife\n\nof Khubiram, Puran Singh S/o Khubiram, Nikita Kmari D/o Magan,\n\nPriyanshi @ Bhola D/o Magan Singh and Dikshay D/o Magan Singh\n\non priority basis.\n\n3. Heard.\n\n (Downloaded on 01/03/2025 at 12:20:02 AM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JP:7212] (2 of 4) [CRLMB-2422/2025]\n\n4. Considered the submissions made by learned counsel for\n\nboth the parties and also perused the charge-sheet as well as the\n\nstatement of the prosecution witnesses examined so far.\n\n5. The father of the deceased namely; Khubi Ram Meena (PW-\n\n2) during his examination before the trial Court has stated that\n\nthe accused-petitioner was having extra-marital affairs with some\n\nother woman but the deceased daughter never conveyed to him\n\nany such thing. He has also stated that the accused-petitioner has\n\npurchased lands at Jaipur and Bharatpur. The father of the\n\ndeceased has further stated that he never tried to meet the\n\ndaughter of the deceased and very strangely said that he did not\n\nmeet them because he has no relation with them.\n\n6. PW-3 (Bhagwan Dei) who is the mother of the deceased also\n\nshowed ignorance about the daughter of the deceased and had\n\nonly made allegation against the accused-petitioner that he has\n\nmurdered her daughter.\n\n7. PW-4 the daughter of the deceased namely; Ms. Nikita\n\nKumari has not supported the prosecution story and declared\n\nhostile. She has further stated that before death of her mother\n\nshe had some chest pain.\n\n8. PW-5-Ms. Priyanshi, who is also the daughter of the\n\ndeceased has not supported the prosecution story and declared\n\nhostile. In her statement she has stated that before death of her\n\nmother (deceased), she was having complaint of chest pain.\n\n9. PW-6-Ms. Dikshay who is also a six year daughter of the\n\ndeceased has also stated that before death the deceased (mother)\n\nwas having complaint of chest pain. She has been relied by the\n\nprosecution though this witness has not been declared hostile.\n\n (Downloaded on 01/03/2025 at 12:20:02 AM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JP:7212] (3 of 4) [CRLMB-2422/2025]\n\n10. There is one more material witness PW-1 namely; Pooran\n\nSingh who as per the version of the counsel for the petitioner and\n\nthe complainant, is a lawyer. The said witness PW-1 in his cross-\n\nexamination has stated ignorance of allegations against the co-\n\naccused namely; Vijay, Rajveer & Amrit Lal against whom the\n\nPolice has submitted charge-sheet. Meaning-thereby, the version\n\nof said witness is only partly supporting the prosecution story and\n\nin such circumstances when that witness is a lawyer, his credibility\n\nseems to be doubtful.\n\n11. During the course of arguments it has also come that out of\n\nthe wedlock of the accused-petitioner and the deceased four girls\n\nhave born.\n\n12. From the statements of the prosecution side i.e. father,\n\nmother and brother of the deceased it is clear that they have\n\nshown ignorance and no relation with the daughters of the\n\ndeceased. Meaning-thereby, it is only the accused-petitioner who\n\ncan look after those four girls.\n\n13. The deceased has left behind her four minor girls and as per\n\nthe statements of the parents of the deceased that they do not\n\nwant to have any relation with those girls and in such\n\ncircumstances the welfare and upliftment of the girls is to be\n\ntaken up by the petitioner only.\n\n14. Taking into consideration the period of the custody of the\n\npetitioner and so also the welfare of the four minor girls of the\n\ndeceased and the petitioner is only the bread earner for those girls\n\nand so also the discussion about the version of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses as stated in the above paras, this Court without\n\n (Downloaded on 01/03/2025 at 12:20:02 AM)\n\n [2025:RJ-JP:7212] (4 of 4) [CRLMB-2422/2025]\n\n commenting on the merits and demerits of the case, deems just\n\n and proper to enlarge the accused-petitioner on bail.\n\n 15. The observations made in the foregoing paras are only for\n\n purpose of consideration of this bail application.\n\n 16. Accordingly, this second bail application is accordingly,\n\n allowed and it is directed that accused-petitioner shall be released\n\n on bail provided he furnishes a personal bond in the sum of\n\n Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac only) together with two sureties in\n\n the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each to the\n\n satisfaction of the trial Court with the stipulation that he shall\n\n appear before that Court or any other Court to which the matter is\n\n transferred, on all subsequent dates of hearing and as and when\n\n called upon to do so.\n\n (GANESH RAM MEENA),J\n DIVYA SAINI /31\n\n (Downloaded on 01/03/2025 at 12:20:02 AM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
