Advocate for the\nrespondent No.1/State.\nShri Shashank Indapurkar, learned counsel for the\nrespondent No.2.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ORDER\n\n (12/12/2017)\n Petitioners have filed this petition challenging their\nplacement in the seniority list (Annexure P/1), which has\nbeen published by the respondent No.2 M.P.Housing\nBoard for the Degree Holder Sub Engineers (Civil).\n\n2. It is petitioners' contention that this gradation list as\non 01.01.2007 has been published without considering\nthe objections of the petitioners and deciding them. It is\npetitioners' contention that they had given their joining\non the post of Sub Engineer and copy of their\nappointment letters are enclosed as Annexure P/3. During\nthe service after taking due permission from the\nrespondents, petitioners completed their degree in Civil\nEngineering and they have been shown at their\nrespective places in the seniority list, which was\nmaintained by the department up till the change i.e. uptill\nyear 2006. In that seniority list of the year 2006, their\nplacement has been shown in accordance with their date\nof appointment. It is petitioners' allegation that in the\nyear 2007 all of a sudden, seniority of the petitioners has\nbeen changed as reflected in Annexure P/1 itself and the\n\n 2\n\nseniority of the petitioner No.1, who was at S.No.14 up to\n2006, was brought down to S.No.31 and that of petitioner\nNo.2, who was previously at S.No.15, to S.No.29 and so\non. It is petitioners' contention that due to this change in\nseniority position, petitioners' chances of promotion to\nthe next higher level have been adversely affected and in\nAnnexure P/2, several persons junior to the petitioners\nhave been placed above the petitioners. In view of such\nbackdrop, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that\nthe petitioners have prayed for quashing of the gradation\nlists (Annexure P/1 and P/2) and further direction to the\nrespondents to restore back seniority of the petitioners\nover and above their juniors. It is also prayed that\nthereafter seniority be corrected by constituting the DPC\nfor considering the cases of the petitioners for promotion\nto the post of Assistant Engineer.\n\n3. Respondent No.2 has filed a return and has\nsubmitted that the petition is misconceived and is liable\nto be rejected. Seniority list was published in the year\n2007 and it was issued in compliance of the instructions\nissued by the State Government amending the Madhya\nPradesh Public Works Department (Non-Gazetted) Service\nRecruitment and Conditions Service Rules, 1972\n(hereinafter shall be referred to as the 'Rules of 1972'). It\nis submitted that the challenge to 2007 seniority list is\nhighly belated and is liable to be rejected in the light of\nthe law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of \nShiba Shankar Mohpatra and others Vs.\nState of Orissa\n as reported in (2010) 12 SCC 471. It is\nsubmitted that the petitioners have not explained the\nlong delay in filing the petition challenging the seniority\nlist of the year 2007.\n \nIt is further submitted that such\nseparate seniority list was prepared as per the directions\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nChandravathi P.K. & others Vs. C.K.Sazi and others\n\nas reported in (2004) 3 SCC 734 and accordingly the\nrules were amended vide gazette notification\n\n 3\n\ndt.07.06.2007, which provides that there shall be two\ngroups of seniority list in the Sub Engineer cadre as\nfollows :-\n\n Group (A) : Diploma Holder Sub-Engineer\n Group (B) : Degree Holder Sub-Engineer (B.E.)\n In Rule 14 of the Rules of 1972, further substitution\nis of Sub rule (3) Clause (b), which provides that in Group\n(B), such graduate Engineer who have acquired a Degree\nbefore entering into service, their seniority on the post of\nSub-Engineer shall be fixed from the date of their\nappointment in the Department. Rule 14 (3) (c) provides\nthat such Diploma holder Sub Engineer, who have\nacquired a degree during their service period as per rules,\nthey shall be asked to give option either to remain in\nGroup (A) or in Group (B). After having acquired option\ntheir seniority in Group (A) shall be fixed totally from the\ndate of their appointment and in Group (B) it shall be\nfixed totally from the date of their acquisition of a\nDegree/passing the examination. There is a proviso,\nwhich says that provided that there shall not be any\nchange in the option once it was given. In case if the\noption is not received in the prescribed time limit, then\nthe seniority shall be maintained in Group (A) as it was\nearlier.\n\n4. It is petitioners' contention that such notification\n(Annexure P/6) can not be given a retrospective effect\nand so is the ratio of the judgment in the case of\n\nSuryakant Sharma and others Vs. State of M.P. & others\n\n(W.P.No.313/2007). Petitioners submit that their seniority\nis to be counted from the date of employment as per the\nprevailing rules and can not be changed by virtue of the\nsubsequently changing the rules of the game.\n\n5. As far as petitioners' this contention is concerned,\nAnnexure P/6 has no doubt prospective application but it\nalso has a clear provision as to giving of the option. It is\nnot the case of the petitioners that they had not given\ntheir option for placement in Group (B) i.e. seniority list of\n\n 4\n\nDegree holder Sub-Engineers and therefore in the\nabsence of any such plea that the petitioners have been\nput into Group (B) despite their not giving any option,\nthey are to be governed by the provisions of Rule 14 (3)\n\n(b) and (c). Admittedly, the petitioners had acquired\ndegree after coming into service, therefore, their seniority\nhas been fixed from the date of their acquisition of a\nDegree/passing of the examination, as is apparent from\nAnnexure P/1, wherein the petitioner No.1 finds place in\nthe seniority list in Annexure P/1 issued after amendment\nin the recruitment rules, at S.No.31, though his initial\ndate of appointment is 1982 but he had acquired B.E.\nDegree on 04.09.1990. Similarly, petitioner No.2 Shri\nH.C.Shrivastava, was though appointed on 27.02.1982\nbut had acquired degree on 30.03.1990 and therefore he\nhas been placed above the petitioner No.1. The name of\nShri S.S.Bhatiya at S.No.30 clarifies the whole scenario\nthat though he was appointed on 05.10.1981 but has\nbeen placed below petitioner No.2 and therefore in terms\nof the provisions contained in Rule 14 (3) (b) and (c), their\nseniority has been fixed. It is not the case of the\npetitioners that there were vacant posts of Assistant\nEngineer prior to the date of amendment and they have\nnot been filled by considering the cases of the petitioners\nbefore effecting the amendment. Therefore, it is apparent\nthat the petitioners' case is neither that there were\nvacancies on the post of Assistant Engineer, which have\nbeen not filled before giving the effect to the amended\nprovisions of Rule 14 as was introduced vide Annexure\nP/6 nor it is their case that they had not given an option\nto be placed in the seniority list of Graduate Engineer.\nTherefore, once they have exercised option, then they\nwere required to be considered for promotion only on the\nbasis of their placement in the seniority list of graduate\nengineers, who had attained the graduation degree after\ncoming into service. Thus, in the light of the law \nlaid\ndown in\n the case of \nShiba Shankar Mohpatra\n (supra),\n\n 5\n\n petitioners' claim to challenge the seniority list of the\n year 2007 is highly belated and suffers from delay and\n laches and therefore, on the same analogy that the court\n exercising public law jurisdiction does not encourage\n agitation of stale claims where the right of third parties\n crystallizes in the interregnum. Thus, petition fails and\n dismissed on this ground.\n\n 6. This petition also deserves to be dismissed on merit\n inasmuch as there is no substantive claim put forward by\n the petitioner about the retrospective operation of the\n amendment contained in Annexure P/6, as there is no\n retrospectivity in the amendment but it has been made\n applicable prospectively only for the vacancies which\n have been accrued after publication of seniority list as is\n contained in Annexure P/1. Thus, on merits also\n petitioners have no case. Petition fails and is dismissed.\n\n (Vivek Agarwal)\n Judge\n\nSP\n\n Digitally signed by SANJEEV\n\n KUMAR PHANSE\n\n SANJEEV DN: c=IN, o=HIGH COURT OF\n M.P. BENCH GWALIOR, ou=P.
