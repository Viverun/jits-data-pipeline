In all the above cases, the alleg ations\n\nag ainst the petitioners were that they were illeg ally\n\nextracting / transporting sand -the Government\n\n: 37 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\nproperty without valid permit or evad ing payment of\n\nrequired royalty. The alleg ations are that thereby\n\nthey have committed theft of Government p roperty /\n\nsand which constitute the offences punishable under\n\nSection 379\nIPC and\nSections 4\n,\n4(1)\n,\n4(1A)\n,\n&\n\n42 read with\nSection 22\nof the MMDR Act and und er\n\nRules 3, 32 & 44 of the Rules.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nseek quashing of the aforesaid proceedings on the\n\nfollowing grounds:\n\n(i) As per\nSection 22\nof the MMDR Act,\n\nonly an officer authorised as per Rule\n\n2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules shall file\n\ncomplaints;\n\n(ii) The comp lainants / informants were not\n\nauthorised persons to file the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n(iii) Even authorised officers have to file\n\ncomplaint b efore the Mag istrate and not\n\n: 38 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\nbefore the Station House Officer of the\n\npolice station;\n\n(iv) The police are not competent to receive\n\nsuch complaints and take up\n\ninvestig ation on such complaints.\n\n6. Sri.Praveen K.uppar, learned HCGP\n\nsubmits that the police are competent to file the\n\nreport and on such reports register FIR when the\n\ncomplaints is for the offences punishab le under\nIPC\n.\n\n7. Therefore, the q uestion involved in all the\n\nabove cases is whether a complaint for violation of\n\nthe p rovisions of\nMMDR Act\ncan be filed before the\n\nStation House Officer of a police station and on such\n\ncomplaint whether the respondent police could\n\nregister the FIR and take up the investig ation?\n\n8. Section 22 of the MMDR Act reads as\n\nund er:\n\n\"22. Cognizance of offences.―No\ncourt shall take cognizance of any\noffence punishable under this Act or any\n\n: 39 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\nrules made thereunder except upon\ncomplaint in writing made by a person\nauthorised in this behalf by the Central\nGovernment or the State Government.\"\n\n9. Complaint is d efined in\nSection 2(d)\nof the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [for short\n\n'\nCr.P.C\n.'] as follows:\n\n\"2. Definitions.--In this Code, unless the\ncontext otherwise requires.--\n\n(d) \"Complaint\" means any allegation\nmade orally or in writing to a Magistrate,\nwith a view to his taking action under this\nCode, that some person, whether known\nor unknown, has committed an offence but\ndoes not include a police report.\"\n\n10. Rule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules d efines the\n\nauthorised officer as follows:\n\n\"2(1) (a-1-a) \"Authorised Officer\"\n\nmeans an officer not below the rank of\nGroup B authorized by the State\nGovernment or the Commissioner or the\nDirector of Mines and Geology or Deputy\nCommissioner of the District to act for the\nspecific purpose under these Rules.\"\n\n: 40 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\n11. The p erusal of the above provisions make\n\nit clear that the Court is b arred from taking\n\ncognizance of the offences und er the\nMMDR Act\nor\n\nthe Rules mad e thereund er unless the comp laint in\n\nwriting is mad e by the persons authorised under\n\nRule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules. Since\nSection 2(d)\nof\n\nCr.P.C. excludes the police report from the\n\ndefinition of complaint essentially the comp laint has\n\nto b e filed b efore the Mag istrate.\n\n12. In these cases, complainants have not\n\nstated in their complaints that they are the persons\n\nauthorised und er Rule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules to\n\nfile complaint. The complaints are not accompanied\n\nby any such authorization notifications. Even\n\nassuming that they are so authorised , the complaint\n\nin respect of the offences und er the\nMMDR Act\nand\n\nRules ought to have been filed before the Mag istrate\n\nand not before the Station House Officer of the\n\npolice station.\n\n: 41 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\n13. Hon'b le Sup reme Court in p arag rap hs 72\n\n& 73 of the judgment in\nState (NCT of Delhi) Vs.\n\nSanjay\n, (2014) 9 SCC 772 case in this reg ard has\n\nheld as follows:\n\n\"72. From a close reading of the\nprovisions of\nMMDR Act\nand the offence\ndefined under\nSection 378\nIPC, it is\nmanifest that the ingredients constituting\nthe offence are different. The\ncontravention of terms and conditions of\nmining lease or doing mining activity in\nviolation of\nSection 4\nof the Act is an\noffence punishable under\nSection 21\nof the\nMMDR Act, whereas dishonestly removing\nsand, gravel and other minerals from the\nriver, which is the property of the State,\nout of State's possession without the\nconsent, constitute an offence of theft.\nHence, merely because initiation of\nproceeding for commission of an offence\nunder the\nMMDR Act\non the basis of\ncomplaint cannot and shall not debar the\npolice from taking action against persons\nfor committing theft of sand and minerals\nin the manner mentioned above by\nexercising power under the Code of\n\n: 42 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\nCriminal Procedure and submit a report\nbefore the Magistrate for taking\ncognizance against such persons. In other\nwords, in a case where there is a theft of\nsand and gravel from the Government\nland, the police can register a case,\ninvestigate the same and submit a final\nreport under\nSection 173\nCr.P.C. before a\nMagistrate having jurisdiction for the\npurpose of taking cognizance as provided\nin\nSection 190(1)(d)\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\n73. After giving our thoughtful\nconsideration in the matter, in the light\nof relevant provisions of the Act vis-à-\nvis the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n\nand the\nIndian Penal Code\n, we are of\nthe definite opinion that the\ningredients constituting the offence\nunder the\nMMDR Act\nand the\ningredients of dishonestly removing\nsand and gravel from the riverbeds\nwithout consent, which is the\nproperty of the State, is a distinct\noffence under\nIPC\n. Hence, for the\ncommission of offence under\nSection\nIPC, on receipt of the police\n\n: 43 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n& Connected cases\n\nreport, the Magistrate having\njurisdiction can take cognizance of the\nsaid offence without awaiting the\nreceipt of complaint that may be filed\nby the authorised officer for taking\ncognizance in respect of violation of\nvarious provisions of the\nMMDR Act\n.\nConsequently, the contrary view taken by\nthe different High Courts cannot be\nsustained in law and, therefore, overruled.\nConsequently, these criminal appeals are\ndisposed of with a direction to the\nconcerned Magistrates to proceed\naccordingly.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n14. A read ing of the above judgment makes it\n\nclear that the p olice are not competent to register\n\nthe FIR for the offences punishab le under\nMMDR Act\n\nor the Rules, but they are not b arred from\n\nregistering the FIR for the offences punishab le\n\nund er\nIPC\n. Therefore, the FIR and consequential\n\nCriminal proceedings pend ing b efore the Mag istrate\n\nin the above cases so far they relate to the offences\n\n: 44 : Crl. P.
