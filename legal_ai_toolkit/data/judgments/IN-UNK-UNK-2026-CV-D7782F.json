The other was the\ncontributory scheme. Both these schemes are incorporated in\nRule 51 and 55 respectively of the Civil Services Pension\nRules 1972. On September 22, 1977 the Government of India\ndone away with the pre-condition of contribution of two\nmonths emoluments out of death-cum-retirement gratuity. But,\nthe widows of the Government servants who had not agreed to\nmake the contribution in accordance with the 1964 scheme\nwere denied the benefit of pension scheme and this\ndisability continued even after the changes introduced in\n1977 when the scheme ceased to be contributory Such widows\nmoved Supreme Court and Bombay High Court in writ petitions.\nThe High Court rejected the writ petition\n Disposing of the petitions and the appeal to this\nCourt,\n^\n HELD: 1. Since the family pension scheme has become\nnon-contributory effective from September 22,1977, any\nattempt at denying its benefit to widows and dependents of\nGovernment servants who had not taken advantage of the 1964\nliberalisation scheme by making or agreeing to make\nnecessary contribution would be denial of equality to\npersons similarly situated and hence violative of \nArt. 14.\n\nIf widows and dependents of deceased Government servants\nsince after September 22, 1977 would be entitled to benefits\nof family pension scheme without the obligation of making\ncontribution, those widows who were denied the benefits of\nthe ground that the Government servants having not agreed to\nmake the contribution, could not be differently treated\nbecause that would be introducing an invidious\nclassification among those who would be entitled to similar\ntreatment. [1046 B-D]\n1043\n 2. Where the Government servant rendered service,\nto compensate which a family pension scheme is devised the\nwidow and the dependent minors would equally be entitled to\nfamily pension .19 a matter of right. If fact the Court\nlooks upon pension not merely as a statutory right but as\nthe fulfilment of a constitutional promise inasmuch as it\npartakes the character of public assistance in cases of\nunemployment old-age, disablement or similar other cases of\nundeserved want. Relevant rules merely make effective the\nconstitutional mandate. That is how pension has been looked\nupon in D.S. Nakara's case, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 165. [1045; G-H\n1046 A]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\n CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petitions Nos. 5870-\n93/81,\n Under \nArticle 32\n of the constitution of India\n WITH\n\n Civil Appeal NO. 2226/85\n\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 14. 2. 1984 of the Bombay\nHigh Court in Writ Petition No. 4215 of 1983\n Yogesbwar Prasad, H. Salve, P. H. Parckh, Mrs., Rani\nChhabra, Ms. Data Krishnamurthy, Ms. A. Subhashini, A. S.\nPundir, J.S. Bali, S. Balakrishnan, Pramod Sarup and R. S.\nSodhi, for the petitioners.\n\n V. B. Joshi for the Appellant.\n\n The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n DESAI, J. Promise of socio-economic justice depicted in\nrosy language in Arts. 38, 39 and 41 is being translated\ninto a real action-oriented programme by the stand taken by\nthe Union of India and the Ministry of Finance in this group\nof petitions and application for special leave which\ndeserves approbation and commendation. Amongst the neglected\nsections of the society women form a bulk. In that bigger\nclass widows are possibly the worst sufferers both socially\nand economically. To them, a helping hand is extended, for\nproviding succour sorely needed, by the two statements made\nin the Court by Mr. B. Dutta, learned counsel appearing for\nthe Union of India and the Ministry of Finance. Throughout\nthe course of hearing, Mr. B. Dutta adopted a positive,\nconstructive and helpful attitude and he is equally entitled\nto our appreciation.\n\n As a sequel to the decision of the Constitution Bench\nof this Court in D.S. Nakara and Of hers v. Union of\nIndia(l) a number of petitions came to be filed by persons\nclaiming to be entitled to the socially beneficent approach\nof the Court. One such group comprised\n(1) [1983] 2 SCR 165\n\n1044\n\nwidows of erstwhile Government servants who are not in\nreceipt of family pension.\n\n Family pension came to be conceptualised in the year\n1950. When a Government servant die in harness or soon after\nretirement, in the traditional Indian family on the death of\nthe only earning member, the widow or the minor children\nwere not only rendered orphans but faced more often\ndestitution and starvation. Traditionally speaking the widow\nwas hardly in a position to obtain gainful employment. She\nsuffered the most in as much as she was deprived of the\ncompanionship of the husband and also became economically\norphaned. As a measure of socioeconomic justice family\npension scheme was devise to help the widows tie over the\ncrisis and till the minor children attain majority to extend\nthem some succour. This appeared to be the underlying\nmotivation in devising the family pension scheme. It was\nliberalised from time to time. The liberalisation was\nhowever subject to the condition that the Government Servant\nhad in his life time agreed that he shall make a\ncontribution of an amount equal to two months' emoluments or\nRs. 5,000 whichever is less out of the death-cum-retirement\ngratuity. Those Government servants who did not accept this\ncondition were denied the benefit of family pension scheme.\n\n Focussing on the liberalisation that was introduced in\n1964 it transpires that the widow and the minor children of\nthose Government servants who died prior to 1964 were not\neligible for the benefit of liberalised scheme. The other\nclass which was left out of the liberalisation scheme was\nthose Government servants who specifically opted out of the\nfamily pension scheme, 1964. The resultant situation was\nthat since January 1,1964 there were in force two parallel\nschemes in operation namely a) a pre-liberalisation scheme\nwhich continued to be in force those who retired prior to\n1.1.1964 or those who did not contribute out of the death-\ncum-retirement gratuity, roughly styled as non-contributory\nscheme. The other was the contributory scheme. Both these\nschemes are incorporated in Rule 54 and 55 respectively of\nthe Civil Services Pension Rules 1972.\n\n The Union of India in its onward march for ushering in\nsocioeconomic justice in the form of social security further\ntook a bold and imaginative step on September 22, 1977 by\nwhich the pre condition of two months' emolument out of\ndeath-cum-retirement gratuity was done away with.\nRecognising the need for such a\n\n1045\n\nbeneficial change, the memorandum introducing the 1977\nliberalisation recorded the decision of the Union of India\nas under:\n\n \"The staff side has suggested in the National\n Council of the JCN that this family pension is a social\n security measure and the employee should not be called\n upon to contribute towards the scheme. The matter has\n been examined in the light of the recommendations of\n the National Council and the President is pleased to\n decide that no deduction should be made from the death-\n cum-retirement gratuity as a contribution towards the\n family pension.\"\n\n Accordingly since September 22, 1977 the contributory\nscheme ceased to exist.A very analogous situation arose. The\nwidows of the Government Servants who had not agreed to make\nthe contribution in accordance with the 1964 scheme were\ndenied the benefit of pension scheme and this disability\ncontinued even after the changes introduced in 1977 when the\nscheme ceased to be contributory. Such widows moved this\nCourt in writ petitions. Widows similarly situated had also\nfiled Writ Petition No. 3749/84 in the High Court of\nJudicature at Bombay.A Division Bench of the High Court\nrejected the writ petition for reasons, which, in our\nopinion, are wholly untenable but that is beside the point.\nWe accordingly granted leave to the petitioners whose\npetition were dismissed by the Bombay High Court. Rule nisi\nwas issued in writ petitions filed in this Court.\n\n \nIt is not necessary to examine the concept of pension.\nAs already held by this Court in numerous judgments that\npension is a right not a bounty or gratuitous payment. The\npayment of pension does not depend upon the discretion of\nthe Government but is governed by the relevant rules and\nanyone entitled to the pension under the rules can claim it\nas a matter of right. \nDeoki Nandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\nand Ors.\n(\n1) State of Punjab & Anr. v. Iqbal Singh\n(2) and\nD.S. Vakara & Ors. v. Union of India. Where the Government\nServant rendered service, to compensate which a family\npension scheme is devised, the widow and the dependent\nminors would equally be entitled to family pension as a\nmatter of right. In fact we look upon pension not merely as\na statutory right but as the fulfilment of a constitutional\npromise in as much as it partakes the character of public\nassistance in cases of unemployment,\n(1) [1971] Supp. SCR 634\n(2) [19761 3 SCR 360\n\n1046\n\nold-age, disablement or similar other cases of underserved\nwant. Relevant rules merely make effective the\nconstitutional mandate. That is how pension has been looked\nupon in D.S. Nakara's judgment. At the hearing of group of\nmatters we pointed out that since the family pension scheme\nhas become non-contributory effective from September 22,\n1977 any attempt at denying its benefit to widows and\ndependents of Government servants who had not taken of the\n1964 liberalisation scheme by making or agreeing to make\nnecessary contribution would be denial of equality to\npersons similarly situated and hence violative of \nArt. 14.\n\nIf widows and dependents of deceased Government servants\nsince after September 22, 1977 would be entitled to benefits\nof family pension without the obligation of making\ncontribution, those widows who were denied the benefits on\nthe ground that the Government servants having not agreed to\nmake the contribution, could not be differently treated\nbecause that would be introducing an invidious\nclassification: among those who would be entitled to similar\ntreatment. When this glaring dissimilar treatment emerged in\nthe course of hearing in the Court, Mr. B. Dutta learned\ncounsel appearing for the Union of India requested for a\nshort adjournment to take further instructions.\n\n On the next hearing Mr. B. Dutta made a statement on\nbehalf of Union of India, the relevant portion of which may\nbe extracted:\n\n \"Government have examined the matter. As the\n Family Pension Scheme, 1964 was made non-contributory\n from 22.9.1977, Government would agree to extend the\n benefit of the Family Pension Scheme 1946 to all the\n living widows. Payment to such widows may be made from\n 22.9.1977 or the date of death of the pensioner,\n whichever is later, till the date of death of the\n widow. The benefit will also be available in cases\n where the death of the pensioner occurs hereafter.\n Administrative procedures are being evolved to\n facilitate identification of widows of Government\n pensioners and to lay down the guidelines for the\n determination of family pensions. The benefit of family\n pension mentioned above will not apply to the widows of\n Government servants who would not have been covered by\n the scheme even if the scheme had been given\n retrospective effect.\"\n\n1047\n\nWhile examining the statement it transpired that certain\nclarifications were necessary. 'Common Cause' a Society\nwhich is a petitioner in one petition pointed out certain\naspects of the statement which needed clarification. The\nCourt directed the the 'Common Cause' society to send a\nletter to the Ministry of Finance indicating the points on\nwhich clarifications were required by Y them. The issues\nraised by the Society may be summed up as under:\n\n \"(i) whether the orders will apply to the widow/minor\n son/ unmarried daughter as defined in the relevant\n provisions of family pension scheme;\n\n (ii) whether the scheme of pension as prescribed with\n effect from 1.1.1973 will be made uniformly\n applicable to all the eligible persons in the\n family pension scheme; and\n\n (iii) whether the benefits of family pension scheme\n will be made available to all pensioners\n irrespective of the fact whether they had or had\n not contributed two months' emoluments in terms of\n the original family pension scheme, which\n contribution was subsequently deleted with effect\n from 22 9. 1977.\"\n\n Today when the matter was taken up for final hearing\nanother statement was submitted by Mr B. Dutta on behalf of\nthe of India. The Government of India submitted its\nclarifications on the afore-mentioned three points which\nreads as under:\n\n \"(i) Governments are prepared to grant to the\n dependents i.e. minor sons, etc of the pensioners\n governed unclear pre- 1964 scheme the same\n pensioners benefits as are admissible to the\n dependents under current pension rules.\n\n (ii) It is clarified that Government are agreeable to\n apply the increased pension rates introduced from\n 1.1 1973 to all the eligible persons, including\n dependents. This will, however, be subject to the\n condition that the total amount admissible\n (excluding dearness relief) under the liberalised\n provision now being agreed to, will not be more\n than what is admissible to a person covered\n\n1048\n\nunder the Rules.\n\n (iii) Government have already agreed to the grant\n of ar rears of family pension with effect from\n 22.9.77-the date on which contribution of two\n months' emoluments by pensioners was dispensed\n with. Persons who are now to be granted the\n benefits of family pension will not be required to\n contribute two months emoluments. Similarly, no\n demand for refund of contribution already made by\n pensioners- will be entertained,'\n The clarifications offered are clear, unambiguous and\nwholly satisfactory. Learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners stated that nothing more is required to be done\nand requested us to incorporate the clarifications submitted\nto the Court. Accordingly these petitions and appeals are\ndisposed of in terms as herein above indicated. We order\naccordingly.\n\n The appeal against the decision of the Division Bench\nof the Bombay High Court is also allowed in the same terms.\nThis is a happy ending to this extremely humane problem.\n\nM.L.A. Appeal allowed\n\n1049",
