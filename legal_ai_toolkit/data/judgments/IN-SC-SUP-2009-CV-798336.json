Dattu\n\nNON-REPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.1793 OF 2009\n(Arising out of SLP(C) No. 22469 of 2007)\n\nPunjab State Electricity Board & Ors. ..........Appellants\n\nVersus\n\nJit Singh ........Respondent\n\nORDER\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2) Punjab State Electricity Board (`Board' in short) is before us in\n\nthis appeal, inter alia calling in question the correctness or\n\notherwise of the judgment and order passed by the High Court of\n\nPunjab and Haryana in Writ Petition No. 7326 of 2005 dated\n\n12.7.2007.\n\n3) The facts in nutshell are, the respondent was appointed as security\n\nguard on ad hoc basis on 27.01.1976 and his services were\n\nregularized with effect from 9.8.1978. He retired from service on\nattaining the age of superannuation on 31.7.2000. On his\n\nretirement, the respondent has received all the pensionary benefits.\n\n4) The Board has issued a circular dated 23.01.2001, giving certain\n\nbenefit of \"ad hoc service\" to Board employees. In short, in the\n\ncircular, it is stated, that, the period of ad hoc service would be\n\ncounted towards retirement benefit on regularization, provided the\n\nemployees fulfil certain conditions. A clarification is also issued\n\nby the Board, by Memo No. 41614/659 dated 14.2.2001, clarifying\n\nthe circular dated 23.1.2001.\n\n5) To take benefit of the circular issued by the Board, the respondent\n\nhad made a request to the Board to count his ad hoc service in the\n\nBoard before regularization of his service for the purpose of\n\ncalculating the pensionary benefits. The said claim is rejected by\n\nthe Board vide its order dated 5.10.2004. This issue was agitated\n\nby the respondent by filing a Writ Petition before the High Court\n\nof Punjab and Haryana. The court has granted relief to the\n\nrespondent. The findings and the conclusions reached therein is\n\nthe subject matter of this civil appeal.\n\n6) The learned counsel for the Board would contend, that, the High\n\nCourt was not correct in relying on the full bench decision of the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court in the case of\nKesar Chand vs.\n\nState of Punjab & Others\n; [AIR, 1988 Punjab and Haryana, 265],\n\nsince in that decision the court was concerned with the issue, the\n\neffect of regularization of service of work charge employee for the\n\npurpose of pensionary benefits which are available to the other\n\npublic servants. It is further contended, that, the Circular/Memo\n\ndated 23.1.2001 and subsequent Circular/Memo dated 14.2.2001\n\nare only prospective and the benefit cannot be granted to such of\n\nthose employees who have retired from service prior to the\n\nissuance of Circular/Memo dated 23.1.2001 and clarificatory\n\nMemo dated 14.2.2001. It is further contended that the reliance\n\nplaced by the respondent on Clause 7 of the Finance Circular No.\n\n73/89 issued by the Board is misplaced, since that circular was\n\nmade applicable to work-charge employees only. It is also\n\ncontended, that, since the respondent has not questioned the\n\nvalidity or otherwise of the Circular/Memo dated 23.1.2001 and\n\n14.2.2001, he cannot take the benefit of those circulars, since they\n\nare prospective and issued after respondent retired from service on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation.\n7) The learned counsel for the respondent-employee would contend\n\nthat there is no essential difference between a `work charge\n\nemployee' and an employee appointed on ad hoc basis and,\n\ntherefore, the High Court was justified in relying on the full bench\n\ndecision of Punjab and Haryana High Court in\nKesar Chand\n's case\n\nand directing the Board to reconsider the case of the respondent in\n\nthe light of\nthe said decision\n.\n\n8) The issue that requires our consideration and decision is, whether\n\nthe High Court was justified in relying on the decision of\nKesar\n\nChand\n's case to annul the order passed by the Board dated\n\n5.10.2004 and secondly, whether the ad hoc service of an\n\nemployee of the Board before regularization of his service requires\n\nto be counted while calculating the pensionary benefits of the\n\nrespondent.\n\n9) To resolve the controversy, we require to notice Memo/Circulars\n\nissued by the Board dated 23.1.2001 and 14.2.2001. They are :-\n\n(a) \"Memo No. 21064/21114/ENG-27(44)LCL 75\n\nDated 23.1.2001\n\nSubject: COUNTING OF ADHOC SERVICE FOR\nPENSIONARY BENEFITS ONLY\n\nThe matter regarding benefit of Adhoc Service has been\nunder the active consideration of the Board for some time past, the\nBoard in its 11/2000 meeting held on 29.12.2000 has decided that\nentire adhoc service rendered by the Board employees, shall\nregularization, provided the employees fulfill the following\nconditions:-\n\n1) Who fulfilled the condition of minimum prescribed\nqualifications and experience, if any, for the past at the time of\nappointment and were recruited by following proper procedure were\ncontinuing un-interruptedly till date of regularization.\n\nii) Who fulfilled condition of minimum qualification and\nexperience at the time of recruitment but were not recruited\nby following proper procedure and continued in service\nwithout any interruption.\n\niii) This benefit will not be admissible to those who do not\nfulfill either of the above two conditions. It was\nspecifically decided that this benefit shall not be given to\nthose employees who have either been retired or retired\nfrom the service of the Board.\"\n\n(b) Memo No. 41614/659 ENG-27(44)LCL 75\nDated : 14.2.2001\n\nSUBJECT : COUNTING OF ADHOC SERVICE\nFOR PENSIONARY BENEFITS ONLY\n\nPart 2 of this office memo No. 21064/21114/ENG-27 (44) LC-75\ndated 23.1.2000 vide which instructions were issued on the subject\ncited is amended and may be substituted as under :-\n\n2) This benefit shall also not be given to these employees who have\neither retired on attaining the age of superannuation/compulsory\nretired/taken premature retirement or resigned from the service of the\nBoard.\"\n10) In our view, before we advert to the issues canvassed, it would be\n\nuseful to extract the decision of the Board on the claim made by\n\nthe respondent. It is as under :-\n\n\"Memo No. 12958/SGE-740\nDated: 5.10.04\nSubject: In response to the legal notice given under\nSection 80\n\nCPC by Shri Jit Singh, ASI, retired, on 31.7.2000.\n\nIn response to the above, it is being intimated to you that as per\nthe instructions of Board, you are not entitled to the benefit of ad\nhoc service for pensionary benefits.\"\n\n11) The facts which are not disputed and which cannot be disputed\n\nalso are, that, the respondent was appointed as a security guard on\n\nad hoc basis on 27.1.1976 and his services were regularized as\n\nsecurity guard with effect from 9.8.1978. The respondent retired\n\nfrom service on attaining the age of superannuation on 31.7.2000.\n\nThe Board has issued a circular dated 23.1.2001 for the purpose of\n\ncounting of ad hoc service rendered by the Board employees for\n\nthe purpose of quantifying the pensionary benefits after their\n\nservices are regularized in the Board, if they satisfies the\n\nconditions envisaged in the circular. By yet another\n\nCircular/Memo dated 14.2.2001 the Board has clarified its earlier\n\ncircular that the benefit of the circular dated 23.1.2000 shall not be\ngiven to those employees who have either retired on attaining the\n\nage of superannuation/compulsorily retired/take premature\n\nretirement or resigned from the service of the Board before\n\nissuance of the Board's circular dated 23.1.2000. That only means\n\nthe circulars are given prospective effect. The respondent in the\n\nwrit petition filed does not question the validity or otherwise of\n\nthe circular issued on the ground that they are violative of any\n\nConstitutional provisions, including\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\n\nof India. It is not even the case of the respondent that the circulars\n\nissued by the Board is arbitrary, since it treats employees retired\n\nfrom service prior to and after issuance of the circular of the\n\nBoard. Therefore, it may not be proper for us to take up an issue\n\nwhich is not pleaded or urged either before this Court or before the\n\nHigh Court by the respondent-employee of the Board.\n\n12) A retired employee of the Board being of the view that he is\n\nentitled for the benefit of the Circulars issued by the Board dated\n\n23.01.2001 and 14.02.2001, has approached the Board to count his\n\nservice when he worked as adhoc employee till the date of\n\nregularization of his service for the purpose of calculating his\n\npensionary benefits. This request is rejected by the Board by its\ncryptic and non-speaking order. The order so made was the\n\nsubject matter of the writ petition. The court following the\n\ndecision in\nKesar Chand\n's case (supra) has allowed the petition on\n\nthe ground that in\nthe said decision\n, it has been held \"that once\n\nservice of work charge employee is regularized, there is no logic\n\nto deprive him of the pensionary benefits available to other public\n\nservants. Even the temporary or officiating service of the\n\ngovernment has to be reckoned in determining the qualifying\n\nservice.\"\n\n13) In\nKesar Chand\n's case, the facts were, the employee had joined as\n\nBeldar on August 1, 1951 as a work charge employee in the office\n\nof the Sub-Divisional Officer, Pathankot. He had regular service\n\nwithout any break till the date of retirement from service on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation. While claiming pensionary\n\nbenefits at least from the date, he is deemed to have been\n\nregularized in service, he had relied on the award passed by the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal, and further had questioned the vires of Rule\n\n3.12 and Rule 1.2 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules, which had\n\nbeen relied on by the respondents to deprive the pensionary\n\nbenefits. It was his further case that he was a government servant\nand was paid from the government revenue and, therefore, could\n\nnot be excluded from the purview of Punjab Civil Services Rules\n\nin relation to pension. In the back drop of the aforesaid fact\n\nscenario, the Punjab and Haryana High Court granted relief to the\n\nwork charge employee, who had put in continuous service till the\n\ndate of retirement on attaining the age of superannuation.\n\n14) In the instant case, the facts are not identical. The respondent is an\n\nemployee of Punjab State Electricity Board and not an employee\n\nof the State Government. He is not claiming any benefit under\n\nPunjab Civil Services Rules, but claiming benefit in view of the\n\ncirculars issued by the Board. He has not even questioned the\n\nvires of the circular issued by the Board, wherein a cut off date is\n\nprescribed by limiting to those ad hoc employees who are still in\n\nservice and whose services have been regularized etc. Therefore,\n\nin our opinion, the High Court by placing reliance on a decision\n\nwhich does not have any bearing on the fact situation pleaded by\n\nthe petitioner ought not to have observed that the principles\n\nenunciated in\nKesar Chand\n's case will apply to the case of the\n\nrespondent and, therefore, authorities of the Board should\n\nreconsider the claim of the respondent-employee in the light of the\nprinciples enunciated in the said case. Therefore, we cannot\n\nsustain this portion of the order passed by the High Court.\n\n15) Now, we come to the order passed by the Board dated 5.10.2004.\n\nIn our view, it is suffice to state, that, the order is a non-speaking\n\norder in the sense, it does not contain any reasons much less\n\ncogent reason so fair play requires recording precise and cogent\n\nreasons when an order affects the right of citizen. In the impugned\n\norder, we do not see any reason in the order passed by the\n\nauthorities of the Board. Therefore, in our view, the High Court\n\nought to have set aside the order and remitted the matter to the\n\nauthorities of the Board, to reconsider the claim of the respondent\n\nin accordance with law. That only means the order should have\n\nbeen an open remand, instead of asking the Board to reconsider\n\nthe claim with reference to a particular principle\nlaid down by\nthe\n\nHigh Court in a different factual scenario. Since, we are\n\nremanding the matter, we have not answered the second issue.\n\n16) In the result we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order\n\nand direct the authorities of the Board to reconsider the claim of\n\nthe respondent in accordance with law.\n\n17) The appeal is disposed of accordingly.\n\n.......................................J.\n[ TARUN CHATTERJEE ]\n\n.......................................J.\n[ H.L.
