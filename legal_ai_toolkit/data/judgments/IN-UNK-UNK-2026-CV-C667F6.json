The plaint averments in brief are as under:\n\n The 1st plaintiff is the wife, 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs\n\nare the daughters of late Dodda Abbaiah. The said\n\nDodda Abbaiah and the defendant No.1 are the direct\n\n 7 OS No.5985/1988\n\nbrothers and sons of late Sidda Reddy. The plaintiffs\n\nand the defendants are governed by Hindu Undivided\n\nJoint Family and suit schedule properties are all\n\nancestral and joint family properties. The said Dodda\n\nAbbaiah died on 28.6.1987 at Bellandur Village leaving\n\nbehind the plaintiffs and his rights and interest in the\n\nsuit schedule properties. The plaintiffs are the sole\n\nsurviving successors to the estate of Late Dodda\n\nAbbaiah.\n\n The said Dodda Abbaiah and the defendant were\n\nacquired and managing the suit schedule ancestral\n\nundivided joint family properties. After the death of\n\nsaid Dodda Abbaiah, the defendant alone is managing\n\nthe suit schedule properties. During the life time of Late\n\nDodda Abbaiah, he was very much concerned and\n\ninterested to effect the partition and division of the joint\n\nfamily suit schedule properties between himself and the\n\ndefendant. The said Dodda Abbaiah died unexpectedly\n\n 8 OS No.5985/1988\n\nto the surprise of the plaintiffs and relations without\n\neffecting the partition.\n\n After the death of Dodda Abbaiah the plaintiffs\n\nrequested and advised the defendant to have a\n\nsettlement and divide the suit schedule properties by\n\nmetes and bounds. The defendant refused to effect\n\npartition, but started to enjoy independently as his\n\nown.\n\n The plaintiffs are also succeeded to the estate of\n\ndeceased Dodda Abbaiah, who is entitled to half share\n\nin all the ancestral joint family properties, which were\n\nowned and possessed jointly along with the defendant.\n\nThe plaintiffs are entitled to equal shares in the half\n\nshare in the joint family suit schedule properties.\n\n The defendant is now proclaiming that he alone is\n\nentitled to the suit schedule property and making\n\narrangements to alienate the suit schedule properties\n\nwithout any notice to the plaintiffs and also making\n\nattempts to change the revenue records and documents\n\n 9 OS No.5985/1988\n\nin his individual names. The defendant refused partition\n\nof the suit schedule properties. The defendant is\n\ndepriving the rights of the plaintiffs over the suit\n\nschedule properties.\n\n The plaintiffs are also issued legal notice dated\n\n13.1.1988 calling upon the defendant to effect partition\n\nin the suit schedule properties by metes and bounds.\n\nThe defendant instead of effecting partition, issued an\n\nuntenable reply dated 27.1.1988 and thus refused to\n\neffect partition.\n\n The plaintiffs are legally entitled for half share in\n\nall the suit schedule properties as the plaintiffs are the\n\nsurviving successors to the estate of Late Dodda\n\nAbbaiah, who died in the year 1987 leaving behind the\n\nplaintiffs and his half share of estate in the undivided\n\njoint family ancestral suit schedule properties.\n\n During the pendency of the suit, the defendants\n\nNo.1 and 2 have formed sites in the following item Nos.3\n\n 10 OS No.5985/1988\n\nand 5 of the schedule and have sold the same to\n\ndefendants No.3 to 6 as detailed hereunder.\n\n 1) The portion of item No.3 bearing Sy.No.79/2\n measuring 1 acre 0.03 guntas\n\n 2) The portion of item No.5 bearing Sy.No.79/3\n measuring 0.33 guntas by for\n\n 3) The 3rd defendant has purchased 4 sites\n under the registered sale deeds dated\n 13.3.2006, 15.6.2006, 27.02.2006 and\n 14.02.2005\n\n 4) The 4th defendant has purchased the site\n under the registered sale deed dated\n 25.8.2005\n\n 5) The 5th defendant has purchased one site\n under the registered sale deed dated\n 16.6.2006\n\n 6) The 6th defendant has purchased one site\n under the registered sale deed dated\n 5.7.2006\n\n During the pendency of the suit, portion of the\n\nlands described in item Nos.2, 4, 6 and 7 were acquired\n\nby Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board -\n\nKIADB, Bangalore and part of the matter is the subject\n\nmatter of LAC.No.57/2008 and the same is pending\n\ndisposal before the CCH No.17. In this regard the\n\nletters written by Spl. LAO, KIADB, Bangalore are as\n\nfollows:\n\n 11 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 1) Letter dated 10.11.2005 addressed by the\n Spl. LAO, KIADB, Bangalore to the Registrar,\n City Civil Court, Bangalore\n\n 2) Letter dated 11.04.2008 addressed by the\n Spl. LAO, KIADB, Bangalore to the Prl.

Hence prays to decree the\n\n suit.\n\n 4. Upon service of summons, the defendant No.1\n\nappeared before the court through his counsel and filed\n\nwritten statement contending that Late Dodda Abbaiah was\n\nthe elder brother of this defendant and 1st plaintiff married\n\nDodda Abbaiah about 50 years ago, but she did not live with\n\nhim for a couple of years as his wife. She deserted and\n\nwalked out of the life of Dodda Abbaiah more than 45 years\n\nago and was openly living with one Kadubisanahally\n\nNarayana Reddy for a few years as his mistress. After some\n\nyears she left him and was living at different places and\n\npresently she is living at the address given in the plaint. After\n\nthe 1st plaintiff deserted him, Dodda Abbaiah married again\n\none Chinnamma, who was living with him till she died about\n\n 13 OS No.5985/1988\n\n30 years ago. The Late Dodda Abbaiah did not have any\n\nissue either from the 1st plaintiff or his 2nd wife.\n\n In as much as they were never born while the 1st\n\nplaintiff was living with Late Dodda Abbaiah in his house or\n\nwhile she was living with Kadubisanahally Narayana Reddy.\n\nTill today this defendant does not know hen and where the\n\n2nd and 3rd plaintiffs were born to the 1st plaintiff. He admits\n\nthat Dodda Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 at Bellandur Village.\n\nThis defendant and his brother Dodda Abbaiah were never\n\nliving as members of joint Hindu family and there were no\n\njoint family properties to be shared between them at the time\n\nof death of Dodda Abbaiah as alleged. The suit schedule\n\nproperties are in exclusive possession and enjoyment of the\n\ndefendant are his own absolute properties, in which late\n\nDodda Abbaiah had no right, title or interest.\n\n Late Dodda Abbaiah after the death of his 2nd wife\n\nrelinquished his share in the ancestral properties i.e. item\n\nNo.2 and 4 to 7 of the suit schedule properties in favour of\n\nthis defendant and left village and living in different places for\n\n 14 OS No.5985/1988\n\na few years. He returned to the village after 20 years ago and\n\nliving a life of mendicant and eking out his livelihood by\n\nengaging himself as an agricultural labourer and after\n\ncompleting 60 years of age he was getting old age pension for\n\nthe last 15 years till his death and was maintaining himself\n\nwith that pension amount and small helps given by well-\n\nwishers and sympathizers in the village.\n\na) The suit schedule item No.1 and 3 are the self acquired\n\n properties of defendant. He purchased the 1st item as\n\n vacant site from his own funds and built the present house\n\n thereon from his own funds. Likewise the item No.3 was\n\n purchased by defendant under sale deed dated 20.8.1964\n\n from one Venkatappa @ Abbaiah Reddy from his own\n\n funds. The khatha of all the properties are changed to the\n\n name of this defendant and he is in possession and\n\n enjoyment of the same as sole absolute owner thereof.\n\n 15 OS No.5985/1988\n\n As a matter of fact Late Dodda Abbaiah had given his\n\nconsent and no objection for the transfer of khatha in favour\n\nof this defendant in respect of ancestral family properties,\n\nwhich clearly establish that he had relinquished right if any\n\nhe had in the said properties in favour of this defendant.\n\n That being so the plaintiffs have no legal right to claim\n\nany share in the sole and absolute properties of the\n\ndefendant. The 1st plaintiff, who deserted Late Dodda\n\nAbbaiah more than 45 years ago and was leading a\n\nquestionable life all these years has no legal right or\n\ncompetence to claim any share n the alleged estate of Late\n\nDodda Abbaiah as his legal heir. The 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs are\n\nnot the daughters of Late Dodda Abbaiah and therefore they\n\ncannot claim themselves to be the legal heirs of Dodda\n\nAbbaiah much less claim any share in the suit schedule\n\nproperties.\n\n Kate Dodda Abbaiah never demanded for partition and\n\ndivision of the suit schedule properties at any time claiming\n\nthem to be the joint family properties of himself and the\n\n 16 OS No.5985/1988\n\ndefendant. No did the plaintiffs demand the defendant after\n\nthe death of Dodda Abbaiah to effect division of the suit\n\nschedule properties by metes and bounds. The suit schedule\n\nproperties are not the joint family properties of Dodda\n\nAbbaiah and the defendant.\n\n The defendant got the revenue records and documents\n\nrelating to some of the suit schedule properties changed to\n\nhis name and is also attempting to change the records and\n\ndocuments relating to other suit properties to his individual\n\nname. The defendant being the absolute and sole owner of\n\nthe suit schedule properties is entitled to exercise his right of\n\nownership over them in any manner and take steps to\n\nsafeguard his title and interest in his properties in the\n\nmanner he thinks best and proper. The plaintiffs have locus-\n\nstandi or authority to question the said right of exercise of\n\nownership by the defendant and make a grievance of it.\n\n It is true that plaintiffs had caused legal notice dated\n\n13.1.1988 issued to the defendant making false and\n\nuntenable allegations and the same has been suitably replied.\n\n 17 OS No.5985/1988\n\nThe 1st plaintiff deserted and walked out of the life of Dodda\n\nAbbaiah more than 45 years.\n\n The plaintiffs are not entitled to maintain the suit for\n\npartition as they are not at all the legal heirs of deceased\n\nDodda Abbaiah and even otherwise Late Dodda Abbaiah\n\nhaving relinquished his share in the ancestral properties in\n\nfavour of defendant more than 30 years ago, from which\n\nperiod the defendant is in exclusive possession of all the\n\nproperties in his own right, exercising right of ownership\n\nopenly and uninterruptedly all these years. Items No.1 and 3\n\nare the self acquired properties of defendants and as such the\n\nplaintiffs have no right to claim any share in the said items.\n\nItem No.6 has been sold by the defendant to one\n\nB.Venkataswamy Reddy, son of Pillaiah under registered sale\n\ndeed dated 17.9.1984 and said purchaser is in possession of\n\nthe said land. The suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary\n\nparties i.e. alinee of item No.6 of the schedule property has\n\nnot been made as a party to the suit. Hence, prayed to\n\ndismiss the suit.\n\n 18 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 5. The defendant No.1 died during the pendency of\n\nthe suit and thereafter his legal heirs were brought on record\n\nas defendant No.1(a) and 1(b). The defendant No.1(a) and (b)\n\nare also died, and their legal heirs i.e. the defendant No.1(a)(i)\n\nand 1(b)(i) were brought on record, who appeared before the\n\ncourt through their counsel and filed additional written\n\nstatement contending that Chikka Abbaiah had married\n\nSmt.Thimmakka and Smt.Papamma, they were arrayed as\n\ndefendant No.1(a) and 1(b). The defendant No.1(a) and 1(b)\n\nduring their life time have executed a Will dated 23.12.2009\n\nbequeathing the items No.1 to 3 and 7. The defendant No.1(b)\n\ndied on 25.11.2011 and defendant No.1(a) died on 6.10.2013\n\nleaving behind this defendant to succeed to their estate in\n\nterms of Will dated 23.12.2009. In pursuance of the said will\n\nthe defendant No.1(a) and (b) have succeeded to the\n\nproperties under the will and in possession and enjoyment of\n\nthe same and exercising acts of ownership over the said\n\nproperties. The plaintiffs were never in possession of any\n\nportion of suit schedule properties at any point of time and as\n\n 19 OS No.5985/1988\n\nsuch the alleged joint possession is specifically denied as\n\nfalse. Hence, prayed to dismiss the suit.\n\n 6. The 2nd defendant filed written statement\n\ncontending that he is bonafide purchaser of item No.3 of the\n\nsuit schedule property under two registered sale deed dated\n\n12.2.1996 and 31.1.1996 for valuable sale consideration. At\n\nthe time of purchase, it was represented to him by the 1st\n\ndefendant that the property in question is an ancestral\n\nproperty and brother of Dodda Abbaiah died issueless and\n\nthat 1st defendant was the sole surviving male successor to\n\nthe property in question. This defendant after verification of\n\ncertain facts purchased item No.3 of the suit schedule\n\nproperty. The present suit is filed for partition of certain\n\nproperties against his vendor. He is not aware of any legal\n\nproceedings pending in respect of the properties that he\n\npurchased. Hence, he adopts the written statement filed by\n\n1st defendant. Accordingly, prayed to dismiss the suit.\n\n 20 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 7. The defendant No.3 appeared through his counsel\n\nbut did not file his written statement.\n\n 8. Inspite of service of summons, the defendant No.4\n\nnot appeared before the court and hence he is placed exparte.\n\n 9. The defendant No.5 appeared through his counsel\n\nbut did not file his written statement.\n\n 10. The 6th defendant filed written statement\n\ncontending that during the pendency of the suit he came to\n\nknow that 1st plaintiff died leaving behind plaintiffs No.2 and\n\n3 as her sole surviving heirs. The plaintiffs No.2 and 3 have\n\nexecuted two release deeds with respect to the item No.1 and\n\n2 of the written statement schedule properties in favour of\n\nhimself and 5th defendant. By virtue of the said release deeds\n\nthe dispute between the plaintiff on one hand and 5th\n\ndefendant and himself on the other hand stands totally\n\nsettled and adjusted in respect of item Nos.1 and 2 of the\n\n 21 OS No.5985/1988\n\nwritten statement schedule properties. In that view of the\n\nmatter there is no lis between the plaintiffs No.1 and 2 on one\n\nhand and 5th defendant and this defendant on the other hand\n\nand the said settlement has to be recorded by this court. The\n\ndefendants No.5 and 6 are bonafide purchasers for valuable\n\nconsideration. The defendants No.5 and 6 are entitled to deal\n\nwith the properties purchased by them as they choose. There\n\ncannot be any order restraining them from putting up\n\nconstruction. He admits that Dodda Abbaiah and Chikka\n\nAbbaiah are sons of Late Sidda Reddy. It is not known and\n\nhence not admitted that plaintiffs and defendants are\n\ngoverned by Hindu Undivided Joint family and suit schedule\n\nproperties are all ancestral and joint family properties. It is\n\ntrue that Dodda Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 leaving behind\n\nthe plaintiffs as his sole surviving legal heirs. It is denied that\n\nDodda Abbaiah and defendants were managing the schedule\n\nproperty and after the death of Dodda Abbaiah, defendant\n\nalone is managing the schedule properties. The plaintiffs are\n\n 22 OS No.5985/1988\n\nnot entitled to equal share in the half share in the joint family\n\nproperties.\n\n The properties were sold for legal necessities and hence\n\neven if the plaint averments are proved the sale deed in\n\nfavour of this defendant is valid. The defendant No.5 got he\n\nproperty described in item No.1 of the written statement\n\nschedule under sale deed dated 05.07.2006 executed by\n\nSri.B.N.Chandrashekar and Jayarama Reddy. The vendor of\n\ndefendant No.5 purchased the said property from G.Rajashree\n\nunder sale deed dated 12.11.2003 and Smt.G.Rajashree got\n\nthe same under sale deed dated 18.02.1998 executed by\n\nChikka Abbaiah. The defendant No.5 is the absolute owner of\n\nthe property. However to avoid litigations and to have peace\n\nof mind this defendant got a release deed executed by\n\nplaintiffs No.2 and 3 and as such the suit is liable to\n\ndismissed against the defendant No.5.\n\n Defendant No.6 got the property described in item No.2\n\nof the written statement schedule under sale deed dated\n\n5.7.2006 executed by Smt.Y.Sumalatha. Said Y.Sumalatha\n\n 23 OS No.5985/1988\n\npurchased the said property from Chikka Abbaiah vide sale\n\ndeed dated 20.01.1998. The defendant No.6 is the absolute\n\nowner of the said property. However to avoid litigations and\n\nto have peace of mind this defendant got a release deed\n\nexecuted by plaintiffs No.2 and 3 and as such the suit is\n\nliable to dismissed against the defendant No.5. Hence,\n\nprayed to dismiss the suit against defendants No.5 and 6 with\n\nrespect to written statement schedule item No.1 and 2\n\nproperties, which is portion of item No.5 of the suit schedule\n\nproperty.\n\n SCHEDULE PROPERTY\n\n Item No.1: All that piece and parcel of the property\n\nbaring Site No.79-3/5, Old katha No.743, New Katha No.79-\n\n3/5 assessment No.912, carved out of converted property\n\nbearing Sy.Nos.79/2 & 79/3 measuring east to west: 50 feet\n\nand north to south: 71 feet, in all measuring 3550 sq.ft.\n\nsituated at Bellandur Village, Varthur Hobli, Bangalore East\n\nTaluk (previously called as Bangalore South Taluk) and\n\nbounded on:\n\n 24 OS No.5985/1988\n\n East by : Site No.76/3/6\n\n West by : Site Nos.79/3/3 & 79/3/4\n\n North by : Private property\n\n South by : Site No.79/3/3 and Road\n\n Item No.2: All that piece and parcel of the property\n\nbaring Site No.79-3/6, Old katha No.744, New Katha No.79-\n\n3/6 assessment NO.913, carved out of converted property\n\nbearing Sy.Nos.79/2 &79/3 measuring east to west: 50 feet\n\nand north to south: 71 feet, in all measuring 3550 sq.ft.\n\nsituated at Bellandur Village, Varthur Hobli, Bangalore East\n\nTaluk (previously called as Bangalore South Taluk) and\n\nbounded on:\n\n East by : Private property\n\n West by : Site Nos.79/3/5\n\n North by : Private property\n\n South by : Site No.79/3/4 and Road\n\n 25 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 11. The defendants No.5 and 6 filed additional written\n\nstatement contending that these defendants are not aware of\n\nacquisition of portion of property described in item Nos.2, 4, 6\n\nand 7 by KIADB and the letter referred to in the application\n\nby the LAO. It is not admitted that the amount of\n\ncompensable payable has to be shared between plaintiff and\n\ndefendants. The defendants have purchased portion of item\n\nNo.5 of the suit schedule property. Item No.5 of the suit\n\nschedule property has not been acquired. They denied that\n\nduring the pendency of the suit, sites are formed. Hence,\n\nprayed to dismiss the suit.\n\n 12. The defendant No.7 appeared through his counsel,\n\nbut did not file his written statement.\n\n 13. On the basis of the above pleadings of both the\n\nparties, the following issues have been framed by my learned\n\npredecessor in office:-\n\n 26 OS No.5985/1988\n\n1) Whether the plaintiffs prove that suit\n properties are the ancestral and joint\n family properties of Dodda Abbaiah and\n defendant?\n\n2) Whether the plaintiffs prove that plaintiffs\n and defendant are in joint possession of the\n suit properties?\n\n3) Do the plaintiffs prove that Dodda Abbaiah\n died in 1987, leaving behind him the\n plaintiffs?\n\n4) Do the plaintiffs prove that they are entitled\n for half share in the entire joint family\n properties?\n\n5) Do the defendant proves that 1st plaintiff\n deserted her husband and walked out of\n his life more than 45 years ago and\n therefore not entitled for share?\n\n6) Whether the defendant proves that item\n No.1 and 3 of the schedule properties are\n his self acquired properties?\n\n7) Whether the defendant proves that his\n brother late Dodda Abbaiah relinquished\n his share in the ancestral properties i.e.\n item 2,4 to 7 in the schedule to plaint,\n about 30 years ago?\n\n8) Whether defendant proves that the suit is\n properly valued?\n\n9) Whether the defendant proves that the suit\n is bad for non-joinder of necessary and\n proper parties, alinee of item 6 has not\n been made as a party to the suit?\n\n10) Whether the plaintiffs prove that they\n are entitled for partition of their half share\n and separate possession of their share in\n all the suit properties?\n\n11) Do the plaintiffs prove that they are\n entitled for mesne profits from the date of\n\n 27 OS No.5985/1988\n\n suit till the delivery of possession of their\n respective legitimate share in the suit\n properties?\n\n12) What relief or order?\n\n ADDL. ISSUES\n\n 1) Whether the 2nd defendant proves that\n he has purchased property after\n verifying the representation of 1st\n defendant that he was sole surviving\n male successor to the property?\n\n ADDL. ISSUES FRAMED ON 14.6.2011\n\n 1) Whether the plaintiffs prove that\n defendants No.1 and 2 have formed sites\n in suit properties as contended by the\n plaintiffs in para 8(a) of the plaint?\n\n 2) Whether the plaintiffs prove that the\n lands in suit item No.2, 4, 6 and 7 were\n acquired by the Karnataka Industrial\n Areas Development Board - KIADB\n Bangalore and the same is the part of the\n subject matter of L.A.C.No.47 of 2007\n pending disposal before the City Civil\n Court, CCH.No.17 as contended by the\n plaintiffs in para -8(b) of the plaint?\n\n 3) Whether the plaintiffs prove that amount\n of compensation in respect of the\n acquired lands will have to be partitioned\n amongst the plaintiffs and the\n defendants, who are entitled to share the\n suit schedule properties as contended by\n the plaintiffs in para 8(c) of the plaint?\n\n 28 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 14. The plaintiffs in order to prove the case have\n\nexamined their Special Power of Attorney holder as PW-1 and\n\ngot marked seventy four documents at Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.74 and\n\nconfronted Ex.D.13 and D.14and examined two witnesses as\n\nPW2 and PW3. The power of attorney holder of legal\n\nrepresentatives 1 and 2 of the 1st defendant examined himself\n\nas DW1 and got marked Ex.D.1 to D.3. The General Power of\n\nAttorney holder of defendant No.2 examined as DW2 and got\n\nmarked Ex.D.4 to D.12. The defendant No.6 examined himself\n\nas DW3 and got marked documents at Ex.D.15 to D.24.\n\n 15. Heard the arguments and perused the records of\n\nthe case.\n\n 16. My findings to the above issues are as under:\n\n Issue Nos.1 & 2 : In the affirmative\n\n Issue No.3 : Partly in the affirmative\n\n Issue Nos.5 to 7 : In the negative\n\n Issue No.8 : In the negative\n\n 29 OS No.5985/1988\n\n Issue No.9 : In the negative\n\n Addl.

ISSUE No.1 TO 3 AND 5 TO 7:- Since these\n\nIssues are interconnected hence they are taken up together\n\ncommon discussion in order to avoid repetition of facts and\n\nevidence.\n\n 18. It is admitted fact that Dodda Abbaiah and\n\ndefendant No.1 are the direct brothers and sons of Late Sidda\n\nReddy. It is admitted fact that the 1st plaintiff is the wife of\n\nDodda Abbaiah. There is no dispute that the said Dodda\n\n 30 OS No.5985/1988\n\nAbbaiah and the defendant No.1 are residents of Bellandur\n\nVillage. There is no dispute that item No.2 and 4 to 7 are the\n\nancestral properties of the said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant\n\nNo.1. There is no dispute that during the pendency of the suit\n\nthe defendants No.1 and 2 have formed sites in item Nos.3\n\nand 5 of the suit schedule property and have sold the same to\n\ndefendants No.3 to 6 and the portion of the item Nos.2, 4, 6\n\nand 7 were acquired by the Karnataka Industrial Area\n\nDevelopment Board, Bangalore.\n\n 19. It is further case of the plaintiffs that 2nd and 3rd\n\nplaintiffs are the daughters of the plaintiff No.1 and Late\n\nDodda Abbaiah. They are the members of Hindu Undivided\n\nJoint Family and suit schedule properties are the ancestral\n\nand joint family properties. The said Dodda Abbaiah died on\n\n28.6.1987 leaving behind the plaintiffs as his survival\n\nsuccessors. After the death of the said Dodda Abbaiah the\n\ndefendant No.1 alone managing the suit schedule properties.\n\nDuring the life time of Dodda Abbaiah there was no partition\n\n 31 OS No.5985/1988\n\nin the joint family. After the death of Dodda Abbaiah the\n\nplaintiffs requested the defendant No.1 to divide the suit\n\nschedule properties by metes and bounds but the defendant\n\nNo.1 refused to effect partition, but started to enjoy\n\nindependently as of his own and they are entitle for equal\n\nshare in the half share of the joint family suit schedule\n\nproperties.\n\n 20. It is the case of the defendant No.1 that the\n\nplaintiff No.1 married Dodda Abbaiah about 50 years ago, but\n\nshe did not live with him for more than a couple of years and\n\nshe deserted and walked out of the life of Dodda Abbaiah\n\nmore than 45 years ago and openly living with one\n\nKadubisanahalli Narayana Reddy for few years as his\n\nmistress and after some time she left him and was living in\n\ndifferent places and presently she is living in the address\n\nshown in the cause title. After the 1st plaintiff deserted him,\n\nDodda Abbaiah married one Chinnamma, who was living with\n\nhim till she died about 30 years ago. The Late Dodda\n\n 32 OS No.5985/1988\n\nAbbaiah did not have any issues either from the 1st plaintiff or\n\nhis 2nd wife. The plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the daughters\n\nof Dodda Abbaiah and they were never born while the 1st\n\nplaintiff was living with the Dodda Abbaiah. Dodda Abbaiah\n\nand the defendant No.1 never living as members of the joint\n\nfamily and there were no joint family properties to be shared.\n\nThe suit schedule properties are in exclusive possession and\n\nenjoyment of the defendant No.1 as his own absolute\n\nproperties, in which Dodda Abbaiah had no right or interest.\n\nAfter the death of Dodda Abbaiah his 2nd wife relinquished his\n\nshare in the item No.2 and 4 to 7 of the schedule properties\n\nin favour of the defendant No.1 and left village and living in\n\ndifferent places for few years and he returned to the village\n\nafter 20 years ago. The suit schedule item Nos.1 to 3 are the\n\nself acquired properties of defendant No.1 as he purchased\n\nthe item No.1 from his own funds and built the house therein\n\nout of his own funds and defendant No.1 purchased the item\n\nNo.3 out of his own funds. The said Dodda Abbaiah had\n\ngiven consent and no objection for the transfer of properties\n\n 33 OS No.5985/1988\n\nin favour of the defendant No.1. The plaintiffs have no legal\n\nright to claim any share in the suit schedule properties.\n\n 21. It is pertinent to note that in this suit one\n\nMunireddy S/o Dodda Abbaiah Reddy as power of attorney\n\nholder of the plaintiffs filed his affidavit in lieu of\n\nexamination-in-chief of PW1 wherein he has reiterated the\n\naverments made in the plaint and got marked Ex.P.1 to P.73.\n\nThe plaintiffs have not produced the power of attorney\n\nexecuted by them in favour of the said Munireddy S/o Dodda\n\nAbbaiah Reddy. Hence, the oral evidence of the PW1 and\n\nEx.P.1 to P.73 and also the oral evidence of PW 2 & 3 cannot\n\nbe taken into consideration. So, it has to be held that there\n\nis no oral evidence and documents exhibited on behalf of the\n\nplaintiffs. During the pendency of the suit, the defendant\n\nNo.1 is dead and his legal representatives were brought on\n\nrecord and the power of attorney holder of them is examined\n\nas DW1 and got marked Ex.D.1 to D.3. The General Power of\n\nAttorney holder of defendant No.2 examined as DW2 and got\n\n 34 OS No.5985/1988\n\nmarked Ex.D.4 to D.12. The defendant No.6 examined himself\n\nas DW3 and got marked documents at Ex.D.15 to D.24.\n\nSince this is a suit for partition hence every plaintiff is a\n\ndefendant and every defendant is a plaintiff and in the\n\ncircumstances of the case suit has to be decided by\n\nconsidering the plaint and evidence led by the defendants\n\nand documents exhibited by them on their behalf.\n\n 22. As stated above, it is the case of the defendant\n\nNo.1 that the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah\n\nabout 45 years back and openly living with one\n\nKadubisanahalli Narayana Reddy for few years as his\n\nmistress and after some time she left him. As stated above the\n\nsaid Dodda Abbaiah and the Defendant no. 1 are permanent\n\nresidents of Belladuru Village. The defendant No.1 has not\n\nplaced any independent evidence on record from Bellandur\n\nVillage or Kadubisanahalli village except the say of the DW1\n\nthat the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah and\n\nopenly living with one Narayana Reddy of Kadubisanahalli.\n\n 35 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 23. The DW1 during the course of cross-examination\n\ndeposed as under:\n\n \"It is not correct to suggest that Dodda\n Abbaiah and Chikka Abbaiah used to\n harass 1st plaintiff and on account of it quite\n often she used to go to her parents house at\n Govindachetty Palya and also that on those\n occasions Dodda Abbaiah used to go to\n Govindachetty Palya to console his wife.\n This state of things continued to be there till\n the demise of Dodda Abbaiah.\"\n\n 24. So, from the above answer of DW1 during the\n\ncourse of cross-examination taken together it can be said that\n\nthe plaintiff No.1 used to go to his parents house, which is in\n\nGovindachetty Palya for some reason or the other and the\n\nsaid Dodda Abbaiah used to go to Govindachetty Palya to\n\nconsole her and thereby there was access in between the\n\nDodda Abbaiah and plaintiff No.1 and the same state of\n\nthings continued till the death of Dodda Abbaiah. Hence, it\n\ncannot be said that the 1st plaintiff deserted her husband and\n\n 36 OS No.5985/1988\n\nwalked out of his life more than 45 years ago. If it is taken for\n\nthe arguments sake that the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said\n\nDodda Abbaiah she will not loose or right to succeed to the\n\nestate of the said Dodda Abbaiah and hence it cannot said\n\nthat she is not entitled for share in the suit schedule\n\nproperty.\n\n 25. The \nsection 112\n of Indian Evidence Act reads thus:\n\n Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of\n legitimacy- The fact that any person was\n born during the continuance of valid\n marriage between his mother and any\n man, or within two hundred and eighty\n days after is dissolution, the mother\n remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive\n proof that he is the legitimate son of that\n man, unless it can be shown that the\n parties to the marriage had no access to\n each other at any time when he could have\n been begotten.\n\n 37 OS No.5985/1988\n\nSo, as per \nsection 112\n of Indian Evidence Act it has to be\n\npresumed that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 born to the plaintiff\n\nNo.1 & the said Dodda Abbaiah during the continuance of\n\ntheir valid marriage.\n\n 26. The defendant No.1 made half hearted attempt\n\ndisputing that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the daughters\n\nof plaintiff No.1 and Dodda Abbaiah by denying and at the\n\nsame time stating in the written statement as under:-\n\n \"The Late Dodda Abbaiah did not have any\n issue either from first plaintiff or his second\n wife. That being the real position the\n allegation that the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs are\n the daughters of Late Dodda Abbaiah is\n hereby emphatically denied. ..................\n Till today this defendant does not know when\n and where the second and third plaintiffs\n were born to the first plaintiff.\"\n\nSo, the above averments are taken together it is clear that\n\nthe defendant No.1 do not dispute that the plaintiffs No.2 & 3\n\nwere born to the plaintiff No.1. Further, it is not the case of\n\n 38 OS No.5985/1988\n\nthe defendant No.1 that there was divorce in between plaintiff\n\nNo.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah. So, there was divorce in\n\nbetween the plaintiff No.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah. As\n\nper \nsection 112\n of Indian Evidence Act the birth of any person\n\nduring the continuance of valid marriage it is to be\n\npresumed that the persons born during that period are the\n\nlegitimate children.\n\n 27. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff\n\nrelied on the ruling reported in (2009) 12 Supreme Court\n\nCases 454 (Sham Lal @ Kuldip V/s Sanjeev Kumar and\n\nothers), wherein their lordship held as under:\n\n \"\nEvidence Act, 1872\n - Schedule .112 and 4 -\n Legitimacy of child - Conclusive proof -\n Parents of child having access to each other\n\n - Allegation of adultery against wife - Effect\n\n - Once the validity of marriage is proved and\n parents have access to each other, adultery\n of wife which though amounts to very strong\n evidence, is, by itself held, not quite\n sufficient to repel the presumption of\n\n 39 OS No.5985/1988\n\n legitimacy of children born from such\n wedlock - It is undesirable to enquire into\n paternity of a child in such cases.\n Once the validity of marriage is proved\n then there is strong presumption about the\n legitimacy of children born from that\n wedlock. The presumption can only be\n rebutted by a strong, clear, satisfying and\n conclusive evidence. The circumstance\n creating doubt. Even the evidence of\n adultery by wife which though amounts to\n very strong evidence, it by, itself, is not quite\n sufficient to repel this presumption and will\n not justify finding of illegitimacy if husband\n has had access. In the instant case,\n admittedly the plaintiff and defendant No.4\n were born to D during the continuance of her\n valid marriage with B. Their marriage was\n in fact never dissolved. There is no evidence\n on record that B at any point of time did not\n have access to D.\"\n\n 28. The Learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff\n\nfurther relied on the ruling reported in AIR 1969 Bombay\n\n 40 OS No.5985/1988\n\n205 (V 56 C 34) Rama Ananda Patil V/s Appa Bhima Redekar\n\nand others), wherein their lordships held as under:\n\n \"D)\nHindu Succession Act\n (1956), \nSection\n 15(2)(b)\n and S.\n3(1)(j)\n, Proviso - 'Son or\n daughter in\n S.15(2)(b)\n - Means son or\n daughter of female dying intestate\n irrespective of whether they were born to her\n from one or other husband - Related -\n\n Definition includes even illegitimate children.\n\n The words 'son or daughter' of the\n deceased in\n S.15(2)(b)\n of the Act can only\n mean a son or daughter of the female dying\n intestate without regard as to from which\n husband they were born to her. This\n interpretation is reinforced by the definition\n of the word 'related' in Schedule.3(1(j) of the\n Act. Under the proviso to this definition even\n illegitimate children are to be deemed to be\n 'related' to their mother and to one another\n for the purposes of the Act. Effect of this\n definition is that the phraseology 'son or\n daughter of the deceased' is to be construed\n to mean not only the sons and daughters of\n the female Hindu from any of her husbands,\n\n 41 OS No.5985/1988\n\n but even son or daughters born to her in an\n illegitimate manner. If, therefore, by virtue\n of this definition, illegitimate son or\n illegitimate daughter is to be included in the\n phraseology of 'son or daughter of the\n deceased' in \nSection 15(2)(b)\n there is no\n warrant to assume that the Legislature\n intended to exclude the son or daughter of\n the deceased female Hindu, from inheritance\n born to her from any other husband than the\n husband from whom the female Hindu had\n inherited the property.\"\n\n 29. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff\n\nfurther relied on ruling reported in 1971 Punjab and Haryana\n\n240 (Gurbachan Singh V/s Khichar Singh and another),\n\nwherein their lordship held as under:-\n\n \"5. Mr. C. L. Aggarwal, learned counsel for\n the appellants, concedes that Smt. Sant\n Kaur, whatever might have been her\n limitations earlier with regard to her titled to\n the property, became full owner on the\n coming into force of the Act, and succession\n\n 42 OS No.5985/1988\n\nto her estate is regulated by clause firstly of\n\nS. 15(1)(a)\n which is in the following terms:-\n\n\"15. (1) The property of a female Hindu\ndying intestate shall devolve according to\nthe rules set out in\n S. 16\n.\n\n(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters\n(including the children of any pre-deceased\nson or daughter) and the husband.\"\n\nThe only argument raised by the learned\ncounsel is the plaintiff could not be treated to\nbe the son of Smt. Sant Kaur as the latter\ninherited property from her husband Mehar\nSingh and the plaintiff was not born from his\nloins. According to the learned counsel the\nplaintiff would be deemed to be a step-son of\nSmt. Sant Kaur qua the property of Mehar\nSingh her first husband. \nIn order to support\nhis submission, he has invited my attention\nto a Division Bench judgment of the Mysore\nHigh Court reported as \nMallappa Fakirappa\nv. Shivappa\n. AIR 1962 Mys 140, where it is\nheld that the expression \"son\" in Section\n\n 43 OS No.5985/1988\n\n15(1)(a) cannot be construed so as to include\na step-son of the deceased.\n\nI am afraid the argument of the learned\ncounsel is without any substance. There can\nbe no manner of doubt that the plaintiff born\nout of the body of Smt. Sant Kaur is her son\nwhatever his status qua Mehar Singh\ndeceased might be though such status is\nwholly irrelevant. It is not the estate of\nMehar Singh that is involved but that of Smt.\nSant Kaur who was an absolute owner of\nthe suit property at the time of her death.\nThe plaintiff is here son and it is immaterial\nfrom whose loins he might have been born. It\nis again fallacious to say that the plaintiff\ncould be described as the step-son of Smt.\nSmt Kaur or her Pichhlag.\n\nIn \nMallappa\n's case, AIR 1962 Mys 140\n(supra), the contest was between two sons\nfrom different wives of one Fakirappa and in\nthat case one could be said to be the step-\nson of another. That case is therefore, of no\nassistance. The expression \"son\" as used in\n\n 44 OS No.5985/1988\n\nSection 15(1)(a)\n included both natural and\n adopted sons. If a female remarries after the\n death of her first husband or after divorce,\n her son from the other husband would be\n her natural son. A son may even be\n illegitimate when the female from whose\n body he is born is not the lawfully wedded\n wife of the person from whose loins such a\n sons is born but he will still be natural son of\n his mother when the question of succession\n on her dying intestate arises. In the matter\n of succession as regulated by clause firstly\n of \nSection 15(1)(a)\n, the expression \"son\" thus\n includes the child born from body of the\n deceased no matter what be the legal\n relationship between her and the person\n from whose loins he is born.\"\n\n 30. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff\n\nfurther relied on ruling reported in AIR 1975 MADRAS 275\n\n(Narayani Ammal and another V/s Govindaswami Naidu),\n\nwherein their lordships held as under:\n\n 45 OS No.5985/1988\n\n\"(A) Hindu Law - Succession - Stridhana -\n\nTerm \"daughter\" includes an illegitimate\ndaughter - Legitimate son cannot exclude\nan illegitimate daughter. AIR 1915 Mad 63,\nOverruled - \n(Hindu Succession Act\n (1956),\n\nS.3 (j)\n).\n\n The textual Hindu Law as well as decided\ncases have clearly laid down that\nsuccession to stridhana property is quite\ndifferent and distinct from succession to\nthe property of a male Hindu and the\ndifference in the lines of succession is\nbased on different theories or concepts.\nSuccession to stridhana property is based\non the blood relationship of the mother to\nher stridhana heirs. There is no legitimate\nreason why the term 'daughter' should be\nconfined only to a legitimate daughter.\n\nThus an illegitimate child must be\nrecognized as an heir and the stridhana line\nof succession cannot be entirely departed\nfrom with a view to favour the son\nexclusively. It is only when the stridhana\nline of succession is unavailable that it is\n\n 46 OS No.5985/1988\n\n permissible to the other line of succession.\n AIR 1915 Mad 63, Overruled\".\n\nSo, relying on the principles held in the above citations relied\n\nby the plaintiff's counsel when the marriage of plaintiff No.1\n\nand Dodda Abbaiah is admitted and there was access in\n\nbetween them and the same was continued till the death of\n\nDodda Abbaiah and absolutely there is no evidence to show\n\nthat the plaintiff No.1 was living with Narayana Reddy of\n\nKadubisanahalli Village and there is no divorce in between\n\nthe plaintiff No.1 and Dodda Abbaiah and the defendant No.1\n\nnot at all disputed that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the\n\nchildren of plaintiff No.1 and hence it has to be held that the\n\nplaintiffs No.2 and 3 are the legitimate children of plaintiff\n\nNo.1 and Dodda Abbaiah and they are entitle to succeed to\n\nthe estate of the said Dodda Abbaiah.\n\n 31. As stated above, with respect to the suit schedule\n\nproperties are concerned at the first instance the defendant\n\nNo.1 contended that the suit schedule properties are absolute\n\n 47 OS No.5985/1988\n\nproperties of him and in which the said Dodda Abbaiah had\n\nno right, title or interest. The defendant No.1 has not\n\nexplained how he became the absolute owner of the suit\n\nschedule properties. It is came in the cross-examination of\n\nDW1 that the said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1 were\n\nnot having any other properties other than the properties\n\nmentioned in the plaint and out of the said income house\n\nwas improved and defendant No.1 had not given any separate\n\nshare to the said Dodda Abbaiah. This clearly goes to show\n\nthat all the items of the suit schedule properties are the joint\n\nfamily properties of said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1,\n\nsome are ancestral properties and some are acquired from the\n\nincome of the ancestral property. Hence, it cannot be said\n\nthat the defendant No.1 is the absolute owner of the suit\n\nschedule properties.\n\n 32. As stated above, with respect to the item Nos.2\n\nand 4 to 7 of the suit schedule property are concerned the\n\ndefendant No.1 contended that the item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 are\n\n 48 OS No.5985/1988\n\nthe ancestral properties and the said Dodda Abbaiah after the\n\ndeath of his 2nd wife he has relinquished his share in item\n\nNos.2, 4 to 7 of the suit schedule property in favour of him\n\nand left the village. A right in the immovable properties can\n\nbe released/relinquished under the registered document.\n\nHence the relinquishment of the right by the said Dodda\n\nAbbaiah must be through the registered document. The\n\ndefendant No.1 has not produced any such document to the\n\ncourt. Hence, it cannot be said that the said Dodda Abbaiah\n\nrelinquished his share in item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 of the suit\n\nschedule properties about 30 years ago.\n\n 33. As stated above, with respect to the item Nos.1 &\n\n3 concerned the defendant No.1 contended that the item\n\nNos.1 and 3 are the self acquired properties of him. In this\n\nregard the Learned Advocate for the Defendant No.1 relied\n\nruling reported in AIR 2003 SUPREME COURT 3800\n\n(D.S.Lakshmaiah and another V/s L.Balasubramanyam and\n\nanother), wherein their lordship held as under:\n\n 49 OS No.5985/1988\n\n \"There is no presumption of a property being\n joint family property only on account of\n existence of a joint Hindu family. The one\n who asserts has to prove that the property is\n a joint family property. If, however, the\n person so asserting proves that there was\n nucleus with which the joint family property\n could be acquired, there would be\n presumption of the property, being joint and\n the onus would shift on the person who\n claims it to be self acquired property to prove\n that he purchased the property with his own\n funds and not out of joint family nucleus that\n was available.\".\n\nSo, as held in the said ruling since the defendant No.1\n\nadmits that the item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 are the ancestral and\n\njoint family properties of him and Dodda Abbaiah, then there\n\nis no burden on the plaintiffs to prove that they are the joint\n\nfamily properties and on the other hand the burden is on the\n\ndefendant No.1 to prove that item Nos.1 & 3 are the self\n\nacquired properties of him. Except contending that out of his\n\nown funds purchased item No.1 and also constructed house\n\n 50 OS No.5985/1988\n\nin it and purchased the item No.3 out of his own funds, he\n\nhas not explained out of the income of which property he has\n\npurchased the item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule\n\nproperties. The DW1 during the course of cross-examination\n\nadmitted that the income of item Nos.2, 4 to 7 was used to\n\npurchase item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule properties\n\nand out of the said income the house was improved. Hence,\n\nit cannot be said that the item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit\n\nschedule properties are the self acquired properties of\n\ndefendant No.1.\n\n 34. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff relied on\n\nthe ruling reported in 2015(3) Kar.L.J. 357(Smt. Nanjamma\n\nV/s Smt. Akkayamma( since dead) by her LRs and others is\n\nas follows:-\n\n \"In the case of a property belonging to co-\n parcenary, joint family of or co-ownership,\n possession of one co-parcener or a member\n of the joint family or a co-owner is the\n possession of all. To hold that the plaintiff is\n\n 51 OS No.5985/1988\n\n in joint possession of the whole or part of the\n property, which is the subject matter of the\n suit. Even the plaintiff need not be getting a\n share in the income from the property. So\n long as the plaintiff has a right to share, the\n law presumes that he is in joint possession\"\n\nSo, as held in the above ruling both Dodda Abbaiah and\n\ndefendant No.1 were the co-parceners and the said Dodda\n\nAbbaiah died on 28.6.1987 and the plaintiff No.1 being the\n\nwife and plaintiffs No.2 and 3 being the children of Dodda\n\nAbbaiah and hence it must be deemed to be in joint\n\npossession of the suit schedule properties by the plaintiffs\n\nand defendant No.1.\n\n 35. The Learned Advocate appearing for the\n\ndefendant No.1 relied on the ruling reported in AIR 1999\n\nSUPREME COURT 1441 (Vidhyadhar V/s Mankikrao and\n\nanother), wherein their lordship held as under:\n\n \"\nA) Evidence Act\n: \nS.114\n - Adverse inference\n\n - Party to suit - Not entering the witness box\n\n 52 OS No.5985/1988\n\n- Give rise to inference adverse against him.\n\nWhere a party to the suit does not appear\ninto the witness box and states his own case\non oath and does not offer himself to be\ncross examined by the other side, a\npresumption would arise that the case set\nup by him is not correct. In the instant case\ndefendant No.1 alleged that the sale deed\nexecuted by defendant No.2 in favour of the\nplaintiff was fictitious and the whole\ntransaction was a bogus transactions as\nonly Rs.500/- were paid as sale\nconsideration to defendant No.2. But this\nplea was not supported by defendant No.1\nas he did not enter into the witness box. He\ndid not state the facts pleaded in the written\nstatement on oath in the trial court and\navoided the witness box so that he may not\nbe cross-examined. This, by itself, is enough\nto reject the claim that the transaction of sale\nbetween defendant No.2 and the plaintiff\nwas a bogus transaction.\"\n\n 53 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 36. The Learned Advocate appearing for the defendant\n\nNo. 1 relied on the ruling reported in 2005(2) KCCR 831\n\n(Janakibai and another V/s Shyamasundar Rander), wherein\n\ntheir lordship held as under:\n\n \"EVIDENCE ACT, 1872 - \nSection 101\n -\n Burden of proof - Unless the plaintiff lays\n some semblance of evidence, it is not\n necessary for defendant to rebut. When\n both the parties have placed all the available\n evidence in their reach, the question of\n burden of proof does not arise. However, the\n plaintiff, without proving his case, cannot\n solely rely upon the lapse of non-production\n of evidence by the defendant and argue that\n adverse inference must be drawn against\n the defendant for non-production of the\n document.\n\n In the present case, the\n plaintiff/respondent had filed a suit for\n specific performance of oral agreement by\n the 1st defendant for the sale of two plots. In\n the joint written statement, the oral\n agreement for sale was admitted but the\n receipt of entire sale consideration was\n\n 54 OS No.5985/1988\n\n denied. Held, the Trial Court had grossly\n misread the facts and evidence while coming\n to a wrong conclusion that the plaintiff had\n paid the entire sale consideration. The relief\n should not have been granted on mere\n technical assumption of burden of proof.\"\n\n 37. I have gone through the above said rulings relied\n\nby the defendant No.1's counsel. The first ruling is pertaining\n\nto the suit filed for relief of redemption of mortgage by\n\nconditional sale or in the alternative for specific performance\n\nof contract and the second ruling is pertaining to suit for\n\nSpecific performance of oral agreement. The case on hand is\n\nsuit for partition. As stated above in a suit for partition every\n\nplaintiff is a defendant and every defendant is a plaintiff.\n\nThough the evidence of PW1 and exhibits marked on behalf of\n\nthe plaintiffs cannot be considered in the absence not\n\nproducing General Power of Attorney by the plaintiffs\n\nexecuted in favour PW1 but in view of the reasons stated\n\n 55 OS No.5985/1988\n\nabove and in the facts and circumstances of the case I am of\n\nthe opinion that they are not applicable to the case on hand.\n\n 38. So, from the discussions made above, I am of the\n\nopinion that the plaintiffs proved that the suit schedule\n\nproperties are the ancestral and joint family properties of\n\nDodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1 and they are in joint\n\npossession of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1 and the said\n\nDodda Abbaiah died in the year 1997 leaving behind him the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendant No.1 failed to prove that the\n\nplaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah and walked\n\nout of his life for more than 45 years ago and she is not\n\nentitle for share and item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule\n\nproperties are the self acquired properties of the defendant\n\nNo.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah relinquished his share in\n\nthe ancestral properties i.e. item Nos.2, 4 to 7 about 30 years\n\nago. Hence, Issue Nos.1 and 2 are answered in the\n\naffirmative and Issue No.3 is answered partly in the\n\naffirmative and Issue Nos.5 to 7 in the negative.\n\n 56 OS No.5985/1988\n\n 39. ISSUE NO.8: The defendant No.1 taken contention\n\nthat the suit is not properly valued. The defendant No.1 not\n\nplaced any materials on record in support of his contention.\n\nOn the other hand the valuation slip annexed with the plaint\n\nshows that suit is valued the suit schedule properties for\n\nRs.40,205.50/- and the same has to be accepted in the\n\nabsence of contrary evidence placed by the defendant No.1 on\n\nrecord. So, the plaintiffs valued the suit properly and the\n\ndefendant No.1 failed to prove that suit is not properly valued.\n\nHence, Issue No.8 is answered in the negative.\n\n 40. ISSUE NO.9: The defendant No.1 taken contention\n\nin his written statement that the suit is bad for non-joinder of\n\nnecessary and proper parties as the alienee of item No.6 has\n\nnot been made as a party to the suit. In this regard, the\n\nlearned Advocate for the plaintiffs rightly relied on the ruling\n\nreported in ILR 2012 KAR 4129(SK Lakshminarasappa, since\n\ndeceased by his L/Rs V/s B. Rudraiah and others) wherein it\n\nis held that in a suit for partition at the stage of passing of\n\n 57 OS No.5985/1988\n\npreliminary decree for partition the presence of alinee is not\n\nnecessary. Hence the presence of alinee of item no. 6 is not\n\nnecessary before this court and he is neither necessary nor\n\nproper party to the suit. So issue No.9 is answered in the\n\nnegative.\n\n 41. ADDL. ISSUE NO.1 FRAMED ON 08.09.2000: It\n\nis the case of the 2nd defendant that he is the bonafide\n\npurchaser of item Nos.3 of the suit schedule properties under\n\nthe two registered sale deeds dated 12.2.1996 and 31.1.1996\n\nfor a valuable consideration and at that time the defendant\n\nNo.1 represented him the item No.3 is the ancestral property\n\nof him and the said Dodda Abbaiah and he died issueless and\n\nhe was the sole surviving male successor and after\n\nverification purchased it and he is not aware of any legal\n\nproceedings pending.\n\n 42. The Defendant No.2 has not entered into the\n\nwitness box and thereby failed to prove that he the bonafide\n\n 58 OS No.5985/1988\n\npurchaser of item No. 3 of the suit schedule property. Hence\n\nAdditional Issue No.1 framed on 08.09.2000 is answered in\n\nthe Negative.\n\n 43. ADDL. ISSUE NOs.1 TO 3 FRAMED ON\n\n14.6.2011: It is the case of the plaintiffs that defendants No.1\n\nand 2 have formed sites in suit properties and the lands in\n\nsuit item No.2, 4, 6 and 7 were acquired by the Karnataka\n\nIndustrial Areas Development Board - KIADB Bangalore and\n\nthe same is the part of the subject matter of L.A.C.No.47 of\n\n2007 pending disposal before the City Civil Court, CCH.No.17\n\nand the amount of compensation in respect of the acquired\n\nlands will have to be partitioned amongst the plaintiffs and\n\nthe defendants, who are entitled to share the suit schedule\n\nproperties.\n\n 44. The evidence of DW1 shows that sites have been\n\nformed and there is no dispute with respect to acquiring of\n\nitem Nos.2, 4 and 7 and depositing of compensation amount\n\n 59 OS No.5985/1988\n\nin the court. Hence, these issues have to be considered in the\n\nfinal decree proceedings. So, I answer Addl. Issues No.1 to 3\n\nframed on 14.6.2011 as do not arise for consideration.\n\n 45. ISSUE NO. 4, 10 and 11 : In view of my findings\n\non Issue No. 1 to 3in the affirmative in favour of the\n\nplaintiffs and Issue No. 5 to 7 in the Negative against the\n\nDefendant No. 1 the plaintiffs are jointly entitle for half\n\nshare in all items of suit schedule properties and mesne\n\nprofits from the date of the suit till the delivery of possession\n\nof their respective share in the suit schedule properties.\n\nHence Issue No. 4, 10 to 11 are answered in the affirmative.\n\n 46. ISSUE NO. 12: In the result I proceed to pass the\n\nfollowing :\n\n ORDER\n\n Suit of the plaintiffs is decreed.\n\n 60 OS No.5985/1988\n\n The plaintiffs are jointly entitled for half\n\n share in the item Nos.1 to 7 of the suit\n\n schedule property.\n\n The plaintiffs are entitled for mesne\n\n profits from the date of the suit till the\n\n delivery of possession of their respective share\n\n in the suit schedule property.\n\n There shall be separate enquiry under\n\n \nOrder 20 Rule 12 of CPC\n with respect to the\n\n mesne profits.\n\n In view of the relationship between the\n\n parties no order as to costs.\n\n Draw preliminary decree accordingly.\n\n(Dictated to the judgment writer directly on computer,\nthereafter corrected and then pronounced by me in the\nopen court, on this the 16th day of December 2017).\n\n ( BASAVARAJ )\n XLI ADDL.CITY CIVIL JUDGE\n BANGALORE\n\n 61 OS No.5985/1988\n\n ANNEXURE\n\nI.
