Radha Krishna, learned counsel for the appellant\n\n- plaintiff and Mr. M.V. Durga Prasad, learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent - defendant.\n\n 2. This appeal is preferred under Section - 96 read with Order -\n\nXLI, Rule - 1 \nof CPC\n assailing the order dated 09.08.2023 in I.A.\n\nNo.663 of 2023 in O.S. No.38 of 2023 passed by learned VI\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Rangareddy District at\n\nKukatpally.\n\n 3. The facts which are not in dispute are as follows:\n\n i) The appellant herein is the plaintiff and the respondent herein\n\nis the defendant in O.S. No.38 of 2023.\n\n ii) The appellant filed a suit in O.S. No.38 of 2023 against the\n\nrespondent for specific performance of agreement of sale dated\n\n03.1.2020 in respect of suit schedule property i.e., Flat No.1402,\n\nadmeasuring 2838 square feet in 14th Floor, F-Block, Sale Area which\n\ncomprises of 1988 square feet of Carpet Area exclusive balcony area\n\nadmeasuring 191 square feet and proportionate common area\n\nadmeasuring 656 square feet along with allotment of three Car\n\n 3\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nParking spaces in basement and undivided 76 square yards of land out\n\nof 58585 square yards in Survey No.5, situated at Kondapur Village,\n\nSerlingampally Mandal, Rangareddy District.\n\n iii) In the said suit, the respondent - defendant filed an\n\napplication under Order - VII, Rule 11 (a) \nof CPC\n to reject the plaint\n\non the following grounds:\n\n (a) The appellant through her father approached the respondent's\n\n father, GPA Holder, to cancel the agreement of sale dated\n\n 03.11.2020 for sale of suit schedule flat and sought for refund of\n\n entire amount paid by her enabling her to purchase the bigger\n\n size of flat which belongs to the father of the respondent.\n\n (b) After several negotiations, the father of the respondent agreed to\n\n cancel the said agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 and\n\n accordingly entire advance sale consideration paid by the\n\n appellant was returned through RTGS on 02.03.2022 and\n\n 06.04.2022.\n\n (c) The father of the respondent also addressed a letter on\n\n 12.04.2022 to the appellant intimating about cancellation of said\n\n agreement and return of sale consideration amount and also the\n\n original agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020. The said letter was\n\n 4\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n handed over to the father of the appellant when he visited to the\n\n office of the father of respondent, but the said original agreement\n\n was not returned.\n\n (d) The father of respondent informed the respondent that he had\n\n cancelled the subject agreement of sale with the appellant and he\n\n had already entered into another agreement of sale on 25.11.2021\n\n and the appellant utilized the repaid amount towards advance for\n\n fresh agreement of sale dated 25.11.2021.\n\n (e) Thus, there is no subsisting cause of action between the parties.\n\n (f) The averments of entire plaint do not disclose any cause of action\n\n for the appellant.\n\n (g) There is no evidence to establish compliance of Section - 16 (c)\n\n of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n.\n\n iv) The appellant - plaintiff opposed the said application\n\ncontending as follows:\n\n (a) The respondent - defendant failed to make out any ground for\n\n rejection of plaint.\n\n (b) The petition filed by the defendant is an abuse of process of the\n\n Court, vexatious, to prolong the hearing.\n\n 5\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n (c) She denied about her father approaching the father of defendant\n\n to cancel the agreement dated 03.11.2022 and refund of amount\n\n etc.\n\n (d) She also denied about cancellation of agreement of sale dated\n\n 03.11.2022 and refund of amount.\n\n (e) The amounts paid under the subject agreement and the amounts\n\n paid under another agreement dated 25.11.2021 are different\n\n and they are no way concerned with each other.\n\n (f) There is cause of action in the plaint.\n\n (g) Non-issuance of notice cannot be a ground for rejection of\n\n plaint.\n\n v) Vide the aforesaid order dated 09.08.2023, learned trial\n\nCourt allowed the said application holding that:\n\n (a) Admittedly the defendant returned the advance and part sale\n\n consideration amount paid by the plaintiff i.e., Rs.1,55,00,000/-\n\n to the plaintiff through RTGS on 02.03.2022 and 06.04.2022.\n\n (b) Though the appellant contended that the agreement of sale was in\n\n subsistence, there is no cause of action as to why the defendant\n\n refunded the advance sale consideration of Rs.1,55,00,000/-.\n\n 6\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n(c) In the plaint, the appellant has not clearly mentioned the reason\n\n as to why advance sale consideration was refunded, and it is only\n\n averred that the defendant proposed to return the advance sale\n\n consideration amount, stating that as there was delay in execution\n\n of sale deed and asked the plaintiff to enjoy the benefit of the\n\n advance sale consideration, which contention is not believable.\n\n(d) As the defendant has refunded the advance sale consideration to\n\n the plaintiff by 06.04.2022, there was no subsisting contract\n\n between the parties after the said date.\n\n(e) Though the plaintiff contended that she waited for the defendant\n\n to approach her for execution of sale deed, there is no oral or\n\n written agreement between them extending time or executing a\n\n fresh agreement of sale for purchase of suit schedule property.\n\n(f) Even in the plaint, plaintiff mentioned that as informed by the\n\n defendant, the suit agreement of sale was presumed to be\n\n `terminated; the plaintiff has not issued any notice to the\n\n defendant prior to filing of the suit.\n\n 7\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n \n(g) The trial Court also placed reliance on the principle laid down by\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nChennadi Jalapathi Reddy v.\n\n Baddam Pratapa Reddy\n 1.\n\n 4. Challenging the said order, the appellant - plaintiff preferred\n\nthe present appeal.\n\n 5. Both learned counsel for the appellant and respondent made\n\ntheir submissions extensively.\n\n \ni. Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the\n\n principle \nlaid down in\n Syed Dastagir v. T.R. Gopalakrishna\n\n Setty 2; \nHari Shanker Jain v. Sonia Gandhi\n 3; Church of\n\n Christ Charitable Trust and Educational Charitable\n\n Society, rep.by its \nChairman v. Ponniamman Educational\n\n Trust\n, rep.by its Chairperson/Managing Trustee4; \nDahiben\n\n v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali (Gajra\n), dead through\n\n legal representatives 5; E. Anantha Padmanabha Reddy v.\n\n1\n\n . (2019) 14 SCC 220\n\n2\n\n . (1999) 6 SCC 337\n\n3\n\n . (2001) 8 SCC 233\n\n4\n\n . (2012) 8 SCC 706\n\n5\n\n .\n (2020) 7 SCC 366\n\n 8\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n Chadalavada Srinivasa Rao6 and Pulipati Naga Venkata\n\n Krishna Rao v. Shafathunnisa 7.\n\n \nii. Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance on the\n\n principle laid down in \nBhargavi Constructions v. Kothakapu\n\n Muthyam Reddy\n 8; \nMohinder Kaur v. Sant Paul Singh9\n;\n\n \nSangita Sinha v. Bhawana Bhardwaj10\n and \nR. Kandasamy\n\n (since died) v. T.R.K. Sarawathy\n 11.\n\n 6. As discussed above, the appellant - plaintiff had filed the\n\naforesaid suit for specific performance of agreement of sale dated\n\n03.11.2020. The respondent - defendant had filed an application\n\nunder Order - VII, Rule - 11 (a) \nof CPC\n, to reject the plaint on the\n\naforesaid grounds. The same was allowed by the trial Court.\n\nChallenging the same, the appellant - plaintiff preferred the present\n\nappeal.\n\n 7. In the light of the above, it is apt to note that Order - VII,\n\nRule - 11 \nof CPC\n deals with 'rejection of plaint'. The same is relevant\n\nand extracted as under:\n\n6\n\n . 2019 (2) ALD 85 (DB)\n\n7\n\n . 2025 SCC OnLine AP 2785\n\n8\n\n . (2018) 13 SCC 480\n\n9\n\n .

Rejection of plaint.-- The plaint shall be\nrejected in the following cases:--\n\n (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;\n\n (b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and\n the plaintiff, on being required by the Court\n to correct the valuation within a time to be\n fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n\n (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued,\n but the plaint is returned upon paper\n insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on\n being required by the Court to supply the\n requisite stamp-paper within a time to be\n fixed by the Court, fails to do so;\n\n (d) where the suit appears from the statement in\n the plaint to be barred by any law;\n\n (e) where it is not filed in duplicate;\n\n (f) where the plaintiff fails to comply with the\n provisions of rule 9:\n\n Provided that the time fixed by the Court for\nthe correction of the valuation or supplying of the\nrequisite stamp-paper shall not be extended unless\nthe Court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied\nthat the plaintiff was prevented by any cause of an\nexceptional nature from correcting the valuation or\nsupplying the requisite stamp-paper, as the case\nmay be, within the time fixed by the Court and that\nrefusal to extend such time would cause grave\ninjustice to the plaintiff.\"\n\n 10\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n 8. In Dahiben5, the Apex Court considered the scope and ambit\n\nof Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n and held as under:\n\n \"23.2. The remedy under Order 7 Rule 11 is an\n independent and special remedy, wherein the court\n is empowered to summarily dismiss a suit at the\n threshold, without proceeding to record evidence,\n and conducting a trial, on the basis of the evidence\n adduced, if it is satisfied that the action should be\n terminated on any of the grounds contained in this\n provision.\n\n 23.3. The underlying object of Order 7 Rule 11(a)\n is that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed,\n or the suit is barred by limitation under Rule 11(d),\n the court would not permit the plaintiff to\n unnecessarily protract the proceedings in the suit.\n In such a case, it would be necessary to put an end\n to the sham litigation, so that further judicial time\n is not wasted.\n\n 23.4. \nIn \nAzhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi\n [1986\n Supp SCC 315.\n Followed in Manvendrasinhji\n Ranjitsinhji Jadeja v. Vijaykunverba, 1998 SCC\n OnLine Guj 281 : (1998) 2 GLH 823] this Court held\n that the whole purpose of conferment of powers\n under this provision is to ensure that a litigation\n which is meaningless, and bound to prove\n abortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial\n\n 11\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n time of the court, in the following words : (SCC p.\n 324, para 12)\n \"12. ... The whole purpose of conferment of\n\n such powers is to ensure that a litigation which is\n meaningless, and bound to prove abortive should\n not be permitted to occupy the time of the court,\n and exercise the mind of the respondent. The\n sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging\n over his head unnecessarily without point or\n purpose. Even in an ordinary civil litigation, the\n court readily exercises the power to reject a\n plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of action.\"\n\n 23.5. The power conferred on the court to\n terminate a civil action is, however, a drastic one,\n and the conditions enumerated in Order 7 Rule 11\n are required to be strictly adhered to.\"\n\n 9. In Hari Shanker Jain3, the Apex Court held that the\n\nexpression \"cause of action\" has been compendiously defined to mean\n\nevery fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if\n\ntraversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of Court.\n\nOmission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause of\n\naction and the statement of claim becomes bad. The function of the\n\nparty is to present as full a picture of the cause of action with such\n\nfurther information in detail as to make the opposite party understand\n\nthe case he will have to meet. Merely quoting the words of the \nsection\n\n 12\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nlike chanting of a mantra does not amount to stating material facts.\n\nMaterial facts would include positive statement of facts as also\n\npositive averment of a negative fact, if necessary. Failure to plead\n\n\"material facts\" is fatal to the election petition and no amendment of\n\nthe pleadings is permissible to introduce such material facts after the\n\ntime-limit prescribed for filing the election petition. It is the duty of\n\nthe Court to examine the petition irrespective of any written statement\n\nor denial and reject the petition if it does not disclose a cause of\n\naction. To enable a Court to reject a plaint on the ground that it does\n\nnot disclose a cause of action, it should look at the plaint and nothing\n\nelse. Courts have always frowned upon vague pleadings which leave\n\na wide scope to adduce any evidence. No amount of evidence can\n\ncure basic defect in the pleadings.\n\n 10. It is apt to note that the said judgment is in respect of an\n\nelection petition and it is on consideration of scope and ambit of\n\nSection - 83 (1) (a) of the \nRepresentation of the People Act, 1951\n.\n\n 11. In Church of Christ Charitable Trust and Educational\n\nCharitable Society4, wherein the date of Agreement of Sale is not\n\nmentioned in the plaint, considering Forms 47 and 48 of Appendix 'A'\n\nof CPC\n, the Apex Court held that failure to mention the date violates\n\n 13\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nthe statutory requirement and if the date is one which attracts the bar\n\nof limitation, the plaint has to conform to Order - VII Rule - 6 and\n\nspecifically plead the ground upon which exemption from limitation is\n\nclaimed. The Apex Court found fault with the pleadings of the plaint\n\nin the said case and held that there was shortfall in the plaint\n\naverments and statutory provisions, namely, Order - VII Rule - 11,\n\nRule - 14 (1) and Rule - 14 (2), Forms 47 and 48 in Appendix A \nof the\n\nCPC\n which are statutory in nature. The Apex Court also held that the\n\nlearned Single Judge of the High Court has correctly concluded that in\n\nthe absence of any cause of action shown as against the first defendant\n\ntherein, the suit cannot be proceeded either for specific performance\n\nor for the recovery of money advanced which according to the\n\nplaintiff was given to the second defendant in the suit and rightly\n\nrejected the plaint as against the first defendant.\n\n 12. Referring to the said judgment, Mr. M. Radha Krishna,\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant, would contend that if clever drafting\n\nhas created an illusion of a cause of action, trial Court can nip it in the\n\nbud at the first hearing by examining the party under Order - X \nCPC\n.\n\n 13. Order - X \nof CPC\n deals with 'examination of parties by the\n\nCourt' and Order - X, Rule - 1 \nof CPC\n. Order - X Rule - 1 \nof CPC\n\n 14\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\ndeals with 'Ascertainment whether allegations in pleadings are\n\nadmitted or denied'. The same is relevant and extracted as under:\n\n \"1. Ascertainment whether allegations in\n pleadings are admitted or denied.- At the first\n hearing of the suit the Court shall ascertain from\n each party or his pleader whether he admits or\n denies such allegations of fact as are made in the\n plaint or written statement (if any) of the opposite\n party, and as are not expressly or by necessary\n implication admitted or denied by the party against\n whom they are made. The Court shall record such\n admissions and denials.\"\n\nThereafter, it is for the trial Court to opt for any one mode of\n\nalternative dispute resolution etc.\n\n 14. In the said judgment, referring to Order - VII, Rules - 11 (a)\n\nand 11 (d), the Apex Court held that the Court has to satisfy that the\n\nplaint discloses a cause of action and does not appear to be barred by\n\nany law. The statutory forms require the date of agreement to be\n\nmentioned to reflect that it does not appear to be barred by limitation.\n\nIn addition to the same, in a suit for specific performance, there should\n\nbe an agreement by the defendant or by a person duly authorised by a\n\npower of attorney executed in his favour by the owner. It was further\n\n 15\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nheld that in the plaint, the plaintiff has to specifically plead the ground\n\nupon which exemption from limitation is claimed.\n\n \n15. In E. Anantha Padmanabha Reddy6, A Division Bench\n\nof High Court of Judicature for the States of Telangana and Andhra\n\nPradesh, considered the non-adherence to the stipulations contained in\n\nForm Nos.47 and 48 of Appendix-A read with Order - VI, Rule - 3 \nof\n\nCPC\n. The Division Bench placed reliance on the principle laid down\n\nin \nOuseph Varghese v. Joseph Aley\n 12, which was cited in \nAbdul\n\nKhader Rowther v. P.K. Sara Bai\n 13, wherein the Apex Court held\n\nthat a suit for specific performance has to conform to the requirements\n\nprescribed in Form Nos.47 and 48 of Appendix-A to \nthe CPC\n and that\n\nit is incumbent upon the plaintiff in a suit for specific performance to\n\nplead that he applied to the defendant specifically to perform the\n\nagreement, but the defendant had not done so in the said case. Placing\n\nreliance on \nthe said judgment\n and also considering the scope of Order\n\n- VI, Rule - 3 \nof CPC\n, the Division Bench held that Order - VI, Rule -\n\n3 \nof CPC\n merely advocates the use of Forms provided in Appendix -\n\nA, \"as nearly as may be\". Paragraph Nos.2 and 3 of Form Nos.47\n\nand 48 are intended to serve two purposes, viz.,(1) to demonstrate that\n\n12\n\n . (1969) 2 SCC 539\n\n13\n\n . (1989) 4 SCC 313\n\n 16\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nthe agreement purchaser was ready and willing to perform his part of\n\nthe obligation; and (2) also to demonstrate that the defendant was\n\neither unwilling to perform his obligation or positively refused to\n\nperform his obligation under the agreement. The averments in\n\nparagraph Nos.2 and 3 of Form Nos.47 & 48 are intended to\n\ndemonstrate (1) the readiness and willingness on the part of the\n\nplaintiff; and (2) the unwillingness or refusal on the part of the\n\ndefendant to perform his obligations. These two paragraphs of Form\n\nNos.47 & 48 are correlatable to \nSection 16 (c)\n of the Specific Relief\n\nAct, 1963 and the Explanation there under. Therefore, the\n\nrequirement under Section - 16 (c) of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n has to be\n\nconsidered. If those requirements are satisfied otherwise than by way\n\nof a parrot like repetition of the contents of Form Nos.47 and 48, then\n\nthere can be no objection on the basis of Form Nos.47 and 48.\n\n 16. In \nthe said judgment\n, the Division Bench also considered\n\nthat the plaintiff therein specifically pleaded that the entire sale\n\nconsideration had been paid by the date of execution of the agreement\n\nof sale, as evidenced by the recitals contained in the agreement of sale,\n\nand that the possession of the property had also been delivered.\n\nTherefore, the only obligation left over, if the case of the plaintiff was\n\n 17\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\ntrue, was the mere execution of a sale deed. There was nothing left\n\nunder the agreement of sale, for the plaintiff to do. Therefore, there is\n\nno use in the plaintiff pleading as an empty formality that he was\n\nalways ready and willing to perform his part of the obligations,\n\nespecially when his part of the obligations already stood performed, at\n\nleast according to him. In \nthe said judgment\n, it was the admitted case\n\nof the agreement vendor himself that on 03.03.2010, he cancelled the\n\nGPA. By the time the suit was filed, agreement vendor had taken a\n\npositive stand that the nature of the transaction as reflected in Ex.A.1\n\nwas not one of sale and purchase of immovable property. Therefore,\n\non consideration of the said fact, the Division Bench held that failure\n\nof the plaintiff therein to incorporate the contents of Form Nos.47 and\n\n48 at least as an empty formality, cannot be put against him.\n\n 17. In Syed Dastagir2, the Apex Court framed the following\n\nissue for consideration:\n\n \"How to construe a plea of 'readiness and\n willingness to perform' to sub-serve to the\n requirement of \nSection 16(c)\n of the Specific Relief\n Act, 1963 and the interpretation of its\n explanation.\"\n\n 18\n\n \nKL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nThe Apex Court held that no specific phraseology or language is\n\nrequired to take such a plea. The language in Section - 16 (c) of the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\n does not require any specific phraseology but only\n\nthat the plaintiff must aver that he has performed or has always been\n\nand is willing to perform his part of the contract. So the compliance\n\nof \"readiness and willingness\" has to be in spirit and substance and\n\nnot in letter and form. So to insist for a mechanical production of the\n\nexact words of a statute is to insist for the form rather than the\n\nessence. So the absence of form cannot dissolve an essence if already\n\npleaded. The Apex Court also relied upon the principle \nlaid down by\n\nit in \nR.C. Chandiok v. Chuni Lal Sabharwal\n 14, wherein it was held\n\nthat readiness and willingness cannot be treated as a strait-jacket\n\nformula. This has to be determined from the entirety of the facts and\n\ncircumstances relevant to the intention and conduct of the party\n\nconcerned. The pleading as made by the plaintiff therein not only\n\nshows his readiness and willingness to perform his part of the\n\nobligation under the contract but by tendering the total amount which\n\nshows he has performed his part of the obligation. On examination of\n\nthe said facts, the Apex Court held that such a plea to be a plea of\n\n14\n\n . (1970) 3 SCC 140\n\n 19\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n\"readiness and willingness\" as required under Section - 16 (c) of the\n\nSpecific Relief Act\n.\n\n 18. In Kamala Kumar v. Premlata Joshi 15 the Apex Court\n\nheld as follows:\n\n \"It is a settled principle of law that the grant of\n relief of specific performance is a discretionary\n and equitable relief. The material questions, which\n are required to be gone into for grant of the relief\n of specific performance, are:\n\n First, whether there exists a valid and concluded\n contract between the parties for sale/purchase of\n the suit property;\n\n Second, whether the plaintiff has been ready and\n willing to perform his part of contract and whether\n he is still ready and willing to perform his part as\n mentioned in the contract;\n\n Third, whether the plaintiff has, in fact,\n performed his part of the contract and, if so, how\n and to what extent and in what manner he has\n performed and whether such performance was in\n conformity with the terms of the contract,|\n Fourth, whether it will be equitable to grant the\n relief of specific performance to the plaintiff\n against the defendant in relation to suit property\n or it will cause any kind of hardship to the\n\n15\n\n . (2019) 3 SCC 704\n\n 20\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n defendant and, if so, how and in what manner and\n the extent if such relief is eventually granted to the\n plaintiff; and\n Lastly, whether the plaintiff is entitled for grant\n of any other alternative relief, namely, refund of\n earnest money etc. and, if so, on what grounds.\"\n\n19. In Ouseph Varghese13, the Apex Court held as under:\n\n \n\"....A suit for specific performance has to conform\n to the requirements prescribed in Forms 47 and 48\n of the 1st Schedule in the Civil Procedure Code. In\n a suit for specific performance it is incumbent on\n the plaintiff not only to set out the agreement on\n the basis of which he sues in all its details, he must\n go further and plead that he has applied to the\n defendant specifically to perform the agreement\n pleaded by him but the defendant has not done so.\n He must further plead that he has been and is still\n ready and willing to specifically perform his part\n of the agreement. Neither in the plaint nor at any\n subsequent stage of the suit the plaintiff has taken\n those pleas. As observed by this Court in \nPrem\n Rai v. D.L.F. Housing and Construction (P)\n Ltd.\n 1968 SCC OnLine SC 151 that it is well\n settled that in a suit for specific performance the\n plaintiff should allege that he is ready and willing\n to perform his part of the contract and in the\n\n 21\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n absence of such an allegation the suit is not\n maintainable.\"\n\n 20. \nIn \nJ.P. Builders v. A. Ramadas Rao\n 16, the Apex Court\n\nheld as under:\n\n \"It is settled law that even in the absence of\n specific plea by the opposite party, it is the\n mandate of the statute that plaintiff has to comply\n with \nSection 16 (c)\n of the Specific Relief Act and\n when there is non- compliance with this statutory\n mandate, the Court is not bound to grant specific\n performance and is left with no other alternative\n but to dismiss the suit. It is also clear that readiness\n to perform must be established throughout the\n relevant points of time. \"Readiness and\n willingness\" to perform the part of the contract has\n to be determined/ascertained from the conduct of\n the parties.\"\n\n 21. In Chennadi Jalapathi Reddy1, the Apex Court held as\n\nunder:\n\n \"Moreover, the High Court has wrongly observed\n that the plaintiff has not produced any evidence to\n prove that he demanded the performance of sale\n after the execution of the agreement of sale. The\n filing of a suit for specific performance of an\n\n16\n\n . (2011) 1 SCC 429\n\n 22\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nagreement of sale is governed by \nSection 16 (c)\n of\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963, read with \nArticle 54\n\nof the \nSchedule of the Limitation Act, 1963\n. In\naddition to this, Forms 47 and 48 \nof the Code of\nCivil Procedure\n, 1908 prescribe the format of the\nplaint for such a suit. Thus, a plaint which seeks\nthe relief of specific performance of an\nagreement/contract must comply with all these\nrequirements. In the matter at hand, the plaintiff\nhas specifically averred in his plaint that he was\nready and willing to perform his part of the\ncontract under the agreement of sale dated\n20.04.1993. It was also specifically stated that the\nplaintiff had been demanding that the first\ndefendant receive the balance consideration of Rs.\n58,800/ and execute a regular registered sale deed\nat his cost, but the first defendant had been\navoiding the specific performance of the\nagreement of sale. In light of this, in our\nconsidered opinion, all the formalities which are to\nbe pleaded and proved by the plaintiff for getting a\ndecree of specific performance have been\nfulfilled. Moreover, there cannot be any proof of\noral demand. Be that as it may, we are satisfied\nfrom the evidence that the plaintiff had sufficient\nmoney to pay the balance consideration to the first\ndefendant and was ready and willing to perform\nhis part of the contract.\"\n\n 23\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n 22. In Bhargavi Constructions8, the Apex Court held that the\n\nterm 'law' used in Order - VII, Rule - 11 (d) \nof CPC\n includes not only\n\nlegislative enactments but also judicial decisions of the Apex Court in\n\nview of \nArticle - 141\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 23. There is no dispute that the law \nlaid down by\n the Apex\n\nCourt is binding on all the Courts including trial Court and this Court\n\nin terms of \nArticle - 141\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 24. In Mohinder Kaur9, the Apex Court held that where the\n\nagreement of sale has been cancelled by Vendor, the party has to seek\n\nrelief of declaration of such cancellation, in addition to seek relief of\n\nspecific performance of such agreement of sale. The said principle\n\nwas also reiterated by the Apex Court in Sangita Sinha10 and R.\n\nKandasamy11.\n\n \n25. Considering the pleadings, in \nManickam v. Vasantha\n 17,\n\nwherein suit was filed for specific performance of agreement of sale,\n\nthe Apex Court held that relief of specific performance of contract is a\n\ndiscretionary relief, and pleadings in a suit for specific performance\n\nhave to be very direct, specific and accurate. A suit for specific\n\n17\n\n . (2022) SCC OnLine SC 2096\n\n 24\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nperformance based on bald and vague pleadings must necessarily be\n\nrejected. Section - 16 (c) of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n requires readiness\n\nand willingness to be pleaded and proved by the plaintiff in a suit for\n\nspecific performance of contract and the same are mandatory.\n\n 26. \nIn \nR. Shama Naik v. G. Srinivasiah18\n, the Apex Court\n\nheld that the plaintiff is obliged not only to make specific statement\n\nand averments in the plaint but is also obliged to adduce necessary\n\noral and documentary evidence to show the availability of funds to\n\nmake payment in terms of the contract in time. There is a fine\n\ndistinction between readiness and willingness to perform the contract.\n\nBoth the ingredients are necessary for the relief of specific\n\nperformance. While readiness means the capacity of the plaintiff to\n\nperform the contract which would include his financial position,\n\nwillingness relates to the conduct of the plaintiff.\n\n \n27. Referring to the principle \nlaid down in\n \nT. Arivandandam\n\nv. T.V. Satyapal\n 19 and other judgments in \nIndian Evangelical\n\nLutheran Church Trust Association v. Sri Bala & Co.20\n, the Apex\n\nCourt held that the Court while dealing with an application filed under\n\n18\n\n . 2024 INSC 927\n\n19\n\n . (1977) 4 SCC 467\n\n20\n\n . 2025 (6) ALD 108 SC\n\n 25\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nOrder - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n, has to consider whole plaint has to be\n\nread and not any particular plea has to be considered. The averments\n\nin the plaint as a whole have to be seen to find out whether Clause -\n\n(d) of Rule - 11, Order - VII \nof CPC\n is applicable. The relevant facts\n\nwhich need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder\n\nare the averments in the plaint which are germane. The pleas taken by\n\nthe defendant either in the affidavit filed in support of an application\n\nfiled under Order - VII, Rule -11 \nof CPC\n or in the written statement\n\nwould be wholly irrelevant at that stage. Under Order - VII, Rule -11\n\nof CPC\n, the Court has to take a decision looking at the pleadings of\n\nthe plaintiff only and not on the rebuttal made by the defendant or any\n\nother material produced by the defendant.\n\n i) \nReferring to the Limitation Act, 1963\n, the Apex \nCourt further\n\nheld\n that \nLimitation Act\n does not confer any substantive right, nor\n\ndefines any right or cause of action. The Law of Limitation is based\n\non delay and laches. Unless there is a complete cause of action,\n\nlimitation cannot run and there cannot be a complete cause of action\n\nunless there is a person who can sue and a person who can be sued.\n\n 28.

As discussed supra, respondent - defendant filed the\n\naforesaid I.A. under Order - VII, Rule -11 \nof CPC\n to reject the plaint\n\ncontending that plaint does not disclose cause of action, the agreement\n\nof sale dated 03.11.2020 is novated and they have entered into an oral\n\nagreement.\n\n 32. In the light of the principle \nlaid down in\n the aforesaid\n\njudgments and provisions, coming to the facts of the present case, it is\n\n 29\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nnot in dispute that the respondent had executed an agreement of sale\n\ndated 03.11.2020 in favour of the appellant - plaintiff in respect of sale\n\nof suit schedule property on the specific terms and conditions\n\nmentioned therein. The total sale consideration agreed was\n\nRs.1,89,55,000/-. The appellant paid an amount of Rs.80.00 lakhs\n\nunder three cheques on the said date of agreement. It is agreed that\n\nthe respondent - vendor shall hand over possession of the Apartment\n\nalong with ready and complete common areas with all specifications,\n\namenities and facilities of the project in place on or before 30.11.2021\n\nsubject to the extension of registration, if any, granted to the said\n\nproject by the Authority, unless there is delay or failure due to war,\n\nflood, drought, fire, cyclone, earthquake or any other calamity caused\n\nby nature or any Court stay or Government order affecting the regular\n\ndevelopment of the real estate project (Force Majeure). The appellant\n\nbeing the Vendee, agreed that in the event it becomes impossible for\n\nthe Promoter/Developer/Vendor to implement the project due to Force\n\nMajeure conditions, then this allotment shall stand terminated and the\n\nPromoter/Developer/Vendor shall refund to the Allottee the entire\n\namount received by the Promoter/Developer/Vendor from the\n\nallotment within 90 days from that date.\n\n 30\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n 33. It is also relevant to note that Clause - 5.5 of the said\n\nAgreement of Sale deals with 'cancellation by Purchaser/Allottee'.\n\nThe same is relevant and it is extracted as under:\n\n \"Cancellation by Purchaser/Allottee: The\n Purchaser shall have the right to cancel/only as\n provided in the Act. Provided that where the\n Purchaser proposes to cancel/withdraw from the\n project without any fault of the /Vendor, the\n /Vendor herein is entitled to forfeit Rs.10,00,000/-\n from the amount paid. The balance amount of\n money paid by the Purchaser shall be returned by\n the Promoter/ Developer/ Vendor to the Purchaser\n within three months of such cancellation or at the\n time that the /Vendor is able to resell the said\n Apartment to another purchaser, whichever is\n later.\"\n\n 34. Perusal of record would also reveal that the appellant herein\n\nhas paid an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- on 16.01.2021, Rs.10,00,000/-\n\non 31.03.2021 and Rs.15,00,000/- on 21.04.2021. Thus, in all, the\n\nappellant had paid an amount of Rs.1,55,00,000/- leaving balance sale\n\nconsideration of Rs.34,55,000/-. According to the appellant, the\n\nrespondent failed to receive balance sale consideration and execute\n\nregister sale deed in her favour. The respondent - defendant returned\n\nthe said sale consideration amount received by her to the appellant -\n\n 31\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nplaintiff on 02.03.2022 and 06.04.2022 by way of RTGS. Therefore,\n\nthe appellant had filed the aforesaid suit for specific performance of\n\nagreement of sale and sought a direction to the respondent - defendant\n\nto execute a register sale deed in favour of the plaintiff or her nominee\n\nby receiving balance sale consideration as per the agreement of sale\n\ndated 03.11.2020 and in default thereof, the Court may execute and\n\nregister a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff or her nominee and also a\n\ndirection to respondent - defendant to deliver vacant physical and\n\npeaceful possession of suit schedule property.\n\n 35. In view of the allegations made by the respondent -\n\ndefendant in the affidavit filed in support of petition vide I.A. No.663\n\nof 2023 under Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n, paragraph Nos.7, 8, 9\n\nand 13 of the plaint are relevant and the same are extracted hereunder:\n\n \"7. The Plaintiff submits that she had also\n purchased a residential Apartment bearing Flat\n No.B 10004, 10th Floor, Block-B, admeasuring\n 4095 sq.ft., along with three car parking's in the\n complex called TRENDSET JAYABHERI\n ELEVATE together with proportionate undivided\n share of land admeasuring 38720 Sq.Yds., in\n Sy.No.5, situated at Kondapur Village,\n Serilingampally Mandal, Ranga Reddy District\n\n 32\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nfrom the father of Defendant herein namely\nDr.K.L.Narayana who is her power of attorney\nalso under an Agreement of Sale Dated 25.11.2021\nwhich is followed by execution of Registered Sale\nDeed Dated 11.04.2022 bearing Document No\n5886/2022. Thus the Plaintiff got great confidence\nin the Defendant to proceed and conclude the\ntransaction liberally without adhering to the\nconditions strictly. The Plaintiff always kept good\nfaith in the family of Defendant and equally she is\nready to pay the balance sale consideration of Rs.\n34,55,000/- towards the Suit Schedule Property. It\nis needless to add that the plaintiff is solvent and\nholding sufficient funds to pay the balance sale\nconsideration thereby to obtain sale deed from the\nDefendant. There is ample evidence to substantiate\nher solvency and financial ability to conclude the\nsale transaction within the Schedule subject to\ncompliance of conditions by the Defendant. The\nDefendant is in obligation to complete the Suit\nSchedule Property in accordance to the\nspecification mentioned in the Agreement of sale\non or before 30.11.2021 along with the amenities\nprescribed. On 30.11.2021 the plaintiff reiterated\nher demand to the defendant for receiving balance\nsale consideration of Rs. 34,55,000/- and to\nexecute Registered Sale Deed while delivering\nphysical possession of Suit Schedule Property.\nUnfortunately the Defendant did not yielded to the\n\n 33\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nrequest of Plaintiff and continued to dodge on one\nor the other pretext and more particularly the Suit\nSchedule Property was still kept Incomplete\nwithout attaining the specifications mentioned in\nthe Agreement of Sale.\n\n8. The Plaintiff submits that the acts of Defendant\nin not honoring Suit Agreement of Sale created\nimpatience to her and therefore she express her\ndiscomfort in the transaction. It is obvious to\nunderstand that the Defendant had already received\nmajor part of sale consideration except the minor\npart of sale consideration which is to be paid at the\ntime of sale transaction. Therefore the Plaintiff\ndemanded the Defendant either to receipt balance\nsale consideration thereby to execute sale deed\nwith possession or to compensate for the delay. In\nsuch circumstances the Defendant assured as she\nwill execute and register the Sale Deed by\nhonoring Agreement of Sale Dated 03.11.2020 in\nfavour of Plaintiff and till such time the defendant\nproposed to return the advance paid amount of\nRs.1,55,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty Five\nLakhs only) to retain the same with the Plaintiff till\nshe gets communication from the Defendant. Thus,\nthe defendant pampered the Plaintiff to enjoy the\nbenefit on advance part of Rs.1,55,00,000/- while\nretuning the same by way of RTGS Dated\n02.03.2022 for an amount of Rs.85,00,000/- and by\n\n 34\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nway of RTGS Dated 06.04.2022 for an amount of\nRs.70,00,000/- to the Plaintiff. Thus the Defendant\nassured the Plaintiff and requested to pay the\ncomplete sale consideration of Rs. 1,89,55,000/-\n(Rupees One Crore Fifty Nine Lakhs Fifty Five\nThousand only) at the time of Registration of Sale\nDeed in compliance to the Suit Agreement of sale\non communication from her. Thus the Plaintiff is\nenjoying the interest on 1,55,00,000/- apart from\nthe keeping ready of balance consideration amount\nof Rs. 34,55,000/- thereby to handover to the\nDefendant on communication to conclude to\ntransaction. It is essential to had that the Defendant\nassured the Plaintiff as the Suit Schedule Property\nwill be completed with all specifications agreed by\nthe end of December 2022 for which the Plaintiff\nis awaiting.\n\n9. The Plaintiff submits that believing the version\nof Defendant waited till the end of December\n2022, more particularly when the representative of\nDefendant and her father had executed sale deed\ndated 11.04.2022 bearing Document No.\n5886/2022 in respect of other purchased residential\napartment No.B1004 in the same project. But\nunfortunately the Defendant did not evinced any\npositive expression to honour the promise at the\nend of December 2022. Therefore on 07.01.2023,\nthe Plaintiff approached the Defendant demanding\n\n 35\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nto execute and register the Sale Deed by honoring\nthe unterminated Agreement of Sale Dated\n03.11.2020 pertaining to Suit Schedule Property.\nThe Defendant instead of honoring Suit Agreement\nof Sale despite the assurance made by her, had\nstarted demanding extra amount over and above\nRs. 1,89,55,000/- to convey the Suit Schedule\nProperty which is unlawful and unethical. The\nDefendant further threatened the Plaintiff as by\nreversing advance paid amount it is to be presumed\nthat the Suit Agreement of Sale is terminated. But\nfact remains that the suit Agreement of Sale Dated\n03.11.2020 was never cancel or terminated and the\nsame is enforceable lawfully. Thus, the attitude of\nDefendant demonstrates her malice intention to\nevade the contractual obligation.\n\n13. The Plaintiff submits that the cause of action\nfor the Suit arose on 03.11.2020 when the\nDefendant executed Agreement of Sale in favour\nof Plaintiff, and on 16.01.2021 when the defendant\nreceived Rs. 50,00,000/- as part of Sale\nconsideration and on 31.03.2021 when the\nDefendant received Rs. 10,00,000/- as part of sale\nconsideration and on 02.03.2022 and 06.4.2022\nwhen the Defendant reversed the advanced paid\nconsideration keeping the Suit Agreement intact\nand without termination promising to receive the\nentire consideration at the time of Registering the\n\n 36\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n sale deed and in the end of December 2022 when\n the Defendant promised to convey the Suit\n Schedule Property and on 07.01.2023 when the\n Plaintiff finally demanded the Defendant for\n honoring the suit transaction which was denied by\n her acts and the same is to be considered as\n declining to honour the contractual obligation and\n hence the suit is well in time and not borrowed by\n the provisions of the \nLimitation Act\n.\"\n\n 36. Thus, the appellant - plaintiff specifically pleaded that she\n\nhad also purchased a residential Apartment bearing Flat No.B 10004,\n\n10th Floor, Block-B, admeasuring 4095 square feet along with three\n\nCar Parking's in the Complex called 'TRENDSET JAYABHERI\n\nELEVATE together with proportionate undivided share of land\n\nadmeasuring 109 square yards out of total extent of 38720 square\n\nyards in Survey No.5, situated at Kondapur Village, Serilingampally\n\nMandal, Rangareddy District from the father of defendant, who is her\n\nPower of Attorney also under an Agreement of Sale dated 25.11.2021,\n\nwhich is followed by execution of registered sale deed dated\n\n11.04.2022 bearing document No.5886 of 2022. Thus, according to\n\nthe appellant, she has reposed confidence on the defendant to proceed\n\n 37\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nand conclude the transaction liberally without adhering to the\n\nconditions strictly.\n\n 37. The plaintiff also specifically pleaded that she is always\n\nkept good faith in the family of the defendant and equally she is ready\n\nto pay balance sale consideration of Rs.34,55,000/- towards suit\n\nschedule property. She has also pleaded that she is solvent and\n\nholding sufficient funds to pay the balance sale consideration. In the\n\nlight of the same, the respondent - defendant cannot contend that the\n\nappellant - plaintiff has not pleaded that she is ready and willing to\n\nperform an obligation casts upon her under the aforesaid agreement of\n\nsale.\n\n 38. It is also apt to note that on receipt of the aforesaid amount\n\nof Rs.1,55,00,000/- from the respondent - defendant, the appellant\n\nherein did not address a letter or make any correspondence as to why\n\nthe respondent - defendant returned the said amount. However, she\n\nhas specifically pleaded in the plaint that the said agreement of sale\n\ndated 03.11.2020 was not cancelled in terms of Clause - 5.5 and that\n\nthe said original agreement of sale is with her. In fact, she has filed\n\n 38\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nthe original agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 in the Court along\n\nwith the plaint.\n\n 39. Therefore, the respondent - defendant cannot contend that\n\nshe has already cancelled the said agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020.\n\nThe respondent also cannot contend that the appellant has purchased\n\nanother Flat No.B 10004 of the very same apartment. As discussed\n\nabove, the appellant - plaintiff has specifically contended in paragraph\n\nNo.7 of the plaint that she has purchased the said Flat from the father\n\nof the defendant and he has already executed a registered sale deed.\n\nTherefore, the aforesaid allegation of the respondent that the\n\nagreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 was cancelled / novated and,\n\nthereafter, there was an oral agreement between the appellant and the\n\nrespondent is without any basis. However, the said aspect cannot be\n\nconsidered in a petition filed under Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n\nwhile rejecting the plaint.\n\n 40. The trial Court has to consider only the contents of the\n\nplaint and documents filed by the plaintiff along with plaint, nothing\n\nmore as held by the Apex Court in Dahiben5. In the present case, the\n\nappellant has specifically pleaded that the agreement of sale dated\n\n 39\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n03.11.2020 is subsisting and it was not cancelled as per Clause - 5.5 of\n\nthe said agreement of sale and that she is in possession of original\n\nagreement of sale with her. Therefore, she has also specifically\n\npleaded with regard to return of advance sale consideration of\n\nRs.1,55,00,000/- paid by her on two occasions by way of RTGS.\n\nTherefore, there is no suppression of fact on the part of the appellant.\n\n 41. With regard to the contention of Mr. M.V. Durga Prasad,\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent that there was no demand from the\n\nappellant to the respondent to pay the balance consideration and\n\nexecute register sale deed in her favour, it is relevant to note that the\n\nappellant has specifically pleaded that the respondent has returned the\n\naforesaid amount of Rs.1,55,00,000/- by way of RTGS without\n\ninforming the appellant and it is unilateral. Therefore, in paragraph\n\nNo.8 of the plaint, she has specifically pleaded that the acts of the\n\ndefendant in not honouring the suit agreement of sale caused\n\nimpatience to her and, therefore, she expressed her discomfort in the\n\ntransaction. It is obvious to understand that the defendant had already\n\nreceived major part of sale consideration except the minor part of sale\n\nconsideration which is to be paid at the time of sale transaction.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff demanded the defendant either to receive the\n\n 40\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nbalance sale consideration and thereby to execute sale deed with\n\npossession or to compensate for the delay. The defendant assured as\n\nshe would execute and register the sale deed by honouring agreement\n\nof sale dated 03.11.2020 in favour of the plaintiff. Thus, the\n\ndefendant allowed the plaintiff to enjoy the benefit on advance part of\n\nRs.1,55,00,000/- while returning the same by way of RTGS dated\n\n02.03.2022 for an amount of Rs.85.00 lakhs and by way of RTGS\n\ndated 06.04.2022 for an amount of Rs.70.00 lakhs to the plaintiff.\n\nThus, the plaintiff is enjoying interest of Rs.1,55,00,000/- apart from\n\nkeeping ready the balance consideration amount of Rs.34,55,000/-.\n\n 42. She has also specifically pleaded that she has waited till\n\nend of December, 2022 and approached the defendant on 07.01.2023\n\nwith a request to execute a register sale deed by honouring\n\nunterminated agreement of sale deed dated 03.11.2020. She has also\n\nspecifically pleaded that instead of honouring suit agreement of sale\n\ndespite assurance made by her, had started demanding extra amount\n\nover and above Rs.1,89,55,000/- to convey the suit schedule property,\n\nwhich is unlawful and unethical. The defendant further threatened the\n\nplaintiff by reversing advance paid amount, it is to be presumed that\n\nthe suit agreement of sale is terminated. But, the fact remains that the\n\n 41\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nsuit agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 was never cancelled or\n\nterminated and the same is enforceable lawfully. Thus, the attitude of\n\ndefendant demonstrates her malice intention to evade the contractual\n\nobligation. Thus, she has specifically pleaded about existence of\n\nagreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 and that it was not cancelled.\n\n 43. It is apt to note that the said aspects are triable issues. The\n\ncontentions of the respondent - defendant that her father addressed a\n\nletter dated 12.04.2022 to the appellant - plaintiff intimating about\n\ncancellation of the agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020, the said letter\n\nwas handed over to the father of the appellant when he visited the\n\noffice of respondent's father is also a triable issue. The further\n\ncontention of the respondent - defendant that the father of the\n\nrespondent informed the respondent that he had cancelled the subject\n\nagreement of sale with the appellant and he had already entered into\n\nanother agreement of sale dated 25.11.2022 etc., are also triable\n\nissues. The same cannot be considered in a petition filed under Order -\n\nVII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n. At the cost of repetition, the Court has to\n\nconsider pleadings of the plaint and documents filed along with the\n\nplaint. The said aspects are not there in the plaint and documents filed\n\n 42\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nalong with the plaint. The respondent herein - defendant asserted the\n\nsaid contentions in the affidavit filed in support of I.A. filed under\n\nOrder - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n. The said aspects cannot be considered\n\nin a petition filed under Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n. Even then,\n\nvide order dated 09.08.2023, learned trial Court held that the stand\n\ntaken by the plaintiff, her contentions are not believable. The said\n\nfinding is not based on pleadings of the plaintiff in the plaint and\n\ncontrary to the documents filed by her along with plaint.\n\n 44. The further finding of trial Court that as the defendant has\n\nrefunded the advance sale consideration to the plaintiff on 06.04.2022\n\nitself, there was no subsisting contract between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendant after the said date is also factually incorrect. The finding of\n\ntrial Court that though the plaintiff contended that she waited for the\n\ndefendant to approach her for execution of sale deed, there is no oral\n\nor written agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant\n\nextending the time or executing a fresh agreement of sale for purchase\n\nof suit schedule property is also contrary to record. The trial Court\n\nerred in holding that even in the plaint, the plaintiff got mentioned that\n\nas informed by the defendant the suit agreement of sale was presumed\n\nto be terminated. The further findings of trial Court that the plaintiff\n\n 43\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nhas not stated the dates on which she allegedly demanded the\n\ndefendant to execute the sale deed and that there is no explanation as\n\nto why the plaintiff kept quiet till February, 2023 without seeking\n\nspecific performance of agreement of sale are contrary to the\n\npleadings of the plaintiff in the plaint and also documents filed by her\n\nalong with plaint. They are beyond the scope of enquiry under Order -\n\nVII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n. Thus, learned trial Court also erred in holding\n\nthat the plaintiff has not issued any notice to the defendant prior to\n\nfiling of the suit.\n\n 45. As discussed above, the plaintiff has specifically contended\n\nthat the respondent - defendant has refunded the said amount received\n\nby her unilaterally and that there was another transaction between the\n\nplaintiff and the father of the defendant, she has approached the\n\ndefendant on 07.01.2023 with a request to receive sale consideration\n\nand execute and register the sale deed in terms of agreement of sale\n\ndated 03.11.2020. The said aspects were not considered by the trial\n\nCourt. It is not a clever drafting as contended by Mr. M.V. Durga\n\nPrasad, learned counsel for the respondent herein. The said aspects\n\ncannot be considered by trial Court while deciding an application filed\n\nunder Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n.\n\n 44\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n 46. However, there is no dispute with regard to object of Order\n\n- VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n that trial Court has to discourage frivolous\n\nlitigation, more particularly suits filed without proper pleadings, cause\n\nof action etc., and on going through the contents of the plaint, the trial\n\nCourt instead of proceeding with trial, can nip the same at the budding\n\nstage. At the same time, when there are specific pleadings and\n\ndocuments filed along with the plaint, the trial Court cannot reject\n\nplaint by invoking its power under Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n.\n\n \n47. It is also contended by Mr. M.V. Durga Prasad, learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent that there is no cause of action in the plaint.\n\nAs discussed above, paragraph No.13 of the plaint deals with cause of\n\naction and plaintiff has specifically pleaded regarding cause of action.\n\nHowever, cause of action is a mixed question of fact and law and in\n\nfact it is a bundle of facts as held by the Apex Court in \nShakti Bhog\n\nFood Industries v. Central Bank of India\n 21. In the present case, the\n\nplaintiff has specifically pleaded cause of action including the\n\naforesaid dates. Therefore, the respondent cannot contend that there is\n\nno cause of action in the plaint. It is a triable issue and, therefore, on\n\nthe said ground, learned trial Court cannot reject the plaint.\n\n21\n\n . (2020) 17 SCC 260\n\n 45\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\n 48. In R. Kandasamy11, Sangita Sinha10 and Mohinder\n\nKaur9 relied upon by learned counsel for the respondent herein -\n\ndefendant, the agreements entered by Vendors therein, were cancelled\n\nin writing and the said cancellation was informed to the Vendees\n\ntherein. Therefore, on consideration of the said facts, the Apex Court\n\nheld that the Vendees therein have to seek declaration instead of suit\n\nfor specific performance of agreement of sale, whereas, in the present\n\ncase, there is no cancellation of agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 by\n\nthe respondent. Therefore, the facts of the said cases are different to\n\nthe facts of the present case.\n\n 49. As discussed above, in the present case, the respondent -\n\ndefendant has not cancelled the agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020,\n\nmore particularly in terms of Clause - 5.5. It is also apt to note that\n\nthe original of agreement of sale dated 03.11.2020 is with the\n\nappellant. She has filed the said original agreement of sale along with\n\nplaint. All the said aspects are triable issues and trial Court has to\n\nconsider the same during the course of trial, but not in an application\n\nfiled under Order - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n. The scope of inquiry under\n\nOrder - VII, Rule - 11 \nof CPC\n is very limited. The trial Court has to\n\nconsider pleadings in the plaint and the documents filed by the\n\n 46\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nplaintiff along with plaint and not more than that. It cannot go beyond\n\nthe same. In the present case, the trial Court gave the aforesaid\n\nfindings contrary to the pleadings of the plaint and the documents\n\nfiled by the plaintiff along with the plaint.\n\n 50. With regard to readiness and willingness to perform her\n\npart of obligation, the plaintiff has specifically pleaded that she is\n\nready and willing to perform her part of obligation under an\n\nagreement of sale dated 03.11.2020. She has also specifically pleaded\n\nthat she is solvent and ready to pay balance sale consideration amount.\n\nIn proof of the same, she has filed bank statement. The trial Court has\n\nto consider the said document and the aforesaid pleadings during trial.\n\nTherefore, the impugned order is not a reasoned order and it is not on\n\nconsideration of the aforesaid aspects. Thus, the impugned order is\n\nliable to be set aside.\n\n 51. The present Appeal is accordingly allowed, setting aside\n\nthe order dated 09.08.2023 in I.A. No.663 of 2023 in O.S. No.38 of\n\n2023 passed by leaned VI Additional District and Sessions Judge,\n\nRangareddy District at Kukatpally. I.A. No.663 of 2023 is\n\naccordingly dismissed. However, liberty is granted to both the parties\n\n 47\n\n KL,J & NNR,J\n A.S. No.112 OF 2024\n\nto take all the pleas and grounds which they have raised before this\n\nCourt during trial and the trial Court shall consider the same and\n\ndispose of the suit strictly in accordance with law without being\n\ninfluenced of any of the aforesaid findings. In the circumstances of\n\nthe case, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous applications, if any, pending\n\nin the appeal case shall stand closed.\n\n ________________________________\n K.

Thus, a plaint which seeks\nthe relief of specific performance of an\nagreement/contract must comply with all these\nrequirements. In the matter at hand, the plaintiff\nhas specifically averred in his plaint that he was\nready and willing to perform his part of the\ncontract under the agreement of sale dated\n20.04.1993. It was also specifically stated that the\nplaintiff had been demanding that the first\ndefendant receive the balance consideration of Rs.\n58,800/ and execute a regular registered sale deed\nat his cost, but the first defendant had been\navoiding the specific performance of the\nagreement of sale.
