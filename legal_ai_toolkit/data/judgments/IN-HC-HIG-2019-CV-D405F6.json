Respondents\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nPrayer: Writ Petition filed under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India praying\nto issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, to call for the records on the files of\nthe 1st respondent pertaining to its order in Letter No.6207/B1/2017-5 dated\n12.04.2018 and to quash the same and consequently direct the 1st respondent\nto regularize the service of the petitioner on completion of 10 years of service\nand to extend all service and monetary benefits.\n\nFor Petitioners : M/s.S.Esairani Narasimman\nFor Respondents : Mr.V.Kathirvelu\nSpecial Government Pleader\n\nORDER\n\nThe relief sought for in the present writ petition is to quash the order of\n\nrejection dated 12.04.2018 and consequently, to direct the 1st respondent to\n\nregularize the service of the petitioner on completion of 10 years of service and\n\nto extend all service and monetary benefits.\n\n2.The 1st respondent rejected the claim of the writ petitioners for grant of\n\nregularization and permanent absorption on the ground that even as per the\n\nspecial scheme to grant regularization on completion of 10 years of service, the\n\nwrit petitioners were found not eligible as they had not completed 240 days of\n\nworking. Thus, the case of the writ petitioners were rejected. Challenging the\n\nsaid order, the present writ petition is filed.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n3.The learned counsel for the writ petitioners states that all the writ\n\npetitioners were engaged as daily rated / casual employees and serving in the\n\nDepartment for the past of many years. In view of the fact that they are serving\n\ncontinuously, they are entitled to be regularized in the sanctioned post. The\n\nGovernment issued various schemes to regularize the service of these daily\n\nrated/casual employees on completion of 10 years of service. However, the case\n\nof the writ petitioners were not considered.\n\n4.This apart, the similar cases were already considered and some\n\nemployees from the same Department had been extended with the benefit of\n\nregularization. Such being the factum, the case of the writ petitioners are also to\n\nbe considered on par with the other categories, whose services were already\n\nregularized.\n\n5.The grant of regularization and permanent absorption with reference to\n\nthe judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has been\n\nalready considered by this Court in W.P.Nos.28633 to 28646 of 2014 dated\n\n12.12.2017 and the relevant paragraphs are extracted hereunder:-\n\n“8. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners made a\nsubmission that it is the duty mandatory on the part of the\nrespondents to consider the case of the writ petitioners for\nregularisation in the existing vacancies since the writ petitioners have\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nput in more than 10 years of their services as daily wage employees\nand their names are registered under the Nominal Muster Roll\nmaintained by the respondents. It is not the case of appointment of\nthe writ petitioners but the case of their regularisation is the\ncontention of the writ petitioners. When the employees have\ncompleted 10 years of their services, without the intervention of any\nCourt order then their services to be regularised as per paragraph 53\nof the Constitution Bench judgment of the Honourable Supreme\nCourt of India, in the case of\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1], laid down the legal principles in the matter of\nregularisation, permanent absorption. The relevant Paragraph 53 of\nthe judgment, cited supra, is extracted hereunder:-\n\n“53.One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases\nwhere irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained\nin S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\nNanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N.\nNagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n937] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in\nduly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the\nemployees have continued to work for ten years or more but without\nthe intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question\nof regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be\nconsidered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this\nCourt in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of this judgment.\nIn that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where\ntemporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The\nprocess must be set in motion within six months from this date. We\nalso clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub\njudice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there\nshould be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and\nregularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per\nthe constitutional scheme.”\n\n9. The writ petitioners, though admit the fact that their\nappointment was irregular, contended that their appointments are\nnot illegal and therefore their services ought to have been regularised\nin view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n10. Further, it is contended that the right to life is a\nFundamental Right enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, time and again, reiterated\nand emphasised that the right to life cannot be interpreted as a mere\nanimal life and it is a decent life, which is to be ensured. The writ\npetitioners are deprived of their livelihood in view of the denial of\nregularisation which amounts to deprivation of their life. At the\noutset, it is stated that the writ petitioners have worked for 10 years\nor more and without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. In other words, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure\nthat regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where\ntemporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The\nappointments of such employee should not be illegal. Even if\nirregular, where the appointments are not made against the\nsanctioned posts. Where a person employed under the open\ncompetitive process of prescribed qualifications and was working\nagainst the sanctioned posts, he had been selected without\nundergoing the open competitive process, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.\n\n11. Mooting out the above two principles, the learned counsel\nfor the writ petitioners urged this Court by stating that in respect of\nthe irregular appointments, there is no bar for granting regularisation.\n\nBut the learned counsel is of the opinion that the illegal appointments\nalone, cannot be regularised. As far as the irregular appointments are\nconcerned, the length of service is to be taken into account for the\npurpose of granting regularisation. Accordingly, the writ petitioners\nare entitled for regularisation in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, cited supra.\n\n12. The learned Additional Government Pleader, appearing on\nbehalf of the respondents, submit that the writ petitioners were\nengaged as casual labourers for certain specific works under the\nprovisions of paragraph 290 of T.N.PWA Code which is in connection\nwith the execution of work. The writ petitioners have not been\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\naccommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ petitioners were not\nengaged in connection with any affairs of the State Government. The\nHon'ble High Court of Madras had already held that PWD is not an\nindustry to involve the Industrial Establishment Rules. Further, it is\nsubmitted that the writ petitioners have not been appointed in\nsanctioned posts. The writ petitioners were engaged only to execute\ncertain special and specified works on daily wage basis and therefore,\nthe benefit of regularisation, cannot be granted.\n\n13. Further, it is submitted that in Government Offices, there\nare specified sanction as to the category of post, number of such\nposts, scale of pay etc., and the method of recruitment to the posts\nare defined by statutory rules such as Tamil Nadu State and\nSubordinate Service Rules and no deviation is permitted from the\nmethod of recruitment, howsoever, save the previous approval of the\nGovernment.\n\n14. Paragraph 290 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Account Code\nspecifies that with the following exceptions, all persons engaged\ndepartmentally for the execution of works are considered as day\nlabourers and their wages should be drawn on Muster Rolls, Form 21\n(C.Form Nos.474 and 475) and charged to the estimates of the works\non which they are employed:-\n\n(i) Permanent and temporary employees of the division whose\npay is charged to the head 'Establishment';\n\n(ii) Members of the works charged establishment as defined in\nparagraphs 58 to 62 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department Code.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n15. Thus, the above two categories only form part of the\nestablishment concerning with the PWD Office in the State and the\nrecruitment to the posts are made in accordance with the rules of the\ndifferent services codified in Tamil Nadu Service Manual Volume I to\nIII and therefore, the writ petitioners were engaged as casual\nlabourers for the purpose of specified nature of work to which an\nestimate is got sanctioned as per Tamil Nadu Public Works\nDepartment Code, to the extent necessary.\n\n16. Paragraph 290 of the TNPWD Code states that for the\nwork done by daily labour, the subordinate incharge of the work will\nprepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on when\npracticable the work done and the amount payable.\n\n17. As the writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\nfor a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\ncasual labour virtually stopped as and when the work is completed.\nThe engagement was not made on daily wage basis or not made on\nany Service Rules. Thus, the question of regularisation of petitioners'\nNMR services do not arise.\n\n18. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the\nrespondents, further stated that paragraphs 6(i), (ii), (vi), (vii), (ix) of\nGovernment Order No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\nDepartment, dated 27.6.2013, the Government have ordered that\n“6(i) This order shall be deemed to have been come into force\nwith retrospective effect from 1.1.2006;\n\n6(ii) The services of the full time daily wage employees, who\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwere initially appointed on full time basis in consultation with the\nEmployment Exchange, to discharge the function of the post in the\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed 10 (ten) years of service as\non 1.1.2006 shall be regularised against regular vacancies in the\nsanctioned cadre strength; Further, in paragraph 6(ii), it is stated\nthat the service of the full time daily wage employees who were\ninitially appointed on full time basis in consultation with the\nEmployment Exchange to discharge the function of the post in the\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed ten years of service as on\n1.1.2006 shall be regularised against regular vacancies in the\nsanctioned cadre strength;\n\n6(vi) The part-time and casual employees are not entitled to\nthe concession referred to at paragraph (ii) above;\n\n6(vii) The services of the full time daily wage employees, who\nhave completed 10 years of service, after 1.1.2006, shall not be\nregularised;\n\n6(ix) Stipulates that all the proposals for regularisation of the\nservices of full time daily wages employees should be sent to the\nGovernment even in case where relaxation of rules are not involved”.\n\n19. Whereas the writ petitioners in these writ petitions have\nnot completed 10 years of service as on 1.1.2006 by daily wage\nbasis. But, the writ petitioners were not appointed in consultation\nwith the Employment Exchange as daily wagers. The Government\nOrders issued with regard to the regularisation of Contingent Staff to\nregular servants are only on completion of 10 years of continuous\nservice as contingent servants. Thus, the question of regularisation of\nservice of the writ petitioners do not arise.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n20. In this regard, this Court delivered a judgment in WP\nNo.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 regarding NMR case as follows:-\n\n“The petitioner produced a Certificate issued by one Assistant\nEngineer WRO/Public Works Department, Irrigation Section,\nVadakkankulam to the effect that has been working as NMR from\n1.6.1992. It is also not stated whether pursuant to any order, the\npetitioner has been working on the contrary, the petitioner's claim\nwas that they should be absorbed by reglarising her service. It is also\nadmitted that she was not routed through Employment Exchange and\nthe G.O.Ms.No.177, dated 4.6.1998, does not ensure to the benefit.\n\nThe Supreme Court in\nSecretary, State of Karnataka vs.\nUmadevi\n, reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1, has held that regularisation\ncannot be a method of recruitment unless the petitioner has the case\nfor absorption. As per the orders of the Government in the Original\nApplication (later converted into the writ petition) the relief claimed\nby the petitioner, cannot be countenanced by this Court. Hence, the\nwrit petition stands dismissed.”\n\n21. It is further submitted by the learned Additional\nGovernment Pleader for the respondents that the related issue was\ndealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\nNos.2726-2729 of 2014 and referred the case between State of\nKarnataka and others vs. Uma Devi and others in AIR 2006\nSC 1806, held as under:-\n\n“There is no fundamental right in those who have been\nemployed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to\nclaim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nheld by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since,\na regular appointment could be made only by making appointments\nconsistent with the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim\nfor equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That\nwould be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to\nclaim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never\nbeen selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules.”\n\n22. The learned Additional Government Pleader also referred\nto the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court case in\nState of\nRajasthan and others vs. V.Dayal Lal and Others\n[AIR 2011\nSC 1193] held as under:-\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution will not issue directions for regularisation, absorption\nor permanent continuance, unless the employees claiming\nregularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\nrecruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\nprocess, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause\ncontained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed and\nCourts should not issue a direction for regularisation of services of an\nemployee which would be violative of the constitutional scheme.\nWhile something that is irregular for want of compliance with one of\nthe elements in the process of selection which does not go to the\nroot of the process, can be regularised, back door entries,\nappointments contrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\nappointment of ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or\ndaily-wage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the\nCourt, would not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into\nservice, as such service would be “litigious employment”. Even\ntemporary, ad hoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years,\nlet alone service for one or two years, will not entitle such employee\nto claim regularisation, if he is not working against a sanctioned post.\n\nSympathy and sentiment cannot be grounds for passing any order of\nregularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation with\na cut-off date (that is a scheme providing that persons who had put\nin a specified number of years of service and continuing in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to others who\nwere appointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or contend\nthat the scheme should be applied to them by extending the cut-off\ndate or seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation\nas they are not working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot\nbe a direction for absorption, regularisation or permanent\ncontinuance of part-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run\ninstitutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of\nthe Government on the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can\nemployees in private employment, even if serving full time, seek\nparity in salary with government employees. The right to claim a\nparticular salary against the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBased on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, cited supra,\nCodal Rules and Government orders, the claim of the writ petitioners\ncannot be considered.\n\n23. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\nsubmitted that paragraph 290 of TNPWD Code states that “for work\ndone by daily labour the subordinate incharge of the work will\nprepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on when\npracticable the work done and the amount payable”. The writ\npetitioners were engaged as casual labour for a specified work and\nthat necessity for engagement of such casual labour virtually stopped\nas and when the work is completed. The writ petitioners have not\nbeen accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ petitioners\ncannot claim any right for this casual labour work.\n\n24. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\nsubmitted that as per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\nDepartment dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, Hon'ble\nHigh Court in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal\nNo.2726-2729 of 2014, dated 21.2.2014 judgment, cited supra, the\nclaim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered.\n\n25. The writ petitioners were not employed in connection with\nthe affairs of the State as defined in\nArticle 323-A\nof the Constitution\nof India and they were only casual labourers co-terminus with the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npurposeful completion of the work concerned as per the Acts and the\nRules, in which such provision for the deployment of casual labour is\nmade. Thus, the writ petitioners are estopped from invoking the lofty\njurisdiction of this Apex Forum outside the ambit of the constitutional\nprovisions.\n\n26. At the outset, the grounds relied on by the learned\nAdditional Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the\nrespondents, are enumerated as under:-\n\n(i) The engagement of casual labour and payment made by\nway of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide Chapter\nX-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and 291 of\nTNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n(ii) The casual labourers thus engaged for a particular work\ncannot be regularised how so ever in any manner, without sanction\nof the post, scale of pay etc., by the Government;\n\n(iii) The writ petitioners were not employed in connection with\nthe affairs of the State as defined in Article 323-A of the Constitution\nof India and the writ petitioners were only casual labourers co-\n\nterminus with the purposeful completion of the works concerned as\nper the Acts and the Rules in which such provisions for the\ndeployment of casual labour is made;\n\n(iv) The engagement of casual labourers and payment made\nby way of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\nChamber X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n(v) As per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\nDepartment, dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, this Court\nin W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.2726-2729 of\n2014 dated 21.2.2014, judgment cited supra, the claim of the writ\npetitioners cannot be considered;\n\n(vi) The Government have issued orders in G.O.Ms.No.680,\nPublic Works (C2) Department, dated 16.8.1995 for complete ban on\nappointing new Nominal Muster Rolls, which is already in force. In\nthis regard, D.O.Letter No.26860/C2/2009-2 dated 15.10.2009\nreceived from the Principal Secretary to Government, PWD, Chennai,\nis submitted for perusal. Thus, the Article quoted in the application,\ncannot be correlated with the affairs of the State;\n\n(vii) The writ petitioners were not borne on any cadre strength\nof the erstwhile work charged establishment (now amended in Tamil\nNadu Engineering Subordinate Service) and the service and the writ\npetitioners were not connected with the affairs of the State\nGovernment;\n\n(viii) The writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers for\na specified work and that necessity for engagement of such casual\nlabourers virtually stopped as and when the work was completed. In\nview of the above, the claim of the writ petitioners cannot be\nconsidered.\n\n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners as well as the learned counsel for the\nrespondents, this Court has to first consider the factual matrix\ninvolved in these writ petitions on hand. The writ petitioners,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nundoubtedly, were appointed as daily wage employees in the year\n2003 and they are continued in service for more than ten years, is\nthe claim set out in these writ petitions. However, pursuant to the\nJudgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the case of\nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n,\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as\n“Umadevi Case”], one time benefit was granted by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n28. Even before\nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil Nadu\nissued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\nDepartment, dated 28.02.2006. As per the said Government Order,\nthe temporary employees who have completed ten years of service\nas on the date of the Government Order can be regularised. Even\nprior to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, granting the benefit of\none time regularization in respect of the temporary employees who\nhave completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the\nState was extending the benefit of regularization or permanent\nabsorption to the temporary/daily rated employees who have\ncompleted ten years of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large number of\ntemporary employees were conferred with the benefit of\nregularization and based on that, the writ petitioner also raised his\nclaim for regularization. However, after the Constitution Bench\njudgment rendered in “Umadevi Case”, the State Government\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nissued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department,\ndated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the Government\nhave imposed certain conditions and those conditions are akin to that\nof the recruitment rules in force. The very idea of issuing\nG.O.Ms.No.74, is to provide certain restricted concession to the\ntemporary employees who were otherwise appointed by following the\nrecruitment rules in force. Therefore, the prospectus of the large\nnumber of employees who have served on daily wage basis are\nprevented from getting their regularization. In other words, the said\nG.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and restrictions for\nregularization and for granting permanent absorption. Thus, the\npersons who are eligible to be regularized under G.O.Ms.No.22, are\nprevented from getting the benefit from and out of the said\nGovernment order and G.O.Ms.No.74, imposes certain restrictions.\n\n30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this\nCourt that in the similar circumstances, the learned Single Judge of\nthis Court dealt with the issues in W.P.No.29346 of 2014 & etc.,batch\nand delivered a judgment on 22.09.2017, setting aside the said\nG.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending the same with retrospective\neffect. In other words, the implementation of the Government orders\nwas restricted only prospectively and accordingly, the relief of\nregularization was granted to those writ petitioners.\n\n31. The learned Additional Government Pleader brought to the\nnotice of this Court that the State preferred Writ Appeals in\nW.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in W.P.29346/14, W.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in\nW.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr. No.89142/17 in W.P.No.15668/14,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nW.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in W.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17 in\nW.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against\nthe said judgment\nand the\nsame is pending.\n\n32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues independently\nand based on the judgments of the Apex Court of India in the matter\nof regularization and permanent absorption. However, the learned\nAdditional Government Pleader brought to the notice of this Court\nthat the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court passed an order in the\nbatch of Writ Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of 2012 and etc., batch on\n10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench has considered the\nterms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 and passed an order\nstating that the services shall not be disturbed in the light of the\nGovernment Order passed in G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms Department dated 27.06.2013 as well as the\norder passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\nNos.2726-2729 of 2014 with Nos.2730-31 of 2014.\n\n33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the opinion that\nthe terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 had already been\ntaken note of by the Hon'ble Division Bench and the entire\nGovernment Order was upheld and the direction was issued to pass\norders in the light of the G.O.Ms.No.74 and therefore, the judgment\ndelivered by the learned Single Judge, need not be relied upon and\nmore so, the State also preferred writ appeals against the said\norders.\n\n34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to consider the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nissues independently based on the judgments of the Apex Court of\nIndia.\n\n35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of regularization\nand permanent absorption is the judgment of the Constitution Bench\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in “Umadevi Case”. All\nother subsequent judgments cited by the respective counsels are by\nthe Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of India. Thus,\nthe binding nature of the judgments rendered in respect of other\ncases has to be cogently read and harmoniously interpreted based on\nthe legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India.\n\n36. Before considering the subject of regularization and\npermanent absorption, this Court has to consider the interpretation of\nthe judgments on “binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In view\nof the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has cited\nnumber of judgments, which were passed subsequent to the\nConstitution Bench judgment, stating that Paragraph (53) of the\n“Umadevi Case” has been interpreted in different ways and under\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to be considered\nand a direction to be issued for regularization. In view of the fact\nthat large number of judgments are cited before this Court in the\nmatter of regularization and permanent absorption, now, this Court\nhas to first decide what all are the judgments which all are having a\n“binding precedent” and on this reason, this Court has to consider\nvery interpretation of the concept regarding “binding precedent”.\nIn\nrespect of judgments in relation to the interpretation of “binding\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprecedent”, this Court is inclined to consider the very recent\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n,\nreported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is pertinent to note that it is\na judgment by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India headed by His Lordship, Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak\nMisra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of India delivered this judgment\nand it is relevant to quote paragraphs (15 to 26):\n\n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, while dealing with the cases of accident claims, has elaborately\ndiscussed about the “binding precedent”. The case in relation to the\nMotor Accident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma” was being followed\nby all the Courts across the Country for the purpose of awarding\ncompensation. When the question arosed that the “binding nature”\nof the said case of “Sarla Verma” delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India, the Constitution Bench headed by the Hon'ble Chief\nJustice of India held that the principles\nlaid down in\nthe case of\n\n“Virayya v. Venkata Subbayya”\n, it has been held by the Andhra\nPradesh High Court that under the circumstances aforesaid the Bench\nis free to adopt that view which is in accordance with justice and\nlegal principles after taking into consideration the views expressed in\nthe two conflicting Benches, it is further held that in the case of\nState\nof Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias Kalika Singh and others, reported in [JT\n(2003) 4 SC 489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be\nnot correct yet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench of\ncoordinate jurisdiction.\n\nTheir Lordships rendered the case of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n, reported in\n[JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding precedent is\nof utmost importance in the administration of our judicial system. It\npromotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\nconsistency promotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is\nthis need for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in the\ndecisions of this Court.\n\n38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard, the Apex\nCourt of India held that the judgment by the Larger Bench of the\nCourts are to be treated as “binding precedent”, while deciding the\nlegal principles involved in the particular case.\n\n39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the case of Padma Sundara Rao and Others Vs. State\nof Tamil Nadu and others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 533, and\nthe relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing\nas to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the\ndecision on which reliance is placed. There is always peril in treating\nthe words of a speech or judgment as though they are words in a\nlegislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial\nutterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case,\nsaid Lord Morris in Herrington v. British Railways Board [(1972) 2\nWLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom British Railways Board v.\nHerrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility, one\nadditional or different fact may make a world of difference between\nconclusions in two cases.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n40. In view of the legal principle settled in the matter of\n“binding precedent”, now, this Court is bound by the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there is no other\nsubsequent Constitution Bench judgment in respect of the subject of\nregularization and permanent absorption. The last judgment\nrendered by the Constitution Bench in the subject matter is\n“Umadevi Case”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of “binding precedent” or\nto be followed as “binding precedent”. Thus, the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition has to be considered only\nin the light of the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench. All\nother judgments subsequently passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India may have certain distinctions far and against. However,\nthese judgments are to be interpreted only based on the facts and\ncircumstances prevailing in that particular case and therefore, this\nCourt cannot consider those judgments delivered on a particular facts\nin relation to that particular case. However, the legal principles are to\nbe considered in relation to the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case on hand.\n\n41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by the\nConstitution Bench in the matter of regularization and permanent\nabsorption. Paragraph (5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions which could\nnot be said to be consistent with the constitutional scheme of public\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The question\narises, equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the court with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions\nof this country seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity\nfor competing for employment? When one side of the coin is\nconsidered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered and\nthe way open to any court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as\nlaid down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which at\ntimes, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\ncertainly tend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is\nthis conflict that is reflected in these cases referred to the\nConstitution Bench”\n\n42. This Court wants to look into the very findings made by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above said paragraph (5),\nthe Apex Court has conceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia had also on occasions, issued directions, which could not be\nsaid to be consistent with the Constitutional schemes of public\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India raised a question that equity to whom?\nEquity for the handful of people who have approached the Court with\nthe claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this Country seeking\nemployment and seeking a fair opportunity for competing for\nemployment? When one side of the coin is considered, the other side\nof the coin has also to be considered and the way open to any Court\nof law or justice, is to adhere to the law as laid down by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution and not to make directions, which at times, even if do\nnot run counter to the constitutional scheme, certainly tend to water\ndown the constitutional requirements. It is this Conflict that reflected\nin these cases referred to the Constitution Bench.\n\n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern recorded\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The concern raised by the\nConstitution Bench is that by granting relief to a handful of people,\nthe large sector of meritorious youth of this great nation cannot be\ndeprived of their constitutional rights. Under this pretext, the\nConstitution Bench commenced its consideration in “Umadevi\nCase”. Thus, the very enumeration in the above paragraph is crystal\nclear that the Constitution Bench has laid down the principle in the\nmatter of regularization and permanent absorption and the idea of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to stop the practice of\nappointing employees, through back door on extraneous\nconsideration by showing favoritism and nepotism.\n\n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi Case” is\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“10. When these matters came up before a Bench of two Judges,\nthe learned Judges referred the cases to a Bench of three Judges.\nThe order of reference is reported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(1) [(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 935 : (2003) 9\nScale 187] . This Court noticed that in the matter of regularisation of\nad hoc employees, there were conflicting decisions by three-Judge\nBenches of this Court and by two-Judge Benches and hence the\nquestion required to be considered by a larger Bench. When the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmatters came up before a three-Judge Bench, the Bench in turn felt\nthat the matter required consideration by a Constitution Bench in\nview of the conflict and in the light of the arguments raised by the\nAdditional Solicitor General.\n\nThe order of reference is reported in\n\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(2) [(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003)\n10 Scale 388] . It appears to be proper to quote that order of\nreference at this stage. It reads: (SCC p. 45, paras 1-5)\n“1.\n\nApart from the conflicting opinions between the three-Judge\nBench decisions in\nAshwani Kumar v. State of Bihar\n[(1997) 2 SCC 1 :\n\n1997 SCC (L&S) 465 : 1996 Supp (10) SCR 120] , State of Haryana v.\nPiara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21\nATC 403 : (1992) 3 SCR 826] and Dharwad Distt.\nPWD Literate Daily\nWage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 :\n1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] on the\none hand and\nState of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar Verma\n[(1996) 7 SCC\n562 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 645 : (1996) 33 ATC 336 : AIR 1996 SC 1565 :\n\n(\n1996) 1 SCR 972] , State of Punjab v. Surinder Kumar\n[(1992) 1\nSCC 489 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 345 : (1992) 19 ATC 500 : AIR 1992 SC\n1593 : 1991 Supp (3) SCR 553] and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of\nKarnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n937] on the other, which have been brought out in one of the\njudgments under appeal of the Karnataka High Court in\nState of\nKarnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao\n[(2001) 4 Kant LJ 466 (DB)] , decided\non 1-6-2001 the learned Additional Solicitor General urged that the\nscheme for regularisation is repugnant to\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\n\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore, these cases are required\nto be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges (Constitution Bench).\n\n2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned Senior Counsel,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappearing for the employees urged that such a scheme for\nregularisation is consistent with the provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in CCs Nos.\n109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated 19-7-2002 and submitted\nthat the orders have already been implemented.\n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between the\nthree-Judge Bench decisions of this Court, we are of the view that\nthese cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\nJudges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice\nfor appropriate orders.”\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here. We have to\nlay down the law. We have to approach the question as a\nconstitutional court should.”\n\n45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that there were\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by\ntwo-Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and\ntherefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\nthe question required to be considered by a larger Bench. It is\nfurther observed that when the matters came up before a three-\nJudge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\nconsideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in\nthe light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General.\nIn the reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench itself\ndecided that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\nArticles\n16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore, these\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\nJudges(Constitution Bench).\n\n46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi Case”, it is stated\nthat in addition to the equality clause represented by\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution,\nArticle 16\nhas specifically provided for equality of\nopportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these\nfundamental rights,\nArticle 309\nprovides that subject to the provisions\nof the Constitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate the\nrecruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public\nservices and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a\nState.\n\n47. In view of the interpretation placed on\nArticle 12\nof the\nConstitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also govern the\ninstrumentalities that come within the purview of\nArticle 12\nof the\nConstitution. With a view to make the procedure for selection fair,\nthe Constitution by\nArticle 315\nhas also created a Public Service\nCommission for the Union and the Public Service Commissions for the\nStates.\nArticle 320\ndeals with the functions of the Public Service\nCommissions and mandates consultation with the Commission on all\nmatters relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and for\ncivil posts and other related matters. As a part of the affirmative\naction recognised by\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution,\nArticle 335\n\nprovides for special consideration in the matter of claims of the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for\nemployment.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi Case” reads as\nfollows:\n\n“12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions when the\nsovereign State or its instrumentalities will have to employ persons,\nin posts which are temporary, on daily wages, as additional hands or\ntaking them in without following the required procedure, to discharge\nthe duties in respect of the posts that are sanctioned and that are\nrequired to be filled in terms of the relevant procedure established by\nthe Constitution or for work in temporary posts or projects that are\nnot needed permanently. This right of the Union or of the State\nGovernment cannot but be recognised and there is nothing in the\nConstitution which prohibits such engaging of persons temporarily or\non daily wages, to meet the needs of the situation. But the fact that\nsuch engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to defeat the very\nscheme of public employment. Nor can a court say that the Union or\nthe State Governments do not have the right to engage persons in\nvarious capacities for a duration or until the work in a particular\nproject is completed. Once this right of the Government is recognised\nand the mandate of the constitutional requirement for public\nemployment is respected, there cannot be much difficulty in coming\nto the conclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts\nwhether acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, to direct absorption in permanent employment\nof those who have been engaged without following a due process of\nselection as envisaged by the constitutional scheme.”\n\n49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment is that the temporary engagements like daily wage\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappointments, consolidated pay appointments and temporary\nappointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to\ndefeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a Court say\nthat the Union or the State Governments do not have the right to\nengage persons in various capacities for a duration or until the work\nin a particular project is completed. Once this right of the\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of the constitutional\nrequirement for public employment is respected, there cannot be\nmuch difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is ordinarily not\nproper for the Courts, whether acting under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution or under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct\nabsorption in permanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged by\nthe constitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the\nConstitutional Bench that regular recruitment rules in force, followed\nscrupulously by the competent authorities and engagements on\ntemporary basis cannot be resorted or the same cannot lead to\npermanent absorption or regularization. Further, it is stated that the\nGovernment is entitled to appoint the persons on daily\nwages/consolidated pay/temporary basis, if a Government is of the\nopinion that a project has to be implemented or a special works to be\ncarried out, then they are at liberty to do so, by engaging the\ntemporary employees. Such being the concept accepted by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a mere appointment on\ntemporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a right for the\nemployees to claim regularization or permanent absorption.\n\n50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13. What is sought to be pitted against this approach, is the so-\ncalled equity arising out of giving of temporary employment or\nengagement on daily wages and the continuance of such persons in\nthe engaged work for a certain length of time. Such considerations\ncan have only a limited role to play, when every qualified citizen has\na right to apply for appointment, the adoption of the concept of rule\nof law and the scheme of the Constitution for appointment to posts.\nIt cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the courts to\nignore, encourage or approve appointments made or engagements\ngiven outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on\nsuch sentiments or approach would result in perpetuating illegalities\nand in the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted\nby us while adopting the Constitution. The approving of such acts\nalso results in depriving many of their opportunity to compete for\npublic employment. We have, therefore, to consider the question\nobjectively and based on the constitutional and statutory provisions.\n\nIn this context, we have also to bear in mind the exposition of law by\na Constitution Bench in\nState of Punjab v. Jagdip Singh\n[(1964) 4\nSCR 964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] . It was held therein: (SCR pp. 971-72)\n“In our opinion where a government servant has no right to a post or\nto a particular status, though an authority under the Government\nacting beyond its competence had purported to give that person a\nstatus which it was not entitled to give he will not in law be deemed\nto have been validly appointed to the post or given the particular\nstatus.”\n\n51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement made by\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe Constitution Bench in respect of providing equal opportunity and\nin respect of implementing the equality clause enshrined under\nArticle\n& 16\nof the Constitution. In the above said paragraph (13), the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has emphasized that it cannot also\nbe forgotten that it is not the role of the Courts to ignore, encourage\nor approve appointments made or engagements given outside the\nconstitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on such sentiments or\napproach would result in perpetuating illegalities and in the\njettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted by us, while\nadopting the Constitution. We, the people of India, while adopting\nthe Constitution.\n\n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many\nof their opportunity to compete for public employment. The\nConstitution Bench of “Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition\nof law\nlaid down by\nthe previous Constitution Bench in the case of\n\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported in [AIR (1964) SC\n521].\n\nThe earlier Constitution Bench in the case of\nState of\nPunjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant\nhas no right to a post or to a particular status, though an authority\nunder the Government acting beyond its competence had purported\nto give that person a status which it was not entitled to give he will\nnot in law be deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\ngiven the particular status.\n\n53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has elaborately discussed about\nvarious orders of the Courts either interim orders or final orders\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhich were brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion that those\norders more or less was the issue of directions for continuation or\nabsorption without referring to the legal position obtaining. It was\nbrought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been created by\nsuch orders without reference to the legal principles and it is time\nthat this Court settled the law once and for all so that in case the\nCourt finds that such orders should not be made, the Courts,\nespecially, the High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\ndirections or passing such orders.\n\n54. The very arguments advanced by the learned counsel for\nthe State of Karnataka is that a chaos was created on account of\nvarious contradicting orders passed by the High Courts in the matter\nof regularization or permanent absorption in order to settle the legal\nprinciples. The learned counsel urged the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia to take note of the fact that there is a chaos prevailing in\nrespect of the regularization and permanent absorption of the\ntemporary/daily wages employees and brought to the notice of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High Courts would be\nprecluded from issuing any such directions or passing such orders in\ncontrary to the legal principles in the matters of regularization or\npermanent absorption or appointment. The observation made in this\nregard is that bypassing of the Constitutional scheme cannot be\nperpetuated by the passing of orders without dealing with and\ndeciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone of\nConstitutionality.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“20. The decision in Dharwad Distt.\nPWD Literate Daily Wage\nEmployees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC\n(L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a\nscheme framed by the State of Karnataka, though at the instance of\nthe Court. The scheme was essentially relating to the application of\nthe concept of equal pay for equal work but it also provided for\nmaking permanent, or what it called regularisation, without keeping\nthe distinction in mind, of employees who had been appointed ad\nhoc, casually, temporarily or on daily-wage basis. In other words,\nemployees who had been appointed without following the procedure\nestablished by law for such appointments. This Court, at the\nthreshold, stated that it should individualise justice to suit a given\nsituation. With respect, it is not possible to accept the statement,\nunqualified as it appears to be. This Court is not only the\nconstitutional court, it is also the highest court in the country, the\nfinal court of appeal. By virtue of\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution, what\nthis Court lays down is the law of the land. Its decisions are binding\non all the courts. Its main role is to interpret the constitutional and\nother statutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\nphilosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto ourselves a\nsystem of governance by rule of law. The role of the Supreme Court\nis to render justice according to law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme\nCourt is expected to decide questions of law for the country and not\nto decide individual cases without reference to such principles of law.\nConsistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with its own\ndecisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals and usher in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njudicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is really to interpret the law and\ndecide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders which are\ninconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the court in the\nselfsame judgment not only create confusion but also tend to usher\nin arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity tends to vary\nwith the Chancellor's foot.”\n\n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt.\nPWD\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. Vs. State of Karnataka\n,\nreported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was considered in the above\nparagraph. It is observed that the role of the Court to interpret the\nlaw and decide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders\nwhich are inconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\nCourt in the self same judgment not only create confusion but also\ntend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity\ntends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\n\n57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas accepted the decision, the question of law for the country and\nnot to decide individual cases without reference to such principles of\nlaw. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with its\nown decisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals and\nresult in judicial chaos. The observation made in this regard are\ncertainly to be followed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n58.\nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex Court\nreferred the spirit of\nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n,\nreported in (1973) 4 SCC 225, the Court held that\nArticle 14\n&\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n16 which was described as a facet of\nArticle 14\nis part of the basic\nstructure of the Constitution.\n\nIn the case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs.\nUnion of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168\n,\nthe said decision\n\nwas reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\ntransgress the basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle\nof equality enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof which\nArticle 16(1)\nis a facet.\n\n59.\nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the above said\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000)\n1 SCC 168, it is held that equality and equal opportunity is a basis\nfeature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant position of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution in the scheme of things.\n\n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in the\ncase of\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n(1987) 1 SCC 378 and the relevant paragraph (3) is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our Constitution and\nit is the essence of the rule of law that the exercise of the power by\nthe State whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other\nauthority should be within the constitutional limitations and if any\npractice is adopted by the executive which is in flagrant and\nsystematic violation of its constitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a\nmember of the public would have sufficient interest to challenge such\npractice by filing a writ petition and it would be the constitutional\nduty of this Court to entertain the writ petition and adjudicate upon\nthe validity of such practice”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n61. Let us now look into the way in which the Constitution\nBench has arrived the conclusion in the matter of regularization and\npermanent absorption in “Umadevi Case” and the relevant\nparagraphs (43) to (50), which all are extracted hereunder:\n\n“43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in\npublic employment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since\nthe rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly\nbe disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of\nArticle 14\n\nor in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the\nrequirements of\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution.\nTherefore, consistent with the scheme for public employment, this\nCourt while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless\nthe appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper\ncompetition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any\nright on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\nsame would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a\ntemporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the\nexpiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\nmerely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is\ncontinued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would\nnot be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent,\nmerely on the strength of such continuance, if the original\nappointment was not made by following a due process of selection as\nenvisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court to prevent\nregular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose\nperiod of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwho by the very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any\nright. The High Courts acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution,\nshould not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularisation, or\npermanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made\nregularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because\nan employee had continued under cover of an order of the court,\nwhich we have described as “litigious employment” in the earlier part\nof the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be\nabsorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases,\nthe High Court may not be justified in issuing interim directions,\nsince, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found\nentitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a\nmanner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas\nan interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the\nregular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of\npaying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be\ncareful in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the\neconomic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its\ninstrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to facilitate the\nbypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates.\n\n44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work” is different\nfrom the concept of conferring permanency on those who have been\nappointed on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process\nof selection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in various\ndecisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal work and has\nlaid down the parameters for the application of that principle. The\ndecisions are rested on the concept of equality enshrined in our\nConstitution in the light of the directive principles in that behalf. But\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a position where the\ncourt could direct that appointments made without following the due\nprocedure established by law, be deemed permanent or issue\ndirections to treat them as permanent. Doing so, would be negation\nof the principle of equality of opportunity. The power to make an\norder as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or\nmatter pending before this Court, would not normally be used for\ngiving the go-by to the procedure established by law in the matter of\npublic employment. Take the situation arising in the cases before us\nfrom the State of Karnataka. Therein, after Dharwad decision [(1990)\n2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1\nSCR 544] the Government had issued repeated directions and\nmandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc employment or\nengagement be given. Some of the authorities and departments had\nignored those directions or defied those directions and had continued\nto give employment, specifically interdicted by the orders issued by\nthe executive. Some of the appointing officers have even been\npunished for their defiance. It would not be just or proper to pass an\norder in exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the\nConstitution or in exercise of power under\nArticle 142\nof the\nConstitution permitting those persons engaged, to be absorbed or to\nbe made permanent, based on their appointments or engagements.\n\nComplete justice would be justice according to law and though it\nwould be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court would not\ngrant a relief which would amount to perpetuating an illegality.\n\n45. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual,\nbe regularised or made permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact\nthat the person concerned has worked for some time and in some\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncases for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the person who\naccepts an engagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not\naware of the nature of his employment. He accepts the employment\nwith open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain\n—not at arm's length—since he might have been searching for some\nemployment so as to eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he\ngets. But on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate to\njettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and to take the\nview that a person who has temporarily or casually got employed\nshould be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will\nbe creating another mode of public appointment which is not\npermissible. If the court were to void a contractual employment of\nthis nature on the ground that the parties were not having equal\nbargaining power, that too would not enable the court to grant any\nrelief to that employee. A total embargo on such casual or temporary\nemployment is not possible, given the exigencies of administration\nand if imposed, would only mean that some people who at least get\nemployment temporarily, contractually or casually, would not be\ngetting even that employment when securing of such employment\nbrings at least some succour to them. After all, innumerable citizens\nof our vast country are in search of employment and one is not\ncompelled to accept a casual or temporary employment if one is not\ninclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context that\none has to proceed on the basis that the employment was accepted\nfully knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it.\nIn other words, even while accepting the employment, the person\nconcerned knows the nature of his employment. It is not an\nappointment to a post in the real sense of the term. The claim\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nacquired by him in the post in which he is temporarily employed or\nthe interest in that post cannot be considered to be of such a\nmagnitude as to enable the giving up of the procedure established,\nfor making regular appointments to available posts in the services of\nthe State. The argument that since one has been working for some\ntime in the post, it will not be just to discontinue him, even though\nhe was aware of the nature of the employment when he first took it\nup, is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure\nestablished by law for public employment and would have to fail\nwhen tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality of\nopportunity enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents\nargued that on the basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, the\nemployees, especially of the Commercial Taxes Department, should\nbe directed to be regularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990)\n2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1\nSCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 :\n\n(1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M.\nPuthuparambil v. Kerala Water Authority\n, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991\nSCC (L&S) 25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural\nUniversity [Gujarat Agricultural University v. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n,\n(2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 613] and the like, have given\nrise to an expectation in them that their services would also be\nregularised. The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\nadministrative authority affect the person by depriving him of some\nbenefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been\npermitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\nlegitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there have\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeen communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it\non which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he\nhas received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not be\nwithdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing\nreasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn.\n\n[See Lord\nDiplock in Council for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil Service\n[1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL)] ,\nNational Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan\n[(1998) 7\nSCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of\nRajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .] There is no\ncase that any assurance was given by the Government or the\ndepartment concerned while making the appointment on daily wages\nthat the status conferred on him will not be withdrawn until some\nrational reason comes into existence for withdrawing it. The very\nengagement was against the constitutional scheme. Though, the\nCommissioner of the Commercial Taxes Department sought to get\nthe appointments made permanent, there is no case that at the time\nof appointment any promise was held out. No such promise could\nalso have been held out in view of the circulars and directives issued\nby the Government after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990\nSCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though,\nthere is a case that the State had made regularisations in the past of\nsimilarly situated employees, the fact remains that such\nregularisations were done only pursuant to judicial directions, either\nof the Administrative Tribunal or of the High Court and in some cases\nby this Court. Moreover, the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they must be\nmade permanent or they must be regularised in the service though\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthey had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment.\n\nThe fact that in certain cases the court had directed regularisation of\nthe employees involved in those cases cannot be made use of to\nfound a claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument if\naccepted would also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The\nargument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets\nengagement as a contractual or casual worker and the engagement\nis not based on a proper selection as recognised by the relevant rules\nor procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment\nbeing temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person\ncannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being\nconfirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be\nmade only by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases\nconcerned, in consultation with the Public Service Commission.\nTherefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot be\nsuccessfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual\nemployees. It cannot also be held that the State has held out any\npromise while engaging these persons either to continue them where\nthey are or to make them permanent. The State cannot\nconstitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the\ntheory cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being made\npermanent in the post.\n\n48. It was then contended that the rights of the employees\nthus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are\nviolated. It is stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly\nby employing them on less than minimum wages and extracting work\nfrom them for a pretty long period in comparison with those directly\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nrecruited who are getting more wages or salaries for doing similar\nwork. The employees before us were engaged on daily wages in the\ndepartment concerned on a wage that was made known to them.\nThere is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being paid.\nThose who are working on daily wages formed a class by themselves,\nthey cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those who\nhave been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules. No\nright can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that\nsuch employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited\ncandidate, and made permanent in employment, even assuming that\nthe principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for equal\nwork. There is no fundamental right in those who have been\nemployed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to\nclaim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\nheld by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since,\na regular appointment could be made only by making appointments\nconsistent with the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim\nfor equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That\nwould be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to\nclaim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never\nbeen selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules. The\narguments based on\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution are\ntherefore overruled.\n\n49. It is contended that the State action in not regularising\nthe employees was not fair within the framework of the rule of law.\nThe rule of law compels the State to make appointments as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nenvisaged by the Constitution and in the manner we have indicated\nearlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees had worked\nfor some length of time but this has also been brought about by the\npendency of proceedings in tribunals and courts initiated at the\ninstance of the employees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this\nnature would mean that the State would be permitted to perpetuate\nan illegality in the matter of public employment and that would be a\nnegation of the constitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of\nIndia. It is therefore not possible to accept the argument that there\nmust be a direction to make permanent all the persons employed on\ndaily wages. When the court is approached for relief by way of a writ,\nthe court has necessarily to ask itself whether the person before it\nhad any legal right to be enforced. Considered in the light of the very\nclear constitutional scheme, it cannot be said that the employees\nhave been able to establish a legal right to be made permanent even\nthough they have never been appointed in terms of the relevant\nrules or in adherence of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n50. It is argued that in a country like India where there is so\nmuch poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of\nbargaining power, the action of the State in not making the\nemployees permanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. But the very argument indicates that there are so many\nwaiting for employment and an equal opportunity for competing for\nemployment and it is in that context that the Constitution as one of\nits basic features, has included\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nso as to\nensure that public employment is given only in a fair and equitable\nmanner by giving all those who are qualified, an opportunity to seek\nemployment. In the guise of upholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution, a set of persons cannot be preferred over a vast\nmajority of people waiting for an opportunity to compete for State\nemployment. The acceptance of the argument on behalf of the\nrespondents would really negate the rights of the others conferred by\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, assuming that we are in a position to\nhold that the right to employment is also a right coming within the\npurview of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. The argument that\nArticle\nof the Constitution is breached because the employment on daily\nwages amounts to forced labour, cannot be accepted. After all, the\nemployees accepted the employment at their own volition and with\neyes open as to the nature of their employment. The Governments\nalso revised the minimum wages payable from time to time in the\nlight of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us that\nimporting of these theories to defeat the basic requirement of public\nemployment would defeat the constitutional scheme and the\nconstitutional goal of equality.”\n\n62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to the rule of\nequality in public employment is a basic feature of our Constitution\nwhen it is clarified that adherence to the rule of equality in public\nemployment is a basic feature of the Constitution, certainly, no\nperson can deviate the principles in this regard and therefore,\nappointment in accordance with the recruitment rules in force by the\ncompetent authorities is the constitutional mandate and any deviation\nto be construed as violation of the constitutional principles. It is\nobserved that if it is a contractual appointment, the appointment\ncomes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement\nor appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nto an end when it is discontinued. Similarly temporary employee\ncould not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of\nappointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a\ntemporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time\nbeyond the term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be\nabsorbed in regular service or made appointment, merely on the\nstrength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not\nmade by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the\nrelevant rules.\n\n63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment\nat the instance of temporary employees whose period of employment\nhas come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature\nof their appointment do not acquire any right. The High Courts\nacting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, should not ordinarily\nissue directions for absorption, regularization, or permanent\ncontinuance unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in\nterms of constitutional scheme.\n\n64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition on hand. In the present\nwrit petition, the writ petitioners were appointed on daily wage basis\nas Nominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere continuance or the\nlength of service rendered alone cannot be a ground for granting the\nrelief of regularization. Thus, the very legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts and circumstances of\nthe present writ petition. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia deals with the “litigious employment”. Of course, the situation\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndoes not arise in the present case. The interim order of Status Quo\ngranted by this Court has not been properly implemented by\nreinstating the petitioners in service and the Contempt petition filed\nby the writ petitioners were also posted along with the writ petition\nfor final disposal. Thus, the concept of “litigious employment” would\nnot arise in respect of the present writ petition. Therefore, the\npetitioners have not continued in service by virtue of the interim\norder of Status Quo granted by this Court. However, their services\nwere ousted, after filing of the writ petition.\n\n65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment deals\nwith the concept of “equal pay for equal work”. Thus, it may not be\nrequired to elaborate the paragraph as far as the present case on\nhand is concerned.\n\n66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states that the\nApex Court of India held that, while directing that appointments,\ntemporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\nare swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for\nsome time and in some cases for a considerable length of time. It is\nnot as if the person who accepts an engagement either temporary or\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He\naccepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true that he is\nnot in a position to bargain- not at arm's length – Since he might\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his\nlivelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it\nwould not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of\nappointment and to take the view that a person who has temporarily\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nor casually got employed should be directed to be continued\npermanently. By doing so, it will be creating another mode of public\nappointment which is not permissible. A total embargo of such\ncasual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies\nof administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people\nwho at least get employment temporarily, contractually or casually,\nwould not be getting even that employment when securing of such\nemployment brings at least some succour to them.\n\n67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in\nsearch of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or\ntemporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\nemployment. It is in this context that one has to proceed on the\nbasis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature of\nit and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even while\naccepting the employment, the person concerned knows the nature\nof his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the real\nsense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he\nis temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be\nconsidered to be of such a magnitude, so as to enable the giving up\nof the procedure established, for making regular appointments to\navailable posts in the services of the State.\n\n68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment,\ntheir Lordships held that the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they must be\nmade permanent or they must be regularised in the service though\nthey had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nThe fact that in certain cases the court had directed regularization of\nthe employees involved in those cases cannot be made use of, to\nfound a claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument if\naccepted would also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The\nargument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\nenumerates that when a person enters a temporary employment or\ngets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the\nengagement is not based on a proper selection as recognised by the\nrelevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such\na person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being\nconfirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be\nmade only by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases\nconcerned, in consultation with the Public Service Commission.\nTherefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully\nadvanced by temporary, contractual or casual employees.\n\n70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi Case” Judgment, the\nConstitution Bench considered the right of the employees thus\nappointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are violated.\nEven in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the Supreme\nCourt of India were engaged on daily wages in the department\nconcerned on a daily wage that was made known to them. There is\nno case that the wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those who\nare working on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they\ncannot claim that they are discriminated as against those who have\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeen regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules. No right\ncan be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such\nemployee should be treated on par with a regularly recruited\ncandidate, and made permanent in employment, even assuming that\nthe principle could be invoked for claiming equal wages for equal\nwork. There is no fundamental right for those who have been\nemployed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to\nclaim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\nheld by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since,\na regular appointment could be made only by making appointments\nconsistent with the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law compels\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution and\nin the manner we have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the Court is\napproached by way of a writ, the Court has necessarily to ask itself\nwhether the person before it had any legal right to be enforced.\nEven, the Constitution Bench dealt with the\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is so much\npoverty and unemployment and there is no equality of bargaining\npower, the action of the State in not making the employees\npermanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. But\nthe very argument indicates that there are so many waiting for\nemployment and an equal opportunity for competing for employment\nand it is in that context, the Constitution as one of its basic features,\nhas included Articles 14,16 and 309 so as to ensure that public\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment is given only in a fair and equitable manner by giving all\nthose who are qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In the\nguise of upholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a set of\npersons cannot be preferred over a vast majority of people waiting\nfor an opportunity to compete for State employment.\n\n72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph urged by\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment of “Umadevi Case”.\n\nParagraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases\nwhere irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained\nin S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\nNanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N.\nNagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n937] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in\nduly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the\nemployees have continued to work for ten years or more but without\nthe intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question\nof regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be\nconsidered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this\nCourt in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of this judgment.\nIn that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where\ntemporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The\nprocess must be set in motion within six months from this date. We\nalso clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub\njudice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there\nshould be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and\nregularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per\nthe constitutional scheme.”\n\n73. The above said paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\nis a one time relief, of Course, granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India to mitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the temporary\nemployees. Now, the question arises how long the benefit granted\nunder paragraph (53) can be extended to the employees and what is\nthe interpretation of the subsequent judgment by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in respect of paragraph (53) of the judgment\nof the Constitution Bench.\n\n74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India, while stopping the entire irregular appointments and\nback door appointments had taken note of the fact that certain reliefs\nare required in respect of the employees who are already regularized\nor in respect of those persons, a proposal is already kept pending.\nCertainly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have never intended to\ngrant the relief of regularization or permanent absorption in public\nemployment contrary to the legal principles settled in earlier\nparagraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the judgment has to be\nunderstood harmoniously and together with the legal principles\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in earlier paragraphs.\n\n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that\nparagraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment cannot be treated\nas an isolation and it should be considered along with the other legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping in mind, the\nlegal principles settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nearlier paragraphs, this Court is of the opinion that one time relief\ngranted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be extended in\nits real sense and the High Courts cannot travel beyond the scope of\nthe intention expressed by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (53)\nof the Judgment.\n\n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\nU.P.State\nElectricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n,\nreported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\njudgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the decision\nof this Court in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and has urged that no direction for\nregularisation can be given by the Court. In our opinion, the decision\nin Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is clearly\ndistinguishable. The said decision cannot be applied to a case where\nregularisation has been sought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution.”\n\n77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndistinguished that case with the “Umadevi Case”. The very\nlanguage used in Paragraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the\ndecision in “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The said\ndecision cannot be applied to a case where regularization has been\nsought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. However,\nthis Court is of the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished the\n“Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and circumstances that the\ncase. When their Lordships have distinguished that case, this Court\nis of the opinion that the legal principles settled in “Umadevi Case”\nhas not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, as it is a “binding precedent” as\nstated by this Court in earlier paragraphs.\n\n78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding precedent” and when\nthe case was distinguished from “Umadevi Case” on factual\ncircumstances, the same cannot be applied in the present case before\nthis Court.\n\n79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal and\nanother Vs. Prantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik\nMahaparishad, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the relevant\nparagraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner which\nis extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. A writ petition was filed before the Uttaranchal High Court\nwhich was dismissed by the impugned order. The High Court was of\nthe view that all the 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily\nwages for more than six years and had completed 240 days in each\ncalendar year and they ought to be regularised. Accordingly, the writ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npetition was dismissed.”\n\n80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this Court is of\nthe opinion that the case relates to an award passed by the Labour\nCourt and an Award passed by the Labour Court under the provisions\nof the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance in respect\nof the Government employments made by virtue of the rules framed\nby the State in this regard. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in that case, remanded the matter back for reconsideration by\nthe High Court in the light of the legal principles settled in the\n“Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects, the case cannot have any\napplication in respect of the facts and circumstances of the present\nwrit petition.\n\n81. It has further cited the case of\nState of Karnataka and\nOthers Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n, reported in (2010) 9 SCC\n247 and the relevant paragraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to\nthe general principles against “regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments will be\nconsidered to be illegal. But where the person employed possessed\nthe prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctioned\nposts, but had been selected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are considered to be\nirregular.”\n\n82.\nIn\nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved out in\nrelation to the one time relief granted in paragraph (15) of the\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\n83. In the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs. Daya\nLal and Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant\nparagraph (12), enumerates the settled principles in respect of\nregularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context of the case\nand those principles carved out in paragraph (12) of the above\njudgment are akin to that of the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the\nattention of this Court relying the case decided by the Hon'ble Two\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\nreported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph (31) and (33) of\nthe judgments are extracted hereunder:\n\n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the process of\nselection adopted in identifying the appellants herein cannot be said\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nto be unreasonable or arbitrary in the sense that it was devised to\neliminate other eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note that\nin Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , this Court was dealing with\nappointments made without following any rational procedure in the\nlower rungs of various services of the Union and the States.\n\n33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the need to employ\na certain number of people for discharging a particular responsibility\nof the State under the Constitution is always with the executive\ngovernment of the day subject to the overall control of the\nlegislature. That does not mean that an examination by a\nconstitutional court regarding the accuracy of the assessment of the\nneed is barred.”\n\n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of an\nundoubted opinion that there is a slight deviation in respect of the\nlegal principles carved out by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in\n“Umadevi Case”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\nby the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of “Umadevi Case”. To\nreiterate the language used by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nemphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also occasions to\nissue directions which could not be said to be consisted by the public\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable consideration or individualization of justice. The question\narises, equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the Court with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions\nof this Country seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity\nfor competing for employment?\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi Case”\njudgment, again the Constitution Bench reiterated that “It is also\nclarified that those decisions which run counter to the principle\nsettled in this decision, or in which directions running counter to what\nwe have held herein, will stand denuded of their status as\nprecedents.”\n\n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the judgment\ncited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of\nNihal\nSingh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n, reported in\n(2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their status\nas precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to consider and follow\nthe same.\n\n88.\nIn the case of\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and\nothers Vs. State of Orissa and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\nSCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of\nIndia held that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed\nearlier, permitted regularisation of regular appointments and not\nillegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the\nappointments in the instant case could be described as illegal and if\nthey were not, whether the State could be directed to regularise the\nservices of the degree-holder Junior Engineers who have worked as\nad hoc Assistant Engineers for such a long period, not only on the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nanalogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation but also on the\nprinciple underlying para 53 of the decision in Umadevi (3) case\n[\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] .\n\n43.As to what would constitute an irregular appointment is no\nlonger res integra. The decision of this Court in State of Karnataka v.\n\nM.L. Kesari [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has\nexamined that question and explained the principle regarding\nregularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . The decision\n\nin that case\nsummed up the following three essentials for\nregularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten years or more,\n(2) that they have so worked in a duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court or tribunal, and\n(3) they should have possessed the minimum qualification stipulated\nfor the appointment. Subject to these three requirements being\nsatisfied, even if the appointment process did not involve open\ncompetitive selection, the appointment would be treated irregular\nand not illegal and thereby qualify for regularisation.\n\nPara 7 in this\nregard is apposite and may be extracted at this stage: (\nM.L. Kesari\n\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250)\n“7.\n\nIt is evident from the above that there is an exception to the\ngeneral principles against ‘regularisation’ enunciated in\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in a duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of\nthe interim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments will be\nconsidered to be illegal. But where the person employed possessed\nthe prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctioned\nposts, but had been selected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are considered to be\nirregular.”\n\n89. It is important to cite the case of\nSECRETARY TO\nGOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI\nv. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.\n[ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. In\nparagraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as\nfollows:\n\n“8.this Court in\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal & Ors.\n, AIR\n2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of regularisation of irregular\nor part-time appointments in all possible eventualities and laid down\nwell-settled principles relating to regularisation and parity in pay\nrelevant in the context of the issues involved therein. The same are\nas under:\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution will not issue directions for regularisation, absorption or\npermanent continuance, unless the employees claiming regularisation\nhad been appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\naccordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process,\nagainst sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause contained in\n\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed and Courts should\nnot issue a direction for regularisation of services of an employee\nwhich would be violative of the constitutional scheme. While\nsomething that is irregular for want of compliance with one of the\nelements in the process of selection which does not go to the root of\nthe process, can be regularised, back door entries, appointments\ncontrary to the constitutional scheme and/or appointment of\nineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or daily-\n\nwage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the court,\nwould not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into service, as\nsuch service would be “litigious employment”. Even temporary, ad\nhoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years, let alone\nservice for one or two years, will not entitle such employee to claim\nregularisation, if he is not working against a sanctioned post.\nSympathy and sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for passing any\norder of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation with a cut-\noff date (that is a scheme providing that persons who had put in a\nspecified number of years of service and continuing in employment\nas on the cut-off date), it is not possible to others who were\nappointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or contend that\nthe scheme should be applied to them by extending the cut-off date\nor seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthey are not working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot be\na direction for absorption, regularisation or permanent continuance of\npart-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run institutions\ncannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of the\nGovernment on the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can\nemployees in private employment, even if serving full time, seek\nparity in salary with government employees. The right to claim a\nparticular salary against the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n90. Reiterating the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nCase of\nSecretary to Government, School Education Department,\nChennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014)\n4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically ruled\nthat the High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India will not issue directions for regularization,\nabsorption or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\nclaiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\nrecruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\nprocess against sanctioned vacant posts, the equality clause\ncontained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed and\nCourts should not issue a direction for regularization of services of an\nemployee which would be violative of the Constitutional scheme.\n\n91.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and\nOthers\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph (25) & (26) are\nextracted hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid decisions of this\nCourt. The principle as has been\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nhas also been applied in relation to the persons who were working on\ndaily wages. According to us, the daily wagers are not appointees in\nthe strict sense of the term “appointment”. They do not hold a post.\nThe scheme of alternative appointment framed for regular employees\nof abolished organisation cannot, therefore, confer a similar\nentitlement on the daily wagers of abolished organisation to such\nalternative employment.\n\n(See\nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n\n[(2006) 4 SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in the\ncontext of appointment arose by reason of the concept of\nregularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\n, their position continued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on\ndaily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post according to the\nrules. Usually, the projects in which the daily wagers were engaged,\nhaving come to an end, their appointment is necessarily terminated\nfor want of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers of\na government concern are not equivalent to that of a government\nservant and his claim to permanency has to be adjudged differently.\n\n26.In these circumstances, in our considered opinion, the\nregularisation/absorption is not a matter of course. It would depend\nupon the facts of the case following the rules and regulations and\ncannot be dehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the above two\nparagraphs are running contrary to the legal principles settled by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, the\nrules\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution Bench to be\napplied in respect of\nthe above case\ncited.\n\n93.\nIn the case of\nMalathi Das and Others, Vs. Suresh\nand Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and the relevant\nparagraph (13) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is wholly unnecessary\nfor us to consider as to whether the cases of persons who were\nawaiting regularisation on the date of the decision in\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] is required to be dealt with in accordance with the\nconditions stipulated in para 53 of\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] inasmuch as the\nclaims of the respondent employees can well be decided on principles\nof parity.\n\nSimilarly placed employees having been regularised by the\nState and in case of some of them such regularisation being after the\ndecision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that the stand taken\nby the appellants in refusing regularisation to the respondents cannot\nbe countenanced.\n\nHowever, as the said stand of the appellants stems\nfrom their perception and understanding of the decision in\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for contempt but make it clear\nthat the appellants and all the other competent authorities of the\nState will now be obliged and duty-bound to regularise the services\nof the respondents (74 in number) which will now be done forthwith\nand in any case within a period of two months from the date of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nreceipt of this order.”\n\n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again taken a\ndeviation in respect of the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Therefore, such\ndeviation to be held as denuded of their status as precedent, as\nlaid\ndown in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution Bench.\n\n95.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar and\nOthers\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in paragraph (11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n“11.Elaborating upon the principles\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3)\ncase [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and explaining the\ndifference between irregular and illegal appointments in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] , this Court held as under: (\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247\n: (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the\ngeneral principles against ‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3)\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following conditions\nare fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued against\nsanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments will be\nconsidered to be illegal. But where the person employed possessed\nthe prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctioned\nposts, but had been selected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are considered to be\nirregular.”\n\n14.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case that\nthe appellant has served the University for more than 29 years on\nthe post of night guard and that he has served the College on daily\nwages, in the interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-\n\n2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post as per the direction of\nthe Registrar).\"\n\n96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the appellant has served in\nthe University for more than 29 years in the post of night guard and\nthat he has served the College on daily wages, in the interest of\njustice, the authorities are directed to regularise the services of the\nappellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia has deviated the principles\nlaid down in\n“Umadevi Case”.\nThus, this Court has to derive an opinion that the decision would be\ndenuded of its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this Court\nhas to independently apply the legal principles settled by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n98.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram Vs. Managing Director,\nUttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and Others\n,\nreported in (2015) 11 SCC 255, undoubtedly, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has decided the case based on the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. However, on a plain reading of the\njudgment, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles settled\nby the Constitution Bench has not been considered by the Hon'ble\nTwo Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Thus, this\nCourt is not inclined to follow the judgment for the purpose of\ndeciding the case on hand.\n\n99.\nIn the case of\nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs.\nGreater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Others\n,\nreported in (2015) 14 SCC 382, while, the Supreme Court of\nIndia in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n“13.Considering the facts of the present case on the\ntouchstone\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen\nthat the Division Bench was not right in setting aside the\nappointment of the appellants. More so, it was nobody's case\nchallenging the appointment of the appellants. Admittedly, the\nappellants were engaged as contractual employees from 1994 and\nhave completed more than ten years of continuous service with\nRespondent 1. They continued in service not by the orders of the\nCourt/Tribunal, but by the decision of the respondents. The\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappellants were regularised as per the policy decision dated 16-4-\n2003 taken by Respondent 1 and approved by the State Government\nvide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of the appellants\nwere made pursuant to the policy of regularisation, the High Court\nwas not right in quashing the appointment of the appellants as the\nsame were never in question before the High Court. The plea that\nwas raised by the appellants was only to seek regularisation with\nretrospective effect from 20-11-2002 and the consequential\nseniority.”\n\n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken note of the one time\nbenefit granted by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment in “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles settled\nin paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and 54 of the judgment\nhas not been considered by their Lordships. Since the legal principles\nenunciated in the above paragraphs of the Constitution Bench has\nnot been considered and the case was decided based on the\nparticular facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is not bound\nto consider it as a “binding precedent” as enumerated in the first\nportion of this Judgment. This Court has earlier considered the\nnature of the “binding precedents” and the interpretation of binding\nprecedents as enumerated by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the recent case of\nNational Insurance\nCo. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n, reported in [JT 2017 10\nSC 450] cited supra.\n\n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to find out\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthat those cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India were decided based on certain facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, all those circumstances and the legal\nprinciples were well settled by the Constitution Bench in “Umadevi\nCase”. Various paragraphs of the Constitution Bench judgment as\ndiscussed above made it very clear that all the circumstances arisen\nout of the temporary/casual/daily wages employees were dealt with\nelaborately and a findings are provided. This being the factum of the\ncase, this Court is not inclined to follow the above judgment of the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as\na “binding precedent” and this Court is bound by the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” which remains\nas the law of the land under\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board Vs.\nRanjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“17.A combined reading of the aforementioned paragraphs would\nclearly indicate that what the Constitution Bench had in mind in\ndirecting regularisation was in relation to such appointments, which\nwere irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is explicit. It has\nbeen so pointed out in\nNational Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n\n[(2006) 5 SCC 493 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms:\n\n(SCC pp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe respondents that the appointments were irregular and not illegal,\ncannot be accepted for more than one reason. They were appointed\nonly on the basis of their applications. The Recruitment Rules were\nnot followed. Even the Selection Committee had not been properly\nconstituted. In view of the ban on employment, no recruitment was\npermissible in law. The reservation policy adopted by the appellant\nhad not been maintained. Even cases of minorities had not been\ngiven due consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing regularisation of the\nservices only of those employees whose appointments were irregular\nas explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC\n1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979)\n4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] wherein this Court observed:\n\n[Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , SCC p.\n24, para 16]\n‘16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 :\n\n1980 SCC (L&S) 4] this Court clearly held that the words “regular” or\n“regularisation” do not connote permanence and cannot be construed\nso as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of appointments.\nThey are terms calculated to condone any procedural irregularities\nand are meant to cure only such defects as are attributable to\nmethodology followed in making the appointments.’\n\n25. Judged by the standards\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the\naforementioned decisions, the appointments of the respondents are\nillegal.\n\nThey do not, thus, have any legal right to continue in service.”\n(See also\nState of M.P. v. Yogesh Chandra Dubey\n[(2006) 8 SCC 67 :\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSCC (L&S) 1797] and State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (2006) 12 Scale 642] .)”\n\n103. The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India has dealt with the interpretation of paragraphs 16, 17,\n19 and 22 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17), (19)\nand (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC\n507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] this Court clearly held\nthat the words “regular” or “regularisation” do not connote\npermanence and cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the\nnature of tenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to\ncondone any procedural irregularities and are meant to cure only\nsuch defects as are attributable to methodology followed in making\nthe appointments. This Court emphasised that when rules framed\nunder\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution are in force, no regularisation is\npermissible in exercise of the executive powers of the Government\nunder\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution in contravention of the rules.\n\nThese decisions and the principles recognised therein have not been\ndissented to by this Court and on principle, we see no reason not to\naccept the proposition as enunciated in the above decisions. We\nhave, therefore, to keep this distinction in mind and proceed on the\nbasis that only something that is irregular for want of compliance\nwith one of the elements in the process of selection which does not\ngo to the root of the process, can be regularised and that it alone can\nbe regularised and granting permanence of employment is a totally\ndifferent concept and cannot be equated with regularisation.\n\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional scheme of public\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment in this country, and the executive, or for that matter the\ncourt, in appropriate cases, would have only the right to regularise an\nappointment made after following the due procedure, even though a\nnon-fundamental element of that process or procedure has not been\nfollowed. This right of the executive and that of the court would not\nextend to the executive or the court being in a position to direct that\nan appointment made in clear violation of the constitutional scheme,\nand the statutory rules made in that behalf, can be treated as\npermanent or can be directed to be treated as permanent.\n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also controlled by\neconomic considerations and financial implications of any public\nemployment. The viability of the department or the instrumentality of\nthe project is also of equal concern for the State. The State works\nout the scheme taking into consideration the financial implications\nand the economic aspects. Can the court impose on the State a\nfinancial burden of this nature by insisting on regularisation or\npermanence in employment, when those employed temporarily are\nnot needed permanently or regularly? As an example, we can\nenvisage a direction to give permanent employment to all those who\nare being temporarily or casually employed in a public sector\nundertaking. The burden may become so heavy by such a direction\nthat the undertaking itself may collapse under its own weight. It is\nnot as if this had not happened. So, the court ought not to impose a\nfinancial burden on the State by such directions, as such directions\nmay turn counterproductive.\n\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question whether the\njettisoning of the constitutional scheme of appointment can be\napproved, was not considered or decided. The distinction emphasised\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin\nR.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2\nSCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The Court appears to have been\ndealing with a scheme for “equal pay for equal work” and in the\nprocess, without an actual discussion of the question, had approved a\nscheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously at the direction\nof the Court, to order permanent absorption of such daily-rated\nworkers. With respect to the learned judges, the decision cannot be\nsaid to lay down any law, that all those engaged on daily wages,\ncasually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or vacancy existed\nand without following the rules of selection, should be absorbed or\nmade permanent though not at a stretch, but gradually. If that were\nthe ratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n104.\nIn the case of\nPost Master General, Kolkata and\nOthers Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported in (2007) 5 SCC 317,\nparagraphs (5) & (18) are relevant and the same are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction, although the case\nof Niva Ghosh was allegedly considered, her case was not,\nwhereupon a contempt petition was filed. In the said contempt\nproceedings, a stand was taken by the appellant that she had not\ncompleted a period of 240 days in a year before the said cut-off date.\nThe said contempt petition was dismissed with liberty to the\nrespondent to file a fresh original application. Pursuant to the said\nobservations, the respondent filed an application before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which was marked\nas OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n18.There are two distinctive features in the present case,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhich are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot be invoked\nwhere any illegality has been committed or where no legal right is\nestablished.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having completed 240\ndays, does not fulfil the requisite criteria. A disputed question of fact\nhas been raised. The High Court did not come to a positive finding\nthat she had worked for more than 240 days in a year.”\n\n105.\nIn the case of\nC.Balachandran and Others Vs. State\nof Kerala and Others\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610,\nwherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India interpreted the scope of\nparagraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (17) & (18)\nof\nthe said judgment\nand the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n“17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon the observations\nmade in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nwhich reads as under: (SCC p. 42, para 53)\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where\nirregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in\n\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1\nSCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\nand B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980\nSCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and\nthe employees have continued to work for ten years or more but\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The\nquestion of regularisation of the services of such employees may\nhave to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nby this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of this\njudgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State Governments\nand their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-\ntime measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further\nensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant\nsanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where\ntemporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The\nprocess must be set in motion within six months from this date. We\nalso clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub\njudice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there\nshould be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and\nregularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per\nthe constitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality and was not sub\njudice would not come within the purview of exception to the rule\ncontained in Para 53 of\nthe said judgment\n. The appellants' case,\nthus, does not come within the purview thereof. Only those cases\nwhere regularisations had already been made were not to be\nreopened. It is not in dispute that services of the appellants were\nterminated as far back as in 1987 and they did not question the\nlegality or validity of the said order.\n\nIt is only after the decision of this\nCourt in\nJacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991)\n15 ATC 697] that representations were filed. Such representations\nwere rejected both by the Kerala Water Authority as also the State of\nKerala.\n\n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither in law nor in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nequity were entitled to be reinstated in service. The decision of this\nCourt in\nJacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991)\n15 ATC 697] being not applicable to the case of the appellants, we\nare bound by the\nratio\nlaid down in\nUmadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] . So far as Para 53 of the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench in the said case is concerned, the same has been\nconsidered by this Court in a large number of decisions.\n\nIn\nPunjab\nWater Supply & Sewerage Board v. Ranjodh Singh\n[(2007) 2 SCC 491\n: (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para 15)\n“15.\n\nThe question came up for consideration before a Constitution\nBench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] wherein it was held that no person\nwho was temporarily or casually been employed could be directed to\nbe continued permanently.\n\nIt was opined that by doing so it would be\ncreating another mode of public employment which is not\npermissible.”\n[See\nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn. Ltd.\n[(2006) 6\nSCC 310 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar\nVerma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (\n2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master\nGeneral v. Tutu Das (Dutta\n) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S)\n179] .]”\n\n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the judgment,\nis well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India as cited above, this Court is not inclined to\nconsider the other judgments referred by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner. However, on a perusal of all these judgments cited supra,\nthis Court is of the opinion that ultimately the legal principle settled in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nby the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is binding over\nthe subject and the same is to be followed scrupulously by all the\nCourts across the country and the same becomes the law of the land\nin the matter of regularization, permanent absorption and\nappointment.\n\n107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of the case\non hand, it remains that the writ petitioners were appointed as daily\nrated employees for a particular period and, this Court has to draw an\ninference that all the Government orders passed subsequent to the\nConstitution Bench Judgment, if runs contrary to the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench, would become invalid and the\nsame cannot be implemented or followed. In other words, it is to be\nnoted that the Government has no authority to issue any orders\ngranting regularization, permanent absorption or appointment in\nviolation of the Constitutional schemes and in violation of the\nrecruitment rules in force. The power of the Government in this\nregard is certainly abrogated by the principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”. Such being the factum\nof the case, the State Government is to be precluded as well as its\nauthority are to be regularized in respect of appointing employees in\ncontravention with the recruitment rules in force and effecting\nappointments through back doors.\n\n108. This Court has to place on record that the State is bound\nto over see the appointments made in this regard illegally or\nirregularly by the competent authorities and the same is to be\nconstrued as the fraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nliable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal Rules and other\nrelevant rules. The State shall be vigilant in this regard and the\nauthorities indulging in such activities of exercising powers by issuing\nillegal or irregular appointments are to be booked under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by the State\nin this regard, since these all are the Constitutional principles\nrequired for the State to be followed and the State being a modal\nemployer, has to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\nprinciples scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in\nparagraph (15) of the judgment in “Umadevi Case”, the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that a\ndistinction between regularisation and conferment of permanent\nstatus in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This Court is of the\nopinion that the conferment of permanent status Act, is a general law\napplicable to the employees, in the absence of any special law\ngoverning the particular subject. However, if any such law prevails\nand covering the field of appointment of regularisation and\npermanent absorption, then the general law would not apply. In\nnutshell, the special law and rules will prevail over the general law\nand the special rules in force are to be applied in the relevant case.\n\n110. In view of the discussions made above, this Court is of\nthe opinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for any relief of\npermanent absorption as such sought for in this writ petition.”\n\n6.In view of the legal principles discussed in the aforesaid paragraphs and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njudgments, this Court has no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the\n\norder impugned is passed in consonance with the legal principles and there is no\n\ninfirmity as such.\n\n7.Accordingly, the writ petition is devoid of merits and stands dismissed.\n\nHowever, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n14.03.2019\n\nkak\n\nInternet:Yes/No\nIndex:Yes/No\nSpeaking/Non-Speaking order\n\nTo\n\n1.The Secretary,\nHigher Education Department\nFort St.George, Chennai – 9.\n\n2.The Director of Technical Education,\nGuindy, Chennai – 25\n\n3.The Chief Engineer\nTechnical Education Department\nGuindy, Chennai – 25.\n\n4.The Executive Engineer, P.W.D\nTechnical Education Division,\nChennai -25.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nS.M.SUBRAMANIAM, J.\n\nkak\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nW.P.No.18499 of 2018\n\n14.03.2019\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in",
