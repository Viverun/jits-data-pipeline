The aforesaid judgment was affirmed by this Court vide\n\nits order dated 03.08.2023 wherein in para-25 (page No.50), it was\n\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"25. Therefore, as the foundation of the order passed by the\nlearned Tribunal, subject matter of these writ petitions, was the\njudgment of this Court in Narender Singh Naik's case (supra),\nwhich judgment itself was based on the Five Judge Bench\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Direct Recruit's case\n(supra), and as the learned Tribunal rightly held that the services\nrendered by the original applicants on contract basis were liable to\nbe counted for the purpose of seniority and consequential benefits\nafter their regularization, as the initial appointment of the original\napplicants on contract basis was after following the procedure\nprescribed in the Recruitment & Promotion Rules, we do not find\nany infirmity in the said findings and further as we do not find any\nmerit in the writ petitions, the same are dismissed by upholding\nthe order passed by the learned Tribunal. No order as to costs.\n\nPending miscellaneous applications, if any, stand disposed of.\"\n\n4. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the\n\nrespondents had filed SLP before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which\n\ncame to be dismissed on 04.12.2023.\n\n5. This execution petition was filed in March 2024 and the\n\nrespondents have now filed the compliance affidavit dated 26 th\n\nOctober, 2024, claiming that the judgment in question, has been\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\ncomplied with by placing on record a copy of the Notification dated\n\n26.10.2024, which reads as under:\n\n\"Government of Himachal Pradesh\nDepartment of Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs.\n\nNo. FDS-B(2)-5/2024-1 Dated:- Shimla-171002, the 26th\nOctober, 2024.\n\nNOTIFICATION\n\nIn compliance to the orders passed by the Hon'ble High Court\nof Himachal Pradesh on 03-08-2023 in CWP No. 2004 of\n2017 titled\n-Taj Mohammad & others versus State of Himachal\nPradesh & others\na/w CWP No. 629/2018-titled\nState of\nHimachal Pradesh & others versus Lekh Ram & others\nand\norders passed in Execution Petition (T) No. 79/2024-titled as\n\nLekh Ram versus State of Himachal Pradesh & another\non\n24-06-2024, 30-07-2024, 27-08-2024, 03-10-2024 and 15-10-\n2024, the Governor of Himachal Pradesh, on the\nrecommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee\nheld on 23-10-2024 in the Himachal Pradesh Public Service\nCommission, is pleased to order the promotion of the\nfollowing Inspector Grade-I, working in the Department of\nFood Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs to the post of Food\nand Supplies Officer (Class-II, Non Gazetted) in the pay scale\nof 10300-34800+5000 GP (PRE-REVISED), on regular basis,\nwith immediate effect:-\n\nSr.No Name of the official\n1.

The posting order of the above promoted\nFood and Supplies Officer will be issued\nseparately.\"\n\n6. The respondent-department was asked to justify as to\n\nhow the decree-holders/petitioners were being promoted\n\nprospectively with effect from 26.10.2024 when the erstwhile\n\nTribunal while allowing the Original Application filed by the\n\npetitioners had directed the respondents to consider the cases of the\n\nrespective petitioners for grant of seniority as Inspector Grade-I over\n\nand above private respondents No. 3 to 23 and had further directed\n\nthem to count their entire service, irrespective whether it was\n\nrendered on contract basis and subsequently on regular basis,\n\ntowards seniority alongwith all consequential benefits, which\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nincluded promotions. However, the respondents were not in a\n\nposition to justify their action and accordingly this Court proceeded\n\nto order to issue a notice of contempt against the Principal Secretary\n\n(Food, Civil Supply & Consumer Affairs) to the Government of\n\nHimachal Pradesh to show as to why he should not be punished and\n\nprosecuted for deliberately and willfully misleading this Court and\n\nthereby committing contempt of Court, in the earlier part of the day,\n\non 27.11.2024.\n\n7. Later, the learned Advocate General appeared and\n\nprayed for an adjournment on the ground that he wanted to cite\n\ncertain judgments to justify the action of the State. This Court\n\nacceded to the request of the learned Advocate General only on the\n\ncondition that in case the contentions of the State are not accepted,\n\nthen the concerned Principal Secretary would be liable to pay the\n\ncosts quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- which would be paid by him from\n\nhis own pocket.\n\n8. When the matter was taken up on 28.11.2024, the\n\nlearned Advocate General, at the outset, stated that he was ready\n\nto abide by the terms of the order passed on 27.11.2024 and he\n\nwould argue the case and accordingly we proceeded to hear the\n\narguments.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n9. It is vehemently argued by the learned Advocate\n\nGeneral that the action of the respondents is in accordance with law,\n\nrules and instructions applicable which clearly provide that there is\n\nnothing known as retrospective promotion and the promotions, if\n\nany, can only be made after holding the DPC, which essentially\n\nmeans, that the promotions have to be made from the prospective\n\neffect.\n\n10.\nIn support of his contention, the learned Advocate\n\nGeneral has\nplaced reliance upon\n\nUnion of India and others vs.\n\nN.C. Murali and others\n(2017) 13 SCC 575 wherein the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that unless there is specific rule entitling the\n\napplicants to receive promotions from the date of occurrence of\n\nvacancy, right of promotion does not crystallise on the date of\n\noccurrence of vacancy and promotion is to be extended on date it is\n\nactually effected.\n\n11. However, we find that the ratio of the aforesaid\n\njudgment is not at all applicable to the facts of the instant case.\nIn\n\nN.C. Murali\n's case (supra), the facts before the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt were that the respondents were employed as Geophysicists in\n\nGeological Survey of India. The post of Assistant Geophysicists was\n\na Group B post and next grade in the said cadre was the post of\n\nGeophysicists (Jr.) Group A. The promotion of Assistant\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nGeophysicists was by two modes i.e by direct recruitment and by\n\npromotion through UPSC with ratio of 1:1. There were large number\n\nof posts of Geophysicists (Jr.) lying vacant from 1984 till 1998\n\ntotalling 31 in number. Due to various reasons, no DPC could take\n\nplace for effecting the promotions in the Group A post. Subsequently,\n\nthe DPC met and promotions were effected with effect from 2001.\n\nThe respondents and various intervenors were considered and\n\npromotion orders were issued.\n\n12. However, before the aforesaid promotion could take\n\nplace, the respondents filed O.A. No. 119 of 2000 in the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal in January 2001 praying for direction to the\n\nMinistry of Finance to revalidate and fill up the vacancies of the post\n\nof Geophysicists and further to convert the direct recruits quota into\n\nthe DPC quota as one-time measure and fill the existing posts.\n\nDuring the pendency of the O.A., DPC was convened on 30-10-\n\n2001. The Tribunal decided the matter ultimately vide its order dated\n\n13-11-2003. The Tribunal noticed the fact that DPC had been held.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, did not accept the prayer of the applicants\n\nwith regard to conversion of direct recruitment quota. However, the\n\nTribunal to meet the ends of justice directed that the applicants be\n\nadjusted against the unfilled vacancies of respective years when\n\nDPC was not held. The Tribunal directed pro forma promotion to the\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nGeophysicists according to the seniority and eligibility with\n\nretrospective effect against the vacancies of the respective years\n\nwhen they qualified for those posts.\n\n13. It shall be apt to reproduce para-5 of the directions\n\nissued by the Tribunal which reads as under:\n\n\"Therefore, with a view to protect their seniority, we direct\nthat pro forma promotion should be given to the\nGeophysicists on their promotion, according to their\nseniority and eligibility with retrospective effect, adjusting\nthem against the vacancies of the respective years when\nthey qualified for these posts. In order to protect their\nconsequential benefits in future promotions as per seniority\nand eligibility, accruing to them on giving them such\nretrospective seniority, we also direct the respondents to\nreallocate them with notional promotions for respective\nyears when they would have got these promotions but for\nDPC not being held, which was denied to them due to no\nfault of theirs by not holding the DPCs for the respective\nyears. As regards one-time adjustment against the direct\nrecruitment quota, it would be unfair, since as per the\ncontentions of the applicants themselves, direct recruitment\nas per the vacancies in the quota had also not taken place.\nTherefore, such a step need not be taken. However, it would\nbe fair and just that against the DPC quota, the officers, who\nhad missed their promotions during the respective years\nwhen it was due and when they were qualified and eligible\nfor it, it is directed to be given to them on notional basis.\nThey, on promotion, may be allocated to the respective\nyears of seniority through pro forma promotion of respective\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nyears, which would have been due to them had the DPC\nbeen held regularly for those respective years and in case\nthey were eligible and qualified and found fit for the same.\"\n\n14. Aggrieved by the judgment passed by the Tribunal, the\n\nUnion of India filed a writ petition before the High Court which was,\n\nhowever, dismissed constraining the Union of India to file an appeal\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n15. The ratio of the aforesaid judgment is not applicable to\n\nthe facts of the instant case as this Court being an executing Court\n\nis legally bound to implement the order sought to be executed, more\n\nparticularly, when it has attained finality upto the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt. Here, the petitioners-decree holders are only seeking the\n\nexecution of the judgment and not claiming any so-called\n\nretrospective promotions but promotions strictly in accordance with\n\nthe order passed by the Tribunal as affirmed upto the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court.\n\n16. The learned Advocate General has then relied upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion of India and\n\nothers vs. Chaman Rana\n(2018) 5 SCC 798 to argue that there\n\ncan be no retrospective promotions after such a belated passage of\n\ntime as this would virtually bring a tsunami in the service resulting in\n\nadministrative chaos quite apart from financial implications to the\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\ngovernment. In particular, he has relied upon para-16 of the\n\njudgment which reads as under:\n\n\"16. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, any\ndirection to consider retrospective promotion of the\nrespondents at such a belated passage of time of over 17 to\n20 years, would virtually bring a tsunami in the service\nresulting in administrative chaos quite apart from the\nfinancial implications for the Government. The order of the\nHigh Court is therefore held to be unsustainable and is set\naside.\"\n\n17. In order to appreciate this judgment, we would have to\n\nlook into the facts of the case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nChaman Rana\n's case (supra) was dealing with a common order\n\ndated 05.05.2017 whereby the Union of India had been directed to\n\nconsider the case of the respondents for promotion with\n\nretrospective effect from the date their juniors had been promoted\n\nalong with all consequential benefits. The respondents in the two\n\nwrit petitions were superseded in the years 1996 and 2000,\n\nrespectively. Both of them were subsequently promoted on\n\n28.11.1997 and 16.06.2003 as Second-in-Command and\n\nCommandant, respectively. Subsequently, both of them submitted\n\nseveral representations for promotion from the date of supersession.\n\nOrders rejecting the representations, along with reasons, were duly\n\ncommunicated to them more than once.\n\nAfter the pronouncement in\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nSukhdev Singh v. Union of India (2013) 9 SCC 566, affirming\nDev\n\nDutt v. Union of India\n(2008) 8 SCC 725, separate writ petitions were\n\nfiled by them on 25.09.2016. The common plea taken was that the\n\nentry \"good\" in their Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the\n\nrelevant years was an adverse remark in view of the benchmark of\n\n\"very good\". Since the adverse entry had not been communicated to\n\nthem, it could not be taken into consideration requiring\n\nreconsideration for promotion from the date of their supersession. It\n\nwas in this background that the Hon'ble Supreme Court made the\n\naforesaid observations.\n\n18. How the ratio of this judgment would apply to the facts\n\nof the instant case is beyond our comprehension as the learned\n\nAdvocate General has failed to take into consideration that this\n\nCourt is not dealing with the Original Application filed by the\n\npetitioners, but is enforcing the decree, as has been passed by the\n\nTribunal, which as observed above, has been affirmed upto the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n19. All the arguments addressed by the learned Advocate\n\nGeneral are in total ignorance of the well known principles of\n\nrestitution, which amongst others, clearly provides that the act of the\n\nCourt shall prejudice no-one. The principle of restitution is founded\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\non the ideal of doing complete justice at the end of litigation and\n\nparties have to be placed in the same position but for the litigation\n\nand interim order, if any, passed in the matter, no party can take\n\nadvantage of litigation. It has to disgorge the advantage gained due\n\nto delay in case lis is lost. The interim order passed by the Court\n\nmerges into a final decision. The validity of an interim order passed\n\nin favour of a party stands reversed in the event of a final order\n\ngoing against the party successful at the interim stage.\n\n20. As observed above, the rule is based upon the\n\nprinciples of justice, equity and fair play. The Court has inherent\n\njurisdiction to order restitution so as to do complete justice,\n\nespecially, when it is executing the order as it stands. This is also on\n\nthe principle that a wrong order should not be perpetuated by\n\nkeeping it alive and respecting it. What attracts applicability of\n\nrestitution is not the act of the Court being wrongful or mistake or an\n\nerror committed by the Court; the test is whether, on account of an\n\nact of the party persuading the Court to pass an order held at the\n\nend as not sustainable, resulting in one party gaining an advantage\n\nwhich it would not have otherwise earned, or the other party having\n\nsuffered an impoverishment, restitution has to be made.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n21. Litigation cannot be permitted to be a productive\n\nindustry nor can litigation be reduced to gaming where there is an\n\nelement of chance in every case. If the concept of restitution is\n\nexcluded from application to interim orders, then the litigant would\n\nstand to gain by swallowing the benefits yielding out of the interim\n\norder. The word \"restitution\" in its etymological sense means\n\nrestoring to a party on the modification, variation or reversal of a\n\ndecree or order, what has been lost to him in execution of decree or\n\norder of the Court or in direct consequence of a decree or order. In\n\nlaw, the term \"restitution\" is used in three senses :\n\n(i) return or restoration of some specific thing to its rightful\nowner or status;\n\n(ii) compensation for benefits derived from a wrong done to\nanother; and\n\n(iii) compensation or reparation for the loss caused to\nanother.\n\n22. The principle that an undeserved or unfair benefits\n\ndrawn by a party under the interim order of the Court cannot be\n\nretained and must be restituted is well acknowledged by law.\n\nReference in this regard can be made to a judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nAmarjeet Singh and others vs. Devi Ratan and\n\nothers\n2010 (1) SCC 417. The facts before the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt as reproduced in paras 2 to 7 of the judgment are as under:\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n\"2. The facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals\nare that the appellants and respondents in these cases were\nappointed as Excise Inspectors under the provisions of U.P.\nExcise Service (Class-II) Rules, 1970 (hereinafter called as\n\"the Rules 1970\"). The parties became eligible for\nconsideration for promotion to the post of Superintendent of\nExcise under the said Rules, 1970. The criteria of promotion\nfor the post of Superintendent of Excise and for higher post\nof Assistant Excise Commissioner (hereinafter called \"AEC\")\nhad been \"merit\" under the provisions of U.P. Assistant\nExcise Commissioners Service Rules, 1992 (hereinafter\ncalled as `the Rules 1992'). The said rules stood amended\nw.e.f. 10.10.1994 and the criteria for promotion was changed\nfrom `merit' to `seniority subject to rejection of unfit.\"\n\n3.The Appellant Amarjeet Singh alongwith some other\nExcise Inspectors filed writ petition No. 1113(SB) of 1994\nbefore the Allahabad High Court challenging the selection\nprocess for promotion under Rules 1992. The High Court\nvide judgment and order dated 1.2.1995 held that the\nvacancies which had come into existence prior to\n10.10.1994 i.e. the date of amendment, be filled up as per\nthe unamended Rules i.e. on the basis of \"merit\" and not on\nthe basis of \"seniority subject to rejection of unfit.\"\n\n4. Being aggrieved, the State of U.P. preferred the Special\nLeave Petition before this Court and this Court vide Order\ndated 30.10.1995 passed an interim Order permitting the\nState Authorities to make promotions as per 1994\namendment Rules but it was subject to the result of the\npetition as this Court made it clear that if petition was\ndismissed, the respondents would be reverted to the lower\npost from which they would be promoted. In view of the said\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\ninterim order of this Court, 61 Excise Inspectors stood\npromoted, subject to the final outcome of the Special Leave\nPetition. This Court dismissed the said Special Leave\nPetition vide Order dated 19.8.1999 in limine. However, the\nState Authorities for the reasons best known to them, did not\nrevert the promoted officers and they continued to hold the\nhigher posts.\n\n5. The Departmental Promotional Committee (hereinafter\ncalled the DPC) meant for filling up the 42 vacancies, which\ncame into existance prior to 10.10.1994, met on 19.12.1998.\n\nAfter scanning the service records and determining the inter\nse merit of the candidates, the Committee came to the\nconclusion that only 30 candidates were suitable for\npromotion to the posts of AEC and they were to be promoted\nas per the availability of yearwise vacancies. The\nrespondents, herein, were found unsuitable for promotion in\nthe said selection process. After completing the aforesaid\nexercise, 12 vacancies for the post of AEC remained\nunfilled. Therefore, the 12 vacancies were carried forward to\nenable the State Authorities to fill up the same under the\namended Rules on a different criteria i.e. \"Seniority subject\nto rejection of unfit\". Thus twelve officers/respondents were\npromoted under the amended rules by the another DPC held\non 22.1.1999.\n\n6. The State Government issued the Order dated 15.5.1999\nreverting all Excise Inspectors promoted on 6.12.1995 under\nthe interim order of this Court and gave notional promotions\nwith retrospective effect to appellants as well as all the\nreverted officers/respondents. As a consequence, a seniority\nlist dated 12.7.2000, was issued, wherein the appellants\nwere placed over and above the respondents.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n7. Being aggrieved, the respondents approached the High\nCourt challenging the said seniority list dated 12.7.2000. The\nHigh Court vide impugned judgment and order dated\n11.4.2002 held that as the postings to both set of officers i.e.\nthose who had been promoted by the DPC dated\n19.12.1998 and another DPC dated 22.1.1999 had been\nmade on the same day and had been given notional\npromotion from one and the same date, their inter se\nseniority was to be fixed as it existed in the feeding cadre of\nExcise Inspectors and thus quashed the seniority list dated\n12.7.2000 and further directed the State to prepare a fresh\nseniority list placing the appellants below the respondents.\nHence these appeals.\"\n\n23. In the context of these facts, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt observed as under:-\n\n\"16. In view of the fact that the respondents continued on a\nhigher post under the orders of this Court for years together\nand even after dismissal of the petition filed by the State,\nand the exercise for making promotions was not undertaken\nby the State Authorities, the appellants should not suffer for\nno fault of theirs. It has fairly been conceded by learned\ncounsel appearing for the respondents that had the exercise\nof making promotions been undertaken immediately after the\norder of this Court dated 19.8.1998, the appellants could\nhave been promoted much earlier and they could have been\nsenior to the respondents. Thus the question does arise as\nto whether appellants should be asked to suffer for the\ninterim order passed by this Court in a case having no merits\nat all.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n17. No litigant can derive any benefit from mere pendency of\ncase in a Court of Law, as the interim order always merges\nin the final order to be passed in the case and if the writ\npetition is ultimately dismissed, the interim order stands\nnullified automatically. A party cannot be allowed to take any\nbenefit of his own wrongs by getting interim order and\nthereafter blame the Court. The fact that the writ is found,\nultimately, devoid of any merit, shows that a frivolous writ\npetition had been filed. The maxim \"Actus Curiae neminem\ngravabit\", which means that the act of the Court shall\nprejudice no-one, becomes applicable in such a case. In\nsuch a fact situation the Court is under an obligation to undo\nthe wrong done to a party by the act of the Court. Thus, any\nundeserved or unfair advantage gained by a party invoking\nthe jurisdiction of the Court must be neutralised, as\ninstitution of litigation cannot be permitted to confer any\nadvantage on a suitor from delayed action by the act of the\nCourt. (\nVide Shiv Shankar & Ors. Vs. Board of Directors,\nUttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation & Anr.\n,\n1995 Suppl.\n\n(2) SCC 726; M/s.\nGTC Industries Ltd. Vs.\nUnion of India & Ors.\n, AIR 1998 SC 1566; and\nJaipur\nMunicipal Corporation Vs. C.L. Mishra\n, (2005) 8 SCC 423).\n\n18.\nIn\nRam Krishna Verma & Ors. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors.\n,\nAIR 1992 SC 1888 this Court examined the similar issue\nwhile placing reliance upon its earlier judgment in\nGrindlays\nBank Limited Vs. Income Tax Officer, Calcutta & Ors.\n, AIR\n1980 SC 656 and held that no person can suffer from the act\nof the Court and in case an interim order has been passed\nand petitioner takes advantage thereof and ultimately the\npetition is found to be without any merit and is dismissed,\nthe interest of justice requires that any undeserved or unfair\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\nadvantage gained by a party invoking the jurisdiction of the\nCourt must be neutralized.\n\n19.\nIn\nMahadeo Savlaram Sheke & Ors. Vs. Pune Municipal\nCorporation & Anr.\n, (1995) 3 SCC 33, this Court observed\nthat while granting the interim relief, the Court in exercise of\nits discretionary power should also adopt the procedure of\ncalling upon the plaintiff to file a bond to the satisfaction of\nthe Court that in the event of his failing in the suit to obtain\nthe relief asked for in the plaint, he would adequately\ncompensate the defendant for the loss ensued due to the\norder of injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff. Even\notherwise the Court while exercising its equity jurisdiction in\ngranting injunction is also competent to grant adequate\ncompensation to mitigate the damages caused to the\ndefendant by grant of injunction. The pecuniary award of\ndamages is consequential to the adjudication of the dispute\nand the result therein is incidental to the determination of the\ncase by the Court. The Court can do so in exercise of its\ninherent jurisdiction in doing ex debito justitiae mitigating the\ndamage suffered by the defendant by the act of the Court in\ngranting injunction restraining the defendant from\nproceeding with the action complained of in the suit. Such a\nprocedure is necessary as a check on abuse of the process\nof the Court and adequately compensate the damages or\ninjury suffered by the defendant by act of the Court at the\nbehest of the plaintiff.\n\n20.\nIn\nSouth Eastern Coalfields Ltd. Vs. State of M.P. & Ors.\n,\nAIR 2003 SC 4482, this Court examined this issue in detail\nand held that no one shall suffer by an act of the Court. The\nfactor attracting applicability of restitution is not the act of the\ncourt being wrongful or a mistake or error committed by the\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\ncourt; the test is whether on account of an act of the party\npersuading the court to pass an order held at the end as not\nsustainable, has resulted in one party gaining an advantage\nit would not have otherwise earned, or the other party has\nsuffered an impoverishment which it would not have suffered\nbut for the order of the court and the act of such party. There\nis nothing wrong in the parties demanding being placed in\nthe same position in which they would have been had the\ncourt not intervened by its interim order when at the end of\nthe proceedings the court pronounces its judicial verdict\nwhich does not match with and countenance its own interim\nverdict. The injury, if any, caused by the act of the court shall\nbe undone and the gain which the party would have earned\nunless it was interdicted by the order of the court would be\nrestored to or conferred on the party by suitably\ncommanding the party liable to do so. Any opinion to the\ncontrary would lead to unjust if not disastrous\nconsequences.\n\n21.........\n\n22.Similarly in\nKarnataka Rare Earth & Anr. Vs. Senior\nGeologist, Department of Mines & Geology & Anr.\n, (2004) 2\nSCC 783, a similar view has been reiterated by this Court\nobserving that the party who succeeds ultimately is to be\nplaced in the same position in which they would have been if\nthe Court would not have passed an interim order.\"\n\n24. It is precisely what is spoken in\nAmarjeet Singh\n's case\n\n(supra) that is attracted to the facts of the present case. Here, the\n\nCourt is not deciding the lis but only executing the order of the\n\nTribunal and the said order has to be executed as it is.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n25. It again needs to be reiterated that it is the petitioners,\n\nwho had approached the Tribunal by filing Original Application\n\nwhich was duly allowed by the Tribunal. It is thereafter that the State\n\nfirst approached this Court and obtained interim orders and after\n\nhaving lost before this Court, approached the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt. Even after, losing before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the\n\nState again approached this Court with a review petition, but took no\n\nsteps to hold DPC, ostensibly, because the State held the key and\n\nwas the sole master to decide about the convening of the DPC. But,\n\nin this process, the State forgot the mandatory directions passed by the\n\nTribunal.\n\n26. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nAmarjeet\n\nSingh\n's case (supra), the law permits promotion with retrospective\n\neffect only in exceptional circumstances when there has been some\n\nlegal impediment in making the promotions, like an intervention by\n\nthe Court, as is the fact situation obtaining in the present case.\n\n27. Therefore, the State is legally bound to execute the\n\norder passed by the Tribunal as it is by granting promotions in terms\n\nthereof, be it, even from the retrospective effect.\nNeutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:13402 )\n\n28. Accordingly, the execution petition is allowed and the\n\nrespondents/judgment-debtors are directed to promote the\n\npetitioners from due date retrospectively strictly in terms of the order\n\ndated 25.05.2017 passed in O.A. No. 3337 of 2016.\n\n29. Since, the learned Advocate General has fairly stated\n\nthat the respondents herein have contested this execution petition\n\nsolely on the basis of the advice rendered by him, we deem it\n\nappropriate not to impose costs.\n\n30. Pending application(s), if any, also stands disposed of.\n\n(Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\nActing Chief Justice\n\n(Satyen Vaidya)\nJudge\n5th December, 2024.\n\n(krt)",
