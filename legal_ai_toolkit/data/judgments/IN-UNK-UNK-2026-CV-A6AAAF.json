Prayagmati Gupta\n\n ORDER\n\nPerHon'bleMr.Pankaj Kumar, Member-A\n\n In this case, several applicants have joined to challenge the\n\nseniority list brought out by the official respondents, with impleadment\n\nof several private respondents, and sought the following reliefs:\n\n (i) This Hon'ble Tribunal may kindly be pleased to quash the impugned\n seniority list dated 03.08.2021, so far it relates to applicants as well as\n private respondents vis-à-vis the alleged principle said to have been\n adopted by the respondent No. 3 in letter dated 03.08.2021, contained\n as annexure No. A-1 to O.A.\n\n (ii) To direct the respondent No. 3 to recast the seniority list dated 03\n 08.2021 from serial No. 590 to 657 by placing applicants between 589\n and 590.\n\n Page 3 of 6\n\n \nCAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of \n2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors\n.\n\n (iii) To quash the draft SOP dated 02.12.2021 and direct the respondent No.\n 3 toseek clarification/guidance/instructions from respondent 2 for\n formulating draft SOP for determination of All India seniority list of UDCs,\n contained as Annexure No. A2 to O.A.\n\n OR\n\n To direct the respondent No. 3 that the word\" same financial year of\n para 9.4 of the draft SOP dated 02 Dec, 2021 be quashed/omitted at the\n time of finalization of SOP for determination of All India seniority list of\n UDCs.\n\n OR\n\n To direct the respondent no. 3 that weight age point system for all\n completed years of service on the post of LDC be introduced at the time of\n finalization of SOP for determination of All India Seniority list of UDCs.\n\n OR\n\n To direct the respondent No. 3 to hold the DPC for the post of UDCs for\n all Command HQs at its own level after LDCE and thereafter determine\n the seniority simultaneously on the basis of marks obtained by the\n candidates under 25 % quota.\n\n (iv) To pass such other orders which are found just fit and proper under the\n circumstances of the case.\n\n (v) To allow the original application with cost.\n\n2. The issue at the admission stage is whether this original\n\napplication can be admitted with all applicants or whether only those\n\napplicants which are posted in the territorial jurisdiction of this Bench\n\ncan be part of this OA. It may be mentioned that the relief sought is with\n\nreference to the impugned seniority list dated 03.08.2021 issued by\n\nrespondent 3, viz., Engineer-in-Chief (E-in-C), Military Engineering\n\nServices (MES), New Delhi. It may also be mentioned that applicants 10\n\nand 11 are posted at Lucknow, i.e., within the territorial jurisdiction of\n\nthis Bench while other applicants are posted at stations falling in\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of other Benches.\n\n3.1 It is the contention of the learned counsel for applicants that the\n\nseniority of the applicants in the impugned all India seniority list dated\n\n03.08.2021 has got adversely affected as a result of delay in holding of\n\nthe meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) meeting by\n\nHQ, Central Command, Lucknow. Therefore, in this OA challenging the\n\n Page 4 of 6\n\n CAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of \n2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors.\n\nimpugned seniority list dated 03.08.2021 brought out by E-in-C, MES,\n\nNew Delhi, part of the cause of action as arisen in HQ, Central\n\nCommand, Lucknow owing to delay in holding DPC meeting there. As per\n\nrule 6 of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1987\n\n(Procedure Rules, hereinafter) the OA can be filed in the Bench within\n\nwhose jurisdiction the cause of action, wholly or in part, has arisen.\n\n3.2 The learned counsel for the applicants also submits that in the OA\n\nNo. 408 of 2021, decided by this Bench on 03.01.2024, applicants posted\n\nvarious jurisdictions were allowed to be joined for similar reason.\n\n4.1 Rule 6 of the Procedure Rules reads as follows:\n\n \"6. Place of filing applications.- (1) An application shall ordinarily be filed\n by an applicant with the Registrar of the Bench within whose jurisdiction -\n\n (i) the applicant is posted for the time being, or\n\n (ii) the cause of action, wholly or in part, has arisen;\n\n Provided that with the leave of the Chairman the application may be filed\n with the Registrar of the Principal Bench and subject to the orders\n under section 25, such application shall be heard and disposed of by the\n Bench which has jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (1) persons who has\n ceased to be in service by reason of retirement, dismissal or termination of\n service may be at his option file an application with the Registrar of the Bench\n within whose jurisdiction such person is ordinarily residing at the time of\n filing of the application.\"\n\n \n(emphasis supplied)\n\n4.2 In \nAlapan Bandopadhyay vs Union of India\n in Civil Appeal No. 197\n\nof 2022 arising out of SLP (C) No. 18338/2021, Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\ninter alia discussed the issue of jurisdiction in regard to the cause of\n\naction in the following terms:\n\n \"11. In Nawal Kishore's case, the issue concerned was with respect to the\n jurisdiction of a particular High Court against an authority/person residing\n outside its territorial jurisdiction. That question was considered with reference\n to \nArticle 226(2)\n of the Constitution. It was held that writ could be issued\n if cause of action wholly or partially had arisen within the territorial\n jurisdiction of High Court concerned even if the person or authority\n against whom writ is sought for is located outside its territorial\n jurisdiction. \nHowever, it was held that in order to maintain such a\n writ petition, the petitioner had to establish that such respondents\n infringed his legal rights within the limits of the High Court's\n\n Page 5 of 6\n\n CAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of \n2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors\n.\n\n jurisdiction.In Navin Chandra N. Majithia's case, again the jurisdictional\n issue was considered with reference to \nArticle 226(2)\n of the Constitution and\n held that the High Court concerned would have jurisdiction to\n entertain a writ petition if any part of the cause of action arose\n within its territorial limits even though the seat of government or\n authority or residence of persons against whom direction, order or\n writ is sought to be issued is not within its territory.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n6.3 In the instant case, the dispute on seniority has arisen because of\n\nall India seniority list prepared by E-in-C, New Delhi. However, the delay\n\non part of HQ, Central Command, Lucknow is the reason cited by the\n\napplicants giving rise to the said dispute. Thus part of the cause of action\n\nleading to the dispute has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this\n\nTribunal. We have also taken note of OA No. 408 of 2021 adjudicated by\n\nthis Bench as pointed out by the learned counsel for the applicants.\n\n7.1 In view of the foregoing, M.A. 1786 of 2023 is allowed.\n\n7.2 The OA is admitted.\n\n7.3 The case shall be listed on 25.01.2024 for disposal of interim relief.\n\n (Pankaj Kumar) (Justice Anil Kumar Ojha)\n Member (A) Member (J)\n\nvidya\n\n Page 6 of 6",
