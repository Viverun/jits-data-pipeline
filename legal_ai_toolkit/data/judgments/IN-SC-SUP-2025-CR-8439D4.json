CONCLUSION ...........................................................................39\n\nPage 1 of 42\n\n1. This appeal is at the instance of a convict accused and is directed\nagainst the judgment and order passed by the High Court of\nChhattisgarh dated 30.07.2024 in Criminal Appeal No. 607 of\n2023 (hereinafter referred to as “Impugned Judgment”) by which\nthe High Court partly allowed the Criminal Appeal filed by the\nappellant herein and altered the conviction of the appellant under\n\nSection 302\nof the Indian Penal Code (for short, “the\nIPC\n”) into\none under\nSection 307\nof the IPC.\n\n2. It appears from the materials on record that four persons\nincluding the appellant herein were put to trial for the offence of\nmurder of one Rekhchand Verma in the Sessions Case No. 21 of\n2022 arising from the First Information Report bearing No. 0061\nof 2022 dated 22.02.2022 registered with the Saja Police Station,\nDistrict Bemetara, State of Chhattisgarh for the offence\npunishable under\nSections 458\n,\n,\n506(B)\nand\nof the IPC\nrespectively.\n\nA. FACTUAL MATRIX\n\n3. It is the case of the prosecution that on the fateful day of the\nincident the appellant herein along with three other co-accused\ntrespassed into the house of the deceased and dragged him upto\nthe terrace of the house and flung him down. After the deceased\nwas thrown down from the terrace, the appellant and other co-\n\naccused assaulted him with sticks and fisticuffs. The injured was\nshifted to the hospital in a very critical condition. Dying\ndeclaration of the deceased was recorded vide Ex. P-22 in which\nhe named the appellant herein and the other co-accused. The\ndeceased also made oral dying declarations before the doctors who\nattended him medically in the hospital.\n\nPage 2 of 42\n\n4. It appears that the injured Rekhchand Verma survived for about\nnine months from the date of the alleged incident. Ultimately, he\ndied on 08.11.2022 on account of septicemia and pneumonia\nleading to cardiorespiratory arrest. In such circumstances,\n\nSection 302\nof the IPC came to be added. The case was committed\nto the Court of Session. At the end of the trial, the appellant and\nthe three co-accused came to be convicted of the offence of murder\nand were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n5. The appellant herein along with co-accused, namely, Rupesh\nKumar Sahu preferred Criminal Appeal No. 607 of 2023 in the\nHigh Court whereas the Criminal Appeal No. 866 of 2023 was\npreferred by Gulsan Sinha and Criminal Appeal No. 1151 of 2024\nwas preferred by one Chavendra Patel.\n\n6. All the three criminal appeals referred to above were heard by the\nHigh Court and those were partly allowed vide the Impugned\nJudgment and order passed by the High Court. As stated above,\nthe High Court altered the conviction of the appellant herein and\nthe other co-accused from\nSection 302\nof the IPC to one under\n\nSection 307\nof the IPC and sentenced them to undergo 7 years of\nrigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1,000/-.\n\n7. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellant Maniklal\nSahu is here before us with the present appeal.\n\nB. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\n\n8. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\nvehemently submitted that the High Court ought to have acquitted\nthe appellant herein of all charges rather than altering the\nconviction from one under\nSection 302\nIPC to\nSection 307\nIPC.\n\nPage 3 of 42\n\nThe principal contention canvassed on behalf of the appellant\nherein is that the cause of death has no nexus with the injuries\nsuffered by the deceased at the time of the alleged assault on him.\nIn other words, the learned counsel laid much stress on the fact\nthat the injured died after about nine months from the date of the\nincident. Second argument canvassed on behalf of the appellant\nis, that the eyewitnesses are not reliable witnesses. They are\ninterested witnesses being PW-1 Satish Verma, brother of the\ndeceased; PW-11 Vikas Verma, another brother of the deceased;\nand PW-12 Gautahiri Bai Verma, mother of the deceased. It was\nargued that they had no occasion to witness the alleged assault.\n\n9. In such circumstances referred to above, the learned counsel\nappearing for the appellant would submit that there being merit\nin his appeal, the same may be allowed and the appellant may be\nacquitted of all the charges.\n\nC. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE\n\n10. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the State,\nwhile vehemently opposing this appeal, submitted that the High\nCourt committed a serious error in altering the conviction under\n\nSection 302\nof the IPC into one of attempt to commit murder\npunishable under\nSection 307\nof the IPC.\n\n11. However, the learned counsel fairly submitted that the State has\nnot preferred any acquittal appeal in this regard. In such\ncircumstances, he submitted that let the conviction of the\nappellant herein for the offence punishable under\nSection 307\nof\nthe IPC be maintained.\n\nPage 4 of 42\n\nD. ANALYSIS\n\n12. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and\nhaving gone through the materials on record, the only question\nthat falls for our consideration is whether the High Court\ncommitted any error in passing the Impugned Judgment and\norder?\n\n13. We do not propose to reappreciate the entire oral evidence on\nrecord. We have looked into the oral testimonies of PW-1 Satish\nVerma, brother of the deceased; PW-11 Vikas Verma, another\nbrother of the deceased; and PW-12 Gautahiri Bai Verma, mother\nof the deceased respectively. They are all eyewitnesses to the\nincident. There is no good reason for us to disbelieve or discard\ntheir evidence.\n\n14. We only propose to examine in the present appeal whether the\nHigh Court committed any error in bringing the case within the\nambit of “attempt to commit murder” punishable under\nSection\nIPC on the ground that the deceased Rekhchand Verma died\nafter a period of nine months from the date of the incident.\nUnfortunately, the exercise which we propose to undertake is\nultimately going to be academic as there is no acquittal appeal\nfiled at the instance of the State. However, we should not ignore\nor overlook the gross error committed by the High Court. We must\nexplain, why the High Court is wrong in its view.\n\n15. We must start with the medical evidence on record. The\nprosecution examined PW-9 Dr. Sheetal Kaushal. Dr. Sheetal\nKaushal in his examination-in-chief has deposed under:-\n\nPage 5 of 42\n\n01- “I was posted as Medical Officer at Community\nHealth Centre Saja from 22.06.2020 to\n\n16.06.2022.\n\n02- On 22.02.2022 at 11.14 pm, the injured\nRekhachand Verma, son of Radheshyam Verma,\nage 19 years, resident of Boratra, Police Station\nSaja, was brought to me for examination by\nconstable Indraman Nishad number 274 of Police\nStation Saja at Community Health Center Saja, in\nwhich, during his examination, I found that:\n\n1. The said injured person said that he was\npushed down from the roof and beaten up and\nthe condition of the said injured person was\nserious and his blood pressure was very low.\n\nThe said injured person was in a semiconscious\nstate and the smell of alcohol was coming from\nhis mouth.\n\n2. The above injured person had a lacerated\nwound measuring 8 cm x 0.5 cm x 1 cm in the\ntemporal parietal region of his head, which was\nbleeding profusely.\n\n3. The above patient was having pain in his\nthroat and was having difficulty in moving his\nthroat. I had advised him to get an X-ray done and\nalso advised him to get his head checked by a\nneurosurgeon.\n\n4. The injury was very serious so the correct\nopinion about the nature of the injury could have\nbeen given only after examination by a\nneurosurgeon and a radiologist. The condition of\nthe patient was so serious that I advised him to be\nimmediately taken to a higher centre.\n\n5. The above injuries sustained by the above\nvictim can be caused by falling from the roof and\nhitting the head with a hard or blunt object and the\nnature of the said injury can be determined only\nafter treatment by the NCCT head and\nneurosurgeon and radiologist. In this regard, the\nmedical examination report prepared by me is\nEx.P. 06, part of which is signed by me.\n\n03- On 25.02.2022, I was informed by the police\nstation in-charge Saja by sending a memorandum\nthat the injured Rekhachand Verma was referred\nto a higher center for advanced treatment and\nNCCT Head, Neurosurgery, Cervical X-ray was\n\nPage 6 of 42\n\nadvised, who was admitted to Mekahara Raipur\non 23.02.2022, then to DKS Hospital Raipur and\non 24.02.2022 he was admitted from DKS\nHospital to MMI Hospital Raipur, where the victim\nis admitted in ICU. Whose MRI scan has been\ndone, the part below the waist of the injured has\nbecome numb, due to which there is a possibility\nof spinal cord fracture, so give opinion on the\nfollowing two points-\n\n1. What is the nature of the injury suffered by\nthe victim?\n\n2. Was it possible for the injured person to die\ndue to the injury?\n\nI had written in reply to the above questions that,\n\n1) \"The nature of injury can only be determined by\na Radiologist and Neurophysician and\nNeurosurgeon.\" and 2) \"Yes, it was possible.\" The\nCurie report prepared by me in this regard is Ex.P.\n07, which bears my signatures on parts A to A.\n04- On 24,03,2022, the police station in-charge\nSaja sent a sealed stick along with a\nmemorandum for testing and asked-\n\n1. Could the injury sustained by Rekhachand\nVerma have been caused by the confiscated\nstick?\n\n2. Are there blood stains on the said stick?\n\n3. Any other opinions?\n\nI had examined the sealed stick along with the\nabove mentioned memorandum sent by the police\nstation in-charge Saja, whose length and size I\nhave mentioned by drawing its picture and after\nexamining the said stick, my opinion is that 1)\n“Such injuries can be inflicted on the injured\nRekhachand with this type of stick.” and 2) “I did\nnot find any blood stains on the stick.” In this\nregard, the query report prepared by me is Ex.P.\n08, which bears my signatures on parts A to A.”\nThere is practically no cross examination of Dr. Sheetal\nKaushal.\n\n16. We now look into the evidence of Dr. Twinkle Chandrakar, PW-24.\nDr. Chandrakar in her examination-in-chief has deposed as\nunder:-\n\nPage 7 of 42\n\n“01- I am posted as Assistant Professor in Sri\nSankaracharya Institute of Medical Science,\nJunwani Bhilai, District-Durg (CO) for the last two\nyears.\n\n02- On 21.10.2022 at 10:35 P.M. the\ninjured/deceased Rekhchand Lodhi father\nRadheshyam Verma age 22 years resident\nBoratara Tehsil Saja District Bemetara was\nbrought to me for treatment at Shankaracharya\nInstitute of Medical Science, Junwani Bhilai\nHospital. On examining him I found that-\n\n01. The condition of the said injured was very\nserious and he had no movement and\nsensation in both his legs due to which he was\nunable to walk and he had trouble breathing\nand his blood pressure was very low, he was\nnot urinating and he was suffering from\nvomiting and diarrhea and he also had fever.\n\nThe said injured had movement in both his\nhands.\n\n02. There was a wound in the hip of the injured\nperson which was filled with pus.\n\n03. The injured person had weakness in both\nhis hands and legs. The injured person had\nanaemia and there was swelling in his body.\n\n04. The said injured person was being given\noxygen with the help of a ventilator and\nmedicines were being given to maintain blood\npressure and due to blood loss, blood was\ntransfused and antibiotics were given and the\nwound on his hip was being treated.\n\n05. The patient's condition was not\nsatisfactory and the patient was becoming\nunstable.\n\n03- I had admitted the said injured/ deceased on\n22.10.2022 in Shankaracharya Hospital Junwani,\nwho died during treatment on 08.11.2022 due to\nSeptic shock with bilateral pneumonia with post\ntraumatic spinal cord injury with paraplegia with\ninfected bedsore with hepatic dysfunction. The\nentire treatment of the said deceased Rekhachand\nwas done by the medicine unit of the hospital\nunder my guidance and his discharge summary\nhas been prepared by Junior Doctor Richa\nSharma, which is , Ex.P. 28, on which my\n\nPage 8 of 42\n\nsignature is on part A and my seal and seal are on\nparts B to B. Along with the said discharge\ncertificate, the photocopy of the entire bedhead\nticket related to the treatment of the said deceased\nin our hospital is of total 137 pages and a death\ncertificate was issued by our hospital in relation to\nthe death of the above deceased, the death\ncertificate is Ex.P. 29, on which my signature is on\npart A to A and my seal and seal are on parts B to\nB.\n04- On 29.11.2022, the police station in-charge of\npolice station Saja sent letter no. / Th.Pr. / Saja /\n702-A / 2022 regarding providing opinion by\ncurating the discharge certificate and bedhead\nticket of deceased Rekhachand Lodhi. In crime\nnumber 61/2022 of police station Saja and asked\nthe following question-\n\n1. On the night of 22.02.2022 at about 8\no'clock, the accused beat up Rekhachand\nVerma with sticks and fists and threw him\nfrom the roof onto the CC road with the\nintention of killing him, due to which his spine\nwas fractured. The deceased died during\ntreatment at Shankaracharya Hospital on\n08.11.2022. Did the deceased die due to\nfracture in his spine?\n\n2. If deceased Rekhachand died due to some\nother reason, please give your clear opinion?\n05- In order to answer the said query, after\nexamining the discharge certificate of deceased\nRekhachand and the bed head ticket related to his\ntreatment, I have given this statement that, 1) In\nthe history of the said injured, on 22.02.2022, due\nto spinal cord injury, there was paraplegia and the\nsaid deceased had weakness in both hands and\nlegs due to which the patient became bedridden\nand there was infection in the wound of his hip,\ndue to which it is possible that the death of patient\nRekhachand was due to spinal cord injury. 2)\nWhile answering the query question number 02 of\nthe police station incharge, I have written such an\nopinion in my query report Ex. P. 30 which is the\nmemorandum of the police station in-charge dated\n29.11.2022 on the page that, A-Septic shock with\nBilateral Pneumonia. B-Post traumatic Spinal Cord\n\nPage 9 of 42\n\ninjury with Paraplegia infected bedsore hepatic\ndysfunction. That is, the patient Rekhachand died\ndue to the same reason which I have mentioned in\nthe answer to query question no. 01. My signature\nis on parts A to A of the query report Ex. P. 30.”\nOnce again, there is practically no cross examination of Dr.\nTwinkle Chandrakar.\n\n17. In the last, we should look into the oral evidence of Dr. Abhishek\nShrivastava, PW-28. Dr. Abhishek Shrivastava in his examination-\nin-chief has deposed as under:-\n\n“01- I am posted as Senior Medical Officer In\nGovernment Hospital, Supela Bhilai, District Durg\nfrom 01.01.2021 till date.\n\n02- On 09.11.2022 at 12:30 PM, deceased\nRekhchand Radheshyam Lodhi, age 22 years,\nresident of Boratara, District Bemetara, was\npresented from Shankaracharya Hospital, father\nlate Junwani, District Durg, for post-mortem by\nconstable number 484 Evan Baghel of Police\nOutpost Smriti Nagar Police Station Supela, to\nGovernment Hospital, Supela Bhilai, District Durg.\nThe said body was identified by Satish Lodhi,\nRajendra Yadu and constable Evan Baghel.\n03- The postmortem of the said dead body was\nstarted by me on 09.11.2022 at 12:30 P.M. The\nsaid dead body was of a male, which was\nwrapped in a white cloth and was lying straight\non the postmortem table. The body of the said\ndeceased was stiff and cold. There was injury on\nthe entire back portion of both the thighs of the\nsaid deceased and there was injury on his left\nankle as well. There was bedsore on the entire\nlower back of the said deceased, the size of which\nwas 4 x 3 cm.\n\n04- The deceased was of normal height and his\nskull, cranium, vertebrae, brain and spinal cord\nwere congested. There was fluid present in the\nright and left lungs of the deceased. There was a\nclot in the heart of the deceased. The diaphragm,\nintestine, mouth and esophagus and pharynx of\nthe deceased were normal and his spleen, kidney\nwere pale and urinary bladder was empty and\n\nPage 10 of 42\n\ngenitals were normal. There was half-digested\nfood in the stomach of the deceased and half-\ndigested food and stool was also present in his\nsmall intestine and large intestine.\n05- On the basis of the results and experience\nobtained from the postmortem of the said\ndeceased Rekhachand, it is my opinion that the\nsaid deceased died of cardiorespiratory attack due\nto septic shock, which was caused by infection of\nthe injuries in the body of the deceased. The time\nof death of the said deceased was between 18 to\n36 hours and the injuries found on the body of the\nsaid deceased were before his death\n(antemortem). In this regard, the postmortem\nreport prepared by me is Ex.P. 34, which bears my\nsignatures on parts A to A, B to B and C to C.\nCross-examination by Shri Balram Sahu, Advocate\nfor accused Gulshan and Chavendra:-\n\n06- On being asked whether septic shock can\noccur in the absence of treatment) the witness said\nthat it is possible if necessary antibiotics are not\ngiven during treatment.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThere is practically no cross examination of Dr. Abhishek\nShrivastava.\n\n18. Thus, the injured was brought to the hospital on 22.02.2022 in a\nvery critical condition. According to Dr. Kaushal (PW-9), the\ninjured was in a semi-conscious state. He was bleeding profusely\ndue to a very serious head injury.\n\n19. What is discernable from the medical evidence on record, in the\nform of oral testimonies of the three doctors referred to above, and\nthe documentary evidence in the form of postmortem report and\nthe injury certificate Exhibit P-34 is that the deceased died due to\ncomplications from paraplegia following spinal cord injury which\n\nPage 11 of 42\n\nresulted in systemic infection and multi-organ failure. Exhibits P-\n28, P-29 and P-34 respectively make it clear. It is ultimately the\nseptic shock resulting from infected pressure sores which in turn\narose from the spinal injury sustained in the incident that proved\nto be fatal.\n\n20. The deceased also suffered from pneumonia. According to the\nmedical experts, this pneumonia was the direct result of the long\ndrawn medical treatment which was given to the deceased over a\nperiod of nine months.\n\n21. All the three medical experts examined by the prosecution are\nclear in their oral testimony that the deceased died during\ntreatment on 08.11.2022 due to septic shock with bilateral\npneumonia, post traumatic spinal cord injury with paraplegia and\ninfected bedsores leading to hepatic dysfunction. The ocular\nversion of the eyewitnesses corroborates with medical evidence on\nrecord.\n\n22. Keeping the aforesaid in mind, we now proceed to consider the\nunderstanding of the High Court while altering the conviction.\n\ni. When is an offence said to be made under\nSection 307\nof\nthe IPC\n\n23. The High Court while altering the conviction under\nSection 302\nto\none under\nSection 307\nof the IPC recorded the following findings\nas contained in paragraph 35 of the Impugned Judgment. Para 35\nreads thus:-\n\n“35. No doubt, the injuries caused by the\nappellants to the deceased were grievous in\nnature. He died due to septic shock with bilateral\npneumonia with post traumatic spinal cord injury\nwith paraplegia with infected bedsore with hepatic\n\nPage 12 of 42\n\ndysfunction. Due to spinal cord injury, there was\nparaplegia and the deceased had weakness in\nboth hands and legs, due to which the deceased\nbecame bedridden and there was infection in the\nwound of his hip. Due to which, it is probable that\nthe death of deceased Rekhchand Verma was due\nto his spinal cord injury. Rekhchand Verma was\nfirstly referred to the Community Health Center,\nSaja, the doctor there referred him to Mekahara\nHospital, Raipur and from there he was shifted to\nDKS Hospital and thereafter he was again shifted\nto MMI Narayan Hospital, Raipur and finally he\nwas shifted to Shankaracharya Hospital, Durg\nwhere he died. As such, due to lack of proper\ntreatment, he died after about 9 months of the\nincident. Therefore, the case of the appellants falls\nwithin the purview of\nSection 307\nof the IPC and\nnot under\nSection 302\nof the IPC. Even otherwise,\nthe trial Court has already convicted the\nappellants for offence under\nSection 307\n/\nof the\nIPC for the same offence, therefore, there is no\nnecessity to convict them also for offence under\n\nSection 302\n/\nof the IPC.”\n\n24. We have noticed over a period of time that the courts get confused\nwhile determining the exact nature of offence, more particularly,\nwhen there is a long interval between the date the victim suffered\ninjuries and the date of his death.\n\n25. We must first look into the relevant provisions of the\nIPC\n.\n\nSections 299\n,\nand\nof the IPC respectively read as under:-\n\n“\nSection 299\n. Culpable homicide.—Whoever\ncauses death by doing an act with the intention of\ncausing death, or with the intention of causing\nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or\nwith the knowledge that he is likely by such act to\ncause death, commits the offence of culpable\nhomicide.\n\nxxx\n“Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily\ninjury, the person who causes such bodily injury\nshall be deemed to have caused the death,\n\nPage 13 of 42\n\nalthough by resorting to proper remedies and\nskillful treatment the death might have been\nprevented.”\n\nSection 300\n. Murder.—Except in the cases\nhereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,\nif the act by which the death is caused is done with\nthe intention of causing death, or—\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing\nsuch bodily injury as the offender knows to be\nlikely to cause the death of the person to whom the\nharm is caused, or—\n3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing\nbodily injury to any person and the bodily injury\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary\ncourse of nature to cause death, or—\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that\nit is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as\nis likely to cause death, and commits such act\nwithout any excuse for incurring the risk of\ncausing death or such injury as aforesaid.\n\nxxx\n\nSection 302\n. Punishment for murder.—Whoever\ncommits murder shall be punished with death, or\nimprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to\nfine.”\n\n26. To come within the definition of\nSection 299\nIPC, the act of the\naccused should cause death and it must be (a) with the intention\nof causing death, or (b) with the intention of causing such bodily\ninjuries as is likely to cause death, or (c) with the knowledge that\nhe is likely by such act to cause death. The question when a person\ncould be said to have caused death by his act needs to be answered\ntaking into consideration the Explanations 1 and 2 respectively to\n\nSection 299\nof the IPC.\n\nPage 14 of 42\n\n27. The simpler case is where death results directly and immediately\nfrom the act itself. Equally, when death ensues as a natural or\nnecessary consequence flowing from that act, there can be no\nhesitation in holding that the act caused the death. For “Thirdly”\nof\nSection 300\nto apply the requirement is, that the injury inflicted\nshould be found sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\ncause death, a high degree of probability, in the ordinary way of\nnature, that death would ensue on the injuries. The difficulty\narises when there are recognisable contributory causes leading to\ndeath, and the Court is called upon to consider in such case the\nrelative effect and strength of the different causes in bringing\nabout the effect i.e., the death, and then to ascertain whether the\nresponsibility of the death could be assigned to a particular act\nwhich is not as proximate, or immediate.\n\n28.\nSection 307\nof the IPC reads as under:-\n\n“\nSection 307\n. Attempt to murder.—Whoever does\nany act with such intention or knowledge, and\nunder such circumstances that, if he by that act\ncaused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall\nbe punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten\nyears, and shall also be liable to fine; and if hurt\nis caused to any person by such act, the offender\nshall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to\nsuch punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.”\n\n29. An offence under\nSection 307\nIPC has the following essential\ningredients:-\n\n(i) The death of a human was attempted;\n\n(ii) That the death was attempted to be caused, or caused\nin the consequence of the act of the accused; and\n\nPage 15 of 42\n\n(iii) That the act was done with the intention of causing\ndeath; or that it was done with the intention of causing such\nbodily injury as:\n\na. the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or\nb. was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\ndeath, or that the accused attempted to cause death by\ndoing an act known to him to be so dangerous that it must\nin all probability cause:\n\ni. death, or\nii. such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\n\n30. Thus, from the above, the most important ingredient to constitute\nthe offence of attempt to commit murder punishable under\nSection\nof the IPC is the intention or knowledge. To bring home guilt\nagainst an accused under this provision, it is necessary for the\nprosecution to establish that the intention of the accused was one\nof the three kinds mentioned in\nSection 300\nof the IPC. A person\ncommits an offence under\nSection 307\nof the IPC when he has the\nintention to commit murder and in pursuance of that intention,\ndoes an act towards its commission irrespective of the fact whether\nthat act is the penultimate act or not. The provision requires that\nthe act must be done with such intention, or knowledge, or in such\ncircumstances that if death be caused by that act, the offence of\nmurder will emerge.\n\n31. It is clear as noonday that causing an injury that would endanger\nlife is not an essential condition for the applicability of\nSection 307\n\nof the IPC. Even if the injuries inflicted are simple in nature, that\nby itself cannot be a ground for acquittal, if the offence otherwise\nfalls under\nSection 307\nof the IPC.\n\nPage 16 of 42\n\n32. The word “intent” means design, or determination with which a\nperson acts. It presupposes knowledge. It is the purpose to use\nparticular means to effect certain result. The “act” referred in\n\nSection 307\nof the IPC attempted to must be with the “intention”\nof killing a human. Intention is a state of mind which cannot be\nproved by direct evidence as a fact; it can only ordinarily be\ninferred from proved facts. It may be proved by res gestae, by acts\nor events previous or subsequent to the incident or occurrence, or\non admission. We say so because it shows the presence of will in\nthe act which consummates a crime. The relevant circumstances\nfrom which the intention can be gathered. We have supplied a\nsuggestive, and not exhaustive list:-\n\n1. the nature of the weapon used;\n\n2. the manner in which the weapon was used;\n\n3. the part of the body where the injuries were inflicted;\n\n4. the nature of the injuries caused;\n\n5. the opportunity available which the accused gets.\n\n33. We may quote with profit one very erudite decision of the High\nCourt of in the case of\nSreedharan v. State of Kerala\n, reported\nin 1969 SCC OnLine Ker 46, wherein the Court illustrated the\nmetrics by which intention and knowledge can be inferred. It was\nheld that intention can be inferred from the circumstantial\nevidence of the case, such as the motive, the preparations made,\nthe declarations of the offender, the weapon used, the persistent\nof the assault, and the nature of the injuries inflicted, and its\nposition. In the\nIPC\n, the word “intention” is understood in the\ncontext of the consequences of an act, and not in relation to the\nact. The Court lucidly elaborates that the presence of intention is\ngathered when an act is done deliberately or purposely, it is not\n\nPage 17 of 42\n\ncontingent on the resultant effect. Most importantly, the inference\nlies in reading of the consequences from the eyes of a reasonable\nman. The relevant observations read thus:-\n\n“16. Intention and knowledge are a man's state of\nmind; direct evidence thereof except through his\nown confession cannot be had; and apart from a\nconfession they can be proved only by\ncircumstantial evidence. In other words, they are\nmatters for inference from all the circumstances of\nthe case such as the motive, the preparations\nmade, the declarations of the offender, and, in the\ncase of homicide, the weapon used, the\npersistence of the assault, and the nature of the\ninjuries actually inflicted as also their location. In\nthe case of what are generally described as\nunpremediated offences or as offences committed\non the spur of the moment, intention may be\ncontemporaneous with the physical act, at best of\njust an instant before, and is generally to be\ngathered from the nature and consequences of the\nact and the attendant circumstances. It is here that\nthe much criticised maxim that every man is\npresumed to intend the natural and probable\nconsequences of his act comes into play.\n\n17. Like most words, the word, “intention” is\ncapable of different shades of meaning. In the\nPenal Code, 1860 it is used in relation to the\nconsequences of an act, the effect caused thereby,\nnot in relation to the act itself—the voluntariness\nrequired to constitute an act is implied by that very\nword. Thus, in the case of murder, the intention\nrequired is (omitting clause secondly of\nS. 300\n\nwhich rarely comes into play) the intention of\ncausing death or the intention of causing bodily\ninjury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\ncause death, more or less the malice aforethought\nof the English law, the former being generally\ndescribed as specific intent or malice and the latter\nas implied malice or sometimes as constructive\nmalice, though the use of the latter term seems\nopen to criticism. It seems to us clear from the\nillustrations to Ss. 88, 89 and 92, that the Code\nuses the word, “intention” in the sense that\n\nPage 18 of 42\n\nsomething is intentionally done if it is done\ndeliberately or purposely, in other words, is a\nwilled though not necessarily a desired result or a\nresult which is the purpose of the deed. The\nsurgeon of the illustrations certainly does not\ndesire the harm that may be caused; nor is that\nhis purpose. Nevertheless, the provisions of the\nsections show that he could have intended the\nharm, and is saved from being a criminal only by\nthose provisions. Likewise a man who shoots\nanother in the heart and kills him in self-defence\nmight not desire, on the contrary might very much\ndislike, causing the latter's death. His purpose is\nnot to cause death but to save himself. Yet his case\nfalls squarely within the first clause of\nS. 300\n—he\nhas undoubtedly caused death by doing an act\nwith the intention of causing death—and is saved\nfrom being a murderer only by S.\n\n100.\nLang v. Lang\n(1955) A.C. 402 rather\nthan Rex v. Steane(1947) K.B. 997 at 1004\nor Hosegood v. Hosegood66 The Times L.R. 738\nillustrate the sense in which the word, “intention”\nis used in\nS. 300\nof the Penal Code, 1860—of\ncourse none of these cases was construing that\nstatute. And, once you dispense with desire or\npurpose, it follows that foresight of the\nconsequences of an act gains the upper hand in\ndetermining whether the consequences were\nintended or not. And, the foresight of a particular\nperson is prima facie to be gauged by the foresight\nof an ordinary, reasonable man, in other words, by\nwhat is sometimes disparagingly referred to as the\nobjective test or external standard—as if that were\nenough to condemn it—of the reasonable and\nprobable consequences of the act.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n34. To justify a conviction under\nSection 307\nIPC it is not essential\nthat bodily injury capable of causing death should have been\ninflicted. Although, the nature of injury actually caused may\noften give considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to the\nintention of the accused, yet such intention may also be deduced\n\nPage 19 of 42\n\nfrom other circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be\nascertained without any reference at all to the actual wounds.\nThe provision makes a distinction between an act of the accused\nand its result, if any. Such an act may not be attended by any\nresult so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but still there\nmay be cases in which the culprit would be liable under the\nprovision. It is not necessary that the injury actually caused to\nthe victim of the assault should be sufficient under ordinary\ncircumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted. What\nthe courts have to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result,\nwas done with the intention or knowledge and under\ncircumstances mentioned in the provision. An attempt in order\nto be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is sufficient in\nlaw if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in\nexecution thereof.\n\n35. An offence under\nSection 307\nIPC is made out even though death\ndoes not ensue, more pertinently, even if no harm ensues. The\nphrase employed in the provision, “if he by the act caused death”,\nimports that the act in question must possess the potential to\ncause death. An act intrinsically incapable of causing death\ncannot constitute the offence under this provision. We had the\nbenefit of referring to Reg. v. Cassidy, reported in (1867) 4 Bom.\nH.C. (Cr. C.) 17, which emphasizes upon the same in the following\nwords:-\n\n“The first two heads are framed under\nS. 307\n. The\nwords of that section are:— “Whoever does any act\nwith such intention or knowledge, and under such\ncircumstances, that if he by that act caused death\nhe would be guilty of murder, shall be punished,\n“& c. Now it appears to me, looking at the terms of\nthis section, as well as at the illustrations to it, that\nit is necessary, in order to constitute an offence\n\nPage 20 of 42\n\nunder it, that there must be an act done under such\ncircumstances that death might be caused if the\nact took effect. The act must be capable of causing\ndeath in the natural and ordinary course of things;\nand if the act complained of is not of that\ndescription, a prisoner cannot be convicted of an\nattempt to murder under this section”.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n36. This decision was criticised by Beaumont, C.J. in\nEmperor v.\nVasudeo Balwant Gogte\nreported in 1932 SCC OnLine Bom 1,\nbut the learned Judge’s conclusion expressed in the following\nwords seems to us much the same:-\n\n“But if you have an act done with a sufficiently\nguilty intention and knowledge and in\ncircumstances which do not from their nature\nafford a defence to a charge of murder, and if the\nact is of such a nature as would have caused\ndeath in the usual course of events but for\nsomething beyond the accused's control which\nprevented that result, then it seems to me that the\ncase falls within\nS. 337\n.”\n\n37. From the above exposition of law, there is no gainsaying that the\nassault shall be capable of causing death.\nIn\nR. v. Whybrow\n(1951-35-Crl\n. Appl. 141) the accused by a device constructed by\nhim administered electric shocks to his wife while she was in a\nbath. Parker, J. directed the jury that if he did so, intending to kill\nhis wife or to do her grievous bodily harm he would be guilty of\nattempt at murder. The Court of Appeal held that this was a wrong\ndirection. Observing that if the charge is one of attempt at murder,\nthe intention to kill is the principal ingredient of the crime. Lord\nGoddard C.J., expressed himself thus:-\n\n“Therefore, if one person attacks another, inflicting\na wound in such a way that an ordinary,\nreasonable person must know that atleast\ngrievous bodily harm will result and death results,\nthere is the malice aforethought sufficient to\n\nPage 21 of 42\n\nsupport the charge of murder. But, if the charge is\none of attempted murder, the intent becomes the\nprincipal ingredient of the crime. It may be said\nthat the law which is not always logical, is\nsomewhat illogical in saying that, if one attacks a\nperson intending to do grievous bodily harm and\ndeath results, that is murder; but if one attacks a\nperson and only intends to do grievous bodily\nharm, and death does not result, it is not\nattempted murder, but wounding with intent to do\ngrievous bodily harm. It is not really illogical\nbecause, in that particular case, the intent is the\nessence of the crime while, where the death of\nanother is caused, the necessity is to prove malice\naforethought, which is supplied in law by proving\nintent to do grievous bodily harm.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n38. In R v. Grimwood (1962-(3)-AER. 285), the accused had been\nconvicted by the Central Criminal Court of attempt to strangle his\nwife with intent to murder her. No verdict was taken from the jury\non two other counts, namely, attempt to suffocate his wife with\nintent to murder and assault occasioning her actual bodily harm.\nIn the course of his direction to the jury the learned Judge, relying\non Director of Public Prosecutions v. Smith (1961-AC. 290),\nobserved:-\n\n“He is put before you by his counsel as an ordinary\nnormal minded man, and so you should take it in\nthis case that he is an ordinary normal-minded\nman. The Law is that in the case of an ordinary\nnormal man it does not matter what that man\ncontemplates at the moment at all. The test is\nwhether what he did was of a kind where death\nmight well have been the natural and probable\nresult of what he did.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n39. On appeal from the above conviction, Lord Parker, C.J. delivering\nthe judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that the\n\nPage 22 of 42\n\nCourt was clearly of the opinion that nothing that was said\nin Smith (supra) had any application to the offence of attempted\nmurder. Adverting in particular, to the direction to the jury\nextracted supra, the Lord Chief Justice observed:-\n\n“One further matter should be mentioned, and that\nis that certainly in regard to the first passage\nwhich I have quoted in the summing up it might\nwell have led the jury to suppose that, even if they\nwere satisfied that all that the appellant intended\nto do was to cause grievous bodily harm, yet if\ndeath might well result from such grievous bodily\nharm an intent to murder had been proved. That\nagain, if that impression was conveyed, was quite\nclearly a wrong direction.\nIn\nR. v. Whybrow1951-\n35-Crl\n. Appl. 141 Lord Goddard, C.J. dealt with\nthat very point.”\nii. Application of Theory of Causation where death ensues\nafter some delay\n\n40. The theory of causation should be kept within reasonable limits at\nboth ends. The question when there are latter complications would\nbe, whether such complications are the natural or likely\nconsequences of the injury, the ordinary course it takes before\ndeath causes. That the consequences are labelled as a supervening\ncondition or disease, given a name and shown as the immediate\ncause of death will not efface from the chain of events and causes\nthe original injury, if death is its ultimate result. At the end, all\ndeath is brought about by coma, syncope or asphyxia, the\nsynchronised and interdependent functioning of the brain; the\nheart and the lungs maintaining life. Death may properly be\nattributed to coma, syncope and asphyxia, but the cause cannot\nstop there. The stoppage of one of them will be quickly followed by\nthe stoppage of the action of others and by cessation of life. In\nBrintons Ltd. v. Turvey, 1905 AC 230, 233, the Earl of Halsbury\nL.C. while considering the phrase “accident causing injury”\n\nPage 23 of 42\n\nobserving that “we must be on our guard that we are not misled\nby medical phrases to alter the proper application of the phrase,\nbecause the injury inflicted by accident sets up a condition of\nthings which medical men describe as disease” stated:-\n\n“An injury to the head has been known to set up\nseptic pneumonia, and many years ago I\nremember when that incident had in fact occurred\nit was sought to excuse the person who inflicted\nthe blow on the head from the consequences of his\ncrime because his victim had died of pneumonia\nand not as it was contended, of the blow on the\nhead. It does not appear to me that by calling the\nconsequences of an accidental injury a disease\none alters the nature or the consequential results\nof the injury that has been inflicted.”\n\n41. In the same case at p. 234, Lord Mac-naghten observed:-\n\n“The accidental character of the injury is not, I\nthink, removed or displaced by the fact that, like\nmany other accidental injuries, it set up a well\nknown disease, which was immediately the cause\nof death, and would no doubt be certified as such\nin the usual death certificate.”\n\n42. However, for culpability, as stated in Mayne's Criminal Law of\nIndia, 4th Edn., at p. 477 “it is indispensable that death should be\nconnected with the act of violence not merely by a chain of causes\nand effects but by such direct influence as is calculated to produce\nthe effect without the intervention of any considerable change of\ncircumstances.” The learned commentator referring to R. v.\nHolland, (1841) 2 M and Rob 351; (1904) 1 Cri LJ 909, observed\nat page 476:-\n\n“The real question was whether in the end the\nwound was the cause of death.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nPage 24 of 42\n\n43. He refers to Explanation 2 to\nSection 299\nas substantially\nproducing the rule enunciated in Male's Pleas of the Crown,\nVolume I, page 28, to the following effect:-\n\n“If a man receives a wound, which is not in itself\nmortal, but either for want of helpful applications\nor neglect thereof it turns to a gangrene or a fever,\nand that gangrene or fever be the immediate cause\nof death, yet this is murder or manslaughter in him\nthat gave the stroke or wound, though it were not\nthe immediate cause of his death, yet if it were the\nimmediate cause thereof, and the fever or\ngangrene was the immediate cause of his death,\nyet the wound was the cause of the gangrene or\nfever, and so consequently is causa causans.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n44. The learned author observes at p. 475:-\n\n“Where an injury of a dangerous character has\nbeen inflicted, which might possibly not have been\nfatal, but the sufferer declines to follow proper\ntreatment, or is injudiciously treated, or sinks\nunder an operation which might possibly have\nbeen avoided, the person who inflicted the injury\nis considered in law to have caused the death\nwhich results.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n45. In R. v. Holland (supra), the deceased who had received a cut on\nthe finger did not follow the advice of the surgeon to have it\namputated. Subsequently, lock-jaw set in because of which he\ndied. Evidence was let in that if he had submitted to an operation,\nhis life would probably have been saved. But Maule, J. held that\nthat was no defence.\n\n46. In Russel on Crime, 12th Edn., Vol. 1 at page 28 it is stated:-\n\n“There is however, the different, although allied,\npoint that a particular man's conduct may not have\nbeen the sole cause of the actus reus, it may have\nbeen a contributory cause. In such circumstances,\n\nPage 25 of 42\n\nit would seem that a safeguard against injustice\nshould take the form of a direction to the jury that\nthey should not convict unless they are satisfied\nthat actus reus would not have occurred but for the\naccused man's participation in the matter.”\n\n47. Proceeding it is observed:-\n\n“The actus reus, on the above definition is an\nevent, and any particular event may be found to\nhave been produced by the combined effect of a\nnumber of factors any one of which may be\nregarded as a cause of the event provided that this\nevent would not have taken place had that factor\nnot existed. In such a situation a man may be held\nto have caused the actus reus of a crime if that\nactus would not have occurred without his\nparticipation in what led upto it.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n48. Referring to indirect causation, it was observed by the Madras\nHigh Court In re, Maragatham:-\n\n“But how far can indirect causation to be\nrecognised as operative, in criminal jurisprudence?\nA glimmer of light is thrown upon this problem in\nthe case law relating to explanation 2 to\nSection\n, I. P. C. If, after the blow or act of injury\nimpugned as homicidal, a distinct set of\ncircumstances arises causing. a new mischief,\nthen the new mischief will be regarded as the\ncausa causans and not the original blow: R. v.\nFlynn. (1867) 16 WR 319 IR, cited in Ratan's\nCulpable homicide p. 8\". But the question is hardly\nfree from subtle difficulties.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n49. The difficulty of deciding between proximate and remote cause or\nfor finding out causa causans was cut through by the rule of\nEnglish common law that a man who had received injury from\nanother was not considered to have been killed by him, unless\n\nPage 26 of 42\n\ndeath followed within a year and a day after the injury. But there\nis no such rule in the\nIndian Penal Code\n. While referring to the\ntheory of causation which provided the simple test of guilty in the\nearly period of criminal law, in Russel on Crimes, 12th Edn.,\nVolume 1, the learned author observes at page 28 that the drawing\nof a line between proximate causes and remote consequences is\nunscientific, but appeared to be the only way of avoiding decisions\nof a cruelty offensive to moral feelings before the doctrine of mens\nrea as a legally essentially ingredient in criminal liability\nappeared.” The learned author states at p. 40:-\n\n“The new test (foresight of consequences) is found\nin the requirement that the accused person, when\npursuing the line of active conduct (or passive) in\ncases where there is a legal duty to action which\nresulted in the harm for which he is charged (i.e.,\nthe actus reus) must have been aware that certain\nsped fled harmful consequences would or could\nfollow. Such a test arises naturally from the\nadoption of the ethical approach to the problem of\ncrime, since in many minds it is hard to see any\nmoral blame, meriting the infliction of punishment,\nin a man who has pursued a line of conduct\nwithout appreciating that it would produce\nmischievous results.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n50. In the footnote at page 412, the learned author observes that the\nunscientific differentiation between proximate and remote\nconsequences of a man's conduct was probably due to the lack of\nclear definition of mens rea which would have rendered innocuous\na remote claim of causation; since the more remote the cause the\nless possible it would be to establish that the prisoner intended or\nrealised the result.\n\nPage 27 of 42\n\n51. The problem of supervening cause intervening arose for\nconsideration In re, Periaswami, C.A. 166 of 1961 (Mad). In that\ncase, the accused whipped out his knife and stabbed the deceased\nin his abdomen in the course of a sudden quarrel. The deceased\nhad a tear in his stomach and an incised cut in the liver. He was\nunder treatment for 17 days and was having a sinus through\nwhich he was discharging bile and some pus. Due to the constant\ndischarge of bile and pus, the abdomen suddenly burst. The\nabdomen was sutured, but he did not recover. In the opinion of\nthe doctor, the deceased would appear to have died of septic\nperitonitis as a result of the injuries to the stomach, liver and\npancreas. It was contended for the accused that the deceased died\nnot as a result of the wounds inflicted by the accused, but on\naccount of some other causes, which intervened, in the course of\ntreatment. After examining the case law, it is observed that the\naccused inflicted the injury on the vital part of the body, and that\nthere was no definite evidence that death was due to other\nindependent supervening causes. It was held that death was due\nto an injury which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause death, and that death was ultimately due to the\nsupervening of septic peritonitis and the accused was directly\nresponsible for causing death. It was found on the evidence, that,\nthough there was culpable homicide, yet it was a case falling under\nPart II of\nSection 304\nof the IPC.\n\n52. The decision in Nga Moe v. The King, AIR 1941 Rang 141, is again\nillustrative:-\n\n“The injury indicted by the accused on deceased's\nhead was not such as to entail any serious\nconsequences to a person in normal health. The\nwound had healed up to the end of seven days in\nthe hospital but the deceased had temperature\n\nPage 28 of 42\n\nand on this account was advised to remain in\nhospital until temperature had subsided. Contrary\nto medical advice, the deceased left hospital.\nSubsequently as a result of the formation of an\nabscess on the brain the deceased died. But no\ndeath would have resulted, if he had not insisted\non leaving the hospital against medical advice. His\ndeath really ensued because of his weak physical\ncondition due to his suffering from chronic malaria\nand because his powers of resistance to infection\nhad been much lowered by that disease. No\nabscess would have formed on the brain if the\ndeceased had been in normal state of health and\nhe died from abscess and not from the injury\nwhich had only a remote connection with the\nabscess. The immediate cause of the deceased's\ndeath was his debilitated condition for which the\ninjury was in no way responsible.”\n\n53. It was held in the circumstances that the accused was guilty of\ncausing simple hurt punishable under\nSection 324\nof the IPC.\nDunkley, J. observed at P. 144:-\n\n“Therefore, it cannot be held that the act of the\nappellant caused the death of the deceased. The\nonly case in which the infliction of an injury of this\nnature under similar circumstances could be held\nto amount to culpable homicide or murder is a case\nfalling within Clause 2 of\nSection 300\n, I. P. C.\nnamely, if the act is done with the intention of\ncausing such bodily injury as the offender knows\nto be likely to cause the death of the person to\nwhom the harm is caused. If there had been\nevidence to show that the appellant was at the\ntime aware of the state of the deceased's health\nand therefore knew that even a slight injury was\nlikely to result in his death, his act might have\nbeen brought under this clause, but there is no\nsuch evidence.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nPage 29 of 42\n\n54. The following observations of Roberts, C.J. in the case are apposite\nin the circumstances of the present case. The learned Judge\nobserved:-\n\n“It really is plain common sense that, if a man\nstrikes another such a blow as will not in the\nordinary course of events cause more than simple\nhurt, he is answerable for causing simple hurt\nand, for no more. No doubt, the natural effect of\nsome grave wounds, if not medically treated, is\nseptic inflammation, if death proceeds from this in\nthe ordinary course the offender is prima facie\nguilty of murder; if death is merely the likely result\nof such an injury, it is culpable homicide. But here\nthe dangerous condition which supervened was\nan unlikely consequence of a blow comparatively\ntrivial in character although the weapon was a\ndangerous one. The fact that a dangerous weapon\nis used is often and may be indeed generally, a\nmatter to be taken into account in deciding\nquestions of intention; but circumstances after\ncases, and, having regard to the medical evidence\nhere as to the wound itself it is impossible to say\nthat there was an intention to cause death. The\noffence could not therefore amount even to\nculpable homicide.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. The leading old case is In re, Doraswami, reported in 1943 SCC\nOnLine Mad 208, where the principle is thus enunciated:-\n\n“In my view, the test is whether the cause of death\nis to be directly associated with the act. Whether it\nbe a deliberate act in criminal cases or an accident\nin cases of workmen’s compensation it is, I think,\nwell known that the ultimate cause of death in a\nlarge number of cases is pneumonia. It would be a\nstrange position if a man who inflicts a wound\ncausing almost immediate death should be guilty\nof murder, whilst a man who inflicts a very similar\nwound from which pneumonia supervenes should\nnot. On the facts of this case, it is clear to me that\nthe deceased man, in spite of his physique which\n\nPage 30 of 42\n\nis said to have been exceptionally robust, died as\na direct result of the injuries inflicted upon him by\nthe appellant; and that the appellant intended his\ndeath is evident from the facts. The result was not\nas immediate as he intended and not perhaps\nquite in the manner that he intended. But in the\nprocess of nature, in spite of medical attention, one\nof the well known perils from a wound\nsupervened, namely, blood poisoning, and the\ndeceased died. The chain of causation is in my\nview direct.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n56. In Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence,\n11th Edn. Vol. 1, at page 232, it is stated:-\n\n“A wound may cause death either directly or\nIndirectly. A wound operates as a direct cause of\ndeath when the wounded person dies either\nimmediately or very soon after its infliction, and\nthere is no other cause of death. In wounds which\ncause death indirectly the deceased survives for a\ncertain period, and the wound is complicated by\ninflammation embolism, pneumonia, tetanus, or\nsome other mortal disease which is a consequence\nof the injury. Cases which prove fatal by reason of\nsurgical operation rendered imperatively\nnecessary for the treatment of injuries presuming\nthat these operations have been performed with\nordinary skill and care, also fall into this\ncategory.... It would be no answer to a charge of\ndeath from violence to say that there was disease\nin the body of the victim unless the disease was\nthe sole cause of death.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n57. At page 238, the learned author observes:-\n\n“Certain kinds of injuries are not immediately\nfollowed by various consequences: but an injured\nperson may die after a long or shorter period and\nhis death may be as much a consequence of the\ninjury as if it had taken place on the spot. An\naggressor is as responsible as if the deceased had\nbeen directly killed by his violence provided the\nfatal result can be traced to probable\n\nPage 31 of 42\n\nconsequences of the injury....Death may follow a\nwound, and be a consequence of that wound, at\nalmost any period after its infliction. It is necessary\nhowever, in order to maintain a charge of\nhomicide, that death should be strictly and clearly\ntraceable to the injury. A doubt on this point must\nof course lead to an acquittal of the accused.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n58. Septicemia is described by the medical experts as the condition\nwhich results where the circulation becomes flooded with bacteria,\neither due to the failure of local defensive reactions at the site of\ninfection or to delayed or inadequate treatment. According to the\nlearned author, every penetrating wound except those inflicted by\nthe surgeon is potentially infected, though a certain period elapsed\nbefore invading organisms actually establish themselves become\nembedded in the tissues to multiply and form toxins. [See: The\nEssentials of Modern Surgery by Handfield Jones and Pokitt,\nV Edn]\n\n59.\nIn one of the recent pronouncements of this Court in\nPrasad\nPradhan & Anr. v. State of Chhattisgarh\n, reported in (2023)\n11 SCC 320, this Court stated in paragraphs 30 and 31\nrespectively as under:-\n\n“30. During the hearing, the appellants' counsel\nhad urged that Vrindawan died 20 days after the\nattack, and the lapse of such a time shows that the\ninjuries were not sufficient to cause death in the\nordinary course of nature. On this aspect, there are\nseveral judgments, which emphasise that such a\nlapse of time, would not per se constitute a\ndeterminative factor as to diminish the offender's\nliability from the offence of murder to that of\nculpable homicide, not amounting to murder.[…]\n\nPage 32 of 42\n\n31. There can be no stereotypical assumption or\nformula that where death occurs after a lapse of\nsome time, the injuries (which might have caused\nthe death), the offence is one of culpable homicide.\n\nEvery case has its unique fact situation. However,\nwhat is important is the nature of injury, and\nwhether it is sufficient in the ordinary course to\nlead to death. The adequacy or otherwise of\nmedical attention is not a relevant factor in this\ncase, because the doctor who conducted the post-\nmortem clearly deposed that death was caused\ndue to cardiorespiratory failures, as a result of the\ninjuries inflicted upon the deceased. Thus, the\ninjuries and the death were closely and directly\nlinked.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n60.\nIn the case of\nSudershan Kumar v. State of Delhi\n, reported in\n(1975) 3 SCC 831, this Court dealt with the case of acid pouring.\nIn the said case, this Court was called upon to consider the\nquestion as regards the nature of the offence committed by the\nappellant therein in causing death of one Maya Devi by pouring\nacid on her body. After 12 days from the date of incident the victim\ntherein died. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that death\nof Maya Devi was not the direct result of the injuries caused by\nthe acid burns but was on account of some supervening\ncircumstances not resulting from the injuries and, therefore, the\nappellant therein could not be held guilty of murder. This Court\nwhile negativizing such contention observed that the injuries\ncaused by the appellant therein were sufficient in the ordinary\ncourse of nature to cause death and the appellant was accordingly\nheld guilty of an offence punishable under\nSection 302\nof the IPC.\n\n61.\nIn\nPatel Hiralal Joitaram v. State of Gujarat\n, reported in\n(2002) 1 SCC 22, the interval between the date of the incident\nwhen the deceased sustained burns and the date of her death was\n\nPage 33 of 42\n\na fortnight. It was argued on behalf of the appellant therein that\nthe death of the deceased had no direct nexus with the burn\ninjuries as during the interregnum period some other\ncomplications cropped up as a result of which the victim\nsuccumbed. While negativizing such contention, this Court\nobserved as under:-\n\n“16. Harping on an answer given by PW 12 in\ncross-examination that death of the deceased had\noccurred due to “septic” learned Senior Counsel\nmade out an argument that such septic condition\ncould have developed on account of other causes.\nMere possibility of other causes supervening\nduring her hospitalisation is not a safe premise for\ndeciding whether she would not have died due to\nthe burns sustained on 21-10-1988. The cause of\ndeath can be determined on broad probabilities. In\nthis context we may refer to a passage from Modi's\nMedical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, dealing\nwith death by burns:\n\n“As already mentioned, death may occur\nwithin 24 to 48 hours, but usually the first\nweek is the most fatal. In suppurative cases,\ndeath may occur after five or six weeks or even\nlonger.”\n\n17.\nIn\nOm Parkash v. State of Punjab\n[(1992) 4\nSCC 212] the victim was set ablaze on 17-03-1979\nand she sustained burns with which she died only\n13 days thereafter. The assailant was convicted of\nmurder and the conviction was confirmed by this\nCourt.\n\n18. It is preposterous to say that the deceased in\nthis case would have been healed of the burn\ninjuries and that she would have contracted\ninfection through some other causes and\ndeveloped septicemia and died of that on 15-11-\n\n1988. Court of law need not countenance mere\nacademic possibilities when the prosecution case\nregarding death of the deceased was established\non broad probabilities as a sequel to the burns\nsustained by her. Hence we repel the contention of\nthe learned counsel on that score.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nPage 34 of 42\n\n62.\nIn\nState of Haryana v. Pala & Ors.\n, reported in (1996) 8 SCC\n51, this Court had the occasion to explain the difference between\nthe primary effect of the injuries and the secondary effect of the\ninjuries. In the said case, the victim was hit on his head three\ntimes and after the victim had fallen the other accused had beaten\nhim thrice on his chest and abdomen. The victim was taken to the\nhospital; he died several days later in the hospital. In the said case\nthe doctor’s opinion as regards the cause of death was as follows:-\n\n“Cause of the death was due to Septicemia, which\nresulted as a result of the head injury and was\nsufficient to cause death in ordinary course of\nnature”\n\n63. It was contended on behalf of the accused before this Court that\nthe offence would not fall under any of the limbs of\nSection 300\nof\nthe IPC. This question was considered in the light of further\ninformation given by the doctors which is as follows:-\n\n“Septicemia is the direct result of the head-injury.\nThis is not a disease. In other words, head injury\nis the cause of death.”\n\n64. The trial court convicted the accused applying Clause 3 of\nSection\nunder\nSection 302\nof the IPC. On appeal the High Court\napplied Exception 4 to\nSection 300\nIPC and altered the offence of\nmurder into culpable homicide not amounting to murder and\nconvicted the accused under\nSection 304\nPart II of the\nIPC\n. In\nappeal before this Court, in paragraphs 3 and 4 respectively, of\nthe judgment the Court held as follows:-\n\n“3. On the other hand he contended that when\ndeath was due to septicemia, it cannot be referable\nto the cause of the death in the ordinary course of\nnature due to ante-mortem injuries and that,\ntherefore, the offence of murder has not been made\nout. In support thereof, he sought to place reliance\non Lyon's Medical Jurisprudence for India (Tenth\n\nPage 35 of 42\n\nEdition) at page 222. It is stated therein that\n“Danger to life depends, primarily, on the amount\nof haemorrhage, on the organ wounded, and on\nthe extent of shock; secondarily, on secondary\nhaemorrhage, on the occurrence of septicemia,\nerysipelas, tetanus, or other complications. In\nanswering the question whether a wound is\ndangerous to life, the danger must be assessed on\nthe probable primary effects of the injury. Such\npossibilities as the occurrence of tetanus or\nsepticemia, later on, are not to be taken into\nconsideration”. Though the learned counsel had\nnot read the latter part of the opinion, the medical\nevidence on record do clearly establish that\nsepticemia is not the primary cause and the death\nwas due to injuries caused to the deceased and\nthey are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary\ncourse of nature. Septicemia would, therefore, not\nbe taken into account.\n\n4. Clause 3rdly of\nSection 300\nIPC envisages that\nif the act is done with the intention of causing\nbodily injury to any person and the bodily injury\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary\ncourse of nature to cause death, it would be\nmurder coming under\nSection 300\nIPC and that,\ntherefore, it would not be culpable homicide under\n\nSection 299\nIPC. When the accused emerged from\ntheir house and beat with deadly weapon on the\nhead and other parts of the body and death\noccurred as a result of the injuries, it must be\ninferred that the attack on vital parts of the body\nwas intended to be caused with an intention to\ncause death. Intention is locked up in the heart of\nthe assailant and the inference is to be drawn from\nacts and attending circumstances.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n65.\nIn\nJagtar Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab\n, reported in (1999)\n2 SCC 174, this Court was called upon to decide as to whether\nthe offence would fall within the scope of\nSection 302\nof the IPC\nwhen the death was due to septicemia. It was argued on behalf of\nthe accused persons that septicemia had occurred because of the\nimproper treatment given. It was further contended that if there\n\nPage 36 of 42\n\nhad been proper treatment the deceased would not have died. This\ncontention was negatived by the Court referring to Explanation 2\nto\nSection 299\nof IPC which reads as follows:-\n\n“Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily\ninjury, the person who causes such bodily injury\nshall be deemed to have caused the death,\nalthough by resorting to proper remedies and\nskillful treatment the death might have been\nprevented.”\n\n66. In paragraph 7 of the judgment this Court held as follows:-\n\n“7. Having given our anxious consideration to the\nfirst contention of Mr. Gujral, we do not find any\nsubstance in it. It is true that Naib Singh died 16\ndays after the incident due to septicemia, but Dr\nM.P. Singh (PW 1), who held the post-mortem\nexamination, categorically stated that the\nsepticemia was due to the head injury sustained\nby Naib Singh and that the injury was sufficient in\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause death. From\nthe impugned judgment, we find that the above\ncontention was raised on behalf of the appellants\nand in rejecting the same, the High Court\nobserved:\n\n“It is well settled that culpable homicide is not\nmurder when the case is brought within the\nfive exceptions to\nSection 300\nPenal Code,\n1860. But even though none of the said five\nexceptions is pleaded or prima facie\nestablished on the evidence on record, the\nprosecution must still be required under the\nlaw to bring the case under any of the four\nclauses, firstly to fourthly, of\nSection 300\nPenal\nCode, 1860, to sustain the charge of murder.\nInjury 1 was the fatal injury. When this injury\nis judged objectively from the nature of it and\nother evidence including the medical opinion of\nDr M.P. Singh (PW 1), we are of the considered\nview that the injury was intended to be caused\nwith the intention of causing such a bodily\ninjury by Harbans Singh, the appellant on the\nperson of Naib Singh which was sufficient in\n\nPage 37 of 42\n\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause\ndeath….”\nOn a perusal of the evidence of PW 1 in the light of\nExplanation 2 to\nSection 299\nIPC, we are in\ncomplete agreement with the above-quoted\nobservations of the High Court.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n67.\nIn the present case, as per the oral testimony of the three doctors\n\nreferred to above\n, the cause of death of deceased Rekhchand was\ncardiorespiratory failure. The injuries suffered by him at the time\nof assault lead to septic shock with bilateral pneumonia, post\ntraumatic spinal cord injury with paraplegia and infected bedsore\nhepatic dysfunction. The injuries suffered by the deceased were\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and\nwould come under clause “Thirdly” of\nSection 300\nof the IPC. The\ndeceased ultimately died having not recovered from the injuries.\n\nThe presence of the supervening cause in the circumstances will\nnot, in our view, alter the culpability. In the case in hand, there\nhad been no such considerable change of circumstances as to\nsnap the chain of causation. It would have been quite a different\nmatter if the original injuries had healed meanwhile or ceased to\nbe dangerous to life and the fatal complications had set in\nunexpectedly. If that would have been so, the appellant herein\nwould then at any rate be entitled to the benefit of doubt as to the\ncause of death.\n\n68. We are taken by surprise as to on what basis the High Court has\nrecorded a finding that the deceased succumbed to the injuries\nsuffered by him due to lack of proper treatment. There is\nabsolutely no evidence in this regard. Not a single suggestion in\nthis regard was put by the defence counsel in the cross-\nexamination of the doctors. Even otherwise this aspect is wholly\n\nPage 38 of 42\n\nirrelevant in view of Explanation 2 to\nSection 299\nIPC. In other\nwords, according to the High Court, since, the deceased died after\nabout nine months from the date of the incident due to lack of\nproper treatment the case is not one of murder. This finding in our\nopinion is erroneous. On one hand, the High Court believes that\nthe cause of death was due to injuries suffered by the deceased,\nand on the other hand, takes the view that as he died after nine\nmonths due to lack of proper treatment the offence would fall\nwithin\nSection 307\nof the IPC.\n\nE. CONCLUSION\n\n69. We may highlight few broad principles that the courts must keep\nin mind.\n\na. If it is proved that the injury was fatal and the intention was to\ncause death, though the death occurred after several days of\nsepticaemia or other complications having supervened, yet it is\nundoubtedly a murder as it falls within the first limb of\nSection\nof the IPC.\n\nb. If it is proved that the injuries by themselves were sufficient to\ncause death in the ordinary course of nature, and if it is\nestablished that those injuries were the intended injuries,\nthough the death might have occurred after septicaemia or other\ncomplications had supervened, yet the act of the accused would\nsquarely fall under the third limb of\nSection 300\nof the IPC and\nthe accused is therefore liable to be punished under\nSection 302\n\nof the IPC.\n\nc. If it is proved that the injuries were imminently dangerous to\nlife, though the death had occurred after septicaemia or other\ncomplications had supervened, yet the act of the accused would\n\nPage 39 of 42\n\nsquarely fall under the fourth limb of\nSection 300\nof the IPC,\nprovided, the other requirements like knowledge on the part of\nthe accused, etc. are satisfied and so the accused would be liable\nto be punished under\nSection 302\nof the IPC. Here also, the\nprimary cause of the death is the injuries and septicaemia.\n\nd. In judging whether the injuries inflicted were sufficient in the\nordinary course of nature to cause death, the possibility that\nskilful and efficient medical treatment might prevent the fatal\nresult is wholly irrelevant.\n\ne. If the supervening causes are attributable to the injuries caused,\nthen the person inflicting the injuries is liable for causing death,\neven if death was not the direct result of the injuries.\n\nf. Broadly speaking, the courts would have to undertake the\nexercise to distinguish between two types of cases; first, where\nthe intervening cause of death, like peritonitis, is only a remote\nand a rather improbable consequence of the injury; then it can\nbe said that the injury is one which may, in particular\ncircumstances, result in death, but which may not in ordinary\ncourse of nature be likely to lead to it. Secondly, where the\ncomplication which is the intervening cause of death is itself a\npractically inevitable sequence to the injury. In that event, the\nprobability is very high indeed, amounting to practical certainty\ni.e., death is a result in due course of natural events. A deep\nabdominal thrust with a knife followed by injury to the internal\norgans is practically certain to result in acute peritonitis causing\ndeath. It is clearly a case of murder under\nSection 302\nand not\nmerely of culpable homicide.\n\nPage 40 of 42\n\ng. Even when the medical evidence does not say that any one of\nthe injuries on the body of the deceased was sufficient to cause\ndeath in the ordinary course of nature, yet it is open to the Court\nto look into the nature of the injuries found on the body of the\ndeceased and infer from them that the assailants intended to\ncause death of the deceased. If none of the injuries alone were\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of\nthe deceased, cumulatively, they may be sufficient in the\nordinary course of nature to cause his death.\n\nh. What the courts must see is whether the injuries were sufficient\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or to cause such\nbodily injuries as the accused knew to be likely to cause death\nalthough death was ultimately due to supervention of some\nother cause. An intervening cause or complication is by itself not\nof such significance. What is significant is whether death was\nonly a remote possibility, or is one which would have occurred\nin due course.\n\ni. To sum it up, where death is delayed due to later complications\nor developments, the courts should consider the nature of the\ninjury, complications or the attending circumstances. If the\ncomplications or developments are the natural, or probable, or\nnecessary consequence of the injury, and if it is reasonably\ncontemplated as its result, the injury could be said to have\ncaused death. If on the other hand, the chain of consequences\nis broken, or if there is unexpected complication causing new\nmischief, the relation of cause and effect is not established, or\nthe causal connection is too remote then the injury cannot be\nsaid to have caused death. If the original injury itself is of a fatal\nnature, it makes no difference that death is actually caused by\n\nPage 41 of 42\n\na complication naturally flowing from the injury and not the\ninjury itself, since causal connection is proximate.\n\n70. In view of the aforesaid, all that we can say is that the High Court\ncommitted a serious error in bringing the case within the ambit of\nattempt to commit murder punishable under\nSection 307\nof the\nIPC on the ground that the victim survived for almost nine months\nfrom the date of the incident, and died on account of pneumonia\nand other complications during the course of treatment and not\ndue to the injuries suffered at the time of assault. We do not agree\nwith the view expressed by the High Court in the Impugned\nJudgment and order.\n\n71. In the circumstances\nreferred to above\n, we reach the conclusion\nthat there is no merit in the appeal and the same is accordingly\ndismissed.\n\n72. Pending application, if any, also stands disposed of.\n\n…………………………………………J\n(J.B. PARDIWALA)\n\n…………………………………………J\n(R. MAHADEVAN)\n\nNew Delhi;\n\n12th September, 2025.\n\nPage 42 of 42",
