Since the\ncandidates included in the Ranked Lists were not appointed, they filed writ\npetitions seeking appropriate directions for their appointments.\nSeveral petitions were filed by individual candidates included in the\nRanked Lists, and the dates and events would differ in each matter, but the\nlegal issue being the same in all the appeals, they are dealt with by this\ncommon judgment.\n\nW.A.

From Group 'B', the\nappeals filed by the Petitioners/Candidates are W.A. Nos. 608/2021,\n622/2021 and 637/2021. There is another petition, that is, W.P.(C) No.\n1866/2020, filed by the candidates included in the Ranked List, who\nbelong to the Other Backward Class. This petition was disposed of by\njudgment dated 23 February 2021 (Amit Rawal, J.). From that judgment,\nW.A. No. 853/2021 is filed by the Petitioners/Candidates.\n\n5. The Appellant - State and the Appellant - Kerala State Co-operative\nBank Limited in the appeals arising from Group 'A' petitions are referred to\nas 'the Appellants'.

The Ranked List as per the Kerala Public Service Commission Rules of\nProcedure for the post of Clerk/Cashier in respect of Thiruvananthapuram\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:121:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nDistrict Co-operative Bank was published on 22 March 2017; for Kollam\nDistrict Co-operative Bank, on 18 January 2017; for Pathanamthitta\nDistrict Co-operative Bank, on 31 January 2017; for Alappuzha District\nCo-operative Bank, on 23 February 2017; for Kottayam District Co-\noperative Bank, on 22 December 2016; for Idukki District Co-operative\nBank, on 10 January 2017; for Ernakulam District Co-operative Bank, on 6\nJanuary 2017; for Thrissur District Co-operative Bank, on 22 December\n2016 and 30 December 2016; for Palakkad District Co-operative Bank, on\n6 January 2017; for Malappuram District Co-operative Bank, on 31 January\n2017; for Kozhikode District Co-operative Bank, on 7 February 2017; for\nWayanad District Co-operative Bank, on 18 January 2017; for Kannur and\nKasaragod District Co-operative Banks, on 23 January 2017. Act 1 of 2019\ncame into force on 14 February 2019, which amended Schedule I appended\nto the Act of 1969, consequently modifying the categories of societies for\nwhich the KPSC could carry out recruitment under Act 5 of 1996. All the\nPetitioners/Candidates were included in the said Ranked Lists after the\nselection process was concluded for appointment to the post of\nClerk/Cashier in the District Banks.\n\n7. For the purpose of brevity, we refer to the facts in one petition each\nfrom both Group 'A' and Group 'B', and the orders passed therein.\n\n8. From Group 'A' (judgment in favour of the candidates), the facts in\nW.P.(C) No. 26491 of 2017 are as follows. The KPSC by notification dated\n15 March 2014, invited applications for appointment to the post of\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:122:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nClerk/Cashier in various District Co-operative Banks in the State. On 15\nMarch 2014, the KPSC issued another notification inviting applications\nfrom employees of various Primary Co-operative Societies affiliated to the\nconcerned District Co-operative Banks, in the quota earmarked for them, as\nprovided under Rule 187 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Rules, 1969\n(Rules of 1969). Petitioner Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7 applied for the post in the\ngeneral category and Petitioner No. 4, 5, 6 and 8 applied in the quota\nearmarked for employees of Primary Co-operative Societies. The test was\nconducted, and the Ranked List came into force with effect from 7 February\n2017. However, the Ranked List was not given effect to. The grievance\nraised by the Petitioners therein is that though 23 posts were reported to the\nKPSC, not even a single appointment has been made. If the Petitioners are\nappointed against the existing vacancies, even if the State Bank comes into\nexistence, they will be absorbed along with the existing employees.\nAccordingly, by this petition, the Petitioners prayed for the issuance of a\nwrit of mandamus directing the Bank to report all vacancies in the cadre of\nClerk/Cashier to the KPSC.\n\n9. The learned Single Judge (Devan Ramachandran, J.) disposed of W.P.\n(C) No. 26491 of 2017 along with other petitions by judgment dated 12\nJuly 2022 (Ground 'A'), observing that going by Section 74H of the Act 1\nof 2019 which was introduced through amendment in the year 2019, all\nproceedings suits, decrees, recovery certificates, appeals and other legal\nproceedings, pending or existing immediately before such amalgamation,\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:123:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nshall continue against the transferee Bank. The learned Single Judge also\nobserved that it was relevant to verify the number of vacancies available at\nthe time when the Ranked Lists in question came into force, when the\nDistrict Banks were in existence. It was also observed that directions were\nissued in respect of the Kannur District Co-operative Bank, which were\nrequired to be issued in all these cases, and proceeded to dispose of the writ\npetitions by the following directions:\n\n\"In the afore circumstances, these writ petitions are\nordered with the following directions:\n\na) The Registrar of the Co-operative Societies -\n\neither himself or through a constituted Authority or team\nof experts - will evaluate the financial status of each of the\nerstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the\nMalappuram District Co-operative Bank at the time when\nthe judgment in W.P.(C) Nos.201/2018 and\n11228/2019 were issued and then decide notionally what\nposts would be available to each of them at that time,\nstrictly in terms of the directions in the said judgment. For\nthis purpose, I order the petitioners to make available a\ncopy of the said judgment before the Registrar within a\nperiod of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis judgment.\n\nb) On the Registrar thus evaluating the staff position\nof the various erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and\nthe Malappuram District Co-operative Bank, necessary\norders consequent to their merger with the Kerala Bank -\nsave in the case of the Malappuram District Co-operative\nBank, will also be issued; in which event, the claims of the\npetitioners and similarly situated persons, as also of all\nother persons in the Rank Lists, will be evaluated and\neffectively modulated.\n\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:124:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nc) While doing so, the Registrar will consider the\ncontentions of the petitioners in these cases that, during\nthe pendency of the Rank Lists and when interim orders\nof this Court were holding the field with respect to the\nnotification of vacancies to the PSC, unqualified and\nunauthorized persons have been appointed by each of the\nerstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the\nMalappuram District Co-operative Bank and that too in\nviolation of the statutory ratio for such purpose between\npromotions and direct recruitments. For this purpose, I\nallow the petitioners to file their written objections in this\nregard before the Registrar within a period of one month\nfrom the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, so that\nsaid Authority can then consider each of such contentions,\nbased on the factual circumstances relating to the\nindividual erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the\nMalappuram District Co-operative Bank; thus leading to a\ndecision as to how many vacancies should be earmarked\nfor direct recruitment, after cancellation of the earlier\nappointments made or after setting aside the same, in\nterms of law. In this process of course, every person\neffected will also be given an opportunity of being heard.\nIn other words, while the afore exercise is undertaken and\ncompleted, the Registrar will verify whether the\npromotions pointed out by the petitioners in these cases,\nas also appointments made during the time when the\nRank Lists was in force, were in order and if not, issue\nappropriate orders with respect to it within the statutory\nScheme and the provisions of the by-laws of the\nindividual Societies, as the case may be. A consideration of\nthese aspects shall be reflected in the resultant order.\n\n(d) Needless to say, except in the case of the\nMalappuram District Co-operative Bank, the afore\nexercises shall be completed only after hearing the\ncompetent official of the Kerala Bank also because, even if\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:125:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nvacancies are available, it would be within their\nprerogative to choose not to fill it up; however, taking care\nthat no unauthorized promotion or unauthorized\nappointment had been effected in the erstwhile District\nCo-operative Bank prior to such amalgamation.\n\n(e) Finally, it does not require this Court to say\nspecifically but, as regards the vacancies that have already\nbeen reported on the orders of this Court, the sole factum\nof the expiry of the Rank List will not stand in the way of\nthe petitioners being granted benefits; provided they are\nfound eligible based on the ranking in the said List, as also\nother criteria and qualifications as are imperative.\n\n(f) As a corollary to the afore directions, I further\nclarify that if the enquiry with respect to the impugned\npromotions or appointments during the pendency of the\nRank Lists would require more time, then the Registrar\nwould be free to evaluate the vacancies as directed in (a)\nabove and to allow the PSC to make advices against the\nsame at the first instance.\n\n(g) As far as the impugned promotions and\nappointments made during the period of the Rank Lists is\nconcerned, if any of them are found to be illegal, then\ncorresponding orders will be issued to the PSC to issue\nadvice from the Rank List which has now expired;\nhowever, within the limits of the vacancies that have been\nordered and reported consequent to the directions of this\nCourt.\n\n(h) The afore exercises shall be completed as\nexpeditiously as is possible but not later than a period of\nsix months from the date of receipt of a copy of this\njudgment; however, leaving liberty to the Registrar to act\nearlier in terms of the aforesaid directions in the case of\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:126:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nvacancies in which the question of promotion or\nunauthorized appointments do not come into play.\n\n(i) Qua claims of some of the petitioners in these\ncases with respect to vacancies in the Community Quotas\nand others are concerned, they will also be assessed by the\nRegistrar in terms of the statutory mechanisms and\nresultant orders issued. For this purpose, I direct the\npetitioners, who are so interested, to impel such\ncontentions before the Registrar through a written\npetition, which may either be in addition to the ones\nmentioned in the aforementioned directions or\nindependently.\"\n\n***\n\nThese were the directions issued while disposing of Group 'A' petitions.\n\n10. In Group 'B', we refer to the facts in W.P.(C) No. 29057 of 2019,\nfiled by fifteen candidates who were included in the Ranked List for\nappointment to the post of Clerk/Cashier. W.P.(C) No. 29057 of 2019 was\nfiled by fifteen Petitioners concerning the Alappuzha District Co-operative\nBank Ltd. The case and grievance of these Petitioners are: as on the date on\nwhich the Ranked List was brought into force, that is 23 February 2017, a\nlarge number of vacancies in the post of Clerk/Cashier were lying vacant in\nvarious branches of the Bank, but, ignoring the ratio stipulated in the Model\nRecruitment Rules for the District Co-operative Banks, 1998, all these\nvacancies were being filled up by promoting persons who are working in the\nfeeder post. From 23 February 2017 to 22 December 2020, the vacancies\narisen in various branches of the Respondent Bank are as follows. From 23\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:127:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nFebruary 2017 to 22 February 2020, 46 retirement vacancies; from 31\nMarch 2020 to 22 December 2020, 21 retirement vacancies; and from 2\nJune 2017 to 2 March 2018, 39 promotion vacancies. From the Ranked\nList, only 25 candidates were adviced for appointment to the post of\nClerk/Cashier, and during the period between 4 March 2017 and 6 July\n2019, eight posts of Clerk/Cashier were filled up by promoting persons\nworking as Peons. The Respondent Bank did not report the vacancies to the\nKPSC only with the intention of filling up those vacancies by departmental\nhands. The Government, by letter dated 19 October 2017, issued specific\ndirections to the Managers to promptly report all vacancies arising in the\nBanks to the KPSC. By circular dated 9 August 2016, the Registrar also\ndirected the Managers of all District Co-operative Banks not to fill up any\nvacancies arising in the Banks otherwise than in accordance with the\nprovisions of the\nKerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969\n, and the Rules\nframed thereunder. Apart from that, specific orders were issued by the\nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies, in continuation of the general orders\nissued by the State Government since 1971, which also mandate that the\nRespondent Bank is bound to report all vacancies to the KPSC well in\nadvance. The Government further issued another circular dated 20\nSeptember 2019, directing all appointing authorities to report, every year,\nall vacancies likely to arise during the succeeding year.\n\n11. The facts in Group 'B' petitions are broadly identical for the purpose\nof deciding the legal questions involved. The learned Single Judge (Amit\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:128:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nRawal, J.), who heard this petition along with W.P.(C) No. 31786 of 2018,\nobserved that the factum of amalgamation could not be ignored so as to\nissue directions to a Bank that was no longer in existence, and accordingly,\ndismissed the petition by judgment dated 25 January 2021.\n\n12. Before the validity of the Ranked Lists expired, interim orders were\npassed in favour of the Petitioners/Candidates in all the writ petitions,\ndirecting the reporting of vacancies, keeping the question as regards the\navailability of vacancies to be decided at an appropriate stage. This is a\nposition common to all the petitions.\n\n13. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The learned\nAdvocate General Mr. K. Gopalakrishna Kurup along with Mr. Imam\nGregorios Karat, learned Government Pleader, appeared for the State. Mr.\nP. C. Sasidharan, learned Advocate appeared for the Appellant - Kerala\nBank. Dr. K. P. Satheesan, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Mr. P.\nMohandas, and Mr. George Poonthottam, learned Senior Advocate, along\nwith Mr. O. V. Maniprasad, Mr. B. S. Swathi Kumar, Mr. M. R. Anison, and\nMr. T. R. Harikumar, learned counsel, represent the Petitioners/Candidates.\n\n14. The appeals from Group 'A' petitions have been filed by the District\nBanks and the State Government. Therefore, we had queried the learned\nAdvocate General regarding the reason why the State Government has\nchosen to file these appeals when the dispute essentially concerns the\nCo-operative Societies and the employees. According to the learned\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:129:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nAdvocate General, the State Government has preferred the appeals as it has\ncertain statutory functions to discharge under various enactments. Merely\nbecause the statutory provisions enable the State Government to regulate\nthe affairs of the Co-operative Societies to a certain extent, the State does\nnot become a party to the lis between the society and its employees. As to\nthe contention of the learned Advocate General that the State has filed the\nappeals because directions were issued to the Registrar of Co-operative\nSocieties, the Petitioners pointed out that it is the statutory duty of the\nRegistrar, and that the learned Single Judge, in exercise of writ jurisdiction\nin a lis between the society and its employees, merely issued directions to\nthe statutory authorities. The learned counsel for the Petitioners also\nsubmitted that this group of appeals was filed by the State because this\nlitigation is a result of political interference. Be that as it may, since the\nchallenge to the impugned judgment is already before us through the\nappeals filed by the Banks, we have heard the learned Advocate General for\nthe State and Banks on their respective contentions.\n\n15. For the Appellant - State, the learned Advocate General Mr. K.\nGopalakrishna Kurup, and for the Appellant - Kerala Bank, the learned\ncounsel Mr. P. C. Sasidharan, in short, submitted as follows. The action of\nthe Appellants is related to\nSection 74H\nof the Act of 1969. Though the\nvalidity of Section 74H was challenged, the challenge was negatived by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in the case of Saidalavi Master M. v. State of\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:130:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nKerala1, affirming the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of\n\nLathif U.A., MLA v. State of Kerala2\n.\nSection 80(3A)\nwas inserted by Act 6\nof 1995. Under\nSection 80(3A)\n, the candidates are to be recruited to the\nCo-operative Societies by the KPSC. The Kerala Co-operative Societies\n(Amendment) Act, 1996 (the Act of 1996) was enacted to grant special\npowers. As per the definition of \"society\" in the Act of 1996, it would mean\nto be a \"society\" in\nSchedule I of the Act\nof 1969. Schedule I to\nSection\n80(3A)\nwas amended and the reference to the District Banks in Schedule I\nwas taken away. Consequently, the KPSC cannot issue advice for candidates\nto the District Level Co-operative Societies. Under Section 74H(13), a\nspecific provision has been made for employees whereby only permanent\nemployees are eligible to be absorbed on Amalgamation and the obligation\nof the State Bank extends only to the absorption of such permanent\nemployees. Pursuant to Rule 28A(5), the Government of Kerala, in exercise\nof its powers under Section 74H, has framed the Kerala State Co-operative\nBank Recruitment Rules, 2023, under which the post of Clerk/Cashier is\nnow regulated. These Rules came into effect on 2 August 2021, and any\nappointment to the State Bank made thereafter has to be in accordance with\nthe selection process prescribed under the said Recruitment Rules.\nTherefore, the impugned direction to give effect to this Ranked List for\nadvice on non-existent entities is erroneous and needs to be set aside.\n\n16. For the Petitioners/Candidates, Mr. K. P. Satheesan and Mr. George\n1 2024 (3) KLT 469\n2 2023 (6) KLT 183\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:131:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nPoonthottam, the learned Senior Advocates, Mr. O. V. Maniprasad and\nMr. B. S. Swathi Kumar, the other learned counsel submitted, in brief, as\nfollows. Interim orders have been passed to report vacancies and challenge\nto the said interim orders have been dismissed. Thus, the Ranked Lists\nremain valid. There are other provisions in the Act of 1969 which govern\nAmalgamation than Section 74H.\nSection 14A(6)\nis indicative of the fact\nthat there is no complete extinction of the District Banks. Section 74H(12)\nstates that all writ petitions filed before the Amalgamation will continue and\nthe Court has the power to issue directions to the Bank. The contention of\nthe Appellants that no appointment can be made to the District Banks in\nview of the amalgamation and amendment to\nSection 80(3A)\nof the Act of\n1969 is incorrect. The KPSC is statutorily bound to advise candidates to the\nvacancies reported under the said Act, and the overriding effect of Section\n74H(18) extends over\nSection 80(3A)\n. Under Section 74H(12), all legal\nproceedings or obligations existing before the amalgamation continue to\nbind the transferee bank. Hence, the obligation to report vacancies and the\ncorresponding power of the KPSC to advice candidates subsist even after\nthe merger. The order of amalgamation was issued on 29 November 2019,\nand Section 74H came into force only from that date. Therefore, till 29\nNovember 2019, appointments were governed by\nSection 80(3A)\n. The\nvacancies that arose prior to the date of amalgamation are liable to be\nreported to the KPSC, which, in turn, was bound to advice candidates from\nthe Ranked Lists that remained valid. The material on record show that 130\nvacancies existed in the Kozhikode District Co-operative Bank, though only\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:132:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\n40 appointments were made from Exhibits-P3 and P4 Ranked Lists, in\nviolation of the prescribed 1:5 ratio between promotion and direct\nrecruitment. The order of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and the\nVigilance reports further support the contention of the Petitioners that\nappointments should have been made from the said Ranked Lists, as several\nposts were filled from the list of 2006, which is stated to have expired on 30\nJuly 2014. The Petitioners are meritorious candidates duly selected through\nthe statutory process, and they cannot be deprived of appointment for\nreasons beyond their control. The KPSC has not challenged the impugned\njudgments and thus has accepted that it is not divested of the powers to\nrender advice even after amalgamation, which fact is clear from the\nappointments made from such Ranked Lists to some District Banks, such as\nthe Idukki District Co-operative Bank. The Appellants are acting arbitrarily\nunder political considerations, picking and choosing candidates from the\nRanked Lists, and the manner in which the State has prosecuted the\nlitigation is indicative of political interference in the appointment process.\nThe proposal of the employer Banks for the regularisation of temporary\nemployees also demonstrates the continued requirement of personnel,\nreinforcing the claim for advice and appointment through KPSC from the\nvalid Ranked Lists. The Petitioners/Candidates placed on record the order\npassed by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies on 8 June 2023, giving\neffect to the impugned judgment, which was subsequently withdrawn by\nthe Registrar only on the ground that an appeal had been filed by the Bank\nand stay had been granted, but the fact that the vacancies existed and were\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:133:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nduly identified remains on record. Thus, the Appellants are taking divergent\nstands in respect of the Ranked Lists and their conduct shows that the\ncandidates are being subjected to illegal discrimination.\n\n17. We have considered the rival contentions.\n\n18. Though the issued involved in these groups of appeals is narrow, the\ndebate centres around the rights of the candidates in the select list for\nappointment to the post in the District Banks after their merger with the\nState Bank. The basic position is that the Kerala Public Service Commission\n(KPSC) had invited applications from eligible candidates for appointment\nto the post of Clerk/Cashier in the erstwhile District Banks. Pursuant to the\nselection process, Ranked Lists were duly published. However, before\nappointments could be made, the Kerala Co-operative Societies\n(Amendment) Act, 2019 (Act 1 of 2019), which came into force on 14\nFebruary 2019, resulted in the amalgamation of the District Banks with the\nState Bank. The question that arises in these appeals is the status and rights\nof these Petitioners/Candidates on the Ranked Lists for appointments in the\nDistrict Banks.\n\n19. The statutory provisions in the subject matter cover two sets of\nlegislation and rules. One governing the Co-operative Societies, and the\nsecond governing the Public Service Commission. A brief overview would\nbe necessary.\n\n20. The Co-operative Societies in Kerala, such as the District Banks, are\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:134:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\ngoverned by the provisions of the\nKerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969\n\n(Act of 1969).\nThe Act\nof 1969 provides for the registration, regulation,\nand other regulatory provisions relating to the Co-operative Societies. As\nregards the recruitment and service conditions of officers and servants of the\nCo-operative Societies,\nSection 80(3A)\nof the Act of 1969 provides that,\nexcept for the Chief Executive Officer of the Society, all appointments to\nthe posts of officers and servants of the Society specified in Schedule I, for\nwhich direct recruitment is resorted to, shall be made from the select list of\ncandidates furnished by the KPSC after following the prescribed rules.\n\nSchedule I of the Act\nof 1969 included fourteen District Banks, in addition\nto the Apex Societies.\n\n21.\nSection 14\nof the Act of 1969 provides that Co-operative Societies\nmay, with the prior approval of the Registrar, amalgamate or merge, transfer\ntheir assets and liabilities, and also effect division of the Societies.\nIn the Act\n\n1 of 2019, new\nSection 14A\nwas also introduced which provides for\nprovisions regarding transfer of assets and liabilities of the District Banks to\nthe State Bank.\n\n22. By notification dated 14 February 2019, the Government of Kerala\nenacted the Kerala Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2019 (Act 1\nof 2019), which amended\nSection 2\nof the Act of 1969 by substituting\nclause (ia) and inserting clause (ka) regarding the Kerala State Co-operative\nBank. The consequence of Act 1 of 2019 led to the amalgamation of\nDistrict Banks to the State Bank.\n\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:135:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\n23. The Kerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions as\nRespects Certain Societies) Act, 1996 (Act 5 of 1996), the other set, is in\nrespect of recruitment (at the relevant time) of officers and servants of the\nCo-operative Societies.\nSection 2(b)\nof the Act 5 of 1996 defines \"society\"\nto mean a Co-operative Society mentioned in the\nSchedule to the Act\nof\n1969. Act 1 of 2019 amended\nSchedule I of the Act\nof 1969, whereby\nSerial Nos. 16 to 29 and the entries against them were omitted. The entries\nat Serial Nos. 16 to 19 pertained to various District Banks in the State. They\nincluded Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha,\nKottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram,\nKozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod District Co-operative Banks\nLimited. Consequently, with effect from 14 February 2019, the District\nBanks mentioned from Serial Nos. 16 to 29 in the Schedule stood excluded\nfrom the definition of \"society\" under\nSection 2(b)\nof the Act 5 of 1996.\n\n24.\nChapter XC of the Act\nof 1969 provides for special provisions\nrelating to amalgamation through transfer of assets and liabilities of the\nDistrict Banks to the State Bank. It would be fruitful to reproduce Section\n74H, which is relevant to the present controversy and sets out the\nconsequences of such amalgamation. Section 74H reads thus:\n\n\"74H - Amalgamation of District Co-operative\nBanks to the Kerala State Co-operative Bank.- (1)\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any\nother law for the time being in force, the Registrar shall\norder the amalgamation of District Co-operative Banks in\nKerala with the Kerala State Co-operative Bank on the\nW.A.

As per Government Order dated 24 March 2023, issued by the\nSecretary of the Co-operation Department, Government of Kerala, in\nexercise of the powers conferred under sub-section (14) of\nSection 74H\nof\nthe Act 1 of 2019, read with sub-rule (5) of Rule 28A in Chapter IIIA of\nthe Co-operative Societies Amendment Rules, the Government have\nnotified the Kerala State Co-operative Bank Recruitment Rules, 2023\n(Recruitment Rules of 2023), which had come into force on 2 August\n2021. The Government Order shows that the State Bank would take steps\nto fill up the vacancies strictly in line with the modified Recruitment Rules\nagainst the existing vacancies. Rule II of the Recruitment Rules of 2023\nprovides for the categorisation of service. Under Rule II, the post of Clerk/\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:139:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nCashier falls under Category No. 11. Rule III provides for appointment. As\nper Rule III, appointments to the post of Clerk/Cashier shall be made by\nDirect Recruitment through the KPSC and by transfer appointment on the\nbasis of combined seniority from among the persons holding lower posts,\nwho possess the required qualification and three years service in the\nrespective posts. It is also stated that the ratio for the direct recruitment and\npromotion shall be 3:1. This, in brief, is the statutory scheme.\n\n26. As stated earlier, the common factor is that all the Petitioners were\nincluded in the Ranked Lists prior to the amalgamation on 14 February\n2019. All the Petitioners, on varying dates, secured interim orders in their\nfavour, by which their placement in the Ranked Lists was protected subject\nto the outcome of the writ petitions, and by virtue of these interim orders,\nthe life of the Ranked Lists is not deemed to have lapsed. It is pertinent to\nnote, which we will elaborate on later, that no appeal is filed by the KPSC\neven though the KPSC was a party to the writ petitions.\n\n27. The first question, therefore, arises is regarding the right of\ncandidates who are placed on the Ranked Lists. The Constitution Bench in\nthe case of\nShankarsan Dash v. Union of India3\n, considered a reference\nmade to it for examining whether a candidate whose name appears on the\nmerit list on the basis of a competitive examination acquires an indefeasible\nright for appointment when a vacancy exists. At paragraph 7, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court observed that even where a number of vacancies are notified\n\n3 (1991) 3 SCC 47\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:140:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nfor appointment and an adequate number of candidates are found fit, the\nsuccessful candidates do not thereby acquire an indefeasible right to be\nappointed, as ordinarily, the notification merely amounts to an invitation to\nthe qualified candidates to apply for recruitment, and on their selection,\nthey do not acquire any right to the post also. Unless the relevant\nrecruitment rules so indicate, the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or\nany of the vacancies. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, however, cautioned that\nthis does not mean that the State instrumentality has the licence to act in an\narbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken\nbona fide for appropriate reasons, and if the vacancies or any of them are\nfilled up, the State is bound to respect the comparative merit of the\ncandidates as reflected at the recruitment test, and no discrimination can be\npermitted.\n\nThis position has been consistently followed, as noted in the\ndecisions in\nState of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha4\n,\nMiss Neelima\nShangla v. State of Haryana5\n, or\nJitendra Kumar v. State of Punjab6\n.\n\nIn the\ncase of\nAsha Kaul (Mrs.) and Another v. State of Jammu and Kashmir\n7, a\ntwo-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court took a review of the legal\nposition on the subject and observed as follows:\n\n\"8. It is true that mere inclusion in the select list does not\nconfer upon the candidates included therein an indefeasible\nright to appointment (\nState of Haryana v. Subhash Chander\nMarwaha\n[(1974) 3 SCC 220: AIR 1973 SC 2216]; Mani\n\n4 AIR 1973 SC 2216\n5 AIR 1987 SC 169\n6 AIR 1984 SC 1850\n7 (1993) 2 SCC 573\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:141:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nSubrat Jain v. State of Haryana [(1977) 1 SCC 486: AIR\n1977 SC 276];\nState of Kerala v. A. Lakshmikutty\n[(1986)\n4 SCC 632: AIR 1987 SC 331]) but that is only one aspect\nof the matter. The other aspect is the obligation of the\nGovernment to act fairly. The whole exercise cannot be\nreduced to a farce. Having sent a requisition/request to the\nCommission to select a particular number of candidates for\na particular category, -- in pursuance of which the\nCommission issues a notification, holds a written test,\nconducts interviews, prepares a select list and then\ncommunicates to the Government -- the Government\ncannot quietly and without good and valid reasons nullify\nthe whole exercise and tell the candidates when they\ncomplain that they have no legal right to appointment. We\ndo not think that any Government can adopt such a stand\nwith any justification today.\n\nThis aspect has been dealt with\nby a Constitution Bench of this Court in\nShankarsan Dash\nv. Union of India\n[(1991) 3 SCC 47: (1991) 17 ATC 95]\nwhere the earlier decisions of this Court are also noted. The\nfollowing observations of the Court are apposite: (SCC pp.\n50-51, para 7)\n\"It is not correct to say that if a number of\nvacancies are notified for appointment and\nadequate number of candidates are found fit, the\nsuccessful candidates acquire an indefeasible right\nto be appointed which cannot be legitimately\ndenied. Ordinarily the notification merely\namounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to\napply for recruitment and on their selection they\ndo not acquire any right to the post. Unless the\nrelevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State is\nunder no legal duty to fill up all or any of the\nvacancies. However, it does not mean that the\nState has the licence of acting in an arbitrary\nmanner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:142:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nhas to be taken bona fide for appropriate reasons.\nAnd if the vacancies or any of them are filled up,\nthe State is bound to respect the comparative\nmerit of the candidates, as reflected at the\nrecruitment test, and no discrimination can be\npermitted.\n\nThis correct position has been\nconsistently followed by this Court, and we do\nnot find any discordant note in the decisions in\n\nState of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha\n\n[(1974) 3 SCC 220:\nAIR 1973 SC 2216],\nNeelima Shangla v. State of Haryana\n[(1986) 4\nSCC 268] or Jatendra Kumar v. State of Punjab\n[(1985) 1 SCC 122: 1985 SCC (L&S) 174].\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n***\nTherefore, the legal position is that, though the candidates do not acquire an\nindefeasible right merely by being placed on the merit list, the recruiting\nauthority cannot act arbitrarily, and once it proceeds to make appointments\nfrom the Ranked Lists, the remaining candidates on the list will have to be\ntreated equally as per their placements.\n\n28. The learned counsel for the Petitioners also have not advanced any\nextreme proposition that candidates on the select list have an absolute right\nto be appointed. Instead, they relied upon the above legal position to\ncontend that the Appellants have acted arbitrarily in breach of the rights of\nthe Petitioners enshrined under\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. It is\ntheir contention that the amalgamation of the Banks is not an absolute\nextinction of the District Banks, and that, therefore, out of extraneous\nconsiderations, appointments have been made for some selected District\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:143:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nBanks, for which no explanation has been coming forth. When the selection\nprocess was conducted by the KPSC by notification dated 15 March 2014,\nthe statutory mandate required that the process under the Rules of 1969\nhad to be followed.\n\n29. The main contention of the Appellants is the factum of amalgamation\nand the legal and factual consequences.\nSection 14\nof the Act of 1969\nprovides for amalgamation, merger, transfer of assets and liabilities.\nSection\n14A\nprovides for transfer of assets and liabilities of the District Banks to the\nState Bank. The Appellants have also relied upon sub-section (13) of\nSection 74H to contend that only permanent and regular employees of the\ntransferee bank, or employees on probation serving in the employment of\nthe transferor bank, are protected, and that none of the Petitioners fall\nwithin Section 74H(13). The Petitioners have relied upon\nSection 14A(6)\n\nof the Act of 1969 which states that on and from the date of approval of the\ntransfer of assets and liabilities of each District Bank by the Registrar, all\npending suits or legal proceedings by or against such Banks shall be\ncontinued by the State Bank. The Petitioners pointed out that, though this\nprovision is not directly applicable to the issue at hand, it nevertheless\nindicates the legislative intent that there is no complete extinction of all\npositions prevailing on the date of amalgamation. The Petitioners have also\nrelied upon sub-sections (12) and (13) of\nSection 74H\nof the Act of 1969.\nSub-section (12) of Section 74H states that any proceedings, suits, decrees,\nrecovery certificates, appeals, and all other legal proceedings pending or\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:144:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nexisting immediately before the date of amalgamation before any Court or\nTribunal or any other authority, by or against the transferor banks may, as\nfrom the date of amalgamation be continued and enforced by or against the\ntransferee bank. Sub-section (13) states that every permanent and regular\nemployee of the transferor bank or employees on probation, serving in the\nemployment of the transferor bank immediately before the date of\namalgamation, shall become, on and from the date of amalgamation, an\nemployee of the transferee bank.\n\n30. We make reference to these provisions in the context of the broader\nprinciple that there can be various types and consequences of amalgamation,\nand that no absolute test can be applied uniformly for all forms of\namalgamation under different statutes. This aspect is elaborated by the\nSupreme Court in the case of Principal Commissioner of Income Tax\n(Central) - 2 v. M/s. Mahagun Realtors (P) Ltd.8, where the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court analysed the concept of amalgamation of two or more\nentities and observed that amalgamation is unlike the winding up of an\nentity. It was observed that in the case of amalgamation, the enterprises lives\non, but within a new residence. The Hon'ble Supreme Court emphasised\nthat it is, therefore, essential to look beyond the mere concept of destruction\nof entity.\nIn the said decision, reference was made to the decision in the case\nof\nSaraswati Industrial Syndicate v. Commissioner of Income Tax Haryana,\nHimachal Pradesh9\n. The basic legal principle emerging from the analysis of\n8 AIR 2022 SC 1672\n9 1990 Supp (1) SCR 332\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:145:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nlaw by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is that amalgamation has no precise\nmeaning, and that the true effect and character of amalgamation depend\nlargely on the terms of the scheme of merger and the legislation. Thus, the\nbroader principle is that there is no fixed connotation of amalgamation and,\nin the given set of statutory regulation, it need not amount to a complete\nextinction. Therefore, the contention of the Appellants that, pursuant to the\namalgamation, everything comes to an end is too absolute a proposition to\nbe accepted. The issue has to be examined in the backdrop of the facts of the\ncase and the manner in which the Appellants themselves have understood\nand proceeded on the legal position of amalgamation.\n\n31. This brings us to the contention of the Petitioners that the Appellants\nhave adopted contrary stands after the amalgamation in respect of the\nidentical Ranked List, acting in a most arbitrary manner. By the\ninterlocutory application in these appeals, it has been placed on record that\nlong after amalgamation, the Petitioners have given advices and\nappointments from the very same Ranked Lists in various District Banks\nacross the State between 30 March 2023 and 23 May 2024. The\nRespondents have furnished these details in the form of a chart. In some\nappeals, the Petitioners have placed on record the appointments made in\nrespect of the other co-operative banks such as Wayanad and\nThiruvananthapuram. It is also stated that a candidate was adviced by the\nKPSC for appointment to the post of Branch Manager in the District Co-\noperative Bank, Kasaragod, from the Ranked List of 25 August 2023.\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:146:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nThereafter, certain other appointments such as the posts of Peon/Watchman\nand Driver, were also made. According to the Appellants, these\nappointments were made pursuant to the directions issued by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, and no capital can be made out of the same. However, as\nthe Petitioners point out, the appointments made under the orders of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court are different, and as regards the appointment made\nto the post of Clerk/Cashier - Part III in respect of the District Co-operative\nBank, Idukki, nine fresh vacancies were reported on 29 May 2019, 12 June\n2019, 20 August 2019, 3 October 2019, and for Clerk/Cashier - Part I,\nnine vacancies were reported on 29 May 2019, 12 June 2019, 20 August\n2019, and 3 October 2019, and the advices were issued by the KPSC on 29\nJanuary 2020, which is beyond the amalgamation. No explanation\nwhatsoever is coming forth from the Appellants in respect of this, except to\nargue that the Petitioners/ Candidates had no legal right and the KPSC\ncannot issue advices in respect of the Banks which are no longer in\nexistence.\n\n32. This position highlights the arbitrariness with which the Appellants\nhave acted. From the very same Ranked Lists which, according to the\nAppellants, do not have any legal force for the KPSC to issue advice,\nappointments have nevertheless been made to certain District Banks. The\nAppellants have simply sidestepped this glaring discrimination. This\nconduct has to be viewed in the backdrop of the allegation of\nPetitioners/Candidates that there is political interference in the recruitment\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:147:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nprocess of officers and staff of the Co-operative Banks, and that the\nappointments are being given to a selected few for extraneous reasons. In\nlight of the appointments of candidates from identical select lists to various\nDistrict Banks and the manner in which the State has filed the appeals and\nprosecuted the litigation, it cannot be said that the contention of the\nPetitioners/Candidates is without merit.\n\n33. Next contention is regarding the power of the KPSC in view of the\namendment to\nSchedule I to the Act\nof 1969 by Act 1 of 2019. According\nto the Appellants, the KPSC has no jurisdiction to issue advice to the\nDistrict Banks. For the sake of reiteration, it is to be noted that as against\nthe direction of the learned Single Judge which would entail the KPSC to\nissue advices from the concerned Ranked Lists, the KPSC has not filed an\nappeal. Not only it has not filed an appeal but the KPSC has proceeded to\nissue advices in respect of Idukki District Co-operative Bank post merger to\nwhich no exception is taken by the Appellants. Therefore, this is the\nunderstanding of the KPSC, which we must take note of.\n\n34. It is quite obvious that the KPSC is a distinct entity, separate from the\nCo-operative Banks or the State. Prior to the Act 1 of 2019, appointments\nwere required to be made through the KPSC. When the notification was\nissued on 15 March 2014 and thereafter, the District Co-operative Societies\nwere under a statutory mandate to follow the procedure prescribed under\nthe Rules, which involved reporting of vacancies and the issuance of advices\nby the KPSC in respect of those vacancies.\n\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:148:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\n35. The procedure to be followed for recruitment to the Co-operative\nSocieties (as applicable) is set out in Rule 182(4) of the Rules of 1969. The\nKPSC has issued the Rules of Procedure in which\nSection 2(g)\ndefines\n\"ranked list\" to mean, list of candidates arranged in the order of merit, either\non the basis of the interview or examination. \"Examination\" is defined\nunder Rule 2(c) to include written, practical, physical efficiency, interview,\nand such other examinations which the Commission may deem fit to hold.\nThe Rule 2(a) defines \"Advice list\" to mean, the list of candidates drawn\nfrom the ranked list and arranged on the basis of rules of recruitment\nrelating to the post in respect of vacancies reported from time to time.\nUnder Rule 14, the Commission shall advise candidates for all the vacancies\nreported and pending before them and the vacancies which may be reported\nto them for the period during which the ranked lists are kept alive in the\norder of priority. Accordingly, after a due selection process, ranked lists were\nprepared, and they were in existence on the date when the Act 1 of 2019\nwas brought into force.\n\n36. The issue is whether the KPSC would lose its jurisdiction to render\nadvice after the Act 1 of 2019. The Appellants contend that after the\namendment, the powers of the KPSC do not extend to the District Banks.\nThe question, however, is whether the KPSC ceases to have the power to\nadvise appointments from the Ranked Lists which were already and validly\nprepared before the amending Act 1 of 2019, during the period when the\nKPSC admittedly had jurisdiction and power to do so. The legal impact of\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:149:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nthe amendment brought into effect by the Act 1 of 2019 to definition of the\n\"society\" under Act 5 of 1996 insofar as the power and jurisdiction of the\nKPSC are concerned, the matter can be interpreted in two ways. One\napproach can be that after the Act 1 of 2019, the Ranked Lists stood\ncancelled and the power of the KPSC was effaced, and second, that the\npower and jurisdiction of the KPSC in respect of the District Banks post-\namendment would apply only to fresh selection processes and would not\naffect the existing power of the KPSC in respect of Ranked Lists already and\nvalidly prepared prior to the Amendment. This interpretation will sustain\nthe power of the KPSC for the list already validly prepared. The\ninterpretation must also be viewed broadly keeping in mind the object and\nstatus of the KPSC. A narrow interpretation that would diminish the role of\nthe KPSC as an independent entity is to be avoided. When two\ninterpretations of the legal implications are possible, the one that supports\nthe continuing authority ought to be preferred.\n\n37. Further, the conduct of the Appellants and KPSC would show that\nthe second interpretation (that is maintaining the power of KPSC in respect\nof the existing list) is a valid one. The KPSC has not filed any appeal\nchallenging the judgment of the learned Single Judge which would require\nit to issue advice from the Ranked Lists post the amendment, but on the\nother hand, the KPSC has, in fact, issued advices in respect of some\ncandidates as referred to earlier. The Appellants themselves, by accepting\nthe advice issued by the KPSC from the identical Ranked Lists, which were\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:150:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nvalidly prepared, have already interpreted the legal implications in this\nmanner. The question, therefore, is whether the Appellants can now take a\ncontrary position. By accepting the advice of the KPSC for appointments to\nthe Idukki District Co-operative Bank even after the amendment, the\nAppellants have accepted the legal proposition that the KPSC has the power\nand jurisdiction to render advice so long as the select list continues to be\nvalid. Having accepted this legal implication in respect of one set of\ncandidates, the Appellants cannot now be heard to argue that a different\nlegal proposition applies to the Petitioners/Candidates. Identical ranked lists\ncannot exist and not exist at the same time. This attempt of the Appellants\nsmacks of complete arbitrariness. Therefore, when Ranked Lists were duly\nand validly prepared prior to the Act 1 of 2019, the jurisdiction of the\nKPSC did not cease upon the amendment but continues till the validity of\nthe Ranked Lists expired.\n\n38. This takes us to the judgment of the learned Single Judge disposing of\nGroup 'A' petitions. The learned Single Judge directed that the Registrar of\nCo-operative Societies shall assess the financial position of each erstwhile\nDistrict Co-operative Bank, determine the posts notionally available at that\ntime, and thereafter, issue necessary orders relating to their merger with the\nState Bank, while considering the claims of the Petitioners, similarly situated\npersons, and all others in the Ranked Lists. The Petitioners were permitted\nto file written objections within one month regarding the alleged\nunauthorised appointments and promotions made during the subsistence of\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:151:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nthe Ranked Lists, in violation of the statutory ratio. The Registrar of Co-\noperative Societies was required to examine these contentions, verify the\nlegality of such appointments, cancel those found irregular, and identify the\nvacancies to be earmarked for direct recruitment after hearing all affected\nparties. The learned Single Judge also directed that the competent officer of\nthe State Bank shall also be heard, recognising that the Bank may choose not\nto fill even available vacancies while ensuring that no irregular\nappointments had been made prior to the amalgamation. It was clarified\nthat the expiry of the Ranked Lists would not prejudice the eligible\nPetitioners with respect to the vacancies already reported pursuant to the\nearlier orders, and that if the enquiry into appointments required more time,\nthe Registrar could first determine vacancies and allow the KPSC to issue\nadvice. If any promotions or appointments during the currency of the\nRanked Lists were found illegal, corresponding advice would be issued from\nthe expired Ranked Lists within the limits of the vacancies ordered and\nreported. The entire exercise was directed to be completed within six\nmonths, with liberty to act earlier, where issues of promotion or irregular\nappointments did not arise, and the Registrar was also instructed to consider\nclaims regarding Community Quota vacancies upon receipt of written\nsubmissions from the interested Petitioners.\n\n39. Another challenge of the Appellants to these directions in the\njudgment in Group 'A' petitions is that the District Banks ceased to exist\nupon amalgamation, and the directions issued by the learned Single Judge\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:152:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nin Group 'A' are not practicable. As referred to earlier, the legal implications\nof amalgamation do not necessarily result in the complete extinction of the\namalgamated entity, but certain positions may continue depending on the\ngoverning statutory enactments. Even on facts, the contentions of the\nAppellants cannot be accepted. The Petitioners/Candidates have pointed\nout that pursuant to the impugned judgment in Group 'A' dated 12 July\n2022, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies carried out a detailed exercise\nand passed the following order dated 8 June 2023:\n\n\"xx xxxx\n\nTo comply with the order, as per reference No. 5, the Registrar\nhad given notice to the petitioners and Kerala Bank, for hearing\nthem on 2/6/2023 11 am.

V.G.Prasad and Jisha.K.C were present and the\nrepresentatives of Kerala Bank produced the written arguments.\n\nThe arguments of Kerala Bank\n\nOn 29/11/2019, the 13 district Co-operative Bank amalgamated\nin State Co-operative Bank and formed Kerala Bank. The\nMalappuram District Co-operative Bank on 12/1/2023\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:153:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\namalgamated in Kerala State Co-operative Bank also. So there is\nno standing for the District Co-operative Bank and also\nrecruitments to the said bank. Prior to the formation of Kerala\nBank, the direct recruitments except to the post of part time\nsweeper, were done as per\nSec. 80(3A)\nof the Co-operative\nSocieties Act, but when the Kerala Bank came in to existence on\n29/11/2019, the recruitment rules as per the Co-operative law\namendment became null. So the inclusion of candidate in the list\nwill not entitle him an assurance for the post, and since the State\nCo-operative Bank is a statutory body, all the appointments to it\ncome under the purview of its powers, as the Bank stated.\nMoreover, the Kerala Bank, filed appeal against the order in 26\nwrit petitions, and obtained stay order on it. They further stated\nthat, the Registrar, Co-operative Societies could not appoint any\nperson, as per\nSec.66A\nof Co-operative Societies Act, even though\nthey have such an authority to do so.\nThe cited references 1 to 4 in different petitions, the High Court\nin its order directed as such.\n\n(English)\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\nSince this being the situation, as per references 1 to 4 orders, and\non hearing the different parties in the writ petition and the Kerala\nBank, and also on perusing their petition, the data produced by\nthe Kerala Bank before the commencement of Kerala Bank, the\nfollowing are the post for clerks/cashier which was allotted to\nthem in 14 District Co-operative Banks.\n\nW.A.

No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:156:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\n\"Sir,\n\nSubject: Co-operative - Appointment from the Rank\nList of Clerk / Cashier post in old Malappuram\nDistrict, Co-operative Bank.\n\nRef: Application submitted by Sri. Akhil S. before\nthe Chief Minister of Kerala (G 2230600162)\nTurn attention to the reference candidates included\nin the Rank Lists of Clerk/Cashier of Malappuram\nDistrict Co-operative Banks have filed writ petitions\nbefore Hon'ble Kerala High Court [WP(C)\n29938/2019, WP(C) 23089/2019 & Connt. Cases] and\nin compliance with the orders/decrees in the above cases,\nRegistrar has issued order dated 08.06.2023 [No. (1)\n7321/2022]. And a contempt Case (No. 1429/23) has\nbeen filed in writ petition No. 29955/19.\nHence, steps have been taken to file appeal in all cases\nin clerk/cashier post in Co-operative Bank. Stay order\nhas been obtained in Writ Appeal No. 1291/23 which\nwas filed against the order in Writ Petition No.\n22690/19. Stay order has obtained and writ appeals are\npending before Hon'ble High Court of Kerala and hence\nthe temporary order issued by Co-operative Registrar in\nwithdrawn as per the order in the Writ Appeal filed by\nthe Bank and Government and this order in numbered\nas EM (1) 7321/2022 and this order is issued.\n\nYours Faithfully\nAdditional Registrar (Consumer)\n(On behalf of Co-operative Registrar)\"\n\n***\nThe order of 7 September 2023 was not withdrawn on the ground of\nimpracticability or on the ground that it was incorrect, but on the ground\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:157:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nthat the State Government has decided to file an appeal. We do not refer to\nthese documents to hold that the Appellants are estopped from filing the\nappeals, but they show that it is clearly possible to give effect to the\njudgment of the learned Single Judge in Group 'A' petitions, and that it was,\nin fact, sought to be implemented without recording any practical or legal\ndifficulty. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies had initially given effect\nto the direction issued by the learned Single Judge in Group 'A' petitions,\nand only thereafter, decided to file an appeal. This indicates that it is both\npossible and practicable to identify the vacancies. Therefore, the argument\nof impracticability in implementing the judgment of the learned Single\nJudge advanced by the Appellants, cannot be accepted.\n\n40. Further, it is not the case of the Appellants that the qualifications for\nthe post are different. Indeed, some of the candidates have been appointed\nafter the amalgamation in the District Banks. The Petitioners/Candidates\nassert that even the Recruitment Rules of 2023 have not brought about a\nchange in the qualifications. It is also evident from the order passed by the\nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies on 8 June 2023 that the vacancies can be\nidentified. Therefore, the selection of the Petitioners/Candidates was\nvalidly carried out by the KPSC even after the amalgamation and the\nframing of the Rules.\n\n41. It is to be noted that during the pendency of the appeals, the\nAppellants initiated the process of recruitment and preparation of select list\nunder the new Rules without obtaining leave of this Court. Though there is\nW.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases\n\n-:158:-\n\n2025:KER:94890\n\nan interim order in the appeals staying the judgment of the learned Single\nJudge, since the issue was being heard in appeals, this leave ought to have\nbeen taken. Therefore, when this was brought to the notice of the Court, a\ndirection was issued not to give effect to the new list during the pendency of\nthe appeals. Once the existence of the earlier select list and the power of the\nKPSC are recognised, no right will flow to the candidates on the new list, as\nthe list itself was made subject to the outcome of the appeals.\n\n42. Therefore, the learned Single Judge in the judgment dated 12 July\n2022 in Group 'A' petitions, issued directions to give effect to the rights of\nthe Petitioners on the Ranked Lists. The learned Single Judge has issued\nthese directions in the exercise of writ jurisdiction The Petitioners in Group\n'A' petitions have accepted these directions as they have not filed any\nappeal. Though the Appellants contend that these directions are not\npreceded by cogent reasoning, in view of the above mentioned legal and\nfactual position, we do not deem it appropriate to interfere with the ultimate\ndirections which have sought to remedy the situation considering the\npracticalities. As regards the appeals filed by the Petitioners / Candidates\nfrom Group 'B' petitions, the learned Single Judge has not considered the\nvarious legal and factual issues discussed above, and has summarily\ndismissed those petitions. The Appellants in the said appeals are, therefore,\nentitled to the directions similar to those issued in the Group 'A' petitions.\n\n43. As a result, W.A.
