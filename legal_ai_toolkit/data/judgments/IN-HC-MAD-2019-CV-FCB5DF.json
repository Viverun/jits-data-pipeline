Respondents\n\nPRAYER: Writ Petition filed under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India for\n\nissuance of writ of mandamus directing the 1st respondent to regularize the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nservice of the petitioner who is working as Gardener from 1994(NMR) with all\n\nservice benefit and grant all monetary benefits within a time stipulated by this\n\nCourt.\n\nFor Petitioner : Ms.J.Anandhavalli\nFor Respondents : Mr.D.Muruganandham\nAdditional Government Pleader\n\nORDER\n\nThe relief sought for in the present writ petition is for a direction to\n\nthe first respondent to regularize the services of the writ petitioner, who is\n\nworking as Gardener from 1994 (N.M.R.) with all service benefits and grant\n\nmonetary benefits.\n\n2. The learned counsel for the writ petitioner made a submission\n\nthat the writ petitioner was initially engaged in Nominal Muster Roll (N.M.R.)\n\nin the office of the fourth respondent from 01.05.1994. The writ petitioner was\n\nengaged as Gardener (N.M.R.) in the respondent / Department and has\n\ncompleted more than 20 years of service without any complaint. The writ\n\npetitioner filed O.A.No.5031 of 1998, before the Tamil Nadu Administrative\n\nTribunal, which was subsequently transferred to the High Court and\n\nrenumbered as W.P.No.43245 of 2006 and in the meanwhile, the Government\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nalso issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\n\nDepartment, dated 28.02.2006 and G.O.Ms.No.334, Public Works\n\nDepartment, dated 19.10.2007. Pursuant to these Government Orders, the\n\ndaily wage employees, who have rendered ten years of service as on\n\n01.01.2006 were brought under the regular establishment. Relying on the\n\nsaid Government Orders, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner states that\n\nthe case of the writ petitioner was also recommended by the competent\n\nauthorities. However, no final decision has been taken and the repeated\n\nproposals sent by the authorities competent were not even considered by the\n\nGovernment for granting the benefit of regularization to the writ petitioner.\n\nFor several years, the writ petitioner is waiting for the benefit of regularization\n\nand the said benefit has not been extended sofar. Thus, the writ petitioner is\n\nconstrained to file the present writ petition.\n\n3. This apart, this Court also passed an order in W.P.No.43241 of\n\n2006, on 26.03.2009, directing the writ petitioner to submit a fresh\n\nrepresentation to the respondents and the respondents were directed to\n\nconsider the same based on the proposals submitted for grant of\n\nregularization. In spite of the earlier orders of this Court, no final orders have\n\nbeen passed by the Government with reference to the proposals submitted by\n\nthe authority concerned for grant of regularization.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n4. The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the\n\nrespondents, with reference to the counter affidavit filed by the fifth\n\nrespondent, states that the writ petitioner was appointed as a daily wage\n\nemployee and he was a casual labourer for specific work and whenever the\n\nservice of the writ petitioner was necessary, then only he was engaged. The\n\nwrit petitioner was not appointed through Employment Exchange. Thus, the\n\nengagement of the writ petitioner as daily wage employee, was in violation of\n\nthe recruitment rules in force. The writ petitioner is not eligible for\n\nregularization in view of the fact that he was not a regular daily wage employee\n\nappointed in the sanctioned post. This apart, G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and\n\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, had already been\n\nwithdrawn. Subsequently, the Government issued another G.O.Ms.No.74,\n\nPersonnel and Administrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.06.2013,\n\nimposing certain conditions and as per the said conditions also, the writ\n\npetitioner is not entitled for the benefits of regularization and permanent\n\nabsorption.\n\n5. The fact remains that the writ petitioner was engaged as a daily\n\nwage employee. In the earlier writ petition filed by the writ petitioner, this\n\nCourt passed an order directing the respondents to consider the writ\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npetitioner's representation. However, no order has been passed by the\n\nrespondent and the writ petitioner had also not pursued his remedy\n\nthereafter. However, the learned counsel for the writ petitioner states that\n\nseveral proposals were submitted by the competent authority for considering\n\nthe case of the writ petitioner for grant of regularization.\n\n6. Regularization or permanent absorption cannot be granted in\n\nviolation of the recruitment rules in force. The persons, who were appointed\n\nby not following the recruitment rules and served as daily wage employees,\n\ncannot seek the benefit of regularization. The daily wage employees are\n\naccepting the offer of appointment on certain terms and conditions. Once they\n\nagreed the terms and conditions imposed for the daily wage engagement, then\n\nthey cannot turn around and claim the benefit of regularization in violation of\n\nthe recruitment rules in force.\n\n7. With reference to the Water Resources Organization / Public\n\nWorks Department, this Court considered the grant of regularization and\n\npermanent absorption in detail with reference to the Judgment of the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Honourable Supreme Court, in W.P.Nos.28633 to\n\n28646 of 2014, dated 12.12.2017. The relevant paragraphs are extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\"5. The third respondent has admitted the fact that the 16\ndaily wage employees in the Irrigation Division at Gobi, are working\nas daily wage employees. Under these circumstances, the\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, imposing certain\nconditions for granting regularisation of temporary/daily rated\nemployees.\n\n6. In this pretext, the writ petitioners have submitted their\nrepresentation on 9.4.2014, seeking regularisation. The fourth\nrespondent sent a reply to the writ petitioners on 11.6.2014, by\nstating that writ petitioners have been paid daily wages only\nthrough the Contractors and therefore, their case cannot be\nconsidered in accordance with G.O.Ms.No.74 dated 27.6.2013. The\nwrit petitioners have further submitted their representation on\n15.9.2014. Under these circumstances, the fourth respondent\nissued impugned order in proceedings dated 17.9.2014, rejecting\nthe claim of the writ petitioners for regularisation on the ground that\nthey were appointed on daily wage basis through the Contractors\nand therefore, their claim cannot be entertained.\n\n7. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners states that in\nthe present writ petitions, an interim order of status quo was\ngranted and that has not been complied with and the contempt\npetitions were also filed. This Court, directing the Registry to list\nthe contempt petitions also along with these writ petitions, for final\ndisposal.\n\n8. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners made a\nsubmission that it is the duty mandatory on the part of the\nrespondents to consider the case of the writ petitioners for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregularisation in the existing vacancies since the writ petitioners\nhave put in more than 10 years of their services as daily wage\nemployees and their names are registered under the Nominal\nMuster Roll maintained by the respondents. It is not the case of\nappointment of the writ petitioners but the case of their\nregularisation is the contention of the writ petitioners. When the\nemployees have completed 10 years of their services, without the\nintervention of any Court order then their services to be regularised\nas per paragraph 53 of the Constitution Bench judgment of the\nHonourable Supreme Court of India, in the case of\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1], laid down the legal\nprinciples in the matter of regularisation, permanent absorption.\n\nThe relevant Paragraph 53 of the judgment, cited supra, is\nextracted hereunder:-\n\n“53.One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases\nwhere irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as\nexplained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC\n1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\nand B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979)\n3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made\nand the employees have continued to work for ten years or more\nbut without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals.\n\nThe question of regularisation of the services of such employees\nmay have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles\nsettled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light\nof this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State\nGovernments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are\nbeing now employed. The process must be set in motion within six\nmonths from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on\nthis judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent,\nthose not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n9. The writ petitioners, though admit the fact that their\nappointment was irregular, contended that their appointments are\nnot illegal and therefore their services ought to have been\nregularised in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia.\n\n10. Further, it is contended that the right to life is a\nFundamental Right enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, time and again,\nreiterated and emphasised that the right to life cannot be\ninterpreted as a mere animal life and it is a decent life, which is to\nbe ensured. The writ petitioners are deprived of their livelihood in\nview of the denial of regularisation which amounts to deprivation of\ntheir life. At the outset, it is stated that the writ petitioners have\nworked for 10 years or more and without the intervention of orders\nof the courts or of tribunals. In other words, the State Governments\nand their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntime measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have\nworked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not\nunder cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should\nfurther ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those\nvacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where\ntemporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The\nappointments of such employee should not be illegal. Even if\nirregular, where the appointments are not made against the\nsanctioned posts. Where a person employed under the open\ncompetitive process of prescribed qualifications and was working\nagainst the sanctioned posts, he had been selected without\nundergoing the open competitive process, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.\n\n11. Mooting out the above two principles, the learned counsel\nfor the writ petitioners urged this Court by stating that in respect of\nthe irregular appointments, there is no bar for granting\nregularisation. But the learned counsel is of the opinion that the\nillegal appointments alone, cannot be regularised. As far as the\nirregular appointments are concerned, the length of service is to be\ntaken into account for the purpose of granting regularisation.\nAccordingly, the writ petitioners are entitled for regularisation in\nview of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, cited\nsupra.\n\n12. The learned Additional Government Pleader, appearing\non behalf of the respondents, submit that the writ petitioners were\nengaged as casual labourers for certain specific works under the\nprovisions of paragraph 290 of T.N.PWA Code which is in\nconnection with the execution of work. The writ petitioners have not\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeen accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ petitioners\nwere not engaged in connection with any affairs of the State\nGovernment. The Hon'ble High Court of Madras had already held\nthat PWD is not an industry to involve the Industrial Establishment\nRules. Further, it is submitted that the writ petitioners have not\nbeen appointed in sanctioned posts. The writ petitioners were\nengaged only to execute certain special and specified works on\ndaily wage basis and therefore, the benefit of regularisation, cannot\nbe granted.\n\n13. Further, it is submitted that in Government Offices, there\nare specified sanction as to the category of post, number of such\nposts, scale of pay etc., and the method of recruitment to the posts\nare defined by statutory rules such as Tamil Nadu State and\nSubordinate Service Rules and no deviation is permitted from the\nmethod of recruitment, howsoever, save the previous approval of\nthe Government.\n\n14. Paragraph 290 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Account\nCode specifies that with the following exceptions, all persons\nengaged departmentally for the execution of works are considered\nas day labourers and their wages should be drawn on Muster\nRolls, Form 21 (C.Form Nos.474 and 475) and charged to the\nestimates of the works on which they are employed:-\n\n(i) Permanent and temporary employees of the division whose\npay is charged to the head 'Establishment';\n\n(ii) Members of the works charged establishment as defined\nin paragraphs 58 to 62 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department\nCode.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n15. Thus, the above two categories only form part of the\nestablishment concerning with the PWD Office in the State and the\nrecruitment to the posts are made in accordance with the rules of\nthe different services codified in Tamil Nadu Service Manual\nVolume I to III and therefore, the writ petitioners were engaged as\ncasual labourers for the purpose of specified nature of work to\nwhich an estimate is got sanctioned as per Tamil Nadu Public\nWorks Department Code, to the extent necessary.\n\n16. Paragraph 290 of the TNPWD Code states that for the\nwork done by daily labour, the subordinate incharge of the work\nwill prepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on\nwhen practicable the work done and the amount payable.\n\n17. As the writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\nfor a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\ncasual labour virtually stopped as and when the work is completed.\nThe engagement was not made on daily wage basis or not made on\nany Service Rules. Thus, the question of regularisation of\npetitioners' NMR services do not arise.\n\n18. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the\nrespondents, further stated that paragraphs 6(i), (ii), (vi), (vii), (ix) of\nGovernment Order No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\nDepartment, dated 27.6.2013, the Government have ordered that\n\n“6(i) This order shall be deemed to have been come into force\nwith retrospective effect from 1.1.2006;\n\n6(ii) The services of the full time daily wage employees, who\nwere initially appointed on full time basis in consultation with the\nEmployment Exchange, to discharge the function of the post in the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed 10 (ten) years of service\nas on 1.1.2006 shall be regularised against regular vacancies in\nthe sanctioned cadre strength; Further, in paragraph 6(ii), it is\nstated that the service of the full time daily wage employees who\nwere initially appointed on full time basis in consultation with the\nEmployment Exchange to discharge the function of the post in the\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed ten years of service as on\n1.1.2006 shall be regularised against regular vacancies in the\nsanctioned cadre strength;\n\n6(vi) The part-time and casual employees are not entitled to\nthe concession referred to at paragraph (ii) above;\n\n6(vii) The services of the full time daily wage employees, who\nhave completed 10 years of service, after 1.1.2006, shall not be\nregularised;\n\n6(ix) Stipulates that all the proposals for regularisation of the\nservices of full time daily wages employees should be sent to the\nGovernment even in case where relaxation of rules are not\ninvolved”.\n\n19. Whereas the writ petitioners in these writ petitions have\nnot completed 10 years of service as on 1.1.2006 by daily wage\nbasis. But, the writ petitioners were not appointed in consultation\nwith the Employment Exchange as daily wagers. The Government\nOrders issued with regard to the regularisation of Contingent Staff\nto regular servants are only on completion of 10 years of\ncontinuous service as contingent servants. Thus, the question of\nregularisation of service of the writ petitioners do not arise.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n20. In this regard, this Court delivered a judgment in WP No.\n41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 regarding NMR case as follows:-\n\n“The petitioner produced a Certificate issued by one\nAssistant Engineer WRO/Public Works Department, Irrigation\nSection, Vadakkankulam to the effect that has been working as\nNMR from 1.6.1992. It is also not stated whether pursuant to any\norder, the petitioner has been working on the contrary, the\npetitioner's claim was that they should be absorbed by reglarising\nher service. It is also admitted that she was not routed through\nEmployment Exchange and the G.O.Ms.No.177, dated 4.6.1998,\ndoes not ensure to the benefit.\n\nThe Supreme Court in\nSecretary, State of Karnataka vs.\nUmadevi\n, reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1, has held that regularisation\ncannot be a method of recruitment unless the petitioner has the\ncase for absorption. As per the orders of the Government in the\nOriginal Application (later converted into the writ petition) the relief\nclaimed by the petitioner, cannot be countenanced by this Court.\nHence, the writ petition stands dismissed.”\n\n21. It is further submitted by the learned Additional\nGovernment Pleader for the respondents that the related issue was\ndealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\nNos.2726-2729 of 2014 and referred the case between State of\nKarnataka and others vs. Uma Devi and others in AIR 2006\nSC 1806, held as under:-\n\n“There is no fundamental right in those who have been\nemployed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to\nclaim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nheld by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post,\nsince, a regular appointment could be made only by making\nappointments consistent with the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other\nemployees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim\nfor equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That\nwould be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to\nclaim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never\nbeen selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules.”\n\n22. The learned Additional Government Pleader also referred\nto the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court case in\nState of\nRajasthan and others vs. V.Dayal Lal and Others\n[AIR 2011\nSC 1193] held as under:-\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution will not issue directions for regularisation,\nabsorption or permanent continuance, unless the employees\nclaiming regularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a\nregular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\ncompetitive process, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality\nclause contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously\nfollowed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularisation\nof services of an employee which would be violative of the\nconstitutional scheme. While something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the process of selection\nwhich does not go to the root of the process, can be regularised,\nback door entries, appointments contrary to the constitutional\nscheme and/or appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\nregularised.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or\ndaily-wage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the\nCourt, would not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into\nservice, as such service would be “litigious employment”. Even\ntemporary, ad hoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years,\nlet alone service for one or two years, will not entitle such employee\nto claim regularisation, if he is not working against a sanctioned\npost. Sympathy and sentiment cannot be grounds for passing any\norder of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation\nwith a cut-off date (that is a scheme providing that persons who\nhad put in a specified number of years of service and continuing in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to others who\nwere appointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or contend\nthat the scheme should be applied to them by extending the cut-off\ndate or seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation\nas they are not working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot\nbe a direction for absorption, regularisation or permanent\ncontinuance of part-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run\ninstitutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of\nthe Government on the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor\ncan employees in private employment, even if serving full time, seek\nparity in salary with government employees. The right to claim a\nparticular salary against the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBased on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, cited supra,\nCodal Rules and Government orders, the claim of the writ\npetitioners cannot be considered.\n\n23. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\nsubmitted that paragraph 290 of TNPWD Code states that “for work\ndone by daily labour the subordinate incharge of the work will\nprepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on when\npracticable the work done and the amount payable”. The writ\npetitioners were engaged as casual labour for a specified work and\nthat necessity for engagement of such casual labour virtually\nstopped as and when the work is completed. The writ petitioners\nhave not been accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ\npetitioners cannot claim any right for this casual labour work.\n\n24. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\nsubmitted that as per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\nDepartment dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, Hon'ble\nHigh Court in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.\n2726-2729 of 2014, dated 21.2.2014 judgment, cited supra, the\nclaim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered.\n\n25. The writ petitioners were not employed in connection with\nthe affairs of the State as defined in\nArticle 323-A\nof the\nConstitution of India and they were only casual labourers co-\nterminus with the purposeful completion of the work concerned as\nper the Acts and the Rules, in which such provision for the\ndeployment of casual labour is made. Thus, the writ petitioners are\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nestopped from invoking the lofty jurisdiction of this Apex Forum\noutside the ambit of the constitutional provisions.\n\n26. At the outset, the grounds relied on by the learned\nAdditional Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the\nrespondents, are enumerated as under:-\n\n(i) The engagement of casual labour and payment made by\nway of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\nChapter X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n(ii) The casual labourers thus engaged for a particular work\ncannot be regularised how so ever in any manner, without sanction\nof the post, scale of pay etc., by the Government;\n\n(iii) The writ petitioners were not employed in connection with\nthe affairs of the State as defined in\nArticle 323-A\nof the\nConstitution of India and the writ petitioners were only casual\nlabourers co-terminus with the purposeful completion of the works\nconcerned as per the Acts and the Rules in which such provisions\nfor the deployment of casual labour is made;\n\n(iv) The engagement of casual labourers and payment made\nby way of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\nChamber X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n(v) As per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\nDepartment, dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, this Court\nin W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and the Hon'ble\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSupreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.2726-2729 of\n2014 dated 21.2.2014, judgment cited supra, the claim of the writ\npetitioners cannot be considered;\n\n(vi) The Government have issued orders in G.O.Ms.No.680,\nPublic Works (C2) Department, dated 16.8.1995 for complete ban\non appointing new Nominal Muster Rolls, which is already in force.\nIn this regard, D.O.Letter No.26860/C2/2009-2 dated 15.10.2009\nreceived from the Principal Secretary to Government, PWD,\nChennai, is submitted for perusal. Thus, the Article quoted in the\napplication, cannot be correlated with the affairs of the State;\n\n(vii) The writ petitioners were not borne on any cadre strength\nof the erstwhile work charged establishment (now amended in\nTamil Nadu Engineering Subordinate Service) and the service and\nthe writ petitioners were not connected with the affairs of the State\nGovernment;\n\n(viii) The writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\nfor a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\ncasual labourers virtually stopped as and when the work was\ncompleted. In view of the above, the claim of the writ petitioners\ncannot be considered.\n\n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners as well as the learned counsel for the\nrespondents, this Court has to first consider the factual matrix\ninvolved in these writ petitions on hand. The writ petitioners,\nundoubtedly, were appointed as daily wage employees in the year\n2003 and they are continued in service for more than ten years, is\nthe claim set out in these writ petitions. However, pursuant to the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nJudgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the case of\nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n,\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as\n“Umadevi Case”], one time benefit was granted by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n28. Even before\nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil Nadu\nissued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\nDepartment, dated 28.02.2006. As per the said Government Order,\nthe temporary employees who have completed ten years of service\nas on the date of the Government Order can be regularised. Even\nprior to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, granting the benefit of\none time regularization in respect of the temporary employees who\nhave completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the\nState was extending the benefit of regularization or permanent\nabsorption to the temporary/daily rated employees who have\ncompleted ten years of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large number of\ntemporary employees were conferred with the benefit of\nregularization and based on that, the writ petitioner also raised his\nclaim for regularization. However, after the Constitution Bench\njudgment rendered in “Umadevi Case”, the State Government\nissued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department,\ndated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the\nGovernment have imposed certain conditions and those conditions\nare akin to that of the recruitment rules in force. The very idea of\nissuing G.O.Ms.No.74, is to provide certain restricted concession to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe temporary employees who were otherwise appointed by\nfollowing the recruitment rules in force. Therefore, the prospectus\nof the large number of employees who have served on daily wage\nbasis are prevented from getting their regularization. In other\nwords, the said G.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and\nrestrictions for regularization and for granting permanent\nabsorption. Thus, the persons who are eligible to be regularized\nunder G.O.Ms.No.22, are prevented from getting the benefit from\nand out of the said Government order and G.O.Ms.No.74, imposes\ncertain restrictions.\n\n30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this\nCourt that in the similar circumstances, the learned Single Judge of\nthis Court dealt with the issues in W.P.No.29346 of 2014 &\netc.,batch and delivered a judgment on 22.09.2017, setting aside\nthe said G.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending the same with\nretrospective effect. In other words, the implementation of the\nGovernment orders was restricted only prospectively and\naccordingly, the relief of regularization was granted to those writ\npetitioners.\n\n31. The learned Additional Government Pleader brought to\nthe notice of this Court that the State preferred Writ Appeals in\nW.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in W.P.29346/14, W.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in\nW.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr. No.89142/17 in W.P.No.15668/14,\nW.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in W.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17\nin W.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against\nthe said judgment\nand\nthe same is pending.\n\n32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues\nindependently and based on the judgments of the Apex Court of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nIndia in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption.\nHowever, the learned Additional Government Pleader brought to the\nnotice of this Court that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court\npassed an order in the batch of Writ Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of\n2012 and etc., batch on 10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division\nBench has considered the terms and conditions imposed in\nG.O.Ms.No.74 and passed an order stating that the services shall\nnot be disturbed in the light of the Government Order passed in\nG.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department\ndated 27.06.2013 as well as the order passed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in Civil Appeal Nos.2726-2729 of 2014 with\nNos.2730-31 of 2014.\n\n33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the opinion that\nthe terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 had already\nbeen taken note of by the Hon'ble Division Bench and the entire\nGovernment Order was upheld and the direction was issued to\npass orders in the light of the G.O.Ms.No.74 and therefore, the\njudgment delivered by the learned Single Judge, need not be relied\nupon and more so, the State also preferred writ appeals against the\nsaid orders.\n\n34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to consider the\nissues independently based on the judgments of the Apex Court of\nIndia.\n\n35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of regularization\nand permanent absorption is the judgment of the Constitution\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in “Umadevi Case”.\nAll other subsequent judgments cited by the respective counsels are\nby the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of India.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nThus, the binding nature of the judgments rendered in respect of\nother cases has to be cogently read and harmoniously interpreted\nbased on the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n36. Before considering the subject of regularization and\npermanent absorption, this Court has to consider the interpretation\nof the judgments on “binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In\nview of the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has cited\nnumber of judgments, which were passed subsequent to the\nConstitution Bench judgment, stating that Paragraph (53) of the\n“Umadevi Case” has been interpreted in different ways and under\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to be\nconsidered and a direction to be issued for regularization. In view\nof the fact that large number of judgments are cited before this\nCourt in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption,\nnow, this Court has to first decide what all are the judgments which\nall are having a “binding precedent” and on this reason, this Court\nhas to consider very interpretation of the concept regarding\n“binding precedent”.\nIn respect of judgments in relation to the\ninterpretation of “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\nconsider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the case of\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay\nSethi and Others\n, reported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is\npertinent to note that it is a judgment by the Constitution Bench of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India headed by His Lordship,\nHon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief\nJustice of India delivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote\nparagraphs (15 to 26):\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“15. The aforesaid analysis in Santosh Devi (supra) may prima\nfacie show that the two-Judge Bench has distinguished the\nobservation made in Sarla Verma’s case but on a studied scrutiny,\nit becomes clear that it has really expressed a different view than\nwhat has been laid down in Sarla Verma (supra). If we permit\nourselves to say so, the different view has been expressed in a\ndistinctive tone, for the two-Judge Bench had stated that it was\nextremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the observations\nmade in para 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma’s case in respect\nof self-employed or a person on fixed salary without provision for\nannual increment, etc. This is a clear disagreement with the earlier\nview, and we have no hesitation in saying that it is absolutely\nimpermissible keeping in view the concept of binding precedents.\n\n16. Presently, we may refer to certain decisions which deal\nwith the concept of binding precedent.\n\n17.\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias Kalika Singh\nand others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it has been held:-\n\n“10. … an earlier decision may seem to be incorrect to a\nBench of a coordinate jurisdiction considering the question later, on\nthe ground that a possible aspect of the matter was not considered\nor not raised before the court or more aspects should have been\ngone into by the court deciding the matter earlier but it would not be\na reason to say that the decision was rendered per incuriam and\nliable to be ignored. The earlier judgment may seem to be not\ncorrect yet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench of\ncoordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n17.1.The Court has further ruled:-“10. … Easy course of\nsaying that earlier decision was rendered per incuriam is not\npermissible and the matter will have to be resolved only in two\nways — either to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter to a\nlarger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt that earlier\ndecision is not correct on merits.”\n\n18. In G.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and others (2014)\n13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted the said principle on the basis\nof judgments of this Court rendered in Union of India v. Godfrey\nPhilips India Ltd. (1985) 4 SCC 369), Sundarjas Kanyalal\nBhatija v. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra (1989) 3 SCC\n\n396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar v. Ratilal\nMotilal Patel\n(AIR 1968 SC 372).\n\nIt may be noted here that the\nConstitution Bench in\nMadras Bar Association v. Union of India\nand another\n[JT 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the prior\nConstitution Bench judgment in\nUnion of India v. Madras Bar\nAssociation [JT\n2010 (5) SC 553]is a binding precedent. Be it\nclarified, the issues that were put to rest in the earlier Constitution\nBench judgment were treated as precedents by latter Constitution\nBench.\n\n19.\nIn this regard, we may refer to a passage from\nJaisri\nSahu v. Rajdewan Dubey\n(AIR 1962 SC 83):-\n\n“11. Law will be bereft of all its utility if it should be thrown\ninto a state of uncertainty by reason of conflicting decisions, and it\nis therefore desirable that in case of difference of opinion, the\nquestion should be authoritatively settled. It sometimes happens\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthat an earlier decision given by a Bench is not brought to the notice\nof a Bench hearing the same question, and a contrary decision is\ngiven without reference to the earlier decision. The question has\nalso been discussed as to the correct procedure to be followed\nwhen two such conflicting decisions are placed before a later\nBench. The practice in the Patna High Court appears to be that in\nthose cases, the earlier decision is followed and not the later. In\nEngland the practice is, as noticed in the judgment in Seshamma v.\nVenkata Narasimharao that the decision of a court of appeal is\nconsidered as a general rule to be binding on it. There are\nexceptions to it, and one of them is thus stated in Halsbury’s Laws\nof England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 22, para 1687, pp. 799-800:\n\n“The court is not bound to follow a decision of its own if given\nper incuriam. A decision is given per incuriam when the court has\nacted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a Court of\na co-ordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it, or when\nit has acted in ignorance of a decision of the House of Lords. In the\nformer case it must decide which decision to follow, and in the latter\nit is bound by the decision of the House of Lords.”In Virayya v.\nVenkata Subbayya it has been held by the Andhra High Court\nthat under the circumstances aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt\nthat view which is in accordance with justice and legal principles\nafter taking into consideration the views expressed in the two\nconflicting Benches, vide also the decision of the Nagpur High Court\nin Bilimoria v. Central Bank of India. The better course would be for\nthe Bench hearing the case to refer the matter to a Full Bench in\nview of the conflicting authorities without taking upon itself to\ndecide whether it should follow the one Bench decision or the other.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nWe have no doubt that when such situations arise, the Bench\nhearing cases would refer the matter for the decision of a Full\nCourt.”\n\n20. Though the aforesaid was articulated in the context of\nthe High Court, yet this Court has been following the same as is\nrevealed from the aforestated pronouncements including that of the\nConstitution Bench and, therefore, we entirely agree with the said\nview because it is the precise warrant of respecting a precedent\nwhich is the fundamental norm of judicial discipline.\n\n21.\nIn the context, we may fruitfully note what has been\nstated in\nPradip Chandra Parija and others v. Pramod\nChandra Patnaik and others\n[JT (2002) 5 SCC 23]. In the said\ncase, the Constitution Bench was dealing with a situation where the\ntwo-Judge Bench disagreeing with the three-Judge Bench decision\ndirected the matter to be placed before a larger Bench of five\nJudges of this Court. In that scenario, the Constitution Bench\nstated:-“6. … In our view, judicial discipline and propriety demands\nthat a Bench of two learned Judges should follow a decision of a\nBench of three learned Judges. But if a Bench of two learned\nJudges concludes that an earlier judgment of three learned Judges\nis so very incorrect that in no circumstances can it be followed, the\nproper course for it to adopt is to refer the matter before it to a\nBench of three learned Judges setting out, as has been done here,\nthe reasons why it could not agree with the earlier judgment. …\n\n22.\nIn\nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and\nanother\n[JT (2002) (3) SC 493], another Constitution Bench\ndealing with the concept of precedents stated thus:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“22. … The doctrine of binding precedent is of utmost\nimportance in the administration of our judicial system. It promotes\ncertainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial consistency\npromotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is this need for\nconsistency in the enunciation of legal principles in the decisions of\nthis Court. It is in the above context, this Court in the case of\nRaghubir Singh (1989) 2 SCC 754)held that a pronouncement of\nlaw by a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a Division Bench\nof the same or smaller number of Judges. …\n\n23. Be it noted, Chandra Prakash concurred with the view\nexpressed in Raghubir Singh and Pradip Chandra Parija.\n\n24.\nIn\nSandhya Educational Society and another v.\nUnion of India and others\n(2014) 7 SCC 701), it has been\nobserved that judicial decorum and discipline is paramount and,\ntherefore, a coordinate Bench has to respect the judgments and\norders passed by another coordinate Bench.\n\nIn\nRattiram and\nothers v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n(2012) 4 SCC 516), the\nCourt dwelt upon the issue what would be the consequent effect of\nthe latter decision which had been rendered without noticing the\nearlier decisions.\nThe Court noted the observations in Raghubir\nSingh (supra) and reproduced a passage from Indian Oil\nCorporation Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation (1995) 4 SCC\n\n96)which is to the following effect:-“8. … The Division Bench of the\nHigh Court in\nMunicipal Corpn., Indore v. Ratnaprabha Dhanda\n\nwas clearly in error in taking the view that the decision of this Court\nin Ratnaprabha was not binding on it. In doing so, the Division\nBench of the High Court did something which even a later coequal\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBench of this Court did not and could not do. …\n\n25. It also stated what has been expressed in Raghubir\nSingh (supra) by R.S. Pathak, C.J. It is as follows:-“28. We are of\nopinion that a pronouncement of law by a Division Bench of this\nCourt is binding on a Division Bench of the same or a smaller\nnumber of Judges, and in order that such decision be binding, it is\nnot necessary that it should be a decision rendered by the Full\nCourt or a Constitution Bench of the Court. …”\n\n26. In Rajesh (supra) the three-Judge Bench had delivered\nthe judgment on 12.04.2013. The purpose of stating the date is that\nit has been delivered after the pronouncement made in Reshma\nKumari’s case. On a perusal of the decision in Rajesh (supra), we\nfind that an attempt has been made to explain what the two- Judge\nBench had stated in Santosh Devi (supra). The relevant passages\nread as follows:-\n\n“8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually intended\nto follow the principle in the case of salaried persons as laid down\nin Sarla Verma case and to make it applicable also to the self-\nemployed and persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the\nincrease in the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will also\nhave a reference to the age. In other words, in the case of self-\nemployed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim\nwas below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual\nincome of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless\nto say that the actual income should be income after paying the tax,\nif any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased was in the age\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ngroup of 40 to 50 years.9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated\nthat in the case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition.\nHaving regard to the fact that in the case of those self-employed or\non fixed wages, where there is normally no age of superannuation,\nwe are of the view that it will only be just and equitable to provide\nan addition of 15% in the case where the victim is between the age\ngroup of 50 to 60 years so as to make the compensation just,\nequitable, fair and reasonable. There shall normally be no addition\nthereafter.”\n\n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, while dealing with the cases of accident claims, has\nelaborately discussed about the “binding precedent”. The case in\nrelation to the Motor Accident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma”\nwas being followed by all the Courts across the Country for the\npurpose of awarding compensation. When the question arosed that\nthe “binding nature” of the said case of “Sarla Verma” delivered\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\nheaded by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that the principles\nlaid down in the case of\n“Virayya v. Venkata Subbayya”\n, it has\nbeen held by the Andhra Pradesh High Court that under the\ncircumstances aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that view which\nis in accordance with justice and legal principles after taking into\nconsideration the views expressed in the two conflicting Benches, it\nis further held that in the case of\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n\nalias Kalika Singh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be not correct yet\nit will have the binding effect on the later Bench of coordinate\njurisdiction.\n\nTheir Lordships rendered the case of Chandra\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nPrakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n, reported in\n[JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding precedent\nis of utmost importance in the administration of our judicial system.\n\nIt promotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\nconsistency promotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is\nthis need for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in the\ndecisions of this Court.\n\n38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard, the\nApex Court of India held that the judgment by the Larger Bench of\nthe Courts are to be treated as “binding precedent”, while deciding\nthe legal principles involved in the particular case.\n\n39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the case of Padma Sundara Rao and Others Vs.\nState of Tamil Nadu and others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC\n533, and the relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without\ndiscussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact\nsituation of the decision on which reliance is placed. There is\nalways peril in treating the words of a speech or judgment as\nthough they are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be\nremembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the\nfacts of a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v. British\nRailways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom\nBritish Railways Board v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] .\nCircumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact may make\na world of difference between conclusions in two cases.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n40. In view of the legal principle settled in the matter of\n“binding precedent”, now, this Court is bound by the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there is no\nother subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in respect of the\nsubject of regularization and permanent absorption. The last\njudgment rendered by the Constitution Bench in the subject matter\nis “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of “binding precedent”\nor to be followed as “binding precedent”. Thus, the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition has to be considered only\nin the light of the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench.\nAll other judgments subsequently passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India may have certain distinctions far and against.\nHowever, these judgments are to be interpreted only based on the\nfacts and circumstances prevailing in that particular case and\ntherefore, this Court cannot consider those judgments delivered on\na particular facts in relation to that particular case. However, the\nlegal principles are to be considered in relation to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by the\nConstitution Bench in the matter of regularization and permanent\nabsorption. Paragraph (5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions which could\nnot be said to be consistent with the constitutional scheme of public\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The question\narises, equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the court with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions\nof this country seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity\nfor competing for employment? When one side of the coin is\nconsidered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered and\nthe way open to any court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law\nas laid down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which\nat times, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\ncertainly tend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is\nthis conflict that is reflected in these cases referred to the\nConstitution Bench”\n\n42. This Court wants to look into the very findings made by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above said paragraph (5),\nthe Apex Court has conceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia had also on occasions, issued directions, which could not be\nsaid to be consistent with the Constitutional schemes of public\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis\nof equitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that equity to\nwhom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the\nCourt with the claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this\nCountry seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\ncompeting for employment? When one side of the coin is\nconsidered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered and\nthe way open to any Court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law\nas laid down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which\nat times, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncertainly tend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is\nthis Conflict that reflected in these cases referred to the Constitution\nBench.\n\n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern recorded\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The concern raised by the\nConstitution Bench is that by granting relief to a handful of people,\nthe large sector of meritorious youth of this great nation cannot be\ndeprived of their constitutional rights. Under this pretext, the\nConstitution Bench commenced its consideration in “Umadevi\nCase”. Thus, the very enumeration in the above paragraph is\ncrystal clear that the Constitution Bench has laid down the principle\nin the matter of regularization and permanent absorption and the\nidea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to stop the practice\nof appointing employees, through back door on extraneous\nconsideration by showing favoritism and nepotism.\n\n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi Case” is\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“10. When these matters came up before a Bench of two\nJudges, the learned Judges referred the cases to a Bench of three\nJudges. The order of reference is reported in\nSecy., State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(1) [(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 935\n: (2003) 9 Scale 187] . This Court noticed that in the matter of\nregularisation of ad hoc employees, there were conflicting decisions\nby three-Judge Benches of this Court and by two-Judge Benches\nand hence the question required to be considered by a larger\nBench. When the matters came up before a three-Judge Bench, the\nBench in turn felt that the matter required consideration by a\nConstitution Bench in view of the conflict and in the light of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\narguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General.\n\nThe order of\nreference is reported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(2)\n[(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale 388] . It appears to be proper to\nquote that order of reference at this stage. It reads: (SCC p. 45,\nparas 1-5)\n\n“1.\n\nApart from the conflicting opinions between the three-Judge\nBench decisions in\nAshwani Kumar v. State of Bihar\n[(1997) 2 SCC\n1 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 465 : 1996 Supp (10) SCR 120] , State of\nHaryana v. Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 :\n\n(1992) 21 ATC 403 : (1992) 3 SCR 826] and Dharwad Distt. PWD\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka [(1990)\n2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1\nSCR 544] on the one hand and State of H.P. v. Suresh Kumar\nVerma [(1996) 7 SCC 562 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 645 : (1996) 33 ATC\n336 : AIR 1996 SC 1565 : (1996) 1 SCR 972] , State of Punjab v.\n\nSurinder Kumar [(1992) 1 SCC 489 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 345 : (1992)\n19 ATC 500 : AIR 1992 SC 1593 : 1991 Supp (3) SCR 553] and\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980\nSCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] on the other, which have been\nbrought out in one of the judgments under appeal of the Karnataka\nHigh Court in\nState of Karnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao\n[(2001) 4 Kant\nLJ 466 (DB)] , decided on 1-6-2001 the learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral urged that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\n\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore,\nthese cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\nJudges (Constitution Bench).\n\n2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned Senior Counsel,\nappearing for the employees urged that such a scheme for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregularisation is consistent with the provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in CCs Nos.\n109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated 19-7-2002 and submitted\nthat the orders have already been implemented.\n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion between the\nthree-Judge Bench decisions of this Court, we are of the view that\nthese cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\nJudges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice\nfor appropriate orders.”\n\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here. We have to\nlay down the law. We have to approach the question as a\nconstitutional court should.”\n\n45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that there were\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by\ntwo-Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and\ntherefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\nthe question required to be considered by a larger Bench. It is\nfurther observed that when the matters came up before a three-\nJudge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\nconsideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in\nthe light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General.\nIn the reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench itself\ndecided that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\nArticles\n16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore, these\ncases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nJudges(Constitution Bench).\n\n46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi Case”, it is stated\nthat in addition to the equality clause represented by\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution,\nArticle 16\nhas specifically provided for equality of\nopportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these\nfundamental rights,\nArticle 309\nprovides that subject to the\nprovisions of the Constitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate\nthe recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to\npublic services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union\nor of a State.\n\n47. In view of the interpretation placed on\nArticle 12\nof the\nConstitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also govern\nthe instrumentalities that come within the purview of\nArticle 12\nof\nthe Constitution. With a view to make the procedure for selection\nfair, the Constitution by\nArticle 315\nhas also created a Public\nService Commission for the Union and the Public Service\nCommissions for the States.\nArticle 320\ndeals with the functions of\nthe Public Service Commissions and mandates consultation with the\nCommission on all matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil\nservices and for civil posts and other related matters. As a part of\nthe affirmative action recognised by\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution,\n\nArticle 335\nprovides for special consideration in the matter of claims\nof the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for\nemployment.\n\n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi Case” reads as\nfollows:\n\n“12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions when the\nsovereign State or its instrumentalities will have to employ persons,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin posts which are temporary, on daily wages, as additional hands\nor taking them in without following the required procedure, to\ndischarge the duties in respect of the posts that are sanctioned and\nthat are required to be filled in terms of the relevant procedure\nestablished by the Constitution or for work in temporary posts or\nprojects that are not needed permanently. This right of the Union or\nof the State Government cannot but be recognised and there is\nnothing in the Constitution which prohibits such engaging of\npersons temporarily or on daily wages, to meet the needs of the\nsituation. But the fact that such engagements are resorted to,\ncannot be used to defeat the very scheme of public employment.\nNor can a court say that the Union or the State Governments do not\nhave the right to engage persons in various capacities for a duration\nor until the work in a particular project is completed. Once this right\nof the Government is recognised and the mandate of the\nconstitutional requirement for public employment is respected, there\ncannot be much difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\nordinarily not proper for the Courts whether acting under\nArticle\nof the Constitution or under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to\ndirect absorption in permanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged\nby the constitutional scheme.”\n\n49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment is that the temporary engagements like daily wage\nappointments, consolidated pay appointments and temporary\nappointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to\ndefeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a Court say\nthat the Union or the State Governments do not have the right to\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nengage persons in various capacities for a duration or until the\nwork in a particular project is completed. Once this right of the\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of the constitutional\nrequirement for public employment is respected, there cannot be\nmuch difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is ordinarily not\nproper for the Courts, whether acting under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution or under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct\nabsorption in permanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged\nby the constitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the\nConstitutional Bench that regular recruitment rules in force,\nfollowed scrupulously by the competent authorities and\nengagements on temporary basis cannot be resorted or the same\ncannot lead to permanent absorption or regularization. Further, it is\nstated that the Government is entitled to appoint the persons on\ndaily wages/consolidated pay/temporary basis, if a Government is\nof the opinion that a project has to be implemented or a special\nworks to be carried out, then they are at liberty to do so, by\nengaging the temporary employees. Such being the concept\naccepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a mere\nappointment on temporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a\nright for the employees to claim regularization or permanent\nabsorption.\n\n50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13. What is sought to be pitted against this approach, is the so-\ncalled equity arising out of giving of temporary employment or\nengagement on daily wages and the continuance of such persons in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe engaged work for a certain length of time. Such considerations\ncan have only a limited role to play, when every qualified citizen\nhas a right to apply for appointment, the adoption of the concept of\nrule of law and the scheme of the Constitution for appointment to\nposts. It cannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the courts\nto ignore, encourage or approve appointments made or\nengagements given outside the constitutional scheme. In effect,\norders based on such sentiments or approach would result in\nperpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the scheme of\npublic employment adopted by us while adopting the Constitution.\nThe approving of such acts also results in depriving many of their\nopportunity to compete for public employment. We have, therefore,\nto consider the question objectively and based on the constitutional\nand statutory provisions.\nIn this context, we have also to bear in\nmind the exposition of law by a Constitution Bench in\nState of\nPunjab v. Jagdip Singh\n[(1964) 4 SCR 964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] . It\nwas held therein: (SCR pp. 971-72)\n“In our opinion where a government servant has no right to a post\nor to a particular status, though an authority under the Government\nacting beyond its competence had purported to give that person a\nstatus which it was not entitled to give he will not in law be deemed\nto have been validly appointed to the post or given the particular\nstatus.”\n\n51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement made by\nthe Constitution Bench in respect of providing equal opportunity\nand in respect of implementing the equality clause enshrined under\n\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nof the Constitution. In the above said paragraph\n(13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has emphasized that it\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the Courts to ignore,\nencourage or approve appointments made or engagements given\noutside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on such\nsentiments or approach would result in perpetuating illegalities and\nin the jettisoning of the scheme of public employment adopted by\nus, while adopting the Constitution. We, the people of India, while\nadopting the Constitution.\n\n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving\nmany of their opportunity to compete for public employment. The\nConstitution Bench of “Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition\nof law\nlaid down by\nthe previous Constitution Bench in the case of\n\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported in [AIR (1964) SC\n521].\n\nThe earlier Constitution Bench in the case of\nState of\nPunjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant\nhas no right to a post or to a particular status, though an authority\nunder the Government acting beyond its competence had purported\nto give that person a status which it was not entitled to give he will\nnot in law be deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\ngiven the particular status.\n\n53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has elaborately discussed about\nvarious orders of the Courts either interim orders or final orders\nwhich were brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion that those\norders more or less was the issue of directions for continuation or\nabsorption without referring to the legal position obtaining. It was\nbrought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been created by\nsuch orders without reference to the legal principles and it is time\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthat this Court settled the law once and for all so that in case the\nCourt finds that such orders should not be made, the Courts,\nespecially, the High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\ndirections or passing such orders.\n\n54. The very arguments advanced by the learned counsel for\nthe State of Karnataka is that a chaos was created on account of\nvarious contradicting orders passed by the High Courts in the\nmatter of regularization or permanent absorption in order to settle\nthe legal principles. The learned counsel urged the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India to take note of the fact that there is a chaos\nprevailing in respect of the regularization and permanent absorption\nof the temporary/daily wages employees and brought to the notice\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High Courts would\nbe precluded from issuing any such directions or passing such\norders in contrary to the legal principles in the matters of\nregularization or permanent absorption or appointment. The\nobservation made in this regard is that bypassing of the\nConstitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by the passing of\norders without dealing with and deciding the validity of such orders\non the touchstone of Constitutionality.\n\n55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“20. The decision in Dharwad Distt.\nPWD Literate Daily Wage\nEmployees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990\nSCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with\na scheme framed by the State of Karnataka, though at the instance\nof the Court. The scheme was essentially relating to the application\nof the concept of equal pay for equal work but it also provided for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmaking permanent, or what it called regularisation, without keeping\nthe distinction in mind, of employees who had been appointed ad\nhoc, casually, temporarily or on daily-wage basis. In other words,\nemployees who had been appointed without following the\nprocedure established by law for such appointments. This Court, at\nthe threshold, stated that it should individualise justice to suit a\ngiven situation. With respect, it is not possible to accept the\nstatement, unqualified as it appears to be. This Court is not only the\nconstitutional court, it is also the highest court in the country, the\nfinal court of appeal. By virtue of\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution,\nwhat this Court lays down is the law of the land. Its decisions are\nbinding on all the courts. Its main role is to interpret the\nconstitutional and other statutory provisions bearing in mind the\nfundamental philosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\nourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The role of the\nSupreme Court is to render justice according to law. As one jurist\nput it, the Supreme Court is expected to decide questions of law for\nthe country and not to decide individual cases without reference to\nsuch principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not\nconsistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to send out\nconfusing signals and usher in judicial chaos. Its role, therefore, is\nreally to interpret the law and decide cases coming before it,\naccording to law.\nOrders which are inconsistent with the legal\nconclusions arrived at by the court in the selfsame judgment not\nonly create confusion but also tend to usher in arbitrariness\nhighlighting the statement, that equity tends to vary with the\nChancellor's foot.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt.\nPWD\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. Vs. State of\nKarnataka\n, reported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was considered in\nthe above paragraph. It is observed that the role of the Court to\ninterpret the law and decide cases coming before it, according to\nlaw. Orders which are inconsistent with the legal conclusions\narrived at by the Court in the self same judgment not only create\nconfusion but also tend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the\nstatement, that equity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\n\n57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nhas accepted the decision, the question of law for the country and\nnot to decide individual cases without reference to such principles\nof law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with\nits own decisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals\nand result in judicial chaos. The observation made in this regard\nare certainly to be followed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n58.\nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex Court\nreferred the spirit of\nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n,\nreported in (1973) 4 SCC 225, the Court held that\nArticle 14\n\n&\nwhich was described as a facet of\nArticle 14\nis part of the basic\nstructure of the Constitution.\n\nIn the case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs.\nUnion of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168\n,\nthe said decision\n\nwas reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\ntransgress the basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the\nprinciple of equality enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof which\nArticle 16(1)\nis\na facet.\n\n59.\nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the above said\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n1 SCC 168, it is held that equality and equal opportunity is a basis\nfeature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant position of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution in the scheme of things.\n\n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in the\ncase of\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n(1987) 1 SCC 378 and the relevant paragraph (3) is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our Constitution and\nit is the essence of the rule of law that the exercise of the power by\nthe State whether it be the legislature or the executive or any other\nauthority should be within the constitutional limitations and if any\npractice is adopted by the executive which is in flagrant and\nsystematic violation of its constitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a\nmember of the public would have sufficient interest to challenge\nsuch practice by filing a writ petition and it would be the\nconstitutional duty of this Court to entertain the writ petition and\nadjudicate upon the validity of such practice”\n\n61. Let us now look into the way in which the Constitution\nBench has arrived the conclusion in the matter of regularization and\npermanent absorption in “Umadevi Case” and the relevant\nparagraphs (43) to (50), which all are extracted hereunder:\n\n“43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in\npublic employment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since\nthe rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court would\ncertainly be disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of\n\nArticle 14\nor in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with\nthe requirements of\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily\nto hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules\nand after a proper competition among qualified persons, the same\nwould not confer any right on the appointee. If it is a contractual\nappointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end of the\ncontract, if it were an engagement or appointment on daily wages or\ncasual basis, the same would come to an end when it is\ndiscontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be\nmade permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has\nalso to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a\ncasual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\nappointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular\nservice or made permanent, merely on the strength of such\ncontinuance, if the original appointment was not made by following\na due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is\nnot open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the instance\nof temporary employees whose period of employment has come to\nan end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their\nappointment, do not acquire any right. The High Courts acting\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue\ndirections for absorption, regularisation, or permanent continuance\nunless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of the\nconstitutional scheme. Merely because an employee had continued\nunder cover of an order of the court, which we have described as\n“litigious employment” in the earlier part of the judgment, he would\nnot be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in\nthe service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be\njustified in issuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe employee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it may be\npossible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately\nno prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an interim direction to\ncontinue his employment would hold up the regular procedure for\nselection or impose on the State the burden of paying an employee\nwho is really not required. The courts must be careful in ensuring\nthat they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of\nits affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves\nthe instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and\nstatutory mandates.\n\n44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work” is different\nfrom the concept of conferring permanency on those who have been\nappointed on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in\nvarious decisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal work\nand has laid down the parameters for the application of that\nprinciple. The decisions are rested on the concept of equality\nenshrined in our Constitution in the light of the directive principles\nin that behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a\nposition where the court could direct that appointments made\nwithout following the due procedure established by law, be deemed\npermanent or issue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so,\nwould be negation of the principle of equality of opportunity. The\npower to make an order as is necessary for doing complete justice\nin any cause or matter pending before this Court, would not\nnormally be used for giving the go-by to the procedure established\nby law in the matter of public employment. Take the situation\narising in the cases before us from the State of Karnataka. Therein,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nafter Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n(1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the Government had issued\nrepeated directions and mandatory orders that no temporary or ad\nhoc employment or engagement be given. Some of the authorities\nand departments had ignored those directions or defied those\ndirections and had continued to give employment, specifically\ninterdicted by the orders issued by the executive. Some of the\nappointing officers have even been punished for their defiance. It\nwould not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise of\njurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the Constitution or in exercise\nof power under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution permitting those\npersons engaged, to be absorbed or to be made permanent, based\non their appointments or engagements. Complete justice would be\njustice according to law and though it would be open to this Court to\nmould the relief, this Court would not grant a relief which would\namount to perpetuating an illegality.\n\n45. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual,\nbe regularised or made permanent, the courts are swayed by the\nfact that the person concerned has worked for some time and in\nsome cases for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the\nperson who accepts an engagement either temporary or casual in\nnature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He accepts\nthe employment with open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a\nposition to bargain—not at arm's length—since he might have been\nsearching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and\naccepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be\nappropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and\nto take the view that a person who has temporarily or casually got\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployed should be directed to be continued permanently. By\ndoing so, it will be creating another mode of public appointment\nwhich is not permissible. If the court were to void a contractual\nemployment of this nature on the ground that the parties were not\nhaving equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the court\nto grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo on such casual\nor temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies of\nadministration and if imposed, would only mean that some people\nwho at least get employment temporarily, contractually or casually,\nwould not be getting even that employment when securing of such\nemployment brings at least some succour to them. After all,\ninnumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of\nemployment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or\ntemporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\nemployment. It is in that context that one has to proceed on the\nbasis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature\nof it and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\nwhile accepting the employment, the person concerned knows the\nnature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the\nreal sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\nwhich he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot\nbe considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up\nof the procedure established, for making regular appointments to\navailable posts in the services of the State. The argument that since\none has been working for some time in the post, it will not be just to\ndiscontinue him, even though he was aware of the nature of the\nemployment when he first took it up, is not one that would enable\nthe jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone\nof constitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined in\nArticle\nof the Constitution.\n\n46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents\nargued that on the basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation,\nthe employees, especially of the Commercial Taxes Department,\nshould be directed to be regularised since the decisions in Dharwad\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 :\n\n(1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC\n(L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob\nM. Puthuparambil v. Kerala Water Authority\n, (1991) 1 SCC 28 :\n\n1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural\nUniversity [Gujarat Agricultural University v. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n,\n(2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 613] and the like, have given\nrise to an expectation in them that their services would also be\nregularised. The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\nadministrative authority affect the person by depriving him of some\nbenefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been\npermitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\nlegitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there have\nbeen communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it\non which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he\nhas received assurance from the decision-maker that they will not\nbe withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing\nreasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn.\n\n[See\nLord Diplock in Council for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil\nService [1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3 WLR 1174\n(HL)] , National Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S. Raghunathan\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n[(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.)\nv. State of Rajasthan [(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .]\n\nThere is no case that any assurance was given by the Government\nor the department concerned while making the appointment on\ndaily wages that the status conferred on him will not be withdrawn\nuntil some rational reason comes into existence for withdrawing it.\n\nThe very engagement was against the constitutional scheme.\nThough, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes Department\nsought to get the appointments made permanent, there is no case\nthat at the time of appointment any promise was held out. No such\npromise could also have been held out in view of the circulars and\ndirectives issued by the Government after Dharwad decision\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 :\n\n(1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though, there is a case that the State had\nmade regularisations in the past of similarly situated employees,\nthe fact remains that such regularisations were done only pursuant\nto judicial directions, either of the Administrative Tribunal or of the\nHigh Court and in some cases by this Court. Moreover, the\ninvocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable\nthe employees to claim that they must be made permanent or they\nmust be regularised in the service though they had not been\nselected in terms of the rules for appointment. The fact that in\ncertain cases the court had directed regularisation of the employees\ninvolved in those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim\nbased on legitimate expectation. The argument if accepted would\nalso run counter to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that\nbehalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets\nengagement as a contractual or casual worker and the engagement\nis not based on a proper selection as recognised by the relevant\nrules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such\na person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for\nbeing confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could\nbe made only by following a proper procedure for selection and in\ncases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service\nCommission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot\nbe successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual\nemployees. It cannot also be held that the State has held out any\npromise while engaging these persons either to continue them\nwhere they are or to make them permanent. The State cannot\nconstitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the\ntheory cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being made\npermanent in the post.\n\n48. It was then contended that the rights of the employees\nthus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are\nviolated. It is stated that the State has treated the employees\nunfairly by employing them on less than minimum wages and\nextracting work from them for a pretty long period in comparison\nwith those directly recruited who are getting more wages or salaries\nfor doing similar work. The employees before us were engaged on\ndaily wages in the department concerned on a wage that was made\nknown to them. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was\nnot being paid. Those who are working on daily wages formed a\nclass by themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nas against those who have been regularly recruited on the basis of\nthe relevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on\ndaily wages to claim that such employee should be treated on a par\nwith a regularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in\nemployment, even assuming that the principle could be invoked for\nclaiming equal wages for equal work. There is no fundamental right\nin those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or\non contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed\nin service. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to\nbe holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made\nonly by making appointments consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The right to be treated\nequally with the other employees employed on daily wages, cannot\nbe extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were\nregularly employed. That would be treating unequals as equals. It\ncannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service\neven though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant\nrecruitment rules. The arguments based on\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution are therefore overruled.\n\n49. It is contended that the State action in not regularising\nthe employees was not fair within the framework of the rule of law.\nThe rule of law compels the State to make appointments as\nenvisaged by the Constitution and in the manner we have indicated\nearlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees had\nworked for some length of time but this has also been brought\nabout by the pendency of proceedings in tribunals and courts\ninitiated at the instance of the employees. Moreover, accepting an\nargument of this nature would mean that the State would be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermitted to perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public\nemployment and that would be a negation of the constitutional\nscheme adopted by us, the people of India. It is therefore not\npossible to accept the argument that there must be a direction to\nmake permanent all the persons employed on daily wages. When\nthe court is approached for relief by way of a writ, the court has\nnecessarily to ask itself whether the person before it had any legal\nright to be enforced. Considered in the light of the very clear\nconstitutional scheme, it cannot be said that the employees have\nbeen able to establish a legal right to be made permanent even\nthough they have never been appointed in terms of the relevant\nrules or in adherence of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n50. It is argued that in a country like India where there is so\nmuch poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of\nbargaining power, the action of the State in not making the\nemployees permanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. But the very argument indicates that there are so\nmany waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context that the\nConstitution as one of its basic features, has included\nArticles 14\n,\nand\nso as to ensure that public employment is given only in\na fair and equitable manner by giving all those who are qualified,\nan opportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding rights\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a set of persons cannot be\npreferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\nto compete for State employment. The acceptance of the argument\non behalf of the respondents would really negate the rights of the\nothers conferred by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, assuming that we\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nare in a position to hold that the right to employment is also a right\ncoming within the purview of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. The\nargument that\nArticle 23\nof the Constitution is breached because the\nemployment on daily wages amounts to forced labour, cannot be\naccepted. After all, the employees accepted the employment at their\nown volition and with eyes open as to the nature of their\nemployment. The Governments also revised the minimum wages\npayable from time to time in the light of all relevant circumstances.\nIt also appears to us that importing of these theories to defeat the\nbasic requirement of public employment would defeat the\nconstitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of equality.”\n\n62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to the rule of\nequality in public employment is a basic feature of our Constitution\nwhen it is clarified that adherence to the rule of equality in public\nemployment is a basic feature of the Constitution, certainly, no\nperson can deviate the principles in this regard and therefore,\nappointment in accordance with the recruitment rules in force by the\ncompetent authorities is the constitutional mandate and any\ndeviation to be construed as violation of the constitutional\nprinciples. It is observed that if it is a contractual appointment, the\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\nsame would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly\ntemporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the\nexpiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\nmerely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is\ncontinued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would\nnot be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappointment, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the\noriginal appointment was not made by following a due process of\nselection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at\nthe instance of temporary employees whose period of employment\nhas come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature\nof their appointment do not acquire any right. The High Courts\nacting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, should not ordinarily\nissue directions for absorption, regularization, or permanent\ncontinuance unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in\nterms of constitutional scheme.\n\n64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition on hand. In the present\nwrit petition, the writ petitioners were appointed on daily wage\nbasis as Nominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere continuance or\nthe length of service rendered alone cannot be a ground for\ngranting the relief of regularization. Thus, the very legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition. Further, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India deals with the “litigious employment”. Of\ncourse, the situation does not arise in the present case. The interim\norder of Status Quo granted by this Court has not been properly\nimplemented by reinstating the petitioners in service and the\nContempt petition filed by the writ petitioners were also posted\nalong with the writ petition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of\n“litigious employment” would not arise in respect of the present writ\npetition. Therefore, the petitioners have not continued in service by\nvirtue of the interim order of Status Quo granted by this Court.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nHowever, their services were ousted, after filing of the writ petition.\n\n65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment deals\nwith the concept of “equal pay for equal work”. Thus, it may not be\nrequired to elaborate the paragraph as far as the present case on\nhand is concerned.\n\n66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states that the\nApex Court of India held that, while directing that appointments,\ntemporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\nare swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for\nsome time and in some cases for a considerable length of time. It is\nnot as if the person who accepts an engagement either temporary or\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He\naccepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true that he is\nnot in a position to bargain- not at arm's length – Since he might\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his\nlivelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone,\nit would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of\nappointment and to take the view that a person who has\ntemporarily or casually got employed should be directed to be\ncontinued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\nmode of public appointment which is not permissible. A total\nembargo of such casual or temporary employment is not possible,\ngiven the exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only\nmean that some people who at least get employment temporarily,\ncontractually or casually, would not be getting even that\nemployment when securing of such employment brings at least\nsome succour to them.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in\nsearch of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual\nor temporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\nemployment. It is in this context that one has to proceed on the\nbasis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature\nof it and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\nwhile accepting the employment, the person concerned knows the\nnature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the\nreal sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\nwhich he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot\nbe considered to be of such a magnitude, so as to enable the giving\nup of the procedure established, for making regular appointments\nto available posts in the services of the State.\n\n68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment,\ntheir Lordships held that the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate\nexpectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they must be\nmade permanent or they must be regularised in the service though\nthey had not been selected in terms of the rules for appointment.\nThe fact that in certain cases the court had directed regularization\nof the employees involved in those cases cannot be made use of, to\nfound a claim based on legitimate expectation. The argument if\naccepted would also run counter to the constitutional mandate. The\nargument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\nenumerates that when a person enters a temporary employment or\ngets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the\nengagement is not based on a proper selection as recognised by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nrelevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such\na person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for\nbeing confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could\nbe made only by following a proper procedure for selection and in\ncases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service\nCommission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot\nbe successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual\nemployees.\n\n70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi Case” Judgment, the\nConstitution Bench considered the right of the employees thus\nappointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are\nviolated. Even in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the\nSupreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages in the\ndepartment concerned on a daily wage that was made known to\nthem. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being\npaid. Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by\nthemselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as\nagainst those who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the\nrelevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on daily\nwages to claim that such employee should be treated on par with a\nregularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment,\neven assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming\nequal wages for equal work. There is no fundamental right for\nthose who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on\ncontractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in\nservice. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be\nholders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nby making appointments consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law compels\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution\nand in the manner we have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the Court is\napproached by way of a writ, the Court has necessarily to ask\nitself whether the person before it had any legal right to be\nenforced. Even, the Constitution Bench dealt with the\nArticle 21\nof\nthe Constitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is so\nmuch poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of\nbargaining power, the action of the State in not making the\nemployees permanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. But the very argument indicates that there are so\nmany waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context, the Constitution\nas one of its basic features, has included Articles 14,16 and 309 so\nas to ensure that public employment is given only in a fair and\nequitable manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\nopportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding rights\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a set of persons cannot be\npreferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\nto compete for State employment.\n\n72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph urged by\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment of “Umadevi Case”.\n\nParagraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhere irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as\nexplained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC\n1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\nand B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979)\n3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made\nand the employees have continued to work for ten years or more\nbut without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals.\n\nThe question of regularisation of the services of such employees\nmay have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles\nsettled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light\nof this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State\nGovernments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are\nbeing now employed. The process must be set in motion within six\nmonths from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on\nthis judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent,\nthose not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n73. The above said paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\nis a one time relief, of Course, granted by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India to mitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntemporary employees. Now, the question arises how long the\nbenefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended to the\nemployees and what is the interpretation of the subsequent\njudgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in respect of\nparagraph (53) of the judgment of the Constitution Bench.\n\n74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India, while stopping the entire irregular appointments and\nback door appointments had taken note of the fact that certain\nreliefs are required in respect of the employees who are already\nregularized or in respect of those persons, a proposal is already\nkept pending. Certainly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have\nnever intended to grant the relief of regularization or permanent\nabsorption in public employment contrary to the legal principles\nsettled in earlier paragraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the judgment\nhas to be understood harmoniously and together with the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench in earlier paragraphs.\n\n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that\nparagraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment cannot be treated\nas an isolation and it should be considered along with the other\nlegal principles settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping in mind,\nthe legal principles settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nearlier paragraphs, this Court is of the opinion that one time relief\ngranted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be extended\nin its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel beyond the\nscope of the intention expressed by the Constitution Bench in\nparagraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of U.P.State\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nElectricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n,\nreported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\njudgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\n\n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the decision\nof this Court in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and has urged that no direction for\nregularisation can be given by the Court. In our opinion, the\ndecision in Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision cannot be applied\nto a case where regularisation has been sought for in pursuance of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.”\n\n77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\ndistinguished that case with the “Umadevi Case”. The very\nlanguage used in Paragraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the\ndecision in “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The said\ndecision cannot be applied to a case where regularization has been\nsought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. However,\nthis Court is of the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished\nthe “Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and circumstances that\nthe case. When their Lordships have distinguished that case, this\nCourt is of the opinion that the legal principles settled in “Umadevi\nCase” has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, as it is a “binding precedent”\nas stated by this Court in earlier paragraphs.\n\n78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding precedent” and when\nthe case was distinguished from “Umadevi Case” on factual\ncircumstances, the same cannot be applied in the present case\nbefore this Court.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal and\nanother Vs. Prantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik\nMahaparishad, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the\nrelevant paragraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. A writ petition was filed before the Uttaranchal High\nCourt which was dismissed by the impugned order. The High Court\nwas of the view that all the 14 workmen, in question, were working\non daily wages for more than six years and had completed 240\ndays in each calendar year and they ought to be regularised.\nAccordingly, the writ petition was dismissed.”\n\n80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this Court is of\nthe opinion that the case relates to an award passed by the Labour\nCourt and an Award passed by the Labour Court under the\nprovisions of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any\nrelevance in respect of the Government employments made by\nvirtue of the rules framed by the State in this regard. However, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in that case, remanded the matter\nback for reconsideration by the High Court in the light of the legal\nprinciples settled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects,\nthe case cannot have any application in respect of the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n81. It has further cited the case of\nState of Karnataka and\nOthers Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n, reported in (2010) 9 SCC\n247 and the relevant paragraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to\nthe general principles against “regularisation” enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1] , if the following conditions are\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nfulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued\nagainst sanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not\npossess the prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person employed\npossessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against\nsanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing the\nprocess of open competitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n82.\nIn\nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved out in\nrelation to the one time relief granted in paragraph (15) of the\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\n83. In the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs. Daya\nLal and Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant\nparagraph (12), enumerates the settled principles in respect of\nregularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context of the case\nand those principles carved out in paragraph (12) of the above\njudgment are akin to that of the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the\nattention of this Court relying the case decided by the Hon'ble Two\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\nreported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph (31) and (33) of\nthe judgments are extracted hereunder:\n\n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the process of\nselection adopted in identifying the appellants herein cannot be\nsaid to be unreasonable or arbitrary in the sense that it was\ndevised to eliminate other eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile\nto note that in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , this Court was dealing with\nappointments made without following any rational procedure in the\nlower rungs of various services of the Union and the States.\n\n33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the need to employ\na certain number of people for discharging a particular\nresponsibility of the State under the Constitution is always with the\nexecutive government of the day subject to the overall control of the\nlegislature. That does not mean that an examination by a\nconstitutional court regarding the accuracy of the assessment of the\nneed is barred.”\n\n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of an\nundoubted opinion that there is a slight deviation in respect of the\nlegal principles carved out by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in\n“Umadevi Case”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\nby the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of “Umadevi Case”. To\nreiterate the language used by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nemphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also occasions to\nissue directions which could not be said to be consisted by the\npublic employment. Such directions are issued presumably on the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbasis of equitable consideration or individualization of justice. The\nquestion arises, equity to whom? Equity for the handful of people\nwho have approached the Court with a claim, or equity for the\nteeming millions of this Country seeking employment and seeking a\nfair opportunity for competing for employment?\n\n86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi Case” judgment,\nagain the Constitution Bench reiterated that “It is also clarified that\nthose decisions which run counter to the principle settled in this\ndecision, or in which directions running counter to what we have\nheld herein, will stand denuded of their status as precedents.”\n\n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the judgment\ncited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of\nNihal\nSingh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n, reported\nin (2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their\nstatus as precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to consider\nand follow the same.\n\n88.\nIn the case of\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and\nothers Vs. State of Orissa and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\nSCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of\nIndia held that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed\nearlier, permitted regularisation of regular appointments and not\nillegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the\nappointments in the instant case could be described as illegal and if\nthey were not, whether the State could be directed to regularise the\nservices of the degree-holder Junior Engineers who have worked as\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nad hoc Assistant Engineers for such a long period, not only on the\nanalogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation but also on\nthe principle underlying para 53 of the decision in Umadevi (3) case\n[\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] .\n\n43.As to what would constitute an irregular appointment is\nno longer res integra. The decision of this Court in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] , has examined that question and explained the principle\nregarding regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\nThe decision\nin that case\nsummed up the following three essentials\nfor regularisation: (1) the employees have worked for ten years or\nmore, (2) that they have so worked in a duly sanctioned post\nwithout the benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or\ntribunal, and (3) they should have possessed the minimum\nqualification stipulated for the appointment. Subject to these three\nrequirements being satisfied, even if the appointment process did\nnot involve open competitive selection, the appointment would be\ntreated irregular and not illegal and thereby qualify for\nregularisation.\n\nPara 7 in this regard is apposite and may be\nextracted at this stage: (\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010)\n2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250)\n\n“7.\n\nIt is evident from the above that there is an exception to the\ngeneral principles against ‘regularisation’ enunciated in\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in a duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of\nthe interim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued\nagainst sanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not\npossess the prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person employed\npossessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against\nsanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing the\nprocess of open competitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n89. It is important to cite the case of\nSECRETARY TO\nGOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT,CHENNAI\nv. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.\n[ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. In\nparagraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as\nfollows:\n\n“8.this Court in\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal & Ors.\n, AIR\n2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of regularisation of\nirregular or part-time appointments in all possible eventualities and\nlaid down well-settled principles relating to regularisation and\nparity in pay relevant in the context of the issues involved therein.\nThe same are as under:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution will not issue directions for regularisation, absorption\nor permanent continuance, unless the employees claiming\nregularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a regular\nrecruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\nprocess, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause\ncontained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed\nand Courts should not issue a direction for regularisation of\nservices of an employee which would be violative of the\nconstitutional scheme. While something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the process of selection\nwhich does not go to the root of the process, can be regularised,\nback door entries, appointments contrary to the constitutional\nscheme and/or appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be\nregularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or daily-\n\nwage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the court,\nwould not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into service, as\nsuch service would be “litigious employment”. Even temporary, ad\nhoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years, let alone\nservice for one or two years, will not entitle such employee to claim\nregularisation, if he is not working against a sanctioned post.\nSympathy and sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for passing\nany order of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation with a\ncut-off date (that is a scheme providing that persons who had put in\na specified number of years of service and continuing in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to others who\nwere appointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or contend\nthat the scheme should be applied to them by extending the cut-off\ndate or seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation as\nthey are not working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot be\na direction for absorption, regularisation or permanent continuance\nof part-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run institutions\ncannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of the\nGovernment on the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can\nemployees in private employment, even if serving full time, seek\nparity in salary with government employees. The right to claim a\nparticular salary against the State must arise under a contract or\nunder a statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n90. Reiterating the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nCase of\nSecretary to Government, School Education Department,\nChennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014)\n4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically ruled\nthat the High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India will not issue directions for regularization,\nabsorption or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\nclaiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a\nregular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\ncompetitive process against sanctioned vacant posts, the equality\nclause contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously\nfollowed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularization\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof services of an employee which would be violative of the\nConstitutional scheme.\n\n91.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and Others\n,\nreported in (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph (25) & (26) are\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid decisions of\nthis Court. The principle as has been\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] has also been applied in relation to the persons who\nwere working on daily wages. According to us, the daily wagers are\nnot appointees in the strict sense of the term “appointment”. They\ndo not hold a post. The scheme of alternative appointment framed\nfor regular employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\nconfer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of abolished\norganisation to such alternative employment.\n\n(See\nAvas Vikas\nSansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n[(2006) 4 SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n613] ) Their relevance in the context of appointment arose by reason\nof the concept of regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position continued to be that of daily\nwagers. Appointment on daily-wage basis is not an appointment to\na post according to the rules. Usually, the projects in which the\ndaily wagers were engaged, having come to an end, their\nappointment is necessarily terminated for want of work. Therefore,\nthe status and rights of daily wagers of a government concern are\nnot equivalent to that of a government servant and his claim to\npermanency has to be adjudged differently.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n26.In these circumstances, in our considered opinion, the\nregularisation/absorption is not a matter of course. It would depend\nupon the facts of the case following the rules and regulations and\ncannot be dehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the above\ntwo paragraphs are running contrary to the legal principles settled\nby the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\nThus, the rules\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution\nBench to be applied in respect of\nthe above case\ncited.\n\n93.\nIn the case of\nMalathi Das and Others, Vs. Suresh\nand Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and the relevant\nparagraph (13) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is wholly\nunnecessary for us to consider as to whether the cases of persons\nwho were awaiting regularisation on the date of the decision in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is required to be dealt with in accordance\nwith the conditions stipulated in para 53 of\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\ninasmuch as the claims of the respondent employees can well be\ndecided on principles of parity.\n\nSimilarly placed employees having\nbeen regularised by the State and in case of some of them such\nregularisation being after the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nwe are of the view that the stand taken by the appellants in\nrefusing regularisation to the respondents cannot be countenanced.\n\nHowever, as the said stand of the appellants stems from their\nperception and understanding of the decision in Umadevi (3) [State\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nwe do not hold them liable for contempt but make it clear that the\nappellants and all the other competent authorities of the State will\nnow be obliged and duty-bound to regularise the services of the\nrespondents (74 in number) which will now be done forthwith and\nin any case within a period of two months from the date of receipt\nof this order.”\n\n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again taken a\ndeviation in respect of the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\nTherefore, such deviation to be held as denuded of their status as\nprecedent, as\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution\nBench.\n\n95.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar and\nOthers\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in paragraph (11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n“11.Elaborating upon the principles\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3)\ncase [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] and explaining the\ndifference between irregular and illegal appointments in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] , this Court held as under: (\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC\n247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an exception to the\ngeneral principles against ‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3)\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following conditions\nare fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10 years or\nmore in duly sanctioned post without the benefit or protection of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ninterim order of any court or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have employed the\nemployee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be illegal, even if\nirregular. Where the appointments are not made or continued\nagainst sanctioned posts or where the persons appointed do not\npossess the prescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person employed\npossessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against\nsanctioned posts, but had been selected without undergoing the\nprocess of open competitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n14.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case that\nthe appellant has served the University for more than 29 years on\nthe post of night guard and that he has served the College on daily\nwages, in the interest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively w.e.f.\n\n3-1-2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post as per the\ndirection of the Registrar).\"\n\n96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the appellant has served\nin the University for more than 29 years in the post of night guard\nand that he has served the College on daily wages, in the interest\nof justice, the authorities are directed to regularise the services of\nthe appellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia has deviated the principles\nlaid down in\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nThus, this Court has to derive an opinion that the decision would be\ndenuded of its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this\nCourt has to independently apply the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n98.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram Vs. Managing Director,\nUttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and\nOthers\n, reported in (2015) 11 SCC 255, undoubtedly, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has decided the case based on the\nfacts and circumstances of the case. However, on a plain reading\nof the judgment, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench has not been considered by the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\nThus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment for the\npurpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n99.\nIn the case of\nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs.\nGreater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Others\n,\nreported in (2015) 14 SCC 382, while, the Supreme Court of\nIndia in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n“13.Considering the facts of the present case on the\ntouchstone\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen\nthat the Division Bench was not right in setting aside the\nappointment of the appellants. More so, it was nobody's case\nchallenging the appointment of the appellants. Admittedly, the\nappellants were engaged as contractual employees from 1994 and\nhave completed more than ten years of continuous service with\nRespondent 1. They continued in service not by the orders of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt/Tribunal, but by the decision of the respondents. The\nappellants were regularised as per the policy decision dated\n16-4-2003 taken by Respondent 1 and approved by the State\nGovernment vide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of\nthe appellants were made pursuant to the policy of regularisation,\nthe High Court was not right in quashing the appointment of the\nappellants as the same were never in question before the High\nCourt. The plea that was raised by the appellants was only to seek\nregularisation with retrospective effect from 20-11-2002 and the\nconsequential seniority.”\n\n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken note of the one time\nbenefit granted by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment in “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles\nsettled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and 54 of the\njudgment has not been considered by their Lordships. Since the\nlegal principles enunciated in the above paragraphs of the\nConstitution Bench has not been considered and the case was\ndecided based on the particular facts and circumstances of the\ncase, this Court is not bound to consider it as a “binding precedent”\nas enumerated in the first portion of this Judgment. This Court has\nearlier considered the nature of the “binding precedents” and the\ninterpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\nrecent case of\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and\nOthers\n, reported in [JT 2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to find out\nthat those cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt of India were decided based on certain facts and\ncircumstances of the case. However, all those circumstances and\nthe legal principles were well settled by the Constitution Bench in\n“Umadevi Case”. Various paragraphs of the Constitution Bench\njudgment as discussed above made it very clear that all the\ncircumstances arisen out of the temporary/casual/daily wages\nemployees were dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided.\nThis being the factum of the case, this Court is not inclined to follow\nthe above judgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India as a “binding precedent” and this\nCourt is bound by the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case” which remains as the law of the land\nunder\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board Vs.\nRanjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“17.A combined reading of the aforementioned paragraphs would\nclearly indicate that what the Constitution Bench had in mind in\ndirecting regularisation was in relation to such appointments, which\nwere irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is explicit. It has\nbeen so pointed out in\nNational Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n\n[(2006) 5 SCC 493 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms:\n\n(SCC pp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n“23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe respondents that the appointments were irregular and not\nillegal, cannot be accepted for more than one reason. They were\nappointed only on the basis of their applications. The Recruitment\nRules were not followed. Even the Selection Committee had not\nbeen properly constituted. In view of the ban on employment, no\nrecruitment was permissible in law. The reservation policy adopted\nby the appellant had not been maintained. Even cases of minorities\nhad not been given due consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing regularisation of the\nservices only of those employees whose appointments were\nirregular as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n[AIR\n1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\nThimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of\nKarnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] wherein this\nCourt observed: [Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , SCC p. 24, para 16]\n\n‘16.\n\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 :\n\n1980 SCC (L&S) 4] this Court clearly held that the words “regular”\nor “regularisation” do not connote permanence and cannot be\nconstrued so as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of\nappointments. They are terms calculated to condone any procedural\nirregularities and are meant to cure only such defects as are\nattributable to methodology followed in making the appointments.’\n\n25. Judged by the standards\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the\naforementioned decisions, the appointments of the respondents are\nillegal.\n\nThey do not, thus, have any legal right to continue in\nservice.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(See also\nState of M.P. v. Yogesh Chandra Dubey\n[(2006) 8 SCC\n67 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1797] and State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (2006) 12 Scale 642] .)”\n\n103. The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India has dealt with the interpretation of paragraphs 16,\n17, 19 and 22 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17),\n(19) and (22) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC\n507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] this Court clearly held\nthat the words “regular” or “regularisation” do not connote\npermanence and cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of\nthe nature of tenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to\ncondone any procedural irregularities and are meant to cure only\nsuch defects as are attributable to methodology followed in making\nthe appointments. This Court emphasised that when rules framed\nunder\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution are in force, no regularisation\nis permissible in exercise of the executive powers of the Government\nunder\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution in contravention of the rules.\n\nThese decisions and the principles recognised therein have not\nbeen dissented to by this Court and on principle, we see no reason\nnot to accept the proposition as enunciated in the above decisions.\nWe have, therefore, to keep this distinction in mind and proceed on\nthe basis that only something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the process of selection\nwhich does not go to the root of the process, can be regularised and\nthat it alone can be regularised and granting permanence of\nemployment is a totally different concept and cannot be equated\nwith regularisation.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional scheme of public\nemployment in this country, and the executive, or for that matter the\ncourt, in appropriate cases, would have only the right to regularise\nan appointment made after following the due procedure, even\nthough a non-fundamental element of that process or procedure\nhas not been followed. This right of the executive and that of the\ncourt would not extend to the executive or the court being in a\nposition to direct that an appointment made in clear violation of the\nconstitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made in that behalf,\ncan be treated as permanent or can be directed to be treated as\npermanent.\n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also controlled by\neconomic considerations and financial implications of any public\nemployment. The viability of the department or the instrumentality\nof the project is also of equal concern for the State. The State works\nout the scheme taking into consideration the financial implications\nand the economic aspects. Can the court impose on the State a\nfinancial burden of this nature by insisting on regularisation or\npermanence in employment, when those employed temporarily are\nnot needed permanently or regularly? As an example, we can\nenvisage a direction to give permanent employment to all those who\nare being temporarily or casually employed in a public sector\nundertaking. The burden may become so heavy by such a direction\nthat the undertaking itself may collapse under its own weight. It is\nnot as if this had not happened. So, the court ought not to impose a\nfinancial burden on the State by such directions, as such directions\nmay turn counterproductive.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question whether the\njettisoning of the constitutional scheme of appointment can be\napproved, was not considered or decided. The distinction\nemphasised in\nR.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(1972) 1 SCC\n409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The Court\nappears to have been dealing with a scheme for “equal pay for\nequal work” and in the process, without an actual discussion of the\nquestion, had approved a scheme put forward by the State,\nprepared obviously at the direction of the Court, to order permanent\nabsorption of such daily-rated workers. With respect to the learned\njudges, the decision cannot be said to lay down any law, that all\nthose engaged on daily wages, casually, temporarily, or when no\nsanctioned post or vacancy existed and without following the rules\nof selection, should be absorbed or made permanent though not at\na stretch, but gradually. If that were the ratio, with respect, we have\nto disagree with it.”\n\n104.\nIn the case of\nPost Master General, Kolkata and\nOthers Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported in (2007) 5 SCC 317,\nparagraphs (5) & (18) are relevant and the same are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction, although the case\nof Niva Ghosh was allegedly considered, her case was not,\nwhereupon a contempt petition was filed. In the said contempt\nproceedings, a stand was taken by the appellant that she had not\ncompleted a period of 240 days in a year before the said cut-off\ndate. The said contempt petition was dismissed with liberty to the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nrespondent to file a fresh original application. Pursuant to the said\nobservations, the respondent filed an application before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which was\nmarked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n18.There are two distinctive features in the present case,\nwhich are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot be invoked\nwhere any illegality has been committed or where no legal right is\nestablished.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having completed 240\ndays, does not fulfil the requisite criteria. A disputed question of\nfact has been raised. The High Court did not come to a positive\nfinding that she had worked for more than 240 days in a year.”\n\n105.\nIn the case of\nC.Balachandran and Others Vs. State\nof Kerala and Others\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610,\nwherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India interpreted the scope of\nparagraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (17) & (18)\nof\nthe said judgment\nand the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n“17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon the\nobservations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] which reads as under: (SCC p. 42, para 53)\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where\nirregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in\n\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1\nSCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\nand B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 :\n\n1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para 15 above, of duly\nqualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmade and the employees have continued to work for ten years or\nmore but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularisation of the services of such\nemployees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the\nprinciples settled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in\nthe light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\nState Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are\nbeing now employed. The process must be set in motion within six\nmonths from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on\nthis judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the\nconstitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent,\nthose not duly appointed as per the constitutional\nscheme.”(emphasis in original)\n\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality and was not\nsub judice would not come within the purview of exception to the\nrule contained in Para 53 of\nthe said judgment\n. The appellants'\ncase, thus, does not come within the purview thereof. Only those\ncases where regularisations had already been made were not to be\nreopened. It is not in dispute that services of the appellants were\nterminated as far back as in 1987 and they did not question the\nlegality or validity of the said order.\n\nIt is only after the decision of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthis Court in\nJacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 :\n(1991) 15 ATC 697] that representations were filed. Such\nrepresentations were rejected both by the Kerala Water Authority\nas also the State of Kerala.\n\n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither in law nor in\nequity were entitled to be reinstated in service. The decision of this\nCourt in\nJacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991)\n15 ATC 697] being not applicable to the case of the appellants, we\nare bound by the\nratio\nlaid down in\nUmadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So far as Para 53 of the judgment of the\nConstitution Bench in the said case is concerned, the same has\nbeen considered by this Court in a large number of decisions.\nIn\n\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board v. Ranjodh Singh\n[(2007) 2\nSCC 491 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para\n\n15)\n\n“15. The question came up for consideration before a Constitution\nBench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] wherein it was held that no person\nwho was temporarily or casually been employed could be directed\nto be continued permanently.\n\nIt was opined that by doing so it\nwould be creating another mode of public employment which is not\npermissible.”\n\n[See\nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn. Ltd.\n[(2006) 6\nSCC 310 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar\nVerma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (\n2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post\nMaster General v. Tutu Das (Dutta\n) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2\nSCC (L&S) 179] .\n]”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the judgment,\nis well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India as cited above, this Court is not\ninclined to consider the other judgments referred by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner. However, on a perusal of all these\njudgments cited supra, this Court is of the opinion that ultimately\nthe legal principle settled in by the Constitution Bench in the\n“Umadevi Case” is binding over the subject and the same is to be\nfollowed scrupulously by all the Courts across the country and the\nsame becomes the law of the land in the matter of regularization,\npermanent absorption and appointment.\n\n107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of the\ncase on hand, it remains that the writ petitioners were appointed as\ndaily rated employees for a particular period and, this Court has to\ndraw an inference that all the Government orders passed\nsubsequent to the Constitution Bench Judgment, if runs contrary to\nthe legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench, would become\ninvalid and the same cannot be implemented or followed. In other\nwords, it is to be noted that the Government has no authority to\nissue any orders granting regularization, permanent absorption or\nappointment in violation of the Constitutional schemes and in\nviolation of the recruitment rules in force. The power of the\nGovernment in this regard is certainly abrogated by the principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”. Such\nbeing the factum of the case, the State Government is to be\nprecluded as well as its authority are to be regularized in respect of\nappointing employees in contravention with the recruitment rules in\nforce and effecting appointments through back doors.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n108. This Court has to place on record that the State is\nbound to over see the appointments made in this regard illegally or\nirregularly by the competent authorities and the same is to be\nconstrued as the fraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\nliable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal Rules and\nother relevant rules. The State shall be vigilant in this regard and\nthe authorities indulging in such activities of exercising powers by\nissuing illegal or irregular appointments are to be booked under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by the\nState in this regard, since these all are the Constitutional principles\nrequired for the State to be followed and the State being a modal\nemployer, has to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\nprinciples scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in\nparagraph (15) of the judgment in “Umadevi Case”, the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that\na distinction between regularisation and conferment of permanent\nstatus in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This Court is of the\nopinion that the conferment of permanent status Act, is a general\nlaw applicable to the employees, in the absence of any special law\ngoverning the particular subject. However, if any such law prevails\nand covering the field of appointment of regularisation and\npermanent absorption, then the general law would not apply. In\nnutshell, the special law and rules will prevail over the general law\nand the special rules in force are to be applied in the relevant case\n\n110. In view of the discussions made above, this Court is of\nthe opinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for any relief of\npermanent absorption as such sought for in this writ petition.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n8. The above cited case is strictly connected with the engagement of\n\ndaily wage employees in Water Resources Organization / Public Works\n\nDepartment.\n\n9. In view of the above, the writ petitioner is not entitled for the\n\nbenefits of regularization and permanent absorption. Further, the writ\n\npetitioner even at the time of filing the present writ petition was aged about 58\n\nyears and now he would have aged about 63 years. Thus, the grant of\n\nregularization and permanent absorption does not arise at all.\n\n10. Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed.
