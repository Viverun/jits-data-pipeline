The Lessor understands that cure\n period to rectify the defect is 30 days.

On 9 May 2023, the petitioner addressed a Notice of Default to\n both the respondents. In view of the fact that the leased area had been\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 5 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n further sold by Ambience to Tutelage, the notice stated that it was\n being addressed to both the respondents. The notice alleged that the\n leased area was not habitable and that the columns in the leased area\n did not possess the requisite compressive strength and would require\n repair. As neither Ambience nor Tutelage took any steps in this\n regard, the notice alleged that the petitioner had to spend considerable\n amounts in attempting to make the leased area habitable. It was further\n pointed out that the Enforcement Directorate had also issued a Public\n Notice stating that the entire building at Commercial Plot No.10 had\n been attached by it in relation to an investigation into the affairs of the\n Ambience Group. In these circumstances, the notice alleged that the\n petitioner was not in a position to enjoy the leased area. The\n petitioner, therefore, invoked Clause 18.2 of the lease deed which\n entitled the petitioner to terminate the lease deed, if the leased area\n became unusable for the petitioner. Alleging that Ambience was in\n fundamental breach of its obligations under the lease deed, and had\n failed to provide the usable leased area to the petitioner despite\n repeated representations in that regard, the petitioner stated that it\n intended to terminate the lease deed. The respondents were therefore\n called upon to cure the defaults in the leased area within 60 days, by\n providing a habitable and usable access to the leased area and\n reimbursing to the petitioner the amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90, stated to\n have been incurred by the petitioner in executing the repairs in the\n leased area. Failure, on the part of the respondents, to cure the\n defaults within 60 days, it was said, would constrain the petitioner to\n issue a notice for cancellation of the lease deed.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 6 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n 7. The period of 60 days, provided in the notice, expired on 9 July\n 2023. Neither of the respondents, however, took any step towards\n curing the defaults indicated by the petitioner. The petitioner,\n therefore, addressed a second communication to both the respondents\n on 10 July 2023, alleging that the respondents continued to be in\n breach of their obligations to provide a habitable and usable access to\n the leased area to the petitioner and to reimburse the amounts spent by\n the petitioner in repairing the premises. The respondents were,\n therefore, put on notice that failure, on their part, to cure the notified\n defects within 30 days would result in ipso facto\n cancellation/termination of the Lease Deed. The notice also asserted\n that the petitioner was entitled to recover, from the respondents, the\n security deposit of ₹ 1,92,48,300/-, maintenance security deposit of ₹\n 47,05,140/- and any other amounts due to the petitioner, apart from ₹\n 1,29,01,487.90 incurred by the petitioner in repairing the leased area.\n\n 8. According to the petitioner, as the notified defects were not\n cured by the respondents, the lease deed stood terminated on 10\n August 2023. The petitioner in the circumstances, addressed a\n communication dated 10 August 2023 to Tutelage, handing over\n thereunder the vacant, physical and actual possession of the leased\n area to Tutelage.\n\n 9. Simultaneously, the petitioner addressed a Notice of Demand to\n both the respondents, calling upon them to pay, to the petitioner, a\n total amount of ₹ 14,63,44,072.29 towards cost of repairs and reworks\n carried out by the petitioner and agreed to be repaid by Ambience, as\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 7 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n well as other costs incurred by the petitioner, and compensation for\n the losses suffered by the petitioner. The respondents were called\n upon to pay the aforesaid amount within 30 days, failing which the\n petitioner stated that it would seek recourse to appropriate legal\n remedies.\n\n 10. Ambience responded on 11 September 2023, denying all\n liabilities in the matter in view of the sale of the leased area to\n Tutelage on 18 November 2022, with concomitant transfer of all its\n rights and obligations. The situation thus reached a stage, according to\n the petitioner, where it was left with no option but to seek recourse to\n the remedies available in law.\n\n 11. In accordance with the protocol envisaged by Clause 26.1 of the\n Lease Deed, the petitioner addressed a notice to the respondents on 12\n September 2023 calling upon them to settle the matter amicably.\n\n 12. This attempt also failed. The petitioner, thereupon, issued a\n notice to the respondents under Section 214 of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 19965 on 3 October 2023, proposing resolution of\n the disputes between the petitioner and respondents by arbitration.\n The petitioner suggested the name of Hon'ble Ms. Justice R.\n Banumathi, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to arbitrate\n on the issue.\n\n 4\n\n 21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings. - Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral\n proceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be\n referred to arbitration is received by the respondent.\n\n 5\n\n \"The 1996 Act\", hereinafter\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 8 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n 13. On 2 November 2023, Ambience replied, denying all liability in\n the matter. There has been no response from Tutelage to the Notice of\n Arbitration dated 3 October 2023.\n\n 14. It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has approached\n this Court under Section 11(6)6 of the 1996 Act, requiring the Court to\n appoint an Arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes between the\n petitioner and respondents.\n\n 15. Both the respondents have filed counter-affidavits by way of\n response to the writ petition and the petitioner has filed rejoinders\n thereto.\n\n Rival Submissions\n\n 16. I have heard lengthy arguments from both sides. The petitioner\n was represented by Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned Senior Counsel\n assisted by learned Counsel Mr. Sidharth Sethi, Ms. Pragya Chauhan,\n Mr. Kunal Saini and Ms. Meherunissa Anand. Mr. V. Anush Raajan\n appeared for Ambience and Mr. Hitesh Sachar represented Tutelage.\n\n Opening submissions of Mr. Raj Shekhar Rao\n\n 6\n\n (6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,--\n\n (a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n (b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them\n under that procedure; or\n\n (c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it\n under that procedure,\n the appointment shall be made, on an application of the party, by the arbitral institution designated by the\n Supreme Court, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by the High Court, in case of arbitrations\n other than international commercial arbitration, as the case may be to take the necessary measure, unless the\n agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 9 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n 17. Mr. Rao submits that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed dated 15\n January 2021 releases Ambience only from \"further liability\".\n Moreover, Clause 23.1 recorded the consent of Ambience to attorn the\n lease to Tutelage provided Tutelage honoured the terms of the Lease\n Deed. He submits that no such document, attorning the lease to\n Tutelage, was ever signed by his client. Ambience, therefore,\n continues to remain liable to the petitioner.\n\n 18. At the same time, possession of the leased area was handed over\n by Ambience to Tutelage. Ambience also transferred the security\n deposit paid by the petitioner to Tutelage. Any direction for refund of\n the security deposit would, therefore, have to be issued to Tutelage.\n Moreover, inasmuch as the petitioner continued to remain in the\n leased area for nearly 9 months after the sale thereof to Tutelage, the\n issue of the extent to which Ambience, or Tutelage, or both, would be\n liable to the petitioner, also fell for determination.\n\n 19. Thus, submits Mr. Rao, both respondents have necessarily to be\n impleaded as parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for\n the learned arbitrator to adjudicate on the situs of liability.\n\n Submissions of Mr. Raajan in reply\n\n 20. Mr. V. Anush Raajan, appearing for Ambience, draws my\n attention to paras 2.5 and 2.6 of the present petition, which read thus:\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 10 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n \"2.5 Subsequent to the execution of the Lease Deed, the\n Petitioner was informed on 5 December 2022 that Respondent No\n 1 had sold the Leased Area to Respondent No 2 in November 2022\n and that:\n\n (i) all payments on deposits made by the Petitioner\n under and in terms of the Lease Deed had been transferred\n by Respondent No. 1 to Respondent No. 2;\n\n (ii) Respondent No. 1 had assigned all its rights and\n obligations under the Lease Deed to Respondent No. 2.\n\n 2.6 As such, the Respondent No. 2 stepped into the shoes of\n Respondent No. 1 with effect from November 2022 and became\n the successor in interest to the Respondent No. 1. Respondent No.\n 2 is entitled to all rights which were enforceable by the Respondent\n No. 1 under the Lease Deed and is bound by all obligations that\n Respondent No. 1 was bound by, without any further act or deed.\n Being the assignee and successor interest of Respondent No. 1,\n Respondent No. 2 is also bound by the arbitration clause contained\n in the Lease Deed and is a necessary party for the proper, fair and\n final adjudication of the disputes between the parties.\"\n\n \nMr. Raajan submits that the petitioner was, therefore, always aware of\n the sale of the leased area to Tutelage. No live dispute, therefore, he\n submits, survives between the petitioner and Ambience. The\n petitioner cannot, therefore, forcibly involve Ambience in the\n proposed arbitral proceedings. He relies on paras 25 and 28 of\n \nN.T.P.C. Ltd v. SPML Infra Ltd7\n to submit that a Court which is\n seized with an application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act has\n also to examine whether a live arbitral dispute exists between the\n parties.\n\n Submissions of Mr. Hitesh Sachar\n\n 21. Mr. Hitesh Sachar, appearing for Tutelage, on the other hand,\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 11 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n echoes Mr. Rao's submission that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed only\n insulates Ambience from \"further liability\". Inasmuch as the\n allegation of the petitioner against Ambience relates to a period prior\n to the sale of the leased area to Tutelage, Mr. Sachar submits that\n Ambience continues to remain liable towards the petitioner and, in\n fact, Tutelage has no liability in that regard. He also draws attention\n to paras 3, 4 and 11 of the Legal Notice dated 9 May 2023 addressed\n by the petitioner to the respondents, which read thus:\n\n \"3. As per the terms of the Lease Deed, Ambience was obliged to\n provide the Leased Area to ESRI in a habitable, accessible\n condition to enable ESRI to be able to use it for its activities.\n Ambience had also represented that the Leased Area was\n structurally sound and in good condition. Even otherwise, in law\n also, providing habitable access to the leased area is a fundamental\n obligation of the lessor.\n\n 4. However, it is an admitted fact and a matter of record that till\n date (i.e. even after 2.5 years of execution of the Lease Deed),\n Ambience/Tutelage has failed to provide a habitable or usable\n Leased Area to ESRI. This fact has been documented in various\n communications, photographs and reports of third-party\n vendors/consultants. Pertinently, on 29 August 2022, Ambience\n had categorically acknowledged that the compressive strength on\n all columns in the Leased Area and Building failed to meet the\n appropriate requirements which would require repair.\n\n 11. Therefore, by way of this notice, ESRI is notifying the\n defaults/breaches of Ambience/Tutelage and as a last opportunity,\n calling upon Ambience/Tutelage to cure the defaults within a\n period of 60 days by:\n\n a. Providing a habitable and usable access to the Leased\n Area to ESRI;\n\n b. Reimbursing the amount of INR 1,29,01,487.90 incurred\n by ESRI in executing repair works for water leakage and\n accommodating Landlord's structural remediation work\n within the Leased Area.\"\n\n Mr. Sachar points out that, in para 3 of the Legal Notice, the\n\n 7\n\n (2023) 9 SCC 385\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 12 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n petitioner's clear allegation was against Ambience, in failing to\n provide the leased area to the petitioner in a habitable and accessible\n condition. Even in paras 4 and 11, he submits that the petitioner's\n allegation continues to remain against Ambience. The claims of the\n petitioner in para 11, he submits, have also to be met by Ambience,\n not by Tutelage.\n\n 22. Mr. Sachar also places reliance on para 15, 16 and 19 of the\n reply tendered by Ambience to the Notice of Demand dated 10\n August 2023 of the petitioner:\n\n \"15. As per the terms of the lease deed, ESRI is liable to pay\n Ambience INR 5,77,44,900/- towards arrears of Rent between May\n 2021 and November 2022, Late Charges for each month of delay\n applied to every month between May 2021 to November 2022\n applicable to rent arrears up to the date of issuance of the present\n letter in terms of Clause 2.4., in the amount of INR 2, 19,43,062/-,\n Maintenance charges amounting to INR 1,41,15,420/-. Our Client\n has several times passed on the relevant information regarding\n outstanding payments to ESRI, however, the same have not been\n paid till date is admitted.\n\n 16.

You\n will note that the above demanded amount will carry interest@\n 18% per annum up to the date of payment, if the demanded amount\n is not paid within the 30 days of receipt of the present letter and a\n cure period of 30 days.\n\n *****\n\n 19. On several occasions, including but not limited to the\n emails from Sim Saran, Senior Real Estate Attorney of 01.11.2022\n and emails from Mr. Rohit Singh of India Operations, ESRI that\n ESRI even as of November 2022 was in occupation of the Leased\n Area and was running its operations from the premises. All the\n requests of ESRI to delay the rent commencement on one pretext\n or the other, viz. water seepage in July 2022 or the structural\n integrity improvements and reports, were denied by Ambience and\n demands were raised on several occasions. However, ESRI on one\n hand occupying the Leased Area merely used the reason of\n improvement works to be done by Ambience in terms of the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 13 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n Leased Deed refused to pay the Rent, Maintenance and Other\n Charges.\"\n\n The counter claims of Ambience, therefore, he submits, are also\n against the petitioner. The contractual liability, if any, therefore, is\n between the petitioner and Ambience. He further submits that there\n has never been any attornment of the lease by the petitioner to\n Tutelage.\n\n 23. Mr. Sachar therefore submits that it is not Ambience, but\n Tutelage, which is being unnecessarily dragged into arbitral\n proceedings.\n\n Mr. Rao's submissions in rejoinder\n\n 24. Advancing submissions by way of rejoinder to the submissions\n of Mr. Raajan and Mr. Sachar, Mr. Rao submits that, inasmuch as the\n leased area was sold by Ambience to Tutelage on 18 November 2022,\n and, on 10 August 2023, possession of the leased area was handed\n over by the petitioner to Tutelage, both respondents have necessarily\n to be made parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for the\n arbitrator to adjudicate as to the actual situs of liability.\n\n 25. Mr. Rao alludes to the following e-mail dated 29 August 2022\n addressed by Ambience to the petitioner, to submit that Ambience\n cannot seek to escape its liability merely on the ground that it had sold\n the leased area to Tutelage along with all rights and obligations:\n\n \"Dear Sim,\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 14 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n Please find attached the structural report for ND testing done by\n TPC, Structural consultants and structural designers of the\n Ambience Tower Shalimar Bagh Building.\n\n To our astonishment the compressive strength of some columns on\n the eighth floor is not at par as per the latest design parameters.\n TPC on the basis of the ND test and the design analysis have\n suggested certain strengthening and retrofitting details which are to\n be followed from ground up.

This is why the petitioner\n was compelled to issue a Notice of Default to the respondents to\n terminate the lease. Mr. Rao points out that, in the Notice of Default\n addressed by the petitioner to the respondents on 9 May 2023, the\n petitioner had claimed not only provision of a habitable and usable\n access to the leased area but also reimbursement of the amount of ₹\n 1,29,01,487.90 spent by the petitioner in executing repair of the leased\n area.

It would be for the learned arbitrator to adjudicate on\n this issue. For this purpose, Mr. Rao further refers me to the\n following paras from the Notice of Demand sent by the petitioner to\n the respondents on 10 August 2023:\n\n \"3. In terms of clause 18.2 of the Lease Deed,\n Ambience/Tutelage is obliged to refund the following refundable\n deposits to ESRI within 30 days of the termination of the Lease\n Deed (i.e. by 9 September 2023):\n\n 3.1 Interest free refundable security deposit equivalent to 6\n months' rent amounting to ₹ 1,92,48,300; and\n\n 3.2 Maintenance Security Deposit amounting to ₹ 47,05,140.\n\n 4. In addition to the above, in view of the fundamental\n breaches/defaults committed by Ambience/Tutelage, ESRI is also\n entitled to receive the below amounts incurred by:\n\n 4.1 Cost of Repairs and Reworks carried out by ESRI and\n agreed to be reimbursed by Ambience\n\n 4.1.1 It is an admitted fact that ESRI has spent\n considerable amounts in attempting to make the Leased\n Area habitable and usable. An amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90\n was incurred by ESRI in executing repair works for water\n leakage and to accommodate structural remediation work\n within the Leased Area. Though Ambience had admitted\n its liability to reimburse such amount to ESRI, it has failed\n to do so to date, despite repeated requests.\n\n 4.2 Other costs incurred by ESRI\n\n 4.2.1 ESRI had installed certain enhancements and fit\n outs over the Leased Area and had to expend substantial\n amounts towards the same.

However, it is not\n possible and/or feasible to remove certain enhancements\n made to the Leased Area by ESRI.

At the same time, since these are being\n left behind, Ambience/Tutelage will obviously benefit from\n these enhancements that have been installed at ESRI's cost.\n\n However, for ESRI, these are sunk costs, attributable solely\n to the breaches by Ambience/Tutelage. Consequently,\n Ambience/Tutelage is also liable to pay these sunk costs to\n ESRI. ESRI is in the process of quantifying the exact sunk\n costs incurred by it towards the enhancements that cannot\n be removed and the quantification will be submitted in due\n course.\n\n \n27. Mr. Rao also refers me to the reply dated 11 September 2023 by\n Ambience to the said notice, and points out that though, in the said\n reply, Ambience has disowned all liabilities vis-a-vis the petitioner\n regarding determination of lease and its sequelae, it has nonetheless\n answered the claim of damages for the period during which the\n ownership of the property continued to be with Ambience, i.e. prior to\n sale of property to Tutelage. Thus, he submits that Ambience cannot\n completely disclaim liability in the transaction. Mr. Rao has also\n placed reliance on para 163 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench\n of the Supreme Court in \nCox and Kings Ltd v. SAP India Pvt Ltd8\n.\n\n 28. Mr. Rao submits that, in view of Section 16(1)9 of the 1996\n Act, which incorporates the kompetenz-kompetenz doctrine, the issue\n of the relevant parties to an arbitral dispute goes to the very root of the\n competence of the Arbitral Tribunal, and must be left to the Arbitral\n Tribunal.\n\n 8\n\n (2024) 4 SCC 1\n\n 9\n\n 16.

Prior to the insertion of sub section (6A) in \nSection 11\n, the view\n of the Supreme Court with respect to the issues which could be\n examined by a referral court, seized with a petition for referring a\n dispute to arbitration, was more expansive. \nIn \nNational Insurance\n Co.

Master\n Construction Co.15\n, that where reliance was placed on a discharge\n voucher, no claim certificate or settlement agreement as evidence of\n discharge of the claim, the referral court had to prima facie examine\n the credibility of the allegations before referring the dispute to\n arbitration.\n \nFurther in \nNew India Assurance Co.

Apparently of the view that a referral court ought not to enter\n into these aspects, which should be left for decision by the Arbitral\n Tribunal, the legislature, by the 2015 Amendment Act. introduced sub\n\n \n-section (6A) in \nSection 11\n of the 1996 Act. \nSection 11(6A)\n, plainly\n read, strictly confines the scope of examination by a referral court\n exercising referral jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n to the existence of\n an arbitration agreement. This position was explicitly elucidated, by\n the Supreme Court, in \nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port\n Ltd17\n, by ruling that the jurisdiction of the referral court was,\n following the insertion of \nSection 11(6A)\n, \"limited to examining\n whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties - nothing\n more, nothing less\".\n\n \n33. A two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in \nUnited India\n Insurance Co Ltd v. Antique Art Exports Pvt.

Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court,\n in \nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation20\n, examined the entire\n legal position and held thus:\n\n \"133. Prima facie case in the context of \nSection 8\n is not to be\n confused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which\n has to be established before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is restricted to\n the subject-matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under a\n valid arbitration agreement. Prima facie case means that the\n assertions on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the\n principles of separation and competence-competence and \nSection\n 34\n of the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting bogged\n down would compel the parties to abide unless there are good and\n substantial reasons to the contrary.\n\n 134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a primary\n first review to weed out manifestly and ex facie non-existent and\n invalid arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. The\n prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood\n and trim off the side branches in straightforward cases where\n dismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law\n the litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the court is\n certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists or the\n disputes/subject-matter are not arbitrable, the application\n under \nSection 8\n would be rejected. At this stage, the court should\n not get lost in thickets and decide debatable questions of facts.\n Referral proceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini\n trial......\n\n *****\n\n 138. ......On the other hand, issues relating to contract\n formation, existence, validity and non-arbitrability would be\n connected and intertwined with the issues underlying the merits of\n the respective disputes/claims. They would be factual and disputed\n and for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.\n\n 139. We would not like to be too prescriptive, albeit observe that\n the court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent wastage of public\n\n 20\n\n (2021) 1 SCC 1\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 21 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n and private resources, can exercise judicial discretion to conduct an\n intense yet summary prima facie review while remaining conscious\n that it is to assist the arbitration procedure and not usurp\n jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full\n review or a long-drawn review at the referral stage would obstruct\n and cause delay undermining the integrity and efficacy of\n arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Conversely, if the\n court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine\n effectiveness of both the arbitration and the court. There are certain\n cases where the prima facie examination may require a deeper\n consideration. The court's challenge is to find the right amount of\n and the context when it would examine the prima facie case or\n exercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance between\n avoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral stage and\n protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\n clearly non-arbitrable.\n\n 140. Accordingly, when it appears that prima facie review\n would be inconclusive, or on consideration inadequate as it\n requires detailed examination, the matter should be left for final\n determination by the Arbitral Tribunal selected by the parties by\n consent. The underlying rationale being not to delay or defer and to\n discourage parties from using referral proceeding as a ruse to delay\n and obstruct. In such cases a full review by the courts at this stage\n would encroach on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and\n violate the legislative scheme allocating jurisdiction between the\n courts and the Arbitral Tribunal. Centralisation of litigation with\n the Arbitral Tribunal as the primary and first adjudicator is\n beneficent as it helps in quicker and efficient resolution of\n disputes.\n\n *****\n\n 153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression \"existence of an\n arbitration agreement\" in \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, would\n include aspect of validity of an arbitration agreement, albeit the\n court at the referral stage would apply the prima facie test on the\n basis of principles set out in this judgment. In cases of debatable\n and disputable facts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the\n court would force the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement\n as the Arbitral Tribunal has primary jurisdiction and authority to\n decide the disputes including the question of jurisdiction and non-\n arbitrability.\n\n 154.

Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the\n court under \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act is\n identical but extremely limited and restricted.\n\n 154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the\n legislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of\n 2019, and the principle of severability and competence-\n competence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred\n first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\n arbitrability. The court has been conferred power of\n \"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post the\n award in terms of sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of \nSection\n 34(2)(a)\n or sub-clause (i) of \nSection 34(2)(b)\n of the\n Arbitration Act.\n\n 154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere\n at \nSection 8\n or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie\n certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,\n invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature\n and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent,\n determine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The\n restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties\n from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\n demonstrably \"non-arbitrable\" and to cut off the deadwood.\n The court by default would refer the matter when\n contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly\n arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings\n would be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are\n contested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts\n delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration\n proceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into\n a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the\n jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and\n uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative\n dispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\n The decision in NTPC\n\n \n35.

SPML Infra Ltd21\n, on which Mr.\n Sachar places reliance. The appeal in NTPC arose from a decision\n rendered by this Court. NTPC and SPML Infra22 executed a contract\n for installation services in a power project situated at\n Vishakhapatnam. SPML furnished bank guarantees to the tune of ₹\n 14,96,89,136/- to secure NTPC. NTPC issued a Completion\n Certificate on 27 March 2019, but withheld the bank guarantees. On\n SPML inquiring about the reasons for withholding the bank\n guarantees, NTPC referred to certain pending liabilities and disputes\n with SPML with respect to other projects. SPML protested, stating\n that NTPC had no jurisdiction to link the bank guarantees to other\n liabilities of SPML. Following this, SPML raised a demand of ₹\n 72,01,53,899/- on NTPC. NTPC, naturally, did not release the bank\n guarantees, resulting in SPML filing WP (C) 7213/2019 before this\n Court for a direction to NTPC to release the bank guarantees\n forthwith.\n\n 36. Pending the writ petition, NTPC and SPML entered into a\n settlement agreement on 27 May 2020, whereunder NTPC agreed to\n release the withheld bank guarantees and SPML agreed to withdraw\n WP (C) 7213/2019 and also not to initiate any other proceedings,\n including arbitration. The bank guarantees were, therefore, released\n by NTPC on 30 June 2020, and SPML withdrew WP (C) 7213/2019\n on 21 September 2020.

It was alleged, in the said\n petition, that SPML had been forced to enter into the settlement\n agreement dated 27 May 2020 by duress and coercion. It was alleged\n that the retention of the bank guarantees by NTPC had left SPML with\n no option but to agree to sign the settlement agreement. Submitting\n that NTPC had failed to appoint an arbitrator despite repeated requests\n by SPML, SPML requested this Court to step in and appoint an\n arbitrator in exercise of its power under \nSection 11(6)\n of the 1996 Act.\n\n 37. Responding to the writ petition, NTPC submitted, inter alia,\n that no dispute survived between the parties in view of the settlement\n agreement dated 27 May 2020, in compliance of which NTPC\n released, to SPML, the bank guarantees and SPML withdrew WP(C)\n 7213/2019. The claim of SPML, therefore, stood discharged by\n accord and satisfaction. The allegations of duress and coercion were\n categorically denied as false and attempt to wriggle out of the\n settlement agreement. NTPC, therefore, prayed that SPML's petition\n under \nSection 11(6)\n of the 1996 Act be rejected outright.\n\n 38. This Court held, on SPML's plea of duress and coercion and\n NTPC's response thereto, that it was unable to accept NTPC's\n contention that the dispute as to whether the contract between NTPC\n and SPML stood discharged/novated by the settlement agreement\n dated 27 May 2020 was untenable, insubstantial, or frivolous.

NTPC appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n 40. The Supreme Court took note of the decisions already cited\n hereinabove, upto Vidya Drolia, as well as a subsequent decision of\n the Supreme Court in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd23.\n Having examined all these decisions, the Supreme Court held the\n position of law to be thus:\n\n \"25. Eye of the Needle: The above-referred precedents\n crystallise the position of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of\n the courts under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act is very narrow and\n inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence\n and the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an\n inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's\n privity to the said agreement. These are matters which require a\n thorough examination by the referral court. The secondary inquiry\n that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to the\n non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n 26. As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral tribunal is the\n preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of\n non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule, and rarely as a\n demurrer, the referral court may reject claims which are manifestly\n and ex-facie non-arbitrable...\n\n 27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of\n a claim is only prima facie. Referral courts must not undertake a\n full review of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a\n primary first review and let facts speak for themselves. This also\n requires the courts to examine whether the assertion on\n arbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the\n facts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige\n of doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable.

It has been\n termed as a legitimate interference by courts to refuse reference in\n order to prevent wastage of public and private resources31.\n\n \nFurther, as noted in \nVidya Drolia\n (supra), if this duty within the\n limited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too\n reluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both,\n arbitration and the Court32.\n \nTherefore, this Court or a High Court,\n as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under \nSection\n 11(6)\n of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to\n deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of\n the chosen arbitrator, as explained in \nDLF Home Developers\n Limited v. Rajapura Homes Pvt\n. Ltd24.\"\n\n 41. The Supreme Court went on, thereafter, to apply these\n principles to the facts before it and held on facts thus:\n\n \"44. A simple narration of the bare facts, as indicated above,\n leads us to conclude that the allegations of coercion and economic\n duress are not bona fide, and that there were no pending claims\n between the parties for submission to arbitration. The\n Respondent's claim fits in the description of an attempt to initiate\n \"ex facie meritless, frivolous and dishonest litigation\". We will\n endeavour to give reasons for our conclusion.\n\n 45. The whole dispute revolves around the solitary act of the\n Appellant, NTPC, in not returning the Bank Guarantees despite the\n successful completion of work. This continued even after SPML\n issued the No-Demand Certificate and NTPC released the final\n payment. These undisputed facts led to the institution of the Writ\n Petition before the Delhi High Court. There were no allegations of\n coercion or economic duress compelling SPML to withdraw any\n pending claims under the subject contract as a condition for the\n return of the Bank Guarantees. On the contrary, the only allegation\n by SPML was with respect to NTPC's \"illegal\" action of\n interlinking the release of the Bank Guarantees with some other\n contracts. This was precisely the argument before the High Court,\n and, in fact, this submission is recorded by the High Court while\n issuing notice and injuncting NTPC. This fact clearly indicates that\n the plea of coercion and economic duress leading to the Settlement\n Agreement is an afterthought.\n\n 46. We will now examine whether the allegations of coercion\n and economic duress in the execution of the Settlement Agreement\n\n 24\n\n (2021) 16 SCC 743\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 27 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n are bona fide or not. This inquiry has a direct bearing on the\n arbitrability of the dispute. It was during the subsistence of the\n Writ Petition and the High Court's interim order, when SPML had\n complete protection of the Court, that the parties entered into the\n Settlement Agreement. This agreement was comprehensive. It inter\n alia provided for (i) the release of Bank Guarantees by NTPC, (ii)\n the withdrawal of SPML's Writ Petition, (iii) restraining NTPC\n from filing contempt proceedings against SPML for letting the\n Bank Guarantees expire, and finally, (iv) restraining SPML from\n initiating any proceedings under the subject contract, including\n arbitration. The Settlement Agreement also recorded that there\n were no subsisting issues pending between the parties.\n\n 47. The plea of coercion and economic duress must be seen in\n the context of the execution of the Settlement Agreement not being\n disputed, and its implementation leading to the release of the Bank\n Guarantees on 30.06.2020 also not being disputed. Almost three\n weeks after the release of the Bank Guarantees, a letter of\n repudiation was issued by SPML on 22.07.2020. This letter was\n issued about two months after the Settlement Agreement was\n executed and in fact during the subsistence of the Writ Petition.\n\n After reaping the benefits of the Settlement Agreement, the Writ\n Petition was withdrawn on 21.09.2020. It is thereafter that the\n present application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act was filed. The\n sequence of events leads us to conclude that the letter of\n repudiation was issued only to wriggle out of the terms of the\n Settlement Agreement.\n\n 48. The foregoing clarifies beyond doubt that the claims sought\n to be submitted to arbitration were raised as an afterthought.\n Further, SPML's allegations of coercion and economic duress in\n the execution of the Settlement Agreement lack bona fide. They\n are liable to be knocked down as ex facie frivolous and untenable.\n\n 49. In view of the above-referred facts, which speak for\n themselves, we are of the opinion that this is a case where the High\n Court should have exercised the prima facie test to screen and\n strike down the ex-facie meritless and dishonest litigation. These\n are the kinds of cases where the High Court should exercise the\n restricted and limited review to check and protect parties from\n being forced to arbitrate.\"\n\n 42.

The scope of examination by the Court in the light of \nSection\n 11(6A)\n and the law that has developed in that regard was also\n examined by various other decisions, which are not, however, of\n particular significance to the present case, but may be noticed. \nIn\n \nMagic Eye Developers Pvt Ltd v. Green Edge Infrastructure Pvt\n Ltd25\n, a Bench of two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court examined\n the extent to which a \nSection 11(6)\n referral court could examine the\n plea of existence of validity of the arbitration agreement. The\n Supreme Court noted the introduction of \nSection 11(6A)\n and the\n principle stated therein, that the Court could only examine whether an\n arbitration agreement exists between the parties; nothing more,\n nothing less. Thereafter, however, the Supreme Court reiterated the\n view expressed in para 25 of NTPC that the referral court was\n required to enquire as to the parties to the agreement and the\n applicant's privity to the agreement, and conclusively decide this issue\n at the referral stage itself. Similarly, held the Supreme Court in para\n 12 of the report in Magic Eye Developers, the dispute regarding the\n existence of the validity of the arbitration agreement has also to be\n conclusively determined by the referral court, and cannot be left for\n decision by the Arbitral Tribunal. Paras 9 to 13 of Magic Eye\n Developers may be reproduced, thus, in this context:\n\n 25\n\n (2023) 8 SCC 50\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 29 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n \"9. Thus, post-\nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act,\n 2015\n, the jurisdiction of the court under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act is\n limited to examining whether an arbitration agreement exists\n between the parties - \"nothing more, nothing less\". Thus, as per\n the \nSection 11(6A)\n of the Act, it is the duty cast upon the referral\n court to consider the dispute/issue with respect to the existence of\n an arbitration agreement.\n\n 10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the settled\n position of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court under \nSection\n 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act is very narrow and inheres two\n inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the\n validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry\n as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the\n said agreement. The said matter requires a thorough examination\n by the referral court. [para 25 of the decision in NTPC] The\n Secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is\n with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. Both are\n different and distinct.\n\n \n11. So far as the first issue with respect to the existence and the\n validity of an arbitration agreement is concerned, as the same goes\n to the root of the matter, the same has to be to conclusively decided\n by the referral court at the referral stage itself. Now, so far as the\n non-arbitrability of the dispute is concerned, even as per the law\n laid-down by this Court in the case of \nVidya Drolia\n (supra), the\n court at prereferral stage and while examining the jurisdiction\n under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act may even consider prima facie\n examining the arbitrability of claims. As observed, the prima facie\n review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood and trim off\n the side branches in straightforward cases where dismissal is\n barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation\n must stop at the first stage.\n\n 12. However, so far as the dispute with respect to the existence\n and validity of an arbitration agreement is concerned and when the\n same is raised at pre-referral stage, the referral court has to decide\n the said issue conclusively and finally and should not leave the\n said issue to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. The reason is\n that the issue with respect to the existence and validity of an\n arbitration agreement goes to the root of the matter.\n\n 13. As observed by the Constitution Bench in the case of N.N.\n Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd.26, sans an agreement, there cannot be\n any reference to the arbitration. \nIn \nthe said decision\n this Court has\n\n 26\n\nN.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd v.

We are of the opinion that\n therefore, if the dispute/issue with respect to the existence and\n validity of an arbitration agreement is not conclusively and finally\n decided by the referral court while exercising the pre-referral\n jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n and it is left to the arbitral tribunal,\n it will be contrary to \nSection 11(6A)\n of the Arbitration Act. It is the\n duty of the referral court to decide the said issue first conclusively\n to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when there\n does not exist any arbitration agreement and/or when there is no\n valid arbitration agreement at all.\"\n\n \n44. Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court\n in \nLombardi Engineering Ltd v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam\n Ltd27\n, reiterated the legal position emerging from Duro Felguera and\n Vidya Drolia, after referring to the relevant passages from the said\n decisions:\n\n \n\"29. Following the general rule and the principle \nlaid down\n in\n \nVidya Drolia\n (supra), this Court has consistently been holding\n that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine\n and decide all questions of non-arbitrability.\n \nIn \nPravin Electricals\n (P) Ltd v.

A deeper analysis into the aspect of the parties to arbitration,\n and the extent to which this could be decided by a referral court under\n \nSection 11(6)\n was undertaken by a constitution Bench of the Supreme\n Court in Cox and Kings, before which the issue which had arisen for\n consideration was thus delineated:\n\n \"2. Five Judges of this Court are called upon to determine the\n validity of the \"Group of Companies\" doctrine in the jurisprudence\n of Indian arbitration. The doctrine provides that an arbitration\n agreement which is entered into by a company within a group of\n companies may bind non-signatory affiliates, if the circumstances\n are such as to demonstrate the mutual intention of the parties to\n bind both signatories and non-signatories. This doctrine is called\n into question purportedly on the ground that it interferes with the\n established legal principles such as party autonomy, privity of\n contract, and separate legal personality. The challenge before this\n Court is to figure out whether there can be a reconciliation between\n the Group of Companies doctrine and well-settled legal principles\n of corporate law and contract law.\"\n\n 46. The following question of law had been referred by a Bench of\n three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, for determination by a\n Larger Bench, in Cox and Kings:\n\n \"5.1. (a) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be read\n into \nSection 8\n of the Act or whether it can exist in Indian\n jurisprudence independent of any statutory provision;\n\n 5.2. (b) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should continue\n to be invoked on the basis of the principle of \"single economic\n reality\";\n\n 5.3. (c) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be\n construed as a means of interpreting implied consent or intent to\n arbitrate between the parties; and\n\n 5.4. (d) Whether the principles of alter ego and/or piercing the\n corporate veil can alone justify pressing the Group of Companies\n doctrine into operation even in the absence of implied consent.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 32 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n 47. After considering a veritable plethora of decisions not only by\n the Supreme Court of India, but also the law as it exists in France,\n Switzerland, England, Singapore and the US, the Supreme Court\n examined in detail the circumstances in which a party who was not a\n signatory to the arbitration agreement could nonetheless be made a\n party to the proceedings. The conclusion of the Supreme Court on\n this issue is to be found in paras 83, 84 and 86 of the report, which\n read thus:\n\n \"83. Reading \nSection 7\n of the Arbitration Act in view of the\n above discussion gives rise to the following conclusions : first,\n arbitration agreements arise out of a legal relationship between or\n among persons or entities which may be contractual or otherwise;\n second, in situations where the legal relationship is contractual in\n nature, the nature of relationship can be determined on the basis of\n general contract law principles; third, it is not necessary for the\n persons or entities to be signatories to the arbitration agreement to\n be bound by it; fourth, in case of non-signatory parties, the\n important determination for the Courts is whether the persons or\n entities intended or consented to be bound by the arbitration\n agreement or the underlying contract containing the arbitration\n agreement through their acts or conduct; fifth, the requirement of a\n written arbitration agreement has to be adhered to strictly, but the\n form in which such agreement is recorded is irrelevant; sixth, the\n requirement of a written arbitration agreement does not exclude the\n possibility of binding non-signatory parties if there is a defined\n legal relationship between the signatory and non-signatory parties;\n and seventh, once the validity of an arbitration agreement is\n established, the Court or tribunal can determine the issue of which\n parties are bound by such agreement.\n\n 84. It is presumed that the formal signatories to an arbitration\n agreement are parties who will be bound by it. However, in\n exceptional cases persons or entities who have not signed or\n formally assented to a written arbitration agreement or the\n underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement may be\n held to be bound by such agreement. As mentioned in the\n preceding paragraphs, the doctrine of privity limits the imposition\n of rights and liabilities on third parties to a contract. Generally,\n only the parties to an arbitration agreement can be subject to the\n full effects of the agreement in terms of the reliefs and remedies\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 33 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n because they consented to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\n Therefore, the decisive question before the Courts or tribunals is\n whether a non-signatory consented to be bound by the arbitration\n agreement. To determine whether a non-signatory is bound by an\n arbitration agreement, the Courts and tribunals apply typical\n principles of contract law and corporate law. The legal doctrines\n provide a framework for evaluating the specific contractual\n language and the factual settings to determine the intentions of the\n parties to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\n\n *****\n\n 86. Courts and tribunals across the world have been applying\n traditional contractual and commercial doctrines to determine the\n consent of the non-signatory parties to be bound by the arbitration\n agreement. Generally, consent-based theories such as agency,\n novation, assignment, operation of law, merger and succession,\n and third-party beneficiaries have been applied in different\n jurisdictions. In exceptional circumstances, non-consensual\n theories such as piercing the corporate veil or alter ego and\n estoppel have also been applied to bind a non-signatory party to an\n arbitration agreement. The Group of Companies doctrine is one\n such consent-based doctrine which has been applied, albeit\n controversially, for identifying the real intention of the parties to\n bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement.\"\n\n 48. In para 97, the Supreme Court advocated the interpretation of\n commercial contracts in a pragmatic manner, keeping in mind\n commercial realities:\n\n \"97....... The Courts must interpret contracts in a manner that\n would give them a sense of efficacy rather than invalidating the\n commercial interests of the parties. The meaning of the contract\n must be gathered by adopting a common sense approach, which\n should \" not be allowed to be thwarted by a narrow, pedantic and\n legalistic interpretation\". Therefore, there is a need to adopt a\n modern approach to consent, which takes into consideration the\n circumstances, apparent conduct, and commercial facets of\n business transactions.\"\n\n 49. The position which emerges where there are multiple\n agreements was also examined thus, in paras 121 and 122 of the\n report:\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 34 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n \"121. In case of a composite transaction involving multiple\n agreements, it would be incumbent for the Courts and tribunals to\n assess whether the agreements are consequential or in the nature of\n a follow-up to the principal agreement. This Court in Canara\n Bank33observed that a composite transaction refers to a situation\n where the transaction is interlinked in nature or where the\n performance of the principal agreement may not be feasible\n without the aid, execution, and performance of the supplementary\n or ancillary agreements.\n\n 122. The general position of law is that parties will be referred\n to arbitration under the principal agreement if there is a situation\n where there are disputes and differences \"in connection with\" the\n main agreement and also disputes \"connected with \" the subject-\n\n matter of the principal agreement. In Chloro Controls34, this Court\n clarified that the principle of \"composite performance\" would have\n to be gathered from the conjoint reading of the principal and\n supplementary agreements on the one hand, and the explicit\n intention of the parties and attendant circumstances on the other.\n The common participation in the commercial project by the\n signatory and non-signatory parties for the purposes of achieving a\n common purpose could be an indicator of the fact that all the\n parties intended the non-signatory party to be bound by the\n arbitration agreement. Thus, the application of the Group of\n Companies doctrine in case of composite transactions ensures\n accountability of all parties who have materially participated in the\n negotiation and performance of the transaction and by doing so\n have evinced a mutual intent to be bound by the agreement to\n arbitrate.\"\n\n 50. The threshold standard was thus explained:\n\n \"127. In Cox & Kings35, Surya Kant, J. observed that Reckitt\n Benckiser36 fixed a higher threshold of evidence for the\n application of the Group of Companies doctrine as compared to\n earlier decisions of this Court. This Court's approach is Reckitt\n Benckiser is indicative of the fact that the mere presence of a\n group of companies is not the sole or determinative factor to bind a\n non-signatory to an arbitration agreement. Rather, the Courts or\n tribunals should closely evaluate the overall conduct and\n involvement of the non-signatory party in the performance of the\n contract.

In other words, the test is to\n determine whether the non-signatory has a positive, direct, and\n substantial involvement in the negotiation, performance, or\n termination of the contract. Mere incidental involvement in the\n negotiation or performance of the contract is not sufficient to infer\n the consent of the non-signatory to be bound by the underlying\n contract or its arbitration agreement. The burden is on the party\n seeking joinder of the non-signatory to the arbitration agreement to\n prove a conscious and deliberate conduct of involvement of the\n non-signatory based on objective evidence.\n\n 128. An arbitration agreement is a distinct and separate\n agreement from the substantive commercial contract which\n contains the arbitration agreement. An arbitration agreement is\n independent of the other terms of the contract, to the extent that\n nullification of the contract will not lead to invalidation of the\n arbitration agreement. The concept of separability of the arbitration\n agreement from the underlying contract ensures that the intention\n of the parties to resolve the disputes through arbitration does not\n vanish merely because of a challenge to the legal validity of the\n underlying contract.al. To join a non-signatory to arbitration, the\n decisive question that has to be answered is whether a non-\n signatory consented to the arbitration agreement, as distinct from\n the underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement.\n\n *****\n\n 132. We are of the opinion that there is a need to seek a balance\n between the consensual nature of arbitration and the modern\n commercial reality where a non-signatory becomes implicated in a\n commercial transaction in a number of different ways. Such a\n balance can be adequately achieved if the factors laid down under\n Discovery Enterprises37 are applied holistically. For instance, the\n involvement of the non-signatory in the performance of the\n underlying contract in a manner that suggests that it intended to be\n bound by the contract containing the arbitration agreement is an\n important aspect. Other factors such as the composite nature of\n transaction and commonality of subject-matter would suggest that\n the claims against the non-signatory were strongly interlinked with\n the subject-matter of the tribunal's jurisdiction. Looking at the\n factors holistically, it could be inferred that the non-signatories, by\n virtue of their relationship with the signatory parties and active\n involvement in the performance of commercial obligations which\n are intricately linked to the subject-matter, are not actually\n\n 37\n\n ONGC Ltd v.

Thereafter, the Supreme Court went into the aspect of the\n standard of determination by a referral court, which was the last issue\n arising for consideration before it. In para 161, the Supreme Court\n noted the insertion of sub section (6A) in \nSection 11\n of the 1996 Act\n by the 2015 Amendment Act, as well as the omission of the said\n inserted sub section (6A) by the 2019 Amendment Act, and observed\n that, as the amendment to \nSection 11\n by the 2019 Amendment Act\n have yet to be notified, \nSection 11(6A)\n continues to remain in force.\n Thereafter comes para 163, on which Mr. Rao relies:\n\n \"163. \nSection 16\n of the Arbitration Act enshrines the principle of\n competence-competence in Indian arbitration law. The provision\n empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction,\n including any ruling on any objections with respect to the existence\n or validity of arbitration agreement. \nSection 16\n is an inclusive\n provision which comprehends all preliminary issues touching upon\n the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The doctrine of\n competence-competence is intended to minimise judicial\n intervention at the threshold stage. The issue of determining parties\n to an arbitration agreement goes to the very root of the\n jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunal.\"\n\n 52. Following this, in para 166, the Constitution Bench held that, at\n the referral stage, a Court has only to determine prima facie existence\n of an arbitration agreement and if the issue could not be determined\n by the referral court, it has to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. It\n was emphasized that \"referral court\" should not unnecessarily\n interfere with the arbitral proceedings and, rather, show allow the\n Arbitral Tribunal to exercise its primary jurisdiction.\n\n 53.

In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an arbitration\n agreement, the following two scenarios will prominently emerge:\n\n first, where a signatory party to an arbitration agreement seeks\n joinder of a non-signatory party to the arbitration agreement; and\n second, where a non-signatory party itself seeks invocation of an\n arbitration agreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will\n be required to prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration\n agreement and whether the non -signatory is a veritable party to\n the arbitration agreement. In view of the complexity of such a\n determination, the referral court should leave it for the Arbitral\n Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory party is indeed a\n party to the arbitration agreement on the basis of the factual\n evidence and application of legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve\n into the factual, circumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to\n decide whether its jurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party.\n In the process, the Tribunal should comply with the requirements\n of principles of natural justice such as giving opportunity to the\n non-signatory to raise objections with regard to the jurisdiction of\n the Arbitral Tribunal. This interpretation also gives true effect to\n the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of\n determination of true parties to an arbitration agreement to be\n decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 16\n.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 54. Following the above discussion, in para 170 and in its various\n sub-paras, the Supreme Court has laid down determinative\n conclusions, of which the following are relevant for the present\n dispute:\n\n \"170.1. The definition of \"parties\" under \nSection 2(1)(h)\n read with\n \nSection 7\n of the Arbitration Act includes both the signatory as well\n as non-signatory parties;\n\n 170.2. Conduct of the non-signatory parties could be an indicator\n of their consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement;\n\n 170.3. The requirement of a written arbitration agreement under\n \nSection 7\n does not exclude the possibility of binding non-signatory\n parties;\n\n 170.4. \nUnder the Arbitration Act\n, the concept of a \"party\" is\n distinct and different from the concept of \"persons claiming\n through or under\" a party to the arbitration agreement;\n\n 170.5. The underlying basis for the application of the Group of\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 38 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n Companies doctrine rests on maintaining the corporate\n separateness of the group companies while determining the\n common intention of the parties to bind the non-signatory party to\n the arbitration agreement;\n\n *****\n\n 170.12. At the referral stage, the referral court should leave it for\n the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory is bound\n by the arbitration agreement; and\"\n\n 55. The resultant position that emerges from a consolidated reading\n of all these decisions is that, while the legal position as it existed prior\n to 2015 empowered - rather, required - the referral court could enter\n into several aspects such as existence of fraud, validity of the contract,\n discharge of liability by accord and satisfaction and the like, this\n position does not continue after the insertion of sub section (6A) in\n \nSection 11\n by 2015 Amendment Act. Inasmuch as the omission of\n \nSection 11(6A)\n by the 2019 Amendment Act is yet to be notified, the\n sub-section continues to remain in force. \nSection 11(6A)\n considerably\n restricts the scope of inquiry by the referral court under \nSection 11(6)\n.\n The referral court is essentially to concern itself with the existence\n and validity of the arbitration agreement. Peripheral, but connected,\n issues such as the aspect of limitation, and whether non-signatories to\n an arbitration agreement can be bound by it, would also fall for\n determination by the referral court. While examining these issues, the\n referral court has to adopt a prima facie approach and is not to arrive\n at a conclusive determination. The final arbiter on these issues is, by\n operation of \nSection 16\n, the Arbitral Tribunal, and the jurisdiction of\n the Arbitral Tribunal in that regard has to be respected. The referral\n court, however, cannot completely distance itself, while examining\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 39 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n the existence of validity of an arbitration agreement, from the aspect\n of whether parties, who are being sought to be included in the arbitral\n proceedings, are or are not required to be included. If, however, it is\n not possible from the material on record to arrive at a prima facie\n finding in this regard, then, applying the kompetenz kompetenz\n principle and in view of \nSection 16\n of the 1996 Act, the matter has to\n be left for determination by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n 56. It is in the backdrop of these principles and standards that the\n rival contentions of learned Counsel have to be examined.\n\n On merits\n\n 57. If the contention of learned Counsel for both the respondents\n were to be accepted, the sequitur would be that the petitioner's claims\n could never be arbitrated, and that is obviously not acceptable. Every\n arbitrable dispute must be arbitrated, if the arbitral institution is to\n retain any validity and legitimacy. It is not open to the Court to hold\n that there exists an arbitral dispute, but it cannot be arbitrated.\n\n 58. Indeed, neither of the respondents contends that there is no\n arbitrable dispute. Each of the respondents contends that the dispute\n is solely between the petitioner and the other respondent. Ambience\n contends that the dispute is between the petitioner and Tutelage,\n whereas Tutelage contends that the dispute between the petitioner and\n Ambience. The petitioner contends, on the other hand, that the\n dispute is with both Respondents 1 and 2. The only issue before the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 40 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n Court is whether one, or the other, or both the respondents, have to be\n made parties to the arbitration.\n\n 59. In exercise of its jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n and in the\n light of \nSection 11(6A)\n and the law that has developed in that regard,\n which reached its high watermark in Cox and Kings, the Court can\n examine this issue only on a prima facie basis. If, prima facie, the\n Court is able to arrive at a conclusion that either Ambience or\n Tutelage - but not both - cannot be impleaded in the proposed\n arbitration, the Court must so hold. While examining the issue,\n however, the Court must be conscious of the autonomy that vests in\n the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard. As Cox and Kings holds, it is\n fundamentally for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide who should, or\n should not, be a party before it. It is always open to a party before the\n Arbitral Tribunal to contend that it has been unnecessarily roped in,\n and to seek deletion from the array of parties. It is not, therefore, as\n though any permanent prejudice results to either of the parties, even if\n this Court were to refer the dispute between the petitioner and both the\n respondents to arbitration. The only situation in which any lasting\n prejudice may result is if the Court were to affirmatively hold that one\n or the other respondent cannot be impleaded in the arbitral\n proceedings. If this Court so holds, even prima facie, it is bound to\n inhibit the discretion vested in the Arbitral Tribunal in that regard. Of\n course, that said, the Court must, while referring the dispute to\n arbitration, ensure that parties, who are clearly not necessary parties,\n and are not roped in. This is also a pre-eminent consideration. The\n Court cannot blindly accept the stand of either party and refer the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 41 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n dispute to arbitration, where one or the other party contests its liability\n to be subjected to arbitral proceedings.\n\n 60. The present controversy at hand, has to be examined keeping in\n mind all these factors.\n\n 61. The claims that the petitioner proposes to refer to arbitration\n included providing of a habitable and usable access to the petitioner to\n the leased area and reimbursement of the amount incurred by the\n petitioner in executing repair works in the leased area, apart from\n compensation for the losses incurred by the petitioner. Paras 3, 4.1,\n 4.2 and 4.3 of the Notice of Demand dated 10 August 2023 addressed\n by the petitioner to the respondents involves both the respondents\n within the ambit of the disputes. Para 4.1 flags a claim of ₹ 1,\n 29,01,487.90, which is stated to have been spent by the petitioner in\n making the leased area habitable and usable. The petitioner claims the\n said amount from Ambience. Para 4.2 includes other costs incurred\n by the petitioner. The petitioner points that, as this included\n enhancement made by the petitioner to the leased area which cannot\n be removed, Tutelage would continue to benefit from the said\n enhancement installed at the petitioner's costs. The amounts incurred\n towards these enhancements are, therefore, being sought both from\n Ambience and Tutelage. As Mr. Rao points out, even after Tutelage\n purchased the leased area on 18 November 2022, nearly nine months\n elapsed before the leased area was handed over by the petitioner to\n Tutelage. During this period, the prejudice to the petitioner\n continued, and Tutelage made no efforts to redress it. According to\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 42 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n the petitioner, it continued to be prejudiced by having to hold\n possession of an inhabitable and unusable area. It had, in the process,\n to incur expenses towards transportation, loading and unloading fee,\n moving fee, storage fee, rent, security deposit, incidental expenses and\n expenses towards architectural services, design services, fit outs,\n construction registration, installation, structural assessment, security\n services and transit insurance, apart from other costs. Both the\n respondents, according to Mr. Rao, would be liable to reimburse these\n expenses and costs, to one extent or the other, and the extent to which\n either petitioner would be liable, would have to be arbitrated.\n\n 62. It cannot be said, at this prima facie stage, without a\n comprehensive examination of the entire dispute and possibly by\n leading of evidence, that all these expenses would, if they were found\n to be payable to the petitioner, have to be borne either by Ambience or\n by Tutelage, to the exclusion of the other.\n\n 63. Inasmuch as the petitioner's primary contention is that\n Ambience was in breach of its liability to provide, to the petitioner, a\n leased area in a habitable and usable form, and Clause 23.1 of the\n Lease Deed dated 15 January 2021 specifically insulates Ambience\n from \"further liability\", it would require consideration as to whether,\n if the alleged breach of the lease agreement is found to have actually\n taken place, Ambience can claim immunity from liability in that\n regard on the ground that it had sold the leased area to Tutelage on 18\n November 2022. This would have to be decided keeping in mind the\n covenants of the Lease Deed and the terms of sale of the leased area\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 43 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n from Ambience to Tutelage. It would further have to be examined\n whether the sale of the leased area by Ambience to Tutelage\n transferred all obligations by Ambience to Tutelage including the\n obligations relating to a period prior to 18 November 2022. The\n effect of the email 29 August 2022 from Ambience to the petitioner,\n which acknowledges the fact that the compressive strength of certain\n columns from the eighth floor is not as per the latest design\n parameters and assures the petitioner that Ambience aligning its teams\n to have changes executed at the site, would also have to be\n considered. Inasmuch as the petitioner is seeking damages, and had to\n continue to remain in possession of the leased area for a considerable\n period even after 18 November 2022, the extent to which these\n damages, if payable to the petitioner, would have to be apportioned\n between Ambience and Tutelage, would also fall for determination.\n\n 64. In my opinion, these are all intricate mixed issues of fact, which\n have to be determined keeping in mind all the attendant facts and\n circumstances and may require a detailed analysis of the material on\n record, perhaps by requiring evidence to be led. Applying the\n principle in the judgments cited earlier, these are not aspects on which\n this Court can, even prima facie, arrive at a conclusion, which would\n bind the Arbitral Tribunal. The cumulative effect of Clauses 3, 8 and\n sub clauses (xv), (xxiv) of Clause 9(a) and Clause 9(b) of the Sale\n Deed dated 18 November 2022, as well as Clause 23.1 of the Lease\n Deed dated 15 January 2021 would also be required to be examined.\n\n 65. Given the law in this regard, I am of the opinion that these\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 44 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n aspects have necessarily to be left for determination by the Arbitral\n Tribunal and, within the limited scope of jurisdiction of this Court in\n view of \nSection 11(6)\n read with \nSection 11(6A)\n of the 1996 Act, it is\n not appropriate for this Court to enter into this territory and return any\n definitive findings thereon, even if they are prima facie. The very fact\n that each respondent is seeking to palm off the liability on the other\n gives rise to disputed and triable factual issues, which would fall\n within the exclusive province of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n 66. I cannot, therefore, concur with the submission either of Mr.\n Raajan or Mr. Sachar that either of the respondents has unnecessarily\n been dragged into the arbitral proceedings. While it would be open to\n both the respondents to convince the learned Arbitral Tribunal that it\n should be deleted from the array of parties, I am of the opinion that\n such a request, if made, should be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal,\n and that within the limited scope of \nSection 11(6)\n of the 1996 Act, this\n Court should not pronounce on this issue.\n\n Conclusion\n\n 67. For all the aforesaid reasons, the objections of Ambience and\n Tutelage, to their proposed inclusion in the arbitral proceedings, are\n rejected. This shall, however, not inhibit either of the respondents\n from raising the issue before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. If it is so\n raised, it shall be decided in accordance with law, uninhibited by any\n observations in this judgment, which have been made solely for\n disposing of the present petition under \nSection 11(6)\n of the 1996 Act.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 45 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\n AN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n 68.

The notice alleged that the\n leased area was not habitable and that the columns in the leased area\n did not possess the requisite compressive strength and would require\n repair. As neither Ambience nor Tutelage took any steps in this\n regard, the notice alleged that the petitioner had to spend considerable\n amounts in attempting to make the leased area habitable.

In these circumstances, the notice alleged that the\n petitioner was not in a position to enjoy the leased area. The\n petitioner, therefore, invoked Clause 18.2 of the lease deed which\n entitled the petitioner to terminate the lease deed, if the leased area\n became unusable for the petitioner. Alleging that Ambience was in\n fundamental breach of its obligations under the lease deed, and had\n failed to provide the usable leased area to the petitioner despite\n repeated representations in that regard, the petitioner stated that it\n intended to terminate the lease deed. The respondents were therefore\n called upon to cure the defaults in the leased area within 60 days, by\n providing a habitable and usable access to the leased area and\n reimbursing to the petitioner the amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90, stated to\n have been incurred by the petitioner in executing the repairs in the\n leased area.

In view of the complexity of such a\n determination, the referral court should leave it for the Arbitral\n Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory party is indeed a\n party to the arbitration agreement on the basis of the factual\n evidence and application of legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve\n into the factual, circumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to\n decide whether its jurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party.\n In the process, the Tribunal should comply with the requirements\n of principles of natural justice such as giving opportunity to the\n non-signatory to raise objections with regard to the jurisdiction of\n the Arbitral Tribunal. This interpretation also gives true effect to\n the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of\n determination of true parties to an arbitration agreement to be\n decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 16\n.\""
