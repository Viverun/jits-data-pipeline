Essentially allegations against her are that before finalization of\nthe marriage, she along with other family members had demanded dowry. In\nSeptember, 2024, they had gone to the house of the Complainant and\nthreatened him to make his daughter withdraw her complaint in UK and also\ndemanded Rs.5,00,000/-.\n\n3. It is submitted that the Petitioner has been implicated falsely in this\ncase. She is the aunt (bua) of the main accused Pankaj Lamba, husband of\nthe deceased who is daughter of the Complainant, apprehending arrest in the\naforesaid FIR. She has sought Bail on the grounds that the bare perusal of\nthe FIR reveals that the allegations made by the Complainant are general\nand sweeping against the Applicant, who had no nexus with the\nComplainant's daughter. It is the own case of the prosecution that the\ndeceased left her matrimonial home only after a few days and joined her\nhusband in U.K. There was no opportunity for the Applicant to treat the\ndeceased with cruelty or to harass her or demand dowry.\n\n4. Initially, the FIR was registered under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\nIPC, but\nsubsequently\nSection 304B\nIPC has been added. It is claimed that it has been\nadded wrongly since the Applicant had no nexus with the Complainant's\ndaughter nor she had subjected her to any kind of cruelty or harassment in\nrelations to dowry demand.\n\n5. The Anticipatory Bail Application of the Applicant has been\ndismissed by learned Sessions Court on 01.04.2025. It is submitted that FIR\ndoes not disclose any allegation of cruelty or harassment at the instance of\nthe applicant inverted soon before the debt, which resulted in the dowry debt\nwith the deceased.\n\n6. Reliance has been placed upon\nManohar Lal vs. State of Haryana,\nThis\nis a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 30/06/2025 at 02:23:29\n(2014) 9 SCC 645, wherein, the Apex Court observed that facts must show\nexistence of proximate live link between the effect of cruelty based on\ndowry demand and death of victim. The Applicant being in India, had no\nknowledge of what transpired between the deceased and her husband Pankaj\nLamba, the main accused.\n\n7. Reliance has also been placed upon\nBalwant Singh and Anr. vs. State\nof Punjab\n, (2004) 7 SCC 724, wherein, the Apex Court has noted that one\nof the ingredients of the offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC is that such cruelty\nshould have been meted out to the deceased soon before her death. It is for\nthe prosecution to establish, affirmatively that the victim was subjected to\ncruelty and harassment based on dowry demand soon before her death. In\nthe present case, at least for a year and 3 months had lapsed before her death\nand there is no evidence even to remotely suggest that the victim was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment of the nature specified in\nSection 304B\n\nIPC.\n\n8. The Applicant, in fact, had always treated the deceased with love and\nrespect and husband of the applicant had also transferred approximately\nRs.15 lacs to the account of the deceased, so as to facilitate her visa for U.K.\nIt is further submitted that she has clean antecedents and she undertakes not\nto flee from justice and is ready to abide by any conditions may be imposed.\nHence, Anticipatory Bail is sought in FIR No. 0705/2024.\n\n9.

It is further submitted that Lalita, the\nApplicant had been granted interim protection vide order dated 08.04.2025\nby this Court, who had directed that no coercive action be taken against the\nPetitioner. She joined the investigation and interrogated in detail, but she did\nnot give any information about the main accused Pankaj Lamba, husband of\ndeceased. During investigation, the bank account details were collected and\nmobile phones were recovered from the accused persons, which have been\nsent to FSL.\n\n11. The Anticipatory Bail Application is opposed on the ground of there\nbeing specific allegations against the Applicant for demand of dowry and\nharassment. The statement of the father of the deceased has been recorded,\nwherein, he has stated that the husband of the Applicant along with his\nrelatives had come to his house and threatened him to withdraw the\nComplaint which was filed by the father of deceased against her husband\nPankaj Lamba. Serious offence has been committed, wherein, Pankaj\nLamba, husband of deceased has been charged by U.K. Police with murder\nof his wife, Harshita Barella.

They both along\nwith the parents had demanded for dowry. Even later in September 2024,\nthreat had been extended to the parents of the deceased to ask her to\nwithdraw her Complaint filed by her with the U.K. Police and demand of\nRs.5 lacs was made. It is therefore submitted that in view of the serious\ndowry harassment allegations and the murder of the deceased in U.K., the\nBail may not be granted to the Applicant.\n\n13.
