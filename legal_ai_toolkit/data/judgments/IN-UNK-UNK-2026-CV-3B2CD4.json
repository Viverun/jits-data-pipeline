Criminal Miscellaneous Bail Application No. 10994/2023\n\n Shishpal @ Sanjay Kumar S/o Jagdish Chandra, Aged About 31\n Years, R/o Mallarkhera P.s. Tibbi Dist. Hanumangarh. At Present\n Near K.r. School, Sangaria Tehsil Sangaria Dist. Hanumangarh\n (At Present Lodged In Dist. Jail, Hanumangarh)\n ----Petitioner\n Versus\n State Of Rajasthan, Through PP\n ----Respondent\n\n For Petitioner(s) : Mr. Achala Ram\n For Respondent(s) : Mr. Vikram Sharma, PP\n\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJENDRA PRAKASH SONI\n\n Order\n\nReportable\n01/03/2024\n\n1. The petitioner has approached this Court under \nSection 439\n\nof the Cr.P.C. seeking bail. He has been arrested for violating the\n\nprovisions of the \nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n\n1985\n \n(NDPS Act\n) as per FIR No.85/2023 registered at Police\n\nStation Pilibanga, District Hanumangarh in respect of offence(s)\n\npunishable under Section(s) 8/15 of \nNarcotic Drugs and\n\nPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985\n.\n\n2. The first application for bail was disposed of without\n\nconsidering the merits of the case since it was not pressed by the\n\npetitioner.\n\n3. On the basis of a seizure effected by Sushil Kumar, SHO\n\nStation Pilibanga, District Hanumangarh, a formal FIR mentioned\n\nabove was registered against the accused alleging inter alia that\n\n (Downloaded on 05/03/2024 at 08:37:27 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:10966] (2 of 4) [CRLMB-10994/2023]\n\non February 16, 2023, at about 2:40 pm, on the road from\n\nSuratgarh to Hanumangarh, near Radha Swami Dera, SHO Sushil\n\nKumar of Pilibanga police station stopped a bus number RJ-31-PA-\n\n4432 during a blockade. It was suspected that some contraband\n\nwas kept in the bus. Sanjeev @ Sanjay Kumar was driving the\n\nbus. Upon being searched, 342 kg of poppy straw was recovered\n\nfrom the luggage box of the bus. Sanjeev @ Sanjay Kumar stated\n\nthat he and Shishpal had brought this contraband. Shishpal had\n\ndisembarked along the way.\n\n4. Shri Achala Ram, learned counsel representing the petitioner\n\nvehemently urged that the alleged contraband was recovered from\n\nthe possession of Sanjeev @ Sanjay Kumar, who was driving the\n\nbus. The applicant was neither found nor arrested on the spot. He\n\nhas been implicated to this case solely on the information of co-\n\naccused since he was conductor of the bus. He was arrested three\n\ndays after the incident. The recovered contraband was not\n\nexclusively and consciously in his possession. It is also argued that\n\npetitioner is innocent person and a false case has been foisted\n\nagainst him; that nothing has been recovered from possession of\n\nthe petitioner; that case of the prosecution is based on surmises\n\nand conjectures instead of sound legal evidence. With the\n\naforesaid submissions, it was prayed that the present petition be\n\nallowed and petitioner may be enlarged on bail.\n\n5. Whereas, learned Public Prosecutor would submit that these\n\nare factual issues which cannot be addressed at this stage and\n\nought to be determined only after trial. The contraband was jointly\n\nacquired by both Sanjeev and Shishpal. It was submitted that the\n\nInvestigating Officer had collected overwhelming evidence in the\n\n (Downloaded on 05/03/2024 at 08:37:27 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:10966] (3 of 4) [CRLMB-10994/2023]\n\ncase which would prima-facie point towards the guilt of the\n\naccused. Contraband of commercial quantity has been seized form\n\nthe accused; that the restrictions of \nSection 37\n of the N.D.P.S. Act\n\nclearly operate against the petitioner. He thus, craves rejection of\n\nthe petitioner's bail application.\n\n6. Heard the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the\n\napplicant, learned Public Prosecutor and carefully perused the\n\nentire material available on record.\n\n7. Having regard to the facts of the case and taking into\n\naccount totality of circumstances, in my considered opinion, the\n\nsubmissions made by learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be\n\noverlooked. Particularly, the fact that petitioner was neither found\n\non the spot nor in possession of the contraband at the time of\n\nrecovery; that he has been arrested after three days of recovery;\n\nthat only on the basis of information of co-accused, he has been\n\narraigned as an accused; that such information of the co-accused\n\nrecorded by a police officer, prima-facie not to be treated relevant\n\nfor proceeding against any other accused; that the bail rejection\n\norder goes to show that he is not involved in any other case under\n\nthe \nN.D.P.S. Act\n; that trial is likely to consume considerable time\n\nand no useful purpose would be served by keeping him in\n\ndetention for an indefinite period.\n\n8. Hence, in view of above facts and circumstances, this Court\n\nfeels that the accused has available to him, substantial grounds so\n\nas to challenge the prosecution case and also of the opinion that\n\nthe restriction contained in \nSection 37\n of NDPS Act does not\n\noperate to the prejudice of the petitioner. The petitioner is in\n\ncustody for the last one year; the bail rejection order goes to\n\n (Downloaded on 05/03/2024 at 08:37:27 PM)\n\n [2024:RJ-JD:10966] (4 of 4) [CRLMB-10994/2023]\n\n show that he is not involved in any other case under the \nNDPS\n\n Act\n.\n\n 9. Be that as it may, while desisting to make any comment on\n\n merits, I feel persuaded to exercise discretion in favour of\n\n petitioner for enlarging him on bail.\n\n 10. Consequently, the bail application is allowed. It is ordered\n\n that the accused-petitioner Shishpal @ Sanjay Kumar S/o\n\n Jagdish Chandra in F.I.R. No.85/2023 of Police Station Pilibanga,\n\n District Hanumangarh shall be released on bail; provided he\n\n furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and two surety bonds\n\n of Rs. 50,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court\n\n with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of\n\n hearing and as and when called upon to do so and if not required\n\n by Jail Authorities in any other case. This order is subject to the\n\n condition that accused, within 7 days of his release and sureties,\n\n on the day of furnishing bail, will also furnish details of their all\n\n bank accounts, with bank and branch name, in shape of an\n\n affidavit, and submit legible copy of their Aadhar cards as well as\n\n front page of Bank pass book, for smooth recovery of penalty\n\n amount, if there arise a need for recovery of penalty under\n\n \nSection 446\n Cr.P.C in future.\n\n (RAJENDRA PRAKASH SONI),J\n\n 6-Payal/-\n\n (Downloaded on 05/03/2024 at 08:37:27 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
